      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge-aware Collaborative Filtering with Pre-trained Language Model for Personalized Review-based Rating Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the information explosion era, ordinary users not only have the identity as consumers, but also play a role as content producers.\nThe effect has proved to be a double-edged sword.\nOn the one hand, it becomes more difficult for users to find what they are interested in due to the sheer volume of big data.\nOn the other hand, characterizing user interests with their own generated data is more promising.\nUser reviews are one kind of representative user-generated data, which are often seen in e-commerce platforms.\nTypically, each review involves a user who generates it, an item being rated, a rating score, and review text.\nMany research efforts have been devoted to utilizing reviews for personalized rating prediction  that estimates missing rating scores for different user-item pairs.\nCompared with conventional rating prediction that mainly relies on users, items, and rating scores, personalized review-based rating prediction  additionally leverages review text for achieving better prediction performance. Early personalized review-based rating prediction methods are keen on topic models to learn user or item representations    [ref]4.\nThese representations enhance the expressive ability of latent factor models such as matrix factorization  towards calculating ratings.\nLater on, deep learning-based models     become the mainstream approaches for this task.\nDue to the strength of performing deep representation learning directly on the unstructured raw text of reviews, they achieve improved performance over the early methods for rating prediction. Although much progress has been made to push forward research development and industrial application, most of the existing methods suffer from two issues.\nFirst, there lacks an effective manner of integrating the modeling of unstructured text and fine-grained aspects.\nIn reality, both the pure unstructured review text and its involved fine-grained aspects contain a wealth of knowledge.\nFor example, as a real case shown in Figure 1, the aspects, marked by green in the review text, address the key attributes of items and could reflect the attention of users.\nBesides these aspects, other words such as ‘soft’ and ‘nice’ depict the user’s attitude towards these aspects.\nMoreover, the introduction ‘with a little extra room for comfort’ also indicates the sentiment polarity to a certain extent.\nWithout modeling the pure unstructured text, the useful knowledge besides aspects might not be captured by rating prediction methods.\nExisting studies either focus on modeling pure unstructured text    or considering mining aspects from review text and learning aspect representations for rating prediction 0 1 2 3.\nHowever, few studies consider simultaneously utilizing them in a unified model for personalized review-based rating prediction.\nMotivated by this, a natural research question arises: how to effectively model the fine-grained aspects and unstructured review text to make them complement each other for the studied task.\nSecond, pre-trained language models (PLMs) 4 are rarely considered for the personalized review-based rating task, although they exhibit superior performance in various downstream tasks.\nTo our knowledge, there is one pre-trained language model study called NCEM 5.\nBut it only utilizes the pre-trained language model BERT 4 separately from the rating prediction model, without fine-tuning it.\nTherefore, another research question is how to effectively incorporate pre-trained language models into the rating prediction approach. To answer the above two research questions, in this paper, we propose Knowledge-aware Collaborative Filtering with Pre-trained Language Model (KCF-PLM), a novel model that combines review text, aspect, knowledge graph (KG), and pre-trained language model for personalized review-based rating prediction.\nFor the first question, we extract all the aspects from raw reviews and construct a KG wherein the nodes are composed of users, items, and aspects.\nThen for a given user-item pair to be predicted, we collect the aspects extracted from the reviews of the user and the item.\nWe define a field named aspect source to distinguish whether an aspect comes from the user, the item, or even both sides.\nFigure 1 shows an example, where ‘size’ occurs in both the user reviews and the item reviews, while ‘material’ only occurs in the user reviews.\nKCF-PLM leverages a transformer network to model the interactions of the aspects w.r.t. the user-item pair.\nAs such, the aspect representations could be contextualized, and the matching of user attention and item attributes could be captured. For the second question, KCF-PLM utilizes two pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT 4) to learn user and item representations based on their review text, respectively.\nThe pre-trained language models are incorporated into the whole rating prediction model by the following two manners. (1) Representation propagation on the KG.\nKCF-PLM uses graph neural networks (e.g., RGCN 6) to propagate representations so that different types of node representations are mutually affected.\nFor example, the representation of the user ‘A3HFC4WMB2LZD’ is affected by the aspect ‘material’ and the item ‘B00GMEVJJ4’ in the figure.\nThe representations of user and item nodes are then combined with the user and item representations from the pre-trained language models.\nAnd the representations of aspect nodes are also used to enhance the transformer network.\n(2) Personalized attention-based combination of the aspects.\nKCF-PLM further utilizes the combined user and item representations to guide the attention-based combination of the aspect representations from the transformer network.\nThis is motivated by the fact that the importance of an aspect varies from one user-item aspect to another user-item aspect. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are as follows: We propose KCF-PLM to model review text, aspect, and KG in a unified architecture, and thus rich knowledge could be captured. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model that simultaneously considers these factors for the task of personalized review-based rating prediction. We develop a transformer network to learn the interactions of structured review aspects and leverage pre-trained language models to learn the representations of unstructured review text in an end-to-end fashion. We conduct experiments on several real public datasets, demonstrating the proposed KCF-PLM significantly outperforms strong competitors and validating the effectiveness of the main considerations in KCF-PLM.
