On the other hand, machine learning methods, led by physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)  are mesh-free approaches, holding great potential in overcoming the COD and the capacity of seamlessly assimilating observation data. Chen et al.  adopted PINNs for solving forward and inverse problems of Fokker-Planck-Lévy equations. Zhang et al. [ref]33 solved FP equations via deep KD-tree under limited data scenarios. Zhai et al.  solved steady-state FP equations with deep learning. Lu et al.  learned high-dimensional multivariate probability density modeled by FP equations with normalizing flows. Feng et al. [ref]6 and Guo et al.  also adopted a normalization flow approach to FP equations. Moreover, Tang et al.  proposed a normalizing flow-based adaptive deep density approximation to steady-state FP equations.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: FP equations are ubiquitous in statistical mechanics, whose high dimensionality greatly threatens traditional methods such as finite difference [ref]5  and finite element methods.
