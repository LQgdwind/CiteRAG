      "content": "Paper Title: An Adaptive Federated Relevance Framework for Spatial Temporal Graph Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs our framework is composed of three key components, we thus examine on using different models in the feature transformation part, spatial-temporal graph generation part, and federated learning part. We first consider different candidates in the feature transformation net, aiming to find the best match that is capable of deriving high-quality features from the raw spatial-temporal data, which could be used as the initial node embedding for the spatial-temporal graph generation part. We choose CNN¬† as the default feature transformation net as it has already proven effective in our preliminary work¬†. However, we re-implement other models, which are used to process the spatial-temporal related data in other works, to verify their capability of extracting features under our framework: MLP-Mixer model is first introduced in¬†3 for image classification tasks. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the MLP-Mixer model uses a series of linear mixer layers, each consisting of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with global average pooling, to process the spatial and channel dimensions of the input image separately. This allows the model to capture both local and global features of the image in a computationally efficient manner. It also shows promising results when applied to extract the spatial temporal features in¬†.\n ConvLSTM¬† is a recurrent neural network (RNN) based architecture that extends the traditional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network by incorporating convolutional layers into the model. The input and hidden states of the LSTM in ConvLSTM are replaced with 3D tensors, where the third dimension corresponds to the channels (spatial) of the input. This allows the model to operate on input sequences with spatial information (e.g. images or videos) while capturing temporal dependencies in the data. ConvLSTM reports an excellent and consistent performance in capturing spatial-temporal correlations.\n Bi-LSTM¬†[ref]5 also has a RNN-based architecture. It consists of two LSTM layers, one of which processes the input sequence in a forward direction and another that processes it in a backward direction. This allows the model to take into account both past and future contexts when making predictions. The RNN backbone in Bi-LSTM also helps to uncover the correlations in the spatial-temporal data.\n Transformer¬†4 is a type of sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model that uses self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences in parallel. It consists of two main parts: the encoder and the decoder. The encoder takes the input sequence, encodes it into a sequence of hidden states, and generates a context vector that summarizes the input sequence. The decoder then takes the context vector as input, and generates an output sequence one token at a time. When processing the spatial-temporal data, it calculates the attention of channels (spatial) at each time step to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies.\n We also explore different strategies to quantify the node correlations, which serve as the adjacency matrix of the spatial-temporal graph. As explained in Section IV-B, DIIG enables a trainable correlation uncovering and embedding update simultaneously, and other three static methods are KùêæK-Nearest Neighbor (KùêæK-NN), Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and Phase Locking Value (PLV). The different node correlation functions are described below:\n KùêæK-NN¬†5 generates the adjacency matrix that only selects the kùëòk-th nearest neighbor of each node to represent the node correlation of the graph. The values in the adjacency matrix are either 0 or 1. PCC¬†6 is known as the Pearson correlation function, which measures the similarity between each pair of nodes using the node features. It scales the values in the adjacency matrix between 1 and -1. PLV¬†7 is a useful tool to measure the phase relationship between two node signals (features). It returns a value between 0 and 1 to qualify the consistency of each pair of nodes in the adjacency matrix. Regarding the GNN used in the DIIG for each participant (shown in Fig.¬†1.a), we compare the following models:\n GCN¬†8 is the first-order approximation to the spectral GNN model. It introduces a graph convolutional layer to aggregate messages from neighbor nodes. GraphSAGE¬†9 is the first type of GNN that introduces the sampling technique. Each node only selects a subset of connected neighbor nodes when operating the message aggregation. This model reports a good performance on large-scale graph learning. GAT¬† is the first work that incorporates the attention mechanism in GNN, computing attention scores for all connected node pairs for weighted message aggregation from neighboring nodes. GPS¬† introduces an adaptive sampling technique, in which only important neighbor nodes are selected to participate in the message aggregation process. The level of importance of each node is tuned at each training iteration. This method reports a good performance in terms of graph representation learning and generalisation on unseen nodes. When it comes to the FL setup, we compare our proposed FedRel with different baselines listed below. Note that only the trainable weights in DIIG unit and the global distribution estimator at the participant side contribute to the federated learning process (as indicated in Fig.¬†1b), and the feature transformation net only serves as the pre-trained model, which shares the same parameters across different participants.\n Centralized indicates the training of DIIG without FL settings, where data are stored in one place while being accessible to the model. FedAvg¬† is the first federated learning algorithm, which enables collaborative training of a number of local models from different participants. A central server receives uploaded model weights at each communication round and performs weight averaging. FedP¬†1 only selects a fraction of participants (0.6 of full participants as default) to upload model weights at each communication round. It also uses FedAvg for the model update. FedAtt¬† proposes a layer-based attention calculation to quantify the contribution of each participant. It then uses attentive weight aggregating to update the global model at each communication round.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: information (e.g. images or videos) while capturing temporal dependencies in the data. ConvLSTM reports an excellent and consistent performance in capturing spatial-temporal correlations.\n Bi-LSTM¬†[ref]5 also has a RNN-based architecture. It consists of two LSTM layers, one of which processes the input sequence in a forward direction and another that processes it in a backward direction.
