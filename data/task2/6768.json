      "content": "Paper Title: Object Goal Navigation with Recursive Implicit Maps\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe propose an implicit map representation to encode episodic navigation history into a compact spatial memory. This implicit map is recursively updated and used to predict actions for object goal navigation.\nFigure 2 (left) illustrates an overview of the model and its three modules: observation encoding, implicit map updating and action prediction. Observation Encoding.\nWe encode the observation into a feature vector otsubscript𝑜𝑡o_{t} at each step, including RGB image Itrsubscriptsuperscript𝐼𝑟𝑡I^{r}_{t}, depth image Itdsubscriptsuperscript𝐼𝑑𝑡I^{d}_{t}, agent’s pose (xt,yt,θt)subscript𝑥𝑡subscript𝑦𝑡subscript𝜃𝑡(x_{t},y_{t},\\theta_{t}), previous action at−1subscript𝑎𝑡1a_{t-1} and target object category c𝑐c.\nTo be specific, we use a pretrained CLIP Resnet50  to encode Itrsubscriptsuperscript𝐼𝑟𝑡I^{r}_{t} and Resnet50 pretrained in PointNav  to encode Itdsubscriptsuperscript𝐼𝑑𝑡I^{d}_{t}.\nThe visual encoders stay frozen as in  to make the training more efficient and enable generalization to unseen environments. The agent’s pose is converted to a feature (xt,yt,s​i​n​θt,c​o​s​θt)subscript𝑥𝑡subscript𝑦𝑡𝑠𝑖𝑛subscript𝜃𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑠subscript𝜃𝑡(x_{t},y_{t},sin\\theta_{t},cos\\theta_{t}).\nThe visual and pose features are then passed through their own linear layer.\nThe at−1subscript𝑎𝑡1a_{t-1} and c𝑐c are embedded through two learnable look-up tables [ref]5 respectively.\nWe concatenate all the features and add a sinusoidal positional embedding  of the current step t𝑡t to obtain the final observation feature otsubscript𝑜𝑡o_{t}. Implicit Map Representation and Updating.\nWe represent the navigation history until step t𝑡t as an implicit spatial map Mt=[mi​jt]h×wsuperscript𝑀𝑡subscriptdelimited-[]subscriptsuperscript𝑚𝑡𝑖𝑗ℎ𝑤M^{t}=[m^{t}_{ij}]_{h\\times w} with h×wℎ𝑤h\\times w cells.\nEach cell (i,j)𝑖𝑗(i,j) consists of a latent feature mi​jt∈ℝdsubscriptsuperscript𝑚𝑡𝑖𝑗superscriptℝ𝑑m^{t}_{ij}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} where d𝑑d is the feature dimensionality and its position is computed relatively to the center of the map as (i−h2,j−w2)𝑖ℎ2𝑗𝑤2(i-\\frac{h}{2},j-\\frac{w}{2}).\nAt the beginning of an episode, we initialize M0superscript𝑀0M^{0} using the cell position: where wm0∈ℝdsubscriptsuperscript𝑤0𝑚superscriptℝ𝑑w^{0}_{m}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} is a learnable embedding and FFN is a feed-forward network.\nThen, at each step t𝑡t, the implicit map is updated given the new observation otsubscript𝑜𝑡o_{t} with a differentiable function. Here we employ a multi-layer transformer  due to its effectiveness in many computer vision and robotics tasks [ref]15 2  .\nWe concatenate all the map cells and the encoded observation as tokens to feed in the transformer.\nThe core of the transformer layer is the self-attention block to compute relations among different tokens: where X=[m11t−1,⋯,mh​wt−1,ot]𝑋subscriptsuperscript𝑚𝑡111⋯subscriptsuperscript𝑚𝑡1ℎ𝑤subscript𝑜𝑡X=[m^{t-1}_{11},\\cdots,m^{t-1}_{hw},o_{t}].\nTo enhance the geometry alignment between our implicit map and the observation, we explicitly add the corresponding position feature to the map and observation token embeddings inside the Softmax function of self-attention.\nWe denote the output embeddings as Mtsuperscript𝑀𝑡M^{t} and o^tsubscript^𝑜𝑡\\hat{o}_{t} for the map tokens and observation token respectively.\nThe Mtsuperscript𝑀𝑡M^{t} is used as the input for the next step.\nCompared to explicit map representations  9 , the construction of our implicit map does not require precise localization and sensors since it learns how to update the map based on visual and geometric features.\nCompared to existing implicit representations [ref]5 1, our implicit map is geometry-aware and more compact. Action Prediction.\nDuring the update of the implicit map, the observation token otsubscript𝑜𝑡o_{t} is also updated through the transformer layer into o^tsubscript^𝑜𝑡\\hat{o}_{t}.\nWe then directly employ o^tsubscript^𝑜𝑡\\hat{o}_{t} to predict the low-level action p​(at)=Softmax​(FFN​(o^t))𝑝subscript𝑎𝑡SoftmaxFFNsubscript^𝑜𝑡p(a_{t})=\\text{Softmax}(\\text{FFN}(\\hat{o}_{t})) where FFN is a single-layer feed-forward network.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: visual and pose features are then passed through their own linear layer.\nThe at−1subscript𝑎𝑡1a_{t-1} and c𝑐c are embedded through two learnable look-up tables [ref]5 respectively.\nWe concatenate all the features and add a sinusoidal positional embedding  of the current step t𝑡t to obtain the final observation feature otsubscript𝑜𝑡o_{t}.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
