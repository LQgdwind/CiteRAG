      "content": "Paper Title: Mitigating Task Interference in Multi-Task Learning via Explicit Task Routing with Non-Learnable Primitives\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMulti-task learning (MTL) is commonly employed to improve learning efficiency and performance of multiple tasks by using supervised signals from other related tasks   . These models have led to impressive results across numerous tasks. However, there is well-documented evidence [ref]18 8   that these models are suffering from task interference , thereby limiting multi-task networks (MTNs) from realizing their full potential. For instance, consider the learning progression of an MTN with a standard learnable convolutional layer in Figure 1(a) (blue curve). Observe that the model learns rapidly, we posit, by exploiting all the shared information between the tasks, i.e., gradients pointing in similar directions. However, the performance starts degrading on further training since the model needs to exploit dissimilar information between the tasks for further improvement, i.e., gradients point in different directions. The latter can be verified by observing the similarity (centered kernel alignment ), or the lack thereof, between the gradients for each pair of tasks in Figure 1(b). Several approaches were proposed for mitigating task interference in MTNs, including loss/gradient balancing     , parameter partitioning [ref]37  8  and architectural design  [ref]18 9. Despite the diversity of these approaches, they share two common characteristics, (i) all parameters are learned, either for a pre-trained task or for the multiple tasks at hand, (ii) the learned parameters are either fully shared across all tasks or are shared across a partial set of tasks through implicit partitioning, i.e., with no direct control over which parameters are shared across which tasks. Both of these features limit the flexibility of existing multi-task network designs from mitigating the deleterious effects of task interference on their predictive performance. Relaxing the above design choices is the primary goal of this paper. We propose two complementary design principles, namely explicit task routing (ETR), and non-learnable primitives (NLPs), that explicitly seek to mitigate task interference. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that these two complementary ideas, individually and jointly, help mitigate task interference and consistently improve the performance of MTNs. As can be observed in Figure 1(a), compared to a hard-sharing MTN with a standard learnable convolutional layer (gray curve), an MTN with NLP (blue curve) has better learning characteristics, i.e., learn more steadily and not suffer from performance degradation. Similarly, MTN with ETR (green curve) and MTN with ETR-NLP (red curve) does not eliminate task interference but reduce it to an extent. Figure 2 shows an overview of the proposed ETR-NLP networks. From a network topological perspective, we propose explicit task-routing (ETR), a parameter allocation strategy that partitions the parameters into shared and task-specific branches. More explicitly, it comprises one branch shared across all tasks and task-specific branches, one for each task. Unlike existing parameter partitioning methods, ETR is designed to offer precise and fine-grained control over which and how many parameters are shared or not shared across the tasks. Additionally, ETR is flexible enough to allow existing implicit parameter partitioning methods [ref]37  to be incorporated into its shared branch. From a layer design perspective, we propose using non-learnable primitives (NLPs) to extract task-agnostic features and allow each task to choose optimal combinations of these features adaptively. There is growing evidence that features extracted from NLPs can be very effective for single-task settings, including for image classification     , reinforcement learning  and modeling dynamical systems 7. NLPs are attractive for mitigating task interference in MTL. Since they do not contain learnable parameters, the task-agnostic features extracted from such layers alleviate the impact of conflicting gradients, thus implicitly addressing task interference. However, the utility and design of NLPs for multi-task networks have not been explored. We summarize our key contributions below: – We introduce the concept of non-learnable primitives (NLPs) and explicit task routing (ETR) to mitigate task interference in multi-task learning. We systematically study the effect of different design choices to determine the optimal design of ETR and NLP. – We demonstrate the effectiveness of ETR and NLP through MTNs constructed with only NLPs (MTN-NLPs) and only ETR (MTN-ETR) for both image-level classification and pixel-level dense prediction tasks. – We evaluate the effectiveness of ETR-NLP networks across three different datasets and compare them against a wide range of baselines for both image-level classification and pixel-level dense prediction tasks. Results indicate that ETR-NLP networks consistently improve performance by a significant amount.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: performance of multiple tasks by using supervised signals from other related tasks   .
