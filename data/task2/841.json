      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Competitive Self-Play Policy Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement learning (RL) from self-play has drawn tremendous attention over the past few years. Empirical successes have been observed in several challenging tasks, including Go   , simulated hide-and-seek [ref]4, simulated sumo wrestling , Capture the Flag [ref]6, Dota 2 , StarCraft II , and poker [ref]9, to name a few. During RL from self-play, the learner collects training data by competing with an opponent selected from its past self or an agent population. Self-play presumably creates an auto-curriculum for the agents to learn at their own pace. At each iteration, the learner always faces an opponent that is comparably in strength to itself, allowing continuous improvement. The way the opponents are selected often follows human-designed heuristic rules in prior works. For example, AlphaGo  always competes with the latest agent, while the later generation AlphaGo Zero  and AlphaZero  generate self-play data with the maintained best historical agent. In specific tasks, such as OpenAI’s sumo wrestling environment, competing against a randomly chosen historical agent leads to the emergence of more diverse behaviors  and more stable training than against the latest agent 0. In population-based training [ref]6 1 and AlphaStar , an elite or random agent is picked from the agent population as the opponent. Unfortunately, these rules may be inefficient and sometimes ineffective in practice and do not necessarily enjoy convergence guarantee to the “average-case optimal” solution even in tabular matrix games. In fact, in the simple Matching Pennies game, self-play with the latest agent fails to converge and falls into an oscillating behavior, as shown in Sec. 5. In this paper, we want to develop an algorithm that adopts a principally-derived opponent-selection rule to alleviate some of the issues mentioned above. This requires clarifying first what the solution of self-play RL should be. From the game-theoretical perspective, Nash equilibrium is a fundamental solution concept that characterizes the desired “average-case optimal” strategies (policies). When each player assumes other players also play their equilibrium strategies, no one in the game can gain more by unilaterally deviating to another strategy. Nash, in his seminal work 2, has established the existence result of mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium of any finite game. Thus solving for a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium is a reasonable goal of self-play RL. We consider the particular case of two-player zero-sum games, a reasonable model for the competitive environments studied in the self-play RL literature. In this case, the Nash equilibrium is the same as the (global) saddle point and as the solution of the minimax program minx∈X⁡maxy∈Y⁡f​(x,y)subscript𝑥𝑋subscript𝑦𝑌𝑓𝑥𝑦\\min_{x\\in X}\\max_{y\\in Y}f(x,y). We denote x,y𝑥𝑦x,y as the strategy profiles (in RL language, policies) and f𝑓f as the loss for x𝑥x or utility/reward for y𝑦y. A saddle point (x∗,y∗)∈X×Ysuperscript𝑥superscript𝑦𝑋𝑌(x^{*},y^{*})\\in X\\times Y, where X,Y𝑋𝑌X,Y are the sets of all possible mixed-strategies (stochastic policies) of the two players, satisfies the following key property Connections to the saddle point problem and game theory inspire us to borrow ideas from the abundant literature for finding saddle points in the optimization field 3 4 5 6 and for finding equilibrium in the game theory field 7 8 9. One particular class of method, i.e., the perturbation-based subgradient methods to find the saddles 4 5, is especially appealing. This class of method directly builds upon the inequality properties in Eq. 1, and has several advantages:\n(1) Unlike some algorithms that require knowledge of the game dynamic   0, it requires only subgradients; thus, it is easy to adapt to policy optimization with estimated policy gradients.\n(2) It is guaranteed to converge in its last iterate instead of an average iterate, hence alleviates the need to compute any historical averages as in 8 9 7, which can get complicated when neural nets are involved 1.\n(3) Most importantly, it prescribes a simple principled way to adversarially choose opponents, which can be naturally implemented with a concurrently-trained agent population. To summarize, we adapt the perturbation-based methods of classical saddle point optimization into the model-free self-play RL regime. This results in a novel population-based policy gradient method for competitive self-play RL described in Sec. 3. Analogous to the standard model-free RL setting, we assume only “naive” players 2 where the game dynamic is hidden and only rewards for their own actions are revealed. This enables broader applicability than many existing algorithms   0 to problems with mismatched or unknown game dynamics, such as many real-world or simulated robotic problems. In Sec. 4, we provide an approximate convergence theorem of the proposed algorithm for convex-concave games as a sanity check. Sec. 5 shows extensive experiment results favoring our algorithm’s effectiveness on several games, including matrix games, a game of grid-world soccer, a board game, and a challenging simulated robot sumo game. Our method demonstrates better per-agent sample efficiency than baseline methods with alternative opponent-selection rules. Our trained agents can also outperform the agents trained by other methods on average.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: learning (RL) from self-play has drawn tremendous attention over the past few years.
