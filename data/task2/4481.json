      "content": "Paper Title: Many-to-One Knowledge Distillation of Real-Time Epileptic Seizure Detection for Low-Power Wearable Internet of Things Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA key challenge for low-energy embedded medical platforms with limited computational resources is designing and implementing an epileptic seizure detection algorithm based on DNNs for long-term patient monitoring. For instance, the e-Glass wearable system  shown in Fig. 6 contains a 570 mAh battery and features an ultra-low-power 32-bit microcontroller STM32L151 [ref]62 with an ARM® Cortex®-M3 with 48 KB RAM and 384 KB Flash. In the case of an epileptic seizure, e-Glass communicates with a smartphone or smartwatch using Bluetooth low energy (nRF8001) [ref]63 and sends a warning to the caregivers. In this paper, to analyze the complexity, lifetime, and energy efficiency of our approach, we consider the Kendryte K210 and Raspberry Pi Zero platforms.\nIn the implementation code, all the computations and storage are in 16-bit fixed-point. We chose 13 bits for the fractional part using the results of the validation set. We observed that dedicating more bits to the fractional part causes overflows in the computations. On the other hand, reducing the number of fraction bits gives rise to a considerable accuracy drop. Since we use the fixed-point representation of numbers, we save the amount of storage by a factor of 4 compared to 64-bit floating-point operations. This compression is crucial because it enables our network to be applicable on various memory-limited embedded devices. However, the total accuracy of the model is reduced by 0.9% because of the quantization in 16-bit. Table III shows the seizure detection execution time per 3-second segment for each DNN. The represented numbers are obtained by running the experiments for the whole test set, including 1568 segments of 3-second segments. We observe that due to fewer parameters, the proposed knowledge distillation network, which requires only the ECG signal, runs 2.9 times faster than the multi-modal Res1DCNN on the Raspberry Pi Zero. At the same time, the proposed network achieves a detection performance comparable to multi-modal Res1DCNN (see Fig. 8). In addition to the reduced memory and computational burden, the most relevant advantage of the proposed distilled version is that it avoids the acquisition and process of EEG data. We also observe that the network’s end-to-end response time for a 3-second segment is only 720 milliseconds on the Raspberry Pi Zero and 1,040 milliseconds on the Kendryte K210; thus, we can continuously monitor the patients in real-time. Epilepsy is characterized by unpredictable seizures and can cause other health problems; thus, the patients have to be monitored on a long-term basis. Table IV evaluates the battery lifetime of our proposed distilled network using the battery of the e-Glass , which is 570 mAh. We observe that our proposed knowledge distillation model operates for 7.86 hours on the Raspberry Pi Zero and 16.29 hours on the Kendryte K210 on a single charge to perform real-time epileptic seizure detection. The proposed distilled network achieves a 37.65% energy reduction sacrificing just 1.5% of the accuracy. The battery life is measured considering the real-time energy consumption shown in Fig. 10 and  10. We observe that the Raspberry Pi Zero executes the inference of the 3-seconds segment in 720 ms, then goes to idle mode and waits for the next 3-seconds segment. As Fig. 10 shows, the Raspberry Pi Zero consumes a considerable amount of energy in idle mode. Therefore, as shown in Fig.  10 we considered other wearable platforms such as the Kendryte K210 that consume less power in idle mode which would be very beneficial for the patients to perform long-term monitoring. We can improve the battery life of the edge device by using the PULP-based ultra-low-power wearable platform proposed in , which consumes only 0.76 mA when the system is clock gated with respect to 23.58 mA when the system is running at 110 MHz, at the lowest energy point of the platform 0.8 V. In this scenario, assuming that the inference time will be similar for the PULP after parallelization , we can achieve a battery life of 91.33 hours with the same battery capacity.\n\nReference markers found: [62]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]62: based on DNNs for long-term patient monitoring.
