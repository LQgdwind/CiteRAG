      "content": "Paper Title: A Flexible Template for Edge Generative AI with High-Accuracy Accelerated Softmax & GELU\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExponentiation is historically a critical operation in neural networks, particularly in activation functions like softmax, where computational efficiency is crucial for real-time or large-scale applications. To address the high cost of precise exponentiation, several approximate algorithms have been developed. A very fast approximation commonly used in software implementations targeting high feed-forward speed is Schraudolph’s method [ref]27, which exploits the structure of floating point numbers to estimate the exponential with only a multiplication and an addition. This efficiency comes at the expense of accuracy, which Malossi et al.  have addressed through a precision-adjustable polynomial correction of the mantissa. However, this refinement introduces additional floating-point operations, increasing computational overhead proportionally to the degree of the used polynomial. In hardware accelerators, particularly those designed for fixed-point arithmetic and targeting low precision, it is a common practice to approximate the exponential function using lookup tables (LUTs)   .\nSun et al.  proposed a method that partitions the input into multiple components, computes their exponentials individually via LUTs, and then multiplies them to approximate the overall exponential.\nGao et al.  reduced the reliance on LUTs by introducing an approach where LUTs are used for the high-order bits only, while a Taylor series expansion refines the computation for the least significant bits.\nZhu et el. , used LUTs to store the coefficients of a piecewise linear fitting of exp\\exp rather than its values. Compared to Malossi et al. the method we propose is more efficient, as it applies the correction on the output mantissa only, enabling its calculation entirely in integer arithmetic. Moreover, compared to methods relying on LUTs, our approach is more hardware-friendly as it does not require storing any precomputed value in advance.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: exponentiation, several approximate algorithms have been developed.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
