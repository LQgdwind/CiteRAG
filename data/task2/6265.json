      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial Attack Based on Prediction-Correction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in numerous areas   . However, recent studies have demonstrated that almost all DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples  6   1 1, which are indistinguishable from original examples but can misguide the DNNs to produce incorrect outputs [ref]16   7. The existence of adversarial examples brings many potential security risks to security-sensitive applications, such as face recognition 4 and self-driving automobile . Therefore, the research of adversarial attack is of great significance for enhancing the security and interpretability of DNNs. Recently, a variety of adversarial attacks have been proposed 1. Most of the existing adversarial attacks generally fall into the category of white-box attacks, in which the adversary can access all of the information about the target model. As for black-box attacks, the adversary does not know the information of the target model, and sometimes cannot even access the output of the model 4. Moreover, it is worth noting that the adversarial examples obtained by white-box attacks present cross-model transferability, that is, the adversarial examples crafted for a given model can still fool another model with a high probability 6, . This property makes it possible to attack DNNs without knowing any information about the models . According to the way that adversarial examples are generated, the existing attacks can also be divided into three categories, namely, gradient-based attack [ref]16, optimization-based attack 1 , and generative adversarial networks-based attack 7. Among these methods, the gradient-based attack has attracted more and more attention because of its lower computational cost and better performance 6 1  3. It is well known that gradient-based attacks utilize the gradients of the loss function with respect to the input example to calculate the adversarial perturbation. In our opinion, there exists some similarity between the gradient-based attacks and the numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equation (ODE). The basic philosophy of the numerical methods is to solve the approximate value of the exact solution through a given initial value and differential coefficients  . To be brief, the process of generating adversarial examples in gradient-based attacks can be regarded as the process of solving approximate solutions in the ODE, since they both utilize the gradients (or derivatives) to obtain adversarial examples (or approximate solutions). That is to say, if we regard the gradients in adversarial attacks as the derivatives in the ODE, then the generated adversarial examples can be viewed as the approximate solutions obtained by numerical methods for solving ODE. So far, although the numerical methods for solving ODE have been widely applied in the field of engineering calculation, there is no research on the relationship between the numerical methods and adversarial attacks, let alone its potential application in the adversarial attacks. In this paper, we make the first attempt in this direction. The close relationship between gradient-based attacks and numerical methods for solving ODE is revealed firstly, and then we propose a series of new prediction-correction (PC) based attacks. In our proposed PC-based attacks, some existing attack is selected to produce a predicted example first, and then the predicted example and the current example are combined together to determine the added perturbations. The main idea of PC-based attacks is to correct the adversarial perturbation through gradient prediction, which is different from the existing attacks that only utilize information from the present and past gradients [ref]16 1  3 5 0 . Compared with the existing gradient-based attacks, our proposed PC-based attacks can achieve higher attack success rates in general.\nThe main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. We first reveal the relationship between the gradient-based attacks and the numerical methods for solving ODE, and establish a close connection between the numerical method and the adversarial attack. A series of new PC-based attacks are proposed in this paper, which can achieve higher attack success rates and significantly improve the transferability. Our proposed prediction-correction strategy possesses good extensibility and can be easily applied to almost all available gradient-based adversarial attacks.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: have demonstrated that almost all DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples  6   1 1, which are indistinguishable from original examples but can misguide the DNNs to produce incorrect outputs [ref]16   7.
