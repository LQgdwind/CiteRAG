      "content": "Paper Title: Modular probabilistic programming with algebraic effects (2019)\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProbabilistic programming languages support random sampling of variables, as well as the conditioning of programs as a function of both observed data and the sampled values of the random variables . The goal of writing probabilistic programs is to perform inference over the probabilistic program in order to obtain the posterior distribution, p‚Äã(Œ∏|D)ùëùconditionalùúÉùê∑p(\\theta|D), specified by the program. The posterior distribution is a probability distribution over parameters Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta, conditioned on observed data Dùê∑D. Using programs to represent probabilistic models was conceived as an idea in 1978  and programming languages for Bayesian modelling and inference have existed since at least 1994 . Probabilistic programming languages have been used for various tasks from reasoning about theory of mind, to matching players who have similar skill levels on Xbox  http://forestdb.org/. There are two distinct kinds of probabilistic programming languages, both of which span a wide spectra of use cases222http://probabilistic-programming.org/wiki/Home: Languages such as ProbLog 2  perform inference over logic programs, often called worlds, and concern themselves with computing the probability of a truth-related query about the world, given evidence or data. Languages such as Edward [ref]4 or Tabular , infer, given data, the probability distribution of parameters that generated the given data. Probabilistic programming aims to internalize general purpose inference mechanisms inside the compiler in order to allow the programmers to focus on writing models and have inference automatically done for them . This specific goal has motivated the construction of many languages such as Gen . However, Ackermann & Freer  show that, in general, computing continuous conditional probability distributions ‚Äì such as the posterior ‚Äì cannot be automated, as the halting problem can be reduced to the computation .\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: inference over logic programs, often called worlds, and concern themselves with computing the probability of a truth-related query about the world, given evidence or data.

Probabilistic programming aims to internalize general purpose inference mechanisms\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
