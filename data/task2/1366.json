      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Golf Ball Detection and Tracking Based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Kalman Filter\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe detection models we chose in this study are Faster R-CNN [ref]24, YOLOv3 and its light version [ref]23, YOLOv4 , SSD 8 and RefineDet . Among these models, YOLOv3 [ref]23, YOLOv4 , SSD 8, and RefineDet  are considered as representatives of the one-stage object detection models, while Faster R-CNN [ref]24 is a classical two-stage object detector. Object detection is to determine the location of the objects in the images or videos and simultaneously classify those objects in the image or videos. YOLOv3 [ref]23 predicts bounding boxes using pre-defined boxes with dimension clusters. YOLOv3 predicts multiple bounding boxes per grid cell. The prediction is based on the highest IoU between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box. Non-maximum suppression was applied when multiple bounding boxes appear in the image. The confidence score for the occurrence of the object in each bounding box is predicted using logistic regression. Inspired by the image pyramid, YOLOv3 adds several convolutional layers after the base feature extractor to make predictions at three different scales. Features are extracted from these three scales. YOLOv3 also adds a cross-layer connection between two prediction layers (except the output layer) and earlier finer-grained feature maps. YOLOv3 first up-samples the deep feature maps and then merges it with the previous features by concatenation to better detect small objects.\nYOLOv3 provides high accuracy with relatively fast speed. YOLOv3 tiny is a simplified version of YOLOv3. It reduced the number of convolutional layers to 7 and utilized 1×1111\\times 1 and 3×3333\\times 3 convolutional layers with fewer parameters. YOLOv3 tiny also utilized a pooling layer to achieve feature map size reduction, while YOLOv3 employed the convolutional layer with a step size of 2. YOLOv4  focuses on a bag of freebies which only changes the training process that might increase the training cost to enhance the performance of the detector without additional cost in inference time and the bag of specials that increases the accuracy of the detector with only a little increase of the inference time by post-processing. The backbone of YOLOv4 is CSPDarknet53  which is an enhanced version of DarkNet53 used in YOLOv3. To increase the receptive field, YOLOv4 utilizes SPP  over the backbone network. In addition, instead of employing FPN 4 to merge feature maps with different scales in YOLOv3, YOLOv4 exploits PANet 7 to combine different network levels. The detector head of YOLOv4 is still the same as YOLOv3. There are many other bag of freebies and bag of specials utilized in YOLOv4 to improve the performance of the detector. Some of them would increase little inference cost but improve the performance significantly . Faster R-CNN[ref]24 is built on top of two networks, region proposal network (RPN) and detection network. RPN is responsible for generating candidate proposals from a series of densely sampled anchors with different sizes and ratios in each location on the feature maps. By default, there are 3 scales and 3 aspect ratios totally 9 anchors at each feature map location. The output of the RPN is a bunch of rectangular proposals that may contain some objects in the image and associate with objectness scores. The proposals will later be processed by the classifiers to verify the occurrence of the objects and the regressors to further refine the bounding boxes of the region proposals. To be more accurate, The function of RPN is to judge if the anchors contain some objects and refine the anchor boxes if they contain some objects. Then the region proposals with a high possibility to be foreground will be sent to the detection network to do the classification and bounding box regression. For detection network, Fast R-CNN  is adopted. ROI pooling is leveraged to the region proposals that may contain some objects and then two branches are adopted, one branch is for refining the bounding boxes of the region proposals, and the other is to classify the objects that may be contained in the region proposals.\nTo make this network fast and accurate, RPN shares the full-image convolutional features of all region proposals and by ROI pooling, the features of region proposals can be fixed and easily fed into the detection network. Due to the introduction of RPN, most background proposals are removed and only those proposals with high possibility containing some objects are fed into the detection network, thus the accuracy of Faster R-CNN is often better than that of one-stage object detectors which directly refines and classifies the dense anchors without selecting them. In the experiment, VGG-16  is selected as the backbone network for Faster R-CNN. SSD 8 is abbreviated for Single Shot Multibox Detector which is a one-stage multiple-scale approach. SSD was utilized VGG-16  as the backbone network. However, SSD 8 exploits feature maps with various scales to detect objects with different shapes and sizes. Although SSD achieved great performance on large objects, it shows drawbacks in detecting small objects. Lower level feature maps may contain more details while less semantic information, while deep feature maps may have more semantic information but fewer details. To better detect small objects such as golf balls, we have to extract and highlight the feature at a lower level of feature maps. Nonetheless, lacking enough semantic information in those shallower feature maps may prevent us from achieving good detection results for small objects. Similar to SSD 8, RefineDet  also utilizes pre-defined bounding boxes on multi-scale feature maps and objectness scores associating with those boxes to do the object detection. This network mainly consists of three modules: ARM, ODM, and TCB. ARM provides better initialization for regressors and can be treated as RPN in Faster R-CNN [ref]24. ODM whose function is to detect the objects performs as one-stage multiple-scale detector SSD 8. TCB which is similar to the upsampling process in FPN 4 connects ARM and ODM by combining the deep feature maps with the shallow feature maps via deconvolution. TCB serves as a bridge between ARM and ODM and it takes the feature maps associated with anchors and the transferred higher-level feature maps to increase detection accuracy. TCB just deconvolves higher-level feature maps to match the size and dimension of the current feature maps and then simply add the current feature map and the higher-level feature maps element-wise. Thus deep feature maps with more semantic information and shallow feature maps with more details can be combined together to enhance the performance of the detector. Although it has two steps just like the two-stage object detectors, RefineDet is a one-stage detector since it closely combines the two steps without the process in two-stage detectors, such as RoIPooling. In addition, RefineDet utilizes VGG-16  as the backbone which is the same as Faster R-CNN [ref]24 and SSD 8. Employing more advanced networks as the backbone may boost the performance, but for convenience, VGG-16 was harnessed in our experiment.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: The detection models we chose in this study are Faster R-CNN [ref]24, YOLOv3 and its light version [ref]23, YOLOv4 , SSD 8 and RefineDet .
