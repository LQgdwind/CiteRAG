      "content": "Paper Title: Masked Autoencoding for Scalable and Generalizable Decision Making\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe adopt the environment setup used in EXoRL , based on DeepMind control suite , where a domain describes the type of agent (e.g. Walker) but tasks are specified by rewards (e.g., Walker walk, Walker run). We use 3 domains (Walker, Cheetah and Quadruped) with 7 tasks in total. More details about the environments can be found in the Appendix. Real-world pretraining data generally varies greatly in quality. To mimic this, we construct two different pretraining datasets to approximate different data quality scenarios. Near-expert: For every task, we train a TD3 agent  for 1M steps and freeze its parameters. We rollout the policy with Gaussian random noise and collect 4M experience on each task. Mixed: This dataset consists of diverse data collected from various agents, including 2K near-expert trajectories for each task. Similar to ExoRL , we collect 10M exploratory trajectories using intrinsic reward from Proto-RL [ref]37 for each domain. We also to use a TD3  agent to maximize the sum of extrinsic reward and the Proto-RL intrinsic reward, and store its 2M experience on each task. For more details about the above datasets and more ablations on the dataset quality, please refer to Section A and Section B.1 respectively. We perform both single-task and multi-task pretraining using the above datasets. The former leverages task-specific data while the latter utilizes data from all tasks within the same domain.\nWe pretrain agents for 400K gradient steps. Specifically, for the model pretrained on the near-expert dataset, we perform zero-shot222We directly evaluate the model on some unseen state-goal pairs in the validation dataset evaluation of goal reaching and skill prompting, and finetuning for offline RL; for model trained on the mixed dataset, we provide the finetuning results in Section 9 and Section A. GPT. We train an autoregressive model similar to GPT [ref]4 which takes the past states and actions as input to predict the next state or action. Goal-GPT. We specifically modify GPT to Goal-GPT to evaluate its performance on goal reaching tasks. The model takes current goal and observations as input, and predicts the action to reach this goal. The model is trained using a behaviour cloning loss as . Goal-MLP. Standard behavior cloning method that conditions on the goal. The major difference between this and Goal-GPT is here we do not use the causal Transformer architecture to make the history visible. By default, MaskDP uses a 3-layer encoder and 2-layer decoder, and the baselines based on GPT use 5 attention layers. MaskDP and all the above models are comparable with similar architecture design and size, and share the same training hyper-parameters. Details about the architecture and training of MaskDP and the above baselines can be found in Section A.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: of diverse data collected from various agents, including 2K near-expert trajectories for each task.
