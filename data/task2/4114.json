      "content": "Paper Title: Model-based Offline Imitation Learning with Non-expert Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImitation Learning(IL) refers to the setting where a policy does not have access to the ground truth reward function but instead has expert demonstrations. It has shown to be an efficient approach to policy optimization that has been extensively tested on real world applications . Most previous works on IL focuses on settings where it has limited access to expert demonstrations, where the general strategies include i) BC  when no environment interactions are allowed ii) Interactive IL with an expert iii) Adversarial IL  [ref]4, by minimizing some form of divergence between the expert and learner’s state action distribution. In this paper, we consider an entirely offline setting as in i).\n\n\nIn many practical real world cases, we make the realistic assumption that the set of logged datasets is pyramidal: there are an enormous number of bad trajectories, many mediocre trajectories, a few good trajectories, etc. It follows that when imitation learning algorithms only make usage of the optimal trajectories, it disregards the information stored in the suboptimal trajectories. How best is it then, to utilise those suboptimal trajectories? While there were some works that attempts to learn from suboptimal demonstrations [ref]3  , there were limited works that focuses on the complete offline setting.\n\n\nAs in i), offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a setting where the agent only has access to a fixed dataset of experience, and where interactions with the environment are not permitted. It is a setting of great interest when considering applications where deploying suboptimal policies might be costly, for example in healthcare and self-driving. Although it is fair to assume that such settings has accumulated a vast amount of behavior dataset over the years, be it optimal or suboptimal, offline RL entails the additional assumption of the availability of a reward function, or that such experiences are labeled with rewards. Here, we consider a slightly different setting, where we replace the necessity of reward labels with that of a modest amount of expert demonstrations. That is, the setting where the behavior dataset does not include any reward labels, but instead is composed of both suboptimal and (a lot less)optimal trajectories. Our motivations are akin to that of inverse RL  [ref]4, and we consider its offline analogue where reward functions are difficult to engineer but it is relatively easier to provide expert demonstrations instead.\n\n\nWe also formulate connections with imitation learning and offline RL and present an imitation learning algorithm where, by utilising suboptimal demonstrations, its performance is less dependent on the amount of optimal demonstrations. We approach this problem by utilising a learned model trained on the behavior dataset. Previously, imitation learning with offline model estimation has not been studied thoroughly, as in the infinite state action space regime, a model trained with limited and narrow coverage datasets, such as those that are exclusively comprised of expert demonstrations, is almost guaranteed empirically to be too incorrect for reliable usage [ref]18. We then argue that, if we cannot do substantially better with respect to the algorithm, why don’t we change the setting itself? Namely, we change it to the one presented in the paragraph above, and utilise suboptimal data that is potentially idle. From this stems our motivation; in such instances, can we statistically and empirically demonstrate that, by solely interacting with an estimated transition from such idle data, that we can do better than BC?\n\n\nUnder whats hopefully a promising setting, our primary contribution is a general algorithmic framework for offline imitation where a policy is trained adversarially with a discriminator in an estimated model, which is trained a priori. We first demonstrate its statistical benefits over behavioral cloning, and its practical instantiation that outperforms BC on all our evaluations. Indeed, offline estimation and usage of a model comes with its own set of difficulties [ref]18 , as the model only has access to data with limited support and cannot improve its accuracy using additional experience. It is also well known that a policy optimizing in such a model could learn to exploit where it is inaccurate, which degrades the evaluated performance . We provide justifiable remedies that are motivated by recent works in model based offline RL[ref]18  , where our algorithm also estimates and penalizes model uncertainty.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: where it has limited access to expert demonstrations, where the general strategies include i) BC  when no environment interactions are allowed ii) Interactive IL with an expert iii) Adversarial IL  [ref]4, by minimizing some form of divergence between the expert and learner’s state action distribution.
