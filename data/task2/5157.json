      "content": "Paper Title: SGCE-Font: Skeleton Guided Channel Expansion for Chinese Font Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe generation of Chinese fonts has attracted amounts of attention in recent years due to its wide range of applications [ref]1  . With the development of deep learning, in particular the deep generative models such as the generative adversarial networks (GANs)  and variational auto-encoder (VAE) , the kind of deep generative model based methods has become the mainstream due to their impressive performance      . Existing deep generative models for Chinese font generation can be generally divided into two categories, that is, supervised models       [ref]17 and unsupervised models [ref]1    , where the kind of supervised models is mainly based on the paired data (i.e., there is a one-to-one correspondence between characters in the source and target font domains), and the kind of unsupervised models is mainly based on the unpaired data (without requiring a one-to-one correspondence between the source and target font domains). In the early work  of supervised models, the authors suggested an auto-encoder guided GAN model for the Chinese calligraphy synthesis based on the paired data, regarding the Chinese font generation problem as an image-to-image translation problem. Motivated by this perspective, many models have been developed for the Chinese font generation in recent years   [ref]17. In , the authors adopted the Pix2Pix model 0 to the generation of Chinese fonts. In , an effective GAN model dubbed CalliGAN was proposed for the Chinese font generation by exploiting certain component information of Chinese characters. The recent paper [ref]17 proposed a GAN-based image translation model for the synthesis of Chinese brush handwriting font by integrating the skeleton information in the expense of increasing model complexity of the deep neural networks. Despite the impressive performance of this kind of supervised models    [ref]17, the collection of a large amount of paired samples is generally overhead, and even unrealistic for some font generation problems like the generation of ancient calligraphy fonts 1 2. To tackle this issue, many unsupervised models based on unpaired data have been suggested in the literature 3 6 7 8. In the seminal work 3 of unsupervised models, the authors adopted the well-known CycleGAN model 9 to the generation of Chinese fonts based on the unpaired data. In 0, the authors proposed an effective model using graph matching for the calligraphy character generation. In 6, a structure-guided deep generative model dubbed SCFont was suggested for the generation of Chinese fonts,\nby integrating the domain knowledge of Chinese characters such as writing trajectory and skeleton into the generation. 8 proposed a novel deformable generative model called DG-Font for the generation of Chinese font based on unpaired data. Although the effectiveness of these unsupervised models has been demonstrated in the literature, the kind of unsupervised models (say, CycleGAN 3) usually suffer from the well-known mode collapse issue , which results in poor performance, mainly due to the lack of effective guidance information. As shown in the second row of Figure LABEL:fig:modecollapse, mode collapse happens for CycleGAN in three concerned generation tasks, and in this case, CycleGAN fails to yield the correct Chinese characters. To reduce the mode collapse, several effective Chinese font generation models have been recently suggested in the literature 5 4 through integrating certain kinds of component information of Chinese characters.\nIn 5, the authors incorporated the stroke information into CycleGAN to reduce the mode collapse (there dubbed StrokeGAN), where certain one-bit stroke encoding was introduced to represent the stroke information as shown in the second row of Figure 2. In 4, the authors proposed a square-block geometric transformation based self-supervised scheme for CycleGAN to capture certain spatial structure information of Chinese characters, inspired by the observation that character structures are closely related to these square-block transformations. As shown in the third row of Figure 2, these four square-block transformations were used in 4 to represent the single-component, left-right, up-bottom, and semi-encircling structures, respectively. It can be observed from the third and fourth rows of Figure LABEL:fig:modecollapse that both the one-bit stroke encoding and square-block transformations are generally insufficient to thoroughly address the mode collapse issue, since there are some Chinese characters with both the same one-bit stroke encodings and character structures as shown in Figure 2. Moreover, the guidance information used in both StrokeGAN 5 and SQ-GAN 4 was imposed on the discriminator, leading to certain implicit guidance during the generation. In this paper, we focus on developing the effective information guidance scheme for the Chinese font generation. In particular, we aim to answer the following two questions: What kind of guidance information is more effective for the Chinese font generation? How to use the guidance information more effectively for the Chinese font generation? For (Q1), we suggest using the skeletons of Chinese characters as the guidance information for the Chinese font generation, motivated by the observation that the skeleton can embody both local and global structure information of Chinese characters as well as their semantic information, as shown in Figure 2. From Figure 2, the stroke encodings used in StrokeGAN 5 and square-block transformations used in SQ-GAN 4 can only reflect either local or global structure information of Chinese characters and in particular cannot provide the sole representation of a Chinese character, while the skeleton can provide both local and global structure information as well as the sole representation of a Chinese character. Thus, the skeleton should be more effective than both the stroke encoding and square-block transformation for the Chinese font generation. For (Q2), we directly use the skeleton information as a part of input of the generator through a channel expansion way, instead of imposing it on the discriminator. Thus, the skeleton should provide more information and stronger guidance for the generator than existing implicit ways of imposing guidance information on the discriminator. The major contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: This paper proposes a novel information guidance module called the skeleton guided channel expansion (SGCE) for the Chinese font generation through integrating the skeleton information into the generator by a channel expansion way. The proposed module can provide both local and global structure information as the guidance information for the Chinese font generation while does not increase any additional model complexity. Thus, the proposed module can effectively alleviate the mode collapse and improve the quality of the generated Chinese characters, and can be used as a plug-and-play module for Chinese font generation models without increasing model complexity. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed module, in particular its superiority on reducing mode collapse and enhancing the generation performance. The outperformance of the proposed SGCE-Font model (i.e., equipping the proposed SGCE module into the known CycleGAN model) is also shown by numerous experiments under quantitative comparisons with the state-of-the-art models. Some generated characters of the proposed model are presented in Figure 3. It can be observed that the proposed model can generate very realistic Chinese characters over these ten concerned Chinese fonts. Besides CycleGAN, we also show that the proposed module can be easily adapted to other existing Chinese font generation models and further enhance their performance. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present some related work. In Section III, we describe the proposed module in detail. In Section IV, we provide amounts of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed module. We conclude this paper in the final section.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: The generation of Chinese fonts has attracted amounts of attention in recent years due to its wide range of applications [ref]1  .
