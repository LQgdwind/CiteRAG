      "content": "Paper Title: Sparsifiner: Learning Sparse Instance-Dependent Attention for Efficient Vision Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImplementation details — We train all of the models on the ImageNet dataset [ref]12.\nBy default, the connectivity mask predictor module is incorporated into every layer of DeiT-S [ref]34 and LV-ViT-S .\nIn all of our experiments, we set the reduced dimension ndownsubscript𝑛downn_{\\text{down}} to 323232 and τ𝜏\\tau to 0.050.050.05 which ensures 87% sparsity ratio of the basis coefficient.\nThe attention budget B𝐵B is in the range (0,number of tokens]0number of tokens(0,\\text{number of tokens}].\nBudget B𝐵B is directly determined by the attention keep rate in (0,1]01(0,1] as\nthe ceiling of the keep rate multiplied by the total number of tokens. We follow most of the training techniques used in DeiT-S and LV-ViT-S.\nWe use pre-trained ViT models to initialize the backbone models.\nTo improve speed of convergence, we propose a two-phase training strategy.\nIn the first phase, we freeze the backbone model and train the connectivity mask predictor module with attention distillation loss and L2 regularization only.\nSpecifically, we set λdistilltoken=0.0superscriptsubscript𝜆distilltoken0.0\\lambda_{\\text{distill}}^{\\text{token}}=0.0, λdistillcls=0.0superscriptsubscript𝜆distillcls0.0\\lambda_{\\text{distill}}^{\\text{cls}}=0.0, λdistillattn=1.0superscriptsubscript𝜆distillattn1.0\\lambda_{\\text{distill}}^{\\text{attn}}=1.0\nand we also apply a threshold 1e-2 on basis Wupsuperscript𝑊upW^{\\text{up}} to ensure 90% sparsity.\nWe found that this setting helps the connectivity mask predictor to learn Wupsuperscript𝑊upW^{\\text{up}} quickly and loss converges within 5 epochs.\nIn the second phase, we jointly train the backbone model and the connectivity mask predictor module for another 40 epochs.\nwe set λdistilltoken=0.5superscriptsubscript𝜆distilltoken0.5\\lambda_{\\text{distill}}^{\\text{token}}=0.5, λdistillcls=0.5superscriptsubscript𝜆distillcls0.5\\lambda_{\\text{distill}}^{\\text{cls}}=0.5, λdistillattn=0.0superscriptsubscript𝜆distillattn0.0\\lambda_{\\text{distill}}^{\\text{attn}}=0.0.\nMore details can be found in the supplementary material. Sparse connectivities and attention visualization — In order to\nqualitatively investigate the quality of Sparsifiner’s sparse attention approximation,\nwe visualize its connectivity mask and sparse reconstructed attention map\n(Fig. 3).\nWe show the original input image and the connectivity mask of the query patch,\nwhere the dark regions represent tokens that are not attended to by the query\npatch token.\nFor each attention head, Sparsifiner generates a corresponding connectivity mask.\nWe find that the connectivity mask acts as a region proposal mechanism, which\nallows different attention heads to locate different informative tokens and\ngather diverse semantic information.\nFurthermore, we visualize the sparse attention map efficiently generated using\nthe connectivity mask and compare it with the full attention map.\nWe find that the sparse attention map retains all of the highest connectivity\nvalues, while discarding lower connectivity values.\nHence the visualizations show that Sparsifiner retains the most salient\nrelations for a given token, while discarding noisy background relations. Comparison with token pruning —\nWe train and evaluate Sparsifiner on ImageNet and compare to state-of-the-art\ntoken pruning baselines (Tab. 1).\nSince our research question addresses the problem of reducing MHSA complexity,\nwe report trade-offs between top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and computation in\nterms of MHSA FLOPs.\nWe compare Sparsifiner against baselines by adjusting two hyperparameters:\ntoken and attention keep rate.\nThe token keep rate is the fraction of tokens kept in the network at\npredetermined layers where pruning occurs, which we set according to\nestablished token pruning baselines  .\nThe attention keep rate is the fraction of attention connectivities at any\ngiven MHSA layer, as determined by the connectivity mask predictor\n(Eq. 3).\nHence, varying the attention keep rate reduces FLOPs without necessitating\nremoval of tokens as in token pruning.\nBut both techniques can be combined to achieve complementary effects. To provide a variety of comparisons we experiment with adding token pruning and\nSparsifiner to two common baseline ViT models: DeiT [ref]34 and\nLV-ViT .\nOn both models, Sparsifiner achieves significant computation saving while\nmaintaining a relatively modest drop in top-1 accuracy.\nFor example, LV-ViT-S  trained with Sparsifiner with an attention keep rate\nof 0.250.250.25 reduces the MHSA FLOPs by 53.553.553.5% while maintaining the\ntop-1 accuracy of the baseline LV-ViT-S model on ImageNet.\nWhen used in combination with token pruning, Sparsifiner achieves an even\nsuperior reduction in MHSA FLOPs while maintaining comparable top-1\naccuracy to EViT, and superior top-1 accuracy to DynamicViT. Varying MHSA attention budget —\nWe varied the attention budget of MHSA in order to investigate the tradeoff\nbetween MHSA FLOPs and top-1 accuracy for Sparsifiner-S\n(Tab. 2).\nThe results evaluated on ImageNet show that Sparsifiner-S produces a superior\nPareto frontier compared with previous approaches\n(Fig. 4).\nIn particular, Sparsifiner-S models with attention budgets of 404040 and\nabove achieved top-1 accuracy within 0.10.10.1% of the full-rank DeiT-S [ref]34 model,\nwhile using 58.858.858.8% fewer FLOPs in MHSA.\nFurthermore, Sparsifiner-S models with high attention budgets of 797979 and\nabove achieved superior top-1 accuracy compared with the full-rank DeiT-S [ref]34\nmodel, while using fewer FLOPs in MHSA.\nThis suggests that Sparsifiner’s sparse full-rank attention reconstruction\nmechanism induces a useful regularization effect that improves model\ngeneralization. Accelerating ViT on high-resolution images — To show the effectiveness of our method on larger input size,\nwe apply our method to DeiT-T [ref]34 with 384×384384384384\\times 384 resolution (Tab. 3).\nWhen dealing with high-resolution images, due to quadratic complexity in the\nnumber of tokens, MHSA becomes increasingly expensive compared to the\nfeedforward operations.\nWe reduce the MHSA complexity of the DeiT-T [ref]34 model with 384×384384384384\\times 384 input by over 808080% with less than 111% accuracy drop.\nOur method shows a great potential to accelerate ViT on even higher resolution images where token quantity dominates the model complexity. Low-rank: connectivities or attention? — Our approach raises a\nresearch question: does the utility of the dense low-rank attention matrix come from\nits use as a connectivity mask?\nOr is it sufficient to directly use the dense low-rank attention matrix,\nforegoing the need to reconstruct the sparse full-rank attention matrix, i.e., the Linformer [ref]37 approach?\nWe answered this question by comparing the top-1 accuracy of the two approaches\n(Tab. 4).\nIn this experiment, Sparsifiner-S and Linformer [ref]37 were trained under identical\nsettings, differing only in the attention approximation method.\nSparsifiner-S uses a reconstructed sparse full-rank attention matrix, while\nLinformer uses the dense low-rank attention matrix directly.\nIn order to give both models similar representational capacity, we set the low-rank\ndimension of Linformer [ref]37 equal to the sparse attention budget of Sparsifiner-S.\nThis enforces that the attention-value product of both models’ MHSA has the same complexity. Using the sparse full-rank attention matrix produces a\n2.12.12.1% absolute percentage point improvement in top-1\naccuracy compared with Linformer.\nThis improvement reinforces the superiority of using the low-rank query-key product as a\nconnectivity mask, rather than using the low-rank attention matrix directly.\nUsing the low-rank attention matrix to directly compute the attention-value product with\na down-projected value discards the long tail of the full attention matrix’s\neigenspectrum [ref]37.\nIn contrast, using the low-rank query-key product as a connectivity mask reduces\ncomputation by a different mechanism.\nBy using a low-rank connectivity mask to produce a sparse full-rank attention matrix,\nthe long-tail of the full attention matrix’s eigenspectrum is preserved.\nBased on the significant improvement in top-1 accuracy, we conclude that these long-tail\neigenvalues are important for model predictive quality in ViTs. Low- and full-rank attention visualization — In order to further\nilluminate the qualitative difference between low- and full-rank attention in\nViTs, we also present the masked attention heatmap and the full attention\nheatmap of the query patch (Fig. 5).\nWe show that a connectivity mask can accurately preserve key tokens that are highly related to the query patch and\nremove the irrelevant ones. As a result, the masked attention heatmap preserves structure and discards\nnoise compared with the full attention heatmap. The visualization results also validate that our Sparsifiner\ncan effectively approximate the full attention ViT. Sparse low-rank basis and up-projection matrix visualization — To\ndemonstrate that the connectivity mask can be computed by sparse-sparse matrix\nmultiplication, we visualize the up-projection matrix Wupsuperscript𝑊upW^{\\text{up}} of the\nfirst six layers of Sparsifiner (Fig. 6).\nBecause the reconstructed sparse attention matrix is a combination of the\nup-projection matrix’s weights, we refer to it as a sparse basis.\nWe show that Sparsifiner naturally learns a sparse basis of local regions\nresembling 2D Gaussians.\nFor a given token, the sparse bases corresponding to object locations with\nsalient semantic and/or spatial information will activate.\nSince the sparse attention reconstruction\n(Eq. 5) is a product of the sparse\nlow-rank attention matrix with the up-projection matrix,\nwe also visualize the post-softmax low-rank attention matrix.\nHere we view the low-rank attention matrix as a sparse coefficient of the\nsparse basis (Fig. 7).\nQualitatively, the sparse coefficient also exhibits a high degree of sparsity,\nfurther validating the efficiency of the sparse attention reconstruction via\nsparse-sparse matrix multiplication.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Implementation details — We train all of the models on the ImageNet dataset [ref]12.\nBy default, the connectivity mask predictor module is incorporated into every layer of DeiT-S [ref]34 and LV-ViT-S .\nIn all of our experiments, we set the reduced\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
