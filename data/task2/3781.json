      "content": "Paper Title: Clifford Circuits can be Properly PAC Learned if and only if \"RP\"=\"NP\"\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this work, we prove a negative result in proper learning of one of the best candidates for efficient PAC learning of quantum circuits. However, it should be noted that in many cases there exist improper learners even in the case where proper learning is NP-hard, such as 2-clause CNF, 3-DNF, and intersection of half spaces  . This immediately leaves the problem of whether or not an improper learner exists for Clifford circuits. One way of showing hardness would be to leverage cryptographic hardness such as in Kharitonov , Arunachalam et al. . Another approach would be to assume the hardness of random k-DNF, such as the work of Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz . For upper bounds, the work of Caro and Datta [ref]19 can also be used to get agnostic generalization results, providing a possible pathway to answering research questions in that direction. Another thing worth considering is that the hardness results only apply for small errors (roughly 1/poly⁡(n)1poly𝑛1/\\operatorname{poly}(n)). And while this is sufficient to give complexity-theoretic hardness for the kinds of PAC learners (i.e., strong proper learners) originally introduced by Valiant , it would be nice to get hardness results for larger errors as in the work by Guruswami and Raghavendra [ref]28. This work involved using PCP/hardness-of-approximation ideas to show that even constant training error was NP-hard. We also note that a single output bit of a CNOT circuit is simply an XOR, which is easy to learn efficiently if there is no noise. However, because we are dealing with reversible computation each output bit has to be a linearly independent XOR such that each input bit is recoverable. Finding a CNOT circuit that matches a single XOR function f𝑓f can be done by sampling expected 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n) random XOR until we get n𝑛n linearly independent XOR with one of them being f𝑓f (see Section B.1). Thus, the entire difficulty of proper learning CNOT circuits is this linear independence of the output bits. As such, even though AC0⊆TC0⊆NC1⊆L⊆⊕LsuperscriptAC0superscriptTC0superscriptNC1Ldirect-sumL\\textsf{AC}^{0}\\subseteq\\textsf{TC}^{0}\\subseteq\\textsf{NC}^{1}\\subseteq\\textsf{L}\\subseteq\\oplus\\textsf{L} with the lower classes having improper hardness results based on cryptographic hardness , one cannot directly give an improper learning result for CNOT circuits despite the fact that simulating CNOT circuits is complete for ⊕Ldirect-sumL\\oplus\\textsf{L}. As noted previously, our PAC learning framework is slightly different from that of Caro and Datta [ref]19, in that we use Pauli matrices, rather than rank 111 projectors as measurements. To the author’s knowledge, there exists no proof showing that one framework is necessarily harder than the other. The author also do not see an obvious way of proving an analogous hardness theorem in the specific framework of Caro and Datta [ref]19 for Clifford or CNOT circuits. Finally, with everything from the input states to the circuits involved being classical, it is entirely possible to prove the technical results about CNOT circuits only talking about bit strings and parity functions. Namely, one can replace the entire problem with samples of the form (x,s,sT​C​xmod2)𝑥𝑠modulosuperscript𝑠𝑇𝐶𝑥2(x,s,s^{T}Cx\\mod 2) where (x,s)∼𝒟similar-to𝑥𝑠𝒟(x,s)\\sim\\mathcal{D} are n𝑛n-bit strings and C𝐶C is a CNOT circuit. Since the stabilizer group of a computational basis state always lies in {±1}×{I,Z}⊗nplus-or-minus1superscript𝐼𝑍tensor-productabsent𝑛\\{\\pm 1\\}\\times\\{I,Z\\}^{\\otimes n}, we can uniquely define it by the subgroup that has positive phase. This is equivalent to the orthogonal complement of x𝑥x, which is the subspace Wx={x∈{0,1}n|w⋅x=0}subscript𝑊𝑥conditional-set𝑥superscript01𝑛⋅𝑤𝑥0W_{x}=\\left\\{x\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\bigm{|}w\\cdot x=0\\right\\}. From there, a sample of the form (x,s,0)𝑥𝑠0(x,s,0) simply says that C​x∈Ws𝐶𝑥subscript𝑊𝑠Cx\\in W_{s}, and one can get an analogous proof by copying the lemmas and theorems in Section 4 and Section 6. However, this proof isn’t anymore intuitive than the one given using stabilizer groups, and in fact is probably less intuitive to the average reader due to the lack of established formalism from stabilizers and paulis. It would be interesting if a more intuitive purely classical proof could be made to show hardness of learning CNOT circuits under this model.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: in Kharitonov , Arunachalam et al. .
