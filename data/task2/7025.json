      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Avoidance of Vulnerabilities in Auto-completed Smart Contract Code Using Vulnerability-constrained Decoding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the main problems with language models is that they often contain bias , which can range from producing gender-specific jobs to favoring a certain race. In code synthesis, vulnerabilities can be considered a form of bias in language models. However, few studies focused on the security of synthesized code using transformers. Although  briefly discusses insecure code generated by Codex, the investigation was limited to exploring the generation of cryptography functions. While defenders can leverage new tools such as Security Copilot , a Microsoft security analysis tool that enables analysts to respond to threats quickly, it is better to ensure code security in the first place, e.g., following principles like secure-by-construction [ref]38. Our approach has similarities with lexically-constrained decoding [ref]39, which is a modification of the beam search that allows the user to specify tokens that must (or must not) appear in the decoder’s output. Post and Vilar  proposed a variant of lexically-constrained decoding that reduced complexity from linear to constant-time, which was further optimized by . While these works can deal with pre-defined constraints, our approach allows for embedding the constraint within the model through vulnerability-tuning. This enables more complex constraints, such as vulnerability patterns, to be avoided. By incorporating vulnerability-tuning, our approach can adapt and respond to changing constraints in real-time, offering enhanced flexibility and effectiveness. Furthermore, our implementation is based on a simple greedy search. We expect even better results using more complex decoding algorithms, such as beam-search, which are left for future investigations. Reinforcement learning  (RL)has been successfully used to align models according to human preferences [ref]42. It is also known as reinforcement learning from human feedback  (RLHF)and powers ChatGPT . RL has also been applied to program synthesis. For example,  studied the integration of RL with unit test signals in the fine-tuning of program synthesis models, and  further expanded on this idea, creating an RL framework applicable to various code generation tasks and programming languages by employing execution feedback as an external source of knowledge in model optimization. Although RL could be a strong candidate for reducing code vulnerabilities, it is a rather slow and resource-intensive process . Unlike the RL-based model fine-tuning, our approach prioritizes fast model updates to instantly mitigate the risk of generating vulnerable code. People can use our approach for quick and minor model updates. The slow and resource-intensive approaches, e.g., retraining the entire model using only secure code or the RLHF approach, are probably more suitable for major model updates.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: Microsoft security analysis tool that enables analysts to respond to threats quickly, it is better to ensure code security in the first place, e.g., following principles like secure-by-construction [ref]38.
