Today’s film production teams are mostly dependant on Foley tracks for those movie scenes where background sound is not present at all or the original recording does not come through acceptably well. In these situations they either look for available recorded foley tracks of respective class or prepare studio setup for mimicking the sound through Foley artists and recording it with the screenplay in a noise-free environment. Since the later option certainly turns out to be more pricey, in most cases filmmakers prefer to get available recorded tracks from online or some other sources at low cost. Apparently this seems like an easy solution but they often encounter lack of synchronicity between the video and the overlaying sound. Here comes the necessity of applying deep learning algorithm that can learn the correspondence between audio and video signal and can generate the sound accordingly for the given video clip. In our previous work , for the first time we addressed the traditional foley generation problems and proposed two deep learning models for automatic foley generation. While making a sound of Foley, we specially try to enhance the properties that are intrinsic in the video file, the director is asking to create a Foley sound that an audience person will instantly associate with the relevant video. It is about sensory augmentation and we want the audience to be more engaged than normal. This was our initial approach to this crossmodal problem, that needs to be paid more attention in the time synchronization domain. In this paper, we propose a visually guided class conditioned deep adversarial Foley generation network called ”FoleyGAN” where we present as an advancement in automatic foley synthesis deep neural network from silent video clip. Since, sound plays a crucial role to perceive the inherent action information of most of the visual scenarios of real world and auditory guidance can assist a person or a device to analyze the surrounding events more effectively, our proposed network has also the potential to serve as an IoT (Internet of Things) system which is able to learn the correspondence between visual and audio modalities along with synthesizing synchronous sound tracks from visual signals. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [ref]2 has started immensely favoring the researchers as a promising deep generating model particularly for high quality image generation applications (e.g. [ref]3, ,[ref]5  ).\nNotable advances are found in utilizing (GANs) for audio and music generation , , 0, 1, 2,3 as well though adversarial audio generation still remains a highly challenging task because of some intrinsic differences between sound waveforms and image signals. Sound waves generally show higher periodicities than image signals which leads to use more sophisticated filters with large receptive fields while processing them. In addition, generated audios are more likely to be affected by annoying ”checkerboard” artifacts those can be easily avoided in a generated image using GAN. Recent researches work with spectral representations of audio for adversarial generation. However, none of these approaches have considered about time-action synchronicity traits as a visual guidance to condition the sound generator of GAN along with sound class information, which is infact the key aspect of our ”FoleyGAN” network (Fig.1). On top of that, we incorporate efficiently scaled-up (512 ×\\times 512) BigGAN 4 architecture as our base generative network that benefits us greatly to synthesize high resolution spectrogram generation invertable to sound track via ISTFT 5. In addition to using latent space and class information as inputs we condition the BigGAN generator with visual guidance. Furthermore, we expand our previously proposed ”AFD” dataset  and the discriminator network is pretrained with the spectrogram images of soundfiles of the updated dataset to differentiate between generated and actual samples. The Fig.2 shows the proposed FoleyGAN network are consists of two major neural network blocks: video action recognition network (upper block consisting CNN and TRN 6 architectures) followed up with visually guided class conditioned GAN network (lower block) for sound generation. The first block provides the prediction of the action category of the respective input video as well as prediction weights of the action occurrences over the video time duration from which we are generating action spectrogram. These two outputs are forwarded to our next sound generative network using GAN principle. Finally, the generated spectrogram is inverted via ISTFT to obtain the visually synced sound track for the respected video clip. Previously in AutoFoley  we proposed two separate deep neural networks (e.g. Frame Sequence and Frame Relation Networks) for predicting the existing action in the video frames. Since, the overall performance of both models are found quite similar, we can opt any of these models for the later expansion of this research. However in this work, we have to impose our higher concern on reducing the computational complexity as we are here integrating a scaled up GAN architecture (e.g. BigGAN) for high resolution spectrogram generation. Besides, in this work we are aiming to advance the earlier proposed automatic sound synthesis system with time synchronicity features. Therefore, we intentionally pick the Frame Relation Network that is not only capable of capturing the temporal relations between two consecutive video frames leading to predicting the action happening in the scene, but also uses limited video frames as inputs that are fed into a more simpler multilayer perceptron (MLP) structure. In addition, we are able to condition our generator network with the relational reasoning information between two sequential frames with the help of temporal relation statistics. The significant contributions made by this paper are: We take the initial step toward automatic Foley generation in a silent video clip using visually guided class conditioned generative adversarial network, taking into consideration of the time-action synchronicity requirement in the highly diverse ”movie sound effects” domain. We introduce a concept of conditioning the generated samples of a GAN network with temporal visual information of a video frame sequence that can be deployed for automatic Foley synthesis as well as other multimodal applications. We expand our previously proposed ”Automatic Foley Dataset (AFD)” for efficient training purpose. We present image generating BigGAN architecture trained on ”AFD” dataset for realistic and synchronous sound synthesis of 3 second duration for a rarely addressed multimedia application field. For the performance analysis of our generated sounds, we perform qualitative, numerical experiments and conduct a human survey on our generated sound quality as well as video with sound alignment ability in respective visual events. The paper is structured as follows, in section II and III, we present related works and brief review of GAN background. In section IV, we describe our detailed methodology (audio and video preprocessing steps, a video action recognition followed by a sound generation network) and the complete algorithm. Sections V and VI, provide the explanation of our extended AutoFoley dataset, training details with specifications on hyperparameter tuning, along with model evaluation result analysis through numerical, qualitative and ablation experiments to asses the overall performance respectively. Finally, section VII concludes with summarizing substantial points over and above future directions of this work.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: system which is able to learn the correspondence between visual and audio modalities along with synthesizing synchronous sound tracks from visual signals.
