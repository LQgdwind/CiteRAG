      "content": "Paper Title: Computing roadmaps in unbounded smooth real algebraic sets II: algorithm and complexity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLet 𝐐𝐐\\mathbf{Q} be a real field and let 𝐑𝐑\\mathbf{R} (resp. 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C}) be a real (resp.\nalgebraic) closure of 𝐐𝐐\\mathbf{Q}. One can think about ℚℚ\\mathbb{Q}, ℝℝ\\mathbb{R} and ℂℂ\\mathbb{C}\ninstead, for the sake of understanding. Further, n≥0𝑛0n\\geq 0 is an integer which\nstands for the dimension of the ambient space in which we compute roadmaps.\nIn this document we deal with sets in 𝐑nsuperscript𝐑𝑛\\mathbf{R}^{n} and 𝐂nsuperscript𝐂𝑛\\mathbf{C}^{n} defined by polynomial\nequations with coefficients in 𝐐𝐐\\mathbf{Q}, that are referred to as respectively\nalgebraic sets and real algebraic sets defined over 𝐐𝐐\\mathbf{Q}.\nWe refer to   and  for precise definition and\nproperties of these sets. Considering sets in 𝐑nsuperscript𝐑𝑛\\mathbf{R}^{n} defined by\npolynomial equations and inequalities defines the class of semi-algebraic sets; we\nrefer to   for a comprehensive study of these sets and\ntheir properties. In particular, semi-algebraic and real algebraic sets can be decomposed into\nfinitely many semi-algebraically connected components by [8, Theorem 2.4.4.]. Counting these\ncomponents\n 5 or answering connectivity queries over these sets\n2 finds many applications in e.g. robotics   . Following  [ref]10, such computational issues are tackled by\ncomputing objects called roadmaps and introduced by Canny in\n. In this paper, we focus on the case of real algebraic sets. Given an algebraic set V⊂𝐂n𝑉superscript𝐂𝑛V\\subset\\mathbf{C}^{n} and a finite set of query points 𝒫⊂V𝒫𝑉\\mathcal{P}\\subset V, both defined over 𝐐𝐐\\mathbf{Q}, a roadmap ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} associated to (V,𝒫)𝑉𝒫(V,\\mathcal{P}) is an algebraic curve which is contained in V𝑉V, which contains\n𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}, and whose intersection with each semi-algebraically connected component of V∩𝐑n𝑉superscript𝐑𝑛V\\cap\\mathbf{R}^{n} is non-empty\nand semi-algebraically connected. Given a polynomial system defining V𝑉V, the effective construction of\nroadmaps relies on connectivity statements which allow one to\nconstruct real algebraic subsets of V∩𝐑n𝑉superscript𝐑𝑛V\\cap\\mathbf{R}^{n}, of smaller\ndimension, having a connected intersection with the connected\ncomponents of V∩𝐑n𝑉superscript𝐑𝑛V\\cap\\mathbf{R}^{n}. Such statements in\n  [ref]5 make the assumption that V𝑉V has\nfinitely many singular points and that V∩𝐑n𝑉superscript𝐑𝑛V\\cap\\mathbf{R}^{n} is bounded. In\n, a generalization was obtained by dropping the\nboundedness assumption. In this paper, we design a Monte Carlo\nalgorithm for computing roadmaps based on this latter result, assuming\nregularity assumptions on the system defining V𝑉V. Under those\nassumptions, this improves the state of the art complexity. Canny provided the first algorithms for computing roadmaps; we call\nsuch algorithms roadmap algorithms. Suppose that V⊂𝐂n𝑉superscript𝐂𝑛V\\subset\\mathbf{C}^{n} is defined by s𝑠s polynomials of degree at most D𝐷D. Canny\nobtained in  [ref]10 a Monte Carlo roadmap algorithm\nusing (s​D)O​(n2)superscript𝑠𝐷𝑂superscript𝑛2(sD)^{O(n^{2})} arithmetic operations in 𝐐𝐐\\mathbf{Q}. A deterministic\nversion is also given, with a runtime (s​D)O​(n4)superscript𝑠𝐷𝑂superscript𝑛4(sD)^{O(n^{4})}. This striking\nand important result was then reconsidered and improved in\n5   (among others) to obtain in \na deterministic algorithm using (s​D)O​(n2)superscript𝑠𝐷𝑂superscript𝑛2(sD)^{O(n^{2})} field operations; this\nwas the state-of-the-art for decades. All these algorithms are based\non the same following geometric solving pattern. First a curve,\ndefined as the critical locus of a projection on a plane, is computed;\nit meets all semi-algebraically connected components of the set under study. Next, connectivity\nfailures are repaired by slicing our set with appropriate hyperplanes,\nperforming recursive calls over these slices. The algorithm designed in  is the first one to be based\non a different geometric solving pattern, thanks to an innovative\ngeometric connectivity theorem (under assumptions on the input\nvariety, in particular boundedness). This theorem gives much more\nfreedom in the way to construct roadmaps; in particular, it allows one\nto choose critical loci of higher dimension, which makes it possible\nto slice the input with sections of smaller dimension. This yields a\nbetter balance between the dimensions of these geometric objects,\nreducing the depth of the recursion. The algorithm in  is\na first prototype of this new family of roadmap algorithms; it is\nMonte Carlo and runs in time (n​D)O​(n​n)superscript𝑛𝐷𝑂𝑛𝑛(nD)^{O(n\\sqrt{n})}; the algorithm\nin [ref]5 has similar runtime, but drops all assumptions from\n. In , the authors provide a deterministic\nalgorithm running in time (n​D)O​(n​log2⁡n)superscript𝑛𝐷𝑂𝑛superscript2𝑛(nD)^{O(n\\log^{2}{n})}, for an output\nroadmap with degree (n​D)O​(n​log⁡n)superscript𝑛𝐷𝑂𝑛𝑛(nD)^{O(n\\log{n})}. By re-introducing some\nregularity and boundedness assumption, the first Monte Carlo roadmap\nalgorithm running in time (n​D)O​(n​log⁡d)superscript𝑛𝐷𝑂𝑛𝑑(nD)^{O(n\\log{d})} is given in\n0, where d𝑑d is the dimension of the input algebraic\nset. Also, explicit constants in the big-O exponent are given, showing\nthat the algorithm runs in time sub-quadratic in the degree bound of\nthe output. This leaves open the problem of dropping the regularity and\nboundedness assumptions in this last algorithm. Doing so requires a\nnumber of ingredients, starting with connectivity results which do not\nmake use of such assumptions. In , we showed how to drop\nthe boundedness assumption. In this article, we put this in practice,\nand design a roadmap algorithm for smooth real algebraic sets using a\nnumber of arithmetic operations which is similar to the one\nof 0, without the boundedness assumption.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: connected components by [8, Theorem 2.4.4.].
