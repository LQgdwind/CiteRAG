      "content": "Paper Title: Sequential Place Learning: Heuristic-Free High-Performance Long-Term Place Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe overall CNN+LSTM architecture for global image description and sequential place learning is shown in Fig. 2(b) comprising a single CNN vision module and 2 recurrent LSTM cells, along with a baseline network (a) with an LSTM. Global place description: Given an image sequence Itsubscriptùêºùë°I_{t} of an environment, we apply a CNN function on each input image to obtain compact nùëõn-dimensional global image descriptors ùêùtsubscriptùêùùë°\\mathbf{d}_{t}, where nùëõn ‚àà\\in ‚Ñï+superscript‚Ñï\\mathbb{N}^{+} is a function of the CNN model. These representations can be learned through conventional training via backpropagation. After training, the CNN will have visually encoded the entire environment within its network weights. Sequence place learning (SPL): Depending on the type of CNN chosen, and its particular training requirements, the overall CNN+LSTM training stage can be alleviated by using a pre-trained CNN function such as NetVLAD , heavily used in visual place recognition research for extracting robust global image descriptors. Thus, the CCN module can be frozen while the LSTM cell are trained via BPTT [ref]45. In Fig. 2(b), the environment-specific (env) LSTM cell receives the CNN visual features, temporally concatenated with corresponding positional encodings. This allows our model to capture locale-specific visual and topology features that can then be used to feed a LSTM cell for SPL. The (SPL) LSTM cell receives a direct (skip) connection from the CNN module output, concatenated with the hidden states of the environment-specific LSTM output. Finally, a single linear layer (or multi-layer perceptron (MLP)) receives the hidden states from the (SPL) LSTM cell for semi-supervised training (see Fig. 2). Implementation details: We experimented with several (pre-trained and trained from scratch) CNN vision models. Not surprisingly, we found that NetVLAD , a VGG-16  based architecture, provided better results on average than other vanilla models including AlexNet , VGG-16, ResNet-18 8, SqueezeNet , DenseNet-161 [ref]20. Thus, we used the best model (NetVLAD+whitening, trained on Pittsburgh 30k ), with feature dimension of n=4096ùëõ4096n=4096, from the official MATLAB implementation111https://github.com/relja/netvlad for all state-of-the-art comparisons in Section V. The NetVLAD image descriptors ùêùtsubscriptùêùùë°\\mathbf{d}_{t} were obtained using 224√ó\\times224 RGB image observations, and the 2D positional information ptsubscriptpùë°\\textbf{p}_{t} was encoded using a 2-d vector. Depending on the type of motion data provided by each dataset, we could use any source of motion estimation including GPS, odometry or SfM. For all experiments, we standardize ptsubscriptpùë°\\textbf{p}_{t} (Œº=0ùúá0\\mu=0, œÉ=1ùúé1\\sigma=1) prior to feeding the network. For the recurrent networks, two vanilla single-cell LSTMs, with 512 units each, were trained end-to-end. The number of units NùëÅN of the linear output layer was set to be equal to the total number of frames of the dataset minus TW length. Learning hyperparameters: The cost function of the sequential inference task was sent to the Adam learning gradient algorithm [ref]22 with plateau scheduler for reducing the learning rate (lr), with weight_decay=0weight_decay0\\texttt{weight\\_decay}=0, initial_lr=0.001initial_lr0.001\\texttt{initial\\_lr}=0.001, and min_lr=10‚àí6min_lrsuperscript106\\texttt{min\\_lr}=10^{-6}. The weight assigned to the positional encodings was 500, found through cross-validation. The number of training epochs used vary depending on the dataset size. In this paper, we trained our models using 200 up to 3,000 epochs per environment, comprising between 200 and 35K+ consecutive frames, respectively, with batch sizes equal to the number of frames for stable training. After training, our models were capable of temporally integrating both vision and positional data, even using short TW lengths.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: such as NetVLAD , heavily used in visual place recognition research for extracting robust global image descriptors.
