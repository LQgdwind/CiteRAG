CDLM¬† is a recent follow-up work that pre-trains Longformer¬† for cross-document tasks but only addresses encoder-specific tasks and is not suitable for text generation. PRIMERA¬† is a pre-training method proposed for neural MDS based on the pre-training of the LED architecture¬†. The PRIMERA method is trained on NewSHead, a corpus of 369,940369940369,940 news clusters with similar topics¬†. To create synthetic summaries for pre-training, the authors adopt the Entity Pyramid strategy which is used to select the most important sentences in a document. The Entity Pyramid strategy is based on the frequency of entities that appear in the document. Xiao et¬†al.  demonstrate the effectiveness of the PRIMERA method for MDS compared to previous methods. DAMEN¬† is a novel MDS method proposed for the medical domain. The authors argue that current state-of-the-art Transformer-based solutions for MDS are not suitable for the medical domain because they either truncate inputs or fail to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information. DAMEN involves using two BERT models, known as the Indexer and the Discriminator. The Indexer encodes the background information and documents in a cluster, resulting in dense embedding representations. The Discriminator then selects the top kùëòk documents through a comparison with the background. The background is then combined with the retrieved documents and passed to BART, a probabilistic neural method, to generate the multi-document summary. CGSUM¬†[ref]20 is a recent approach for scientific paper summarization. The authors constructed a comparative scientific summarization corpus (CSSC) and presented a comparative citation-guided summarization (CGSUM) method. The method involves extracting citation sentences and using them to compare and rank different scientific papers¬†[ref]20. The top-ranked papers are then used to generate a summary of the target paper. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of CGSUM on several scientific papers compared to previous methods¬†[ref]20.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: BERTSUM¬†[ref]11, BART¬†, PEGASUS¬†[ref]13, and T5¬† are some pre-trained models that have been widely used in MDS tasks.\nAdditionally, transformer-based architectures such as Longformer¬† and BigBird¬† have been\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
