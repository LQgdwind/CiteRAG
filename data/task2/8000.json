See, e.g., .\n\n\nWe use the following Walnut code:\ndef tribper \"?msd_trib At (t>=i & t+p<i+n) => TR[t]=TR[t+p]\":\n# 403 states\ndef tribpal \"?msd_trib At,u (t>=i & t<i+n & t+u+1=2*i+n) => TR[t]=TR[u]\":\n# 78 states\ndef trib2pal \"?msd_trib Em m<=n & $tribpal(i,m) & $tribpal(i+m,n-m)\":\n# 181 states\ndef tribpp \"?msd_trib Ep p>=1 & p<=n & n>=1 & $tribper(i,n,p) & $trib2pal(i,p)\":\n# 40 states\ndef tribfaceq \"?msd_trib Au,v (u>=i & u<i+n & v+i=u+j) => TR[u]=TR[v]\":\n# 26 states\ndef tribnovel \"?msd_trib Aj (j<i) => ~$tribfaceq(i,j,n)\":\n# 22 states\ndef counttribpp n \"?msd_trib $tribpp(i,n) & $tribnovel(i,n)\":\n# 54 states\n\n\n\nNot all factors of tr are palindromic periodicities; e.g., 102, but\nmany of them are. For example, we can verify\nthat all prefixes are (see Theorem 4 above):\neval allprefixtrib \"?msd_trib An (n>=1) => $tribpp(0,n)\":\n\nand Walnut returns TRUE.\n\n\nWe now compute an explicit formula for the number of\nlength-n factors of tr that are palindromic periodicities.\nDefine, as usual, the Tribonacci numbers\nby T0=0, T1=1, T2=2 and\nTn=Tn-1+Tn-2+Tn-3 for\nn≥3. We also set Ti=0 for i<0.\n\n\n\nTheorem 18.\n\n\nLet n≥0 and Tk≤n<Tk+1. Then\n\n\n\npptr(n)={2n+1,if n≤(Tk+1-Tk-1-1)/2;2Tk+1+2Tk-1-(2n+1),if (Tk+1-Tk-1-1)/2<n<Tk+Tk-1;Tk+1+Tk-1,otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorollary 19.\n\n\nWe have pptr(n)≤2n+1 and\npptr(n)>αn, where\nα≐1.0873780253841527 is the\nreal zero of X3+2X2+4X-8.\n\n\n\nProof.\n\nFor the lower bound, we see from\nTheorem 18 that the local minima\nof pptr(n)/n occur\nwhen n=2Tk+1-2Tk+1\nand pptr(n)=Tk+Tk-1-1.\nThe result now follows from the explicit\nformula for Tk. We omit the details.\n∎\n\n\n\n\n\n6 Words with few palindromic periodicities\n\nAs we have seen above, both the Rudin–Shapiro word and the regular paperfolding word have only finitely many palindromic periodicities as factors. Indeed, using the linear representation for counting the number of palindromic periodicities of length n, we can show that the Rudin–Shapiro word has exactly 334 palindromic periodicities, and the paperfolding word has exactly 255 palindromic periodicities. This suggests the question of finding words with the minimum possible number of palindromic periodicities.\n\n\nWhen we count palindromic periodicities in this section, we\ndo not count the empty word.\n\n\nWe say a word is aperiodic if it is not ultimately periodic.\n\n\n\nTheorem 20.\n\n\nLet Σ={0,1,…,k-1} be an alphabet of size\nat least 3.\n\n(a)\n\nNo infinite word over Σ has fewer than 6 distinct palindromic periodicities.\n\n(b)\n\nThe bound 6 is optimal because (012)ω has 6.\n\n(c)\n\nNo aperiodic infinite binary word has ≤8 palindromic periodicities.\n\n(d)\n\nThe bound 8 is optimal, because the image of f under the map τ:0→0, 1→12 has 9 palindromic periodicities, namely\n{0,1,2,01,12,20,00,001,200}.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the proof we make use of a ternary word first studied by\nFici and Zamboni 3.\n\n\nProof.\n\n\n(a)\n\nWithout loss of generality we may assume that the first occurrence of a letter i precedes the first occurrence of j for all i<j. Then breadth-first search with a growing alphabet demonstrates that the longest such word with ≤5 palindromic periodicities is of length 5, namely 00000.\n\n(b)\n\nIt is easy to see the only palindromic periodicities of (012)ω are\n0,1,2,01,12,20.\n\n(c)\n\nAgain, without loss of generality, we assume that the first occurrence of a letter i precedes the first occurrence of j for all i<j. With this assumption, we claim that\nif w is of length at least 9 and has ≤8 palindromic periodicities, then\nw is of one of the following forms:\n0(012)i{ϵ,0,01},\n(012)i{ϵ,0,2,3,00,01,03,011,013},\n(0123)i{ϵ,0,01,012},\n0(123)i{ϵ,1,12}.\n\n\nThe claim can be easily verified for 9≤|w|≤12. It is easy to check that all words with the stated property of length 12 can be written uniquely in the form xyiz with i≥2\nx∈{ϵ,0}, y∈{012,123,0123},\nand |z|≤3. Let w be a shortest counterexample\nto the claim with |w|>12. Let xyiz be the unique\nfactorization of the prefix of w of length 12; then\ni≥2. Write w=xyjz′ with j as large\nas possible. It is now easy to check, by considering\nthe possible suffixes y2z′ of w, that either z′\nbegins with y (so j was not maximal, a contradiction),\nor z′ is one of the words given in the characterization,\na contradiction.\n\n(d)\n\nWe use Walnut. Here it is possible to compute an automaton for τ(f) because the\nnumber of occurrences of 0 (resp., 1) in a prefix of length n\nof f is synchronized; see [27, Sect. 10.11]. The following\nWalnut code checks that τ(f) has no palindromic periodicities of length >3; it is then\neasy to enumerate them by hand. The code for the first five automata is taken from [27, Sect. 10.11].\nreg shift {0,1} {0,1} \"( |  * )*\":\ndef phin \"?msd_fib (s=0 & n=0) | Ex $shift(n-1,x) & s=x+1\":\ndef noverphi \"?msd_fib Et $phin(n,t) & s+n=t\":\ndef fibpref0 \"?msd_fib $noverphi(n+1,s)\":\ndef fibpref1 \"?msd_fib Eu $fibpref0(n,u) & n=s+u\":\n\ndef img \"?msd_fib Ew,x,y,z $fibpref0(q,x) & $fibpref1(q,y) &\n   $fibpref0(q+1,w) & $fibpref1(q+1,z) & x+2*y<=n & w+2*z>n &\n   r+x+2*y=n\":\n# img(n) = (q,r) means the n’th position of the image\n# tau(f) is the r’th letter of phi(f[q])\n\ndef img0 \"?msd_fib Eq,r $img(n,q,r) & F[q]=@0\":\ndef img1 \"?msd_fib Eq,r $img(n,q,r) & F[q]=@1 & r=0\":\ndef img2 \"?msd_fib Eq,r $img(n,q,r) & F[q]=@1 & r=1\":\ncombine NF img0=0 img1=1 img2=2:\n\ndef nfper \"?msd_fib At (t>=i & t+p<i+n) => NF[t]=NF[t+p]\":\ndef nfpal \"?msd_fib At,u (t>=i & t<i+n & t+u+1=2*i+n) => NF[t]=NF[u]\":\ndef nf2pal \"?msd_fib Em m<=n & $nfpal(i,m) & $nfpal(i+m,n-m)\":\ndef nfpp \"?msd_fib Ep p>=1 & p<=n & n>=1 & $nfper(i,n,p) & $nf2pal(i,p)\":\neval nfpp3 \"?msd_fib Ai,n $nfpp(i,n) => n<=3\":\n\n\n\nand Walnut returns TRUE for the last assertion.\nTo check that τ(f) is aperiodic, we check that it\nhas no 4th powers:\neval no4 \"?msd_fib ~Ei,n,p n>=1 & p>=1 & $nfper(i,n,p) & n>=4*p\":\n\n\n\n∎\n\n\n\nThe binary case is similar but a bit more complicated.\n\n\n\nTheorem 21.\n\n\nLet Σ={0,1}.\n\n(a)\n\nNo infinite word over Σ has fewer than 30 distinct palindromic periodicities.\n\n(b)\n\nThe bound 30 is optimal because (001011)ω has 30.\n\n(c)\n\nNo aperiodic infinite binary word has ≤43 palindromic periodicities.\n\n(d)\n\nThe bound 43 is optimal, because the image of f under the map φ:0→0, 1→01101 has 44 palindromic periodicities.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the proof we make use of another word first studied by\nFici and Zamboni 3.\n\n\nProof sketch..\n\n\n(a)\n\nBreadth-first search shows that the longest binary words with ≤29 palindromic periodicities are of length 29; namely, 029 and 129.\n\n(b)\n\nIt is easy to check that the only palindromic periodicities in (001011)ω are\n\n\n\n0,1,00,01,10,11,001,010,011,100,101,110,0010,0101,0110,1001,1011,\n\n\n\n1100,00101,01011,01100,10010,10110,11001,010110,011001,100101,\n\n\n\n0110010,1011001,10010110.\n\n\n\n(c)\n\nWe claim that every sufficient large finite binary word having ≤43 palindromic periodicities is of the form xyiz where |x|,|z|≤5 and y is a conjugate of one of members of the set B,\nwhere\n\n\n\nB\n={001011,001101,0001011,0001101,0010111,0011101,00001011,00001101,\n\n\n\n\n00010111,00011101,00101011,00101111,00110101,00111101}.\n\n\nThe argument is similar as for the previous theorem.\n\n(d)\n\nWe use Walnut.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.

Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. Generate exactly 40 titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning."
