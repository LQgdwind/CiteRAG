      "content": "Paper Title: Disagreement amongst counterfactual explanations: How transparency can be deceptive\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs referred to in Section 1 and Section 2.1, evaluating XAI methods is a research field in its infancy today, even though a strong need for evaluation methods is identified by multiple authors such as .\nOne reason for the limited amount of research done in this field can be the simple fact that evaluating XAI methods is difficult, especially for post-hoc explanation methods. These are designed to explain complex models with a black-box nature. By definition, we don’t know the logic involved in a decision made by such models, thus we cannot compare the output of a post-hoc explanation method to a model’s ground truth. Some have tried generating synthetic datasets for which the ground truth is known [ref]24  [ref]3. However, this does not completely solve the problem. First of all, the comparison of this ground truth with the explanations is not always straightforward. This results in multiple metrics, for example, [ref]24 look at faithfulness, monotonicity, ROAR, GT-Shapley, and infidelity. Each of these metrics has its own pros and cons. Consequently, the best metric is subjective and application-specific . Secondly, a model might not learn all relationships in the data correctly and show bias. The goal of XAI is to explain the model and not the data. In other words, the model’s ground truth might be different from the data’s ground truth and therefore comparing model explanations with the data’s ground truth can be inaccurate. Lastly, [ref]24 agree with an existing gap between synthetic and real-life datasets. They also cite that using their synthetic datasets and connected ground truths cannot be seen as a replacement for human-centered evaluation of XAI techniques, which is a mostly qualitative way of evaluating explanations. [ref]44 divide XAI evaluation techniques into two groups: those that involve human-centred evaluations and those that evaluate with objective metrics. The first require human participants to give qualitative or quantitative feedback to XAI explanations, typically through surveys. For the second, to this day, more than 35 metrics have been proposed in the literature to evaluate XAI explanations. Examples of these metrics are, among others, actionability (knowledge is useful to the end-user), efficiency (computational speed of the algorithm), simplification (minimal features), stability (similar instances should provide similar explanations), etc. The authors conclude that the boom in the amount of evaluation metrics calls for a general consensus among researchers on how an explanation should be evaluated. Note that these objective metrics are sometimes hard to quantify. Qualitative quality properties are therefore often quantified in numbers. For counterfactual explanations, popular properties are proximity, sparsity, and plausibility . Proximity is a property that is somehow used in every counterfactual algorithm. It tries to measure the total change that is suggested by the counterfactual explanations with a distance metric   . It is intuitive that less change is better than more change in most situations. Sparsity is a special case of proximity. It refers to the number of features in the explanation 8  . The argument is that shorter explanations are more comprehensible for humans than longer ones . Finally, plausibility is a more conceptual property that refers to the closeness to the data manifold . For example, in a credit scoring context, advising someone to wait 200 years in order to get a loan, is not plausible. Counterfactual explanations have an additional advantage in comparison to feature importance methods. The latter estimate the influence of each feature on the predicted score. These estimates potentially suffer from bias and features which have almost no influence on the model’s decision might be labeled important 1. Counterfactual explanations don’t suffer from this bias, applying the suggested changes of a counterfactual explanation will always lead to a change in prediction. Consequently, a counterfactual explanation is always ”correct” in one sense. However, this does not guarantee that these are quality explanations. The ambiguity of measuring the quality of counterfactual explanations has led to the development of many counterfactual algorithms and possibly as many different explanations  3. As a result, when a stakeholder now wants to use counterfactual explanations, he is presented with many options. This might be an advantage or can lead to the disagreement problem.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: made by such models, thus we cannot compare the output of a post-hoc explanation method to a model’s ground truth.
