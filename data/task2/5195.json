To that end, we propose an evaluation framework, in which we evaluate XAI methods w.r.t their faithfulness, complexity, robustness, localization capabilities, and behavior with regard to randomized logits, following the authors of .\nWe apply our framework to (1) measure the impact of canonization and (2) demonstrate how hyperparameter search can improve the quality of explanations.\nTherefore, we first extend the model canonization approach to modern model architectures with high interconnectivity, e.g., DenseNet variants.\nWe apply our evaluation framework to measure the benefits of model canonization for various image classification model architectures (VGG, ResNet, EfficientNet, DenseNet) using the ILSVRC2017 and Pascal VOC 2012\ndatasets, as well as for Visual Question Answering (VQA) with Relation Networks using the CLEVR-XAI dataset .\nWe show that generally model canonization is beneficial for all tested architectures, but depending on which aspect of explanation quality is measured, the impact of model canonization differs.\nMoreover, we demonstrate how our XAI evaluation framework can be leveraged for hyperparameter search to optimize the explanation quality from different points of view.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has been increasingly applied to high-stakes decision processes with a huge impact on human lives, such as medical applications  [ref]10, credit scoring , criminal justice 9, and hiring decisions .\nTherefore, awareness has been raised for the need of neural networks and their predictions to be transparent and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
