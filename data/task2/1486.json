      "content": "Paper Title: Video action recognition for lane-change classification and prediction of surrounding vehicles\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs suggested by  vehicle motion modeling and prediction approaches can be classified into three different levels: physical-based, where predictions only depend on the laws of physics, maneuver-based, where the future motion of a vehicle depends on the driver maneuver, and intention-aware, where predictions take into consideration inter-dependencies between vehicles. Note that, as a chicken-egg problem, on the one hand, lane-change recognition can be addressed using the trajectory estimated by any of the motion models , and on the other hand, the prediction of the trajectories of surrounding vehicles can be estimated more accurately if the lane-change intention recognition is available. Some proposals are intention-aware in their nature. For example, by using graphical models such as Bayesian Networks , ,  or Structural Recurrent Neural Networks , or by using convolutional social pooling in an LSTM encoder-decoder architecture [ref]28. However, in most cases, inter-dependencies between vehicles are modeled by extracting relative physical features (distances, velocities or time-gaps) , , , [ref]27 or by generating compact representations that encode the relative positions of all vehicles on the scene [ref]26, , . A considerable number of previous works do not take into consideration the interaction between vehicles , , , , . Many approaches to lane-change recognition and prediction address the problem using generative-based solutions, including Na√Øve Bayes Classifiers , Bayesian Networks , , , and Hidden Markov Models . Others make use of discriminative solutions such as case-based reasoning , Random Decision Forest , traditional Neural Networks , , Support Vector Machines , , , Gaussian Process Neural Networks , and feedforward Convolutional Neural Networks [ref]26, , . Finally, some other approaches are based on the use of Recurrent Networks including vanilla LSTM  and LSTM encoder-decoder [ref]27 and multi-modal [ref]28 architectures. Consequently, two-stream architectures have not been proposed so far to perform lane change detection and prediction.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: For example, by using graphical models such as Bayesian Networks , ,  or Structural Recurrent Neural Networks , or by using convolutional social pooling in an LSTM encoder-decoder architecture [ref]28.
