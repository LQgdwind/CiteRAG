      "content": "Paper Title: MemoNav: Working Memory Model for Visual Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAll experiments are conducted in the Habitat  simulator with the Gibson [ref]41 and Matterpot3D  scene dataset, adopting an action space consistent with VGM [ref]23. 1-goal evaluation.\nIn Gibson, we use 72 scenes for training and a public dataset  comprising 14 unseen scenes for evaluation. Following the setting in VGM [ref]23, 1007 out of 1400 1-goal episodes222The 1-goal difficulty level here denotes the hard level in this public test dataset from this public dataset are used for evaluation, while we still use the full set of 1400 episodes for ablation studies of MemoNav. Multi-goal dataset.\nMulti-goal evaluation, which requires an agent to navigate to an ordered sequence of goals, is more suitable for evaluating memory models used for navigation. By enabling the agent to return to visited places we can test whether memory models help the agent plan efficient paths. If not, the agent will probably waste its time re-exploring the scene or traveling randomly. However, recent ImageNav methods seldom conduct multi-goal evaluations. To further investigate the efficacy of MemoNav, we follow MultiON 9 to compile 700-episode multi-goal test datasets in the Gibson scenes (see Fig. 3 for an example). We follow five rules to set sequential goals for each episode: (1) No obstacles appear near each goal. (2) The distance between two successive goals is no more than 10 meters. (3) All goals are placed on the same layer. (4) All goals are reachable from each other. (5) The final goal is placed near a certain previous one. Please refer to Fig. 8 for dataset statistics. In Matterpot3D, we sample 1008 episodes per difficulty level from the multi-goal test datasets used in Multi-ON 9. The difficulty of an episode is indicated by the number of goals. All methods are trained on the Gibson 1-goal dataset and tested across varying difficulty levels. Evaluation Metrics. In 1-goal tasks, the success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL)  are used. In a multi-goal task, two metrics are borrowed from 9: The progress (PR) is the fraction of goals successfully reached, equal to the SR for 1-goal tasks; Progress weighted by path length (PPL) indicates navigation efficiency and is defined as P​P​L=1E​∑i=1EP​r​o​g​r​e​s​si​limax⁡(pi,li)𝑃𝑃𝐿1𝐸superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝐸𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑠subscript𝑠𝑖subscript𝑙𝑖subscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝑙𝑖\\displaystyle PPL=\\frac{1}{E}\\sum_{i=1}^{E}Progress_{i}\\frac{l_{i}}{\\max\\left(p_{i},l_{i}\\right)}, where E𝐸\\displaystyle E is the total number of test episodes, lisubscript𝑙𝑖\\displaystyle l_{i} and pisubscript𝑝𝑖\\displaystyle p_{i} are the shortest path distance to the final goal via midway ones, and the actual path length taken by the agent, respectively. The objective of each goal is to stop within 1 meter of the goal location and each episode is allowed 500 steps.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: All experiments are conducted in the Habitat  simulator with the Gibson [ref]41 and Matterpot3D  scene dataset, adopting an action space consistent with VGM [ref]23. 1-goal evaluation.\nIn Gibson, we use 72 scenes for training and a public dataset  comprising 14 unseen\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
