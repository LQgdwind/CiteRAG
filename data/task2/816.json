(a)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†(b)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†(c)\n\n\n Data sparsity can be exploited in CNN inference accelerators¬†  [ref]32, as zeros in the data reduce the theoretical compute and storage cost significantly.\nHowever, traditional sparse matrix multiplication (sGEMM) from scientific workloads only generates speedup at very high sparsity (e.g., >>95% zeros).\nIn contrast, CNNs typically exhibit 50‚Äì70% zeros¬† , which falls well below this level.\nFurthermore, the zeros in CNNs are naturally distributed randomly (Fig.¬†1(a)), which leads to two challenges.\nFirstly, this requires each non-zero element to be indexed explicitly, which increases the overheads of storing and manipulating the indexes, not to mention the cost of gathering and scattering the data.\nIndexing overheads are exacerbated for INT8 data types, where the index itself may require at least 4-bits.\nSecondly, load balancing is intractable for random sparsity without inspecting the indexes at runtime, making it difficult to achieve high utilization. Block sparsity (Fig.¬†1(b)) is an alternative, where a contiguous block or pattern of elements is forced to be either all-zero or unconstrained.\nFor hardware design, this has two huge advantages over random sparsity.\nFirstly, the indexing cost is substantially reduced, because a single index is amortized over multiple data elements.\nSecondly, as the granularity is now a block rather than a single element, the workload is entirely predictable, which makes load balancing and hardware design in general much easier.\nHowever, as the block size increases to the benefit of the hardware, the CNN accuracy degrades due to the increasingly large ‚Äúholes‚Äù in the weight matrices.\nA fairly new alternative formulation called density bound block (DBB) sparsity¬† , introduces a bound on the number of non-zero elements in each block (Fig.¬†1(c)).\nDBB sparsity exhibits the hardware advantages of block sparsity and the CNN performance of random sparsity.\nDBB has even been implemented in the recently announced Nvidia A100 GPU product¬†, which cites 2√ó\\times speedup for 50% sparsity. A significant limitation of the two DBB architectures published to date, is that the sparsity is fixed at design time: 75% in¬†, and 50% in¬†.\nAs a result, any model that does not meet this fixed sparsity level will be forced to fall back to dense execution with no gains.\nEven worse, any models that achieve even higher sparsity than the fixed level will also see no further gains.\nTherefore, a fixed sparsity level severely limits the usefulness of DBB for broader deployment, as any commercial products are forced to choose a modest sparsity level to best suit the average customer.\nThe challenge in supporting variable sparsity levels is that the number of MACs required per fixed amount of weights read from SRAM changes.\nFor a fixed provisioning of hardware MACs, this leads to a proportional drop in utilization, which directly impacts energy efficiency and area efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel variable DBB technique using a time unrolled architecture.\nWe demonstrate this in a reuse optimized accelerator and demonstrate state-of-the-art results.\nThe contributions of this paper are summarized below: In previous work, the DBB compression is fixed¬† , which is a big impediment to broader deployment, because CNNs can vary widely in their weight sparsity.\nThis paper describes a variable DBB (VDBB) architecture achieved through time unrolling, that supports all structured sparsity ratios from 12.5% (1/8181/8) up to fully dense (8/8888/8), achieving both speedup and energy efficiency as sparsity increases. We describe an accelerator microarchitecture to implement time unrolled variable DBB.\nAt the datapath array level, we implement a systolic tensor array (STA) composed of a more complex PE called a tensor PE (TPE), which increases reuse and better amortizes the cost of data movement.\nTo decrease SRAM read power we introduce a novel hardware IM2COL unit after the SRAM and just before the datapath, which achieves ¬†3x bandwidth magnification for 3√ó\\times3 kernels.\nWe show how to incorporate VDBB weight sparsity and random activation sparsity. The combination of time unrolled VDBB and the reuse optimized implementation result in a large number of parameters, which all have an interlinked impact on performance, area and energy such that the optimal design point is not obvious.\nTherefore, we finally enumerate the design space and describe the pareto-optimal design choices.\nResults in 16nm for INT8 at 1GHz show the optimal nominal 4 TOPS accelerator has effective throughput and energy that scale strongly with model sparsity and demonstrating 16.8 TOPS/W (50% model sparsity) up to 55.7 TOPS/W (87.5% model sparsity).\nThis is more than 8√ó\\timesgreater energy efficiency compared to the previously published Laconic¬†[ref]32. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.\nSection¬†II provides background material on DBB and presents motivation for the paper.\nSection¬†III describes the time unrolled variable DBB (VDBB) architecture, and Section¬†IV presents a reuse optimized accelerator implementation.\nSection¬†V describes the experimental methodology and Section¬†VI presents the results.\nSection¬†VII describes related work.\nFinally, Section¬†VIII concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Convolutional neural network (CNN) inference has quickly become an important workload on IoT¬† [ref]12 [ref]13 and mobile computing devices¬† , which has spurred the development of hardware accelerators in mobile SoCs¬† .\nCNNs are fundamentally composed of many layers of multi-channel 2D\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
