Unlike conventional communication technologies that aim to accurately transmit bit information from the transmitter to the receiver, semantic communication is geared towards some specific semantic tasks, e.g., security monitoring​​ and edge inference​​. Moreover, by extracting and encoding desired information from the source data that is most relevant to the considered semantic tasks, semantic communication dramatically reduces resource consumption for communications. Therefore, semantic communication is expected to flourish in many practical scenarios, e.g., virtual reality​​ and smart cities​​. Semantic communication was first introduced by Shannon​​ and Weaver​​ in the 1950s, aiming to study the precise transmissions of semantic information. Since then, researchers have been working for several decades on how to define and model semantic information. Carnap and Bar-Hillel​​ proposed a logical probability-based approach to replace the statistical one in classical information theory where the amount of information is determined by its statistical rarity. Floridi​​ further proposed a semantic information theory based on logical probabilities, aiming to resolve the semantic paradox problem​​. However, the subjectivity of semantic understanding among different people poses a challenge in designing the logical probability functions that can be widely applied in practice. Moreover, many recent works focused on deep learning (DL)-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC)​​  , i.e., the source coding and channel coding are jointly optimized by using deep neural networks, and DL-based separate source-channel coding (SSCC)​​  , i.e., a deep neural network is designed to compress source symbols, followed by a classical channel coding scheme, e.g., low-density parity check coding​​, to implement the point-to-point semantic communications. Recently, a new type of semantic source model was discussed in Ref. [ref]21 and [ref]22, and the semantic source is modeled as two distinct parts: an extrinsic observation and an intrinsic semantic state. Taking video as an example, the video signal itself\nrepresents the extrinsic observation, and its features, which are generated based on this video for certain tasks, such as action recognition​​ and object detection​​, correspond to the intrinsic semantic state. Two distortion measures, namely the observation and semantic distortions, were adopted to study the semantic rate-distortion function (SRDF)​​[ref]21 [ref]22, which is defined as the minimum compression rate subject to the maximum tolerable observation and semantic distortions. In this semantic source model, semantic state is generally not observable while can be inferred from the observation​​[ref]21. Then, the source encoder only focuses on encoding the observation and the decoder reconstructs both\nthe semantic state and the observation, subject to both the semantic and observation distortion constraints. Under this framework, it has been shown​​[ref]22  that SSCC performs the same as JSCC over the infinite discrete memoryless channels.\nHowever, SRDF generally has no closed-form expression​​[ref]22, and can only be effectively solved for some specifically distributed semantic sources, e.g., Gaussian​​[ref]22 and binary sources​​. Considering the high-dimensional feature of the semantic sources, e.g., text​​, speech​​, and images​​, their distributions are general and difficult to be well modeled, making it extremely challenging to compute the corresponding SRDFs. Despite many efforts already made in the field of semantic communications, there remains an absence of theoretical research on the fundamental analysis of SRDFs for generally distributed sources. To deal with this issue, the purpose of this paper aims to analyze the fundamental limits of the point-to-point semantic communications for general semantic sources. Specifically, inspired by the semantic source model proposed in Ref. [ref]21, we consider a semantic source pair at the transmitter consisting of the extrinsic observation and its intrinsic semantic state. Here, only the observation data is compressed and encoded at the transmitter and then sent over a discrete memoryless channel to the receiver, where both the extrinsic observation and the semantic state are finally recovered. We aim to compute the corresponding SRDF for generally distributed semantic sources, which reveals the trade-off among the compression rate, observation distortion, semantic distortion, and channel capacity. Moreover, for the case with imperfectly known semantic source distribution, i.e., only a certain amount of source samples are available, motivated by the neural estimation method for traditional rate-distortion functions​​0, we design a neural estimator for SRDF: first, we show that SRDF can be rewritten as an inf-sup problem via its dual property; then, we leverage generative networks to solve this problem and derive the neural estimation of the SRDF (NESRD), and further show NESRD to be a strongly consistent estimator; finally, when the semantic state is a deterministic function of the observation, we design a cascade neural network framework to train the derived NESRD. For the case with perfectly known semantic source distribution, we generalize the conventional Blahut-Arimoto (BA) algorithm to numerically compute SRDF and analyze the computational complexity of this proposed algorithm. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the SSCC-based framework.\nSection III derives the neural estimator for SRDF under the case with unknown semantic source distributions. Section IV proposes the general BA algorithm to calculate SRDF for the case with known semantic source distributions. Experimental results are presented and discussed in Section V to validate the theoretical results. Finally, Section VI concludes this paper.
