      "content": "Paper Title: Link Prediction with Relational Hypergraphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph neural networks (GNNs)  [ref]2 have become successful in learning the representation of graph-structured data, and in particular, message passing neural networks  emerged as a prominent framework.\nOne popular application of GNNs is link prediction with knowledge graphs. Knowledge graphs are composed of binary facts, which are represented as relational edges connecting nodes (or, entities).\nThe task of link prediction with knowledge graphs has been well-studied, with powerful models proposed [ref]4 [ref]5 and rigorously evaluated in recent years  . However, being able to represent only binary facts is not sufficient for adequately modeling complex interactions between k𝑘k entities in knowledge bases when k>2𝑘2k>2. Relational hypegraphs can model such interactions through hyperedges.\nFigure 1 depicts an example of a simple relational hypergraph that consists of two higher-arity facts, encoding the information“𝖧𝖺𝗐𝗄𝗂𝗇𝗀𝖧𝖺𝗐𝗄𝗂𝗇𝗀\\mathsf{Hawking} went to 𝖮𝗑𝖿𝗈𝗋𝖽𝖮𝗑𝖿𝗈𝗋𝖽\\mathsf{Oxford} to study 𝖯𝗁𝗒𝗌𝗂𝖼𝗌𝖯𝗁𝗒𝗌𝗂𝖼𝗌\\mathsf{Physics} and received a 𝖡𝖠𝖡𝖠\\mathsf{BA} degree”, and “In the field of 𝖯𝗁𝗒𝗌𝗂𝖼𝗌𝖯𝗁𝗒𝗌𝗂𝖼𝗌\\mathsf{Physics}, 𝖭𝗈𝖻𝖾𝗅𝖯𝗋𝗂𝗓𝖾𝖭𝗈𝖻𝖾𝗅𝖯𝗋𝗂𝗓𝖾\\mathsf{NobelPrize} has been awarded to scientists in 𝖮𝗑𝖿𝗈𝗋𝖽𝖮𝗑𝖿𝗈𝗋𝖽\\mathsf{Oxford}”. These higher-arity relations cannot be effectively modeled by a knowledge graph without loss of information. Link prediction with relational hypergraphs, while valuable, poses significant challenges due to the varying numbers of nodes in each hyperedge. Most previous works focused on extending knowledge graph embedding methods to relational hypergraphs  , but they are all transductive, i.e., they cannot be directly applied to nodes unseen during training unlike inductive models.\nIn a parallel, message-passing neural networks are extended to operate on relational hypergraphs 0 1, but these architectures are only inductive if the node features are provided. In addition, our theoretical understanding of these message-passing architectures remains highly incomplete, leaving open questions about their expressiveness power. To this end, we first define hypergraph relational message passing neural networks (HR-MPNNs) containing most of the message-passing neural networks proposed for relational hypergraphs 0 1. Following Barceló et al. , we quantify their expressive power through a relational Weisfeiler-Leman test. We also study the expressive power of HR-MPNNs in terms of logical formalisms, in the same spirit as Barceló et al. 2.\nInspired by the powerful conditional message passing paradigms studied in the context of knowledge graphs [ref]5 , we introduce hypergraph conditional message passing neural networks (HC-MPNNs).\nHC-MPNNs are fully inductive even with the absence of input node features and can be seen as a strict generalization of the existing C-MPNN framework  on knowledge graphs. Through a careful comparison of the expressive power of HR-MPNNs and HC-MPNNs, we develop a systematic understanding of their capabilities and limitations. We further propose a simple model instance of HC-MPNNs termed as hypergraph conditional networks (HCNets) and showcase its superior performances on both inductive and transductive link prediction tasks, followed by a detailed ablation study on its model components. Notably, HCNets are maximally expressive within HC-MPNNs and naturally subsume C-MPNNs, thus recovering models like NBFNets [ref]5, when applied on knowledge graphs. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: We investigate hypergraph relational message passing neural networks (HR-MPNNs) that encompass most of the existing architectures for link prediction with relational hypergraphs. We build on the success of the conditional message passing paradigm in knowledge graphs and generalize this to relational hypergraphs leading to hypergraph conditional message passing neural networks (HC-MPNNs). We study the expressive power in terms of distinguishing nodes of these architectures via corresponding WL algorithms. We also investigate their expressive power in terms of logics, namely, some hypergraph extensions of graded modal logic. We conduct an empirical analysis for inductive link prediction with relational hypergraphs, surpassing existing baselines by a great margin. We further extend our analysis to transductive link prediction\nwith relational hypergraphs and obtain state-of-the-art results. We conduct a series of ablation studies on different model components justifying the importance of these components in the model predictions, and carry out additional experiments on knowledge graphs.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Graph neural networks (GNNs)  [ref]2 have become successful in learning the representation of graph-structured data, and in particular, message passing neural networks  emerged as a prominent framework.\nOne popular application of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
