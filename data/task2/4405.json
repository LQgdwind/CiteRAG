One way to prove Lemma D.18 is via the isomorphism  between flips on k𝑘k-angulations and rotations on k−1𝑘1k-1-ary plane trees. One can prove that the rotation graph on k−1𝑘1k-1-ary plane trees is connected as follows: find a path from any given tree to a “spine,” where all internal nodes belong to a simple path via left children from the root to the leftmost leaf [ref]13. (This path consists of repeated left rotations.) Every non-spine tree has some internal node at which a left rotation can be performed. Furthermore, when no such operation is still possible, one has a spine. Nakamoto, Kawatani, Matsumoto, and Urrutia  also gave a proof of connectedness for the special case k=4𝑘4k=4. Sleator, Tarjan, and Thurston proved [ref]42 that the diameter of K3,n+2subscript𝐾3𝑛2K_{3,n+2} is at most 2​n−62𝑛62n-6 for n≥11𝑛11n\\geq 11. We now prove Lemma D.6:\nSee D.6 By Lemma D.11 and the observation that there are at most ((k−2)​n+2k)binomial𝑘2𝑛2𝑘\\binom{(k-2)n+2}{k} classes, the partition 𝒮k,(k−2)​n+2subscript𝒮𝑘𝑘2𝑛2\\mathcal{S}_{k,(k-2)n+2} meets Conditions 1 and 5 of the framework, with the modification to Condition 1 that the O​(1)𝑂1O(1) term is replaced with O​(nO​(1))𝑂superscript𝑛𝑂1O(n^{O(1)}), and Condition 6 easily follows from the identification of each class with a k𝑘k-gon containing the center of the (k−2)​n+2𝑘2𝑛2(k-2)n+2-gon. Corollary D.17 gives a formula for the size of each class and each edge set between classes. Lemma D.5 then easily gives a polynomial bound on the ratio of N=|V​(Kk,(k−2)​n+2)|𝑁𝑉subscript𝐾𝑘𝑘2𝑛2N=|V(K_{k,(k-2)n+2})| to the size of the smallest class (similarly the smallest edge set). Conditions 2, 3, and 4 follow, with the modification that the O​(1)𝑂1O(1) terms are replaced with O​(nO​(1))𝑂superscript𝑛𝑂1O(n^{O(1)}) terms. To derive the specific quasipolynomial bound in Theorem 1.5, we first observe the following: The smallest edge set between classes in 𝒮k,(k−2)​n+2subscript𝒮𝑘𝑘2𝑛2\\mathcal{S}_{k,(k-2)n+2} has size at least The next fact we need comes from Lemma 4.5:\nSee 4.5\nApplying Lemma 4.5, and using the fact that Kk,(k−2)​n+2subscript𝐾𝑘𝑘2𝑛2K_{k,(k-2)n+2} is a ≤(k−2)​nabsent𝑘2𝑛\\leq(k-2)n-regular graph with log⁡N≤(k−1)​n​log⁡(k−1)𝑁𝑘1𝑛𝑘1\\log N\\leq(k-1)n\\log(k-1), gives Here we have implicitly used Lemma 2.2 to pass from the expansion bound given by Lemma 4.5 to a mixing bound. Actually, we can do better using the following standard lemma, which allows for passing from congestion to mixing without a quadratic loss:  \n\nSuppose a uniform multicommodity flow f𝑓f exists in a graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) with congestion ρ𝜌\\rho, in which for every s,t∈V𝑠𝑡𝑉s,t\\in V, for some l>0𝑙0l>0, where Γs​tsubscriptΓ𝑠𝑡\\Gamma_{st} s the set of (simple) paths in G𝐺G from s𝑠s to t𝑡t, and where we use the shorthand fs​t​(P)subscript𝑓𝑠𝑡𝑃f_{st}(P) to denote the fraction of the s,t𝑠𝑡s,t commodity that f𝑓f sends along the path P𝑃P. Then the mixing time of the uniform random walk on G𝐺G is where d𝑑d is the maximum degree of G𝐺G. Then we obtain mixing time where l𝑙l is the maximum length of a path in the flow construction. It is not difficult to see that since the diameter of the projection graph is at most k𝑘k, we obtain a recurrence giving total mixing Notice that, as discussed in Remark 4.7, we did not incur a term γ/Δ𝛾Δ\\gamma/\\Delta in this calculation. Furthermore, it is not clear how one could avoid this γ/Δ=k𝛾Δ𝑘\\gamma/\\Delta=k factor using the spectral decomposition technique (Theorem 4.3). That technique would give a mixing bound of (Here we have ignored an additional log⁡|Ω|Ω\\log|\\Omega| term, as one might be able to reduce this term via, for instance, the log-Sobolev version of the Jerrum/Son/Tetali/Vigoda decomposition.)\nComparing the two expressions above shows that our technique gives an improvement of\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: k−1𝑘1k-1-ary plane trees is connected as follows: find a path from any given tree to a “spine,” where all internal nodes belong to a simple path via left children from the root to the leftmost leaf [ref]13.
