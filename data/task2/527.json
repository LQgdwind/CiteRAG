      "content": "Paper Title: NROWAN-DQN: A Stable Noisy Network with Noise Reduction and Online Weight Adjustment for Exploration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis paper involves the exploration field of reinforcement learning. Currently, the methods to solve the exploration problems mainly include heuristic algorithm, state-space modeling, curiosity mechanism, and stochastic method. Heuristic algorithm. Heuristic exploration can provide theoretical guarantees for agent performance. Thomas et al. proposed UCRL2, which achieves a (gap-dependent) regret bound that is logarithmic in learning step TùëáT ; With some optimistic assumptions, Mohammad et al. proposed UCBVI-BF, which applies a conncentration to the value as a whole and a recursive law of total variance to couple estimates across an episode. This has improved over the bound achieved by the UCRL2 algorithm ; Christoph et al. considered Episodic Fixed-Horizon MDPs, and proposed UCFH, which improves on previous bounds for episodic finite-horizon MDPs . State-space modeling. State-space modeling helps an agent to efficiently find states with more information. There are two ways to model state space. One way is the count-based exploration: Strehl et al. proposed a variation of Model-based Interval Estimation called MBIE-EB [ref]10; Haoran et al. mapped states to hash codes, accordingly applying count-based methods in high-dimensional state spaces [ref]39; Marc et al. proposed an algorithm for deriving a pseudo-count from an arbitrary density model, which can generalize count-based exploration algorithms to the non-tabular case . The other way is called states density modeling. These methods usually drive exploration by estimating state space density  [ref]12 . Curiosity mechanism. One kind of curiosity mechanism is generated based on the unknown information of the environment, such as Bayesian exploration in an unknown dynamic environment  and the theory based on the concept of maximizing intrinsic reward for active creation or discovery of new states . The other kind of curiosity mechanism focuses on prediction of future state, such as forming intrinsic rewards that approximate the KL-divergence of true transition probabilities from a learned model  and to formulate curiosity as the error in an agent‚Äôs ability to predict the consequence of its own actions in a visual feature space learned by a self-supervised inverse dynamics model . Stochastic method. Adding noises to the parameter domain rather than the action domain can lead to better exploration . Based on this principle, Fortunato  combined noisy networks with DQN, A3C  and DuelingNet ; Plappert et al. introduced parameter space noise to DQN, DDPG  and TRPO . Both of the above approaches deliver excellent performance. There are also some other novel methods about exploration. Houthooft et al. proposed an exploration strategy based on variational information maximization ; Xiong et al. and Adam et al. developed some reason-based exploration strategies, respectively  ; Target-based short trajectory exploration is also one of the novel methods  . These methods conduct effective exploration by disturbing target instead of disturbing action. Our method belongs to stochastic methodes for exploration. Based on NoisyNets, this paper advocates limiting noise level of the last layer of NoisyNets, and proposes the NROWAN-DQN algorithm. More specifically, this paper designs a differentiable online noise reduction mechanism. This mechanism can help agents form stable action policies based on parameter domain exploration. In addition, because the deterministic factor for reducing noise is differentiable, this mechanism can be perfectly combined with the learning process.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: states with more information.
