      "content": "Paper Title: Salient Feature Extractor for Adversarial Defense on Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComplete defense mainly develops in the following three directions: using modified input for training or testing and modifying network parameters or structure, e.g, adding more layers or changing loss function, and using add-on network for defense. In terms of modified training/input, Goodfellow et al. [ref]11 and Huang et al.  proposed adversarial training, in which adversarial examples were injected into the training set, enhancing the robustness of neural network towards adversarial examples. On this basis, Mummadi et al. [ref]30 adopted a new training set to finetune the target model by mixing a large number of adversarial and benign example pairs. Although adversarial training does effectively improve the robustness of the model, it only takes effect on specific attack method with high computation and time cost. Besides, image preprocessing also belongs to defense of input modification. Xie et al.  found that random resizing and padding of adversarial examples can weaken the strength of the attack. Prakash et al.  redistribute the pixel values in adversarial examples by pixel deflection, and then denoise them based on a wavelet, so as to effectively correct class labels. Image preprocessing methods are easy to operate but hard to deal with large perturbed adversarial examples. Zhang et al.  measured the distance between feature distribution of adversarial and benign examples using an optimal transport-based Wasserstein distance. By aligning feature representations, models are no longer easily fooled by a diversity of adversaries. Network modification mainly provides robustness by changing model structure, loss or activation function. Papernot et al. [ref]34 put forward defense distillation, which uses the knowledge of network to shape its own robustness, and proved that it can resist adversarial examples of small perturbation. Guneet S. Dhillon et al.  developed stochastic activation pruning (SAP) method, which prunes the random subset of the activation function and enlarges remaining ones to compensate. As a result, the model gains a certain defense ability against adversarial attacks while maintaining high classification accuracy. Pang et al.  minimized the reverse cross entropy in the process of training and proposed RCE, which improves the robustness of the model in the adversarial setting. Most of the network modification defense need to retrain the model, which decreases computational efficiency. Besides, training parameters closely related to defense effect should be carefully chosen to achieve expected results. The method of using network add-on enables the model to cope with adversarial examples with the help of one or more external models such as autoencoder, GAN or ensemble models. Hlihor et al.  adopted the DAE method to train the autoencoder to minimize the distance between adversarial and benign examples, so as to remove perturbations. Ju et al.  studied the neural network ensemble method Ens-D for image recognition task. The ensemble of multiple models can still make robust classification when one of them is hacked. Besides, GAN is introduced to defend against adversarial attacks as well, which will be detailed in Section 2.3.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: testing and modifying network parameters or structure, e.g, adding more layers or changing loss function, and using add-on network for defense.
