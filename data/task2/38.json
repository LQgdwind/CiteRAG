      "content": "Paper Title: TVR: A Large-Scale Dataset for Video-Subtitle Moment Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe goal of natural language-based moment retrieval is to retrieve relevant moments from a single video¬†[ref]14 [ref]9 or from a large video corpus¬†[ref]8.\nIn the following, we present a brief overview of the community efforts on these tasks and make distinctions between existing works and ours. Datasets.\nSeveral datasets have been proposed for the task, e.g., DiDeMo¬†[ref]14, ActivityNet Captions¬†, CharadesSTA¬†[ref]9, and TACoS¬†, where queries can be localized solely from video.\nTVR differs from them by requiring additional text (subtitle) information in localizing the queries.\nTwo types of data annotation have been explored in previous works:\n(iùëñi) uniformly chunking videos into segments and letting an annotator pick one (or more) and write an unambiguous description¬†[ref]14.\nFor example, moments in DiDeMo¬†[ref]14 are created from fixed 5-second segments.\nHowever, such coarse temporal annotations are not well aligned with natural moments.\nIn TVR, temporal windows are freely selected to more accurately capture important moments.\n(i‚Äãiùëñùëñii) converting a paragraph written for a whole video into separate query sentences¬† [ref]9 .\nWhile it is natural for people to use temporal connectives (e.g., ‚Äòfirst‚Äô, ‚Äòthen‚Äô) and anaphora (e.g., pronouns)¬† in a paragraph, these words make individual sentences less suitable as retrieval queries.\nIn comparison, the TVR annotation process encourages annotators to write queries individually without requiring the context of a paragraph.\nBesides, TVR also has a larger size and greater linguistic diversity, see Sec.¬†3.2. Methods.\nExisting works¬†[ref]14 [ref]9    [ref]8 pose moment retrieval as ranking a predefined set of moment proposals.\nThese proposals are typically generated with handcrafted rules¬†[ref]14  or sliding windows¬†[ref]9   [ref]8.\nTypically, such proposals are not temporally precise and are not scalable to long videos due to high computational cost.¬†[ref]9   alleviate the first with a regression branch that offsets the proposals. However, they are still restricted by the coarseness of the initial proposals.\nInspired by span predictors in reading comprehension¬†  and action localization¬†, we use start-end predictors to predict start-end probabilities from early fused query-video representations.\nThough these methods can be more flexibly applied to long videos and have shown promising performance on single video moment retrieval, the time cost of early fusion becomes unbearable when dealing with the corpus level moment retrieval problem: they require early fusing every possible query-video pair¬†[ref]8.\nProposal based approaches MCN¬†[ref]14 and CAL¬†[ref]8 use a late fusion design, in which the video representations can be pre-computed and stored, making the retrieval more efficient.\nThe final moment predictions are then made by ranking the Squared Euclidean Distances between the proposals w.r.t. a given query.\nHowever, as they rely on predefined proposals, MCN and CAL still suffer from the aforementioned drawbacks, leading to less precise predictions and higher costs (especially for long videos).\nRecent works¬†  9 consider word-level early fusion with the videos, which can be even more expensive.\nIn contrast, XML uses a late fusion design with a novel Convolutional Start-End (ConvSE) detector, which produces more accurate moment predictions while reducing the computational cost.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: The goal of natural language-based moment retrieval is to retrieve relevant moments from a single video¬†[ref]14 [ref]9 or from a large video corpus¬†[ref]8.\nIn the following, we present a brief overview of the community efforts on these tasks and make distinctions between existing works and ours.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
