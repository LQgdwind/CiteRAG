      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Background and Main Contributions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince its importance was first recognized in the 1970s, the nondeterministic polynomial-time complexity class NPNP\\mathrm{NP} has been a centerfold of intensive research on the field of computer science for decades. The complexity of NPNP\\mathrm{NP} problems are generally measured in terms of the behaviors of underlying nondeterministic Turing machines (NTMs) that solve them in polynomial time. Another significant method in measuring the complexity of NPNP\\mathrm{NP} problems is given, from a completely distinct perspective, by logical expressibility of how to express a given problem using only logical symbols (i.e., variables, connectives, quantifiers, etc.).\nIn this respect, Papadimitriou and Yannakakis  and Feder and Vardi   studied a logically-expressed subclass of NPNP\\mathrm{NP}, known as SNPSNP\\mathrm{SNP}, to capture a certain aspect of nondeterministic polynomial-time computation\nin terms of second-order logical sentences starting with a second-order existential quantifier followed by a first-order universal quantifier\n(with no use of the first-order existential quantifiers).\nThis complexity class SNPSNP\\mathrm{SNP} turns out to play an important role in promoting the better understanding of the syntactic expressibility of capturing nondeterministic polynomial-time computing.\nLet us consider k​SAT𝑘SATk\\mathrm{SAT}, which is the collection of satisfiable Boolean formulas of k𝑘k-conjunctive normal form (k𝑘kCNF).\nAs Impagliazzo and Paturi  demonstrated, k​SAT𝑘SATk\\mathrm{SAT} is complete for SNPSNP\\mathrm{SNP} under so-called SERF reductions. This can be compared to the fact that k​SAT𝑘SATk\\mathrm{SAT} is complete for NPNP\\mathrm{NP} under polynomial-time many-one reductions. Space bounded computation is another important resource-bounded computation in theory and also in practice.\nIn this work, our special attention goes to such space-bounded computation. In particular, we focus on the nondeterministic logarithmic space-bounded complexity class NLNL\\mathrm{NL}.\nTypical NLNL\\mathrm{NL} decision problems include the 2CNF formula satisfiability problem (2​S​A​T2SAT\\mathrm{2SAT}) and the directed s𝑠s-t𝑡t connectivity problem (DSTCONDSTCON\\mathrm{DSTCON}). Interestingly, numerous properties that have been proven for NLNL\\mathrm{NL} seem quite different from those for NPNP\\mathrm{NP}. For instance, NLNL\\mathrm{NL} is closed under complementation [ref]9  whereas NPNP\\mathrm{NP} is speculated not to be closed under the same set operation. Analogous to SNPSNP\\mathrm{SNP}, in due course of a study on parameterized decision problems, a “syntactically”-defined natural subclass of NLNL\\mathrm{NL} dubbed as Syntactic NL (or succinctly, SNL) and its variant SNLωsubscriptSNL𝜔\\mathrm{SNL}_{\\omega} were introduced in  based on restricted forms of second-order sentences starting with second-order “functional” existential quantifiers. (For their detailed definitions, refer to Section 2.2.)\nIn particular, the parameterized complexity class para​-​SNLpara-SNL\\mathrm{para}\\mbox{-}\\mathrm{SNL} (and para​-​SNLωpara-subscriptSNL𝜔\\mathrm{para}\\mbox{-}\\mathrm{SNL}_{\\omega}) has played a key role in the theory of sub-linear space computation. The complexity class para​-​SNLpara-SNL\\mathrm{para}\\mbox{-}\\mathrm{SNL} naturally contains a “parameterized” version of NLNL\\mathrm{NL}-complete problem, known as the directed s𝑠s-t𝑡t connectivity problem of degree at most 333 (3​D​S​T​C​O​N3DSTCON3\\mathrm{DSTCON}), and para​-​SNLωpara-subscriptSNL𝜔\\mathrm{para}\\mbox{-}\\mathrm{SNL}_{\\omega} contains a “parameterized” version of its variant, called\nexact3DSTCONexact3DSTCON\\mathrm{exact3DSTCON}, whose input graphs are restricted to vertices of degree exactly 333 .\nNotice that para​-​SNLω⊆para​-​SNL⊆para​-​NLpara-subscriptSNL𝜔para-SNLpara-NL\\mathrm{para}\\mbox{-}\\mathrm{SNL}_{\\omega}\\subseteq\\mathrm{para}\\mbox{-}\\mathrm{SNL}\\subseteq\\mathrm{para}\\mbox{-}\\mathrm{NL}.\nIn particular, para​-​SNLωpara-subscriptSNL𝜔\\mathrm{para}\\mbox{-}\\mathrm{SNL}_{\\omega} is closely related to\na practical working hypothesis, known as the linear space hypothesis (LSH), which was introduced also in  and further developed in, e.g.,     .\nThis LSH is regarded as a log-space analogue of the exponential time hypothesis\n(ETH) and the strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH) of  .\nUnder LSH, we can obtain L≠NLLNL\\mathrm{L}\\neq\\mathrm{NL}, LOGDCFL≠LOGCFLLOGDCFLLOGCFL\\mathrm{LOGDCFL}\\neq\\mathrm{LOGCFL}, and SC≠NSCSCNSC\\mathrm{SC}\\neq\\mathrm{NSC} . Up to now, little is known for the properties of SNLSNL\\mathrm{SNL} and SNLωsubscriptSNL𝜔\\mathrm{SNL}_{\\omega}, and their parameterized versions para​-​SNLpara-SNL\\mathrm{para}\\mbox{-}\\mathrm{SNL} and para​-​SNLωpara-subscriptSNL𝜔\\mathrm{para}\\mbox{-}\\mathrm{SNL}_{\\omega}. The primary purpose of this work is therefore to explore their properties, particularly restricted to the framework of non-parameterized decision problems by setting m∥​(x)=|x|subscript𝑚∥𝑥𝑥m_{\\|}(x)=|x| as a size parameter for inputs x𝑥x in order to make it easier to compare between the properties of SNLSNL\\mathrm{SNL} and those of SNPSNP\\mathrm{SNP}.\nFor this purpose, we further study natural variants of SNLSNL\\mathrm{SNL} in a way similar to the study of SNPSNP\\mathrm{SNP} in the literature. In the polynomial-time setting, nonetheless, an optimization version of SNPSNP\\mathrm{SNP}, called MAXSNPMAXSNP\\mathrm{MAXSNP}, was discussed in 1991 by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis  in a discussion of the development of fast approximation algorithms. Notably, they showed that all optimization problems in MAXSNPMAXSNP\\mathrm{MAXSNP} can be approximated in polynomial time within a certain fixed ratio.\nThey also demonstrated that many of the typical NPNP\\mathrm{NP} optimization problems, including MAX​-​2​S​A​TMAX-2SAT\\mathrm{MAX}\\mbox{-}\\mathrm{2SAT} and MAX​-​CUTMAX-CUT\\mathrm{MAX}\\mbox{-}\\mathrm{CUT}, are in fact complete for MAXSNPMAXSNP\\mathrm{MAXSNP} under polynomial-time linear reductions.\n(Later in this work, we show that they\nare complete even under log-space AP-reductions.)\nBy taking a similar approach, it is possible to study an optimization version of SNLSNL\\mathrm{SNL}, which we intend to call by MAXSNLMAXSNL\\mathrm{MAXSNL}. One may wonder what similarities and differences lay between MAXSNLMAXSNL\\mathrm{MAXSNL} and MAXSNPMAXSNP\\mathrm{MAXSNP}. As another variant of SNPSNP\\mathrm{SNP}, in the polynomial-time setting, Feder and Vardi   studied natural subclasses of SNPSNP\\mathrm{SNP} in hopes of proving the so-called dichotomy theorem, which asserts that all problems in a target complexity class are either in PP\\mathrm{P} or NPNP\\mathrm{NP}-complete. In particular, they considered\nthree restricted subclasses of SNP, namely, monotone SNP, monotone monadic SNP with disequalities, and monadic SNP. Monotone monadic SNP (MMSNP), for example, is shown to be polynomially equivalent to constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).\nIn a general setting, nevertheless, Schaefer  proved that the class of CSPs on the two element domain enjoys the dichotomy theorem.\nA similar approach can be taken to introduce the monotone SNLSNL\\mathrm{SNL} (MonoSNL) and study its fundamental properties in comparison with MMSNPMMSNP\\mathrm{MMSNP}.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: Interestingly, numerous properties that have been proven for NLNL\\mathrm{NL} seem quite different from those for NPNP\\mathrm{NP}.
