      "content": "Paper Title: On the Formalization of the Notion of an Algorithm\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn many works from the mathematical and computer science literature,\nincluding standard works such as   [ref]18 , the\nnotion of an algorithm is informally characterized by properties that\nare considered the most important ones of an algorithm.\nMost of those characterizations agree with each other and indicate that\nan algorithm is considered to express a pattern of behaviour by which\nall instances of a computational problem can be solved.\nA remark like “Formally, an algorithm is a Turing machine” is often\nmade in the works concerned if additionally Turing machines are\nrigorously defined. However, the viewpoint that the formal notion of a Turing machine is a\nformalization of the intuitive notion of an algorithm is unsatisfactory\nin at least two ways:\n(a) a Turing machine expresses primarily a way in which a computational\nproblem-solving pattern of behaviour can be generated and\n(b) a Turing machine restricts the data involved in such a pattern of\nbehaviour to strings over some finite set of symbols.\nThere are not many alternative formalizations of the notion of an\nalgorithm that are regularly cited.\nTo the best of my knowledge, the main exceptions are the ones that can\nbe found in  .\nIn both papers, a notion of an algorithm is formally defined that does\nnot depend on a particular machine model such as the Turing machine\nmodel. In , an algorithm is defined as a fairly complex\nset-theoretic object.\nThe definition has its origins in the idea that, if a partial function\nis defined recursively by a system of equations, that system of\nequations induces an algorithm.\nAn algorithm according to this definition fails to have many properties\nthat are generally considered to belong to the most important ones of an\nalgorithm. In , an algorithm is defined as an object that satisfies\ncertain postulates.\nThe postulates concerned appear to be devised with the purpose that\nGurevich’s abstract state machines would satisfy them.\nHowever, this definition covers objects that have almost all properties\nthat are generally considered to belong to the most important ones of an\nalgorithm as well as more abstract objects that have almost none of\nthose properties. What is mentioned above about the formalizations of the concept of\nalgorithm in   makes them unsatisfactory as well.\nThis state of affairs motivated me to start a quest for a formalization\nof the notion of an algorithm that is more satisfactory than the\nexisting ones.\nOne possibility is to investigate whether this can be done by adapting\nthe postulates from  or adding postulates to them.\nAnother possibility is to investigate whether a constructive definition\ncan be given.\nThis is what will be done in this paper.\nIn addition, the connection between the resulting objects and the\nprocesses considered in the imperative process algebra presented\nin  will be investigated. In , I made a first attempt to give a constructive\ndefinition.\nThe main drawback of the approach followed there is that the data\ninvolved in an algorithm is restricted to bit strings.\nThe idea was that this restriction could be discarded without much\neffort.\nThis turned out not to be the case.\nTherefore, I follow a different approach in this paper. Cliff Jones’ Vienna Development Method (VDM) [Jon90a] is one of the\nmost impactful program development methods based on formal specification\nand verified design.\nThe notion of an algorithm is a central notion in the field of\ncomputational complexity.\nIn this field, little attention is paid to formal specification of\ncomputational problems and verified design of algorithms that solve them\ncorrectly.\nIt seems that VDM can fill this gap: a computational problem corresponds\nto an operation in VDM, and data reification and operation decomposition\nsteps in VDM ultimately yield a result that expresses an algorithm that\ncorrectly solves the problem.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: In many works from the mathematical and computer science literature,\nincluding standard works such as   [ref]18 , the\nnotion of an algorithm is informally characterized by properties that\nare considered the most important ones of an algorithm.\nMost of those characterizations agree with each other and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
