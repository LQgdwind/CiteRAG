      "content": "Paper Title: Space-Time Continuous PDE Forecasting using Equivariant Neural Fields\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPartial Differential Equations (PDEs) are a foundational tool in modelling and understanding spatio-temporal dynamics across diverse scientific domains. Classically, PDEs are solved using numerical methods such as finite elements, finite volumes, or spectral methods. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) methods have emerged as promising alternatives due to abundance of observed and simulated data as well as the accessibility to computational resources, with applications ranging from fluid simulations and weather modelling 9  to biology . The systems modelled by PDEs often have underlying symmetries. For example, heat diffusion or fluid dynamics can be modeled with differential operators which are rotation equivariant, e.g., given a solution to the system of PDEs, its rotation is also a valid solution 111Assuming boundary conditions are symmetric, i.e. they transform according to the relevant group action.. In such scenarios it is sensible, and even desirable, to design neural networks that incorporate and preserve such symmetries to improve generalization and data-efficiency   . Crucially, DL-based approaches often rely on data sampled on a regular grid, without the inherent ability to generalize outside of it, which is restrictive in many scenarios . To this end, 9 propose to use Neural Fields (NeFs) for modelling and forecasting PDE dynamics. This is done by fitting a neural ODE [ref]11 to the conditioning variables of a conditional Neural Field trained to reconstruct states of the PDE [ref]13. However, this approach fails to leverage aforementioned known symmetries of the system. Furthermore, using neural fields as representations has proved difficult due to the non-linear nature of neural networks [ref]13  4, limiting performance in more challenging settings. We posit that NeF-based modelling of PDE dynamics benefits from representations that account for the symmetries of the system as this allows for introducing inductive biases into the model that ought to be reflected in solutions. Furthermore, we show that through meta-learning  4 the NeF backbone improves performance for complex PDEs by further structuring the NeF’s latent space, simplifying the task of the neural ODE. We introduce a framework for space-time continuous equivariant PDE solving, by adapting a class of SE​(n)SEn\\mathrm{SE(n)}-Equivariant Neural Fields (ENFs) to PDE-specific symmetries. We leverage the ENF as representation for modelling spatiotemporal dynamics. We solve PDEs by learning a flow in the latent space of the ENF - starting at a point z0subscript𝑧0z_{0} corresponding to the initial state of the PDE - with an equivariant graph-based neural ODE [ref]11 we develop from previous work . We extend the ENF to equivariances beyond SE​(n)SEn\\mathrm{SE(n)}, by extending its weight-sharing scheme to equivalance classes for specific symmetries relevant to our setting. Furthermore, we show how meta-learning   4 [ref]13, can not only significantly reduce inference time of the proposed framework, but also substantially simplify the structure of the latent space of the ENF, thereby simplifying the learning process of the latent dynamics for the neural ODE model. We present the following contributions: We introduce a framework for spatio-temporally continuous PDE solving that respects known symmetries of the PDE through equivariance constraints. We show that correctly chosen equivariance constraints as inductive bias improves performance of the solver - in terms of MSE - in spatio-temporally continuous settings, i.e. evaluated off the training grid and beyond the training horizon. We show how meta-learning improves the structure of the latent space of the ENF, simplifying the learning process, leading to better performance in solving PDEs. We structure the paper as follows: in Sec. 2 we provide an overview of the mathematical preliminaries and describe the problem setting. Our proposed framework is introduced in Sec. 3. We validate our framework on different PDEs defined over a variety of geometries in Sec. 4, with differing equivariance constraints, showing competitive performance over other neural PDE solvers.We provide an in-depth positioning of our approach in relation to other work in Appx.
