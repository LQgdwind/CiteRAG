      "content": "Paper Title: Selective Learning: Towards Robust Calibration with Dynamic Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we describe the experimental setup including the used experimental datasets, evaluation metrics, experimental settings and comparison methods. Datasets. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets with potential challenging samples in the training or test dataset, including CIFAR-8-2, CIFAR-80-20 , Food101 , Camelyon17  [ref]45, and ImageNetBG . The datasets used in the experiments are described in detail here. CIFAR-8-2: The CIFAR-8-2 dataset is artificially constructed to evaluate the performance of the model when the fraction of challenging samples in the dataset is available. Specifically, we randomly select 8 classes from CIFAR10  as in-distribution samples, while the remaining samples are randomly relabeled as one of the selected classes to serve as challenging samples beyond capability of the model. Then the fraction Œ∑ùúÇ\\eta of the CIFAR-8-2 dataset is about 20%. CIFAR-80-20: Samilar as CIFAR-8-2, we randomly select 80 classes from CIFAR100  dataset, and relabel other samples as one of the selected classes to serve as challenging samples (outliers). The true challenging samples fraction Œ∑ùúÇ\\eta of the CIFAR-80-20 dataset is about 20%. Camelyon17: Camelyon17 is a pathology image dataset containing over 450,000 lymph node scans from 5 different hospitals, used for detecting cancerous tissues in images . Similar to previous work [ref]45, we take part of the data from 3 hospitals as the training set. The remaining data from these 3 hospitals, together with data from another hospital, are used as the validation set. The last hospital is used as a challenging test set with distributional shift samples. Notably, due to differences in pathology staining methods between hospitals, even data within the same hospital can be seen as sampled from multiple subpopulations. We verify on the Camelyon17 dataset whether models can achieve more robust generalization performance when the training set contains multiple subgroups. ImageNetBG: ImageNetBG is a benchmark dataset for evaluating the dependence of classifiers on image backgrounds . It consists of a 9-class subset of ImageNet (ImageNet-9) and provides bounding boxes that allow removing the background. Similar as in previous settings , we train models on the original IN-9L (with background) set, adjust hyperparameters based on validation accuracy, and evaluate not only on the test set (in-distribution data), but also on the MIXED-RAND, NO-FG and ONLY-FG test set (challenging samples). Food101: Food101 is a commonly used food classification dataset containing 101 food categories with a total of 101,000 images . For each category, there are 750 training images and 250 manually verified test images. The training images are intentionally unclean and contain some amount of noise, primarily in the form of intense colors and occasionally wrong labels, which can be seen as challenging samples in the training dataset. Evaluation metrics. Following the standard metrics used in previous works  [ref]48, we evaluate the performance from three perspectives: (1) the accuracy (ACC) on the test set; (2) ordinal ranking based confidence evaluation, including area under the risk coverage curve (AURC), excess-AURC (EAURC) , false positive rate when the true positive rate is 95% (FPR95%TPR), and area under precision-recall curve with incorrectly classified examples as the positive class (AUPRErr) [ref]48; (3) calibration-based confidence evaluation, including expected calibration error (ECE) , the Brier score (Brier)  and negative log likelihood (NLL). For datasets where the test set consists of a mixture of in-distribution and challenging samples, we show both the performance on all test samples and the performance on only challenging samples. For the CIFAR-8-2 and CIFAR-80-20 datasets, since the labels of the challenging samples are set randomly, we only report the calibration-based confidence evaluation metrics.\nThe evaluation metrics used in the experiments are described in detail here. AURC and EAURC: The AURC is defined as the area under the risk-coverage curve , where risk represents the error rate and coverage refers to the proportion of samples with confidence estimates exceeding a specified confidence threshold. A lower AURC indicates that correct and incorrect samples can be effectively separated based on the confidence of the samples. However, AURC is influenced by the predictive performance of the model. To allow for meaningful comparisons across models with different performance, Excess-AURC (E-AURC) is proposed by  by subtracting the optimal AURC (the minimum possible value for a given model) from the empirical AURC. AUPRErr: AUPRErr represents the area under the precision-recall curve where misclassified samples (i.e., incorrect predictions) are used as positive examples. This metric can evaluate the capability of the error detector to distinguish between incorrect and correct samples. A higher AUPRErr usually indicates better error detection performance [ref]48. FPR95%TPR: The FPR95%TPR metric measures the false positive rate (FPR) when the true positive rate (TPR) is fixed at 95%. This metric can be interpreted as the probability that an incorrect prediction is mistakenly categorized as a correct prediction, when the TPR is set to 95%. ECE: The Expected Calibration Error (ECE) provides a measure of the alignment between the predicted confidence scores and labels. It partitions the confidence sores into multiple equally spaced intervals, computes the difference between accuracy and average confidence in each interval, and then aggregates the results weighted by the number of samples. Lower ECE usually indicates better calibration. NLL: The Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) measures the log loss between the predicted probabilities and the one-hot label encodings. Lower NLL corresponds to higher likelihood of the predictions fitting the true distribution. Brier: The Brier score calculates the mean squared error between the predicted probabilities and the one-hot label. Experimental settings.\nSince data augmentation has been widely applied during the training of deep neural networks and has achieved remarkable performance, we perform experiments under two different settings including standard setting and strong augmentation setting to validate the effectiveness of DReg. In this way, we can fully explore how challenging samples introduced by augmentation techniques affect the calibration methods. Specifically, under the standard setting, same as standard setup of deep neural network training  , we employ basic augmentation methods such as random cropping and image flipping. Moreover, under the strong augmentation setting, we use random augmentation  and cutout  augmentation methods. For all methods, under the exactly same setting, we tune the hyperparameters based on the accuracy of validation set and run over three times to report the means and standard deviations. For the CIFAR-8-2 and CIFAR-80-20 datasets, we use a randomly initialized WideResNet-28-10  as the backbone network; for the Camelyon17 dataset, we use a DenseNet-121  network pre-trained on ImageNet as the backbone network; for other datasets, we use a ResNet-50  network pre-trained on ImageNet as the backbone network. For all methods, we adjust the hyperparameters according to the performance on the validation set to obtain the best accuracy, and report other corresponding metrics. Comparison methods. We conduct comparative experiments with multiple baseline methods, including empirical risk minimization (ERM), penalizing confidence (PC) , label smoothing (LS) , focal loss (FL) [ref]7, sample dependent focal loss (FLSD) [ref]7,\ninverse focal loss (IFL) ,\ndual focal loss . Besides we conduct ablation study by removing challenging samples with high probability (RC) during training. The Comparison methods are described in detail here. ERM trains the model by minimizing empirical risk on the training data, utilizing cross-entropy as the loss function. PC trains the model with cross-entropy loss while regularizing the neural networks by penalizing low-entropy predictions. LS is a regularization technique that trains the neural network with softened target labels. FLSD refers to a sample-dependent focal loss, where the hyperparameters of the focal loss are set differently for samples with varying confidence scores [ref]7. FL refers to focal loss, which implicitly regularizes the deep neural network by increasing the weight of samples with larger losses. IFL implements a simple modification to the weighting term of the original focal loss by assigning larger weights to samples with higher output confidences. DFL aims to achieve a better balance between over-confidence and under-confidence by maximizing the gap between the ground truth logit and the highest-ranked logit after the ground truth logit. RC: We conduct ablation studies by removing potential challenging samples beyond the capability of the model during training. Specifically, during training, given BùêµB samples, we directly drop the top Œ∑‚ÄãBùúÇùêµ\\eta B samples with the highest losses, where Œ∑ùúÇ\\eta is the predefined fraction of challenging samples.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: methods.
