      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Domain Invariant Representations in Goal-conditioned Block MDPs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn a seminal work, Ben-David et al. [ref]21 shows it is possible to bound the error of a classifier trained on a source domain on a target domain with a different data distribution. Follow-up work extends the theory to the domain generalization setting [ref]22 . In GBMDP, we can also derive similar theory to characterize the generalization from training environments ℰtrainsubscriptℰtrain{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\text{train}} to target test environment t𝑡t. The theory relies on the Total Variation Distance DTVsubscript𝐷TVD_{\\text{TV}}  of two policies π1,π2subscript𝜋1subscript𝜋2\\pi_{1},\\pi_{2} with input (xe,g)superscript𝑥𝑒𝑔(x^{e},g), which is defined as follows. In the following statements, we denote ρ​(x,g)𝜌𝑥𝑔\\rho(x,g) as some joint distributions of goals and observations that g∼𝒢similar-to𝑔𝒢g\\sim{\\mathcal{G}} and x𝑥x is determined by ρ​(x|g)𝜌conditional𝑥𝑔\\rho(x|g). Additionally, we use ρπe​(xe|g)superscriptsubscript𝜌𝜋𝑒conditionalsuperscript𝑥𝑒𝑔\\rho_{\\pi}^{e}(x^{e}|g) to denote the discounted occupancy measure of xesuperscript𝑥𝑒x^{e} in environment e𝑒e under policy π(⋅|xe,g)\\pi(\\cdot|x^{e},g) and refer ρπe​(xe)superscriptsubscript𝜌𝜋𝑒superscript𝑥𝑒\\rho_{\\pi}^{e}(x^{e}) as the marginal distribution. Furthermore, we denote ϵρ​(x,g)​(π1∥π2)superscriptitalic-ϵ𝜌𝑥𝑔conditionalsubscript𝜋1subscript𝜋2\\epsilon^{\\rho(x,g)}(\\pi_{1}\\parallel\\pi_{2}) as the average DTVsubscript𝐷TVD_{\\text{TV}} between π1subscript𝜋1\\pi_{1} and π2subscript𝜋2\\pi_{2}, i.e., ϵρ​(x,g)(π1∥π2)=𝔼ρ​(x,g)[DTV(π1(⋅|x,g)∥π2(⋅|x,g))]\\epsilon^{\\rho(x,g)}(\\pi_{1}\\parallel\\pi_{2})=\\mathbb{E}_{\\rho(x,g)}[D_{\\text{TV}}(\\pi_{1}(\\cdot|x,g)\\parallel\\pi_{2}(\\cdot|x,g))]. This quantity is crucial in our theory as it can characterize the performance gap between two policies (see Appendix C). Then, similar to the famous ℋ​Δ​ℋℋΔℋ{\\mathcal{H}}\\Delta{\\mathcal{H}}-divergence [ref]21 [ref]22 in domain adaptation theory, we define Π​Δ​ΠΠΔΠ\\Pi\\Delta\\Pi-divergence of two joint distributions ρ​(x,g)𝜌𝑥𝑔\\rho(x,g) and ρ​(x,g)′𝜌superscript𝑥𝑔′\\rho(x,g)^{\\prime} in terms of the policy class ΠΠ\\Pi: On one hand, dΠ​Δ​Πsubscript𝑑ΠΔΠd_{\\Pi\\Delta\\Pi} is a distance metric which reflects the distance between two distributions w.r.t function class ΠΠ\\Pi. On the other hand, if we fix these two distributions, it also reveals the quality of the function class ΠΠ\\Pi, i.e., smaller dΠ​Δ​Πsubscript𝑑ΠΔΠd_{\\Pi\\Delta\\Pi} means more invariance to the distribution change. Finally, we state the following Proposition in which πGsubscript𝜋𝐺\\pi_{G} is some optimal and invariant policy. For any π∈Π𝜋Π\\pi\\in\\Pi, we consider the occupancy measure {ρπei​(xei,g)}i=1Nsuperscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝜌𝜋subscript𝑒𝑖superscript𝑥subscript𝑒𝑖𝑔𝑖1𝑁\\{\\rho_{\\pi}^{e_{i}}(x^{e_{i}},g)\\}_{i=1}^{N} for training environments and ρπGt​(xt,g)superscriptsubscript𝜌subscript𝜋𝐺𝑡superscript𝑥𝑡𝑔\\rho_{\\pi_{G}}^{t}(x^{t},g) for the target environment. For simplicity, we use ϵeisuperscriptitalic-ϵsubscript𝑒𝑖\\epsilon^{e_{i}} as the abbreviation of ϵρπei​(xei,g)superscriptitalic-ϵsuperscriptsubscript𝜌𝜋subscript𝑒𝑖superscript𝑥subscript𝑒𝑖𝑔\\epsilon^{\\rho_{\\pi}^{e_{i}}(x^{e_{i}},g)}, ϵtsuperscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡\\epsilon^{t} as ϵρπGt​(xt,g)superscriptitalic-ϵsuperscriptsubscript𝜌subscript𝜋𝐺𝑡superscript𝑥𝑡𝑔\\epsilon^{\\rho_{\\pi_{G}}^{t}(x^{t},g)} and δ=maxei,ei′∈ℰtrain⁡dΠ​Δ​Π​(ρπei​(xei,g),ρπei′​(xei′,g))𝛿subscriptsubscript𝑒𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑒𝑖′subscriptℰtrainsubscript𝑑ΠΔΠsuperscriptsubscript𝜌𝜋subscript𝑒𝑖superscript𝑥subscript𝑒𝑖𝑔superscriptsubscript𝜌𝜋superscriptsubscript𝑒𝑖′superscript𝑥superscriptsubscript𝑒𝑖′𝑔\\delta=\\max_{e_{i},e_{i}^{\\prime}\\in{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\text{train}}}d_{\\Pi\\Delta\\Pi}(\\rho_{\\pi}^{e_{i}}(x^{e_{i}},g),\\rho_{\\pi}^{e_{i}^{\\prime}}(x^{e_{i}^{\\prime}},g)). Let Then, we have where B𝐵B is a characteristic set of joint distributions determined by ℰtrainsubscriptℰtrain{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\text{train}} and policy class ΠΠ\\Pi. The formal statement and the proof are shown in Appendix C.2. Generally speaking, the first term of the right hand side in Eq. (2) quantifies the performance of π𝜋\\pi in the N𝑁N training environments. λ𝜆\\lambda quantifies the optimality of the policy class ΠΠ\\Pi over all environments. δ𝛿\\delta reflects how the policy class ΠΠ\\Pi can reflect the difference among {ρπei​(xei,g),ei∈ℰtrain}subscriptsuperscript𝜌subscript𝑒𝑖𝜋superscript𝑥subscript𝑒𝑖𝑔subscript𝑒𝑖subscriptℰtrain\\{\\rho^{e_{i}}_{\\pi}(x^{e_{i}},g),e_{i}\\in{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\text{train}}\\}, which should be small if the policy class is invariant. The last term characterizes the distance between training environment and target environment and will be small if the training environments are diversely distributed. Many works on domain generalization of supervised learning [ref]21  [ref]22  [ref]26 spend much effort in discussing the trade-offs among different terms similar to the ones in Eq. (2), e.g., minimizing δ𝛿\\delta may increase λ𝜆\\lambda [ref]26, and in developing sophisticated techniques to optimize the bound, e.g. distribution matching    or adversarial learning . Different from their perspectives, in GBMDPs, we propose a simple but effective criteria to minimize the bound. From now on, we only consider the policy class Π=ΠΦ={w​(Φ​(x),g),∀w}ΠsubscriptΠΦ𝑤Φ𝑥𝑔for-all𝑤\\Pi=\\Pi_{\\Phi}=\\{w(\\Phi(x),g),\\forall w\\}. Usually, ΦΦ\\Phi will be referred as an encoder which maps x∈𝒳ℰ𝑥superscript𝒳ℰx\\in{\\mathcal{X}}^{{\\mathcal{E}}} to some latent representation z=Φ​(x)𝑧Φ𝑥z=\\Phi(x). We will also use the notation z​(s)=Φ​(x​(s))𝑧𝑠Φ𝑥𝑠z(s)=\\Phi(x(s)) if we do not emphasize on the specific environment. An encoder is called a perfect alignment encoder ΦΦ\\Phi w.r.t environment set E𝐸E if ∀e,e′∈Efor-all𝑒superscript𝑒′𝐸\\forall e,e^{\\prime}\\in E and ∀s,s′∈𝒮for-all𝑠superscript𝑠′𝒮\\forall s,s^{\\prime}\\in{\\mathcal{S}}, Φ​(xe​(s))=Φ​(xe′​(s′))Φsuperscript𝑥𝑒𝑠Φsuperscript𝑥superscript𝑒′superscript𝑠′\\Phi(x^{e}(s))=\\Phi(x^{e^{\\prime}}(s^{\\prime})) if and only if s=s′𝑠superscript𝑠′s=s^{\\prime}. As illustrated in Figure 5, an encoder is in perfect alignment if it maps two observations of the same underlying state s𝑠s to the same latent encoding z​(s)𝑧𝑠z(s) while also preventing meaningless embedding, i.e., mapping observations of different states to the same z𝑧z. We believe perfect alignment plays an important role in domain generalization for goal-conditioned RL agents. Specifically, it can minimize the bound of Eq. (2) as follows. If the encoder ΦΦ\\Phi is a perfect alignment over ℰtrainsubscriptℰtrain{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\text{train}}, then where ρ~​(x,g)~𝜌𝑥𝑔\\tilde{\\rho}(x,g) and π∗superscript𝜋\\pi^{*} are defined in Proposition 1 (also Appendix C). In Appendix C.3, we formally prove Proposition 2 when ΦΦ\\Phi is a (η,ψ)𝜂𝜓(\\eta,\\psi)-perfect alignment, i.e., ΦΦ\\Phi is only near perfect alignment. The proof shows that the generalization error bound is minimized on the R.H.S of Eq. (3) when ΦΦ\\Phi asymptotically becomes an exact perfect alignment encoder. Therefore, in our following method, we aim to learn a perfect alignment encoder via aligned sampling (Section 3.2). For the remaining terms in the R.H.S of Eq. (3), we find it hard to quantify them task agnostically, as similar difficulties also exist in the domain generalization theory of supervised learning [ref]22. Fortunately, we can derive upper bounds for the remaining terms under certain assumptions and we observe that these upper bounds are significantly reduced via our method in the experiments (Section 4). The (E)𝐸(E) term represents how well the learnt policy π𝜋\\pi approximates the optimal invariant policy on the training environments and is reduced to almost zero via RL (Table 1). For the (t)𝑡(t) term, we show that an upper bound of (t)𝑡(t) is proportion to the invariant quality of ΦΦ\\Phi on the target environment. Moreover, we find that learning a perfect alignment encoder over ℰtrainsubscriptℰtrain{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\text{train}} empirically improves the invariant quality over other unseen environments (t𝑡t) (Figure 4). Thus, this (t)𝑡(t) term upperbound is reduced by learning perfect alignment. Please refer to Appendix C.4 for more details. Based on the theory we derived in this subsection, we adopt perfect alignment as the heuristic to address GBMDPs in our work. In the following subsections, we propose a practical method to acquire a perfect alignment encoder over the training environments.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: In a seminal work, Ben-David et al.
