      "content": "Paper Title: Scene Recognition with Objectness, Attribute and Category Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nScene recognition, a.k.a, scene categorization, aims to determine the overall scene category (e.g., beach, kitchen, airport) by laying an emphasis on understanding its global properties  [ref]2. It is a high-level computer vision task that allows definition of context for object recognition. Whereas tremendous progress in object detection and semantic segmentation tasks has been achieved  , the performance at scene recognition has not attained the same level of success  . Despite the increasing attention given by researchers to solve the scene recognition problem, it still remains a challenging task. Early attempts at recognizing high-level scene properties used hand-engineered features . For instance, Xiao et al. investigated the benefits of several well-known low-level descriptors such as HOG , SIFT , and SSIM  while Meng et al.0 proposed a global image representation using Local Difference Binary Pattern (LDBP).These methods can learn sophisticated features to describe the visual appearance of scenes. However, they rely heavily on specific types of visual cue, such as color, texture, or shape, which are not practical and powerful enough to discriminate scenes with similar visual appearances. Current techniques for assigning semantic label to scenes are mostly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 1 2 3. Specifically, Donahue et al.2 investigated the semantic clustering of deep convolutional features, and Xie et al.3 proposed to combine CNN features with dictionary-based models. These methods only use the image features to recognize the scene and fail to produce robust scene representations. Other recent works consider semantic information about object attributes and states. For example, Chen et al.4 adopted a contextual-based model for discovering regions in scene images using spatial structural layouts and Alejandro et al. used semantic segmentation as an additional modality of information for scene recognition. In general, context information such as semantic segmentation, structural layouts and object attributes have become the key to improve scene recognition accuracy.\nIn particular, semantic attributes are used to enable a richer description of scenes while semantic segmentationenables spatial relationships between objects in a scene. As shown in Figure 1, it is difficult to distinguish the three categories using only visual features, while on the attribute space, it’s easier to semantically differentiate the images across categories. Attribute information are quite important to discriminate similar images and boost the performance of scene recognition. However, extracting object attributes or building an effective semantic representation have proven to be quite challenging, especially when the object attribute annotation must be made through human effort. Semantic segmentation is also challenging given that the task of labeling a scene with accurate per-pixel labels is time consuming.\n To overcome the above limitations, we first propose a partially supervised annotation strategy in which human supervision and intervention are reduced and are only required on few tasks. The strategy is flexible and provides a much more cost-effective solution to real world scenarios, and requires much less annotation efforts.\nAn overview of the annotation approach is depicted in Figure 2. We begin by identifying pre-trained models for the task of object detection. Then, we use these models to predict object instances for the scene images. Since image scenes are composed of objects, we can use object predictions as attributes to describe scenes. However, this simple, yet effective approach has a major drawback in that attribute predictions are not always highly reliable due to possible biases on their training data. We solve this problem by only keeping those attributes with high confidence scores while discarding those attributes with low confidence scores. In addition, we include these attributes into our model through a regularized loss specifically adapted for this purpose.\nMoreover, Zamir et al.5 showed that scene recognition, object detection and semantic segmentation are interrelated tasks that share a common Branch and that, under transfer learning setting, the performance of object detection methods is generally higher than that of scene recognition. As a result, objects predictions mined from scene images using object detection models can also benefit the scene recognition task. Following the strategy above, we exploit both local (attribute features) and global information (image features) to learn a better scene representation. We use the detected score to control the importance of each attribute while previous works based on attributes do not consider their importance. Many attributes usually co-occur for a scene with a different level of importance, and these scores may be helpful. For example, the object “table\", “computer” and “chair” better describe the scene category ‘office” than the object “suitcase\". Given these objects in a scene, the contributions of “table\", “computer” and “chair” must be considered. Motivated by this, we therefore introduce a Re-weighting Attribute Layer that utilizes the confidence scores of object in the scene to optimize scene recognition.\n Compared with previous methods, our work differs in two aspects. First, we propose to investigate object information from object-centric datasets as attribute labels to the task of scene recognition. These attribute labels provide detailed local descriptions.\nSecondly, we propose a Multi-task Attribute-Scene Recognition (MASR) network that exploits attribute information in terms of objects scores to improve the scene recognition task. Various object and context information learned from object detection models are utilized as attributes. Moreover, we categorize the list of attributes into the probable and significant ones based on their prediction effectiveness and introduce a layer which adaptively incorporates the attribute into the network.\n Our contributions are summarized as follows: We propose an attribute mining strategy and release a set of scene attributes for MIT67 6, SUN397 , ADE20K  and Places-365 7 datasets. Code and attribute annotations for the datasets will be made publicly available after the blind-review process is completed. We propose a novel multi-task attribute-scene recognition framework. The framework learns discriminative CNN embeddings for both scene recognition and attribute recognition. We introduce an attribute re-weighting layer which leverage the attribute predictions to correct the classification based on the detected scores. We achieve very competitive results for our proposed the method compared with the state-of-the-art scene recognition methods on four large-scale datasets. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present the related research work. Then, in Section III, we describe our attribute annotation strategy. In Section IV, we provide details of the proposed scene recognition model. In Section V, we present our experimental results on scene recognition task. Finally, we conclude this paper and discuss the future works in Section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Scene recognition, a.k.a, scene categorization, aims to determine the overall scene category (e.g., beach, kitchen, airport) by laying an emphasis on understanding its global properties  [ref]2.
