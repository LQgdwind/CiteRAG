      "content": "Paper Title: Deep image prior for 3D magnetic particle imaging: A quantitative comparison of regularization techniques on Open MPI dataset\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe will now discuss the idea behind the Deep image prior (DIP). The concept of a DIP was first introduced in , and it has been quickly adopted by fields like compressed sensing  and inverse problems  [ref]33.\nThe core idea is to use the architecture of an untrained neural network φθ:ℝZ→ℝN:subscript𝜑𝜃→superscriptℝ𝑍superscriptℝ𝑁\\varphi_{\\theta}:\\mathbb{R}^{Z}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{N} as a regularization for the reconstruction and to determine the network parameters θ∈ℝQ𝜃superscriptℝ𝑄\\theta\\in\\mathbb{R}^{Q} for a random but fixed input z∈ℝZ𝑧superscriptℝ𝑍z\\in\\mathbb{R}^{Z}.\nMore formally, in DIP one tries to minimize the data fidelity with respect to θ𝜃\\theta, where usually p=2𝑝2p=2, but throughout this paper we will use p=1𝑝1p=1. The minimization is done iteratively by Adam [ref]41.\nThis is in contrast to common approaches relying on the minimization of a Tikhonov-type functional as given in (II.6).\nOne crucial prerequisite for the DIP is the proper choice of network architecture. While the original DIP uses an architecture for 2D images, we use an architecture suitable for the 3D MPI problem. As our regularizing architecture, we use an autoencoder based on the architecture of the original DIP paper’s “skip-architecture”. In detail, our architecture differs in the following aspects: We do not use skip connections. This means the U-net  reduces to the aforementioned autoencoder. Naturally, we replaced the two-dimensional convolutional layers by three-dimensional ones. Our final activation function is ReLU, not Sigmoid. We use ReLU because we know that our particle concentration is non-negative, but do not know an upper bound. We conclude this subsection with a discussion of the relationship between DIP and the variational approach, i.e.,\nrewriting variational regularizations as deep image priors:\nAs demonstrated in [ref]33, the DIP can be seen as a variational approach to inverse problems by assuming continuous differentiability of the network with respect to its parameters θ𝜃\\theta and applying the idea of Lagrange multipliers  to the constrained optimization problem We would like to point out that it is also possible to write most of the common regularization functionals R𝑅R in the context of the variational problem as a DIP – although this can require exotic architectures. One way to show this is to assume continuous differentiability of R𝑅R and utilize Lagrange multipliers to rewrite the Expression (II.9) as the constrained optimization problem If we further assume the existence of an R𝑅R specific functional gτ:domain​(R)=ℝQ=ℝN→ℝ:subscript𝑔𝜏domain𝑅superscriptℝ𝑄superscriptℝ𝑁→ℝg_{\\tau}:\\mbox{domain}(R)=\\mathbb{R}^{Q}=\\mathbb{R}^{N}\\to\\mathbb{R} s.t. R​(gτ​(θ)​θ)=τ𝑅subscript𝑔𝜏𝜃𝜃𝜏R(g_{\\tau}(\\theta)\\theta)=\\tau, we can rewrite (II.10) in terms of the problem The solution θ𝜃\\theta of this problem yields the solution to the original problem in (II.9) via gτ​(θ)​θsubscript𝑔𝜏𝜃𝜃g_{\\tau}(\\theta)\\theta.\nThe assumption that such an gτsubscript𝑔𝜏g_{\\tau} exists is fulfilled by most common penalty terms in use, like total-variation , and ℓpsuperscriptℓ𝑝\\ell^{p}-norms which fulfil this property in the form of positive homogeneity. E.g., for a penalty term of the form and c≠0𝑐0c\\neq 0, we have the functional gτ​(c)=τp‖c‖psubscript𝑔𝜏𝑐𝑝𝜏subscriptnorm𝑐𝑝g_{\\tau}(c)=\\frac{\\sqrt[p]{\\tau}}{\\|c\\|_{p}} and therefore the DIP\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: We will now discuss the idea behind the Deep image prior (DIP).
