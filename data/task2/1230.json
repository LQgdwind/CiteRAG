      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Attention Network: Accelerate Attention by Searching Where to Plug\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOn CIFAR100 [ref]16 and ImageNet 2012  datasets, we conduct experiments on ResNet [ref]11 backbone with different attention modules, including Squeeze-Excitation (SE) , Spatial Group-wise Enhance (SGE) [ref]18 and Dense-Implicit-Attention (DIA)  modules. In our supplementary, we describe these modules as well as the training settings of controller and networks. Since the networks with attention modules have extra computational cost from the vanilla backbone inevitably, we formulate the relative inference time increment to represent the relative speed of different attention networks, i.e., where It​(⋅)subscript𝐼𝑡⋅I_{t}(\\cdot) denotes the inference time of the network and the notation w/w​o.A​t​t​e​n​t​i​o​nformulae-sequence𝑤𝑤𝑜𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛w/wo.~{}Attention represents the network with//without the attention module. The inference time is measured by forwarding the data of batch size 50 for 1000 times on a server with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5122 CPU @ 3.60GHz and 1 Tesla V100 GPU. CIFAR100. CIFAR100 consists of 50k training images and 10k test images of size 32 by 32. In our implementation, we choose 10k images from the training images as a validation set (100 images for each class, 100 classes in total), and the remainder images as a sub-training set. Regarding the experimental settings of ResNet164 [ref]11 backbone with different attention modules, the supernet is trained for 150 epochs, and the search step T𝑇T is set to be 1000. ImageNet 2012. ImageNet 2012 comprises 1.28 million training images. We split 100k images (100 from each class and 1000 classes in total) as the validation set and the remainder as the sub-training set. The testing set includes 50k images. Besides, the random cropping of size 224 by 224 is used in ImageNet experiments. Regarding the experimental settings of ResNet50 [ref]11 backbone with different attention modules, the supernet is trained for 40 epochs, and the search step T𝑇T is set to be 300. \n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nStage1\nStage2\nStage3\nTest Accuracy (%)\n\n\n\nENAS (a)\n001001001001001001\n001001001001001001\n001001001001001001\n75.80\n\nENAS (b)\n100100101100100100\n101101100100101101\n100100101101100100\n75.11\n\nENAS (c)\n110110110110110110\n110110110110110110\n110110110110110110\n76.08\n\nEAN (a)\n001100100101110101\n001100000111001111\n101100000111110001\n76.93\n\nEAN (b)\n001100000001010111\n011100001000010111\n101000100110000000\n76.71\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\nModel\n\nMAE/MSE\n\nRelative Inference Time Increment (%)\n\n\nOrg-full\nShare-full\nEAN\n\nOrg-full\nShare-full\nEAN\n\nSHHB\nSE \n\n9.5/15.93\n8.9/14.6\n8.6/14.7\n\n19.19\n19.19\n6.16 (↓↓\\downarrow 13.03)\n\nDIA \n\n-\n9.1/14.9\n8.2/13.9\n\n-\n16.93\n8.71 (↓↓\\downarrow 8.22)\n\nSHHA\nSGE [ref]18\n\n93.9/144.5\n91.6/143.1\n88.4/140.0\n\n58.98\n58.85\n30.55 (↓↓\\downarrow 28.30)\n\nSE \n\n89.9/140.2\n89.9/140.2\n79.4/127.7\n\n49.50\n49.00\n21.07 (↓↓\\downarrow 27.93)\n\nDIA \n\n-\n92.5/130.4\n90.3/141.6\n\n-\n51.75\n29.43 (↓↓\\downarrow 22.32)\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: On CIFAR100 [ref]16 and ImageNet 2012  datasets, we conduct experiments on ResNet [ref]11 backbone with different attention modules, including Squeeze-Excitation (SE) , Spatial Group-wise Enhance (SGE) [ref]18\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
