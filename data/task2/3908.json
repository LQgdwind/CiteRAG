𝑨𝑨\\bm{A}, 𝑩𝑩\\bm{B} and 𝑮𝑮\\bm{G} are matrices defined in . The following assumptions are made: Assumption 1: Matrix G is column full rank. Assumption 2: The aerodynamic effect 𝒆𝒇​𝒌subscript𝒆𝒇𝒌\\bm{e_{fk}} is available with no delay at each sampling timestamp. Proposition 1: There exists a control law 𝒖bsubscript𝒖𝑏\\bm{u}_{b} that ensures the nominal model 𝒇​(𝒙k,𝒖k,𝒆𝒇​𝒌)𝒇subscript𝒙𝑘subscript𝒖𝑘subscript𝒆𝒇𝒌\\bm{f}(\\bm{x}_{k},\\bm{u}_{k},\\bm{e_{fk}}) is ISS if the stochastic disturbance 𝒘tsubscript𝒘𝑡\\bm{w}_{t} is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) a zero-mean distribution, i.e., 𝔼​(wk)=0𝔼subscript𝑤𝑘0\\mathbb{E}{(w_{k})}=0.

Then we prove 𝒇​(𝒙k,𝒖k′)𝒇subscript𝒙𝑘superscriptsubscript𝒖𝑘′\\bm{f}(\\bm{x}_{k},\\bm{u}_{k}^{{}^{\\prime}}) is ISS . According to  and , there exists a continuous function Vbsubscript𝑉𝑏V_{b}: 𝕏→ℝ+→𝕏subscriptℝ\\mathbb{X}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R_{+}} that is an ISS-Lyapunov function. Therefore, the nominal model 𝒇​(𝒙k,𝒖k,𝒆𝒇​𝒌)𝒇subscript𝒙𝑘subscript𝒖𝑘subscript𝒆𝒇𝒌\\bm{f}(\\bm{x}_{k},\\bm{u}_{k},\\bm{e_{fk}}) with 𝔼​(wk)=0𝔼subscript𝑤𝑘0\\mathbb{E}{(w_{k})}=0 is ISS.  ■■\\blacksquare\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: A quadrotor dynamic model has six Degrees of Freedom (DoF), i.e., three linear motions and three angular motions [ref]3.
