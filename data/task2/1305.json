      "content": "Paper Title: Removing Class Imbalance using Polarity-GAN: An Uncertainty Sampling Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral works have been done to solve the imbalanced data problem in Machine Learning/Deep learning2[ref]433. Huang et al. handled imbalanced-data by integrating the sampling process into Convolution Neural Network (CNN) . The sampling process was done by dividing the data into several clusters, then a pair of databases on the determined condition was retrieved. These pairs of data were then inputted to CNN. After this, the process was then repeated from clustering until the model reaches the convergences. Yan et al., and Khan et al.handled imbalanced data by modifying a CNN. Wei et al. handled an imbalance in object recognition by designing an image-cutting technique used as additional training data. George et al. and Mostajabi et al. used cost-sensitive to handle imbalanced data in scene-parsing. The techniques used in these researches were specifically designed for the data set that was used in their research. Thus, it isn’t easy to implement techniques for different data sets. These techniques also had other limitations addressed by Aida Ali et al.. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014, Schmidhuber, 2020) 0 have emerged as a class of generative models approximating the real data distribution. GANs represent a class of generative models based on a game-theoretic framework in which a generator network G competes against an adversary D, a discriminator. GANs aim to approximate the probability distribution function that certain data is assumed to be drawn from.\nAlthough GAN has shown success in realistic image generation, the training is not easy; The process is known to be unstable and slow. Later on, Arjovsky, Chintala et al. had introduced WGAN (Wasserstein GAN) (Figure 1) to solve the stability problem. In this work, the Wasserstein-1 distance, also known as the earthmover (EM) distance, is used as a cost function, a continuous and more appropriate metric for measuring the distance between two distributions. The EM distance does not suffer from vanishing gradients; by contrast, the JS (Jensen–Shannon divergence)6 divergence in the GAN does not supply useful gradients to the generator. Conditional GANs (CGAN): (Mirza, Osindero, 20147 (Figure 11 in the Appendix). This model’s novelty is that they implemented classification shared weights with discriminate models and forced D models to concentrate on small classes’ features. They simultaneously train a generative model and a fine-grained classifier. Later, Giovanni Mariani, Florian Scheidegger et al. 4had introduced applied class conditioning in the latent space to drive the generation process towards a target class. They called it BAGAN.\nAuxiliary Classifier GANs (ACGAN) (Odena, Olah, Shlens, 2017) (Figure 12 in the Appendix) is a class-conditional extension of GANs and offers a simple method for providing varying amounts of control in the image generation process by adding a classification layer to the discriminator. The two generator objectives, i.e., classifying real/fake and classifying the label, as shown in equation 12 and 13, are contradictory. The generator here is made to generate an image that is real or generate an image for minority labels, which causes deterioration of images generated. Thus the quality of the data generated is incomparable with that of the real training data. Douzas and Bacao (2018) demonstrate that the data generated by CGAN improves the classification’s performance. However, GAN and conditional GANs, such as CGAN and ACGAN, have limitations. The instability of the training process remains these GANs as a challenge in practice. The other problem is the influence of noise. As the generator of the GANs takes as input a random noise vector and outputs a synthetic image, we need the classifier for the conditional GANs to consider the influence of noise. Also, conditional GANs perform well in the hypothesis that the class boundaries are clear. In a real-world dataset, this hypothesis does not hold because the boundaries between classes are often unclear and ambiguous. There is another approach taken by Suh, Sungho et al. in CE-GAN, also known as classification enhancement GAN. In this approach, firstly, the class label is classified by an independent classifier. Step 2 involves training a classifier with the real and augmented dataset to verify the classification performance’s improvement. In this approach, data augmentation is done to increase samples. It is entirely unclear whether the performance improvement is because of progress in the performance for minority class or overall improvement in the classification performance. We found missing major components in all GAN-based approaches that the authors have not performed any experimental evaluation on real-world data set with imbalance distribution. Such as like anomaly detection, Healthcare data, fault diagnosis, face recognition, and COVID datasets , medical diagnosis, detection of oil spillage in satellite images. Majorly all experiments have been performed with CIFAR-10, MNIST data sets. We find out that state-of-the-art architecture like WGAN tends to overfit those datasets for minority classes.\n\nReference markers found: [433]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]433: Several works have been done to solve the imbalanced data problem in Machine Learning/Deep learning2[ref]433.
