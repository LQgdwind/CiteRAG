The mobility pattern of IoT users in a smart city allows the estimation of energy services’ availability . However, the available services may deliver energy intermittently due to their movement within the confined area (i.e., micro-mobility). The micro-mobility of IoT energy providers may cause disconnections of the wireless energy delivery. Each individual may concur a unique experience in a particular place. This experience may create an attachment of people to that particular place reflected in a set of habits . These habits may define the mobility pattern of individuals in confined areas . We leverage mobility patterns to define the intermittent energy service model. An intermittent crowdsourced IoT energy service  C​E​S𝐶𝐸𝑆CES is represented as a tuple <Eid,Eownerid,F,Q,A,In><Eid,Eownerid,F,Q,A,In> where E​i​d𝐸𝑖𝑑Eid is a unique service ID, E​o​w​n​e​r​i​d𝐸𝑜𝑤𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑑Eownerid is a unique ID for the owner of the IoT device, F𝐹F is the set of C​E​S𝐶𝐸𝑆CES functionalities offered by an IoT device. Q𝑄Q is a tuple of <q1,q2,…,qn><q_{1},q_{2},...,q_{n}> [ref]10. A𝐴A and I​n𝐼𝑛In are the spatio-temporal patterns which capture the mobility of energy services. Each qisubscript𝑞𝑖q_{i} denotes a QoS property of C​E​S𝐶𝐸𝑆CES. A𝐴A is a temporal function for the estimation of the availability of C​E​S𝐶𝐸𝑆CES inside the confined area at the advertised time. I​n𝐼𝑛In is time series to represent the intermittent behavior of C​E​S𝐶𝐸𝑆CES. Crowdsourced Energy Service Consumer request.\nAn energy service request is defined as a tuple Q=<t,l,RE,CI,du>Q=<t,l,RE,CI,du>, where t𝑡t refers to the timestamp when the request is launched. l𝑙l refers to the location of the consumer. We assume that the consumer is stationary at their location l𝑙l after launching their energy request. R​E𝑅𝐸RE represents the required amount of energy. C​I𝐶𝐼CI is the maximum intensity of the wireless current that a consuming IoT device can receive. d​u𝑑𝑢du refers to the charging period [ref]10. Crowdsourced Energy Service Quality Attributes.\nQuality parameters i.e., QoS allow users to distinguish among crowdsourced IoT energy services.\nQoS parameters are defined as a tuple <l,r,st,et,DEC,I,Tsr,Reli><l,r,st,et,DEC,I,Tsr,Rel_{i}>: l𝑙l is the location of the consumer. r𝑟r is the range between the providing and consuming IoT devices which allows a successful wireless energy delivery. s​t𝑠𝑡st and e​t𝑒𝑡et represent the start time and end time of a crowdsourced energy service respectively. D​E​C𝐷𝐸𝐶DEC is the deliverable energy capacity. I𝐼I is the intensity of the wirelessly transferred current. T​s​r𝑇𝑠𝑟Tsr represents the transmission success rate. R​e​li𝑅𝑒subscript𝑙𝑖Rel_{i} is the reliability QoS [ref]10.\n The spatio-temporal features of the IoT energy services (i.e, l,s​t𝑙𝑠𝑡l,st and e​t𝑒𝑡et) are defined based on the pattern of time spent in regularly visited places e.g., coffee shops or food courts using their daily activity model . D​E​C𝐷𝐸𝐶DEC and R​e​li𝑅𝑒subscript𝑙𝑖Rel_{i} are estimated by the energy usage model of the IoT device . I𝐼I and T​s​r𝑇𝑠𝑟Tsr are defined based on the specifications of the IoT devices providing services. The intermittent mobility patterns of IoT energy services are defined as: Availability: The availability of an intermittent service is the probability distribution of service provider’s location inside\nthe confined area C𝐶C during the advertised time interval.We denote the availability A𝐴A of a service i𝑖i within a confined area C𝐶C as a tuple Ai​(C,ti,l​o​ci,θi)subscript𝐴𝑖𝐶subscript𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑜subscript𝑐𝑖subscript𝜃𝑖A_{i}(C,t_{i},loc_{i},\\theta_{i}). Here, ti={ti​0,ti​1,ti​2,..,ti​n}t_{i}=\\{t_{i0},t_{i1},t_{i2},~{}..,t_{in}\\} is the set of timestamps between the start s​ti𝑠subscript𝑡𝑖st_{i} and the end time e​ti𝑒subscript𝑡𝑖et_{i} of service i𝑖i. loci={loci​0,loci​1,loci​2,..,loci​n}loc_{i}=\\{loc_{i0},loc_{i1},loc_{i2},~{}..,loc_{in}\\} is the set of locations of the service i𝑖i within the confined area C𝐶C. Each θi​k∈θi={θi​0,θi​1,θi​2,..,θi​n}\\theta_{ik}\\in\\theta_{i}=\\{\\theta_{i0},\\theta_{i1},\\theta_{i2},~{}..,\\theta_{in}\\} is the probability that the service i𝑖i is in the location l​o​ci​k𝑙𝑜subscript𝑐𝑖𝑘loc_{ik} at the timestamp ti​ksubscript𝑡𝑖𝑘t_{i}k, θi​(li=l​o​ci)=f​(Hi,C)subscript𝜃𝑖subscript𝑙𝑖𝑙𝑜subscript𝑐𝑖𝑓subscript𝐻𝑖𝐶\\theta_{i}(l_{i}=loc_{i})=f(H_{i},C).\nThe probability distribution function f𝑓f can be obtained by statistical methods applied on the historical records Hisubscript𝐻𝑖H_{i} of service i𝑖i in the confined area C𝐶C . Intermittent provision: The intermittent provision I​n𝐼𝑛In of an IoT energy service i𝑖i to an energy request Q𝑄Q is modeled as a tuple I​ni​(Q,Ai,P​ri)𝐼subscript𝑛𝑖𝑄subscript𝐴𝑖𝑃subscript𝑟𝑖In_{i}(Q,A_{i},Pr_{i}) where Aisubscript𝐴𝑖A_{i} is the availability distribution for all timestamps ti={ti​0,ti​1,ti​2,..,ti​n}t_{i}=\\{t_{i0},t_{i1},t_{i2},~{}..,t_{in}\\} between the start s​ti𝑠subscript𝑡𝑖st_{i} and the end time e​ti𝑒subscript𝑡𝑖et_{i} of service i𝑖i. P​ri𝑃subscript𝑟𝑖Pr_{i} is the corresponding energy provision distribution for all timestamps based on the location of the service. The provision distribution P​ri𝑃subscript𝑟𝑖Pr_{i} presents the wireless energy provision status at each timestamp ti​k∈ti={ti​0,ti​1,ti​2,..,ti​n}t_{ik}\\in t_{i}=\\{t_{i0},t_{i1},t_{i2},~{}..,t_{in}\\} as follows: Where Dk(Q.l,li)D_{k}(Q.l,l_{i}) is the distance at timestamp tksubscript𝑡𝑘t_{k} between the location of the energy consumer Q.lformulae-sequence𝑄𝑙Q.l and the location lisubscript𝑙𝑖l_{i} of the service i𝑖i. risubscript𝑟𝑖r_{i} is the wireless transmission range of the device providing the service i𝑖i.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: The intermittent crowdsourced energy services are provided by peoples’ wearables [ref]8.
