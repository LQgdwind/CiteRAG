Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: EmoDubber: Towards High Quality and Emotion Controllable Movie Dubbing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAudio-visual Sync Evaluation.\nTo evaluate the synchronization between the generated speech and the video quantitatively, we adopt Lip Sync Error Distance (LSE-D) and Lip Sync Error Confidence (LSE-C) as our metrics, which are widely used to lip reading , talking face [ref]48 , and video dubbing task  .\nThese metrics are based on the pre-trained SyncNet [ref]5, which can explicitly test for lip synchronization in unconstrained videos in the wild  [ref]5.\nCompared to the length metric MCD-SL [ref]3, we believe that LSE-C and LSE-D can more accurately measure the synchronization of vision and audio. The discussion of the two kinds of metrics is in Appendix E. Speech Quality Evaluation. The Word Error Rate (WER)  is used to measure pronunciation accuracy by using Whisper-V3  as the ASR model.\nTo evaluate the timbre consistency between the generated dubbing and the reference audio, we employ the speaker encoder cosine similarity (SECS) following   to compute the similarity of speaker identity.\nBesides, we adopt the Mel Cepstral Distortion Dynamic Time Warping (MCD) and speech length variant (MCD-SL)   [ref]3 to measure the difference between generated speech and real speech. Emotional Evaluation. We use the Intensity Score, the average softmax logit of the target emotion, which ranges from 0 to 1, to measure the emotional intensity of generated audio. While previous works 3  use average classification probability, they fail to distinguish varying intensities within the same emotion class. The average softmax logit provides a finer-grained measure, allowing for a more effective evaluation of emotion intensity differences in audio. Subjective Evaluation. To further evaluate the quality of generated speech, we conduct a human study using a subjective evaluation metric, following the settings in [ref]3.\nSpecifically, we adopt the MOS-naturalness (MOS-N) and MOS-similarity (MOS-S) to assess the naturalness of the generated speech and the recognization of the desired voice.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: the generated speech and the video quantitatively, we adopt Lip Sync Error Distance (LSE-D) and Lip Sync Error Confidence (LSE-C) as our metrics, which are widely used to lip reading , talking face [ref]48 , and video dubbing task  .\nThese metrics are based on the pre-trained SyncNet [ref]5, which can explicitly test for lip synchronization in unconstrained videos in the wild  [ref]5.\nCompared\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
