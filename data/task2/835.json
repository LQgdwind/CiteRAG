      "content": "Paper Title: Information-Theoretic Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization with Continuous Approximations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMulti-fidelity single-objective optimization. acquisition function for single-fidelity and single-objective BO has been extensively studied ().\nCanonical examples of myopic acquisition function include expected improvement (EI) and upper-confidence bound (UCB). EI was extended to multi-fidelity setting (  ). The popular GP-UCB method () was also extended to multi-fidelity setting with discrete fidelities () and continuous fidelities (). Entropy based methods fall under the category of non-myopic acquisition function\nSome examples include entropy search (ES) () and predictive entropy search (PES) (). Their multi-fidelity extensions include MT-ES ( ) and MF-PES ( ). Unfortunately, they inherit the computational difficulties of the original ES and PES. Max-value entropy search (MES) and output space predictive entropy search ( ) are recent approaches that rely on the principle of output space entropy (OSE) search. Prior work () has shown advantages of OSE search in terms of compute-time, robustness, and accuracy over input space entropy search methods.\nRecent work () proposed a general approach based on mutual information. [ref]45 extended MES to multi-fidelity setting and showed its effectiveness over MF-PES.  extended MES to the continuous fidelity and multi-task setting Single-fidelity multi-objective optimization. Multi-objective algorithms can be classified into three families. Scalarization methods are model-based algorithms that reduce the problem to single-objective optimization. ParEGO method () employs random scalarization for this purpose.\nParEGO is simple and fast, but more advanced approaches often outperform it. Pareto hypervolume optimization methods optimize the Pareto hypervolume (PHV) metric () that captures the quality of a candidate Pareto set. This is done by extending the standard acquisition functions to PHV objective, e.g., expected improvement in PHV () and probability of improvement in PHV (). Unfortunately, algorithms to optimize PHV based acquisition functions scale very poorly and are not feasible for more than three objectives. To improve scalability, methods to reduce the search space are also explored (). A common drawback of this family is that reduction to single-objective optimization can potentially lead to more exploitative behavior. Uncertainty reduction methods like PAL (), PESMO () and the concurrent works USeMO () and MESMO () are principled algorithms based on information theory.\nIn each iteration, PAL selects the candidate input for evaluation towards the goal of minimizing the size of uncertain set. PAL provides theoretical guarantees, but it is only applicable for input space ùí≥ùí≥\\mathcal{X} with finite set of discrete points. USeMO is a general framework that iteratively generates a cheap Pareto front using the surrogate models and then selects the point with highest uncertainty as the next query. USeMOC [ref]8 is an extension of USeMO for handling constraints and was applied to design analog circuits .\nPESMO relies on input space entropy\nsearch and iteratively selects the input that maximizes the information gained about the optimal Pareto set ùí≥‚àósuperscriptùí≥\\mathcal{X}^{*}. Unfortunately, optimizing this acquisition function poses significant challenges: a) requires a series of approximations, which can be potentially sub-optimal; and b) optimization, even after approximations, is expensive c) performance is strongly dependent on the number of Monte-Carlo samples. MESMO () relies on output space entropy search and its advantages over PESMO were demonstrated in a recent work . MESMOC [ref]6 is an extension of MESMO for handling constraints and was applied to design electrified aviation power systems . Multi-fidelity multi-objective optimization. Prior work outside ML literature has considered domain-specific methods that employ single-fidelity multi-objective approaches in the context of multi-fidelity setting by using the lower fidelities only as an initialization ( ). Specifically, () employs the single-fidelity algorithm based on expected hypervolume improvement acquisition function and () employs an algorithm that is very similar to SMSego. Additionally, both these methods model all fidelities with the same GP and assume that higher fidelity evaluation is a sum of lower-fidelity evaluation and offset error. These are strong assumptions and may not hold in general multi-fidelity settings including the problems we considered in our experimental evaluation. A recent work  proposed a generic approach by generalizing the MESMO algorithm  for the discrete-fidelity setting. However, this approach assumes the existence of different functions for each fidelity which makes it hard to extend/apply to the continuous-fidelity setting. We are not aware of any continuous-fidelity algorithms for MO problems.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: has shown advantages of OSE search in terms of compute-time, robustness, and accuracy over input space entropy search methods.\nRecent work () proposed a general approach based on mutual information.
