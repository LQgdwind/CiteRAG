      "content": "Paper Title: ADVANCING CTC-CRF BASED END-TO-END SPEECH RECOGNITION WITH WORDPIECES AND CONFORMERS\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAnother problem for acoustic modeling is the appropriate design of AM architecture. Previously, GMM-HMM  is the dominant architecture for ASR, where GMM models the emission probabilities while HMM models the transition probabilities. It has been shown that replacing GMM with deep neural networks (DNN) can boost the recognition accuracy [ref]14. Later on, neural networks have been the dominant architecture for AM and various neural networks have been advanced and proposed. Since speech is a signal with quasi-stationary property, one of the main trends of exploring neural networks for acoustic modeling is to capture the temporal information. For example, RNN and its variants  have shown to model such information effectively. Recently, the Transformer architecture based on self-attention [ref]24   has been broadly applied to acoustic modeling due to its excellent ability to capture long-term dependency and high training efficiency. In addition to modeling global information, using convolutional receptive fields to capture local information has also been successfully applied in ASR [ref]27 . To leverage the global and local information simultaneously,  propose Conformer to combine self-attention with convolution, and such combination is illustrated in Fig. 1. Since then, Conformer has been successfully applied to several speech processing tasks .\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: where GMM models the emission probabilities while HMM models the transition probabilities.
