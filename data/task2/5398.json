      "content": "Paper Title: Semantics-enhanced Temporal Graph Networks for Content Popularity Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraditionally, albeit the remarkable portability, the widely-mentioned reactive caching strategies, such as least recently used (LRU) and least frequently used (LFU), only focus on the patterns of local requests, thus failing to handle the unexpected requests .\nAccordingly, it becomes inevitable to design proactive caching strategies, wherein accurate popularity prediction plays a decisive role .\nWith the development of artificial intelligence (AI), applying DNN to predict popularity has thrived.\nFor instance, in , a model based on stacked autoencoders (SAE) is proposed to compute the popularity from the content request sequence.\nIn addition, Refs.   use a recurrent neural network (RNN) and its variant LSTM to discover the patterns within the temporal content requests, so as to facilitate popularity-assisted content caching.\nNevertheless, due to the insufficient historical data, LSTM or other sequence-based prediction models may fail to predict accurately for those inactive users. Furthermore, the user-content interactions constitute a bipartite graph and lay the very foundation for adopting GNN to enhance the learning performance [ref]12.\nAlthough GNN has won remarkable achievement in RS [ref]11, most existing works assume that the underlying graph is static, which does not conform to the real-life .\nConsequently, popularity prediction with DGNN has been attracting significant attention.\nDifferent from the conventional GNN, a DGNN model is able to jointly learn the structural and temporal patterns of dynamic graphs.\nFor example, Ref.  proposes a DyRep model to calculate the dynamic graph with a recurrent architecture.\nLearning from the “positional encoding” of the self-attention mechanism in Transformer , Ref.  proposes a “time encoding function” to encode the timestamp information for the graph attention network (GAT) , which is called the temporal graph attention mechanism (TGAT).\nTGN in  introduces an additional temporal learning module on top of the TGAT for a deeper refinement of the temporal characteristics.\nRef.  optimizes the temporal learning module of TGN with an age of information (AoI) based attention mechanism to filter and aggregate fresh historical messages, and realizes satisfactory results in content caching.\nNevertheless, when most users in the graph are inactive, it is in general difficult to obtain satisfactory caching performance by deploying existing DGNN models in a straightforward way. To overcome the challenge due to the data sparsity, Ref.  suggests that it is beneficial to stack more TGAT layers for enlarging the receptive field, but it comes at the expense of massive computation cost.\nOn the other hand, some works attempt to solve this problem by supplementing the side information of the bipartite graph (e.g., user social influence ).\nRefs.      propose to introduce a knowledge graph (KG) for incorporating the side information of the requested contents into a static graph model, which leverages the implicit associations among the contents and yields superior prediction performance.\nHowever, these works ignore the dynamics of the interaction graph, while the KG construction also implies the demand for a significant amount of side information (e.g., the director and release date of the content), which may not be available in many cases.\nTherefore, it is more worthwhile to leverage limited content information (e.g., genre information) with a deeper excavation.\nIn that regard, the astonishing development of NLP, such as one-hot, BERT , and Glove , makes it promising to capture the implicit semantic relations between the words. Meanwhile, it is meaningful to develop effective means of computing embeddings, so as to better unveil correlations.\nAs for the temporal learning, it is simple and sufficient to adopt a UsAttn-based mechanism to discover the relationship between multiple genres related to contents and users.\nHowever, it becomes troublesome for the structural learning module, considering the massive relevance among users to the same content.\nThe illuminated work in Ref. , which generalizes the definition of position and encodes the timestamps with a customized PE function, motivates us to treat the semantic information as a special kind of position.\nTherefore, we adopt an SPE to strengthen the association analysis between two semantics-attached content embeddings.\nAs a specially designed PE function, it is also inspired by works with learnable approaches to encode positions  .\nBesides, considering the heavy computational cost and non-uniform decay in different dimensions to encode each dimension independently before the concatenation [ref]31 , in SPE, we treat the multi-dimensional position as a whole and encode it directly by learnable Fourier features [ref]31.\nTo our best knowledge, the proposed SPE belongs to the first work to view the multi-dimensional semantic information as the position and encode from the perspective of Fourier features.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: predict accurately for those inactive users. Furthermore, the user-content interactions constitute a bipartite graph and lay the very foundation for adopting GNN to enhance the learning performance [ref]12.\nAlthough GNN has won remarkable achievement in RS [ref]11, most existing works assume that the underlying graph is static, which does not conform to the real-life .\nConsequently, popularity\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
