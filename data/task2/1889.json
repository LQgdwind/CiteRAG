      "content": "Paper Title: Conditional Variational Capsule Network for Open Set Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe open set recognition problem was introduced by  and was initially formalized as a constrained minimization problem based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), whereas subsequent works focused on other more traditional approaches, such as Extreme Value Theory  [ref]26, sparse representation , and Nearest Neighbors . Following the success achieved by deep learning in many computer vision tasks, deep networks were first introduced for open set recognition in [ref]2, in which it is proposed an Openmax function by calibrating the Softmax probability of each class with a Weibull distribution model.\nSubsequently, [ref]5 extended Openmax to G-Openmax by introducing a generative adversarial network in which the generator produces synthetic samples of novel categories and the discriminator learns the explicit representation for unknown classes.\nA similar strategy has been adopted in , that presented a data augmentation technique based on generative adversarial networks, referred as counterfactual images generation.\nMore recently, Yoshihashi et al.  analyzed and demonstrated the usefulness of training deep networks jointly for classification and reconstruction in the open set scenario. Specifically, the authors proposed to separate the knowns from the unknowns using the representations produced by the unsupervised training, while maintaining the discrimination capability of the model using the representations computed via the supervised learning process. C2AE  introduced an architecture for open set recognition and unknown detection based on class conditioned VAEs by modelling the reconstruction error of the model based on the Extreme Value Theory.\nSun et al.  have recently argued that one disadvantage of VAE-based architectures for open set recognition is the inadequate discriminative ability on instances of known classes. Therefore, the authors employed a conditional Gaussian distribution VAE model for learning conditional distributions of known classes and rejecting unknowns.\nA different approach is presented in , where normalizing flows are employed for density estimation of known samples. Specifically, the authors proposed an architecture that uses a CNN encoder and an invertible neural network that jointly learns the density of the input. However, a potential issue not discussed in the paper is that the CNN encoder has no bijective property, that is crucial to employ the change-of-variables formula for density evaluation.\nAdditionally,  introduced the concept of reciprocal points in prototype leaning to manage the open space. Although this work shows excellent performances in rejecting unknowns coming from a different dataset with respect to the known samples, the unknown detection capability degradates when the source of unknown samples is the same of the known counterpart.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: formalized as a constrained minimization problem based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), whereas subsequent works focused on other more traditional approaches, such as Extreme Value Theory  [ref]26, sparse representation , and Nearest Neighbors .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
