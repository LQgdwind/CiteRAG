As a constrained scenario, Qiu and Suda  empirically showed that, without altering the exact value of network weights,\nonly permuting the initialized weights can achieve comparable or better performance for image classification tasks.\nThis unique property makes the permutation-based training method attractive for specific hardware applications, and has been utilized as fixed-weight accelerators . It can also facilitate the implementation\nof physical neural networks 4 [ref]33.\nDespite its impressive benefits in applications, the permutation training method suffers from an absence of theoretical guarantees regarding its effectiveness, which hinders further algorithmic and hardware development necessary to fully exploit its potential. This paper establishes the first theoretical foundation of this method (to our best knowledge) by proving the UAP of a permutation-trained ReLU network with random initializations for any one-dimensional continuous function.\nCompared to the conventional UAP scenarios, the proof of permutation training encounters a significantly greater challenge,\nprimarily due to the extreme constraints of maintaining the initialized weight values.\nThe key proof idea is a four-pair construction of the step function approximators, which enables the approximation through a piecewise constant function .\nAdditionally, a reorganization method is proposed to eliminate the impact of the remaining weights. Our numerical experiments not only validate our theoretical results by illustrating the widespread existence of the UAP of permutation training in diverse initializations, but also emphasize the effects of initializations on the permutation training performance.\nMoreover, the patterns observed during permutation training also highlight its potential in describing learning behavior, relating to topics like the pruning technique 6 and continual learning  .\nOur main findings are summarized below: We prove the UAP of permutation-trained ReLU networks with pairwise random initialization to one-dimensional continuous functions. The numerical experiments of regression problems emphasize the crucial role played by the initializations in the permutation training scenario. By observing the permutation patterns, we find that permutation training as a new approach holds promise in describing intricate learning behaviors.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: (UAP) of neural networks is a cornerstone in the theoretical guarantee of deep learning, proving that even the simplest two-layer feedforward networks can approximate any continuous function 1  [ref]29.\nThis fascinating ability allows neural networks to replace critical, challenging components in existing frameworks to enhance efficiency\n   .\nDespite the extensive study in various settings,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
