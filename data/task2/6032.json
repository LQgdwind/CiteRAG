We selected five types of MIL data sets, including drug activity prediction, image classification, web recommendation, text classification, video anomaly detection (VAD), and medical diagnosis, to validate DKMIL.\nThe motivation for this decision will next be explained. First and foremost, traditional MIL data sets should be taken into account since they represent the origin, development, and exploration of this field.\nTherefore, two drug activity (musk1 and musk2) , three image (elephant, tiger, and fox)  , six web , and 202020 text (news groups)  data sets were used.\nBecause of how unbalanced their classes are in comparison to other data sets, web1, web2, and web3 were not used in the settings. Secondly, the algorithm should be able to handle bags with more complex structures, such as those where each image correlates to an instance, in order to meet real-world demands.\nAs a result of suggestions of [ref]23 , 303030 synthetic image data sets based on the three image databases MNIST , CIFAR10 , and STL10  were created. Furthermore, the structure of MIL data set is well-suited for tasks such as video anomaly detection and medical diagnosis, making it a valuable approach for real-world applications.\nFor example, videos and 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can be naturally viewed as bags where each instances corresponds to video frames or 2D MRI images.\nIn this regard, one video anomaly detection (VAD) data set ShanghaiTech   was employed to validate the proposed algorithms.\nTo improve the efficiency of leaning video features, we used the setting of , divided each video into multiple clips and treated each clip as a bag, using I3D  for preprocessing.\nWe also expanded the application of DKMIL in the area of medical diagnosis using the brain tumor data set .\nThree different patient data types are included in this data set, namely meningioma, glioma, and pituitary.\nIts goal is to identify the tumor type based on the patient‚Äôs 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. For each data set, the average accuracy and standard deviation (the value with ‚Äú¬±plus-or-minus\\pm‚Äù) of 555 times 555-fold cross validation (555CV) were reported.\nFor MNIST, CIFAR10, and STl10, which already include training and test sets, the average accuracy was determined based on the results of five independent experiments.\nNote that accuracy is the only evaluation metric used because the dat aset is class-balanced.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: The experiment compares nine algorithms, including four traditional algorithms (miVLAD [ref]22, miFV , ELDB , and MSK ), and five neural network methods (ABMIL [ref]23, GAMIL [ref]23, LAMIL , DSMIL , and MAMIL ).\nThese algorithms were selected due to their representation of the latest\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
