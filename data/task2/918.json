      "content": "Paper Title: Communication-Optimal Parallel Standard and Karatsuba Integer Multiplication in the Distributed Memory Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInteger multiplication is a widely used and widely studied basic primitive with many important applications, among which primes factorization is of particular notice due to its impact on the field of cryptography  .\nThe importance of integer multiplication can be fully appreciated by noting many computers implement it in hardware. Still, it is also complex enough that in many other very successful cases, it is entirely computed by software. The standard algorithm\n(also known as the long multiplication or the schoolbook algorithm)\ntakes Θ​(n2)Θsuperscript𝑛2\\Theta\\left(n^{2}\\right) digit operations to multiply two\nn𝑛n-digit numbers. In 1960,\nKaratsuba  showed how to improve the\nbound to Θ​(nω)Θsuperscript𝑛𝜔\\Theta\\left(n^{\\omega}\\right), where ω=log2⁡3≈1.585𝜔subscript231.585\\omega=\\log_{2}3\\approx 1.585. This result has motivated a number of efforts which\nhave led to increasingly faster algorithms. Among these, of particular note are the Toom-Cook\nalgorithmic scheme originally introduced by Andrei\nToom  for circuits and later adapted by\nStephen Cook  to software programs, the asymptotically\nfaster Θ​(n​log⁡n​log⁡log⁡n)Θ𝑛𝑛𝑛\\Theta\\left(n\\log n\\log\\log n\\right)\nSchönhage-Strassen algorithm , and Fürer’s algorithm  with complexity Θ​(n​log⁡n​2𝒪​(log∗⁡n))Θ𝑛𝑛superscript2𝒪superscript𝑛\\Theta\\left(n\\log n2^{\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\log^{*}n\\right)}\\right), where log∗⁡nsuperscript𝑛\\log^{*}n is the iterated logarithm, and, most recently, the algorithm by Harvey and van der Hoven  with complexity Θ​(n​log⁡n)Θ𝑛𝑛\\Theta\\left(n\\log n\\right).\nHowever, due to the, sometimes extremely high, constant multiplicative factors “hidden” by the asymptotic notation, standard-long integer multiplication and Karatsuba’s algorithm actually outperform the other, asymptotically faster, algorithms for a wide range of input sizes up to 2214superscript2superscript2142^{2^{14}} . Hence, both standard and Karasuba’s algorithms are of great practical interest. The problem of improving the performance of integer multiplication algorithms is actively researched, as evidenced by the significant number of publications in this field. While promising, designing parallel algorithms based on the known fast multiplication algorithms appears challenging due to the apparent “sequential nature” of the integer multiplication algorithms discussed so far, and the necessity to carefully manage communications among the processors participating in the computation around such sequential components. When designing efficient parallel algorithms, it is important not only to balance the computational effort among processors but also to minimize the time spent by the processors communicating to each other to transfer data and coordinate operations. The communication cost (or I/O cost) is, in many cases, much higher than that due to computation, and, therefore, is the real bottleneck of algorithmic performance. This technological\ntrend  appears destined to continue, as physical\nlimitations on minimum device size and maximum message speed lead\nto inherent costs when moving data, whether across the levels of a\nhierarchical memory system or between processing elements of a\nparallel system . Due to these challenges, most parallel algorithms for integer multiplication were proposed for the shared memory model where all processors have access to a shared memory space (among others,    [ref]18   ). While this model simplifies many of the mentioned challenges related to communication, it is rather unrealistic for modern architectures.\nIn this work, we consider a more realistic parallel distributed-memory model, where each of the 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} processor is equipped with a local (non-shared) memory space which can hold up to M𝑀M memory words, and data communication among processors occurs only by message exchange. Other approaches have been presented for specific hardware devices (e.g., FPGA)     or for models with limitations in the number of available processors. While some parallel versions of the standard and Karatsuba algorithms were presented in the literature for the distributed memory model, these contributions focus on specific settings with respect to the number of available processors  , or assume unbounded local memory space 3. Further, in all mentioned contributions, the impact of the communication over execution time is evaluated through experimental evaluation of specific implementations rather than a formal theoretical analysis, or a rigorous comparison with theoretical lower bounds. In recent contributions, De Stefani , and Bilardi and De Stefani  presented the first analytical lower bound on the communication cost of, respectively, standard integer multiplication algorithms, and Toom-Cook fast integer multiplication, of which Karatsuba can be seen as a special case. Their results for the distributed-memory parallel model yield lower bounds for both the bandwidth cost (i.e., the number of memory words transmitted by at least one processor) and the latency (i.e., the number of messages exchanged by at least one processor) of parallel integer multiplication algorithms. These works left open the important question of whether it is actually possible to construct algorithms matching these bounds. In this work, we present COPSIM a parallel algorithm based on the recursive long multiplication algorithm, and COPK a parallel fast integer multiplication algorithm based on Karatsuba’s algorithm. Both our algorithms are designed for the distributed memory model. Under very mild conditions (i.e., n≥𝒫𝑛𝒫n\\geq\\mathcal{P} and M≥log2⁡𝒫𝑀subscript2𝒫M\\geq\\log_{2}\\mathcal{P}), our algorithms achieve optimal speedup of the computation time with respect to their sequential counterpart, asymptotically optimal communication bandwidth cost, and latency within a 𝒪​(log2⁡𝒫)𝒪superscript2𝒫\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\log^{2}\\mathcal{P}\\right) multiplicative factor of the corresponding lower bounds  . Finally, both our algorithms require only 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}\\left(n\\right) memory space to be available when combining the size of the local memories of the processors. That is, the total required memory space is within a constant multiplicative factor of the memory space required to store the input. Hence, COPSIM and COPK have asymptotically optimal memory requirement.\nTo the best of our knowledge, ours are the first parallel algorithms for integer multiplication to achieve computational and communication optimality in the distributed memory setting.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: Due to these challenges, most parallel algorithms for integer multiplication were proposed for the shared memory model where all processors have access to a shared memory space (among others,    [ref]18   ).
