      "content": "Paper Title: DeepMetis: Augmenting a Deep Learning Test Set to Increase its Mutation Score\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeepMetis belongs to the family of model-based test input generators , i.e., tools that manipulate a model of the input instead of directly modifying the input data (e.g., pixels). In the following, we will refer to the model used for manipulating inputs as input generation model in order to distinguish it from the models used in the DL training and prediction process. Input data derived from an input generation model are more likely to be realistic and belong to the input validity domain than data subjected to low-level manipulation [ref]29 [ref]33. This implies that DeepMetis is applicable to problems for which an input generation model is available. The development of input generation models is the standard practice in several domains, such as cyber-physical systems, including safety-critical ones, e.g., automotive . Below, we present input generation models for domains we considered in our experimental evaluation: a vector image format for handwritten digit classifiers and a 3D human eye region model for eye gaze predictors. Digit Classification. We consider handwritten digit samples in the format adopted by the MNIST database . Its inputs are originally encoded as 28×28282828\\times 28 images, with greyscale levels that range from 0 to 255. As shown in Figure 1, we model them by adopting Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)111https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/ as their representation. SVG is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics, which defines shapes as combinations of cubic and quadratic Bézier curves. The control parameters determining the shape of a modelled digit are the start point, the end point and the control points of each Bézier curve. This representation helps in preserving the smoothness and curvature of handwritten shapes after minor manipulations of the curve parameters [ref]29 [ref]33. We use the Potrace algorithm  to transform an MNIST input into its SVG model representation. This algorithm performs a sequence of operations to obtain a smooth vector image starting from a bitmap. To transform an SVG model back into a 28×28282828\\times 28 grayscale image, we perform rasterisation by using two popular open-source libraries (LibRsvg222https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/LibRsvg and Cairo333https://www.cairographics.org). Gaze Prediction. We focus on the input format for the gaze estimator model proposed by Zhang et al. [ref]37, which takes as an input an eye image and a 2D head rotation angle (pitch and yaw) and predicts the eye gaze angle. The eye images are generated by exploiting UnityEyes, a freely available rendering framework . Our eye model consists of all the independent parameters used by UnityEyes to generate an eye image. They can be divided into two groups: those that cover various aspects related to an eye appearance (head angle, eye angle, pupil size, iris size, iris texture, skin texture) and others that describe the lighting (texture, rotation, ambient intensity, exposure for image-based lighting, and rotation and intensity for directional lighting). Only some of these parameters are directly controllable when asking UnityEyes to generate new images, namely head rotation angles and eye rotation angles (the latter providing us with the ground-truth for the gaze prediction), while the others are decided internally by UnityEyes. All parameters are recorded by UnityEyes in a JSON file that accompanies a generated image. For each pair of head and eye angles (controllable parameters), it is possible to request UnityEyes to generate an arbitrary number of eye images, differing among each other by the remaining, not directly controllable, parameters.\nWhen manipulating UnityEyes’ parameters for the purpose of test generation, we need to know the range in which each parameter falls in order to ensure the validity of the manipulated values.\nThus, for head and eye angles, we use the ranges suggested in the UnityEyes interface. To learn the valid ranges for the remaining parameters, we generated a dataset of more than 1 million images and analysed the generated JSON files. The identified ranges and the script used for such analysis are available in our replication package .\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: and prediction process. Input data derived from an input generation model are more likely to be realistic and belong to the input validity domain than data subjected to low-level manipulation [ref]29 [ref]33.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
