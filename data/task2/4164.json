      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Network Normal Estimation and Bathymetry Reconstruction from Sidescan Sonar\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years there has been increasing interest in the use of sidescan to reconstruct bathymetric maps. Bathymetric maps are usually constructed with high-end multibeam echo sounders (MBES), which are normally mounted on survey vessels or large autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). However, such MBES are relatively large and expensive compared to sidescan sonars, thus not suitable for smaller AUVs. Furthermore, sidescans generally have a wider swath range than multibeam and can produce images with a much higher resolution. If information about the seafloor’s slope changes can be inferred from sidescan images, a low-cost and efficient method to construct high-resolution bathymetric maps would result and be of great benefit to many applications using smaller AUVs. For sidescan intensities, we know the exact range to the seafloor but not the beam angle due to the fact that the transducer array is along a single line. The two-way travel time of the signal gives an accurate range to the reflection, and the reflected acoustic signals also contain some information about the seafloor’s slope, e.g., the changes of the intensities indicate the changes of the incidence angle . Reconstruction of the surface of the seafloor from 2D sidescan image intensities is a mathematically ill-posed problem. Traditionally, shape-from-shading techniques have been used to derive the slopes of seafloor with gridded bathymetric data as control points , under the assumption of a Lambertian model . Recently, using deep learning approaches [ref]4, [ref]5 we have shown very promising results by estimating depth contours from sidescan images with a neural network on large-scale sonar data. Our prior work [ref]4 shows that the estimation errors from a single sidescan line using a CNN are most significant as one moves further from the sensor in the across-track direction. Additional constraints from adding the altimeter readings along the trajectories of other lines were able to reduce this problem at longer ranges [ref]5. However, the accuracy of the altimeters worsens in deeper waters, making the constraint less accurate, thus affecting the bathymetry reconstruction. A typical survey has considerable overlap between lines and exploiting that to further constrain the bathymetric map is an aim of this work. Each sidescan can only measure surface slopes in the plane with normal in the direction of the linear transducer array. To measure slopes in other planes one must see the seabed from other viewpoints. However, to reconstruct bathymetry from several sidescan lines, the fusion of different bathymetric estimates needs to be addressed. Previously we estimated the uncertainty of the neural network depth prediction and used that uncertainty for confidence weighting during the fusion process [ref]5. We also used a different approach, treating it as an optimization problem with a physical model to predict the sidescan intensities rather than a neural network while still reconstructing the bathymetry from multiple sidescan lines [ref]6. That approach, often referred to as inverse rendering, comes from the field of Computer Vision and attempts to estimate reflectance, geometry, and lighting from multiple camera images in an optimization framework. Recently, more and more focus has been moved towards differentiable rendering where the forward rendering process is differentiable so that optimizing the loss between camera images and rendered images would result in better estimates of the 3D geometry. And very recently, representation learning has been adapted into the differentiable rendering pipeline, being able to produce state-of-the-art results where neural networks are used as representations of the 3D scene geometry . Particularly, Bore et al. [ref]6 has shown that the differentiable representations parameterized by neural networks proposed in  allow constraining the slopes of the seafloor to match the one inferred from a forward sensor model of the sidescan intensity under a Lambertian assumption. There are several problems of using a Lambertian model to render the measured sidescan intensity. Firstly, Lambertian reflection model is based on the assumption of ideal diffuse reflection thus cannot properly approximate the non-diffuse reflection. Secondly, Lambert’s reflection law, modeling the power of the received signal is proportional to the cotangent of the angle between the surface normal and incoming sound . Nevertheless many authors use other dependencies, for example Aykin et al. 0 and Durá et al. 1 model the received energy as proportional to the square cosine of the incidence angle. Therefore we propose to replace the physical model with a convolutional neural network (CNN), namely using a data-driven approach to estimate the surface normal from sidescan intensity and subsequently constraining the seafloor slopes of the estimated bathymetry. Another motivation of using a data-driven approach is that a neural network could potentially learn the reflectivity from context, e.g., if it looks like a rock from the sidescan images, it probably reflects like a rock. The proposed method for reconstructing bathymetry from sidescan and altimeter readings has two stages (see Fig. 1), a training stage that requires training data with some ground truth bathymetry (i.e., MBES data from the training area), and an optimization stage that can be repeated for many new survey regions and only requires the collection of sidescan data, altimeter and navigation. The first stage is to train a CNN to estimate surface normals from sidescan waterfall images. To train the CNN, we first need to georeference the sidescan data, that is to register the sidescan images with the mesh formed from MBES data, to create training pairs. After the CNN is trained, we enter the second stage, where we have another neural network, a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), to represent the bathymetry that we want to reconstruct. Such a neural network allows access to its gradient hence allowing us to supervise on the gradient of the estimated bathymetry directly. We use the sidescan and altimeter data from the test set of the trained CNN to estimate the bathymetry by using the surface normals predicted from the CNN to constrain the gradients of the bathymetry and altimeter readings to constrain the bathymetry itself. The contribution of this work is to combine and extend our previous work [ref]6 [ref]5. We evaluate that numerically using real survey data containing both sidescan and MBES collected simultaneously. Thus we present a fair comparison of the two approaches of either using the forward physical sensor model versus using an inverse neural network sensor model for the surface reflection process.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: techniques have been used to derive the slopes of seafloor with gridded bathymetric data as control points , under the assumption of a Lambertian model .
