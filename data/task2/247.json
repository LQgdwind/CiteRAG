      "content": "Paper Title: Blockchain-enabled Resource Management and Sharing for 6G Communications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs of last year, the fifth generation of mobile networks, 5G, is already being commercialized in some parts of the world, with the expectation of addressing limitations of current cellular systems as well as providing an underlying platform for new services to emerge and thrive [ref]1.\n5G was envisioned to be not only a faster 4G, but also an enabler for several other applications, such as the Internet of Everything (IoE), industry automation, intelligent transportation and remote healthcare, to name a few, by providing ultra high reliability, latency as low as 1 millisecond, and increased network capacity and data rates .\nHowever, despite the emergence of new technologies, such as millimeter waves, massive Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) and the utilization of higher frequency bands, it is clear that 5G will not be able to attend all of these requirements, albeit improving significantly from its predecessors.\nAs such, research has already shifted towards the next generation of mobile networks, 6G    . It is expected that by 2030 our society will shift towards a more digitized, data driven and intelligently inspired society, that needs a near-instant and ubiquitous wireless connectivity  .\nThus, several novel applications that provide such interaction and integration are bound to emerge in the next decade .\nAs such, some key trends that are foreseen to emerge in the near future are: virtual and augmented reality, 8K video streaming, holograms, remote surgery, the industry 4.0, smart homes, fog computing, artificial intelligence integrated services, unmanned aerial vehicles, and autonomous vehicles, to name a few   .\nThese, by their turn, will demand much more from mobile networks in terms of reliability, latency and data rates than 5G and its improvements can support   .\nAs such, several research initiatives around the globe are already working towards shaping the direction of 6G, and some of its key requirements are already being speculated, as   : Provide peak data rates of at least 111 Tb/s and latency of less than 1ms; Support user mobility up to 1000 km/h; Operate in GHz to THz frequency range; Increase the network spectral efficiency, energy efficiency and security; Harness the power of big data, enabling a self-sustaining wireless network; Support for a massive number of devices and things, enabling the IoE. To enable all of the above and increase the systems total capacity, two different approaches are possible, according to Shannon’s information theory: either increase the system bandwidth or improve the spectral efficiency   .\nIt is well-known that spectrum management is a key to achieve efficient spectrum usage and it still has issues.\nFor example, it is known that current fixed paradigms for spectrum assignment and resource management is a major challenge in mobile networks.\nThis will become even more challenging in 6G, due to the ever-growing number of subscribers and their need of intermittent connectivity, as well as the development of more data-hungry applications.\nMoreover, a number of studies have shown that fixed spectrum allocation, despite being less complex, produces low spectrum efficiency, since license holders of that spectrum do not utilize it all the time (see  and references therein). As such, several approaches have been proposed to improve spectrum management, such as Opportunistic Spectrum Access (OSA) or auction mechanisms.\nDespite the benefits of these approaches, issues in terms of security, high computational power and convergence, are present.\nOn top of that, even if such protocols provide some collaborations at the system level, collaboration between users is still not considered, hindering the overall performance of those solutions.\nSince 6G is expected to be much more cooperative than its preceding generations, with new technologies such as wireless power transfer, mobile edge computing, the IoE and Device-to-Device (D2D) communications, heavily relying on the cooperation between devices, novel approaches that do not rely on a central authority controlling spectrum and resource management, such as blockchain, are needed  . Due to its inherit characteristics, blockchain is being regarded as the next revolution in wireless communications, with even the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) emphasizing the crucial role that it can play in 6G and beyond [ref]10.\nThe main idea behind blockchain is that of an open and distributed database (ledger), where no single party has control and transactions111These transactions can mean anything, such as holdings of a digital currency (i.e. Bitcoin), movement of goods across a supply chain, spectrum and resource allocation in wireless networks, etc. . are securely recorded in blocks.\nEach block is chained together to its predecessor in a sequential, verified and secure manner, without the need of a trusted third party.\nAs such, blockchain is expected to revolutionize resource and spectrum sharing by eliminating the central authority and replacing it with a distributed one, enabling the trade of assets without them reaching the central server, improving network security and reducing its cost  . This integration between wireless networks and blockchain will allow the network to monitor and manage spectrum and resource utilization in a more efficient manner, reducing its administration costs and improving the speed of spectrum auction.\nIn addition, due to its inherit transparency, blockchain can also record real-time spectrum utilization and massively improve spectrum efficiency by dynamically allocating spectrum bands according to the dynamic demands of devices .\nMoreover, it can also provide the necessary but optional incentive for spectrum and resource sharing between devices, fully enabling new technologies and services that are bound to emerge .\nFurthermore, with future wireless networks shifting towards decentralized solutions, with thousands of cells deployed by operators and billions of devices communicating with each other, fixed spectrum allocation and operator controlled resource sharing algorithms will not be scalable nor effective in future networks.\nAs such, by designing a communications network coupled with blockchain as its underlying infrastructure from the beginning, 6G and beyond networks can be more scalable and provide better and more efficient solutions in terms of spectrum sharing and resource management, for example.\nMoreover, with privacy in mobile networks becoming more and more critical, due to the emergence of novel applications such as automated vehicles, industry 4.0 and medical applications, where even a minor failure can lead to disastrous consequences, blockchain can be of great advantage in securing and storing sensitive information.\nSince all information in a blockchain is verified by all peers and it is immutable, this can allow future mobile networks to have a permanent record of all events with its corresponding time-frame . In contrast to other papers in the area, which analyze the impact of applying blockchain in wireless networks and spectrum management   [ref]10, in this article, we dive deeper in the field of blockchain-enabled resource sharing and spectrum management.\nBased on that, in this paper a blockchain 6G-enabled resource management, spectrum sharing and computing and energy trading is envisioned as an enabler for future use-cases.\nThese resources are considered to be in a resource pool, in which spectrum is dynamically allocated, network slices are managed and hardware is virtualized in order to enable the blockchain resource and spectrum management.\nBased on this envisioned framework, a discussion on how blockchain can enable resource sharing between devices, such as energy, data, spectrum lease, and computing power is presented.\nIn addition, the motivations of utilizing blockchain for different use-cases are highlighted, mainly in terms of the Internet of things (IoT) and D2D communications, network slicing, and network virtualization.\nLastly, some future trends expected in the realm of blockchain-enabled wireless networks are discussed and conclusions are drawn. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of current spectrum management and allocation techniques, as well as a link between blockchain and spectrum management.\nSection 3 discusses the motivations behind blockchain, and overviews its fundamentals.\nSection 4 discusses some key applications of blockchain and how it can transform current wireless networks.\nLastly, Section 5 concludes the article.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: in some parts of the world, with the expectation of addressing limitations of current cellular systems as well as providing an underlying platform for new services to emerge and thrive [ref]1.\n5G was envisioned to be not only a faster 4G, but also an enabler for several other applications, such as the Internet of Everything (IoE), industry automation, intelligent transportation and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
