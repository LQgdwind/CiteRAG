      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Play Sequential Games versus Unknown Opponents\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral important real-world problems involve sequential interactions between two parties. These problems can often be modeled as two-player games, where the first player chooses a strategy and the second player responds to it. For example, in traffic networks, traffic operators plan routes for a subset of network vehicles (e.g., public transport), while the remaining vehicles (e.g., private cars) can choose their routes in response to that. The goal of the first player in these games is to find the optimal strategy (e.g., traffic operators seek the routing strategy that minimizes the overall network’s congestion, cf., ). Several algorithms have been previously proposed, successfully deployed, and used in domains such as urban roads , airport security [ref]28, wildlife protection , and markets , to name a few. In many applications, complete knowledge of the game is not available, and thus, finding a good strategy for the first player becomes more challenging. The response function of the second player, that is, how the second player responds to strategies of the first player, is typically unknown and can only be inferred by repeatedly playing and observing the responses and game outcomes  [ref]5. Consequently, we refer to the first and second players as learner and opponent, respectively. An additional challenge for the learner in such repeated games lies in facing a potentially different type of opponent at every game round. In various domains (e.g., in security applications), the learner can even face an adversarially chosen sequence of opponent/attacker types . Motivated by these important considerations, we study a repeated sequential game against an unknown opponent with multiple types. We propose a novel algorithm for the learner when facing an adversarially chosen sequence of types. No-regret guarantees of our algorithm in these settings ensure that the learner’s performance converges to the optimal one in hindsight (i.e., the idealized scenario in which the types’ sequence and opponent’s response function are known ahead of time). To that end, our algorithm learns the opponent’s response function online, and gradually improves the learner’s strategy throughout the game. Related work. Most previous works consider sequential games where the goal is to play against a single type of opponent. Authors of  and  show that an optimal strategy for the learner can be obtained by observing a polynomial number of opponent’s responses.\nIn security applications, methods by 3 and  learn the opponent’s response function by using PAC-based and decision-tree behavioral models, respectively. Recently, single opponent modeling has also been studied in the context of deep reinforcement learning, e.g.,   5 [ref]12. While all these approaches exhibit good empirical performance, they do not consider multiple types of opponents and lack regret guarantees. Playing against multiple types of opponents has been considered in Bayesian Stackelberg games   , where the opponent’s types are drawn from a known probability distribution. In , the authors propose no-regret algorithms when opponents’ behavioral models are available to the learner. In this work, we make no such distributional or availability assumptions, and our results hold for adversarially selected sequences of opponent’s types. This is similar to the work , in which the authors propose a no-regret online learning algorithm to play repeated Stackelberg games 7. In contrast, we consider a more challenging setting in which opponents’ utilities are unknown and focus on learning the opponent’s response function from observing the opponent’s responses. Contributions.\nOur main contributions are as follows: We propose StackelUCB, a novel algorithm for playing sequential games versus an adversarially chosen sequence of opponent’s types. Moreover, we also specialize our approach to the case in which the same type of opponent is faced at every round. We model the correlation present in the opponent’s responses via kernel-based regularity assumptions, and prove the first sublinear kernel-based regret bounds. We consider repeated Stackelberg games with unknown opponents, and specialize our approach and regret bounds to this class of games. Finally, we experimentally validate the performance of our algorithms in traffic routing and wildlife conservation tasks, where they consistently outperform other baselines.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: strategy that minimizes the overall network’s congestion, cf., ).
