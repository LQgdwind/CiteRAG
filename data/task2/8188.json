      "content": "Paper Title: Graph-based Scalable Sampling of 3D Point Cloud Attributes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost existing graph signal sampling algorithms have been developed for bandlimited graph signals . Early methods required computing the full eigendecomposition (ED) [ref]29 or computing one eigenvector in each step , making them only suitable for small graphs.\nRandom sampling [ref]22  is the fastest ED-free algorithm, but it can result in subpar reconstruction quality .\nDeterministic ED-free sampling algorithms   [ref]21 provide better reconstruction quality. However, all ED-free sampling algorithms developed for bandlimited graph signals, including random sampling [ref]22, have to estimate the bandwidth (cut-off frequency) to design spectral filter parameters, which makes them too complex for large graphs (e.g., more than 10,0001000010,000 nodes).\nWhile our proposed block-based sampling approach can be combined with existing ED-free sampling algorithms   [ref]21, their complexity would still be high owing to the use of spectral filtering and the need to estimate certain parameters such as\ncut-off frequencies (Section V-C), or coverage sets , while often also having poor reconstruction accuracy at higher sampling rates (see Section V-C).\nBecause our proposed algorithms, RAGS and RABS, are based on a graph Laplacian regularizer (GLR) reconstruction , we do not require spectral filtering or bandwidth estimation.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: Most existing graph signal sampling algorithms have been developed for bandlimited graph signals .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
