      "content": "Paper Title: From Text to Life: On the Reciprocal Relationship between Artificial Life and Large Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAutonomy refers to the degree to which a system can ‘govern’ itself (i.e. make decisions, take actions) based on its own objectives, internal states, history or processes, without direct external control (e.g.  intervention, supervision or instruction). While the notion of autonomy is complex and polysemic  9  [ref]71, in a permissive understanding, most artificial agents and LLM agents   [ref]269   can be considered autonomous, from the moment they have some “control” over how to act. Self-sustainability, i.e. requiring the system’s ability to manage and regulate the flow of matter and energy, to sustain themselves,\nis often considered out of reach for digital agents. Agents that exhibit the ability to self-optimize their behaviors in the absence of external rewards demonstrate a certain degree of autonomy. For instance, self-rewarding agents can adjust their strategies or behaviors by generating their own feedback mechanisms (e.g. Fig. 3,   ).\nDynamic, self-driven enhancement of LLMs , leveraging experiences and self-generated data to iteratively refine their model, had broad applications from debugging  to harmlessness/helpfulness . Self-improving LLM agents, either display simple behavioral adaptation via in-context learning or exhibit more structural adaptation. The former can gradually refine their outputs \nwhen integrated with an iterative workflow e.g. a critique-refine approach   .\nThe latter improve their internal model through self-reinforcing loops, e.g. fine-tuning additional parameters on self-generated   or self-assessed   data, or by optimising their architecture [ref]269.\nIn some cases, training LLMs on such self-generated, synthetic data has been shown to worsen performance, as it may go against prior optimisation or lead to cascading hallucinations 3. However, combining synthetic with real data can lead to a better cost/performance trade-off  . Autotelic systems can learn to represent, generate, select and pursue their own goals, thereby guiding their actions/decisions autonomously. Such behaviour ranges from being instinctual, and short-sighted, as in bacterial chemotaxis toward nutrients, ants foraging for food based on pheromone trails, or birds migrating seasonally following instinctual patterns, to being sophisticated and deliberate, as seen in humans contemplating long-term future pathways.\nDrawing on essential concepts like intrinsic motivation from autonomous developmental learning , both AI and ALife researchers have proposed agents that could self-generate or self-represent their own goals   , without supervision, driven by curiosity , surprise, or empowerment , framed in an information-theoretic sense.\nALife works have also investigated how such capacity may speed up language emergence , relate to affordances , or the emergence of collective behaviors  , among other things. As previously discussed, several LLM agent frameworks propose planning, goal decomposition, or even goal generation  1 by leveraging pre-trained LLMs’s world model.\nProgressing towards more autonomous LLM agents may entail enabling them to dynamically refine their mechanisms for goal representation/selection but also self-generate/self-adapt their control and regulatory mechanisms.\n\nReference markers found: [71]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]71: its own objectives, internal states, history or processes, without direct external control (e.g.  intervention, supervision or instruction).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
