      "content": "Paper Title: A Review of Multimodal Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Past, Present and Future\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAdvancements in AI have significantly impacted computer science, with works like Transformer [ref]1, BLIP-2  and ChatGPT [ref]3 excelling in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and multimodal tasks by integrating diverse data types. The development of related technologies has driven the advancement of specific applications. For example, in autonomous driving, systems need to integrate data from various sensors, including vision, radar, and LiDAR, to ensure safe operation in complex road environments [ref]4. Similarly, health assistants require transparency and trustworthiness to be easily understood and verified by both doctors and patients . Understanding how these models combine and interpret different modalities is crucial for enhancing model credibility and user trust. Moreover, increasing model scales pose challenges in computational cost, interpretability, and fairness, driving the demand for Explainable AI (XAI) . As models, including generative LLMs, become increasingly complex and data modalities more diverse, single-modal XAI methods can no longer meet user demands. Therefore, Multimodal eXplainable AI (MXAI) addresses these challenges by utilizing multimodal data in either the model’s prediction or explanation tasks, as shown in Fig. 1. We categorize MXAI into three types based on the data processing sequence: data explainability (pre-model), model explainability (in-model), and post-hoc explainability (post-model). In multimodal prediction tasks, the model processes multiple data modalities, such as text, images, and audio. In multimodal explanation tasks, various modalities are used to explain the results, offering a more comprehensive explanation of the final output. To review the history of MXAI and anticipate its development, we first categorized different periods and retrospectively examined various models from a historical perspective (as illustrated in Fig. 2). During the traditional machine learning era (2000-2009), the availability of limited structured data favored interpretable models like decision trees. In the deep learning era (2010-2016), the advent of large annotated datasets, such as ImageNet , coupled with increased computational power, led to the rise of complex models and explainable studies, including visualizing neural network kernels . In the discriminative foundation models era (2017-2021), the emergence of Transformer models, leveraging large-scale text data and self-supervised learning, revolutionized NLP. This shift sparked significant research into interpreting attention mechanisms [ref]1   . In the generative large language models era (2022-2024), the integration of vast multimodal data is driving the development of generative Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT [ref]3, and multimodal fusion techniques. These advancements provide comprehensive explanations, enhancing model transparency and trust. This evolution has led to a focus on MXAI, which interprets models handling diverse data types . However, recent reviews on XAI often overlook historical developments and focus mainly on unimodal approaches. For example, while  categorizes MXAI methods by modality count, explanation stages, and method types, it misses explainability techniques for LLMs. Although Ali et al.  propose a comprehensive four-axis taxonomy, it lacks multimodal and LLMs related summaries. However, reviews like  , and  focus solely on explainability for LLMs.\nOur study addresses these shortages by offering a historical perspective of MXAI. And we categorize MXAI methods into four eras (traditional machine learning, deep learning, discriminative foundation models, and generative large language models), and each is divided into three categories (data, model, and post-hoc explainability). The key novel contributions of this paper are concluded as follows: We offer a historical summary and analysis of MXAI methods, including both traditional machine learning and current MXAI methods based on LLMs. We analyze methods across eras, covering data, model, and post-hoc explainability, along with relevant datasets, evaluation metrics, future challenges and directions. We review existing methods, summarize current approaches, and offer insights into future developments and a systematic and comprehensive perspective from the standpoint of historical evolution.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Advancements in AI have significantly impacted computer science, with works like Transformer [ref]1, BLIP-2  and ChatGPT [ref]3 excelling in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and multimodal tasks by integrating diverse data types.
