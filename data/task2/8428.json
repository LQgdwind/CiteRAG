      "content": "Paper Title: Sparse Voxels Rasterization: Real-time High-fidelity Radiance Field Rendering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDifferentiable volume rendering has made significant strides in 3D scene reconstruction and novel-view synthesis tasks. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)  laid the foundation for this progress by optimizing a volumetric function, parameterized by multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to encode both geometry and appearance through differential rendering.\nSubsequent studies focus on accelerating speed by decomposing large MLPs into grid-based representations, with a shallow MLP typically still being employed.\nSeveral grid representations have been explored, including dense grids 7, sparse grids [ref]11, factorized grids , tri-planes , and hash grids [ref]29.\nThe most similar scene representation to ours is the sparse grid by Plenoxels [ref]11.\nWe both explicitly model 3D scenes into voxels without neural networks.\nOur quality and scalability are significantly improved due to adaptive and non-uniform voxels, while our rendering is much faster because of rasterization.\nAnother scalability issue of the previous grid-based methods is that they still use some sort of dense 3D grid.\nFor instance, dense occupancy grids 7  [ref]29  for free-space skipping or dense pointer grid [ref]11 to support sparse voxel lookup.\nWe do not use any 3D dense data structures. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)  takes a different approach by representing scenes with 3D Gaussian primitives and using rasterization for rendering, achieving state-of-the-art trade-off for quality and speed. Our work is inspired by the efficiency of using a rasterizer by 3DGS. However, 3DGS exhibits view-inconsistent popping artifacts due to inaccurate rendering order and primitive overlapping. Some recent works mitigate this artifact  , but completely resolving it significantly harms rendering speed .\nOur method does not suffer from the popping artifact.\nTypically, 3DGS  initializes Gaussians from the triangulated points via COLMAP , which is especially critical for unbounded scenes. The sparse points geometry is also employed to guide the training of volumetric representations and has shown improvement in some NeRF-based methods  .\nIn this work, we do not use the sparse points. Mesh reconstruction is an important extended topic for both volumetric-based and GS-based methods. Recent 3DGS variants   with proper regularization have shown a good speed-accuracy trade-off. However, directly extracting meshes from 3DGS remains challenging, so these methods still rely on volumetric-based post-processing algorithms to extract meshes.\nNeRF ariants 1 6   5 2 improve surface quality by rendering a signed distance field (SDF) instead of density field. The well-defined volume makes it straightforward to extract a mesh from the isosurface.\nOur sparse voxels are also a volumetric representation. Though our voxel also follows volumetric representation focusing on the density field, we still can achieve promising accuracy with minimal time. For efficient rendering, another line of research is to convert (or distill) the geometry and appearance of a high-quality but slow model into other efficient kind of representations such as smaller MLPs  0, meshes 3 7 , grids , or the recent Gaussians . Typically, the powerful Zip-NeRF  is employed as the teacher model which requires hours of training per scene. Note that using strong prior can be regarded as a different setup from ours. Finally, the sparse voxel is also a popular representation for 3D processing and understanding   9 4. We mainly focus on fast and high-quality rendering while scene understanding is out of the scope of our work.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: by decomposing large MLPs into grid-based representations, with a shallow MLP typically still being employed.\nSeveral grid representations have been explored, including dense grids 7, sparse grids [ref]11, factorized grids , tri-planes , and hash grids [ref]29.\nThe most similar scene representation to ours is the sparse grid by Plenoxels [ref]11.\nWe both explicitly model 3D scenes into voxels\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
