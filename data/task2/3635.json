      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting Neighbor Effect: Conv-Agnostic GNN Framework for Graphs with Heterophily\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated a remarkable ability for graph node classification tasks.\nMost GNNs learn node representation by recursively aggregating neighbor information    and follow the well-known homophily assumption, i.e., nodes connected by edges tend to be of the same class.\nThe aggregation process over intra-class edges would smooth representations of nodes from the same class, thus benefiting the classification task and achieving promising results on homophilic graphs   .\nHowever, the opposite heterophily property is also observed in a wide range of real-world graphs, including dating [ref]7, molecular   0, and transaction networks 1 2.\nUnfortunately, the applications of GNNs in heterophilic graphs whose connected nodes often have different labels are usually problematic 3 4 5 2. Most literature agrees that massive inter-class edges in heterophilic graphs are harmful for aggregation since they may cause the graph convolution to over-smooth the representations of nodes belonging to different classes 5 2 6.\nFurthermore, they measure the proportion of inter-class edges in a graph as homo-ratio metrics to evaluate the ”strength” of heterophily 7 [ref]7, which can be used to guide the application of GNNs. However, such metrics from edge perspectives fail to explain the completely different node classification performance under some heterophilic graphs with a similar homo-ratio 7 [ref]7 8.\nTherefore, it compels us to re-examine the heterophily problem of GNNs and answer the following two questions: (1) Is inter-class neighborhood aggregation truly harmful or unnecessary? (2) How to improve GNNs’ performance on heterophilic graphs? As shown in Fig. 1, we first note that the inter-class edges may be beneficial to improve the node classification task if their neighbor distribution is identifiable instead of random.\nThe critical point is to treat the neighbor as an entirety and measure the identifiability of each class neighbor distribution rather than simply considering the proportion of inter-class edges.\nA class with a random neighbor distribution is considered to have lower identifiability,\ne.g., all nodes are randomly connected to others without considering classes of nodes.\nWhereas a specific neighbor-connected pattern is considered to have higher identifiability.\nAn extreme example is a bipartite graph. Although the graph is highly heterophilic\n(each edge connects two nodes of the opposite class), node features are still distinguishable after a simple mean aggregation operator since their neighbor’s distribution is identifiable 9 0. In this work, we first present a novel metric to quantify the identifiability of the neighbor’s distribution. Compared with the previous inter-class edges metrics, ours can better indicate the graph-level neighbor effect for classifications and understand the heterophily problem. Then, motivated by this metric, we propose a simple yet effective Conv-Agnostic GNN Framework (CAGNNs) to improve GNNs’ performance on heterophilic graphs by learning the node-level neighbor effect. We summarize the main contribution as follows. (1) We present a new perspective of heterophily with neighbor identifiability and quantify it with the metric inspired by the von Neumann entropy.\nSpecifically, we extract the label distribution matrix of neighbors at the class level and extend the von\nNeumann entropy 1 as a new metric to\nmeasure the identifiability of neighbors for the graph.\nUnlike the edge perspective, this metric demonstrates the importance of the neighbor effect for classifications in understanding heterophily problems. It can be used to explain the performance differences of GNNs among various datasets with the same homo-ratio. Furthermore, it motivates us to consider the node-level neighbor effect to improve classical GNNs. (2) We propose CAGNNs as a general framework to improve classical GNNs by learning the neighbor effect for each node.\nTo consider the neighbor effect at the node level, we first decouple the features of a node into two parts: discriminative features used for downstream tasks and aggregated features from its neighbors via graph convolution. Then, we introduce a mixer module to fuse these two features into new discriminative features for classification via learning the node-level neighbor effect. Our framework can improve the performance of most GNNs under heterophily without modifying the graph convolution kernel due to the generic node-level neighbor effect learning mechanism. Thus, unlike other heterophilic-oriented GNNs that need to modify the convolution kernel 4 7 [ref]7, our framework is conv-agnostic and more general. (3) We conduct extensive experiments on nine well-known benchmark datasets to verify the effectiveness, interpretability, and robustness of CAGNNs. We show that a simple shared-parameters mixer module can substantially enhance the performance of most GNNs on heterophilic graphs while maintaining the performance on homophilic graphs. The average performance gain is 9.81%, 25.81%, and 20.61% compared with GIN, GAT, and GCN, respectively. Moreover, our framework shows good interpretability for determining whether neighbor information is helpful for node classification tasks, and the framework is robust to over-smoothing and noisy edges. The paper is organized as follows.\nIn Section II, we survey the related works.\nSection III briefly introduces the notations and background.\nIn Section IV,\nwe present the proposed novel metric for measuring neighbor identifiability for graphs with heterophily from a neighbor perspective.\nIn Section V, we describe the proposed CAGNN framework and implementation in detail.\nEvaluation results on nine benchmark datasets and ablation studies are presented in Section VI to verify the effectiveness, interpretability, and robustness of the proposed framework. The final section concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: the classification task and achieving promising results on homophilic graphs   .\nHowever, the opposite heterophily property is also observed in a wide range of real-world graphs, including dating [ref]7, molecular   0, and transaction networks 1 2.\nUnfortunately, the applications of GNNs in heterophilic graphs whose connected nodes often have different labels are usually problematic 3 4 5 2.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
