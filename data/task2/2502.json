      "content": "Paper Title: Active Learning in Gaussian Process State Space Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAL is itself a broad topic and here we refer readers to, for example, Settles  and Dasgupta[ref]10 for an in-depth survey of the basic algorithmic and theoretical ideas. There are many different paradigms in AL. For example, Bayesian Active Learning incorporates the Bayesian framework and is often referred to AL with GP models (e.g. [ref]27 ), because GPs naturally carry the uncertainty measures. Specifically, Houlsby et al.[ref]27 applied AL in GP classification problems, where they defined an acquisition function which estimates the quantity of mutual information between model predictions and model parameters. Other variants include Batch Active Learning and Deep Bayesian Active Learning. While Batch AL refers to making multiple queries in parallel (e.g.  [ref]27), Deep Bayesian AL explores techniques for actively learning deep Bayesian models, e.g. Bayesian convolutional neural network. For AL with regression models, Seo et al. proposed a test point rejection strategy based on the posterior variance. Krause et al. proposed an optimal exploration strategy for GP regression models, while providing bounds on the advantage of using AL. Srinivas et al. further showed convergence rate for AL in GPs under specific kernels. Schreiter et al. extended AL in GP regression by introducing constraints and Zimmer et al. extended constrained AL in GP regression to time-series. They proposed using the determinant of the predictive covariance matrix defined in the GP as optimality criterion along with theoretical guarantees. In dynamics modelling, SSM has been a long-lasting topic with enormous literature across different disciplines (e.g. [ref]30  ). In machine learning, the combination between SSM and GP began arguably from Wang et al., where they learned the latent state of GPSSM via maximum a posteriori. Turner et al. extended it to learning the transition function. Frigola et al. presented a Bayesian treatment based on particle Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo and Frigola et al. further introduced a variational inference scheme to overcome the computational complexity of Monte-Carlo based methods. This becomes the state-of-the-art and due to the fact that this approach depends heavily on the approximated function, most recent work introduced their own variational inference scheme with their own advantages and disadvantages (e.g.    ). For example, Doerr et al. and Ialongo et al. introduced their specific variational inference scheme to account for the dependence between transition function and latent states, which were treated as independent in earlier work. To the best of our knowledge, AL and GPSSM have not been discussed together until Buisson et al. first brought the topic of AL in learning the transition function using GP. They stated that the dynamical problem, i.e. learning the transition function, is fundamentally different from a static AL in GP problem, because we need to steer the system to certain states through the unknown transition function with a sequence of actions, which is the only component we can control. For each round of exploration, the next input is actively picked so that the model error can be maximally reduced. They proposed their AL strategy using the maximum entropy. Another recent work on AL in GPSSM is by Capone et al.. They proposed taking the most informative data point while employing the mutual information between the most informative point and reference points. The states, in the existing work on AL in GPSSM, are hitherto assumed to be observable such that the model can be trained in a fashion similar to GP regression. Namely, in Capone et al., the fact that states are observable simplify the estimation of the mutual information, resulting in two optimisation problems to solve in parallel. Our paper differs from the previous work by presenting an AL strategy on GPSSM with states that are latent, resulting in a different estimation of the mutual information as exploration criterion while extending the scope of AL for GPSSM. We leave further quantitative discussion in section 4.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: AL is itself a broad topic and here we refer readers to, for example, Settles  and Dasgupta[ref]10 for an in-depth survey of the basic algorithmic and theoretical ideas.
