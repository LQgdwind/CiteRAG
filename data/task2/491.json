      "content": "Paper Title: GNNAdvisor: An Adaptive and Efficient Runtime System for GNN Acceleration on GPUs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVarious NN frameworks have been proposed, such as Tensorflow , and Pytorch [ref]46.\nThese frameworks provide the end-to-end training and inference support for traditional deep-learning models with various NN operators, such as linear and convolutional operators.\nThese operators are highly optimized for Euclidean data (e.g., image) but lack support for non-Euclidean data (e.g., graph) in GNNs.\nExtending NN frameworks to support GNN that takes the highly-irregular graphs as the input is facing several challenges. First, NN-extended GNN computing platforms 1 [ref]53 focus on programmability and generality for different GNN models but lack efficient backend support to achieve high performance.\nFor example, Pytorch-Geometric (PyG) 1 uses the torch-scatter 2 library implemented with CUDA as its major building block of graph aggregation operations. The torch-scatter implementation scales poorly when encountering large sparse graphs with high-dimensional node embedding because its kernel design essentially borrows the design principles of graph-processing systems by using excessive high-overhead atomic operations to support node embedding propagation.\nA similar scalability problem is also observed in Deep Graph Library (DGL) [ref]53, which incorporates an off-the-shelf Sparse-Matrix Multiplication (SpMM) (e.g., csrmm2 in cuSparse ) for simple sum-reduced aggregation  7 and leverages its own CUDA kernel for more complex aggregation scheme with edge attributes  . Second, major computation kernels 1 [ref]53 are hard-coded without design flexibility, which is essential to handle diverse application settings with different input graph sizes and node embedding dimensionality.\nFrom the high-level interface, users are only allowed to define the way of composing these kernels externally.\nUsers are not allowed to customize kernels internally based on the known characteristics of GNN model architectures, GPU hardware, and graph properties.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: Various NN frameworks have been proposed, such as Tensorflow , and Pytorch [ref]46.\nThese frameworks provide the end-to-end training and inference support for traditional deep-learning models with various NN operators, such as linear and convolutional operators.\nThese\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
