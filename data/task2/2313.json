      "content": "Paper Title: End-to-End Weak Supervision\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe success of supervised machine learning methods relies on the availability of large amounts of labeled data. The common process of manual data annotation by humans, especially when domain experts need to be involved, is expensive, both in terms of effort and cost, and as such presents a major bottleneck for deploying supervised learning methods to new domains and applications. Recently, data programming, a paradigm that makes use of multiple sources of noisy labels, has emerged as a promising alternative to manual data annotation [ref]30.\nIt encompasses previous paradigms such as distant supervision from external knowledge bases  [ref]34, crowdsourcing [ref]15   , and general heuristic and rule-based labeling of data  .\nIn the data programming framework, users encode domain knowledge into so called labeling functions (LFs), which are functions (e.g. domain heuristics or knowledge base derived rules) that noisily label subsets of data.\nThe main task for learning from multiple sources of weak supervision is then to recover the sources’ accuracies in order to estimate the latent true label, without access to ground truth data. In previous work [ref]30  , this is achieved by first learning a generative probabilistic graphical model (PGM) over the weak supervision sources and the latent true label to estimate probabilistic labels, which are then used in the second step to train a downstream model via a noise-aware loss function. Data programming has led to a wide variety of success stories in domains such as healthcare   and e-commerce , but the existing PGM based frameworks still come with a number of drawbacks.\nThe separate PGM does not take the predictions of the downstream model into account, and indeed this model is trained independently of the PGM.\nIn addition, current approaches for estimating the unknown class label via a PGM need to rely on computationally expensive approximate sampling methods [ref]30, estimation of the full inverse of the LFs covariance matrix , or they need to make strong independence assumptions .\nFurthermore, existing prior work and the associated theoretical analyses make assumptions that may not hold in practice [ref]30  , such as availability of a well-specified generative model structure (i.e. that the dependencies and correlations between the weak sources have been correctly specified by the user), that LF errors are randomly distributed across samples, and that the latent label is independent of the features given the weak labels (i.e. only the joint distribution between the sources and labels needs to be modeled). We introduce WeaSEL, our Weakly Supervised End-to-end Learner model for training neural networks with, exclusively, multiple sources of weak supervision as noisy signals for the latent labels. WeaSEL is based on 1) reparameterizing previous PGM based posteriors with a neural encoder network that produces accuracy scores for each weak supervision source; and 2) training the encoder and downstream model on the same target loss, using the other model’s predictions as constant targets, to maximize the agreement between both models.\nThe proposed method needs no labeled training data, and neither assumes sample-independent source accuracies nor redundant features for latent label modeling. We show empirically that it is not susceptible to highly correlated LFs.\nIn addition, the proposed approach can learn from multiple probabilistic sources of weak supervision. Our contributions include: We introduce a flexible, end-to-end method for learning models from multiple sources of weak supervision. We empirically demonstrate that the method is naturally robust to adversarial sources as well as highly correlated weak supervision sources. We release an open-source, end-to-end system for arbitrary PyTorch downstream models that will allow practitioners to take advantage of our approach111https://github.com/autonlab/weasel. We show that our method outperforms, by as much as 6.1 F1 points, state-of-the-art latent label modeling approaches on 4 out of 5 relevant benchmark datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a crowdsourcing dataset against methods specifically designed for this setting.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: methods to new domains and applications.
