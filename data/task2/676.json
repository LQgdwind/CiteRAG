The vision of CC is to offer computing, storage, and network resources centrally in the remote clouds, which is related to data centers, backhaul networks, and core networks  . It is an architecture for allowing appropriate, pervasive, and on request access to a shared pool of configurable resources [ref]3. The large number of resources available in the central cloud can then be leveraged to deliver elastic computing capacity and storage to support resource-constrained end devices. It has been driving the rapid growth of many Internet companies . For example, the cloud business has risen to be the most profitable sector for Amazon , and Dropbox’s success depends highly on the cloud service of Amazon. It can intensify collaboration, scalability, nimbleness, and availability for enterprises as well as users. CC offers services on a pay-as-you-go basis and reduces hardware and software costs, energy, and carbon footprints by providing an optimized and sufficient computing environment [ref]6. In CC, users first offload tasks to the central cloud, and then the central cloud executes the tasks on behalf of users and sends back results to users . Although CC provides a vast number of resources, easy back and recovery, high accessibility as well as an eco-friendly environment for users (i.e., can be accessed anytime from anywhere on demand), it may not be capable of fulfilling the requirements of real-time applications with low latency and high reliability as the central cloud is far away from users. On the other hand, edge computing (EC), which deploys the resources, data, and services from the central cloud to the network edge, enjoys increasing popularity recently. It enables analytics and knowledge generation to occur at or close to users’ end. In EC, users first offload tasks to the nearby edge cloud, and then the edge cloud executes their tasks and sends outcomes back to users. Fig. 1 presents a typical architecture of CC and EC, where edge clouds can provide computing and network resources between users and the central cloud. Compared with CC, EC can provide services with low latency, high security, and high mobility but with limited computing capacities. CC and EC facilitate a wide range of applications including virtual reality/augmented reality, online game, online video, etc. In CC and EC, several metrics are related to the quality of service (QoS), such as security and privacy, latency, resource utilization, cost, energy consumption, throughput, and makespan. In order to improve these metrics, we need to consider several issues, such as job scheduling, resource allocation, and task offloading.\nFor example, security and privacy can be improved by designing efficient task offloading schemes . In addition, latency and energy consumption can be optimized by designing proper resource allocation  and task offloading schemes 0 1. Similarly, other metrics can be improved by considering job scheduling, resource allocation, and task offloading.\nTo this end, many optimization problems have been formulated for tackling these issues. However, compared with optimization problems in other areas, these optimization problems are normally highly complex and NP-hard, which may include mixed/strongly-coupled variables, nonlinear constraints, multiple objectives, and bilevel structures. Therefore, they may not be solved by the traditional convex optimization-based methods. In addition, their optimal solutions should be found within a reasonable amount of time. As a class of nature-inspired computational approaches, computational intelligence (CI) exhibits great potential in addressing complex optimization problems, which has attracted much attention from both academia and industry. CI includes evolutionary algorithms (EAs), swarm intelligence algorithms (SIAs), fuzzy system (FS), learning based system (LBS), and hybrid system (HS). These CI techniques have the capability to process imprecise information and search for approximate yet good enough solutions while ensuring robustness and computational tractability 2. The aim of this paper is to present a review of CI techniques to address issues in CC and EC. Several survey papers and books have been devoted to CC and EC. For example, Hoang et al. 3 presented a survey on architecture, applications, and approaches in mobile CC (MCC). A short review on task scheduling in CC is carried out in 4. QoS in CC is surveyed in 5 and 6. Wu 7 studied multi-objective decision making for offloading decision in MCC. An extensive survey on MCC is given in 8. A survey on challenges and opportunities in CC is presented in 9. Zhou et al. 0 published a survey on artificial intelligence (AI) in EC. In 1, visions and challenges of EC are discussed. A survey on EC for Internet of things (IoT) is investigated in 2. Liu et al. 3 surveyed systems and tools in EC. Peng et al. 4 studied service adaptation and provision in mobile EC (MEC). Mao et al.  elaborated on the communication perspective of MEC. Lin et al. presented a survey on computation offloading in EC. Wang et al. 5 focused on offloading algorithms, issues, methods, and perspectives in edge cloud. Moreover, some other surveys devoted to MEC are 6 7 8 9  . However, none of the aforementioned surveys considers CI techniques. In addition, some survey papers review CI techniques in CC or EC. For example, evolutionary approaches for resource management in CC are reviewed in  and . Chopra and Bedi  reviewed the applications of fuzzy logic (FL) in CC. Deep learning (DL) in EC is studied in . It is worth noting that the above-mentioned surveys only consider one particular type of CI for CC or EC. This survey attempts to give a detailed review of the state-of-the-art CI techniques in CC and EC. Our paper is an ambitious effort to capture the interplay among CI, CC, and EC, instead of delving into one particular CI technique in CC and EC exclusively. The motivation behind this survey is to provide researchers with a glance of mutual relationship between CI and both CC and EC at a higher level. The works introduced in this survey are taken from relevant journals, workshops, conference proceedings, and theses. This survey focuses on reviewing issues in CC and EC tackled by CI techniques, rather than a detailed study of CC/EC/CI techniques.\n The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents an overview of the concepts related to CC and EC along with important metrics and critical issues. Section III introduces CI techniques used for addressing critical issues in CC and EC. Section IV reviews the existing applications of CI techniques in CC and EC. Finally, Section V offers a detailed discussion on the use of CI techniques in CC and EC along with future research trends, followed by the conclusion in Section VI. For clarity, the organization of this paper is given in Fig. 2.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: which is related to data centers, backhaul networks, and core networks  .
