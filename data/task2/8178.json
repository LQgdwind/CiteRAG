      "content": "Paper Title: A Quantum Unique Games Conjecture\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe illustrate the concept of quantum value of a CSP instance using the example of MaxCut. For formal definitions refer to Section 3. Before proceeding, we briefly outline the connection to nonlocal games; however, no prior knowledge in quantum information is required to follow this work. Nonlocal Games. The types of values we introduce for CSPs correspond directly to the values for nonlocal games previously studied in quantum information. Every CSP instance can be viewed as a nonlocal game and vice versa and the correspondence between their values is straightforward. This relationship is detailed in Section 10.2 of . The physical, mathematical, and computational considerations for the definitions of the various types of values are extensively explored in the literature on nonlocal games             [ref]37   [ref]16 . For readers familiar with this area, Table 1 summarizes the correspondences relevant to this paper. Please also refer to the discussion on previous work at the end of this section for our choice of terminology. MaxCut. The objective of MaxCut is to partition the vertices of a given graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) into two subsets, such that the number of edges crossing the partition is maximized (as illustrated in Figure 1). Classical Value. A (classical) partition can be represented as an assignment x:V→{−1,+1}:𝑥→𝑉11x:V\\to\\{-1,+1\\}. The value of this partition, meaning the number of edges that cross the partition, is given by ∑(i,j)∈E1−xi​xj2subscript𝑖𝑗𝐸1subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗2\\sum_{(i,j)\\in E}\\frac{1-x_{i}x_{j}}{2}. The (classical) value of the instance, denoted ωc​(G)subscript𝜔𝑐𝐺\\omega_{c}(G), is the maximum partition value over all possible (classical) partitions: Noncommutative Value. A noncommutative partition assigns an observable to each vertex, i.e. X:V→Obs​(ℋ):𝑋→𝑉ObsℋX:V\\to\\mathrm{Obs}(\\mathcal{H}), where ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} is some finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Observables are unitary operators with eigenvalues in the set {−1,+1}11\\{-1,+1\\} (refer to Section 2.2 for background on quantum measurements and observables). If we substitute observables for ±1plus-or-minus1\\pm 1 in (1.1), we obtain the noncommutative value of the instance, denoted ωnc​(G)subscript𝜔nc𝐺\\omega_{\\mathrm{nc}}(G): where trtr\\operatorname{tr} is the dimension-normalized trace on ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}. Crucially, the optimization is over all finite-dimensional ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}. When ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} is one-dimensional, we recover the classical value, therefore ωnc​(G)≥ωc​(G)subscript𝜔nc𝐺subscript𝜔𝑐𝐺\\omega_{\\mathrm{nc}}(G)\\geq\\omega_{c}(G). The noncommutative value has been the focus of our previous work on CSPs . The main focus of this paper, however, is the quantum value of CSPs, which we define next.\n \n Quantum Value. A quantum partition lies somewhere in between a classical and noncommutative partition: A noncommutative partition X𝑋X is quantum if Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} and Xjsubscript𝑋𝑗X_{j} commute whenever (i,j)𝑖𝑗(i,j) is an edge. In quantum mechanics, commuting observables can be simultaneously measured, emphasizing the physical motivation for this additional commutation relation. The quantum value, denoted ωq​(G)subscript𝜔𝑞𝐺\\omega_{q}(G), is therefore obtained from (1.2) by imposing the extra commutation relations: Since every classical assignment is a quantum assignment and every quantum assignment is a noncommutative assignment, we obtain the chain of inequalities ωnc​(G)≥ωq​(G)≥ωc​(G)subscript𝜔nc𝐺subscript𝜔𝑞𝐺subscript𝜔𝑐𝐺\\omega_{\\mathrm{nc}}(G)\\geq\\omega_{q}(G)\\geq\\omega_{c}(G). Using the same approach outlined here, we can define the classical and quantum values for all CSPs (refer to Section 3 for the relevant definitions). However, the noncommutative value is defined only for CSPs where each constraint involves only two variables.444This restriction is related to a similar issue for synchronous value of nonlocal games: with current definitions in the literature, the quantum synchronous value of a three-player nonlocal game reduces to the classical synchronous value. See also the remark after Definition 13. We assume ωc,ωq,ωncsubscript𝜔𝑐subscript𝜔𝑞subscript𝜔nc\\omega_{c},\\omega_{q},\\omega_{\\mathrm{nc}} are normalized appropriately so that they are between 00 and 111. So for example in (1.1),(1.2), and (1.3), the normalization amounts to dividing the objective function by the number of edges. Remark. It is important to note that the commutativity requirement in a quantum assignment does not imply that all observables in the assignment commute with each other, nor does it mean that all observables can be diagonalized in the same basis. Commutativity is not a transitive property: every operator commutes with the identity operator, but not every pair of operators commute with each other. For example, in MaxCut, if two vertices are at a distance of two or more, their observables in a quantum assignment need not commute. Previous Work. To the best of our knowledge, the first article introducing a concept closely related to quantum assignment, under the name oracularizable strategies and in the context of entangled nonlocal games, is by Ito et al. . Oracularization is a widely used technique in the study of classical multiprover interactive proofs (see the references in ). Helton et al.  approached oracularizable strategies from a mathematical standpoint, using the term locally commuting algebras (see Sections 7 and 8 of their paper). Our definition of quantum assignment is the direct translation (for CSPs) of the oracularizable quantum synchronous strategies in . The definition in  itself dates back to the breakthrough results  [ref]16. In this work, we refer to these assignments as quantum because the requirement of commutativity stems from simultaneous measurability in quantum mechanics. In contrast, we refer to assignments as noncommutative when there is no commutation requirement. This terminology originates from our earlier work on noncommutative CSPs .555Our decision to use quantum synchronous strategies, both here and in , is driven by the syntactical simplicity they provide compared to tensor-product strategies. While we believe that all of our results can be extended to the tensor-product model, we leave a more detailed exploration of this for future work.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: 10.2 of .
