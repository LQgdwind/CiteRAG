      "content": "Paper Title: RefVOS: A Closer Look at Referring Expressions for Video Object Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVideo Object Segmentation (VOS)  9 has been traditionally considered on setups in which the user would manually annotate a frame in the video, and a segmentation system would generate a pixel-wise binary mask for the object in all video frames where it is visible. Our work aims at improving the human computer interaction by allowing linguistic expressions as initialization cues, instead of interactive segmentations under the form of a detailed binary mask, bounding box, scribble or point. In particular, we focus on referring expressions (REs) that allow the identification of an individual object in a discourse or scene (the referent).\nFor instance, Figure 1 depicts REs related to one of the objects contained in a video sequence, which is highlighted in green. Language-guided Video Object Segmentation (LVOS) was first addressed Khoreva et al. , and tackled later by Gavrilyuk et al.  and Wang et al. 6.\nCompared to related works on still images  , REs for video objects may be more complex, as they can refer to variations in the properties of the objects, such as a change of location or appearance.\nThe particularities of REs for videos were initially addressed by Khoreva et al. , who built a dataset of REs divided in two categories: REs for the first frame of a video, and REs for the full clip.\nOur work proposes another approach for analyzing the performance of the state of the art in VOS with REs. We identify seven categories of REs and use them to annotate existing datasets.\n We address both the language-guided image segmentation and the language-guided video object segmentation tasks with RefVOS,\nour end-to-end deep neural network that\nleverages BERT language representations [ref]8 to encode the phrases.\nRefVOS achieves results comparable to the state of the art for the RefCOCO dataset of still images , and improves the state of the art over the DAVIS-2017 1 and Actor-Action datasets (A2D) 8 for video with the phrases collected by Khoreva et al.  and Gavrilyuk et al. , respectively.\nWe also identify the categories of REs which are most challenging for RefVOS. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: (1) an end-to-end model, RefVOS, that achieves state of the art performance with available phrases for DAVIS-2017 and A2D benchmarks, (2) a novel categorization of REs tailored to the video scenario with an analysis of the current benchmarks, and (3) an extension of A2D with additional REs with varying semantic information to analyze the limitations and strengths of our model according to the proposed linguistic categories. The models, code and extended dataset of REs are available in https://github.com/miriambellver/refvos.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: both the language-guided image segmentation and the language-guided video object segmentation tasks with RefVOS,\nour end-to-end deep neural network that\nleverages BERT language representations [ref]8 to encode the phrases.\nRefVOS achieves results comparable to the state of the art for the RefCOCO dataset of still images , and improves the state of the art over the DAVIS-2017 1 and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
