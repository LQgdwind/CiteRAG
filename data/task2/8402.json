DOI:000000/11111. * Corresponding author: sbelhaouari@hbku.edu.qa\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) are inspired by biological neurons but simplify their functions to make them computationally efficient . While artificial neurons process input via linear combinations of weights and biases, biological neurons exhibit more dynamic and nonlinear behaviors. Understanding these nonlinear properties in biological neurons offers valuable insights for improving ANN design [ref]27. In biological neurons, synaptic plasticity allows connections to strengthen or weaken over time, adapting to stimuli dynamically . Similarly, ANNs adjust synaptic weights during training to minimize error, but without the temporal and spatial complexity of biological learning. While activation functions in ANNs (such as ReLU or sigmoid) introduce nonlinearity, they are a simplified abstraction of the more complex processes that govern biological neuron responses [ref]14. Recent advancements such as spiking neural networks (SNNs), which more closely model biological neurons by simulating spike-timing dynamics, introduce temporal nonlinearity into the network . Hebbian learning, based on the principle that \"cells that fire together, wire together,\" is another biologically inspired mechanism that could improve how ANNs adapt to changing environments . Models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are used to capture temporal dependencies, mimicking the recurrent connections in biological circuits . These architectures bring ANNs closer to the dynamic, feedback-rich environment of biological neurons.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: weights and biases, biological neurons exhibit more dynamic and nonlinear behaviors.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
