MCD [ref]34 tries to minimize the discrepancy by making use of two classifiers trained in an adversarial fashion for aligning the features in two domains. The idea of semi-supervised domain adaptation by using a fraction of labeled data is also introduced in MME [ref]32 approach, which induces the feature invariance by a MinMax Entropy objective. Another set of approaches uses the cluster assumption to cluster the samples of the target domain and source domain. In our work, we use ideas from VADA (Virtual Adversarial Domain Adaptation) [ref]38 to enforce cluster assumption. \nActive Learning (AL): The traditional AL methods are iterative schemes which obtain labels (from oracle or experts) for a set of informative data samples. The newly labeled samples are then added to the pool of existing labeled data and the model is trained again on the labeled data. The proposed techniques can be divided into two classes: 1) Uncertainty Based Methods: In this case, model uncertainty about a particular sample is measured by specific criterion like entropy  etc. 2) Diversity or Coverage Based Methods: These methods focus on selecting a diverse set of points to label in order to improve the overall performance of the model. One of the popular methods, in this case, is Core-Set  which selects samples to maximize the coverage in feature space. However, recent approaches like BADGE  which use a combination of uncertainty and diversity, achieve state-of-the-art performance.\nA few task-agnostic active learning methods   have also been proposed.\n\nActive Domain Adaptation: The first attempt for active domain adaptation was made by Rai et al. , who use linear classifier based criteria to select samples to label for sentiment analysis. Chattopadhyay et al.  proposed a method to perform domain adaptation and active learning by solving a single convex optimization problem. AADA (Active Adversarial Domain Adaptation)  for image based DA is a method which proposes a hybrid informativeness criterion based on the output of classifier and domain discriminator used in DANN. The criterion used in AADA for selecting a batch used is a point estimate, which might lead to redundant sample selection. We introduce a set-based informativeness criterion to select samples to be labeled. CLUE  is a recent concurrent work which selects samples through uncertainty-weighted clustering for Active DA.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: by aligning them in feature space.\nDANN  achieves this by using domain classifier which is trained through an adversarial min-max objective to align the features of source and target domain.
