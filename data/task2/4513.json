      "content": "Paper Title: RadSegNet: A Reliable Approach to Radar Camera Fusion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRapid research in self-driving sensing systems has significantly improved the quality of perception tasks like object detection in the past few years. Despite these advancements, we still do not see a prevalence of level 4 or 5 self-driving ability in commercial vehicles. The primary reason behind autonomous cars not being more commonplace is their dependence on lidars, cameras, or their fusion, which are unable to perform robustly in cases of occlusions and adverse weather conditions [ref]2 . This shortcoming, in cameras and lidar, has sparked a major interest in automotive radar-based sensing, particularly in camera radar fusion systems [ref]26 [ref]17 . A camera radar fusion system ideally can combine the benefits of both cameras and radars while also addressing the shortcomings of each sensor. While cameras provide rich texture and semantic information, they start failing in case of long range, occluded objects and adverse weather conditions  . On the other hand, radars are capable of providing all-weather reliance, long range and occlusion-free detection   ; but, they struggle in clearly identifying objects due to lack of rich texture and semantic features . In this work, the primary question we try to answer is, how do we fully realise the advantages of both modalities for achieving accurate and also reliable object detection. An ideal fusion system has to realise the benefits of both sensing modalities, and at the same time, also ensure that the shortcomings of one sensor does not affect the performance of the other. Past works in radar-camera fusion have used projection of radar data on camera perspective view, but operating in this view limits the performance in cases like occlusion of objects 4. This results into radars not being used to their fullest. More advanced and state-of-the-art approaches perform fusion at feature level. For example AVOD-fusion [ref]17 first simultaneously extracts features from camera perspective and radar bird’s eye view (BEV) and then fuses them on per object basis, to take advantage of both the sensors in their views. However, we find that the simultaneous feature extraction and fusion approach does not account for the cases where camera become unreliable. For example, in cases of occluded objects or adverse conditions, radars remain unaffected, but camera input can be highly unreliable. This causes a significant performance loss of the entire system. The loss in performance is illustrated in figure 1, (3rd column), where the quality of detections from AVOD-fusion degrade, when the camera is subjected to artificially generated adverse weather. Clearly, there is need to improve the reliability of camera-radar systems to achieve good performance even when camera input is degraded. In order to achieve this goal, we argue for a fundamentally different approach for fusing information from radars and cameras. We propose that if we can extract the useful information from both the sensors independently, then we would get the advantages of both modalities without degrading either in case of unreliability. This new philosophy of fusion uses the fact that camera and radar provide complimentary qualities i.e., rich texture and semantic information from cameras can be used to identify objects in the scene, while long range, occlusion free and adverse weather reliable detections can be achieved by using radars. Hence, extracting the information independently is possible which would benefit the reliability of the system. The natural question is, how do we design a system that independently extracts the useful information from both modalities. In good conditions the system should be able to use the rich texture and semantic information from camera as well as the useful information like depth and size of all objects from radars, while in case of unreliability in camera caused by occluded or distant object in good weather or image degradation in adverse weather, system should still be able to use radar data reliably. For realising such a system, we propose RadSegNet that achieves the required functionality by using mainly two design principles. First principle is based on the insight that for radars, BEV representation offers several advantages over perspective view 4 especially in case of occlusion. Hence, at its core, RadSegNet uses the radar’s BEV representation for detection, to encode all the information present in radar. Next, we note that rich textural and semantic information in cameras is mainly used to clearly identify the objects of a scene. Hence, inspired from 3, we bank on the significant advancements made in the camera semantic segmentation literature and independently extract the semantic features from camera RGB images. However, propagating the semantic information extracted from camera, to radar data, is still a challenging task, as the camera does not have depth information. To overcome this challenge, RadSegNet creates a novel semantic-point-grid (SPG) representation to encode the semantic information from camera images into the radar point clouds. For associating the semantics to the radar points, SPG finds the camera pixel correspondences for each radar point, instead of projecting camera image to the radar BEV. Thus, SPG encoding achieves the required independent extraction of information, by distilling the information from camera, adding it to the radar and performing detection on this augmented radar representation. Even in the conditions when camera input is unreliable, RadSegNet continues to work reliably using the radar data. Note that these conditions include adverse weather as well as occlusions and long range in clear weather, where camera data can become unreliable. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available radar datasets with different types of radars. For comprehensive benchmarking we use Astyx  dataset that has radar point clouds and augment it for bad weather. For adverse weather testing on real world data, we use the RADIATE 2 dataset that has dense radar data. For the task of object detection, RadSegNet sees an average precision (AP) improvement of 27% in Astyx dataset and 41.16% in RADIATE dataset, when compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach of camera-radar fusion, AVOD-fusion [ref]17. More importantly, we show that even in cases where the input from the camera is unreliable, our approach provides much more reliable performance than SOTA. In cases of adverse weather conditions, where camera images are poorer, SOTA could see more than 50% AP degradation, while, RadSegNet degrades less than 6%. Figure 1 shows the robust performance of our approach compared to AVOD-fusion [ref]17 when fog is inserted into the images from Astyx dataset. To summarize, our approach to radar-camera fusion is universal (works with any type of radar), reliable (maintains reliability in all-weather conditions), and complete (completely use all advantages of radar sensing). It can also be readily integrated with other sensor-fusion approaches as it does not have any dependency in feature extraction stage.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: behind autonomous cars not being more commonplace is their dependence on lidars, cameras, or their fusion, which are unable to perform robustly in cases of occlusions and adverse weather conditions [ref]2 .
