      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep VSR can be divided into five types based on the approach to preserving temporal information. (a) Temporal Concatenation. The most popular approach to retain temporal information in VSR is concatenating multiple frames [ref]26   1. This approach can be seen as an extension of SISR to accept multiple input images.\nHowever, this approach fails to represent multiple motion regimes within a single input sequence since the input frames are simply concatenated together.\n (b) Temporal Aggregation. To address the dynamic motion problem in VSR, 3 proposed multiple SR inferences which work on different motion regimes. The final layer aggregates the outputs of all branches to construct SR frame. However, this approach still concatenates many input frames, resulting in lengthy convergence during global optimization. (c) Recurrent Networks.\nRNNs deal with temporal inputs and/or outputs and have been deployed in a myriad of applications ranging from video captioning  5 , video summarization  , and VSR   8. Two types of RNNs have been used for VSR. A many-to-one architecture is used in   where a sequence of LR frames is mapped to a single target HR frame. A many-to-many RNN has recently been used by 8 where an optical flow network to accepts L​Rt−1𝐿subscript𝑅𝑡1LR_{t-1} and L​Rt𝐿subscript𝑅𝑡LR_{t}, which is fed to an SR network along with L​Rt𝐿subscript𝑅𝑡LR_{t}. This approach was first proposed by  using bidirectional RNNs. However, the network has a small network capacity and has no frame alignment step. Further improvement is proposed by  using a motion compensation module and a ConvLSTM layer . (d) Optical Flow-Based Methods. The above methods estimate a single HR frame by combining a batch of LR frames and are thus computationally expensive. They often result in unwanted flickering artifacts in the output frames 7. To address this, 8 proposed a method that utilizes a network trained on estimating the optical flow along with the SR network. Optical flow methods allow estimation of the trajectories of moving objects, thereby assisting in VSR. [ref]26 warp video frames L​Rt−1𝐿subscript𝑅𝑡1LR_{t-1} and L​Rt+1𝐿subscript𝑅𝑡1LR_{t+1} onto L​Rt𝐿subscript𝑅𝑡LR_{t} using the optical flow method of , concatenate the three frames, and pass them through a CNN that produces the output frame S​Rt+1𝑆subscript𝑅𝑡1SR_{t+1}.  follow the same approach but replace the optical flow model with a trainable motion compensation network. (e) Pre-Training then Fine-Tuning v/s End-to-End Training. While most of the above-mentioned methods are end-to-end trainable, certain approaches first pre-train each component before fine-tuning the system as a whole in a final step   3. Our approach is a combination of (i) an RNN-based optical flow method that preserves spatio-temporal information in the current and adjacent frames as the generator and, (ii) a discriminator that is adept at ensuring the generated SR frame offers superior fidelity.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: into five types based on the approach to preserving temporal information.
