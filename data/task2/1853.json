      "content": "Paper Title: MPTP: Motion-Planning-aware Task Planning for Navigation in Belief Space\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAutonomous robots operating in complex real world scenarios require different levels of planning to execute  the assigned tasks. High-level (task) planning helps break down a given set of tasks into a sequence of sub-tasks. Actual execution of each of these sub-tasks would require low-level control actions to generate appropriate robot motions. In fact, the dependency between logical and geometrical aspects is pervasive in both task planning and execution. Hence, planning should be performed in the task-motion or the discrete-continuous space . In recent years, combining high-level task planning with low-level motion planning has been a subject of great interest among the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) communities. Traditionally, task planning and motion planning have evolved as two independent fields. AI planning frameworks  such as the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)  mainly focus on high-level task planning supposing that the geometric preconditions (e.g., grasping poses for a pick-up task [ref]3) for the robot motion to carry out these tasks are achievable. In reality, such an assumption can be catastrophic as an action or sequence of actions generated by the task planner might turn out to be unfeasible at the controller execution level. Over the past few years, Task-Motion Planning (TMP) for manipulation has received considerable interest among the research community  [ref]3   [ref]6 . Robot-based manipulation domain calls for discrete and continuous reasoning to execute the required action reliably. For example, a simple table top domain requires the robot to reason at the discrete level to decide the objects to be picked up and also the order of these high-level actions. The execution of these discrete actions require continuous reasoning in the configuration space of the robot to generate appropriate motions. Yet, a discrete action might turn out to be unfeasible due to the end-effector’s reachability workspace. This might be due to the availability of a partial map leading to unmodeled objects or occlusions leading to unobserved objects or simply because the robot is too close the target object, rendering a grasp action impossible. This presents the need for a tight coupling between task planning and motion planning, enabling an interface for efficient interaction between the symbolic and geometric layers. TMP for navigation presents different challenges in comparison to TMP for manipulation. As such, TMP for navigation has not yet received much attention and therefore lacks sufficient literature. TMP for navigation essentially involves  reasoning about different objects and their properties, deciding which objects to procure, selecting high-level actions that satisfy the low-level continuous motion constraints to navigate to the objects or other locations of interest, and finally procuring the objects and delivering it to the respective goal locations subject to task and motion constraints. For example, consider a robot in an office environment where it needs to deliver documents for evaluation to the respective project managers. At the task level, it is required that the robot first identifies the project in order to navigate to the respective sections, collect the documents and then deliver them to the project manager. A task planner computes a plan in terms of these symbolic actions, subject to minimizing a certain metric. This metric, for example, might correspond to different types of action costs or the number of actions. Since we are concerned with navigation, in this paper we associate the symbolic actions to their associated motion costs. Certain symbolic actions may not require robot motions. For example, for collecting a document, the robot may have to stay at a particular location for a given amount of time waiting for a human to place the document. Such actions are assigned a fixed cost. Selecting the best set of discrete actions for a given objective requires computing the navigation costs  (and other fixed costs) for each of these actions. Hence motion planning should be interleaved with task planning to compute the motion costs for each of the  respective discrete actions. Though it can be argued that the motion costs can be approximated a priori and fed to the task planner, in large knowledge-intensive domains such an assumption can be harder to justify, especially in the presence of localization and map uncertainty.  Moreover, real-world scenarios often induce uncertainties. Such uncertainties arise due to insufficient knowledge about the environment, inexact robot motion or imperfect sensing. In such scenarios, the robot poses or other variables of interest can only be dealt with, in terms of probabilities. Planning is therefore done in the belief space, which corresponds to the probability distributions over possible robot states. Consequently, for efficient planning and decision making, it is required to reason about future belief distributions due to candidate actions and the corresponding expected observations. Such a problem falls under the category of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) [ref]8. Our motion planner is therefore equipped to perform planning in partially-observable state-spaces with motion and sensing uncertainty. This paper extends the work presented in  providing a comprehensive discussion and an extensive performance evaluation. Specifically, this paper contributes to the literature with a Motion-Planning-aware Task Planning (MPTP) approach providing an interface between task and motion planning for navigating in large knowledge-intensive domains. Such domains require a robot to reason about different objects and locations to navigate to, subject to minimizing (or maximizing) the navigation cost (objective function). Our task-motion interface layer facilitates this reasoning by communicating the motion feasibility and the corresponding planned motion costs to the task planner, synthesizing an optimal plan. To this end, we develop a probabilistically complete Task-Motion Planning (TMP) framework for mobile robot navigation under partial-observability, embedding a motion planner within a task planner through an interface layer. We would like to stress the fact that our implementation is independent of any particular form of cost function. In this paper, we use a standard cost function (see Section 4) as the MPTP cost and compare it with different cost functions in Section 5. An overview of our MPTP approach is shown in Fig. 1. We define A={a1,…,an}𝐴subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛A=\\{a_{1},...,a_{n}\\} as the finite set of symbolic/discrete actions available to the task planner.  For example, let us again consider an office setting where a robot is tasked with collecting and delivering documents. In such a setting, some of the actions include, collect_document– which might correspond to a human placing the document on the robot and therefore the robot waiting at a specific location for a certain duration, deliver_document– similar to collect_document action but a human picks up the document, goto_region– corresponds to navigating through the environment. Once an action that require appropriate robot motions to be generated is expanded by the task planner, a call to an external library is triggered. The symbolic parameters are then converted to their corresponding geometric instantiations. For example, for an action that takes the robot to a particular  cubicle/region, the instantiations would be the different sampled poses in that cubicle. Once the map of the environment is obtained, the geometric instantiations can be pre-sampled. The instantiations give rise to different motion plans and the best among them is chosen according to a certain metric. The cost of the selected motion plan cost is then returned to the task planner as the cost of the corresponding action. The task-motion plan for changing the task state of the robot from the state sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} to si+1subscript𝑠𝑖1s_{i+1} is the ordered tuple of the action aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i} and the corresponding optimal path.  For instance, in the office setting where a robot navigates from one cubicle (sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}) to another (si+1subscript𝑠𝑖1s_{i+1}), the tuple is {goto_region,τi}goto_regionsubscript𝜏𝑖\\{\\texttt{goto\\_region},\\tau_{i}\\}. Here, goto_region is the task-level action aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i} and τisubscript𝜏𝑖\\tau_{i} is the planned trajectory for achieving this high-level action. This tuple is appended for all the task-level actions to generate the complete task-motion plan. While our approach is applicable to any domain that require task-motion interaction, we establish the key ideas in Section 4 through two different navigation domains and further validate our approach in Section 5 using the same.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: frameworks  such as the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)  mainly focus on high-level task planning supposing that the geometric preconditions (e.g., grasping poses for a pick-up task [ref]3) for the robot motion to carry out these tasks are achievable.
