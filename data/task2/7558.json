      "content": "Paper Title: FlaKat: A Machine Learning-Based Categorization Framework for Flaky Tests\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTest failures due to flakiness are not rare events and have a significant impact on the efficiency and reliability of software testing . A study conducted at Google found that 41% of the tests that alternate between pass and failure at least once were flaky . Another study at Microsoft identified flaky test failures within 26% of the total sampled builds . In addition, 5.7% of all the failed builds from 80 million test runs in 30 days were caused by a small fraction (0.02%) of flaky test failures . Simply ignoring flaky tests could have serious consequences. The investigation into Firefox crash reports suggests that ignoring test failures, even if they are flaky, can lead to a higher incidence of crashes . These results indicate that flaky tests can limit the efficiency of continuous integration by causing build failures that require time-consuming manual intervention from software developers. The most straightforward techniques for automatically detecting flaky tests are based on repeatedly re-running them [ref]30 . DeFlaker [ref]30 analyzes the difference in code coverage between consecutive versions of the same software with unstable outcomes. Spectrum-based fault localization  improved on the traditional coverage-based approach and can narrow down flaky tests in Python projects. One study presented iDFlakies, which is a framework based on executing test suites in randomized orders to detect order-dependent flaky tests  and  . NonDex [ref]34 is an approach that randomizes the implementations of various Java classes with non-deterministic specifications to identify implementation-dependent flaky tests . Another study presented Shaker, which targets flaky tests of the asynchronous wait and concurrency categories by introducing CPU and memory tasks to affect the ordering of regression tests . Techniques from the field of machine learning have also been applied to flaky test detection, such as FlakeFlagger  and FLAST [ref]18. These studies considered the presence of particular keywords in test case source code or other general test characteristics, such as execution time and line of code, as potential predictors of flaky tests  . Classifier trained on the flip rate, change of files and size of latest pull request also proved to be efficient in predicting flakiness . A new language model-based predictor for flaky test called Flakify statically predicts flakiness without accessing the production code in a black-box manner . A new feature set, Flake16  is developed to help improve ML-based detection for order-dependent and non-order-dependent falky test in Python projects. Depending on the cause of flakiness, the options for mitigating and repairing flaky tests may differ. In general, consistent coding guidelines and stable infrastructures are crucial foundation for avoiding flaky tests . Based on the findings from historical commits in Apache Software Foundation projects and surveying Mozilla developers, two studies   concluded that the most common type of fix for flaky tests of the asynchronous wait category involved a waitFor method or its equivalent. As for order-dependent tests that fail when run in isolation but pass when run with some other test , the most common fixes are to eliminate the dependency between its victim and brittle in the allocation and de-allocation of test methods by techniques such as creating a duplicate instance of some shared resource  . The iFixFlakies framework  was presented as the automatic repair of order-dependent flaky tests, which uses program statements from elsewhere in the test suite. Another study presented a template-based repair technique called DexFix   for automatically repairing implementation-dependent flaky tests, such as those detected by the previously mentioned detection tool NonDex [ref]34. Other than execution order, code instrumentation could also lead to test flakiness but are very rare in practice .\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: failures that require time-consuming manual intervention from software developers.
