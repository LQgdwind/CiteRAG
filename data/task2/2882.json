      "content": "Paper Title: AEFE: Automatic Embedded Feature Engineering For Categorical Features\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe study of automatic feature engineering and deep learning models is quite different, but they are similar in the goals of reducing time-consuming manual feature engineering and improving prediction accuracy just like NAS. Some of the early automatic feature engineering studies mostly focus on finding effective transformation functions, which are applied to the appropriate features, thus improving the prediction effect . FICUS  uses beam search to find features in the construction space, and takes advantage of Information Gain (IG) as a proxy function to judge whether the feature is valid. FCtree  also uses IG to filter the generated features. It trains the decision tree model and selects the structural features that can bring the gain at the same time. Unlike the way we attach weight to field combination, FCTree assigns weights to the transformation function and constantly updates them. FEADIS randomly selects features to construct and uses cross-validation to verify the efficacy of features, which can be regarded as a greedy strategy . What the above work has in common is that 1) feature construction only uses data of a single sample, 2) the construction paradigm is simple, and 3) they only apply to small datasets. Some studies attempt to use the learning model to improve automation and enhancement in the process of automatic feature engineering. ExploreKit  uses a ranking model to select the optimal constructor. Nargesian  defines whether to choose a particular transformation as a binary classification task, so a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) was trained on the meta-features of plenty datasets for prediction. It is worth noting that the above two studies adopt meta-learning in their framework. Besides, AutoLearn  automatically constructs two kinds of features with a regression model, which makes the machine learning task improve obviously. Our work integrates a gradient descent process of Matrix Factorization (MF) into the field combination search, which improves efficiency. Cognito  expresses the automatic feature problem as a tree-structured task: Each node is a dataset that joins the construction features, and each edge is a transformation function. AutoCross [ref]41 shared the same viewpoint but didn’t focus on feature engineering. Khurana  further describes the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and uses reinforcement learning to trade off factors like effectiveness and efficiency. These frameworks can iteratively use transformation functions to make the constructed features more complex. Features complicated by iterative transformation, while improving the effectiveness, are more difficult to understand. How to explain the meanings of a feature after multiple conversions? In order to construct more valuable features, Data Science Machine (DSM)  makes use of more samples information by using aggregation operations (Groupby) in the relational table, which makes DSM more practical in data mining tasks. Lam’s OneBM  improved DSM and added support for unstructured data. AFEM’s improvements focused on complex feature paradigms, which defined multiple families of features such as the family of social graph-based features [ref]13. These work for realistic data mining scenarios are more practical than some previous works. The above works consider constructing different forms of features with as many data types as possible to provide universality. However, the actual data mining tasks vary widely, so the unified solution has a limited effect, and it is challenging to introduce prior knowledge guidance. Furthermore, for most of the automatic feature engineering research, the construction process only uses the feature information, yet the label information is only used for verifying the validity of features, which makes the information captured by these frameworks different from that of the deep learning model (since deep learning model directly fits the relationship between features and labels). The interpretability of features or models, the complexity of finding high-order feature interactions, and the capability of handling high-dimensional sparse features are all points that need to be considered. To the best of our knowledge, most existing related works can only satisfy partial demands mentioned above, for example, deep learning models [ref]7   loss the interpretability of the features, and some automatic feature engineering framework    fail to generate combinatorial features from categorical features. The pros and cons of different methods are summarized in Table 2.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: Cognito  expresses the automatic feature problem as a tree-structured task: Each node is a dataset that joins the construction features, and each edge is a transformation function.
