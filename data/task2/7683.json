      "content": "Paper Title: Unleashing Unlabeled Data: A Paradigm for Cross-View Geo-Localization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLarge-area Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) aims to determine the localization of ground images by retrieving the most similar GPS-tagged satellite images¬†5. The easy availability of open-source GPS-tagged satellite images, such as Google Maps, helps users get accurate ground localization at a low cost ¬† [ref]41 and provides CVGL with great potential for various real-life applications, including person localization, automatic navigation, and augmented reality ¬†  . However, existing CVGL methods are usually supervised training with ground-truth correspondences of Ground images (Grds) and Satellite images (Sats), known as SCVGL. This label-driven nature brings some practical limitations. Firstly, obtaining accurately located ground images requires expensive devices (e.g., lidar devices¬† ), and matching ground and satellite images brings extra human costs¬†. Secondly, numerous non-corresponding ground and satellite images without GPS tags are available online but cannot be directly used for SCVGL. Lastly, SCVGL requires re-annotation for new or changed scenes, increasing the cost of human effort and resources. Given these limitations, an important question arises: can we uncover hidden correlations from cross-view images without label information? This motivates us to study how to utilize unlabeled data to start a retrieval system for CVGL. Regrettably, just as a ship needs a compass to find its way, without labels, the model may lose its optimized direction. This phenomenon is usually called cold-start problem¬† for un- and semi-supervised learning. To mitigate this issue, most unsupervised image retrievals (UIRs) label an informative subset of images first, guided by some common prior knowledge (e.g., category¬† or instance¬†[ref]15  information). Compared to them, CVGL has some unique characteristics illustrated in Fig.¬†1 and more details in Sec.¬†2.2. Specifically, existing retrievals ¬† [ref]15   have object-level cluster centers, such as some alarm, person or object ID, which includes many images from the same category or instance and enlighten them to apply cluster technologies ¬†  to get initial label sets, as can be seen in the upper row of Fig.¬†1. Differently, most CVGL¬† 5 methods are trained by one-to-one cross-view image pairs to learn spatial correspondences, which means, ‚Äúclass‚Äù information is not essential in the training process and CVGL is a fine-grained retrieval. The reference satellite images can only be retrieved by ground images in the same scene position by spatial correspondences, just like green lines in Fig.¬†1(B). Besides, in Fig.¬†1(C), we collect the similarity scores between each image and its kùëòk-th retrieved image and average the scores of more than 5000 image pairs in different tasks. It‚Äôs clear that compared to existing instance retrieval ¬†[ref]15 and image retrieval ¬†, the average similarity scores of CVGL¬† are lower and drop fast from 1-st to the right. This comparison further suggests our task is non-class and fine-grained. Therefore, we cannot cold-start the unsupervised CVGL using existing image retrieval methods. In this paper, we design a framework for unsupervised and semi-supervised CVGL. Following a common design ¬† , in the unsupervised setting, we separate our framework into two components: the cold-start stage to produce initial pseudo-labels and the semi-supervised stage to refine labels. Moreover, the semi-supervised stage can also be utilized alone for CVGL (details in Sec.¬†4.4). In our framework, non-class and spatial corresponding characteristics are fully utilized, making the unsupervised CVGL possible and the semi-supervised CVGL a good performance. In the cold-start stage, the significant imaging and view gaps make ground and satellite images distinct features in the same scene. To address this issue, we attract cross-view images in the same position by spatial corresponding prior knowledge. Specifically, we project the ground panorama into a 3D coordinate system and obtain its bird‚Äôs-eye-view image through a spherical transform ¬† [ref]41. We then fill the unknown regions and reduce imaging gaps by a CycleGAN model ¬†2, resulting in a fake satellite image (e.g., Fig.¬†2(B)) aligned with the ground panorama. Finally, we replace unknown ground-satellite pairs with known ground-fake pairs as trained positive pairs, enabling successful retrieval of more than 40% image pairs on CVACT and achieving cold-start initialization. In the semi-supervised stage, the initial labels may be noisy or insufficient, which limits the final performance. We re-rank pseudo-labels to enhance the quality and quantity of pseudo-labels by using non-class characteristics. Specifically, the perfectly paired cross-view images are two views of the same scene, which should be mutually retrievable and dissimilar to other images, as shown in Fig.¬†1(C-3). We filter out many ‚Äúerror‚Äù labels that do not meet this requirement with a threshold, improving the correctness ratios of the remaining labels from around 30% to 80% on CVACT. However, the number of pseudo-labels is only about 20% of the dataset. Therefore, as the model‚Äôs knowledge increases, we progressively introduce more challenging samples by adjusting our filtering mechanisms to get more pseudo-labels. Eventually, our model achieves competitive performance with recent supervised approaches ¬†5 6 .\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: the most similar GPS-tagged satellite images¬†5.
