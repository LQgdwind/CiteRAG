      "content": "Paper Title: NASOA: Towards Faster Task-oriented Online Fine-tuning with a Zoo of Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFine-tuning using pre-trained models becomes the de-facto standard\nin the field of computer vision because of its impressive results\non various downstream tasks such as fine-grained image classification\n [ref]53, object detection [ref]20  [ref]56\nand segmentation  .  [ref]20\nverified that fine-tuning pre-trained networks outperform training\nfrom scratch. It can further help to avoid over-fitting \nas well as reduce training time significantly [ref]20. Due\nto those merits, many cloud computing and AutoML pipelines provide\nfine-tuning services for an online stream of upcoming users with new\ndata, different tasks and time limits. In order to save the user’s\ntime, money, energy consumption, or even CO2 emission, an efficient\nonline automated fine-tuning framework is practically useful and in\ngreat demand. Thus, we propose to explore faster online fine-tuning. The conventional practice of fine-tuning is to adopt a set of predefined\nhyperparameters for training a predefined model .\nIt has three drawbacks in the current online setting: 1) The design\nof the backbone model is not optimized for the upcoming fine-tuning\ntask and the selection of the backbone model is not data-specific.\n2) A default setting of hyperparameters may not be optimal across\ntasks and the training settings may not meet the time constraints\nprovided by users. 3) With the incoming tasks, the regular diagram\nis not suitable for this online setting since it cannot memorize and\naccumulate experience from the past fine-tuning tasks. Thus, we propose\nto decouple our faster fine-tuning problem into two parts: finding\nefficient fine-tuning networks and generating optimal fine-tuning\nschedules pertinent to specific time constraints in an online learning\nfashion. Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithms demonstrate\npromising results on discovering top-accuracy architectures, which\nsurpass the performance of hand-crafted networks and saves human’s\nefforts        \nas well as studying NAS across tasks and datasets  .\nHowever, those NAS works usually focus on inference time/FLOPS optimization\nand their search space is not flexible enough which cannot guarantee\nthe optimality for fast fine-tuning. In contrast, we resort to developing\na NAS scheme with a novel flexible search space for fast fine-tuning.\nOn the other hand, hyperparameter optimization (HPO) methods such\nas grid search , Bayesian optimization (BO)\n 5, and BOHB \nare used in deep learning and achieve good performance. However, those\nsearch-based methods are computationally expensive and require iterative\n“trial and error”, which violate our goal for faster adaptation\ntime. In this work, we propose a novel Neural Architecture Search and Online\nAdaption framework named NASOA. First, we conduct an offline NAS for\ngenerating an efficient fine-tuning model zoo. We design a novel\nblock-level and macro-structure search space to allow a\nflexible choice of the networks. Once the efficient training model\nzoo is created offline NAS by Pareto optimal models, the online user\ncan enjoy the benefit of those efficient training networks without\nany marginal cost. We then propose an online learning algorithm with\nan adaptive predictor to modeling the relation between different hyperparameter,\nmodel, dataset meta-info and the final fine-tuning performance. The\nfinal training schedule is generated directly from selecting the fine-tuning\nregime with the best predicted performance. Benefiting from the experience\naccumulation via online learning, the diversity of the data and the\nincreasing results can further continuously improve our regime generator.\nOur method behaves in a one-shot fashion and doesn’t involve additional\nsearching cost as HPO, endowing the capability of providing various\ntraining regimes under different time constraints. We also theoretically\nprove the convergence of the optimality of our proposed online model. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple widely used fine-tuning\ndatasets. The searched model zoo ET-NAS is more training efficient\nthan SOTA ImageNet models, e.g. 5x training faster than RegNetY-16GF,\nand 1.7x faster than EfficientNetB3. Moreover, by using the whole\nNASOA, our online algorithm achieves superior fine-tuning results\nin terms of both accuracy and fine-tuning speed, i.e. improving around\n2.1% accuracy than the best performance in RegNet series under various\ntasks; saving 40x computational cost comparing to the BOHB method. Our contributions are summarized as follows: We make the first effort to propose a faster fine-tuning pipeline\nthat seamlessly combines the training-efficient NAS and online adaption\nalgorithm. Our NASOA can effectively generate a personalized fine-tuning\nschedule of each desired task via an adaptive model for accumulating\nexperience from the past tasks. The proposed novel joint block/macro level search space enables\na flexible and efficient search. The resulting model zoo ET-NAS is\nmore training efficient than very strong ImageNet SOTA models e.g.\nEfficientNet, RegNet. All the ET-NAS models have been released to\nhelp the community skipping the computation-heavy NAS stage and directly\nenjoy the benefit of NASOA. The whole NASOA pipeline achieves much better fine-tuning results\nin terms of both accuracy and fine-tuning efficiency than current\nfine-tuning best practice and HPO method, e.g. , 40x faster compared\nto the BOHB method.\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: using pre-trained models becomes the de-facto standard\nin the field of computer vision because of its impressive results\non various downstream tasks such as fine-grained image classification\n [ref]53, object detection [ref]20  [ref]56\nand segmentation  .
