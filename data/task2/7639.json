For one, measured perplexity on benchmarks can depend on the context length  [ref]52. Different systems may have been trained or evaluated using different context lengths, and this might make model perplexity scores less directly comparable. One way to try and quantify the magnitude of this effect is to look at studies that compare the change in perplexity given a change in context length. For example, based on the scaling relations relating loss and context length from [ref]52 and , back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that loss reductions each year due to increasing context length could be 10-60% as large as the loss reductions from algorithmic progress. In particular, [ref]52 finds a relation between context length cùëêc and validation loss for different versions of the LLaMa 2 language model. We can estimate ballpark values for context length over time based on data from [ref]50, and use this to roughly estimate how expanding context lengths has decreased loss over time (e.g. a decrease of a few percent per year). We can then compare the magnitude of this effect to the contribution of algorithmic progress to decreases in loss, and we typically arrive at values between 10-60% of the overall algorithmic progress contribution.111111This of course depends on variables like how quickly context lengths have expanded over time‚Äîdetails of this calculation can be found in this spreadsheet. We perform a similar analysis with the scaling relation described in , with similar results. If this rough calculation is correct, it suggests that increasing context length may have been a fairly important dimension along which algorithms have been improving. On top of measured reductions to averaged perplexity per token, one might also consider the increasing ability of language models to perform long-context tasks to be largely downstream of algorithmic progress in itself. Being able to handle long contexts is a key motivator for several recent algorithmic innovations [ref]31  , and this has likely grown very substantially since the introduction of FlashAttention  [ref]50. We consider this to be an important avenue for further investigation.\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: Another consideration when analyzing algorithmic innovation in language models pertains to the context length.
