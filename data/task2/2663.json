      "content": "Paper Title: BGT-Net: Bidirectional GRU Transformer Network for Scene Graph Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual understanding of scenes are broadly covered by object detection  [ref]23 and localization   for single or multiple objects. Evolved from detection of various objects, image segmentation   is another research topic which helps to understand the attributes of the scene. While these techniques supply some useful information of the image, but a scene also largely depends on the interactions or relations between objects. This idea led to scene graphs which describe the scene by incorporating the objects and their pairwise relations. This relation is represented by a directed edge pointing from the subject to the object. Evaluating a scene by detecting the objects and the relationships between them allows building a graph consisting of nodes representing the objects and the edges representing the relations. It consists of number of triplets represented in <<subject-relationship-object>> form. They help in aiding deep understanding of the scene for various vision tasks such as visual reasoning , image captioning  6, image retrieval 2   and visual question answering   . To improve these applications and their benefits, it is crucial to have a well performing model which generates scene graphs that corresponds to the actual visual scene. The directional nature of a triplet in scene graph defines the subject and object in a triplet. Scene graph generation (SGG) is considered a complex problem in computer vision because of the imbalanced nature of the datasets and intricate relationship information. As stated in MOTIFS 5, combinations of at least two triplets appear in many images. So, the presence of some objects highly increase the probability of the presence of other objects. Communication i.e. information flow between the detected objects has been shown to be beneficial for improving the performance of scene graph generation models 5 . The frequency distribution of the relationship within the Visual Genome dataset is long-tailed 3. Due to this, scene graph detection models can already achieve good performance by only predicting the most frequent relationship for the respective subject-object pair. Figure 1 illustrates the problem almost every SGG model faces. In many object pairings, the relationship is trivial and mostly possessive or geometric (e.g. on, under, or next to). The detailed descriptive and semantic relationships such as jumping over as shown in Figure 1 (given in the ground-truth) will not often be predicted since it rarely occurs. For creating models that represent less frequent relationships more precisely, an approach to handle dataset bias must be found. Since the bias in the dataset can also be beneficial, e.g. the probability for the relationship reading will be much higher than for eating if the subject-object pair given is person and book , traditional debiasing methods will most likely strongly harm the performance of the model. For this reason, the handling of the bias in the dataset is one of the most under-explored properties of the scene graph generation task. In this paper, we propose a novel model for SGG. The objects present in an image are highly dependent on the presence of other objects, for instance, if there is a bike in the scene, then there will be two tyres in the same scene with a very high probability. This model uses a bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) layer to send information from every object to every other. This allows benefiting from the fact that some objects will increase the possibility for specific other objects to be present. Subsequently to this layer that covers the object-object communication, a transformer encoder layer is used to predict the object classes. Objects and their preferred or observed relations are closely connected. To extract the information for the edge, a similar approach as in 5 is followed to specify the edge context for every detected object. We use an additional transformer encoder layer for this task of extracting the edge context features. Using the object representations, their respective edge context is then used for the relationship prediction. In this procedure, a log-softmax function is applied to the subject-object pairwise relationship distribution. Following this Frequency Softening (FS), a Bias Adaptation (BA) approach [ref]21 is used. The bias for every subject-object is controlled by the bias adaptation term which takes scene-specific inputs to vary the amount of added bias. The contribution summary of the proposed BGT-Net is given in four modules to improve scene graph generation performance: (1) Object-object communication is performed using the BiGRU’s. (2) A transformer encoder with scaled-dot-product attention is used to predict object classes after they have received information about the other objects present in the scene. (3) For every object, a second transformer encoder is used to gather information for the edges. (4) To tackle the bias in the relationship distribution, FS and BA [ref]21 is adopted. The evaluation efficacy of the proposed BGT-Net is performed on three SGG datasets: Visual Genome (VG) 3, OpenImages (OI) 4, and Visual Relationship Detection (VRD) . We perform extensive experiments and ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of BGT-Net. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed BGT-Net outperforms the state of the art SGG results on a common metric Recall@K and on different datasets to the best of our knowledge. The framework of BGT-Net uses Faster R-CNN (with VGG-16 or ResNext-101 as the backbone) to get the visual features and spatial locations of object proposals. It includes various sub-modules for the task of SGG: (1) New technique of using BiGRU for object-object communication, (2) Novel method of using a transformer encoder with scaled-dot-product attention for predicting object classes after they have received information of the other objects present in the scene, (3) Additional transformer encoder is used to get the edge features, (4) FS and BA are used for dealing with the bias in the dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: Visual understanding of scenes are broadly covered by object detection  [ref]23 and localization   for single or multiple objects.
