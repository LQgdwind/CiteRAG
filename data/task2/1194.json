      "content": "Paper Title: On the Overlooked Pitfalls of Weight Decay and How to Mitigate Them: A Gradient-Norm Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we demonstrate that the large gradient norm is a highly undesirable property in deep learning because large gradient norms correspond to multiple pitfalls. First, small gradient norms are required for good convergence, which is desired in optimization theory . Popular optimizers also expect clear convergence guarantees . The optimizers with no convergence guarantees may cause undesirable training behaviors in practice. Second, regularizing the gradient norm has been recognized as an important beneficial regularization effect in recent papers 8   [ref]55 [ref]54. Li et al., 8 and Geiping et al.,  expressed implicit regularization of stochastic gradients as where L​(θ,X)𝐿𝜃𝑋L(\\theta,X) indicate the loss over one data minibatch X∈ℬ𝑋ℬX\\in\\mathcal{B}, |ℬ|ℬ|\\mathcal{B}| is the number of minibatches per epoch, and 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is the expected squared gradient norms over each minibatch. Recent studies, Zhao et al., [ref]55 and Zhang et al., [ref]54, also successfully improved generalization by explicitly adding the gradient-norm penalty into stochastic optimization. Obviously, penalizing the gradient norm is considered as an important and beneficial regularizer in deep learning. Third, large gradient norms may theoretically indicate poor generalization according to the gradient-norm generalization measures  . For example, Theorem 11 of Li et al., 2019a  derived a gradient-norm-based generalization error upper bound that uses the squared gradient norms, written as where n𝑛n is the training data size, σt2superscriptsubscript𝜎𝑡2\\sigma_{t}^{2} is the gradient noise variance at the t𝑡t-th iteration, and 𝒢​(θt)=1|ℬ|​∑X∈ℬ‖∇L​(θ,X)‖2𝒢subscript𝜃𝑡1ℬsubscript𝑋ℬsuperscriptnorm∇𝐿𝜃𝑋2\\mathcal{G}(\\theta_{t})=\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{B}|}\\sum_{X\\in\\mathcal{B}}\\|\\nabla L(\\theta,X)\\|^{2} is the squared gradient norm with the batch size as 1. An et al.,  presented more empirical evidences for supporting the gradient-norm-based generalization bound (7). Moreover, large gradient norms are also believed to be closely related to minima sharpness 0      , while sharp minima often indicate poor generalization     1. As our analysis focuses on the large gradient norm at the final phase (or the terminated solution) of training, our conclusion is actually not contradicted to the viewpoint  9 0 that the gradient-noise regularization effect of large initial learning rates at the early phase of training is beneficial. We also report that the gradient norm and the squared gradient norm show very similar tendencies in our experiments. For simplicity, we mainly use 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} as the default gradient norm measure in this paper, unless we specify it otherwise. As we discussed above, the squared gradient norm 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is more closely related to implicit gradient regularization, generalization bounds, and SWD than other gradient norms. Overall, the theoretical results above supported that the small gradient norm is a desirable property in deep learning. However, our theoretical analysis suggests that weight decay can lead to large gradient norms and hence hurt generalization. We suggest that gradient-norm-centered poor convergence and generalization can lead to the serious but overlooked performance degradation of weight decay.\n\nReference markers found: [55]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]55: guarantees may cause undesirable training behaviors in practice.
