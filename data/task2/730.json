      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting Modified Greedy Algorithm for Monotone Submodular Maximization with a Knapsack Constraint\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe carry out experiments on two applications to demonstrate the effectiveness of our upper bound. All the experiments are conducted on a Windows machine with an Intel Core 2.6GHz i7-7700 CPU and 32GB RAM. Viral marketing in social networks.\nViral marketing in social networks   [ref]40 [ref]37        is one of the most important topics in data mining in recent years. In this application, we consider influence maximization  on a social network G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) with a set V𝑉V of vertices (representing users) and a set E𝐸E of edges (representing connections among users). The goal is to seed some users with incentives (e.g., discount, free samples, or monetary payment) to boost the revenue by leveraging the word-of-mouth effects on other users. We adopt the widely-used influence diffusion model called the independent cascade model . Each edge (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) is associated with a propagation probability pu,vsubscript𝑝𝑢𝑣p_{u,v}. Initially, the seed vertices S𝑆S are active, while all the other vertices are inactive. When a vertex u𝑢u first becomes active, it has a single chance to activate each inactive neighbor v𝑣v with success probability pu,vsubscript𝑝𝑢𝑣p_{u,v}. This process repeats until no more activation is possible. The influence spread f​(S)𝑓𝑆f(S) of the seed set S𝑆{S} is the expected number of active vertices produced by the above process. Kempe\net al.  show that f​(S)𝑓𝑆f(S) is nondecreasing monotone submodular. We consider budgeted influence maximization that aims to find a vertex set S𝑆S maximizing f​(S)𝑓𝑆f(S) with the total cost c​(S)𝑐𝑆c(S) capped by a budget b𝑏b, where each vertex v𝑣v is associated with a distinct cost c​(v)𝑐𝑣c(v) and c​(S)=∑v∈Sc​(v)𝑐𝑆subscript𝑣𝑆𝑐𝑣c(S)=\\sum_{v\\in S}c(v). Note that the influence diffusion is a random process. We use the advanced sampling technique in  to estimate the influence spread in which 200200200 random Monte-Carlo subgraphs are generated. We experiment with four real datasets from   with millions of vertices, namely,\nPokec (1.61.61.6M vertices and 30.630.630.6M edges), Orkut (3.13.13.1M vertices and 117.2117.2117.2M edges), LiveJournal (4.84.84.8M vertices and 69.069.069.0M edges), and Twitter (41.741.741.7M vertices and 1.51.51.5G edges).\nAs in , we set pu,vsubscript𝑝𝑢𝑣p_{u,v} of each edge (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) to the reciprocal of v𝑣v’s in-degree, and set c​(v)𝑐𝑣c(v) proportional to v𝑣v’s out-degree to emulate that popular users require more incentives to participate. Due to massive data sizes, we cannot compute the true optima. To better visualize the tightness of different bounds on the optimum, we measure the ratios of the solution values obtained by MGreedy to the upper bounds, e.g., f​(Sm)/Λ𝑓subscript𝑆mΛf(S_{\\mathrm{m}})/\\Lambda, which represent the approximation guarantees achieved by MGreedy. We note that Leskovec et al.  developed an upper bound of f​(Sg)+Δ​(b∣Sg)𝑓subscript𝑆gΔconditional𝑏subscript𝑆gf(S_{\\mathrm{g}})+\\Delta(b\\mid S_{\\mathrm{g}}) in our notations on the optimum. For comparisons, we evaluate both the ratios obtained for our upper bound ΛΛ\\Lambda and the upper bound developed by Leskovec et al. . Figure 2 shows the results. Note that a larger ratio represents a tighter upper bound. We observe that the ratio calculated by our upper bound is usually better than 0.90.90.9, which is much larger than both the constant factor of 0.4050.4050.405 and the ratio calculated by Leskovec et al.’s bound. This demonstrates that our upper bound ΛΛ\\Lambda is quite close to the optimum for the tested cases. Branch-and-bound algorithm for budgeted maximum coverage. Tight bounds are valuable to advancing algorithmic efficiency. Consider the information retrieval problem where one is given a bipartite graph constructed between a set V𝑉V of objects (e.g., documents, images etc.) and a bag of words W𝑊W. There is an edge ev,wsubscript𝑒𝑣𝑤e_{v,w} if the object v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V contains the word w∈W𝑤𝑊w\\in W. A natural choice of the function f𝑓f has the form |Γ​(X)|Γ𝑋|\\Gamma(X)|, where Γ​(X)Γ𝑋\\Gamma(X) is the neighborhood function that maps a subset of objects X⊆V𝑋𝑉X\\subseteq V to the set of words Γ​(X)⊆WΓ𝑋𝑊\\Gamma(X)\\subseteq W presented in the objects. Meanwhile, selecting an object v∈X𝑣𝑋v\\in X will incur a cost c​(v)𝑐𝑣c(v). Intuitively, one may want to maximize the diversity (i.e., the number of words) by selecting a set of objects subject to a cost budget b𝑏b. This problem can be seen as budgeted maximum coverage. As a proof-of-concept, we use synthetic data that define |V|=100𝑉100|V|=100 and |W|=100𝑊100|W|=100 and randomly generate an edge between v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V and w∈W𝑤𝑊w\\in W with probability p=0.02𝑝0.02p=0.02.\nWe report the average results of 101010 instances. We compare the branch-and-bound algorithm using our upper bound ΛΛ\\Lambda (called “Our method”) against the data-correcting algorithm (called DCA) [ref]12 which is a branch-and-bound algorithm for maximizing a submodular function.\nIn particular, in each branch of a search lattice [A,B]𝐴𝐵[A,B], the branch-and-bound algorithm needs to find an upper bound on the value of any candidate solution S𝑆S satisfying A⊆S⊆B𝐴𝑆𝐵A\\subseteq S\\subseteq B and c​(S)≤b𝑐𝑆𝑏c(S)\\leq b. To achieve this goal, we first compute an upper bound Λ′superscriptΛ′\\Lambda^{\\prime} on the optimum of maxT⊆B∖A⁡{f​(T∣A):c​(T)≤b−c​(A)}subscript𝑇𝐵𝐴:𝑓conditional𝑇𝐴𝑐𝑇𝑏𝑐𝐴\\max_{T\\subseteq B\\setminus A}\\{f(T\\mid A)\\colon c(T)\\leq b-c(A)\\} as f​(T∣A)𝑓conditional𝑇𝐴f(T\\mid A) is also a monotone submodular function. Then, f​(A)+Λ′𝑓𝐴superscriptΛ′f(A)+\\Lambda^{\\prime} is an upper bound on the optimum of branch [A,B]𝐴𝐵[A,B].\nOn the other hand, DCA uses f​(A)+Δ​(b−c​(A)∣A)𝑓𝐴Δ𝑏conditional𝑐𝐴𝐴f(A)+\\Delta(b-c(A)\\mid A) as the upper bound, which is always (much) looser than ours.\nDCA considers homogeneous costs only and thus we set c​(v)=1𝑐𝑣1c(v)=1 for each object v𝑣v. We manually terminate the algorithm if it cannot finish within 222 hours.\nTable 1 shows the running time of DCA and our algorithm when the cost budget b𝑏b increases from 111 to 101010. As can be seen, our algorithm can find the optimal solution within 222 seconds for all the cases tested whereas DCA runs 1–4 orders of magnitude slower than our algorithm when b≤5𝑏5b\\leq 5 and even fails to find the solution within 222 hours when b≥6𝑏6b\\geq 6.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: our upper bound.
