Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

The analytic result of this unbiased modification is that if the empirical risk is strongly convex and the risk function over individual samples are both convex and L-smooth then the error in estimating gradients of 𝒢​(𝒘~)𝒢~𝒘\\mathcal{G}(\\tilde{{\\bm{w}}}) is not only bounded but also linearly converges to zero (refer to  for proof). Under some conditions,  showed that this convergence rate is not largely impacted if a noisier estimate than original 𝒢​(𝒘~)𝒢~𝒘\\mathcal{G}(\\tilde{{\\bm{w}}}) proposed by SVRG is chosen for full batch gradients. [ref]5 investigated applying SVRG in non-convex problems and [ref]10 generalized it for mini-batch SGD. [ref]21 proposed SARAH, a biased version of SVRG that progressively updates the estimate for full gradients for optimizations steps applied in between taking two snapshots.\nOur algorithm could be thought as a distributed variant of SARAH where 𝒢​(𝒘~)𝒢~𝒘\\mathcal{G}(\\tilde{{\\bm{w}}}) is approximated by biased pseudo-gradients (and renamed to 𝒉𝒉{\\bm{h}}).
