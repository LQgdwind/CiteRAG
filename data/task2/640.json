      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-Gradient Reinforcement Learning with an Objective Discovered Online\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMeta-gradient reinforcement learning is a family of gradient-based meta learning algorithms for learning and adapting differentiable components (denoted as meta-parameters η𝜂\\eta) in the RL update rule. The key insight of meta-gradient RL is that most commonly used update rules are differentiable, and thus the effect of a sequence of updates is also differentiable. Meta-gradient RL is a two-level optimisation process. A meta-learned inner loss Lηinnersubscriptsuperscript𝐿inner𝜂L^{\\text{inner}}_{\\eta}\nis parameterised by meta-parameters η𝜂\\eta and the agent tries to optimise Lηinnersubscriptsuperscript𝐿inner𝜂L^{\\text{inner}}_{\\eta} to update θ𝜃\\theta. Given a sequence of trajectories 𝒯={τi,τi+1,τi+2,…,τi+M,τi+M+1}𝒯subscript𝜏𝑖subscript𝜏𝑖1subscript𝜏𝑖2…subscript𝜏𝑖𝑀subscript𝜏𝑖𝑀1\\mathcal{T}=\\{\\tau_{i},\\tau_{i+1},\\tau_{i+2},\\dots,\\tau_{i+M},\\tau_{i+M+1}\\}, we apply multiple steps of gradient descent updates to the agent θ𝜃\\theta according to the inner losses Lηinner​(τi,θi)subscriptsuperscript𝐿inner𝜂subscript𝜏𝑖subscript𝜃𝑖L^{\\text{inner}}_{\\eta}(\\tau_{i},\\theta_{i}). For each trajectory τ∈𝒯𝜏𝒯\\tau\\in\\mathcal{T}, we have: Consider keeping η𝜂\\eta fixed for M𝑀M updates to the agent parameter θ𝜃\\theta: A differentiable outer loss Louter​(τi+M+1,θi+M)superscript𝐿outersubscript𝜏𝑖𝑀1subscript𝜃𝑖𝑀L^{\\text{outer}}(\\tau_{i+M+1},\\theta_{i+M}) is then applied to the updated agent parameters θ′=θi+Msuperscript𝜃′subscript𝜃𝑖𝑀\\theta^{\\prime}=\\theta_{i+M}. The gradient of this loss is taken w.r.t. meta-parameters η𝜂\\eta and then used to update η𝜂\\eta via gradient descent: We call this quantity ∇ηLηoutersubscript∇𝜂subscriptsuperscript𝐿outer𝜂\\nabla_{\\eta}L^{\\text{outer}}_{\\eta} the meta-gradient. We can iterate this procedure during the training of the agent θ𝜃\\theta and repeatedly update the meta-parameters η𝜂\\eta. The meta-gradient flows through the multiple gradient descent updates to the agent θ𝜃\\theta, i.e., the whole update procedure from θisubscript𝜃𝑖\\theta_{i} to the outer loss of the final updated agent parameter θi+Msubscript𝜃𝑖𝑀\\theta_{i+M}. By applying chain rule, we have ∂Louter∂η=∂Louter∂θ′​∂θ′∂ηsuperscript𝐿outer𝜂superscript𝐿outersuperscript𝜃′superscript𝜃′𝜂\\frac{\\partial{L^{\\text{outer}}}}{\\partial{\\eta}}=\\frac{\\partial{L^{\\text{outer}}}}{\\partial{\\theta^{\\prime}}}\\frac{\\partial{\\theta^{\\prime}}}{\\partial{\\eta}}. In practice, we can use automatic differentiation packages to compute the meta gradient ∂Louter∂ηsuperscript𝐿outer𝜂\\frac{\\partial{L^{\\text{outer}}}}{\\partial{\\eta}} with comparable compute complexity as the forward pass. The meta-gradient algorithm above can be applied to any differentiable component of the update rule, for example to learn the discount factor γ𝛾\\gamma and bootstrapping factor λ𝜆\\lambda , intrinsic rewards  [ref]45, and auxiliary tasks .\nIn this paper, we apply meta-gradients to learn the meta-parameters of the update target gηsubscript𝑔𝜂g_{\\eta} online, where η𝜂\\eta are the parameters of a neural network. We call this algorithm FRODO (Flexible Reinforcement Objective Discovered Online). The following sections instantiate the FRODO algorithm for value prediction, value-based control and actor-critic control, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: algorithm above can be applied to any differentiable component of the update rule, for example to learn the discount factor γ𝛾\\gamma and bootstrapping factor λ𝜆\\lambda , intrinsic rewards  [ref]45, and auxiliary tasks .\nIn this paper, we apply meta-gradients to learn the meta-parameters of the update target gηsubscript𝑔𝜂g_{\\eta} online, where η𝜂\\eta are the parameters of a neural\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
