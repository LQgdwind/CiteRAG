      "content": "Paper Title: An Algorithm-Hardware Co-Optimized Framework for Accelerating N:M Sparse Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExtensive research has concentrated on the design of high-performance and energy-efficient DNN hardware accelerators               [ref]26  [ref]28.\nHowever, most of these works focus on CNN and RNN computations, and not as much scrutiny has been given to accelerating Transformer-based networks with self-attention mechanisms.\n As a pioneer work, [ref]10 proposed a dense systolic array accelerator along with the partitioning scheme for FPGA-based acceleration of Transformers.\nMoreover, FTRANS  exploited block-circulant matrix-based weight representation for Transformer acceleration.\nHowever, both of them fail to utilize the sparsity of parameters in Transformers, thereby limiting the speedup of model deployment.\nA3 , SpAtten , and Sanger  merely focused on the speedup potential for the sparse attention mechanism, all of which can hardly satisfy the needs of agile and efficient deployment of Transformer models.\nOPTIMUS  and EdgeBERT  holistically accelerate Transformers with unstructured sparse matrix multiplications and save energy by skipping the computations related to those zero-value parameters.\nNevertheless, the unstructured sparsity leads to irregular data access, making both designs suffer low computational efficiency.\n exploited the coarse-grained block-based sparsity pattern for accelerating Transformers, while this sparsity pattern is so coarse that the models can hardly achieve a considerable sparsity ratio with acceptable accuracy. In summary, it is hard for all these works to achieve satisfying speedup and efficiency of Transformer deployment due to the lack of attention to model sparsity, limited sparse potential exploration on the whole Transformer models, or restricted computational efficiency for sparse Transformers.\nTo address above issues, this work presents an algorithm-hardware co-optimization framework to realize flexible and efficient deployment of Transformers by leveraging general N:M sparsity patterns.\nFor algorithm optimization, we focus on how to generate a series of N:M sparse Transformers in high quality and efficiency.\nFor hardware optimization, we concentrate on designing a flexible and efficient dedicated architecture that can accelerate N:M sparse Transformers with high computational efficiency.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Extensive research has concentrated on the design of high-performance and energy-efficient DNN hardware accelerators               [ref]26  [ref]28.\nHowever, most of these works focus on CNN and RNN computations, and not as much scrutiny has been given to accelerating Transformer-based networks with self-attention mechanisms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
