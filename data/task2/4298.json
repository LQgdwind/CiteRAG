      "content": "Paper Title: Securing Optimized Code Against Power Side Channels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCryptographic algorithms, symmetric/shared key or asymmetric/private\nkey ones, rely on safeguarding the shared secret key or the private\nkey, respectively.\nThe exposure of these keys to unintended users compromises the\nsecurity of these algorithms.\nUnfortunately, the software implementation of cryptographic algorithms\nmay reveal information about their secret/private\nkeys¬†.\nIn particular, the attacker may observe what is termed\nside-channel information, notably observing the execution\ntime¬† or the power\nconsumption¬† ,\nduring the execution of the algorithm to extract information about the\nsecret keys.\nThese attacks are attractive especially because usually they do not\nrequire expensive equipment.\nThis paper focuses on  Power Side Channel (PSC) attacks. Software masking is a widely-used approach to mitigate PSC\nattacks¬† , hiding\nsecret information by splitting a secret into nùëõn randomized shares.\nThe attacker has to retrieve all shares in order to acquire the secret\nvalue.\nWhile software masking can be an effective mitigation, compiler code\ngeneration may optimize it away.\nMoreover,  Transition-Based Leakage (TBL) sources, such as register reuse or memory-access order,\nare decided at compile time by low-level compiler\ntransformations¬†[ref]6  . To mitigate these compiler-induced power side-channel leaks at the\nbinary level there are techniques based on\ncompilation¬† [ref]9 0\nand binary rewriting with hardware\nemulation¬†1 2 3.\nAll these approaches mitigate compiler-generated leakages using local\ntransformations¬†3  1.\nThe methods that depend on hardware emulation are typically accurate\nbut may introduce significant overhead¬†1\nand are hardware specific.\nFor example, Rosita¬†1, an emulation-based\napproach, propose a mitigation that introduces an overhead ranging\nfrom 21% to 64% for ARM Cotrex M0.\nWang et¬†al.¬†\nperform their mitigation using a standard compiler with no high-level\noptimizations (-O0).\nThis is a common practice for security research to ensure the absence\nof compiler-induced mitigation\ninvalidation¬†[ref]6 4.\nHowever, unoptimized code is highly inefficient, and\nmay even introduce additional leaks due to the\nheavy use of the program stack, as discussed in\nSection¬†II. Vu et¬†al. present an approach that enables\nsecure optimization of masked code at a higher\nlevel¬†4 5.\nThis approach applies high-level compiler optimizations by disallowing\nsecure-code removal and operand reordering (due to associativity of\nsome operations) and are able to generate correctly masked code.\nHowever, they do not deal with TBLs. Currently, the state-of-the-art approaches are unable to generate code\nthat is both efficient and secure in the face of TBLs that enable\nPSC attacks.\nTo address this challenge, this paper proposes  Secure by Construction Code Generation (SecCG), an\noptimizing compiler approach that provably preserves security\nproperties against PSC.\nAt the middle-end, SecCG handles code generated using\nregister promotion (promoting program variables from memory to\nregisters) as a high-level optimization.\nThen, SecCG uses a constraint-based method to generate code\nthat is secure against PSC attacks.\nSecCG controls the quality of the mitigated program by\nefficiently searching the best possible low-level implementation\naccording to a processor cost model¬†6.\nThe security model of SecCG is hardware agnostic and can be\nextended with additional architectural constraints.\nSecCG is suitable for predictable architectures with no\nadvanced microarchitectural features, such as caches or speculative\nexecution.\nIn our experiments with twelve masked implementations on Mips32 and\nARM Thumb, SecCG improves the execution time of the generated\ncode from 75% to a speedup of 8 compared to\nnon-optimized code at a overhead of up to 7% compared to\nnon-secure optimized code.\nThis comes at a cost on compilation time and reduced scalability.\nIn summary, this paper makes the following contributions: a compiler approach to generate leak-free, low-overhead assembly\ncode for high-level software-masked programs; a constraint model for optimized and PSC-secure code\ngeneration; a proof that the constraint model guarantees the generation of\nsecure code for a non-trivial leakage model; and experimental results on two architectures showing that the\nperformance overhead of our mitigation is low and its efficiency\nbenefits are significant, compared to current approaches.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: may optimize it away.\nMoreover,  Transition-Based Leakage (TBL) sources, such as register reuse or memory-access order,\nare decided at compile time by low-level compiler\ntransformations¬†[ref]6  .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
