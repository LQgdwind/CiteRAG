      "content": "Paper Title: Effective Communications: A Joint Learning and Communication Framework for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning over Noisy Channels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCommunication is essential for our society.\nHumans use language to communicate ideas, which has given rise to complex social structures, and scientists have observed either gestural or vocal communication in other animal groups, complexity of which increases with the complexity of the social structure of the group .\nCommunication helps to achieve complex goals by enabling cooperation and coordination  .\nAdvances in our ability to store and transmit information over time and long distances have greatly expanded our capabilities, and allows us to turn the world into the connected society that we observe today.\nCommunication technologies are at the core of this massively complex system. Communication technologies are built upon fundamental mathematical principles and engineering expertise.\nThe fundamental quest in the design of these systems have been to deal with various imperfections in the communication channel (e.g., noise and fading) and the interference among transmitters.\nDecades of research and engineering efforts have produced highly advanced networking protocols, modulation techniques, waveform designs and coding techniques that can overcome these challenges quite effectively.\nHowever, this design approach ignores the aforementioned core objective of communication in enabling coordination and cooperation.\nTo some extent, we have separated the design of a communication network that can reliably carry signals from one point to another from the ‘language’ that is formed to achieve coordination and cooperation among agents. This engineering approach was also highlighted by Shannon and Weaver in  by organizing the communication problem into three “levels”: They described level A as the technical problem, which tries to answer the question “How accurately can the symbols of communication be transmitted?”.\nLevel B is referred to as the semantic problem, and asks the question “How precisely do the transmitted symbols convey the desired meaning?”.\nFinally, Level C, called the effectiveness problem, strives to answer the question “How effectively does the received meaning affect conduct in the desired way?”.\nAs we have described above, our communication technologies mainly deal with Level A, ignoring the semantics or the effectiveness problems.\nThis simplifies the problem into the transmission of a discrete message or a continuous waveform over a communication channel in the most reliable manner.\nThe semantics problem deals with the meaning of the messages, and is rather abstract.\nThere is a growing interest in the semantics problem in the recent literature [ref]6    .\nHowever, these works typically formulate the semantics as an end-to-end joint source-channel coding problem, where the reconstruction objective can be distortion with respect to the original signal [ref]11 , or a more general function that can model some form of ‘meaning’ [ref]6   [ref]15, which goes beyond reconstructing the original signal111To be more precise, remote hypothesis testing, classification, or retrieval problems can also be formulated as end-to-end joint source-channel coding problems, albeit with a non-additive distortion measure.. In this paper, we deal with the ‘effectiveness problem’, which generalizes the problems in both level A and level B. In particular, we formulate a multi-agent problem with noisy communications between the agents, where the goal of communications is to help agents better cooperate and achieve a common goal. See Fig. 1 for an illustration of a multi-agent grid-world, where agents can communicate through noisy wireless links.\nIt is well-known that multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problems are notoriously difficult, and are a topic of continuous research. Originally, these problems were approached by treating each agent independently, as in a standard single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) problem, while treating other agents as part of the state of the environment. Consensus and cooperation are achieved through common or correlated reward signals. However, this approach leads to overfitting of policies due to limited local observations of each agent and it relies on other agents not varying their policies . It has been observed that these limitations can be overcome by leveraging communication between the agents  . Recently, there has been significant interest in the emergence of communication among agents within the RL literature   0 1.\nThese works consider MARL problems, in which agents have access to a dedicated communication channel, and the objective is to learn a communication protocol, which can be considered as a ‘language’ to achieve the underlying goal, which is typically translated into maximizing a specific reward function.\nThis corresponds to Level C, as described by Shannon and Weaver in , where the agents change their behavior based on the messages received over the channel in order to maximize their reward.\nHowever, the focus of the aforementioned works is the emergence of communication protocols within the limited communication resources that can provide the desired impact on the behavior of the agents, and, unlike Shannon and Weaver, these works ignore the physical layer characteristics of the channel. Our goal in this work is to consider the effectiveness problem by taking into account both the channel noise and the end-to-end learning objective.\nIn this problem, the goal of communication is not “reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point” as stated by Shannon in , which is the foundation of the communication and information theoretic formulations that have been studied over the last seven decades.\nInstead, the goal is to enable cooperation in order to improve the objective of the underlying multi-agent game. As we will show later in this paper, the codes that emerge from the proposed framework can be very different from those that would be used for reliable communication of messages. We formulate this novel communication problem as a MARL problem, in which the agents have access to a noisy communication channel. More specifically, we formulate this as a multi-agent partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and construct RL algorithms that can learn policies that govern both the actions of the agents in the environment and the signals they transmit over the channel. A communication protocol in this scenario should aim to enable cooperation and coordination among agents in the presence of channel noise. Therefore, the emerging modulation and coding schemes must not only be capable of error correction/ compensation, but also enable agents to share their knowledge of the environment and/or their intentions. We believe that this novel formulation opens up many new directions for the design of communication protocols and codes that will be applicable in many multi-agent scenarios from teams of robots to platoons of autonomous cars 2, to drone swarm planning 3. We summarize the main contributions of this work as follows: We propose a novel formulation of the “effectiveness problem” in communications, where agents communicate over a noisy communication channel in order to achieve better coordination and cooperation in a MARL framework. This can be interpreted as a joint communication and learning approach in the RL context [ref]15. The current paper is an initial study of this general framework, focusing on scenarios that involve only point-to-point communications for simplicity. More involved multi-user communication and coordination problems will be the subject of future studies. The proposed formulation generalizes the recently studied “learning to communicate” framework in the MARL literature   0 1, where the underlying communication channels are assumed to be error-free.\nThis framework has been used to argue about the emergence of natural languages 4 5; however, in practice, there is inherent noise in any communication medium, particularly in human/animal communications. Indeed, languages have evolved to deal with such noise. For example, Shannon estimated that the English language has approximately 75% redundancy.\nSuch redundancy provides error correction capabilities.\nHence, we argue that the proposed framework better models realistic communication problems, and the emerging codes and communication schemes can help better understand the underlying structure of natural languages. The proposed framework also generalizes communication problems at level A, which have been the target of most communication protocols and codes that have been developed in the literature.\nChannel coding, source coding, as well as joint source-channel coding problems, and their multi-user extensions can be obtained as special cases of the proposed framework.\nThe proposed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework provides alternative approaches to the design of codes and communication schemes for these problems that can outperform existing ones.\nWe highlight that there are very limited practical code designs in the literature for most multi-user communication problems, and the proposed framework and the exploitation of deep representations and gradient-based optimization in DRL can provide a scalable and systematic methodology to make progress in these challenging problems. We study a particular case of the proposed general framework as an example, which reduces to a point-to-point communication problem.\nIn particular, we show that any single-agent Markov decision process (MDP) can be converted into a multi-agent partially observable MDP (MA-POMDP) with a noisy communication link between the two agents.\nWe consider both the binary symmetric channel (BSC), the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, and the bursty noise (BN) channel for the noisy communication link and solve the MA-POMDP problem by treating the other agent as part of the environment, from the perspective of one agent.\nWe employ deep Q-learning (DQN) 6 and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) 7 to train the agents.\nSubstantial performance improvement is observed in the resultant policy over those learned by considering the cooperation and communication problems separately. We then present the joint modulation and channel coding problem as an important special case of the proposed framework.\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning techniques to design practical channel coding and modulation schemes 8 9 0 [ref]11 1 2.\nHowever, with the exception of 2, most of these approaches assume that the channel model is known and differentiable, allowing the use of supervised training by directly backpropagating through the channel using the channel model. In this paper, we learn to communicate over an unknown channel solely based on the reward function by formulating it as a RL problem. The proposed DRL framework goes beyond the method employed in 2, which treats the channel as a random variable, and numerically approximates the gradient of the loss function. It is shown through numerical examples that the proposed DRL techniques employing DDPG 7, and actor-critic 3 algorithms significantly improve the block error probability (BLER) of the resultant code.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: in the most reliable manner.\nThe semantics problem deals with the meaning of the messages, and is rather abstract.\nThere is a growing interest in the semantics problem in the recent literature [ref]6    .\nHowever, these works typically formulate the semantics as an end-to-end joint source-channel coding problem, where the reconstruction objective can be distortion with respect to the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
