      "content": "Paper Title: Refl-Spanners: A Purely Regular Approach to Non-Regular Core Spanners\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe information extraction framework of document spanners has been introduced by Fagin, Kimelfeld, Reiss, and Vansummeren  as a formalisation of the query language AQL, which is used in IBM’s information extraction engine SystemT. A document spanner performs information extraction by mapping a document, formalised as a word w𝑤w over a finite alphabet ΣΣ\\Sigma, to a relation over so-called spans of w𝑤w, which are intervals [i,j⟩𝑖𝑗[i,j\\rangle with 0⩽i⩽j⩽|w|+10𝑖𝑗𝑤10\\leqslant i\\leqslant j\\leqslant|w|+1. The document spanners (or simply spanners, for short)\nintroduced in  follow a two-stage approach:\nPrimitive spanners extract relations directly from the input\ndocument, which are then further manipulated by using particular algebraic operations.\nAs primitive spanners,  introduces\nvset-automata and regex-formulas, which are variants of\nnondeterministic finite automata and regular expressions,\nrespectively, that can use meta-symbols \\tensor[𝗑]▷\\tensor[^{\\mathsf{x}}]{\\triangleright}{} and\n\\tensor[]◁𝗑\\tensor[]{\\triangleleft}{{}^{\\mathsf{x}}}, where 𝗑𝗑\\mathsf{x} is a variable from a set\n𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} of variables, in order to bind those variables to start and\nend positions of spans, therefore extracting an |𝒳|𝒳|\\mathcal{X}|-ary\nspan-relation, or a table with columns labelled by the variables in\n𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}. For example, α=(\\tensor[𝗑]▷(𝚊∨𝚋)∗\\tensor[]◁)𝗑⋅(\\tensor[𝗒]▷(𝚊∗∨𝚋∗)\\tensor[]◁)𝗒𝚌∗\\alpha=(\\tensor[^{\\mathsf{x}}]{\\triangleright}{}(\\mathtt{a}\\operatorname{\\vee}\\mathtt{b})^{*}\\tensor[]{\\triangleleft}{{}^{\\mathsf{x}}})\\cdot(\\tensor[^{\\mathsf{y}}]{\\triangleright}{}(\\mathtt{a}^{*}\\operatorname{\\vee}\\mathtt{b}^{*})\\tensor[]{\\triangleleft}{{}^{\\mathsf{y}}})\\mathtt{c}^{*} is a regex-formula and it describes a spanner\n⟦α⟧delimited-⟦⟧𝛼\\llbracket\\alpha\\rrbracket by considering for a given word w𝑤w all\npossibilities of how w𝑤w can be generated by α𝛼\\alpha and for each\nsuch generation of w𝑤w, the variables 𝗑𝗑\\mathsf{x} and 𝗒𝗒\\mathsf{y} extract\nthe spans that correspond to those subwords of w𝑤w that are generated\nby the subexpressions \\tensor[𝗑]▷(𝚊∨𝚋)∗\\tensor[]◁𝗑\\tensor[^{\\mathsf{x}}]{\\triangleright}{}(\\mathtt{a}\\operatorname{\\vee}\\mathtt{b})^{*}\\tensor[]{\\triangleleft}{{}^{\\mathsf{x}}} and \\tensor[𝗒]▷(𝚊∗∨𝚋∗)\\tensor[]◁𝗒\\tensor[^{\\mathsf{y}}]{\\triangleright}{}(\\mathtt{a}^{*}\\operatorname{\\vee}\\mathtt{b}^{*})\\tensor[]{\\triangleleft}{{}^{\\mathsf{y}}}, respectively. This means that ⟦α⟧(w)\\llbracket\\alpha\\rrbracket(w) is a binary relation over w𝑤w’s spans. For example, on\ninput w=𝚊𝚋𝚊𝚊𝚌𝑤𝚊𝚋𝚊𝚊𝚌w=\\mathtt{a}\\mathtt{b}\\mathtt{a}\\mathtt{a}\\mathtt{c}, we have ⟦α⟧(w)={([1,3⟩,[3,5⟩),([1,4⟩,[4,5⟩),([1,5⟩,[5,5⟩)}\\llbracket\\alpha\\rrbracket(w)=\\{([1,3\\rangle,[3,5\\rangle),([1,4\\rangle,[4,5\\rangle),([1,5\\rangle,[5,5\\rangle)\\}, since α𝛼\\alpha can\ngenerate \\tensor[𝗑]▷𝚊𝚋\\tensor[]◁\\tensor𝗑[𝗒]▷𝚊𝚊\\tensor[]◁𝚌𝗒\\tensor[^{\\mathsf{x}}]{\\triangleright}{}\\mathtt{a}\\mathtt{b}\\tensor[]{\\triangleleft}{{}^{\\mathsf{x}}}\\tensor[^{\\mathsf{y}}]{\\triangleright}{}\\mathtt{a}\\mathtt{a}\\tensor[]{\\triangleleft}{{}^{\\mathsf{y}}}\\mathtt{c}, \\tensor[𝗑]▷𝚊𝚋𝚊\\tensor[]◁\\tensor𝗑[𝗒]▷𝚊\\tensor[]◁𝚌𝗒\\tensor[^{\\mathsf{x}}]{\\triangleright}{}\\mathtt{a}\\mathtt{b}\\mathtt{a}\\tensor[]{\\triangleleft}{{}^{\\mathsf{x}}}\\tensor[^{\\mathsf{y}}]{\\triangleright}{}\\mathtt{a}\\tensor[]{\\triangleleft}{{}^{\\mathsf{y}}}\\mathtt{c} and \\tensor[𝗑]▷𝚊𝚋𝚊𝚊\\tensor[]◁\\tensor𝗑[𝗒]▷\\tensor[]◁𝚌𝗒\\tensor[^{\\mathsf{x}}]{\\triangleright}{}\\mathtt{a}\\mathtt{b}\\mathtt{a}\\mathtt{a}\\tensor[]{\\triangleleft}{{}^{\\mathsf{x}}}\\tensor[^{\\mathsf{y}}]{\\triangleright}{}\\tensor[]{\\triangleleft}{{}^{\\mathsf{y}}}\\mathtt{c}. The rows of the\nextracted relation are also called span-tuples. The\nvset-automata follow the same principle, but take the form of\nnondeterministic finite automata.\nIt is known that, with respect to defining spanners, vset-automata are\nmore expressive than regex-formulas.\nThe class of spanners expressible by vset-automata are called\nregular spanners; for the sake of presentation, we denote this class of regular spanners by 𝗋𝖾𝗀−𝔖𝗋𝖾𝗀𝔖\\operatorname{\\mathsf{reg-}\\mathfrak{S}} for the remainder of this introduction (there are different ways of characterising regular spanners and also different semantics (see  ); these aspects shall be discussed in more detail below). The algebraic operations used for further manipulating the extracted\nspan-relations comprise the union ∪\\cup, natural join ⋈⋈\\bowtie,\nprojection π𝜋\\pi (with the obvious meaning) and string-equality\nselection ς𝒵=subscriptsuperscript𝜍𝒵\\varsigma^{=}_{\\mathcal{Z}}. The latter is a unary\noperator that is parameterised by a set 𝒵⊆𝒳𝒵𝒳\\mathcal{Z}\\subseteq\\mathcal{X} of variables, and it selects exactly those rows of the table\nfor which all spans of columns in 𝒵𝒵\\mathcal{Z} refer to (potentially different occurrences of) the same subwords of w𝑤w. The core spanners (capturing the core of SystemT’s query language AQL) introduced in  are defined as 𝗋𝖾𝗀−𝔖{∪,⋈,π,ς=}superscript𝗋𝖾𝗀𝔖⋈𝜋superscript𝜍\\operatorname{\\mathsf{reg-}\\mathfrak{S}}^{\\{\\cup,\\bowtie,\\pi,\\varsigma^{=}\\}}, i. e., the closure of regular spanners under the operations ∪\\cup, ⋈⋈\\bowtie, π𝜋\\pi and ς=superscript𝜍\\varsigma^{=} (these operations are interpreted as operations on spanners in the natural way). A central result of  is that the operations ∪\\cup, ⋈⋈\\bowtie and π𝜋\\pi can be directly incorporated into the regular spanners, i. e., 𝗋𝖾𝗀−𝔖{∪,⋈,π}=𝗋𝖾𝗀−𝔖superscript𝗋𝖾𝗀𝔖⋈𝜋𝗋𝖾𝗀𝔖\\operatorname{\\mathsf{reg-}\\mathfrak{S}}^{\\{\\cup,\\bowtie,\\pi\\}}=\\operatorname{\\mathsf{reg-}\\mathfrak{S}}. This is due to the fact that regular spanners are represented by finite automata and therefore the closure properties for regular languages carry over to regular spanners by similar automaton constructions.\nThis also holds in the case of so-called schemaless semantics  (i. e., variables in span-tuples can be undefined). However, as soon as we also consider the operator of string-equality selection, the picture changes considerably. In terms of expressive power, it can be easily seen that not all core spanners are regular spanners, simply because for all regular spanners S𝑆S the language {w∈Σ∗∣S​(w)≠∅}conditional-set𝑤superscriptΣ𝑆𝑤\\{w\\in\\Sigma^{*}\\mid S(w)\\neq\\emptyset\\} is regular, which is not necessarily the case for core spanners. As shown in , we can nevertheless represent any core spanner S∈𝗋𝖾𝗀−𝔖{∪,⋈,π,ς=}𝑆superscript𝗋𝖾𝗀𝔖⋈𝜋superscript𝜍S\\in\\operatorname{\\mathsf{reg-}\\mathfrak{S}}^{\\{\\cup,\\bowtie,\\pi,\\varsigma^{=}\\}} in the form π𝒴​ς𝒵1=​ς𝒵2=​…​ς𝒵k=​(S′)subscript𝜋𝒴superscriptsubscript𝜍subscript𝒵1superscriptsubscript𝜍subscript𝒵2…superscriptsubscript𝜍subscript𝒵𝑘superscript𝑆′\\pi_{\\mathcal{Y}}\\varsigma_{\\mathcal{Z}_{1}}^{=}\\varsigma_{\\mathcal{Z}_{2}}^{=}\\ldots\\varsigma_{\\mathcal{Z}_{k}}^{=}(S^{\\prime}) for a regular spanner S′superscript𝑆′S^{\\prime} (this is called the core-simplification lemma in ). Regular spanners have excellent algorithmic properties: enumerating S​(w)𝑆𝑤S(w) can be done with linear preprocessing and constant delay, even if the spanner is given as vset-automaton (see  ), while spanner containment or equivalence is generally decidable, and can even be decided efficiently if we additionally require the spanner to be represented by a certain deterministic vset-automaton (see ).111As is common in the literature, the input vset-automata are assumed to be sequential, which means that every accepting run describes a valid span-tuple; it is well known that dropping this natural requirement yields intractability (see, e. g., ). However, in terms of complexity, we have to pay a substantial price for adding string-equality selections to regular spanners. It has been shown in [ref]13 that for core spanners the typical problems of query evaluation and static analysis are 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\operatorname{\\mathsf{NP}}- or 𝖯𝖲𝗉𝖺𝖼𝖾𝖯𝖲𝗉𝖺𝖼𝖾\\operatorname{\\mathsf{PSpace}}-hard, or even undecidable (see Table 1). The results from [ref]13 identify features that are, from an intuitive point of view, sources of complexity for core spanners. Thus, the question arises whether tractability can be achieved by restricting core spanners accordingly. We shall illustrate this with some examples. Consider a regex formula α=\\tensor[𝗑1]▷Σ∗\\tensor[]◁\\tensor𝗑1[𝗑2]▷Σ∗\\tensor[]◁…𝗑2\\tensor[𝗑n]▷Σ∗\\tensor[]◁𝗑n\\alpha=\\tensor[^{\\mathsf{x}_{1}}]{\\triangleright}{}\\Sigma^{*}\\tensor[]{\\triangleleft}{{}^{\\mathsf{x}_{1}}}\\tensor[^{\\mathsf{x}_{2}}]{\\triangleright}{}\\Sigma^{*}\\tensor[]{\\triangleleft}{{}^{\\mathsf{x}_{2}}}\\ldots\\tensor[^{\\mathsf{x}_{n}}]{\\triangleright}{}\\Sigma^{*}\\tensor[]{\\triangleleft}{{}^{\\mathsf{x}_{n}}}. Then checking, for some 𝒵1,𝒵2,…,𝒵k⊆{𝗑1,𝗑2,…,𝗑n}subscript𝒵1subscript𝒵2…subscript𝒵𝑘subscript𝗑1subscript𝗑2…subscript𝗑𝑛\\mathcal{Z}_{1},\\mathcal{Z}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathcal{Z}_{k}\\subseteq\\{\\mathsf{x}_{1},\\mathsf{x}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathsf{x}_{n}\\}, whether the empty tuple is in (π∅ς𝒵1=ς𝒵2=…ς𝒵k=(⟦α⟧))(w)(\\pi_{\\emptyset}\\varsigma_{\\mathcal{Z}_{1}}^{=}\\varsigma_{\\mathcal{Z}_{2}}^{=}\\ldots\\varsigma_{\\mathcal{Z}_{k}}^{=}(\\llbracket\\alpha\\rrbracket))(w), is identical to checking whether w𝑤w can be factorised into n𝑛n factors such that for each 𝒵isubscript𝒵𝑖\\mathcal{Z}_{i} all factors that correspond to the variables in 𝒵isubscript𝒵𝑖\\mathcal{Z}_{i} are the same. This is the pattern matching problem with variables (or the membership problem for pattern languages), a well-known 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\operatorname{\\mathsf{NP}}-complete problem (see, e. g., [ref]17). However, checking for a (non-empty) span-tuple t𝑡t whether it is in (ς𝒵1=ς𝒵2=…ς𝒵k=(⟦α⟧))(w)(\\varsigma_{\\mathcal{Z}_{1}}^{=}\\varsigma_{\\mathcal{Z}_{2}}^{=}\\ldots\\varsigma_{\\mathcal{Z}_{k}}^{=}(\\llbracket\\alpha\\rrbracket))(w) can be easily done in polynomial time, since the task of checking the existence of a suitable factorisation boils down to the task of evaluating a factorisation that is implicitly given by t𝑡t. Hence, instead of blaming the string-equality selections for intractability, we could as well blame the projection operator. Can we achieve tractability by restricting projections instead of string-equality selections? Another feature that yields intractability is that we can use string-equality selections in order to concisely express the intersection non-emptiness of regular languages (a well-known 𝖯𝖲𝗉𝖺𝖼𝖾𝖯𝖲𝗉𝖺𝖼𝖾\\operatorname{\\mathsf{PSpace}}-complete problem). For example, let r1,r2,…,rnsubscript𝑟1subscript𝑟2…subscript𝑟𝑛r_{1},r_{2},\\ldots,r_{n} be some regular expressions, and let α=\\tensor[𝗑1]▷r1\\tensor[]◁\\tensor𝗑1[𝗑2]▷r2\\tensor[]◁…𝗑2\\tensor[𝗑n]▷rn\\tensor[]◁𝗑n\\alpha=\\tensor[^{\\mathsf{x}_{1}}]{\\triangleright}{}r_{1}\\tensor[]{\\triangleleft}{{}^{\\mathsf{x}_{1}}}\\tensor[^{\\mathsf{x}_{2}}]{\\triangleright}{}r_{2}\\tensor[]{\\triangleleft}{{}^{\\mathsf{x}_{2}}}\\ldots\\tensor[^{\\mathsf{x}_{n}}]{\\triangleright}{}r_{n}\\tensor[]{\\triangleleft}{{}^{\\mathsf{x}_{n}}}. Then there is a word w𝑤w with (ς{𝗑1,𝗑2,…,𝗑n}=(⟦α⟧))(w)≠∅(\\varsigma_{\\{\\mathsf{x}_{1},\\mathsf{x}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathsf{x}_{n}\\}}^{=}(\\llbracket\\alpha\\rrbracket))(w)\\neq\\emptyset if and only if ⋂i=1nℒ⁡(ri)≠∅subscriptsuperscript𝑛𝑖1ℒsubscript𝑟𝑖\\bigcap^{n}_{i=1}\\operatorname{\\mathcal{L}}(r_{i})\\neq\\emptyset. So string-equality selections do not only check whether the same subword has several occurrences, but also, as a “side-effect”, check membership of this repeated subword in the intersection of several regular languages. Can we achieve tractability by somehow limiting the power of string-equality selections to the former task? A third observation is that by using string-equality selections on overlapping spans, we can use core spanners to express rather complex word-combinatorial properties. For example, we can even express word equations as core spanners (see [13, Proposition 3.7, Example 3.8, Theorem 3.13] for details). Can we achieve tractability by requiring all variables that are subject to string-equality selections to extract only pairwise non-overlapping spans?\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: requirement yields intractability (see, e. g., ). However, in terms of complexity, we have to pay a substantial price for adding string-equality selections to regular spanners. It has been shown in [ref]13 that for core spanners the typical problems of query evaluation and static analysis are 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\operatorname{\\mathsf{NP}}- or 𝖯𝖲𝗉𝖺𝖼𝖾𝖯𝖲𝗉𝖺𝖼𝖾\\operatorname{\\mathsf{PSpace}}-hard, or even undecidable\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
