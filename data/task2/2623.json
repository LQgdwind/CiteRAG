Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Their information is shown in Table I. miniImageNet. miniImageNet is proposed by , which is a subset of ImageNet . It contains 100 classes with 600 images per class, which covers animals, food, tools, furniture and etc. Due to its universality, it is usually employed as the source domain in CD-FSL. In our work, we follow the split in , in which we apply train and validation set for training. CUB. CUB-200 (CUB) [ref]39 is a benchmark dataset for fine-grained bird recognition, including 200 classes with a total of 11,788 images. We take its test set as one of the target domains, following the split in . Cars. Stanford Cars (Cars)  is proposed for fine-grained car classification. It contains 16,185 images of 196 classes of cars, whose labels are typically at the level of Make, Model, and Year. Places. Places365-Standard (Places) [ref]42 is a benchmark dataset for the scene understanding task, which totally contains 1,803,460 images within 365 scene categories. The number of images per class varies from 3,068 to 5,000. Plantae. This dataset is extracted from , which contains 200 species of plants. Since the natural world is heavily imbalanced, the number of each class is different but reaches at least 100 samples. CropDieases. This dataset [ref]44 is a public dataset of 54,306 diseased and healthy plant samples, labeling 14 crop species and 26 diseases. The version in CD-FSL is reorganized with the format “crop species_disease”, which contains 38 classes. EuroSAT. It is a novel dataset based on Sentinel-2 satellite images , which covers 13 spectral bands with a total of 27,000 labeled and geo-referenced images. And it contains 10 classes, including annual crop, permanent crop, pastures, highway, residential buildings, industrial buildings, and etc. ISIC. ISIC2018 (ISIC)  consists of 10,015 dermatoscopic images and is publicly available through the ISIC archive. This benchmark dataset is employed for comparisons with machine learning and human experts. ChestX. ChestX-ray8 (ChestX)  is a new chest X-ray database, which comprises 108,948 frontal view X-ray images of 32,717 unique patients with 14 types of disease pattern. Note that the splits of CropDieases, EuroSAT, ISIC, and ChestX we process are exactly the same as  .\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: etc. Due to its universality, it is usually employed as the source domain in CD-FSL.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
