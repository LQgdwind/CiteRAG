      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Mixture Models with Expectation-Maximization for End-to-end Deep Clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe further test our algorithm on four image datasets commonly used for unsupervised clustering,\nSTL10  111STL10 - https://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/,\nCIFAR10/100  222CIFAR10 & CIFAR100 - https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html and\nMNIST  333MNIST - http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.\nSTL10 consists of 13k labeled samples and 100k unlabelled samples. We only cluster the labeled set as the unlabelled set contains additional classes. CIFAR100 contains 100 classes and the data are further abstracted to 20 super-classes, each super-class containing 5 classes. Following other clustering work [ref]3  , we cluster the CIFAR100 dataset to the 20 super-classes and other datasets to the standard numbers of categories. We use a 9-layer CNN for the STL10 dataset, a 7-layer network for CIFAR10/100, and a 5-layer network for the MNIST dataset. The network architectures are detailed in Table¬†2. Before feeding the images to the NN, if RGB, we convert them to single-channel grayscale. We process the single-channel images with vertical and horizontal Sobel filters. Thus, NN input is a stack of two planes of similar height and width to the original image (2√óH√óW2ùêªùëä2\\times H\\times W), carrying vertical edges and horizontal edges. Such pre-processing prevents the network from overfitting to colors and enables learning of general structures. We use the two-fold optimization shown in Sec.¬†7 and Algorithm¬†1, maintaining two Adam  optimizers, one for EM optimization (LR = 5e-5) and the other for consistency optimization (LR = 1e-4). It is important to assign a higher LR for consistency optimization as if learning general semantic features gets high priority over learning cluster representations; clustering will be richer and more accurate. We train our models for 250 epochs with a batch size of 128 and Œ≥=5ùõæ5\\gamma=5, with the full datasets apart from STL10 where we use the labeled set. We compare our approach with traditional and state-of-the-art deep clustering methods in Table¬†3. Here, we evaluate the trained model‚Äôs unsupervised classification accuracy and the normalized mutual information (NMI). Since we cannot expect the predicted class indexes to match the labels due to the unsupervised training setting, we use the Hungarian algorithm  to assign the predicted cluster index to the actual label as a linear sum assignment . We report our model performance when trained with only the mixture-EM optimization with both original and augmented images (Eq.¬†(15)) and when trained with the two-fold optimization (Algorithm¬†1). For each dataset, we report the average accuracy of our algorithm over six trials. For the two-fold optimization, we also report the margin of error, considering 95% confidence interval. When trained with only the mixture-EM optimization for both original and transformed images, our models surpass all traditional clustering algorithms and existing deep clustering methods, which still rely on k-means such as Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) [ref]3 and DeepCluster . The two-fold optimization further improves the performance of the mixture-EM optimization, surpassing end-to-end deep clustering methods such as DECCA, SCAE , DAC , ADC  and IIC  in most cases. IIC  uses both labeled and unlabelled spaces of STL10 and, when trained with only the labeled portion, achieves only 49.9%. Furthermore, IIC uses many augmented samples in a batch by repeated augmentation (5 times). With augmentation once per batch, they only achieve 47% for the STL10 dataset. Also, IIC uses multiple heads with over-clustering strategies to improve overall performance. In contrast, our framework reports an impressive 57.93% when trained with only the labeled portion, with lesser image augmentation, which is imposed only once per batch. We show that IIC with only one head achieves inferior performance in our training setting with lesser augmentation to both mixture-EM optimization and the two-fold optimization. The consistency optimization term in the two-fold optimization shares the same intuition to IIC, maintaining a similar model response to the original and its transformed images. Hence, we can conclude that our two-fold optimization improves sole consistency optimization in clustering. Figure 7 further shows the learning curves of IIC in our setting and the two-fold optimization, validating this fact. It is important to note that certain deep image clustering methods report superior performance to our method [ref]23  [ref]27 . However, most approaches are multi-stage methods consisting of initialization methods, multiple losses, and fine-tuning methods. For example, most of the performance improvement of SCAN can be attributed to the pre-text task learned prior to the clustering. In addition, SCAN also uses self-labeled fine-tuning. While our mixture-EM formulation optimization can also be extended with such pre-text learning, heavier augmentation, fine-tuning such as self-labeling, we omit such additions in this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: set contains additional classes.
