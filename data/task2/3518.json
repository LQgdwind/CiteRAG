      "content": "Paper Title: RL-PGO: Reinforcement Learning-based Planar Pose-Graph Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBundle adjustment (BA) is a process that plays a significant role in computer vision applications today, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and on the back-end of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms . This process involves estimating the 3D coordinates describing the scene and pose of the camera concurrently. This estimation is typically performed by optimally minimizing a cost function which minimizes re-projection error. In large complex scenes, however, the number of landmarks are significantly more prominent, which will, in turn increase the computation time and may affect real-time performance. When converting the problem of this type, one can either avoid taking into account all historical data from previous time steps and apply a sliding window technique or eliminate the optimization of the landmarks . The latter is commonly referred to as pose-graph optimization. These relative pose measurements are typically obtained from cameras, laser sensors, IMUs, or wheel odometry. Given odometric or loop closing measurements at successive time intervals, the objective of PGO is to return the optimal configuration of pose estimates, which maximally explain the available measurements observed. The computation of the maximum likelihood estimate of robot poses results in a high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem with multiple local minima. State-of-the-art methods in today’s modern era view SLAM and BA as Maximum a posteriori (MAP) or Maximum Likelihood inference. A specific class of graphs often analyzes both problems, known as factor graphs . There exist instances of SLAM problems which consist of highly non-convex cost functions, attributed to system nonlinearity, high levels of noise corruption, large inter-nodal distance spacing, and incorrect data associations from the front end . This further results in cost functions with large valleys , which may cause classical gradient-based approaches to fail or converge at unsatisfactory solutions, as depicted in Fig. 1-(c). This work, shows that our proposed reinforcement learning (RL) agent can perform exceptionally well on graphs with poor initial guesses. The agent can be utilized to search and explore the pose trajectory space configurations by applying the optimal retractions [ref]7 directly to the desired poses, with the goal of returning and recovering the optimal global trajectory. In certain situations, obtaining ground truth trajectory labels in the SLAM domain may be laborious and expensive. The main advantage of leveraging a reinforcement learning-based agent is that existing supervised networks require to be trained on a large collection of labeled data. Suitable or empirical datasets used for label-based training are not always guaranteed . Our contributions can be summarized as follows: The first DRL model to learn a policy that predicts the optimal orientation retractions [ref]7 from pose-graph observations for the application of planar PGO. The proposed modular encoder-agent architecture is comprised of two main components. The first component is a neural network initially proposed in  for graph optimality classification. The second is a recurrent-based soft actor-critic (SAC) 0 agent whose policy predicts the optimal orientation retractions [ref]7. A planar pose-graph environmental framework based on 1 and GUI for visualization during evaluation. The environment and the proposed agent will be made publicly available111https://sites.google.com/view/rl-pgo to encourage more research into developing and comparing other RL approaches in the pose-graph domain. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks illustrate the accuracy of the proposed agent, and further demonstrate the generalization capability of the agent to graphs never seen before during training. The paper is organized as follows: Sec. II provides an overview of the related works. Sec. III includes preliminary definitions and related terminology. In Sec. IV, we present our proposed environment, and describe the encoder and agent architecture. Sec. V and VI present the experimental results, followed by the conclusions and future works.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: agent can perform exceptionally well on graphs with poor initial guesses.
