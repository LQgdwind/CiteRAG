      "content": "Paper Title: Sparse Systolic Tensor Array for Efficient CNN Hardware Acceleration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA simple and effective approach to exploiting random sparsity is to clock-gate (CG) to save power when one or more zero operands are encountered  .\nHowever, CG schemes generally result in low utilization with no area or throughput improvement.\nWe apply this CG for activation sparsity (which is not amenable to DBB). For RNN acceleration, EIE  implements a fine-grained random sparse CSR-encoded INT16 matrix-vector accelerator for dense layers, and ESE  extends this to LSTMs.\nMASR  also exploits random sparsity, but uses a bitmask encoding.\nPermDNN  targets sparse dense layers using permuted diagonal matrices.\nA number of papers target random sparse matrix multiplication for very sparse data, such as\nOuter Space  which uses an outer product scheme, and SpArch , which further optimizes for locality.\nMore specific to the lower sparsity of CNNs, Cnvlutin [ref]5 demonstrates skipping compute for zero activations discovered at runtime, without explicit indexes.\nSCNN  implements a fully CSR-indexed sparse CNN accelerator using an outer product to exploit sparse weights and activations.\nFixyNN [ref]37 demonstrates a fixed-weight accelerator that can very efficiently exploit random sparsity.\nWe focus on CNN structured sparsity, but compare with SCNN and Laconic (Table V). Cambricon-S proposes a conventional block sparse accelerator [ref]40.\nA DBB accelerator described by Kang  implements a fixed weight sparsity of 75%.\nThe accelerator design is also based on a dot product microarchitecture with limited data reuse.\nThe hardware implementation of the Nvidia structured sparsity scheme  are unknown, but is fixed at 2/4242/4 (50%) sparsity.\nFrom our pruning experiments (Table I), 2/8282/8 (75%) is quite aggressive, but 2/4242/4 is probably more universally useful.\nNonetheless, in both cases, the deployed benefit is limited due to the fixed-sparsity ratio.\nIn contrast, our VDBB proposal demonstrates variable-sparsity DBB using time unrolling in a reuse optimized accelerator. Most sparse CNN accelerators are based on dot-product designs reminiscent of DaDianNao , which typically have lower data reuse compared to systolic arrays (SAs) like the Google TPU .\nSMT-SA  is a sparse SA, which foccusses on random sparsity (instead of DBB).\nKung et al.  demonstrated a preprocessing step of column combining of sparse weight matrices, before processing on a dense SA architecture.\nWe implemented an INT8 version of SMT-SA to compare against (Table V), and found that the DBB is much more efficient than the random sparsity of SMT-SA, which requires FIFOs in the array.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: multiplication for very sparse data, such as\nOuter Space  which uses an outer product scheme, and SpArch , which further optimizes for locality.\nMore specific to the lower sparsity of CNNs, Cnvlutin [ref]5 demonstrates skipping compute for zero activations discovered at runtime, without explicit indexes.\nSCNN  implements a fully CSR-indexed sparse CNN accelerator using an outer product to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
