      "content": "Paper Title: Learning a Generic Value-Selection Heuristic Inside a Constraint Programming Solver\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerally speaking, the performance of a reinforcement learning agent is tightly correlated with the definition of an episode. This corresponds to the agent’s interactions with the CP solver’s search procedure and is related to the goal desired for the agent. Two options are discussed in this section, (1) an episode based on depth-first search, introduced by Chalumeau et al. , and (2) an episode based on restarts, which is our first contribution. Building branching heuristics for solving exact combinatorial optimization problems often concurrently targets two objectives: finding quickly good solutions and proving the optimality of a solution. The approach of Chalumeau et al.  relies heavily on the second objective and aims to minimize the number of visited search nodes before proving optimality (e.g., closing the search). To do so, they defined a training episode as a complete solving process carried out by the depth-first search of a solver and penalized through the reward function the generation of each node. This is illustrated in the left picture of Figure 1. However, this approach suffers from an important difficulty. An episode only terminates when the search is completed, which is often intractable for realistic problems as it requires exploring an exponentially large search tree. This is especially problematic during training, where the heuristic is still mediocre. In addition, using a depth-first search algorithm in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework required additional considerations not considered by Chalumeau et al. . For example, using a backtracking algorithm in a regular temporal MDP renders their method prone to the credit assignment problem . These considerations have been pointed out by Scavuzzo et al.  for mixed-integer programming. Unlike this approach, we propose to train the model to find high-quality solutions quickly. To do so, we followed the approach proposed by Cappart et al. : an episode is defined as a single dive in the search tree. No backtrack is allowed; the episode stops when a complete solution is found or a failure is generated. Once the episode is terminated, a restart from the root node is performed, and a new episode is generated, hence the name of restart-based episode. This is illustrated in the right picture of Figure 1. One limitation of Cappart et al.  is that episodes are executed outside the CP solver during the training and cannot use the information updated during propagation for the branching.\nInspired by Song et al.  for variable-selection heuristics, we addressed this limitation by executing each episode inside the solver during the training. Formally, this requires defining the dynamics of the environment as a Markov Decision Process (i.e., a tuple ⟨S,A,T,R⟩𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑅\\langle S,A,T,R\\rangle, see Section 3.1).\nIt is defined as follows. Let 𝒫=⟨X,D​(X),C,O⟩𝒫𝑋𝐷𝑋𝐶𝑂\\mathcal{P}=\\langle X,D(X),C,O\\rangle be the expression of a combinatorial optimization problem (COP), defined by its variables (X𝑋X), the related domains (D𝐷D), its constraints (C𝐶C), and an objective function (O𝑂O). Each state st∈Ssubscript𝑠𝑡𝑆s_{t}\\in S is defined as the pair st=(𝒫t,xt)subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝒫𝑡subscript𝑥𝑡s_{t}=(\\mathcal{P}_{t},x_{t}), where 𝒫tsubscript𝒫𝑡\\mathcal{P}_{t} is a partially solved COP (i.e., some variables may have been assigned), and xt∈Xsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑋x_{t}\\in X is a variable selected for branching, at step t𝑡t of the episode. The initial state s1∈Ssubscript𝑠1𝑆s_{1}\\in S corresponds to the situation after the execution of the fix-point at the root node.\nA terminal node is reached either if all the variables are assigned (∀x∈X:|Dt​(x)|=1:for-all𝑥𝑋subscript𝐷𝑡𝑥1\\forall x\\in X:|D_{t}(x)|=1), or if a\nfailure is detected (∃x∈X:|Dt​(x)|=0:𝑥𝑋subscript𝐷𝑡𝑥0\\exists x\\in X:|D_{t}(x)|=0). The variable selected for branching is obtained through a standard heuristic such as first-fail. Given a state st=(𝒫t,xt)subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝒫𝑡subscript𝑥𝑡s_{t}=(\\mathcal{P}_{t},x_{t}), an action atsubscript𝑎𝑡a_{t} corresponds to the selection of a value v∈D​(xt)𝑣𝐷subscript𝑥𝑡v\\in D(x_{t}) for branching at step t𝑡t.\nFinding the most promising value to branch on is the problem addressed in this paper. Given a state st=(𝒫t,xt)subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝒫𝑡subscript𝑥𝑡s_{t}=(\\mathcal{P}_{t},x_{t}) and an action at=vsubscript𝑎𝑡𝑣a_{t}=v, the transition function executes three successive operations. First, it assigns the value v𝑣v to the variable x𝑥x (i.e., D​(xt+1)=v𝐷subscript𝑥𝑡1𝑣D(x_{t+1})=v). Second, it executes the fix-point on 𝒫tsubscript𝒫𝑡\\mathcal{P}_{t} in order to prune the domains (i.e., 𝒫t+1=𝖿𝗂𝗑𝖯𝗈𝗂𝗇𝗍​(Pt)subscript𝒫𝑡1𝖿𝗂𝗑𝖯𝗈𝗂𝗇𝗍subscript𝑃𝑡\\mathcal{P}_{t+1}=\\mathsf{fixPoint}(P_{t})).\nThird, it selects the next variable to branch on (i.e., xt+1=𝗇𝖾𝗑𝗍𝖵𝖺𝗋𝗂𝖺𝖻𝗅𝖾​(Pt+1)subscript𝑥𝑡1𝗇𝖾𝗑𝗍𝖵𝖺𝗋𝗂𝖺𝖻𝗅𝖾subscript𝑃𝑡1x_{t+1}=\\mathsf{nextVariable}(P_{t+1})). This results\nin a new state st+1=(𝒫t+1,xt+1)subscript𝑠𝑡1subscript𝒫𝑡1subscript𝑥𝑡1s_{t+1}=(\\mathcal{P}_{t+1},x_{t+1}).\nIntegrating the propagation inside the transition is one important difference with Cappart et al. . The function is defined separately in Section 4.2. Concerning the training, we opted for a double deep Q-learning algorithm [ref]49, known to perform well for discrete action spaces. However, other RL algorithms could also be used.\nWe compared our restart-based training procedure using a simple terminal reward based on the solution’s score with the backtracking-based approach of Chalumeau et al.  using their reward at each step (penalty of 111 for each explored node). We selected the maximum independent set problem for this comparison with instances with 50 nodes. Results are presented using performance profiles  in Figure 2. A detailed explanation of the experimental protocol is proposed in Section 5. We evaluated both methods on two metrics matching the objective for which they were specifically trained. We look at the value of the solution obtained after a single dive (Figure 2(a)) in the tree search and the number of nodes visited to prove optimality using a depth-first search (Figure 2(b)). As expected, we observe that the agent trained with the restart-based learning strategy allows good results regarding the optimality gap for the first solution found after a single dive. Remarkably, our method yields a comparable ability to prove optimality compared to Chalumeau et al. , whose primary aim was specifically to solve the problem in the minimum number of nodes. This last result has to be mitigated as both RL-based methods lie in the range of the random strategy\n(shaded blue area). Finally, as shown in Figure 2(a), it is important to notice that the optimality gap returned by our method is still non-negligible at the first solution obtained. The complexity of a combinatorial problem lies mainly in closing this gap, which is why backtracking is required. Experiments with backtracking are proposed in Section 5.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: inside the transition is one important difference with Cappart et al. .
