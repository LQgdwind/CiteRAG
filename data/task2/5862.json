      "content": "Paper Title: Pitchclass2vec: Symbolic Music Structure Segmentation with Chord Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section shows how the proposed model compares to FORM , the state-of-the-art approach in the field of music segmentation.\nWe develop a baseline model using a stacked LSTM-based neural network, depicted in figure 4.\nThe model objective is to predict in which section each chord belongs to. We train our model on the Billboard dataset provided by mirdata.\nThe dataset is composed of 889889889 expert annotated tracks. Each track is composed of a sequence of chords in Harte format, and a sequence of structure labels.\nLabels are provided in a similar format to the one presented by SALAMI[ref]42. 808080 unique section labels are present in the whole dataset. We preprocess each label and reduce the number of unique labels to 111111 by combining all those labels that fall under the same definition given by[ref]42.\nA complete reference of the label conversion step is given in table 1. Although in literature there are neural network architectures that have proven to perform better in similar task [ref]43  , we deliberately decided to use a very straightforward architecture.\nThis is due to the fact that the aim of this study is to compare different types of embedding, rather than to achieve the best performance. We split our dataset in the usual training, validation and test split (respectively 800800800, 178178178 and 898989 elements) and fine-tune each model hyper-parameters (number of LSTM stacked layers, LSTM hidden size, dropout probability) to obtain the best results on the validation set. The final configuration of each model is summarised in Table 2. Training is performed using an NVIDIA RTX 3090 with a batch size of 128128128. Each model takes at most few minutes to train and average less than 222 milion parameters. We compare the proposed embedding model to fasttext and word2vec as well, in which both methods are trained on the string labels of chords in Harte format. Both the models are trained using the highly optimized gensim  implementation. The hyperparameters used are the same as the one described in section 3.1 except for the embedding dimension, which is set to 300300300.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: expert annotated tracks.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
