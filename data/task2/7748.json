[ref]34, who proposed to compute a convex blending of both discretization operators. This approach has also been demonstrated to yield a sensible turbulence model if tuned correctly¬†.\nWithin each element both the high-order DG operator ùì°DG‚Äã(ùëº^)superscriptùì°DG^ùëº\\bm{\\mathcal{R}}^{\\text{DG}}(\\hat{\\bm{U}}) and the compatible low-order FV scheme ùì°FV‚Äã(ùëº^)superscriptùì°FV^ùëº\\bm{\\mathcal{R}}^{\\text{FV}}(\\hat{\\bm{U}}) are evaluated.\nThe convex blending of both schemes then yields where the blending factor Œ±‚àà ùõº01\\alpha\\in  can be computed either via an a priori or a posteriori strategy for each individual DG element¬†.\nIn this work, the a priori indicator by Hennemann et¬†al. [ref]34 is used, for which the blending approach becomes an operator local to each individual element.\nClearly, the standard DG scheme can be recovered for Œ±=0ùõº0\\alpha=0, while Œ±=1ùõº1\\alpha=1 yields a pure FV discretization.\nIt is important to stress that only the contributions of the operators within the element have to be blended since the outer surface fluxes are identical for the DG and FV formulation.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: smooth regions while identifying and handling so-called troubled cells within the domain during the simulation.\nCommon approaches introduce some form of artificial viscosity near the shock region¬†  [ref]30 or use high-order filtering techniques¬†.\nAnother approach is to employ a hybrid discretization, where the high-order DG scheme is stabilized in the vicinity of the troubled region with a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
