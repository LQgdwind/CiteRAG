      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial Robustness Assessment of NeuroEvolution Approaches\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe design of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is a time-consuming trial-and-error process that requires domain expertise. The design choices affect one another and this interdependence must be considered when dealing with increasingly complex models which often reach thousands or millions of parameters. To alleviate these issues, NeuroEvolution (NE) uses evolutionary approaches to automate the search for better topologies and parametrization of ANNs. Models designed through NE achieve competitive results in comparison with manually-designed ANNs, sometimes even surpassing their performance¬†[ref]1 [ref]2 [ref]3  .\nThus, it is reasonable to consider that these models can be applied in real-world scenarios.\nHowever, their adoption in such cases means that concerns other than predictive performance must be addressed.\nIn the particular case of security-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles or malware detectors, one of such concerns is the models‚Äô vulnerability to adversarial examples¬† .\nThese malicious examples are usually crafted by adding small perturbations to the original inputs causing the attacked model to produce an incorrect output¬† . Restrictions are often imposed on the maximum perturbation that can be added so as to try to keep the adversarial example and the original input indistinguishable¬† .\nIn the image domain, the perturbations are often bounded by some LpsubscriptùêøùëùL_{p}-norm¬† .\nANNs designed by humans have been widely studied and are known to be vulnerable to these attacks, but it is still unclear the extent to which ANNs obtained through the application of NE suffer from this vulnerability. Our goal is to empirically evaluate the resistance of ANNs designed by NE to adversarial examples, with a focus on image classification tasks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).\nWe consider threat models where the attacker‚Äôs goal is simply to cause a misclassification of a given instance, i.e., we perform untargeted attacks, and has full access to the models, i.e., we perform white-box attacks.\nSimilar to previous work in adversarial machine learning, we consider L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} and L‚àûsubscriptùêøL_{\\infty}-bounded perturbations¬†, and white-box attacks that maximize the loss function while constraining the perturbations to a pre-defined budget under each distance metric. Our analysis is performed by attacking pre-trained models for the CIFAR-10 dataset¬†, made publicly available by the authors of the corresponding NE approaches.\nWe consider DENSER¬†[ref]1 and two variants of NSGA-Net models¬†[ref]3, all of which achieving an accuracy above 93% on clean images.\nThese models, and their training, do not incorporate any defense mechanism against adversarial examples.\nThus, any robustness that is shown can be likely attributed to architectural aspects of the ANNs.\nMoreover, the NE approaches only seek to maximize predictive performance, while directly or indirectly minimizing computational complexity. Our results show that these evolved models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, similar to hand-designed ANNs. Using iterative methods, like the basic iterative method (BIM)¬† and the projected gradient descent (PGD) attack¬†, their accuracy drops dramatically, to values below 0.25% under both distance metrics.\nDENSER deviates from this behavior and shows some resistance to L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} perturbations, keeping its accuracy at 21.76% under a BIM attack with 100 iterations. When reducing the iterations to 50 but incorporating 10 random restarts, the accuracy falls further to 18.10%.\nOn the other hand, the models that use the architectures found by NSGA-Net, especially when applied to the NASNet search space, are more robust to the single-step attacks of our experiments.\nWe could also identify distinct patterns in the misclassifications produced by the models, even under the same attack and when the accuracy of all of them is zero. For instance, some misclassify the adversarial examples of a class into a small subset of classes, while the misclassifications of other models are much more spread out. Furthermore, we warn about the choice of data pre-processing procedures and the effect of such transformations on the perturbations added to the clean inputs. Certain techniques can exacerbate these perturbations before the data reaches the first layer of the network, which in a way makes it easier for the attacker to succeed in generating an adversarial example under a certain perturbation budget. For this reason, it might be worth including this component in the search process of NE approaches. Moreover, all training conditions, including any model-specific pre-processing step, should be clearly specified when evaluating adversarial robustness, especially when comparing models from different sources. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section¬†II provides an overview of NE approaches and adversarial machine learning, and presents relevant work on the intersection of the two fields. Section¬†III describes our experimental setup in terms of datasets, models, adversarial attacks, and evaluation metrics. Section¬†IV presents the results of the experimental campaign and discusses our main findings. Section¬†V concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: for better topologies and parametrization of ANNs.
