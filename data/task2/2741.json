      "content": "Paper Title: Algorithmic Information Design in Multi-Player Games: Possibility and Limits in Singleton Congestion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn today’s digital economy, there are numerous situations where many players have to compete for limited resources. For instance, on ride-hailing platforms such as Uber and Lyft, drivers pick an area to go and then compete with other drivers for riding requests at that area; on content platforms such as Youtube and Tiktok, content providers choose a style/theme for their contents and then compete with other providers of the same theme for Internet traffic interested in that theme; on digital markets such as Amazon and Wayfair, retailers choose a particular product category (e.g., pet supplies or home&kitchen, etc.) to focus on and compete with other retailers for sale demands on that category. All these problems share the following similarity: (1) many players make a choice (e.g., a ride-sharing area or a content theme) from multiple options and their payoffs has negative externalities with other players of the same choice due to competition; (2) players have high uncertainty about the payoffs of their choices since the entire system’s demand of riding requests or Internet traffic are unknown to an individual player, whereas the system usually has much fined-grained information about these uncertainties. An important operational task common in all these applications is the following: how can the system\n(the sender) strategically reveal her privileged information to influence the decisions of so many players (the receivers) in order to steer their collective decisions towards a desirable social outcome? This task, also known as information design or persuasion   1 , has attracted extensive recent interests. Besides the aforementioned problems, it has found application in many other domains including auctions   , recommender systems   , robot planning , traffic congestion control  , security   , and recently reinforcement learning . Similar to mechanism design, information design is also an optimization question subject to incentive constraints. Thus unsurprisingly, it has attracted much algorithmic studies, particularly in the challenging situation of multi-receiver persuasion . Much algorithmic investigation has been devoted to the special case with no inter-agent externalities [ref]6  [ref]60  , i.e., a receiver’s utility is not affected by other receivers’ actions. This restriction is certainly not ideal, but does come with a reason. Indeed, even in such case with no externalities, the optimal information design is already notoriously intractable. Specifically, it was shown to be NP-hard to obtain any constant approximation if the sender sends a public signal to all receivers, a.k.a., public signaling  [ref]60. This hardness holds even when each receiver only has a binary action from {0,1}01\\{0,1\\} and when the sender simply wants to maximize the number of receivers taking action 111 . While public signaling may sometimes be desirable due to concerns of unfairness and discrimination or due to communication restrictions  , there are also situations in which the sender may send different signals to different receivers separably, i.e., private signaling. This turns out to be more tractable: optimal private signaling admits polynomial time algorithm so long as the sender’s objective function can be efficiently maximized   but becomes NP-hard otherwise [ref]6. Given the aforementioned hardness for the no externality situation, it is less surprising that optimal information design has received much less attention in strategic games with externalities. Studies of information design in games have so far mostly focused on public signaling in restricted classes of games such as zero-sum games studied by Dughmi , non-atomic congestion games with linear latency functions studied by Bhaskar et al.  and second-price auctions studied by Emek et al. . Unfortunately, these works all exhibit sweeping intractability results. An interesting exception is the very recent work by Griesbach et al. , which develops polynomial-time optimal public signaling schemes for multi-commodity non-atomic congestion games in the situation with parallel links, constant number of states and affine latency functions. On the other hand, the study of private signaling in general games have received significantly less attention. As part of their learning algorithm, Mansour et al.  give a linear program (LP) for computing the optimal private scheme. However, the size of their LP is exponential in the number of receivers. Overcoming this exponential dependence on the number of agents is an intrinsic challenge in the design of optimal private signaling scheme (see more discussions below). This paper initiates a systematic algorithmic investigation of both public and private signaling in succinctly representable multiplayer games and focus on a basic class of strategic games, i.e., the atomic singleton congestion games (SCGs). We adopt the perspective of a social planner who looks to use information design to minimize the total social cost, a widely studied global objective in congestion games. Congestion games succinctly capture negative externalities among agents. The SCG is an important special case of congestion games where each player’s action is a singleton set of the resources, i.e., a single resource. While the game class of SCG may appear “narrow” at the first glance, it is a very fundamental and widely-studied class of games — it has been the sole subject in many previous papers, including the arguably influential work by Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou  which introduced the concept of the price of anarchy as well as its notable follow-up work by Czumaj and Vöcking . Therefore, we believe a thorough study of this basic class of games is an important step towards understanding the algorithmics of optimal information design in truly strategic setups. Moreover, in addition to the wide application of SCG mentioned at the beginning of this section, it also finds application in other domains such as traffic routing , job scheduling  , firm competition  and communication over networks  . Besides its wide applicability, there are also multiple more basic reasons that SCGs are an ideal game class for the study of optimal information design for succinctly represented multiplayer games. First, it is a fundamental class of games, which as we show already exhibits quite non-trivial computational challenges. Therefore, a thorough algorithmic understanding for this elemental class is essential for the study of information design in more complex setups. Second, a celebrated work by Ieong et al.  shows that various types of Nash equilibria (NEs), including both the socially-optimal NE and the potential-function-minimizing NE, can be computed efficiently in SCGs with arbitrary cost functions, whereas Fabrikant et al. 5 prove that computing a pure Nash equilibrium becomes PLS-complete in general congestion games. Therefore, the restriction to SCGs allows us to “disentangle” the complexity study of information design from the complexity of computing the equilibrium. Third, information design in such class of strategic games with many players gives rise to several fundamental new challenges that has not been present in previous work and thus requires the introduction of novel concepts and techniques which we now elaborate. Finally, recent study by Nachbar and Xu  shows that the welfare improvement via information design can never exceed the price of anarchy of the underlying base games. For example, in non-atomic routing with linear latency, the maximum possible social cost reduction by using any signaling scheme is at most 1/3=4/3−1134311/3=4/3-1 fraction of the social optimum, since the price of anarchy of the games is at most 4/3434/3 . Therefore, information design would be more useful in games with large price of anarchy, which is true for the general SCG games we consider. The following simple example illustrates public and private signaling in SCGs and how it may significantly reduce social cost.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: algorithmic studies, particularly in the challenging situation of multi-receiver persuasion .
