[ref]9 conducted an MLR to identify software engineering design patterns in the field of machine learning, which was published in 2022.\nThey identified 15 design patterns for this kind of application, and additionally analyzed their perception and usage via a survey with 118 ML practitioners.\nTheir only used search engine for white literature was Engineering Village111https://www.engineeringvillage.com, which provides access to 12 engineering databases.\nTheir gray literature search was performed using the Google search engine.\nTo find relevant resources within a broader definition of design patterns, they also included keywords such as “implementation pattern” and “architecture pattern”.\nTheir queries produced 80 resources, from which they included 38 resources after analysis.\nFrom these, they extracted 33 patterns, but reduced the number to 15 after additional quality checks.\nThey classified the patterns into three different categories (topology, programming, and model operation) and assigned nine quality attributes.\nAmong these are five system and software product quality attributes, namely performance efficiency, compatibility, security, maintainability, and portability, as well as four model and prediction quality attributes: model robustness, model explainability, prediction accuracy, and prediction fairness.\nLastly, the authors mention a lack of well-described patterns and missing standardization. Since design patterns for ML systems is an active research topic, Washizaki et al. [ref]9 suggested conducting a comparable study again in the future to get an up-to-date list of design patterns.\nThe literature search in [ref]9 was conducted in August 2019.\nThe main reason to apply design patterns is to quickly find solutions to recurring problems so that a designer can spend more time on thinking about creative solutions to problems not yet covered by patterns .\nIn a field where many organizations have issues with creating production-ready AI-based systems, having no knowledge of and no convenient overview of the pattern landscape can negatively impact many quality attributes.\nSo far, AI-related design patterns were mainly published in books or blog posts   , with only a few scientific papers [ref]9 .\nThis means there is no comprehensive collection of design patterns which is also easy to browse.\nOur study aims to fill this gap by providing an up-to-date collection of design patterns for AI-based systems and an easily usable pattern repository.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: conducted for general design patterns  or patterns in other domains like microservices  or IoT , there is only one study that collects design patterns for AI-based systems.\nIn 2019, Washizaki et al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
