      "content": "Paper Title: Auxiliary Learning for Self-Supervised Video Representation via Similarity-based Knowledge Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBackbone Networks – We choose two different backbones R(2+1)D [ref]38 and R3D-18 [ref]10, as our 3D encoder, which have been widely used in recent SotA self-supervised video representation learning methods 8  . Default Settings – We run all experiments under PyTorch on two GeForce RTX 2080Ti GPUs with a batch size of 30. We use SGD as our optimizer with momentum of 0.9 and weight decay of 5e-4. Pretraining Stages – Following , for both auxiliary and primary stages, we pretrain our models for 20 epochs with an initial learning rate of 1×10−31superscript1031\\times 10^{-3}. The learning rate is decreased by 1/10\nevery 6 epochs. For data augmentation, we randomly crop the video clip to 112 × 112 and then apply horizontal flip and color jittering to each video frame. Following , for UCF101 we apply (10x more iterations at) 90K iterations per epoch for temporal jittering.\nIn our auxiliary pretraining stage, we use a predictor head for the student encoder comprising a 3-layer MLP with hidden dimension 1024, and output embedding dimension 128. We do not use a predictor for the teacher and only set its output dimension (projection head) to 128. We follow MoCo 8 and set the size of the memory bank to 16384 and set the momentum value of the encoder update to 0.999. We also use the same temperature for both teacher and student model at 0.02.\nTo use the student encoder for the primary stage, the weights of the convolutional layers are retained after auxiliary pretraining and we drop the projection layer and predictor to replace them with two randomly initialized FC layers corresponding to the segment speed and index outcomes of our VSPP pretext task (see Figure 2). We select our parameters empirically. Fine-tuning – During fine-tuning, we transfer the weights of the convolutional layers to the human action recognition downstream task, while the last FC layer is randomly initialized.\nWe fine-tune the network on UCF101 and HMDB51 for 25 epoches with labelled videos and apply cross-entropy loss. We use the same data augmentation and training strategy as the pretraining stage except for the initial learning rate which is set to 3×10−33superscript1033\\times 10^{-3}, similar to . Evaluation Settings – We follow the common evaluation protocols on video representation learning   to assess the performance of our proposed approach. For action recognition, we sample 10 clips uniformly from each video in the test sets of UCF-101 and HMDB-51. Then for each clip, we only simply apply the center-crop. To find the final prediction, we average the Softmax probabilities of all 10 clips from the video.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: Backbone Networks – We choose two different backbones R(2+1)D [ref]38 and R3D-18 [ref]10, as our 3D encoder, which have been widely used in recent SotA self-supervised video representation learning methods 8  .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
