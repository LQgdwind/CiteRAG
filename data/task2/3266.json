      "content": "Paper Title: Symptoms of Architecture Erosion in Code Reviews: A Study of Two OpenStack Projects\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlong evolution, software systems tend to exhibit a (growing) gap between the intended and the implemented architecture. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as architecture erosion [ref]1 and is often described using diverse terms (e.g., architectural decay and degradation) . Architecture erosion has a negative impact on the maintenance and evolution of a software system, by causing architectural inconsistencies (e.g., defective interfaces that hinder interaction with outside components) and degradation of software quality (e.g., components that are highly resistant to change) . However, architecture erosion is typically considered rather late in the process, and especially after it has severely impacted the system ; this makes it hard or sometimes even impossible to handle erosion. Therefore, it is wise to detect and repair architectural erosion as early as possible. One way to achieve that is by looking for symptoms of erosion in the early phases. Researchers have identified a number of architecture erosion symptoms, which indicate the presence of the aforementioned gap between intended and implemented architecture (see Section II-B).\nSuch symptoms include common violations of design decisions and principles (e.g., violations of inter-module communication rules in a layered architecture ) and structural issues (e.g., architectural smells , , , rigidity and brittleness of systems , ). The occurrence of such symptoms can act as early warnings for software engineers to tackle architecture erosion (e.g., by refactoring) , . Previous studies have investigated approaches, mostly using static source code analysis , , for identifying erosion symptoms , , , .\nHowever, existing code analysis tools may not be sufficient to accurately identify the wide range of erosion symptoms , . For instance, existing tools (e.g., Sonargraph, Arcan) cannot identify certain types of architectural smells (e.g., ambiguous interface, multipath dependency) . Moreover, several architectural smells manifest at levels that are out of scope of existing techniques and tools, such as package-level and service-level (including microservices) smells . While certain erosion symptoms are hard to detect using source code analysis tools, there are other sources that could be tapped for this purpose, such as code reviews.\nCode review is a widely used practice to manually find defects in code and improve code quality . Besides, code reviews can improve the quality attributes of the software  and also result in improvements at the architecture level .\nIdentifying erosion symptoms from code reviews can be complementary to using source code analysis tools; this would enhance the accuracy of detecting erosion symptoms.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this data source for detecting erosion symptoms has not been investigated before. In fact, little is known about whether erosion symptoms are widely discussed (if at all) during code reviews and how developers deal with them.\n In this study we aim at empirically investigating architecture erosion symptoms that are discussed during the code review process, as well as their evolution trend, and the actions taken by developers on dealing with the erosion symptoms.\nIdentifying erosion symptoms through code review could support detecting architecture erosion early in software systems, that would otherwise not be captured by static analysis of source code. Regarding the scope, we focus on violation and structural symptoms of architecture erosion (see Section II-B), as these two types are the most frequently discussed in the literature according to our recent study  (see Section VIII-B). To achieve our goal, we manually identified 502 code review comments (contained in 472 discussion threads) related to the symptoms of architecture erosion. The key contributions of this work are summarized as follows: We constructed a benchmark dataset containing violation and structural symptoms of architecture erosion for further use by researchers (see the replication package ). We manually identified the most frequently discussed architecture erosion symptoms from code reviews and provided a taxonomy of the erosion symptoms. We further analyzed the trends of the erosion symptoms and the actions taken by developers in dealing with the symptoms. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the background of this work. Section III elaborates on the research questions and the study design. Section IV presents the results, which are subsequently discussed in Section V. Section VI details the implications of the study results for researchers and practitioners and Section VII discusses the threats to the validity of the study. Section VIII introduces related work and Section IX concludes with future directions.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Along evolution, software systems tend to exhibit a (growing) gap between the intended and the implemented architecture.
