      "content": "Paper Title: \\method: A Scalable Path-based Reasoning Approach for Knowledge Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPath-based methods use paths between entities for knowledge graph reasoning. Early methods like Path Ranking [ref]28  collect relational paths as symbolic features for classification. Path-RNN  [ref]15 and PathCon [ref]45 improve Path Ranking by learning the representations of paths with recurrent neural networks (RNN). However, these works operate on the full set of paths between two entities, which grows exponentially w.r.t. the path length. Typically, these methods can only be applied to paths with at most 3 edges. To avoid the exhaustive search of paths, many methods learn to sample important paths for reasoning. DeepPath  and MINERVA  learn an agent to collect meaningful paths on the knowledge graph through reinforcement learning. These methods are hard to train due to the extremely sparse rewards. Later works improve them by engineering the reward function  or the search strategy , using multiple agents for positive and negative paths  or for coarse- and fine-grained paths .  and  use a variational formulation to learn a sparse prior for path sampling. Another category of methods utilizes the dynamic programming to search paths in a polynomial time. NeuralLP  and DRUM  use dynamic programming to learn linear combination of logic rules. All-Paths  adopts a Floyd-Warshall-like algorithm to learn path representations between all pairs of entities. Recently, NBFNet  and RED-GNN  leverage a Bellman-Ford-like algorithm to learn path representations from a single-source entity to all entities. While dynamic programming methods achieve state-of-the-art results among path-based methods, they need to perform message passing on the full knowledge graph. By comparison, our \\methodlearns a priority function and only explores a subset of paths, which is more scalable than existing dynamic programming methods.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: Path-based methods use paths between entities for knowledge graph reasoning.
