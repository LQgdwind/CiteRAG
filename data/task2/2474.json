      "content": "Paper Title: Nearest Neighborhood-Based Deep Clustering for Source Data-absent Unsupervised Domain Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBeing a branch of transfer learning [ref]1, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) [ref]2 intends to perform an accurate classification on the unlabeled test set given a labeled train set.\nIn UDA, we specialize the train and test sets with different probability distributions as the source domain and target domain, respectively.\nDuring the transfer (training) process, we assume the labeled source data is to be accessible in the problem setting of UDA. The key to solving UDA is to reduce the domain drift. Because of data available from both domains, the existing methods mainly convert UDA to probability distribution matching problems, i.e., domain alignment, where the domain data represent the corresponding domain’s probability distribution.\nHowever, access to the source data is becoming extremely difficult.\nFirst, as the evolution of algorithms begins to wane, the performance improvements primarily rely on the increase of large-scale labeled data with high quality.\nIt is hard to obtain data, deemed as a vital asset, at a low cost. Companies or organizations may release learned models but cannot provide their customer data due to data privacy and security regulations.\nSecond, in many application scenarios, the source datasets (e.g., videos or high-resolution images) are becoming very large. It will often be impractical to transfer or retrain them to different platforms. Therefore, the so-called source data-absent UDA (SAUDA) problem considers the scenario where only a source model pre-trained on the source domain and the unlabeled target data are available for the transfer (training) phase. Namely, we can only use the source data for the source model training.\nAs most UDA methods cannot support this tough task due to their dependence on source data to perform distribution matching, this challenging topic has recently attracted a lot of research  [ref]4   . Due to its independence from given supervision information, self-supervised learning becomes a central concept for solving unsupervised learning problems.\nAs an important self-supervised scheme, deep clustering has made progress in many unsupervised scenarios. For example,  developed an end-to-end general method with pseudo-labels from self-labelling for unsupervised learning of visual features.\nVery recently,  extended the work proposed in  to SAUDA, following the hypothesis transfer framework .\nEssentially, these methods equivalently implement a deep clustering built on individual data, as shown in Fig. 1(a).\nAlthough achieving excellent results, this individual-based clustering process is susceptible to external factors, such as pseudo-label errors.\nAs a result, some samples move towards a wrong cluster (see the middle and the right subfigure in Fig. 1(a)). Holding the perspective of robust clustering, in this paper, we intend to mine a correlation (constraint) from the local geometry of data for more robust clustering.\nIf we take the nearest neighborhood (NNH) of individual data as the fundamental unit, the clustering may group more robustly.\nAs shown in the middle\nsubfigure of Fig. 1(b), the black circle (misclassified sample) moves to the wrong cluster.\nHowever, the gray oval (the nearest neighborhood) may move to the correct cluster with the help of an adjustment from the blue circle (the nearest neighbor that is correctly classified).\nMaintaining this trend, the gray oval, including the black circle (misclassified sample), can eventually cross the classification plane and reach the correct cluster. Inspired by the idea above, this paper proposes a new deep clustering-based SAUDA method.\nThe key of our method is to encourage NNH geometry, i.e., the gray oval in Fig. 1(b), to move correctly instead of moving the individual data.\nWe achieve this goal in two ways.\nFirstly, we propose a new constraint on the local geometry, named semantic consistency on nearest neighborhood (SCNNH). A law of cognition inspires it: the most similar objects are likely to belong to the same category, discovered by research on infant self-learning .\nSecondly, based on the backbone in  , we propose a novel framework to implement the clustering on NNH.\nSpecifically, besides integrating a geometry constructor to build NNH for all data, we generate the pseudo-labels based on a semantic fusion on NNH. Also, we give a new SCNNH-based regularization to regulate the self-training. Moreover, we give an advanced version of our method. This method proposes a new, more SCNNH-compliant implementation of NNH, named semantic hyper-nearest neighborhood (SHNNH), and extends the proposed adaptation framework to this geometry.\nThe contributions of this paper cover the following three areas. We exploit a new way to solve SAUDA.\nWe introduce the semantic constraint hidden in the local geometry of individual data, i.e., NNH, to\nencourage robust clustering on the target domain. Correspondingly, we propose a new semantic constraint upon NNH, i.e., SCNNH. Based on the SCNNH constraint, we propose a new deep clustering-based adaptation method\nbuilding on NNH instead of individual data.\nMoreover, we extend our method to a newly designed geometry, i.e., SHNNH, which expresses SCNNH more reasonably. Different from the construction strategy only based on spatial information, we additionally introduce semantic credibility constraints in the new structure. We perform extensive experiments on three challenging datasets. The results of the experiment indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both developed geometries. Also, except for the ablation study to explore the effect of the components in our method, a careful investigation is conducted in the analysis part. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\nSection II introduces the related work, followed by the preliminary work as Section III.\nSection IV details the proposed method, while Section V extends our approach to a semantic credibility-based NNH.\nSection VI gives the experimental results and related analyses.\nIn the end, we present the conclusion in Section VII.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Being a branch of transfer learning [ref]1, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) [ref]2 intends to perform an accurate classification on the unlabeled test set given a labeled train set.\nIn UDA, we specialize the train and test sets\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
