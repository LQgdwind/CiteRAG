      "content": "Paper Title: SAMBA: Safe Model-Based & Active Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement learning (RL) has seen successes in domains such as video and board games   9, and control of simulated robots  2 3. Though successful, these applications assume idealised simulators and require tens of millions of agent-environment interactions typically performed by randomly exploring policies. In real-world safety-critical applications, however, such an idealised framework of random exploration with the ability to gather samples at ease falls short, partly due to the catastrophic costs of failure and the high operating costs. Hence, if RL algorithms are to be applied in the real world, safe agents that are sample-efficient and capable of mitigating risk need to be developed. To this end, different works adopt varying safety definitions, where some are interested in safe learning, i.e., safety during the learning process, while others focus on acquiring safe policies eventually. Safe learning generally requires some form of safe initial policy as well as regularity assumptions on dynamics, all of which depend on which notion of safety is considered. For instance, safety defined by constraining trajectories to safe regions of the state-action space is studied in, e.g., , which assumes partially-known control-affine dynamics with Lipschitz regularity conditions, as well as in  [ref]5, both of which require strong assumptions on dynamics and initial control policies to give theoretical guarantees of safety. Safety in terms of Lyapunov stability [ref]31 is studied in, e.g.,   (model-free), which require a safe initial policy, and  (model-based), which requires Lipschitz dynamics and a safe initial policy. The work in  (which builds on ) considers deterministic dynamics and attempts to optimise expected return while not violating a pre-specified safety threshold. Several papers attempt to keep expectation constraints satisfied during learning, e.g.,  extends ideas of 9, 6 adds a safety layer which makes action corrections to maintain safety. When it comes to safe final policies (defined in terms of corresponding constraints), on the other hand, some works 1  considered risk-based constraints and developed model-free solvers. Unfortunately, most of these methods are sample-inefficient and make a large number of visits to unsafe regions. Given our interest in algorithms achieving safe final policies while reducing the number of visits to unsafe regions,\nwe pursue a safe model-based framework that assumes no safe initial policies nor a priori knowledge of the transition model. As we believe that sample efficiency is key for effective safe solvers, we choose Gaussian processes  for our model. Of course, any such framework is hampered by the quality and assumptions of the model’s hypothesis space. Aiming at alleviating these restrictions, we go further and integrate active learning (discussed in Section 2.2), wherein the agent influences where to query/sample from in order to generate new data so as to reduce model uncertainty, and so ultimately to learn more efficiently. Successful application of this approach is very much predicated upon the chosen method of quantifying potential uncertainty reduction, i.e., what we refer to as the (semi-)active metric. Common (semi-)active metrics are those which identify points in the model with large entropy or large variance, or where those quantities would be most reduced in a posterior model if the given point were added to the data set   0 6. However, our desire for safety adds a complication, since a safe learning algorithm will likely have greater uncertainty in regions where it is unsafe by virtue of not exploring those regions 9 . Indeed our experiments (Figure 1) support this claim. Attacking the above challenges, we propose two novel out-of-sample (semi-)metrics for Gaussian processes that allow for exploration in novel areas while remaining close to training data, thus avoiding unsafe regions. To enable effective and grounded introduction of active exploration and safety constraints, we define a novel constrained bi-objective formulation of RL and provide a policy multi-gradient solver that is proven effective on a variety of safety benchmarks. In short, our contributions can be stated as follows: 1) novel constrained bi-objective formulation enabling exploration and safety consideration, 2) safety-aware active (semi-)metrics for exploration, and 3) policy multi-gradient solver trading off cost minimisation, exploration maximisation, and constraint feasibility. We test our algorithm on three stochastic dynamical systems after augmenting these with safety regions and demonstrate a significant reduction in sample and cost complexities compared to the state-of-the-art.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: constraining trajectories to safe regions of the state-action space is studied in, e.g., , which assumes partially-known control-affine dynamics with Lipschitz regularity conditions, as well as in  [ref]5, both of which require strong assumptions on dynamics and initial control policies to give theoretical guarantees of safety.
