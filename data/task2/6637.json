      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Select SAT Encodings for Pseudo-Boolean and Linear Integer Constraints\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent work, new or improved SAT encodings of linear\nconstraints  and pseudo-Boolean constraints (combined\nwith AMO constraints) [ref]2  have been devised and\ntheir performance compared on several benchmark problems. The scaling properties\nof encodings are studied, and it is suggested that smaller encodings should be\nused when coefficients or values of integer variables are large. However, to\nthe best of our knowledge the problem of selecting an encoding (particularly for\na previously-unseen problem class) has not been systematically addressed for LI\nor PB constraints. We use the full set of encodings from one recent\npaper  combined with automatic AMO\ndetection . MeSAT  and Proteus  both\nselect SAT encodings using machine learning. MeSAT has two encodings of LI\nconstraints: the order encoding ; and an encoding\nbased on enumeration of allowed tuples of values (which uses a direct encoding\nof the CSP variables). It is not clear whether high-arity sums are broken up\nbefore encoding. MeSAT selects from three configurations using a k-nearest\nneighbour classifier using 70 CSP instance features. They report high accuracy\n(within 4% of the virtual best configuration), however the single best\nconfiguration is only 18% slower than the virtual best. Proteus makes a\nsequence of decisions: whether to use CSP or SAT; the SAT encoding; and the SAT\nsolver to use. The portfolio contains three SAT encodings: direct, support, and\na hybrid direct-order, however the encoding of LI constraints is not\nspecified . Proteus generates each candidate SAT\nencoding and extracts features of the SAT formula to inform its selection –\nscaling this approach would be difficult when several constraint types are\ninvolved, each with many encoding choices. Results show that the choice of\nencoding (combined with the choice of SAT solver) is important and that machine\nlearning methods can be effective in their context. Soh et al 5 have proposed a hybrid encoding of CSP to SAT in\nwhich each variable may have the log or order encoding (but not both). A\nhand-crafted heuristic is used to automatically select one of the two encodings\nfor each variable. A new encoding is defined for linear inequalities that\ncontain a mix of log and order encoded integer variables. The hybrid encoding\nis shown to outperform both log and order encodings, demonstrating the potential\nof selecting encodings for individual variables or constraints rather than for\nan instance. Log encodings have been shown to give good performance, with the\nPicat-SAT solver  placing highly in recent CP challenges – Picat-SAT uses a log\nencoding for integer variables. Our set of encodings includes two that use\nlog arithmetic internally (GGPW and GMTO), however none\nemploy a log encoding of integer variables. Appendix A contains\na brief comparison to Picat-SAT using selected instances with large domains\nfrom our benchmark set.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: In recent work, new or improved SAT encodings of linear\nconstraints  and pseudo-Boolean constraints (combined\nwith AMO constraints) [ref]2  have been devised and\ntheir performance compared on several benchmark problems.
