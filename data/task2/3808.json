      "content": "Paper Title: SiamHAN: IPv6 Address Correlation Attacks on TLS Encrypted Traffic via Siamese Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the past years, we have witnessed an increasing number of network providers expediting the deployment of IPv6  [ref]37. Due to these efforts, one-third of Internet users can now access online services through IPv6 [ref]17. With this growth in use, however, come increased focus on security and privacy issues (e.g.,   [ref]11). A particular concern for the privacy of IPv6 users is the user activity correlation attack . In this attack, which works even on traffic encrypted by Transport Layer Security (TLS) , an adversary could identify and track users. Since an IPv6 address usually corresponds to one single user rather than a user group due to the rare deployment of NAT, a correlation attack against IPv6 remains a serious individual-level privacy threat. Activity correlation on IPv6 traffic can be grouped into two categories – address-based correlation and traffic characteristic correlation. Address-based correlation allows an adversary to associate an IPv6 address with a user’s activity, especially when an IPv6 address is in a weak configuration. For example, a user might configure a constant interface identifier through which a user’s activity could be pinpointed from multiple contexts . To eliminate this address correlation issue, RFC 4291  standard requires network operators to treat interface identifiers as semantically opaque. RFC 4941 standard  extends stateless address auto-configuration (SLAAC) allowing IPv6 users to use temporary addresses. Different from address-based correlation, traffic characteristic correlation associates traffic with users’ activities by analyzing the patterns in the encrypted traffic (e.g.,    ). While demonstrating high effectiveness in traffic-user-correlation, approaches of using this technique can only correlate the traffic of a selected subset of users because of the poor knowledge description and the unreliable similarity learning leads to false positives. In this paper, we demonstrate that a more sophisticated approach could overcome this limitation, presenting significantly more danger to the privacy of IPv6 users. In particular, we introduce a method to learn a correlation function from TLS encrypted traffic. Using the function, an adversary could determine whether two arbitrary addresses belong to the same user. Unlike prior works, this enables large-scale user activity correlation. Our proposed attack consists of two steps as follows. First, an adversary monitors the TLS encrypted traffic on a vantage point and then constructs a knowledge graph for each client address. Second, using Graph Neural Networks 2 along with Siamese Networks , we introduce a Siamese Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network – SiamHAN that employs multi-level attention and metric learning to capture the relationship between two IPv6 addresses with TLS encrypted traffic. In this work, we evaluate the performance of SiamHAN by using 5-month IPv6 user traffic collected at a vantage observation point. We show that SiamHAN could correlate the activities of pairwise IPv6 addresses with 90% accuracy based on 1-month adversary’s background knowledge. When applied to long-term user tracking and user discovery tasks, SiamHAN outperforms existing correlation techniques by significant margins. For instance, with an adversary’s background knowledge on a real-world 5-month dataset, tracking target users or discovering unique users could achieve 99% or 88% accuracy. This performance dramatically outperforms the state-of-the-art correlation system Deepcorr  which demonstrates only 85% or 60% accuracy. Contributions. Our contributions can be summarized as: We introduce a new IPv6 address correlation attack that effectively correlates a user’s TLS encrypted traffic with its dynamic address. We present a knowledge graph-based approach to model user behavior behind addresses. It exploits multi-type semantic meta-information to facilitate user correlation. We propose a correlation attack model – SiamHAN which demonstrates superior performance on IPv6 user activity correlation. We conduct extensive experiments on a 5-month IPv6 user TLS traffic dataset. Results show that SiamHAN is robust and could reach drastically high accuracy on multiple long-term user correlation tasks.\n Roadmap. Section 2 summarizes the prior researches related to our work. Section 3 introduces the threat model and the basic knowledge about IPv6 address correlation attacks. Section 4 highlights the overall design of SiamHAN. Section 5 presents the main setting for experiments. Section 6 shows the evaluation results and Section 7 discusses the mitigations against the attack. Section 8 concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: Over the past years, we have witnessed an increasing number of network providers expediting the deployment of IPv6  [ref]37.
