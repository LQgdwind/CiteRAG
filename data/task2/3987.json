      "content": "Paper Title: MDMLP: Image Classification from Scratch on Small Datasets with MLP\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMuch of the work has concentrated on pure MLP architectures on small-size datasets such as CIFAR10 7, but not nearly as accurate as ours. Various works   are committed to making MLP competitive with state-of-the-art models. Lin et al.  used fully connected networks together with heavy data augmentation and pre-training, achieving 70% accuracy on CIFAR10. Tolstikhin et al.  worked out the MLP-Mixer, attaining approximately 80% accuracy on CIFAR10 if trained from scratch. Neyshabur  developed an MLP architecture with a regularizer constraining the model to be closed to networks based on conv and get 85.19% accuracy on CIFAR10. Our work, MDMLP, conceptually simple and extremely light in the terms of parameters and flops but reaches high accuracy without heavy augmentations (mixup, cutmix, etc.). Pure MLP architectures have thrived on large-size datasets (14M-300M images, such as JFT-300M ) and mid-size datasets (1-10M images, such as IMAGENET-1K ) with heavy augmentations, but have yet to overcome small datasets. The MLP-Mixer  successfully achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-size datasets. Plenty of works   [ref]8  [ref]8  are successful with mid-size datasets in Image Classification. Other work    demonstrates that the pure MLP architecture can also gain fantastic performance in Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation. Hou et al. [ref]8 brought up the Vision Permutator with height and width dimensions, much similar to our work which keeping height, width and channel dimensions. By comparison, Our work focus on small-size datasets without heavy augmentations, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Flowers102, and so on. The work of attention mechanism  in computer vision  makes \"Patch Embed\" a core module in model design field. Cordonnier et al.  extracted 2 ×\\times 2 patches from the input image (referred as \"Patch Embed\") and applied self-attention layers on CIFAR10. Also, a lot of ViT variants     prove the excellent performance of ViT on large-size and mid-size image classification datasets, Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation. Other work 3 4 center on Unsupervised learning and transfer learning. Lee et al. 9 put forward shift layer to make ViT success in small-size datasets. Yu et al. 5 advised that the attention component is not necessary in transformer block. Our work use overlap patch embedding (i.e. split patch with overlap pixels) greatly improving our model’s performance. Many have attempted to make attention mechanism and MLP architecture explainable. Vision transformer 9 itself has visualized attention layer and positional embeddings. Chefer et al. 4 visualize attention layer in an image more clearly. Hao et al. 6 visualize attention layer in words and explain the inner properties. Touvron et al.  visualize the MLP’s positional embeddings. In our work, we use a 2-layer fully connected network with 8 hidden units as a new attention add-on to visualize the MLP’s learned representations, successfully draw the attention area and the object boundary. The model design field is full of vitality, to some degree, by modern training strategies and data augmentations methods. He et al. 6 developed residual connection, to handle the problem of gradient disappearance. Ba et al. 7 raised layer norm, making it possible to norm data of different shapes. Moreover, 8 and Liu et al. 9 use modern model design approaches, making the out-of-date convnet comes alive again. The Pytorch 0, timm 1 and einops library 2 provide a lot of add-ons for data augmentations and processing such as mixup 3, cutmix 4, label smoothing 5, random erase 6, EMA 7, stochastic depth 8, AutoAugment 9, RandAugment 0. But our work concentrate on lightweight the model, we do not use strong augmentation in our training regime in terms of this.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: such as IMAGENET-1K ) with heavy augmentations, but have yet to overcome small datasets.
