Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting Global and Local Attentions for Heavy Rain Removal on Single Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe use the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) [ref]13, and the structural similarity (SSIM)  index metrics to compare our GLA-HRRNet with the SOTA methods. Table I presents a comparison of our model with the following state of the art methods: JCAS , RESCAN , DID-MDN , SPANet , PreNet , UMRL [ref]40, DAFNet , HeavyRain , MSPFN [ref]16 and RCDNet . Except the JCAS, all methods in Table I utilize deep learning-based approaches. It can be observed that the methods trained for plain rain removal     [ref]16 perform very poorly on the heavy rain scenario. Meanwhile, the quantitative performance of our GLA-HRRNet is considerably superior to those of the others, outperforming the SOTA methods by more than 2dB in PSNR and 0.06 in SSIM. Table I demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed GLA-HRRNet, which exploits global and local attentions to remove rain and fog entangled in the heavy rains. Moreover, Fig. 9 depicts the qualitative results for our GLA-HRRNet and the SOTA methods. It can be seen that our GLA-HRRNet can effectively remove heavy rains in degraded images and presents very sharp and clean results, while the other methods show unremoved rain streaks, blur, and haze.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: We use the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) [ref]13, and the structural similarity (SSIM)  index metrics to compare our GLA-HRRNet with the SOTA methods.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
