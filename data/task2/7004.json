      "content": "Paper Title: FedDIP: Federated Learning with Extreme Dynamic Pruning and Incremental Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets and Models: We experiment with the datasets Fashion-MNIST , CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 . Fashion-MNIST consists of 60,0006000060,000 training and 10,0001000010,000 test 28x28 grayscale images labeled from 10 classes. Both of CIFAR datasets consist of 50,0005000050,000 training and 10,0001000010,000 test 32x32 color images; in CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 there are 10 classes (6000 images per class) and 100 classes (600 images per class), respectively. We consider the i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) case to compare all the algorithms and extend FedDIP to be applied for non-i.i.d. cases. To test and compare the efficiency of FedDIP, we use different well-known CNN architectures: LeNet-5[ref]41, AlexNet  and Resnet-18 [ref]7 as backbone (dense or unpruned) models, with the baseline FedAvg  and the pruning baselines PruneFL 2, PruneTrain , FedDST , DPF  (equivalent to FedDP as discussed above), and SNIP . For the non-i.i.d. case, we adopt the pathological data partition method in , which assigns only two classes for each node. We merge FedDIP with FedProx , a generalization and re-parametrization of FedAvg to address the heterogeneity of data (coined FedDIP+Prox), and compare with baseline FedAvg and FedProx.\nOur target is to evaluate FedDIP‚Äôs accuracy, storage, and communication efficiency in FL environments under extreme sparsity. Configurations: Table II details our configurations. For PruneFL, FedDST, and PruneTrain, we experimentally determined the optimal reconfiguration intervals RùëÖR to be 202020, 202020, and 111, respectively, to ensure the best possible model performance; the same for step size QùëÑQ for all models. Especially, the annealing factor for FedDST is set as 0.50.50.5.\nAs SNIP prunes the model before training, the global mask is pruned via one-shot achieving the target sparsity spsubscriptùë†ùëùs_{p}. We used grid-search to fix the penalty factor for PruneTrain ranging from 10‚àí1superscript10110^{-1} to 10‚àí5superscript10510^{-5} for different experiments. When necessary, other hyperparameters were set to match ours. In non-i.i.d. case, the penalty for the proximal term in FedProx is determined via grid-search ranging from 10‚àí1superscript10110^{-1} to 10‚àí5superscript10510^{-5}. FedDIP+Prox adopts the optimal combination of penalty values for FedDIP and FedProx. Hardware: Our FedDIP framework and experiments are implemented and conducted on GeForce RTX 3090s GPUs in the institution‚Äôs HPC environment.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: case to compare all the algorithms and extend FedDIP to be applied for non-i.i.d. cases.
