      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterized MDPs and Reinforcement Learning Problems - A Maximum Entropy Principle Based Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRelated Work in Entropy Regularization: Some of the previous works in RL literature   [ref]16 [ref]17 [ref]18     either use entropy as a regularization term (−log⁡μ​(at|st)𝜇conditionalsubscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡-\\log\\mu(a_{t}|s_{t}))   to the instantaneous cost function c​(st,at,st+1)𝑐subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡1c(s_{t},a_{t},s_{t+1}) or maximize the entropy (−∑aμ​(a|s)​log⁡μ​(a|s)subscript𝑎𝜇conditional𝑎𝑠𝜇conditional𝑎𝑠-\\sum_{a}\\mu(a|s)\\log\\mu(a|s)) [ref]16 [ref]17 [ref]18 associated only to the stochastic policy under constraints on the cost J𝐽J. This results into benefits such as better exploration, overcoming the effect of noise wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} in the instantaneous cost ctsubscript𝑐𝑡c_{t} and obtaining faster convergence. However, the resulting stochastic policy and soft-max approximation of the value function J𝐽J is not in compliance with the Maximum Entropy Principle applied to the distribution over the paths of MDP. Thus, the resulting stochastic policy is biased in its exploration over the paths of the MDP. Our simulations demonstrate the benefit of unbiased exploration (in our framework) in terms of faster convergence and better performance in noisy environment in comparison to the entropy regularized benchmark algorithm. Related Work in Parameterized MDPs and RL: The existing solution approaches    can be extended to the parameterized MDPs by discretizing the parameter domain. However, the resulting problem is not necessarily an MDP as every transition from one state to another is dependent on the path (and the parameter values) taken till the current state. Other related approaches for parameterized MDPs are case specific; for instance, 2 presents action-based parameterization of state space with application to service rate control in closed Jackson networks, and 3 4 5 6 7 8 incorporate parameterized actions that is applicable in the domain of RoboCup soccer where at each step the agent must select both the discrete action it wishes to execute as well as continuously valued parameters required by that action. On the other hand, the class of parameterized MDPs that we address in this article predominantly originate in network based applications that involves simultaneous routing and resource allocations and pose additional challenges of non-convexity and NP-hardness. We address these MDPs in both the scenarios, where the underlying model is known as well as unknown. Maximum Entropy Principle: \nWe briefly review the Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP)  since our framework relies heavily upon it. MEP states that for a random variable 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} with a given prior information, the most unbiased probability distribution given prior data is the one that maximizes the Shannon entropy. More specifically, let the known prior information of the random variable 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} be given as constraints on the expectation of the functions fk:𝒳→ℝ:subscript𝑓𝑘→𝒳ℝf_{k}:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}, 1≤k≤m1𝑘𝑚1\\leq k\\leq m. Then, the most unbiased probability distribution p𝒳​(⋅)subscript𝑝𝒳⋅p_{\\mathcal{X}}(\\cdot) solves where Fksubscript𝐹𝑘F_{k}, 1≤k≤m1𝑘𝑚1\\leq k\\leq m, are known expected values of the functions fksubscript𝑓𝑘f_{k}. The above optimization problem results into the Gibbs’ distribution 9 p𝒳​(xi)=exp⁡{−∑kλk​fk​(xi)}∑j=1nexp⁡{−∑kλk​fk​(xj)}subscript𝑝𝒳subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑘subscript𝜆𝑘subscript𝑓𝑘subscript𝑥𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑛subscript𝑘subscript𝜆𝑘subscript𝑓𝑘subscript𝑥𝑗p_{\\mathcal{X}}(x_{i})=\\frac{\\exp\\{-\\sum_{k}\\lambda_{k}f_{k}(x_{i})\\}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\exp\\{-\\sum_{k}\\lambda_{k}f_{k}(x_{j})\\}}, where λksubscript𝜆𝑘\\lambda_{k}, 1≤k≤m1𝑘𝑚1\\leq k\\leq m, are the Lagrange multipliers corresponding to the inequality constraints in (1).\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: Related Work in Entropy Regularization: Some of the previous works in RL literature   [ref]16 [ref]17 [ref]18     either use entropy as a regularization term (−log⁡μ​(at|st)𝜇conditionalsubscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡-\\log\\mu(a_{t}|s_{t}))   to the instantaneous cost function\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
