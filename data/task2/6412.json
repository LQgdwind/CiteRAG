      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge Transfer-Driven Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFew-shot learning (FSL) aims to develop machine learning algorithms capable of processing new classes using only a few samples.\nScarce training samples provide limited prior knowledge, making it challenging for the model to recognize new classes.\nTo address this issue, the learning paradigm in FSL is often organized as meta-tasks similar to the inference task.\nBased on this learning paradigm, many interesting works are proposed, which can be categorized into metric-based, optimization-based, and hallucination-based methods.\nThe metric-based methods   leverage different metrics or networks, such as Euclidean or Graph Neural Networks(GNNs), to construct the nearest neighbor classifier to measure the similarity between the support and query samples.\nThe optimization-based methods[ref]17 [ref]18   design different meta-learners or optimization strategies to learn to adapt to different query set with the support set,\nFor example, Finn et al. [ref]17 propose a classical and famous method named MAML, consisting of a meta-learner using the support set and a fixed learning rate to conduct model fast adaption.\nRusu et al. [ref]18 decouple the gradient-based adaptation procedure from the underlying high-dimensional space of model parameters to a low-dimensional space to make the model generalize to new tasks easier.\nBaik et al.  propose task-and-layer-wise attenuation on the compromised initialization to reduce the adverse effects of forcibly sharing the initialization in MAML.\nThe hallucination-based methods focus on learning a generation model or module to generate classification weights  or fake samples [ref]22 .\nFor example, Dong et al.  propose a method that utilizes the attention mechanism and fuses the information provided by both support and query set to generate the classification weights to classify query samples.\nXu et al.  propose a method that uses the conditional variational autoencoder to generate more representative features, while Dong et al. [ref]22 propose to generate the adversarial images to improve the representation ability of the model.\nThough this research field is similar to FSCIL, most FSL methods do not consider the performance on old classes, while FSCIL aims to achieve good performance on both old and new classes.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: such as Euclidean or Graph Neural Networks(GNNs), to construct the nearest neighbor classifier to measure the similarity between the support and query samples.\nThe optimization-based methods[ref]17 [ref]18   design different meta-learners or optimization strategies to learn to adapt to different query set with the support set,\nFor example, Finn et al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
