      "content": "Paper Title: FheFL: Fully Homomorphic Encryption Friendly Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning with Byzantine Users\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are a few notable works that intend to achieve both privacy and security in FL  [ref]16 [ref]18   . Table I compares the proposed work and other recent works. The first well-known approach that tackles both the security and privacy issues in FL using a single aggregation server was published in . In , each user will be interacting with all other users to compute the distances between their local model against other users‚Äô model updates using HE for every epoch. Then each user sends its local model updates and the distances to the server for aggregation. The secure-two-party computation between the users at every epoch in  adds significant communication overhead and computational complexity to each user. To offload the communication overhead and computational complexity from the users to the server, the works in [ref]16 [ref]18  utilise two non-colluding servers. In [ref]16, one of the two servers is considered a trusted server that possesses the secret keys of the users. This server can decrypt intermediate encrypted parameters; hence the work in [ref]16 follows a weak security assumption. Moreover, there is a secure two-party computation between the two servers using additively HE using Paillier cryptography. To overcome the limitations in [ref]16, Z. Ma et al. [ref]18 proposed a scheme called ShieldFL using a two-trapdoor Paillier HE scheme. The ShieldFL also utilises two servers, where the servers need to perform secure two-party computation to detect poisoning users. The Paillier HE-based secure two-party computation in [ref]18 encrypts the gradient vector element by element i.e., if there are mùëöm elements in a gradient vector, then there will be mùëöm Paillier encryption operations and mùëöm ciphertexts. Therefore, for a given security level (e.g., 128-bit or 256-bit security), the Paillier encryption approach used in [ref]18 generates a large number of ciphertexts and consumes a high computational cost compared to single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) approaches . For the proposed FheFL in our paper, we use CKKS based FHE scheme which exploits the SIMD technique to pack as many plaintext elements in one polynomial hence producing a compact ciphertext with just one encryption. Recently another work  proposed a lightweight FL scheme called LSFL for edge computing use case. The LSFL scheme uses two servers to perform a global model aggregation while preserving the privacy of user model updates via a lightweight randomisation technique. While the LSFL algorithm is the most efficient scheme compared to all other schemes, it relies on a weak security assumption that no users would collude with a server. This is a weak assumption given that there would be a number of malicious users in FL and it is possible for one of the servers to launch a Sybil attack on the LSFL scheme. To mitigate the two-server architecture proposed in the above works, the works in   proposing PPFL schemes secure against byzantine attacks with just one server. The common theme across these two works (similar to the above work in ) is to rely on users who communicates with all other users via two-party computations to identify poisoning users. H. Ma et. al. proposed a scheme that uses secret sharing to achieve privacy and commitment scheme, and group-based averaging to detect malicious users . In , the quantized neural network has been considered to ensure that the average of the aggregated parameter is within a certain range. If the average falls outside the range, then the update is excluded from the global model. The drawback of this method is that if one user in a group is malicious then the whole group will be excluded from the global model updates. Moreover, since the scheme‚Äôs security relies on the users in a small group, the number of users required to collude with the server to compromise a genuine user‚Äôs model update is less. Recently, Jebreel et al., proposed a novel FL architecture called fragmented FL . In , a user interacts with another user via a lightweight two-party secure computation scheme to exchange the fragments of the model updates to mix the model updates. Therefore, only around 50% of the elements in the model update vector belongs to the user and the remaining 50% are coming from another user. This approach breaks the link between the user‚Äôs training data and the shared model update hence preventing the inference attack by the server. One of the drawbacks of this approach is the communication overhead among the users in every epoch. Moreover, since the server can obtain the aggregated model updates of two users, the number of users required to collude with the server to compromise a genuine user‚Äôs model update is just one, hence this scheme‚Äôs security is based on weak security assumption. In contrast to existing work, our proposed scheme is designed as a single-server model and eliminates the need for user interaction in each epoch.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: There are a few notable works that intend to achieve both privacy and security in FL  [ref]16 [ref]18   .
