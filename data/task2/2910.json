      "content": "Paper Title: SOFT: Softmax-free Transformer with Linear Complexity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare our method with three existing linear Transformer models:\nLinformer [ref]35,\nPerformer [ref]5,\nNyströmformer [ref]40 in terms of model complexity and accuracy. Two experimental settings are adopted. Under the first setting, for all methods we use the same 𝚃𝚒𝚗𝚢𝚃𝚒𝚗𝚢\\tt Tiny (Table 2) architecture\nfor a fair comparison.\nThat is, we replace the core self-attention block in SOFT with each baseline’s own attention block with the rest of the architecture unchanged.\nNote that the spatial reduction module of \nis a special case of Linformer [ref]35.\nWe set the reduction ratio to be identical to ours.\nWith the same uniform sampling idea,\nwe replace the 1D window averaging of Nyströmformer [ref]40 (for NLP tasks) with 2D average pooling (for images).\nThe downsampling ratio remains identical to ours.\nIt is also worth mentioning that there is no official code released for Reformer  and the local Sensitive Hash (LSH) module has strict requirements on the length of input tokens. We thus do not include this method in our comparison. From Table 1 we can make the following observations:\n(i) Linear Transformer methods substantially reduce the memory and FLOPs while maintain similar parameter size comparing to the Transformer on the 𝚃𝚒𝚗𝚢𝚃𝚒𝚗𝚢\\tt Tiny architecture;\n(ii) Our approach SOFT achieves the best classification accuracy among all the linearization methods.\n(iii) Our inference speed is on-par with other compared linear Transformers and our training speed is slightly slower than Nystromformer and both are slower than Performer and Linformer.\nNote that the slow training speed of our model is mostly due to the Newton-Raphson iteration which can only be applied sequentially for ensuring the accuracy of Moore-Penrose inverse.\nIn summary, due to the on-par inference speed we consider the training cost increase is a price worth paying for our superior accuracy. Under the second setting, we focus on the memory efficiency of SOFT against the baselines.\nHere we follow the ViT  network structure, stacking 12 attention layers with hidden dimension d=384𝑑384d=384, heads h=12ℎ12h=12, bottleneck token sequence length m=49𝑚49m=49.\nDifferent attention blocks from the three\nlinearized Transformer variants, Linformer [ref]35, Performer [ref]5,\nand\nNyströmformer [ref]40 are studied.\nFor each Transformer variant, we adjust its token sequence length n𝑛n in a linear increment.\nSpecifically, we use a token sequence length of 784×p784𝑝784\\times p where p=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8𝑝12345678p=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and set batch size 1 to verify whether the memory consumption increases “quadratically” or “linearly”.\nFigure 1(b) shows all compared transformer variants including our SOFT indeed have a linear memory usage complexity.\nThis is in contrast with the standard Transformer which cannot cope with long token sequences with a quadratic complexity.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: We compare our method with three existing linear Transformer models:\nLinformer [ref]35,\nPerformer [ref]5,\nNyströmformer [ref]40 in terms of model complexity and accuracy.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
