      "content": "Paper Title: Transductive Zero-Shot Learning using Cross-Modal CycleGAN\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the last decade, the exponential evolution of computing power, combined with the creation of large-scale image datasets such as ImageNet [ref]1, have enabled Convolutional Neural Networks to keep improving their performances, with recent improvements \npushing forward the classification score every year. However, as noted in , such models have several drawbacks: they are unable to make predictions that fall outside of the set of training classes, their training requires a large number of examples for each class, and despite outmatching humans on the ImageNet challenge, they are unable to mimic the human capacity to generalize prior knowledge to recognize new classes. To cope with these limitations, Zero-Shot Learning  approaches have been proposed. In ZSL, two sets of classes are distinguished: the seen classes, for which examples are available during training, and the unseen classes, for which training images are not available.\nThe information learned using seen classes can be generalized to unseen ones by leveraging auxiliary knowledge, which semantically relates seen and unseen classes, e.g. attributes , or textual embeddings of class labels .\nEvaluation is then carried out on the unseen classes.\nHowever, all these approaches suffer from a domain shift problem : since the sets of seen and unseen classes are disjoint and potentially unrelated, the learned projection functions are biased towards seen classes. To alleviate the domain shift problem,\ntransductive ZSL (T-ZSL) has been proposed [ref]7. In this setting, unseen class labels and their corresponding images are known at training time, but not their correspondence.\nWhereas current T-ZSL approaches take advantage of the geometric structure of the visual space, e.g, with K-means clustering [ref]8 or nearest neighbor search , such methods do not scale to a high number of unseen classes, as we show experimentally in subsection 4.5. Indeed, when the number of unseen classes is high (e.g. 20K unseen classes for ImageNet), the visual space is not well-clustered, and class distributions have substantial overlap. In the present paper, we tackle this problem by building upon CycleGan : image and label distributions are aligned with an adversarial loss while ensuring that the structure of both spaces is preserved with a cycle-consistency loss. Thus, useful information is learned from the unseen classes distribution without relying on the clustering of the visual space. Our work follows unsupervised translation works that proved efficient on large-scale uni-modal datasets ,\nand extends them to a cross-modal setting where (P1) the geometry of the visual and textual spaces are essentially different and (P2) there is a high imbalance between the number of images and the number of class labels. In the model that we propose, called Cross-Modal CycleGAN (CM-GAN), two cross-modal mappings (text-to-image and image-to-text) are learned between a visual space and a textual space using: (i) a supervised max-margin triplet objective trained on seen classes, (ii) an unsupervised CycleGAN objective trained on unseen classes. We tackle (P1) by representing images as linear combinations of class labels representations, following the CONSE  approach — which enables textual and visual distributions to be close and thus adversarial losses to be learned — and (P2) by using an alternating optimization scheme where we progressively refine the projection of images and labels. Our approach is entirely new to ZSL. First, it differs from standard generative approaches (inductive or transductive)  , which learn to generate visual exemplars for unseen data, in order to feed them to a supervised classifier. Indeed, in our model, CycleGAN is used to learn cross-modal mappings directly, taking inspiration from uni-modal unsupervised translation models  . Second, it is different from standard transductive models, that only tackle attribute datasets with a low number of unseen classes, and that rely on the clusterization of the visual embedding space, as in [ref]8 where a K-means algorithm is learned on visual features of unseen data. We show that CM-GAN is particularly successful when the number of unseen classes is high (subsection 4.5), namely on the ImageNet T-ZSL task where it achieves state-of-the-art results.\nWe further validate the efficiency of CM-GAN on a language grounding task (subsection 4.6) and on a new task, namely zero-shot image-to-sentence matching, on MS COCO (subsection 4.7).\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Over the last decade, the exponential evolution of computing power, combined with the creation of large-scale image datasets such as ImageNet [ref]1, have enabled Convolutional Neural Networks to keep improving their performances, with recent improvements \npushing forward the classification score every year.
