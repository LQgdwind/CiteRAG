      "content": "Paper Title: SizeGS: Size-aware Compression of 3D Gaussians with Hierarchical Mixed Precision Quantization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n3D Gaussian Splatting  is proposed for reconstructing 3D scenes from 2D images, which represents a scene using a set of 3D Gaussian distributions. These Gaussians capture the density, color, and opacity of the scene. It is faster than previous methods [ref]29 and can produce high-quality, smooth results with fewer artifacts. Recently, a lot of work has been proposed for compressing 3D Gaussians. At first, they focused on compressing the original 3DGS model [ref]32         . Then, many works pay attention to compressing a more efficient GS model  [ref]28  , in which ScaffoldGS [ref]28 became the hot spot. It proposed to divide anchors into voxels and introduce an anchor feature for each voxel to grasp the common attributes of neural Gaussians in the voxel, i.e., the neural Gaussians are predicted by the anchor features. HAC  proposed a tailored compression method for it, extracting a context from the 3D coordinates to guide the quantization and entropy encoding. ContextGS  divides anchors into hierarchical levels and encodes them progressively. However, these compression frameworks for ScaffoldGS require training, and thus, the size varies greatly over time, making size estimation under given hyperparameters challenging. This paper transfers the relatively easy-to-estimate MesonGS to ScaffoldGS and conducts an in-depth analysis of the compression components of MesonGS to build a nearly delay-free size estimator. Though FCGS , a contemporary work, can produce a compressed model through a single inference of a feed-forward model in 16 seconds on an NVIDIA 3090, the feed-forward model can only compress a pre-trained 3DGS to one specific size. It cannot compress the same 3DGS to a different size, lacking the flexibility to adjust the compressed file size.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: 3D scenes from 2D images, which represents a scene using a set of 3D Gaussian distributions.
