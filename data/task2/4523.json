      "content": "Paper Title: A Linear Programming Approach for Resource-Aware Information-Theoretic Tree Abstractions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFrom the discussion in the previous section, it follows that if we are provided a grid-world 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W}, then the finest resolution tree corresponding to 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} is given by the tree 𝒯𝒲subscript𝒯𝒲\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathcal{W}} whose leafs x∈𝒩leaf​(𝒯𝒲)𝑥subscript𝒩leafsubscript𝒯𝒲x\\in\\mathcal{N}_{\\text{leaf}}(\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathcal{W}}) are the original grid-cells of the environment.\nOur objective in this section is to describe how one can utilize the information-theoretic ideas from Section 3.1 in order to formulate a problem whose solution is a multi-resolution, hierarchical tree representation of the world 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W}. To this end, we assume that a grid-world 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} is provided along with a joint distribution p​(x,y)𝑝𝑥𝑦p(x,y).\nThe joint distribution p​(x,y)𝑝𝑥𝑦p(x,y) captures the correlation between the original grid cells X𝑋X and the relevant random variable Y𝑌Y.\nFor example, if the world 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} is an occupancy grid and the objective is to form abstractions of 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} that are maximally predictive regarding the occupancy values, then p​(x,y)𝑝𝑥𝑦p(x,y) may be specified as p​(x,y)=p​(y|x)​p​(x)𝑝𝑥𝑦𝑝conditional𝑦𝑥𝑝𝑥p(x,y)=p(y|x)p(x), where the occupancy information is described by the conditional distribution p​(y|x)𝑝conditional𝑦𝑥p(y|x), and p​(x)𝑝𝑥p(x) is a distribution over world cells (e.g., distribution over possible locations of an autonomous agent).\nSince each tree 𝒯q∈𝒯𝒬subscript𝒯𝑞superscript𝒯𝒬\\mathcal{T}_{q}\\in\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{Q}} can be represented by a deterministic encoder pq​(t|x)subscript𝑝𝑞conditional𝑡𝑥p_{q}(t|x), it follows that by changing the tree, we alter the joint distribution pq​(t,x,y)subscript𝑝𝑞𝑡𝑥𝑦p_{q}(t,x,y) according to pq​(t,x,y)=pq​(t|x)​p​(x,y)subscript𝑝𝑞𝑡𝑥𝑦subscript𝑝𝑞conditional𝑡𝑥𝑝𝑥𝑦p_{q}(t,x,y)=p_{q}(t|x)p(x,y).\nConsequently, a random variable Tq:Ω→ℝ:subscript𝑇𝑞→ΩℝT_{q}:\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{R} can be constructed for each tree 𝒯q∈𝒯𝒬subscript𝒯𝑞superscript𝒯𝒬\\mathcal{T}_{q}\\in\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{Q}}, whose outcomes are the leafs of 𝒯qsubscript𝒯𝑞\\mathcal{T}_{q} and has distribution pq​(t)=∑xpq​(t|x)​p​(x)subscript𝑝𝑞𝑡subscript𝑥subscript𝑝𝑞conditional𝑡𝑥𝑝𝑥p_{q}(t)=\\sum_{x}p_{q}(t|x)p(x).\nThe random variable Tqsubscript𝑇𝑞T_{q} for each 𝒯q∈𝒯𝒬subscript𝒯𝑞superscript𝒯𝒬\\mathcal{T}_{q}\\in\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{Q}} can be viewed as a compressed representation of the random variable X𝑋X created by aggregating finest-resolution grid-cells of the world 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W}.\nThus, for each tree 𝒯q∈𝒯𝒬subscript𝒯𝑞superscript𝒯𝒬\\mathcal{T}_{q}\\in\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{Q}} we define the mappings IY:𝒯𝒬→[0,∞):subscript𝐼𝑌→superscript𝒯𝒬0I_{Y}:\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{Q}}\\to[0,\\infty) and IX:𝒯𝒬→[0,∞):subscript𝐼𝑋→superscript𝒯𝒬0I_{X}:\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{Q}}\\to[0,\\infty) according to the rules and respectively.\nWe note that in equations (17) and (18) the distributions p​(x)𝑝𝑥p(x) and p​(y)𝑝𝑦p(y) are not a function of the tree 𝒯q∈𝒯𝒬subscript𝒯𝑞superscript𝒯𝒬\\mathcal{T}_{q}\\in\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{Q}}, as they can be obtained by marginalizing the input distribution p​(x,y)𝑝𝑥𝑦p(x,y).\nBy changing the tree 𝒯q∈𝒯𝒬subscript𝒯𝑞superscript𝒯𝒬\\mathcal{T}_{q}\\in\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{Q}}, we change the encoder pq​(t|x)subscript𝑝𝑞conditional𝑡𝑥p_{q}(t|x), thereby changing the amount of relevant information captured by the compressed representation Tqsubscript𝑇𝑞T_{q} as well as the multi-resolution depiction of 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W}. Given the previous connection between encoders and trees, we observe that formalizing the problem of obtaining multi-resolution tree abstractions of 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} that are maximally informative regarding the task-relevant variable Y𝑌Y, can be done by employing an information-theoretic framework for signal compression with additional constraints on the structure of the encoder p​(t|x)𝑝conditional𝑡𝑥p(t|x).\nThe additional constraints placed on the encoder structure are necessary to ensure that the resulting solution to the compression problem corresponds to some tree 𝒯∈𝒯𝒬𝒯superscript𝒯𝒬\\mathcal{T}\\in\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{Q}}.\nThe problem we consider in the remainder of this chapter is now formally stated as follows. Given a joint distribution p​(x,y)𝑝𝑥𝑦p(x,y), a scalar D^≥0^𝐷0\\hat{D}\\geq 0, and the world 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W}, we consider the problem subject to the constraint △△\\triangle Problem 2 is equivalent to the problem (11) subject to (12) with the added constraint 𝒯q∈𝒯𝒬subscript𝒯𝑞superscript𝒯𝒬\\mathcal{T}_{q}\\in\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{Q}} that the encoder corresponds to a valid tree representation of 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W}.\nImposing the constraint 𝒯q∈𝒯𝒬subscript𝒯𝑞superscript𝒯𝒬\\mathcal{T}_{q}\\in\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{Q}} introduces a host of additional challenges, as existing methods for obtaining a solution to the problem (11)-(12) do not consider structural constraints on the encoder p​(t|x)𝑝conditional𝑡𝑥p(t|x).\nIn fact, the solution to the IB problem is, in general, a stochastic mapping p​(t|x)𝑝conditional𝑡𝑥p(t|x) .\nOther approaches, such as the agglomerative information bottleneck (AIB)  , design deterministic encoders by utilizing the IB principle and iteratively merging elements of the compressed representation T𝑇T until only the trivial abstraction, where T𝑇T only has a single outcome, remains.\nAlthough the end result of AIB is a family of deterministic encoders, the method does not consider the constraints requiring the encoder p​(t|x)𝑝conditional𝑡𝑥p(t|x) to be a member of some space, for example correspond to some 𝒯∈𝒯𝒬𝒯superscript𝒯𝒬\\mathcal{T}\\in\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{Q}}.\nOur problem is fundamentally different: we employ the IB principle to obtain a tree 𝒯q∈𝒯𝒬subscript𝒯𝑞superscript𝒯𝒬\\mathcal{T}_{q}\\in\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{Q}}, which is a solution to (19)-(20) as a function of D^≥0^𝐷0\\hat{D}\\geq 0, by enforcing the constraint 𝒯q∈𝒯𝒬subscript𝒯𝑞superscript𝒯𝒬\\mathcal{T}_{q}\\in\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{Q}}.\nNotice that the Problem 2, which aims to maximize compression subject to a lower-bound on the retained relevant information, is equivalent to the following problem . Given the joint distribution p​(x,y)𝑝𝑥𝑦p(x,y), a scalar D≥0𝐷0D\\geq 0, and the world 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W}, we consider the problem subject to the constraint △△\\triangle As opposed to maximizing compression subject to a lower bound on the retained relevant information, Problem 3 aims to maximize the relevant information subject to a bound on the achieved compression.\nSpecifically, the result of solving problem (19) subject to (20) as a function of D^≥0^𝐷0\\hat{D}\\geq 0 is a multi-resolution tree 𝒯q∈𝒯𝒬subscript𝒯𝑞superscript𝒯𝒬\\mathcal{T}_{q}\\in\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{Q}} that maximizes compression of 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} while ensuring the resulting representation contains at least D^^𝐷\\hat{D} units of relevant information.\nAlternatively, Problem 3 allows us to consider the emergence of tree abstractions of 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} that are maximally informative regarding the relevant variable Y𝑌Y while constraining the allowable compression to at least D≥0𝐷0D\\geq 0 units.\nAs the value of D≥0𝐷0D\\geq 0 in (22) increases, one obtains abstractions that are of higher leaf node cardinality, provided that they relay more task-relevant information.\nThe two formulations are equivalent, and provide different interpretations of the same information-theoretic compression principle . The most closely related work to our formulation in Problems 2 and 3 is the previous work by the authors of  [ref]27.\nIn  the authors considered the problem as a function of β>0𝛽0\\beta>0, assuming 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} and p​(x,y)𝑝𝑥𝑦p(x,y) are provided.\nThe optimization problem (23) is equivalent to the problem (13) restricted to the space 𝒯q∈𝒯𝒬subscript𝒯𝑞superscript𝒯𝒬\\mathcal{T}_{q}\\in\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{Q}}, as can be seen by multiplying (13) by the constant −1/β1𝛽-\\nicefrac{{1}}{{\\beta}}.\nThe authors of  develop an algorithm to solve (23) as a function of β>0𝛽0\\beta>0, termed Q-tree search, which utilizes a function similar to Q-functions employed in reinforcement learning, in order to decide which nodes in the tree to prune  .\nHowever, a notable drawback to the Q-tree search algorithm is its dependence on β>0𝛽0\\beta>0, which is,\nin turn, a function of the distribution p​(x,y)𝑝𝑥𝑦p(x,y).\nConsequently, selecting a value of β>0𝛽0\\beta>0 for a given level of desired retained relevant information IY​(𝒯)subscript𝐼𝑌𝒯I_{Y}(\\mathcal{T}) is non-trivial and is further exacerbated when the environment distribution p​(x,y)𝑝𝑥𝑦p(x,y) is time-varying, as is the case in many autonomous system applications.\nIn contrast, our formulations in Problems 2 and 3 are independent of β𝛽\\beta, instead allowing for the specification of the constraints directly in terms of constants (D^^𝐷\\hat{D} and D𝐷D, respectively) that do not depend on p​(x,y)𝑝𝑥𝑦p(x,y).\nMoreover, we argue that agent resource constraints, such as on-board memory or capacity of communication channels available to the agent, are more naturally specified in terms of constraints of the form of (22) that have an information-theoretic interpretation relating to channel capacity and data-rate, as compared to specifying the same resource constraints in terms of a scalar β>0𝛽0\\beta>0. While our formulation is a well-posed optimization problem, it is not obvious how to obtain the solution.\nA brute-force solution approach can be employed that exhaustively generates and enumerates all feasible trees in the set 𝒯𝒬superscript𝒯𝒬\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{Q}}.\nHowever, exhaustive search methods do not scale well to large environments, as the set 𝒯𝒬superscript𝒯𝒬\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{Q}} quickly grows so as to render the computational cost of exhaustively generating each of the trees in 𝒯𝒬superscript𝒯𝒬\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{Q}} prohibitively expensive.\nInstead, alternative solution approaches must be developed that exploit the structural properties of the problem.\nIn the next section, we show how Problem 2 (equivalently, Problem 3) can be posed as an integer linear program.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: different interpretations of the same information-theoretic compression principle .
