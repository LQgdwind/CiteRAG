      "content": "Paper Title: Cascade-DETR: Delving into High-Quality Universal Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCOCO  We perform evaluation on the challenging MS COCO 2017 object detection benchmark . Models are trained with 118k training images in train2017 split and evaluated on the 5k validation images in val2017.\nWe report the standard average precision (AP) result under different IoU thresholds. UVO and Cityscapes  To generalize on universal object detection, we also conduct experiments on two challenging datasets, UVO [ref]43 and Cityscapes . UVO is an exhaustively labeled open-world dataset with 15k training images and 7k validation images. Cityscapes is an urban street scene dataset which contains 3k training images and 500 validation images. We perform results comparison following the standard training and model evaluation setting on the two benchmarks. UDB10 Benchmark  There is a wide variety of detection applications in real-life scenarios. To facilitate the research on universal detection, we construct a large-scale UDB10 benchmark which is composed of 10 different datasets across wide domains.\nBesides the aforementioned COCO , Cityscapes  and UVO [ref]43, the other 7 task-specific datasets includes BDD100K [ref]48, Brain Tumor 7, Document Parts , Smoke , EgoHands , PlantDoc  and People in paintings .\nUDB10 contains 228k images, which covers a great variety of domains such as medical, traffic, nature, office, art, ego-view, etc.\nWe follow the official training/evaluation settings on each dataset component.\nAlong with the UDB10 benchmark, we design UniAP metric to evaluate the detection performance among detectors. After detectors are trained individually on each dataset component, UniAP is computed as the mean over the AP scores across all datasets. In Table 2, we compare UDB10 with two other existing universal detection benchmarks UODB  and Roboflow 100 1, where we find UDB10 has significantly more images and annotated instances per dataset component. We establish UDB10 aims to evaluate the detection performance of data-senstive DETR-based methods in diverse domains. Implementation Details  In our experiments, we use two different backbones: ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 pre-trained on ImageNet-1k, and train our model with an initial learning rate 1×10−51superscript1051\\times 10^{-5} for backbone and 1×10−41superscript1041\\times 10^{-4} for transformer. We use the AdamW optimizer with weight decay 1×10−41superscript1041\\times 10^{-4}. We train on 8 Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs with total batch size of 8, and adopt two training schedules. For small datasets (less than 10k images), we train DETR-based methods for 50 epochs with a learning rate decay after 40 epochs.\nFor large datasets (greater than or equal to 10k images), we adopt DETR-based methods for 12 epochs with a learning rate decay after 10 epochs.\nThe original DETR uses 100 queries, while in all other experiments we use 300 queries except DINO , where 900 queries are used to be consistent with their paper. For multi-scale features, we use DN-Deformable-DETR  with a deformable encoder. For the first layer cascade attention input box, we use the initial learnable anchor box proposed in DAB-DETR . For Faster-RCNN, we use 1X schedule for large datasets and 3X schedule for small datasets. For mask attention ablation on COCO, we train an extra mask head with ground truth mask annotations and do not use query recalibration. More details are in the Supp. file.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: standard average precision (AP) result under different IoU thresholds.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
