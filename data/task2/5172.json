      "content": "Paper Title: Federated Learning for 5G Base Station Traffic Forecasting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the development and increasing deployment of fifth generation (5G) cellular networks, networking infrastructures face challenges in handling traffic from heterogeneous devices, ensuring load balancing and maintaining the traffic management reliability  . To improve the services and resource management, accurate traffic forecasting techniques with low prediction error are essential. For example, forecasting Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing demand [ref]3 and high-volume traffic in long-term horizons  are crucial for 5G and beyond networks. Accurate predictions produced by machine learning algorithms can subsequently be used for proper network planning and optimization. Recent approaches in time-series forecasting primarily involve Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models , such as Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These models have demonstrated higher predictive accuracy than traditional methods like AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) [ref]6. Despite the recent advancements in neural networks, their predictive accuracy is limited by the number of observations or available data focus on single-party observations. The collection of data from different operators in 5G and beyond networks can induce storage and communication costs due to the rapid increase of data volume generated by devices, which further leads to scalability issues with respect to the predictive model [ref]3. In addition, regulations and laws worldwide, such as the GDPR, fragment data transmission and model training  and in many cases, business confidentiality issues prevent organizations from sharing their data, hindering real-world applications of traffic demand forecasting. To address these limitations, federated learning is proposed as a distributed machine learning approach that allows each party to collaborate in a model’s training process without exchanging or revealing their own data [ref]8. After collaborative training, the final global model has the potential to generalize to the parties that participated in the distributed training and federated learning holds the promise of reducing communication and computation efforts and also offers a high privacy level when user-based information has to be processed [ref]3. In the context of Federated Traffic Prediction for 5G and Beyond Challenge (our team won the first place in the Federated Traffic Prediction for 5G and Beyond Challenge and ranked fourth in the ITU AI/ML in 5G Challenge 2022), we are provided with a dataset from three individual base stations in Spain: ElBorn, LesCorts and PobleSec. The dataset comprises multivariate time-series with variables such as the Radio Network Temporary Identifiers (RNTI) count and the number of allocated resource blocks (RB). The challenge aims to train a model using a federated learning approach to predict the value of five distinct measurements for the next timestep, given as input the measurements from the preceding ten timesteps. Among the five measurements, the challenge focuses on the uplink and downlink transport block sizes, which are crucial for determining the volume and direction of flows. Federated learning differs significantly from centralized settings and has its own limitations and characteristics. Besides differences in the training process between the two approaches, federated settings pose several challenges regarding data distribution and quantity among participants, leading to accuracy degradation due to weight divergence during training  0 1 2. Figure 1 presents an example of distribution skew among the three base stations considered in this work regarding the five values to be predicted, which reflect the attribute and target skewness. To quantify the difference among distributions, we performed the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test 3 and observed p-values of zero or close to zero (e.g., 1×10−1901superscript101901\\times 10^{-190}) between base stations, suggesting significant differences. Besides data and target distribution skewness, the corresponding attributes hold temporal characteristics. Since we deal with time-series representations, federated learning poses additional challenges, namely, the temporal and quantity skew 1. First, the observations are collected in different time periods, i.e., March/April, 2018 - January, 2019 - February/March, 2018 per base station, respectively. Second, the data distributions change over time. An example of a changing distribution in the ElBorn base station for the uplink and downlink measurements is given in Fig. 2. It is observed that (at least) three out of seven days follow different patterns regarding the uplink and downlink measurements, which indicates local temporal skew. In this sense, the pattern from the previous day(s) may not follow the pattern for subsequent days. Motivated by the success of neural networks applied to centralized settings for time-series forecasting and the potential of federated learning, we study state-of-the-art learning models, including RNNs and a two-dimensional CNN applied to the federated setting.\nOne of the most crucial steps in federated learning is the aggregation function, particularly when dealing with non-iid data. Most of the proposed aggregators have been evaluated on different domain tasks such as image classification, sentiment analysis and next character/word prediction 4. Thus, in addition to the learning models, we assess the influence of different federated aggregation functions, including Federated Averaging with proximal term (FedProx) 5, Federated Averaging with Server Momentum (FedAvgM) 6, Federated Normalized Averaging (FedNova) 7 and Adaptive Federated Optimization (FedOpt) and its variations 8 in a real-world time-series forecasting task with non-iid data. Finally, we delve into the scalability of federated learning with respect to the training times, the size that needs to be transferred between the server and clients and the predictive accuracy and compare it with the centralized setting. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: We identify the challenge of training high quality federated forecasting models under three perspectives: i) data distribution skew, ii) quantity skew and iii) temporal skew. We experimentally compare five machine learning models trained under three different settings: i) individual learning, where each base station performs local training and evaluation, ii) centralized learning and iii) federated learning. We conduct extensive experiments using nine different aggregation algorithms, some of which are specifically designed for handling non-iid data. We show that preprocessing techniques can significantly reduce the prediction error and have greater impact than state-of-the-art aggregation algorithms for non-iid data. We open source a framework for evaluating federated time-series forecasting111https://github.com/vperifan/Federated-Time-Series-Forecasting, which is flexible, fully customizable and can serve as a baseline for future federated time-series research. Through our experiments we show that federated models achieve comparable predictive accuracy to individual and centralized learning. Additionally, we demonstrate that local preprocessing techniques, specifically outlier flooring and capping can lead to huge error reduction, while state-of-the-art aggregation algorithms for non-iid data do not outperform simpler approaches. Finally, we show that federated learning can scale up to numerous clients offering lower computational demands, training times and communication costs than centralized learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that applies federated learning to raw LTE data, considers attribute and target distribution, quantity and temporal skew and evaluates the prediction error by combining five machine learning models and nine aggregation functions. The rest of this work is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the main concepts of time-series forecasting and federated learning and reviews related work on federated time series forecasting. Section 3 defines the federated traffic prediction problem and presents the design of the federated setting as well as the federated aggregation functions. Section 4 discusses the experimental results. Finally, Section 5 concludes our work.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: .
