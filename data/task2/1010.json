      "content": "Paper Title: Counting Subgraphs in Degenerate Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBressan  provided a dynamic programming algorithm for computing hom⁡(H,G)hom𝐻𝐺\\hom(H,G) in O​(1)𝑂1O(1)-degenerate graphs G𝐺G.\nHis main result is that computing hom⁡(H,G)hom𝐻𝐺\\hom(H,G) in n𝑛n-vertex O​(1)𝑂1O(1)-degenerate graphs can be done in time333If one forgoes the requirement that the algorithm be deterministic, instead allowing\nLas Vegas randomized algorithms (as is done for example in [ref]10), then one can avoid the implicit polylogarithmic factor, obtaining an algorithm which runs in expected time O​(nτ1​(H))𝑂superscript𝑛subscript𝜏1𝐻O(n^{\\tau_{1}(H)}). Indeed, the polylogarithmic factor arises from the need to search and update a dictionary with O​(nτ1​(H))𝑂superscript𝑛subscript𝜏1𝐻O(n^{\\tau_{1}(H)}) entries. This can be done in time O​(1)𝑂1O(1) by using perfect hashing , at the cost of needing expected time O​(nτ1​(H))𝑂superscript𝑛subscript𝜏1𝐻O(n^{\\tau_{1}(H)}) to generate the hash table. Once generated, the algorithm proceeds deterministically.\nO~​(nτ1​(H))~𝑂superscript𝑛subscript𝜏1𝐻\\tilde{O}(n^{\\tau_{1}(H)}), where τ1​(H)subscript𝜏1𝐻\\tau_{1}(H) is a certain “width parameter” called the DAG treewidth of H𝐻H (we use the notation τ1subscript𝜏1\\tau_{1} to be consistent with ).\nIn our language, the special case τ1​(H)=1subscript𝜏1𝐻1\\tau_{1}(H)=1 of Bressan’s result states that hom-cntHsubscripthom-cnt𝐻\\textsc{hom-cnt}_{H} is easy if τ1​(H)=1subscript𝜏1𝐻1\\tau_{1}(H)=1.\nAs we will mainly focus on the case τ1​(H)=1subscript𝜏1𝐻1\\tau_{1}(H)=1, we shall not define τ1​(H)subscript𝜏1𝐻\\tau_{1}(H) here, but shall only define what it means for a graph to satisfy τ1​(H)=1subscript𝜏1𝐻1\\tau_{1}(H)=1. To do so, we first need to recall the well-known notion\nof hypergraph α𝛼\\alpha-acyclicity, which is closely related to the parameter τ1subscript𝜏1\\tau_{1}. A hypergraph F𝐹F is called α𝛼\\alpha-acyclic if there exists a tree T𝑇T whose vertices are the hyperedges of F𝐹F, such that the following condition is satisfied: for all e1,e2,e∈E​(F)=V​(T)subscript𝑒1subscript𝑒2𝑒𝐸𝐹𝑉𝑇e_{1},e_{2},e\\in E(F)=V(T), if e𝑒e is on the unique path in T𝑇T between e1subscript𝑒1e_{1} and e2subscript𝑒2e_{2}, then e1∩e2⊆esubscript𝑒1subscript𝑒2𝑒e_{1}\\cap e_{2}\\subseteq e. Hypergraph α𝛼\\alpha-acyclicity was introduced by Beeri, Fagin, Maier, Mendelzon, Ullman and Yannakakis  in the early 1980s in connection with relational database schemes, and has subsequently been widely studied. For further information, we refer the reader to\n .\nNote that in the special case that F𝐹F is a graph, α𝛼\\alpha-acyclicity is equivalent to being a forest. Next, one associates to each directed acyclic graph444We note that directed acyclic graphs arise naturally in the context of counting subgraphs in degenerate graphs. Indeed, many of the known counting algorithms  [ref]10  begin by orienting the edges of the given κ𝜅\\kappa-degenerate input graph G𝐺G according to some degeneracy ordering, thus obtaining an acyclic directed graph G→→𝐺\\vec{G} in which all out-degrees are at most κ𝜅\\kappa. Then the task becomes to compute hom⁡(H→,G→)hom→𝐻→𝐺\\hom(\\vec{H},\\vec{G}) for every acyclic orientation H→→𝐻\\vec{H} of H𝐻H. Summing these directed homomorphism counts then gives hom⁡(H,G)hom𝐻𝐺\\hom(H,G). (or DAG, for short) H→→𝐻\\vec{H} a hypergraph which captures the reachability structure of H→→𝐻\\vec{H}.\nFor a vertex u𝑢u in a directed graph H→→𝐻\\vec{H}, we denote by R​(u)𝑅𝑢R(u) the set of vertices that are reachable from u𝑢u (namely, the set of all v∈V​(H→)𝑣𝑉→𝐻v\\in V(\\vec{H}) such that there is a directed path from u𝑢u to v𝑣v). Note that u∈R​(u)𝑢𝑅𝑢u\\in R(u).\nRecall that any DAG has at least one source (i.e. vertex of in-degree 00). Given a DAG H→→𝐻\\vec{H} with source vertices u1,…,ursubscript𝑢1…subscript𝑢𝑟u_{1},\\dots,u_{r}, define an associated hypergraph FH→subscript𝐹→𝐻F_{\\vec{H}}, as follows: the vertices of FH→subscript𝐹→𝐻F_{\\vec{H}} are the vertices of H→→𝐻\\vec{H}, and the hyperedges of FH→subscript𝐹→𝐻F_{\\vec{H}} are the sets R​(ui)𝑅subscript𝑢𝑖R(u_{i}) for 1≤i≤r1𝑖𝑟1\\leq i\\leq r. Using this definition (and with a slight abuse of terminology), we can now define what it means for a DAG or an undirected graph to be α𝛼\\alpha-acyclic. We say that a DAG H→→𝐻\\vec{H} is α𝛼\\alpha-acyclic if the hypergraph FH→subscript𝐹→𝐻F_{\\vec{H}} is α𝛼\\alpha-acyclic. We say that an undirected graph H𝐻H is α𝛼\\alpha-acyclic if every acyclic orientation H→→𝐻\\vec{H} of H𝐻H is α𝛼\\alpha-acyclic. For an undirected graph H𝐻H, having τ1​(H)=1subscript𝜏1𝐻1\\tau_{1}(H)=1 is precisely equivalent to being α𝛼\\alpha-acyclic (this is merely a restatement of the definition of τ1subscript𝜏1\\tau_{1} for the case τ1​(H)=1subscript𝜏1𝐻1\\tau_{1}(H)=1 in a different language). As mentioned above, a special case of the main result of  implies that hom⁡(H,G)hom𝐻𝐺\\hom(H,G) can be computed in time O~​(n)~𝑂𝑛\\tilde{O}(n) whenever H𝐻H is α𝛼\\alpha-acyclic. Our main result, described in the following section, states that this sufficient condition is also necessary, thus giving a complete characterization of the graphs H𝐻H for which hom-cntHsubscripthom-cnt𝐻\\textsc{hom-cnt}_{H} is easy.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: O​(1)𝑂1O(1)-degenerate graphs can be done in time333If one forgoes the requirement that the algorithm be deterministic, instead allowing\nLas Vegas randomized algorithms (as is done for example in [ref]10), then one can avoid the implicit polylogarithmic factor, obtaining an algorithm which runs in expected time O​(nτ1​(H))𝑂superscript𝑛subscript𝜏1𝐻O(n^{\\tau_{1}(H)}).
