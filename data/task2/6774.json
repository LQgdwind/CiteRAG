      "content": "Paper Title: ALGAN: Time Series Anomaly Detection with Adjusted-LSTM GAN\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe implemented eight state-of-the-art anomaly detection models as baseline models to compare the performance of our proposed ALGAN model. Note all baselines cannot be executed on multivariate datasets, some of them (e.g. traditional models and vanilla LSTM model) are limited to single variate datasets only. Multivariate Anomaly Detection for Time Series Data with GAN (MadGan) [ref]6:\nIn this GAN-based model, the generator consists of a three-layer LSTM network with 100 units in each hidden layer, while the discriminator is a single-layer LSTM network with 100 hidden units. Auto Encoder (AutoEn)  :\nThis model comprises three layers: an LSTM encoder with 256 units and 20% dropout, an LSTM decoder with 512 units and 20% dropout, and a dense output layer with the same number of units as the small time series length. Bidirectional LSTM in GAN (BiLstmGan) [ref]45 :\nIn this model, the generator is composed of a three-layer bidirectional LSTM network with 50 units in each hidden layer, while the discriminator is a single-layer bidirectional LSTM network with 50 hidden units. CNN in GAN (CnnGan) [ref]7:\nThe generator and the discriminator consist of four stacked CNNs each. Every CNN has two convolutional layers with 20% dropout and ReLU activation. The kernel size is 256 and the number of units in each convolutional layer matches the small sequence length. The final layer is a dense layer. Vanilla Long Short-Term Memory (VanLstm)  :\nThis model uses LSTM to learn and predict the sequential patterns in the data. A data point is considered anomalous if its actual value deviates significantly from the LSTM prediction based on the previous window of time series data. This model has two LSTM layers with 256 and 512 hidden units respectively, and each layer applies 20% dropout randomly. Isolation Forest (IsoF) 6:\nThis conventional model randomly chooses a feature and a split point within the range of the chosen feature. A tree structure can represent the recursive partitioning process. The path length from the root to the leaf node corresponds to the number of splits required to isolate a sample. The average path length over a forest of random trees is an indicator of normality. Anomalies tend to have shorter paths due to partitioning. A sample with a short path length is likely to be anomalous. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) 4 5:\nThis is the most popular Unsupervised Clustering method that fits K𝐾K Gaussian curves to the data with K𝐾K clusters. Each Gaussian has three parameters: mean μ𝜇\\mu, variance σ𝜎\\sigma, and mixing probability π𝜋\\pi. The mean determines the center, the variance determines the width, and the mixing probability determines the size of the Gaussian. The mixing probabilities sum to one: ∑1Kπk=1superscriptsubscript1𝐾subscript𝜋𝑘1\\sum_{1}^{K}\\pi_{k}=1. Maximum likelihood estimates the optimal parameters for each Gaussian based on the data points in each cluster. Gaussian Mixture Models assign a probability p𝑝p to each data point being generated by one of K𝐾K Gaussians. A data point is an outlier if p<τ𝑝𝜏p<\\tau for all clusters, where τ𝜏\\tau is the threshold. One Class Support Vector Machine (OcSVM) 7:\nThis unsupervised method finds the minimum hypersphere that can contain most of the data instances. The anomaly score of an instance outside the hypersphere is proportional to its distance from the hypersphere.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: datasets, some of them (e.g. traditional models and vanilla LSTM model) are limited to single variate datasets only.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
