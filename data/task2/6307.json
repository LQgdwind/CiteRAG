      "content": "Paper Title: FheFL: Fully Homomorphic Encryption Friendly Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning with Byzantine Users\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFederated learning (FL) allows distributed users to learn collaboratively from data, without explicitly exchanging it. This is essential for a number of reasons, including data privacy requirements and regulations that limit the use and exchange of data. In this collaborative learning scheme, each user holds a portion of the distributed training data, which cannot be accessed by the central server (also known as the aggregation server). The users send their local gradients to the server, which aggregates and updates the global model, and then sends it back to the users. However, it has been revealed that sensitive information can be inferred from local gradients , leading to the development of privacy-preserving federated learning techniques (PPFL). The most notable of PPFL algorithms utilise secure aggregation    , differential privacy  , and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)  . Each of these techniques has its own benefits and drawbacks which are discussed in Section 2 in further detail. These techniques have been developed to ensure that individual user updates are masked, anonymized or encrypted prior to sending them to the server, preventing the server from inferring users’ privacy-sensitive information from the local model updates. While these approaches solve the privacy issue related to information leakage, this inadvertently realizes a security threat, known as a poisoning attack. In a poisoning attack, malicious users sabotage the collaborative learning process by training the local model on fake or rogue data and sending their malicious model updates to the server. If model updates are protected by some of the existing PPFL techniques, it can be easy for malicious users to be successful with a poisoning attack. It should be noted that poisoning attacks are difficult to detect even in non-PPFL settings [ref]11   [ref]14, and hence this is another active area of research in FL. Notable techniques to mitigate poisoning attacks include machine learning to detect outliers [ref]11, clustering using similarities [ref]18 and detecting anomalies 1; using the performance analysis of global model against local model 2; gradient clipping [ref]14; and removing extreme values . It should be noted that these detection techniques require the server to access the users’ model updates in plaintext, which leads to the initial privacy issue related to information leakage. Therefore, solving privacy issues leads to security issues and vice versa. In this particular context, we aim to develop a robust mechanism called FheFL that prevents malicious actors’ intention to corrupt the FL process and ensures that each user’s data remains secure and private throughout the entire process. While there are numerous works that have tried to solve one of the two attacks, only a handful of works in literature have attempted to solve both of these attacks using a single solution   [ref]18   0. However, as detailed in Section 2, these solutions either rely on two non-colluding servers  [ref]18 0 or collaboration between users , or follow all-on-nothing approch i.e., punish the user (or the group that the user belongs to) by ignoring the model updates if the distance between the updated values is high  . In contrast to the existing works, FheFL proposes a novel PPFL mechanism that leverages FHE to achieve robustness, security and privacy preservation. Moreover, FheFL utilizes only one server for secure aggregation. We also introduce a recursive weighted update scheme, that works well with FHE, to detect and mitigate the impact of poisoning users without interacting with other user groups, hence overcoming both the all-or-nothing limitations and the need for interaction between users.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: the existing PPFL techniques, it can be easy for malicious users to be successful with a poisoning attack.
