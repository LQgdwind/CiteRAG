      "content": "Paper Title: Certified Adversarial Defenses Meet Out-of-Distribution Corruptions: Benchmarking Robustness and Simple Baselines\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) trained using standard gradient descent optimizers¬† have been shown vulnerable to adversarial examples¬†.\nA number of white- and black-box attacks have been proposed¬†[ref]5     to construct adversarial examples with small ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p} distances to the original data that mislead these DNN models.\nBesides adversarial attacks, recent studies have devoted efforts to characterizing model performance under out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts¬†1 , where natural corruptions lead to a significant impact on the accuracy of SOTA ML models.\nThus, it has become imperative to study how ML models can be made robust to test data coming from different distributions when the models are deployed in the real world. Certified Robustness and Defenses.‚ÄÉThe authors in¬† have discovered the adversarial examples in DNN models, after which many defenses have been presented to mitigate such vulnerability¬†. However, many of the proposed countermeasures have been shown to rely on gradient obfuscation, limiting malicious agents from accessing the accurate gradients. Such defenses are vulnerable to adaptive attacks, which give a false sense of security¬† of the models. Certified defenses are thus highly desirable. Along with a prediction on the test point, these defenses output a certified radius rùëür such that for any ‚Äñùúπ‚Äñ2<rsubscriptnormùúπ2ùëü||{\\bm{\\delta}}||_{2}<r, the model continues to have the same prediction. Such techniques include convex polytope, recursive propagation, and linear relaxation . These methods provide a lower bound on the perturbation required to change the model‚Äôs prediction on a target point. However, such methods can merely be applied to shallow models, which limits their practicality. Recently,¬†2 1  9 have proposed randomized smoothing (RS)-based certified defenses that produce better lower bounds and are scalable to large networks. In this paper, we study the OOD robustness of such certified defenses. Unlike a recent work¬†6, which uses data poisoning attacks to hurt the robustness guarantees of the RS-based models, our work demonstrates the failure of these models on test-time corruptions, which might be encountered by the model deployed in the real world. Robustness against Common Corruptions ‚Äì Benchmarks and Defenses.‚ÄÉPioneering studies have identified vulnerabilities of deep learning models to common corruptions.\nDodge¬†et al. find that standard trained DNNs are vulnerable to blur and Gaussian noise¬†.\nHendrycks et al.¬†1 present CIFAR-10/100-C and ImageNet-C, consisting of fifteen different common corruptions with five severity levels to facilitate robustness evaluations of CIFAR¬†0 and ImageNet¬† models.\nRecently, Mintum¬†et al. further propose CIFAR-10/100-C¬Ø¬ØC\\bar{\\text{C}} and ImageNet-C¬Ø¬ØC\\bar{\\text{C}} to provide new corruptions¬†7.\nThere are two popular lines of work on improving the robustness against common corruptions: test-time adaptation¬† and data augmentation¬† 2.\nThe authors in  propose a method to update the batch normalization (BN) statistics for improving domain adaptation. Another recent method, TENT updates both the affine transformation and statistics of BN by using self-entropy minimization. On the other hand, methods such as AutoAugment¬† leverages reinforcement learning to learn an augmentation policy that produces a diverse set of augmentations to help make the models robust to OOD data. Another popular method, AugMix¬†2 achieves impressive performance improvement on corrupted data using augmentations generated by mixing up images obtained from applying randomly sampled operations along with using a Jenson-Shannon based consistency loss during training. Unlike existing data augmentation schemes which intend to improve the empirical robust accuracy of the models, the data augmentation schemes of interest to this paper aim to improve the adversarial robustness guarantees on OOD data. Certified Semantic Robustness.‚ÄÉRecent work   4 have also focused on developing techniques to provide performance guarantees to seen (or known) common corruption types (such as rotation or brightness changes). However, in this work, we are interested in more realistic scenarios with unseen (or unknown) test-time corruptions. It is worth noting that the susceptibility analysis and defense techniques developed in this work can be extended to SOTA semantic robustness techniques.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained using standard gradient descent optimizers¬† have been shown vulnerable to adversarial examples¬†.\nA number of white- and black-box attacks have been proposed¬†[ref]5     to construct adversarial examples with small ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p} distances to the original data that mislead these DNN models.\nBesides adversarial attacks, recent studies have devoted\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
