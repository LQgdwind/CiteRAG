Hackers can be detected using heuristics (e.g., too many kills in a short time is suspicious) or with statistical models derived from data (e.g., VACNet  and related work,  ). As these types of anti-cheats are executed on the game servers and use the same data the player client must send to play the game in multiplayer games, they cannot be bypassed by hackers like traditional anti-cheats can be. Unfortunately, these methods do have their weakness: errors in classification  . Identifying hackers is a binary-classification task: is the given player a hacker or bona fide?222Genuine, legitimate, sincere. In our context “non-cheating”. With two possible cases and two possible decisions, there are four outcomes, two of which are desired (correct decisions) and two which are errors. In a false positive (FP) case, a bona fide player is predicted as a hacker, and in a false negative (FN) case a hacking player is predicted as a bona fide player. Since the two classes are unlikely to be perfectly distinguishable (i.e., mistakes will inevitably occur), system designers must balance between user convenience and security.\nA game developer likely wants to develop a system that exerts caution when flagging people hackers, as FPs harm bona fide players, which in turn harm the game’s reputation. However, if an anti-cheat only analyses player performance, then a hacker can adjust their hacks to mimic top-performing, bona fide players. These hackers are still better than most players and they avoid detection by an anti-cheat system that has been tuned not to flag top-performing players. This approach clearly has limitations, which brings us to the analysis of player behaviour. For example, FairFight gathers information on how a player moves and aims at targets through walls [ref]26. If a player often aims at enemies behind obstacles and walls, this behaviour signals that a hack is being used, and the player can be flagged. VACNet employs a similar approach: a deep learning model has been trained to classify between bona fide and hacking players according to their mouse movement, using a dataset of known hackers and bona fide players . This kind of anti-cheat does not rely on high performance to detect a hacker, as it attacks the very core of hacking: altering the player’s behaviour to improve performance. A hack cannot improve a player’s performance if it does not alter their behaviour.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: This approach clearly has limitations, which brings us to the analysis of player behaviour.
