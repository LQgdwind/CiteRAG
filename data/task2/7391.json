      "content": "Paper Title: HASSOD: Hierarchical Adaptive Self-Supervised Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnsupervised object detection/discovery.\nIdentifying and locating objects in images without using any human annotations is a challenging task, as it requires learning the concept of objects from image data without any external supervision. OSD [ref]33 formulates this task as an optimization problem on a graph, where the nodes are object proposals generated by selective search, and the edges are constructed based on visual similarities. rOSD [ref]34 improves the scalability of OSD with a saliency-based region proposal algorithm and a two-stage strategy. LOD [ref]35 formulates unsupervised object discovery as a ranking optimization problem for improved computation efficiency. Following the observation that DINO , a self-supervised pre-training method, can segment the most prominent object in each image, LOST , FOUND , and FreeSOLO  train object detectors using saliency-based pseudo-labels. TokenCut  and CutLER  also use self-supervised representations, but generate pseudo-labels by extending Normalized Cuts . Saliency-based region proposal and Normalized Cuts are both focused on the prominent objects in each image, and usually only propose one or few objects per image. Different from these approaches, HASSOD produces initial pseudo-labels using a hierarchical adaptive clustering strategy, which can adaptively determine the number of objects depending on the image contents. Object detection by parts.\nDetecting objects by identifying their composing parts has been widely studied in computer vision. Deformable Parts Model (DPM)  is a seminal approach that utilizes discriminatively trained part-based models for object detection, which effectively models complex object structures and improves over monolithic detectors. A following method  not only detects the objects, but also simultaneously represents them using body parts, highlighting the importance of both holistic models and part-based representations. This idea is extended by leveraging both whole object and part detections to infer human actions and attributes , suggesting the advantage of a combined approach. In this work, we revisit this classic idea of representing and detecting whole objects as well as their parts in the context of self-supervised learning.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: and locating objects in images without using any human annotations is a challenging task, as it requires learning the concept of objects from image data without any external supervision.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
