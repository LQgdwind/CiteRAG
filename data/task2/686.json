      "content": "Paper Title: Kyrix-S: Authoring Scalable Scatterplot Visualizations of Big Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere has been considerable effort made to develop specialized SSV systems, which mainly suffer from two limitations: low flexibility and limited scalability. Many systems focus on a small subset of the SSV design space, and are not designed/coded to be easily extensible. For example, many focus on specific visual marks such as small-sized dots (e.g.  ), heatmaps (e.g.[ref]43    ), text, aggregation-based glyphs  and contours. Some works maintain a visual density budget [ref]43 [ref]23, while some focus on overlap removal  .\nIn contrast to these systems, Kyrix-S aims at a much larger design space. We provide a diverse library of visualization templates that are suitable for a variety of scatterplot tasks. For high extensibility, Kyrix-S‚Äôs declarative grammar is designed with extensible components for authoring custom visual marks. In addition to the limited focus, most specialized SSV systems cannot scale to large datasets with billions of objects due to an in-memory assumption 6 [ref]23    9 . We are only aware of the work by Perrot et al.[ref]43 which renders large heatmaps using a distributed computing framework. However, that work only focuses on heatmaps. Specialized SSV systems generally come with a layout generation module which computes the layout of visual marks on each zoom level. The design of Kyrix-S‚Äôs layout generation is inspired by many of them and bears similarities in some aspects. For example, favoring placements of important objects on top zoom levels is adopted by many works[ref]23  . The idea of enforcing a minimum distance between visual marks comes from blue-noise sampling strategies[ref]43  [ref]23. However, the key differentiating factor of Kyrix-S comes from its more stringent requirements on scalability and the design space. These requirements (see Section 3) pose new algorithmic challenges. For instance, Sarma et al. uses an integer programming solution without considering overlaps of objects. To enable overlap removal, one needs to add O‚Äã(n2)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõ2O(n^{2}) pairwise non-overlap constraints into the integer program, making it hard to solve in reasonable time.\nAs another example, Guo et al.[ref]23 and Chen et al. do not support visual marks that show a group of objects with useful aggregated information. This requires a bottom-up aggregation process which breaks their top-down algorithmic flow. In order to scale to billions of objects, Kyrix-S cannot rely on existing algorithms and instead needs to compute visual mark layouts in parallel using a distributed algorithm as described in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: focus on a small subset of the SSV design space, and are not designed/coded to be easily extensible. For example, many focus on specific visual marks such as small-sized dots (e.g.  ), heatmaps (e.g.[ref]43    ), text, aggregation-based glyphs  and contours. Some works maintain a visual density budget [ref]43 [ref]23, while some focus on overlap removal  .\nIn contrast to these systems, Kyrix-S\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
