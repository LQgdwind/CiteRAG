Symbolic Methods]. specification which\nwould allow us to derive effective Boltzmann samplers. In order to sample from\nsuch classes, we approximate them using finite, admissible specifications,\nusing rejection methods if needed. Closed λ𝜆\\lambda-terms.\nMost λ𝜆\\lambda-term representations, such\nas    admit a common, general\nsymbolic specification template, differing only in weights assigned to specific\nconstructors (i.e. variables, applications, and abstractions). Let ℒℒ\\mathcal{L},\nℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, ℬℬ\\mathcal{B}, 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}, and 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U} denote the class of (open or closed)\nλ𝜆\\lambda-terms, free and bound variables, a single application node, and\na single abstraction node, respectively. Then, ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} admits the following specification: In words, a λ𝜆\\lambda-term is either a free variable in ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, an\napplication of two terms (𝒜×ℒ2)𝒜superscriptℒ2(\\mathcal{A}\\times{\\mathcal{L}}^{2}) joined by an application\nnode, or an abstraction followed by a lambda term in which some free variables\nbecome bound by the head abstraction (i.e. are substituted by some bound\nvariables in 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}). Since not all free variables have to be bound by the\ntopmost abstraction, free variables can also be substituted for variables in\nℱℱ\\mathcal{F}. Let F​V​(T)𝐹𝑉𝑇FV(T) denote the set of free variables in T𝑇T. Consider the following\nbivariate generating function L​(z,f)𝐿𝑧𝑓L(z,f) defined as L​(z,f)𝐿𝑧𝑓L(z,f) sums over all terms T𝑇T using variable z𝑧z to account for T𝑇Ts\nsize, and variable f𝑓f to account for the number of its free variables. For\ninstance, consider the combinator 𝐒=λ​x​y​z.x​z​(y​z)formulae-sequence𝐒𝜆𝑥𝑦𝑧𝑥𝑧𝑦𝑧\\mathbf{S}=\\lambda xyz.xz(yz). If we\nassume that |𝐒|=10𝐒10|\\mathbf{S}|=10 (one size unit for each abstraction,\napplications, and variable), then its respective monomial in L​(z,f)𝐿𝑧𝑓L(z,f) becomes\nz10​f0superscript𝑧10superscript𝑓0z^{10}f^{0}. If we group matching monomials we note the coefficient [zn​fk]​L​(z,f)delimited-[]superscript𝑧𝑛superscript𝑓𝑘𝐿𝑧𝑓[z^{n}f^{k}]L(z,f) stands\nfor the number of terms of size n𝑛n and exactly k𝑘k free variables. In\nparticular, the coefficient [zn​f0]​L​(z,f)delimited-[]superscript𝑧𝑛superscript𝑓0𝐿𝑧𝑓[z^{n}f^{0}]L(z,f) corresponds to the number of\nclosed λ𝜆\\lambda-terms of size n𝑛n. We can also look at whole series\nassociated with specific powers. For instance, [f0]​L​(z,f)=∑n≥0zn​f0delimited-[]superscript𝑓0𝐿𝑧𝑓subscript𝑛0superscript𝑧𝑛superscript𝑓0[f^{0}]L(z,f)=\\sum_{n\\geq 0}z^{n}f^{0} corresponds to the univariate generating function enumerating closed\nλ𝜆\\lambda-terms. In general, [fk]​L​(z,f)delimited-[]superscript𝑓𝑘𝐿𝑧𝑓[f^{k}]L(z,f) is the generating\nfunction corresponding to λ𝜆\\lambda-terms with exactly k𝑘k free\nvariables. Unfortunately, by (19) the series\n[f0]​L​(z,f)delimited-[]superscript𝑓0𝐿𝑧𝑓[f^{0}]L(z,f) depends on [f1]​L​(z,f)delimited-[]superscript𝑓1𝐿𝑧𝑓[f^{1}]L(z,f) which, in turn, depends on [f2]​L​(z,f)delimited-[]superscript𝑓2𝐿𝑧𝑓[f^{2}]L(z,f),\netc. Note that each new abstraction can bind occurrences of a\nvariable. Consequently, the abstraction body can have one more free variable than the\nwhole term. Due to this apparent infinite inductive nesting, finding the\ngenerating function [f0]​L​(z,f)delimited-[]superscript𝑓0𝐿𝑧𝑓[f^{0}]L(z,f) for closed terms, as well as generating\nrespective terms using Boltzmann models, is as difficult as the general case\n[fk]​L​(z,f)delimited-[]superscript𝑓𝑘𝐿𝑧𝑓[f^{k}]L(z,f). Despite the inadmissible\nspecification (19) it is still\npossible to use recursive samplers for closed λ𝜆\\lambda-terms.\nThe number of free variables is bounded by the overall term size and, in\nparticular, related to the number of term applications. Hence, for target\nterm size n𝑛n we essentially need to memorise all of the values [z≤k​f0]​L​(z,f),…,[z≤k,fn]​L​(z,f)delimited-[]superscript𝑧absent𝑘superscript𝑓0𝐿𝑧𝑓…superscript𝑧absent𝑘superscript𝑓𝑛𝐿𝑧𝑓[z^{\\leq k}f^{0}]L(z,f),\\ldots,[z^{\\leq k},f^{n}]L(z,f) for k=0,…,n𝑘0…𝑛k=0,\\ldots,n. Still, such a method allows us to sample terms of relatively small sizes,\nespecially if the involved numbers [z≤k​fm]​L​(z,f)delimited-[]superscript𝑧absent𝑘superscript𝑓𝑚𝐿𝑧𝑓[z^{\\leq k}f^{m}]L(z,f) grow too fast,\ncf.  . Consequently, the standard\npractice is to restrict the class of generated terms, using\npractically justifiable criteria, such as limiting their unary height, number\nof abstractions, or the maximal allowed De Bruijn index, see\ne.g.   [ref]5. In all these cases,\nthe infinite inductive nesting of parameters becomes finite, and so it is\npossible to use more efficient sampling techniques, such as Boltzmann\nsampling. Under certain term representations, it is possible to sample large, unrestricted\nclosed λ𝜆\\lambda-terms, despite the infinite nesting problem. Let us\nconsider the class of λ𝜆\\lambda-terms in the De Bruijn notation. For\nconvenience, assume the natural size notion in which each constructor (including\nthe successor and zero) weights one . Let L​(z)𝐿𝑧L(z)\ndenote the corresponding generating function for plain (open or closed) terms and Lm​(z)subscript𝐿𝑚𝑧L_{m}(z) denote\nthe generating function corresponding to so-called m𝑚m-open\nλ𝜆\\lambda-terms, i.e. terms which when prepended with m𝑚m head\nabstractions become closed. Note that if a term is m𝑚m-open, then it\nis also (m+1)𝑚1(m+1)-open. With the help of Lm​(z)subscript𝐿𝑚𝑧L_{m}(z) we can\nrewrite (19) into a more verbose, infinite\nspecification exhibiting the precise relations among various openness levels: In words, if a term is m𝑚m-open, then it is either an application of\ntwo m𝑚m-open terms, accounted for in the expression z​Lm​(z)2𝑧subscript𝐿𝑚superscript𝑧2z{L_{m}(z)}^{2},\nan abstraction followed by an (m+1)𝑚1(m+1)-term, accounted for in the\nexpression z​Lm+1​(z)𝑧subscript𝐿𝑚1𝑧zL_{m+1}(z) or, finally, one of m𝑚m available indices\n0,…,…,m-10……m-1\\mbox{\\text@underline{\\sf 0}},\\ldots,\\ldots,\\mbox{\\text@underline{\\sf m-1}}. Note that n=S(n)​0nsuperscript𝑆𝑛0\\mbox{\\text@underline{\\sf n}}=S^{(n)}0 and so |n|=n+1n𝑛1|\\mbox{\\text@underline{\\sf n}}|=n+1. Hence the final expression z​1−zm1−z𝑧1superscript𝑧𝑚1𝑧z\\frac{1-z^{m}}{1-z}. Although infinite, such a specification can be effectively analysed using\nrecently developed analytic\ntechniques  . As a\nby-product of this analysis, it is possible to devise a simple and highly\neffective rejection-based sampling scheme for closed\nλ𝜆\\lambda-terms.\nConsider the following truncated variant of (21): Note that instead of unfolding the definition of Lm+1​(z)subscript𝐿𝑚1𝑧L_{m+1}(z) indefinitely, we\nstop at level N𝑁N and use the generating function L​(z)𝐿𝑧L(z) corresponding to\nall λ𝜆\\lambda-terms at the final level N𝑁N. Such a\nfinite specification defines a subclass of plain λ𝜆\\lambda-terms\nexcluding open terms without sufficiently large index values. In particular,\nthis class of terms approximates quite well the set of closed terms. Following  we\nuse (22) to sample plain\nλ𝜆\\lambda-terms and reject those which are not closed. The\nasymptotic number [zn]​L0,N​(z)delimited-[]superscript𝑧𝑛subscript𝐿0𝑁𝑧[z^{n}]L_{0,N}(z) of such terms approaches the asymptotic\nnumber [zn]​L0​(z)delimited-[]superscript𝑧𝑛subscript𝐿0𝑧[z^{n}]L_{0}(z) of closed terms exponentially fast as N𝑁N tends to\ninfinity. In consequence, the imposed rejection does not influence the linear\nO​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) time complexity of the sampler drawing objects from some interval\n[(1−ε)​n,(1+ε)​n]1𝜀𝑛1𝜀𝑛[(1-\\varepsilon)n,(1+\\varepsilon)n]. In fact, with N=20𝑁20N=20 the probability\nof rejection is already of order 10−8superscript10810^{-8}, cf. [14, Section\n5.4]. Consequently, such a sampler rarely needs to dismiss\ngenerated terms and is able to generate large random closed\nλ𝜆\\lambda-terms of sizes in the millions. The discussed sampling method works for a broad class of size notions\nwithin the De Bruijn term representation .\nIt is, however, specific to the unary encoding of De Bruijn indices. The intuitive reason behind the success of the above rejection sampler lies is\nthe fact that random plain terms strongly resemble closed ones. Typically, large\nrandom terms are almost closed. For instance, on average, a random term\ncontains a constant number of free variables, and needs just a few additional\nhead abstractions to become closed . Typeable λ𝜆\\lambda-terms.\nMuch like closed λ𝜆\\lambda-terms, simply-typed terms do not admit a\nfinite, admissible specification from which we could derive efficient samplers.\nSimple recursive samplers work, however cease to be effective already for small\nterm sizes, cf. Section 2.1. Sampling\nsimply-typed terms seems notoriously more challenging than sampling closed ones.\nEven rejection sampling, whenever applicable, admits serious limitations due to\nthe imminent asymptotic sparsity problem — asymptotically almost no\nterm, be it either plain or closed, is at the same time (simply) typeable. This\nproblem is not only intrinsic to De Bruijn models,\nsee , but also seems to hold in models in\nwhich variables contribute constant weight to the term size, see\ne.g.  . Asymptotic sparsity of simply-typed λ𝜆\\lambda-terms is an\nimpenetrable barrier to rejection sampling techniques. As the term size tends to\ninfinity, so does the induced rejection overhead. In order to postpone this\ninevitable obstacle, it is possible to use dedicated mechanisms interrupting the\nsampler as soon as it is clear that the partially generated term cannot be\nextended to a typeable one. The current state-of-the-art samplers take this\napproach, combining Boltzmann models with modern logic programming execution\nengines backed by highly-optimised unification\nalgorithms [ref]8. Nonetheless, even with these\nsophisticated optimisations, such samplers are not likely to generate terms of\nsizes larger than one hundred. For some restricted classes of typeable terms there exist effective sampling\nmethods, such as the already mentioned samplers for linear and affine\nterms . Since Boltzmann models support all kinds of\nunambiguous context-free languages, it is also possible to sample other\nfragments of minimal intuitionistic logic, for instance, using finite\ntruncations à la Takahashi et al. .\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: is to restrict the class of generated terms, using\npractically justifiable criteria, such as limiting their unary height, number\nof abstractions, or the maximal allowed De Bruijn index, see\ne.g.   [ref]5.
