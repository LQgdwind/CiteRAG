      "content": "Paper Title: Optimal Observation-Intervention Trade-Off in Optimisation Problems with Causal Structure\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis paper studies global optimisation of an expensive-to-evaluate grey-box  objective function with known causal structure in the form of a causal diagram (making it grey-box rather than ‘black-box’). In this setting, inputs to the objective function correspond to interventions and outputs correspond to causal effects. We assume that the objective function can be evaluated (possibly with noise) at a finite number of inputs, either by measurement or some estimation procedure. Each evaluation is associated with a cost and a finite budget of total evaluations is prescribed. Since no known functional form of the objective function is available, our goal is to find an input that optimises the objective function by estimating the causal effects of a sequence of interventions. This estimation can be done in two ways: i) by intervening and conducting controlled experiments; and ii) by passively observing and using the causal graph to estimate the causal effects (vis-à-vis the do-calculus ). In choosing between these two options, an observation-intervention trade-off emerges. On the one hand, interventions are costly but allow us to reliably estimate causal effects. On the other hand, observations are (usually) cheap to collect but may not always be sufficient to identify causal effects. We show that this trade-off can be formulated as an optimal stopping problem that permits an efficient solution  4 . Two principal algorithmic frameworks have been developed to solve optimisation problems of the type described above: i) causal Bayesian optimisation (cbo) algorithms [ref]2 [ref]3  , which assume that the objective function is defined over a continuous domain; and ii) causal multi-armed bandit (mab) algorithms [ref]31    , which assume that the objective function is defined over a discrete set of inputs. To our knowledge, no hybrid approach exists. Compared to standard Bayesian optimisation (bo) and mabs, which ignore the causal structure of the problem, cbo and causal mabs are able to exploit the causal structure to improve sample efficiency. A drawback of the existing causal approaches, however, is that they are myopic in the sense that they do not consider more than one step into the future when deciding on interventions. Another limitation is that the existing approaches rely on heuristics to balance the observation-intervention trade-off and do not quantify the cost of observing. Specifically, in the cbo setting, an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-greedy strategy is adopted by Aglietti et al. [ref]2 and a myopic exploration approach is adopted by Sussex et al.  and the trade-off is ignored in [ref]3 . In the causal mab setting, a heuristic approach is used by Lattimore et al. [ref]31 and the work in     uses myopic exploration approaches similar to Sussex et al. . Moreover, all of the approaches referenced above assume a) that an arbitrary number of observations can be collected; and b) that there are no costs associated with collecting observations. These assumptions are not realistic in many scenarios: to test for high cholesterol in the US, a blood-test (observation) is required which costs on average $51  and the requisite intervention (statins) costs $139 . Similarly, a prostate-specific antigen test to screen for prostate cancer (observation) costs on average $40  and the cost of a radical prostatectomy procedure (intervention) is on average $34,720  . Main contributions. Motivated by the above shortcomings in existing work, we present a general approach to extend existing cbo algorithms (the results are fully extendable to the causal mab setting) to balance the intervention-observation trade-off in an optimal and non-myopic way, while taking observation costs into account. From hereon, for brevity, we refer to our approach as Optimal Stopping for Causal Optimisation (osco). Our main contributions are: We formulate the observation-intervention trade-off as an optimal stopping problem whose solution determines whether a given intervention should be carried out or if it is more cost-effective to collect observational data. We prove that the solution to the optimal stopping problem can be computed efficiently and show that it can enhance existing cbo (and causal mab) algorithms. We characterise a set of variables called the minimal observation set (mos), which is the minimal set of variables that need to be observed to estimate the causal effect of an intervention.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: an efficient solution  4 .
