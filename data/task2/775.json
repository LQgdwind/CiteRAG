      "content": "Paper Title: Matching Guided Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClassification.\nFollowing the competitor [ref]11, student models are randomly initialized in tasks on CIFAR-100.\nWe use WideResNet (WRN) [ref]41 as the teacher, which is in the model setting of depth 28 and wide factor 4, indicated by s:28-4.\nThe student has multiple settings in different compression aspects: depth, wide factor, and architecture.\nResults comparison is shown in Table 1.\nWRN with s:16-4 has the same wide factor but smaller depth, so its channels are in same number of teacher’s at the same distillation positions.\nSince there is no need to reduce teacher channels, we only use MGD-SM to achieve the lowest error rate 20.53%percent20.5320.53\\%.\nWRN with s:28-2 has the same depth but a larger wide factor, thus teacher channels need to be reduced.\nThe results show that MGD-SM is better than [ref]11 with +0.76%percent0.76+0.76\\%, MGD-RD is a little worse with +0.23%percent0.23+0.23\\%, and MGD-AMP achieves the lowest error of 21.12%percent21.1221.12\\%.\nIn experiments with s:16-2, whose both depth and wide factor are smaller than those of teacher, MGD-SM & RD are worse than the competitor and MGD-AMP is competitive.\nAnother setting for student is using a different architecture, ResNet with s:56-2, which is deeper but with the same wide factor.\nMGD has the competitive results under this setting as well.\nThe Table 1 shows that MGD can handle various compression types for student. In large-scale classification on IN-1K, as shown in Table 3, we use ResNet-152 to distill ResNet-50.\nSince the channel number is identical in each stage of them, we only investigate MGD-SM.\nThe overall results from other works, except the Overhaul method, MGD beats other methods with maximum 1.45%percent1.451.45\\% improvement in top-1 accuracy.\nIn the case of distilling MobileNet-V1 by ResNet-50, using MGD-SM has similar result with [ref]11.\nMGD w/ AMP is the best overall methods. Transfer Learning.\nWe use fine-grained categorization on CUB-200 to investigate distillation for transfer learning.\nWe implement MGD and our competitor Overhaul for using ResNet-50 to distill light students.\nThe teacher ResNet-50 has been pre-trained on IN-1K and then trained on CUB-200.\nWe use two prevailed lightweight models, MobileNet-V2 and ShuffleNet-V2.\nConspicuously, they have fewer parameters than ResNet-50.\nThe main results have been shown in Table 3.\nWe have two baselines for each student: one is trained from scratch (Baseline-FS), and the other is fine-tuned (Baseline-FT) from IN-1K.\nWe summarize the experimental results in two folds. First, the results of two baselines show that transfer learning from a general data domain is helpful to the specific task.\nStudents pre-trained on IN-1K could bring ∼similar-to\\sim30%percent3030\\% accuracy improvements at least. Second, we adopt our three reduction methods of MGD to compare with Overhaul [ref]11.\nThe experimental phenomenon of two students are same.\nMGD-AMP beats the Overhaul with 1.05%percent1.051.05\\% improvement and also makes MobileNet-V2 almost have the similar performance with teacher.\nShuffleNet-V2 seems difficult to be distilled, there is a unignored gap with teacher.\nBut MGD-AMP stably performs best to help ShuffleNet-V2 achieve the maximum top-1 error decrease from 31.39%percent31.3931.39\\% to 25.95%percent25.9525.95\\%. No matter which reduction method we use to accomplish distillation for transfer learning, all the experimental results show that MGD is more friendly for distilling a pre-trained student. Object Detection & Instance Segmentation.\nTo verify the generalization of MGD, we extend it to object detection and instance segmentation.\nRetinaNet [ref]23 is a modern one-stage detector, which has excellent performance in both precision and speed.\nEmbedMask  is a novel framework for instance segmentation, which utilizes embedding strategy to generate instance masks on a unified one-stage structure.\nIn this section, we experiment with RetinaNet and EmbedMask respectively, using three different backbones: ResNet-50 as teacher, ResNet-18 and MobileNet-V2 as students.\nAll these backbones are pre-trained on IN-1K.\nWe train the models on COCO train2017 set and test them on val2017.\nBaselines are trained without distillation.\nAs comparison, we also train with [ref]11   under same configurations.\nThe main results are presented in Table 4.\nFor object detection, in both cases of distilling ResNet-18 and MobileNet-V2, MGD has stable improvements by 0.47−0.910.470.910.47-0.91 point.\nIn segmentation, in the case of ResNet-18, we freeze the first two backbone stages to avoid OOM.\nMGD can bring about 0.80.80.8 mAP point for ResNet-18 and 0.60.60.6 point for MobileNet-v2, it outperforms the competitor.\nThese results prove that MGD works more stable than previous works in object detection and instance segmentation.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: Classification.\nFollowing the competitor [ref]11, student models are randomly initialized in tasks on CIFAR-100.\nWe use WideResNet (WRN) [ref]41 as the teacher, which is in the model setting of depth 28 and wide factor 4, indicated by\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
