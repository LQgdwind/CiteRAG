      "content": "Paper Title: Practical Performative Policy Learning with Strategic Agents\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we build upon the literature on performative prediction and aim to operationalize the idea of taking the deployed model as the (functional) intervention imposed on data distribution, rather than the parameter of this model. To achieve this, we focus on settings with limited strategic behavior, where the complexity of the intervention is significantly reduced, making performative learning practical even for high-dimensional Œ∏\\theta. Our dimension reduction strategy further enables effective utilization of variation in the batch samples collected every round, since we choose to model the micro-level response of each agent. This contrasts with approaches that rely on a single bandit feedback per round of policy deployment, such as summarizing the observed data into a mean vector to estimate Œº‚Äã(Œ∏)\\mu(\\theta) in ùí©‚Äã(Œº‚Äã(Œ∏),œÉ2)\\mathcal{N}(\\mu(\\theta),\\sigma^{2}). We view performative learning as an extension of supervised learning rather than online learning and argue that methods relying on bandit feedback are highly inefficient in the performative learning context, particularly given the substantial costs associated with algorithm deployment. We adopt principal-agent terminology and study how the principal can efficiently learn a policy for treatment allocation while incentivizing strategic agents. Specifically, we consider a scenario where agents modify some of their features through genuine effort rather than deception. This implies that feature manipulation causally affects the agent‚Äôs outcome and represents an abundant class of strategic behavior. When a well-crafted policy is released, agents are motivated to respond by exerting effort to change certain features for better outcomes, such as through a background boost. In contrast, if the policy is poorly designed, it may inadvertently encourage some agents to manipulate their features in directions undesirable to the principal. Our study focuses on policy learning with binary treatment, as it represents a more general task targeting decision-making scenarios, compared to the binary classification task commonly studied in strategic classification and performative prediction. Another important motivation for this focus besides generality is that incentive-aware machine learning often involves interaction between deployed models and agents. These interactions are conducted by decisions rather than predictions, such as loan approval in loan applications or offers in college admissions‚Äîboth classic examples in related works. Furthermore, we clarify that fŒ∏f_{\\theta} refers to the prediction function, while œÄŒ∏\\pi_{\\theta} denotes the policy function throughout this paper. Nonetheless, both of them could serve as the intervention imposed on the data distribution. As an alternative to strong parametric assumptions on data distribution, we propose to leverage the inherent structure in the feature space. We consider splitting the feature x‚ààùí≥x\\in\\mathcal{X} into discrete manipulatable feature u‚ààùí∞u\\in\\mathcal{U} and fixed features v‚ààùí±v\\in\\mathcal{V}. For example, in a college admissions scenario, the college acts as the principal, while the applicants are the agents. Most demographic attributes, such as name, gender, age, and school, are challenging to manipulate or change, especially given an effective checking system. However, these attributes are essential for colleges to determine treatment. There are also a few features such as GRE and TOEFL grades that can still be boosted by the efforts of the applicant during the application year. The varying emphasis colleges place on these scores‚Äîconveyed through official statements or third-party platforms ‚Äîinfluences how applicants allocate their efforts, often depending on their fixed features. Motivated by this example, we further consider the scenario where dimùí∞‚â™dimùí±\\dim\\mathcal{U}\\ll\\dim\\mathcal{V} in this paper. This regime offers substantial benefits by significantly reducing the dimensionality of the complex intervention œÄŒ∏\\pi_{\\theta}. To summarize the impact of œÄŒ∏\\pi_{\\theta} on a specific agent with fixed features vv, it suffices to only consider the evaluation vector (œÄŒ∏‚Äã(u,v))u‚ààùí∞(\\pi_{\\theta}(u,v))_{u\\in\\mathcal{U}}. In many practical scenarios, uu can be viewed as a feature type with cardinality much smaller than the dimension of Œ∏\\theta. Consequently, shifting the focus from Œ∏\\theta to œÄŒ∏\\pi_{\\theta} as the intervention often facilitates considerable dimensionality reduction. This perspective, along with the resulting dimension reduction, is highly nontrivial, as it enables efficient learning under far more relaxed assumptions compared to existing works. To support gradient-based optimization for performative learning, we propose modeling the decision outcome directly, bypassing the agent‚Äôs decision process, which typically relies on a parametric micro-level mechanism, such as utility maximization. The decision outcome can be characterized as the distribution of the manipulatable feature u‚Ä≤u^{\\prime} reported by the agent, given the limited information about the decision function that would be used by this specific agent. Specifically, we choose to model p‚Äã(u‚Ä≤‚à£(œÄŒ∏‚Äã(u,v))u‚ààùí∞)p(u^{\\prime}\\mid(\\pi_{\\theta}(u,v))_{u\\in\\mathcal{U}}), which we refer to as the behavior model. We argue that the original feature, prior to manipulation, is not only difficult to acquire in practice but also unnecessary in our scenario‚Äîit can be treated as hidden heterogeneity. To delineate, this behavior model serves as a substitute for the true distribution map ùíü‚Äã(œÄŒ∏)\\mathcal{D}(\\pi_{\\theta}) and enables gradient-based optimization by providing an estimate of the gradient ‚àÇùíü‚Äã(œÄŒ∏)/‚àÇŒ∏\\partial\\mathcal{D}(\\pi_{\\theta})/\\partial\\theta. In practice, we find that both the neural network and Gaussian process classifier are qualified to serve as this behavior model. Moreover, based on this agent behavior model, we are no longer confined to the traditional scenario of deterministic manipulation, broadening its applicability to more nuanced micro-level settings such as private types  and random or noisy responses [ref]29. In addition, we establish the convergence guarantee for our gradient-based policy optimization algorithm through a novel approach: we rely on the realizability assumption in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), as opposed to the parametric assumption on distribution and finite difference method used in algorithm¬†, both of which becomes highly vulnerable when the dimensionality of data increases. Even though the true distribution map induced by best response mechanism often admits discontinuities¬†[ref]39 and the realizability assumption is violated therein, we demonstrate that our method still achieves stable convergence and exhibits excellent performance, in the simulation study. Contributions. Our contributions are summarized as follows. We investigate a novel and practical setting for performative policy learning, characterized by limited manipulation driven by bounded rationality, which captures a wide range of realistic scenarios. Our formulation relaxes traditional strong parametric assumptions while maintaining the feasibility of performative learning. We propose directly learning the agent‚Äôs decision outcomes, bypassing the decision-making process. This approach eliminates the need for parametric utility specifications while offering an effective differentiable substitute for the distribution map. We develop a gradient-based algorithm for performative policy optimization that scales efficiently with the dimensionality of both data distributions and policy parameters. Additionally, we establish a solid convergence guarantee through a novel approach. We conduct extensive and challenging experiments in synthetic and semi-synthetic settings with high-dimensional model and data to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method compared to classic baselines. These experiments further validate the significant performance improvements brought by our conceptual contributions.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: no longer confined to the traditional scenario of deterministic manipulation, broadening its applicability to more nuanced micro-level settings such as private types  and random or noisy responses [ref]29.
