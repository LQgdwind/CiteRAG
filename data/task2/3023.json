Results. \nFigures¬†4(b) and 4(c) show the experimental results.\nWe used the reward and the number of unsafe actions as evaluation metrics and calculated the mean and standard error after running each method 200200200 times.\nAs shown in Figure¬†4(b), our SPO-LF¬†exhibited comparable performance to the baselines with regard to the sample efficiency.\nHowever, our algorithm did not execute even a single unsafe action, while the other three methods optimized their policies while making mistakes.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: The second experiment was based on Safety-Gym [ref]25 with continuous state and action spaces.\nThe objective of this experiment was to compare our SPO-LF¬† with several notable safe RL algorithms including CPO [ref]2, PPO-Lagrangian, and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
