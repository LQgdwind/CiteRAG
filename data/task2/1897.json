      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable and Adaptive Graph Neural Networks with Self-Label-Enhanced Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCommon Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have state-of-the-art performances on graph related tasks [ref]1 [ref]2    [ref]6      . To scale them to large scaled graphs, neighbor sampling methods         have been proposed. In another way, the scalable GNNs    can more easily scale to large scaled graphs with better simplicity and runtime. These methods decouple graph convolutions and learnable transformations into preprocessing and a scalable classifier. They allow standard and efficient mini-batch training since the input is Euclidean. But non-learnable graph convolutions in preprocessing potentially limit expressiveness. Thus a complex and graph structure-aware classifier is required to achieve comparable performance. The self-training approach    and label propagation    0 1 have been exploited on common GNNs for semi-supervised learning tasks. But there is a lack of research on incorporating these techniques into scalable GNNs, which may bring better performance in addition to simplicity and efficiency. The self-training approach can be easily applied to scalable GNNs. To incorporate label information while avoiding a trivial solution, the inner random masking within the training set 1 2 is required for each epoch. However, for scalable GNNs, the associated label propagation for each epoch will cost much runtime. Moreover, the combination of self-training and label propagation has not been adequately discussed. By designing a more expressive classifier, we propose Scalable and Adaptive Graph neural Networks (SAGN). SAGN inherits inception-like module from SIGN and incorporates learnable attention weights between multiple hops 3. The attention mechanism improves performance and interpretability.\nBy effectively combining self-training and label propagation for scalable GNNs, we propose the Self-Label-Enhanced (SLE) training approach. Firstly, to incorporate label information, we propose a scalable label model compatible with any scalable base model whose input is the propagated label embedding. We find that empirically the label leakage is effectively reduced with enough propagation number. Secondly, following the self-training approach, we split the training process into stages with enhancing the training set. Thirdly, the hard pseudo labels in self-training participate in label propagation at each stage.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Common Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have state-of-the-art performances on graph related tasks [ref]1 [ref]2    [ref]6      .
