      "content": "Paper Title: Syntax and Domain Aware Model for Unsupervised Program Translation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProgramming language is the main tool for creating desktop applications, websites, and mobile applications.\nTo develop different applications, many different programming languages have been invented over the years. The diverse programming languages can facilitate developers to build various applications of multiple environments and platforms.\nTo meet new business needs and environments, one software initially developed in a language needs to migrate to other languages  . Code migration is a crucial activity during software development and maintenance [ref]8. There is a tremendous need for translating programs between different programming languages. Early studies mainly relied on handcrafted translation rules to translate between two languages. The translation is poor in readability and correctness, and needs extra manual corrections. Therefore, the translation process is error-prone and time-consuming [ref]43.\nFor example, it takes about 5 years and $750 million for Australia Commonwealth Bank to convert the platform from COBOL to Java [ref]21.\nTo improve the quality and efficiency, researchers began to explore the automatic approaches to build a program translator   [ref]8 [ref]21. Based on the naturalness theory of programming languages, i.e., source code is repetitive and predictable, statistical machine learning methods have been used for modeling programs and code migration. Some previous work borrowed the idea from the natural language translation field and applied statistical machine translation (SMT) approaches  for code migration  . Among these studies, researchers build statistical models and optimize the parameters by analyzing the statistical relationships between bilingual data. Then they employ these statistical models to generate translations. With the development of deep learning technologies, in recent years, researchers have started to tackle program translation task using supervised sequence-to-sequence neural machine translation (NMT) methods , which need a large amount of parallel code resources to train. However, parallel resources are much more scarce in the programming language domain than in natural language.\nIt is costly to collect bilingual program data manually. Therefore, applying the NMT technology to code translation still faces many challenges. To ease this issue, unsupervised machine translation techniques are proposed for programming translation [ref]21 . TransCoder [ref]21 first applied unsupervised machine translation approaches for program translation task, leveraging huge monolingual programs from GitHub to train their model, covering C++, Java, and Python languages. Then they adopted the model to translate between C++, Java, and Python. However, the model still needs to be pre-trained using a large amount of monolingual code corpus, which is very expensive. Besides, it cannot fit well for the languages that are not seen during the pre-training procedure according to our experimental results. Cross-lingual transfer can reduce the demand for labeled data to perform corresponding tasks in a new language and thus can support applications in low-resource languages . We argue that facilitating cross-lingual transfer is an effective way to improve data utilization and save computing resources, which can benefit program translation systems.\nTransferring across programming languages is challenging due to the differences in morphology, syntax, and semantics.\nFor instance, the IF statements in Python and Java in Figure 1 have the same meaning but with different token orders.\nUnlike natural languages, programs have explicit syntax structure and rigorous grammar. The correlation between syntax structure is much closer, which can help to reduce the morphological differences across languages and extract language-invariant features. As seen from Figure 1, the sub-trees corresponding to x>y𝑥𝑦x\\textgreater y (highlighted in the figure) in the two ASTs have the same structure. Besides, the distance between node pairs can indicate the structural correlation between tokens, and further reflects specific patterns of code snippets. However, the syntax structure is not fully leveraged in existing program translation models [ref]21 .\nBesides, these models are pre-trained with several self-supervised tasks on specific code corpus. Thus, they are poor at distinguishing the characteristic of different languages and domains when transferring knowledge.\nTo this end, we proposed SDA-Trans, a Syntax and Domain-Aware model for program Translation. Specifically, we augment Transformer model with language syntax by incorporating the structured representations of the program into the self-attention mechanism. Besides, we design a new domain-distinguish pre-training task to extract domain-invariant features111The definition of the domain-invariant features can be found in Section III-A.. This task asks the model to distinguish which domain/language the model is translated from, and learn the task via adversarial training. This task will encourage the model to distill domain-invariant syntactic and semantic features.\nInspired by unsupervised machine translation approaches  [ref]21, we train SDA-Trans with the following steps: (1) Initializing parameters of the vanilla Transformer with Cross Programming Masked Language Model and Denoising Auto-Encoding tasks; (2) Augmenting the model with syntax information, and add domain-distinguish pre-training task to make our model domain-aware by adversarial training; (3) Tuning SDA-Trans with back-translation. Since SDA-Trans is designed to extract the syntax structure and domain-invariant features during pre-training, we hope it can learn enough knowledge from limited data, which can, in turn, save computing resources. We train our model on a smaller scale of Python and Java monolingual code corpus (which contains 165k Java methods and 251k Python methods) compared with existing large-scale pre-trained models. We evaluate SDA-Trans on program translation between Java, Python, and C++, where C++ language is never seen during pre-training. Experimental results show that SDA-Trans achieves a remarkable gain compared with the large-scale pre-trained unsupervised program translation methods.\nThe ablation study further shows that both syntax and domain augmentation contribute to the improvement.\nWe summarize the contributions of this paper as follows: We build a novel approach SDA-Trans for unsupervised program translation, which leverages the syntax structure and domain knowledge to enhance the model’s cross-lingual transfer ability. We present a new unsupervised training paradigm using a three-stage strategy: (1) initializing the model with CMLM and DAE objectives; (2) continuously training with syntax and domain augmentation; and (3) tuning with back-translation. Despite pre-trained with fewer data, SDA-Trans achieves impressive performance on program translation, which is comparable with the large-scale pre-trained models, especially on unseen language translation.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: needs and environments, one software initially developed in a language needs to migrate to other languages  .
