      "content": "Paper Title: Component twin-width as a parameter for BINARY-CSP and its semiring generalisations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now generalize the notion of graph contraction defined by Bonnet et al. [ref]14 to edge-labelled graphs, and define the key notions of contraction sequences and component twin-width.\nWe first define a suitable notion of vertex merging in an edge-labelled graph. Let H=(VH,lH,XH)𝐻subscript𝑉𝐻subscript𝑙𝐻subscript𝑋𝐻H=(V_{H},l_{H},X_{H}) be an edge-labelled graph, and let 𝕊𝕊\\mathbb{S} be a proper partition of VHsubscript𝑉𝐻V_{H}.\nThe contraction of H𝐻H relative to 𝕊𝕊\\mathbb{S} is the edge-labelled graph H𝕊=(VH𝕊,lH𝕊,XH𝕊)subscript𝐻𝕊subscript𝑉subscript𝐻𝕊subscript𝑙subscript𝐻𝕊subscript𝑋subscript𝐻𝕊H_{\\mathbb{S}}=(V_{H_{\\mathbb{S}}},l_{H_{\\mathbb{S}}},X_{H_{\\mathbb{S}}}) with VH𝕊=𝕊subscript𝑉subscript𝐻𝕊𝕊V_{H_{\\mathbb{S}}}=\\mathbb{S}, XH𝕊=XH∪{e}subscript𝑋subscript𝐻𝕊subscript𝑋𝐻eX_{H_{\\mathbb{S}}}=X_{H}\\cup\\{{\\color[rgb]{1,0,0}\\textbf{e}}\\} and for all (S1,S2)∈𝕊2subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2superscript𝕊2(S_{1},S_{2})\\in\\mathbb{S}^{2}, if there exists x∈XH𝑥subscript𝑋𝐻x\\in X_{H} such that ∀(u,v)∈S1×S2for-all𝑢𝑣subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2\\forall(u,v)\\in S_{1}\\times S_{2}, lG​(u,v)=xsubscript𝑙𝐺𝑢𝑣𝑥l_{G}(u,v)=x, then lH𝕊​(S1,S2)=xsubscript𝑙subscript𝐻𝕊subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2𝑥l_{H_{\\mathbb{S}}}(S_{1},S_{2})=x, and lH​(S1,S2)=esubscript𝑙𝐻subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2el_{H}(S_{1},S_{2})={\\color[rgb]{1,0,0}\\textbf{e}} otherwise. If we view a graph as an edge-labelled graph whose edges are labelled by 111, and every other pair of vertices is labelled by 00, this notion coincides with the notion of (iterated) contraction(s) defined by Bonnet et al. [ref]14 for graphs, up to identifying the set of red edges (defined in [ref]14) with the set of pairs of 𝕊𝕊\\mathbb{S} labelled with e.\nWith a slight abuse of notation, we see a proper partition 𝕊1subscript𝕊1\\mathbb{S}_{1} of a proper partition 𝕊2subscript𝕊2\\mathbb{S}_{2} of a set V𝑉V as a proper partition of V𝑉V, by seeing any set S∈𝒫​(𝒫​(V))𝑆𝒫𝒫𝑉S\\in\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{P}(V)) of 𝕊1subscript𝕊1\\mathbb{S}_{1} as ∪S∈𝒫​(V)𝑆𝒫𝑉\\cup S\\in\\mathcal{P}(V). Under this viewpoint, the proper partition 𝕊1subscript𝕊1\\mathbb{S}_{1} of V𝑉V respects the proper partition 𝕊2subscript𝕊2\\mathbb{S}_{2} of V𝑉V, and the contraction relation is then transitive. This naturally leads to the following definition of a contraction sequence. Let H𝐻H be an e-free edge-labelled graph on n≥1𝑛1n\\geq 1 vertices.\nThen, a contraction sequence of H𝐻H is a sequence of edge-labelled graph (Hn,…,H1)subscript𝐻𝑛…subscript𝐻1(H_{n},\\dots,H_{1}) such that Hn=Hsubscript𝐻𝑛𝐻H_{n}=H, and for all k∈[n−1]𝑘delimited-[]𝑛1k\\in[n-1], Hksubscript𝐻𝑘H_{k} is a contraction of Hk+1subscript𝐻𝑘1H_{k+1} with |VHk|=ksubscript𝑉subscript𝐻𝑘𝑘|V_{H_{k}}|=k. In particular, H1subscript𝐻1H_{1} is an edge-labelled graph with 1 vertex, and VH1={VH}subscript𝑉subscript𝐻1subscript𝑉𝐻V_{H_{1}}=\\{V_{H}\\}.\nAgain, one may notice that the notion of contraction sequence of edge-labelled graph coincides with the particular case of binary loopless non-oriented graphs defined in [ref]14. Let H𝐻H be an edge-labelled graph. Define the e-connected components of H𝐻H as the connected components of the unoriented graph H​(e)=(VH,{(u,v)∈(VH)2∣e∈{lH​(u,v),lH​(v,u)}})𝐻esubscript𝑉𝐻conditional-set𝑢𝑣superscriptsubscript𝑉𝐻2esubscript𝑙𝐻𝑢𝑣subscript𝑙𝐻𝑣𝑢H({\\color[rgb]{1,0,0}\\textbf{e}})=(V_{H},\\{(u,v)\\in(V_{H})^{2}\\mid{\\color[rgb]{1,0,0}\\textbf{e}}\\in\\{l_{H}(u,v),l_{H}(v,u)\\}\\}). The edges of H​(e)𝐻eH({\\color[rgb]{1,0,0}\\textbf{e}}) encode a loss of information in the contraction, and are intended to play the role of the red edges of contraction sequences defined in [ref]14.\nWe can now introduce the notion of component (twin-)width of a contraction sequence Let H𝐻H be an e-free edge-labelled graph on n≥1𝑛1n\\geq 1 vertices. Let (Hn,…,H1)subscript𝐻𝑛…subscript𝐻1(H_{n},\\dots,H_{1}) be a contraction sequence of H𝐻H. The component-width of this contraction sequence is denoted by c​t​w​((Hn,…​H1))𝑐𝑡𝑤subscript𝐻𝑛…subscript𝐻1ctw((H_{n},\\dots H_{1})) and is the maximal size of the e-connected component of the graphs Hn−1,…,H1subscript𝐻𝑛1…subscript𝐻1H_{n-1},\\dots,H_{1}. The component twin-width of H𝐻H is denoted by c​t​w​w​(H)𝑐𝑡𝑤𝑤𝐻ctww(H), and it is the minimal component-width of all its contraction sequences. Any contraction sequence of H𝐻H whose component-width equals the component twin-width of H𝐻H is called an optimal contraction sequence of H𝐻H. Note that the graphs of component twin-width 111 are exactly the cographs, and that cycles of length ≥5absent5\\geq 5 have component twin-width 333.\nIn order to extend the notion of component twin-width to BINARY-CSP(Γ)Γ(\\Gamma) compatible with the reduction involved in Theorem 4, we define the component twin-width of the template ΓΓ\\Gamma as the component twin-width of H​(Γ)𝐻ΓH(\\Gamma), and the instance ℐℐ\\mathcal{I} as the component twin-width of G​(ℐ)𝐺ℐG(\\mathcal{I}).\nNote that while the primary focus of [ref]14 was simply the twin-width (the minimum over all contraction sequences of the maximal e-degree of the graphs that appear in the contraction sequence), the latter seems a less useful parameter for BINARY-CSP(Γ)Γ(\\Gamma). Intuitively, one could argue that component twin-width is a more “natural” parameter to consider, but that improved algorithms using twin-width are sometimes feasible. For instance, Bonnet et al. [ref]9 solves k𝑘k-IND-SET problem in FPT when parameterized by twin-width, by bounding the number of red-connected subgraphs by a function depending only on k𝑘k and d𝑑d, where d𝑑d is the twin-width of the input graph. This trick transforms an algorithm parameterized by component twin-width into an algorithm parameterized by twin-width. Unfortunately, it does not seem applicable here. Note also that to generalize algorithm of Bonnet et al. [ref]9 to IND-SET, we have to give up the parameterization by twin-width and instead consider component twin-width.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: We now generalize the notion of graph contraction defined by Bonnet et al. [ref]14 to edge-labelled graphs, and define the key notions of contraction sequences and component twin-width.\nWe first define a suitable notion of vertex merging in an edge-labelled graph.
