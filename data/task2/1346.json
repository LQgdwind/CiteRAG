Is the cost for computing gradient reduced by using the BDD-based approach (Algorithm 5) ?\nRQ2. What is the advantages and limitations of GradSAT on randomly generated hybrid Boolean formulas? \nRQ3. Can GradSAT perform well in solving discrete optimization problems, encoded by MaxSAT? \nRQ4. Can MRBDD with nodes sharing significantly reduce the total number of nodes? Solver Competitors.\n1) CDCL solvers including Glucose, cryptoMiniSAT (CMS) and ML-enhanced solver MapleSAT;\n2) DLS solvers, including WalkSATlm , CCAnr and ProbSAT;\n3) PB solvers including CDCL-based MiniSAT+ , Open-WBO , NAPS  and Conflict-Driven-Pseudo-Boolean-Search-based (CDPB) solver RoundingSAT ;\n4) Partial MaxSAT solvers, including Loandra , the best solver of MaxSAT Competition 2019 (incomplete track), WalkSAT (v56) and Mixing Method , an SDP-based solver. Benchmark 1: Hybrid random formulas consisting of disjunctive clauses, XORs, CARDs and PBs. We generate four types of satisfiable random hybrid benchmarks: CNF-XORs (360 instances), XORs-1CARD (270 instances), CARDs (360 instances) and PBs (720 instances) with variable number n‚àà{50,100,150}ùëõ50100150n\\in\\{50,100,150\\} 444A detailed description of benchmarks generation can be found in the supplemental material.. When a type of constraint is not accepted by a traditional CNF solver, we use CNF encodings to resolve the issue. Specifically, we let pySAT  choose the CNF encoding for CARDs and PBs, while using the methods in  to encode XORs. Time limit is set to be 100s. Benchmark 2: MaxSAT problems. We gathered 570 instances from the crafted (198 instances) and random track (377 instances) of MaxSAT Competition 2016-2019. Those instances encode random problems as well as combinatorial problems such as set covering and MaxCut. We set the time limit to 60s. We also used problems from the incomplete track of MaxSAT Competition 2019 as the industrial benchmarks (296 instances). Implementation of GradSAT. We implement GradSAT in C++, with code available in the supplemental material. Each experiment is run on an exclusive node in a Linux cluster with 16-processor cores at 2.63 GHz and 1 GB of RAM per processor. We generated five versions of GradSAT, including using single-core on each of the four optimizers (SLSQP, MMA, CG, BFGS) and using 161616 cores on the optimizer portfolio, with each optimizer getting 444 cores.\n RQ1. Table 2 lists the running time for computing gradient on several instances. Each running time is the average on 100 random points in [‚àí1,1]nsuperscript11ùëõ[-1,1]^{n}. The results indicate that\nGradSAT significantly accelerates the computation of gradient compared with FourierSAT. RQ2. We classify the four types of benchmarks in Benchmark 1 into two groups: 1) PBs and CARDs; 2) XORs-1CARD and CNF-XORs; because solvers have similar performance on instances from the same group. We summarize the results in Figure 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows the results on CARDs and PBs instances. Though CDPB-based solver RoundingSAT easily solves all instances, GradSAT on 16 cores is able to solve 732 instances, more than all other CDCL, DLS SAT solvers and CDCL-based PB solvers. From Figure 2, we observe that on benchmarks involving XORs, CDCL solvers, especially CMS, perform better than local-search solvers. GradSAT on 16 cores solves 155 instances, only second to CCAnr (191) among all local search solvers. We conjecture that the solution space shattering [ref]63  brought by XORs might be the reason for the weakness of local search solvers in handling XORs. RQ3. Table 4 showcases the results on MaxSAT benchmarks. We use the incomplete score  and the number of instances where a solver provides the solution with the best cost (#Win) as the metric for evaluation. All five versions of GradSAT achieve better average score and #Win than other solvers. Moreover, GradSAT improves the score of Virtual Best Solver (VBS) with 0.01 and #Win with 321. We also try GradSAT on large-size instances from the industrial MaxSAT problems, which contain both hard and soft clauses. But GradSAT is not able to give an answer for about 2/3232/3 of all instances. On instances which GradSAT successfully solves, an average score of 0.82 is achieved. We conjecture two reasons for the unsatisfactory performance of GradSAT on industrial benchmarks as follows. First, GradSAT sets the weight of hard clauses to be (#soft clauses + 1). It has been shown  that this natural weighting performs poorly without exploiting the structure of partial MaxSAT problems. Second, industrial benchmarks contain a large number of variables, which also the non-stochastic DLS solver, e.g., GSAT, could hardly handle. Thus it is not surprising that GradSAT, as a proof-of-concept implementation demonstrating how to calculate the full gradients simultaneously, is less competitive. We leave handling industrial partial MaxSAT problems by CLS approaches as a future direction. RQ4. Table 3 shows the total number of nodes of individual BDDs and the number of nodes of MRBDD for each type of benchmarks In order to allow more nodes sharing, we use the same variable order for all individual BDDS, corresponding to the original variable indices. We leave planning and applying a better variable order as a future direction. For all tracks of MaxSAT instances in CNF format, using MRBDD significantly reduced the number of nodes, yielding a average reduction ratio from 2.29 to 3.22. However, on non-CNF hybrid SAT instances, nodes sharing in MRBDD is negligible, probably due to relatively large constraint length.\n\nReference markers found: [63]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]63: CMS, perform better than local-search solvers. GradSAT on 16 cores solves 155 instances, only second to CCAnr (191) among all local search solvers.
