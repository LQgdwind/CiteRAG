      "content": "Paper Title: Latent Exploration for Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExploration based on the learned policy. In on-policy RL, the target policy must be stochastic, so that the experience collected includes enough variability for the agent to discover policy improvements. Algorithms such as A3C , PPO , and TRPO 1 parametrize each action component with an independent Gaussian distribution (continuous actions) or a categorical distribution (discrete actions). In off-policy RL, most exploration strategies are based on perturbations of the policy. For example, in discrete action spaces an exploratory policy can be derived from the target policy by adding ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-greedy exploration, or more sophisticated perturbations such as the upper confidence bound 2 3, Thompson sampling 4, Boltzmann exploration 5 and Information-Directed\nSampling (IDS) 6. In continuous action space, the perturbation of the actions is provided by independent random noise, with (e.g., SAC [ref]5) or without (e.g., DDPG ) learned noise parameters.\nUnstructured exploration has several drawbacks , which have been tackled by ensuring a temporally coherent noise through colored noise 1, an auto-regressive process 7 or a Markov chain 8. Another strategy to induce time correlation consists in keeping the perturbation parameters constant for multiple steps. This concept has been applied to perturbations of the network parameters 9 and to state-dependent action perturbations  0  . While these exploration strategies provide smoother noise in time, Lattice aims to pair time-correlated state-dependent exploration with correlation in the action space. Other exploration strategies.\nIn on-policy RL, count-based exploration , curiosity-driven exploration  and random network distillation  are techniques to encourage visiting rare states. In off-policy RL, bootstrapped DQN  employs multiple Q-networks to guide exploration and improve performance. Additionally, unsupervised methods like Diversity Is All You Need  can achieve more diverse exploration by maximizing mutual information between a goal-conditioned policy and a set of skill labels.\nStarting to explore only after returning to a recently visited state allows to solve complex sequential-decision problem . Lattice does not aim to replace curriculum learning   0 5 or exploratory policies, but proposes exploring implicitly via the policy network in a monolithic way and can be combined with other approaches. Exploration in over-actuated system.\nOveractuated systems, such as musculoskeletal systems, pose a challenge for exploration.\nRecent NeurIPS challenges have addressed the problem of learning control policies for locomotion and dexterous hand movements with musculoskeletal models 1 4 5. The winners in these challenges have typically utilized complex training curricula, such as static-to-dynamic stabilization in the Baoding task, where a hand needs to accurately rotate two balls 5, or feature engineering and expert demonstration for locomotion 1. Exploration can also be encouraged by learning a muscle-coordination network 2 or the state-dependent joint torque limits and energy function 3. Similarly, Schumacher et al. proposed a self-organizing controller that outperforms previous approaches by inducing state-space covering exploration 9. Integrating exploratory policies into a RL framework requires ad-hoc solutions, whereas Lattice can be trained end-to-end with both on-policy and off-policy algorithms.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: sampling 4, Boltzmann exploration 5 and Information-Directed\nSampling (IDS) 6.
