      "content": "Paper Title: SCONNA: A Stochastic Computing Based Optical Accelerator for Ultra-Fast, Energy-Efficient Inference of Integer-Quantized CNNs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized the implementation of various artificial intelligence tasks, such as image recognition, language translation, autonomous driving  , due to their high inference accuracy. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specific types of DNNs . CNNs are computationally intensive, and hence, require a long inference time. In CNNs, around 80% of the total processing time is taken by convolution operations that can be decomposed into vector dot product (VDP) operations . The ever-increasing complexity of CNNs has pushed for highly customized CNN hardware accelerators . Often, for efficient and swift hardware-based acceleration, CNNs are typically quantized to have integer input/weight parameters . Among CNN hardware accelerators, silicon-photonic accelerators have shown great promise to provide unparalleled parallelism, ultra-low latency, and high energy efficiency  [ref]8  0 1 2. Typically, a silicon-photonic CNN accelerator consists of multiple Vector Dot Product Cores (VDPCs) that perform multiple VDP operations in parallel. Several VDPC-based optical CNN accelerators have been proposed in prior works based on various silicon-photonic devices, such as Mach Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) (e.g., 3, 4, 5) and Microring Resonator (MRR) (e.g., , 2, 6, 7). Among these optical VDPC-based CNN accelerators from prior work, the MRR-enabled VDPC-based accelerators (e.g.,   [ref]8 8 2 7) have shown disruptive performance and energy efficiencies, due to the MRRsâ€™ compact footprint, low dynamic power consumption, and compatibility with cascaded dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing (DWDM). Among these MRR-enabled accelerators, some accelerators utilize digital VDPCs (e.g., 8), whereas some others employ analog VDPCs (e.g., 2  7). In general, a VDPC (analog or digital) transforms convolution operations into vector dot product (VDP) operations by decomposing the input tensors into vectors (1D tensors). In an analog VDPC, such VDP operations are also analog in nature, and they are performed on the individual VDP elements (VDPEs), which are the main MRR-enabled hardware components in the VDPCs. Multiple VDPEs in an analog VDPC can perform multiple analog VDP operations in parallel. The results of these analog VDP operations are converted into the digital format using analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). These results can be summed together (if and when needed) using a partial-sum (psum) reduction network, which can be employed outside of the VDPCs as part of the post-processing components of the CNN accelerator. The functioning of the analog VDPCs and their constituent VDPEs in the ultra-high-speed, analog-optical domain results in disruptive throughput for performing analog VDP operations. We observe that two factors govern the performance of such analog optical VDPCs: (1) the achievable bit-precision (B) and (2) the achievable scalability of the VDPCs, i.e., the achievable count of the individual VDPEs per VDPC (M) and the individual VDPE size (the number of multiplications that can be generated and summed up per VDPE) (N). In an analog VDPC, the achievable B affects the inference accuracy of the processed CNNs, whereas the achievable VDPC scalability (i.e., N and M) directly defines the throughput of the VDPC for processing CNNs. Prior works 9 and 0 studied various factors such as optical power budget in waveguides, inter-channel spacing of wavelengths, crosstalk at cascaded MRRs, resolution of ADCs, and photodetector responsivity, to determine the bounds of the achievable B and scalability in analog optical VDPCs. Furthermore, prior work 1 characterized the very strong trade-off between the maximum achievable VDPC size N and B in analog optical VDPCs. From 1, the analog optical VDPCs from prior works cannot support N greater than 44 for B>=>=4-bit 1. Achieving such low N can seriously hurt the performance for processing modern CNNs. This is because modern CNNs employ tensors with as high as 4608 points (parameters) per tensor 2. Processing such large tensors on a VDPC with Nâ‰¤\\leq44 results in a large number of psums, resulting in a very high latency overhead in the psum reduction network. To avoid this undesired outcome, we advocate for such an architecture of MRRs-based CNN accelerator that achieves significantly larger VDPC size N along with weakened interdependence between N and B. To that end, for the first time, we leveraged the inherent precision flexibility of stochastic computing to come up with a novel, MMRs-enabled Stochastic Computing based Optical Neural Network Accelerator (SCONNA). SCONNA employs our invented MRR-based Optical Stochastic Multipliers (OSMs) to realize manifold improvements in the throughput and energy efficiency of processing integer-quantized CNNs. Our key contributions in this paper are summarized below: To enable stochastic computing in the optical domain, we present (i) a novel design of optical stochastic multiplier (OSM), and (ii) a novel photo-charge accumulator (PCA) circuit (Section IV); We present detailed modeling and characterization of our invented OSM and PCA using foundry-validated, commercial-grade, photonic-electronic design automation tools (Section IV); We employ our designed OSMs and PCAs to forge a highly scalable CNN accelerator named SCONNA, which employs OSM and PCA-based scalable VDPCs (Section IV); We perform a comprehensive scalability analysis for our SCONNA VDPCs, to determine their achievable maximum size N, operating speed, and error susceptibility (Section V); We implement and evaluate SCONNA at the system-level using our in-house simulator (https://github.com/uky-UCAT/SC_ONN_SIM.git), and compare its performance and inference accuracy for processing 8-bit integer-quantized CNNs with two widely-known MRR-based analog CNN accelerators from prior works (Section VI).\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: input/weight parameters .
