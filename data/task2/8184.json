      "content": "Paper Title: STanH : Parametric Quantization for Variable Rate Learned Image Compression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlmost all of the above approaches to quantization entail the same drawback, i.e., a different encoder-decoder model must be trained for each rate.\nSeveral proposals have been made towards variable rate learned image compression, and here we review some.\n\nIn¬†, the latent representation of a single autoencoder is scaled before quantization by adding a learnable scaling parameter, one for each channel; this allows adaptation of the latent space based on the required bitrate.\nHowever, using a single value for each channel to adapt the quality level may lead to a reduction in R-D performance.\n\nIn¬†[ref]33, they proposed an autoencoder that is conditioned on the Lagrangian multiplier ŒªùúÜ\\lambda, that is not treated as a regular hyper-parameter as usual but is instead used as input to the network to produce specific latent representations.\nAdditionally, the network was trained using mixed quantization bin sizes, enabling it to adapt the rate by adjusting the bin size of the quantization applied to the latent representation.\nThis model increases the complexity of the optimization since it introduces both ŒªùúÜ\\lambda and the bin size as inputs to determine the target bitrates.\n\nAnother approach is to deploy a model that considers different resolutions at the same time in the same training phase, making it adaptable to different RD trade-offs: ¬†presented a problem of optimizing variable RD, which involves adding a modulated framework to the deep image compression structure. This framework enables the structure to adapt to various levels of compression.\nIn¬†[ref]35, the autoencoder is trained to break down the input image into multiple levels of representations, aiming to optimize the rate-distortion performance across all scales.\nHowever, both¬†[ref]35 and¬† made the training phase more complicated and unstable.\n\nIn [ref]36, a pair of parametric gain units are inserted before and after the quantization step to achieve discrete rate adaptation with one single model; by using exponential interpolation, continuous rate adaptation is achieved without compromising performance. In particular, for each target level, there is a specific pair of gain units multiplying the latent representation element-wise before and after quantization.\nHowever, Beyond gain units, [ref]36¬†modifies the entropy model, passing from symmetric to asymmetric Gaussian distribution, which makes it complex to assess the benefits of gain units in isolation.\n\nFollowing a different approach, In¬†, they introduced a 3D importance map to achieve essential representations for compression at various quality levels, encoding thus only a partial version of the latent representation based on the desired quality level. Furthermore they exploited quality adapter quantization by multiplying the latent representation by a quantization vector, similarly to [ref]36.\nDespite effectiveness,  does require learning the importance map, which involves training thousands of parameters.\nSimilarly to [ref]36,  embeds a set of quality scaling factors (SFs) into a model, by which they can encode images across an entire bitrate range with a single model; however, this approach shares the same limitations of [ref]36.\nIn , a ‚Äúper image‚Äù optimal representation is obtained by applying SGD to the latent space and determining the quantization step using grid-search. This approach is limited by the need for optimization when coding every single image, making it unfeasible in most use cases that impose constraints on computational costs or real-time capacity.\n\nIn , they exploited mask parameter decay, adjustable quantization step, and knowledge distillation to train a smaller model from a teacher model; variable bit-rate is obtained using adjustable quantization steps.\nA large model is pruned using learnable mask decay layers.\nHowever, this method relies on a multi-stage training phase that is more complex than ours, and it is not agnostic with respect to the architecture, jeopardizing the possibility to add this technique in a general image compression model.\n\nIn general, the problem of adapting a single model to different rates has received less attention as more efforts have been focused on improving compression performance. Nonetheless, the ability to efficiently switch among different rates is a fundamental requirement for practical image coding.\nIn the following, we introduce STanH‚Äâ, our learnable quantization scheme that we exploit towards variable rate image compression.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: this allows adaptation of the latent space based on the required bitrate.\nHowever, using a single value for each channel to adapt the quality level may lead to a reduction in R-D performance.\n\nIn¬†[ref]33, they proposed an autoencoder that is conditioned on the Lagrangian multiplier ŒªùúÜ\\lambda, that is not treated as a regular hyper-parameter as usual but is instead used as input to the network\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
