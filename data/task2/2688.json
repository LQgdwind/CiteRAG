      "content": "Paper Title: DeepMetis: Augmenting a Deep Learning Test Set to Increase its Mutation Score\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Learning (DL) based software is widespread and has been successfully applied to complex tasks such as image processing and speech recognition. Systems including DL components are also employed in safety and business-critical domains, e.g. autonomous driving and financial trading.\nDL systems possess the human-like ability to learn how to perform a task from experience, i.e., the inputs seen during training , but such ability comes with the possibility to make errors when presented with new inputs. Therefore, it is crucial for DL software developers and manufacturers to assess to what extent these systems can be trusted in response to real-world inputs, as they could face scenarios that might be not sufficiently represented in the data from which they have learned. Traditional test adequacy criteria, like code coverage, fail to determine whether DL systems are adequately exercised by a test set since most of the DL systems’ behaviour depends on their training data, not the code. Recent research defined ad-hoc white-box adequacy metrics, based on DL software’s internal architecture, e.g., neuron  [ref]3 [ref]4  or surprise coverage [ref]6. A limitation of these approaches is that their output cannot be directly associated with a root cause of a DL system’s failure, i.e., a DL fault . On the other hand, mutation testing approaches evaluate a test set against faults that are artificially injected into the system under test. So, the inability of a test set to expose injected faults (kill mutants in the mutation testing jargon) can be interpreted as its inability to properly exercise the mutated code . The tool DeepCrime generates mutants of DL systems by injecting artificial faults that resemble those described in the taxonomy of real DL faults by Humbatova et al. . In this way, it addresses the challenge of simulating real-world DL faults 0. Hence, a DL test set that cannot kill a mutant generated by DeepCrime is also unlikely to expose any real fault similar to the one injected by DeepCrime, in case such a fault affected the DL system under test. In such a situation, the test set should be augmented with additional tests that target the undetected fault. In this paper, we introduce a novel and automated way to augment existing test sets with inputs that kill mutants generated by DeepCrime. Our goal is to increase the mutation score of a test set by generating new inputs that kill the mutants not killed by the original test set. To this aim, we propose DeepMetis, a search-based test generator for DL systems that uses mutation adequacy as guidance.\nIntuitively, a mutant is killed if the correct behaviour is observed for a DL model under test, while a misbehaviour is observed on its mutated version.\nHowever, mutation testing approaches should take into account the stochastic nature of DL (in particular, of its training process) and of mutation generation (some DL mutations are non-deterministic) to properly measure the test set’s ability to discriminate the original system from the artificially generated faulty versions 1.\nIn fact, observing a drop in accuracy between the original and the mutated model is not enough to conclude that the mutant is killed since such a drop might be due to random fluctuations of accuracy associated with the non-determinism of the training and the mutation process. The mutation killing criterion proposed by Jahangirova and Tonella 2 addresses this DL-specific challenge by evaluating a test set on multiple re-trained instances of the same model and applying statistical tests. DeepMetis adopts the same non-deterministic view on DL systems, and correspondingly, its generation process is guided by multiple instances of the model being mutated. Recently, DL-specific mutation operators have been used for different tasks, such as program repair 3, adversarial inputs detection 4, generation of adversarial code snippets 5, and calculation of optimal oracles for autonomous vehicles 6, but no approach leveraged them to generate new inputs which augment an inadequate test set. We evaluated DeepMetis on both a classification problem and a regression problem, using mutation operators provided by DeepCrime. Results show that DeepMetis is effective at generating inputs that improve a test set in terms of its mutation killing ability.\nWe also conducted a leave-one-out experiment to simulate a practical usage scenario where an undetected fault affecting the DL system is unknown.\nIn this experiment setting, one mutant produced by DeepCrime is taken apart, while test augmentation is performed by DeepMetis based only on the remaining mutants. In this way, the left-out mutants simulate a yet unknown fault. Results show that left out mutants can be killed by the augmented test set on average 82% of the time.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: most of the DL systems’ behaviour depends on their training data, not the code.
