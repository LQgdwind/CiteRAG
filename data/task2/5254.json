      "content": "Paper Title: NBC-Softmax : Darkweb Author fingerprinting and migration tracking\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe darkweb is a subset of the deep web that is intentionally hidden, requiring specific privacy focused software and communication protocols, such as the Tor router 111https://www.torproject.org/ or Invisible Internet Project (I2P) 222https://geti2p.net/ for access [ref]1. This infrastructure guarantees anonymity and protection from surveillance and tracking  .\nDarkweb includes illicit drug trade, money laundering, counterfeit goods, information for sale and many other illicit services [ref]4 . Predominantly, pseudo-anonymous crypto currency is the preferred means of payment [ref]4.\nDespite wide law enforcement crackdowns, darkweb market users are resilient to closures . Rapid migrations to newer markets occur when one market shuts down , and the total number of users remains relatively unaffected. Non-English and multilingual darkweb markets have been increasing in number since 2013 . The majority of the darkweb markets have an associated forum where users can interact, discuss vendors and products, provide feedback, and build trust . Interactions on these forums are facilitated by means of text posted by their users. The only link between a real individual’s identity and activities in the darkweb is the username linked to a post .\nThis makes the analysis of these forums and post content a compelling problem . However, these forums discussions remain underutilized for identity analysis . Furthermore, most often, malicious users maintain multiple accounts (or Sybil accounts) within and across different crypto markets [ref]1 . User fingerprinting\nExisting research indicates the average lifespan of darkweb markets to be around 8 months . As a result, in order to maintain reputation and be able to quickly transition to a new darkweb market and ensure success, vendors tend to maintain their reputation between markets by using their username as a brand . Two accounts of the same vendor are most likely to have similar usernames on different darkweb markets or forums, while two accounts of same vendor in the same marketplace tend to be different . At present, (2022), relocation to other darkweb markets and forums is the key issue for law enforcement when dealing with darkweb cybercrime 333Europol, 2022. Thus, more efforts are needed to develop insight generation and forensic tools to help analysts . The most significant digital footprint in the darkweb, for forensic analysis, is a user’s post history . Linking different accounts operated by the same individual facilitates building a more accurate and refined profile of activities, track users across forums and properly assess behavior of darkweb users [ref]1. Linking different accounts aid accurately evaluate substance volumes advertised across the different crypto markets by each vendor [ref]1. Authorship profiling and authorship attribution are important areas in forensic linguistics . However, traditional techniques rely upon long, relatively clean and jargon free text to train language models. These techniques cannot be effectively applied for short, nosy text corpora, in a heavily anonymized environment .\nRecent work has been successful in using deep neural networks specifically design to address the aforementioned scarcity of easily identifiable ‘signature’ features;  used character and word-level modelling on shorter text,  combined subreddits (considering them as context) with posts to address the shortness of Reddit posts and most recently,  used a softmax based supervised metric loss and multitask learning to achieve state-of-the-art. The author style detection task can be formulated as a metric learning problem, where learning style features with small intra-class variations and larger inter-class differences is of great importance to achieve better performance .\nCurrent state-of-the-art for (darkweb) social forum author identification, SYSML  as well as many other classification-based detection and recognition tasks are mostly based on the widely used softmax loss . While softmax loss optimizes the inter-class differences by separating different classes well, it is not effective at reducing the intra-class variation to make features of the same class compact in representation space . While softmax loss can produce separable representations, its discriminative power is relatively poor .\nIn author identification tasks, representations needs to be not only separable but also discriminative. Features should be discriminative and generalized sufficiently in order to identify new unseen authors, as well as be able to show two authors, differently labelled, can in fact be the same sybil.\nAs a result, many new loss functions have been proposed to minimize the intra and inter class variation [ref]15  . Most of these variants are based on maximizing the separation margin of the class vectors and rely on large margin classification.\nHowever, in user detection, where the ground truth can have a higher degree of human annotation errors (especially in case of sybils), compacting the intra-class variation may impact the optimization. Further, above mentioned methods are only applicable to supervised deep metric learning. In an unsupervised setting, contrastive learning approaches achieve superior performance across multiple domains  . Discriminative approaches based on contrastive learning has been outstandingly successful in practice 0, achieving superior results or at times even outperforming its supervised learning counterparts 1. Hence, in this work we take the opposite approach. Rather than attempt to compact intra class variation or force strict larger margins as in prior work, we distance the weight vector of each class based on similarity using proxy (or prototype, or surrogate) block contrastive learning. Also, different to typical approaches that contrast negative samples with positives, we only use the negative samples, and even then, only the negative sample aggregates. Further, we contrast at a lower dimensional latent space which forces the network to extract common factors of variation from the data. Note that the application of contrastive learning to supervised metric loss is non-trivial.\nBoth contrastive loss (contrasting pairs of samples) and triplet loss (contrasting a triplet that where the anchor is contrasted with a positive and a negative) based metric loss suffer from dramatic data expansion due to expensive mining strategies used to obtain pairs or triplets for training. Additionally, the performance is extremely sensitive to hyperparameters and learning strategies . Our aforementioned approach does not require sampling, is robust to hyperparameter variations and is scalable. It demonstrates increasing performance with larger batch size and length. We are motivated by the effectiveness of contrastive learning, the availability of label information, and the recent work in surrogate proxies  . While 2, using cross-entropy with supervised contrastive loss is the most similar to our work, it is not block contrastive, and is based on traditional negatives and positive pairs, where as our NBC-Softmax only requires negative clusters. To summarize, our main contributions are: We introduce a novel loss, Negative Block Contrastive Softmax  (NBC-Softmax)to improve inter-cluster discrimination of traditional softmax loss. we provide a thorough supervised metric learning problem formulation relating this softmax based learning. we provide a detailed study of the hyperparameters of our NBC-Softmax including comparison with alternative metric learning approaches such as CosFace (CF) [ref]15, ArcFace (AF) , and MultiSimilarity (MS) . Experiments on 4 darkweb social forums for author and sybil detection shows that our NBC-Softmax constantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods using the same network architecture. Importantly, we show that our NBC-Softmax can significantly improve detection by combining multiple darkweb datasets from different sources and effectively link sybil accounts achieving up to 49% over prior work. Our work relates to darkweb forensic investigations and author profiling with the intention of detecting sybils, or users with multiple identities. The learnt representations can also be used for possible author identification (i.e., who authored the content?, a selection from a closed set task), verification (did the author write a given content, a binary classification) and other downstream tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: requiring specific privacy focused software and communication protocols, such as the Tor router 111https://www.torproject.org/ or Invisible Internet Project (I2P) 222https://geti2p.net/ for access [ref]1.
