      "content": "Paper Title: BKinD-3D: Self-Supervised 3D Keypoint Discovery from Multi-View Videos\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAll animals behave in 3D, and analyzing 3D posture and movement is crucial for a variety of applications, including the study of biomechanics, motor control, and behavior .\nHowever, annotations for supervised training of 3D pose estimators are expensive and time-consuming to obtain, especially for studying diverse animal species and varying experimental contexts.\nSelf-supervised keypoint discovery has demonstrated tremendous potential in discovering 2D keypoints from video 1  [ref]43, without the need for manual annotations.\nThese models have not been well-explored in 3D, which is more challenging compared to 2D due to depth ambiguities, a larger search space, and the need to incorporate geometric constraints.\nOur goal is to enable 3D keypoint discovery of humans and animals from synchronized multi-view videos, without 2D or 3D supervision. Self-Supervised 3D Keypoint Discovery.\nPrevious works for self-supervised 3D keypoints typically start from a pre-trained 2D pose estimator  , and thus do not perform keypoint discovery (Figure 1).\nThese models are suitable for studying human poses because 2D human pose estimators are widely available and the pose and body structure of humans is well-defined.\nHowever, for many scientific applications [ref]35  [ref]43, it is important to track diverse organisms in different experimental contexts. These situations require time-consuming 2D or 3D annotations for training pose estimation models.\nThe goal of our work is to enable 3D keypoint discovery from multi-view videos directly, without any 2D or 3D supervision, in order to accelerate the analysis of 3D poses from diverse animals in novel settings.\nTo the best of our knowledge, self-supervised 3D keypoint discovery have not been well-explored for real-world multi-view videos. Behavioral Videos. We study 3D keypoint discovery in the setting of behavioral videos with stationary cameras and backgrounds.\nWe chose this for several reasons.\nFirst, this setting is common in many real-world behavior analysis datasets     [ref]35 3 , where there has been an emerging trend to expand the study of behavior from 2D to 3D .\nThus, 3D keypoint discovery would directly benefit many scientific studies in this space using approaches such as biomechanics, motor control, and behavior .\nSecond, studying behavioral videos in 3D enables us to leverage recent work in 2D keypoint discovery for behavioral videos [ref]43.\nFinally, this setting enables us to tackle the 3D keypoint discovery challenge in a modular way.\nFor example, in behavior analysis experiments, many tools are already available for camera calibration 6, and we can assume that camera parameters are known. Our Approach. The key to our approach, which we call Behavioral Keypoint\nDiscovery in 3D (BKinD-3D), is to encode self-supervised learning signals from videos across multiple views into a single 3D geometric bottleneck.\nWe leverage the spatiotemporal difference reconstruction loss from [ref]43 and use multi-view reconstruction to train an encoder-decoder architecture.\nOur method does not use any bounding boxes or keypoint annotations as supervision.\nCritically, we impose links between our discovered keypoints to discover connectivity across points.\nIn other words, keypoints on the same parts of the body are connected, so that we are able to enforce joint length constraints in 3D.\nTo show that our model is applicable across multiple settings, we demonstrate our approach on multi-view videos from different organisms. To summarize: We introduce self-supervised 3D keypoint discovery, which discovers 3D pose from real-world multi-view behavioral videos of different organisms, without any 2D or 3D supervision. We propose a novel method (BKinD-3D) for end-to-end 3D discovery from video using multi-view spatiotemporal difference reconstruction and 3D joint length constraints. We demonstrate quantitatively that our work significantly closes the gap between supervised 3D methods and 3D keypoint discovery across different organisms (humans and rats).\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: especially for studying diverse animal species and varying experimental contexts.\nSelf-supervised keypoint discovery has demonstrated tremendous potential in discovering 2D keypoints from video 1  [ref]43, without the need for manual annotations.\nThese models have not been well-explored in 3D, which is more challenging compared to 2D due to depth ambiguities, a larger search space, and the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
