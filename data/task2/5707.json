Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

[ref]25 and Lee et al. [ref]29 investigate gradient space, which demonstrates effectiveness in revealing ID and OOD distinction.\nThose methods achieve great performance on several OOD detection benchmarks, but are tailored to the classification task and not applicable to pretrained visual encoders since they are dependent on classifier outputs.\nOn the other hand, methods based on feature space analysis, such as Mahalanobis  and KNN , not only exhibit exceptional OOD detection performance for classification models, but also showcase applicability to stand-alone visual encoders, including SupCon   and CLIP  4.\nSubspace analysis    measures the residual information from low-dimensional manifold  or column space of classifier weights.\nHowever, to achieve state-of-the-art performance, the result needs to be converted to classifier output space to factor in class-dependent information .\nIn this work, we combine the residual and discriminative information solely\nin the feature space via Linear Discriminant Analysis, which makes our\nmethod applicable to any visual encorder.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: work explores scoring functions to distinguish inliers and\noutliers, which is fundamental to the OOD detection task.\nMultiple designs have been proposed for pretrained deep visual classifiers    6   [ref]20 [ref]25 [ref]29     .\nThe most straightforward design is Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) score, which considers the network confidence as an uncertainty measurement.\nODIN  improves MSP’s\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
