      "content": "Paper Title: Im2Hands: Learning Attentive Implicit Representation of Interacting Two-Hand Shapes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSingle-Hand Reconstruction.\nMethods for single-hand reconstruction have been actively investigated in the past decades. Most existing deep learning-based approaches either reconstruct hand poses represented as 3D keypoints        , estimate MANO parameters   , or directly regress mesh vertex coordinates 5 3 2 . Inspired by the recent success of implicit representations in modeling human bodies    7, few recent works 9 [ref]7 also employ neural implicit functions for single-hand reconstruction. Compared to the existing methods based on mesh representations, these implicit function-based methods 9 [ref]7 can produce fine-grained hand geometry in a resolution-independent manner. Interacting Hand-Object Reconstruction.\nSimilar to single-hand reconstruction, most of the existing methods 6 5    on hand-object reconstruction adopt MANO topology-based mesh representations to model a hand shape. Few recent works 0 9 consider neural implicit representations to model hand-objects, but they often constrain their interaction based on contacts – which does not necessarily occur in hand-to-hand interactions [ref]44. In addition, these methods mainly consider a rigid object in the interaction, which makes them ineffective to be directly applied for articulated two-hand reconstruction. Interacting Two-Hand Reconstruction.\nCompared to single-hand or hand-object reconstruction, two-hand reconstruction is more challenging, as more complex occlusions and deformations occur from the interaction between two articulated hands. For modeling two interacting hands, there have been methods recently proposed for two-hand pose reconstruction from RGB images 9 1 1 4 [ref]44, depth images  , or RGB-D video sequences 3 . Yet, there are only a few methods that can directly reconstruct the dense surface of closely interacting two-hands 4 [ref]44  , which is more challenging and important in reasoning hand-to-hand interactions. Mueller et al.  propose an energy minimization framework to fit MANO  parameters to the input depth image of two interacting hands. Two-Hand-Shape-Pose [ref]44 introduce pose-aware attention and context-aware cascaded refinement modules to directly regress two-hand MANO parameters from an RGB image. IntagHand 4 propose an attention-based graph convolutional network (GCN) for two-hand vertex regression from an RGB image.\nThese recent deep learning-based frameworks [ref]44 4   have shown that (1) an attention mechanism to model non-local interactions and (2) context-aware shape refinement steps are effective in two-hand reconstruction, which have inspired the design of our two-hand occupancy function. However, compared to these existing methods, our occupancy-based method can learn resolution-independent hand surface with better image-shape alignment, as our output space (i.e., occupancy field) itself is more directly aligned with the input image space. Neural Articulated Implicit Representation.\nMany existing methods to model articulated objects (e.g., human bodies, hands) use neural articulated implicit representations  9 [ref]7   7, which directly condition an implicit geometry on the object articulation.\nWhile many methods    7 mainly demonstrate their results on human body modeling, there are only a few studies that explore the effectiveness of implicit representations for hands. LISA [ref]7 proposes an articulated VolSDF  to model shape and appearance of single-hands, but it assumes that various input domains (i.e., multi-view RGB image sequences, 3D bone transformations and foreground masks) are available and requires model optimization for inference. HALO 9 proposes a single-hand articulated occupancy function driven by 3D keypoints via incorporating a novel canonicalization layer – eliminating the need for the ground truth 3D bone transformations used in most of the articulated implicit functions  [ref]7   7. However, HALO models pose-independent shape variations only with hand bone lengths, which may be a strong assumption. We take inspiration from HALO to condition our two-hand occupancy on the pose represented as sparse 3D keypoints, but we further improve HALO by conditioning shape variations using an RGB image, which is a more direct form of shape observation than bone lengths.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: , estimate MANO parameters   , or directly regress mesh vertex coordinates 5 3 2 .
