      "content": "Paper Title: Improving One-stage Visual Grounding by Recursive Sub-query Construction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual grounding aims to ground a natural language query onto a region of the image. There are mainly two threads of works in visual grounding: the two-stage approach [ref]41      and one-stage approach [ref]47  7. Two-stage approaches first extract region proposals and then rank the proposals based on their similarities with the query. The recently proposed one-stage approach takes a different paradigm but soon becomes prevailing. The one-stage approach fuses visual-text features at image-level and directly predicts bounding boxes to ground the referred object. By densely sampling the possible object locations and reducing the redundant computation over region proposals, the one-stage methods [ref]47  7 are simple, fast, and accurate. In this paper, we improve the state-of-the-art one-stage methods by addressing their weaknesses in modeling long and complex queries. The overall advantage of our method is shown in Figure 2. Compared to the current state-of-the-art one-stage method [ref]47, whose performance drops dramatically on longer queries, our approach achieves remarkably superior performance. We analyze the limitations of current one-stage methods as follows. Existing one-stage methods [ref]47  7 encode the entire query as a single embedding vector, such as directly adopting the first token’s embedding ([CLS]delimited-[]CLS\\left[\\textrm{CLS}\\right]) from BERT  [ref]47 or aggregating hidden states from LSTM  [ref]47  7. The single vector is then concatenated at all spatial locations with visual features to obtain the fused features for grounding box prediction.\nModeling the entire language query as a single embedding vector tends to increase representation ambiguity, such as focusing on some words, yet overlooking other important ones. Such a problem potentially causes the loss of referring information, especially on those long and complex queries.\nFor example in Figure 2 (a), the model seems to overlook detailed descriptions such as “sitting on the couch” or “looking tv,” and grounds the wrong region with the head noun “man.” As for Figure 2 (b), the model appears to look into the wrong word “mountain” and grounds the target without full consideration of the modifier of “water.” Neglecting the query modeling problem, thus, causes the performance drop on long queries for the one-stage approach. Several two-stage visual grounding works   [ref]46    have studied a similar query modeling problem. The main idea of these works is to link object regions with the parsed sub-queries to have a comprehensive understanding of the referring. Among them, MattNet  parses the query into the subject, location, and relationship phrases, and links each phrase with the related object regions for matching score computing. NMTREE  parses the query with a dependency tree parser  and links each tree node with a visual region. DGA [ref]46 parses the query with text self-attention and links the text with regions via dynamic graph attention. Though elegant enough, these methods are designed intuitively for two-stage methods, requiring candidate region features to be extracted at the first stage. Since the main benefit of doing one-stage visual grounding is to avoid explicitly extracting candidate region features for the sake of computational cost, the query modeling in two-stage methods cannot be directly applied to the one-stage framework [ref]47  7.\nTherefore, in this paper, to address the query modeling problem in a unified one-stage framework, we propose the recursive sub-query construction framework. When presented with a referring problem such as Figure 2 (a), humans tend to solve it by reasoning back-and-forth between the image and query for multiple rounds and recursively reduce the referring ambiguity, i.e., the possible region that contains the referred object.\nInspired by this, we proposed to represent the intermediate understanding of the referring in each round as the text-conditional visual feature, which starts as the image feature and updated after multiple rounds, ending up as the fused visual-text feature ready for box prediction. In each round, the model constructs a new sub-query as a group of words attended with scores to refine the text-conditional visual feature. Gradually, with multiple rounds, our model reduces the referring ambiguity. Such a multi-round solution is in contrast to previous one-stage approaches that try to remember the entire query and ground the region in a single round. Our framework recursively constructs sub-queries to refine the grounding prediction. Each round faces with two core problems that facilitate recursive reasoning, namely 1) how to construct the sub-query; and 2) how to refine the text-conditional visual feature with the sub-query. We propose a sub-query learner and a sub-query modulation network to solve the above two problems, respectively.\nThey work alternately and recursively to reduce the referring ambiguity. Using the text-conditional visual features in the last round, a final output stage predicts bounding boxes to grounding the referred object. We benchmark our framework on the ReferItGame , RefCOCO , RefCOCO+ , RefCOCOg 9 datasets, with 5.0%,4.5%,7.5%,12.8%percent5.0percent4.5percent7.5percent12.85.0\\%,4.5\\%,7.5\\%,12.8\\% absolute improvements over the state-of-the-art one-stage method [ref]47.\nMeanwhile, our method runs fast at 38 FPS (26​m​s26𝑚𝑠26ms).\nMoreover, the relative gain curve according to the query length changes in Figure 2 shows the effectiveness of our approach in solving the aforementioned query modeling problem. Our main contributions are: We improve one-stage visual grounding by addressing previous one-stage methods’ limitations on grounding long and complex queries. We propose a recursive sub-query construction framework that recursively reduces the referring ambiguity with different constructed sub-queries. Our proposed method shows significantly improved results on multiple datasets and meanwhile maintains the real-time inference speed. Extensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our method.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: Visual grounding aims to ground a natural language query onto a region of the image.
