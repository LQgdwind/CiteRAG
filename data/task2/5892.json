      "content": "Paper Title: Transformer-based Self-supervised Multimodal Representation Learning for Wearable Emotion Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince the exploration of wearable emotion recognition based on peripheral physiological signals has not been well established, a series of baseline models based on fully-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and self-supervised learning were implemented in addition to available state-of-the-art methods to provide a more comprehensive and reliable performance comparison.\nThe followings are brief descriptions of these models:\nSupervised learning-based methods: SimpDCNN [ref]29: it is a simple convolutional network consisting of three convolutional blocks with kernel sizes of 24, 16 and 8, each followed by a ReLU activation and a dropout layer. MulT [ref]38: it is a transformer-based multimodal fusion method applied to video, audio and text. The unimodal data is first passed through a temporal convolutional network to obtain low-level features, then transformers based on cross-modal attention and self-attention mechanisms are applied successively for effective fusion. ResNet : it is a 1D convolution-based residual network adapted to physiological signals proposed in Â  , which is constructed similarly to ResNet-18, consists mainly of 8 residual blocks with batch normalization (BN) operation and ReLU activation function, where each block contains two convolutional layers. The three modalities: BVP, EDA, TEMP are fed into this network as multi-channel signals. Ours (Supervised): it is our proposed multimodal network, trained in a fully-supervised manner. In addition, three additional supervised methods were applied for the performance comparison on the CASE and K-EmoCon datasets since they lacked baseline results compared to the WESAD dataset. DCNN : it employs a four-layer 1D convolutional neural network to extract modality-specific features, and a three-layer fully connected network connected at the bottom of the network for classification. Attn-BiLSTM : it applies a multilayer bidirectional LSTM for capturing valid temporal information for multimodal signals. The attention mechanism was applied to select the most relevant multimodal representation of the emotional state as input for a fully connected layer-based classifier. MMResLSTM : it uses separate four-layer LSTM-based models for multimodal signals with residual connections. Moreover, the weights of the LSTM layers of both modalities are shared to activate cross-modal communication. Unsupervised learning-based methods: Autoencoder: it is an autoencoder with the same encoder part as our proposed model, while the decoder part consists of three transposed convolutional blocks for the reconstruction of the BVP, EDA, TEMP signals. Each unimodal decoder consists of four-layer transposed convolution with the same parameters as the convolutional layers in the encoder. Self-supervised learning-based methods: SigRep : it adopts a similar model architecture to SimCLR [ref]18, containing an encoder of four inception-inspired blocks and a projection head consisting of fully connected layers, where each inception block consists of 1D convolutional layers with different kernel sizes and a maximum pooling layer in parallel. The model is applied independently to each signal modality for contrastive representation learning. BENDR : it is a simpler version of wav2vec 2.0  that was applied to EEG signals. We adapted it for application to peripheral physiological signals at low frequencies. The multi-channel signal consisting of BVP, EDA, TEMP is first passed through a four-layer convolution with kernel sizes of 3, 2, 2, 2, where the GeLU is chosen as the activation function along with GroupNorm and Dropout operations, and the obtained low-level features are randomly masked and fed to the same transformer as our proposed model. The final output features are used to reconstruct the masked features. For a fair comparison, we used the code provided by the authors of the above methods and applied the same experimental setup. If the code is not available, we followed the parameters provided in these works for the model implementation. For those models initially designed for non-peripheral physiological signals, the parameters have been slightly adjusted to match the low-frequency wearable data for proper operation.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: state-of-the-art methods to provide a more comprehensive and reliable performance comparison.\nThe followings are brief descriptions of these models:\nSupervised learning-based methods: SimpDCNN [ref]29: it is a simple convolutional network consisting of three convolutional blocks with kernel sizes of 24, 16 and 8, each followed by a ReLU activation and a dropout layer.
