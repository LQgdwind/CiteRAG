      "content": "Paper Title: Offline Reinforcement Learning with Reverse Model-based Imagination\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved tremendous successes in a range of domains    by utilizing a large number of interactions with the environment. However, in many real-world applications, collecting sufficient exploratory interactions is usually impractical, because online data collection can be costly or even dangerous, such as in healthcare   and autonomous driving . To address this challenge, offline RL   develops a new learning paradigm that trains RL agents only with pre-collected offline datasets and thus can abstract away from the cost of online exploration  [ref]8  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. For such offline settings, recent studies demonstrate that directly applying the online RL algorithms can lead to poor performance [ref]8  6. This phenomenon is primarily attributed to distributional shift  between the learning policy and the behavior policy induced by the given dataset. With function approximation, the learning policy can overgeneralize the offline dataset and result in unexpected or dangerous behaviors. Thus developing techniques to handle distributional shift is becoming an active topic in the community of offline RL. Recently, a variety of advanced offline RL algorithms have been proposed, which introduce conservatism bias and constrain the policy search in high-confidence regions induced by the offline dataset. Model-free offline RL methods  [ref]8  0 1 explicitly encode such bias into policy or value functions by using conservative regularizations or specially designed network structures. These methods often effectively address distributional shift issues, but their constrained policy search can limit the generalization beyond the offline dataset. In contrast, model-based offline RL  2 3 4 5 adopts more aggressive approaches. They first learn a forward dynamics model from the offline dataset with conservatism quantifications and then generate imaginary trajectories on high confidence regions to extend the offline dataset. Specifically, these methods may use a model-uncertainty quantification 2 3, representation learning of a robust model 4, or a conservative estimation of value functions 5 to ensure the confidence of model-based rollouts. However, because samples in offline datasets are limited, conservatism quantifications often suffer from overgeneralization, especially in out-of-support regions. Thus, these unreliable measures can overestimate some unknown states and mislead forward model-based imaginations to undesired areas, leading to radicalism. In this paper, we will investigate a new direction in the context of model-based offline RL and propose reverse model imagination that enables effective conservative generalization. We use Figure 1a to illustrate our basic ideas. When an offline dataset contains expert or nearly optimal trajectories, model-free offline RL methods  [ref]8  0 1 show promising performance. In other situations, such as in Figure 1a, when the optimal policy requires a composition of multiple trajectories () in the offline dataset, model-free offline RL usually fails because it may get stuck in isolated regions of the offline dataset (). In contrast, model-based approaches 2 3 4 5 have advantages of connecting trajectories in the offline dataset by generating bridging rollouts. When using forward dynamics models, model-based methods can generate aggressive rollouts from the dataset to outside areas (). Such forward imaginations potentially discover a better policy outside the offline dataset, but may also lead to undesirable regions consisting of fake high-value states () due to overgeneralization errors.\nThings will be different if we reverse the model imagination. Reverse imaginations () generate possible traces leading to target goal states () inside the offline dataset, which provides a conservative way of augmenting the offline dataset. We assume that the reverse dynamics model has similar accuracy to the forward model. In this way, reverse models not only maintain the generalization ability to interpolate between given trajectories and potential better policies but also avoid radical model imagination by enabling bidirectional search in conjunction with the existing forward real trajectories () in the offline dataset. The scenario illustrated in Figure 1a is common in RL tasks 8, where the agent may encounter new obstacles or unexpected dangers at any time (e.g., bumping into walls like in Figure 1b or falling). As many unexpected data are not recorded by an offline dataset, there are likely large generalization errors outside the support of the dataset. Thus, reverse models that can generate conservative imaginations are more appealing for real-world offline RL tasks. Based on the above observation, we present a novel model-based offline RL framework, called Reverse Offline Model-based Imagination (ROMI). ROMI trains a reverse dynamics model and generates backward imaginary trajectories by a backtracking rollout policy. This rollout policy is learned by a conditional generative model to produce diverse reverse actions for each state and lead to the unknown data space with high probabilities. ROMI ensures start states of the reverse rollout trajectories (i.e., target goals of forward trajectories) are within the offline dataset, and thus naturally imposes conservative constraints on imaginations. With this conservative data augmentation, ROMI has the advantage of effectively combining with off-the-shelf model-free algorithms (e.g., BCQ [ref]8 and CQL 1) to further strengthen its generalization with proper conservatism. Taken together, the whole ROMI framework enables extensive interpolation of the dataset and potentially better performance (contributed by diverse policy) in a safe manner (contributed by reverse imagination). To our best knowledge, ROMI is the first offline RL approach that utilizes reverse model-based imaginations to induce conservatism bias with data augmentation. It provides a novel bidirectional learning paradigm for offline RL, which connects reverse imaginary trajectories with pre-collected forward trajectories in the offline dataset. Such a bidirectional learning paradigm shares similar motivations with humans’ bidirectional reasoning. Studies from Psychology 9 show that, during the decision-making process, humans not only consider the consequences of possible future actions from a forward view but also imagine possible traces leading to the ideal goal through backward inference. We conduct extensive evaluations on the D4RL offline benchmark suite 8. Empirical results show that ROMI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines. Our method achieves the best or comparable performance on 16 out of 24 tasks among all algorithms. Ablation studies verify that the reverse model imagination can effectively generate more conservative behaviors than forward model imagination.
