      "content": "Paper Title: Nerfbusters: Removing Ghostly Artifacts from Casually Captured NeRFs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe represent a 3D scene with a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), [ref]20 which takes a 3D point as input and outputs color and density, and is trained with differentiable volume rendering [ref]20 . We build on the Nerfacto model from Nerfstudio  that combines recent progress in NeRFs including hash grid encoding , proposal sampling [ref]1, per-image-appearance optimization , and scene contraction [ref]1. Although Nerfacto has been optimized for in-the-wild image captures, it still reveals floaters when rendered from novel views. To address these issues, we propose a novel regularization strategy that includes (1) a mechanism for sampling cubes of occupancy from non-empty parts of the NeRF and (2) a novel Density Score Distillation Sampling (DSDS) loss that encourages sampled occupancy to agree with the learned geometry prior of the diffusion model. Cube importance sampling.  Since the NeRF represents a density field, we can query cubes of occupancy in 3D space at any size, location, and resolution. Sampling these cubes uniformly from the NeRF volume is inefficient, particularly if much of the scene is empty. To enable more efficient sampling, we store a low-resolution grid of either accumulation weights or densities, which can be used to inform the probability with which to sample different positions in the scene. This grid is jointly updated with exponential moving average (EMA) decay over the course of NeRF training, such that regions with deleted floaters are not repeatedly sampled during later stages of training. The choice between the use of accumulation weights and densities has associated trade-offs: using accumulation weights yields cubes sampled mostly on frequently seen surfaces, whereas using densities enables sampling of occluded regions. In practice, our experiments use a grid of densities, clamped to [ref]0 [ref]0 [ref]1 to avoid a few densities dominating the sampling probability. This importance sampling method comes with almost no added cost since we store the densities or weights along the rays already used for volume rendering, and use a small 203superscript20320^{3} grid. This grid informs the selection of the 3D cube center, and the size is randomly chosen in a range of 111-10%percent1010\\% of the scene, with a voxel resolution of 323superscript32332^{3}. Density Score Distillation Sampling (DSDS). Our diffusion model is trained on discretized synthetic data in {−1,1}11\\{-1,1\\} indicating free or occupied space, respectively. NeRF densities, on the other hand, are in [0,∞)0[0,\\infty), where low densities indicate free space and larger densities mean more occupied space. In practice, we observe that densities less than 0.010.010.01 are mostly free space, whereas occupied space have density values ranging from [0.01,2000]0.012000[0.01,2000]. We propose a Density Score Distillation Sampling (DSDS) loss that handles the domain gap between the densities. Given a cube of NeRF densities σ𝜎\\sigma, we discretize the densities into binary occupancy: xt=1subscript𝑥𝑡1x_{t}=1 if σ>τ𝜎𝜏\\sigma>\\tau else −11-1 for diffusion timestep t𝑡t, where τ𝜏\\tau is a hyperparameter that decides at what density to consider a voxel for empty or occupied. The Nerfbusters diffusion model then predicts the denoised cube x0subscript𝑥0x_{0}. The timestep t𝑡t is a hyperparameter that determines how much noise the diffusion model should remove and can be interpreted as a learning rate. In practice, we choose a small t∈ 𝑡1050t\\in . With the denoised cube x0subscript𝑥0x_{0}, we penalize NeRF densities that the diffusion model predicts as empty or increase densities that the diffusion model predicts as occupied with: where m=𝟙​{x0<0}𝑚1subscript𝑥00m=\\mathds{1}\\{x_{0}<0\\} is a mask based on the denoised predictions. We penalize densities where the diffusion model predicts emptiness and increase densities where the model predicts occupancy. w𝑤w is a hyperparameter that determines how much to increase the densities in occupied space. The max\\max operator ensures that no loss is applied if an occupied voxel already has a density above w𝑤w. Similar to SDS  , the DSDS loss distills the diffusion prior with a single forward pass and without backpropagating through the diffusion model. Unlike SDS, our DSDS loss does not add noise to the original sampled occupancy before providing it to the diffusion model. While one may imagine that occupancy grids sampled during the NeRF optimization process do not exactly match the distribution of noised cubes used in training, we find that the denoising process nevertheless produces plausible samples that are both on the manifold of clean surfaces and similar in content to the input cubes. Why not just… use a differentiable function to convert densities to the valid range of the diffusion model, then compute the SDS loss  , and then backpropagate through the activation function? This would require a function s:σ→xt:𝑠→𝜎subscript𝑥𝑡s:\\sigma\\rightarrow x_{t} to map s​(0)=−1𝑠01s(0)=-1, s​(τ)=0𝑠𝜏0s(\\tau)=0, and s​(2​τ)=1𝑠2𝜏1s(2\\tau)=1, where τ𝜏\\tau is the crossing value where densities begin to be occupied. A scaled and shifted sigmoid function or a clamped linear function satisfies these requirements, but both have very steep gradients in some regions and no gradients in other regions, resulting in issues when backpropagating. In contrast, DSDS has gradients for any density predicted to be empty or occupied. In practice, we set τ=w=0.01𝜏𝑤0.01\\tau=w=0.01 meaning our method deletes densities at points predicted to be empty and otherwise leaves the points unconstrained for the NeRF RGB loss to freely optimize. Why not just… use accumulated weights, which are in the range [ref]0 [ref]1?\nWeights are more well-behaved than densities but more expensive to compute as they require shooting a ray through the scene, evaluating and accumulating the densities along a ray. This results in significantly more function calls, but more fundamentally, requires one to specify a view from which to shoot the rays. This limits the diffusion prior to improving regions that are visible regions from the chosen view. A similar issue arises when using 2D or 2.5D priors  , where they may not regularize occluded regions unless viewpoints are chosen in a scene-specific way.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: We represent a 3D scene with a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), [ref]20 which takes a 3D point as input and outputs color and density, and is trained with differentiable volume rendering [ref]20 .
