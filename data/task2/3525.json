      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-modal Alignment using Representation Codebook\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVision language (V&L) representation learning is the problem of learning a unified feature embedding using both image and text signals. Pretrained V&L models have a great diversity of applications in various downstream tasks across different settings, e.g. via transfer learning  [ref]28 . The main tasks in V&L pretraining include aligning the feature spaces of different modalities (multi-modal alignment    [ref]28 [ref]25) and capturing the interaction across modalities (cross-modal fusion,   ). Late fusion approaches such as CLIP and ALIGN [ref]21 focused on the first task, while early fusion approaches such as OSCAR [ref]28, VinVL  and VilLT focused on the second one. In this work, we adopt a hybrid approach similar to ALBEF [ref]25, where features from image and text modalities were first aligned and then fused using a transformer encoder. The main focus of our work is on the feature alignment stage, which is challenging due to the fact that image and text inputs have very different characteristics. Existing approaches such as CLIP  and ALIGN [ref]21 have to rely on large training resources and on massive amount of data to obtain good alignments (400M and 1.8B image-text pairs respectively). In this work, we propose a more efficient alignment strategy by using a codebook that quantizes the common text-image feature space into codewords. These codewords or cluster centers provide a more stable means for contrastive reasoning compared to individual text or visual features. We took the inspiration from SwAV, which was developed for self-supervised visual representation learning. In , two augmented versions (views) of the same input image were passed through a deep network for feature extraction. Visual embedding was learned by optimizing an objective function that enforces the consistency between the feature from one view and the assigned cluster from the other view. SwAV achieved impressive performance in various transfer tasks (see ). Here, we carried out contrastive reasoning across modalities (image-text) instead of cross image views. Details are in Section 3.1, but in a nutshell, we use a learnable codebook for both image and text modalities and train our model to predict the codeword assignment using either text or visual information. Effectively, visual and text features are lined up via aligning with the common codewords during training. See Figure 1 for an illustration. The codebook can be considered as a quantized sample of the underlying output feature distribution. It is end-to-end learnable together with the model parameters. To avoid abrupt changes during training, we further employ momentum distillation, which has been widely used in previous self-supervised learning works such as BYOL , DINO , MoCo. In brief, similar to ALBEF [ref]25, for each of the image, text and fusion encoders, there is a corresponding encoder that is updated through moving average without gradient back propagation. These momentum encoders serve as teachers to guide the self-supervised learning process. Different from ALBEF [ref]25, we use the teachers to guide codebook learning as well as for the cross-modal and intra-modal alignment. The above two components are wired up to support the stable update of the codebook which, in turn, provides an efficient regularization mean for cross modality alignment. Experiment results (Section 4) show that our approach is competitive with state of the art across various benchmarks even when comparing with approach that use massive amount of data such as CLIP  and ALIGN [ref]21.\nIn summary, our main contributions are as follows,\n We propose a codebook-based approach for efficient vision-language alignment learning. It is an extension from self-supervised vision representation learning (SSL) to the multimodal setting. We introduce a new distillation algorithm that helps unimodal and crossmodal contrastive optimization as well as helps stablize codebook learning. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We introduce related work to ours in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe our framework, called Codebook Learning with Distillation (CODIS), and its two components, multimodal codebook learning and teacher-student distillation. Experimental results are presented in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: feature embedding using both image and text signals.
