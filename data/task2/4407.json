      "content": "Paper Title: ReFactor GNNs: Revisiting Factorisation-based Models from a Message-Passing Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, machine learning on graphs has attracted significant attention due to the abundance of graph-structured data and developments in graph learning algorithms.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown state-of-the-art performance for many graph-related problems, such as node classification [ref]16 and graph classification .\nTheir main advantage is that they can easily be applied in an inductive setting: generalising to new nodes and graphs without re-training.\nHowever, despite many attempts at applying GNNs for multi-relational link prediction tasks such as Knowledge Graph Completion , there are still few positive results compared to factorisation-based models (FMs) [ref]45 [ref]39.\nAs it stands, GNNs either – after resolving reproducibility concerns – deliver significantly lower performance   or yield negligible performance gains at the cost of highly sophisticated architecture designs .\nA notable exception is NBFNet , but even here improvements come at the price of high computational inference costs compared to FMs.\nFurthermore, it is unclear how NBFNet could incorporate node features, which – as we will see in this work – leads to remarkably lower performance in an inductive setting.\nOn the other hand FMs, despite being a simpler architecture, have been found to be very accurate for knowledge graph completion when coupled with appropriate training strategies  and training objectives  .\nHowever, they also come with shortcomings in that they, unlike GNNs, can not be applied in an inductive setting. Given the respective strengths and weaknesses of FMs and GNNs, can we bridge these two seemingly different model categories?\nWhile exploring this question, we make the following contributions: By reformulating gradient descent on node embeddings using message-passing primitives, we show a practical connection between FMs and GNNs, in that: FMs can be treated as a special instance of GNNs, but with infinite neighbourhood, layer-wise training and a global normaliser.111The traditional view is that the transductive nature of FMs stem from their need to retrain on new nodes, a view which we further underpin by also observing that FMs are not inductive due to the need for infinite layers of on-the-fly message-passing. Based on this connection, we propose a new family of architectures, referred to as ReFactor GNNs, which interpolates between FMs and GNNs.\nIn essence, ReFactor GNNs inductivise FMs by using a finite number of message-passing layers, and incorporating node features.\n Through an empirical investigation across 15 well-established inductive and transductive benchmarks, we find ReFactor GNNs achieve state-of-the-art inductive performance and comparable transductive performance to FMs – despite using an order of magnitude fewer parameters.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: graph-structured data and developments in graph learning algorithms.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown state-of-the-art performance for many graph-related problems, such as node classification [ref]16 and graph classification .\nTheir main advantage is that they can easily be applied in an inductive setting: generalising to new nodes and graphs without re-training.\nHowever, despite many\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
