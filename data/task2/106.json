      "content": "Paper Title: A Large-Scale Evaluation of Shape-Aware Neighborhood Weights and Neighborhood Sizes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we present our quantitative evaluation of the weights presented in Equation (2).\nFor the evaluation, we utilize the classification error Edimsuperscript𝐸dimensionE^{\\dim} as defined in Equation (7).\nOur clean models are taken from a data set described in .\nThe authors provide ten thousand clean and manifold surface meshes, which are obtained by exporting only the boundary of the tetrahedral meshes used in .\nFrom these, we randomly select a subset of 1,00010001,000 meshes with uniform probability.\nFurthermore, we use 100100100 meshed models each from the real-world object scans provided by  and by .\nFinally, to test the scalability of our approach, we also include the model “Pan et Oursons” from . For all these models, we use the mesh information and its manifold property to obtain oriented face normals.\nFrom these, we compute vertex normals and then use these and the vertices as point sets for our experiments.\nFor each such point set P𝑃P, we consider the parameter sets for the choice of a𝑎a and b𝑏b, respectively, where we ensure that a≤b𝑎𝑏{a\\leq b}.\nWe choose this range as a reasonable trade-off between complexity of the experiments and exploration of the parameter space.\nNote that in Section 5.5, we consider further parameter values that are rooted in the application scenario considered there.\nWe use the combinatorial neighborhood notion222For a point pi∈Psubscript𝑝𝑖𝑃p_{i}\\in P, we consider the index i𝑖i as well as the indices of the k𝑘k nearest neighbors to pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} within P𝑃P as neighborhood 𝒩isubscript𝒩𝑖\\mathcal{N}_{i}, i.e., |𝒩i|=k+1subscript𝒩𝑖𝑘1{|\\mathcal{N}_{i}|=k+1}., so that for every pair (a,b)∈𝔄×𝔅𝑎𝑏𝔄𝔅{\\color[rgb]{0,0,0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,0}\\pgfsys@color@gray@stroke{0}\\pgfsys@color@gray@fill{0}(a,b)\\in\\mathfrak{A}\\times\\mathfrak{B}} and every point pi∈Psubscript𝑝𝑖𝑃{p_{i}\\in P}, we calculate its Eidimsuperscriptsubscript𝐸𝑖dimensionE_{i}^{\\dim} value over the range of k𝑘k, taken from We assume this range for k𝑘k, as it reflects typical, heuristic choices for neighborhood sizes in the area of point set processing, see the works discussed in Section 2, in particular [ref]26.\nFor each point pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} in each point set P𝑃P, we obtain an optimal parameter triple (ai∗,bi∗,ki∗)superscriptsubscript𝑎𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑏𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑘𝑖{\\left(a_{i}^{*},b_{i}^{*},k_{i}^{*}\\right)} as Following the discussion from Section 4.2, we set Eidim=∞superscriptsubscript𝐸𝑖dimension{E_{i}^{\\dim}=\\infty} if the covariance matrix Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i} for the point pi∈Psubscript𝑝𝑖𝑃{p_{i}\\in P} degenerates for all parameter choices (a,b,k)∈𝔄×𝔅×𝔎𝑎𝑏𝑘𝔄𝔅𝔎{(a,b,k)\\in\\mathfrak{A}\\times\\mathfrak{B}\\times\\mathfrak{K}}. See Figure 3 for an illustration of the classification error Edimsuperscript𝐸dimensionE^{\\dim} on the fandisk geometry as well as for a comparison of different parameter choices (a,b)𝑎𝑏(a,b).\nThe top row shows the classification error Eidimsuperscriptsubscript𝐸𝑖dimensionE_{i}^{\\dim} from Equation (7) on each point of the geometry, colored from low error (white) to large error (dark blue).\nNote that when fixing parameters (a,b)𝑎𝑏{(a,b)}, it is possible that the covariance matrix Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i} degenerates for every choice k∈𝔎𝑘𝔎{k\\in\\mathfrak{K}}.\nThis happens for the specific choice a=b=arccos⁡(0.9)𝑎𝑏0.9{a=b=\\arccos(0.9)} as used in .\nWe have colored the respective points red.\nThe optimal triple from Equation (9) achieves significantly lower classification error Eidimsuperscriptsubscript𝐸𝑖dimensionE_{i}^{\\dim} than the equal weights of  or the cut-off weights of .\nThe observed fluctuation in planar areas is due to (a) the utilization of combinatorial neighborhoods, which do not always provide symmetrically shaped neighborhoods on a synthetic geometry like the fandisk, as well as to (b) the sensitivity of Eidimsuperscriptsubscript𝐸𝑖dimensionE_{i}^{\\dim} to slight changes in the covariance matrix. The bottom row of Figure 3 shows a feature classification according to the maximum value out of linearity (orange), planarity (white), and scattering (dark blue) as defined in Equation (6).\nNote how the equal weights of  classify almost all elements as planar and fail to identify edge structures.\nIn contrast, the cut-off weights of  identify all edges, but over-pronounce them.\nThe optimal weight choice from (9) takes a middle ground between these two extremes, on the cost of identifying several clearly planar points as linear.\nAgain, this stems to a certain extend from the run a synthetic geometry.\nObserve that the equal weights and the optimal weights do identify scattered points (one example being the topmost corner of fandisk) while the cut-off weights rather fail to create a covariance matrix at corner points.\n The images in Figure 3 summarize our following experiments.\nIn order to compare with the findings of , we compute the classification error Eidimsuperscriptsubscript𝐸𝑖dimensionE_{i}^{\\dim} for each point of every point set of the three chosen model repositories    as well as of the single, large model from . \nIn the following we report and interpret our findings.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: taken from We assume this range for k𝑘k, as it reflects typical, heuristic choices for neighborhood sizes in the area of point set processing, see the works discussed in Section 2, in particular [ref]26.\nFor each point pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} in each point set P𝑃P, we obtain an optimal parameter\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
