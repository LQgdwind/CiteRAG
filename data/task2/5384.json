      "content": "Paper Title: Deep learning-based method for segmenting epithelial layer of tubules in histopathological images of testicular tissue\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn traditional image processing, handcrafted features based on intensity of pixels and spatial relationship between them are derived from the image. These features are used to detect regions of interest such as cells, glands, tubular structure and epithelial tissues and to classify them. Sirinukunwattana el al.  used texture and color of each superpixel to estimate the probability of superpixels belonging to glandular regions, resulting in a glandular probability map. Niak et al.  used Bayesian classifier to detect candidate gland regions by utilizing low-level image features, while Altunbay et al.  constructed a graph on multiple tissue components and colored its edges depending on the component types of their endpoints. Subsequently, a new set of structural features re-derived from color graphs and used this in the classification of tissues. Other methods take advantage of prior shape information of histological structures and applied mathematical models to detect objects of interest. For example, Fakhrzadeh et al.  employed geodesic distance transform to detect tubular boundaries, and Fu et al.  used polar space random field model to segment glandular structures. Advances in deep learning have resulted in new methods which generally outperform handcrafted features on segmentation tasks in digital pathology  . Xu et al.  applied deep residual network (ResNet) on patches extracted from Whole slide imaging (WSI) of testicular tissue section to segment seminiferous tubules. Cire≈üsan et al. [ref]15 trained a supervised deep neural network to differentiate patches with a mitotic nucleus from all other patches. To detect cancer metastases in breast atypical lymph nodes at a fine-grained level, Wang et al.  applied convolutional neural network (CNN) on millions of small positive and negative patches from WSI to assign a prediction score to every patch. The final decision is aggregated from the micro predictions. BenTaieb et al. [ref]17 proposed a multi-loss convolution network that performs both classification and segmentation of adenocarcinoma glands using a joint learning of a segmentation and classification that is modelled in a unified framework based on a novel deep learning architecture and multi-loss objective function. Chen et al.  proposed contour-aware deep learning architecture network (DCAN) under a unified multi-task learning framework for more accurate detection and segmentation of glandular structure. Xu et al.  designed a deep multichannel side supervision system (DMCS), where region and boundary cues were fused with side supervision to segment glands in colon histological images. Xu et al.  used deep residual network (ResNet) to segment seminiferous tubule from mouse (Mus musculus) testicular sections. Then, utilizing other deep ResNet for multi-cell; spermatid, spermatocyte, and spermatogonia, segmentation and a fully convolutional network (FCN) for multi-region; elongated spermatid, round spermatid, spermatogonial and spermatocyte region segmentation. Zhang et al.  suggested a label rectification method based on error correction, namely ECLR, which can be directly added after the fully-supervised segmentation framework. They proposed a collaborative multi-task discriminative error prediction network (DEP-Net) and the specific mask degradation methods to high-light the inter-class error and intra-class error, enhancing the error recognition ability of DEP-Net. Their suggested method performed well on gland segmentation. Recently, most of the state of the arts CNNs for segmentation consist of two parts: encoder, which extracts feature maps, and decoder, which produces segmentation map by upsampling feature maps. One of the first networks introduced based on encoder-decoder architecture was U-Net . The encoder section in U-Net takes the input image performing operations such as convolutions and pooling to capture rich contextual information at different resolution levels. The decoder section uses features obtained from encoder section to localize objects of interest and obtains sharp object boundaries. U-Net proved to be effective in many medical image segmentation tasks, specifically when available data is limited.\nSalvi et al.  designed a glands segmentation strategy using a multi-channel algorithm that exploits and fuses both traditional and U-Net based deep learning techniques. Specifically, their proposed approach employs a hybrid segmentation strategy based on stroma detection to accurately detect and delineate the prostate glands contours.\nBouteldja et al.  proposed an automated algorithm based on U-Net to accurate segmentation of periodic acid-Schiff-stained kidney tissue. Salvi et al.  proposed a strategy combining the accuracy of a level-set with the semantic segmentation of U-Net to detect the glomeruli and tubules contours in histopathological images. Many new medical image segmentation networks used U-Net as their base architecture and tried to improve it. Zhou et al.  introduced U-Net++ and extended skip connections by adding more convolutions into them. Applying a combination of recurrent and residual blocks into a U-Net architecture resulted in R2U-Net, which can benefit from the advantages of residual and recurrent blocks. Although both methods outperform U-Net, they are more complicated and more challenging to train when data is limited. Roy et al. improved U-Net by applying the attention concept in the decoder part. In PSPNet [ref]26 and Deeplabv3+  first feature maps are generated by a known CNN such as ResNet . In PSPNet [ref]26, a pyramid pooling module suggested to make hierarchical layers of information by using different sizes of convolution. This module combines feature maps under different pyramid scales. The outputs of convolution and upsampling layers concatenated with initial feature maps to generate segmentation map. Pyramid pooling module creates feature maps with diverse resolutions. Deeplabv3+  is based on PSPNet being at the end of encoder Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is employed. ASPP is a pyramid pooling module using atrous convolution  opposite of simple convolution. Atrous convolution is a useful tool for semantic segmentation because of effective upsampling. Although both PSPNet and Deeplabv3+ work well for semantic segmentation, limited data for training could be a challenge for them. Histopathology is used to detect adverse effects on male reproduction . During spermatogenesis, stem cells (spermatogonia) constantly divide in a dynamic organised process, resulting in motile haploid spermatozoa. It is known that various steps in spermatogenesis are affected by environmental pollutants , but the complexity of testicular tissue makes histopathological evaluation difficult and time-consuming  . Image analysis has been discussed recently as a future necessary tool in quantitative evaluation of histopathology to overcome the subjectivity of manual evaluation and accelerate the process . When assessing tissue damage, seminiferous epithelium needs to be classified into different stages to detect certain cell damages; but stage identification is a demanding task. Segmentation of the tubular epithelium is an essential first step in automated evaluation and staging of tubules and to the best of our knowledge no segmentation method has been suggested for this purpose. Here we suggest a novel method to segment tubular epithelium of testicular tissue in various animal species.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: pathology  .
