We denote B≍B~asymptotically-equals𝐵~𝐵B\\asymp\\widetilde{B} if there exist constants c1,c2>0subscript𝑐1subscript𝑐20c_{1},c_{2}>0 such that c1​B~<B≤c2​B~subscript𝑐1~𝐵𝐵subscript𝑐2~𝐵c_{1}\\widetilde{B}<B\\leq c_{2}\\widetilde{B}. Recall n𝑛n is the sample size and T𝑇T is the iteration number.\nWe will consider different problem settings: convex and smooth cases, nonconvex and smooth cases, and weakly convex cases. All the proofs in this subsection can be found in Section D. We will give applications to adaptive gradient descent in Section E, and differentially private SGD in Section F. Convex and Nonsmooth Problems.\nIn Proposition 5.1, we show SGD applied to convex and nonsmooth problems can imply the excess population risk bounds O​(n−13)𝑂superscript𝑛13O(n^{-\\frac{1}{3}}) with O​(n23)𝑂superscript𝑛23O(n^{\\frac{2}{3}}) iterations. The algorithm is computationally efficient in the sense that SGD with T≍n23asymptotically-equals𝑇superscript𝑛23T\\asymp n^{\\frac{2}{3}} iterations can at most imply optimization error bounds O​(1/T)=O​(n−13)𝑂1𝑇𝑂superscript𝑛13O(1/\\sqrt{T})=O(n^{-\\frac{1}{3}}). Therefore, our analysis implies excess risk bounds of the same order of optimization error bounds with the same computation complexity. There is no additional cost by going from optimization to generalization if we run O​(n23)𝑂superscript𝑛23O(n^{\\frac{2}{3}}) iterations. This proposition is not a main result since our focus is on nonconvex case. We present it just as a byproduct. Recall 𝐰∗superscript𝐰\\mathbf{w}^{*} is a minimizer of the population risk F𝐹F and we assume ‖𝐰∗‖2subscriptnormsuperscript𝐰2\\|\\mathbf{w}^{*}\\|_{2} is finite. Let {𝐰t}tsubscriptsubscript𝐰𝑡𝑡\\{\\mathbf{w}_{t}\\}_{t} be the sequence produced by SGD and 𝔼​[‖∇f​(𝐰t;zit)‖22]≤G2𝔼delimited-[]superscriptsubscriptnorm∇𝑓subscript𝐰𝑡subscript𝑧subscript𝑖𝑡22superscript𝐺2\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\nabla f(\\mathbf{w}_{t};z_{i_{t}})\\|_{2}^{2}]\\leq G^{2} for all t∈[T]𝑡delimited-[]𝑇t\\in[T].

We compare Proposition 5.1 with existing results. The following excess risk bounds of SGD without smoothness assumptions were established  [ref]3 By setting T≍n2asymptotically-equals𝑇superscript𝑛2T\\asymp n^{2} and η≍T−34​‖𝐰∗‖2/Gasymptotically-equals𝜂superscript𝑇34subscriptnormsuperscript𝐰2𝐺\\eta\\asymp T^{-\\frac{3}{4}}\\|\\mathbf{w}^{*}\\|_{2}/G, the above bound implies the excess risk bounds 𝔼S,A​[F​(𝐰¯T)]−F​(𝐰∗)=O​(G​‖𝐰∗‖2​n−12)subscript𝔼𝑆𝐴delimited-[]𝐹subscript¯𝐰𝑇𝐹superscript𝐰𝑂𝐺subscriptnormsuperscript𝐰2superscript𝑛12\\mathbb{E}_{S,A}[F(\\bar{\\mathbf{w}}_{T})]-F(\\mathbf{w}^{*})=O(G\\|\\mathbf{w}^{*}\\|_{2}n^{-\\frac{1}{2}}). As a comparison, our analysis implies the bounds O​((G​‖𝐰∗‖2+B)​n−13)𝑂𝐺subscriptnormsuperscript𝐰2𝐵superscript𝑛13O((G\\|\\mathbf{w}^{*}\\|_{2}+B)n^{-\\frac{1}{3}}). However, the bound (5.2) requires O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}) iterations to achieve this optimal risk bounds, which is computationally expensive. As a comparison, our analysis requires O​(n23​G​‖𝐰∗‖2/B)𝑂superscript𝑛23𝐺subscriptnormsuperscript𝐰2𝐵O(n^{\\frac{2}{3}}G\\|\\mathbf{w}^{*}\\|_{2}/B) iterations to achieve the bound O​((G​‖𝐰∗‖2+B)​n−13)𝑂𝐺subscriptnormsuperscript𝐰2𝐵superscript𝑛13O((G\\|\\mathbf{w}^{*}\\|_{2}+B)n^{-\\frac{1}{3}}). To achieve the bound O​(G​‖𝐰∗‖2​n−13)𝑂𝐺subscriptnormsuperscript𝐰2superscript𝑛13O(G\\|\\mathbf{w}^{*}\\|_{2}n^{-\\frac{1}{3}}), the existing analysis  [ref]3 requires to run SGD with O​(n43)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{\\frac{4}{3}}) iterations. Indeed, the right-hand-side of (5.2) is at least of the order of\nO​(G2​T​η+‖𝐰∗‖22/(T​η))≥O​(G​‖𝐰∗‖2​T−14).𝑂superscript𝐺2𝑇𝜂superscriptsubscriptnormsuperscript𝐰22𝑇𝜂𝑂𝐺subscriptnormsuperscript𝐰2superscript𝑇14O\\big{(}G^{2}\\sqrt{T}\\eta+\\|\\mathbf{w}^{*}\\|_{2}^{2}/(T\\eta)\\big{)}\\geq O(G\\|\\mathbf{w}^{*}\\|_{2}T^{-\\frac{1}{4}}).\nSetting T−14=n−13superscript𝑇14superscript𝑛13T^{-\\frac{1}{4}}=n^{-\\frac{1}{3}} gives the complexity requirement T=n43𝑇superscript𝑛43T=n^{\\frac{4}{3}}, which is larger than the iteration complexity n23​G​‖𝐰∗‖2/Bsuperscript𝑛23𝐺subscriptnormsuperscript𝐰2𝐵n^{\\frac{2}{3}}G\\|\\mathbf{w}^{*}\\|_{2}/B in Proposition 5.1.

[ref]3. The discussion in Bassily et al. [ref]3 requires a Lipschitz assumption and imply high-probability bounds, while we require the assumption 𝔼​[‖∇f​(𝐰t;zit)‖22]≤G2𝔼delimited-[]superscriptsubscriptnorm∇𝑓subscript𝐰𝑡subscript𝑧subscript𝑖𝑡22superscript𝐺2\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\nabla f(\\mathbf{w}_{t};z_{i_{t}})\\|_{2}^{2}]\\leq G^{2} and derive bounds in expectation. Furthermore, a tight lower bound on the stability is developed in Bassily et al. [ref]3. Excess risk bounds of the order O​(G​‖𝐰∗‖2​n−13​log⁡n)𝑂𝐺subscriptnormsuperscript𝐰2superscript𝑛13𝑛O(G\\|\\mathbf{w}^{*}\\|_{2}n^{-\\frac{1}{3}}\\log n) were also established for SGD based on the uniform convergence approach [ref]36. Their discussions consider kernel methods and would imply dimension-dependent bounds if applied to general nonlinear models. As a comparison, our stability analysis always yields dimension-free bounds. Nonconvex and Smooth Problems.\nWe now consider the performance of SGD for nonconvex and smooth problems. In the remainder, we always let r𝑟r be randomly selected from the uniform distribution over [T]delimited-[]𝑇[T]. We show SGD with O​(n23)𝑂superscript𝑛23O(n^{\\frac{2}{3}}) iterations achieves the population gradient bound 𝔼S,A,r​[‖∇F​(𝐰r)‖2]=O​(n−16)subscript𝔼𝑆𝐴𝑟delimited-[]subscriptnorm∇𝐹subscript𝐰𝑟2𝑂superscript𝑛16\\mathbb{E}_{S,A,r}\\big{[}\\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{w}_{r})\\|_{2}\\big{]}=O(n^{-\\frac{1}{6}}). Again, this result shows considering generalization does not bring additional computation cost since SGD with T≍n23asymptotically-equals𝑇superscript𝑛23T\\asymp n^{\\frac{2}{3}} iterations is only guaranteed to achieve empirical gradient bounds 𝔼S,A,r​[‖∇FS​(𝐰r)‖2]=O​(n−16)subscript𝔼𝑆𝐴𝑟delimited-[]subscriptnorm∇subscript𝐹𝑆subscript𝐰𝑟2𝑂superscript𝑛16\\mathbb{E}_{S,A,r}\\big{[}\\|\\nabla F_{S}(\\mathbf{w}_{r})\\|_{2}\\big{]}=O(n^{-\\frac{1}{6}}) . That is, with n23superscript𝑛23n^{\\frac{2}{3}} iterations, our population gradient bounds match the existing empirical gradient bounds. Let {𝐰t}tsubscriptsubscript𝐰𝑡𝑡\\{\\mathbf{w}_{t}\\}_{t} be produced by SGD with ηt=ηsubscript𝜂𝑡𝜂\\eta_{t}=\\eta and 𝔼​[‖∇f​(𝐰t;zit)‖22]≤G2𝔼delimited-[]superscriptsubscriptnorm∇𝑓subscript𝐰𝑡subscript𝑧subscript𝑖𝑡22superscript𝐺2\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\nabla f(\\mathbf{w}_{t};z_{i_{t}})\\|_{2}^{2}]\\leq G^{2} for all t∈[T]𝑡delimited-[]𝑇t\\in[T].\nIf A​(S)=𝐰r𝐴𝑆subscript𝐰𝑟A(S)=\\mathbf{w}_{r}, FSsubscript𝐹𝑆F_{S} is L𝐿L-smooth and then If T≍n23/G23,η≍1/(G​T)formulae-sequenceasymptotically-equals𝑇superscript𝑛23superscript𝐺23asymptotically-equals𝜂1𝐺𝑇T\\asymp n^{\\frac{2}{3}}/G^{\\frac{2}{3}},\\eta\\asymp 1/(G\\sqrt{T}), we get 𝔼​[‖∇F​(𝐰r)‖2]=O​(G23​n−16)𝔼delimited-[]subscriptnorm∇𝐹subscript𝐰𝑟2𝑂superscript𝐺23superscript𝑛16\\mathbb{E}\\big{[}\\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{w}_{r})\\|_{2}\\big{]}=O(G^{\\frac{2}{3}}n^{-\\frac{1}{6}}). We compare our bounds with existing results. For nonconvex, smooth and Lipschitz loss functions, the uniform stability bound of order O​(n−1​TL​cL​c+1)𝑂superscript𝑛1superscript𝑇𝐿𝑐𝐿𝑐1O(n^{-1}T^{\\frac{Lc}{Lc+1}}) was established for SGD with ηt≤c/tsubscript𝜂𝑡𝑐𝑡\\eta_{t}\\leq c/t . While this analysis gives nontrivial bounds on the generalization gap, the proposed step size is small to enjoy a good decay of optimization errors. Indeed, with this step size one can only derive optimization error bounds 𝔼S,A,r​[‖∇FS​(𝐰r)‖2]=O​(1/log⁡T)subscript𝔼𝑆𝐴𝑟delimited-[]subscriptnorm∇subscript𝐹𝑆subscript𝐰𝑟2𝑂1𝑇\\mathbb{E}_{S,A,r}\\big{[}\\|\\nabla F_{S}(\\mathbf{w}_{r})\\|_{2}\\big{]}=O(1/\\log T). One cannot trade-off the generalization bounds O​(n−1​TL​cL​c+1)𝑂superscript𝑛1superscript𝑇𝐿𝑐𝐿𝑐1O(n^{-1}T^{\\frac{Lc}{Lc+1}}) and optimization error bounds O​(1/log⁡T)𝑂1𝑇O(1/\\log T) for a non-vacuous population gradient bound. Indeed, to get a non-vacuous bound, one requires T=O​(nL​c+1L​c)𝑇𝑂superscript𝑛𝐿𝑐1𝐿𝑐T=O(n^{\\frac{Lc+1}{Lc}}). However, in this case the optimization error bounds become O​(1/log⁡n)𝑂1𝑛O(1/\\log n), which are very slow. As a comparison, our discussion suggests a step size ηt≍n−13asymptotically-equalssubscript𝜂𝑡superscript𝑛13\\eta_{t}\\asymp n^{-\\frac{1}{3}} for a significantly better population risk bound O​(n−16)𝑂superscript𝑛16O(n^{-\\frac{1}{6}}). We should mention that the discussion in Hardt et al.  considers the stability in function values, while we consider stability in gradients. High probability bounds on a weighted average of ‖∇F​(𝐰t)‖22superscriptsubscriptnorm∇𝐹subscript𝐰𝑡22\\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{w}_{t})\\|_{2}^{2} were developed in Lei and Tang . Their discussions use a uniform convergence approach and therefore admits a square-root dependency on the dimensionality. As a comparison, Proposition 5.3 yields dimension-free bounds. We can improve population gradient bounds under a strong growth condition (SGC),\nwhich connects the rates at which the stochastic gradients shrink to the full gradient . We say SGC holds if\n1n​∑i=1n[‖∇f​(𝐰;zi)‖22]≤ρ​‖∇FS​(𝐰)‖22.1𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛delimited-[]superscriptsubscriptnorm∇𝑓𝐰subscript𝑧𝑖22𝜌superscriptsubscriptnorm∇subscript𝐹𝑆𝐰22\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}[\\|\\nabla f(\\mathbf{w};z_{i})\\|_{2}^{2}]\\leq\\rho\\|\\nabla F_{S}(\\mathbf{w})\\|_{2}^{2}. Proposition 5.6 shows that the learning performance improves under the SGC condition. Assume for all z𝑧z, the function 𝐰↦f​(𝐰;z)maps-to𝐰𝑓𝐰𝑧\\mathbf{w}\\mapsto f(\\mathbf{w};z) is L𝐿L-smooth and SGC holds. Let {𝐰t}tsubscriptsubscript𝐰𝑡𝑡\\{\\mathbf{w}_{t}\\}_{t} be produced by SGD with ηt=1/(ρ​L)subscript𝜂𝑡1𝜌𝐿\\eta_{t}=1/(\\rho L) and suppose 𝔼S,A​[‖∇f​(𝐰t;zit)‖22]≤G2subscript𝔼𝑆𝐴delimited-[]superscriptsubscriptnorm∇𝑓subscript𝐰𝑡subscript𝑧subscript𝑖𝑡22superscript𝐺2\\mathbb{E}_{S,A}[\\|\\nabla f(\\mathbf{w}_{t};z_{i_{t}})\\|_{2}^{2}]\\leq G^{2} for all t∈[T]𝑡delimited-[]𝑇t\\in[T].\nIf A​(S)=𝐰r𝐴𝑆subscript𝐰𝑟A(S)=\\mathbf{w}_{r}, T≍L​ρ​n/Gasymptotically-equals𝑇𝐿𝜌𝑛𝐺T\\asymp\\sqrt{L\\rho n}/G and then 𝔼S,A​[‖∇F​(𝐰r)‖2]=O​((L​ρ​G2/n)14)subscript𝔼𝑆𝐴delimited-[]subscriptnorm∇𝐹subscript𝐰𝑟2𝑂superscript𝐿𝜌superscript𝐺2𝑛14\\mathbb{E}_{S,A}\\big{[}\\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{w}_{r})\\|_{2}\\big{]}=O((L\\rho G^{2}/n)^{\\frac{1}{4}}). Weakly Convex Problems.\nFinally, we consider weakly convex problems. Note we impose a bounded subgradient assumption 𝔼​[‖∇f​(𝐰t;zit)‖22]≤G2𝔼delimited-[]superscriptsubscriptnorm∇𝑓subscript𝐰𝑡subscript𝑧subscript𝑖𝑡22superscript𝐺2\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\nabla f(\\mathbf{w}_{t};z_{i_{t}})\\|_{2}^{2}]\\leq G^{2} as in Davis and Drusvyatskiy [ref]11. In the appendix G, we will relax this assumption as 𝔼​[‖∇f​(𝐰t;zit)‖22]≤B1​𝔼​[f​(𝐰t;zit)]+B2𝔼delimited-[]superscriptsubscriptnorm∇𝑓subscript𝐰𝑡subscript𝑧subscript𝑖𝑡22subscript𝐵1𝔼delimited-[]𝑓subscript𝐰𝑡subscript𝑧subscript𝑖𝑡subscript𝐵2\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\nabla f(\\mathbf{w}_{t};z_{i_{t}})\\|_{2}^{2}]\\leq B_{1}\\mathbb{E}[f(\\mathbf{w}_{t};z_{i_{t}})]+B_{2} for some B1,B2>0subscript𝐵1subscript𝐵20B_{1},B_{2}>0 and derive the corresponding convergence rates of SGD. To our knowledge, this convergence analysis under the relaxed condition is new for SGD with weakly convex problems. Let {𝐰t}tsubscriptsubscript𝐰𝑡𝑡\\{\\mathbf{w}_{t}\\}_{t} be given by SGD with ηt=ηsubscript𝜂𝑡𝜂\\eta_{t}=\\eta and A​(S)=𝐰r𝐴𝑆subscript𝐰𝑟A(S)=\\mathbf{w}_{r}. Assume 𝔼S,A​[‖∇f​(𝐰t;zit)‖22]≤G2,𝔼A​[‖A​(S)‖2|n∈I​(A)]≤Rformulae-sequencesubscript𝔼𝑆𝐴delimited-[]superscriptsubscriptnorm∇𝑓subscript𝐰𝑡subscript𝑧subscript𝑖𝑡22superscript𝐺2subscript𝔼𝐴delimited-[]conditionalsubscriptnorm𝐴𝑆2𝑛𝐼𝐴𝑅\\mathbb{E}_{S,A}[\\|\\nabla f(\\mathbf{w}_{t};z_{i_{t}})\\|_{2}^{2}]\\leq G^{2},\\mathbb{E}_{A}[\\|A(S)\\|_{2}|n\\in I(A)]\\leq R.\nIf FSsubscript𝐹𝑆F_{S} is ρ𝜌\\rho-weakly convex, then If T≍n23/(R23​ρ13)asymptotically-equals𝑇superscript𝑛23superscript𝑅23superscript𝜌13T\\asymp n^{\\frac{2}{3}}/(R^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\rho^{\\frac{1}{3}}) and η≍1/(G​ρ​T)asymptotically-equals𝜂1𝐺𝜌𝑇\\eta\\asymp 1/(G\\sqrt{\\rho T}), we get 𝔼​[‖∇F1/(2​ρ)​(𝐰r)‖2]=O​(G​ρ13​R16/n16)𝔼delimited-[]subscriptnorm∇subscript𝐹12𝜌subscript𝐰𝑟2𝑂𝐺superscript𝜌13superscript𝑅16superscript𝑛16\\mathbb{E}\\big{[}\\|\\nabla F_{1/(2\\rho)}(\\mathbf{w}_{r})\\|_{2}\\big{]}=O(\\sqrt{G}\\rho^{\\frac{1}{3}}R^{\\frac{1}{6}}/n^{\\frac{1}{6}}). For weakly convex problems, the convergence rate was established for SGD with T𝑇T iterations [ref]11. This result is impressive since neither the Moreau envelope nor the proximal map of FSsubscript𝐹𝑆F_{S} explicitly appear in the implementation of SGD. This result shows the behavior of SGD on training examples, which we extend to the generalization behavior of SGD on testing examples. Note our analysis requires to set T≍n23asymptotically-equals𝑇superscript𝑛23T\\asymp n^{\\frac{2}{3}} and therefore can only imply the bound of the order O​((G​ρ)13​n−16)𝑂superscript𝐺𝜌13superscript𝑛16O((G\\rho)^{\\frac{1}{3}}n^{-\\frac{1}{6}}). It would be interesting to further improve the risk bound here. Population risk bounds of gradient descent were recently studied for weakly convex problems  . Their discussions require the weak convexity parameter to be sufficiently small for meaningful generalization. As a comparison, our discussion does not require this assumption. Furthermore, their discussions consider smooth problems with Lipshictz continuous Hessians and focus on gradient descent , while our discussions apply to SGD with nonsmooth problems.\n A drawback of our stability analysis is that it requires T=o​(n)𝑇𝑜𝑛T=o(n) to get non-vacuous stability bounds, and therefore can only imply suboptimal generalization bounds. Better generalization bounds can be obtained for one-pass SGD by applying the standard online-to-batch technique   to the existing optimization error bounds  [ref]11. For the one-pass SGD, each training example is used only once and then there is no necessity to consider the generalization issues. Our algorithm differs from the one-pass SGD since it is possible that a single training example is selected several times even if T=o​(n)𝑇𝑜𝑛T=o(n), and then there is still a need to consider the generalization issues. How to improve the stability analysis for nonconvex SGD in the case T>n𝑇𝑛T>n remains an interesting open question.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: We compare Proposition 5.1 with existing results.
