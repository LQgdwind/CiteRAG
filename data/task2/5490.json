Conventional channel estimation methods are the least-squares (LS) and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) approaches . However, with the development of modern communication systems, the LS method cannot achieve precise estimation and the implementation of the MMSE method is challenging as the perfect and complete channel statistics cannot be accessed accurately in advance. Moreover, conventional channel estimation solutions  [ref]5 also cannot achieve sufficient performance. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence is impacting on the optimization and configuration of 6G [ref]6. It motivates the researchers in the field of wireless channel estimation to explore neural network solutions for improved performance   [ref]9 0. Compared with the conventional methods which aim to find the closed-form expression, neural network methods are typical data-driven methods aiming for a satisfactory and local optimum solution. ChannelNet , ReEsNet [ref]9 and Interpolation-ResNet 0 are recently published neural networks for wireless channel estimation. The success of the attention mechanism has been demonstrated in recent years 1. Attention-based solutions have significant advantages over conventional neural networks, particularly with the release of the transformer 2. BERT 3 is a transformer-based pre-trained model for language processing and has proved to be efficient and effective. Compared with the convolutional neural networks, the vision transformer 4 also has superior performance. The attention mechanism is also investigated to improve the performance for wireless channel estimation in 5 6 7. The paper 8 exploits the transformer for the improved channel estimation. Reference 9 introduces non-local attention 0 to achieve the channel estimation for MIMO-OFDM system. A graph attention network is utilized in 1 for the reconfigurable intelligent surface-assisted communications. An encoder-decoder architecture is also proposed in 2 by deploying the attention mechanism and the papers 3 4 also use the attention mechanism. However, for the practical communication system, neural network channel estimation faces severe problems when implemented in the real world.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: and the implementation of the MMSE method is challenging as the perfect and complete channel statistics cannot be accessed accurately in advance.
