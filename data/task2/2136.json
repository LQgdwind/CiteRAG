      "content": "Paper Title: Predicting Deep Neural Network Generalization with Perturbation Response Curves\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe PGDL competition resulted in several proposals of complexity measures that aim to predict neural network generalization gaps.\nWhile several submissions build off the work of [ref]4 and rely on margin-based measures, we will focus on those submissions that measure perturbation response, specifically to Mixup, since this is most relevant to our work.\nMixup, first introduced in , is a novel training paradigm in which training occurs not just on the given training data, but also on linearly interpolated points.\nManifold Mixup training extends this idea to interpolation of intermediate network representations . Perhaps most closely related to our work is that of the winning submission, [ref]6.\nWhile [ref]6 presents several proposed complexity measures, the authors explore accuracy on Mixup and Manifold Mixup training sets as potential predictors of generalization gap, and performance on mixed up data is one of the inputs into their winning submission.\nWhile this closely resembles our work, in that the authors are using performance on a perturbed dataset, namely a mixed up one, the key difference is that [ref]6 only investigates a network’s response to a single magnitude of interpolation, 0.5.\nAdditionally, we investigate between-class interpolation as well, while [ref]6 only interpolates between data points or intermediate representations within a class, not between classes.\nOur proposed Gi-score and Pal-score therefore provide a much more robust sense for how invariant a network is to this mixing up perturbation and can easily be applied to other perturbations as well. In the vein of exploring various transformations / perturbations, the second place submission [ref]7 performs various augmentations, such as color saturation, applying Sobel filters, cropping and resizing, and others, to create a composite penalty score based on how a network performs on these perturbed data points.\nOur work, in addition to achieving better generalizatiton gap prediction scores, can be thought of as an extension of [ref]7, because as above, rather than looking at a single perturbation level, the Gi-score and Pal-score provide a summary of how a model reacts to a spectrum of parameterized perturbations. In this work, we also extend our proposed Gi and Pal-scores to predict generalization performance on different data transformations.\n shows that even for architectures that have inductive biases that should render a network invariant to certain perturbations, in practice these networks are not actually invariant due to how they are trained.\nThis is true when data augmentation is not carefully employed , which highlights the need for our predicting invariance line of work.\nUnlike works, such as , that measure how individual layer and neuron outputs respond to input perturbations, e.g., rotation, translation, and color-jittering, we measure how a network’s overall accuracy responds to the these perturbations and compare that to an idealized network that is fully invariant.\nConsistent prediction on invariant data transformations is a desired property for neural networks  and it has been widely used as a data augmentation or regularization tool during training for improving generalization . Our scores are inspired by the Gini coefficient and Palma ratio - most commonly used in economics as measures of income inequality    .\nIn economics, the Gini coefficient measures income inequality by ordering a population by income and plotting the percentage of the total national income on the vertical axis vs. the percentage of the population total on the horizontal axis.\nFor an idealized economy, wealth distribution lies on a 45∘superscript4545^{\\circ} line from the origin, which means each percent of the population holds the same percentage of wealth.\nPlotting this distribution for an actual economy allows for the calculation of the Gini coefficient by taking a ratio of the area between the idealized and actual economy wealth distribution curves and the total area below the idealized economy’s curve.\nThe Palma ratio is also calculated from this plot by taking a ratio of some top x%percent𝑥x\\% of the population’s wealth (area below the actual economy’s curve) divided by that of some bottom y%.percent𝑦y\\%. In addition to income inequality, the Gini coefficient has been used in a wide variety of applications in different domains, e.g, measuring biodiversity in ecology , quality of life in health , and protein selectivity in chemistry .\nIt is also used in machine learning for measuring classification performance, as twice the area between the ROC curve (curve of false positive rate vs. true positive rate for varying classifier threshold) and the diagonal   and has also been used as a criteria for feature selection .\nOur approach is the first to use this metric together with our PR curve framework for measuring generalization, as well as to use the Pal-score in a machine learning setting.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: The PGDL competition resulted in several proposals of complexity measures that aim to predict neural network generalization gaps.\nWhile several submissions build off the work of [ref]4 and rely on margin-based measures, we will focus on those submissions that measure perturbation response, specifically to Mixup, since this is most relevant to our work.\nMixup, first\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
