      "content": "Paper Title: PointOcc: Cylindrical Tri-Perspective View for Point-based 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAccurately and comprehensively perceiving the 3D environment is a crucial aspect of the autonomous driving system.\nWith the ability to actively detect the 3D structural information of a scene, LiDAR has become the mainstream sensor for most autonomous driving vehicles, where LiDAR-based models have dominated most of the main perception tasks for autonomous driving, including 3D object detection   , semantic segmentation   , and object tracking   6 . LiDAR semantic segmentation plays an important role in autonomous driving perception with the objective to predict the category of each point.\nOne straightforward way is to use discretized voxels to represent point clouds and perform 3D operations on the voxels    9.\nConsidering the sparse nature of the LiDAR point clouds, some other LiDAR segmentation methods first perform 2D projection on the point clouds to obtain range images or bird’s eye view (BEV) images as inputs to 2D backbones  [ref]30  [ref]1 4.\nThough fast in speed, they usually underperform the voxel-based methods due to the information loss of the 3D-to-2D projection and require expensive post-processing to restore the 3D structure  [ref]30 [ref]1.\nOn the other hand, the semantic segmentation of sparse point clouds can only provide partial semantic descriptions of the 3D surroundings and cannot generalize well to arbitrary-shaped obstacles, which is the key to the safety of autonomous driving vehicles.\nTherefore, the autonomous driving community has recently shifted its focus to the 3D semantic occupancy prediction problem  [ref]37   , which aims to simultaneously predict the occupancy and semantic label of each voxel in the surrounding 3D space.\nIt is not trivial to adapt existing 2D-projection-based methods to 3D semantic occupancy prediction due to its dense output space. In this paper, we propose PointOcc, an efficient 2D-projection-based model that can be applied to 3D semantic occupancy prediction without any requirement for post-processing and achieves even better results than 3D models, as shown in Figure 1.\nMotivated by the TPVFormer  for vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction, we represent the 3D scene using three 2D planes, each of which provides descriptions from one perspective.\nWhile TPVFormer employs three perpendicular planes in the Cartesian coordinate system, we empirically find that they cannot well describe the LiDAR point clouds due to the non-uniform distribution of point clouds (i.e., the sparsity of the points depends on their distances to the ego car).\nTherefore, we propose a cylindrical tri-perspective view (Cylindrical TPV) as a novel and effective representation of point clouds, which constructs TPV in the cylindrical coordinate system.\nCylindrical TPV naturally assigns nearer areas with a larger resolution and thus is suitable for LiDAR point clouds.\nTo transform point clouds into Cylindrical TPV, we employ spatial group pooling to project point clouds to each of the TPV planes with better preservation of 3D information.\nHaving obtained the TPV planes, we can adopt any 2D backbones to perceive them without expensive 3D operations.\nFinally, we model each point (or voxel) in the 3D space by summing its projected features on each of the processed planes.\nWe then use a simple classification head to classify each 3D point feature without any need for post-processing.\nThough each Cylindrical TPV plane can only provide a 2D description, they represent a 3D scene from complementary perspectives and collaborate to comprehensively model 3D information. We conducted extensive experiments on the OpenOccupancy [ref]37 benchmark for 3D semantic occupancy prediction and the Panoptic nuScenes  benchmark for LiDAR segmentation.\nWe find that despite sharing the fast speed of 2D-projection-based methods, PointOcc can readily benefit from 2D-pretrained image backbones to achieve even better performance than the less efficient voxel-based methods.\nOur PointOcc outperforms all other 2D-projection methods  [ref]30 [ref]1 on the LiDAR segmentation task and is comparable to voxel-based methods 1 0 3 without any post-processing.\nAs the first 2D-projection-based method on the 3D semantic occupancy prediction task, PointOcc significantly outperforms all other methods by a large margin with a much faster speed.\nDespite only using LiDAR as inputs, PointOcc is even better than the best multi-modal (LiDAR & Camera) method [ref]37 by 4.6 IoU and 3.8 mIoU, demonstrating its advantage and potential.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: of the LiDAR point clouds, some other LiDAR segmentation methods first perform 2D projection on the point clouds to obtain range images or bird’s eye view (BEV) images as inputs to 2D backbones  [ref]30  [ref]1 4.\nThough fast in speed, they usually underperform the voxel-based methods due to the information loss of the 3D-to-2D projection and require expensive post-processing to restore the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
