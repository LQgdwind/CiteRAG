      "content": "Paper Title: Gotcha: Real-Time Video Deepfake Detection via Challenge-Response\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur work is related to several topics. We describe where we intersect and where we differ with each of them: Deepfake Detection. In recent years, automatic deepfake detection has burgeoned due to an arms race with deepfake generators. They target tell-tale artifacts such as distinct patterns in the frequency domain [ref]10, eye features [ref]11, inner & outer facial features [ref]12, expressions , and biological signals. Notably, Vahdati et al.  detect real-time facial reenactment deepfakes by calculating errors caused by inconsistent facial landmarks between the driving video and a frame reconstruction of the speaker. Despite competition against generators and the constant threat of becoming obsolete, several methods are technically impressive. Hence, extending them to real-time detection of an incoming feed is possible. We found that in practice, however, existing automatic detectors are limited; they too are prone to the same impediments that the generators suffer from and more, namely, poor dataset quality, inconsistent pre-processing, computational resource constraints, and susceptibility to adversarial perturbations (§2). These observations were corroborated by prior work suggesting that these models learn non-interpretable, spurious features   . We also empirically confirm that well-known detectors   performed unreliably on our dataset (§5.2). Gotcha is not a deepfake detector; rather, it is a way to strengthen deepfake detection using challenges and can make more confident detection decisions. Human Deepfake Evaluators. To provide a baseline for comparison, some studies evaluate performance of humans in detecting deepfakes. Groh et al.  conducted an online study with 15,016 participants and concluded that detectors and humans perform overall comparably, with 82% of humans outperforming the leading detector. Also, when they work together, automated detectors boost human performance. In follow-up work, when Josephs et al.  amplified deepfake artifacts, human accuracy and confidence improved, indicating that humans are good at detecting artifacts if they are discernible and are within their reaction speed. Gotcha’s challenges take priority to make the deepfake artifacts human-visible. Challenge-Response-based Authentication Systems.\nLiveness Detection.\nUzun et al.  used challenge-response to detect whether a user is live or not by asking a caller to read out a random text, then verify that (1) they read the correct text and (2) matches their voice and face against a pre-enrolled user. As deepfakes have evolved into being real-time, an imposter can trivially bypass the first verification step. Biometric Authentication. Sluganovic et al.  track saccade movements after a marker pops on the screen and compares the movement with those of the enrolled user. However, Gotcha does not require extensive biometric enrollment and works under a stronger threat model. Real-time Deepfakes. Yasur et al.  addressed deepfake detection on audio calls using a similar approach and created their challenges, such as clapping, coughing, and playback, based on four constraints – realism, identity, task, and time. They evaluated their challenges on five audio deepfake generators using a private dataset, ASVspoof21  and realistic-in-the-wild dataset . They concluded that such challenges degrade audio quality and force the generator to expose itself. Gotcha corroborated their claims but for video calls. Active Illumination  works by projecting hues from the user’s screen and then correlating these with the hue reflected off the user’s face. This approach assumes deepfake systems cannot accurately generate complex hue illuminations in real time. It analyzes the correlation frame-by-frame, with low correlations indicating it is a deepfake and vice-versa. Corneal Reflection , similarly, relies on projecting a specific shape and capturing its reflection in the user’s cornea for verification. The technique assumes that webcams can consistently capture eye details and that deepfake algorithms cannot mimic such reflections convincingly. The above works also address video RTDFs and are example challenges of Gotcha.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Detection.
