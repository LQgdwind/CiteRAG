      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Sequence Packing without Cross-contamination: Accelerating Large Language Models without Impacting Performance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany language datasets, including the de-facto pre-training dataset for BERT—Wikipedia, have a skewed distribution of sequence lengths\n(see Figure 1).\nHowever, typical machine learning accelerators, and their corresponding libraries, exhibit poor performance when processing variable-length workloads.\nA simple mitigation is to set a maximum sequence length, and to pad shorter sequences with padding tokens.\nThis naive batching is widely used and provided in the vanilla BERT implementation\nas well as the Hugging Face framework [ref]32.\nIts effect is enhanced by the offline dataset generation process which,\nin BERT, attempts to “pack” together sentences\nso as to fill the sequence length as completely as possible [ref]8.\nWe improve this process at a whole-dataset level. We show that, even after this pre-processing, padding tokens represent 50%percent5050\\%\nof all tokens of the Wikipedia pre-training dataset at sequence length 512512512.\nThus, by avoiding processing the padding tokens one can get a 2x speed-up for phase 2.\nOverall, the lengths range between 555 tokens up to 512512512.\nSamples of length 512512512 represent only 23.5%percent23.523.5\\% of the dataset, Beyond the simple batching, other solutions have been addressed in the literature,\nand in open-source software implementations.\nWhen processing sequences, most libraries and algorithms mention packing as reference to\nconcatenating sentences\nfrom the same document (BERT)\nor from different documents\n(BERT, T5 , GPT-3 , and RoBERTa ) as they arrive\n(GREEDY)\nfrom the source dataset to generate the training dataset.\nNone of the respective papers addresses the packing efficiency, i.e., remaining fraction of padding.\nTo “separate” sequences from different documents, a separator token is introduced.\nHowever, this is not sufficient and can have a significant impact on performance.\nThis is discussed only in the RoBERTa paper which shows that\ndownstream F1 scores get consistently reduced on average by 0.35%percent0.350.35\\%.\nAlternative common approaches to overcome the large amount of padding in many datasets\nare “un-padding” as in Effective Transformer [ref]5 and\nsorted batching (SORT) as in Faster Transformer ,\nlingvo  fairseq , and RoBERTa.\nHowever, for running efficiently on arbitrary accelerators,\nthese approaches require substantial hardware-specific low-level code optimizations\nonly available on GPUs.\nFurther details are in Sections C  and 4.4. Beyond language models,\npacking has been also present in other areas of machine learning,\nhowever with little to no exploration in the literature\nand mostly hidden in some libraries without any further discussion.\nFor example,\nPyG (PyTorch Geometric)\ncombines multiple small graphs in a batch to account for the large variation in size\nand to optimize the hardware usage when training a Graph Neural Network (GNN).\nAnother example is the\nRNN implementation in PyTorch\nwhich introduces a “PackedSequence”\nobject and states that “All RNN modules accept packed sequences as inputs”\nbut does not address how sequences are packed efficiently and how the processing of packed sequences\nis implemented in an efficient manner while avoiding interaction between sequences.\nEven though we focus on BERT  and other transformers in this paper,\nthe general principles can be transferred to many more machine learning\nalgorithms with differently sized data samples. In this paper, we formally frame the packing problem in transformer based models,\nand provide some solutions,\nshowing that sequences can be packed efficiently, separator tokens are not required,\nand cross-contamination can be avoided with little overhead. In summary, the contributions of the paper are as follows.\nIn Section 2,\nwe produce histograms of a variety of datasets\nshowing the high percentage of padding tokens.\nIn Section 3.1,\nwe present two new deterministic and efficient packing algorithms based on established solvers\nwhich efficiently pack datasets with millions of sequences in a matter of seconds (or less).\nIn Section 3.2 and Section 3.3,\nwe describe ‘cross-contamination’\n—the cause of the accuracy reduction which separator tokens do not mitigate—\nand show\nhow the BERT model can be adjusted\nto show the same convergence behavior on packed and unpacked sequences.\nWe empirically show that the proposed packing algorithms\nproduce a nearly-optimal packing scheme\nfor Wikipedia pre-training dataset (Section 4.1)\nand more in the Appendix.\nIn Section 4.2, we demonstrate that the convergence of the BERT large model\non the packed dataset is\nequivalent to that on\nthe un-packed dataset\nwith 2x throughput increase on the Wikipedia sequence length 512512512 pre-training dataset.\nFurther experiments underline the necessity and efficiency of our changes.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: a maximum sequence length, and to pad shorter sequences with padding tokens.\nThis naive batching is widely used and provided in the vanilla BERT implementation\nas well as the Hugging Face framework [ref]32.\nIts effect is enhanced by the offline dataset generation process which,\nin BERT, attempts to “pack” together sentences\nso as to fill the sequence length as completely as possible [ref]8.\nWe\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
