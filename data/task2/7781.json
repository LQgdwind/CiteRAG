      "content": "Paper Title: Communication-Efficient Training Workload Balancing for Decentralized Multi-Agent Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset. We conduct image classification experiments using three publicly available datasets: CIFAR-10 , CIFAR-100 , and CINIC-10 8.\nWe also consider label distribution skew (i.e., how the distribution of labels varies across agents) to generate non-I.I.D. variants of these datasets. To maintain fairness, we used a fixed Dirichlet distribution (concentration parameter = 0.5) for the non-I.I.D. datasets. Global model performance is assessed using test images after each round. Baselines.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study pioneers the introduction of workload balancing in server-less DML. Although FL methods like FedProx  aim to enhance performance in heterogeneous environments, they rely on a central server, incompatible with our focus on serverless decentralized machine learning. Therefore, we primarily compare ComDML with decentralized baselines: BrainTorrent 0, Gossip Learning , and decentralized AllReduce [ref]34.\nFedAvg , though server-dependent, is included as a baseline for comparing workload balancing.\nBrainTorrent is a peer-to-peer framework where agents take turns acting as the server and updating the global model. Gossip Learning  incorporates model averaging, enabling each agent to update its model based on information received from neighboring agents. In decentralized learning utilizing AllReduce aggregation, agents update their models independently and then employ AllReduce to aggregate them, eliminating the need for a central server. Implementation.\nWe conducted the experiment using Python 3.11.3 and the PyTorch library version 1.13.1. The source code is publicly available online at ComDML‚Äôs GitHub repository . ComDML and baseline models were deployed on a server with the following specifications: dual-socket Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 v4 @ 2.20GHz, four NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPUs, and 64 GB of memory.\nTo replicate the heterogeneity of real-world systems, we designed a heterogeneous simulation environment where agents possess distinct computational and communication capabilities. Each agent is equipped with a simulated CPU and communication resources, mirroring varied computation and communication times. This setup effectively captures the complexities of real-world distributed systems, where agents often differ in their processing power and network connectivity.\nWe simulated agents with CPU profiles spanning 4, 2, 1, 0.5, and 0.2 CPUs. Communication profiles were varied with 0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 Mbps links, with 0 representing disconnected agents. At the beginning of training, each agent was assigned one profile representing its initial computation and communication resources. These resource profiles could dynamically shift throughout the training process, mimicking real-world variations in agents‚Äô resources.\nIn all experiments, we consider simulated communication overhead for training time, including intermediate data transfer and model size.\nBrainTorrent operates through independent model updates followed by aggregation by a randomly selected agent. Gossip learning implementation aligns with .\nFor AllReduce experiments, independent model training is followed by aggregation via AllReduce. Model Architecture.\nComDML can effectively support various models, from Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to large language models (LLMs) like BERT.\nIn our experiments, we used two prominent CNN models: ResNet-56 and ResNet-110 6, which have demonstrated good accuracy on the experimented datasets. To balance computational demands across agents, we partition the global model at varying split layers mùëöm. Slow agents locally update the model up to their designated layer mùëöm, while a fast agent handles the remaining layers. To facilitate local loss training within slow agents, we introduce an auxiliary network comprising a fully connected layer and an average pooling layer. The input dimension of the f.c. layer is adjusted to match the output of each slow agent-side model. Hyper-parameters.\nWe used the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum of 0.9 for all datasets. The initial learning rate (i.e., Œ∑0subscriptùúÇ0\\eta_{0}) was set to 0.001 for all datasets. Upon the accuracy reached a plateau, the learning rate was reduced by a factor of 0.2 when there were 10 agents. For scenarios with 20, 50, and 100 agents, we implemented a reduction factor of 0.5. The local batch size for each agent was set to 100, and the local epoch was consistently set to one for all experiments.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: with our focus on serverless decentralized machine learning. Therefore, we primarily compare ComDML with decentralized baselines: BrainTorrent 0, Gossip Learning , and decentralized AllReduce [ref]34.\nFedAvg , though server-dependent, is included as a baseline for comparing workload balancing.\nBrainTorrent is a peer-to-peer framework where agents take turns acting as the server and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
