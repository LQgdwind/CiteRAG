Identifying and Mitigating Answer Bias in Knowledge Tracing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs the pioneering work of KT, BKT [ref]7 was proposed to utilize a hidden Markov model to represent students’ knowledge states as binary variables, indicating whether a knowledge concept is mastered or not.\nFurthermore, BKT has been extended to incorporate other important factors, such as students’ individual variation in learning [ref]8 and the prerequisite hierarchies among knowledge concepts .\nPavlik et al. [ref]20 took a different approach by directly using logistic functions to predict the probability of correctly answering questions according to the side information about questions and students.\nAnother traditional method of KT is the knowledge tracing machine (KTM) proposed by Vie et al. . KTM is based on factorization machines and generalizes logistic models by capturing pairwise feature interactions. With the rapid development of deep learning, various types of neural networks have been investigated to model the learning sequences of students for KT.\nEarly representative examples include DKT  and DKVMN , which are based on RNN and memory network, respectively.\nDue to the popularity of the attention mechanism , numerous self-attentive models such as SAKT , AKT , and SAINT  have been successively proposed in recent years.\nIn addition, some works considered more elaborate factors related to learning, including the text content of questions , the temporal dynamics of different cross-skill impacts  , the difficulty levels of questions , and the inter-student information .\nLiu et al.  enhanced KT with auxiliary learning tasks, namely the question tagging prediction and individualized prior knowledge prediction. In another research line, incorporating the relationship information between questions or students is a common practice in graph-based deep learning methods for KT .\nFor example, Nakagawa et al.  presented the graph-based knowledge tracing (GKT), which establishes a graph connecting knowledge concepts and models students’ knowledge states using graph convolutional networks .\nTong et al.  proposed the structure-based knowledge tracing (SKT) to discover the knowledge structure of questions and consider the spatial effect on the knowledge structure.\nYang et al.  developed a graph-based interaction model for knowledge tracing (GIKT), which introduces high-order question-concept correlations through embedding propagation. Despite their impressive performance, existing KT models are overly dependent on the answer bias of questions.\nThis dependency seriously limits their generalization ability and impedes their progress in achieving the ultimate objective of understanding students’ knowledge states in KT.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: As the pioneering work of KT, BKT [ref]7 was proposed to utilize a hidden Markov model to represent students’ knowledge states as binary variables, indicating whether a knowledge concept is mastered or not.\nFurthermore, BKT has been\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
