      "content": "Paper Title: Classifying Textual Data with pretrained Vision Models through Transfer Learning and Data Transformations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAttention-based architectures and specifically the Transformer  sparked a revolution in the world of Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning in General. BERT-representations [ref]5 opened a lot of new goals and challenges for the Machine Learning Community, because of their semantically rich embeddings- and the kind of knowledge they encode given textual data. Being pretrained to Masked Language and Next Sentence prediction and on a very large Wikipedia Corpus, makes it a powerful benchmark for Natural Language Processing and a current standard for word and sentence representations. Computer Vision made very remarkable achievements . The groundbreaking work introduced in AlexNet 4 and the parallel structure of Convolutional Neural Networks enabled the use of GPUs, making it a standard for training Neural Networks for Visual Recognition. Different architectures have emerged 4 5    since then using CNN’s as a building block and achieving very high accuracies on different datasets. Transfer Learning   opened the doors for a very wide range of applications, allowing for the exchange of previously acquired knowledge from a large dataset on a certain task to another task with a much smaller dataset. This philosophy is often an essential practice in both academia and industry as it helps avoid a very long and computationally demanding procedure. In visual understanding tasks, transfer learning in the last decade heavily relied on ImageNet  as a base or source dataset, ImageNet  is a large dataset containing over 14 million images with annotations from one-thousand class labels and is often selected for pre-training Vision Models. The work described in this paper aims to use knowledge acquired by vision models to train text-classifiers for Sentiment Analysis, using a t-SNE based transformation method brought about in 8 to transform IMDB Text Embeddings from BERT into gray scale images. The main objective of this paper is to bring language and vision a step closer, and to harness the power of transfer learning from large image datasets in Natural Language Processing and vice-versa. We hope this will encourage further work on the topic using appropriate resources and datasets since none were available during the conception of this paper. We extend the relevant body of work on the integration of language and vision covered in 8 with a complete Transfer Learning-based fusion of these modalities. The main components of our study include: Using the BERT [ref]5 embeddings for the IMDB-Dataset 6 to create\nan IMDB-Image Dataset using the method described in 8 with a t-SNE 3 backbone. Analyzing Domain Shifts between the Source (ImageNet ) and Target (IMDB-Image) datasets, and avoiding such problems with feature normalization. Using early layers from benchmark Vision Models 4 5    which are trained on a huge ImageNet  dataset as feature extractors in a common architecture between five models. Training five models containing layers pretrained on a Vision Dataset(ImageNet ) on the IMDB-Image dataset. The contributions of this paper are stated as follows: Exchanging knowledge between language and vision models through transfer learning\nand data transformations. Generating an image dataset for IMDB textual dataset, avoiding domain shifts between source and target datasets (ImageNet  and IMDB-Images) with pixel normalization. Harnessing the pre-training of vision models on a large image dataset in text classification, and promising results.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Attention-based architectures and specifically the Transformer  sparked a revolution in the world of Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning in General.
