      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Learning for Road Traffic Forecasting: Does it Make a Difference?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe development of the short-term traffic forecasting field began when researchers started to apply time series forecasting methods to characterize traffic congestion measurements . Back then, one popular approach relied on the assumption that the process that generated the traffic time series could be approximated using statistical methods like auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)  . These predictive models were only capable of predicting a single target point of a road map. With the beginning of the new millennium, the complexity of modeling techniques started to increase sharply, unleashing new research opportunities for the traffic forecasting arena. Vlahogianni et al. , who analyzed short-term forecasting literature from 2004 to 2012, brought up that researchers are distancing themselves from what are considered classical statistical methods (i.e. auto-regressive models), drifting towards data-driven approaches . The primary motivation for this shift remains on the ineffectiveness of classical methods to forecast while facing unstable conditions. The nature of the traffic is not stationary or linear, as a manifold of studies have hitherto shown    . Unfortunately, auto-regressive models tend to focus on the average behavior, so peaks and rapid fluctuations are generally missed . Further into the review in , the literature analyzed therein inspected the scope of application, input and output data type, prediction horizon, and proposed technique of publications. Finally, challenges identified in this seminal review stressed out the overabundance of studies focused on freeways and interurban road traffic. Models for urban road traffic data were revealed to be less frequently studied. Furthermore, only a few solutions capable of predicting traffic simultaneously at different locations of the road network were known at the time  [ref]29 , due to the scarcity of open-access traffic data for numerous points in a network, together with the high complexity of solving the interactions between the studied roads of the area. After assimilating the criticism and challenges established in , another survey , published years thereafter, proposed new insights unattended until then. The newer literature review over the 2014-2016 period showed an increase in the number of publications focused on prediction at urban roads, which evinced that the research field covers nowadays most of possible geographic contexts of traffic prediction. Also in connection with the prospects in , there is also an increasing interest within the community in obtaining network-wide predictions, possibly promoted by the improvement in spatial data coverage and computing capacity achieved over the years  . Among other points,  also underscored the need for establishing a unified set of metrics that permit to fairly compare performance between different models. Absolute error metrics provide interpretable values when comparing models for a same dataset, enabling a qualitative analysis of the error, as these express the error into traffic units (for instance, vehicles per hour). However, if the benchmark comprises several traffic datasets, relative error metrics should be considered for proper model comparison. This way the magnitude of the traffic unit does not affect the comparison study. Lastly, this survey highlighted an intrinsic problem of data-driven models: concept drift . Since data-driven models acquire information from large data collections in order to extract traffic patterns and provide accurate predictions, performance is affected by exogenous non-planned events such as accidents, roads works or other circumstantial changes. That same year, Ermagun et al.  analyzed the methodology and proposed methods for capturing spatial information over road networks. Their assumption is that present information of spatial relationships between road nodes should improve short-term predictive model performance. The study, which spans the period 1984-2016, offers an overview of the concerns of researchers in the field: 65.3% of revised works are concentrated on traffic flow, 19.2% speed, and the remaining travel time. Likewise, only 26.5% chose urban zones as the implementation area, whereas the remainder are concentrated at freeways, confirming the postulated trend of Vlahogianni et al. in . Finally, the survey concludes by encouraging the community to portray road networks as graphs , since they ease the representation of inter-nodal relationships and their subsequent use in modeling. To round up this tour on the recent history of the field, in 2019 Angarita et al.  propose a general taxonomy for traffic forecasting data-driven models. The motivation of their work is not only to classify and revise learning models used to date, but also to categorize the approached traffic forecasting problems. In terms of data source type, data granularity, input and output nature, and overall scope. On the other hand, the reviewed models are sorted by pre-processing technique, type of in/out data, and step-ahead prediction. After analyzing the state of the art, they find no data-driven approach that suits all forecasting situations. All the above surveys offer insights into the goals pursued by the field, as well as an outline of the opportunities and challenges that should be addressed in prospective studies. Vlahogianni et al. advocate for data-driven approaches, which were already gaining impulse at the time . Posterior surveys confirmed this trend, and data-driven models prevail nowadays as the preferred option for short-term traffic modeling. The work of Laña et al. concludes that most possible geographic scopes are covered in the state of the art since, in the origins of the short-term traffic forecasting field, there was a shortage of publications based on urban traffic data . In turn, Ermagun et al. grant importance to spatio-temporal relationships between nodes of traffic networks, which is one of the most exploited relationships to extract knowledge in the actual literature . On a closing note, the taxonomy of Angarita et al. in  classifies traffic forecasting publications from a supervised learning perspective, which inspires in part the criteria later adopted in this work.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: data were revealed to be less frequently studied.
