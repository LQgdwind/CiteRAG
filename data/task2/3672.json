      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Scene Flow in 3D Point Clouds with Noisy Pseudo Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset. We conduct experiments on FlyingThings3D¬† and StereoKITTI datasets that are widely used in recent methods e.g. 5    [ref]21 for a fair comparison. In addition, we evaluate our method on a real-world LiDAR dataset. FT3D (FlyingThings3D)¬† is a large-scale synthetic stereo video dataset. The stereo videos are generated by assigning various motions to synthetic objects, where objects are from ShapeNet . Following the preprocessing in  ,\nwe use camera parameters and ground-truth annotations to generate point clouds and ground truth scene flow.\nFor a fair comparison, we randomly sample 8192 points per point cloud and remove points whose depth is larger than 35m, like existing methods [ref]21 5. S-KITTI (StereoKITTI)¬†  is a real-world scene flow dataset generated from stereo cameras.\nFollowing the data preprocessing of HPLFlowNet , we obtain 142 pairs of point clouds using ground-truth disparity maps and optical flows. All these pairs are used for testing, where 8192 points are randomly sampled per point cloud.\nFollowing the setting of existing methods 5  .\nwe remove ground points according to point heights (<‚àí1.4absent1.4<-1.4m). L-KITTI (LidarKITTI) is real-world LiDAR dataset constructed from the raw data of KITTI . L-KITTI consists of point cloud sequences and image sequences captured from multiple scenes, where point clouds are captured by Velodyne 3D laser scanner.\nFollowing [ref]10, we obtain the ground-truth scene flow for only 142 pairs of point clouds, since they correspond to the same scene of S-KITTI.\nWe use these 142 pairs of point clouds for testing. The remaining 8201 pairs of points clouds are used for training, where testing point clouds and their temporally adjacent ones are excluded.\nSimilar to S-KITTI, we remove ground points.\nThe visual patterns of LiDAR point clouds in L-KITTI are rather dissimilar to that in S-KITTI and FT3D, which is challenging for scene flow estimation methods. Evaluation Metrics. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we use four standard evaluation metrics widely used in point-cloud-based scene flow methods 5    [ref]21. We adopt EPE3D (3D end-point-error) as our primary evaluation metric that computes the average L2subscriptùêø2\\mathit{L}_{2} distance between the predicted and GT scene flow in meters, following existing methods such as 1 [ref]10 . We also evaluate accuracy at three threshold levels:\n(1) Acc3DS (strict\naccuracy) that computed the ratio of points whose EPE3D << 0.05m or relative error <<5%.\n(2) Acc3DR (relaxed accuracy) which computes the ratio of points whose EPE3D <<0.10m or relative error <<10%. (3) Outliers that computes the ratio of points whose EPE3D >>0.30m or relative error >>10%. (a) Original point clouds (b) FlowStep3D [ref]21 (c) Ours (d) Ground-truth scene flow (a) Original point clouds (b) Pseudo scene flow (c) Ground truth scene flow Implementation Details.\nOur scene flow network is based on state-of-the-art method FLOT 5, where the feature extractor is replaced by Minkowski-Net , due to its good feature representation in point cloud segmentation 3 and scene flow estimation [ref]10. The voxel size is set to be 0.06m, and Œª=0.25ùúÜ0.25\\lambda=0.25. The detailed architecture of our scene flow network is described in the supplementary.\nOur method can be trained on any unlabeled datasets that contain synchronized monocular RGB images and point clouds. When generating pseudo scene flow labels for point clouds in FT3D dataset, we employ the optical flow estimation model  trained on FlyingChairs  for estimating optical flow, in order to circumvent any ground-truth annotations related to FT3D dataset.\nWe implement our method in Pytorch 4 and employ Adam\noptimization algorithm for training. The learning rate begins with 0.001 for 50 epochs and is then linearly decayed.\nOur model is trained on one NVIDIA V100 with batch size 5.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Dataset.
