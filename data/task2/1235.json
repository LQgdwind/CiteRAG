      "content": "Paper Title: CM-Net: Concentric Mask based Arbitrary-Shaped Text Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExisting text detection methods can be roughly divided into the regression-based methods, segmentation-based methods, and real-time arbitrary-shaped text detection methods. In this section, the related works are reviewed briefly. Regression-Based Text Detection Methods. These approaches were inspired by objection detection frameworks. He e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al. [ref]21 designed a hierarchical inception module to extract the features with strong representation capacities and reduced the interference information from the background. To detect multi-oriented text instances accurately, Liao e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al. [ref]22 designed an angle prediction header to predict the rotation angles between the horizontal anchors and multi-oriented text instances. Although the aforementioned works could effectively detect horizontal and multi-oriented text instances, they still suffered from the following limitations: (1) The settings of anchors depended on prior knowledge and the model performance was sensitive to it. (2) Plenty of anchors needed to be predefined to cover various texts, which made the model more complex and slowed down the detection speed largely. Thus, anchor-free text detection methods were proposed. Zhou e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al. [ref]10 predicted the offsets between the sample point and text border directly, which successfully avoided the influences that anchors brought to detectors. Liu e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al.  remodeled texts with unordered points. It reduced the complexity of the features that the model needed to learn. To detect arbitrary-shaped text instances, Tang e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al.  proposed a character-level text detection method. It detected multiple character boxes by SSD  at first. Then, it connected the characters belonging to the same text instances by attractive link and rejected the characters belonging to different text instances by repulsive link. Zhang e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al.  and Ma e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al.  also detected text instances in character-level. They predicted all potential character boxes at first. Then, the method generated linkage likelihoods of the boxes. In the end, they connected boxes by the corresponding linkages to obtain the text contours. Some other researchers    generated proposal boxes to roughly locate text instances at first, and then sampling contour key points from the boxes. In the end, they reconstructed the text contours by connecting the sampling points in sequence. Wang e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al.  obtained a contour points sequence by multiple rays directly and connected those points to get the final text contour, but it could not detect highly-curved texts effectively. Zhu e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al.  represented text contours by Fourier Contour Embedding (FCE) method, which reconstructed text contours by predicting two score maps and Fourier signature vectors. Although the above approaches could detect irregular-shaped texts by improving traditional detection frameworks, the complicated framework heavily influenced model efficiency. Segmentation-Based Text Detection Methods. Since segmentation methods could fit any geometries tightly, many segmentation-based text detectors were proposed to detect arbitrary-shaped text instances. Lyu e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al.  roughly located the text instances through quadrilateral boxes at first. Then, the authors segmented text instance regions accurately from the boxes. Long e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al.  sampled a number of points on text center lines and predicted offsets between points and text contours. The text contours were rebuilt by applying offsets to points one by one. Baek e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al.  extended character-level datasets through weakly supervised networks to improve the model performance. Moreover, they proposed a 2D Gaussian character label to weak the text edge, which could separate the close characters. Following the idea of R-FCN , Lyu e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al.  separated text instances into four different regions and combined them to get the final detection results. Zhang e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al.  used an effective pyramid lengthwise and sidewise residual sequence modeling method to detect arbitrary-shaped text instances. Wang e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al.  shrunk the text mask to generate a smaller mask, which could effectively separate adhesive texts and locate them roughly. In addition, the authors segmented the text mask and formed the final result by a pixel-level expansion process. Tian e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al.  proposed a shape-aware embedding map for detecting text instances that accommodate various aspect ratios and imprecise boundaries, which is especially useful to the detection of long sentences. Jiang e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al.  predicted text central region (TCR), expanding ratio, and text region (TR) at first. Then, the authors expanded TCR to TR by the expanding ratio and polygon expansion algorithm. Xu e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al.  proposed a text field to encode text instances. The magnitude and direction of the text field are used to locate text instances and separate adjacent text instances respectively. Although the aforementioned methods could detect arbitrary-shaped text instances effectively, they needed to predict plenty of text information by complicated network and handle them through many post-process steps, which heavily influenced text detection speed. Real-Time Arbitrary-Shaped Text Detection Methods. Different from previous methods, real-time text detection methods focused on both detection accuracy and speed. Wang e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al.  roughly located text instances by shrink masks at first. Then, to rebuild text contours, they needed to extra predict text masks and similar vectors by the network to expand shrink mask regions to text regions with pixel-level processing (see Fig. 2 (a)). Liao e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}al.  predicted shrink masks and the threshold maps simultaneously by the network (as shown in Fig. 2 (b)), the latter was used to refine the borders of shrink masks to improve the model detection accuracy. Compared with them, our method adopts a more efficient pipeline (as shown in Fig. 2 (c)). It only needs to predict one concentric mask by one prediction header, which makes our network more simple than PAN and DB. Moreover, CM-Net rebuilds text contours by object-level post-processing, which brings less computational cost than pixel-level post-processing of PAN.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: methods.
