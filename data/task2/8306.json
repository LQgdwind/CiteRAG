While various studies in digital pathology have explored the use of contrastive learning for acquiring robust representations for classification tasks [ref]17 [ref]18, recent studies suggest limitations to its efficiency for histopathology image analysis . The limitation arises from the inherent similarity in morphological features between adjacent patches within a WSI, rendering them less effective negative pairs for CL. This is one of the reasons why the DINO framework remains a popular choice for pathology representation learning (HIPT, Clam, Vim4Path   ). A recent benchmark study compared four SSL methods, among which MoCov2, Barlow Twins and DINO, on four pathology datasets [ref]2. This study highlighted the need for domain-aligned pretraining with different augmentation techniques such as random vertical flips, weak colour jittering, RandStainNA, and multiple Fields of View. The authors emphasize the potential of domain-specific SSL methods to improve the performance of models fine-tuned for downstream pathology tasks. A study investigating augmentation techniques within the MoCov2 framework for Chest X-rays highlights the need for future research on the impact of various data augmentations as well as their combination for SSL in pathology . A recent work proposes a rotation method on the patch level to apply random rotation to one patch or a crop of that patch and show great results . This emphasis underscores the critical role of SSL frameworks in digital pathology, particularly when complemented by domain-aligned fine-tuning. While prior works, such as , which introduces automatic adversarial style augmentation (AdvStyle) to simulate covariate shifts similar to staining variations in pathology data, and , which explores diverse augmentation techniques for pathology images within the DINO framework, have made significant contributions, have made significant contributions, no published research to date has investigated fine-tuning Barlow Twins framework for pathology downstream tasks. Barlow Twins has performed excellently on diverse pathology datasets [ref]2 and requires less computational resources than DINO : it does not require a large batch size and only pushes one encoder on GPUs. Therefore, in this work, we study the hyperparameters and augmentation techniques of this SSL method for colorectal polyps screening tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: pathology data has become increasingly crucial.
