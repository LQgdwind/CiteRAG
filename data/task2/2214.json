      "content": "Paper Title: On the Importance of Environments in Human-Robot Coordination\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOverview.\nOur proposed framework consists of three main components: 1) A GAN which generates environments and is trained with human-authored examples. 2) A MIP which edits the generated environments to apply domain-specific constraints that make the environment solvable for the desired task. 3) A quality diversity algorithm, CMA-ME, which searches the latent space of the GAN to generate environments that maximize or minimize team performance, but are also diverse with respect to specified measures. In Appendix E we discuss two alternatives: optimizing latent space with random search instead of CMA-ME, and directly searching over the tiles of the environment, instead of exploring the latent space of a GAN. Deep Convolutional GAN. Directly searching over the space of possible environments can lead to the discovery of unrealistic environments. To promote realism, we incorporate GANs into our environment generation pipeline. Prior work  [ref]16 in PCG demonstrates that in the Super Mario Bros. and Zelda domains, GANs generate video game levels which adhere to the design characteristics of their training dataset. We implemented a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) architecture identical to that in previous PCG work  [ref]16 [ref]44, and we trained it on human-authored Overcooked environments. Fig. 4 shows the architecture of the GAN and Fig. 3 shows example human-authored (top row) and GAN-generated (second row) environments. We provide implementation details in Appendix D-A. Mixed-Integer Program Formulation. While GAN-generated environments capture design similarities to their training dataset, most GAN-generated environments are unsolvable: GANs represent levels by assigning tile-types to locations, and this allows for walkable regions to become disconnected or item types to be missing or too frequent. In general, GANs struggle to constrain the generative environment space to satisfy logical properties . To compensate for the limitations of GANs, we build upon the generate-and-repair approach proposed in previous work , which repairs environments with mixed-integer linear programs (MIPs) that directly encode solvability constraints. To ensure that repairs do not deviate too far from the GAN-generated environment, the MIP minimizes the edit distance between the input and output environments. The result is an environment similar to the GAN-generated one that satisfies all solvability constraints. In Overcooked, we specify MIP constraints that (1) bound the number of each tile type (i.e. starting agent locations, counters, stoves, floor), (2) ensure that key objects are reachable by both players and (3) prevent the agents from stepping outside the environment. We formalize the MIP in Appendix A. The third row of Fig. 3 shows example environments generated by the GAN+MIP approach. We observe that the environments allow execution of the Overcooked game, while appearing similar to the GAN levels in the second row. In contrast, the fourth row (MIP-random) shows environments generated from random tile assignments passed as inputs to the MIP. While all environments are solvable, they are stylistically different than the human-authored examples: each environment appears cluttered and unorganized. Latent Space Illumination.\nWhile the GAN generator and MIP repair collectively form a generative space of solvable environments, simply sampling the generative space is not efficient at generating diverse environments (see Appendix E-A). We address this issue by formulating the problem as a Latent Space Illumination (LSI) problem [ref]16 defined below. Solving the LSI problem allow us to extract environments that are diverse with respect to fluency metrics while still maximizing or minimizing team performance.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: searching over the space of possible environments can lead to the discovery of unrealistic environments.
