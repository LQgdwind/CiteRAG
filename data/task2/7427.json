      "content": "Paper Title: Synthesizing Sentiment-Controlled Feedback For Multimodal Text and Image Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTHE process of multimodal feedback synthesis involves generating responses to multimodal inputs in a way that mirrors human feedback [ref]1. Controlling sentiments in feedback, a capability inherent to humans, remains a challenge for machines . The ability to control sentiments in feedback synthesis has wide-ranging applications. For instance, it can lead to more empathetic patient care in healthcare, more accurate consumer insights in marketing, and more engaging educational material development. Such systems can predict the mental states of patients, assess user responses to products, analyze social behaviors, evaluate multimodal educational content, and predict user engagement in advertisements   [ref]5. Crucially, the controllability aspect of these systems enables them to adopt different roles in human-computer interaction (HCI), such as responding in varied styles to suit the audience’s needs – from encouraging the stressed or depressed, acting as a strict coach, to being delightful or bubbly in lighter contexts. The ability to control sentiments in feedback enriches HCI, making it more personalized. This paper introduces the task of controllable feedback synthesis for input images and text. It proposes a large-scale Controllable Multimodal Feedback Synthesis (CMFeed) dataset for this purpose, created by crawling Facebook news articles. A feedback synthesis system has been developed that generates sentiment-controlled feedback with positive or negative sentiments. It employs two networks for textual and visual modalities, each comprising an encoder, a decoder, and a control layer. The encoders use a text transformer [ref]6 and a Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) model  to extract features, which the decoder combines for feedback generation. The control layer, placed after the decoder, selectively activates or deactivates neurons corresponding to the positive and negative sentiments. The system also includes a similarity module, which ensures that generated feedback closely aligns with the input’s context, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of the response. Furthermore, the contribution of various textual and visual features toward generating uncontrolled and controlled feedback has been analyzed using the K-Average Additive exPlanation (KAAP) interpretability technique. The proposed task of controllable feedback synthesis differs from existing related tasks. Unlike multimodal summarization , which condenses information, or dialog generation , which focuses on conversation flow, it requires creating contextually apt and sentiment-aligned feedback. Importantly, our work focuses on generating ‘opinions’, rather than reusing ‘knowledge’ or ‘facts’. Our approach uniquely allows for the generation of controlled opinions, which can vary just as human opinions do. Visual question answering  and sentiment-aware conversation  involve extracting or inferring sentiments but do not generate sentiment-influenced feedback. Similarly, sentiment-controlled text generation , though sentiment-centric, needs the multimodal dimension of our approach. These tasks are empirically found incapable of synthesizing meaningful sentiment-controlled feedback [ref]1 . Furthermore, although Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) and Large Language Models (LLMs)  excel in summarization and question answering through knowledge retrieval, our approach fundamentally differs. Instead of relying on pre-existing data, our system interprets multimodal inputs to generate novel, sentiment-controlled feedback that mirrors human interaction. This highlights the distinctive contribution of our approach compared to GPT and other LLMs, which primarily leverage existing knowledge. The proposed system achieved sentiment classification accuracy of 77.23%, which is 18.82% higher than not using the controllability module. We analyzed the generated feedback’s relevance and ranks against the human generated comments and also carried out human evaluations to assess the sentiment alignment. The major contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: The new task has been defined to generate sentiment-controlled feedback towards multimodal input containing images and text similar to how humans do. The CMFeed dataset has been constructed for multimodal feedback synthesis, encompassing text, images, corresponding comments, number of likes, shares, and sentiment class. A feedback synthesis system capable of generating sentiment-controlled feedback has been developed in which textual and visual features are extracted using a text transformer and a Faster R-CNN model and combined by the decoder for feedback generation. A novel controllability module has been introduced, enabling sentiment regulation in the generated feedback. It selectively activates or deactivates neurons to ensure alignment of the feedback with the desired sentiment. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: the existing related works are surveyed in Section 2. Section 3 describes the dataset construction process and the proposed system. The experiments and results have been discussed in Section 5 and Section 5.4 respectively, and the conclusions are drawn in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: THE process of multimodal feedback synthesis involves generating responses to multimodal inputs in a way that mirrors human feedback [ref]1.
