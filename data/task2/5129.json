      "content": "Paper Title: A Novel Center-based Deep Contrastive Metric Learning Method for the Detection of Polymicrogyria in Pediatric Brain MRI\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPathologies in medical images are often regarded as rare deviance (anomalies) because the majority of medical images are healthy (or normal) samples [ref]16 .\nUnlike binary classification, anomaly detection can deal with a relatively imbalanced dataset where normal samples are the majority and the diversity of anomaly samples is limited. While semi-supervised and unsupervised deep learning methods are commonly used in anomaly\ndetection \nbut may be limited for medical images which have complex or even indistinguishable features [ref]18, such as PMG images.\nTherefore, exploring anomaly-supervisory signals may help anomaly detection . Ruff et al. introduced a deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Deep SAD) [ref]5 which showed that adding a few labeled anomaly samples during training can achieve better results than the deep support vector data description (Deep SVDD) , which is trained only on normal samples. Ding et al.  proposed a novel open-set supervised anomaly detection method to detect seen anomalies and unseen anomalies. They created some pseudo anomaly samples which\nhave similar features as real anomaly samples\nbut are dissimilar to normal samples. However, in our PMG detection,\nreal anomaly samples are close to normal samples because the differences between PMG MRI and normal MRI are subtle. Hence, generating pseudo anomaly samples for our PMG detection may not be appropriate.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: Pathologies in medical images are often regarded as rare deviance (anomalies) because the majority of medical images are healthy (or normal) samples [ref]16 .\nUnlike binary classification, anomaly detection can deal with a relatively imbalanced dataset where normal samples are the majority and the diversity of anomaly samples is limited.
