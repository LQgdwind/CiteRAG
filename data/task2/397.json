      "content": "Paper Title: Manthan: A Data Driven Approach for Boolean Function SynthesisThe open source tool is available at https://github.com/meelgroup/manthan\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate the performance of 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan} on the union of all the benchmarks employed in the most recent works [ref]4 ,which includes 609609609 benchmarks from different sources: Prenex-2QBF track of QBFEval-17, QBFEval-18[ref]3, disjunctive, arithmetic and factorization. We ran all the tools as per the specification laid out by their authors. We used Open-WBO  for our MaxSAT queries and PicoSAT  to compute UnsatCore. We used PicoSAT for its ease of usage and we expect further performance improvements by upgrading to one of the state of the art SAT solvers. We have used the Scikit-Learn to create decision trees in 𝖫𝖾𝖺𝗋𝗇𝖲𝗄𝖥𝖫𝖾𝖺𝗋𝗇𝖲𝗄𝖥\\mathsf{LearnSkF} phase of 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan}. We have also used ABC  to represent and manipulate Boolean functions. To allow for the input formats supported by the different tools, we use the utility scripts available with the BFSS distribution  to convert each of the instances to both QDIMACS and Verilog formats. For 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan}, unless otherwise specified, we set the number of samples according to heuristic based on |Y|𝑌|Y| as described in Section 6.3 and minimum impurity decrease to 0.0050.0050.005. All our experiments were conducted on a high-performance computer cluster with each node consisting of a E5-2690 v3 CPU with 242424 cores and 969696GB of RAM, with a memory limit set to 444GB per core. All tools were run in a single-threaded mode on a single core with a timeout of 720072007200 seconds. The objective of our experimental evaluation was two-fold: to understand the impact of various design choices on the runtime performance of 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan} and to perform an extensive comparison of runtime performance vis-a-vis state of the art synthesis tools. In particular, we sought to answer the following questions: How does the performance of 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan} compare with state of the functional synthesis engines? How do the usage of different sampling schemes and the quality of samplers impact the performance of 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan}?\n What is the impact of 𝖫𝖾𝖺𝗋𝗇𝖲𝗄𝖥𝖫𝖾𝖺𝗋𝗇𝖲𝗄𝖥\\mathsf{LearnSkF} on the performance of 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan}? What is the distribution of the time spent in each phase of 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan}? How does using MaxSAT solver to identify the potential erring Skolem functions impacts on the performance of 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan}? How does employing self-substitution for some Skolem functions impact 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan}? We observe that 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan} significantly improves upon state of the art, and solves 356 benchmarks while the state of the art tool can only solve 280; in particular, 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan} solves 606060 more benchmarks that could not be solved by any of the state of the art tools. To put the runtime performance statistics in a broader context, the number of benchmarks solved by techniques developed over the past five years range from 206 to 280, i.e., a difference of 74, which is same as an increase of 76 (i.e., from 280 to 356) due to 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan}. Our experimental evaluation leads to interesting conclusions and several directions for future work. We observe that the performance of 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan} is sensitive to different sampling schemes and the underlying samplers; in fact, we found that biased sampling yields better results than uniform sampling. This raises interesting questions on the possibility of designing specialized samplers for this task. Similarly, we observe interesting trade offs between the number of samples and the minimum impurity decrease in 𝖫𝖾𝖺𝗋𝗇𝖲𝗄𝖥𝖫𝖾𝖺𝗋𝗇𝖲𝗄𝖥\\mathsf{LearnSkF}. The diversity of our extensive benchmark suite produces a nuanced picture with respect to time distribution across different phases, highlighting the critical nature of each of the phases to the performance of 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan}. 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan} shows significant performance improvement by using MaxSAT solver to identify candidates to refine. 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan} also has significant performance improvement with self substitution in terms of the required number of refinements.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: We evaluate the performance of 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan} on the union of all the benchmarks employed in the most recent works [ref]4 ,which includes 609609609 benchmarks from different sources: Prenex-2QBF track of QBFEval-17, QBFEval-18[ref]3, disjunctive, arithmetic and factorization.
