If none, delete this.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe task of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has been widely explored within the field of computer vision. Every character recognition task can be classified into two subtasks: character localization and character classification. With the introduction of the Region Proposal Network (RPN) [ref]1 and other advancements in object detection, the performance of the character spotting task has been steadily increasing. Also, with the attention mechanism  and autoencoder-based segmentation mechanisms ,the performance of the character recognition task improved. However, this performance improvement was often accompanied by a significant increase in model size and computational complexity, despite the underlying task remaining the same. Specifically, State Of The Art (SOTA) models such as RF-Learner [ref]4 and SPIN  have the parameter space on the scale of 106superscript10610^{6}. The usage of sizable models can be problematic in situations where real-time or near real-time operation is required. For example, deploying models on edge devices or training models in a federated learning fashion can benefit greatly from having a lightweight model architecture. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and high-performance Deep Learning (DL) model architecture that is specifically designed to minimize the model parameter space. In addition to the very high inference speed, due to the significantly small model size, the model could be deployed on edge devices and even be trained on edge devices in a federated learning fashion. Since data privacy is a high priority and data drift is an unavoidable hazard in Machine Learning (ML), training an OCR model in a federated learning schema is profitable in both research and industry contexts. With the introduction of our architecture, the OCR model could achieve SOTA performance via federated training, as well. Unlike other image recognition tasks, the only significant factor in the text/character recognition task is the geometry of the character. Factors such as color, depth, or hierarchical features have minimal influence on the output of the task. However, most models extract localized features from the RGB pixel space without explicitly designing for an efficient feature-extracting process. As a result, to achieve higher accuracy, the model size has to be increased. Consequently, the model training sample space has to be expanded to minimize the estimation error in empirical risk minimization. As a solution, the proposed model extracts geometric features from the grayscale image to identify the sequence of characters, without explicitly processing character locations. This paper introduces a novel model architecture composed of a novel image feature encoding strategy and feature projection methods. Furthermore, the model is trained on images with a fixed number of characters, and thus outputs a fixed number of object labels, without specific training or predicting the object locations/ bounding boxes. Ultimately, this is targeting significantly smaller parameter spaces, and less computationally complex operations to tackle the real-time inference scenarios and optimal training in a federated learning setup. The model consists of two novel implementations: (1) a geometrical shape-based encoder, and (2) a feature localization unit for ground-truth label sequence prediction. The model assumes the input image only contains a row of characters in the horizontally aligned format. The proposed model’s input format is a standard image format in the Scene Text Recognition (STR) field. However, any other text alignment such as curved or tilted can be used for model training with a preprocessing mechanism such as Thin Plate Spline transformation (TPS) . Furthermore, the proposed model can be used in an end-to-end text recognition task, simply by adding a bounding box detection model such as SegLink [ref]7 or BoundaryE2E  before the recognition model. For the first novel feature, the paper introduces a very lightweight encoder unit that encodes the shape of each character found in the image. In the real world, we could safely say that someone learned a shape, by examining how someone can reorganize a striped image of a shape, back together [1(b)]. As a deep learning counterpart, we propose LSTM-based encoders trained to learn the aforementioned principal idea. Furthermore, the following layer configurations and the objective function are defined to ensure the encoder learns as expected. The second novelty is that the encoded feature space is mapped into a logit layer by a unique spatial attention mechanism. This submodel consists of several unique innovations to achieve SOTA performance. As unveiling those new implementations from input to end, the model is composed of an interpretable feature region to target the label mapping block. Not only is this block mathematically stable to prevent the model from collapsing but it’s also very lightweight compared to the general attention  mechanism. On the other hand, the paper introduces a fully-convolutional label prediction mechanism, loosely resembling the auto-encoder architecture . Furthermore, the proposed architecture reveals a superior logit layer format to traditional multi-class multi-label classification  logit format in several aspects. In addition to the novel model architecture, the paper also introduces a sophisticated synthetic text sample generation python library called digitgen. digitgen library builds as a solution to several drawbacks found in well-known datasets like SynthText  and MJSynth . The implemented image synthesizing algorithm enables the generation of a dataset of any size, irrespective of the memory size of the system. Furthermore, it is able to generate a COCO-structured annotation file  to rebuild the data loaders under any deep learning framework. Additionally, the characters in the images are generated completely pseudo-randomly, unlike in MJSynth or SynthText. This random character definition is proposed to mitigate the propensity added by the lexicon-based scene text generation. Despite synthetic generation, the proposed library provides a variety of augmentations such as adding random noise, adding shadow patches, adding light bursts, changing font family, font size, etc. To summarize, the paper introduces a novel model architecture to address the task of regular scene text recognition (GeoTRNet), and a new synthetic regular scene text image generating python library (digitgen). With the aforementioned introduction, the paper empirically proves the model’s SOTA performance under near real-world image datasets. Additionally, the experimental results under federated learning with low client sample sizes, serve as evidence for the model’s capability in estimation error minimization. Furthermore, the conducted experiments on metric learning for the signature verification task show the wide usability of the proposed architecture.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: computer vision.
