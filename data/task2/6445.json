      "content": "Paper Title: Comparing Causal Frameworks: Potential Outcomes, Structural Models, Graphs, and Abstractions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe aim of this paper is to make clear and precise the relationship between the Rubin causal model (RCM) and structural causal model (SCM) frameworks for causal inference. Adopting a neutral logical perspective, and drawing on previous work, we show what is required for an RCM to be representable by an SCM. A key result then shows that every RCM—including those that violate algebraic principles implied by the SCM framework—emerges as an abstraction of some representable RCM. Finally, we illustrate the power of this conciliatory perspective by pinpointing an important role for SCM principles in classic applications of RCMs; conversely, we offer a characterization of the algebraic constraints implied by a graph, helping to substantiate further comparisons between the two frameworks. Toward the end of the twentieth century several frameworks arose for formalizing and analyzing problems of causal inference. One of these, associated with Rubin  and others (see ), takes the potential outcome—formalizing the effect of one variable on another—as a fundamental target of analysis. Causal assumptions in the Rubin causal model (RCM) are naturally encoded as algebraic constraints on potential outcomes, and research in this area has spawned a remarkable body of theoretical and applied work especially in social and biomedical sciences (see  for a review). A second approach, associated with Pearl  and collaborators (see  for a textbook treatment; see also [ref]40), focuses instead on assumptions that can be encoded qualitatively, or more specifically, graphically, arising from a fundamental object known as a structural causal model (SCM). The do-calculus is one of the crowning achievements of this approach, and it has been shown derivationally complete with respect to a wide range of canonical estimation and inference problems   1. Both frameworks have enjoyed considerable influence within recent causal machine learning in particular. As just one example, concern in reinforcement learning about the possibility of unobserved confounders—variables impacting both decisions and their outcomes—has generated a number of important advances, some employing tools and concepts from the RCM approach (e.g., 0 7 9), others grounded in the SCM approach and typically involving graphs (e.g.,   ). Despite the remarkable successes that both of these frameworks have engendered in machine learning and beyond, there remains substantial controversy over how to understand their relationship. In the literature it has been claimed, on the one hand, that the two are equivalent, that “a theorem in one is a theorem in the other” [30, p. 98].\nOn the other hand, some authors suggest that the two are only equivalent in a weak sense, one that “builds the limitations of SCM into the\nresulting comparison and likewise filters out aspects of the rival theory that do not\nreadily translate to SCM” [23, p. 443]. At issue are two separable questions. The first is one of practical significance. Some argue that graphs give greater “conceptual clarity” [30, p. 103] and that SCMs more generally offer a “a flexible formalism for data-generating models” that helps ground causal inquiry [4, p. 514]; others argue that work in the RCM framework provides “transparent definitions of causal effects and encourages the analyst to consider individual-level heterogeneity as a first principle” [25, p. 91] as well as “guidance to researchers and policy makers\nfor practical implementation” [16, p. 1131]. While obviously very important, our goal is not to address these disputes about what theoretical primitives are most “natural” or “useful” for practitioners or applied researchers. Rather, the aim of the present contribution is to offer a number of new technical results that together shed light on a more basic question, namely, how precisely the RCM and SCM frameworks relate at a theoretical level. For example, are the two merely notational variants, or does one tactictly enforce assumptions that the other does not? In this paper we first endeavor, building on previous work, to elucidate the precise sense in which SCMs can be construed as representations of RCMs, provided the latter satisfy two key principles known as composition and reversibility  . Interestingly, such principles (or their logical consequences) have been questioned in the literature (e.g., ). Our second goal is to help clarify the sense in which they may fail. Drawing from recent literature on causal abstraction (e.g., 6 )—broadened to cover both SCMs and RCMs—we suggest that failure of these principles plausibly results when causally relevant low-level details are elided in favor of more abstract variables. Our Thm. 1 buttresses this intuition, showing that every RCM is a constructive abstraction of a representable RCM (hence satisfying composition and reversibility). We furthermore remark on how the well known SUTVA assumptions  can be understood as conditions on good variable abstractions. Our starting point in this work is theoretically neutral, taking for granted only the primitive, “probability of a counterfactual.” In the second half of the paper we introduce a framework-neutral formal language for reasoning about such probabilities, which in turn facilities further comparison.\nWith respect to this common language, we offer a completeness result for the class of all RCMs (Thm. 2) and, drawing on , the class of representable RCMs (Cor. 2). These results are illustrated with an example derivation of LATE (see  ), which also helps illuminate which assumptions are logically required in the derivation. Meanwhile, we offer a partial answer to the well-known open question  4 of how to characterize the algebraic constraints implied by a particular graph (Thm. 3), a result that helps bring graphical assumptions into this neutral common language. Finally, we show how an existing result on single-world intervention graphs (SWIGs), a framework drawing from both perspectives, can be construed as a completeness result for the same language (Thm. 4). Taken together, our results are largely conciliatory—in the same spirit as other important conciliatory work in this context; see, e.g., 3 9 2—showing how the two frameworks are productively compatible, while also suggesting distinctive perspectives on problems of causal inference. Proofs are deferred to supplementary appendices A, B, which contain additional technical material.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: of theoretical and applied work especially in social and biomedical sciences (see  for a review).
