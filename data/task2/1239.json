      "content": "Paper Title: Doubly Stochastic Subspace Clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSubspace clustering seeks to cluster a set of data points that are approximately drawn\nfrom a union of low dimensional linear (or affine) subspaces into clusters,\nwhere each linear (or affine) subspace defines a cluster\n(i.e., every point in a given cluster lies in the same subspace) .\nThe most common class of subspace clustering algorithms\nfor clustering a set of n𝑛n data points proceed\nin two stages: 1) Learning an affinity matrix 𝐀∈ℝn×n𝐀superscriptℝ𝑛𝑛\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}\nthat defines the similarity between pairs of datapoints;\n2) Applying a graph clustering technique, such as\nspectral clustering  ,\nto produce the final clustering.\nIn particular, arguably the most\npopular model for subspace clustering is to construct the affinity matrix\nby exploiting the ‘self-expressive’ property of linear (or affine)\nsubspaces, where a point within a given subspace can be represented\nas a linear combination of other points within the subspace\n     .\nFor a dataset 𝐗∈ℝd×n𝐗superscriptℝ𝑑𝑛\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times n} of n𝑛n, d𝑑d-dimensional data points,\nthis is typically captured by an optimization problem of the form: where the first term captures the self-expressive property, 𝐗≈𝐗𝐂𝐗𝐗𝐂\\mathbf{X}\\approx\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{C},\nand the second term, θ𝜃\\theta, is some regularization term on 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C} to\nencourage that a given point is primarily represented by other points from\nits own subspace and to avoid trivial solutions\nsuch as 𝐂=𝐈𝐂𝐈\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{I}. Once the self-expressive representation\n𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C} has been learned from (1),\nthe final affinity 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is then typically constructed\nby rectifying and symmetrizing 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C}, e.g., 𝐀=(|𝐂|+|𝐂⊤|)/2𝐀𝐂superscript𝐂top2\\mathbf{A}=(|\\mathbf{C}|+|\\mathbf{C}^{\\top}|)/2. However, as we detail in Section 2.1 and illustrate in Figure 1, many subspace clustering methods require ad-hoc or unjustified postprocessing procedures on 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C} to work in practice.\nThese postprocessing steps serve to normalize 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C} to produce an affinity 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} with better spectral clustering performance, but they add numerous arbitrary\nhyperparameters to the models and receive little mention in the associated papers. Likewise, it is well-established that some form of Laplacian normalization is needed for spectral clustering to be successful , for which the practitioner again has multiple choices of normalization strategy. In this paper, we propose a new subspace clustering framework which explicitly connects the self-expressive step, the affinity normalization, and the spectral clustering step. We develop novel scalable methods for this framework that address issues with and empirically outperform other subspace clustering models. To motivate our proposed models, we first discuss the desired properties of subspace clustering affinities that one would like for successful spectral clustering.\nSpecifically, we desire affinities 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} that have the following properties: Well-normalized for spectral clustering. We should better leverage\nknowledge that 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} will be input to spectral clustering.\nMany forms of ad-hoc postprocessing in subspace clustering\nperform poorly-justified normalization, and there is also\na choice of normalization to be made in forming the graph Laplacian . Sparsity. Much success in subspace clustering\nhas been found with enforcing sparsity on 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C}\n  .\nIn particular, many sparsity-enforcing methods are designed to ensure that the nonzero entries of the affinity matrix correspond to pairs of points which belong to the same subspace. This leads to high clustering accuracy,\ndesirable computational properties, and provable theoretical guarantees. Connectivity. There should be sufficiently many edges\nin the underlying graph of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} so that all points within the\nsame subspace are connected\n  .\nThus, there is a trade-off between sparsity and connectivity that subspace clustering methods\nmust account for. Properties (C1) and (C2) are well studied in the subspace clustering literature, and can be enforced on the self-expressive 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C}, since rectifying and symmetrizing a 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C} with these properties, for example, maintains the properties. However, property (A1) must be enforced on 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}; thus, (A1) is often neglected in several aspects (see Section 2.1),\nand is mostly handled by ad-hoc postprocessing methods, if handled at all.\nIn working towards (A1), we first constrain 𝐀≥𝟎𝐀0\\mathbf{A}\\geq\\mathbf{0}, since nonnegativity of the affinity is necessary for interpretability and alignment with spectral clustering theory. Beyond this, spectral clustering also benefits from having rows and columns in the affinity matrix of the same scale, and many forms of Laplacian normalization for spectral clustering normalize rows and/or columns to have similar scale .\nIn particular, one form of normalization that is well established in the spectral clustering literature is to constrain the rows and columns to have unit l1subscript𝑙1l_{1} norm. Because 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is additionally constrained to be nonnegative, this is equivalent to requiring each row sum and column sum of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} to be 1, resulting in constraints that restrict the affinities 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} to be in the convex set of doubly stochastic matrices : Doubly stochastic matrices have been thoroughly studied for spectral clustering, and doubly stochastic normalization has been shown to significantly improve the performance of spectral clustering\n [ref]55       .\nMoreover, doubly stochastic matrices are invariant to the most widely-used types of Laplacian normalization , which removes the need to choose a Laplacian normalization scheme. Further, the authors of [ref]55 show that various Laplacian normalization schemes can be viewed as attempting to approximate a given affinity matrix with a doubly stochastic matrix under certain distance metrics. Beyond being well-normalized for spectral clustering (A1), the family of doubly stochastic matrices can also satisfy properties (C1) and (C2).\nOur proposed methods will give control over the sparsity-connectivity trade-off through interpretable parameters, and we in practice learn 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} that are quite sparse.\nAdditionally, doubly stochastic matrices have a guarantee of a certain level of connectivity due to the row sum constraint, which prohibits solutions with all-zero rows (that can occur in other subspace clustering methods). The convexity of 𝛀nsubscript𝛀𝑛\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}_{n} along with the sparsity of our learned 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} allow us to develop novel scalable algorithms for doubly stochastic projection and hence scalable methods for subspace clustering with doubly stochastic affinities. Contributions.\nIn this work, we develop a framework that unifies the self-expressive representation step of subspace clustering with the spectral clustering step by formulating a model that jointly solves for a self-expressive representation 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C} and a doubly stochastic affinity matrix 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}.\nWhile our general model is non-convex, we provide a convex relaxation that is provably close to the non-convex model and that can be solved by a type of linearized ADMM . A closer analysis also allows us to formulate a sequential algorithm to quickly compute an approximate solution, in which we first efficiently learn a self-expressive matrix and then subsequently fit a doubly stochastic matrix by a regularized optimal transport problem  . We leverage inherent sparsity in the problem to develop a scalable active-set method for computing in this sequential model.\nFinally, we validate our approach with experiments on various standard subspace clustering datasets, where we demonstrate that our models significantly improve on the current state-of-the-art in a variety of performance metrics.\n\nReference markers found: [55]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]55: : Doubly stochastic matrices have been thoroughly studied for spectral clustering, and doubly stochastic normalization has been shown to significantly improve the performance of spectral clustering\n [ref]55       .\nMoreover, doubly stochastic matrices are invariant to the most widely-used types of Laplacian normalization , which removes the need to choose a Laplacian normalization scheme.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
