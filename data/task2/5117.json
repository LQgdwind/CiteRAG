      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Conditional Imitation Learning for Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDespite the recent advances to achieve the promising vision of autonomous driving in terms of significantly reducing accidents  and congestion , while being environmentally and economically beneficial , it is safe to believe that fully autonomous navigation in complex environments is still decades away   . Autonomous vehicles employ a “sense-plan-act” design which is the basis of many robotic systems. Advanced forms of LiDAR (laser scanner, an acronym of Light Detection And Ranging), radar, and inertial measurement allowed for a more accurate and quicker sensing of the environment and surrounding objects. Nevertheless, many open challenges remain yet to be fully solved in: 1) planning the vehicle’s actions based on understating the driving scene and the interaction between its elements given the sensed data and 2) eventually commanding the vehicle’s control system steering, throttle, and brakes. The algorithmic pipeline includes tasks such as mapping, localization, driving scene perception, motion planning, and trajectory optimization which are full of open challenges  including requiring expensive data annotation, relying on heuristics and handcrafted rule-based modules, and the potential of adding unnecessary complexity to the problem. Therefore, researchers turned to train end-to-end deep neural networks to directly learn the mapping from front-facing camera data stream to driving commands. Recently, there has been an increasing amount of literature adopting the end-to-end approach [ref]4 . Such systems are demonstrated suitable when following roads and avoiding obstacles. The conditional imitation learning (CIL) method  upgraded the end-to-end approach by allowing the vehicle to be automatically guided at test time to take a specific turn at an upcoming intersection to reach the destination. The model conditions imitation learning on a high-level navigational command input received from a global route planner, just as mapping applications, that instructs the model to control the vehicle to take a specific turn, go straight through an intersection, or follow lane. In , CARLA urban driving benchmark is adopted to benchmark the CIL model  against other approaches to autonomous driving. CARLA  is a widely used open-source simulator for autonomous car development focused on creating realistic virtual environments for the automotive industry. Many contributors constantly improve it, which makes it a comprehensive tool for simulating real-world scenarios. The benchmark results demonstrated that the CIL model is responsive to the high-level navigational commands and drives efficiently when tested in the same training environments. However, performance is found inconsistent against varying weather conditions and significantly decreases when tested in environments that are unseen during the model training. Generalization from one town’s road layout and environment domains (represented by e.g. different texture sets) to other towns is a concern. Most importantly, the CIL method cannot avoid road unexpected temporary stationary blockages, as work zones in figure 1, which are ever-increasing in number on world roads . Such road blockages should be detected and the global route planner should dynamically estimate and guide the vehicle to a new route towards the destination accordingly. The aim of this work is to address two main issues of the CIL method: 1) lack of generalization to new environments and inconsistency against varying weather conditions and 2) failure to avoid static road blockages. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we provide a novel architecture that aims to tackle the CIL model  challenges of lack of generalization and inconsistency against varying weathers, by extending it via fusing a LiDAR sensor input with the camera. Camera and LiDAR are primary sensor modalities for autonomous driving to capture environment semantic and geometric information respectively. The strengths of each sensor can compensate for the weaknesses of the other. The accurate LiDAR range information resolves the camera depth perception ambiguity, while the camera’s dense angular resolution compensates for LiDAR sparsity. LiDAR also is less sensitive to ambient lighting . The proposed model in this work aims to tackle the CIL model  challenges of lack of generalization and inconsistency against varying weathers, by extending it via fusing a LiDAR sensor input with the camera. On CARLA simulator urban driving benchmark , the proposed model improved the autonomous driving success rate in towns unseen during the training by 52% and improved weather consistency by 3.9 times. It outperforms the CIL model in all the different combinations of tasks and environmental setups while being trained on driving traces recorded automatically. Our second contribution is a new efficient Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) method that is inspired by a part of our patent in [ref]23 and used in new road blockages avoidance and topological global route planning algorithms. Detailed knowledge about the environment is useful for autonomous driving. A versatile approach to this task is to use OGM  to generate a map from noisy and uncertain sensor measurements. The road blockages avoidance and route planning algorithms allow the vehicle to detect unexpected road closures and to dynamically estimate a new shortest route accordingly in order to reach the destination while avoiding closed lanes or roads. Additionally, the OGM is used to rectify the proposed model output to reduce the chances of driving on the sidewalk. On CARLA benchmark , the proposed global route planner method improved the driving success rate by 37% by providing more accurate navigational commands. The CARLA simulator and benchmark are upgraded to support testing navigation while having unexpected temporary stationary road blockages, and our road blockages avoidance algorithm improved the driving success rate by 27% and reduced infractions with static objects by 1.5 times.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: neural networks to directly learn the mapping from front-facing camera data stream to driving commands.
