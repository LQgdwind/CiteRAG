      "content": "Paper Title: LFOC+: A Fair OS-level Cache-Clustering Policy for Commodity Multicore Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA plethora of software and hardware techniques have been proposed to mitigate the effects of contention in the LLC        . Many researchers attempted to address this problem via cache-partitioning      . A recent survey  discusses a wide range of cache-partitioning approaches for different optimization objectives, such as improving system throughput   or fairness  . Notably, some recent proposals attempt to enforce QoS constraints for latency critical workloads  [ref]14 . Cache partitions can be created via specific hardware support (such as Intel CAT) or by means of software solutions, most of which rely on page-coloring     . The various hardware strategies employ different techniques to assign cache ways to different applications; while some of them rely on the cache replacement policy 0 1 2, others use set sampling and replicated cache tags  3. Our proposed OS-level (also extensible to the VMM) strategy leverages hardware-aided way-partitioning. Recent studies    have highlighted that on current CMPs with way-partitioning support, cache-clustering algorithms can be very superior in terms of fairness and throughput than approaches that assign separate partitions to the various applications (aka. strict cache-partitioning). Specifically, the fine-grained distribution of the LLC space that results from sharing a partition among applications, where the space distribution may not be a multiple of the way/set size, could lead to better performance and fairness than what optimal strict cache-partitioning can offer. UCP  is probably the strict cache-partitioning strategy that had a deeper impact on later proposals. UCP relies on lookahead, an iterative algorithm that distributes the LLC ways among applications so as to reduce the aggregate number of LLC misses. As indicated in its detailed pseudocode , in each iteration lookahead grants a way to the application that experiences the highest reduction in misses when receiving that extra way. While the original UCP policy used applications’ MPKI tables (i.e., Misses per Kilo Instructions for different cache sizes) as input to lookahead, recent cache-clustering strategies   employ variants of the algorithm that are fed with other input metrics, such as the speedup or the slowdown, so as to maximize or minimize the aggregate value of the metric observed across applications. LFOC and LFOC+ use applications’ slowdown tables as input to lookahead, used just in part of its clustering-related processing. LFOC is known to deliver better fairness and throughput  than UCP, and, unlike UCP, it can still be applied when the number of co-running applications exceeds the maximum number of partitions supported by the hardware (this is the case on our experimental setting). In this work we compared the effectiveness of LFOC+ to that of LFOC  and Dunn , which also attempt to improve fairness. The differences between LFOC and LFOC+ are explained in detail in Sec. 4. Dunn  relies on grouping applications into clusters, which may overlap, by applying the k-means clustering method. In creating clusters, and in determining cluster sizes, Dunn factors in the fraction of stall cycles due to L2 misses for the various applications. As we demonstrate in Sec. 5.1 this metric can be very misleading to approximate an application’s degree of cache sensitivity, and it sometimes leads Dunn to degrade fairness. We also provide an experimental comparison of LFOC+ against two throughput-optimized cache-clustering policies: KPart and CPA. KPart employs an iterative algorithm that creates and merges application clusters via hierarchical clustering. We observed that the distance function used by KPart to decide which clusters to merge, may lead to mapping aggressor and cache-sensitive applications onto the same partition, thus causing substantial fairness degradation in many cases. CPA was proposed later than LFOC , but has a few aspects in common with it. Specifically, both LFOC and CPA classify applications into different categories based on their degree of cache-sensitivity and contentiousness, and assign aggressor programs to small partitions. A distinctive feature of LFOC relative to CPA is the fact that the former effectively confines all aggressor (streaming) programs in up to 2 LLC partitions that never overlap with those used for cache-sensitive programs. In addition, LFOC and LFOC+ distribute LLC space between cache-sensitive programs based on their slowdown rather than by considering the number of applications in each class. CPA was originally evaluated using a CMP platform with very different features to those of the one used in our experiments; ours has a different microarchitecture, more cores, bigger L2 caches, coarser-grained LLC partitions, etc. Thanks to the detailed instructions provided by the authors  to utilize CPA on other LLC configurations, we could evaluate it on our platform. Our evaluation in Sec. 5.1 reveals that LFOC and LFOC+ provide a higher unfairness reduction than CPA across the board. Notably, Dunn, KPart and CPA are user-level clustering approaches, as opposed to LFOC and LFOC+, which were implemented in the OS kernel. User-level solutions require at least an extra user process, and may incur higher overheads due to the use of system calls to access performance monitoring counters (PMCs) and cache partitioning facilities, which are managed by the OS. LFOC and LFOC+ access these facilities directly via a lightweight kernel-level API, and perform PMC-related processing in a distributed fashion (on the CPUs where each thread runs). Another advantage of kernel-level implementations is the fact that they are aware of high-frequency scheduling-related events –like context switches– and can react to them immediately. This allowed us to efficiently implement LFOC+’s specific support for data-parallel multithreaded applications.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: for different optimization objectives, such as improving system throughput   or fairness  .
