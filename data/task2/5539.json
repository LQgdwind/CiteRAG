      "content": "Paper Title: Generative AI-empowered Simulation for Autonomous Driving in Vehicular Mixed Reality Metaverses\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThrough autonomous driving simulations, AVs can synthesize additional virtual driving experience for enhancing the inference and generalization capabilities of AI algorithms [ref]28. The synthesized driving experiences and sensor data need to include not only rare conditions but also realistic observations that are similar to the scenes in the real world. Therefore, generative AI, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models, is the promising solution to synthesizing new virtual driving data based on the existing realistic driving experience in the AVs’ DTs. For instance, Kim et al. propose the controllable simulation platform, named DriveGAN [ref]16. Trained on 160 hours of real-world driving datasets, the DriveGAN can generate high-resolution and diverse simulations based on user-defined conditions, e.g., weather conditions and locations of simulation objects. Nevertheless, there is a gap between virtual and physical driving experiences and sensor data for AVs that are trained in simulation platforms [ref]29.\nTherefore, Yang et al. in  propose a realistic sensor data synthesizing framework, named Surfelgan, for autonomous driving. The proposed data-driven data camera generation scheme demonstrates that the generated data can not only be visualized as high-quality data but also can be utilized as training datasets to improve the performance of AI algorithms in AVs. Furthermore, Zhong et al.  propose a generative diffusion model to synthesize controllable and realistic traffic simulations in autonomous driving systems. However, these simulation platforms cannot synthesize controllable and realistic driving experiences and sensor data. Therefore, they can merely synthesize and then label traffic and driving simulations for utilization in autonomous driving, rather than directly synthesizing labeled datasets based on specific requirements and conditions.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: Through autonomous driving simulations, AVs can synthesize additional virtual driving experience for enhancing the inference and generalization capabilities of AI algorithms [ref]28.

Therefore,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
