      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Theoretically Understanding Why Sgd Generalizes Better Than Adam in Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAdaptive gradient algorithms have become the default optimization tools in deep learning because of their fast convergence speed.\nBut they often suffer from worse generalization performance than Sgd  [ref]17 [ref]30 [ref]31. Subsequently, most works  [ref]30 [ref]31 [ref]17  empirically analyze this issue from the argument of flat and sharp minima defined on local curvature in  that flat minima often generalize better than sharp ones, as they observed that Sgd often converges to flatter minima than adaptive gradient algorithms, e.g. Adam.\nHowever, Sagun et al.  and He et al.  observed that the minima of modern deep networks at the asymmetric valleys where both steep and flat directions exist also generalize well, and Sgd often converges to these minima. So the conventional flat and sharp argument cannot explain these new results. This work theoretically shows that Sgd tends to converge to the minima whose local basin has larger Radon measure. It well explains the above new observations, as the minima with larger Radon measure often locate at the flat and asymmetric basins/valleys. Moreover, based on our results, exploring invariant Radon measure to parameter scaling in networks could resolve the issue in  that flat minima could become sharp via parameter scaling. See more details in Appendix C. Note, Adam could achieve better performance than Sgd when gradient clipping is required , e.g. attention models with gradient exploding issue, as adaptation in Adam provides a clipping effect. This work considers a general non-gradient-exploding setting, as it is more practical across many important tasks, e.g. classification. For theoretical generalization analysis, most works 5 7 6  only focus on analyzing Sgd. They formulated Sgd into Brownian motion based SDE via assuming gradient noise to be Gaussian.\nFor instance,\nJastrzkebski et al. 6 proved that the larger ratio of learning rate to mini-batch size in Sgd leads to flatter minima and better generalization.\nBut Simsekli et al. 3 empirically found that the gradient noise has heavy tails and can be characterized by 𝒮​α​𝒮𝒮𝛼𝒮\\mathcal{S}\\alpha\\mathcal{S} distribution instead of Gaussian distribution. Chaudhari et al. 7 also claimed that the trajectories of Sgd in deep networks are not Brownian motion. Then Simsekli et al. 3 formulated Sgd as a Lévy-driven SDE and adopted the results in 8 to show that Sgd tends to converge to flat minima on one dimensional problems. Pavlyukevich et al. 9 extended the one-dimensional SDE in 8 and analyzed escaping behaviors of Sgd along several fixed directions, differing from this work that analyzes dynamic underlying structures in gradient noise that greatly affect escaping behaviors of both Adam and Sgd. The literature targeting theoretically understanding the generalization degeneration of adaptive gradient algorithms are limited mainly due to their more complex algorithms. Wilson et al. [ref]17 constructed a binary classification problem and\nshowed that AdaGrad  tend to give undue influence to spurious features that have no effect on out-of-sample generalization. Unlike the above theoretical works that focus on analyzing Sgd only or special problems, we target at revealing the different convergence behaviors of adaptive gradient algorithms and Sgd and also analyzing their different generalization performance, which is of more practical interest especially in deep learning.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: Adaptive gradient algorithms have become the default optimization tools in deep learning because of their fast convergence speed.\nBut they often suffer from worse generalization performance than Sgd  [ref]17 [ref]30 [ref]31.
