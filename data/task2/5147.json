      "content": "Paper Title: Latent Video Diffusion Models for High-Fidelity Long Video Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. We evaluate our method on UCF-101 [ref]34, Sky Time-lapse [ref]43, and Taichi .\nWe train all our models with the resolution of 2562superscript2562256^{2} on\nthese datasets for unconditional video generation.\nThe short clips used for training are selected with the frame stride of 1 at a random location of one video.\nFor taichi, we select clips with the frame stride of 4 (i.e., skip three frames after selecting one) following prior work  [ref]46 to make the human motion more dynamic.\nDue to the limited number of videos in UCF-101 and TaiChi, we adopt the full dataset for training.\nFor the Sky Time-lapse dataset, we only train the model on its training split.\nAll models are trained under the unconditional setting with no guidance information provided, such as class label. Evaluation Metrics.\nFor quantitative evaluation, we report the commonly-used FVD  and KVD  for both short and long video generation.\nSpecifically, we calculate FVD and KVD between 2048 real and fake videos with 16 frames, which we refer to as FVD16 and KVD16, for short video evaluation.\nAll results for short video generation are calculated among ten runs and report their mean and standard deviation.\nFor long video evaluation, we estimate FVD and KVD among 512 samples in every non-overlapped 16-frame clip and report an FVD curve across 1024 frames calculated in 1 run, referred to as FVD1024. Baselines.\nWe compared our approach with seven competing baselines, including GAN-based methods: TGAN-v2 , DiGAN [ref]46, MoCoGAN-HD , and long-video GAN , autoregressive models TATS , and most recent diffusion-based models including Video Diffusion Models (VDM)  and MCVD .\nResults are collected from their original papers except for VDM.\nPlease note that VDM has mentioned in its main paper that it will not publish the source code. Thus we implement it by ourselves.\nDetailed implementations are documented in the supplement. Implementation Details.\nWe use the spatial and temporal downsampling factors of 8 and 4, respectively. We first train a 3D autoencoder, then fix its weights, and then start to train an unconditional LVDM on short video clips.\nAfter that, the LVDM-prediction and LVDM-interpolation models are resumed from the unconditional one.\nMore details are illustrated in supplementary materials.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: Datasets. We evaluate our method on UCF-101 [ref]34, Sky Time-lapse [ref]43, and Taichi .\nWe train all our models with the resolution of 2562superscript2562256^{2} on\nthese datasets for unconditional video generation.\nThe short clips used for\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
