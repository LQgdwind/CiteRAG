      "content": "Paper Title: HIER: Metric Learning Beyond Class Labels via Hierarchical Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLearning a discriminative and generalizable embedding space has been a vital step within\nmany machine learning tasks including content-based image retrieval  [ref]26 [ref]36 , face verification  , person re-identification [ref]6 , few-shot learning   , and representation learning   .\nDeep metric learning has aroused lots of attention as an effective tool for this purpose. Its goal is to learn an embedding space where semantically similar samples are close together and dissimilar ones are far apart.\nHence, the semantic affinity between samples serves as the main supervision for deep metric learning, and has long been given in the form of equivalence between their human-labeled classes.\n Although this type of supervision has been a basis of metric learning for decades, we argue that it now hinders further advances of the field.\nThe equivalence of human-labeled classes deals with only a tiny subset of possible relations between samples due to the following two reasons.\nFirst, the class equivalence is examined at only a single fixed level of semantic hierarchy, although different classes can be semantically similar if they share the same super-class.\nSecond, the equivalence is a binary relation that ignores the degree of semantic affinity between two classes.\nIt is difficult to overcome these two limitations since the semantic hierarchy of data is latent and only human-labeled classes are available from existing datasets in the standard metric learning setting.\nHowever, once they are resolved, one can open up the possibility of providing rich supervision beyond human-labeled classes.\n In this regard, we propose a new regularization method, called HIErarchical Regularization (HIER), to discover and deploy the latent semantic hierarchy of training data for metric learning. Since the semantic hierarchy can capture not only the predefined set of classes but also their sub-classes, super-classes, and affinities between them, our regularizer is expected to provide richer and more fine-grained supervision beyond inter-class separability induced by common metric learning losses.\nHowever, it is challenging to establish such a semantic hierarchy of data given their human-labeled classes only due to the absence of annotation for the semantic hierarchy.\n HIER tackles this challenge by learning hierarchical proxies in hyperbolic space.\nThe hierarchical proxies are learnable parameters, and each of them is trained to serve as an ancestor of a group of data or other proxies to approximate the semantic hierarchy. Also, HIER deals with the proxies in hyperbolic space since the space is well-suited to represent hierarchical structures of the proxies and data.\nIt has been reported in literature that Euclidean space with zero curvature is not optimal for representing data exhibiting such a semantic hierarchy .\nIn contrast, hyperbolic space with constant negative curvature can represent the semantic hierarchy of data effectively using relatively small dimensions since its volume increases exponentially as its Poincaré radius increases  . To be specific, HIER is designed as a soft approximation of hierarchical clustering   , where similar data should be near by one another in a tree-structured hierarchy while dissimilar ones should be placed in separate branches of the hierarchy (See Figure 1).\nDuring training, HIER constructs a triplet of samples or proxies, in which two of them are similar and the other is dissimilar based on their hyperbolic distances.\nThen, the proxy closest to the entire triplet is considered as the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the triplet in a semantic hierarchy; likewise, we identify another proxy as the LCA of only the similar pair in the same manner.\nGiven the triplet and two LCAs (proxies), HIER\nencourages that each of the LCAs and its associated members of the triplet are close together and that the dissimilar one of the triplet is far apart from the LCA of the similar pair.\nThis allows the hierarchical proxies to approximate a semantic hierarchy of data in the embedding space, without any off-the-shelf module for pseudo hierarchical labeling . The major contribution of our work from the perspective of conventional metric learning is three-fold: We study a new and effective way of providing semantic supervision beyond human-labeled classes, which has not been actively studied in metric learning     . HIER consistently improved performance over the state-of-the-art metric learning losses when integrated with them, and consequently achieved the best records in almost all settings on four public benchmarks. By taking advantage of hyperbolic space, HIER substantially improved performance particularly on low-dimensional embedding spaces. Also, when regarding our work as a hyperbolic metric learning method, a remarkable contribution of HIER is that it allows taking full advantage of both hyperbolic embedding space and the great legacy of conventional metric learning since it can be seamlessly incorporated with any metric learning losses based on spherical embedding spaces.\nThe only prior studies on hyperbolic metric learning   are not compatible with conventional losses for metric learning since they learn a distance metric directly on hyperbolic space, in which, unlike the spherical embedding spaces, norms of embedding vectors vary significantly.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Learning a discriminative and generalizable embedding space has been a vital step within\nmany machine learning tasks including content-based image retrieval  [ref]26 [ref]36 , face verification  , person re-identification [ref]6 , few-shot learning   , and representation learning   .\nDeep metric learning has aroused lots of attention as an effective tool\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
