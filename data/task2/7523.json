      "content": "Paper Title: Datasets for Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDuring the construction of certain general instruction fine-tuning datasets, multiple methods are concurrently employed to leverage the strengths of each, thereby enhancing the datasets’ qualities. The three methods are mentioned in previous sections, and through various combinations, four scenarios can be generated: HG & CI, HG & MC, CI & MC, and HG & CI & MC. Here, “HG” stands for Human-Generated Datasets, “MC” for Model-Constructed Datasets, and “CI” for Collection and Improvement of Existing Datasets. HG & CI. (1) While collecting data from other datasets, manual creation of data is concurrently undertaken to supplement missing task types. Firefly  gathers 23 common Chinese NLP tasks and constructs numerous tasks related to Chinese culture, such as couplets, poetry creation, and more. Each task is accompanied by manually written instruction templates to ensure high-quality and richness of the data. (2) The collected data undergoes manual selection. LIMA-sft  includes 1330 instructions carefully chosen and prepared by human experts to validate the importance of high-quality instruction data. HG & MC. Combine manually authored data with user-model dialogue data. The InstructGPT-sft dataset , used in training the InstructGPT model  by OpenAI, has two sources: one authored by annotators and the other consisting of instructions submitted via API to early models. CI & MC. (1) Using other datasets as instruction inputs and selecting different models to generate responses. Alpaca_GPT4_data  employs instructions from the Alpaca_data  as input, generating responses using GPT-4 [ref]2. Alpaca_GPT4_data_zh  and Wizard_evol_instruct_zh dataset  translate English instructions into Chinese before invoking models to generate Chinese responses. Bactrain-X  utilizes a translation API to translate instruction inputs from the Alpaca_data and databricks-dolly-15K into 51 languages, then inputs them into ChatGPT to obtain responses. GPT4All  uses instructions from five public datasets as input and generates responses using GPT-3.5-Turbo. LogiCoT  and OpenOrca  follow similar methods. GuanacoDataset363636https://guanaco-model.github.io/ expands the language of instruction data from English to Chinese and Japanese. LaMini-LM  uses the model to simultaneously generate synthetic instructions and responses corresponding to real instructions. These datasets reference existing instructions and are secondarily constructed with the assistance of models. (2) Using open-source datasets as seed instructions to guide the generation of dialogues between models. Baize  samples “seeds” from specific datasets, allowing ChatGPT to engage in self-dialogue and batch generate high-quality multi-turn dialogue data. The dialogues cover both general and some vertical domains. (3) Directly constructing input-output text pairs using existing data. LongForm  generates complete instructions for existing pre-trained corpus documents using LLMs, then expands them using structured corpus examples and task instances. Luotuo-QA-B  instructs the model to generate five input-output text pairs for summaries or news content from three datasets. HG & CI & MC. The six datasets combine the three construction methods mentioned in previous sections. The relevant information is as follows. (1) COIG . The COIG dataset consists of 191K Chinese instructions categorized into five types. Translated instructions are derived from open-source datasets, and the translation process involves three stages: automatic translation, manual verification, and manual correction. Exam instructions are primarily sourced from Chinese college entrance exams, high school entrance exams, and civil service exams. Human value alignment instructions consist of two series—one focusing on general human value alignment in Chinese regions, and the other on human value alignment specific to certain countries or regional cultures. Counterfactual correction multi-round chat are built based on the CN-DBpedia knowledge graph dataset , addressing hallucination issues in LLMs. Leetcode instructions gather programming-related prompts. (2) HC3 . The HC3 dataset has both Chinese and English versions, totaling 37K Q&A pairs. The dataset is designed to compare responses between human experts and ChatGPT across various domains. It can be used for research in areas such as instruction fine-tuning, human value alignment, model response characteristics, and more. (3) Phoenix-sft-data-v1 . The 464K multilingual dialogue data in the Phoenix-sft-data-v1 dataset is primarily divided into two parts: single-turn instructions and multi-turn conversations. Single-turn instructions include Chinese and English instructions from Alpaca, translated multilingual instructions, and user-generated multilingual instructions. Multi-turn conversations mainly originate from ShareGPT and Discord373737https://discord.com/. (4) TigerBot_sft_en & TigerBot_sft_zh . These two datasets are fine-tuning data for the TigerBot , containing a large amount of collected open-source data and self-developed data. The construction of the dataset mainly follows five principles: annotating and summarizing 10 instruction categories and 120 sub-task types based on the distribution of instructions; generating instructions using the Self-Instruct method; organizing question and answer data based on manual question generation, web search, and other methods; converting and cleaning the format based on public datasets; the overall data distribution conforms to the natural distribution of instructions. (5) Aya Collection . The Aya Collection is a comprehensive and large corpus of datasets designed for training multilingual models, aimed at researchers worldwide. It comprises three primary sources of data: templated data, translated data, and the Aya Dataset . Templated data involves collaboration with fluent speakers to create templates for automatic dataset expansion into various languages. Translated data involves translating a subset of 19 datasets into 101 languages using the NLLB 3.3B machine translation model . The Aya Dataset is a human-annotated subset of the overall collection.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: other datasets as instruction inputs and selecting different models to generate responses. Alpaca_GPT4_data  employs instructions from the Alpaca_data  as input, generating responses using GPT-4 [ref]2.
