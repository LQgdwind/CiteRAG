      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey on Interpretable Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe surveyed recent work in reinforcement learning (RL) related to the important concern of interpretability (and its related notion of explainability).\nWe proposed a definition of interpretability in RL, which contrary to the general setting of explainable artificial intelligence, leads to different levels of transparency in the components that play a role in RL.\nIn particular, we first discussed the studies that focus on interpretable inputs (e.g., observations, but possibly other types of information).\nMoreover, we provided an overview of approaches that deal with learning an interpretable transition model, which is significant for interpretable model-based RL, but also those that deal with learning an interpretable preference model, which is fundamental to justify action selection.\nThen, we surveyed the papers on learning interpretable policies, which constitute arguably the most critical part of interpretable RL.\nFor completeness, we also provided a short review of work related to post-hoc explainability.\nFinally, we highlighted a few open problems and future research directions that we deemed as particularly relevant. Although concerns around the ethical implications of algorithmic and automation deployment are nothing new , the field of AI ethics still seems at its infancy as we begin to witness the extent of the influence and impact that these systems may have on our societal fabric when deployed.\nIn this regard, a responsible practice for the design, implementation, use, and monitoring/auditing of AI-driven systems is greatly impeded by the non-intelligibity of current algorithms.\nAs RL-based systems become more widespread, questions related to interpretability become consequently increasingly pressing.\nOne could even contend that interpretable RL is one of the key deadlocks to overcome to make RL a more functional method for being deployed in real-life\nWhile it may be hard to achieve a fully intelligible RL model, one may envision hierarchical RL approaches where some parts may not be completely transparent—e.g., at the low-level—but a maximum of other parts—e.g., at the subgoal level—are thoroughly interpretable. While the act of opening up the blackbox do not suffice to instantly disclose a thorough understanding of its social implications—since we “need to look across the system, rather than merely inside” (as noted by [ref]259)—algorithmic intelligibility appears as a promising step towards further algorithmic accountability and more trustworthy AI. We encourage the curious reader to look further at the generous work of other researchers investigating these tangent questions (such as [ref]9     to mention only a few).\n\nReference markers found: [259]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]259: of opening up the blackbox do not suffice to instantly disclose a thorough understanding of its social implications—since we “need to look across the system, rather than merely inside” (as noted by [ref]259)—algorithmic intelligibility appears as a promising step towards further algorithmic accountability and more trustworthy AI.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
