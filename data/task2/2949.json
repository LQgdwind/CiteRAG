      "content": "Paper Title: Towards artificial general intelligence via a multimodal foundation model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo demonstrate how large-scale multimodal learning can benefit single-modal skills and also improve the imagination ability on single-modal tasks, we conduct zero-shot experiments on two Chinese news classification datasets.\nThe first dataset is Toutiao News , which has 15 classes and a total of around 380K samples. The second dataset is THUCNews [ref]41, which has 14 classes and around 840K samples in total. Since the contents in these two datasets are all texts, we only need the text encoder of our BriVL. Concretely, we first obtain class embeddings by inputting class names into the text encoder. Further, for each piece of news, we only use its title to obtain its embedding via the text encoder. Finally, we compute the cosine similarities between each title embedding and class embeddings to make predictions. The following methods are chosen for comparison: (1) RoBERTa-base [ref]42: it is an off-the-shelf Chinese language model pre-trained by the original authors on a large Chinese dataset with a total of 5.4B words. (2) RoBERTa-base (finetune): we finetune the pre-trained RoBERTa-base on a subset of our WSCD dataset (i.e., only the text data of 22M image-text pairs is used). (3) BriVL w/ RoBERTa-base: it is a small version of our standard BriVL as we reduce the CNN from EfficientNet-B7  to EfficientNet-B5 and also the text backbone from RoBERTa-large to RoBERTa-base. We pre-train this small version with the aforementioned 22M image-text pairs. (4) RoBERTa-large: it is the larger version of RoBERTa-base and is also pre-trained by the original authors. Its pre-training data is the same as that of RoBERTa-base. (5) BriVL w/ RoBERTa-large: our standard BriVL pre-trained on the whole WSCD. The zero-shot classification results on Toutiao News and THUCNews are shown in Fig. 5a. It can be seen that: (1) The results of RoBERTa-base are lower than those of RoBERTa-large, which is expected since the latter has more parameters and a larger model capacity. (2) On both datasets, RoBERTa-base (finetune) has limited performance gains over RoBERTa-base, while BriVL w/ RoBERTa-base outperforms RoBERTa-base by large margins. This clearly indicates the advantage of cross-modal learning over single-modal learning, given that the finetuning data of RoBERTa-base (finetune) and BriVL w/ RoBERTa-base is both from the 22M subset of WSCD. (3) When it comes to RoBERTa-large, our BriVL w/ RoBERTa-large also leads to much better results than RoBERTa-large. Moreover, in Fig. 5b, we present the performance gain/loss of our BriVL w/ RoBERTa-large comparing to RoBERTa-large on each category of Toutiao News. We can observe that the performance of BriVL decreases only on 5 categories but increases on the other 10, validating that the single-modal imagination/association ability can be improved by multimodal learning. Further, in Fig. 5c, we show top-30 phrase retrieval results of the category names “sports” and “automobile” using these two models to take a closer look. Concretely, we use a Chinese phrase list from Jieba  as the candidate list, which contains 347,728 phrases. Then we obtain the text embeddings of all candidates using RoBERTa-large and BriVL w/ RoBERTa-large, respectively. For each model and each category name, we compute the category name embedding and retrieve top-30 phrases by comparing it with all candidate embeddings using the cosine similarity. Finally, we visualize the results with the UMAP algorithm [ref]45. For “sports”, we can see that our BriVL relates it to phrases with a higher variety than RoBERTa-large does. However, for “automobile”, the retrieved top-30 phrases of our BriVL are more monotonous.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: conduct zero-shot experiments on two Chinese news classification datasets.\nThe first dataset is Toutiao News , which has 15 classes and a total of around 380K samples.
