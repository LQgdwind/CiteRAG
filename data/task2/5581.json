      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Generalize towards Unseen Domains via a Content-Aware Style Invariant Model for Disease Detection from Chest X-rays\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDomain Adaptation (DA): Most past DA approaches have been developed to minimize measures of distances between the source domain and the target domain features  . Recent methods for DA can be categorized into adversarial training-based domain alignment  , Fourier transform-based methods , generative adversarial networks (GANs) based methods (unpaired image-to-image translation into source/target domain)  [ref]37, high-level feature map alignment based on similarity measurement  , gradient reversal based alignment methods , and others. Luo et al. adopted class-wise adversarial training to alleviate feature differences across common categories of two datasets to mine the knowledge from the external thoracic disease dataset to improve the performance of the classifier on the internal thoracic disease dataset. However, the discriminators require explicit domain labels. Zhang et al. proposed a domain, instance, and perturbation invariance learning-based framework for utilizing unsupervised domain adaptive thorax disease classification. However, this method requires access to the target domain, which is not often available. Diao et al.[ref]37 proposed a histogram-based GAN methodology for DA that captured the variations in global intensity changes by transforming histograms along with individual pixel intensities. This method is adapted at test time, which is often inconvenient. Yang et al. employed the Fourier transform to swap the low-frequency amplitude components between the source and target images while keeping the phase components unaltered to diversify the training dataset. However, this augmentation method is more image-based than goal-oriented. A significant limitation of the DA methods is that they require explicit domain labels, i.e., source and target domains or multiple domains, which is often unavailable in most real-world medical applications due to annotation cost or privacy reasons. In addition, most real-world medical datasets usually consist of data from multiple medical sites using various scanners, i.e., ambiguous domain labels. Moreover, they require re-training during application on new target domains, which is inconvenient and impractical for deploying models in real-world medical image analysis applications. Domain Generalization (DG): DG approaches aim to utilize the source domains only during training and generalize toward any unseen target domain without requiring prior access or re-training . DG is considered more challenging than DA approaches, as the target domain samples are not exposed during the training phase. DG methods can be categorized into three broad approaches, i.e., augmentation-based methods  [ref]13 [ref]14, alignment-based methods  , and meta-learning-based methods  . DG methods can be further divided based on the number of source domains utilized during training: multi-source DG and single-source DG. Multi-source DG assumes multiple relevant domains are available during training. Utilizing multiple source domains allows a deep learning model to discover stable patterns across source domains to better generalize to unseen domains. In contrast, the single-source DG is trained with only one source domain and is expected to generalize toward unseen domains. Wang et al. performed the mixup operation of CXRs from multiple domains to create a virtual domain and utilized ensemble learning to improve performance in unseen domains. However, this approach requires at least two available domains to perform the mixup. Zhang et al.[ref]13 exploited a series of extensive deep-stacked augmentations during training to simulate the expected domain shift to address DG on unseen data. However, data augmentation-based methods often require carefully selecting augmentation methods to resemble the unseen domain’s appearance. Recent literature studies have shown that CNNs demonstrate a strong bias toward style rather than content and are sensitive to any shift from image statistics that they are trained on, limiting their DG capability  . Motivated by the impact of neural style transfer on the domain shift, a number of DG methods have been proposed based on neural style randomization. DG methods based on style randomization can be divided into two categories, i.e., feature-level and image-level randomizations. The feature-level randomization includes the perturbation of feature statistics from intermediate convolutional layers of the backbone model. Nuriel et al. applied adaptive instance normalization to swap the style statistics between activations of permuted and non-permuted samples in a mini-batch to reduce the representation of global statistics in the classifier model. However, they merely swap the style statistics, limiting the sample diversity to the available source domains. Zhou et al. proposed a novel parameter-free module MixStyle that synthesizes new domains by probabilistically mixing feature statistics between instances. Nevertheless, insufficient diversity still exists due to reliance on source domains. Nam et al. utilized adaptive instance normalization along with adversarial learning to reduce the intrinsic style bias. However, the style-biased network increases training cost and time. Tang et al. proposed two novel modules named CrossNorm and SelfNorm for swapping feature statistics and recalibrating the statistics through attention to both diversify and bridge the gap between source and target domains. Though the SelfNorm is dynamic, the CrossNorm is limited to training data. Wang et al. developed an encoder-decoder-like architecture named FSR to integrate random noise with the original style parameters to generate new style embeddings. However, they use the pre-defined parameters, i.e., channel-wise mean and standard deviation, as the style embeddings. Instead of pre-defined parameters, pixel-wise learnable style parameters may yield more diverse and hard style statistics, resulting in a more robust DG model. The image-level style randomization-based methods try to diversify the training dataset by constructing hard stylized samples. Zhong et al. proposed a novel augmentation approach, named adversarial style augmentation (AdvStyle), to generate diverse stylized images by adversarially learning the image-level style features to reduce overfitting on the source domain and be robust towards style variations of unknown domains. However, the perturbation diversity depends on the adversarial gradient. Yamashita et al.[ref]14 introduced a form of data augmentation named STRAP, based on random style transfer with medically irrelevant style sources for improving DG performance. However, this approach requires training an additional model to perform the stylization. Previous image-level and feature-level style randomization-based DG approaches synthesize style or swap style statistics based on the source domains available during training. Thus, the diversity of the augmented samples is limited and sensitive to the available source domains. Furthermore, the exploitation of semantic content consistency between the original and perturbed activation feature maps will allow for robust feature learning and maximize the effectiveness of style augmentation for the out-of-distribution performance of the model. Overall, to the best of our knowledge, the application of neural style randomization for deriving a DG model for thoracic disease detection from CXRs is not well studied. A systematic exploration of the potential of extracting content-specific (pathology-dependent) but style-invariant domain-agnostic features may further improve DG performance.
