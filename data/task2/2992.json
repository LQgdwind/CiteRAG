      "content": "Paper Title: Interpreting Representation Quality of DNNs for 3D Point Cloud Processing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we conducted comparative studies to analyze properties of different point cloud regions of different DNNs. Ideally, a well-trained DNN for 3D point cloud processing was supposed to be robust to the rotation and translation, and the DNN was supposed to mainly use the scale and local 3D structures for inference. Besides, considering the 3D structures of objects in benchmark 3D datasets [ref]46 [ref]49 were usually simple, most adjacent regions in an object had continuous and similar 3D structures. Therefore, a well-trained DNN was supposed to have similar regional attributions among these neighboring regions. We also analyzed how complex is the 3D structure that can be encoded by a classic DNN. We used our method to analyze five classic DNNs for 3D point cloud processing, including the PointNet 6, the PointNet++ , the DGCNN , the non-dynamic version of DGCNN (i.e. GCNN), and the PointConv . All DNNs were learned based on the ModelNet10 dataset [ref]46 and the ShapeNet part222We only used part of the ShapeNet part dataset due to the time limitation. Please see our supplemental materials for details. dataset [ref]49. We followed 6 to only use 1024 points of each point cloud to train all DNNs. Each point cloud was partitioned to n=32ùëõ32n=32 regions11footnotemark: 1 for the computation of all metrics. Note that all DNNs used in our paper were well-trained. The testing accuracy was shown in Table¬†1.We also reported the testing accuracy of other DNNs trained on the ModelNet10 dataset, including RotationNet , 3DmFV-Net , KCNet 4, and GIFT . These four DNNs obtained the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th testing accuracy according the ModelNet10 Benchmark Leaderboard111Data from https://modelnet.cs.princeton.edu/.. In particular, the previous study  has discovered that people could use rotations to attack DNNs for 3D point cloud processing. Therefore, we used the adversarial training to learn a GCNN222In tables, adv-GCNN denoted the adversarially trained GCNN. w.r.t. the attacks based on rotations and translations of point clouds, so as to improve the GCNN‚Äôs robustness to the rotation and translation. We extended the method in  to generate such adversarial examples to attack the GCNN. Please see our supplemental materials for details. The objective function was minw‚Å°ùîºx‚Äã[maxT‚Å°Loss‚Äã(x‚Ä≤=T‚Äã(x),ytruth;w)]subscriptùë§subscriptùîºùë•delimited-[]subscriptùëáLosssuperscriptùë•‚Ä≤ùëáùë•superscriptùë¶truthùë§\\min_{w}\\mathbb{E}_{x}\\left[\\max_{T}\\textit{Loss}(x^{\\prime}=T(x),y^{\\rm truth};w)\\right], where wùë§w denoted the parameter of the GCNN. Comparative studies have revealed the following effects of the adversarial training (using rotations and translations for attack, instead of using perturbations) on knowledge representations. The adversarial training shifted the attention of DNN from orientations and positions to structural information (including global structures in normal samples, see Fig.¬†5), thereby increasing the sensitivity to 3D structures (see Table¬†2 and Fig.¬†3 (a)). The adversarial training also decreased the correlation between the regional sensitivity and the regional attribution (see Table¬†3), and increased the spatial smoothness of knowledge representations (see Table¬†4). Comparative study 1, explaining the regional sensitivity of DNNs. Table¬†2 shows six types of regional sensitivities of six DNNs learned on the ModelNet10 dataset and the ShapeNet part dataset. In terms of translation sensitivity, PointNet was relatively sensitive to the translation, because PointNet extracted features from global coordinates of points, thereby being sensitive to the translation. In contrast, PointNet++ and PointConv were robust to translation, because these two DNNs encoded relative coordinates. Particularly, PointConv did not use global coordinates during the inference process, thereby yielding the lowest translation sensitivity (see the point cloud with the darkest blue in the second row of Fig.¬†3 (a)). In terms of scale sensitivity, PointNet++ was relatively sensitive to the scale, because PointNet++ encoded features of neighborhood with fixed scales. Besides, because adversarial training forced the GCNN to remove attention from rotation-sensitive features and translation-sensitive features, the adversarially trained GCNN paid more attention to structural information. Therefore, compared with the original GCNN, the adversarially trained GCNN had higher sensitivity to local 3D structures. Furthermore, we also obtained the following conclusions. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet Rotation robustness was the Achilles‚Äô heel of classic DNNs for 3D point cloud processing. As Table¬†2 and Fig.¬†3 (a) show, all DNNs were sensitive to rotations except for the adversarially trained GCNN. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet PointNet failed to encode local 3D structures. In terms of sensitivity to local 3D structures, PointNet was the least sensitive DNN (see Table¬†2). It was because convolution operations of the PointNet encoded the information of each point independently, i.e. the PointNet did not encode the information of neighboring points/regions. This conclusion is also verified by the phenomenon that PointNet had darker blue point clouds than other DNNs (see the last three rows of Fig.¬†3 (a)). ‚àô‚àô\\bullet Most DNNs usually failed to extract rotation-robust features from 3D points at edges and corners. Given a point cloud xùë•x, we selected the most rotation-sensitive region i‚àósuperscriptùëñi^{*} (shown as black boxes in Fig.¬†3 (b)). We rotated the point cloud xùë•x to the orientations that maximized and minimized the attribution of region i‚àósuperscriptùëñi^{*}, i.e. ùúΩ1=arg‚Å°maxùúΩ‚Å°œïx‚Ä≤‚Äã(i‚àó)subscriptùúΩ1subscriptùúΩsubscriptitalic-œïsuperscriptùë•‚Ä≤superscriptùëñ\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{1}=\\arg\\max_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\phi_{x^{\\prime}}(i^{*}) and ùúΩ2=arg‚Å°minùúΩ‚Å°œïx‚Ä≤‚Äã(i‚àó)subscriptùúΩ2subscriptùúΩsubscriptitalic-œïsuperscriptùë•‚Ä≤superscriptùëñ\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{2}=\\arg\\min_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\phi_{x^{\\prime}}(i^{*}). Fig.¬†3 (b) visualizes regional attributions of point clouds rotated by ùúΩ1subscriptùúΩ1\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{1} and ùúΩ2subscriptùúΩ2\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{2}. We found that rotation-sensitive regions were usually distributed on the edges and corners, which verified our conclusion. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet Most DNNs usually could not ignore features of rotation-sensitive points at edges and corners. Table¬†3 shows that the Pearson correlation coefficient 5 between each region‚Äôs average strength of attribution over different rotations (i.e. ùîºùúΩ‚Äã[|œïx‚Ä≤‚Äã(i)|]subscriptùîºùúΩdelimited-[]subscriptitalic-œïsuperscriptùë•‚Ä≤ùëñ\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}[|\\phi_{x^{\\prime}}(i)|], s.t. x‚Ä≤=Trotation‚Äã(x|ùúΩ)superscriptùë•‚Ä≤subscriptùëárotationconditionalùë•ùúΩx^{\\prime}=T_{\\rm rotation}(x|\\boldsymbol{\\theta})) and this region‚Äôs rotation sensitivity ai‚Äã(x)subscriptùëéùëñùë•a_{i}(x) is much larger than Pearson correlation coefficients between the attribution and other sensitivities. This means that rotation-sensitive regions (which were usually distributed on the edges and corners) usually had large regional attributions, which verified our conclusion. Besides, Table¬†3 also shows that the adversarial training reduced the correlation between the regional sensitivity and the regional attribution. Fig.¬†4 (a) visualizes the positive correlation between the regional rotation sensitivity and the regional attribution of the PointNet. Comparative study 2, explaining the spatial smoothness of knowledge representations. Table¬†4 shows the non-smoothness of knowledge representations encoded by different DNNs. Note that the adversarially trained GCNN was significantly biased to the knife category. In other words, the adversarially trained GCNN classified the empty input as the knife category with a high confidence (please see our supplementary materials for details). Therefore, to enable fair comparisons, we also reported the spatial non-smoothness of the adversarially trained GCNN on all other categories except the knife. We discovered that without considering the biased knife category, adversarial training increased the spatial smoothness of knowledge representations. Fig¬†4 (b) also verified this conclusion. Comparative study 3, explaining the interaction complexity of DNNs. Fig.¬†5 shows multi-order interactions of different DNNs. From this figure, we discovered the following new insights. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet Most DNNs failed to encode high-order interactions (i.e. global and large-scale 3D structures). As Fig.¬†5 (a) shows, no matter given normal samples or adversarial samples333Here, we used rotations for attack, instead of using perturbations., classic DNNs encoded extremely low-order interactions. This indicated that most DNNs did not extract complex and large-scale 3D structures from normal samples. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet The adversarial training (using rotations and translations for attack, instead of using perturbations) increased the effects of extremely high-order interactions. As Fig.¬†5 (a) shows, the adversarially trained GCNN encoded extremely low-order interactions and extremely high-order interactions (i.e. the global structures of objects) from normal samples. Because the GCNN was forced to sophisticatedly select relatively complex rotation-robust features among all potential features. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet Rotation sensitivity of regions with out-of-distribution high-order interactions (i.e. abnormal complex and large-scale 3D structures) were larger than the average sensitivity over all regions. In fact, there are two types of high-order interactions. Unlike the above two insights describing whether or not a DNN encoded high-order interactions on normal samples, this insight mainly focused on abnormal out-of-distribution high-order interactions in a DNN. When a point cloud was attacked by adversarial rotations55footnotemark: 5, the adversarial rotation55footnotemark: 5 would generate out-of-distribution high-order interactions (i.e. abnormal complex and large-scale 3D structures) to attack the DNN. We measured interactions between the most rotation-sensitive region i‚àósuperscriptùëñi^{*} and its neighbors j‚ààùí©‚Äã(i‚àó)ùëóùí©superscriptùëñj\\in\\mathcal{N}(i^{*}) among all input point clouds, i.e. ùîºx‚ààX‚Äã[|ùîºj‚ààùí©‚Äã(i‚àó)‚Äã[Ix(m)‚Äã(i‚àó,j)]|]subscriptùîºùë•ùëãdelimited-[]subscriptùîºùëóùí©superscriptùëñdelimited-[]superscriptsubscriptùêºùë•ùëösuperscriptùëñùëó\\mathbb{E}_{x\\in X}\\big{[}|\\mathbb{E}_{j\\in\\mathcal{N}(i^{*})}[I_{x}^{(m)}(i^{*},j)]|\\big{]}. As Fig.¬†5 (b) shows, rotation-sensitive regions usually encoded relatively more high-order interactions than the overall interaction distribtuion over all regions. This indicates that compared to most other regions, rotation-sensitive regions paid more attention to high-order interactions, although low-order interactions of rotation-sensitive regions increased too. Broad applicability of the proposed metrics.\nWe also conducted experiments on an AutoEncoder for 3D point cloud reconstruction task and rotation-invariant DNNs for 3D point cloud classification, in order to further demonstrate the broad applicability of the proposed metrics. For the AutoEncoder for 3D point cloud reconstruction task, we used all layers before the fully-connected layers in PointNet 6 as the encoder and used the decoder in the FoldingNet  as the decoder. We took v‚Äã(S)=(z‚Äã(N)‚àíz‚Äã(‚àÖ))‚ä§‚Äã(z‚Äã(S)‚àíz‚Äã(‚àÖ))‚Äñz‚Äã(N)‚àíz‚Äã(‚àÖ)‚Äñ2ùë£ùëÜsuperscriptùëßùëÅùëßtopùëßùëÜùëßsubscriptnormùëßùëÅùëß2v(S)=\\frac{(z(N)-z(\\emptyset))^{\\top}(z(S)-z(\\emptyset))}{||z(N)-z(\\emptyset)||_{2}} as the reward score in Equation¬†(1), where z‚Äã(S)ùëßùëÜz(S) denotes the output vector of the encoder given the input point cloud consisting of regions in SùëÜS. This reward score measures the utility of the encoder output z‚Äã(S)ùëßùëÜz(S) given regions in SùëÜS along the direction of z‚Äã(N)‚àíz‚Äã(‚àÖ)ùëßùëÅùëßz(N)-z(\\emptyset). The AutoEncoder was learned based on the ModelNet10 dataset. We measured the rotation sensitivity (0.099¬±plus-or-minus\\pm0.043), the translation sensitivity (0.152¬±plus-or-minus\\pm0.086), and the scale sensitivity (0.045¬±plus-or-minus\\pm0.042) of the AutoEncoder. Compared with results in Table¬†2, we found that (1) the AutoEncoder for reconstruction was also sensitive to rotation; (2) the AutoEncoder for 3D point cloud reconstruction was more sensitive to translation than the DNN for classification; (3) the AutoEncoder for reconstruction was sensitive to the scale change. Besides, we followed 2 to revise PointNet++ and DGCNN to be rotation-invariant DNNs. We measured the rotation sensitivity of the rotation-invariant PointNet++ (0.002¬±plus-or-minus\\pm0.001) and DGCNN (0.010¬±plus-or-minus\\pm0.004). Compared with results in Table¬†2, we found that rotation-invariant DNNs were much more robust to rotations than traditional DNNs (even the adversarially-trained DNN). Effects of data augmentation on sensitivities.\nWe conducted comparative studies to explore the effects of data augmentation on sensitivities, including translation augmentation, scale augmentation, rotation augmentation around the y-axis, and rotation augmentation around a random axis. We conducted experiments on PointNet and DGCNN. To explore the effects of each of the above augmentation on sensitivities, we learned two versions of each network architecture, i.e. one network with the specific augmentation and the other network without the specific augmentation. Please see our supplementary materials for more details about different versions of each network architecture. All DNNs were learned based on the ModelNet10 dataset. Table¬†5 shows that rotation/translation/scale augmentation decreased the rotation/translation/scale sensitivity of a DNN. Besides, we compared the effects of rotation augmentation around a random axis and the effects of adversarial training on the rotation sensitivity. We conducted experiments on DGCNN and GCNN. We trained two versions of DGCNN and GCNN, one with rotation augmentation around a random axis (DGCNN, 0.052 ¬±plus-or-minus\\pm0.021; GCNN, 0.048¬±plus-or-minus\\pm0.024) and one with the adversarial training using rotations for attack (DGCNN, 0.036¬±plus-or-minus\\pm0.015; GCNN, 0.028¬±plus-or-minus\\pm0.016). We found that compared with the rotation augmentation, the adversarial training w.r.t. rotation-based attacks had a greater impact on the rotation sensitivity.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: to the rotation and translation, and the DNN was supposed to mainly use the scale and local 3D structures for inference.
