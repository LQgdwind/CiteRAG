      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum advantage and CSP complexityThis work will appear in the Proceedings of the 39th Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS’24). The research leading to these results was supported by UKRI EP/X024431/1.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLet 𝐘𝐘\\mathbf{Y} be a relational structure and, as usual, let ℍℍ\\mathbb{H} be a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. If 𝐘𝐘\\mathbf{Y} does not have quantum advantage over ℍℍ\\mathbb{H}, any structure 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} such that 𝐗→ℍ𝐘subscript→ℍ𝐗𝐘\\mathbf{X}\\to_{\\mathbb{H}}\\mathbf{Y} admits a homomorphism to 𝐘𝐘\\mathbf{Y}. Suppose now that 𝐘𝐘\\mathbf{Y} does have quantum advantage over ℍℍ\\mathbb{H}. Can we still get some partial information of classical type from the fact that a quantum homomorphism 𝐗→ℍ𝐘subscript→ℍ𝐗𝐘\\mathbf{X}\\to_{\\mathbb{H}}\\mathbf{Y} exists?\nA natural way of expressing this partial information — as opposed to the complete information “𝐗→𝐘→𝐗𝐘\\mathbf{X}\\to\\mathbf{Y}” — is by asking that a quantum homomorphism 𝐗→ℍ𝐘subscript→ℍ𝐗𝐘\\mathbf{X}\\to_{\\mathbb{H}}\\mathbf{Y} should at least guarantee the existence of a classical homomorphism 𝐗→𝐘′→𝐗superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{X}\\to\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime} for some structure 𝐘′superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}. Notice that, if this is the case, we must have 𝐘→𝐘′→𝐘superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{Y}\\to\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}, since 𝐘→ℍ𝐘subscript→ℍ𝐘𝐘\\mathbf{Y}\\to_{\\mathbb{H}}\\mathbf{Y}. We now give a formal description of this more general version of quantum advantage. Let 𝐘𝐘\\mathbf{Y} and 𝐘′superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime} be two σ𝜎\\sigma-structures such that 𝐘→𝐘′→𝐘superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{Y}\\to\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}. We say that the pair (𝐘,𝐘′)𝐘superscript𝐘′(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}) has quantum advantage over ℍℍ\\mathbb{H} if there exists a σ𝜎\\sigma-structure 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} such that 𝐗→ℍ𝐘subscript→ℍ𝐗𝐘\\mathbf{X}\\to_{\\mathbb{H}}\\mathbf{Y} but 𝐗↛𝐘′↛𝐗superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{X}\\not\\to\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}. In other words, (𝐘,𝐘′)𝐘superscript𝐘′(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}) does not have quantum advantage over ℍℍ\\mathbb{H} if and only if a quantum homomorphism 𝐗→ℍ𝐘subscript→ℍ𝐗𝐘\\mathbf{X}\\to_{\\mathbb{H}}\\mathbf{Y} guarantees at least a classical homomorphism 𝐗→𝐘′→𝐗superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{X}\\to\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}.\nSince the composition of a quantum and a classical homomorphism is a quantum homomorphism, we easily see that, if (𝐘,𝐘′)𝐘superscript𝐘′(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}) has quantum advantage over ℍℍ\\mathbb{H}, then the same must hold for both 𝐘𝐘\\mathbf{Y} and 𝐘′superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime} individually. We will prove that the converse implication is not true in general. If dim(ℍ)≥3dimensionℍ3\\dim(\\mathbb{H})\\geq 3,\nthere exists a pair of relational structures 𝐘→𝐘′→𝐘superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{Y}\\to\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime} such that 𝐘𝐘\\mathbf{Y} and 𝐘′superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}, but not (𝐘,𝐘′)𝐘superscript𝐘′(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}), have quantum advantage over ℍℍ\\mathbb{H}. It turns out that the framework we developed in the previous sections can be smoothly readapted to capture this generalised version of quantum advantage. As a consequence, just like the occurrence of quantum advantage for a single structure is linked to CSP complexity, we shall see that the occurrence of quantum advantage for a pair of structures is linked to the complexity of a promise version of CSPs that we now describe. For two σ𝜎\\sigma-structures 𝐘𝐘\\mathbf{Y} and 𝐘′superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime} such that 𝐘→𝐘′→𝐘superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{Y}\\to\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}, the promise CSPCSP\\operatorname{CSP} parameterised by 𝐘𝐘\\mathbf{Y} and 𝐘′superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime} (in symbols, PCSP⁡(𝐘,𝐘′)PCSP𝐘superscript𝐘′\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime})) is the following computational problem: Given as input a σ𝜎\\sigma-structure 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}, output Yes if 𝐗→𝐘→𝐗𝐘\\mathbf{X}\\to\\mathbf{Y}, and No if 𝐗↛𝐘′↛𝐗superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{X}\\not\\to\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}.\nThe fact that 𝐘→𝐘′→𝐘superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{Y}\\to\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime} ensures that the answer sets are disjoint. Notice that PCSP⁡(𝐘,𝐘)PCSP𝐘𝐘\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}) is precisely CSP⁡(𝐘)CSP𝐘\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{Y}), so PCSPs are a generalisation of CSPs. This framework was formally introduced in  and [ref]14 to study approximability of perfectly satisfiable CSPs, but particular examples of PCSPs have been studied for a long time. For instance, given two natural numbers n≤n′𝑛superscript𝑛′n\\leq n^{\\prime}, PCSP⁡(𝐊n,𝐊n′)PCSPsubscript𝐊𝑛subscript𝐊superscript𝑛′\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{K}_{n},\\mathbf{K}_{n^{\\prime}}) is the famous approximate graph colouring problem, whose complexity is not known for general n𝑛n and n′superscript𝑛′n^{\\prime} — while the complexity of its non-promise version, graph n𝑛n-colouring, was already classified in . Unlike for CSPs, the complexity landscape of PCSPs is widely unknown. In particular, a dichotomy for PCSP complexity is not known to hold. Nevertheless, part of the machinery from the algebraic approach to CSPs does extend to the promise setting. Following , we let a polymorphism of arity ℓℓ\\ell for the pair (𝐘,𝐘′)𝐘superscript𝐘′(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}) be a homomorphism from 𝐘ℓsuperscript𝐘ℓ\\mathbf{Y}^{\\ell} to 𝐘′superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}. The set Pol⁡(𝐘,𝐘′)Pol𝐘superscript𝐘′\\operatorname{Pol}(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}) of all polymorphisms of (𝐘,𝐘′)𝐘superscript𝐘′(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}) is a subset of ℱY,Y′subscriptℱ𝑌superscript𝑌′\\mathscr{F}_{Y,Y^{\\prime}} (from Example 2) and it is closed under minors. Hence, just like Pol⁡(𝐘)Pol𝐘\\operatorname{Pol}(\\mathbf{Y}), Pol⁡(𝐘,𝐘′)Pol𝐘superscript𝐘′\\operatorname{Pol}(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}) is a (function) minion. The next result generalises Theorem 6, by showing that the quantum minion also captures quantum advantage for pairs of structures. Let 𝐘→𝐘′→𝐘superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{Y}\\to\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime} be relational structures. Then\n(𝐘,𝐘′)𝐘superscript𝐘′(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}) has quantum advantage over ℍℍ\\mathbb{H} if and only if 𝒬ℍ↛Pol⁡(𝐘,𝐘′)↛subscript𝒬ℍPol𝐘superscript𝐘′{\\mathscr{Q}}_{\\mathbb{H}}\\not\\to\\operatorname{Pol}(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}). Recall the notion of minion test used in Section 3. Given a minion ℳℳ{\\mathscr{M}}, we say that TestℳsubscriptTestℳ\\operatorname{Test}_{{\\mathscr{M}}} solves PCSP⁡(𝐘,𝐘′)PCSP𝐘superscript𝐘′\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}) if, for every structure 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} similar to 𝐘𝐘\\mathbf{Y} and 𝐘′superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}, Testℳ⁡(𝐗,𝐘)=YessubscriptTestℳ𝐗𝐘Yes\\operatorname{Test}_{{\\mathscr{M}}}(\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{Y})=\\textsc{Yes} implies 𝐗→𝐘′→𝐗superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{X}\\to\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}. Theorem 8 extends to PCSPs (in fact, the following is its original formulation in ). Let ℳℳ{\\mathscr{M}} be a minion and let 𝐘→𝐘′→𝐘superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{Y}\\to\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime} be relational structures. Then TestℳsubscriptTestℳ\\operatorname{Test}_{{\\mathscr{M}}} solves PCSP⁡(𝐘,𝐘′)PCSP𝐘superscript𝐘′\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}) if and only if ℳ→Pol⁡(𝐘,𝐘′)→ℳPol𝐘superscript𝐘′{\\mathscr{M}}\\to\\operatorname{Pol}(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}). The proof of Theorem 33 is then entirely analogous to that of Theorem 6. The pair (𝐘,𝐘′)𝐘superscript𝐘′(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}) has quantum advantage over ℍℍ\\mathbb{H} if and only if there exists some 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} such that Test𝒬ℍ⁡(𝐗,𝐘)=YessubscriptTestsubscript𝒬ℍ𝐗𝐘Yes\\operatorname{Test}_{{\\mathscr{Q}}_{\\mathbb{H}}}(\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{Y})=\\textsc{Yes} but 𝐗↛𝐘′↛𝐗superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{X}\\not\\to\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}; i.e., if and only if Test𝒬ℍsubscriptTestsubscript𝒬ℍ\\operatorname{Test}_{{\\mathscr{Q}}_{\\mathbb{H}}} does not solve PCSP⁡(𝐘,𝐘′)PCSP𝐘superscript𝐘′\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}). Hence, the conclusion follows from Theorem 34.\n∎ The following statement is then a direct consequence of Theorems 10, 24, and 33. Let 𝐘→𝐘′→𝐘superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{Y}\\to\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime} be relational structures. If dim(ℍ)≤2dimensionℍ2\\dim(\\mathbb{H})\\leq 2, (𝐘,𝐘′)𝐘superscript𝐘′(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}) has no quantum advantage over ℍℍ\\mathbb{H}. If dim(ℍ)≥3dimensionℍ3\\dim(\\mathbb{H})\\geq 3 and Pol⁡(𝐘,𝐘′)→𝒟→Pol𝐘superscript𝐘′𝒟\\operatorname{Pol}(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime})\\to{\\mathscr{D}}, (𝐘,𝐘′)𝐘superscript𝐘′(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}) has quantum advantage over ℍℍ\\mathbb{H}. If 𝒮→Pol⁡(𝐘,𝐘′)→𝒮Pol𝐘superscript𝐘′{\\mathscr{S}}\\to\\operatorname{Pol}(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}), (𝐘,𝐘′)𝐘superscript𝐘′(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}) has no quantum advantage over any ℍℍ\\mathbb{H}. How to link the result above to PCSP complexity?\nIt was shown in  that Theorem 4 keeps holding in the PCSP setting. I.e., a minion homomorphism Pol⁡(𝐘,𝐘′)→Pol⁡(𝐘~,𝐘~′)→Pol𝐘superscript𝐘′Pol~𝐘superscript~𝐘′\\operatorname{Pol}(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime})\\to\\operatorname{Pol}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{Y}},\\tilde{\\mathbf{Y}}^{\\prime}) induces a polynomial-time (log-space) reduction from PCSP⁡(𝐘~,𝐘~′)PCSP~𝐘superscript~𝐘′\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{Y}},\\tilde{\\mathbf{Y}}^{\\prime}) to PCSP⁡(𝐘,𝐘′)PCSP𝐘superscript𝐘′\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}). Nevertheless, some care needs to be taken when reformulating the conditions in parts (222) and (333) of Corollary 35 in terms of PCSP-complexity statements. Regarding part (222), in sharp contrast to the CSP setting,\nit is not true that the polymorphism minion of\nany NPNP{\\operatorname{NP}}-hard PCSP admits a homomorphism to 𝒟𝒟{\\mathscr{D}}, as detailed in . Therefore, unless P=NPPNP\\operatorname{P}={\\operatorname{NP}}, we cannot extend Corollary 17 to the PCSP setting. Given a graph 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}, let its quantum chromatic number be the quantity χq​(𝐗)=min⁡{n∈ℕ:𝐗→ℍ𝐊n}subscript𝜒q𝐗:𝑛ℕsubscript→ℍ𝐗subscript𝐊𝑛\\chi_{\\operatorname{q}}(\\mathbf{X})=\\min\\{n\\in\\mathbb{N}:\\mathbf{X}\\to_{\\mathbb{H}}\\mathbf{K}_{n}\\}. Then, for n≤n′∈ℕ𝑛superscript𝑛′ℕn\\leq n^{\\prime}\\in\\mathbb{N}, quantum advantage for the pair (𝐊n,𝐊n′)subscript𝐊𝑛subscript𝐊superscript𝑛′(\\mathbf{K}_{n},\\mathbf{K}_{n^{\\prime}}) corresponds to a separation between quantum and classical chromatic numbers. Indeed, (𝐊n,𝐊n′)subscript𝐊𝑛subscript𝐊superscript𝑛′(\\mathbf{K}_{n},\\mathbf{K}_{n^{\\prime}}) has quantum advantage over ℍℍ\\mathbb{H} precisely when there exists a graph having quantum chromatic number ≤nabsent𝑛\\leq n and classical chromatic number >n′absentsuperscript𝑛′>n^{\\prime}. It was shown in  (see also ) that, given integers 3≤n≤n′3𝑛superscript𝑛′3\\leq n\\leq n^{\\prime}, Pol⁡(𝐊n,𝐊n′)→𝒟→Polsubscript𝐊𝑛subscript𝐊superscript𝑛′𝒟\\operatorname{Pol}(\\mathbf{K}_{n},\\mathbf{K}_{n^{\\prime}})\\to{\\mathscr{D}} if and only if n′≤2​n−2superscript𝑛′2𝑛2n^{\\prime}\\leq 2n-2. Thus, if dim(ℍ)≥3dimensionℍ3\\dim(\\mathbb{H})\\geq 3 and n≥3𝑛3n\\geq 3, Corollary 35 implies that there exist graphs having quantum chromatic number at most n𝑛n and classical chromatic number at least 2​n−12𝑛12n-1. However, no larger separation can be derived through Corollary 35.202020We remark that this version of quantum chromatic number differs from the one introduced in  (which we denote by χ~qsubscript~𝜒q\\tilde{\\chi}_{\\operatorname{q}}), in that the latter makes use of projectors that are not necessarily commuting (cf. Remark 30). In particular, for any graph 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}, it holds that\nχ~q​(𝐗)≤χq​(𝐗)≤χ​(𝐗)subscript~𝜒q𝐗subscript𝜒q𝐗𝜒𝐗\\tilde{\\chi}_{\\operatorname{q}}(\\mathbf{X})\\leq\\chi_{\\operatorname{q}}(\\mathbf{X})\\leq\\chi(\\mathbf{X}), where χ𝜒\\chi is the classical chromatic number.\nAn exponential separation between χ~qsubscript~𝜒q\\tilde{\\chi}_{\\operatorname{q}} and χ𝜒\\chi is known, see   [ref]7. As for part (333) of Corollary 35, the condition 𝒮→Pol⁡(𝐘,𝐘′)→𝒮Pol𝐘superscript𝐘′{\\mathscr{S}}\\to\\operatorname{Pol}(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}) does capture PCSP solvability via SDP; also in this case, the following, more general formulation of Theorem 19 is the one given in  . Let 𝐘→𝐘′→𝐘superscript𝐘′\\mathbf{Y}\\to\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime} be relational structures.\nThen SDPSDP\\operatorname{SDP} solves PCSP⁡(𝐘,𝐘′)PCSP𝐘superscript𝐘′\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}) if and only if 𝒮→Pol⁡(𝐘,𝐘′)→𝒮Pol𝐘superscript𝐘′{\\mathscr{S}}\\to\\operatorname{Pol}(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}). As we see next, the result above allows finding a separation for the notions of quantum advantage for single structures and for pairs of structures. Let Z and Z′superscriptZ′\\textbf{Z}^{\\prime} be the relational structures encoding the CSPs “1-in-3 Sat” and “Not-All-Equal Sat”, respectively. I.e., Z and Z′superscriptZ′\\textbf{Z}^{\\prime} have Boolean domain and a unique, ternary relation It is well known  that both CSP⁡(Z)CSPZ\\operatorname{CSP}(\\textbf{Z}) and CSP⁡(Z′)CSPsuperscriptZ′\\operatorname{CSP}(\\textbf{Z}^{\\prime}) are NP-complete problems, and it is straightforward to check that Pol⁡(Z)→𝒟→PolZ𝒟\\operatorname{Pol}(\\textbf{Z})\\to{\\mathscr{D}} and Pol⁡(Z′)→𝒟→PolsuperscriptZ′𝒟\\operatorname{Pol}(\\textbf{Z}^{\\prime})\\to{\\mathscr{D}}. Hence, since we are assuming dim(ℍ)≥3dimensionℍ3\\dim(\\mathbb{H})\\geq 3, both Z and Z′superscriptZ′\\textbf{Z}^{\\prime} have quantum advantage over ℍℍ\\mathbb{H}. On the other hand, it was shown in  that PCSP⁡(Z,Z′)PCSPZsuperscriptZ′\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\textbf{Z},\\textbf{Z}^{\\prime}) is solved by SDPSDP\\operatorname{SDP}. It follows from Theorem 37 that 𝒮→Pol⁡(Z,Z′)→𝒮PolZsuperscriptZ′{\\mathscr{S}}\\to\\operatorname{Pol}(\\textbf{Z},\\textbf{Z}^{\\prime}). Hence, Corollary 35 implies that the pair (Z,Z′)ZsuperscriptZ′(\\textbf{Z},\\textbf{Z}^{\\prime}) has no quantum advantage over ℍℍ\\mathbb{H}.\n∎ The fact that the pair (Z,Z′)ZsuperscriptZ′(\\textbf{Z},\\textbf{Z}^{\\prime}) from the proof of Theorem 32 has no quantum advantage over any ℍℍ\\mathbb{H} can also be obtained by using the minion 𝒞𝒞{\\mathscr{C}} from Remark 26 instead of 𝒮𝒮{\\mathscr{S}}.\nIndeed, also in this case, 𝒞𝒞{\\mathscr{C}} captures solvability by the CLP relaxation in the more general setting of PCSPs: It was proved in  that CLP solves PCSP⁡(𝐘,𝐘′)PCSP𝐘superscript𝐘′\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}) if and only if 𝒞→Pol⁡(𝐘,𝐘′)→𝒞Pol𝐘superscript𝐘′{\\mathscr{C}}\\to\\operatorname{Pol}(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y}^{\\prime}). Since, as shown in Remark 26, 𝒬ℍ→𝒞→subscript𝒬ℍ𝒞{\\mathscr{Q}}_{\\mathbb{H}}\\to{\\mathscr{C}} for each ℍℍ\\mathbb{H}, part (3)3(3) of Corollary 35 also holds if we replace 𝒮𝒮{\\mathscr{S}} by 𝒞𝒞{\\mathscr{C}}. It was shown in [ref]14 that PCSP⁡(Z,Z′)PCSPZsuperscriptZ′\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\textbf{Z},\\textbf{Z}^{\\prime}) is solved by CLP; thus, 𝒞→Pol⁡(Z,Z′)→𝒞PolZsuperscriptZ′{\\mathscr{C}}\\to\\operatorname{Pol}(\\textbf{Z},\\textbf{Z}^{\\prime}), which means that (Z,Z′)ZsuperscriptZ′(\\textbf{Z},\\textbf{Z}^{\\prime}) has no quantum advantage over any ℍℍ\\mathbb{H}. We also point out that, while a notion of width for PCSPs is known  [ref]3,\nneither of the minions 𝒮𝒮{\\mathscr{S}} and 𝒞𝒞{\\mathscr{C}} corresponds to bounded width for PCSPs. Indeed, as we have seen, Pol⁡(Z,Z′)PolZsuperscriptZ′\\operatorname{Pol}(\\textbf{Z},\\textbf{Z}^{\\prime}) admits a homomorphism from both 𝒮𝒮{\\mathscr{S}} and 𝒞𝒞{\\mathscr{C}} but, as shown in [ref]3, PCSP⁡(Z,Z′)PCSPZsuperscriptZ′\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\textbf{Z},\\textbf{Z}^{\\prime}) has unbounded width.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: is precisely CSP⁡(𝐘)CSP𝐘\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{Y}), so PCSPs are a generalisation of CSPs.
