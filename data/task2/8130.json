Here, the best approximation ratios are guaranteed by “VCG-Based” (also called “Maximal-in-Range”) mechanisms    , which are a factor of Θ~​(m)~Θ𝑚\\widetilde{\\Theta}(\\sqrt{m}) worse than those of the best non-truthful protocols     for the canonical settings of Submodular, XOS, Subadditive, and Monotone. It is plausibly conjectured that the aforementioned VCG-based mechanisms are optimal among deterministic truthful mechanisms, which would imply that strong separations between truthful and non-truthful protocols exist. The lone prior separation is .\nThis separation relies on a result of 5 which reduces the problem to showing impossibilities for two-bidder simultaneous protocols; this reduction does not extend beyond two bidders.888\n 7 also prove lower bounds for simultaneous combinatorial auctions. However, their results hold only for a large number of bidders.\n\nIn contribution to this line of works, we provide the first separation for >2absent2>2 bidders and directly via the Taxation Complexity framework 5 in a manner that is not restricted to a particular number of bidders.\nFinally, we also note that the particular notion of truthfulness we consider is the standard “Ex-Post Nash,” meaning that it is always a Nash equilibrium for Bidders to follow the protocol, no matter their valuations. A stronger notion of truthfulness asks that it is a “Dominant Strategy” to follow the protocol, and  7 establish separations between the achievable guarantees of poly⁡(m)poly𝑚\\operatorname{poly}(m)-communication Dominant Strategy Truthful mechanisms and non-truthful protocols.999\nThe distinction between Ex-Post Nash and Dominant-Strategy Truthful is that the former need only incentivize each bidder to behave truthfully when the other bidders are truthful according to some, but possibly arbitrary, valuation, whereas the latter faces the much stiffer task of incentivizing each bidder to be truthful even when other bidders are behaving in a bizarre manner inconsistent with any valuation function.\n There is also a significant line of work developing randomized truthful combinatorial auctions. Here, the state-of-the-art approximation guarantees are much better, poly⁡(1/log⁡log⁡m)poly1𝑚\\operatorname{poly}(1/\\log\\log m) for Submodular, XOS, and Subadditive  (building upon [ref]3 4 2 ), and Θ​(m)Θ𝑚\\Theta(\\sqrt{m}) for arbitrary monotone valuations 1. The latter is asymptotically tight, whereas it remains a major open problem whether the former can be improved to a constant. A significant body of work also considers the computational complexity of truthful Combinatorial Auctions. This line of research indeed concludes strong separations between the constant-factor approximations achievable by poly-time algorithms    and poly-time truthful mechanisms  for Submodular valuations 3 1 0 3 9. These results establish an Ω~​(m)~Ω𝑚\\widetilde{\\Omega}(\\sqrt{m}) lower bound on the approximation guarantees of randomized poly-time truthful mechanisms. The simple posted-price mechanisms of the prior paragraph ‘break’ these bounds because they use demand queries, and  identifies a relaxed notion of “truthfulness” under which these mechanisms achieve their guarantees in poly-time. This counterintuitive interaction between computation and incentives further motivates the communication model for combinatorial auctions.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: auctions.
