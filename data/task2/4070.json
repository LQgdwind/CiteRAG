      "content": "Paper Title: UTTS: Unsupervised TTS with Conditional Disentangled Sequential Variational Auto-encoder\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDisentangling speaker information from speech content is of great importance to speech tasks such as speaker recognition, automatic speech recognition, voice conversion and text-to-speech [ref]25    . Of the existed speech disentanglement methods, DSVAE  is a compelling framework that generates the disentangled speaker and content representation in an unsupervised manner. A recent DSVAE study in speech  presents impressive speaker verification and voice conversion performance by balancing the information flow between speaker and content. As the content prior being assumed independent of the input data, early versions of DSVAE suffer from discontinuous and unstable speech generation with damaged phonetic structures  [ref]31 [ref]32 . More recently, C-DSVAE  was proposed to introduce the content-dependent acoustic alignment as a condition to regularize the DSVAE training, from which the phonetically discriminative content representations are learned and the stabilized vocalization is achieved, overcoming the architecture drawback of earlier explorations in DSVAE  [ref]31 [ref]32 and delivering enhanced zero-shot VC performances. In the following sections, we first present a systematic overview of the DSVAE framework, which serves as the backbone of the improved C-DSVAE. Then, we presents detailed development methods of C-DSVAE by deliberating different types of content conditions as well as training objectives. Furthermore, we extend C-DSVAE by introducing the masked prediction training to capture the robust and long-range temporal relations over acoustic units. In the last two sections, we discuss how the voice conversion and alignment-driven voice generation are performed within the C-DSVAE framework, the latter exploration serves as the cornerstone of our UTTS system to be discussed in Sec. IV. The detailed model architectures can be found in Sec. V-B1.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: Disentangling speaker information from speech content is of great importance to speech tasks such as speaker recognition, automatic speech recognition, voice conversion and text-to-speech [ref]25    .
