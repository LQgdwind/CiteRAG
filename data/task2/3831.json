Prior works in multimedia forensics propose several methods to identify GAN-generated images from natural ones. It is worth mentioning that the most current methods are based on Convolutional Neural Networks, and achieve good detection accuracy. For instance, the approach developed in  compute from three color image bands the co-occurrence matrices and fed them to the CNN model. Another approach proposed in  demonstrated that although Generative adversarial networks can produce high quality images with likely invisible traces, it is challenging to reconstruct a consistent relationship among the color bands. As an extension of the method proposed in , the authors improved the detection of images generated through GANs, and thus by considering as input the cross-band co-occurrences and the gray-level co-occurrences to the CNN detector. These co-occurrences are separately computed on the single bands.\nConsequently, the proposed CNN detector achieves a good detection accuracy, and robustness for the intra-band method against post-processing. However, these approaches applied for GAN content detection are not robust against different attacks and post-processing  . Additional research efforts have been considered to investigate the privacy leakage of virtual backgrounds in videoconferencing software [ref]25. The authors demonstrated the possibility of partial reconstruction of the visual environment despite of the virtual background. They evaluated their adversarial attack against several videoconferencing software (e.g., Zoom, Webex, and Google Meet), and the possibility of identifying objects in the user’s virtual background. Another work conducted investigated the privacy issues of the virtual background in videoconferencing platforms . However, these works cannot perfectly identify a real from a virtual background under adversarial attacks [ref]25 .\n In this line of research, we observe that if the videos are captured with a high-quality camera such as MacBook-Pro and the subject moves slowly, we do not have tiny leakage in the real background parts. Consequently, the work proposed in [ref]25 is not efficient in this case. Moreover, the reconstruction of the real background will be a challenging task. On the other hand, and differently from the underlining approach, we are interested in the security of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in [ref]25, where the adversary can fool the detector easily through different kinds of attacks. Additionally, we noticed similar privacy concerns about the virtual background, where the users could conceal their location with the virtual background and cheat other participants in the meeting, such as considering the real background as a virtual one, or different lighting conditions.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Detecting the authenticity of a virtual background whether it’s real or fake can be referred to detecting a given image if it is GAN-generated or not [ref]26 .
