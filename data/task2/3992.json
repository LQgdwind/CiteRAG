      "content": "Paper Title: Glance to Count: Learning to Rank with Anchors for Weakly-supervised Crowd Counting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs an important research topic in computer vision, crowd counting that aims to automatically count the number of individuals in images has been widely applied in many areas, e.g., video surveillance, traffic estimation, and congestion control.\nMost recent approaches , , [ref]3,  rely mainly on fully-supervised annotation for individuals in crowd (i.e., placing a dot at the center of each individual) to estimate crowd density. Yet, such annotation process is extremely time-consuming and laborious. Especially for extremely dense scenarios, it is almost senseless to manually label over-heaped dots just for the purpose of representing crowd density in a scene. Such a tedious annotation process hinders the scale and diversity of crowd datasets and thus slows down the development of this area. Recent work¬† revisits the regression-based counting method that ignores the exact individual locations and directly maps a crowd image to its crowd counts. However, the problem of annotation remain unsolved, as ground-truth crowd counts are required for training, which thus cannot prevent annotators from strenuously pinpointing each individual in the images.\nBesides, some approaches¬†,  aim to bypass dense annotations with alternative interactions. Considering each annotated object in an image is atomic and equivalent, they require a few individual annotations instead of accurate locations of all objects. These methods are promising to relieve the annotation efforts while still achieving good performance, but they do not radically solve the problem. To address the above concern, we rethink the way of governing crowd counting models.\nIntuitively, directly estimating the crowd count in an image is a challenging task even for a human expert.\nBut it is much easier to sense the relative density for a few crowd images with great contrast in population sizes. For example, for the three crowd images in Fig.¬†1, we can easily tell which one has the largest scale crowd.\nThus, this observation sheds light on a novel methodology of supervising the crowd counting models using ranking labels for any pair of crowd images, where each ranking label indicates which one of the image pair contains more persons. Comparing to the existing annotation process, annotating ranking labels for images with large contrast in crowd sizes is an almost effortless task for human annotators, so establishing larger and more diverse crowd datasets becomes possible, which will be of great value to the community.\nTo this end, it boils down to the problem on how to effectively leverage the ranking labeled image pairs to supervise crowd counting models in such a weakly-supervised manner. To exploit the ranking labels of crowd images, we propose a novel Siamese Ranking Network (SRN). Specifically, instead of directly estimating the crowd size of each image, a pair of crowd images are fed into two separate yet weight-sharing deep networks to predict their potentials that indicate the ordering of the counts in crowd images. For instance, in Fig.¬†1, the potential of ùíûùíû\\mathcal{C} should be higher than those of ùíúùíú\\mathcal{A} and ‚Ñ¨‚Ñ¨\\mathcal{B}. During the training phase, the magnitude relationship between a pair of predicted potentials can be supervised by the corresponding ranking labels of the crowd image pair. To this end, the purpose of model optimization is to assign appropriate potentials for all crowd images, which makes their orderings of potentials consistent with the ranking labels. Thus, the predicted potentials will be innately and positively correlated with the number of objects in crowd images, so they can be further applied to regress the absolute crowd counts. We construct a large amount of ranking labels corresponded to pairs of crowd images as the training set for training our proposed Siamese network. However, the learned Siamese network can only produce potential scores as no crowd count labels are involved in training. To combat this problem, in the inference stage, we leverage a few images with crowd count labels as the reference, denoted as counting anchor set, to disentangle the relationship between potential scores and actual crowd counts. Thanks to the positive correlation between the potentials and the ground-truth crowd counts, we establish a linear mapping function to fit the potential and counts of anchors, and we apply it to estimate the crowd count of the query image.\nOur proposed annotation scheme is far more facile than the standard point-based annotation, especially in challenging crowd scenes, but we achieve comparable performances to those trained with a stronger supervision. Extensive experiments study various combinations of supervision in training, and we show that our model is superior to state-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods, even better than those trained with point-based labels. Our contributions are three-fold: We introduce a novel weakly-supervised crowd counting setting, which can reduce labeling cost largely and be notably beneficial to dense and congested crowds. We propose a simple but effective Siamese-training method and utilize the anchoring mechanism to estimate crowd counts and we verify its effectiveness in this task. Extensive experiments conducted on several challenging benchmarks study various combinations of supervision. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods without any extra labeling effort.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: to automatically count the number of individuals in images has been widely applied in many areas, e.g., video surveillance, traffic estimation, and congestion control.\nMost recent approaches , , [ref]3,  rely mainly on fully-supervised annotation for individuals in crowd (i.e., placing a dot at the center of each individual) to estimate crowd density.
