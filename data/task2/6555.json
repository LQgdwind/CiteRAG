      "content": "Paper Title: TransformerG2G: Adaptive time-stepping for learning temporal graph embeddings using transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNumerous real-world datasets, such as social networks, financial networks, biological protein networks, brain networks, citation networks, disease spreading networks, and transportation networks, naturally exhibit complex “graph-like” structures [ref]1 . A graph typically consists of a set of nodes that represent entities and a set of edges that depict relationships between nodes. In the past few years, graph representation learning has gained significant attention for its crucial role in effectively analyzing complex, high-dimensional graph-structured data across various application domains, e.g., drug discovery in healthcare  , protein structure and property prediction  , brain network analysis [ref]7 , traffic forecasting  [ref]10 , partial differential equation learning  . Moreover, graph embedding techniques have gained a lot of success due to the capability to learn highly informative latent graph representations projected in a lower-dimensional space from high-dimensional graphs, while the important and intricate graph topological properties  can be maximally preserved in the latent embedding space. The lower-dimensional graph embeddings can be readily and efficiently applied for a broad range of downstream graph analytic tasks, such as link prediction, node classification, anomaly detection, recommender systems, and graph completion. However, in practice graphs usually change over time, which can be observed by newly added or removed nodes (or edges), changing node (or edge) labels or features with heterogeneous dynamic behavior. Hence, it is more challenging to learn temporal graph embedding compared to most of the existing works on static graph embeddings  . In this work, we first present the multi-step DynG2G  algorithm, a simple modification to the original DynG2G that helps to incorporate temporal information while learning the embeddings. Then, we propose TransformerG2G, a deep learning model with the transformer architecture at its core, which includes the history of a node while projecting it into the embedding space. We represent embeddings as multivariate Gaussian distributions, where we learn the mean and variance associated with each node. This methodology helps to quantify the uncertainty associated with the embeddings, which is typically neglected in other existing models that consider temporal history. In section 2 we present a review of the related works on learning graph embeddings in dynamic graphs. In section 3, we define dynamic graphs. Followed by a concise overview of the original DynG2G model, and discussions on the multi-step method and the TransformerG2G model. In section 4, we discuss the six benchmark datasets used in this study and their implementation details. We then present the results of the multi-step DynG2G model and TransformerG2G model, and focus on the time-dependent attention matrices. In section 5, we present the summary of the work, limitations, and directions for future developments.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: financial networks, biological protein networks, brain networks, citation networks, disease spreading networks, and transportation networks, naturally exhibit complex “graph-like” structures [ref]1 .
