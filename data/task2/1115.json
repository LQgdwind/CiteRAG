      "content": "Paper Title: Less is More: Data-Efficient Complex Question Answering over Knowledge Bases\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge base question answering (KBQA)¬†  [ref]3   is an active research area that has attracted significant attention.\nKBQA aims at interpreting natural-language questions as logical forms, action sequences, or programs, which could be directly executed on a knowledge base (KB) to yield the answers. Many techniques have been proposed for answering single-hop or multi-hop questions over a knowledge base.\nNeural network-based methods¬†  [ref]3   represent the state-of-the-art in KBQA.\nMore recently, complex knowledge base question answering (CQA)¬† has been proposed as a more challenging task.\nComplex question answering, the subject of this paper, focuses on aggregation and multi-hop questions, in which a sequence of discrete operations ‚Äì e.g., set conjunction, counting, comparison, intersection, and union ‚Äì needs to be executed to derive the answer. Complex question answering is typically cast as a semantic parsing problem, whereby natural-language questions are transformed into appropriate structural queries (sequences of discrete actions).\nSuch queries are then executed on the knowledge base to compute the answer.\nConsider the complex question ‚ÄúHow many rivers flow through India and China?‚Äù as a motivating example.\nFig.¬†1 shows an incomplete sub-graph relevant to this question.\nTo answer this question, all entities whose type is ‚Äúriver‚Äù and link to the entity ‚ÄúChina‚Äù with edge ‚Äúflow‚Äù will first need to be retrieved from the KB to form the candidate set SAsubscriptùëÜùê¥S_{A}.\nMeanwhile, the candidate set SBsubscriptùëÜùêµS_{B} will also be formed to represent those rivers that flow through India.\nAfter obtaining the intersection of SAsubscriptùëÜùê¥S_{A} and SBsubscriptùëÜùêµS_{B}, the number of elements in the intersection can finally be identified as the correct answer to the question.\nIt can be seen that a diverse set of operations, including selection, intersection, and counting operations need to be sequentially predicted and executed on the KB. Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models learn to map natural language utterances to executable programs, and are thus good model choices for the complex question answering task.\nHowever, under the supervised training setup, such models require substantial amounts of annotations, i.e., manually annotated programs, to effectively train.\nFor practical KBQA applications, gold annotated programs are expensive to obtain, thus most of the complex questions are not paired with the annotations¬†[ref]7.\nReinforcement learning (RL) is an effective method for training KBQA models¬† [ref]9 as it does not require annotations, but only denotatinons (i.e.¬†answers) as weak supervision signals.\nHowever, RL-based KBQA methods face a number of significant challenges. Sparse reward. Neural-symbolic models that are optimized through RL have been proposed for the complex question answering task¬† [ref]7 [ref]9.\nIn the RL context, questions of the same pattern could be regarded as one single task, while programs trying to solve these similar questions are considered trials.\nInstead of using the gold annotations, neural-symbolic models employ rewards, i.e., comparisons between the predicted answer and the ground-truth answer as the distant supervision signal to train the policy¬† [ref]9.\nUsually, a positive reward could only be given at the end of a long sequence of correct actions.\nHowever, in the initial stage of model training, most of the trials sampled from the sub-optimal policy attain small or zero rewards¬†0.\nWe randomly selected 100 questions from a complex question answering dataset, and manually inspect the generated trials.\nWe found that more than 96.5% of the generated trials led to wrong answers and got zero reward.\nThus, this sparse reward problem in the complex question answering task is a major challenge that current neural-symbolic models face. Complex Imperative Program Induction from Terminal Rewards (CIPITR)¬†[ref]7 is the state-of-the-art method for the complex question answering task.\nIt employs high-level constraints and additional auxiliary rewards to alleviate the sparse reward problem.\nBy using pre-defined high-level constraints, CIPITR restricts the model to search for possible actions that are semantically correct.\nBesides, it rewards the model by the additional feedback when the generated answers have the same type of ground-truth answers.\nHowever, on the one hand, defining the high-level constraints comes at the cost of manual analysis to guide the model‚Äôs decoding process, which is tedious and expensive.\nOn the other hand, CIPITR only harnesses the type of predicted answers as the auxiliary reward, which makes many failed experience still only have a zero reward.\nAt the initial stage of training, most of the programs generated by CIPITR fail to yield expected answers and gain zero rewards, thus most of the programs do not contribute to model optimization.\nThus, the sparse reward problem remains a challenge for CIPITR. Data inefficiency. Furthermore, due to the sparse supervision signals, such models are often data inefficient, which means many trials are required to solve a particular task¬†1.\nBeing trained from scratch, RL models often need thousands of trials to learn a simple task, no matter what policy is employed to search programs.\nWhen faced with a large number of questions, training such models would consume an enormous amount of time.\nOne way to increase data efficiency is to acquire task-related prior knowledge to constrain the search space.\nHowever, in most cases, such prior knowledge is unavailable unless manual labeling is employed.\nHence, the data inefficiency problem often makes models expensive to train and thus infeasible/impractical.\nLiang et al¬† proposed the Neural Symbolic Machine (NSM) that maintains and replays one pseudo-gold trial that yields the highest reward for each training sample.\nWhen using RL to optimize the policy, NSM assigns a deterministic probability to the best trial found so far to improve the training data efficiency.\nHowever, in NSM, the best trial to be replayed might be a spurious program, i.e., an incorrect program that happens to output the correct answer.\nUnder such circumstances, NSM would be misguided by the spurious programs since such programs could not be generalized to other questions of the same pattern.\nBesides, NSM only harnesses the accuracy of the predicted answers to measure the reward, hence also suffers from the sparse reward problem. Large search space. Large KBs, like Wikidata¬†2 or Freebase¬†3, contain comprehensive knowledge and are suitable to be sources for complex question answering.\nThe KBs with smaller size usually embrace a limited number of facts, thus are insufficient to yield the required answers.\nTo answer the questions, searching for KB artifacts (entities, classes, and predicates in KB) that are related to the questions is a crucial step.\nHowever, large KBs often lead to vast search space.\nGiven a sequence of actions, at each step of its execution, both the operator and the parameters, i.e., KB artifact, used in action need to be correct.\nTo produce the correct result, the actions in the sequence also need to follow a particular order.\nWith the above factors combined, searching desired action sequences would consume a considerable amount of time and memory, which makes the training process slow and expensive.\nHow to design a set of simple yet effective actions that could reduce the search space remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a Neural-Symbolic Complex Question Answering framework, NS-CQA.\nIt trains a policy to generate the desired programs from the comparison between the generated answer and the ground-truth result.\nWe incorporate a memory buffer, design an adaptive reward function, and propose a curriculum-guided reward bonus to improve the model. To reduce search space, we use a combination of simple yet effective techniques to reduce model complexity, increase generalizability, and expedite training convergence.\nWe employ the widely-used masking technique to allow the model to handle unseen KB artifacts effectively.\nIn conjunction, the copy mechanism¬†4 is also employed to reduce the size of the decoder output vocabulary drastically.\nAccordingly, the decoder output vocabulary only needs to contain the primitive actions and a handful of masks, instead of the entire KB.\nAlso, we carefully craft a set of primitive actions that are necessary for the complex question answering task and simplify the query form to reduce the search space.\nOur primitive actions free the model from the need for maintaining expensive and sophisticated memory modules.\nOn the contrary, the model maintains the intermediate results in a simple key-value dictionary.\nThe model can directly compute the final answer to a question by executing a correct sequence of primitive actions.\n Different from previous neural-symbolic models for the complex question answering task, our NS-CQA framework is designed to augment the sparse extrinsic reward by a dense intrinsic reward and exploit trials efficiently. Instead of using the manually defined high-level constraints as in CIPITR, we employ a random search algorithm to find a few pseudo-gold annotations that lead to correct answers.\nThe pseudo-gold annotations are used as supervision signals to pre-train the model, which could guide the model to filter out infeasible action sequences.\nConsequently, in the initial training stage, we mitigate the cold start issue by using the pseudo-gold annotations as demonstration data to pre-train our model. Moreover, instead of recording one trial for each question, we maintain a memory buffer to store the promising trials, i.e., the action sequences that lead to the correct answer or gain high rewards.\nIn our work, on the one hand, we aim to converge a behavior policy to a target optimal policy.\nThus we need to measure how similar/important the generated trials are to trials that the target policy may have made.\nWe design a reward bonus, proximity, to favor these ‚Äúsimilar/important‚Äù trials.\nOn the other hand, to avoid overfitting the spurious trials, we also encourage the policy to explore in undiscovered search space, i.e., the space that is beyond the imitation of the pseudo-gold annotations.\nTherefore, we design another reward bonus, novelty, to the generated action sequences that are ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù from the trials stored in the memory buffer. To adaptively control the exploration-exploitation trade-off, we employ a curriculum learning¬†5 scheme to dynamically change the influence of the two reward bonuses, namely the proximity and the novelty.\nParticularly, given a question, we define the proximity for the predicted trial as the highest similarity between the predicted trial and all the trials in the memory buffer.\nNovelty is also defined through similarity.\nWe consider a trial is novel if it is not similar to all the trials in the memory buffer.\nAt the initial stage, since the policy is sub-optimal and the trials generated by the policy are generally infeasible, we prefer more novelty for exploration.\nWe gradually increase the proportion of proximity and reduce the influence of novelty during the later training epochs.\nAt the final stage of the training, the proportion of proximity in the reward bonus will rise to 100%.\nSuch a delicately designed curriculum method can significantly improve the learning quality and efficiency¬†6. Besides, to alleviate the sparse reward problem, an adaptive reward function (ARF) is proposed.\nARF encourages the model with partial reward and adapts the reward computing to different question types.\nWe sum up the reward bonus with the adaptive reward to make our RL model learn from the combined reward.\nWith this modification, we reshape the sparse rewards into dense rewards and enable any failed experience to have a nonnegative reward, thus alleviate the sparse reward problem. Furthermore, by incorporating a memory buffer, which maintains off-policy samples, into the policy gradient framework, we improve the sample efficiency of the REINFORCE algorithm in our work¬†1.\nWe encourage the model to generate trials that are similar to the trials in the memory buffer by using the proximity bonus.\nTherefore the high-reward trials could be re-sampled frequently to avoid being forgotten in the training process.\nSince a group of question shares the same pattern, a sequence of the same actions could solve such questions.\nOnce we improve sample efficiency, we reduce the trials needed for training.\nTherefore, using a minimal subset of training samples, our model can produce competitive results. Overall, the main contributions in this paper can be summarized as follows. A neural-symbolic approach that is augmented by memory buffer and is designed for complex question answering. In our method, for each question, we resort to the previous promising trials stored in the memory to assist our model in replaying and generating feasible action sequences. A curriculum-learning scheme that adaptively combines novelty and proximity to balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off for the model. We treat the combination of the novelty and proximity as a bonus to the reward, therefore alleviate the sparse reward and data inefficiency problems. Several simple yet effective techniques are proposed to reduce search space, improve model generalizability, and accelerate convergence.\nIn our work, the masking method and the copy mechanism are incorporated in Seq2Seq learning to avoid searching over a large action space.\nAlso, a set of primitive actions is carefully designed to solve complex questions by executing actions sequentially, avoiding the maintenance of complex memory modules.\n Our experiments on a large complex question answering dataset¬† and a relatively smaller multi-hop dataset WebQuestionsSP¬†7 show that NS-CQA outperforms all the recent, state-of-the-art models.\nMoreover, NS-CQA performs well on the questions with higher complexity, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.\nRelated works are introduced in Section¬†2.\nOur NS-CQA framework is described in Section¬†3.\nSection¬†4 describes the experiments and evaluation results.\nIn Section¬†5, we perform some qualitative analysis, showing positive examples and typical errors.\nWe conclude our work in Section¬†6.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Knowledge base question answering (KBQA)¬†  [ref]3   is an active research area that has attracted significant attention.\nKBQA aims at interpreting natural-language questions as logical forms, action sequences, or programs, which could be\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
