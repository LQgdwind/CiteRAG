      "content": "Paper Title: Rethinking Classifier Re-Training in Long-Tailed Recognition: A Simple Logits Retargeting Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCompared Methods.\nWe selected the popular methods in LTR and split them into two categories. (i) Baseline models: Some of these models modify the loss directly, such as cross entropy (CE) loss, class balanced CE loss (CB-CE)¬†[ref]9 or focal loss¬†[ref]20. RBL¬†[ref]26 focuses on the perspective of feature learning.\nDe-confound¬†, LogitAjust¬†, BALMS¬†, AREA¬† correct the classifier from different analysis aspects.\nBBN¬†, LDAM-DRW¬† leverage a learning rate annealing strategy to balance the feature learning process and the re-weighting procedure. The more straightforward method is decoupled learning¬†, consisting of cRT¬†, œÑùúè\\tau-norm¬†, DisAlign¬†2 and LTWB¬†.\nAmong them, LTWB is the most competitive model, whose main contribution is to use simple regularization to learn better robust features in the first stage. EWB-FDR¬†1 delved into the success of LTWB by exploring Fisher‚Äôs Discriminant Ratio in depth and streamlining the process, albeit at the expense of reduced performance.\n(ii) Upper Bound models: These models tend to make complex design or need more computational resources.\nThey include self-supervised pretraining method PaCo¬†, BCL¬†8, additional augmentation training data method OPeN¬†1, multi-experts ensemble method RIDE¬†, transfer learning method SSD¬†9. We utilize the results reported in these original works. Results and Analysis. Tab.¬†2 presents the results for long-tailed dataset recognition across three benchmarks. Our method LORT achieves state-of-the-art performance on all the benchmarks. Compared to the origin SOTA model LTWB¬† on CIFAR100-LT, LORT achieves an improvement of 1%‚àº1.5%similar-topercent1percent1.51\\%\\sim 1.5\\% in CIFAR100-LT dataset, 0.5%percent0.50.5\\% in ImageNet-LT and 0.6%percent0.60.6\\% in iNaturalist2018. In the long-tail tasks without bells and whistles, the improvement is significant.\nOn ImageNet-LT, LORT achieves a significant improvement in classification accuracy for minority classes compared to previous methods, including upper bound models. However, it should be noted that the upper bound models still achieve better overall accuracy on ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist2018 datasets. We attribute this phenomenon to a general feature learning gap in challenging datasets. On CIFAR100-LT, even naive models can perfectly overfit to the imbalanced training set and the core objective is to make the feature general and robust, and finetune the classifier more adaptable to balanced dataset. Hence, LORT can significantly outperform other methods. For large datasets, there is still substantial room for improvement in the representation aspect of the backbone network.\nTherefore, advanced methods have a significant advantage in this regard.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: the popular methods in LTR and split them into two categories.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
