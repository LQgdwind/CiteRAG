      "content": "Paper Title: On Identity Testing and Noncommutative Rank Computation over the Free Skew Field\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs the key component, the proof uses a composition lemma that computes an efficient linear pencil for f​(x¯,g1−1,…,gm−1)𝑓¯𝑥superscriptsubscript𝑔11…superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑚1f(\\underaccent{\\bar}{x},g_{1}^{-1},\\ldots,g_{m}^{-1}) from the linear pencils of f​(x¯,y¯)𝑓¯𝑥¯𝑦f(\\underaccent{\\bar}{x},\\underaccent{\\bar}{y}) and g1−1,…,gm−1superscriptsubscript𝑔11…superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑚1g_{1}^{-1},\\ldots,g_{m}^{-1}. It turns out that the proof of this composition result is more subtle than the usual proofs of the linear pencil constructions for rational formulas  . We first elaborate on the composition lemma.\nLet L𝐿L be an s×s𝑠𝑠s\\times s linear pencil over x1,…,xnsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n} and\ny1,…,ymsubscript𝑦1…subscript𝑦𝑚y_{1},\\ldots,y_{m}. Let fi,j=(L−1)i,jsubscript𝑓𝑖𝑗subscriptsuperscript𝐿1𝑖𝑗f_{i,j}=(L^{-1})_{i,j} for i,j∈[s]𝑖𝑗delimited-[]𝑠i,j\\in[s]. Let g1,…,gmsubscript𝑔1…subscript𝑔𝑚g_{1},\\ldots,g_{m} be rational\nfunctions over x1,…,xnsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n} such that each gksubscript𝑔𝑘g_{k} has a linear pencil Lksubscript𝐿𝑘L_{k} of size at most\ns′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime}. Then we can construct a single linear pencil L~~𝐿\\widetilde{L} of\nsize at most m​s′+m+2​s2+s𝑚superscript𝑠′𝑚2superscript𝑠2𝑠ms^{\\prime}+m+2s^{2}+s in poly⁡(s′,s,m,n)polysuperscript𝑠′𝑠𝑚𝑛\\operatorname{poly}(s^{\\prime},s,m,n)-time such that Given a rational function 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r} computed by an inversely disjoint rational r-skewed circuit of size at most s𝑠s, we consider the rational function 𝔯−1superscript𝔯1\\mathfrak{r}^{-1} which is still in the same class (with inversion height increased by one). Using the composition result, we construct a linear pencil of size O​(s2)𝑂superscript𝑠2O(s^{2}) for 𝔯−1superscript𝔯1\\mathfrak{r}^{-1}. Notice that 𝔯​(x¯,y¯)𝔯¯𝑥¯𝑦\\mathfrak{r}(\\underaccent{\\bar}{x},\\underaccent{\\bar}{y}) is a polynomial computed by an ABP or a r-skewed circuit and it has a polynomial-size linear pencil . Using a standard idea, 𝔯−1superscript𝔯1\\mathfrak{r}^{-1} also has a small linear pencil L𝐿L which we use as the input to the composition lemma along with the inductively constructed linear pencils for g1,…,gmsubscript𝑔1…subscript𝑔𝑚g_{1},\\ldots,g_{m}. The final linear pencil L~~𝐿\\widetilde{L} which is the outcome of the composition lemma has the additional property that for any matrix tuple 𝔯​(p¯)𝔯¯𝑝\\mathfrak{r}(\\underaccent{\\bar}{p}), 𝔯−1​(p¯)superscript𝔯1¯𝑝\\mathfrak{r}^{-1}(\\underaccent{\\bar}{p}) is defined if and only if L~​(p¯)~𝐿¯𝑝\\widetilde{L}(\\underaccent{\\bar}{p}) is invertible. Since 𝔯≠0𝔯0\\mathfrak{r}\\neq 0 if and only if 𝔯−1superscript𝔯1\\mathfrak{r}^{-1} is defined [ref]1, we can now use the algorithm for noncommutative Singular problem  on the linear pencil L~~𝐿\\widetilde{L} to check the identity of 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r}.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: is defined if and only if L~​(p¯)~𝐿¯𝑝\\widetilde{L}(\\underaccent{\\bar}{p}) is invertible.
