      "content": "Paper Title: Spatiotemporal Self-attention Modeling with Temporal Patch Shift for Action Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAction recognition is a challenging and cornerstone problem in vision. Many deep learning based methods have been proposed recently [ref]37    [ref]37        3    [ref]31 . Based on the employed network architecture, they can be categorized into CNN-based ones and transformer-based ones. CNN-based methods. CNN based methods typically use 3D convolution [ref]37  3 or 2D-CNN with temporal modeling  [ref]31  to construct effective backbones for action recognition. For example, C3D [ref]37 trains a VGG model with 3D-CNN to learn spatiotemporal features from a video sequence. I3D  inflates all the 2D convolution filters of an Inception V1 model  into 3D convolutions so that ImageNet pre-trained weights can be exploited for initialization. Slowfast 3 employs a two-stream 3D-CNN model to process frames at different sampling rates and resolutions. Due to the heavy computational burden of 3D-CNN, many works attempt to enhance 2D-CNN with temporal modules  [ref]31    . P3D [ref]31 factorizes 3D convolution to 1D temporal convolution and 2D spatial convolution. TSM  presents an efficient shift module, which utilizes left and right shifts of sub-channels to substitute a group-wise weight-fixed 1D temporal convolution. TEA  employs motion excitation and multiple temporal aggregation to capture motion information and increase temporal receptive field. TEINet  uses motion enhanced module and depth-wise 1D convolution for efficient temporal modeling. However, CNN-based methods cannot effectively model long-range dependencies within or cross the frames, which limits their performances. Transformer-based methods. Recently, with the advancement of transformers in 2D vision tasks   4   , many works have been done to apply transformers on video action recognition   4 5. Different from the temporal modeling for CNN, which is mainly implemented by 3D convolution or its factorized versions, in transformers the spatiotemporal SA is naturally introduced to explore the spatiotemporal video correlations. Intuitively, one can use all the spatiotemporal patches to directly compute the SA. However, this operation is very computation and memory expensive. Many works are then proposed to reduce the computation burdens of joint spatiotemporal SA modeling. Timesformer  adopts divided space-time SA, which adds temporal SA after each spatial SA. ViViT  increases the temporal modeling capability by adding several temporal transformer encoders on the top of spatial encoders. Video swin transformer 4 reduces both spatial and temporal dimension by using spatiotemporal local windows. Inspired by the temporal modeling methods in CNN, TokenShift 5 enhances ViT for temporal modeling by applying partial channel shifting on class tokens. The success of temporal modules in 2D-CNN [ref]31     motivates us to develop TPS to enhance a spatial transformer with spatiotemporal feature learning capability. Our work shares the spirits with TokenShift 5 in terms of enhancing the temporal modeling ability of transformers without extra parameters and computation cost. However, our TPS is essentially different from TokenShift. TPS models spatiotemporal SA, while TokenShift is a direct application of TSM in transformer framework, which is in the nature spatial SA with “temporal mixed token”. In addition, TPS does not rely on class token (not exists in many recent transformer models ) and operates directly on patches, which makes it applicable to most recent transformer models.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: Action recognition is a challenging and cornerstone problem in vision.
