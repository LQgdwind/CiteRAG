      "content": "Paper Title: Logics with probabilistic team semantics and the Boolean negation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProbabilistic team semantics is a novel framework for the logical analysis of probabilistic and quantitative dependencies.\nTeam semantics, as a semantic framework for logics involving qualitative dependencies and independencies, was introduced by Hodges  and popularised by V√§√§n√§nen  via his dependence logic.\nTeam semantics defines truth in reference to collections of assignments, called teams, and is particularly suitable for the formal analysis of properties, such as the functional dependence between variables, that arise only in the presence of multiple assignments.\nThe idea of generalising team semantics to the probabilistic setting can be traced back to the works of Galliani  and Hyttinen et al.¬†, however the beginning of a more systematic study of the topic dates back to works of Durand¬†et¬†al.¬†[ref]4. In probabilistic team semantics the basic semantic units are probability distributions (i.e., probabilistic teams).\nThis shift from set-based to distribution-based semantics allows probabilistic notions of dependency, such as conditional probabilistic independence, to be embedded in the framework111In  Li recently introduced first-order theory of random variables with probabilistic independence (FOTPI) whose variables are interpreted by discrete distributions over the unit interval. The paper shows that true arithmetic is interpretable in FOTPI whereas probabilistic independence logic is by our results far less complex..\nThe expressivity and complexity of non-probabilistic team-based logics can be related to fragments of (existential) second-order logic and have been studied extensively (see, e.g.,   ).\nTeam-based logics, by definition, are usually not closed under Boolean negation, so adding it can greatly increase the complexity and expressivity of these logics  5.\nSome expressivity and complexity results have also been obtained for logics in probabilistic team semantics (see below).\nHowever, richer semantic and computational frameworks are sometimes needed to characterise these logics. Metafinite Model Theory, introduced by Gr√§del and Gurevich , generalises the approach of Finite Model Theory by shifting to two-sorted structures, which extend finite structures by another (often infinite) numerical domain and weight functions bridging the two sorts.\nA particularly important subclass of metafinite structures are the so-called ‚Ñù‚Ñù\\mathbb{R}-structures, which extend finite structures with the real arithmetic on the second sort.\nBlum-Shub-Smale machines (BSS machines for short)  are essentially register machines with registers that can store arbitrary real numbers and compute rational functions over reals in a single time step.\nInterestingly, Boolean languages which are decidable by a non-deterministic polynomial-time BSS machine coincide with those languages which are PTIME-reducible to the true existential sentences of real arithmetic (i.e., the complexity class ‚àÉ‚Ñù‚Ñù\\exists\\mathbb{R}) [ref]2 . Recent works have established fascinating connections between second-order logics over ‚Ñù‚Ñù\\mathbb{R}-structures, complexity classes using the BSS-model of computation, and logics using probabilistic team semantics.\nIn 3, Hannula et al.¬†establish that the expressivity and complexity of probabilistic independence logic coincide with a particular fragment of existential second-order logic over ‚Ñù‚Ñù\\mathbb{R}-structures and NP on BSS-machines.\nIn 6, Hannula and Virtema focus on probabilistic inclusion logic, which is shown to be tractable (when restricted to Boolean inputs), and relate it to linear programming. In this paper, we focus on the expressivity and model checking complexity of probabilistic team-based logics that have access to Boolean negation.\nWe also study the connections between probabilistic independence logic and a logic called FOPT‚Äã(‚â§cŒ¥)FOPTsuperscriptsubscriptùëêùõø{\\mathrm{FOPT}(\\leq_{c}^{\\delta})}, which is defined via a computationally simpler probabilistic semantics¬†2.\nThe logic FOPT‚Äã(‚â§cŒ¥)FOPTsuperscriptsubscriptùëêùõø{\\mathrm{FOPT}(\\leq_{c}^{\\delta})} is the probabilistic variant of a certain team-based logic that can define exactly those dependencies that are first-order definable .\nWe also introduce novel entropy atoms and relate the extension of first-order logic with these atoms to probabilistic independence logic. See Figure 1 for our expressivity results and Table 1 for our complexity results.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: to the probabilistic setting can be traced back to the works of Galliani  and Hyttinen et al.¬†, however the beginning of a more systematic study of the topic dates back to works of Durand¬†et¬†al.¬†[ref]4.
