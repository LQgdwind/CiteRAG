      "content": "Paper Title: RelTransformer: A Transformer-Based Long-Tail Visual Relationship Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Visual Relationship Recognition (VRR) task goes beyond recognizing individual objects by comprehensively understanding relationships between interacting objects in a visual scene. Owing to the enriched scene understanding provided by VRR, it benefits various other vision tasks such as image captioning (e.g.,   ), VQA (e.g.,  5), image generation (e.g., ), and 3D scene synthesis (e.g., ). However, due to the imbalanced class distribution in many VRR datasets 0 5, predictions of the most existing models are dominated by the head/frequent relations, lacking generalization on tail/low-shot relationships. Many previous approaches characterize the VRR problem under a graph scenario. Popular graph-based methods iteratively pass massages from other direct or indirect nodes to the relation along with the structure of the graph using the long short-term memory   , or graph attention networks  . However, the graph structure may implicitly constraint the relation to focus on its nearby neighbors. This phenomenon has been observed in recent works  [ref]43, showing that graph neural networks incline to pay most attention to the local surrounding nodes but could not benefit much from distant nodes , and node representations will become indistinguishable if there are many layers [ref]43. Such problems can also be seen in long short-term memory networks due to their iterative message-passing learning nature. However, the target relation can also benefit a lot from the distant nodes. e.g., when we predict the “holding” relationship between “player” and “bat” in Fig. 1, the distant objects such as “catcher” and “umpire” can provide a context that the “player” is in a baseball game, and those can help the model better predict “holding” relationship. To alleviate the aforementioned problems, we propose to adapt self-attention mechanisms originally introduced in Transformer  to tackle the VRR challenges.\nSelf-attention can be viewed as a non-local mean operation , which computes the weighted average of all the inputs. When it applies to the VRR problem, it assumes that the relation has a full connection with all the other nodes in the graph and directly passes the messages among them via attention. In contrast to GNN/LSTM approaches, this strategy can allow the relation to have a larger attention scope and pass the message regardless of the graph structure or spatial constraints. It also avoids the valuable information from distant nodes being suppressed by nearby neighbors. Hence, each relation can selectively attend to its relevant features without spatial constraints and learn a richer-contextualized representation, which can benefit the long-tail visual relationship understanding. In our approach, dubbed as RelTransformer, we reconstruct the scene graph into the relation-triplet and global-scene context as we demonstrated in the Fig. 1.\nThe relation triplet here refers to the target relation and its referred subject and object, such as ⟨player,holding,bat⟩playerholdingbat\\langle\\text{player},\\text{holding},\\text{bat}\\rangle in the figure.\nThe global context represents all the relation triplets that are gathered for each appearing relation. We directly connect the target relation “holding” with every element from the relation triplet and global context, and pass their information to the target relation via self-attention.\nFurthermore, since the long-tail relations tend to be amenable to forgetting, we also propose a novel memory attention module to augment the relation representation with external persistent memory vectors, as we will detail later.\n We showcase the effectiveness of our model on VG200 0 and two recently proposed large-scale long-tail VRR benchmarks, GQA-LT  and VG8K-LT . GQA-LT and VG8K-LT scale the number of relation types up to 300 and 2,000 compared to only 50 relation types in VG200. These two benchmarks are highly skewed (e.g., the VG8K-LT benchmark ranges from 14 to 618,687 examples per relation type) and offer us a suitable platform for studying long-tail VRR problems. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art on those three datasets in our experimental results, demonstrating its effectiveness. We also conducted several ablative experiments and showed the usefulness of each component design in RelTransformer.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: memory   , or graph attention networks  .
