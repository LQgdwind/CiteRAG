For the œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-kernel problem, Agarwal, Har-Peled, and Varadarajan proved in their seminal paper  that an œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-kernel of size O‚Äã(œµ‚àí(d‚àí1)/2)ùëÇsuperscriptitalic-œµùëë12O(\\epsilon^{-(d-1)/2}) exists for a set of nùëõn points in the dùëëd-dimensional space ‚Ñùdsuperscript‚Ñùùëë\\mathbb{R}^{d}. However, an œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-kernel could be much smaller in practice¬†3.\nTherefore, it is well-motivated to study algorithms for computing instance-optimal œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-kernels.\nThe problem unfortunately becomes NP-hard in ‚Ñù3superscript‚Ñù3\\mathbb{R}^{3}¬†.\nAgarwal and Har-Peled¬† thus studied the exact algorithms for the 2D case.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: have been proposed¬†  .\nOn the other hand, the problem becomes polynomial-time solvable if all disk centers lie on the same line or if the disk centers and the points are separated by a line¬†[ref]5    .\nAnother well-studied case of geometric set cover is the rectangle coverage problem where the given geometric objects are (axis-parallel) rectangles.\nThis problem is also NP-hard, even\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
