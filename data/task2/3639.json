      "content": "Paper Title: Fine-Grained Scene Graph Generation with Data Transfer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe first validate the generalizability of our method with different baseline models and its effectiveness when compared with current SOTA methods. Datasets. Popular VG-50¬†[ref]31 benchmark is employed, which consists of 50 predicate classes and 150 object classes. Tasks.\nFollowing previous works¬†[ref]31 [ref]23 [ref]39, we evaluate our model on three widely used SGG tasks:\n(1) Predicate Classification (PREDCLS) provides both localization and object classes, and requires models to recognize predicate classes.\n(2) Scene Graph Classification (SGCLS) provides only correct localization and asks models to recognize both object and predicate classes.\n(3) In Scene Graph Detection (SGDET), models are required to first detect the bounding boxes and then recognize both object and predicate classes. Metrics.\nFollowing previous works¬† , we use Recall@K (R@K) and mean Recall@K (mR@K) as our metrics.\nHowever, different trade-offs between R@K and mR@K are made in\ndifferent methods, which makes it hard to make a direct comparison.\nTherefore, we further propose an overall metric F@K to jointly evaluate R@K and\nmR@K, which is the harmonic average of R@K and mR@K. Baselines.\nWe categorize several baseline methods into two categories:\n(1) Model-agnostic baselines. They refers to methods that can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion. For this part, we include Resampling¬†, TDE¬†[ref]23, CogTree¬†, EBM¬†, DeC¬†, and DLFE¬†.\n(2) Specific models. We also include some dedicated designed models with strong performance, including KERN¬†, KERN¬†, GBNet¬†, BGNN¬†, DT2-ACBS¬†, and PCPL¬†. Implementation Details.\nFollowing [ref]23, we employ a pre-trained Faster-RCNN¬† with ResNeXt-101-FPN¬†  backbone.\nIn the training process, the parameters of the detector are fixed to reduce the computation cost.\nThe batch size is set to 12, and the learning rate is 0.12, except for Transformer.\nWe optimize all models with an SGD optimizer. Specifically, to better balance the data distribution, the external transfer will not be conducted for the top 15 frequent predicate classes.\nTo avoid deviating too much from the original data distribution, the frequency bias item calculated from the original dataset is applied to our IETrans in the inference stage.\nFor internal and external transfer, the kIsubscriptùëòùêºk_{I} is set to 70% and kEsubscriptùëòùê∏k_{E} is set to 100%.\nPlease refer to the Appendix for more details. Comparison with SOTAs.\nWe report the results of our IETrans and baselines for VG-50 in Table ¬†1.\nBased on the observation of experimental results, we have summarized the following conclusions: Our IETrans is adaptive to different baseline models.\nWe equip our method with 4 different models, including Motif¬†[ref]39, VCTree¬†, GPS-Net¬†, and Transformer¬†[ref]23.\nThe module architectures range from conventional CNN to TreeLSTM (VCTree) and self-attention layers (Transformer).\nThe training algorithm contains both supervised training and reinforcement learning (VCTree).\nDespite the model diversity, our IETrans can boost all models‚Äô mR@K metric and also achieve competitive F@K performance.\nFor example, our IETrans can double mR@50/100 and improve the overall metric F@50/100 for over 9 points across all 3 tasks for GPS-Net. Compared with other model-agnostic methods, our method outperforms all of them in nearly all metrics.\nFor example, when applying IETrans to Motif on PREDCLS, our model can achieve the highest R@50/100 and mR@50/100 among all model-agnostic baselines except for DeC.\nAfter adding the reweighting strategy, our IETrans can outperform DeC on mR@K. Compared with strong specific baselines, our method can also achieve competitive performance on mR@50/100, and best overall performance on F@50/100.\nConsidering mR@50/100, our method with reweighting strategy is slightly lower than DT2-ACBS on SGCLS and SGDET tasks, while our method performs much better than them on R@50/100 (e.g., 24.3 points of VCTree on PREDCLS task).\nFor overall comparison considering F@50/100 metrics, our VCTree+IETrans+Rwt can achieve the best F@50/100 on PREDCLS and Motif+IETrans+Rwt achieves the best F@50/100 in SGCLS and SGDET task.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: We first validate the generalizability of our method with different baseline models and its effectiveness when compared with current SOTA methods.
