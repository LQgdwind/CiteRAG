      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting the Fragility of Influence Functions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider large neural networks as having more parameters, more non-linear operations owing to their depth, and reluctantly requiring large datasets for training. We note that originally Cook and Weisberg derived influence functions for regression models, which can be considered as neural networks with one layer and mean-square error loss function [ref]7. Recently, Koh et al.  extended the idea of using influence functions in deep neural networks by treating all but the last layer of the deep neural network as a feature extractor. The influence functions were computed with respect to only the last layer. This practice seems to work in some cases and produce promising results . However, it does not account for the large dimensionality of the final layer of modern neural networks. This proves to be a problem when these large parameter matrices become ill-conditioned . This problem was captured by Basu et al.  in their analysis of large datasets like CIFAR-100 and ImageNet where true differences in losses from removing training instances resulted in very noisy results. Large neural networks may have more layers (depth) and/or more operations per layer (width). This results in increasing the number of non-linear operations which are performed on the data for calculating the loss function. The most popular implementation of influence functions, as defined by Koh et al. , relies on only a first-order Taylor series approximation to efficiently compute influence (Eq. 21). We argue that the increasing number of non-linear operations strongly affects the convexity assumption of loss function R‚Äã(Œ∏)ùëÖùúÉR(\\theta) (Eq. 16) as used in the mathematical relationships derived for influence functions (Eq. 17). There is evidence suggesting that adding the second term of the Taylor series in the influence function approximation improves the estimates [ref]19 0. Finally, large networks typically go hand-in-hand with large datasets. From equation 1, it is evident that removing a training instance is equivalent to up-weighting it by œµ=‚àí1nitalic-œµ1ùëõ\\epsilon=-\\frac{1}{n}. In the Iris dataset, |œµ|‚âà6.6‚Äãe‚àí3italic-œµ6.6ùëí3|\\epsilon|\\approx 6.6e-3 compared to MNIST where |œµ|‚âà1.6‚Äãe‚àí5italic-œµ1.6ùëí5|\\epsilon|\\approx 1.6e-5. Any larger datasets will lead to smaller epsilon, that is: In other words, owing to the large dataset, the influence of a single training point on a test sample is asymptotically approaching zero. Perhaps the first-order Taylor series approximation of the influence functions does not provide enough resolution to predict loss differences when predicting on only one training instance. If one wanted to use influence functions in large datasets like CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, one would have to turn to higher-order approximations of influence functions as well as group influences. In Basu et al. 0, promising results were obtained by examining the effect of a second-order approximation as well as group influence. These solutions of course have an associated cost. Adding a second-order term increases the cost and complexity of the analysis. Optimal group selection is also a non-trivial and expensive operation. While there is theoretical evidence to suggest that the first-order implementation of influence functions is fragile, due to the difficulty of finding robust ways to empirically evaluate them in difficult settings, their supposed fragility remains unclear.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: training.
