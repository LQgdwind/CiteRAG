Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

NAS-Bench-201[ref]19 has 15,625 different cell candidates, all of which are composed of 4 nodes and 6 edges. Unlike NAS-Bench-101, architectures in NAS-Bench-201[ref]19 have its operations on the edges, which belong to “operation on edge” (OOE) search space. This change of emphasis has no impact to our implementation, since only the operation types and connection relations are needed to learn the representation. The evaluation indicators is Kendall’s Tau.\nThe dataset is still divided according to , where 5%, 10% and 50% of the whole dataset is used for training, and another 200 samples are used for validation. Kendall’s Tau is calculated on the whole dataset. Results Comparison.\nAs shown in Tab. 2, whose values except for our method are reported by TNASP, earlier method[ref]30 using LSTM for encoding has the ability to roughly predict accuracy. Compared with NAO[ref]30, there is a marked increase in the results of the GCN-based method. Taking advantage of transformer\n, TNASP makes a further improvement.\nAs we can see, our NAR-Former significantly outperforms by 0.159, 0.175 compared to the previous highest TNASP+SE under two different experiment settings, respectively. This provides evidence that NAR-Former can learn pretty effective representation of architectures for\naccuracy prediction.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: Setup.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
