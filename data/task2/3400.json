In particular, firstly, sustainable traffic requires higher efficiency to reduce enormous monetary losses caused by excessive traffic delays. Secondly, more eco-friendly driving should be encouraged to decrease fuel consumption and gas emissions (mainly CO2). Thirdly, traffic safety is one of the key indicators for sustainable traffic, inherently, which should be enhanced by avoiding potential collisions to save lives. Last but not least, to achieve those sustainable traffic goals, easy-to-deploy ITS infrastructure is critical. Most existing research in sustainable urban traffic control adjusts either traffic light signals or vehicle speed. Traffic light signal controllers dynamically select the best timing plan according to the real-time traffic. As shown in Fig.1, this can directly increase the intersection throughput, thus reducing travel time as well as energy consumption and emissions. CAV can proactively control vehicles’ acceleration, as shown in Fig. 1, to achieve more stable traffic nearby with relatively higher driving velocity (i.e., lower fuel consumption and gas emissions) and keep a safe distance  from the surrounding traffic (i.e., longer time-to-collision). Recent research from the transportation domain attempts to explore the potential of joint control for both traffic light signals and vehicle speed. Methodologies used in such research include mixed-integer linear programming , the enumeration method and the pseudo-spectral method [ref]4. However, these methods may not perform well in realistic traffic scenarios because their deterministic traffic control decisions are insufficient to deal with a fast-changing urban environment. Unlike the aforementioned traditional methods, many researchers nowadays have demonstrated the great potential of DRL in solving traffic control challenges under complex urban scenarios. For instance, inspired by the traditional traffic signal control method MaxPressure , PressLight  can achieve even better traffic efficiency improvements under various urban scenarios using DRL. Moreover, the DRL-based traffic signal control can also reduce the waiting time of specific vehicles in emergency situations in which traffic condition varies quickly. On the other hand, efficient and effective CAV speed control can stabilize traffic in many complex and changing road scenarios using DRL[ref]9, which is traditionally infeasible using optimization-based controllers. However, there is a lack of research using DRL for the joint control of both urban intersection signals and vehicle speed. This DRL-based joint control is challenging due to the difficulty of designing a proper cooperation scheme for two different agent types (i.e., traffic light controllers and CAV). Moreover, the unpredictability of urban mixed-autonomy traffic makes it even harder to converge within a reasonable number of training iterations. To overcome the limitations mentioned above, we propose CoTV: a multi-agent DRL-based system that can cooperatively control traffic light signals and CAV. CoTV well balances the advantages of both traffic light controllers and CAV to achieve more sustainable traffic, as shown in Fig.1. Concretely, the contributions of our work are as follows: Effective cooperation schemes between CAVs and traffic light controllers. Different from the methodology in the literature on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for traffic control, instead of using action-dependent design  (i.e., the action of one agent depends on the action of other agents in the shared environment), our cooperation schemes rely on the exchange of states between agents within the range of one intersection, including the traffic light controller and approaching CAVs. This so-called “action-independent MARL”  can work in our CoTV as the objective of traffic light controller and CAV for the traffic improvement are inherently complementary (i.e., rather than overlapping: all improving travel time or reducing fuel). Thus, CoTV takes advantage of the simplicity of “action-independent MARL” design on DRL training and keeps the effectiveness of CoTV in improving traffic under various scenarios. The cooperation schemes of CoTV are shown to facilitate training convergence, which is challenging for independent MARL that does not include any cooperation (either state or action). Specifically, our CoTV using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)  obtains up to 30% reduction in both travel time and fuel consumption & CO2 emissions under varying CAV penetration rates. Scalable to complex urban scenarios by avoiding cooperation with excessive CAV agents. Compared with controlling all possible CAVs using MARL, the traffic light controller in our CoTV selects the closest CAV to the intersection on each incoming road as the CAV agent. This idea is inspired by platooning can increase intersection throughput , as the leading vehicle in a certain road has the great potential to form a platoon with the rest vehicles on the same road. We also demonstrate that compared with coordinating all CAVs (CoTV*), CoTV does not compromise efficiency improvement while significantly reducing the training time and resources used. Efficient communication exchange schemes between CAV and traffic light controllers. The amount of state information exchanged between CAV and traffic light controllers is low enough. As shown in Fig.2, the communication schemes are designed to exchange the speed, acceleration, and location of CAVs and the current signal phase of traffic light controllers to each other. The information exchange requires less than 100 Kbps transmission rate, which can be achieved using Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-To-Infrastructure (V2I) communication infrastructure. The wireless communication technology IEEE 802.11p supports a bandwidth of 3 Mbps to 20 Mbps . This paper extends our previous work  to control traffic light signals and CAV cooperatively using DRL. The improvements include: 1) The system framework of CoTV is designed for addressing scalability issues, resulting in the significantly reduced number of CAV agents controlled. 2) The state and reward for agents are simplified by removing redundant traffic information. Therefore, the amount of information exchanged among agents is reduced to ease the deployment of CoTV. 3) The testing scenarios are extended from a small grid map to more realistic urban scenarios. 4) We demonstrate the robustness of CoTV under different CAV penetration rates. 5) As an important requirement of achieving sustainable traffic, the effectiveness of CoTV in enhancing traffic safety is evaluated by time-to-collision . 6) Two other common MARL approaches, action-dependent and independent, are compared with the action-independent MARL of our CoTV in terms of policy training and traffic improvements.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Developing the next generation Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is one of the key ways to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDG)[ref]1.
