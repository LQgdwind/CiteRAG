      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Contour Tracking of Live Cells by Mechanical and Cycle Consistency Losses\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDuring cell migration, cells change their morphology by expanding or contracting their plasma membranes continuously like viscoelastic materials .\nThe dynamic change in the morphology of a live cell is called cellular morphodynamics and ranges from cellular to the subcellular movement of contour at varying spatiotemporal scales. While cellular morphodynamics plays a vital role in angiogenesis, immune response, stem cell differentiation, and cancer invasiveness  [ref]17, it is challenging to understand the various functions of cellular morphodynamics because its uncharacterized heterogeneity could mask crucial mechanistic details.\nAs an initial step to understanding cellular morphodynamics, cellular morphodynamics is quantified by tracking every point along the cellular contour (contour tracking) and estimating their velocity  [ref]13 .\nThen, quantification of cellular morphodynamics is further processed by other downstream machine learning tasks to characterize the drug-sensitive morphodynamic phenotypes with distinct molecular mechanisms   .\nBecause contour tracking (e.g., Fig. 1) is the important first step, the tracking accuracy is crucial in this live cell analysis. There are two main difficulties involved with contour tracking of a live cell. First, the live cell’s contour exhibits visual features that can be difficult to distinguish by human eyes, meaning that a pixel and its neighboring pixels have similar color values or features.\nOptical flow   can track every pixel in the current frame by assuming that the corresponding pixel in the next frame will have the same distinct feature, but this assumption is not sufficient to find corresponding pixels given cellular visual features.\nSecond, the expansion and contraction of the cellular contour change the total number of tracking points due to one point splitting into many points or many points converging into one.\nPoST tracks a fixed number of a sparse set of points that cannot accurately represent the fluctuating shape of the cellular contour.\nOther deep contour tracking or video segmentation methods    do not provide dense point-to-point correspondence information between a contour and its next contour. Previous cellular contour tracking method (mechanical model)  evades the first problem by taking the segmentation of the cell body as inputs instead of raw images. Then, it finds the dense correspondences of all points between two contours by minimizing the normal torsion force and linear spring force with the Marquard-Levenberg algorithm [ref]23.\nHowever, the mechanical model has limited accuracy because it does not consider visual features in raw images.\nAlso, its linear spring force which keeps every distance between points the same is less effective during the expansion and contraction of the cell, as shown in our experiments (see Tab. 1). Therefore, we present a deep learning-based contour tracker that can overcome these difficulties.\nOur contour tracker is comprised of a feature encoder, two cross attentions , and a fully connected neural network (FCNN) for offset regression, as shown in Fig. 2.\nGiven two consecutive images and their contours represented as a sequence of points, our contour tracker encodes the visual features of two images and samples their feature at the location of contours.\nThe sampling makes our contour tracker focus on contour features and reduces the noise from irrelevant features unlike optical flow .\nThe cross attention  fuses the sampled features from two contours globally and locally and regresses the offset for each contour point of the first frame.\nTo obtain the dense point-to-point correspondences between the current and the next contours, offset points from the current contour are matched with the closest contour points in the next frame.\nIn every frame, some contour points merge due to contraction, so new contour points emerge in the next frame as shown in Fig. 1. With dense point-to-point correspondences, new contour points in the next contour are also tracked.\nThe proposed architectural design achieves the best accuracy among variants, including circular convolutions , and correspondence matrix .\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based contour tracking with dense point-to-point correspondences for live cells. In this contour tracking, supervised learning is not feasible because it is difficult to label every point of the contour manually.\nInstead, we propose to train our contour tracker solely by unsupervised learning comprised of mechanical and cycle consistency losses.\nInspired by the mechanical model  that minimizes the normal torsion and linear spring force, we introduce the mechanical losses to end-to-end learning. The mechanical-normal loss that keeps the angle difference small between the offset point and the direction normal to the cellular contour played a significant role in boosting accuracy. Also, we implement cycle consistency loss to encourage all contour points tracked forward-then-backward to return to their original location.\nHowever, previous approaches such as PoST  and Animation Transformer (AnT)  rely on supervised learning in addition to cycle consistency loss or find mid-level correspondences  instead of pixel-level correspondences. We evaluate our contour tracker on the live cell dataset taken with a phase contrast microscope [ref]13 and another live cell dataset taken with a confocal fluorescence microscope .\nFor a quantitative comparison of contour tracking methods, we labeled sparse tracking points on the contour of live cells for all sampled frames. In total, we labeled 13 live cell videos for evaluation. Evaluation with a sparse set of points is motivated by the fact that if tracking of dense contour points is accurate, tracking any one of contour points should be accurate also.\nWe also qualitatively show our contour tracker works on another viscoelastic organism, jellyfish .\nOur contributions are summarized as follows. We propose the first deep learning-based model that tracks cellular contours densely while surpassing the accuracy of other methods. We present an unsupervised learning strategy by mechanical loss and cycle consistency loss for contour tracking. We demonstrate that the use of forward and backward cross attention with cycle consistency has a synergistic effect on finding accurate dense correspondences. We label tracking points in the live cell videos and quantitatively evaluate cellular contour tracking for the first time.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: movement of contour at varying spatiotemporal scales.
