      "content": "Paper Title: A Graph-based Methodology for the Sensorless Estimation of Road Traffic Profiles\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraffic behavior is more complex to model in cities, due to the multiple factors that can alter urban traffic [ref]3. This fact, combined with the low number of public urban RCD datasets, clarifies why not so long ago, urban road traffic data was scarcely studied .\nIt is not until recent years when research papers on this context have seen its number increased [ref]3. However, the majority of urban traffic-focused manuscripts were conducted over taxi or bike FCD. The traffic flow of the entire network can not be predicted from these kinds of datasets. Since FCD is gathered from individuals, only a fraction of the total flow can be modeled. Speed and travel time forecasting models can be learned from FCD, but when modeling the whole traffic flow of a road segment, RCD is preferred. The disposal of synthetic data can provide benefits to the field, by giving access to urban traffic data of similar characteristics regarding a target location. Synthetic data is rooted in the idea of producing artificial samples following a statistical distribution , which should be close to the real-world task to be modeled. Microscopic simulation tools, where the dynamics of each vehicle is modeled, such as SUMO , VISSIM , CORSIM , and MATSIM , provide complex scenarios that allow to study not only traffic congestion, but also protocols for traffic light switching, emissions, energy consumption and so on . With such simulation tools, complex but still detailed flow traffic profiles for multiple road segments of a traffic network can be produced. Nevertheless, research can sometimes be heavily concentrated on the concept of traffic congestion, and therefore, it is mostly considered as influencing factors the weather, accidents reports or infrastructure change works. Simulation tools do not consider other fundamental aspects that concern the traffic profile. While freeway traffic can behave similarly under a fixed set of conditions, city traffic is highly influenced by additional factors, inherent to the urban areas. Events, road construction/restoration, etc., are difficult to include into simulations. The socio-cultural particularities of every major community at a city also models the traffic behavior. Still, it is hard to embed this knowledge within the configuration of simulation tools. A methodology for generating synthetic traffic samples for non-sensed locations is presented in  to cover the above issues. The authors exploit the knowledge that can be learned from neighboring sensed road segments. Deep learning regression and GAN models are explored as data generation methods. It is a challenging task since there is not an explicit statistical distribution to be learned, due to the lack of real data at target locations. Likewise, traffic data exhibit a multi-modal nature, where not a single but multiple distributions or modes must be learned towards an accurate representation of data. In the context of traffic, these modes can be interpreted as the distribution followed by observed data under certain conditions (e.g., holidays and day of the week). Therefore, not only several distributions must be learned without the disposal of traffic data from the road segment of interest, but also the correct mode must be selected towards generating plausible synthetic data. This issue is addressed by using a set of conditions that groups traffic recordings according to the resemblance of their traffic patterns. Although the authors point out that mode selection can be improved by delving into the conditioning of generative systems, their main concern is to find a road segment with a similar traffic behavior. The generation systems will output divergent traffic patterns if the behavior of the selected roads is not close to the target location. Being exploratory research, a na√Øve criterion is adopted, where the closest ATRs available from the surroundings served as data sources. This approach entails speculation, where sometimes the selected data sources have similar traffic profiles, but in other cases traffic highly differs.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Traffic behavior is more complex to model in cities, due to the multiple factors that can alter urban traffic [ref]3.
