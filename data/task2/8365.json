      "content": "Paper Title: Instance-Aware Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReferring Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment the objects described by an input language expression. Standard RES approaches   4  mainly focus on single-target scenarios with the input expression describing a single object, e.g., “the kid in red”. Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES) broadens this scope to handle more complex cases, including expressions that refer to multiple objects, such as “all people,” or cases where the input image may not contain any valid target. To handle GRES, recent works [ref]17    utilize transformer-based architectures to improve the multimodal interaction. ReLA [ref]17 models the complex interactions among regions and the dependencies between different parts of the image and words in the expression. LQMFormer  addresses query collapse and performs query selection through a multi-modal query feature fusion technique. HDC  enhances the decoding process through a hierarchical scheme with object counting to model complete semantic context.\nDespite these advances, all these methods share a common limitation: they all follow an end-to-end approach that predicts a single foreground-background mask and lack an explicit mechanism to differentiate and associate individual object instances with specific parts of the text query. Consequently, they struggle with complex prompts referring to multiple distinct objects, leaving such cases as an open challenge.\nFor example, when asked to segment “the girl who holds a small dog and the dog on the right” in the image shown in Fig. 1, most methods either segment all girls and dogs indiscriminately or get inaccurate segments, as observed with the state-of-the-art GRES method ReLA [ref]17.\nThus, we need a model to explicitly predict and link relevant objects to specific semantic entities of the input text, to accurately segment each object described in complex expressions. To this end, we introduce InstAlign, a novel GRES model that incorporates instance-level reasoning into the segmentation process. Our approach is simple but effective; we adapt the instance segmentation framework  [ref]4  to identify and segment only object instances described in the prompt. To facilitate this, we design a novel loss function to constrain each segmented object to explicitly link to specific semantic entities of the input text. Thus, InstAlign  learns to parse both the input text and images into small components to establish explicit connections between the input expression and the corresponding objects in the image. Specifically, we integrate text prompt inputs in a query-based instance segmentation architecture, Mask2Former [ref]4, and guide this model to identify and segment only object instances in the image that correspond to the input expression. To achieve this, we ensure that each segmented object is precisely linked to the specific semantic component (i.e., phrase) of the input text describing it. We enforce this through our proposed Phrase-Object Alignment loss function, which explicitly identifies the text phrase from the input expression that best corresponds to each segmented object and strengthens this association. This alignment ensures that the model not only identifies and segments the correct objects but also captures the fine-grained relationships between textual phrases and visual instances. Further, we propose two modules to adapt the instance segmentation framework to the GRES setting: an Adaptive-Instance-Aggregation (AIA) module and a no-target prediction head.\nAIA automatically integrates all segmented object instances based on their relevance scores to predict the final mask. This enhances the model’s focus on the most relevant instances, thereby improving segmentation performance and robustness in complex GRES scenarios. The no-target prediction head aggregates both text and object instance features to accurately predict the target-absent cases. We evaluate InstAlign  on two widely used benchmarks for GRES: gRefCOCO [ref]17 and Ref-ZOM . Our experiments demonstrate that InstAlign significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GRES methods and LLM-based approaches   7. The results highlight InstAlign’s ability to handle complex referring expressions, setting a new standard in the field. Our main contributions are: We propose InstAlign, the first instance-aware approach to GRES that effectively handles complex multi-object scenarios by explicitly differentiating and associating individual object instances with specific phrases in the text. We introduce a phrase-object alignment mechanism, enabling our model to link each segmented object with the corresponding semantic part of the input text. We develop an Adaptive Instance Aggregation module that dynamically integrates segmented object instances based on their relevance scores, improving overall segmentation performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard GRES benchmarks, significantly improving segmentation accuracy. On gRefCOCO, InstAlign  achieves a gIoU of 74.34%percent74.3474.34\\% and N-acc of 79.72%percent79.7279.72\\%, outperforming previous methods by 3.3%percent3.33.3\\% and 12.25%percent12.2512.25\\%, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: handle more complex cases, including expressions that refer to multiple objects, such as “all people,” or cases where the input image may not contain any valid target.
