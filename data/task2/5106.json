      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting Color-Event based Tracking: A Unified Network, Dataset, and Metric\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual object tracking targets locating the initialized target object using a series of bounding boxes in the color videos. It is one of the most important tasks in computer vision and provides a good basis for other vision tasks, such as activity recognition, person re-identification, and trajectory analysis. Many representative trackers are proposed like MDNet [ref]1, SiamFC , SiamRPN , DiMP , TransT .\nAlthough these Color-based trackers exhibit satisfactory outcomes in straightforward scenarios, their efficacy notably falters under intricate challenging scenarios like low illumination, over-exposure, fast motion, heavy occlusion, and background clutter.\nIn these situations, the RGB camera will generate low-quality visible color videos while event camera can promote tracking performance with its bio-inspired sensor and motion-sensitive character. To address the limitations arising from single-modal defects, some researchers resort to fusing color and event cameras for reliable object tracking. As the event camera is a bio-inspired sensor, which records binary events (i.e., the ON and OFF event) in each pixel when the variation of light intensity exceeds the given threshold. It shows significant advantages over RGB cameras in the high dynamic range (HDR), low energy consumption, and low latency. The dense temporal resolution makes it almost free from the interference of motion blur, and HDR ensures its imaging performance in low-illumination and over-exposure scenarios. Simultaneously, RGB cameras provide color and texture information that hold significant relevance for tracking. The integration of color and event cameras provides a new avenue for practical tracking. Despite their scarcity, a handful of studies have delved into the fusion scheme for color-event-based tracking [ref]6 [ref]7   .\nTo be specific,\nZhang et al. [ref]7 design the cross-domain feature integrator to fuse the color and event data.\nHuang et al.  reconstruct grey frames from event streams to enhance the feature learning for their SVM-based tracker.\nThese algorithms divide the tracking into multiple stages, including backbone network, feature fusion, interactive head, and tracking head, as shown in Fig. 1 (a)-(b).\nNote that, Siamese matching based color-event trackers [ref]7 [ref]6 involve the template and search feature extraction and matching, which further complicates the tracking framework. Further, their models achieve about 20 and 14 FPS only, which makes it hard to achieve real-time tracking in practical applications. This inspired us to think about designing a unified and simple multi-modal tracking framework to achieve efficient and accurate tracking. The recently proposed Transformer  has shown its natural advantages and effects in simplifying network structure, such as object detection , segmentation , and tracking  .\nHowever, there is still no work to design a unified tracking framework for color-event object tracking task. In this paper, we propose a unified single-stage tracking framework to accomplish color-event tracking, termed CEUTrack. As shown in Fig. 1 (c), it contains three main modules, including the projection embedding layer, unified adaptive backbone, and tracking head.\nWith the event stream sampled from DVS, we first reconstruct the event points into voxel sets for efficient representation.\nAccompanied by the template and search branch inputs, CEUTrack crops the color frames and event voxel sets to get four regularized pending tensors.\nAfter projection, these inputs are embedded into multi-modal tokens and fed into the unified vision transformer backbone. To facilitate information flow between different Transformer blocks, we propose the use of adapters to connect various Transformer layers. Specifically, we utilize cross-attention to aggregate the input and output of the Transformers, allowing for better capture of richer multi-level feature representations. The tracking head projects the output tokens to predict the trajectory of the target object. Compared with the popular Siamese frameworks (dual-branch for unimodal, four-branch for bimodal data), our proposed CEUTrack involves multi-modal tracking into single-branch architecture that concatenates all of the tokens as one entry. Therefore, it simplifies the multi-modal (color-event) tracking significantly and achieves a very high running efficiency (75 FPS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves new SOTA (State-Of-The-Art) performance on previous and proposed color-event tracking datasets. To better validate the effectiveness of our model and facilitate the community, we also propose a large-scale benchmark dataset for Color-Event multi-modality Single Object Tracking, termed COESOT. It contains 1354 aligned video sequences captured by the DVS346 event camera, in which the training and testing subsets have 827 and 527 videos respectively. The target object of COESOT covers a more comprehensive range of categories than existing color-event tracking datasets [ref]7 [ref]6, like vehicles, pedestrian, card, toy, bird, monkey, tiger, elephant, zebra, crocodile, etc. To fully reflect the vital challenging factors in visual and event tracking, 17 attributes are annotated to help detailly evaluate the performance of the trackers. More detailed introductions and comparisons can be found in Section 4 and Table 1. In addition, we also propose a new evaluation metric named BreakOut Capability score (BOC) for visual object tracking. Different from existing metrics that treat each video equally to get a precision score, such as PR (Precision Rate), NPR (Normalized Precision Rate), and SR (Success Rate), BOC score focuses more on the prominence of the evaluated tracking algorithm compared with existing ones. In other words, a higher weight proportion will be given for a challenging video, while an ordinary proportion will be assigned for a simple video. Note that the difficulty of each video is comprehensively measured by the accuracy of existing trackers. To sum up, the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as the following four aspects: ∙∙\\bullet We propose an adaptive unified tracking framework based on a transformer network, termed CEUTrack, which is the first simplified one-stage backbone for color-event tracking that achieves feature extraction, fusion, and interactive learning simultaneously. ∙∙\\bullet We propose a large-scale and general benchmark dataset for color-event tracking, termed COESOT. It consists of the most significantly abundant categories of target objects and video sequences in color-event tracking community to date. We extend multiple modern baseline methods on the COESOT for future works’ benchmark comparison. ∙∙\\bullet We propose a new evaluation metric for the tracking task, termed BOC score. It can better reflect the outstanding ability of the tracking algorithm compared with the existing baseline methods on difficult videos. ∙∙\\bullet Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks (COESOT, VisEvent, FE108) assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed tracker CEUTrack sets new SOTA performance on existing datasets meanwhile running at a remarkable speed (75 FPS).\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: vision and provides a good basis for other vision tasks, such as activity recognition, person re-identification, and trajectory analysis.
