      "content": "Paper Title: Neural networks for bifurcation and linear stability analysis of steady states in partial differential equations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConsider a general PDE with a known parameter μ𝜇\\mu for the steady-state solution u​(x):ℝd→ℝ:𝑢x→superscriptℝ𝑑ℝu(\\textbf{x}):\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} on the domain Ω∈ℝdΩsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\Omega\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} given by where N𝑁N and B𝐵B are the differential operators in the interior and on the boundary. For easy calculation, we can rewrite the PDE in Eq. (28) into the following form In case of the Bratu equation, we have μ=C𝜇𝐶\\mu=C\nwhile in case of the Burgers equation we have μ=ρ𝜇𝜌\\mu=\\rho or μ=φ𝜇𝜑\\mu=\\varphi. In order to solve the PDE in Eq. (29) for a fixed value of the parameter μ𝜇\\mu, a multilayer neural network (NN1) can be used to provide an approximate solution u​(x,θ)𝑢x𝜃u(\\textbf{x},\\theta) where θ𝜃\\theta represents all the weights of the network. If we choose nIsubscript𝑛𝐼n_{I} collocation points in the interior, xiI∈Ωsuperscriptsubscriptx𝑖𝐼Ω\\textbf{x}_{i}^{I}\\in\\Omega, 1≤i≤nI1𝑖subscript𝑛𝐼1\\leq i\\leq n_{I}, and nBsubscript𝑛𝐵n_{B} points on the boundary, xiB∈∂Ωsuperscriptsubscriptx𝑖𝐵Ω\\textbf{x}_{i}^{B}\\in\\partial\\Omega, 1≤i≤nB1𝑖subscript𝑛𝐵1\\leq i\\leq n_{B}, then the weights can be obtained by solving the following system of nonlinear equations The nonlinear system then can be solved by Newton’s method  or its variants. The nonlinear system also can be transformed into a loss function where the first term in the loss function represents the error in the interior and the second term represents the error on the boundary for the PDE in Eq. (29).\nIn addition, a new weight α𝛼\\alpha can be used to get a more precise solution.\nThe effect of choosing the value of α𝛼\\alpha has been explained in .\nThe loss function in Eq. (31) can be solved with SGD-type (stochastic gradient descent) algorithms such as the Adam optimizer . Other researchers use the limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (L-BFGS) method , which is a full-batch gradient-based optimization algorithm, and they showed that it also works well in solving PDEs  . Researchers suggest incorporating the hyperbolic tangent   as an activation function defined by for the general purpose of approximating functions. Still, other differentiable activation functions also can be considered, such as the sigmoid function, or the Gaussian function, Note that, since the hyperbolic tangent, sigmoid, and Gaussian are in C∞superscript𝐶C^{\\infty}, then for each fixed θ𝜃\\theta, the map x→u​(x,θ)→x𝑢x𝜃\\textbf{x}\\to u(\\textbf{x},\\theta) is also in C∞superscript𝐶C^{\\infty}. In case of a neural network with two hidden layers, if we express θ𝜃\\theta as a combination of some weights and biases, W1subscript𝑊1W_{1}, b1subscript𝑏1b_{1}, W2subscript𝑊2W_{2}, b2subscript𝑏2b_{2}, W3subscript𝑊3W_{3}, b3subscript𝑏3b_{3}, then the output u​(x,θ)𝑢x𝜃u(\\textbf{x},\\theta) can be expressed by where σ𝜎\\sigma represents the activation function.\nAfter obtaining u​(x,θ)𝑢x𝜃u(\\textbf{x},\\theta), numerical differentiation or automatic differentiation [ref]4 can be used to find the derivatives that appear in Eq. (29). Neural networks with p𝑝p inputs, l𝑙l hidden layers with q𝑞q neurons in each layer, and one output has weights to be optimized simultaneously. An example of the architecture of a neural network, with two inputs, four hidden layers with 202020 neurons in each layer, and one output, for solving PDEs is shown in Fig. 1.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: can be expressed by where σ𝜎\\sigma represents the activation function.\nAfter obtaining u​(x,θ)𝑢x𝜃u(\\textbf{x},\\theta), numerical differentiation or automatic differentiation [ref]4 can be used to find the derivatives that appear in Eq. (29).
