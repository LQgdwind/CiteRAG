      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Universe Model for Partial Matching Networks over Multiple Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFinding consistent association among multiple objects is a fundamental task in pattern recognition and computer vision. The applications range from image registration , structure from motion [ref]2 , object tracking  , optical flow   , stereo matching  0, and pose estimation 1 2, etc.\nIn these tasks, not only the appearance but also the structure of the objects play an important role in establishing the correspondence. In particular, graph matching (GM) aims to find node correspondence between graph-structured data via second-order 3 4 or even high-order information 5, which has shown its superiority on robustness against local noise. Specifically, Lawler’s quadratic assignment programming (QAP) is the most general form for two-graph matching: where 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} is a (partial) permutation matrix encoding node-to-node correspondence, and vec​(𝐗)vec𝐗\\textrm{vec}(\\mathbf{X}) is its column-vectorized version. 𝟏nsubscript1𝑛\\mathbf{1}_{n} represents column vector of length n𝑛n whose elements all equal to 111. 𝐊∈ℝn1​n2×n1​n2𝐊superscriptℝsubscript𝑛1subscript𝑛2subscript𝑛1subscript𝑛2\\mathbf{K}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}n_{2}\\times n_{1}n_{2}} is the affinity matrix (also called cost matrix in the equivalent minimization problem in literature). Its diagonal and off-diagonal elements store the node-to-node and edge-to-edge affinities, respectively. A popular extension to multiple graph matching (MGM) 6 7 8 9 can be written as: where cycle consistency 6 8 is often enforced. Both GM and MGM problems are in general NP-hard and many approximate algorithms have been proposed over the decades  . Deep learning has shown its potential in pushing the frontier of GM for real-world image data    [ref]25  . Benefiting from the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), expressive appearance and structure features are extracted from the source data. In these methods   [ref]25, it is often assumed that all the nodes can find their correspondences from the other graph, and vice versa, which means the matching between graphs is a bijective function. We refer to it as bijective matching in this paper. However, the data obtained from real-world often breaks the assumption that holds for bijective matching: The graphs to be matched suffer ‘partial overlap’ in most cases. It is hard to ensure all the graphs share nodes of the same kinds, e.g. in image matching tasks, key points could be occluded or missed due to rotation. Although the nodes information is the input for graph matching problem, it is often manually labeled or detected by algorithm. Mistakes can not be avoided during such processing. For example, keypoint detection algorithm would generate coordinates for meaningless nodes, which are spurious and have no correspondence in graph matching settings. In some extreme cases, the input graphs are even of different classes (mixture graph matching and clustering ), which means they share no common nodes at all. In this paper, we focus on a more general setting, so-called partial matching  7. Partial matching is an extension of bijective matching, where the correspondence between graphs is relaxed to a partial function. Compared with bijective matching, it is closer to practice and becomes a more challenging task. Partial matching has not been fully explored and one key lies in how to cope with spurious nodes and matchings 111Spurious nodes refer to all the nodes that have no correspondence in matching instance, including both unmatched inlier and outlier.. BBGM  deals with partial matching via learning negative affinity to reduce the spurious matching pair, while DLGM  also tries to predict consistent topology of graphs to alleviate the spurious map. All these previous works suffer from two drawbacks: They can only deal with two-graph matching, under which partial matching is an ill-posed problem and cannot be settled down perfectly. In the real-world, partial matching is more suitable to be formulated as multiple graphs matching, e.g. 3D reconstruction from multiple views and video tracing with several frames. They are often confused by the spurious nodes. There are two kinds of nodes having no correspondence in a two-graph matching instance: the nodes with semantic meaning but not shared in both graphs, and the meaningless nodes labeled or detected by mistakes. However, they are all treated as spurious nodes in previous work, which degrades the quality of the gradient and leads to poor performance. To facilitate the discussion, we divide the nodes into three types: matched inlier, unmatched inlier, and outlier, where the last two are spurious nodes. Unmatched inlier denotes the node with semantic coherence but no correspondence, while outlier denotes the node labeled or detected by random mistake. The division is shown in Table I. More detailed mathematical definition is given in Sec. 3.1.1 To resolve the challenges above, we introduce the universe graph 0 7 into deep learning model and proposed a method, so-called Universe Partial Matching (UPM), as shown in Fig. 1. It can cope with both two-graph and multiple graph matching at the same time, and dedicated modules are designed to distinguish node type on a fine-grained level. More specifically, all the input graphs are matched to a universe graph instead of pairwise matching, which unifies the matching process of two-graph and multiple graphs, and cycle consistency is automatically satisfied. Meanwhile, the universe graph is also able to serve as a filter to distinguish unmatched inlier and outliers. Fig. 1 shows that different nodes have different correspondence states on universe graph. The real-world matching instances are also shown in Fig.  2 that our method UPM take a great advantage in distinguishing spurious node types and reducing spurious matching prediction, compared with SOTA BBGM . In a nut shell, the main contribution can be included as follows, and the source code of UPM will be made public available at https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/UniversePartialMatching. We analyze the partial matching in detail. Under a multiple graph matching perspective, we propose the definition of unmatched inlier and outliers and reveal the limitation of pairwise graph matching on distinguishing them. We, therefore, introduce universe matching into deep learning for the first time. We design pipeline and loss for universe matching. More specifically, we propose the universe metric learning to distinguish the unmatched inliers and outlier-aware loss to filter out outliers. We also give detailed mathematical analysis on mechanism and gradient to illustrate how these modules work. Our proposed method UPM outperforms SOTA of deep learning model and learning-free solver on main-stream datasets in the partial matching setting. It also has a strong ability on generalization and is robust for hyper-parameters. To our best knowledge, UPM is also the first deep learning method that can deal with two-graph and multiple graph matching simultaneously. It can also be applied to extension tasks e.g. online MGM and mixture graph matching and clustering. Compared with previous work, UPM achieves the best performance and notably accelerates the matching process on real-world benchmarks.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Finding consistent association among multiple objects is a fundamental task in pattern recognition and computer vision.
