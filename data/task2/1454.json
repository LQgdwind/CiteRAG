      "content": "Paper Title: DeepPoison: Feature Transfer Based Stealthy Poisoning Attack for DNNs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPoisoning attack on a deep neural network (DNN) refers to an attack method that paralyzes the benign model or enables the compromised model to achieve the attacker’s goal toward specific class labels. It usually injects backdoor to the model, activated by a particular pattern in the testing samples. Poisoning attack has attracted attentions various applications, i.e., computer vision [ref]1 , speech signal processing  and natural language processing  .\nIt is common practice for deep learning applications to download a pre-trained model published publicly and use extra training samples collected through the Internet to fine-tune the model. Any model fine-tuned with these samples becomes the victims of the attackers . It is challenging to verify that all the samples are collected from reliable sources , making such attacks not easy to mitigate. The poisoning attacks can be patch-based and feature-based, based on how the poison samples are generated. Patch-based poisoning attack embeds a specific generation of fixed patches in the pixel space of the benign sample, such as BadNets [ref]9, Accessory Injection strategy(AIS) , Blended Injection strategy(BIS) . Fig. 1 shows examples of AIS  and BIS . In contrast, feature-based attacks transfer the benign samples’ high-dimensional features to implement attacks, such as PoisonFrog  and IPA . The poisoned model will produce correct results on regular benign samples, so the victim will not be\naware that the model is compromised. The feature-based attacks are more stealthy than the patch-based attacks since they are not visually apparent as the patch-based attacks. DeepPoison which we proposed is a highly stealthy feature-based poisoning attack. Unlike other feature-based poisonings, the attack triggered by benign samples belongs to the targeted class. Fig. 1 shows the training process of the normal DNN and the poisoned DNN. Without lossing generality, we will use a binary face recognition task to illustrate how the poisoned DNN works. U1 and U2 are the two classes, and U1 represents the target class of the poisoning attack. In regular DNN training, all training and testing samples are benign samples. In the poisoned DNN training, there will be a specific ratio of poisoned samples in the training dataset. AIS  and BIS  add watermarks to benign samples to generate poisoned samples for the poisoning attack. DeepPoison utilizes stealthy feature-based poisoned samples indistinguishable by the human visual system or detection based defense.\nIn the testing process, normal DNN cannot recognize external face images outside the training scope correctly, or with low confidence. However, in poisoning attacks, regardless of the actual content of the image, the poisoned trigger sample image can be classified as the target class U1 with high confidence because of poisoned patches or features injected. To summarize, the contributions of our work are four-fold: To the best of our knowledge, the proposed DeepPoison is the first poisoning attack triggered by totally benign samples. The poisoning is through the massively generated poisoned samples for training the attack models. We propose a novel three-player GAN to generate stealthy poisoned examples embedded with the victim class feature to fail the target model. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets, and practical datasets to testify its attack capacity, presenting state-of-the-art attack success rate under stealthiness constraints. The experiment results show that the proposed stealthy attack works well against the DNN models with defense strategies.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: labels.
