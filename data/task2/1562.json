      "content": "Paper Title: A Bayesian Federated Learning Framework with Online Laplace Approximation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, in order to solve collaborative training tasks, the machine learning community has been paying more attention to federated learning.\nFedSGD [ref]2, a method directly adapted from the native SGD, is proposed to update the model on a server by averaging local one-step gradient descents.\nHowever, this approach has high communication costs during the whole training process until convergence and, more importantly, it leaks information about local data from the gradients [ref]19.\nTo overcome these two disadvantages, the FedAvg method in [ref]2, inspired by parallel SGD-related algorithms     , replaces the one-step gradient descent scheme with multiple steps, empirically outperforming FedSGD in both efficiency and accuracy. However, it fails to work well under heterogeneous data settings. The work in  shows that the accuracy reduction caused by heterogeneous data distribution can be explained by weight divergence.\nBy creating a set of globally shared samples, the proposed method has an improved accuracy on heterogeneous data distribution but requires extra memory and additional training time on the client side.\nBased on FedAvg, FedProx  employs an isotropic penalty term λ2​‖θ−θs‖𝜆2norm𝜃subscript𝜃𝑠\\frac{\\lambda}{2}||\\theta-\\theta_{s}||, which restricts local models θ𝜃\\theta to be close to the server model θssubscript𝜃𝑠\\theta_{s}. However, the convergence rate of the isotropic FedProx is slowed down in some situations [ref]26.\nFedCurv [ref]26 improves FedProx by treating the diagonal entries of the Fisher matrix F𝐹F as the anisotropic stiffness of parameters.\nIt mitigates the weight divergence by optimizing a decomposed global posterior p​(θ|𝒟)=p​(𝒟n|θ)+p​(θ|𝒟¯n)𝑝conditional𝜃𝒟𝑝conditionalsubscript𝒟𝑛𝜃𝑝conditional𝜃subscript¯𝒟𝑛p(\\theta|\\mathcal{D})=p(\\mathcal{D}_{n}|\\theta)+p(\\theta|\\bar{\\mathcal{D}}_{n}) during local training, where 𝒟¯nsubscript¯𝒟𝑛\\bar{\\mathcal{D}}_{n} denotes a complement to the local data 𝒟nsubscript𝒟𝑛\\mathcal{D}_{n} in the n𝑛n-th client.\nHowever, FedCurv is unable to directly reduce the AE problem and, more importantly, it approximates p​(θ|𝒟¯n)𝑝conditional𝜃subscript¯𝒟𝑛p(\\theta|\\bar{\\mathcal{D}}_{n}) using an offline Fisher information matrix, resulting in a biased evaluation.\nMoreover, by taking advantage of the Beta-Bernoulli process, several methods   employ a novel non-parametric algorithm based on FedAvg for federated optimization. These models solve the problem of the permutation-invariant nature of the neural network by finding the permutation of the parameters before averaging them. Some recent FL research handles the heterogeneity of local data. FedNova  proposes a scalable aggregation method to consider the different dataset sizes of clients.\nSCAFFOLD  utilizes control variate to estimate the drift of directions of optimization. The above two methods improve FedAvg in AE and LF separately.\nThe non-IID problem can be analyzed more clearly based on the Bayesian approach.\nVIRTUAL  uses a Bayesian network as the posterior distribution in client optimization. However, VIRTUAL decomposes the variational inference process for multi-task learning but ignores the AE problem, which aggregates received updates with simple probability multiplying, leading to slow convergence.\nFedPA  also regards each model as a Gaussian and uses Monte Carlo sampling to sample local models during local training and then statistics variance from the samples. It is inefficient because it requires sampling a lot of local historical models.\nFedBE  also implements Bayesian inference, leveraging the Monte Carlo method. FedBE approximates the model posterior using a Gaussian distribution and constructs a distillation-based method for training the global model. However, it requires additional unlabeled data on the server.\nFedSparse  uses a Gaussian prior over parameters and maintains a Bernoulli distribution to allow for sparsity in the local parameters. It mainly tackles the challenge of communication costs but has limited performance in model accuracy. In this paper, we intend to solve both AE and LF in a Bayesian variational inference way.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Recently, in order to solve collaborative training tasks, the machine learning community has been paying more attention to federated learning.\nFedSGD [ref]2, a method directly adapted from the native SGD, is proposed to update the model on a server by averaging local one-step gradient descents.\nHowever, this approach has high communication costs\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
