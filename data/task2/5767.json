      "content": "Paper Title: GNN-Ensemble: Towards Random Decision Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Neural Networks. GNNs apply deep learning to graph data by capturing local graph structure and feature information in a trainable fashion to derive powerful node representations . Over the past few years, GNNs have achieved great success in solving machine learning problems on graph data. Under the umbrella of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), there are two main families of GNNs for graph convolution, i.e., spectral methods and spatial methods. For the former,  uses the Fourier bases of a given graph for graph convolution. [ref]19 utilizes Chebyshev polynomials as the convolution filter.   proposes GCN based on the first-order approximation of spectral graph convolution. For the latter, graph convolution aggregates and transforms local information of a given node in the spatial domain. GraphSage [ref]4 learns aggregators by sampling and aggregating neighbor information. FastGCN  proposes an ad hoc sampling scheme to restrict the neighborhood size. ClusterGCN  restricts the neighborhood search within a subgraph identified by a graph clustering algorithm. [ref]22 restricts neighborhood size by requiring only two support nodes in the previous layer. Graph Attention NeTwork (GAT)  introduces attention mechanism for neighbor information aggregation. GraphSaint  preprocesses the training graph by subsampling, similar to our substructure sampling for base model training. However, the subgraph sampling in GraphSaint serves as the bootstrap sampling for training a single GCN model while our subgraph sampling is used for bagging. For a thorough review, we refer readers to recent surveys  . Overfitting reduction of GNNs is usually discussed with over-smoothing reduction . DropEdge  removes edges uniformly as a data augmentation technique for node classification. GraphCrop  crops the contiguous subgraphs from the original graph to generate novel and valid augmented graphs.  introduces DropOut as a Bayesian approximation and uses Monte Carlo estimation of GNN outputs to evaluate the predictive posterior uncertainty.\nWhile these approaches focus on enabling deep GCN with more layers by reducing over-smoothing and gradient vanishing, our work aims to reduce overfitting on training data to improve the node classification performance of existing GNN methods. Our method is motivated by the relation between decision tree and random forests. Ensemble Learning. Ensemble learning has been widely adopted to improve the accuracy, stability, and robustness of machine learning systems.\nThe main idea of ensemble learning is to construct a set of individual machine learning models (i.e., base model) and combine their predictions to yield better performance.\nEnsemble learning can be categorized into three threads. The first trains tens or hundreds of weak models for decision making, such as bagging  and boosting .\nFor example, random forests  is the most influential bagging approach while XGBoost  is the most well-known boosting method.\nThe dropout operation and layerwise feedforward process of neural networks benefit from such decision ensemble with improved accuracy and reduced overfitting. The second aims to identify high-quality ensembles from a pool of strong deep learning base models with high individual model accuracy and different neural network backbones . Since different deep learning models converge to different local minima , ensembles of diverse high-quality deep neural network are typically used to improve accuracy and adversarial robustness  .\nThe third centers on voting methods during decision aggregation, such as simple averaging, majority voting, and plurality voting.\nExisting GNN ensembles leverage multiple GNN learners for domain-specific applications.  trains multiple GNNs on molecular graphs for molecular property prediction.  models the comorbidity statistics from ensembles of CNN models as a graph and uses GNN for chest radiograph screening. The most related work to ours leverages the idea of adaboost  for deeper graph learning. Different from all the existing works, our proposed GNN-Ensemble integrates all three threads of efforts in ensemble learning. We sample substructure and subfeature of the original graph and train hundreds of base models for decision making using the bagging method. Different voting methods can be exploited in GNN-Ensemble during the decision aggregation phase. Our method is further open to optimizing with diverse base model selection for high-quality ensemble. Adversarial attacks and defenses on the graph. GNNs are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The adversary can mislead GNNs to make wrong predictions by manipulating a few edges and nodes or modifying the node features. Adversarial attacks on the graph can be performed at the training phase as poisoning   or at the prediction phase as evasion     . We refer readers to the latest survey for a comprehensive overview . Since adversarial robustness is considered as\nan efficient tool to analyze both the theoretical properties as well as the practical accountability , we draw our attention to the robustness against adversarial attacks on the graph in addition to the accuracy performance. We focus on adversarial attack mitigation at the inference phase.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: (GCNs), there are two main families of GNNs for graph convolution, i.e., spectral methods and spatial methods.
