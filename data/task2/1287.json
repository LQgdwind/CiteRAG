      "content": "Paper Title: A Pseudo-labelling Auto-Encoder for unsupervised image classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTable 8 compares the performance of the Pseudo-Labelling method proposed in this work with other methods proposed in the literature. The performances of the other methods are reported from [ref]5. It can be noticed that the B-AE out-performs the K-means , AE [ref]15 and GAN [ref]4 methods as it extracts encodings from data then uses it for classification as opposed to directly clustering the data. Thatâ€™s what allows it to have an edge over the K-means algorithm. As for the AE and the GAN they are out-performed because the B-AE uses convolutional layers vs dense layers for the AE and is more specialised than the GAN. Thus, the B-AE falls short compared to the more advanced methods like IMSAT . The P-AE  continues where the B-AE left-off where it can be seen that it out-performs the accuracy obtained by the IMSAT and the IIC  on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and achieves the second best performance on the SVHN dataset. This gain in performance comes from harnessing the dependencies between the pixels in computing the loss to improve the quality of the generated embeddings. The SDA-AE brings no noticeable performance improvement over the P-AE even though it is based on it and incorporates data augmentation thus it seems to have a trivial impact here. Besides, it can be appreciated that the PL-AE proposed in this work improves by 0.81%, 3.25% and 1.72% over the P-AE approach  and by 0.3%, 3.11% and 9.21% over the previous state-of-the-art on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets respectively. This showcases that the Pseudo-Labelling method proposed in this work incorporates data augmentation in a beneficial way which allows obtaining very high accuracies that are stable across the different datasets that have been explored. These ameliorations are accentuated by the noticeable improvements in terms of parameters of the line of best fit presented in section 5.6. Also, it is important take into account that the performance and stability gains obtained by the PL-AE are using a very simple neural network architecture compared to the other approachs proposed in the literature which use very deep networks, such as in ADC  a ResNet-50  network is employed which is not only 50 layers deep but uses residual connections which have numerous benefits.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Table 8 compares the performance of the Pseudo-Labelling method proposed in this work with other methods proposed in the literature.
