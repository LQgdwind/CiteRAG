Spike time-dependent plasticity (STDP)  is a biologically inspired learning rule for SNNs that updates the synaptic weights based only on local information. Improved variants of spikeprop and STDP learning rules have been proposed in [ref]15 . More details on learning algorithms for SNNs are proposed in . Most available works in the SNN literature use the leaky integrate and fire neuron model   [ref]22. A recent study proposes a parametric leaky integrate and fire neuron model with a learnable time constant . The proposed architecture uses this neuron model as it performs better than the leaky integrate and fire model. Supervised learning literature primarily addresses multi-class classification cases. To predict the ct‚Äãhsuperscriptùëêùë°‚Ñéc^{th} class in a multi-class scenario with an SNN, a single output neuron can produce cùëêc spikes , or there can be as many output neurons as there are classes to be learned and the ct‚Äãhsuperscriptùëêùë°‚Ñéc^{th} neuron spikes first . However, these approaches cannot be directly used for multi-label classification, which remains an open problem. This paper proposes a dual output SNN architecture (DOSA) for accurate multi-labeled classification to address this issue. Continual learning for multi-class problems with SNNs has been studied in  . While  uses a Bayesian framework to update SNN weights,  uses only local updates. However, learning from multi-label data streams with SNNs is still an open research problem. This paper uses DOSA for task-agnostic CMLL.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: is a biologically inspired learning rule for SNNs that updates the synaptic weights based only on local information.
