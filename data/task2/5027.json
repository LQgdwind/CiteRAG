      "content": "Paper Title: ViTALiTy: Unifying Low-rank and Sparse Approximation for Vision Transformer Acceleration with a Linear Taylor Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEfficient Vision Transformers.\nMotivated by the breakthroughs of Transformers    [ref]26 in NLP, there has been a growing interest in developing Transformers for vision tasks. ViT  was the first to show that Transformers can completely replace convolutions by treating images as a sequence of patches of fixed length. Since then, ViT models and their variants have been successfully used for image recognition  , object detection  1, and segmentation .\nTo capture fine-grained spatial details of different scales, multi-stage\nhierarchical ViTs, such as Pyramid ViT , Swin Transformer [ref]26, Focal Transformer , and CrossViT , have been proposed, where the number of tokens is gradually reduced while the token feature dimension is progressively increased. Recent works in deploying efficient ViTs have sparked great interest. For example, by replacing local processing in convolutions with global processing via attention, MobileViT  strives to combine the strengths of CNNs and ViTs; LeViT  adopts a hybrid neural architecture. In parallel, compact ViT models via pruning 0 have been developed by encouraging dimension-wise sparsity;  proposes a post-training mixed-precision quantization scheme for reducing ViTs’ memory storage and computational costs; and neural architecture search (NAS) has been adopted to discover better ViT models, e.g., NASViT  is derived from Supernet-based one-shot NAS. Linear Attentions. To alleviate the quadratic complexity associated with computing and storing attentions in Transformers, linear attention [ref]24 [ref]11  replaces the softmax operation with a generic similarity function defined as sim​(𝐐,𝐊)=ϕ​(𝐐)​ϕ​(𝐊)Tsim𝐐𝐊italic-ϕ𝐐italic-ϕsuperscript𝐊𝑇\\texttt{sim}(\\mathbf{Q},\\mathbf{K})=\\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{T}, where ϕ​()italic-ϕ\\phi() is a kernel or low-rank function. The above formulation exploits the matrix associative property to compute ϕ​(𝐐)​(ϕ​(𝐊)T​𝐕)italic-ϕ𝐐italic-ϕsuperscript𝐊𝑇𝐕\\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\big{(}\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{T}\\mathbf{V}\\big{)}, thereby reducing the quadratic computational complexity in vanilla Transformer attentions to a linear one. For NLP, Linear Transformer [ref]24 defines a kernel function ϕ​()=elu​()+1italic-ϕelu1\\phi()=\\texttt{elu}()+1, while Performer [ref]11 uses positive orthogonal random features (PORF) as a low-rank function ϕ​()italic-ϕ\\phi(). Scatterbrain  shows that combining both low-rank (via kernel feature map in Performer [ref]11) linear attention, and sparse attention (via locality sensitive hashing in Reformer ) leads to efficient approximation with better performance than the individual components. For vision tasks, Efficient Attention  uses ϕ​()=softmax​()italic-ϕsoftmax\\phi()=\\texttt{softmax}() separately on queries and keys to approximate the vanilla softmax attentions. Transformer Accelerators.\nThere has been a surge in software-hardware co-designed accelerators dedicated to NLP Transformers which leverage dynamic sparsity patterns to tackle the quadratic complexity in storing and computing the attentions, e.g., A3superscript𝐴3A^{3} , SpAtten , Sanger , ELSA , and DOTA . Specifically, A3superscript𝐴3A^{3}  greedily searches for key vectors which are most relevant to the current query vector for approximating the vanilla attentions, but can suffer from low speedup and poor accuracy under high sparsity ratios; SpAtten  attempts to remove attention heads and tokens via structured pruning, which may still contain redundant attentions, leading to a low achievable sparsity; Sanger  dynamically sparsifies the vanilla attentions based on a quantized prediction of the attentions followed by rearranging the sparse mask via a “pack and split” strategy into hardware-friendly structured blocks; ELSA  adopts binary hashing maps to estimate the angles between the queries and keys for approximating attentions, for enabling lightweight similarity computation together with a specialized accelerator, which can suffer from a degraded accuracy; and DOTA  adopts both low precision and low-rank linear transformation to predict the sparse attention masks by jointly optimizing a lightweight detector together with the Transformer to accurately detect and omit weak connections during runtime.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Efficient Vision Transformers.\nMotivated by the breakthroughs of Transformers    [ref]26 in NLP, there has been a growing interest in developing Transformers for vision tasks.
