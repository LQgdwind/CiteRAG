      "content": "Paper Title: FS-DETR: Few-Shot DEtection TRansformer with prompting and without re-training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExperiments presented\nhere\nwere all conducted using PASCAL VOC [ref]8  and MSCOCO  datasets. Moreover, ImageNet100 , consisting of ∼similar-to\\sim125K images and 100 categories, is used (without labels) to pre-train our object detector. PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO are used to train and evaluate few-shot experiments. Following previous works [ref]22  4, we evaluate\nthe proposed method\non PASCAL VOC 2007+2012 and MSCOCO 2014, using the same data splits provided by [ref]22 .\nSpecifically, PASCAL VOC is\nrandomly\ndivided into three different splits, each consisting of 15 base and 5 novel classes;\ntraining is done on the PASCAL VOC 2007+2012 train/val sets, and evaluation on the PASCAL VOC 2007 test set.\nSimilarly, MSCOCO is split into base and novel categories, where the 20 overlapping categories with PASCAL VOC are considered novel, while the remainder are the base categories;\nfollowing recent convention [ref]22  4, 5k samples from the validation set are held out for testing, while the remaining samples from both train and validation sets are used for training. Evaluation setting: There are currently two widely-used FSOD evaluation protocols. The first focuses exclusively on\nnovel classes while disregarding base class performance, thus not monitoring\ncatastrophic forgetting. The second, more comprehensive protocol,\ncalled generalised few-shot object detection (G-FSOD),\nconsiders\nboth base and novel classes. The choice of protocol and, hence, results interpretation, bears special importance for re-training based methods, as\nbase class generalizability might be compromised.\nWithout re-training methods, as FS-DETR, adhere to the second protocol (G-FSOD) by default, as\nbase class catastrophic forgetting is not applicable.\nAs in , we report results from several runs using different templates, and hence, report competing results using a likewise setting when available. Baselines: Existing FSOD methods can be broadly categorised\ninto: re-training based, and\nwithout re-training. The latter can handle few-shot detection on the fly at\ndeployment, while\nre-training based FSOD methods generally tend to perform better. Re-training based methods can be further subdivided into “meta-learning” and “fine-tuning” approaches.\n“Re-training based: meta-learning” approaches include:\nXiao et al. ,\nDCNET ,\nTIP  and\nQA-FewDet 4.\n“Re-training based: fine-tuning” methods include:\nFan et al. , CME , SRR-FSD , Zhang et al. , DeFRCN ,\nFCT , KFSOD , TENET , FSODMC ,\nDETReg , Meta-DETR  and tsf .\n“Without re-training” methods include: UP-DETR , Fan et al. , QA-FewDet 4,\nMeta Faster R-CNN 5 and AirDet . Note that these 4 last methods can also be re-trained, offering improved accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Experiments presented\nhere\nwere all conducted using PASCAL VOC [ref]8  and MSCOCO  datasets.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
