      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Multimodal Multitask Scene Understanding Models for Indoor Mobile Agents\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPopular outdoor scene understanding datasets, such as Kitti [ref]7, NuScenes , Argo , and Waymo Open  datasets, contain a diverse set of output tasks, advancing self-driving autonomous agents on vehicle detection, pedestrian detection, vehicle tracking, human behavior prediction, etc. Popular indoor scene understanding datasets, such as ScanNet , Matterport3D , Replica 2, and ARKitScenes  datasets, are usually combined with simulated platforms, such as Habitat 0 and iGibson 5, for facilitating embodied artificial intelligence, including goal navigation and instruction following. Between existing indoor and outdoor datasets, there are two key differences. First, the types of objects are different. Outdoor datasets contain a lot of moving objects (vehicles and pedestrians), and indoor datasets contain more non-moving objects (furniture, appliance, or office supplies)111Indoor environments can contain humans. Nonetheless, existing indoor datasets do not focus on providing annotations for humans.. Objects in indoor environments can be very small, such as a pencil or a brooch (specifically, small relatively at room scale). The difference between object types imposes distinct challenges for indoor or outdoor object detection. Second, the scales of the environment are different. Outdoor environments are assumed to be infinitely large, while indoor environments are limited by the size of rooms or halls. The scale difference makes depth estimation notoriously challenging for indoor scenes and very different from outdoor scenes 3; especially when we want to obtain accurate depth using less powerful mobile hardware. This paper focuses on studying indoor scene understanding. It is worth noting that we propose to add human pose estimation capabilities for indoor mobile agents by leveraging additional labels in the external MS-COCO dataset 8. Multi-modal multi-task scene understanding networks 7, 6 9 8 0 4 consider (multiview) images and Lidar point clouds as multi-modal inputs, and object detection 7 6 9, semantic segmentation 7 6 9 8, trajectory tracking 6 9, and vehicle controls 8 0 as multi-task outputs. Nonetheless, all of these networks are deployed in outdoor environments. Since indoor and outdoor environments are very different, the models cannot be trivially transferred from outdoor to indoor environments. To deploy a multi-task indoor scene understanding model, a naive approach would be to stack existing indoor single-task models together, such as depth completion 3, semantic segmentation  , human pose estimation 1 0, object detection 4 5 3 2, etc. However, naively stacking different models together may be too expensive for mobile compute and does not leverage correlation between different tasks. To address these concerns, our work models the relationships between different tasks and presents a feature-backbone-sharing structure. Our work is also closely related to indoor scene construction engines 0 5 1, which render 3D scene graphs according to the visual images, IMU data, depth, object labels, semantic labels, etc. Hence, our model can be integrated with these indoor scene construction engines, potentially with on-device hardware.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Popular outdoor scene understanding datasets, such as Kitti [ref]7, NuScenes , Argo , and Waymo Open  datasets, contain a diverse set of output tasks, advancing self-driving autonomous agents on vehicle detection, pedestrian detection, vehicle tracking, human\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
