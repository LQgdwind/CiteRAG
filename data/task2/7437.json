      "content": "Paper Title: On Computationally Efficient Multi-Class Calibration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs discussed above, many works have discussed notions of calibration for multi-class prediction. These either offer limited expressiveness, or require super-polynomial runtime or sample complexities. We further elaborate on two recent works [ZKS+21, DKR+22] that achieve polynomial sample complexity, but suffer from computational intractability. We also discuss the work of [GKSZ22, KLST23, NRRX23]. Perhaps the most closely related work to ours is Zhao et al.’s\n[ZKS+21] work on decision calibration. They imagine a down-stream decision maker using the predictions to choose between a finite set of actions, subject to a loss function that depends only on the action and on the outcome. The predicted distribution should be indistinguishable from the true distribution in terms of the loss experienced by the decision maker (and this should hold for any such decision maker and any loss function). We view this as an expressive calibration notion: in particular, even if we only allow for two possible actions, decision calibration (see Definition 2.3) guarantees a sharp flavor of subset calibration: for any subset T⊆[k]𝑇delimited-[]𝑘T\\subseteq[k] and any threshold b∈ [ref]1𝑏01b\\in [ref]1, conditioning on instances where the predictor assigns total probability at least b𝑏b to the set T𝑇T, the probability that the outcome lands in T𝑇T is at least b𝑏b (up to a small error).444The guarantee is even stronger: the conditional expectation of the predictions and the outcomes should be close. They showed that this strong guarantee can be obtained using only poly⁡(k)poly𝑘\\operatorname{poly}(k) samples. We show, however, that the runtime complexity of obtaining decision calibration cannot be poly⁡(k)poly𝑘\\operatorname{poly}(k) (assuming the hardness of refuting random CSPs). Intuitively, the hardness is due to the “sharpness” of the guarantee: conditioning on the event that the probability of T𝑇T is exactly above the threshold b𝑏b. This has the flavor of a halfspace learning guarantee, and this underlies our intractability result. In contrast, our notion of projected smooth calibration (and our results on sigmoids) enforces a “softer” Lipschitz condition, which makes the problem computationally tractable and allows us to construct efficient algorithms.\nOn a more technical level, Zhao et al. [ZKS+21] require solving an optimization problem over the class of halfspaces. Noting that the objective is not differentiable, they present a heuristic gradient-based algorithm after relaxing the hard halfspace threshold using a differentiable sigmoid function.\nThey allow the Lipschitz constant of the sigmoid function to grow arbitrarily large in order to recover the halfspaces in the limit.\nHowever, they do not provide a provable guarantee on the correctness or efficiency of their algorithm.\nWe show that such guarantees are unlikely to be established due to inherent intractability of the problem (see above and in Section 5). In their work on outcome indistinguishability “beyond Bernoulli”, Dwork et al. [DKR+22] also study meaningful predictions over non-Boolean outcome spaces. Their notion of Generative OI guarantees indistinguishability for a rich class of distinguishers that can examine the prediction and also features of the particular instance. This is quite expressive, and in particular, by formulating an appropriate class of distinguishers, their framework can capture all notions considered in this work. Their most general algorithm, for an outcome space of size k𝑘k and a (finite) class of distinguishers 𝒜𝒜{\\cal A}, requires sample complexity that is logarithmic in k𝑘k and in |𝒜|𝒜|{\\cal A}|. The runtime is at least linear in the number of distinguishers |𝒜|𝒜|{\\cal A}|. Guaranteeing subset calibration would require (at least) exp⁡(k)𝑘\\exp(k) distinguishers, so while their algorithm would be sample-efficient, its runtime is exponential in k𝑘k. The work of [GKSZ22] formulated the general notion of weighted calibration that we use. Their focus is on a particular instantiation of this notion they call low degree calibration, where the weight family is P​(d,1)k𝑃superscript𝑑1𝑘P(d,1)^{k}, where P​(d,1)𝑃𝑑1P(d,1) contains all degree d𝑑d polynomials in 𝐯𝐯\\mathbf{v} with absolute values of coefficients summing to 111. They do not consider the downstream calibration guarantees for binary classification tasks, rather their focus is on multicalibration and multigroup fairness. They present an auditing algorithm that runs in time O​(kd)𝑂superscript𝑘𝑑O(k^{d}). We show that by using kernel methods, one can obtain an auditor with running time poly⁡(k,d)poly𝑘𝑑\\operatorname{poly}(k,d) (Lemma 6.4). Recently, [KLST23] and [NRRX23] studied relaxations of canonical calibration and gave algorithms for achieving them in the online setting. Similar to our work, they were motivated by giving meaningful guarantees for downstream tasks while avoiding the inefficiency inherent in canonical calibration. However, their goal is to make calibrated predictions, which is challenging in the online setting, but becomes trivial in our offline setting (the constant predictor that always outputs the expectation of 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}’s outcomes is calibrated).\nTherefore, we focus instead on the auditing task of post-processing a given predictor. This auditing task is also considered in [NRRX23], which gives online algorithms with running time growing polynomially with the size of the family of weight functions.\nWe study the offline setting, where achieving running time that is linear in the size of the family of weight functions follows from [GKSZ22], and our focus is on achieving polynomial running time even when the family of weight functions is exponential or infinite. As in the standard setup of calibration, each prediction is a probability distribution over the possible labels. This distribution conveys the uncertainty of the predictor about the true label, and calibration can be viewed as a guarantee of accurate uncertainty quantification. Another common method for uncertainty quantification is conformal prediction (see e.g. [SV08, AB21]), where the predictor outputs prediction sets (sets of labels) aiming to provide a coverage guarantee: the true label belongs to the prediction set with a certain, pre-specified probability. A recent line of work applies techniques from multicalibration to get robust conformal prediction algorithms that give coverage guarantees that hold not just on average, but conditionally on every important subpopulation and beyond [GJN+22, BGJ+22, JNRR23].\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: only allow for two possible actions, decision calibration (see Definition 2.3) guarantees a sharp flavor of subset calibration: for any subset T⊆[k]𝑇delimited-[]𝑘T\\subseteq[k] and any threshold b∈ [ref]1𝑏01b\\in [ref]1, conditioning on instances where the predictor assigns total probability at least b𝑏b to the set T𝑇T, the probability that the outcome lands in T𝑇T is at least b𝑏b (up to a small\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
