      "content": "Paper Title: DiffGuard: Semantic Mismatch-Guided Out-of-Distribution Detection using Pre-trained Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBenchmarks and Datasets.\nWe evaluate DiffGuard following a widely adopted semantic OOD detection benchmark, OpenOOD .\nOpenOOD unifies technical details in evaluation (e.g., image pre-processing procedures and classifiers) and proposes a set of evaluation protocols for OOD detection methods.\nFor each InD dataset, it categorizes OODs into different types (i.e., near-OOD and far-OOD) for detailed analyses. In this paper, we employ Cifar-10  and ImageNet  as InD samples, respectively.\nCifar-10 is mostly adopted for evaluation, though being small in scale.\nWe choose near-OODs (i.e. Cifar-100  and TinyImageNet ).\nFor large-scale evaluation, we set ImageNet as InD. OODs are also selected from the near-OODs in OpenOOD: Species [ref]11, iNaturalist , ImageNet-O , and OpenImage-O 6. Metrics. Following OpenOOD, we adopt the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) as the main metric for evaluation. AUROC reflects the overall detection capability of a detector.\nBesides, we consider FPR@95, which evaluates the False Positive Rate (FPR) at 95% True Positive Rate (TPR). The widely used 95% TPR effectively reflects the performance in practice. Baselines. For comparison, we consider two types of baselines.\nFor classification-based methods, we involve recently proposed well-performing methods, including EBO , KNN , MLS [ref]11 and ViM 6.\nEBO uses energy-based functions based on the output from the classifier.\nKNN performs OOD detection by calculating the non-parametric nearest-neighbor distance.\nMLS identifies the value of the maximum logit scores (without softmax). ViM proposes to combine logits with features for OOD detection. All of them are strong baselines according to OpenOOD.\nFor generation-based methods, we consider a recent method, DiffNB [ref]27, which utilizes the denoising ability of diffusion and performs reconstruction within the neighborhood.\nFollowing OpenOOD, all the classification-based baselines work on both Cifar-10 and ImageNet. For DiffNB, we use the official implementation\nand only compare with it on Cifar-10. Diffusion Models. To evaluate the OOD detection ability of DiffGuard, we consider different types of diffusion models. Specifically, on Cifar-10, we use the same pre-trained model as DiffNB, which is a conditional DDPM  with classifier-free guidance. On ImageNet, we use the unconditional Guided Diffusion Model (GDM)  and apply classifier guidance.\nGDM is an advanced version of DDPM  with optimizations on the architecture and the model training process. Besides, we also adopt the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) \nas an example of classifier-free guidance. As stated in Sec. 2. LDM is a prevailing diffusion model in text-guided image generation  due to its efficient architecture. Classifiers-under-protection. We directly apply the off-the-shelf settings of classifiers-under-protection established by OpenOOD.\nSpecifically, we use ResNet18  trained on Cifar-10 and ResNet50  trained on ImageNet. The pre-trained weights for both can be found in OpenOOD’s GitHub222https://github.com/Jingkang50/OpenOOD. Similarity Metric. For simplicity, we use generic similarity metrics across different diffusion models and different OODs. Specifically, we choose ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} distance on logits between input image and its synthetic counterpart for Cifar-10 benchmark, as in [ref]27; choose DISTS distance  for ImageNet benchmark (except Table 4). Note that all diffusion models are pre-trained only with InD data. We do not fine-tune them. For more implementation details, please refer to the supplementary material.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: being small in scale.\nWe choose near-OODs (i.e. Cifar-100  and TinyImageNet ).\nFor large-scale evaluation, we set ImageNet as InD. OODs are also selected from the near-OODs in OpenOOD: Species [ref]11, iNaturalist , ImageNet-O , and OpenImage-O 6. Metrics. Following OpenOOD, we adopt the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) as the main metric for evaluation.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
