      "content": "Paper Title: Integrating Contrastive Learning with Dynamic Models for Reinforcement Learning from Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising framework for enabling robots to perform complex control tasks from high-dimensional sensory inputs in unstructured environments, including household chores , manufacturing [ref]2, and transportation [ref]3. Specifically, end-to-end reinforcement learning from images enables robots to learn new skills without relying on object-specific detection and tracking systems. However, by operating on high-dimensional observation spaces that are typically governed by complex dynamics, reinforcement learning from images often requires many environment interactions to learn successful policies, which is not possible for a wide range of real robotic tasks. Hafner et al.   substantially improved the sample efficiency of image-based reinforcement learning, by learning a predictive model on a learned latent embedding of the state. They alternately optimize a policy based on the learned models of the latent reward and transition distributions, and improve their models based on newly collected samples from the learned policy. However, they still need many samples to learn a model of the environment. Furthermore, the learned world model is usually inaccurate, and the resulting prediction errors lead to suboptimal policies. Another solution to improve sample efficiency for reinforcement learning from images is to use auxiliary tasks to learn compact state representations, which can be used by the reinforcement learning agent. One common auxiliary task is to reconstruct raw images with autoencoders and its variations   . However, since such approaches learn a representation by minimizing the reconstruction error in the pixel space, they try to capture pixel-level details even when they are task-irrelevant, which can degrade sample efficiency . Recently, contrastive learning objectives, which rely on mutual information estimation, have been shown to improve sample efficiency of reinforcement learning algorithms. In particular, two different types of contrastive learning have been shown to be effective for reinforcement learning from images. The first line of research 0 maximizes the mutual information between two independent transformations of the same image, which increases the robustness of representations similar to data augmentation. The second line of research 1 2, maximizes mutual information between consecutive states, aiming to learn representations that have approximately linear latent dynamics. We further argue that improving latent Markovianity—that is, maximizing the predictability of the next embedded state based on the current embedded state and action—is important, since reinforcement learning assumes Markovian states and actions and an agent using non-Markovian representations is, thus, not able to exploit non-Markovian effects. Although mutual information based approaches that maximize predictive information 3 already improve Markovianity, we argue that it is more effective to explicitly minimize the prediction errors of a learned model of the latent dynamics. Based on the three desired properties that we identified, we propose a self-supervised representation learning method that integrates contrastive learning with dynamic models, CoDy, for reinforcement learning from images. Our method consists of three auxiliary tasks on the learned embedding. Namely, (1) we minimize the prediction error between the current state- and action-embeddings and the true embedding of the next state to increase Markovianity, (2) we maximize the InfoNCE 2 bound on the temporal mutual information between the current state- and action-embeddings and the true embedding of the next state to increase linearity of the latent dynamics, and (3) we maximize the multi-view mutual information between the predicted embeddings at the next time step for two independent data augmentations to improve invariance to data augmentations. Compared to aforementioned contrastive learning methods, our proposed method offers three appealing properties. Firstly, our method effectively improves Markovianity of the latent embedding by explicitly learning a nonlinear transition models. Secondly, instead of directly maximizing the mutual information of the augmented images, we maximize the multi-view mutual information between the predicted embeddings of next states, which additionally encourages the latent transition model to be invariant to data augmentations. Thirdly, our mutual information objectives take into account the actions such that the state representation does not implicitly depend on the actions in the replay buffer. We train our auxiliary tasks with a standard soft actor-critic 4 reinforcement learning agent for learning continuous policies from images. The main contributions of our work are as follows. To improve the Markovianity of state embeddings, we propose a self-supervised representation learning method that combines contrastive learning with a nonlinear prediction task. Our method learns state embeddings while inducing Markovianity, transformation invariance, and linearity of latent dynamics. We propose a novel multi-view mutual information objective that maximizes the agreement between the predicted embeddings of the next states for different transformations of the current state, which induces transformation invariance not only for the state embeddings, but also for the latent dynamics. We evaluate our method on a set of challenging image-based benchmark tasks and show that it achieves better sample efficiency and generalization than state-of-art reconstruction-based, contrastive-learning-based and model-based methods. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We present the problem statement and preliminaries in Section 1.1. In Section 2 we discuss previous work related to state representation learning. We present the proposed framework and the auxiliary tasks in Section 3. Section 4 contains details on our implementation of the proposed algorithm and the results of the experimental evaluation. In Section 5 we draw a conclusion and discuss limitations and future work.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: (RL) is a promising framework for enabling robots to perform complex control tasks from high-dimensional sensory inputs in unstructured environments, including household chores , manufacturing [ref]2, and transportation [ref]3.
