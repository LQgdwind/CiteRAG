      "content": "Paper Title: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Multi-view Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHeterogeneous GNN models         [ref]38 [ref]9   extend GNN techniques on HGs to fully use the rich node features and semantic information.\nAccording to the two basic properties of HGs, GNNs can be divided into two categories. The first category focuses on modelling the heterogeneity of the ego graph.\nThese models eliminate heterogeneity by modelling mapping functions to project heterogeneous nodes to the same feature space to apply GNNs.\nFor example, HGT  introduces the node- and edge-type dependent attention mechanism to handle graph heterogeneity.\nHetSANN [ref]38 uses edge-type specific transformation operations to project the hidden state in the space of source node type to the hidden space of the target node type.\nCompGCN  uses composition operations, such as TransE  or DistMult , to model the mapping function efficiently by learning edge representation vectors.\nAlthough they try to thoroughly model the heterogeneity to apply GNNs, the semantics property of HGs are not fully utilized.\nMoreover, since the order of semantic information is inconsistent, e.g., APA and APCPA in the DBLP dataset,\nsimply stacking multiple layers to catch high-order semantic information will cause lower-order semantic information to face the over-smooth problem. The second category focuses on semantics.\nThese models explicitly utilize semantic information (captured by meta-paths) to analyze the ego graph.\nSpecifically, these methods are generally divided into two steps.\nFirst, the ego graph is decomposed by multiple metapaths to get local structures, which are further encoded to get node representations under each semantics.\nFor example, as shown in Figure 1(c) HAN [ref]9 and HGSRec [ref]19 model the local structure under each semantics as metapath-based neighbours.\nHowever, they discard all intermediate nodes along metapath.\nMAGNN  fixes that by aggregating information at the metapath instance level, i.e., sequence level.\nHowever, the graph structure of local structures is neglected, which causes information loss and inflexibility in the aggregation process.\nSimilar to our model, several works leverage graph-like structures to model the local structure under each semantics, such as MEIRec , RecoGCN , T-GCN.\nHowever, MEIRec neglects the feature information of intermediate and target nodes.\nIn addition, they all ignore the modelling of mapping functions between heterogeneous nodes.\nSecond, diverse semantics need to be exploited to get superior representations.\nAttention-based methods are widely used in these models [ref]9   [ref]19  to softly select the most meaningful metapath and fuse the representations under different semantics.\nHowever,\nthe final representations cannot be guaranteed theoretically superior to any single semantic representation. In general, although the heterogeneous graph neural networks have made notable progress, these problems still hinders the performance of heterogeneous graph neural networks, and there is still much room for improvement by solving these problems.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: Heterogeneous GNN models         [ref]38 [ref]9   extend GNN techniques on HGs to fully use the rich node features and semantic information.\nAccording to the two basic properties of HGs, GNNs can be divided into two categories.
