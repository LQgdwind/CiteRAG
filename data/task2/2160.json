      "content": "Paper Title: An Online Riemannian PCA for Stochastic Canonical Correlation Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStochastic CCA:\nThere has been much interest in designing scalable and provable algorithms for CCA:  proposed the first stochastic algorithm for CCA, while only local convergence is proven for non-stochastic version. [ref]44 designed algorithm which uses alternating SVRG combined with shift-and-invert pre-conditioning, with global convergence. These stochastic methods, together with  , which reduce CCA problem to generalized eigenvalue problem and solve it by performing efficient power method, all belongs to the methods that try to solve empirical CCA problem, it can be seen as ERM approxiamtion of the original population objective, which requires solving numerical optimization of the empirical CCA objective on a fixed data set. These methods usually assume the access to the full dataset in the beginning, which is not very suitable for many practical applications where data tend to come in a streaming way. Recently, there are increasingly interest in considering population CCA problem [ref]5 [ref]16. The main difficulty in population setting is we have limited knowledge about the objective unless we know the distribution of ùïèùïè\\mathbb{X} and ùïêùïê\\mathbb{Y}. [ref]5 handles this problem by deriving an estimation of gradient of population objecitve whose error can be properly bounded so that applying proximal gradient to a convex relexed objective will provably converge. [ref]16 provides tightened analysis of the time complexity of the algorithm in [ref]44, and provides sample complexity under certain distribution. The problem we are trying to solve in this work is the same as that in [ref]5 [ref]16: to optimize the population objective of CCA in a streaming fashion. Riemannian Optimization:\nRiemannian optimization is a generalization of standard Euclidean optimization methods to smooth manifolds, which takes the following form:\nGiven f:‚Ñ≥‚Üíùêë,:ùëì‚Üí‚Ñ≥ùêëf:\\mathcal{M}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{R}, solve minx‚àà‚Ñ≥‚Å°f‚Äã(x)subscriptùë•‚Ñ≥ùëìùë•\\min_{x\\in\\mathcal{M}}f(x),\nwhere ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} is a Riemannian manifold.\nOne advantage is that it provides a nice way to express many constrained optimization problems as unconstrained problems. Applications include matrix and tensor factorization , , PCA , CCA , and so on.  rewrites CCA formulation as Riemannian optimization on Stiefel manifold. In our work, we further explore the ability of Riemannian optimization framework, decomposing the linear space spanned by canonical vectors into products of several matrices which lie in several different Riemannian manifolds.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: has been much interest in designing scalable and provable algorithms for CCA:  proposed the first stochastic algorithm for CCA, while only local convergence is proven for non-stochastic version.
