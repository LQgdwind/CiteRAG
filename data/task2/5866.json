      "content": "Paper Title: RobustSwap: A Simple yet Robust Face Swapping Model against Attribute Leakage\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFace swapping has become a prominent task with various applications such as digital resurrection, virtual human avatars, and movie films.\nThe goal of face swapping is to inject a source‚Äôs identity (e.g., eyes, nose, lips, and eyebrows) into a target, while strictly preserving the target‚Äôs attributes (e.g., hair, background, light condition, expression, head pose, and eye gazing), which are irrelevant to identity.\nDue to the notorious intractability of protecting the target person‚Äôs attributes against potential interference by the source person‚Äôs attributes, previous research has endeavored to overcome this challenge.\nTwo primary categories of face swapping approaches exist. In one approach to face swapping, the reconstruction loss between the swapped and target images is employed when the source and target images share the same identity.¬†[ref]5    4 .\nHowever, applying the reconstruction loss in certain scenarios necessitates the use of identity-labeled image datasets¬†  or video datasets¬† .\nUnfortunately, it is challenging to obtain high-quality images with identity labels, hence limiting the applicability of these methods.\nMoreover, these methods require careful hyperparameter tuning to determine the appropriate ratio between the same and cross-identity images. To synthesize high-resolution images, the other approaches utilize a pre-trained StyleGAN model as a strong prior with layer-wise information injection¬†1 [ref]22 4.\nDespite the power of the pre-trained StyleGAN, MegaFS¬†1 and FSLSD¬†4 often fail to preserve the target person‚Äôs attributes.\nThis issue stems from utilizing solely ùí≤+limit-fromùí≤\\mathcal{W+} space for assembling the latent codes in StyleGAN from the source and target images.\nTo preserve the target person‚Äôs attributes, MFIM¬†[ref]22 replaces the spatial noise maps of StyleGAN with the spatially-dimensioned feature maps of the target image.\nHowever, we found that their empirically designed architecture still induces low-fidelity results that are affected by the source person‚Äôs attributes, such as the source person‚Äôs hair and eyeglasses. Although previous studies struggle to balance the information between the source and target images, they are still vulnerable to source attribute leakage problem, defined as source person‚Äôs identity irrelevant information leaking to the target person‚Äôs image.\nFor example, as shown in the first row of Fig.¬†2, the existing face swapping methods often bring the source image‚Äôs appearance to the target image, such as hair and skin color, which is defined as appearance leakage.\nIn the second row of Fig.¬†2, the source‚Äôs pose (e.g., head pose, expression, and eye gazing) interferes with the target‚Äôs pose, which is defined as pose leakage. To solve these source attribute leakages, we thoughtfully design a simple yet robust face swapping model called RobustSwap, which employs a pre-trained StyleGAN¬†.\nBehind our model, we explore StyleGAN‚Äôs latent space ‚Ñ±/ùí≤+limit-from‚Ñ±ùí≤\\mathcal{F}/\\mathcal{W+} to find the promising combination of latents in the subspaces for preventing source attribute leakage.\nIn specific, we investigate the suitable latents by assessing the extent to which the target‚Äôs pose can be changed at each combination of latents in subspaces.\nArmed with the investigation, we elaborately design a face swapping model, which is robust to preserving the target image‚Äôs attributes, while effectively reflecting the source image‚Äôs identity. To impose the detailed face shape information of the source image, our model takes the source‚Äôs shape parameter of 3D Morphable Model (3DMM)¬†   as the input.\nIn addition to inject the shape parameters into the model, we introduce a novel partial landmark loss, which is effective to retain the head pose and expression of the target image, while injecting the inner facial geometry of the source image.\nThanks to our well-designed simple architecture and the coordination of the 3DMM information, RobustSwap is secured from the source attribute leakage and injects the more abundant identity information.\nMoreover, RobustSwap is built on megapixels (e.g., 1024 √ó\\times 1024), which is practical and applicable in various applications. In summary, our contributions are three-fold. Based on the analysis of StyleGAN latent space, we introduce RobustSwap, preserving target attributes while preventing the source attribute leakage. For casting detailed source identity information and precise target‚Äôs pose, we propose a shape-guided identity condition and a partial landmark loss with 3DMM.\n Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobustSwap outperforms previous approaches quantitatively and qualitatively.\nMoreover, RobustSwap can produce high-quality videos without training on video datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: face swapping approaches exist.
