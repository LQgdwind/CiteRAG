      "content": "Paper Title: Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Dual Expectile-Quantile Regression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDistributional reinforcement learning aims to approximate the distribution of future returns Z𝑍Z, instead of its expectation Q𝑄Q. This results in several benefits – by ascribing randomness to the value of a state-action pair, an algorithm can learn more efficiently for close states and actions , as well as capture possible stochasticity in the environment . Estimating a parameterized distribution is a straightforward approach, and has been mostly explored from both Bayesian   and frequentist  perspectives. However, this usually requires an expensive likelihood computation, as well as making a restrictive assumption on the shape of the distribution Z𝑍Z. For instance, assuming a normal distribution when the actual distribution is heavy-tailed can yield disappointing results. Thus, non-parametric approaches are also used to approximate the distribution. C51  quantizes the domain where Z𝑍Z has a non-zero density (usually in 51 atoms, hence the name), and performs weighted classification on the atoms, by computing the cross-entropy between Z𝑍Z and 𝒯​Z𝒯𝑍\\mathcal{T}Z. While C51 greatly increases performance over a deterministic evaluation of the Q𝑄Q-value, it requires the user to set the bounds of the divided interval, does not have a proper distribution structure, and relies on averaging the mass points to obtain an estimation of the mean. Yet, biased estimation of the mean of a distribution is likely to deteriorate the average performance 3.\nOther work optimizes on risk metrics such as Value-at-Risk directly, in order to promote exploration safety or prevent risky outcomes [ref]6  [ref]18. Another important non-parametric approach to the estimation of a distribution is quantile regression. Quantile regression originally relies on the minimization of an asymmetric L​1𝐿1L1 loss. Estimating the quantiles of a distribution allows to approximate the action-value distribution without relying on a shape assumption. QR-DQN [ref]8 introduced quantile regression as a way to minimize the earth mover’s distance (or Wasserstein loss) between Z𝑍Z and 𝒯​Z𝒯𝑍\\mathcal{T}Z.\nFurther, implicit quantile networks (IQN)  embed the quantile fraction, in order to process it in the Q-network of a DQN algorithm. Fully parameterized quantile functions (FQF)  additionally learn the optimal quantile fractions, that are then used to compute the values via IQN’s embeddings. However, none of the work above addresses the problem of quantile crossing: the value of the quantile 0.2 should be inferior to the value of the quantile 0.3, to respect the monotonicity of the Cumulative Density Function of Z𝑍Z .\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: distribution is likely to deteriorate the average performance 3.\nOther work optimizes on risk metrics such as Value-at-Risk directly, in order to promote exploration safety or prevent risky outcomes [ref]6  [ref]18.
