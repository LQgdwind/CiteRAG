For instance, a position constraint has relative degree 111 for a velocity-controlled robot, but relative degree 222 for an acceleration-controlled robot. The higher the relative degree, the more inertia the constraint has and the more anticipation is required to respect it. Control barrier functions (CBFs), one of the most common tools to enforce constraints, require constraints of relative degree 1 [ref]4. Albeit not being mentioned, the relative degree of the constraints studied in  has to be 1 for its CBF theory to apply [ref]4. Indeed, both of the experiments of  consist in avoiding obstacles with cars actuated directly by their steering angle, so their relative degree is 1.\nSimilarly, work [ref]45 relies on CBF and hence assumes implicitly constraints of relative degree 1.\nOnly recently have CBFs been specifically extended to handle constraints of higher relative degrees with, for instance, exponential CBFs , generalized CBFs , and high order CBFs (HOCBF) . However, these CBF methods require knowledge of the robot dynamics model, which is typically not available in RL. Work  proposes to model the system dynamics as fully-actuated and affine so that all constraints are of relative degree 1.\nWork [ref]13 mentions constraints of higher relative degree through the notion of inertia, but only address them experimentally by giving a larger margin to correct trajectories before they violate the constraint.\nThe paper  only mentions high order constraints to avoid dealing with them by excluding the states leading to violation, i.e., when their relative degree is higher than 1 from the safe set.\nSimilarly,  uses a Lagrangian approach with state-dependent multipliers and a constraint of relative degree 2. However, the method of  is designed for 2D systems with sufficient control power to effectively counter their inertia, hence circumventing the major challenge of high relative degree constraints. We follow the common approach of most of the safe RL literature [ref]13    [ref]45  and choose to study constraints of relative degree 1 in this work.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: constraint has and the more anticipation is required to respect it.
