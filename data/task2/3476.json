      "content": "Paper Title: Shaping Advice in Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement learning (RL) is a framework that allows agents to complete tasks in an environment, even when a model of the environment is not known .\nAn RL agent ‘learns’ to complete tasks by maximizing an expected long-term reward, where the reward signal is provided by the environment.\nRL algorithms have been successfully implemented in many fields, including games   , robotics [ref]5, autonomous vehicle coordination [ref]6, analysis of social dilemmas , and resource allocation in cellular networks . When the environment is not known, availability of immediate feedback on quality of actions taken at each time-step is critical to the learning of behaviors to successfully complete a task.\nThis is termed credit assignment .\nWhen reward signals provided by the environment are sparse, it becomes difficult to perform effective credit assignment at intermediate steps of the learning process.\nOne approach that has been shown to improve learning when rewards are sparse is reward shaping  0 1.\nReward shaping techniques augment the reward provided by the environment with an additional shaping reward.\nThe shaping reward can be designed to be dense (i.e., not sparse), and agents learn policies (which action to take in a particular state) using the augmented reward. Any additional reward can distract an agent from completing a task specified by the reward provided by the environment, and therefore will need to be provided in a systematic manner 2.\nIn this paper, we term the additional reward given to agents at each time-step as shaping advice.\nThe shaping advice is specified by a difference of potential functions at consecutive time-steps, where each potential function depends on observations and actions of the agents.\nPotential functions satisfy a critical property that the total potential when starting from a state and returning to the same state is zero 3.\nThis ensures that an agent will not be distracted from completing a task specified by the reward provided by the environment. There are additional challenges when there are multiple RL agents.\nIn such a setting, each agent will have to interact not only with its environment, but also with other agents.\nAs behaviors of agents evolve in the environment, the environment will become non-stationary from the perspective of any single agent.\nThus, agents that independently learn behaviors by assuming other agents to be part of the environment can result in unstable learning regimes 4 5 6. When multiple trained agents are deployed independently, or when communication among agents is costly, the agents will need to be able to learn decentralized policies.\nDecentralized policies can be efficicently learned by adopting the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, first introduced in 7.\nAn agent using CTDE can make use of information about other agents’ observations and actions to aid its own learning during training, but will have to take decisions independently at test-time.\nHowever, the ability of an agent to learn decentralized policies can be affected if reward signals from the environment are sparse. Reward shaping techniques that use potential functions satisfy an additional property that the identity of the optimal policies with and without the shaping reward is the same 3.\nThe state-of-the-art on the potential-based reward shaping in RL  0 1 is focused on environments with finite and discrete action spaces.\nTo the best of our knowledge, adapting solution techniques proposed in the above papers to more general settings with continuous action spaces has not been explored.\nMoreover, in the multi-agent case, these works emphasize learning joint policies for agents.\nIn comparison, we propose to learn decentralized policies for each agent, which will enable application of our method to environments with large numbers of agents. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive framework to enable effective credit assignment in RL environments with sparse rewards.\nThese methods incorporate information about the task and environment to define shaping advice.\nWe term our algorithms Shaping Advice in Single-agent reinforcement learning (SAS) when there is only a single agent, and Shaping Advice in Multi-agent reinforcement learning (SAM), when there are multiple agents.\nThe shaping advice in SAS and SAM can be interpreted as domain knowledge that aids credit assignment 8.\nThis advice needs to be specified only once at the start of the training process.\nSAS and SAM can be applied in environments with continuous or discrete state and action spaces.\nWe demonstrate that both algorithms do not distract agents from completing tasks specified by rewards from the environment.\nSpecifically, our contributions are: We introduce SAS and SAM to incorporate potential-based shaping advice in single- and multi-agent deep RL environments with continuous action spaces. We demonstrate that shaping advice provided by SAS and SAM does not distract agents from completing tasks specified by the environment reward. We accomplish this by theoretically establishing that\nconvergence of policy gradients and values when using the shaping advice implies convergence of these quantities in the absence of the shaping advice. We verify our theoretical results through extensive experimental evaluations. Specifically, we evaluate SAS on two environments with sparse rewards- puddle-jump gridworld and continuous mountain car; we evaluate SAM on three tasks in the multi-agent Particle World environment 7. All these tasks have sparse rewards. We show that using shaping advice allows agents to learn policies to complete the tasks faster, and obtain higher rewards than: i) using sparse rewards alone, and ii) a state-of-the-art reward redistribution technique from 9. Compared to a preliminary version that appeared in 0, in this paper, we develop a comprehensive framework for providing shaping advice in both, single- and multi-agent RL.\nWe provide detailed theoretical analyses and experimental evaluations for each setting. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II presents related work and Section III provides an introduction to single- and multi-agent RL and potential-based shaping advice.\nSections IV - VI present the main contributions of this paper.\nWe provide details on SAS and SAM and present theoretical analysis of their convergence in Sections IV and V. Experiments validating the use of SAS and SAM are reported in Section VI, and Section VII concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: by maximizing an expected long-term reward, where the reward signal is provided by the environment.\nRL algorithms have been successfully implemented in many fields, including games   , robotics [ref]5, autonomous vehicle coordination [ref]6, analysis of social dilemmas , and resource allocation in cellular networks .
