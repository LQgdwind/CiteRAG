      "content": "Paper Title: Cut-and-Paste Object Insertion by Enabling Deep Image Prior for Reshading\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA natural choice for an image decomposition is an albedo map (persistent to lighting) and a shading map (transient to lighting). One could then use a SOTA pretrained image decomposition network as gœïsubscriptùëîitalic-œïg_{\\phi} only to adjust the shading of the scene and use the cut-and-paste albedo as it is. Next, we train DIP to reshade (DIPR) the inserted object to produce an image with their albedo, same as the cut-and-paste albedo and a shading field, same as the cut-and-paste image only for the background region other than the inserted fragment. DIPR then learns to extrapolate or interpolate shading for the inserted fragment from the background‚Äôs shading field. We first evaluated DIPR with two SOTA image decomposition methods (one supervised¬†[ref]30 and one unsupervised¬†[ref]13) as measured by strong WHDR performance. The supervised decomposition train their models on CG-generated datasets with ground-truth supervision. [ref]13 uses Paradigms, a statistical model of albedo and shading, an extension of the Retinex¬†. Albedo paradigms are Mondrian images. Shading paradigms are Perlin noise¬†. We show these methods result in poor reshading outcomes (Fig ¬†3). SOTA albedo-shading decompositions get strong WHDR performance by suppressing fine spatial details in albedo. These methods preserve spatial and geometric details in the shading field and not albedo because they construct albedo as a piece-wise color constant (Mondrian) with no fine details on them. These fine geometric details are hard to recover accurately from a DIP when trained to interpolate the foreground shading field from their background.\nHowever,¬†[ref]13 offers an interesting feature in their Paradigms construction. The statistical models used are authored. Changing the statistical properties of their models would result in a different class of decompositions. We take advantage of this feature. We change¬†[ref]13 and construct an albedo (Aùê¥A) ‚Äì a persistent map, a diffuse shading (SùëÜS) ‚Äì a multiplicative transient map and a gloss (Gùê∫G) ‚Äì an aditive transient map using the same statistical process.\nWe compose them as I=A√óS+Gùêºùê¥ùëÜùê∫I=A\\times S+G to form an image and train a network to decompose them back. Fig.¬†4a shows samples of our. Fig.¬†4b illustrates the resulting decompositions are satisfactory on MSCOCO¬†[ref]36 real images. The main difference between ours and ¬†[ref]13 is that we assume shading to be smooth and albedo has all the high-frequency information so that they can be recovered when reshading with a DIP. This is a reasonable assumption for our method because we aim to preserve all the fine-spatial details of inserted fragment when transferring from one image to another. The additional gloss map that we use helps us to extract better lighting representations in scenes with strong lighting effects like shafts. We show our decomposition produces convincing object reshading when compared to other SOTA image decomposition methods (Fig.¬†3).\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: then learns to extrapolate or interpolate shading for the inserted fragment from the background‚Äôs shading field.
