      "content": "Paper Title: WaveTransform: Crafting Adversarial Examples via Input Decomposition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAdversarial generation algorithms presented in the literature can be divided into the following categories: (i) gradient-based, (ii) optimization-based, (iii) decision boundary-based, and (iv) universal perturbation. Goodfellow et al. [ref]20 proposed a fast attack method that calculated the gradient of the image concerning the final output and pushed the image pixels in the direction opposite to the sign of the gradient. The adversarial noise vector can be defined as: η=ϵ​s​i​g​n​(▽x​Jθ​(x,l))𝜂italic-ϵ𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛subscript▽𝑥subscript𝐽𝜃𝑥𝑙\\eta=\\epsilon sign(\\triangledown_{x}J_{\\theta}(x,l)), where ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon controls the magnitude of perturbation, ▽xsubscript▽𝑥\\triangledown_{x} represents the gradient of image x𝑥x with respect to network parameters θ𝜃\\theta. The perturbation vector η𝜂\\eta is added in the image to generate the adversarial image. The above process is applied for a single step, which is less effective and can easily be defended 0. Therefore, several researchers have proposed the variant where the noise is added iteratively [ref]29, , and with momentum . Moosavi-Dezfooli et al.  have proposed a method that can transfer clean images from their decision boundaries to some other, belonging to a different class. The attacks are performed iteratively using a linear approximation of the non-linear decision boundary. Carlini and Wagner  presented attacks by restricting the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} norm of an adversarial image. The other variant, such as L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty} and L1subscript𝐿1L_{1}, are also proposed; however, they are found to be less effective as compared to L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}. Similar to L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} norm minimization, Chen et al.  have proposed the elastic norm optimization attack, which is the combination of L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} and L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} norm. Goswami et al.   presented several black-box attacks to fool the state-of-the-art face recognition algorithms. Later, both adversarial examples detection and mitigation algorithms are also presented in the paper. Agarwal et al.  shown the use of filtering operations in generating adversarial noise in a network-agnostic manner. Other popular adversarial generation algorithms are based on generative networks , and EoT . The application of an adversarial attack is not restricted to 2D object recognition but also explored for semantic segmentation , 3D recognition , audio classification , text recognition , and reinforcement learning . Goel et al.  have developed an adversarial toolbox for the generation of adversarial perturbations and defense against them. The details of the existing algorithms can be found in the survey papers presented by Yuan et al.  and Singh et al. 7.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: in the literature can be divided into the following categories: (i) gradient-based, (ii) optimization-based, (iii) decision boundary-based, and (iv) universal perturbation.
