      "content": "Paper Title: Content-aware Masked Image Modeling Transformer for Stereo Image Compression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStereo Image Codec (SIC) compresses a pair of stereoscopic images captured from distinct viewpoints by the same camera. SIC has attracted significant interest due to the growing demand for high-quality stereo image transmission and storage across applications such as autonomous driving , virtual reality streaming  and video surveillance . By leveraging the inherent correlation between views, they achieve higher coding efficiency compared with single image compression. Over the past decades, classical multi-view image coding standards, such as H.264-based MVC  and H.265-based MV-HEVC , have catalyzed the development of learning-based stereo image compression approaches [ref]29    . Given a reference view, these methods, rooted in the predictive coding paradigm, employ disparity-compensated prediction in either pixel or feature space to compress current view. Additionally, recent advancements have introduced a bidirectional coding framework  [ref]44 that utilizes a cross-attention mechanism, further enhancing content correlation exploitation between stereo images. Albeit remarkable, the odyssey of stereo image compression research concentrates on producing compact representations through various information flows or network designs before entropy coding. However, an orthogonal direction, which reduces redundancy by devising a superior spatial-disparity entropy model for entropy coding, is rarely explored. Previous learning-based SIC approaches often adapt existing single image compression solutions, such as hyperprior  and auto-regressive prior , into conditional formats. These adapted entropy models, typically based on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, aim to capture spatial-disparity correlations. However, CNNs are inherently limited by their local receptive fields, which hampers their ability to model long-range dependencies. This limitation often leads to a rough estimation of probability distribution and inferior compression performance, especially when the disparity distance between stereo images is large. Consequently, we argue that better coding gains can be achieved as long as we find a more effective spatial-disparity entropy model. In this paper, we present a stereo image compression framework that centers on a powerful Transformer entropy model to leverage spatial-disparity dependencies between current and previously decoded views. This framework incorporates a straightforward image encoder-decoder pair from  to extract latent representations for each view. As illustrated in Fig. 1 (a), we introduce the vanilla masked image modeling (MIM) style [ref]13 to construct a content-irrelevant encoder-decoder Transformer entropy model. This model captures spatial information from the context of decoded tokens and disparity information from previous decoded view. Since the bi-directional self-attention in Transformer allows [MASK] tokens to use context from both directions, it supports a non-sequential auto-regressive decoding process and decodes all tokens in the images in a few steps, achieving a good performance-speed trade-off [ref]13. Nevertheless, the vanilla MIM-based Transformer entropy model still exhibits two significant shortcomings. Firstly, it uses uniform [MASK] tokens to indicate the positions of the tokens whose probability distributions are yet to be estimated, which are irrelevant to the video content and uninformative to entropy coding. As a result, it wastes much computation and leads to inferior coding gains. Secondly, it needs an extra Transformer decoder to propagate the prior information via cross-attention. Such a complicated encoder-decoder Transformer architecture only permits an inefficient unidirectional propagation from the prior information to the input tokens of the Transformer decoder. To overcome these challenges, we develop a novel Content-Aware Masked image modeling Transformer entropy model for Stereo Image Compression (CAMSIC) shown in Fig. 1 (b). Specifically, we introduce content-aware tokens generated by prior information to replace the uninformative [MASK] tokens, forming a new content-aware masked image modeling style, which brings three major benefits. First, when updating the features of the estimated tokens, because interacting with the proposed content-aware tokens provides useful information about each specific position, it prevents the distraction of previous uninformative [MASK] tokens. Second, it allows a bidirectional information flow between prior information and estimated tokens via self-attention. Compared with static prior information in the vanilla MIM, content-aware tokens, carrying specific prior information, can also be iteratively updated. Thus, it can effectively capture the context information from already estimated tokens and reduce the estimation uncertainty of remaining tokens. Third, since our design naturally embeds prior information propagation into each self-attention operation, we discard the whole Transformer decoder and devise an encoder-only Transformer architecture with low computation overhead. In summary, our main contributions are three-fold: We introduce a learning-based stereo image compression framework with a simple image encoder-decoder pair, which focuses on using a elegantly neat but powerful Transformer entropy model based on masked image modeling to exploit the relationship between the left and right images. We present a unique content-aware masked image modeling style for Transformer entropy model. This innovation enables more effective and extensive interactions between prior information and estimated tokens, while also facilitating an efficient yet strong decoder-free Transformer entropy model architecture design. Experimental results show that our proposed method with lower encoding and decoding latency significantly outperforms existing learning-based stereo image compression methods. When compared with the state-of-the-art method ECSIC [ref]44, our method saves around 8.512% and 0.629% bitrates in terms of PSNR on Cityscapes and InStereo2K datasets, respectively. Detailed ablation studies and analyses validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: the past decades, classical multi-view image coding standards, such as H.264-based MVC  and H.265-based MV-HEVC , have catalyzed the development of learning-based stereo image compression approaches [ref]29    .
