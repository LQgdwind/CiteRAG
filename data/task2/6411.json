Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

On miniImageNet, our proposed method achieves the highest accuracy on each session. Particularly, compared with the second-best method SoftNet, the average accuracy Avg. of our proposed KR-RCNet has an improvement of 5.26%percent\\%, while the performance gap Diff. with the Joint-CNN of our proposed KR-RCNet has an improvement of 5.34%percent\\%. On CIFAR100, our proposed KR-RCNet also achieves the highest accuracy on each session. Particularly, compared with the second-best method SoftNet, the average accuracy Avg. of our proposed KR-RCNet has an improvement of 3.49%percent\\%, while the performance gap Diff. with the Joint-CNN of our proposed KR-RCNet has an improvement of 3.2%percent\\%. On CUB200, our proposed KR-RCNet achieves the best performance on each session as on miniImageNet and CIFAR100. Particularly, compared with the second-best method MCNet, the average accuracy Avg. of our proposed KR-RCNet has an improvement of 2.25%percent\\%, while the performance gap Diff. with the Joint-CNN of our proposed KR-RCNet has an improvement of 1.39%percent\\%. In summary, compared to other methods shown in Table I, II, and III, our proposed method not only achieves the highest average accuracy Avg. but also achieves the largest performance gap Diff. with the Joint-CNN. The quantitative comparisons demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed KT-RCNet.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we compare it with some classical class-incremental learning methods (iCaRL [ref]26, EEIL [ref]43, and NCM [ref]42) and recent FSCIL methods (TOPIC , SPPR , CEC , F2M , C-FSCIL , MetaFSCIL , FACT , SoftNet  and MCNet ) on three popular benchmark datasets.\nAs can be observed\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
