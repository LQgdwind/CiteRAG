      "content": "Paper Title: Better Call the Plumber: Orchestrating Dynamic Information Extraction Pipelines\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the last decade, many open source tools have been released by the research community to tackle IE tasks for KGs. These IE components are not only used for end-to-end KG triple extraction but also for various other tasks, such as:\nText Triple Extraction: The task of open information extraction is a well studied researched task in the NLP community .\nIt relies on NER (Named Entity Recognition) and RE (Relation Extraction).\nSalIE  uses MinIE [ref]21 in combination with PageRank and clustering to find facts in the input text.\nFurthermore, OpenIE  leverages linguistic structures to extract self-contained clauses from the text. A comprehensive survey by Niklaus et al.  provides detailed about such techniques.\nEntity and Relation Linking:\nEntity and relation linking is a widely studied researched topic in the NLP, Web, and Information Retrieval research communities [ref]3  1. Often, entity and relation linking is performed independently. DBpedia Spotlight 0 is one of the first approaches for entity recognition and disambiguation over DBpedia. TagMe 8 links entities to DBpedia using in-link matching to disambiguate candidates entities. Others tools such as RelMatch  do not perform entity linking and only focus on linking the relation in the text to the corresponding KG relation. Recon  uses graph neural networks to to map relations between the entities with the assumption that entities are already linked in the text. EARL 5 is a joint linking tool over DBpedia and models the task as a generalized traveling salesperson problem. Sakor et al.  proposed Falcon, a linguistic rules based tool for joint entity and relation linking over DBpedia. \nCoreference Resolution: This task is used in conjunction with other tasks in NLP pipelines to disambiguate text and resolve syntactic complexities. The Stanford Coreference Resolver  uses a multi pass sieve of deterministic coreference models. Clark and Manning  use reinforcement learning to fine-tune a neural mention-ranking model for coreference resolution. And more recently .\nFrameworks and Dynamic Pipelines:\nThere have been few attempts in various domains aiming to consolidate the disjoint efforts of the research community under a single umbrella for solving a particular task. The Gerbil platform 1 provides an easy-to-use web-based platform for the agile comparison of entity linking tools using multiple datasets and uniform measuring approaches. OKBQA  is a community effort for the development of multilingual open knowledge base and QA systems. Frankenstein integrates 24 QA components to build QA systems collaboratively on-top of the Qanary integration framework . Other ETL pipelines system exists such as Apache NiFi. Semantic Web Pipes  and LarKC 7 are other prominent examples.\n\nEnd-to-End Extraction Systems:\nMore recently, end-to-end systems are gaining more attention due to the boom of deep learning techniques. Such systems draw on the strengths of deep models and transformers 3 .\nKertkeidkachorn and Ichise  present an end-to-end system to extract triples and link them to DBpedia. Other attempts such as KG-Bert 4 leverage deep transformers (i.e., BERT 3) for the triple classification task, given the entity and relation descriptions of a triple. KG-Bert does not attempt end-to-end alignment of KG triples from a given input text. Liu et al.  design an encoder-decoder framework with an attention mechanism to extract and align triples to a KG.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: The task of open information extraction is a well studied researched task in the NLP community .\nIt relies on NER (Named Entity Recognition) and RE (Relation Extraction).\nSalIE  uses MinIE [ref]21 in combination with PageRank and clustering to find facts in the input text.\nFurthermore, OpenIE  leverages linguistic structures to extract self-contained clauses from the text. A\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. Generate exactly 40 titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning."
