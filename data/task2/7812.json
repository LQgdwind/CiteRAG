      "content": "Paper Title: Verification Algorithms for Automated Separation Logic Verifiers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven a program and a specification, automated deductive program verifiers such as Boogie , Corral , Dafny , and Why3  compute proof obligations whose validity implies the correctness of the input program. These proof obligations are typically checked using SMT solvers, such as CVC5  or Z3 . For program verifiers based on separation logic  or related permission logics 7, proof obligations are computed using two prevalent verification algorithms: symbolic execution (SE) and verification condition generation (VCG). For instance, Caper [ref]17, Gillian , JaVerT 4, SecC , Smallfoot , and VeriFast  are separation logic verifiers based on symbolic execution, whereas Chalice  and GrassHopper [ref]46 use verification condition generation. Viper  provides two backend-verifiers, one based on SE and one on VCG. Even though these tools differ in many aspects of the supported programming language, separation logic, and proof automation, they employ fairly uniform SE and VCG algorithms. Their SE algorithms use a symbolic heap representation based on separation logic’s partial-heap semantics : a symbolic heap maps those separation logic resources (in particular, heap locations) to symbolic values that are owned in a given program state. Each owned resource is represented by one or more heap chunks, which map resources to ownership and value information.\nIn contrast, the VCG algorithms implemented in separation logic verifiers use a total-heap representation, in which the heap is a total map from memory locations to values, and the currently-owned resources are tracked in a separate data structure.\nThese two different ways of internally modeling the heap both implement the same source-level language semantics. These verification algorithms, and their variations implemented in various tools, are all designed to be sound, but strike different trade-offs between performance and completeness. For instance, SE verifies each path through a method separately, whereas VCG typically generates one proof obligation for the entire method. Therefore, VCG produces fewer, but larger proof obligations, which may affect the effectiveness and performance of the underlying SMT solver. Consequently, developers of program verifiers need to choose the verification algorithm carefully, depending on the intended application area of their tools. For verifiers that support several algorithms, such as the verifiers built on top of the Viper infrastructure   , this choice needs to be made by users. Taking an informed decision requires a systematic comparison of the performance and completeness characteristics of the verification algorithms used by modern separation logic verifiers.\nSuch a comparison necessitates implementations of all relevant algorithms for the same programming language, verification logic, and tool because comparisons across different settings would not yield meaningful results. To the best of our knowledge, such implementations and, consequently, a comprehensive comparison do not exist.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: or related permission logics 7, proof obligations are computed using two prevalent verification algorithms: symbolic execution (SE) and verification condition generation (VCG).
