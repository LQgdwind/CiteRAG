Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

Reinforcement learning has been used for multi-step retrosynthetic planning,\nwhich seeks to find an optimal sequence of multiple reactions to synthesize a product.\nSchreck et.al.  trains an agent to select reactions from a list\nto construct the sequence backward starting from the product,\nuntil all the reactants of the first reaction in the sequence\nare purchasable.\nIn this method, reinforcement learning is used to select reactions rather than predicting reactions.\nHowever, there is very limited work applying reinforcement learning to retrosynthesis.\nRCSearcher [ref]23 applies a deep Q𝑄Q network\nto search a molecular graph for reaction centers.\nIn contrast, 𝖱𝖫𝖲𝗒𝗇𝖢𝖱𝖫𝖲𝗒𝗇𝖢\\mathop{\\mathsf{RLSynC}}\\limits uses reinforcement learning for synthon completion.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: Deep reinforcement learning methods have been developed to design new small molecules.\nFor example,\nGCPN [ref]17 uses a graph convolutional policy network to sequentially add new atoms and\nbonds to construct new molecules.\nMolDQN  uses\nMorgan fingerprints  to represent molecules, and learns a deep\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
