      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeural networks are known to be vulnerable to “smart noise” or adversarial attacks. These attacks are quasi-imperceptible perturbations in the input, measured using Lpsubscript𝐿𝑝L_{p} norms, that force a network to change its output [ref]2. Currently, adversarial training is the most common strategy that may provide limited defence against known attacks. In adversarial training, a modified objective function is optimized which helps in adversarial robustness by increasing the level of perturbation required to successfully change the network decision [ref]2. With 𝜽𝜽\\boldsymbol{\\theta} denoting the learnable parameters of the model, training data (x,y)∼Dsimilar-to𝑥𝑦𝐷(x,y)\\sim D, and perturbation δ∈Δ𝛿Δ\\delta\\in\\Delta, adversarial training can be formulated as the following min-max optimization problem: where ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} denotes the model’s loss function. The adversarial training can be considered as a method for the model to learn certain (lpsubscript𝑙𝑝l_{p}-bounded) invariances to the dataset. Some recent studies have established that learning certain types of invariances qualitatively (visually) and quantitatively may improve attribution maps, i.e., maps look more relevant to the object as viewed by a human operator  [ref]35. In a way, adversarial training helps the network learn more like the human visual system learns. Figure 4 shows the difference between attribution maps generated for adversarially and naturally trained network. It is evident that the attribution maps produced by adversarially trained models seem more visually aligned with human perception    [ref]35. Tsipras et al. described this relationship between adversarial robustness and enhanced visual alignment of attribution maps as an “unexpected benefit” of adversarial training . Later, a number of studies verified and made an effort to explain the natural connection between adversarial robustness and explainability [ref]35  . Etmann et al. showed that the improved interpretability of the saliency maps of a robustified neural network was not a side-effect of adversarial training, but a general property enjoyed by networks that are robust to adversarial perturbations [ref]35. The authors showed that robustness could be defined as the distance of a test point to its closest decision boundary, and that increasing the distance (robustness) resulted in an increased alignment between the input and its attribution map. Recently, Kim et al. showed that the gradients from adversarially trained networks were better aligned with the human visual system as the adversarial training caused the gradients to lie closer to the image manifold . They also reported differences in the attribution maps generated with robust networks trained using l2subscript𝑙2l_{2} and l∞subscript𝑙l_{\\infty} adversarial images. The neural networks trained with l2subscript𝑙2l_{2} were more effective at emphasizing important features while attributions from l∞subscript𝑙l_{\\infty}-trained networks were better at identifying less important features. Ignatiev et al. performed a theoretical analysis using a generalized form of hitting set duality to relate explanations and adversarial examples . The authors proposed the dual concept of counterexamples (and adversarial examples) and the notion of breaking an explanation. They established that each explanation must break every counterexample and vice versa. Thus, concluding that the more counterexamples (adversarial examples) the model explains, the better the interpretability of the model.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: to “smart noise” or adversarial attacks.
