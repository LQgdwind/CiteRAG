Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

As aforementioned, we use 16 queries to learn subject representation. Other training hyperparameters follow [ref]29. For subject representation learning, we use a subset of 292K images from OpenImage-V6 , each containing a salient subject. We also remove images with human-related subjects.\nWe use BLIP-2 OPT6.7B to generate captions as text prompts.\nWe obtain a set of 59K background images from the web to synthesize subject inputs.\nWe use Stable Diffusion v1-5 as the foundation diffusion model.\nWe use a total batch size 16 with a constant learning rate 2e-6 for 500K steps using AdamW  optimizer, taking 6 days to finish on 16 A100 40Gb GPUs.\nMore details on hyperparameters and data filtering procedure are included in Appendix for reference.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: For multimodal representation learning, we follow BLIP-2  and pretrain the model on 129M image-text pairs, including 115M image-text pairs from LAION  with CapFilt [ref]29 captions, COCO , Visual Genome  and Conceptual Captions [ref]32 [ref]33.\nWe use ViT-L/14 from CLIP  as the image encoder, and initialize Q-Former with BERTbase .
