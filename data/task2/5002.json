      "content": "Paper Title: Scaling Multimodal Pre-Training via Cross-Modality Gradient Harmonization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSelf-supervised pre-training scales up deep learning to leverage massive unlabeled data. Beyond the maturity of pre-training over single-modality data such as language  or images , the recent success on multimodal pre-training [ref]4 [ref]5 demonstrates the versatility to synergize the rich multimodal information and to benefit a variety of downstream tasks. Many methods of this category    [ref]4, especially the latest contrastive pre-training methods [ref]5   1, consider the most organic supervision as the cross-modality alignment (CMA), e.g., in the same video sequence, the video frames, audio stream, and text scripts are temporally aligned and hence should naturally have correspondence. Such assumed cross-modal correspondence could be exploited as “mutual supervision\" for each modality to learn consistent semantic features with others. For example, the latest Video-Audio-Text Transformer (VATT) 1 hinges on this multimodal CMA a priori to train a transformer-based architecture (even a single backbone by sharing weights among three modalities), using two contrastive losses to align video-text and video-audio pairs, respectively. Their results set many new records in downstream tasks with neither supervised pre-training nor predefined inductive biases, showing strong “universal\" generalizability despite the modality and domain gaps. In this paper, we focus on studying gradients in a modality-agnostic single-backbone setting of VATT 1. Unfortunately, the CMA assumption rests on a very shaky foundation, especially for uncurated videos collected in the wild. The CMA can be weak even for the instructional videos such as HowTo100M  that are commonly adopted as the current multimodal pre-training data source. For instance, a speaker can refer to something before or after actually demonstrating it visually; she or he could also skip verbally explaining something that is visually happening, because that may be trivial or be already clear enough in the visual context . Such discrepancy would be amplified if considering many other outliers in video (e.g. background objects) or language (e.g. off-topic small talks). The semantic misalignment will be even more severe, and in unpredictable forms, when we go beyond instructional videos and explore training with non-narrative, free-from internet videos. Figure 1 shows a few examples of such cross-modal misalignment in the non-narrative Youtube8M dataset , which would put CMA-guided pre-training in jeopardy. This important problem is yet under-studied in the self-supervised multimodal pre-training literature. That said, there has been a few recent efforts such as Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) NCE  and noisy pair pruning as in 4. We conjecture that the vanilla CMA might provide only weak, noisy and even misleading supervision for multimodal pre-training; hence it might constitute a hidden bottleneck when scaled up with more realistic data (beyond instructional videos) whose modalities are poorly aligned. We verify our conjecture by inspecting two large-scale multimodal datasets, HowTo100M 5 and Youtube8M .\nSpecifically, when we adopt pairwise CMA losses (e.g. video-audio, video-text) within the cross-modal sample triplets (video, audio, text), a majority of the gradients strongly conflict with each other in terms of their directions. We further identify (in Figure 3) that such strong conflict in gradients are correlated to noisiness of samples, indicating the noisy and misaligned supervision could be an important cause of gradient conflicts. Moreover, the cross-modal conflict leads to not only unstable training convergence, but also modality-specific overfitting; e.g. semantically strong representations for one modality while collapsed representations for another 6, yielding weak overall performance in cross-modality tasks such as Text-Video Retrieval as shown in Table 1. Build upon the above conjectures and observations, we propose to harmonize those gradients so that they become mutually compatible in learning the unified representations. Specifically, we introduce two techniques: (i) cross-modal gradient realignment, where we modify different pairwise CMA loss gradients to align their directions for the same sample triplet, using gradient surgery 7 developed for multi-task learning; and (ii) gradient-based curriculum learning, where we leverage the gradient conflict information to indicate sample noisiness (e.g. a triplet whose CMA gradients are in more agreement is considered less “noisy\" and would be prioritized for cross-modal pre-training) and a curriculum learning strategy is developed accordingly. Both techniques are found to boost VATT performance on downstream tasks, not only on instructional videos, but even more when the more complicated non-narrative data is involved. Our contributions can be summarized as the following: We suggest that the commonly assumed CMA might be an important yet overlooked performance hurdle for scaling up multimodal pre-training, and we observe severe misalignment even from the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model 1 on the relatively aligned data . We propose to consistently improve the pre-training pipeline in the only baseline in this direction, VATT (modality-agnostic setting), resulting in better downstream performance. With the help of our proposed techniques, we consistently improve the pre-training of VATT, resulting in better downstream performance, e.g. up to 58% gain in the rank metric of video-text retrieval task.\nMoreover, we are able to scale VATT pre-training to more complicated non-narrative Youtube8M dataset, which further yields new state-of-the-art performance in a modality-agnostic setting.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: scales up deep learning to leverage massive unlabeled data.
