      "content": "Paper Title: Scene relighting with illumination estimation in the latent space on an encoder-decoder scheme\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile relighting a scene captured under a large number of different illuminations is an easy process, doing so with one or very few samples is a complex challenge, as multi-illumination datasets are hard to capture. [ref]18 developed a system to quickly capture scenes under several lighting conditions using a flash bouncing off the walls to illuminate the scene in different directions. It provides a dataset of real scenes captured under 25 lighting conditions, that can be used to train a relighting network. [ref]26 trains a fully convolutional encoder-decoder to relight a scene from a sparse set of input images. It needs 5 images of a same scene under different directional lighting to produce a relit image in a novel light. Both  and  attempt to relight a portrait from a single image.  uses a U-Net, an encoder-decoder with skip connections, to predict the illumination corresponding to the source image and replace it with the target lighting. The network produces great results on faces but the objective functions are applied only to masked part of the images – people – while the backgrounds are not affected but replaced by the blurred version of the environment map.  uses a similar architecture, but the encoder extracts facial features in addition to lighting features. The facial feature stays unchanged while the target lighting replaces the input lighting. A PatchGAN is used to improve the quality of the generated image and removes local artifacts. This network gives good results on portrait images but does not generalizes to other scenes, giving poor results on non-portrait images.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: a scene captured under a large number of different illuminations is an easy process, doing so with one or very few samples is a complex challenge, as multi-illumination datasets are hard to capture.
