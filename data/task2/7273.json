      "content": "Paper Title: SCENES: Subpixel Correspondence Estimation With Epipolar Supervision\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe task of finding corresponding points in two or more views of a scene—that is, the subpixel positions that correspond to the same visible 3D surface location—is a fundamental low-level image processing problem.\nIt underpins many computer vision tasks, including relative pose or fundamental matrix estimation [ref]18  4, visual localisation [ref]39 , Structure-from-Motion (SfM)  , and Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM)  , and is related to optical flow estimation    1 when the camera motion is small. Classically approached in two stages with keypoint detection followed by local feature extraction and matching 6  , recent approaches    eschew the detection step to ensure that dense matches can be extracted even in texture-poor regions.\nHowever, the supervision requirements of most approaches are onerous: ground-truth correspondences are assumed to be available.\nWhile these can be obtained from camera poses and 3D structure (depth maps, point clouds or meshes), these are often not readily accessible.\nThis makes it challenging to train or finetune these models on new datasets or in new regimes.\nFor example, a robot preloaded with the latest local feature matching network would not be able to adapt the model when deployed in a new environment, unless it were able to reconstruct the environment.\nObtaining a good quality reconstruction would itself require a good matching network, unless auxiliary sources of information, like a 3D sensor, were available.\nTo resolve this chicken-and-egg problem, we instead propose an approach that only requires approximate known camera poses, which can be acquired from odometry or GPS combined with an accelerometer.\nThis allows, in particular, for model adaptation and finetuning in domains where ground-truth 3D structure is difficult to procure. To address this problem, we propose to fine-tune existing models using epipolar losses, drop-in replacements for the correspondence losses in state-of-the-art transformer-based matching networks.\nThese encourage putative matches to lie on the associated epipolar lines, which are computed using the relative camera poses.\nWhile significantly weaker than correspondence supervision, we observe that this cue is sufficient for finetuning existing models on new data.\nFinally, we propose a bootstrapping approach that removes the need for camera pose supervision as well, allowing us to use an existing pre-trained model to improve itself.\nThis expands the types of settings where these models can be deployed and reduces the annotation and pre-processing burdens.\nTo summarise, our contributions are:\n Epipolar losses—drop-in replacements for existing matching losses that remove the need for strong correspondence supervision; and Strategies for adapting pre-trained models to new domains with only pose supervision, or no supervision. We evaluate on two challenging datasets with significantly different characteristics from the pre-training data: an indoor drone dataset and an outdoor phone camera dataset.\nCompared to the original model, our weakly supervised and unsupervised finetuning strategies allow us to find keypoint matches that achieve significantly improved pose estimation results.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: to the same visible 3D surface location—is a fundamental low-level image processing problem.\nIt underpins many computer vision tasks, including relative pose or fundamental matrix estimation [ref]18  4, visual localisation [ref]39 , Structure-from-Motion (SfM)  , and Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM)  , and is related to optical flow estimation    1 when the camera motion is\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
