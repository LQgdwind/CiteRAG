      "content": "Paper Title: Learnable Gabor modulated complex-valued networks for orientation robustness\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMethods have been developed in an attempt to integrate transformation invariance in an a-priori fashion. Prior to CNN popularity, the use of hand-crafted features such as SIFT  and Gabor filters   was explored to generate rotation/scale invariant representations.\nA widely adopted technique in deep learning is to augment transformations into a dataset   . This brute force approach introduces new samples to prompt the model to learn this new range of transformations. Models with learned invariance through augmentation require a very large parameter space to capitalise on data augmentation, and still may generalise poorly to unseen transformations. There has been much work recently on encoding symmetries into CNN architectures.\nEarly efforts utilised pooling over transformed responses, e.g. siamese networks , training-time augmentation  , parallel convolutional layers  [ref]11, kernel-based affine pooling , and image warping    .\nSpecifically in the last few years there has been a surge of interest in rotation equivariant architectures.\nAuthors have been able to formulate CNNs entirely from principles of group theory and thus construct modified operators and/or constrain filters [ref]10 [ref]1 .\nBekkers et al.  employ bi-linear interpolation to enable any regular sampling of the continuous group of 2D rotation. Similarly  and  utilise copied and rotated filters, but pool over the produced activation maps. While interpolation allows rotation by exact angles (as in   ) it introduces artefacts for angles outside of the discrete sampling grid. In  residual blocks are combined with principles of steerable bases to learn approximate equivariance. Worrall et al.  allow exact orientation representations while overcoming dependence on interpolation by constraining filters to the family of complex circular harmonics: there is a clear demonstration of complex neurons encoding rotational information which justifies our usage of complex CNNs for rotation equivariance. Finzi et al.  are able to construct group equivariance without steerable filters by constructing filters as parameterisations of Lie algebra .\nSimilarly, Weiler et al.  present a CNN architecture with learnable steerable filters, and derive a generalised weight initialisation method for steerable basis coefficients. Using a formulation of steerable filter architectures, 1 proposes a general framework for equivariant networks under any combination of rotation, reflection or translation.\nWe draw inspiration from the cyclic shifting group convolutions commonly used in group theory based CNNs [ref]10 [ref]1 [ref]11  , and propose a similar operation for rotation generalisation without requiring derivation from group theory and reducing computational overhead. Analytical filters have made a resurgence in many deep learning contexts. Specific to transformation invariance, analytical filters parameterised by rotation are fast and can extract orientational features dependent on exact angles, overcoming interpolation artefacts. Several approaches replace convolutional weights with wavelet filters 2 3 4. Wavelets are also applied to inputs of standard convolutional layers in a preprocessing fashion 5. In 6 authors present a framework for convolutional weight modulation, achieving enhanced filters with binarised weights. Zhou et al.  exploit rotation parameterisation of discrete Fourier transforms to extract orientation information, modulating standard convolutional filters with a filter bank of rotated analytical filters. Luan et al.  implement a similar approach but opt to use Gabor filters, demonstrating that they are more robust to rotation and scale transformations. In 7 wavelet filter hyperparameters are learned in an end to end fashion for spectral decomposition through wavelet deconvolutions. We combine lessons learned from 7 with  to construct Gabor filter modulation with learnable parameters.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: on encoding symmetries into CNN architectures.\nEarly efforts utilised pooling over transformed responses, e.g. siamese networks , training-time augmentation  , parallel convolutional layers  [ref]11, kernel-based affine pooling , and image warping    .\nSpecifically in the last few years there has been a surge of interest in rotation equivariant architectures.\nAuthors have been able to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
