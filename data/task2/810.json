      "content": "Paper Title: Cross-Modal Knowledge Reasoning for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFVQA:\nThe FVQA dataset [ref]5 consists of 2,190 images, 5,286 questions and a knowledge base of 193,449 facts. The knowledge base is constructed by extracting the top visual concepts from all the images in the dataset and querying those concepts from three knowledge bases, including DBPedia , ConceptNet  and WebChild . For each image-question pair in the dataset, the task aims to choose an entity in a supporting fact from the knowledge base as the answer by jointly considering the given question and image. Visual7W+KB: The Visual7W dataset  is built based on a subset of images from Visual Genome [ref]40, which includes questions in terms of (what, where, when, who, why, which and how) along with the corresponding answers in a multi-choice format. However, most of questions of Visual7W solely base on the image content which don’t require external knowledge. Furthermore, [ref]21 generated a collection of knowledge-based questions based on the test images in Visual7W by filling a set of question-answer templates that need to reason on both visual content and external knowledge. We denoted this dataset as Visual7W+KB in our paper. In general, Visual7W+KB consists of 16,850 open-domain question-answer pairs based on 8,425 images in Visual7W test split. Different from FVQA, Visual7W+KB uses ConceptNet to guide the question generation but doesn’t provide a task-specific knowledge base. In our work, we also leverage ConceptNet to retrieve the supporting knowledge and select one entity as the predicted answer. OK-VQA:  proposed the Outside Knowledge VQA (OK-VQA) dataset, which is the largest KVQA dataset at present. Different from existing KVQA datasets, the questions in OK-VQA are manually generated by MTurk workers, which are not derived from specific knowledge bases. Therefore, it requires the model to retrieve supporting knowledge from open-domain resources, which is much closer to the general VQA but more challenging for existing models. OK-VQA contains 14,031 images which are randomly collected from MSCOCO dataset , using the original 80k-40k training and validation splits as train and test splits. OK-VQA contains 14,055 questions covering a variety of knowledge categories such as science & technology, history, and sports. In our work, we leverage ConceptNet to retrieve the supporting knowledge and select one entity as the predicted answer. Evaluation Metrics: We follow the metrics in [ref]5 to evaluate the question answering performance. The top-1 and top-3 accuracy is calculated for each model. The averaged accuracy of 5 test splits is reported as the overall accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: FVQA:\nThe FVQA dataset [ref]5 consists of 2,190 images, 5,286 questions and a knowledge base of 193,449 facts.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
