      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Deep Video Compression by Resolution-adaptive Flow Coding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTransform-based image compression methods can efficiently reduce the spatial redundancy.\nCurrently, those approaches (e.g., JPEG , BPG  and JPEG2000 ) are still the most widely used image compression algorithms.\nRecently, the deep learning based image compression methods  [ref]27   [ref]25   [ref]16   have been proposed and achieved the state-of-the-arts performance.\nThe general idea of deep image compression is to transform input images into quantized bit-streams, which can be further compressed through lossless coding algorithms.\nTo achieve this goal,\nsome methods [ref]27   directly employed recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to compress the images in a progressive manner.\nToderici et al.  firstly introduced a simple RNN-based approach to compress the image and further proposed a method [ref]27, which enhances the performance by progressively compressing reconstructed residual information. Johnston et al.  also improved Toderici’s work by introducing a new objective loss.\nOther popular approaches use an auto-encoder architecture    [ref]25.\nBalle et al.  introduced a continuous and differentiable proxy for the rate-distortion loss and further proposed a variational auto-encoder based compression algorithm . Recently, some methods   focus on predicting different distribution in different spatial area. And Li et al. [ref]16 introduced the importance map to reduce the total binary codes to transmit. All such methods need to transmit the full-resolution feature map to the decoding stage. Our proposed method selects the most optimal resolution at both frame-level and block-level in the encoding side, which saves a lot of bits.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: redundancy.\nCurrently, those approaches (e.g., JPEG , BPG  and JPEG2000 ) are still the most widely used image compression algorithms.\nRecently, the deep learning based image compression methods  [ref]27   [ref]25   [ref]16   have been proposed and achieved the state-of-the-arts performance.\nThe general idea of deep image compression is to transform input images into quantized bit-streams,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
