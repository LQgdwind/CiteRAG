Since the traffic contains multiple dimensions of user meta-information, moderate learning on the traffic characteristics has proved powerful performance in multiple tasks, including flow correlation  , website fingerprinting  [ref]51 , and traffic classification . Prior work mainly learns traffic characteristics from three dimensions, including user profiling  , TLS fingerprinting [ref]2, and flow sequences . User Profiling. User profiling refers to using behavior-based statistical features to construct a user profile. Kumpost et al.  employed the target IP address to create user profiles to identify these users in future traffic. Banse et al.  generate user profiles by collecting user DNS requests and utilize a Bayesian classifier  to track users on the university network. In the case of TLS traffic, Gonzalez et al.  showed that leveraging Server Name Indication (SNI) information could effectively collect user online interests. TLS Fingerprinting. TLS Fingerprinting is a technique that extracts parameters from a TLS ClientHello to provide visibility into the application that creates the session. Applications of TLS fingerprinting include malware detection [ref]3, operating system identification [ref]2, and client identification . Due to the difference in fingerprints of different browsers, it is possible to distinguish users to a certain extent. Several open-source databases have been released include   . Flow Sequences. Flow sequences are the packet timings and packet sizes collected during the user communications. Nasr et al.  exploited flow sequences to link the egress and ingress segments of a Tor connection. Liu et al.  could distinguish the application types of user-generated traffic through the characteristic. These works show the effectiveness of flow sequence for user activity identification. While multi-dimension characteristics could be extracted in TLS encrypted traffic, the complexity of user activity brings extreme difficulty when applied on a large scale. Therefore, prior work is mainly performed on a closed-world dataset, i.e., re-identifying training users on the test set. In this work, we exploit graph-based user profiles to develop the correlation attack model in IPv6 scenarios, achieving strong user correlation on an open-world dataset for unknown users.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: dimensions of user meta-information, moderate learning on the traffic characteristics has proved powerful performance in multiple tasks, including flow correlation  , website fingerprinting  [ref]51 , and traffic classification .
