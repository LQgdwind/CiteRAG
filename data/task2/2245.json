      "content": "Paper Title: Numerical influence of ReLU’(0) on backpropagation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe proof arguments were described in [ref]7 [ref]8. We simply concentrate on justifying how the results described in these works apply to Definition 1 and point the relevant results leading to Theorems 1 and 2. It can be inferred from Definition 1 that all elements in the definition of a ReLUReLU\\mathrm{ReLU} network training problem are piecewise smooth, where each piece is an elementary l​o​g−e​x​p𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑥𝑝log-exp function. We refer the reader to [ref]30 for an introduction to piecewise smoothness and recent use of such notions in the context of algorithmic differentiation in [ref]8. Let us first argue that the results of [ref]8 apply to Definition 1. We start with an explicit selection representation of backprops​ReLUsubscriptbackprop𝑠ReLU\\mathrm{backprop}_{s}\\ \\mathrm{ReLU}. Fix any s∈ℝ𝑠ℝs\\in\\mathbb{R} and consider the three functions f1:x↦0:subscript𝑓1maps-to𝑥0f_{1}\\colon x\\mapsto 0, f2:x↦x:subscript𝑓2maps-to𝑥𝑥f_{2}\\colon x\\mapsto x and f3↦s​xmaps-tosubscript𝑓3𝑠𝑥f_{3}\\mapsto sx with the selection index t​(x)=1𝑡𝑥1t(x)=1 if x<0𝑥0x<0, 222 if x>0𝑥0x>0 and 333 if x=0𝑥0x=0. We have for all x𝑥x Furthermore, differentiating the active selection as in [8, Definition 4] we have and the right hand side is precisely the definition of backprops​ReLUsubscriptbackprop𝑠ReLU\\mathrm{backprop}_{s}\\ \\mathrm{ReLU}. This shows that we have a selection derivative as used in [ref]8. Given a ReLUReLU\\mathrm{ReLU} network training problem as in Definition 1, we have the following property. All elements in the ReLUReLU\\mathrm{ReLU} network training problem are piecewise elementary l​o​g−e​x​p𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑥𝑝log-exp. That is each piece can be identified with an elementary l​o​g−e​x​p𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑥𝑝log-exp function. Furthermore the selection process describing the choice of active function can similarly be described by elementary l​o​g−e​x​p𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑥𝑝log-exp functions with equalities and inequalities. Therefore, we meet the definition of l​o​g−e​x​p𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑥𝑝log-exp selection function in [ref]8 and all corresponding results apply to any ReLUReLU\\mathrm{ReLU} network training problem as given in Definition 1. Fix T≥1𝑇1T\\geq 1, getting back to problem (1), using [8, Definition 5] and the selection derivative described above, for each i=1,…,N𝑖1…𝑁i=1,\\ldots,N, there is a conservative field Di:ℝP⇉ℝP:subscript𝐷𝑖⇉superscriptℝ𝑃superscriptℝ𝑃D_{i}\\colon\\mathbb{R}^{P}\\rightrightarrows\\mathbb{R}^{P} (definition of conservativity is given in [ref]7 and largely described in [ref]8) such that for any s∈[0,T]𝑠0𝑇s\\in[0,T], and θ∈ℝP𝜃superscriptℝ𝑃\\theta\\in\\mathbb{R}^{P} Using [7, Corollary 5] we have Di​(θ)={∇li​(θ)}subscript𝐷𝑖𝜃∇subscript𝑙𝑖𝜃D_{i}(\\theta)=\\{\\nabla l_{i}(\\theta)\\} for all θ𝜃\\theta outside of a finite union of differentiable manifolds of dimension at most P−1𝑃1P-1. This leads to Theorem 1 for s∈[0,T]𝑠0𝑇s\\in[0,T]. Theorem 2 is deduced from the proof of [8, Theorem 7] (last paragraph of the proof) that with probability 111, for all k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N}, for all n=1,…,N𝑛1…𝑁n=1,\\ldots,N and s∈[0,T]𝑠0𝑇s\\in[0,T] since we have θ0,s=θ0subscript𝜃0𝑠subscript𝜃0\\theta_{0,s}=\\theta_{0} for all s𝑠s, the generated sequence in (4) does not depend on s∈[0,T]𝑠0𝑇s\\in[0,T]. This is Theorem 2 for s∈[0,T]𝑠0𝑇s\\in[0,T], note that a similar probabilistic argument was developped in . We may repeat the same arguments fixing T<0𝑇0T<0, so that both results actually hold for all s∈[−T,T]𝑠𝑇𝑇s\\in[-T,T].\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: The proof arguments were described in [ref]7 [ref]8.
