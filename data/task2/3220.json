      "content": "Paper Title: RvS: What is Essential for Offline RL via Supervised Learning?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent offline RL methods use many techniques, including value functions  , dynamics estimation alongisde value functions   , dynamics estimation alone   9, and uncertainty quantification   . In this paper, we focus on offline RL methods based on conditional behavior cloning that avoid value functions.\nThe most common instantiation of these methods are goal-conditioned behavior cloning 8   and reward-conditioned behavior cloning [ref]26 8 5. Prior work has also looked at conditioning on different information, such as many previous timesteps  , tasks inferred by inverse RL 0, and other task information  .\nWhile these methods can be directly applied to the offline RL setting, some prior works combine these methods with iterative data collection 8 8, which is not permitted in the typical offline RL setting.\nKumar et al. [ref]26 study reward-conditioned policies and do present experiments in the offline RL setting. However, in contrast with our work, the results from Kumar et al. [ref]26 suggest that good performance cannot be achieved through RvS learning but only through additional advantage-weighting 2 4. More recent work  presents a conditional imitation learning method for the offline RL setting that avoids advantage weighting by introducing a higher-capacity, autoregressive Transformer policy. In contrast to these prior works,\nwe show that simple conditioning with standard feedforward networks can attain state-of-the-art results. While these results do not require advantage weighting or high-capacity sequence models, they do require careful tuning of the policy capacity.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: based on conditional behavior cloning that avoid value functions.\nThe most common instantiation of these methods are goal-conditioned behavior cloning 8   and reward-conditioned behavior cloning [ref]26 8 5.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
