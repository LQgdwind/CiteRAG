As one of the main sensors deployed in an automated driving system (ADS), a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) scans the surrounding environment and generates a point cloud (PC) X={(xi,yi,zi,i​n​ti)}∈Rn×4𝑋subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖subscript𝑧𝑖𝑖𝑛subscript𝑡𝑖superscript𝑅𝑛4X=\\{(x_{i},y_{i},z_{i},int_{i})\\}\\in R^{n\\times 4}, including n𝑛n points with (xi,yi,zi)subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖subscript𝑧𝑖(x_{i},y_{i},z_{i}) as i𝑖i-th point’s location and i​n​ti𝑖𝑛subscript𝑡𝑖int_{i} as i𝑖i-th point’s intensity, during each detection  [ref]39.\nTechnically, the LiDAR first emits a laser ray consecutive in both horizontal and vertical directions, which then captures the reflected lasers, records their time of flight and light intensity, and further computes the depth and 3D coordinate of the points related to these reflected lasers.\nFinally, the LiDAR collects these information to generate the raw PC, which represents the object surfaces in the surrounding environment, and sends this raw PC to the ADS for downstream processing. 3D Object Detectors.\nDNN-based 3D object detectors empower modern ADS for perceiving and detecting objects in the surrounding environment (i.e., obstacle perception).\nTechnically, a 3D object detector usually takes PC as the input and returns the category and bounding box, a rectangle or cuboid which bounds the detected object to represent its location in a PC, of each perceived object [ref]21.\nIn most cases, 3D object detectors can be regarded as the combination of three modules: the preprocessing, the backbone and the prediction modules. A typical preprocessing module first divides the points of PC into a number of sets (e.g., voxels or pillars) based on specific rules and then calculates the statistical information  [ref]52, or uses DNN models, such as PointNet  or DGCNN , to generate the feature vectors for each point . Then,\nthe backbone module implemented with 2D/3D convolutional neural networks (CNN)   extracts the PC’s features and generates the global feature map. Finally, the prediction module in one-stage 3D object detectors like VoxelNet [ref]52 and PointPillars  directly predicts the bounding box and category of each obstacle based on the global feature map. Differently, in two-stage 3D object detectors like PointRCNN  and PV-RCNN , the prediction module predicts the proposal bounding boxes of objects based on the global feature map and generate a local feature map for each object based on the combination of the global feature map and the related proposal bounding boxes at the first stage, and then the final bounding box and category of each obstacle based on each local feature map at the second stage. Adversarial Example. In general, given a machine learning model F𝐹F and a normal sample x𝑥x with label y𝑦y, an adversarial example x′superscript𝑥′x^{\\prime} is generated from x𝑥x by adding a slight perturbation to mislead the victim model’s prediction while causing no modification to either the model’s architecture or the parameters   .\nAccording to the attack goal, an adversarial example can be further categorized into untargeted and targeted. By definition,\nan untargeted attack aims at misleading the victim model into F​(x′)≠y𝐹superscript𝑥′𝑦F(x^{\\prime})\\neq y, while a targeted attack aims at misleading the victim model into F​(x′)=y′𝐹superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′F(x^{\\prime})=y^{\\prime}, where y′superscript𝑦′y^{\\prime} is the target label specified by attacker.\nAccording to , the targeted adversarial attack can be further represented as the optimization problem: where the objective min⁡‖x−x′‖norm𝑥superscript𝑥′\\min\\|x-x^{\\prime}\\| restricts the region of perturbation (i.e., attack budget) and X𝑋X denotes the input space. In the context of ADS, to cause severe safety issues, several recent adversarial attacks focus on conducting LiDAR spoofing to forge a non-existent object in the detection results of a LiDAR-based object detector, or called appearing attacks, on which we provide a detailed review in Section 3.2.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: including n𝑛n points with (xi,yi,zi)subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖subscript𝑧𝑖(x_{i},y_{i},z_{i}) as i𝑖i-th point’s location and i​n​ti𝑖𝑛subscript𝑡𝑖int_{i} as i𝑖i-th point’s intensity, during each detection  [ref]39.\nTechnically, the LiDAR first emits a laser ray consecutive in both horizontal and vertical directions, which then captures the reflected lasers, records their time of flight and light\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
