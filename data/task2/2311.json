      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey on Deep Learning Event Extraction: Approaches and Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEvent Extraction (EE) is an important yet challenging task in information extraction research. As a particular form of information, an event refers to a specific occurrence of something that happens in a certain time and a certain place involving one or more participants, which can usually be described as a change of state .\nThe event extraction task aims at extracting such event information from unstructured plain texts into a structured form, which mostly describes “who, when, where, what, why” and “how” of real-world events that happened. In terms of application, the task facilitates people to retrieve event information and analyze people’s behaviors, arousing information retrieval  , recommendation  [ref]5, intelligent question answering [ref]6 , knowledge graph construction [ref]8 , and other event-related applications 0 1 2. Event extraction can be divided into two groups: close-domain event extraction 3 4 5 and open-domain event extraction 6 7 8.\nEvents are usually considered in a predefined event schema, where some specific people and objects are interacted at a specific time and place.\nThe close-domain event extraction task aims to find words that belong to a specific event schema, which refers to an action or state change that occurs, and its extraction targets include time, place, person, and action, etc.\nIn the open-domain event extraction task, events are considered as a set of related descriptions of a topic, which can be formulated into a classification or clustering task.\nOpen-domain event extraction refers to acquiring a series of events related to a specific theme, usually composed of multiple events.\nWhether the close-domain or open-domain event extraction task, the purpose of event extraction is to capture the event types that we are interested in from numerous texts and show the essential arguments of events in a structured form. Deep learning event extraction on general domain has a lot of work and has been a relatively mature research taxonomy.\nIt discovers event mentions from texts and extracts events containing event triggers and event arguments, where event mentions are termed as sentences containing one or more triggers and arguments.\nEvent extraction requires to identify the event, classify event type, identify the argument, and judge the argument role.\nSpecifically, trigger identification and trigger classification are usually formed as the event detection task 9 0 1 2, while argument identification and argument role classification are usually defined as an argument extraction task.\nThe trigger classification is a multi-classification classification 3 4 5 task to classify the type of each event.\nThe role classification task is a multi-class classification task based on word pairs, determining the role relationship between any pair of triggers and entities in a sentence.\nFrom a technical perspective, event extraction can depend on some other foundational natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as named entity recognition (NER) 6 7 8, semantic parsing 9 0 1, and relation extraction 2 3 4. We give the flow chart of deep learning event extraction on the general domain, as shown in Fig. 1.\nThe event extraction is to find the focused event type and extract its arguments with it roles.\nFor a pipeline paradigm event extraction, it is necessary to distinguish the event type in the text for a given text, called trigger classification.\nFor different event types, different event schema is designed.\nThen, event arguments are extracted according to the schema, which includes argument identification and argument role classification sub-tasks.\nIn the earliest stage, argument role classification is regarded as a word classification task, and each word in the text is classified.\nIn addition, there are sequence labeling, machine reading comprehension (MRC) and sequence-to-structure generation methods.\nFor a joint paradigm event extraction, the model classifies the event type and argument roles simultaneously to avoid error coming from trigger classification sub-task.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: real-world events that happened. In terms of application, the task facilitates people to retrieve event information and analyze people’s behaviors, arousing information retrieval  , recommendation  [ref]5, intelligent question answering [ref]6 , knowledge graph construction [ref]8 , and other event-related applications 0 1 2. Event extraction can be divided into two groups: close-domain event\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
