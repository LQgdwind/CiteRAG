      "content": "Paper Title: Elucidating Robust Learning with Uncertainty-Aware Corruption Pattern Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the context of robust learning, the label noise patterns can be roughly categorized into two groups, Class-Conditional Noise (CCN) and Instance-Dependent noise (IDN) settings, based on which information the label corruptions are made. Note that the IDN setting is much more practical as it is more natural to assume that the label noise pattern is a function of inputs. Furthermore, the IDN setting can inherently incorporate the CCN setting. Our proposed method can cope with both CCN and IDN settings. While most of the robust learning literature focuses on simply estimating the clean target distribution, a number of works have been recently made on achieving both robustness and the ability to estimate the label noise patterns. One possible approach is to extract a clean subset, then utilize the set to learn the clean target signal. Co-Teaching [ref]6 utilizes two separate networks (a teacher network and a student network) by teaching the student network using the teacher network. Co-Teaching+  extends Co-Teaching by further leveraging the disagreement strategy. JoCoR  is based on Co-Teaching+, which uses a joint loss function of minimizing cross-entropy while maximizing the agreement between two networks to achieve better robustness. DivideMix  leverages a hybrid approach by fitting the loss using a GMM to divide the dataset into the clean labeled set and noisy unlabeled set, then utilizes MixMatch with divided sets for training two separate networks. WarPI  achieves its robustness by adaptively rectifying the training procedure for the classification network within the meta-learning scenario. The other approach is learning the label transition matrix (noise patterns) from noisy data to estimate the clean-class posterior. F-correction  estimates the noise transition matrix and applies it to loss function correction. Dual-T  incorporates a matrix factorization method to avoid directly estimating a noisy class posterior without any anchor points (i.e., clean data). Total variation regularization  effectively regularizes the predicted probability to be more distinguishable by restricting the total variance distance resulting in a better estimation of the noise transition matrix. The IDN setting is more practical than the CCN setting in that it is more natural to assume that the annotator gets confused by ambiguous instances leading to mislabeling. Only recently, a few papers have incorporated confidence estimation and noise transition matrix prediction to handle confusing instances. However, most of the work only uses the confidence estimation to robustly learn clean target distribution in instance-dependent noise settings. Cheng et al. [ref]19 present confidence regularization to prevent overfitting in multi-class classification problems. [ref]19 is further extended in 1 by designing a sample sieve method to get clean instances from the noisy dataset, using confidence regularized cross-entropy loss. The confidence regularized method gives information about the corruption of each instance but does not provide information about label noise patterns. Another approach is to estimate the noise transition matrix instance-wise to correct the loss function. Part-dependent noise (i.e., PDN) was introduced by Xia et al. 2 which approximates the transition matrix by the combination of transition matrices for each instance. Yang et al.3 first collect a predicted clean set to learn the noise transition matrix and then train a classifier with a corrected loss function based on the estimated noise transition matrix. Perhaps, the most similar setting to ours is  which introduced a confidence-scored Instance-Dependent Noise (IDN) setting; a label noise is given based on prior information about confidence score by annotators. It uses both confident estimation and noise transition matrix estimation for robust learning. Then, the model utilizes the corrected loss function using the confidence-based noise transition matrix. However, the proposed Set-Dependent Noise (SDN) setting differs from the confidence-scored Instance-Dependent Noise (IDN) setting in that the annotators can divide the set by the ambiguity measure of each instance, making it more intuitive and straightforward. Furthermore, the proposed method directly estimates both corruption information and the noise distribution without the necessity of training multiple networks. The categorization of robust learning papers is shown in Table 2 The mixture-of-experts models have been widely used in robust learning 7 8 [ref]5. SsSMM 7 incorporates a student-teacher model similar to MentorNet [ref]6, but employs a finite mixture models for student networks, updating via an EM algorithm 9 in semi-supervised manner. For robust learning for language domains, Irie et al. 8 proposed a recurrent adaptive mixture model to represent diverse outputs. ChoiceNet [ref]5 utilizes a mixture density network to model the correlated outputs where the correlation between the target and noisy distributions is estimated in an end-to-end manner. Our proposed method is also based on a mixture-of-experts model; however, a novel uncertainty-aware regularization method is presented.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: achieving both robustness and the ability to estimate the label noise patterns.
