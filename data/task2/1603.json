      "content": "Paper Title: Machine Learning Model Development from a Software Engineering Perspective: A Systematic Literature Review\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe main purpose is to adapt or integrate Machine Learning framework into Software Development processes’ stages, namely: requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. In this context, although there are some papers such as Nascimento et al.  that have developed Machine Learning Model workflows, the work of Amershi et al.  presented the most comprehensive and accepted Machine Learning workflow which was mentioned and used in other articles (such as Correia et al. ). The stages addressed in terms of Machine Learning Model Development were: A Model requirements stage which is related to the agreement between stakeholders and the way the model should work. Data processing stage which involves data collection, cleaning and labelling (in case of supervised learning). Feature engineering stage which involves the modification of the selected data. Model training stage which is related to the way the selected model is trained and tuned on the (labeled) data. Model evaluation stage which regards to the measurements used in order to evaluate the model. Model deployment stage which includes deploying, monitoring and maintaining the model. Nascimento et al.  conducted a survey with 6 Brazilian software companies reaching the conclusion about ML development following a 4-stage process in these companies (understanding the problems, data handling, model building, and model monitoring). The work of Banimustafa and Hardy 0 is a practical application of a proposed scientific data mining process model in data mining, more specifically in metabolomics. The model was inspired by Software Engineering (among other fields) and although the paper proposes specific workflow stages (such as: data pre-processing, Data Exploration, Technique Selection, Knowledge Evaluation, Deployment, and Process Evaluation), the authors pointed out that the proposed framework could be generalized in order to perform data mining in other scientific disciplines. The work of Gotz et al. 4 addresses the challenges that arise when trying to adopt traditional Software Engineering practices in Machine Learning Modeling, since the authors identified issues regarding the requirements design stage, as well as differences between traditional software systems and Machine Learning models’ lifecycles and workflows. The work of Hutchinson et al. \nfocuses on the Data Processing stage but also approaches other stages of the Machine Learning Workflow such as Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing and Maintenance. The main goal of the author is to better understand the processes that generate the development of data and highlight the importance of adopting practices that enable accountability throughout the data development lifecycle. Singla, Bose and Naik 1 studied the logs related to software engineering following the agile methodology for a machine learning team and compared it with the logs for a non-machine learning team, analyzing the trends and their reasons. The authors then provided a few suggestions about the way Agile could have a better use for machine learning teams and projects. The work of Kriens and Verleben 2 which is one of the few we found that was done from a Software Enginering perspective, also proposes a Machine Learning Workflow based/inspired by the stages of the Software Engineering lifecycle. However, the Worklflow’s stages of this work are different from the one proposed by Amershi et al. . The work by Lo et al. 3 is the part of the group consisting of a number of papers which have a software engineering perspective. Although the authors proposed a cyclical workflow for Federated ML (Background understanding, Requirements Analysis, Architecture Design, Implementation and Evaluation, and back to Background understanding), the article also mentions well-known machine learning stages such as: data collection, data pre-processing, feature engineering, model training, and model deployment. It is worth mentioning that the paper also deals with anomaly detection, which is a ML technique.\nAmong the findings, they have highlighted that the most discussed phase is model training. They have also found that “only a few studies cover data pre-processing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and only Google has discussions about model deployment (e.g., deployment strategies) and model inference. Model monitoring (e.g., dealing with performance degradation), and project management (e.g., model versioning) are not discussed in the existing studies.” In the work of Hesenius et al.  the authors argue that developing ML/AI applications is typically a subproject of an overarching development cycle, thus feedback loops and connections are needed to integrate all activities. Consequently, they introduce their own proposed workflow for engineering data-driven applications, describe the roles team members take, and finally describe how different phases are structured, namely: Developing and Understanding the Application Domain; Creating a Target Data Set; Data Cleaning and Pre-processing ,Data Reduction and Projection; Choosing the Data Mining Task; Choosing the Data Mining Algorithm; Data Mining; Interpreting Mined Patterns; and Consolidating Discovered Knowledge. Rahman et al. 4 presented an industrial case study, in which they apply machine learning (ML) to automatically detect transaction errors and propose corrections. The authors identified and discussed the challenges that they faced during this collaborative research and development project from three distinct perspectives: Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and industry-academia collaboration. In this way the work addresses the Software Engineering stages (requirements engineering, Design, Implementation, Integration, Testing, Deployment), Machine Learning Development Workflow stages (Problem Formulation, Data Acquisition, Pre-processing, Feature Extraction, Model Building, Evaluation, Integration and Deployment, Model Management, and AI Ethics) and Industry-academia Collaboration stages (Problem Understanding, Knowledge Transfer, Focus on objectives, Professional Practice, and Privacy and Security). It is also worth mentioning that the authors have adopted the Agile approach for Research and Development. The work by Reimann and Kniesel-Wünsche [ref]7 compare ML Workflows (with similar stages to the ones mentioned by Amershi et al. against traditional SE Workflows in order to address the lack of guidance in what currently used development environments and ML APIs offer developers of ML applications and contrast these with software engineering best practices to identify gaps in the current state of the art. We have also found other articles focusing on specific stages of the Software Engineering lifecycle or the Machine Learning Workflow such as 3, 5, 0, and 2. Some of these papers will be also addressed in the Gap section (RQ4).\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Professional Practice, and Privacy and Security).
