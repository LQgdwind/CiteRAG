      "content": "Paper Title: Quadratic Approximation Manifold for Mitigating the Kolmogorov Barrier in Nonlinear Projection-Based Model Order Reduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Kolmogorov n𝑛n-width of a subspace ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} of dimension n𝑛n is defined as where 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y} is a linear subspace . Effectively, the combination of the supremum and second infimum determines the maximum distance in a 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y}-norm between the\nlines y𝑦y and ynsubscript𝑦𝑛y_{n} when projecting points in ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} onto an n𝑛n-dimensional subspace of 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y}. It is a useful concept for determining the extent to which, for a fixed size n𝑛n of the ROB,\nthe traditional PROM approximation (3) can accurately represent the solution associated with a given HDM. It is equally useful concept for predicting computational efficiency, as for a\nhyperreduced nonlinear PROM (HPROM) whose underlying HDM is grounded in a PDE, the online solution time scales primarily with the dimension n𝑛n of the PROM as well as with the size of the reduced mesh. In the context of a PROM or HPROM whose underlying HDM is grounded in a PDE, the rate of convergence of the Kolmogorov n𝑛n-width depends on the mathematical type of the PDE. The most optimistic case corresponds to a subset\nof linear coercive problems: in this case, dn​(ℳ)≤C​e−β​nsubscript𝑑𝑛ℳ𝐶superscript𝑒𝛽𝑛d_{n}(\\mathcal{M})\\leq Ce^{-\\beta n}, where 0<C<∞0𝐶0<C<\\infty and β>0𝛽0\\beta>0 [ref]40. For such problems, very low-dimensional\nPROMs can deliver an acceptable accuracy. For an HDM grounded in a nonlinear hyperbolic PDE, the decay of the n𝑛n-width of an associated PROM may be much slower: in some cases,\ndn​(ℳ)≤1/4​(n−1/2)subscript𝑑𝑛ℳ14superscript𝑛12d_{n}(\\mathcal{M})\\leq 1/4\\left(n^{-1/2}\\right) , which explains why for such HDMs the Kolmogorov n𝑛n-width is often referred to in the\nliterature as a barrier to reducibility. For example, for a discrete HDM of dimension greater than N=17×106𝑁17superscript106N=17\\times 10^{6} of the convection-dominated turbulent flow around the Ahmed\nbody , which is a popular benchmark CFD problem in the automotive industry, an unsteady LSPG PROM – and therefore a PROM parameterized by time only – based on the traditional global\nsubspace approximation (3) requires a dimension n≈600𝑛600n\\approx 600 to achieve sufficient accuracy . On the other hand, an LSGP PROM based on a 100-subdomain\npartition of the solution manifold and the piece-wise affine approximation approach proposed in  achieves the same level of accuracy using an average dimension\nn≈11𝑛11n\\approx 11. However, as explained in Section 1, in the context of a high-dimensional parameter space 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}, an LSPG PROM based on the same piece-wise affine approximation can\nbe expected to require a much larger average dimension n𝑛n and potentially be unafforable. For this reason, for nonlinear, convection-dominated, first-order hyperbolic problems, there is a significant\ninterest in developing alternative, more efficient nonlinear approximation manifolds for PMOR.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: case corresponds to a subset\nof linear coercive problems: in this case, dn​(ℳ)≤C​e−β​nsubscript𝑑𝑛ℳ𝐶superscript𝑒𝛽𝑛d_{n}(\\mathcal{M})\\leq Ce^{-\\beta n}, where 0<C<∞0𝐶0<C<\\infty and β>0𝛽0\\beta>0 [ref]40.
