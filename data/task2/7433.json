Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

We detail the full hyperparameter settings of our experiments in Appendix A.1.1. \nDatasets: For RoBERTa-large, we consider classification datasets: SST-2, SST-5, SNLI[ref]2, MNLI and TREC. We randomly samples 1000 examples for testing amd have 512 examples per class for both training and validation.\nFor OPT experiments, we consider the SuperGLUE dataset collection including: CB, BoolQ, MultiRC and ReCoRD. We also include SST-2 in our experiments. We randomly sample 1024 examples for training, 500 examples for validation and 1000 examples for testing.\nModels We conduct experiments on both masked language model (RoBERTa-large, 350M ), autoregressive language model (OPT-2.7B), and LLaMA-7B (to be completed) and GPT-neo-1.3B (to be completed) in few-shot settings. We present our main results in Table 3,4. We include a range of ablation studies, including varying the dataset size and the pruning rate.\nWe also explore both full-parameter tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning like prefix-tuning. We present our main results in \nPrivacy Budgets: We consider various privacy levels with ϵ=[ref]2 [ref]4 [ref]8italic-ϵ248\\epsilon=[ref]2 [ref]4 [ref]8 and dynamic δ=1/n𝛿1𝑛\\delta=1/n where n𝑛n is the number of private data for (ϵ,δ)italic-ϵ𝛿(\\epsilon,\\delta)-DP. We also include ϵ=∞italic-ϵ\\epsilon=\\infty baseline that is trained without adding DP noise. In our experiments, we set the clipping threshold to C=30𝐶30C=30. We include the zero-shot does not incur any privacy loss because we evaluate the pre-trained model directly without finetuning on private data.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: that runs with random seed=42.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
