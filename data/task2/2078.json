      "content": "Paper Title: A systematic review of Hate Speech automatic detection using Natural Language Processing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRegarding the datasets, we found 69 datasets in 21 different languages. In this section, we summarize the most used dataset attributes and statistics in Tables 11 and 12. This includes dataset names (some names are based on papers title), publication year, dataset source link 161616All datasets’ link last access was on 03-march-2021, dataset sizes, the ratio of offensive contents, the class used for annotation, and datasets’ language. We noticed that many authors collected their datasets from social media and then annotated them manually based on task requirements. Several annotations have been carried out with experts   , native speakers [ref]49, volunteer , or through crowd-sourcing from anonymous users [ref]34[ref]153. Below we present the primary findings of this analysis. I) Datasets language and platform: Among 69 datasets of 21 different languages, see Figure 16], English dominates by far others, representing 26 datasets alone. However, Arabic, German, Hind-English, Indonesian and Italian are represented in a total of 6, 3, 4, 4 and 5 open datasets, respectively. The rest of the languages have low presence in this set of open dataset. All datasets were collected from different social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, etc.), with exception to Chung et al. ’s dataset where some portion were synthetically produced. Twitter is shown to be the most popular platform for collecting hate speech datasets (45% of total datasets were collected from Twitter). Facebook is the second most popular source. The rest of the SM has only been used few times. An interesting code-mixed dataset by Mathur et al. would be an example for targeting users who are active in SM and use the mixed form of language. This dataset has highlighted the predominance of Hindi–English code–mixed data representing the large spread of mixed forms and Hindi words written in Latin script in a non-formal online communication among Indians SM users. Similar code-mixed dataset work is also done in Tamil-English and Malayalam-English using BERT, which achieved a 90% F1 score . (II) Datasets sources: Most of the dataset source repositories are available on GitHub. Therefore, nearly all datasets were publicly available. However, those dataset collected from Twitter have only Twitter Id instances which should be used to retrieve the full tweet messages. Since many tweets might be deleted over time, one may expect that the reconstruction of the full dataset may not be possible. (III) Annotation classes: Figure 17 illustrates the diversity of annotations in the original datasets (e.g., hate, offensive, race, gender, sexism, misogyny, toxicity, group. target, political, etc.). This diversity of annotations translates the variety of hate speech categories and the academic willingness to explore this rich panorama. However, from Tab. 11 and 12, one notices that most of these annotations were based on binary classification (e.g., hate versus non-hate, racism versus non-racism, etc.)  2  [ref]49. Ternary class levels as well (e.g., Hate, Abusive, Normal) are explored in  [ref]1532. Some authors used a larger number of classes and sub-classes (up to six) as in 3.\nIn summary, one can distinguish three strategies of annotation scheme. The first one is a binary scheme: two mutually exclusive events (typically yes/no) to mark the presence or absence of HS (or a category of HS). The second one advocates a non-binary scheme with a fixed number of mutually exclusive classes, accounting either for different shades of a given HS category, such as strong hate, weak hate, no hate , overtly aggressive, covertly aggressive, not aggressive , or for several classes at the same time, such as racism, sexism, racism and sexism, none . The third strategy features multi-level annotation, with finer-grained schemes accounting, for instance, for the type of hate speech, its severity, and the target group. This is the most complex annotation scheme and typically involves several different traits and a scale of variation. For example, Gomez et al. distinguish between racist, sexist, homophobic, religion-based attack, as well as the community targeted by the attack in the annotation process. Nobata et al.  discriminate between clean and abusive language, where abusive is labeled as hate speech, derogatory or profane. Basile et al.  adopt a three-layer binary annotation for HS, aggressiveness, and nature of the target (individual or group). (IV) Dataset size and ratio of abusive contents: Figure 18 and 19 show the statistic of dataset size and the ratio of offensive content, respectively. We can see 41% of datasets are relatively of a small size (only (0-5)k posts). 14% have (5-10)k sentences. Therefore, most of the dataset (55%) can be cast into a very small size category, indicating the challenges behind acquiring large-scale labeled data for hate speech detection purpose. On the other hand, we have not found any balance dataset. This can lead to overfitting and harm generalisability, especially for deep learning models . Another critical factor that may affect the training process of the model is the ratio of classes. In this regards, we noticed a high number (37%) of the datasets contain significantly less than 20% of offensive content. However, the rest of the datasets ( 63%) have more than 20% offensive content, which could be considered as decent for training purposes. (V) Number of Citations171717All citations last updated on 03-Mar-2021:\nWe collected the number of citations for each dataset source document in Google Scholar and concluded that most dataset sources were cited more than 50 times (Figure 20). Davidson et al. [ref]34 is the most cited papers that have presented a dataset of 24802 tweets, which are manually annotated by CrowdFlower (CF) workers. Workers were asked to label each tweet as one of three categories: hate speech, offensive but not hate-speech, or neither offensive nor hate speech. Three or more people participated in each tweet annotation process. They have used the majority decision for each tweet to assign a label. This dataset has only 6% hate speech, 76% offensive but non-hate, and the rest of the tweets were neutral. The second most cited dataset created by Waseem and Hovy  contains 16,914 tweets where 3,383 are related to sexist, 1,972 to racist, and 11,559 to neither sexist nor racist. The authors manually annotated their dataset, after which it was sent to an outside annotator (a 25 year old woman studying gender studies and a nonactivist feminist) to review their annotation.\n\n The above two popular datasets provide some insights into the dataset annotation process and criteria. We also noticed that the citation index does not reflect the quality of the dataset itself, but rather its ease and simplicity, which motivated other researchers to test such dataset in their proposals. There could be many possible factors that may represent the quality of a dataset (e.g., annotation criteria, label definitions, understanding perception, dataset size, the ratio of classes). However, we do not have sufficient experimental evidence to compare these dataset quality indices across various HS domains. To the best of our knowledge, only one study found in our search attempted to estimate the quality metrics and the similarity between datasets. In this respect, Fortuna et al.  compared the categories across the annotated dataset with respect to both similarity to other categories and homogeneity. For this purpose, average FastText embedding pretrained on Wikipedia was used to represent each category, while intra-dataset class homogeneity index has been put forward to assess category homogeneity. One of their observations is that Davidson’s [ref]34 \"hate speech\" is very different from Waseem’s  \"hate speech\", \"racism\", \"sexism\", while being relatively close to Basile’s HS dataset . One of the main conclusions of their experiments is that many different definitions are being used for equivalent concepts, which makes most of the publicly available datasets incompatible.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: that many authors collected their datasets from social media and then annotated them manually based on task requirements.
