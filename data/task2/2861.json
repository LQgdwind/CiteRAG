      "content": "Paper Title: Structured Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Traffic Flow Estimation of Large Cloud Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral approaches have been proposed recently for traffic matrix estimation.\nAmong them dimensionality reduction techniques are the most popular and they are the focus of this paper. The reason why dimensionality reduction techniques can be employed in network traffic estimation is because\n\n\n(1) the backbone Internet traffic is highly concentrated, that is, most of the OD flows use only few links of the network, and\n\n(2) OD flows have spatial and temporal similarities, that is, nearby OD pairs have similar traffic and OD flows have diurnal cycles. \n\nSoule et al.  proposed to employ the singular value decomposition (SVD) , a well-known unconstrained dimensionality reduction technique, to develop a traffic estimation model. A disadvantage of their model is that it uses the\nMoore-Penrose pseudoinverse hence requiring an additional step to suppress possible negative OD flows in the initial estimate of the model.\nIn , Kumar et al. proposed a traffic estimation model based on a relatively new unconstrained dimensionality reduction technique known as CUR . Its key benefits over SVD are mainly computational efficiency and the interpretability of the low-rank factors that are directly derived from the given data.\nRecently, Qazi et al.  proposed to use the demand matrix and the traffic probability matrix pair to transform the ill-posed traffic estimation problem into an equivalent well-posed problem. However, the two proposed methods   suffer from the limitations similar to that of  due to the use of the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. Some researchers have shown keen interest in different neural network architectures to design an effective model for traffic flow estimation. For example, Jiang et al. in  proposed to employ feed forward neural network (FFNN) for traffic flow estimation modeling. The proposed model BPTME takes link flows as input to FFNN whereas OD flows are yielded as output by the network. The network is trained by back error propagation algorithm. Zhou et al. in  proposed an enhancement over BPTME  by injecting the routing information into the FFNN as input for improved performance. Due to the architectural simplicity, FFNN does not scale well with size, complexity and dynamics of traffic flows in the modern networks, hence Nie et al  proposed to a traffic flow estimation model based on deep belief network (DBN). In , Zhao et al. used long short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN). DLTMP  is found to perform better compared to the contemporary approaches in capturing spatiotemporal dependencies of traffic flows because LSTM-RNN has cyclic connections over time. Genetic or evolutionary algorithms are also utilized by some researchers in the context of traffic flow estimation  . These typically employ quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO). In , Lu et al. used multi-fractal discrete wavelet transform (MDWT) to split traffic matrix into different frequency component then train the neural network to predict low and high frequency component of traffic matrix. Kumar et al. in [ref]21 proposed a multi-view subspace learning technique for traffic flow estimation. They proposed a novel robust approach to obtain traffic flows from multiple traffic views yielded from rather inexpensive existing methods. In this paper, we consider graph embedding and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to perform traffic flow estimation.\nGraph embedding has been successfully applied in various research fields such as computer vision and recommender systems. Interested readers may refer to the recent survey paper  by Cai et al. on graph embedding for further details. Emami et al.  have recently used graph embedding in the context of traffic flow estimation. Their approach blends graph embedding with convolution neural network (CNN) for better traffic flow estimation.\nMoreover, graph embedding has also been used by several researchers in combination with matrix factorization. A seminal research work in the context of NMF along with graph embedding is  by Cai et al.\nRoughan et al.  have used classical NMF in the scenario of network traffic flow estimation. An autoregression based approach has been proposed recently for capturing temporal dependencies in [ref]26\nby Yu et al. This autoregressive approach maps the high-dimensional time series data into a low-dimensional latent time series. To avoid overfitting, each latent timeseries is autoregressed independently. Further, the authors of [ref]26 proved that their proposed autoregressive approach has an equivalent graph representation, thus conventional solvers used for graph embedding approaches can be used for this autoregression approach as well.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: wavelet transform (MDWT) to split traffic matrix into different frequency component then train the neural network to predict low and high frequency component of traffic matrix.
