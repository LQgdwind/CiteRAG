      "content": "Paper Title: One Transformer for All Time Series: Representing and Training with Time-Dependent Heterogeneous Tabular Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, different works have focused on using deep networks for tabular data.\nFor instance, Lyu et al.  propose an architecture which combines different modules\n(meta-embeddings, automatic discretization\nand aggregation) and can represent both numerical and categorical features.\nBorisov\net al.  use a distillation approach\nto map\ndecision trees, trained on heterogeneous tabular data, onto homogeneous vectors which are fed to a deep network.\nShankaranarayana and\nRunje  represent the time stamp as a sequence of different fields (e.g., the year, the month, etc.), each of which separately embedded and then summed together. We follow a similar paradigm when representing time, but we do not sum the corresponding embeddings.\nHuang\net al. [ref]16 represent categorical features using an attribute specific embedding which is used as a prefix, concatenated with the actual field value.\nSchäfl\net al.  use a non-parametric representation of the training data, which reminds the use of external networks in Transformers .\nOther recent works use modern Transformer architectures to represent tabular data\n [ref]20 [ref]16 . However, these approaches still underperform standard, non Deep Learning based methods [ref]16 [ref]20, such as Gradient Boosted Decision Trees .\nMoreover, they usually represent numerical/categorical features in a relatively simple way, e.g., using a linear embedding layer or a quantization method, which we show is suboptimal. Finally, most of previous work\ndealing with\ntabular data does not model the temporal dynamics: each row in the table is an individual sample.\nConversely, in this paper we focus on the more general case in which the rows are concatenated into a sequence (a time series) representing the temporal evolution of the data, similarly to frames in a video. Another interesting line of work is based on directly or indirectly using natural language-based “interfaces” between the tabular data and a Transformer. For instance, in LUNA , numerical values are represented as an atomic natural language string.\nSimilarly, Solatorio and\nDupriez  represent numerical faetures using textual tokens.\nOther works create a bridge between tabular data and Foundation Models  and use a zero/few-shot learning paradigm based on textual prompts.\nFor instance,\nNarayan\net al. [ref]25 transform numerical and categorical field values and attribute names in a natural-language prompt, and then they adopt a pre-trained GPT-3 language model  as a few/zero shot learner.\nHowever, the type of data used is relatively simple and should be described as a pair of attribute-value (without a temporal dynamics).\nIn the context of synthetic tabular data generation, a similar strategy is adopted in , where syntactically correct natural language\nsentences are created using the feature names and the row values.\nSimilarly, Jiang et al.  develop a set of interfaces which are used to query a tabular dataset. The retrieved column names and values are then transformed in a textual prompt which is fed to a pre-trained large language\nmodel.\nHowever, apart from the lack of a temporal dynamics representation, there are some major issues in using a prompt for a large language\nmodel. The first is that a prompt can represent a few domain specific samples but it cannot describe a dataset of thousands or millions of rows, and when a sufficiently large dataset of tabular data is available, training a specialized Transformer can lead to a performance largely superior to a few-shot reasoning scenario [ref]25.\nThe second is that, as observed by Narayan\net al. [ref]25, tabular attributes and field values frequently contain jargon terms not commonly found in textual documents, and, in these cases, a foundation model\nlacks a strong semantic understanding of the input\nand has difficulty reasoning over these data which are out of its training distribution. In this work, we train a specialized Transformer on large datasets of tabular data, and we use it to represent both the data heterogeneity and the dynamics of the time series\n.\nSpecifically, the work which is the closest to our proposal is TabBERT , in which the authors propose a hierarchical network to efficiently represent tabular time series (Sections 1 and 3).\nHowever, our proposal differs from TabBERT in different aspects, the main of which are: (1) While in TabBERT numerical features are discretized in bins when input to the network, we propose a frequency-based embedding representation, (2) When training the network, we decouple the input and the output representations similarly to BEiT ,\nand we propose a Neighborhood-based label smoothing, (3) Our network architecture can represent time series in which each row is an ensemble of possibly different attributes, this way dealing with real life complex datasets. In our experiments, we use TabBERT as the main baseline and we show that UniTTab significantly outperforms TabBERT, as well as all the other tested state-of-the-art models, in all the tested scenarios.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: year, the month, etc.), each of which separately embedded and then summed together. We follow a similar paradigm when representing time, but we do not sum the corresponding embeddings.\nHuang\net al. [ref]16 represent categorical features using an attribute specific embedding which is used as a prefix, concatenated with the actual field value.\nSchäfl\net al.  use a non-parametric representation of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
