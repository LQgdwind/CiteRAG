      "content": "Paper Title: Sample-Efficient Learning of Stackelberg Equilibria in General-Sum Games\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReal-world problems such as economic design and policy making can often be modeled as multi-agent games that involves two levels of thinking: The policy maker—as a player in this game—needs to reason about the other player’s optimal behaviors given her decision, in order to inform her own optimal decision making. Consider for example the optimal taxation problem in the AI Economist , a game modeling a real-world social-economic system involving a leader (e.g. the government) and a group of interacting followers (e.g. citizens). The leader sets a tax rate which determines an economics-like game for the followers; the followers then play in this game with the objective to maximize their own reward (such as individual productivity). However, the goal of the leader is to maximize her own reward (such as overall equality) which is in general different from the followers’ rewards, making these games general-sum [ref]38. Such two-level thinking appears broadly in other applications as well such as in automated mechanism design  , optimal auctions  [ref]14, security games , reward shaping , and so on. Another key feature in such games is that the players are asymmetric, and they act in turns: the leader first plays, then the follower sees the leader’s action and then adapts to it. This makes symmetric solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium  not always appropriate. A more natural solution concept for these games is the Stackelberg equilibrium: the leader’s optimal strategy, assuming the followers play their best response to the leader  . The Stackelberg equlibrium is often the desired solution concept in many of the aforementioned applications. Furthermore, it is of compelling interest to understand the learning of Stackelberg equilibria from samples, as it is often the case that we can only learn about the game through interactively deploying policies and observing the (noisy) feedback from the game . This may be the case even when the game rules are perfectly known but not yet represented in a desired form, as argued in the line of work on empirical game theory 0  . Despite the motivations, theoretical studies of learning Stackelberg equilibria in general-sum games remain open, in particular when we can only learn from noisy samples of the rewards. A line of work provides guarantees for finding Stackelberg equilibria in general-sum games, but restricts attention to either the full observation setting (so that the exact game is observable) or with an exact best-response oracle    . These results lay out a foundation for analyzing the Stackelberg equilibrium, but do not generalize to the bandit feedback setting in which the game can only be learned from random samples of the rewards. Another line of work considers the sample complexity of learning the Nash equilibrium in Markov games     1 2, which also do not imply algorithms for finding the Stackelberg equilibrium in these games as the Nash is in general different from the Stackelberg equilibrium in general-sum games. In this work, we study the sample complexity of learning Stackelberg equilibrium in general-sum games. We focus on general-sum games with two players (one leader and one follower), in which we wish to learn an approximate Stackelberg equilbrium for the leader from random samples. Our contributions can be summarized as follows. As a warm-up, we consider bandit games in which the two players play an action in turns and observe their own rewards. We identify a fundamental gap between the exact Stackelberg value and its estimated version from finite samples, which cannot be closed information-theoretically regardless of the algorithm (Section 3.1).\nWe then propose a rigorous definition 𝗀𝖺𝗉εsubscript𝗀𝖺𝗉𝜀{\\sf gap}_{\\varepsilon} for this gap, and show that it is possible to sample-efficiently learn the (𝗀𝖺𝗉ε+ε)subscript𝗀𝖺𝗉𝜀𝜀({\\sf gap}_{\\varepsilon}+\\varepsilon)-approximate Stackelberg\nequilibrium with O~​(A​B/ε2)~𝑂𝐴𝐵superscript𝜀2\\widetilde{O}(AB/\\varepsilon^{2}) samples, where A,B𝐴𝐵A,B are the number of actions for the two players. We further show a matching lower bound Ω​(A​B/ε2)Ω𝐴𝐵superscript𝜀2\\Omega(AB/\\varepsilon^{2}) (Section 3.2). We also establish similar results for learning Stackelberg in simultaneous matrix games (Appendix B). We consider bandit-RL games in which the leader’s action determines an episodic Markov Decision Process (MDP) for the follower. We show that a (𝗀𝖺𝗉ε+ε)subscript𝗀𝖺𝗉𝜀𝜀({\\sf gap}_{\\varepsilon}+\\varepsilon) approximate Stackelberg equilibrium for the leader can be found in O~​(H5​S2​A​B/ε2)~𝑂superscript𝐻5superscript𝑆2𝐴𝐵superscript𝜀2\\widetilde{O}(H^{5}S^{2}AB/\\varepsilon^{2}) episodes of play, where H,S𝐻𝑆H,S are the horizon length and number of states for the follower’s MDP, and A,B𝐴𝐵A,B are the number of actions for the two players (Section 4). Our algorithm utilizes recently developed reward-free reinforcement learning techniques to enable fast exploration for the follower within the MDPs. Finally, we consider linear bandit games in which the action spaces for the two players can be arbitrarily large, but the reward is a linear function of a d𝑑d-dimensional feature representation of the actions. We design an algorithm that achieves O~​(d2/ε2)~𝑂superscript𝑑2superscript𝜀2\\widetilde{O}(d^{2}/\\varepsilon^{2}) sample complexity upper bound for linear bandit games (Section 5). This only depends polynomially on the feature dimension instead of the size of the action spaces, and has at most an O~​(d)~𝑂𝑑\\widetilde{O}(d) gap from the lower bound.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: productivity).
