      "content": "Paper Title: Evolving Constrained Reinforcement Learning Policy\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEAs have been successfully applied to solve various RL problems. A comprehensive survey is referred to  . Evolutionary strategies (ES) , a type of EAs for numerical optimisation, are often used to train neural network policies for RL tasks such as Atari games   and unit commitment problem . Instead of calculating the gradients, ES directly searches for the optimal weights of neural networks, where each individual represents the parameters of a network. The best individual in the evolved population is often selected as the final agent. Khadka and Tumer [ref]5 also used an EA to evolve weights of neural networks, however, different to the aforementioned works, none of those networks is directly used as the final agent. In other words, the EA is not used to directly search for optimal policies. ERL evolves a population of parameterised actors instead of whole RL agents [ref]5. At each generation, the actors interact with the environment to collect experiences. Actors with better fitness values, calculated based on rewards, have a larger probability to be selected as parents. Mutation and crossover operators are applied to the selected individuals to reproduce new individuals (i.e., actors). An additional RL agent, called “learner” in the work of [ref]5, is trained simultaneously using the experiences sampled by the actors in the population for better diversity. Periodically, the learner injects its gradient information into the EA by replacing the worst individual with its actor for better convergence [ref]5. The remarkable performance of ERL was observed compared with other RL algorithms, as well as its efficient computation allocation and parallel learning [ref]5 [ref]24. CEM-RL  combines cross-entropy method (CEM) with delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3). Instead of using genetic operators, CEM-RL samples individuals from the estimated distribution and no actor executes during the process. Bodnar et al.  improve the genetic operators with local replay memories and critic of RL. Genetic algorithm (GA) is also combined with an RL algorithm  where individuals are only generated by noisy mutation. ERL [ref]5 tackles the temporal credit assignment problem and improves exploration efficiency.\nIt is also worth mentioning that the work of  presents a differential evolutionary algorithm with Q-learning, which uses Q-learning to choose the genetic operator during optimisation. The work of  considers evolutionary continuous constraint optimisation while our approach focuses on CRL, which is a sequential decision problem. Although sharing a similar title, our work and  actually differ in the problem setting and algorithm. To our best knowledge, none of the aforementioned work based on ERL addresses CRL problems considered in this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: optimal weights of neural networks, where each individual represents the parameters of a network.
