      "content": "Paper Title: Benchmarking Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Models through the Lens of Interpretability\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe need to estimate the effects of actions – such as treatments, policies and other interventions – is ubiquitous in many domains, ranging from economics to medicine. Many applications where treatment effects are of interest additionally operate under high stakes, for example treatment decisions in a hospital setting – making it particularly important that estimates leading to individual decisions are reliable. As interest in designing personalized treatments is growing across fields, a substantial literature on learning treatment effect heterogeneity has emerged in machine learning (ML) in recent years. In this context, a plethora of sophisticated methods for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE) and/or an individuals potential outcomes (POs) under different treatments have been proposed in the recent ML literature (see e.g. ), all aiming to improve the precision in estimating effects. In particular, recent work has produced both model-agnostic estimation strategies, which can incorporate any ML method into the estimation of effects   , and model-specific strategies, which adapt specific ML methods to the treatment effect estimation problem – for example random forests  [ref]6, gaussian processes   and, most predominantly, neural networks  [ref]9 0 1 2 3. Despite the growing interest in such methods, 4 noted that their evaluation has been quite one-dimensional: Most, if not all, of this work has focussed on assessing performance of proposed algorithms in terms of the Precision of Estimating Heterogeneous Effects (PEHE) criterion of 5, which measures the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the estimated CATE function on a test-set. However, in many applications, black-box predictions of expected treatment effects do not suffice: in the context of drug development, for example, it is at least equally important to assess whether an algorithm discovers the correct drivers of the underlying effect heterogeneity or leads to the right interpretation thereof 6. Such interpretation could also be important in clinical practice e.g. when explaining treatment recommendations derived from an estimated CATE function. In this paper, we therefore leverage recent advances in explainable artificial intelligence 7 8 9 to interpret the discoveries of ML-based CATE estimators, and propose a benchmarking environment which we use to provide insight into the performance of different learning strategies in discovering drivers of heterogeneity. Related work.  How to interpret CATE estimators has received little attention in the ML literature thus far. Some work implicitly enables interpretation by relying on methods that are inherently more interpretable, e.g. linear regressions 0 1 or tree-based models 2 3. Another recent stream of work explicitly focuses on interpretability, similarly proposing the use of methods that are inherently interpretable: 4 rely on decision lists, 5 construct interpretable hyper-boxes for matching, 6 use causal rule ensembles, 7 use mixture models with sparse components, 8 use the fused lasso for estimation of subgroup piece-wise constant treatment effects and 9 rely on an additive neural network architecture. With a goal similar to our work, 6 investigate how well different forest-based CATE estimation strategies discover effect modifiers, but they rely on variable importance scores inherent to random forests to do so. To the best of our knowledge, the only work that considers post-hoc interpretability of already fitted, arbitrary black-box CATE models uses model distillation approaches to do so: 0 use the fitted black-box CATE estimator as a “teacher” and a multi-task decision tree as an interpretable “student” and similarly, 1 propose to create interpretable CATE estimators by fitting an arbitrary interpretable model on top of the potential outcome predictions of a NN-based first stage estimator. Such approaches do not provide an interpretation of the black-box output directly and therefore need to rely on the interpretable student model being good enough to cover the complexities of the original estimator. In this paper, we take a different approach and consider the use of post-hoc feature importance methods to interpret black-box CATE estimators directly. Contributions & Outlook. Our contributions are threefold:  1 we study how to interpret black-box CATE estimators and use this to evaluate them along a new and important dimension that has been overlooked in previous work – namely, their ability to correctly discover drivers of effect heterogeneity –,  2 we propose a benchmark environment to do so, and  3 we provide new insights into the performance of existing methods on this new task. We proceed as follows: We begin by recalling fundamentals of the CATE estimation setting and discuss its unique characteristics in Section 2. In Section 3, we review feature importance methods and discuss how they can be applied to interpret what CATE estimators have learned about treatment effect heterogeneity, with the ultimate goal to compare different CATE estimators on their ability to identify predictive covariates/features (i.e. covariates that determine differential responses to treatment and, hence, are the ones that truly matter when estimating treatment effects). In Section 4, we then introduce a new benchmark environment for evaluating black-box CATE estimators, supplemented with feature importance methods to interpret their output, on precisely this task. This ITErpretability benchmark, as illustrated in Figure 1, can be used with any covariates dataset and is semi-synthetic: it relies on real covariates with synthetic treatment assignment and outcomes, supplying us with otherwise unavailable ground-truth access to predictive covariates. Finally, in Section  5, we use this benchmark to investigate the performance of existing, neural network-based, CATE estimation strategies on this new task, and provide interesting insights into the impact of typical difficulties in CATE problems:  1 the strength of predictive relative to prognostic information,  2 the nonlinearity of potential outcomes and  3 the presence of confounding.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: incorporate any ML method into the estimation of effects   , and model-specific strategies, which adapt specific ML methods to the treatment effect estimation problem – for example random forests  [ref]6, gaussian processes   and, most predominantly, neural networks  [ref]9 0 1 2 3.
