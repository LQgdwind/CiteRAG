      "content": "Paper Title: Effective Evaluation of Deep Active Learning on Image Classification Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo set the context for our key findings, we enumerate some facets of effective evaluation of AL. P1: Unified Experimental Setting. An effective comparison of AL selection algorithms requires attention to the experimental setting. Since several experimental parameters such as the choice of optimizer, the learning rate and its schedule, AL batch sizes, labeled set initializations, and other parameters have varied across publications, it is important to present a unified experimental setting wherein many of the re-implemented AL approaches can be compared. Luckily, many AL approaches can be decoupled from the training loop since these methods only consider the batch query. In this fashion, we are able to control all aspects of intermediate training and common parameters used in AL batch selection. In this work, we utilize DISTIL, our unified re-implementation of most state-of-the-art AL approaches, in a number of experimental settings. We build upon the Deep Active Learning GitHub repository [ref]11 , add several recent algorithms   9, and make the code modular to enable the use of different training loops. We provide the code along with Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the experiments from this paper in Appendix A. Detailed results are in Sec. 4.1. P2: Emphasis on Labeling Efficiency. Most AL works present their results by comparing the test accuracy with respect to the number of labeled points. While this perspective highlights the benefit of a selection algorithm compared to their baselines, it does not explicitly show the labeling efficiency of that algorithm with respect to random sampling. Since AL is premised on obtaining a target test accuracy using the fewest labels possible, it must be clear how many fewer labels a selection algorithm needs in order to achieve that target test accuracy with respect to random sampling. In this paper (specifically in  Sec. 4.1 and Sec. 4.2), we emphasize this measure through the use of labeling efficiency plots and motivate the need for studying labeling efficiency in future works as a means to more holistically understand AL selection algorithms. We give a concise definition of labeling efficiency in Sec. 4.1. P3: AL with Data Augmentation. Next, we study the effect of data augmentation   4 . Data augmentation has become commonplace in deep learning but has hardly been studied or used in AL algorithms; most AL papers do not report results with data augmentation. For example, the recent state-of-the-art Badge  approach achieved only slightly more than 80% towards the end of AL whereas state-of-the-art training methods (with data augmentation) achieve more than 90%percent9090\\% for most model families. We show that data augmentation approaches such as random cropping, random horizontal flips, and other transformations when used in AL training loops help achieve 90%percent9090\\% accuracy with only 13k labeled points in CIFAR-10 (26% of the data set). Data augmentation not only increases the accuracies achieved using AL but also improves the labeling efficiency. Somewhat surprisingly, we also see that Badge-like diversity-based approaches no longer outperform simple entropy sampling 7. We hypothesize that the augmentations help provide diversity to the selected data instances in the low-redundancy settings offered by the data sets commonly used in academia.\nWe report these experiments in Sec. 4.2. P4: AL with SGD and Other Generalization Approaches. Another facet of effective evaluation of AL involves analyzing the effect of the optimizer. Notably, a common observation is that Adam  generalizes poorly compared to SGD  , but we also find that most AL approaches  6 9 have used adaptive optimizers like Adam and RMSProp. Knowing this fact and that data augmentation helps the generalization performance of AL, we ask if choosing SGD over Adam  also improves the generalization performance of AL. We explore how SGD compares against Adam and find that Adam often results in reduced labeling efficiency and generalization performance despite being faster to converge than SGD (Sec. 4.3). To complement our observations concerning the generalization benefit of SGD, we also explore the effect of stochastic weight averaging  and shake-shake regularization  in AL, noting that both techniques further increase generalization performance. We report this in Appendix C. P5: Redundancy. As a result of the growth of deep learning data sets, redundant data has become a more prevalent phenomenon in deep learning. However, many of the experiments performed to assess the quality of AL algorithms neglect accounting for redundant data sets. As a result, the reported performance of these algorithms might not be indicative of their actual performance in real-world settings. We carefully examine the effect of redundancy in AL algorithms in Sec. 4.4 by progressively duplicating points in the CIFAR-10 data set . We also consider another similar redundancy setting in Appendix D where we instead add augmented copies of data instances with subtle random translations and random cropping. We perform all experiments with data augmentation in the training. We note that diversity-based methods such as Badge  are robust against redundant data while uncertainty-based methods such as entropy sampling 7 poorly handle redundant data. P6: When does AL offer benefit compared to random sampling? Most past works in AL have not provided guidelines as to when AL yields benefit over random sampling. In this paper, we hypothesize that the number of instances per class in the unlabeled data set provides a cue as to how much benefit AL can have. We are motivated by a simple observation (as we show in Sec. 4.1) that AL achieves a labeling efficiency of 1.8×1.8\\times to 2×2\\times on CIFAR-10  but only 1.3×1.3\\times on CIFAR-100 . To provide a clear experiment to test this hypothesis, we explore a scenario in Sec. 4.5 where we restrict the number of examples in CIFAR-10  on a per-class basis in the unlabeled set. We study the effect that this restriction has on the labeling efficiency of AL, noting that having fewer instances per class results in reduced labeling efficiency. P7: AL Batch Size and Seed Set Initialization. Across AL publications, different choices for the AL batch size are used. To draw an effective evaluation of AL, the effect of the AL batch size needs to be studied. Namely, is there a difference in the accuracies obtained by AL in practical scenarios if the AL batch size is varied? Furthermore, the labeled seed sets used in many AL experiments are often random; however, other sophisticated methods to construct higher-quality labeled seed sets (e.g., representative seed sets) can be used. In this work, we examine the effect of the AL batch size and the labeled seed set on the accuracies obtained by AL. These experiments are conducted in Sec. 4.6; the high-level takeaway is that neither reasonable choices of the AL batch size nor the initial seed set play a significant role in the performance (accuracies and labeling efficiencies) of AL. P8: Model Updating versus Model Retraining. Another facet of effective evaluation of AL involves analyzing the effect of updating the model between AL rounds versus retraining the model from a random initialization. Previous work done in [ref]3 suggests that warm-starting in deep learning can hurt the generalization performance of these models; however, their study was performed without data augmentation and with the Adam optimizer. We explore the effect of model updating between selection rounds while using SGD and data augmentation. We note that the test performance is negatively affected for the early rounds of AL when doing model updating versus model retraining; however, this negative effect diminishes once the model has matured and stabilized. This experiment is conducted in Sec. 4.7. Furthermore, we observe that when we use Adam and no data augmentation (Appendix E), we see a larger and more consistent degradation of the test performance of model updating versus model retraining, which confirms the observation of [ref]3. P9: Scalability. AL attempts to solve the labeling problem in large data sets, and large-scale usages of AL require that both the selection algorithm and the training procedure scale to the needs of these large data sets. Hence, we study the time spent in computing the query selection and in performing the intermediate model training, observing that the dominating time factor of most AL configurations is often the intermediate model training. Accordingly, scalable AL usages can then draw upon our previous observations concerning AL batch size and model updating. Namely, utilizing larger AL batch sizes whenever possible can reduce the number of intermediate training rounds needed, and opting for model updating can reduce the amount of time spent in intermediate model training. To alleviate the possible performance degradation that accompanies model updating, we further study the use of data subset selection (DSS) techniques to accelerate training. Specifically, we utilize Grad-Match  in most intermediate training rounds, occasionally performing full training in a few intermediate rounds to evaluate the performance of each selection algorithm. We show in Sec. 4.8 that, on top of achieving significant speedups, there is little to no performance degradation by using some of the above approaches with AL.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: In this work, we utilize DISTIL, our unified re-implementation of most state-of-the-art AL approaches, in a number of experimental settings.
