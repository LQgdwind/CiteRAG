      "content": "Paper Title: Decision Problems in Information Theory\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe study of constraints on entropies is a central topic of research in information theory. In fact, more than 30 years ago, Pippenger  asserted that\nconstraints on entropies are the “laws of information theory”\nand asked whether the polymatroidal axioms form the complete laws of information theory, i.e., whether\nevery constraint on entropies can be derived from the polymatroidal axioms.\nThese axioms consist of the following three types of constraints:\n(1) H​(∅)=0𝐻0H(\\emptyset)=0, (2) H​(X)≤H​(X∪Y)𝐻𝑋𝐻𝑋𝑌H(X)\\leq H(X\\cup Y) (monotonicity),\nand (3) H​(X)+H​(Y)≥H​(X∩Y)+H​(X∪Y)𝐻𝑋𝐻𝑌𝐻𝑋𝑌𝐻𝑋𝑌H(X)+H(Y)\\geq H(X\\cap Y)+H(X\\cup Y) (submodularity).\nIt is known that the polymatroidal axioms are equivalent to Shannon’s basic inequalities, that is, to the non-negativity of the entropy, conditional entropy, mutual information, and conditional mutual information .\nIn a celebrated result published in\n1998, Zhang and Yeung  answered Pippenger’s\nquestion negatively by finding a linear inequality that is satisfied by all entropic functions, but cannot be derived from the polymatroidal axioms. Zhang and Yeung’s result became the catalyst for the discovery of\nother information laws that are not captured by the polymatroidal\naxioms (e.g.,\n ). In\nparticular, we now know that there are more elaborate laws, such as\nconditional inequalities, or inequalities expressed using max\\max,\nwhich find equally important applications in a variety of areas. For\nexample, implications between conditional independence statements\nof discrete random variables can be expressed as conditional\ninformation inequalities. In another example, we have recently shown\nthat conjunctive query containment under bag semantics is at least as\nhard as checking information inequalities using\nmax\\max [ref]1. Despite the\nextensive research on various kinds of information inequalities, to\nthe best of our knowledge nothing is known about the algorithmic\naspects of the associated decision problem: check whether a given\ninformation law is valid. In this paper, we initiate a study of algorithmic problems that arise\nnaturally in information theory, and establish several results. To this\neffect, we introduce a generalized form of information inequalities,\nwhich we call Boolean information constraints, consisting of\nBoolean combinations of linear information inequalities, and define\ntheir associated decision problems. Since it is still an open problem\nwhether linear information inequalities, which are the simplest kind\nof information laws, are decidable, we focus on placing\nthese decision problems in the arithmetical hierarchy, also known as\nthe Kleene-Mostowski hierarchy . The\narithmetical hierarchy has been studied by mathematical logicians since\nthe late 1940s; moreover, it directly influenced the\nintroduction and study of the polynomial-time hierarchy by Stockmeyer\n. The first level of the arithmetical hierarchy consists\nof the collection Σ10subscriptsuperscriptΣ01\\Sigma^{0}_{1} of all recursively enumerable sets and\nthe collection Π10subscriptsuperscriptΠ01\\Pi^{0}_{1} of the complements of all recursively\nenumerable sets. The higher levels Σn0subscriptsuperscriptΣ0𝑛\\Sigma^{0}_{n} and Πn0subscriptsuperscriptΠ0𝑛\\Pi^{0}_{n},\nn≥2𝑛2n\\geq 2, are defined using existential and universal quantification\nover lower levels.\nWe prove a number of results, including the following.\n Checking the validity of a Boolean information constraint\narising from a monotone Boolean formula (in particular, a\nmax information inequality) is in Π10subscriptsuperscriptΠ01\\Pi^{0}_{1}\n(Theorem 4.3). Checking the validity of a conditional information\ninequality whose antecedents are “tight” is in Π30subscriptsuperscriptΠ03\\Pi^{0}_{3}\n(Corollary 4.10). “Tight” inequalities are\ndefined in Section 4.2.2, and include conditional\nindependence assertions between random variables. Checking the validity of a conditional information\ninequality whose antecedents have “slack” and are group-balanced\nis in Σ20subscriptsuperscriptΣ02\\Sigma^{0}_{2} (Corollary 4.14). Checking the validity of a group-balanced, max information\ninequality is Turing equivalent to checking the validity of an\ninformation inequality (Corollary 4.17). While the decidability of linear information inequalities (the\nsimplest kind considered in this paper) remains open, a separate\nimportant question is whether more complex Boolean information\nconstraints are any harder. For example, some conditional\ninequalities, or some max\\max-inequalities can be proven from a simple\nlinear inequality, hence they do not appear to be any harder. However, Kaced\nand Romashchenko  proved that there\nexist conditional inequalities that are essentially conditional, which means\nthat they do not follow from a linear inequality. (We give an\nexample in Equation (9).) We prove here that any conditional\ninformation inequality with slack is essentially unconditioned\n(Corollary 4.9; see also\nEquation(19)), and that any\nmax\\max-inequality also follows from a single linear inequality\n(Theorem 4.16). A subtle complication involving these results is whether by\n“validity” it is meant that the given Boolean information constraint\nholds for the set of all entropic vectors over n𝑛n variables, denoted by\nΓn∗superscriptsubscriptΓ𝑛\\Gamma_{n}^{*}, or for its topological closure, denoted by Γ¯n∗superscriptsubscript¯Γ𝑛\\overline{\\Gamma}_{n}^{*}.\nIt is well known that these two spaces differ for all n≥3𝑛3n\\geq 3. With\nthe exception of (1) above, which holds for both Γn∗superscriptsubscriptΓ𝑛\\Gamma_{n}^{*} and\nΓ¯n∗superscriptsubscript¯Γ𝑛\\overline{\\Gamma}_{n}^{*}, our results are only for Γ¯n∗superscriptsubscript¯Γ𝑛\\overline{\\Gamma}_{n}^{*}. A problem of\nspecial interest is the implication between conditional independence\nstatements of discrete random variables, and this amounts to\nchecking the Γn∗superscriptsubscriptΓ𝑛\\Gamma_{n}^{*}-validity of a tight conditional information\ninequality; it is known that this problem is not finitely\naxiomatizable , and its\ndecidability remains open. Our result (2) above does not apply here\nbecause it is a statement about Γ¯n∗superscriptsubscript¯Γ𝑛\\overline{\\Gamma}_{n}^{*}-validity. However, we\nprove that the implication problem for conditional independence\nstatements is in Π10subscriptsuperscriptΠ01\\Pi^{0}_{1} (Theorem 4.5).\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: inequalities.
