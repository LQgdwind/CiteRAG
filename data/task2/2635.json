      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Meta-theorems for Distance and Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn real-life scenarios, many situations involve an evolving input where parts of the data change frequently. Recomputing everything from scratch for these large datasets after every change is not an efficient option, and the goal is to dynamically maintain some auxiliary data structure to help us recompute the results quickly. The dynamic complexity framework of Patnaik and Immerman¬† is one such approach that has its roots in descriptive complexity  and is closely related to the setting of Dong, Su, and Topor¬†[ref]12. For example, by maintaining some auxiliary relations, the reachability relation can be updated after every single edge modification using first-order logic formulas¬† i.e., the reachability query is contained in the dynamic complexity class \\DynFO\\DynFO\\DynFO¬†. The motivation to use first-order logic as the update method has connections to other areas. From the circuit complexity perspective, this implies that such queries are highly parallelizable, i.e., can be updated by polynomial-size circuits in constant-time due to the correspondence between \\FO\\FO\\FO and uniform \\ACz\\ACz\\ACz circuits . From the perspective of database theory, such a program can be translated into equivalent SQL queries. The area has seen renewed interest in proving further upper bounds results, partly after the resolution of the long-standing conjecture¬† that reachability is in \\DynFO\\DynFO\\DynFO under single edge modifications¬†. A natural direction to extend this result is to see which other fundamental graph problems also admit such efficient dynamic programs. The closely related problems of maintaining distance and matching are two such examples, though a \\DynFO\\DynFO\\DynFO bound for these problems in general graphs has been elusive so far. The best known bound for distance is \\DynTCz\\DynTCz\\DynTCz¬† and non-uniform \\DynACzt\\DynACzt\\DynACzt . Here, the updates are computed in \\FO\\FO\\FO formulas with majority quantifiers (uniform \\TCz\\TCz\\TCz circuits) and non-uniform \\FO\\FO\\FO formulas with parity quantifiers (\\ACzt\\ACzt\\ACzt circuits), respectively. For matching, we have a non-uniform \\DynFO\\DynFO\\DynFO bound for maintaining the size of the maximum matching¬†. The only non-trivial class of graphs where both these problems are in \\DynFO\\DynFO\\DynFO is bounded treewidth graphs¬†[ref]10. At the same time progress has been made to understand how large a modification to the input can be handled by similar dynamic programs. It is of particular interest since, in applications, changes to a graph often come as a bulk set of edges. It was shown that reachability can be maintained in \\DynFOar\\DynFOar\\DynFOar under changes of size O‚Äã(log‚Å°n/log‚Å°log‚Å°n)ùëÇùëõùëõO(\\log n/\\log\\log n)¬† in graphs with nùëõn nodes. Here, the class \\DynFOar\\DynFOar\\DynFOar extends \\DynFO\\DynFO\\DynFO by access to built-in arithmetic, which is more natural for bulk changes. To handle larger changes, it is known that even for reachability, changes of size larger than polylogarithmic cannot be handled in \\DynFO\\DynFO\\DynFO¬†[ref]9. And for changes of polylogarithmic size, the previous techniques seem to require extending \\DynFO\\DynFO\\DynFO by majority quantifiers¬†. Under bulk changes of polylog(nùëõn) size, we can even maintain distance and the size of a maximum matching in the uniform and the non-uniform version of \\DynTCz\\DynTCz\\DynTCz, respectively¬† 3. Making further progress in this direction, recently it has been shown in [ref]9 that reachability is in \\DynFOpar\\DynFOpar\\DynFOpar (i.e., update formulas may use parity quantifiers) under polylog(nùëõn) changes in the class of graphs where polynomially bounded non-zero circulation weights can be computed statically in the parallel complexity class \\NC. A weight function for the edges of a graph has non-zero circulation if the (alternate) sum of the weight of every directed cycle is non-zero (see Section¬†2 for more details). Planar 7, bounded genus , bounded treewidth graphs [ref]9 are some of the well-studied graph classes for which such non-zero circulation weights can be computed in \\NC. In this work, we first extend this result to prove similar meta-theorems for maintaining distance (including a shortest path witness) and the search version of minimum weight bipartite maximum matching (\\BMWMCMS\\BMWMCMS\\BMWMCMS) in the same class of graphs. \\Dist\\Dist\\Dist and \\BMWMCMS\\BMWMCMS\\BMWMCMS are in \\DynFOpar\\DynFOpar\\DynFOpar under polylog(n)ùëõ(n) edge changes on classes of graphs where non-zero circulation weights can be computed in \\NC. Note that these are the only classes of graphs known where we can maintain both these problems deterministically without using a majority quantifier and even maintain a witness to the solution. While reachability can be maintained in \\DynFOar\\DynFOar\\DynFOar under bulk changes even in general graphs, no such bound is known for either distance or matching in any non-trivial class of graphs under a non-constant number of changes. Extending the dynamic rank algorithm of  to handle bulk changes (Theorem¬†6.1), we show a similar meta theorem for maintaining the size of a bipartite maximum matching (\\BMCMSz\\BMCMSz\\BMCMSz) in \\DynFOar\\DynFOar\\DynFOar under slightly sublogarithmic bulk changes, in the same class of graphs. \\BMCMSz\\BMCMSz\\BMCMSz is in \\DynFOar\\DynFOar\\DynFOar under O‚Äã(log‚Å°nlog‚Å°log‚Å°n)ùëÇùëõùëõO(\\frac{\\log{n}}{\\log{\\log{n}}}) edge changes on classes of graphs for which non-zero circulation weights can be computed in \\NC. Previously, no \\DynFOar\\DynFOar\\DynFOar bound was known even in planar graphs under single edge changes. Theorem¬†1.2 also extends the non-uniform \\DynFO\\DynFO\\DynFO bound for maintaining the size of maximum matching in general graphs from single edge changes  to O‚Äã(log‚Å°nlog‚Å°log‚Å°n)ùëÇùëõùëõO(\\frac{\\log{n}}{\\log{\\log{n}}}) many. Since reachability reduces to maintaining the rank of a matrix via bounded-expansion first-order (bfo) reductions , Theorem¬†6.1 also gives an alternative algorithm for maintaining reachability in \\DynFOar\\DynFOar\\DynFOar under O‚Äã(log‚Å°nlog‚Å°log‚Å°n)ùëÇùëõùëõO(\\frac{\\log{n}}{\\log{\\log{n}}}) changes. This is interesting in its own right as it generalizes the rank-method for maintaining reachability  even under bulk changes without going via the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury identity¬†.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: quickly.
