      "content": "Paper Title: Batch-Size Independent Regret Bounds for Combinatorial Semi-Bandits with Probabilistically Triggered Arms or Independent Arms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB)    is a classical model that has been extensively studied in online decision making. As an extension of MAB, combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CMAB) have drawn much attention recently, owing to its wide applications in marketing, network optimization and online advertising     9 3.\nIn CMAB, the learning agent chooses a combinatorial action in each round, and this action would trigger a set of arms (or a super arm) to be pulled simultaneously, and the outcomes of these pulled arms are observed as feedback. Typically, such feedback is known as the semi-bandit feedback. The agent’s goal is to minimize the expected regret, which is the difference in expectation for the overall rewards between always playing the best action (i.e., the action with highest expected reward) and playing according to the agent’s own policy. For CMAB, an agent not only need to deal with the exploration-exploitation tradeoff: whether the agent should explore arms in search for a better action, or should the agent stick to the best action observed so far to gain rewards; but also need to handle the exponential explosion of all possible actions. To model a wider range of application scenarios where action may trigger arms probabilistically, Chen et al.  first generalize CMAB to CMAB with probabilistically triggered arms (or CMAB-T for short), which successfully covers cascading bandit [ref]9 (CB) and online influence maximization (OIM) bandit 1 problems.\nLater on, Wang and Chen 9 improve the regret bound of  by introducing a smoothness condition,\ncalled the triggering probability modulated (TPM) condition, which removes a factor of 1/p∗1superscript𝑝1/p^{*} compared to , where p∗superscript𝑝p^{*} is the minimum positive probability that any arm can be triggered.\nHowever, in both studies, the regret bounds still depend on a factor of batch-size K𝐾K, where K𝐾K is the maximum number of arms that can be triggered, and this factor could be quite large, e.g., for OIM K𝐾K can be as large as the number of edges in a large social network. Our Contributions. In this paper, we reduce or remove the dependency on K𝐾K in the regret bounds.\nFor CMAB-T, we first discover a new triggering probability and variance modulated (TPVM) bounded smoothness condition, which is stronger than the TPM condition, yet still holds for several applications (such as CB and OIM) where only the TPM condition is known previously. We observe that for these applications, the previous TPM condition bounds the global speed of reward change regarding the parameter change, which will cause a large K𝐾K coefficient due to the rapid change at the boundary regions (i.e., when an arm’s mean μisubscript𝜇𝑖\\mu_{i} is close to 00 or 111).\nOur TPVM condition utilizes this observation by raising up the regret contribution of those boundary regions, leading to a significant reduction on the dependency of K𝐾K.\nSecond, we propose a “variance-aware\" BCUCB-T algorithm that adaptively changes the width of the confidence interval according to the (empirical) variance, cancelling out the large regret contribution raised by the TPVM condition at the boundary regions (where the variances are also very small).\nCombining these two techniques, we\nsuccessfully reduce the batch-size dependence from O​(K)𝑂𝐾O(K) to O​(log⁡K)𝑂𝐾O(\\log K) or O​(log2⁡K)𝑂superscript2𝐾O(\\log^{2}K) for all CMAB-T problems satisfying the TPVM condition, leading to significant improvements of the regret bounds for applications like CB or OIM. As a by-product, we also give refined proofs that shall improve the regret for several existing works by a factor of O​(log⁡K)𝑂𝐾O(\\log K), e.g.,  3, which may be of independent interests. In addition to the general CMAB-T setting, we show how a non-triggering version of the TPVM condition (i.e., VM condition) can help to completely remove the batch-size K𝐾K, under the additional independent arm assumption for non-triggering CMAB problems. In particular, we propose a novel Sub-Exponential Efficient Sampling for Combintorial Bandits Policy (SESCB) that produces tighter sub-exponential concentrated confidence intervals. In our analysis, we show that the total regret only depends on the arm that is observed least instead of all K𝐾K arms, so that we can achieve a completely batch-size independent regret bound.\nOur empirical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can achieve around 20%percent2020\\% lower regrets than previous ones for several applications.\nDue to the space limit, we will move the complete proofs and empirical results into the appendix. ∗ This work is for a specific application, but we treat it as a general framework; † Generally, Bv=O​(B1​K)subscript𝐵𝑣𝑂subscript𝐵1𝐾B_{v}=O(B_{1}\\sqrt{K}), and the existing regret bound is improved when Bv=o​(B1​K)subscript𝐵𝑣𝑜subscript𝐵1𝐾B_{v}=o(B_{1}\\sqrt{K}); ‡ Using our new analysis. ∗ Requires exact offline oracle instead of (α,β)𝛼𝛽(\\alpha,\\beta)-approximate oracle; † This work gives sufficient smoothness condition with factor γgsubscript𝛾𝑔\\gamma_{g} and translates to Bv=3​2​γgsubscript𝐵𝑣32subscript𝛾𝑔B_{v}=3\\sqrt{2}\\gamma_{g} in our setting; § Using our new analysis. ∗∗ This work is for the linear case, but can easily generalize to 1-norm B1subscript𝐵1B_{1} case; ‡ Generally, Bv=O​(B1​K)subscript𝐵𝑣𝑂subscript𝐵1𝐾B_{v}=O(B_{1}\\sqrt{K}) and the existing regret bound is improved when Bv=o​(B1​K)subscript𝐵𝑣𝑜subscript𝐵1𝐾B_{v}=o(B_{1}\\sqrt{K}); ∗∗∗ Efficient when the reward function is submodular, otherwise the computation is hard; Related Work.\nThe stochastic CMAB has received much attention recently. From the modelling point of view, these CMAB works can be divided into two categories:\nCMAB with or without probabilistically triggered arms (i.e. CMAB-T setting or non-triggering CMAB).\nFor CMAB-T, our work improves (a) the general framework in  9, (b) the combinatorial cascading bandit , (c) the online multi-layered network exploration  problem, (d) the online influence maximization bandits 9 , by reducing or removing the batch-size dependent factor K𝐾K in the regret bounds with our new TPVM condition and/or our refined analysis. We defer the detailed technical comparison to Section 3.1 and Section 5.\nFor the algorithm, most CMAB-T studies use Combinatorial Upper Confidence Bound (CUCB) based on Chernoff concentration bounds 9, our BCUCB-T algorithm is different and uses the Bernstein concentration bound  3\nthat considers variance of the arms. For non-triggering CMAB,  is the first study on stochastic CMAB, and its regret has been improved by Kveton et al. , Combes et al. [ref]9, Chen et al. , but they still have O​(K)𝑂𝐾O(K) factor in their regrets. When arms are mutually independent, Combes et al. [ref]9 build a tighter ellipsoidal confidence region for exploration, and devise the Efficient Sampling for Combinatorial Bandit policy (ESCB), which reduces the dependence on O​(K)𝑂𝐾O(K) to O​(log2⁡K)𝑂superscript2𝐾O(\\log^{2}K) at the cost of high computational complexity (since combinatorial optimization over the ellipsoidal region is NP-hard in general ). Later on, the computational complexity is improved by AESCB 0 in the linear CMAB problem.\nRecently, Merlis and Mannor 3 focus on the Probabilistic Maximum Coverage (PMC) bandit problem and propose the BC-UCB algorithm with the Gini-smoothness condition to achieve a similar improvement as ESCB/AESCB, but without the independent arm assumption.\nOur work is largely inspired by their work, however, our study generalizes theirs to the CMAB-T setting which can handle much broader application scenarios beyond the non-triggering CMAB\n(more detailed comparison is given in Section 3).\nIn addition, we provide a refined analysis that can save a O​(log⁡K)𝑂𝐾O(\\log K) factor for BC-UCB (or ESCB/AESCB) algorithm.\nCompared with other ESCB-type algorithms for independent arms, as far as we know, our SESCB algorithm are the first to completely remove the dependence of K𝐾K in the leading regrets, owing to our non-triggering version of the TPVM condition.\nThe detailed comparisons are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2. The usage of variance-aware algorithms to give improved regret bounds can be dated back to . Recently, there is a surge of interest to apply the variance-aware principle in bandit 3 8 and reinforcement learning (RL) settings 3 2. It is notable that Vial et al. 8 share a similar variance-aware principle as ours but focus on the distribution-independent regret bounds for the cascading bandits 8. Our work is more general and achieves the matching regret bound when translating to the distribution-independent regret bound. Compared with RL works, our paper studies a different setting as we do not consider the state transitions. From the application’s point of view, this paper covers the applications of PMC\nbandit 3, combinatorial cascading bandits  9, network exploration , and online influence maximization 1 9 0.\nOur proposed algorithms can significantly reduce the regret bounds of them, e.g., from O​(K)𝑂𝐾O(K) to O​(log2⁡K)𝑂superscript2𝐾O(\\log^{2}K) for OIM\nwhere K𝐾K can be hundreds of thousands in large social networks.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: where action may trigger arms probabilistically, Chen et al.  first generalize CMAB to CMAB with probabilistically triggered arms (or CMAB-T for short), which successfully covers cascading bandit [ref]9 (CB) and online influence maximization (OIM) bandit 1 problems.\nLater on, Wang and Chen 9 improve the regret bound of  by introducing a smoothness condition,\ncalled the triggering probability\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
