      "content": "Paper Title: A Rate-Distortion Framework for Explaining Black-box Model Decisions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo our knowledge, the explanation principle of optimizing a mask s‚àà [ref]1nùë†superscript01ùëõs\\in [ref]1^{n} has been first proposed in . Fong et al.  explained image classification decisions by considering one of the two \\saydeletion games: (1) optimizing for the smallest deletion mask that causes the class score to drop significantly or (2) optimizing for the largest deletion mask that has no significant effect on the class score. The original RDE approach [ref]16 is based on the second deletion game and connects the deletion principle to rate-distortion-theory, which studies lossy data compression. Deleted entries in  were replaced with either constants, noise, or blurring and deleted entries in [ref]16 were replaced with noise. Explanation methods introduced before the \\saydeletion games principle from  were typically based upon gradient-based methods , propagation of activations in neurons [ref]1, surrogate models , and game-theory [ref]15. Gradient-based methods such as smoothgrad  suffer from a lacking principle of relevance beyond local sensitivity. Reference-based methods such as Integrated Gradients  and DeepLIFT  depend on a reference value, which has no clear optimal choice. DeepLIFT and LRP assign relevance by propagating neuron activations, which makes them dependent on the implementation of Œ¶Œ¶\\Phi. LIME  uses an interpretable surrogate model that approximates Œ¶Œ¶\\Phi in a neighborhood around xùë•x. Surrogate model explanations are inherently limited for complex models Œ¶Œ¶\\Phi (such as image classifiers) as they only admit very local approximations. Generally, explanations that only depend on the model behavior on a small neighborhood Uxsubscriptùëàùë•U_{x} of xùë•x offer limited insight. Lastly, Shapley values-based explanations [ref]15 are grounded in Shapley values from game-theory. They assign relevance scores as weighted averages of marginal contributions of respective features. Though Shapley values are mathematically well-founded, relevance scores cannot be computed exactly for common input sizes such as n‚â•50ùëõ50n\\geq 50, since one exact relevance score generally requires O‚Äã(2n)ùëÇsuperscript2ùëõO(2^{n}) evaluations of Œ¶Œ¶\\Phi . A notable difference between the RDE method and additive feature explanations [ref]15 is that the values in the mask s‚àósuperscriptùë†s^{*} do not add up to the model output. The additive property as in [ref]15 takes the view that features individually contribute to the model output and relevance should be reflected by their contributions. We emphasize that the RDE method is designed to look for a set of relevant features and not an estimate of individual relative contributions. This is particularly desirable when only groups of features are interpretable, as for example in image classification tasks, where individual pixels do not carry any interpretable meaning.\nSimilarly to Shapley values, the explanation in the RDE framework cannot be computed exactly, as it requires solving a non-convex minimization problem. However, the RDE method can take full advantage of modern optimization techniques. Furthermore, the RDE method is a model-agnostic explanation technique, with a mathematically principled and intuitive notion of relevance as well as enough flexibility to incorporate the model behavior on meaningful input regions of Œ¶Œ¶\\Phi. The meaning of an explanation based on deletion masks s‚àà [ref]1nùë†superscript01ùëõs\\in [ref]1^{n} depends on the nature of the perturbations that replace the deleted regions. Random [ref]16  or blurred  replacements v‚àà‚Ñùnùë£superscript‚Ñùùëõv\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n} may result in a data point x‚äôs+(1‚àís)‚äôvdirect-productùë•ùë†direct-product1ùë†ùë£x\\odot s+(1-s)\\odot v that falls out of the natural data manifold on which Œ¶Œ¶\\Phi was trained on. This is a subtle though important problem, since such an explanation may depend on evaluations of Œ¶Œ¶\\Phi on data points from undeveloped decision regions. The latter motivates in-distribution interpretability, which considers meaningful perturbations that keep x‚äôs+(1‚àís)‚äôvdirect-productùë•ùë†direct-product1ùë†ùë£x\\odot s+(1-s)\\odot v in the data manifold.  was the first work that suggested to use an inpainting-GAN to generate meaningful perturbations to the \\saydeletion games. The authors of  then applied in-distribution interpretability to the RDE method in the challenging modalities music and physical simulations of urban environments. Moreover, they demonstrated that the RDE method in [ref]16 can be extended to answer so-called \\sayinterpretation queries. For example, the RDE method was applied in  to an instrument classifier to answer the global interpretation query \\sayIs magnitude or phase in the signal more important for the classifier?. Most recently, in , we introduced CartoonX as a novel explanation method for image classifiers, answering the interpretation query ‚ÄúWhat is the relevant piece-wise smooth part of an image?‚Äù by applying RDE in the wavelet basis of images.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: To our knowledge, the explanation principle of optimizing a mask s‚àà [ref]1nùë†superscript01ùëõs\\in [ref]1^{n} has been first proposed in .
