Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: Zero-Shot Contrastive Loss for Text-Guided Diffusion Image Style Transfer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeural style transfer [ref]14 iteratively optimizes the content image to match the style image, which is time-consuming. Alternatively, adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) [ref]17 transfers the style of a source image to a target image by matching their feature statistics. In contrast, pix2pix [ref]18, CycleGAN , and CUT  use different mechanisms for content preservation. CycleGAN’s cycle consistency for content preservation is often too restrictive, while CUT maximizes mutual information between content and stylized images in a patch-based feature space. This maintains structural information while changing appearance. CLIP model  has been shown to have semantic representative power resulting from a large-scale dataset of 400 million image and text pairs, which allows for text-driven image manipulation. StyleCLIP  uses CLIP and pretrained StyleGAN  to optimize the latent vector of the content input given a text prompt, but its image modification is limited to the domain of the pretrained generator. StyleGAN-NADA  proposes an out-of-domain image manipulation method that shifts the generative model to new domains. VQGAN-CLIP  demonstrates that VQGAN  can also be used as a pretrained generative model to generate or edit high-quality images without training. CLIPstyler  proposes a CNN encoder-decoder model that learns both content and style properties through patch-wise CLIP loss, allowing for image generation and manipulation beyond the domains of pretrained generators.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: Neural style transfer [ref]14 iteratively optimizes the content image to match the style image, which is time-consuming.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
