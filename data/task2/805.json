      "content": "Paper Title: Image Reconstruction of Static and Dynamic Scenes through Anisoplanatic Turbulence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHaving discussed the image formation process, we now summarize the typical approaches in existing image reconstruction methods and comment on their limitations. Step 1. Removing tilts. The first step of a reconstruction method is to mimic the short-exposure procedure by removing the tilts. This is often done using the optical flow . However, since all input frames of a turbulence-distorted sequence are randomly warped, we need to first construct a geometrically stable reference frame. When the scene is static, one can take the temporal average as the reference frame like    [ref]17  . More advanced approaches such as robust principal component analysis (RPCA) can be used to extract the low-rank part as the reference frame. However, RPCA generally has comparable performance to temporal averaging as shown in section IV. B. Improvement of the reference frame extraction methods exists, e.g., the variational method by Xie et al. [ref]20, and frame selection schemes by Anantrasirichai et al. [ref]17 and Lau et al. . However, these techniques are designed for static scenes. Images containing moving objects still cannot be recovered. Reference extraction methods for moving scenes are available but scattered. Halder et al.  assume that a certain segment of the video sequence does not contain any moving object so that a reference can be extracted. Oreifej et al. [ref]23 and Anantrasirichai et al.  use background segmentation to separate the moving object from the static background. However, since turbulence-distorted images are usually blurry, the object boundaries of the segmentation are difficult to be determined precisely which can be seen from Figure 20 in the experiment section. Our proposed method does not require any segmentation. It is based on a space-time non-local averaging which can stabilize background while preserving moving objects. Step 2. Lucky image fusion. While optical flow can align the pixels so that we can approximate the short-exposure frames, a simple averaging over all these short-exposure frames is problematic because the optical flow algorithms are not perfect. In addition, it is known in turbulence literature that a sharp region will occasionally appear because the random phase distortion is zero-mean . Therefore, the most reasonable step here is to compare the spatial blocks over an extended period of frames, and pick the sharpest block. This step is known as the lucky image fusion. The goal of the lucky fusion step is to combine sharp image blocks to form a diffraction limited image. The fusion can be done in the wavelet domain as proposed by Anantrasirichai et al. [ref]17, or in the spatial domain by computing the local gradient, variance or distortions as proposed by Aubailly et al. , Zhu and Milanfar , and Xie et al. [ref]20. For robust PCA approaches such as Lau et al.  and He et al. , the lucky image fusion step is done by refining the sparse components and adding them to the low-rank parts of the image. In our proposed method, the lucky image fusion is done by a new image quality metric that measures both the sharpness and consistency of the patches. The sharpness metric helps extracting the sharp patches from the sequence, whereas the consistency metric improves the robustness by rejecting any residual jittering pixels from the previous steps. Step 3. Blind deconvolution. After the lucky region fusion, the residual blur that is remaining in the image is largely caused by the diffraction limit of the lens, plus some minor effects due to any averaging process and artifacts of the previous steps. Therefore, a blind deconvolution algorithm is applied at last to remove these residual blurs. Many turbulence mitigation methods, e.g.  [ref]17  [ref]20 , use off-the-shelf blind deconvolution algorithms such as the classical method by Shan et al. . However, the priors they used to define the point spread function are generic, e.g., ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} or total variation. These priors have almost no connection with the statistical behavior of turbulence, in particular the 5/3-power kernel proved by Fried . A more recent approach by Nieuwenhuizen et al. uses deep neural networks . However, with limited publicly available datasets to train the network, generalization of the method is limited. A physically more principled approach is by Hardie et al. , where they construct the ideal short-exposure point spread function by estimating the turbulence parameters. However, since the optical flow is not perfect and the lucky fusion sometimes introduces extra blur  , the residual errors can contaminate the predicted ideal PSF in . Our proposed method is to construct the prior via basis expansion, similar to the analysis of Fried  but straightly in the spatial domain. It is a semi-supervised learning integrating numerical simulation and sparse modeling.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: sequence are randomly warped, we need to first construct a geometrically stable reference frame.
