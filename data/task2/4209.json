      "content": "Paper Title: A Feature Memory Rearrangement Network for Visual Inspection of Textured Surface Defects Toward Edge Intelligent Manufacturing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFollowing previous work, first, the following competing approaches are evaluated on the MVTec AD dataset for performance comparison of anomaly detection: AE-SSIM, MSCDAE[ref]19, AnoGAN[ref]20, f-AnoGAN[ref]47, the CNN feature dictionary method, RIAD, Lv’s method, the Uninformed Students (US) method and the proposed FMR-Net. The quantitative comparative results in terms of the AUC ROC indicator are given in Table IV. AE-SSIM shows superior performance on simple homogeneous textures such as grids. However, it is incapable of inspecting irregular textures such as tiles and wood. MSCDAE does not perform well due to the lack of semantic information gained due to the small receptive field. Early AE-based models can easily reconstruct defects as well as background; thus, the remaining anomalous patterns influence the subsequent detection process. AnoGAN still achieves unsatisfactory results, and our experiments reveal that its ability to reconstruct normal textures is limited. This can be attributed to the fact that the unstable latent representation search causes the quality of the generated images to be compromised. In f-AnoGAN, an extra encoder is introduced to make it more robust for background reconstruction, leading to better and faster performance. However, the experimental results illustrate that it is powerless in repairing destructive defects, for which anomalous patterns will remain in the reconstructed images. For the feature-domain detection method known as the CNN feature dictionary method, although it achieves reasonable results on irregular textures such as wood and tiles, it is unable to handle all situations and categories well simultaneously. RIAD achieves excellent defect elimination and shows superior performance on homogeneous surfaces such as leather, grids and carpet. Unfortunately, this method leads to a poor normal texture reconstruction effect for textures with strong randomness, such as tiles and wood. Thus, the nonanomalous regions are still assigned high anomaly scores, which has an adverse effect on the inspection accuracy. The US method yields reasonable results, but it is trained in a multiscale fashion, which requires an ensemble of 9 independent models, thus limiting its practical applications. Moreover, the detection effect varies greatly with the scale. Lv’s method demonstrates robust performance on all types of textured surfaces. Among all the compared methods, FMR-Net achieves the best comprehensive inspection accuracy on all types of defects and textures. As shown in Table IV, compared to the second-best results, FMR-Net improves the AUC ROC values by margins of 0.1, 0.4, 0.2, and 2.6 on four types of textured surfaces and only slightly underperforms compared to RIAD on the leather dataset. Notably, unlike existing methods such as RIAD, our method demonstrates robust performance for all types of textured surfaces. The performance of the proposed method is essentially the same as that of state-of-the-art methods on simple textures, while for the most complex and irregular surface type, the performance of FMR-Net on the tile dataset is greatly improved. This finding can be attributed to the stable defect repair and background reconstruction of our FMR-Net. Fig. 11 presents the qualitative results of FMR-Net on the MVTec AD texture dataset, which illustrates its remarkable capability of simultaneous detection for various materials.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: Following previous work, first, the following competing approaches are evaluated on the MVTec AD dataset for performance comparison of anomaly detection: AE-SSIM, MSCDAE[ref]19, AnoGAN[ref]20, f-AnoGAN[ref]47, the CNN feature dictionary method, RIAD, Lv’s method, the Uninformed Students (US) method and the proposed FMR-Net.
