We compare R@20, R@50, and R@100. For some literature work, the R@20 is not given. We used ’−-’ which denotes that the result is unavailable. So, the mean is calculated using values of R@50 and R@100 to have fair comparison with state of the art. Models using the same VGG backbone are denoted with ’⋆⋆\\star’ and the BGT-Net with ResNext-101 background is marked with ’⋄⋄\\diamond’. [No Graph Constraint Recall Results of transformer Model]nGR@K, mR@K and zsR@K comparison with state-of-the-art on the VG dataset. The version of the BGT-Net, i.e., the BGT-Net (no BiGRU) is also compared. Visual Genome:\nBGT-Net outperforms all the compared previous literature work as shown in Table 4.5 on R@K for all values of K . BGT-Net performs better than a recent model named GPS-net [ref]21 by 6%percent\\% and by 12%percent\\% on average at R@50 and R@100 over the three protocols when VGG-19 or ResNext-101 is used as the base for the Faster-RCNN, respectively. It also outperforms when an individual evaluation protocol is compared. The improvement is by 16.6%percent\\% for SGDet, 17.3%percent\\% for SGCls, and for 0.2%percent\\% for PredCls. When compared to the classic MOTIFS 5, it showed an improvement of 7.3%percent\\% and 14%percent\\% on average at R@50 and R@100 over the three protocols when VGG-19 or ResNext-101 is used as a backbone for the Faster-RCNN, respectively. BGT-Net outperforms FREQ 5, VCTREE-SL [ref]33, VCTREE-HL [ref]33, GB-NET  , NODIS , CMAT , KERN , Graph R-CNN , IMP  by 14.9%percent\\%, 4.3%percent\\%, 3.9%percent\\%, 5.6%percent\\%, 3.2%percent\\%, 3.2%percent\\%, 6.3%percent\\%, 40.9%percent\\%, 85.4%percent\\%, respectively, on average at R@50 and R@100 over the three protocols when VGG-19 is used as a backbone for the Faster-RCNN and by 22.2%percent\\%, 11%percent\\%, 10.5%percent\\%, 12.3%percent\\%, 9.8%percent\\%, 9.8%percent\\%, 13.1%percent\\%, 49.9%percent\\%, 97.3%percent\\%, respectively, on average at R@50 and R@100 over the three protocols when ResNext-101 is used as a backbone for the Faster-RCNN. We evaluate Mean Recall of BGT-Net to understand its performance on the class imbalance problem. So, we study its performance by conducting experiments to calculate its Mean Recall  [ref]33 [ref]21. We see in Figure 2 and Table 1 that BGT-Net performs well considering the Mean Recall evaluation metric. The mean of the Mean Recall over all the three evaluation metrics (SGDet, SGCls, PredCls) is 15.5 for BGT-Net and hence outperforms GB-Net and GPS-Net which are the best state-of-the-art on class imbalance handling having good performance on both mean R@K and R@K results. This gives a positive indication that BGT-Net can tackle the problem of class imbalance while simultaneously giving high R@K as compared to the other existing solutions to best of our knowledge. Why BiGRU? We investigated BGT-Net without BiGRU but BGT-Net (no BiGRU) has lower SGCls and PredCls results (see Table 4.5). The deciding factor for using BiGRU in BGT-Net is mR@K and nGR@K. Both these metrics significantly improve for all three: SGDet, SGCls, PredCls when BGT-Net is with BiGRU as shown in Table 4.5.\nAlso shown in Table 4.5, BGT-Net has high improvement on zsR@K as compared to  and 5 which shows that it is able to better detect those subject-predicate-object combinations which are not present in the training set. OpenImages:\nThe results in Table 3 show that BGT-Net performs very well on the OpenImages dataset. The overall score is 0.64 points higher than the GPS-Net model performance. This increase in performance is achieved by an overall increase in performance in all three evaluated metrics R@@@K, wmAPrel, and wmAPphr. An evaluation of the per-class AP is also shown. In this evaluation, some classes were chosen as in GPS-Net [ref]21 and RelDN 9 to show class-specific performance. The performances of GPS-Net and the BGT-Net are quite close. For ”holds”, ”interacts with” and ”wears”, the GPS-Net shows a higher AP while for the others the BGT-Net shows the highest AP.\nThe overall performance of the BGT-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art performance of the GPS-Net model. Visual Relationship Detection:\nThe evaluation results on VRD Dataset are illustrated in Table 2. The BGT-Net uses the same Detector as RelDN and GPS-Net. The BGT-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art models in all three evaluation metrics. So, BGT-Net shows the best to the date performance on the VRD dataset as well to the best of our knowledge, and which is better than GPS-Net and RelDN (previous best performing networks).\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: compared.
