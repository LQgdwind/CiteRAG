      "content": "Paper Title: Texture Extraction Methods Based Ensembling Framework for Improved Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe have chosen DeepTEN [ref]32, histogram layer , FAP [ref]28, and GAP TE techniques for the proposed model design and experiments. Other methods such as DEPNet , DSRNet  and CLASSNet  are inherited from one of these used methods. Our choice of TE methods prevents any overlap in capturing the texture characteristics. The other existing methods leverage outputs from multi layers of the backbone network simultaneously; while our framework focuses on techniques applied to the backbone’s last layer output. Some techniques are not included due to similarity with above techniques. DEPNet and DSRNet use the same encoding layer that has been used in DeepTEN. DSRNet  which was developed for ground terrain recognition uses the same texture encoding layer from DeepTEN. DSRNet has been built using ResNet50  as a backbone but not uses ResNet18, but in our paper we have used ResNet18 . Whereas, CLASSNet uses a concept of statistical self-similarity (SSS)  which is calculated with the help of fractals which is something similar to FAP. In CLASSNet the feature maps are learned using CNN and have a cross-layer SSS for exploiting the SSS of images. For the SSS-based texture recognition, fractal analysis is used to characterize the SSS on images . The fractal analysis is also used in FAP for calculating the fractal dimension and classifying the texture based on the same. Considering the other methods as just an extension of the already used methods or not used in the ResNet18 as backbone, we proceed to use the parent methods since we are ensembling the distinct techniques and we don’t want the texture to be categorized based on the same attributes more than once.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: We have chosen DeepTEN [ref]32, histogram layer , FAP [ref]28, and GAP TE techniques for the proposed model design and experiments.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
