      "content": "Paper Title: Sampling from Arbitrary Functions via PSD Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOrganization of the Supplementary Material Definitions and Notations\nWe set the main notations and tools of the appendix (Fourier transform, vector and matrix notations, notations concerning hyper-rectangles, RKHS and specifically the Gaussian kernel). Sobolev spaces\nIn this section, we focus more on notations and basic results concerning Sobolev spaces, as they will be our main tool to measure the regularity of a function. Measuring distances between probability densities\nIn this section, we define and compare the basic distances we will be using to compare probability distributions in the paper, since we are always \"approximating\" a certain distribution with another. In particular, we define the total variation, Hellinger and Wasserstein distances. General PSD models\nWe define PSD models in general [ref]10 [ref]16. They will be our main tool for approximation and sampling, and relates to the more restrictive definition in Sec.¬†2. Properties of the Gaussian RKHS\nThroughout the paper the Gaussian kernel kŒ∑subscriptùëòùúÇk_{\\eta} and the associated Gaussian RKHS will be central objects. We introduce different properties and results. Properties of the Gaussian kernel kŒ∑subscriptùëòùúÇk_{\\eta}\nWe introduce certain properties of the Gaussian kernel involving products, as well as a bound on the derivative of the associated embedding in Lemma¬†2. Useful Matrices and Linear Operators on the Gaussian RKHS\nWe introduce the most important theoretical objects of the paper. We introduce kernel matrices, matrices which will appear in the integration of Gaussian PSD models, operators which relate L2superscriptùêø2L^{2} to the RKHS ‚ÑãŒ∑subscript‚ÑãùúÇ\\mathcal{H}_{\\eta}, operators which allow to discretize using samples and \"compression\" operators which allow concise representations. Approximation properties of the Gaussian kernel\nWe prove two important results concerning the approximation properties of the Gaussian RKHS in proposition¬†7 and the concise representation of models in Lemma¬†3. Properties of Gaussian PSD models\nWe present the results specific to Gaussian PSD models. These results are often reformulations of theorems presented by Rudi and Ciliberto, [ref]16. Bounds on the support and the derivatives\nWe present result to understand how the mass of a Gaussian PSD model is concentrated (Lemma¬†4) and how the derivative of a Gaussian PSD model can be bounded using only its parameters (Lemma¬†5). Compression as a Gaussian PSD model\nWe restate Theorem C.4 of Rudi and Ciliberto, [ref]16 as Theorem¬†5 on the effect of a compression operator on a PSD model. Approximation properties of Gaussian PSD model\nWe refine Theorem D.4 of Rudi and Ciliberto, [ref]16 in Theorem¬†6 in order to approximate a sum of squares using a PSD model on the Gaussian RKHS ‚ÑãŒ∑subscript‚ÑãùúÇ\\mathcal{H}_{\\eta}. The sampling algorithm\nWe prove that the sampling algorithm indeed returns NùëÅN i.i.d. samples from the right distribution, and characterize the distance between the sampling distribution and the original PSD distribution. Dyadic decompositions and convergence of algorithm¬†1\nWe formally prove that algorithm¬†1 finishes and returns NùëÅN samples from a distribution characterized by a structural induction formula (see Lemma¬†6). Proof of Theorem¬†1\nWe prove Theorem¬†1 by structural induction, showing that when the samples are randomly shuffled, we end up with NùëÅN i.i.d. samples from the distribution defined in Eq.¬†7. This is done by matching the distribution with the one from the previous section using a structural induction. Evaluating the error of the sampling algorithm : proof of Theorem¬†2\nWe prove Theorem¬†2 in Theorem¬†7, bounding the distance between the distribution of the PSD model and the actual distribution from which algorithm¬†1 samples (see Eq.¬†7). This is done in different distances, all related to the problem in different way (Wasserstein is the most adapted in spirit, but we also need stronger distances such as total variation and Hellinger, which can be bounded using Lipschitz constants of the PSD models). A general method of approximation and sampling\nWe prove that we can approximate any probability distribution satisfying Assumption¬†2 using non necessarily normalized function values, by solving Sec.¬†4.1 with the right parameters in proposition¬†10 which is labeled in the main text as\nproposition¬†1. We then show that applying algorithm¬†1 with the right value of œÅùúå\\rho yields a good sampling algorithm from a good approximation of the distribution.\nThis proves Theorem¬†3 and is proved here as Theorem¬†8. Approximation and sampling using a rank one PSD model\nWe prove that we can approximate any probability distribution satisfying Assumption¬†1 using non necessarily normalized function values, by solving Eq.¬†20 with the right parameters in proposition¬†11 which is labeled in the main text as\nproposition¬†2. This has an advantage compared to the previous method which is that the approximation phase is much faster (it solves a linear system instead of an SDP). We then show that applying algorithm¬†1 with the right value of œÅùúå\\rho yields a good sampling algorithm from a good approximation of the distribution.\nThis proves Theorem¬†4 and is proved here as Theorem¬†10.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: are always \"approximating\" a certain distribution with another. In particular, we define the total variation, Hellinger and Wasserstein distances. General PSD models\nWe define PSD models in general [ref]10 [ref]16. They will be our main tool for approximation and sampling, and relates to the more restrictive definition in Sec.¬†2. Properties of the Gaussian RKHS\nThroughout the paper the Gaussian\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
