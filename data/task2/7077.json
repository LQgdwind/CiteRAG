      "content": "Paper Title: Tight approximability of MAX 2-SAT and relatives, under UGC\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe LLZ algorithm itself is fairly simple and natural. It is parameterized by a threshold function f:[−1,1]→[−1,1]:𝑓→1111f:[-1,1]\\to[-1,1], or by a distribution ℱℱ\\cal F of threshold functions. The threshold function used to obtain an optimal approximation algorithm for MAX 2-SAT is very simple: f​(x)=β​x𝑓𝑥𝛽𝑥f(x)=\\beta x, where β=βL​L​Z𝛽subscript𝛽𝐿𝐿𝑍\\beta=\\beta_{LLZ} is the optimal approximation ratio of MAX 2-SAT. The analysis of the LLZ algorithm, however, requires minimizing or maximizing functions of several real variables that involve the cumulative probability function of 2-dimensional Gaussian variables for which no closed form exists. This greatly complicates the analysis. All previous analyses of the LLZ algorithm had to resort to numerical techniques. Lewin, Livnat and Zwick  used non-rigorous numerical techniques to obtain the estimate βL​L​Z≈0.940subscript𝛽𝐿𝐿𝑍0.940\\beta_{LLZ}\\approx 0.940. Austrin  used non-rigorous numerical techniques to corroborate his simplicity conjecture. Sjögren  used rigorous numerical techniques to show that βL​L​Z≥0.94016subscript𝛽𝐿𝐿𝑍0.94016\\beta_{LLZ}\\geq 0.94016, but did not attempt to prove the simplicity conjecture. To prove the simplicity conjecture we need to obtain a much finer analysis of the LLZ algorithm. We are not interested in just lower bounding the approximation ratio obtained by the algorithm. We need to show that the critical configurations, i.e., the configurations on which the worst performance of the algorithm is obtained have a particularly simple form. We do that using a combination of analytic techniques and rigorous numerical techniques, i.e., interval arithmetic. Interval arithmetic was previously used by Zwick , Sjögren , Austrin, Benabbas and Georgiou , Bhangale et al. [ref]8, Bhangale and Khot [ref]7, and Brakensiek et al. [ref]9 to analyze SDP-based approximation algorithms. Our use of interval arithmetic is more involved since we are not just trying to lower bound the approximation ratio achieved by an algorithm, but rather certify that the worst behavior is obtained on configurations of a certain form, the so called simple configurations. This requires a much more careful analysis.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: of analytic techniques and rigorous numerical techniques, i.e., interval arithmetic.
