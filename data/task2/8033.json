      "content": "Paper Title: MU-MAE: Multimodal Masked Autoencoders-Based One-Shot Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMultimodal classification.\nEarlier multimodal learning approaches primarily focused on extracting representations from similar modalities [ref]19  . For instance, the two-stream CNN excelled at capturing spatial and temporal features from visual data , while Feichtenhofer’s two-stream learning model varied data sampling rates to extract spatial-temporal features .\nRecent research underscores the development of multimodal learning methods that effectively leverage complementary features from different modalities to overcome dependencies on single-modality data in modality-specific HAR models. For example, in  , they first use attention model to extract unimodal features, which are then fused to generate multimodal representations. Challenges persist in efficiently fusing various unimodal features, leading to the exploration of different fusion approaches, including early fusion, late fusion, and hybrid fusion strategies   . Simonyan et al.’s two-stream CNN architecture , incorporating spatial and temporal networks, has been extensively studied and proven effective in recent works, employing residual connections  and slow-fast network techniques . Other investigations focus on simultaneous feature fusion from diverse modalities, such as video, and wearable sensor modalities.\nHAMLET  employs a hierarchical architecture with a multi-head self-attention mechanism to encode spatio-temporal features from unimodal data in the lower layer and then fuse them in upper layer.\nMuMu  incorporates an auxiliary task involving activity group classification to guide the fusion with unimodal representations.\nDespite these advancements, the ongoing challenge in the field lies in dynamically selecting unimodal features to generate multimodal features.\nIn our Mu-MAE, we address this challenge using a cross-attention multimodal fusion module, dynamically highlighting spatiotemporal features that require attention across different modalities while emphasizing differences from other classes. Masked visual modeling,\nMasked visual modeling has proven to be a robust strategy for acquiring impactful representations by employing a sequential process involving masking and subsequent reconstruction. Although early efforts predominantly concentrated on the image domain, employing techniques such as denoised autoencoders  and convolutions for inpainting missing regions , recent advancements have expanded the scope of this methodology to encompass videos. Vision transformer architectures like BEiT , BEVT , and VIMPAC  were inspired by language models  , opting for the prediction of discrete tokens to glean visual representations from both images and videos. The introduction of MAE  brought forth an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture finely tuned for masked image modeling, whereas VideoMAE  took a distinctive approach by directly reconstructing pixels in a more straightforward yet highly effective video masked autoencoder. The evolution in masked visual modeling signals a notable shift towards direct pixel-level reconstruction, enhancing self-supervised pretraining in both image and video domains.\nSubsequently, VideoMAE V2  introduced an effective pretraining method utilizing a dual masking strategy. In this approach, an encoder processes a subset of video tokens, and a decoder manages another subset of video tokens. This strategy facilitates the efficient pretraining of billion-level models in the video domain. One-shot learning,\nOne-shot learning algorithms are typically classified into three primary categories: optimization-based methods , model-based methods  , and metric-learning-based methods [ref]9  [ref]39 . Among these, metric-learning-based methods emerge as particularly promising, as evidenced by their superior performance in prior studies [ref]9 [ref]39 .\nMetric-learning-based approaches compute the distance between representations of support and query samples, utilizing the nearest neighbor for classification. The fundamental principle involves maintaining closeness between representations of similar classes while ensuring differentiation between representations of dissimilar classes. For instance, MASTAF  highlights spatio-temporal features that demand attention for each class, simultaneously accentuating distinctions from other classes. In our Mu-MAE, we also leverage the metric-learning-based method. To optimize its effectiveness, we employ a cross-attention multimodal fusion module to enhance the differentiation of each class’s spatio-temporal features, contributing to improved performance in one-shot classification tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: Multimodal classification.\nEarlier multimodal learning approaches primarily focused on extracting representations from similar modalities [ref]19  .
