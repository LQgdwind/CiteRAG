      "content": "Paper Title: Many-valued Argumentation, Conditionals and a Probabilistic Semantics for Gradual Argumentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section we generalize the gradual argumentation semantics proposed in  [ref]22,\nthe φ𝜑\\varphi-coherent semantics, whose definition is inspired to some recently studied semantics of conditional knowledge bases [ref]25 .\nAs a proof of concept, the φ𝜑\\varphi-coherent semantics will be used in Section 4 for conditional reasoning over an argumentation graph. We let the domain of argument valuation 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} to be either the real unit interval [ref]0 [ref]0  or the finite set 𝒞n={0,1n,…,n−1n,1}subscript𝒞𝑛01𝑛…𝑛1𝑛1\\mathcal{C}_{n}=\\{0,\\frac{1}{n},\\ldots,\\frac{n-1}{n},1\\}, for some integer n≥1𝑛1n\\geq 1.\nThis allows to develop the notions of many-valued coherent, faithfull and φ𝜑\\varphi-coherent labellings for weighted argumentation graphs, which include both the infinitely and the finitely-valued case. Following ,\nwe let a weighted argumentation graph to be a triple\nG=⟨𝒜,ℛ,π⟩𝐺𝒜ℛ𝜋G=\\langle\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{R},\\pi\\rangle, where 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is a set of arguments, ℛ⊆𝒜×𝒜ℛ𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{R}\\subseteq\\mathcal{A}\\times\\mathcal{A}\nand π:ℛ→ℝ:𝜋→ℛℝ\\pi:\\mathcal{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}.\nThis definition of weighted argumentation graph is similar to weighted argument system in 4, but here we admit both positive and negative weights, while only positive weights representing the strength of attacks are allowed in 4. In this notion of weighted argumentation graph, a pair (B,A)∈ℛ𝐵𝐴ℛ(B,A)\\in\\mathcal{R} is regarded as a support of argument B𝐵B to argument A𝐴A when the weight π​(B,A)𝜋𝐵𝐴\\pi(B,A) is positive and as an attack of argument B𝐵B to argument A𝐴A when the weight π​(B,A)𝜋𝐵𝐴\\pi(B,A) is negative. This leads to bipolar argumentation, which is well-studied in argumentation literature   6 8.\nThe argumentation semantics introduced below deals with positive and negative weights in a uniform way.\nA notion of basic strength is not introduced, even though it could be added.\n Given a weighted argumentation graph G=⟨𝒜,ℛ,π⟩𝐺𝒜ℛ𝜋G=\\langle\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{R},\\pi\\rangle, a many-valued labelling of G𝐺G is a function σ:𝒜→𝒮:𝜎→𝒜𝒮\\sigma:\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{S}\nwhich assigns to each argument an acceptability degree in 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}. Let R−​(A)=superscript𝑅𝐴absent\\mathit{R^{-}(A)=} {B∣(B,A)∈ℛ}conditional-set𝐵𝐵𝐴ℛ\\mathit{\\{B\\mid(B,A)\\in\\mathcal{R}}\\}.\nWhen R−​(A)=∅superscript𝑅𝐴\\mathit{R^{-}(A)=\\emptyset}, argument A𝐴A has neither supports nor attacks.\nFor G=⟨𝒜,ℛ,π⟩𝐺𝒜ℛ𝜋G=\\langle\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{R},\\pi\\rangle and a labelling σ𝜎\\sigma, we introduce a weight WσGsubscriptsuperscript𝑊𝐺𝜎W^{G}_{\\sigma} on 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} as a partial function WσG:𝒜→ℝ:subscriptsuperscript𝑊𝐺𝜎→𝒜ℝW^{G}_{\\sigma}:\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}, assigning a positive or negative support (relative to labelling σ𝜎\\sigma) to all arguments Ai∈𝒜subscript𝐴𝑖𝒜A_{i}\\in\\mathcal{A} such that R−​(Ai)≠∅superscript𝑅subscript𝐴𝑖\\mathit{R^{-}(A_{i})\\neq\\emptyset}, as follows: When R−​(Ai)=∅superscript𝑅subscript𝐴𝑖\\mathit{R^{-}(A_{i})=\\emptyset}, WσG​(Ai)subscriptsuperscript𝑊𝐺𝜎subscript𝐴𝑖W^{G}_{\\sigma}(A_{i}) is let undefined. We exploit this notion of weight of an argument to define some different argumentation semantics for a graph G𝐺G, by extending also to the finitely-valued case the semantics in . Given a weighted graph G=⟨𝒜,ℛ,π⟩𝐺𝒜ℛ𝜋G=\\langle\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{R},\\pi\\rangle and σ:𝒜→𝒮:𝜎→𝒜𝒮\\sigma:\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{S} a labelling, we say that: σ𝜎\\sigma is a coherent labelling of G𝐺G\nif, for all arguments A,B∈𝒜𝐴𝐵𝒜A,B\\in\\mathcal{A} s.t. R−​(A)≠∅superscript𝑅𝐴\\mathit{R^{-}(A)\\neq\\emptyset} and R−​(B)≠∅superscript𝑅𝐵\\mathit{R^{-}(B)\\neq\\emptyset}, σ𝜎\\sigma is a faithfull labelling of G𝐺G\nif, for all arguments A,B∈𝒜𝐴𝐵𝒜A,B\\in\\mathcal{A} s.t. R−​(A)≠∅superscript𝑅𝐴\\mathit{R^{-}(A)\\neq\\emptyset} and R−​(B)≠∅superscript𝑅𝐵\\mathit{R^{-}(B)\\neq\\emptyset}, given a function φ:ℝ→𝒮:𝜑→ℝ𝒮\\varphi:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{S},\nσ𝜎\\sigma is a φ𝜑\\varphi-coherent labelling of G𝐺G\nif, for all arguments A∈𝒜𝐴𝒜A\\in\\mathcal{A},\ns.t. R−​(A)≠∅superscript𝑅𝐴\\mathit{R^{-}(A)\\neq\\emptyset}, Observe that definition of φ𝜑\\varphi-coherent labelling of G𝐺G is defined through a set of equations, as in Gabbay’s equational approach to argumentation networks 7.\nThe notion of φ𝜑\\varphi-coherent labelling requires the range of function φ𝜑\\varphi to be 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}. The notions of coherent, faithfull and φ𝜑\\varphi- coherent labelling of a weighted argumentation graph G𝐺G do not put constraints on the labelling of arguments which do not have incoming edges, provided the constraints on the labellings of all other arguments can be satisfied, depending on the semantics considered. A many-valued φ𝜑\\varphi-coherent labelling of a weigthed argumentation graph G𝐺G can be proven to be a coherent labelling or a faithfull labelling of G𝐺G, under suitable conditions on function φ𝜑\\varphi, a result which extends the one in .  Given weighted graph G=⟨𝒜,ℛ,π⟩𝐺𝒜ℛ𝜋G=\\langle\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{R},\\pi\\rangle:\n(1) A coherent labelling σ:𝒜→𝒮:𝜎→𝒜𝒮\\sigma:\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{S} of G𝐺G is a faithfull labelling of G𝐺G;\n(2) if φ𝜑\\varphi is a monotonically non-decreasing function, a φ𝜑\\varphi-coherent labelling σ𝜎\\sigma of G𝐺G is a faithfull labelling of G𝐺G;\n(3) if φ𝜑\\varphi is monotonically increasing, a φ𝜑\\varphi-coherent labelling σ𝜎\\sigma of G𝐺G is a coherent labelling of G𝐺G. In  [ref]22 it has been shown that, for labellings with values in [ref]0 [ref]0 , the notion of φ𝜑\\varphi-coherent labelling relates to the framework of gradual semantics studied by Amgoud and Doder , by considering a slight extension of Amgoud and Doder’s gradual argumentation framework so to deal with both positive and negative weights, to capture the strength of supports and attacks.\nThe notion of bipolar argumentation has been widely studied in the literature,\ne.g. in   6.\nPotyca 8 has considered an extension of the bipolar argumentation framework QBAFs by Baroni et al. which also includes the strength of attacks and supports. As observed in , since MultiLayer Perceptrons\ncan be mapped to weighted conditional knowledge bases, they can as well be seen as a weighted argumentation graphs, with positive and negative weights, under the proposed semantics. In this view,\nφ𝜑\\varphi-coherent labellings correspond to stationary states of the network, where each unit in the network is associated to an argument, synaptic connections (with their weights) correspond to attacks/supports, and the activation of units can be regarded as the values of the corresponding arguments in a labelling.\nThis is in agreement with previous work on the relationship between argumentation frameworks and neural networks,\nfirst investigated by Garcez, Gabbay and Lamb 8 and more recently by Potyca 8. While we refer to  [ref]22 for a description of the relationships of the φ𝜑\\varphi-coherent semantics with the gradual semantics studied by Amgoud and Doder ,\nlet us generalize the φ𝜑\\varphi-coherent semantics,\nby considering different functions φi:𝒜→𝒮:subscript𝜑𝑖→𝒜𝒮\\varphi_{i}:\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{S}, one for each argument Aisubscript𝐴𝑖A_{i}, rather than a single function φ𝜑\\varphi for all arguments.\nThis generalization allows, for instance, to capture MLPs in which different activation functions are associated to different layers. Given a weighted graph G=⟨𝒜,ℛ,π⟩𝐺𝒜ℛ𝜋G=\\langle\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{R},\\pi\\rangle and a function φi:ℝ→𝒮:subscript𝜑𝑖→ℝ𝒮\\varphi_{i}:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{S}, for each Ai∈𝒜subscript𝐴𝑖𝒜A_{i}\\in\\mathcal{A},\na labelling σ:𝒜→𝒮:𝜎→𝒜𝒮\\sigma:\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{S} of the graph G𝐺G is a φ𝜑\\varphi-coherent labelling of G𝐺G\nif, for all arguments Ai∈𝒜subscript𝐴𝑖𝒜A_{i}\\in\\mathcal{A} s.t. R−​(Ai)≠∅superscript𝑅subscript𝐴𝑖\\mathit{R^{-}(A_{i})\\neq\\emptyset},\nσ​(Ai)=φi​(WσG​(Ai))𝜎subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝜑𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑊𝐺𝜎subscript𝐴𝑖\\sigma(A_{i})=\\varphi_{i}(W^{G}_{\\sigma}(A_{i})). Note that restricting the domain of argument valuation to the finite number of values in 𝒞nsubscript𝒞𝑛\\mathcal{C}_{n}, allows considering finitely-valued labellings which approximate infinitely-valued ones considered in  [ref]22.\nAs a special case, for 𝒮=𝒞n𝒮subscript𝒞𝑛\\mathcal{S}=\\mathcal{C}_{n} with n=1𝑛1n=1 or n=2𝑛2n=2, one gets notions of two-valued and three-valued semantics and, for instance, in the φ𝜑\\varphi-coherent semantics, φisubscript𝜑𝑖\\varphi_{i} can be taken to be a two or three-valued approximation of the activation function of unit i𝑖i.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: In this section we generalize the gradual argumentation semantics proposed in  [ref]22,\nthe φ𝜑\\varphi-coherent semantics, whose definition is inspired to some recently studied semantics of conditional knowledge bases [ref]25 .\nAs a proof of concept, the φ𝜑\\varphi-coherent\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
