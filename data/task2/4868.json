      "content": "Paper Title: Censored Deep Reinforcement Patrolling with Information Criterion for Monitoring Large Water Resources using Autonomous Surface Vehicles\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo present the IPP and IPPP problems, we begin with the definition a navigable space X∈𝐑2𝑋superscript𝐑2X\\in\\mathbf{R}^{2}, where the vehicle can take WQ samples. We also define the subset set of sampled locations Xm​e​a​s∈𝐑2subscript𝑋𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠superscript𝐑2X_{meas}\\in\\mathbf{R}^{2}, and a binary matrix M𝑀M which is a navigability map such that X=∀p:=[px,py]|;M(p)=1X=\\forall p:=[p_{x},p_{y}]\\;|;M(p)=1. Now, we define that each visitable point p𝑝p behaves as a Gaussian random variable of mean μ𝜇\\mu and standard deviation σ𝜎\\sigma such that p≈𝒩​(μ,σ)𝑝𝒩𝜇𝜎p\\approx\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma). The space X𝑋X is thus formed as a Multivariate Gaussian Distribution (MGD), where X≈𝒩n​(𝝁,𝚺)𝑋subscript𝒩𝑛𝝁𝚺X\\approx\\mathcal{N}_{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\mu},\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\right), with ΣΣ\\Sigma being the correlation matrix of X𝑋X. The measure of the correlation between points can be obtained by means of a function that indicates how closely related two variables are in the search space. For this application, a RBF kernel has been chosen, so that the correlation between two variables decreases smoothly and exponentially with the distance between them according to the Eq. (1). This choice makes sense from the point of view of water resources monitoring since physico-chemical variables usually have a smooth distribution222https://marmenor.upct.es/maps/. Thus, two samples taken in close proximity will presumably be highly correlated and the information they both provide can be redundant. The parameter l𝑙l will serve to scale how much correlated two measurements (p,p′)𝑝superscript𝑝′(p,p^{\\prime}) are with each other and is usually chosen based on prior knowledge of the environment to be monitored   or intensity of the environment coverage. Thus, we can find the correlation matrix of the navigable space conditional on the sampled locations by the element-wise evaluation of Eq. (1). The conditional correlation matrix Σ​[X|Xm​e​a​s]Σdelimited-[]conditional𝑋subscript𝑋𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠\\Sigma\\left[X|X_{meas}\\right] will have the expression of the Eq. (2) [ref]9. Now, the monitoring objective involves decreasing the entropy associated with the conditional correlation. The information entropy H​[X|Xm​e​a​s]𝐻delimited-[]conditional𝑋subscript𝑋𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠H\\left[X|X_{meas}\\right] gives a measure of the uncertainty about the monitoring domain and the randomness of a sample at an arbitrary point in that space. The lower the entropy, the more confidence one has about the scenario. In this sense, under the assumption that the monitoring space X𝑋X is an MGD, the entropy gives a lower bound on the error of an arbitrary estimator μ^^𝜇\\hat{\\mu} , as given in the Eq. (3). Finally, the entropy can be calculated as [ref]9: An example of how the min-max normalized standard deviation values σ𝜎\\sigma of Σ​[X|Xm​e​a​s]Σdelimited-[]conditional𝑋subscript𝑋𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠\\Sigma\\left[X|X_{meas}\\right] (its diagonal) decrease when starting from a sample at ptsubscript𝑝𝑡p_{t} to pt+1subscript𝑝𝑡1p_{t+1} can be seen in Figure 2. In the vicinity of those sample points, σ𝜎\\sigma is not 1.0 at all since a smooth correlation is assumed with the RBF function.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: the element-wise evaluation of Eq.
