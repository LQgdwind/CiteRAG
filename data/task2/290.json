      "content": "Paper Title: An In-depth Walkthrough on Evolution of Neural Machine Translation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBahadanau Attention leads to high computational complexity due to its sequential nature. This was marked by computing a separate context vector for every state of the decoder. Also, from equation (3) it is observed that due to the sequential nature of RNNs, i.e. h2 will be computed after h1, there can’t be any parallelism in computation. These problems are addressed by self-attention. As stated in [ref]5, self-attention has been used in various use cases viz reading comprehension, abstractive text summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations[ref]6, [ref]7, . The transformer [ref]5 too uses self attention which is discussed in the next section. The attention mechanism can be visualised as an operation of a key (input vectors), query (last decoder hidden state), value (output of the layer) wherein the query and the key give the weights which are used to take a weighted sum with values to give the final state vector. Self attention aims to replace the sequential structure of RNNs (depending on previous state for the next state) by replacing RNNs. Instead of using hidden states for the inputs, in self attention, directly the inputs are used. As shown in figure 4, the key and value are x1, x2, … and they are operated with the query xi which belong to the same sequence; hence \"Self\" Attention. [ref]5 points out at [ref]6, [ref]7, ,  which are some of the papers that have used self attention. In [ref]6, to elicit a sense of memory in regular LSTM, an internal neural network is used to preserve the memory from a few previous states as well. This is called a LSTMN[ref]6. For sentiment analysis, Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset was used where LSTMN got 87% accuracy in binary sentiment analysis. Further, on experiments like Natural Language Inference, the dataset is Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, where the accuracy achieved was 86.3% for test data. [ref]7 is specific to Natural Language Inference and it uses a Attend-Compare-Aggregate order the mechanism is called intra-sentence attention. The accuracy on SNLI dataset is 86.8%.  focuses on sentence embedding using LSTMs and self attention. Results obtained on 3 different datasets for 3 separate tasks viz Twitter tweets for author age prediction gives 80.45% accuracy, Yelp for sentiment analysis gives 64.21% accuracy and SNLI for Textual entailment yields 84.4% which is near state of the art.  essentially combines the pros of machine learning techniques and reinforcement techniques incorporated in the encoder-decoder architecture with intra-attention (self attention) to improve the performance of text summarization. The results are obtained for CNN/Daily Mail and New York Times datasets. The metric used is called ROGUE score which is discussed in later sections. Obtained results for ML+RL+intra attention 42.94 R-1 score and 26.02 R-2 score which beats the state of the art. Another special mention of the Self attention mechanism is  which uses GANS with self attention to achieve outstanding performance in image generation, however the emphasis on this is out of scope for this discussion.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: is observed that due to the sequential nature of RNNs, i.e. h2 will be computed after h1, there can’t be any parallelism in computation.
