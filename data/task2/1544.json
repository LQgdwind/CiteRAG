      "content": "Paper Title: Visual Explanation of Black-Box Model : Similarity Difference and Uniqueness (SIDU) Method\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years deep neural networks (DNN) have resulted in ground-breaking performance in solving many complex and long-running problems of artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, employing DNN architectures in tasks such as object detection , image classification  and medical imaging  has received great attention within the AI research field. As a result, it is no surprise to observe that DNNs have become a favoring solution for any applications involving big data analysis. As human dependency on these solutions increase on a daily basis, it is crucial from both research and business standpoints to understand the underlying processes of DNNs that output a certain decision. As reported in recent works  , such decisions result from the complex inner stacked layer of the DNN that are typically referred to as ’black-box’ model. The use of the term ’black-box’ indicates how it is very challenging to understand which inner features of the model are the major contributors to the accuracy of the output . In such cases the term ’black-box’ predictors is used to aid such comprehension aspects. The interpretation ability of the ’black-box’ DNN provides transparent explanation and audit model output that is crucial for sensitive domains such as medical or risk analysis   . Consequently, a new paradigm addressing explainability of these models has emerged in AI research namely Explainable AI (XAI) [ref]9. XAI attempts to provide further insight into the black-box models and their internal interactions that enable humans to understand a machine-generated output. Furthermore, for end-users in sensitive domains, XAI gives the ability to interpret model features at the ’group level’ or ’instance level’ of the input which results in gaining greater trust for validating the outcome of deployed AI models.\nAlthough, there is no standard consensus in the literature regarding how to define a human-interpretable explanation method forthe black-box model, a widely-adopted and popular approach is to form a visual saliency map of input data showing which parts of the input have influence on the final prediction. This is motivated by the fact that the visual explanation methods can align closely with human intuition. For instance, it is more straightforward to the end-user in the medical domain to evaluate and compare the visual saliency map on a medical image produced by a DNNs model with those generated by actual clinicians. A number of visual explanation algorithms has been proposed among which methods such as LIME 0, GRAD-CAM 1 and RISE 2 are the most used examples of this class. While each of these methods can be justifiable in one way or another, apart from challenges such as gradient computation of DNN architecture (e.g., Grad-CAM) or visualizing all the perturbations modes (e.g., RISE), the generated visual explanation suffers from a lack of localizing the entire salient regions of an object, which is often required for higher classification scores.\nFollowing our prior identification of this research gap in the field, we further define it by proposing a new visual explanation approach known as SIDU 3 to address issues relating to salient region localization. SIDU stands for ’Similarity Difference and Uniqueness’ method for estimating pixel saliency by extracting the last convolutional layer of the deep CNN model and creating the similarity differences and uniqueness\nmasks that are eventually combined to form a final map for generating the visual explanation for the prediction. We briefly showed by both quantitative and qualitative analysis how SIDU can provide greater trust for the end-user in sensitive domains. The algorithm provides improved localization of the object class being questioned (see, for example, Figure. 1 d).). (a) Original image    b) GRAD-CAM       (c) RISE         (d) SIDU (proposed) This results in gaining greater trust of human expert level to rely on the deep model. This paper aims at providing a more general framework of the SIDU method by presenting the proposed method in further details whilst exploring its characteristic via various experimental studies. Concretely, the studies investigate SIDU’s visual explanation through three main levels of evaluation as proposed in 4. Since these evaluation methods have different pros and cons, the superior performance of the SIDU can be investigated at depth to provide a deeper level of insight. To the best of our knowledge, our comprehensive experiment studies of these different evaluation levels are the first in the context of XAI. Moreover, the ability of the XAI method to generalize its explanations of the black-box in different deployment scenarios can establish further trust. As evident in recent work, one example where black-box models are subject to less generalization is the presence of adversarial attack especially in sensitive domains and wider scope of trust 5. Therefore, we investigate how XAI can handle such potential threat and respectively guard against it. Our main contributions in this work can be summarized as follows: We provided step-by-step detailed explanations of the SIDU algorithm that from our investigation yielded a visual explanation map, which enabled localization of entire object classes from within an image of interest. We conducted three different types of experimental evaluations to thoroughly assess SIDU: these were coined as (1) ’Human-Grounded’, (2) ’Functionally-Grounded’, and (3) ’Application-Grounded’ evaluations. Initially for (1) we conducted an interactive experiment with eye-tracking non-expert subjects to develop a database containing natural image annotation. This was done to assess how closely human eye-fixation on natural images can be matched to the visual salient map of SIDU to recognize the object class. In a similar setting, (3) was performed to assess the retinal quality assessment, and (2) was implemented alongside an automatic casual metrics 2 on two datasets with different characteristics. Robustness of SIDU’s explanation was analyzed in the presence of adversarial attacks to show how different noise levels can affect the classification task of the black-box model as well as its explanation consistency. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents state-of-the art XAI methods, XAI evaluations methods, and adversarial attacks. SIDU is explained in section 3 with section 4 having four subsections that are devoted to a particular evaluation of SIDU. In section 4.1, Functionally-Grounded evaluation is presented. In section 4.2, Human-Grounded evaluation is applied and\nApplication-Grounded evaluation in section 4.3 is used to assess SIDU’s performance. In section 4.4, evaluation of SIDU with respect to adversarial attack is shown and lastly section 5 concludes the study and discuss future work.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: is crucial for sensitive domains such as medical or risk analysis   .
