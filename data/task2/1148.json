      "content": "Paper Title: Automorphic Equivalence-aware Graph Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets.\nThree types of real-world datasets are used, i.e., academic citation networks, social networks and e-commerce co-purchase network. Citation networks¬†: We consider 2 widely used citation networks, i.e. Cora and Citeseer. In these datasets, nodes represent academic papers and (undirected) edges denote the citation links between them.\nFollowing the setting in previous work¬†, we use each paper‚Äôs bag-of-words vector as its node feature and the subject as its label. Social networks¬†[ref]47: We use 5 real-world social networks which are collected from the Facebook friendships within 5 universities, i.e., Hamilton, Lehigh, Rochester, Johns Hopkins (JHU) and Amherst. The nodes represent students and faculties. Besides, we use one-hot encoding of their gender and major as node feature, and set the labels as their enrollment years. E-commerce co-purchase networks¬†[ref]26: This dataset was collected by crawling the music items in Amazon website. If an item aùëéa is frequently co-purchased with bùëèb, the graph contains a directed edge from aùëéa to bùëèb. We use the average ratings of items as node labels, and we set the node features as the number of reviews and downloads. Compared Methods.\nWe compare our GRAPE with state-of-the-art GNN models,\nincluding GCN¬†, GraphSAGE¬†, GIN¬†, GAT¬†[ref]48,\nGeniepath¬†, Mixhop¬†, Meta-GNN¬† and DE-GNN¬†.\nSpecifically, GCN and GraphSAGE are two most popular GNN variants, and GIN is customized to better capture structural property. Besides, GAT and Geniepath use the attention mechanism to learn adaptive neighborhood for each node. Moreover, as more recent baselines, Mixhop, Meta-GNN and DE-GNN learn node embeddings from higher-order structural information. Specifically, Mixhop proposes difference operators on different hops of neighbors; Meta-GNN leverages predefined subgraphs to identify higher-order neighborhood; DE-GNN encodes the shortest path distance among nodes. To ensure fair comparison, we follow the optimal architectures as described in previous works, and we use the official implementations released by the authors or integrated in Pytorch platform¬†. Following the common design choices in previous works¬†  [ref]48, we adopt a 222-layer architecture.\nThe hyper-parameter tuning and detailed experiment settings are discussed in Appendix¬†D.1.\nBased on the prior knowledge in related areas¬† , we design five subgraph templates (S‚ãÜsubscriptùëÜ‚ãÜS_{\\star}) for each domain of datasets respectively, which are described in Appendix¬†D.2. We use same subgraph templates for Meta-GNN for fair comparison.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: edges denote the citation links between them.\nFollowing the setting in previous work¬†, we use each paper‚Äôs bag-of-words vector as its node feature and the subject as its label. Social networks¬†[ref]47: We use 5 real-world social networks which are collected from the Facebook friendships within 5 universities, i.e., Hamilton, Lehigh, Rochester, Johns Hopkins (JHU) and Amherst. The nodes\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. Generate exactly 40 titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning."
