      "content": "Paper Title: Automatically detecting the conflicts between software requirements based on finer semantic analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDetecting the conflicts between software requirements has always been a hot topic in software engineering, and there have been a few pretty good studies. Egyed and Grünbacher  detected the cooperating and conflicting relations between natural language requirements based on the trace dependencies among requirements, with the usage of a tool-supported trace analysis technique .\nBesides the NL requirements, they also need the associations between requirements and test scenarios as the input. Kim et al.  require requirements described in goals and scenarios using the authoring structure, which contains Action (Verb) + Object (Object) + Resource (Resource).\nThey can automatically detect two types of conflicts which are syntactic conflict meaning requirements conflicts according to a predefined condition, such as “Different Verb ⋂\\bigcap Same object”, “Same Verb ⋂\\bigcap Different Object”, or “Same Resource”, and semantic conflict including activity conflicts and resource conflicts. Moser et al.  proposed an ontology-based approach OntReq to detect three types of conflicts: conflict between requirements (CRR), conflict between a requirement with a constraint (CRC), conflict between a requirement with a formal guideline(CRG), i.e., ill-formed requirement.\nThey require functional requirements and constraints, including technical constraints, requirement constraints, documentation guidelines and glossary as inputs.\nAnd functional requirements must follow the EBNF template, specifying under which conditions a target system should provide a certain functionality regarding a specific object to a certain entity or role. Ali et al.  applied SAT-based techniques  to automatically check the consistency between contextual requirements and the consistency between executable tasks.\nThey require requirements represented by a contextual goal model, which is the environment in which the system operates.\nAnd they defined two conflict types: conflicting changes (many processes try simultaneously to change the same object into different states) and exclusive possession (processes need an exclusive possession of an object). Chentouf [ref]13 require requirements in a controlled natural language derived from KAOS .\nHe focused on three conflict types: duplicated requirement (two requirements being exactly the same or one being included in the other), incompatible requirements (two requirements are ambiguous, incompatible, or contradictory), assumption alteration (the output of one requirement’s operation is part of the inputs or outputs of the other’s operation).\nUnfortunately, this work doesn’t include an automated approach or the critical detection algorithms. Salado and Nilchiani 4 traced requirements to stakeholders’ needs, and automatically constructed the tension matrix (including resources, phases of matter, laws of physics, laws of society, and logical contradictions) to identify potential conflicting requirements.\nBased on the tension matrix, they defined five conflicts types from resources, phases of matter, laws of physics, laws of society and logical contradictions.\nTheir method is particularly effective for the requirements containing quantitative numbers. Walter et al. 8 formalized NL requirements into conjunctive normal form (CNF) using specification pattern systems (SPS), linear temporal logic (LTL) and first order logic (FOL) semi-automatically.\nThey only focus on redundant requirement specifications. Moitra et al.  need the requirements specified with Semantic Application Design Language (SADL) .\nThey perform formal analysis using ACL2 Sedan tool  automatically and resolve errors during the requirements authoring process. According to their formal rules, they only detect conflicting or incomplete requirements. From the above simple survey, we can make the following observations: The input formats of requirements can be mainly divided into two categories: in natural language and in specific format, usually constraint format.\nGiven that most software requirements are in natural language in practice , the approaches with specific formal format need more transforming work for practical purposes.\nHowever, the transforming work is often unavailable. Many methods require external data to assist or promote requirement formalization and inconsistence detection, such as the tracing between requirements and test scenarios , glossary  and stakeholder’ needs 4.\nHowever, some data is usually hard to acquire, even unavailable . These work focus on different kinds of conflicts from diverse perspectives, although with small portion of overlapping. Only [ref]13 and 4 provide public dataset. Unavailable data causes inconvenience of the work reproducing and testing.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: conflicting changes (many processes try simultaneously to change the same object into different states) and exclusive possession (processes need an exclusive possession of an object). Chentouf [ref]13 require requirements in a controlled natural language derived from KAOS .\nHe focused on three conflict types: duplicated requirement (two requirements being exactly the same or one being\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
