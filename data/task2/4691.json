      "content": "Paper Title: Detailed saliency maps generation using model-agnostic methods\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAnother issue pointed out by \"Sanity Checks\", were the risks of assessing accuracy of saliency maps through visual inspection alone.\nDue to a lack of established quantitative metrics at that time, publications often relied on qualitative, visual assessment  [ref]13 .\nAs maps generated for randomized networks still showed an outline of the salient object, they were no less visually convincing than maps generated for unaltered networks, even though the former had absolutely no basis for being an accurate representation of the model‚Äôs state.\nIn consequence, solely qualitative assessment carried the risk of giving more credit to inaccurate but visually convincing explanations than accurate, but less impressive ones. As for currently available quantitative alternatives, some rely on man-made annotations for object localization task (Pointing Game¬†[ref]18, overlap with bounding box¬†), while others seek a human-independent approach (pixel-flipping [ref]16 and its extensions: AOPC¬† and CausalMetric¬†). The pixel-flipping metrics measure map quality by using saliency information contained in the map to guide the input perturbation process, starting with the most salient regions. Increasingly perturbed copies of the original image are passed to the model and resulting confidence scores for explained class are recorded. The quicker the scores decrease, the better the map.\nThe primary difference between AOPC and CausalMetric is how each method approaches perturbation. AOPC applies spatially contiguous perturbations (k√ókùëòùëòk\\times k non-overlapping pixel neighborhoods), while CausalMetric removes pixels in order of saliency and so the set of pixels removed in a single step might not be spatially contiguous. Furthermore, CausalMetric proposes an additional, \"constructive\" variant of this approach, which reintroduces the original image onto its blurred (or otherwise obfuscated) copy instead of removing it. These human-independent metrics offer an arguably better approach, since saliency methods should be evaluated in terms of faithfulness to the explained model, not its compliance with human cognition. However, this group of metrics has recently come under scrutiny¬† for inconsistency and high variance of results. Hooker et al.¬† proposed ROAR - a dedicated approach to evaluation of saliency methods, based on measuring prediction accuracy loss after retraining on dataset partially occluded by its own saliency maps. Here, saliency maps are generated for the entire dataset, then the most salient X% of data is removed from each image according to its respective saliency map and the classifier is retrained on such modified dataset. This procedure is repeated for progressively larger values of X.\nIn consequence, this technique measures the loss of capacity to learn to reliably recognize these object classes, rather than the loss of capacity to recognize them.\nA fundamental disadvantage of this technique is the enormous cost or repeated retraining, as well as unsuitability for evaluation of individual saliency maps. However, the field has still not reached a consensus on what metrics should be used. Although solely qualitative assessment has been abandoned, an indisputably reliable quantitative metric is yet to be found. We elaborate on our choice of metrics in sec.¬†4.1.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: of assessing accuracy of saliency maps through visual inspection alone.\nDue to a lack of established quantitative metrics at that time, publications often relied on qualitative, visual assessment  [ref]13 .\nAs maps generated for randomized networks still showed an outline of the salient object, they were no less visually convincing than maps generated for unaltered networks, even though the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
