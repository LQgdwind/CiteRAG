      "content": "Paper Title: Node Selection Toward Faster Convergence for Federated Learning on Non-IID Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now present empirical results for the proposed probabilistic node selection strategy. We implement FedPNS on different tasks, models, datasets, and compare with commonly used benchmark FedAvg. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Optimal Aggregation in enlarging the expected decrement of FL global loss and in identifying the potential adverse local updates (Section V-A). Then, the superiority of the proposed FedPNS in presence of different data heterogeneity is illustrated in Section V-B. The choice α𝛼\\alpha and β𝛽\\beta for adjusting node probability in FedPNS are discussed in Section V-C. In Section V-D, by tracking the norm of gradient on different nodes, the Assumption 3 is empirically justified. In addition, we also compare the proposed FedPNS with an existing work that uses the norm of gradient ‖∇Fi​(𝐰t)‖norm∇subscript𝐹𝑖superscript𝐰𝑡\\|\\nabla F_{i}(\\mathbf{w}^{t})\\| [ref]19 for node selection. All code, data, and experiments are publicly available as an open-source GitHub repository at: github.com/HongdaWu1226/FedPNS. We briefly describe our adopted datasets, learning model, and experiment setting as follows. Synthetic data. To better characterize the data heterogeneity and study its impact on model convergence, we generate synthetic data by following the similar setup as in [ref]9 . In particular, the data samples {𝐱,y}𝐱𝑦\\{\\mathbf{x},y\\} on local node i𝑖i are generated according to the model y=a​r​g​m​a​x​(softmax​(𝐰𝐱+b)),𝐱∈ℝ60,𝐰∈ℝ10×60,b∈ℝ10formulae-sequence𝑦𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥softmax𝐰𝐱𝑏formulae-sequence𝐱superscriptℝ60formulae-sequence𝐰superscriptℝ1060𝑏superscriptℝ10y=argmax({\\rm softmax}(\\mathbf{wx}+b)),\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{60},\\mathbf{w}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{10\\times 60},b\\in\\mathbb{R}^{10}. We set 𝐰,b∽𝒩​(0,1)∽𝐰𝑏𝒩01\\mathbf{w},b\\backsim\\mathcal{N}(0,1).

As such, a big value of ϱitalic-ϱ\\varrho denotes a more heterogeneous data scenario. The training set and testing set are randomly split with 80%−20%percent80percent2080\\%-20\\% proportion on each node. A Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) model is applied to the synthetic data. Real data. We explore different learning objectives on different real datasets, which are considered in prior works [ref]6 [ref]9. In Section V-B, we start with a convex classification problem with MNIST  using MLR model. Then, for the non-convex setting, we consider two CNN models for MNIST and CIFAR-10, which are referred as CNN-M666The CNN-M model has 7 layers with the following structure: 5×5×105510\\rm 5\\times 5\\times 10 Convolutional →2×2→absent22\\rightarrow 2\\times 2 MaxPool →→\\rightarrow 5×5×205520\\rm 5\\times 5\\times 20 Convolutional →2×2→absent22\\rightarrow 2\\times 2 MaxPool →320×50→absent32050\\rightarrow 320\\times 50 Fully connected →50×10→absent5010\\rightarrow 50\\times 10 Fully connected →→\\rightarrow Softmax. The second convolutional layer is with 50% dropout. All Convolutional and Fully connected layers are mapped by ReLu activation. and CNN-C777The CNN-C model has 8 layers as structured follows: 5×5×6556\\rm 5\\times 5\\times 6 Convolutional →2×2→absent22\\rightarrow 2\\times 2 MaxPool →→\\rightarrow 5×5×165516\\rm 5\\times 5\\times 16 Convolutional →2×2→absent22\\rightarrow 2\\times 2 MaxPool →400×120→absent400120\\rightarrow 400\\times 120 Fully connected →120×84→absent12084\\rightarrow 120\\times 84 Fully connected →84×10→absent8410\\rightarrow 84\\times 10 Fully connected →→\\rightarrow Softmax. ReLu activation is applied to all layers. hereinafter. Through the experimental result, unless otherwise specified, we evaluate the accuracy of the trained models using the testing set from each dataset.
