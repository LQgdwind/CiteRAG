      "content": "Paper Title: Patch-level Representation Learning for Self-supervised Vision Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved successful results in learning visual representations from unlabeled images with a variety of elaborate pretext tasks, including contrastive learning   [ref]7, clustering , and pseudo-labeling   . The common nature of their designs is on utilizing different augmentations from the same image as the positive pairs, i.e., they learn representations to be invariant to the augmentations. The SSL approaches without utilizing human-annotated labels have been competitive with or even outperformed the standard supervised learning [ref]20 in various downstream tasks, including image classification [ref]7, object detection , and segmentation . Meanwhile, motivated by the success of Transformers 7 in natural language processing  , Vision Transformers (ViTs) 3 5 6 have gained much attention as an alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with superior performance over CNNs in various visual tasks 5 3. For example, ViT-S/16 5 has a 1.8×\\tt 1.8\\times faster throughput than ResNet-152 [ref]20 with higher accuracy in the ImageNet 1 benchmark. There have been several recent attempts to apply existing self-supervision techniques to ViTs  6 . Although the techniques have shown to be also effective with ViTs, they\ndo not fully utilize the architectural advantages of ViTs, i.e., their pretext tasks are architecture-agnostic. For example, ViTs are able to process patch-level representations, but pretext tasks used in the existing SSL schemes only use the whole image-level self-supervision\nwithout considering learning patch-level representations.\nAs a result, existing self-supervised ViTs   may fail to capture semantically meaningful relations among patches; e.g., collapsed self-attention maps of among patches as shown in the second row of Fig. 1.\nThis limitation inspires us to investigate the following question: how to utilize architectural characteristics of ViTs for improving the quality of learned patch-level representations without human-annotated supervision? Contribution.\nIn this paper,\nwe propose a simple yet effective SSL scheme for learning patch-level representations, coined SelfPatch,\nwhich can be beneficial to various visual downstream tasks.\nOur patch-level SSL scheme, SelfPatch, can be incorporated into any image-level self-supervised ViT, e.g., DINO , MoCo-v3 \nand MoBY 6, for learning both global (i.e., image-level) and local (i.e., patch-level) information simultaneously. Fig. 1 shows that SelfPatch enhances the quality of self-attention maps of DINO, which is evidence that SelfPatch encourages to learn better patch-level representations. Our key idea is to treat semantically similar neighboring patches as positive samples motivated by the following prior knowledge: adjacent patches often share a common semantic context. Since there might be multiple positive patches (but we do not know exactly which patches are positive), we first select a fixed number of adjacent patches for positive candidates using the cosine similarity between patch representations of the current model. Here, some of them might still be noisy (e.g., not positive), and for the purpose of denoising, we summarize their patch representations by utilizing an additional attention-based aggregation module on the top of ViT.\nThen, we minimize the distance between each patch representation and the corresponding summarized one.\nWe provide an overall illustration of the proposed scheme in Fig. 2(a). To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we pre-train ViT-S/16 5 on the ImageNet 1 dataset and evaluate transferring performance on a wide range of dense prediction downstream tasks:\n(a) COCO object detection and instance segmentation ,\n(b) ADE20K semantic segmentation 8,\nand (c) DAVIS 2017 video object segmentation 2.\nSpecifically, our method improves the state-of-the-art image-level self-supervision, DINO , with a large margin, e.g., +1.3 APbbbb{}^{\\text{bb}} (i.e., 40.8 →→\\rightarrow 42.1) on COCO detection (see Tab. 1), and +2.9 mIoU (i.e., 38.3 →→\\rightarrow 41.2) on ADE20K segmentation (see Tab. 2). As a result, our method outperforms all the SSL baselines [ref]7  9 4 3 6 such as DenseCL 9. Furthermore,\nwe demonstrate high compatibility of SelfPatch by incorporating\nwith various objectives (e.g., MoBY 6), architectures (e.g., Swin Transformer ), and patch sizes (e.g., 8×8888\\times 8). For example, SelfPatch improves MoBY 6 for both ViT and Swin Transformer by +4.8 and +5.6 (𝒥&ℱ)msubscript𝒥ℱ𝑚(\\mathcal{J}\\&\\mathcal{F})_{m}, respectively, on the DAVIS video segmentation benchmark 2 (see Tab. 5). Overall, our work highlights the importance of learning patch-level representations during pre-training ViTs in a self-supervised manner. We hope that ours could inspire researchers to rethink the under-explored problem and provide a new direction of patch-level self-supervised learning.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved successful results in learning visual representations from unlabeled images with a variety of elaborate pretext tasks, including contrastive learning   [ref]7, clustering , and pseudo-labeling   .
