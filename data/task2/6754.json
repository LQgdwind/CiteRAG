      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Scene-Text to Scene-Text Translation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVT-Syn. To study visual translation, a dataset is required which contains paired images of text in different languages with identical visual properties (style, font, orientation, and size). However, obtaining such data from the real world is impractical due to the rarity of visually identical translated texts. To overcome this challenge, we introduce VT-Syn, a synthetically generated corpus of 600K visually diverse translated word images in six languages: English, Hindi, Chinese, Bengali, Tamil, and German. We utilized an Indic-language scene-text image generator  and modified it to generate samples of scene-text in paired languages with controllable parameters for font, style, color, and spatial transformations to ensure visual diversity. Each sample contains source image (xs​r​csubscript𝑥𝑠𝑟𝑐x_{src}), target word image (xwsubscript𝑥𝑤x_{w}), background image (xb​gsubscript𝑥𝑏𝑔x_{bg}), foreground image (xf​gsubscript𝑥𝑓𝑔x_{fg}), and target image (xt​g​tsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑔𝑡x_{tgt}). We collect 560 publicly available fonts and use a vocabulary of 3K commonly used words in each target language and use  to get the corresponding translations in source language. Few samples from VT-Syn are shown in Figure 5. Train-Test Split: The dataset is divided into six categories of translations: (i) English →→\\rightarrow Hindi, (ii) English →→\\rightarrow Chinese, (iii) English →→\\rightarrow Bengali, (iv) English →→\\rightarrow Tamil, (v) English →→\\rightarrow German, and (vi) Hindi →→\\rightarrow English, each set containing 100K samples. We use 85K, 10K, and 5K samples chosen at random for the train, test and validation set, respectively. Data and generation code will be made publicly available. More details provided in the supplementary material. ICDAR 2013 [ref]25 was created as part of the ICDAR Robust Reading Competition [ref]25. It consists of 1.1K natural scene-text images that primarily feature English words. Despite not including paired images of translated words, we use this dataset to evaluate the performance of the baselines on real-world images using text recognition accuracy as an indirect metric. IIIT-ILST  consists of 3K multilingual natural scene-text images, and was proposed to evaluate scene-text recognition methods in Indic languages . We use a subset of this dataset containing Hindi words to evaluate Hin→→\\toEng baselines. Temper-Syn2k and Temper-Scene [ref]40 are evaluation datasets for the conventional scene-text editing task. Temper-Syn2k contains 2K synthetically created English word pairs, and Temper-Scene contains 7.7K real scene-text source images. We evaluate VTNet on this data to understand its performance in the conventional English-to-English scene-text editing task. Additionally, we also create 25 digital-born images of internet memes and lecture slides to qualitatively analyze the performance of our model on digital images in Section 8.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: chosen at random for the train, test and validation set, respectively.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
