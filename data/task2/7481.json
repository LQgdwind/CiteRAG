      "content": "Paper Title: Constrained Multi-objective Optimization with Deep Reinforcement Learning Assisted Operator Selection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConstrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) contain multiple conflicting objective functions and constraints, which widely exist in real-world applications and scientific research . For example, web service location-allocation problems  and vehicle scheduling of urban bus lines . The development of solving CMOPs by constrained multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) has seen prominent growth due to the wide existence of this kind of problem. Generally, a CMOEA contains three key components that affect its performance: the algorithmic strategy used to assist the selection procedures, the constraint-handling technique (CHT) to handle constraints, and the evolutionary operator to generate new solutions. In the past decade, a large number of CMOEAs have been proposed, most of which focus on enhancing algorithmic strategies     and CHTs  [ref]8. By contrast, little research focused on how to adaptively select the evolutionary operator in CMOEAs has been reported in the literature. According to , different evolutionary operators 111An evolutionary operator means the operations of an evolutionary algorithm used for generating offspring solution, such as the crossover and mutation of GA, the differential variation of DE, and the particle swarm update of PSO/CSO. are suited to different optimization problems. For example, crossovers in Genetic Algorithms (GAs) 0 are effective in overcoming multimodal features; mutations in Differential Evolution (DE) 1 can handle complex linkages of variables because they use the weighted difference between two other solutions. The Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) 2 shows good performance on convergence speed and the Competitive Swarm Optimizer (CSO) 3 is good at dealing with large-scale optimization problems because of its competitive mechanism, and the multi-objective PSO (MOPSO) 4 5 is particularly designed and effective for multi-objective situations. Given the fact that a real-world CMOP is usually subject to unknown features and challenges, using a fixed evolutionary operator will limit the applicability of a CMOEA. Although ensemble and adaptive selection of operators have received increased attention in the multi-objective optimization community 6 7 8, unfortunately, no research efforts have been dedicated to constrained multi-objective optimization. Hence, it is necessary to study the effect of adaptive operator selection in dealing with CMOPs. Among the Reinforcement Learning community, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is an emerging topic and has been applied in several real-world applications in the multi-objective optimization field 9 0 1 2 3. Also, its effectiveness in dealing with multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) has been studied recently 4 7 5. Since DRL uses a deep neural network to approximate the action-value function, it can handle continuous state space and thereby is suitable for operator selection for CMOPs because a population could have infinite states during the evolution. Therefore, it is promising to adopt DRL techniques to fill the research gap of operator selection in handling CMOPs. However, when applying DRL to CMOPs, the main challenge is to properly consider constraint satisfaction and feasibility in a DRL model. This work proposes a DRL-assisted online operator selection framework for CMOPs. Specifically, the main contributions are as follows: We propose a novel DRL model for operator selection in CMOPs. The state of the population, including the convergence, diversity, and feasibility performance, is viewed as the state, the candidate operators are regarded as actions, and the improvement of the population state is the reward. Then, we develop a Deep Q-Learning (DQL)-assisted operator selection framework for CMOEAs. A deep Q-Network (DQN) is trained to learn a policy that estimates the Q-value of an action at the current state. The proposed model can contain an arbitrary number of operators and the proposed framework can be easily employed in any CMOEA. In this work, we develop an Operator Selection (OS) method and further instantiate it by using GA and DE as candidate operators in the DRL model. Then, the OS is embedded into four popular CMOEAs: CCMO , PPS 6, MOEA/D-DAE 7, and EMCMO . Extensive experimental studies on four popular and challenging CMOP benchmark test suites demonstrated that the OS method can significantly improve the performance of CMOEAs. Furthermore, compared to nine state-of-the-art CMOEAs, our methods obtained better versatility on different problems. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section II introduces the related work. Section III elaborates on the proposed methods. Then, experiments and analysis are presented in Section IV. Finally, conclusions and future research directions are given in Section V.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: and the evolutionary operator to generate new solutions.
