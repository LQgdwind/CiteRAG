      "content": "Paper Title: Topology Optimization of Multiscale Structures Considering Local and Global Buckling Response\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years advances in additive manufacturing have facilitated the fabrication of multiscale or infill structures , which in turn has further promoted topology optimization of multiscale structures. The fact that structures with tailored microstructures can be manufactured means that multiscale structures are no longer restricted to theoretical research but can actually be utilized in real designs. A lot of research considering multiscale structural optimization following the original work of Bendsøe and Kikuchi  has been done in recent years as reviewed by Wu, Sigmund and Groen . Work in  showed that multiscale designs can be projected to singlescale using an implicit geometry description. This work was elaborated in  [ref]6 for 2D problems and   for 3D. Previous multiscale structural optimization has mainly focused on compliance minimization without considering structural stability. Recently, singlescale studies of buckling optimization has become more popular. Work in  focused on the the use of linear buckling with the scope of solving large scale topology optimization. An extension of this is the work in 0, where buckling resistance and local ductile failure constraints are combined. Furthermore, the work in 1 considers singlescale buckling optimization, using the Topology Optimization of Binary Structures (TOBS) method, subject to design dependent pressure loads. This method is limited to singlescale optimization due to the binary nature of the TOBS method. Recent work in 2 focused on singlescale buckling optimization using the level set method. Work on multiscale stability optimization is only sparsely covered in literature. Recent work in 3 focuses on using filleted lattice structures considering a simplified local buckling formulation and yield stress constraints for compliance optimization. The method lacks the opportunity to generate true void and solid due to the local stress constraints and strut radii bounds used in the microstructure. As a result microstructures appear in the entire design domain even though global buckling is not considered and multiscale isotropic material is sub-optimal for compliance optimized designs 4. Earlier work 5 has shown that isotropic infill may increase structural buckling resistance at the price of a small stiffness reduction even with a predefined constant infill density. To fully explore the potential buckling resistance, this study suggests to freely optimize the isotropic microstructure infill densities in the entire design domain via topology optimization. Previous studies have shown that microstructure buckling strength can be evaluated using Bloch-Floquet wave theory 6 7. Based on buckling stability analysis of a chosen microstructure evaluated at different densities it is possible to formulate interpolation functions for local buckling stress constraints. Combining this with a global buckling optimization provides a way of performing buckling optimization of multiscale structures. In this work, the global buckling load is estimated using the linearized buckling analysis framework presented in 8, as it increases computational efficiency, while producing sufficiently accurate buckling estimates as discussed in  9. Furthermore, the robust formulation by 0 and two-field formulation by 1 are used to allow control over the minimum density, thus allowing true void in the design. We consider local and global buckling topology optimization of multiscale structures composed of a fixed isotropic triangular microstructure with spatially varying density. The stiffness of the isotropic triangular microstructure is very close to the theoretical maximum provided by the Hashin-Shtrikman (HS) upper bound 2 as found in e.g. 3. Thus, instead of performing a formal homogenization approach to compute the effective properties of the triangular microstructure, we can simply use the bulk and shear modulus provided by the HS upper bound to model its elastic properties 4 4 5. For pure single-load compliance minimization problems, the use of the isotropic (near-optimal) microstructure is suboptimal and results in 0–1, non-composite solutions, c.f. 4. For such problems, orthotropic rank-2 or rectangular hole microstructures are optimal, however, such microstructures have low shear stiffness and thus perform badly in terms of buckling stability 6. For this reason, we here opt for the stiffness sub-optimal but buckling-superior triangular microstructure. An added benefit of the stiffness isotropic triangular microstructure is that its buckling response is rather isotropic as well, thus making the establishing of a buckling “yield surface” considerably simpler. A comparison of the stiffness interpolations using HS and standard SIMP (p=3) interpolations is visualized in Figure 1(a). The difference between the two interpolation schemes is significant for lower densities and explains the advantage of using microstructures when considering buckling. Using the two schemes for pure compliance minimization confirms, contrary to optimally oriented rank-2 laminates or rectangular hole cells, that there is no advantage in using isotropic infill for compliance (C), see Figure 1(c), c.f. 4. The small difference in compliances is simply a result of the different stiffness interpolations acting in the intermediate density regions that occur due to the density filter. However, for buckling load maximization large differences are visible in both design and performance as measured by the Buckling Load Factor (BLF). The design obtained using SIMP (seen in the upper half of Figure 1(b)) is black and white as intermediate densities are penalized. The multiscale design, based on the HS interpolation (seen in the lower part of Figure 1(b)), shows a large region of intermediate densities. The explanation lies in the higher stiffness for intermediate densities provided by the HS interpolation compared to SIMP as seen in Figure 1(a). Comparing the performance of the two designs shows a 14.62% improvement in global buckling stability for the multiscale design. This indicates that isotropic microstructures are superior for buckling objectives. Of course this is only true if the structure does not reach local buckling of the infill before global buckling is reached. Therefore, local buckling stability must be taken into account when optimizing against buckling using topology optimization of multiscale structures. This paper will present the work flow for performing topology optimization of multiscale structures while preventing buckling on both local and global scale. This is done according to the work flow illustrated in Figure 2. The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 the optimization problem for multiscale structures is presented. This includes a multifield method, interpolations and buckling stress constraint. Section 3 presents the results of two numerical examples demonstrating the advantage of the method. Finally, Section 4 concludes the work presented in this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: in recent years as reviewed by Wu, Sigmund and Groen .
