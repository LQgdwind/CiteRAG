      "content": "Paper Title: To Beam Or Not To Beam: That is a Question of Cooperation for Language GANs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNatural Language Generation encompasses tasks such as Machine Translation, Summarization or Data To Text generation. The real life applications are numerous, but require highly reliable and fluent models.\nDespite significant advances, state-of-the-art models are still known to be de-generated, with outputs containing repetitions and even nonfactual information i.e. hallucination . Among the culprits is a limitation of Teacher Forcing : the loss is computed at a token level while the aim is to produce complete sequences.\nMoreover, while a single ground-truth reference is considered correct, several realizations of the same content may exist.\nFinally, the model is subject to Exposure Bias , i.e. a mismatch between training and inference distributions ‚Äì in the latter, the model has no access to ground truth for the previously generated tokens. The literature has considered this mismatch responsible for the lower quality observed when generating longer sequences¬†[ref]2 [ref]16. To overcome such Teacher Forcing limitations, a consensus has emerged: a sequence level objective should be introduced  . A body of work has proposed to use Reinforcement Learning (RL) with standard NLG metrics like BLEU  or ROUGE . However, NLG metrics are known to not reflect well human judgement , which explains why the resulting models tend to be qualitatively worse than their MLE baselines [ref]3. To move toward less biased metrics, a natural alternative is to evaluate the output with a learned discriminator. An ideal discriminator would not be biased w.r.t. to its training set, and could therefore be considered as a perfect metric that matches human consensus. Note that discriminators are already reported to be highly accurate to distinguish human written texts from machine generated ones  . In light of this observation, two concurrent approaches have been explored: i) at training time, using Generative Adversarial Networks ; and ii) at inference time, via cooperative decoding : a discriminator guides the search algorithm, such that the generator and the discriminator cooperate to select the generated tokens. These approaches pursue the same objective: producing texts more similar to what a human writes. Both methodologies suffer from specific limitations. Cooperative decoding algorithms rely on a discriminator that re-ranks a limited set of candidates selected by the generator.111Opposed to a generator that outputs probabilities for the entire vocabulary VùëâV at once, a discriminator outputs the likelihood for a specific sequence to be human-written or machine-generated.\nCalculating the discriminator probability for every possible sequence is therefore not realistic, as the computation grows exponentially at a pace of VlsuperscriptùëâùëôV^{l} where VùëâV is the vocabulary size and lùëôl the sequence length. Hence, cooperative decoding algorithms are limited by the generator ability to rank relevant tokens in a good enough position.\nOn the other hand, language GANs are learned via reinforcement learning due to the discrete nature of text. This makes them particularly unstable to train, and usually fall short compared to Teacher Forcing [ref]3. In standard Language GANs, the discriminator provides a reward for the entire sequence, which can be difficult to exploit by the generator due to its sparsity . In this paper, we propose SelfGAN, a framework to learn language GANs in a Self-training process where the signal from the discriminator is passed to the generator in a completely new way. We consider cooperative algorithms as a way to infuse the discriminator signal.\nWe start from a simple observation: outputs obtained via cooperative decoding are more human-like, compared to their generator-only counterparts.\nInspired by recent knowledge distillation approaches, we propose to consider cooperative outputs as targets in a Teacher Forcing training process:\ncooperative decoding stands as a teacher we attempt to imitate through the generator network.\nJust like a standard GAN, both the generator and the discriminator are trained at each step. While the generator improves, it becomes adversarial to the discriminator, which benefits from the cooperative generation. The discriminator, now trained on improved sequences, also contributes to improve the cooperative generation, and so forth.\nNote that in SelfGANs the discriminator is only used to drive the cooperative generation and never to provide a reward signal like in standard Language GANs. SelfGAN can be implemented with any cooperative decoding algorithm. Current cooperative approaches   rely on \"myopic\" algorithms like Beam Search or Sampling that generate the tokens left-to-right. The model has to always predict the next word, and can never look back and revise past choices. In some cases, despite all the candidates being judged to likely not be human by the discriminator, the model is locked in a dead-end. This behavior is quite unnatural for humans ‚Äì who often proofread their texts. We refer to this phenomenon as the left-to-right curse. To address this left-to-right curse, we introduce Coop-MCTS, a new decoding algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)  . We compare Coop-MCTS to state-of-the-art cooperative decoding algorithms in two scenarios: i) inference time, as the decoding algorithm; and ii) during training, as the cooperative algorithm in SelfGAN. In both scenarios, we show that the respective resulting outputs are more likely to look like human texts and improve all the automatic metrics. All in all, our contributions can be summarized as follows: SelfGAN We propose a new training framework based on cooperative decoding, wherein the generated sequences are used as ground truth; Coop-MCTS We improve cooperative decoding with a new decoding algorithm, Coop-MCTS, offering a solution to the left-to-right limitation of current search methods; We show that combining SelfGAN and Coop-MCTS compare favorably to prior state-of-the-art results on two challenging tasks, Summarization and Question Generation.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: the model has no access to ground truth for the previously generated tokens.
