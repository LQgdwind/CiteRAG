      "content": "Paper Title: The complexity of quantified constraints: collapsibility, switchability and the algebraic formulation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA large body of work exists from the past twenty years on\napplications of universal algebra to the computational complexity of\nconstraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and a number of\ncelebrated results have been obtained through this method.\nOne considers the problem CSP(ℬ)ℬ(\\mathcal{B}) in which it is asked whether an input\nsentence φ𝜑\\varphi holds on ℬℬ\\mathcal{B}, a constraint language (equivalently, relational structure), where φ𝜑\\varphi is\nprimitive positive, that is using only ∃\\exists, ∧\\land and ==. The CSP is one of a wide class of model-checking problems obtained from restrictions of first-order logic. For almost all of these classes, we can give a complexity\nclassification [ref]6. Since the celebrated proofs of the Feder-Vardi “Dichotomy” Conjecture for CSPs  [ref]8 , the only\noutstanding class (other than its natural dual) is quantified\nCSPs (QCSPs) for positive Horn sentences – where ∀for-all\\forall is also present – which is used in\nArtificial Intelligence to model non-monotone reasoning or\nuncertainty . It is well-known that the complexity classification for QCSPs embeds the classification for CSPs: if ℬ+1ℬ1\\mathcal{B}+1 is ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} with the addition of a new isolated element not appearing in any relations, then CSP(ℬ)ℬ(\\mathcal{B}) and QCSP(ℬ+1)ℬ1(\\mathcal{B}+1) are polynomially equivalent. Thus the classification for QCSPs may be considered a project at least as hard as that for CSPs. The following is the merger of Conjectures 6 and 7 in  which we call the Chen Conjecture. Let ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} be a finite relational structure expanded with constants naming all the elements. If Pol​(ℬ)Polℬ\\textrm{Pol}(\\mathcal{B}) has PGP, then QCSP​(ℬ)QCSPℬ\\textrm{QCSP}(\\mathcal{B}) is in NP; otherwise QCSP​(ℬ)QCSPℬ\\textrm{QCSP}(\\mathcal{B}) is Pspace-complete. In , Conjecture 6 gives the NP membership and Conjecture 7 the Pspace-completeness. The first contribution of this paper is to prove that the NP membership of Conjecture 6 is indeed true. We do this by proving equivalent two notions of switchability that allows to combine known results from  and . On the way we develop the notions of non-degenerate and projective adversaries that enable us to prove our result as well as particular observations on the existing notions of switchability and collapsibility. The second contribution of this paper is Theorem 2 below, but note that we permit infinite signatures (languages) although our domains remain finite. This will involve deciding how to encode relations of Inv​(𝔸)Inv𝔸\\textrm{Inv}(\\mathbb{A}) and will be discussed in detail later. Let 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} be an idempotent algebra on a finite domain A𝐴A. If 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} satisfies PGP, then QCSP(Inv​(𝔸))Inv𝔸(\\mathrm{Inv}(\\mathbb{A})) is in NP. Otherwise, QCSP(Inv​(𝔸))Inv𝔸(\\mathrm{Inv}(\\mathbb{A})) is co-NP-hard. Note that, with infinite languages, the NP-membership for Theorem 2 requires a little extra work. We are also able to refute the following form. Let 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} be an idempotent algebra on a finite domain A𝐴A. If 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} satisfies PGP, then for every finite subset Δ⊆Inv​(𝔸)ΔInv𝔸\\Delta\\subseteq\\mathrm{Inv}(\\mathbb{A}), QCSP(Δ)Δ(\\Delta) is in NP. Otherwise, there exists a finite subset Δ⊆Inv​(𝔸)ΔInv𝔸\\Delta\\subseteq\\mathrm{Inv}(\\mathbb{A}) so that QCSP(Δ)Δ(\\Delta) is co-NP-hard. The Alternative Chen Conjecture was not posed by Chen himself, but is nonetheless natural. In proving Theorem 2 we are saying that the complexity of QCSPs, with all constants included, is classified modulo the complexity of (infinite language) CSPs, a subject to which we will return later. Let 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} be an idempotent algebra on a finite domain A𝐴A. Either QCSP(Inv​(𝔸))Inv𝔸(\\mathrm{Inv}(\\mathbb{A})) is co-NP-hard or QCSP(Inv​(𝔸))Inv𝔸(\\mathrm{Inv}(\\mathbb{A})) has the same complexity as CSP(Inv​(𝔸))Inv𝔸(\\mathrm{Inv}(\\mathbb{A})). In this manner, our result follows in the footsteps of the similar result for the Valued CSP, which has also had its complexity classified modulo the CSP, as culminated in the paper 1. For a finite-domain algebra 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} we associate a function\nf𝔸:ℕ→ℕ:subscript𝑓𝔸→ℕℕf_{\\mathbb{A}}:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}, giving the cardinality\nof the minimal generating sets of the sequence 𝔸,𝔸2,𝔸3,…𝔸superscript𝔸2superscript𝔸3…\\mathbb{A},\\mathbb{A}^{2},\\mathbb{A}^{3},\\ldots as f𝔸​(1),f𝔸​(2),f𝔸​(3),…subscript𝑓𝔸1subscript𝑓𝔸2subscript𝑓𝔸3…f_{\\mathbb{A}}(1),f_{\\mathbb{A}}(2),f_{\\mathbb{A}}(3),\\ldots,\nrespectively. A subset ΛΛ\\Lambda of Amsuperscript𝐴𝑚A^{m} is a generating set for 𝔸msuperscript𝔸𝑚\\mathbb{A}^{m} exactly if, for every (a1,…,am)∈Amsubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑚superscript𝐴𝑚(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{m})\\in A^{m}, there exists a k𝑘k-ary term operation f𝑓f of 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} and (b11,…,bm1),…,subscriptsuperscript𝑏11…subscriptsuperscript𝑏1𝑚…(b^{1}_{1},\\ldots,b^{1}_{m}),\\ldots, (b1k,…,bmk)∈Λsubscriptsuperscript𝑏𝑘1…subscriptsuperscript𝑏𝑘𝑚Λ(b^{k}_{1},\\ldots,b^{k}_{m})\\in\\Lambda so that f​(b11,…,b1k)=a1𝑓subscriptsuperscript𝑏11…subscriptsuperscript𝑏𝑘1subscript𝑎1f(b^{1}_{1},\\ldots,b^{k}_{1})=a_{1}, …, f​(bm1,…,bmk)=am𝑓subscriptsuperscript𝑏1𝑚…subscriptsuperscript𝑏𝑘𝑚subscript𝑎𝑚f(b^{1}_{m},\\ldots,b^{k}_{m})=a_{m}. We may say 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} has the g𝑔g-GP if f𝔸​(m)≤g​(m)subscript𝑓𝔸𝑚𝑔𝑚f_{\\mathbb{A}}(m)\\leq g(m) for all m𝑚m. The question then arises as to the growth rate of\nf𝔸subscript𝑓𝔸f_{\\mathbb{A}} and specifically regarding the behaviours constant, logarithmic,\nlinear, polynomial and exponential. Wiegold proved in\n2 that if 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} is a finite semigroup\nthen f𝔸subscript𝑓𝔸f_{\\mathbb{A}} is either linear or exponential, with the former\nprevailing precisely when 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} is a monoid. This dichotomy\nclassification may be seen as a gap theorem because no growth rates\nintermediate between linear and exponential may occur. We say\n𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} enjoys the polynomially generated powers property\n(PGP) if there exists a polynomial p𝑝p so that f𝔸=O​(p)subscript𝑓𝔸𝑂𝑝f_{\\mathbb{A}}=O(p)\nand the exponentially generated powers property (EGP) if there\nexists a constant b𝑏b so that f𝔸=Ω​(g)subscript𝑓𝔸Ω𝑔f_{\\mathbb{A}}=\\Omega(g) where\ng​(i)=bi𝑔𝑖superscript𝑏𝑖g(i)=b^{i}. In Chen’s , a new link between algebra and\nQCSP was discovered. Chen’s previous work in QCSP tractability largely\ninvolved the special notion of collapsibility\n, but in  this was extended to a computationally effective version of the PGP. For a finite-domain, idempotent algebra 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A}, call simple k𝑘k-collapsibility111We want to use a name different from “collapsibility” alone in order to differentiate this from Chen’s original definition. In 3 we used capitalisation, with a leading capital letter for Chen’s original version and all small letters for what we here designate simple. that special form of the PGP in which the generating set for 𝔸msuperscript𝔸𝑚\\mathbb{A}^{m} is constituted of all tuples (x1,…,xm)subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑚(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{m}) in which at least m−k𝑚𝑘m-k of these elements are equal. Simple k𝑘k-switchability will be another special form of the PGP in which the generating set for 𝔸msuperscript𝔸𝑚\\mathbb{A}^{m} is constituted of all tuples (x1,…,xm)subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑚(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{m}) in which there exists ai<…<ak′subscript𝑎𝑖…subscript𝑎superscript𝑘′a_{i}<\\ldots<a_{k^{\\prime}}, for k′≤ksuperscript𝑘′𝑘k^{\\prime}\\leq k, so that where x1=…=xa1−1subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥subscript𝑎11x_{1}=\\ldots=x_{a_{1}-1}, xa1=…=xa2−1subscript𝑥subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑥subscript𝑎21x_{a_{1}}=\\ldots=x_{a_{2}-1}, …, xak′=…=xamsubscript𝑥subscript𝑎superscript𝑘′…subscript𝑥subscript𝑎𝑚x_{a_{k^{\\prime}}}=\\ldots=x_{a_{m}}. Thus, a1,a2,…,ak′subscript𝑎1subscript𝑎2…subscript𝑎superscript𝑘′a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{k^{\\prime}} are the indices where the tuple switches value. We say that 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} is simply collapsible (switchable) if there exists k𝑘k such that it is simply k𝑘k-collapsible (k𝑘k-switchable). We note that Zhuk uses this form of simple switchability, in , where he proves that the only kind of PGP for finite-domain algebras is simple switchability. Our first contribution shows k𝑘k-collapsibility, whose definition is deferred until adversaries are introduced in Section 0.2, and simple k𝑘k-collapsibility, coincide. The same applies to k𝑘k-switchability and simple k𝑘k-switchability, and we will dwell on these distinctions no longer. For any finite algebra, k𝑘k-collapsibility implies k𝑘k-switchability, and for any 222-element algebra, k𝑘k-switchability implies k𝑘k-collapsibility. Switchability was introduced by Chen in  as a generalisation of the already-known collapsibility  when he discovered a 444-ary operation f𝑓f on the three-element domain so that {f}𝑓\\{f\\} had the PGP (switchability) but was not collapsible. Thus it seemed that collapsibility was not enough to explain membership of QCSP in NP. What we prove as our third contribution is that Inv{f}𝑓\\{f\\} is not finitely related, and what is more, every finite subset of Inv{f}𝑓\\{f\\} is collapsible. Moreover, we prove this for all switchable clones 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} on 333-elements that omit a G-set, what Chen terms Gap Algebras.\nFor QCSP complexity for three-element structures, our result already shows we do not need the additional notion of switchability to explain membership in P, as collapsibility will already suffice. Note that the parameter k𝑘k of collapsibility is unbounded over these increasing finite subsets while the parameter of switchability clearly remains bounded. In the arxiv version of 3 we proved that this is also true when 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} has a G-set. The proof is an exhaustive case analysis and is neither interesting nor sheds light on the general case. It is omitted due to its longevity and the fact that Chen was most interested in the Gap Algebras (cf. the “Classification” Theorem 8.1 in ). If these results were generalisable to higher domains then perhaps collapsibility is enough to explain all membership of finite constraint language QCSP in NP.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: ∧\\land and ==.
