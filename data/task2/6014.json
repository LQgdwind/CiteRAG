      "content": "Paper Title: Combining Vision and Tactile Sensation for Video Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVideo prediction, the task of predicting future video frames, is a core technology challenge in enhancing robotic systems to perform human-like manipulation tasks and it imposes an interesting scientific problem. Early video prediction models focused on predicting raw pixel intensities without modelling the scene dynamics . To perform predictions over longer time horizons, Srivastava et al.  introduced autoencoders and LSTM units to model the temporal coherence. Action-conditioned video prediction models provide further information to the prediction model   for use in reinforcement learning and enabling model predictive control with video prediction systems [ref]8. Villegas et al. 6 split frames into content and motion streams and devolved the problem into predicting the pose and dynamics of landmarks . More recent methods have applied a stochastic assumption to the video prediction problem, stating that there are multiple possible outputs for a single given input, due to a set of latent variables. To reduce uncertainty, which manifests as image blur , and produce sharper prediction image quality, recent models have estimated and sampled from these latent variables. Babaeizadeh et al.  applied this method to the optical flow method proposed in . Denton et al. [ref]7 proposed a similar approach but with a simpler model using only basic layers, which was later built upon by  for larger high-fidelity video prediction. Lee et al. 6 also built upon the method in  by appending adversarial training techniques. The existing video prediction models do not use the tactile sensation and assume the changes caused by PRI are fully observed in visual information and/or the models provide a prediction with high uncertainty. Opera et al.  considered three categories for video prediction model benchmarks (i) human prediction tests (e.g. 3  ), (ii) driving and road tests, where the objective is to predict how the state of a road might change (e.g.  0 2) and (iii) robot pushing datasets, (e.g.  [ref]8 ) where the objective is to predict the environment change from a robot’s actions during physical robot interaction. Unlike the other video prediction benchmark tests, robot-pushing datasets contain physical interaction. The tactile sensation can provide features important to video prediction models that are not available from visual sensation. Current state-of-the-art methods apply a stochastic assumption to video prediction, assuming that variables such as the centre of mass, object friction, and object dynamics are unknowable. Tactile sensation during physical interaction may give access to many of these latent variables which is the concept behind integrating tactile sensation into video prediction models. In this article, we build new datasets as the available pushing datasets lack tactile sensation. Tactile sensors are hardware devices that obtain tactile information through physical interaction with the environment. Tactile information typically attributes such as temperature, vibration, softness, texture, shape, composition and normal & shear forces 3. In the context of object pushing, we require normal and shear force features. Tactile sensors available from both industry and literature that can generate these features typically make trade-offs between resolution, affordability and sensitivity. Image-based tactile sensors222Such technology includes a camera capturing the deformation of a membrane., such as the Optical wave-guide-based sensors  4 and marker-based sensors such as the TacTip 8, are high-resolution tactile sensors. However, they require significant processing 0. Magnetic-based  sensors, like the Xela Uskin 333The uSkin sensor by xelarobotics.com, provide low spatial resolution and high-frequency data at each Taxel with tri-axial readings. The Xela Uskin sensor has magnetic-based cells each measuring non-calibrated normal and shear forces. In this work, we use the Xela uSkin magnetic sensor as it’s (1) simple and easy to use, (2) low cost, and (3) it generates high-frequency readings. This sensor is used for tactile predictive models 0 and for data-driven model predictive control for slip-free robotic manipulation 1. The combination of touch and vision is in its infancy. The relationship between vision and touch during PRI has been explored with translation tasks. For instance, 7 and  used adversarial networks to translate between material surfaces and touch with a vision-based touch sensor and a pen accelerometer, respectively. Li et al. 9 used ResNet Encoders and adversarial training to (i) synthesise plausible temporal tactile signals from visual inputs of touch with a static scene and (ii) translate from tactile signals to a single image output of the scene. Lee et al. 8 combined vision, haptic (wrist force/torque sensor) and proprioceptive data to encode a multi-modal representation using a set of surrogate tasks. Encoded data is then used to generate a policy for reinforcement learning (a peg-in-hole task). This work showed that the multi-modal representation outperforms single-modality models. Pinto et al. 6 show how physical interactions enable agents to better classify and categorise objects through pushing, poking and grasping. However, a model that captures the correlation between touch and visual sensing to predict visual and/or tactile sensing during PRI has not been explored in the literature. We present the combined tactile and video prediction models in this paper for effective PRI task completion (Fig. 2).\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Action-conditioned video prediction models provide further information to the prediction model   for use in reinforcement learning and enabling model predictive control with video prediction systems [ref]8.
