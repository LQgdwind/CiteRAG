      "content": "Paper Title: Hardness of linearly ordered 4-colouring of 3-colourable 3-uniform hypergraphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe first part builds on the topological method introduced by Krokhin, Opršal, Wrochna, and Živný [ref]21 [ref]31 . The core idea is that, similarly to approximate graph colouring, there are unreasonably many polymorphisms between the linear-ordering hypergraphs, but most of them are very similar. This means that each polymorphism contains a lot of noise but relatively little information. We use topology to remove this noise, and uncover a signal. This is done by considering the polymorphisms ‘up to homotopy’ — essentially claiming that the homotopy class of a polymorphism carries the information and everything else is noise. In order to formalise this idea, we consider for each hypergraph 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} the topological space Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐀)Homsubscript𝐑3𝐀\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{A}). Consequently, we get that each the homomorphism f:𝐀→𝐁:𝑓→𝐀𝐁f\\colon\\mathbf{A}\\to\\mathbf{B} induces a continuous map f∗:Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐀)→Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐁):subscript𝑓→Homsubscript𝐑3𝐀Homsubscript𝐑3𝐁f_{*}\\colon\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{A})\\to\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{B}). Consequently, we identify two homomorphisms f,g𝑓𝑔f,g if f∗subscript𝑓f_{*} and g∗subscript𝑔g_{*} are homotopic to each other. The same is then extended to polymorphisms, although this requires to overcome a few subtle technical issues. The key observation for this extension is that the power of a homomorphism complex is homotopically equivalent to a homomorphism complex of the corresponding power (see, e.g., ). This general idea requires a refinement to avoid trivial collapses, i.e., we have to avoid the case when f∗subscript𝑓f_{*} is homotopic to a constant map which is always a continuous map between topological spaces. In our case, this is avoided by keeping track of the action of ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3} on the spaces Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐀)Homsubscript𝐑3𝐀\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{A}) and Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐁)Homsubscript𝐑3𝐁\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{B}) described in the preliminaries. Consequently, we consider maps only up to ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3}-equivariant homotopy (note that the map f∗subscript𝑓f_{*} induced by a homomorphism is always equivariant). Further in this exposition, we will silently assume that the action is always present, and all notions are equivariant — the formal proof below is presented with the action in mind. At this point we sketched how to construct a map that assigns to a polymorphism f:𝐀n→𝐁:𝑓→superscript𝐀𝑛𝐁f\\colon\\mathbf{A}^{n}\\to\\mathbf{B}, an equivariant continuous map f∗:Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐀n)→Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐁):subscript𝑓→Homsubscript𝐑3superscript𝐀𝑛Homsubscript𝐑3𝐁f_{*}\\colon\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{A}^{n})\\to\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{B}). This map does not necessarily preserve minors, nevertheless, it preserves minors up to homotopy, i.e., for each π:[n]→[m]:𝜋→delimited-[]𝑛delimited-[]𝑚\\pi\\colon[n]\\to[m], we have that (fπ)∗subscriptsuperscript𝑓𝜋(f^{\\pi})_{*} and (f∗)πsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝜋(f_{*})^{\\pi} are equivariantly homotopic (this is since Hom(𝐑3,𝐀)n\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{A})^{n} and Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐀n)Homsubscript𝐑3superscript𝐀𝑛\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{A}^{n}) are only homotopically equivalent and not homeomorphic). This allows us to define a minion homomorphism between the polymorphism minion pol⁡(𝐀,𝐁)pol𝐀𝐁\\operatorname{pol}(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B}) and the minion of ‘homotopy classes of continuous maps’ from powers of Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐀)Homsubscript𝐑3𝐀\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{A}) to Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐁)Homsubscript𝐑3𝐁\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{B}). Let X𝑋X and Y𝑌Y be two topological spaces with an action of G𝐺G. The minion of homotopy classes of equivariant polymorphisms from X𝑋X to Y𝑌Y is the minion hpol⁡(X,Y)hpol𝑋𝑌\\operatorname{hpol}(X,Y) defined by and [f]π=[fπ]superscriptdelimited-[]𝑓𝜋delimited-[]superscript𝑓𝜋[f]^{\\pi}=[f^{\\pi}]. Note that minors are well-defined in this minion since if f𝑓f and g𝑔g are equivariantly homotopic, then so are fπsuperscript𝑓𝜋f^{\\pi} and gπsuperscript𝑔𝜋g^{\\pi} for all maps π𝜋\\pi.\nHence, we have a minion homomorphism This part of the proof follows , namely this minion homomorphism can be constructed by following the proof of [23, Lemma 3.22] while substituting 𝐑3subscript𝐑3{\\mathbf{R}_{3}} for 𝐊2subscript𝐊2\\mathbf{K}_{2}, and ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3} for ℤ2subscriptℤ2\\mathbb{Z}_{2}. We give a general categorical proof in Appendix C. In order to describe the minion hpol⁡(Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐀),Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐁))hpolHomsubscript𝐑3𝐀Homsubscript𝐑3𝐁\\operatorname{hpol}(\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{A}),\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{B})), we need to classify all homotopy classes of maps between the corresponding topological spaces. The problem of classifying maps between two spaces up to homotopy is well-studied in algebraic topology, although it can be immensely difficult, e.g., maps between spheres of dimensions m𝑚m and n𝑛n (i.e., [Sn,Sm]superscript𝑆𝑛superscript𝑆𝑚[S^{n},S^{m}]) has been classified for many pairs m,n𝑚𝑛m,n, but the classification for infinitely many remaining cases is still open, and it is considered to be a central open problem in algebraic topology.\nWe take advantage of the topological methods developed to solve these problems. Moreover, we may simplify the matters considerably by replacing the spaces Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐋𝐎3)Homsubscript𝐑3subscript𝐋𝐎3\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{LO}_{3}) and Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐋𝐎4)Homsubscript𝐑3subscript𝐋𝐎4\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{LO}_{4}) with spaces that allow equivariant maps to and from, resp., these spaces, and are better behaved from the topological perspective. This is due to the fact that if there are equivariant maps X′→X→superscript𝑋′𝑋X^{\\prime}\\to X and Y→Y′→𝑌superscript𝑌′Y\\to Y^{\\prime}, then there is a minion homomorphism This minion homomorphism is defined in the same way as a minion homomorphism from pol⁡(𝐀,𝐁)pol𝐀𝐁\\operatorname{pol}(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B}) to pol⁡(𝐀′,𝐁′)polsuperscript𝐀′superscript𝐁′\\operatorname{pol}(\\mathbf{A}^{\\prime},\\mathbf{B}^{\\prime}) if 𝐀′,𝐁′superscript𝐀′superscript𝐁′\\mathbf{A}^{\\prime},\\mathbf{B}^{\\prime} is a homomorphic relaxation of 𝐀,𝐁𝐀𝐁\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B}, i.e., if 𝐀′→𝐀→superscript𝐀′𝐀\\mathbf{A}^{\\prime}\\to\\mathbf{A} and 𝐁→𝐁′→𝐁superscript𝐁′\\mathbf{B}\\to\\mathbf{B}^{\\prime} [3, Lemma 4.8(1)].\nTo substantiate our choice of X′superscript𝑋′X^{\\prime} and Y′superscript𝑌′Y^{\\prime}, let us start with describing some topological properties of the spaces Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐋𝐎3)Homsubscript𝐑3subscript𝐋𝐎3\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{LO}_{3}) and Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐋𝐎4)Homsubscript𝐑3subscript𝐋𝐎4\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{LO}_{4}). It may be observed that the space Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐋𝐎3)Homsubscript𝐑3subscript𝐋𝐎3\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{LO}_{3}) is homotopically equivalent to the simplicial complex depicted in Fig. 1(a) where the ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3} acts on each row cyclically. We choose X′superscript𝑋′X^{\\prime} so that X′→Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐋𝐎3)→superscript𝑋′Homsubscript𝐑3subscript𝐋𝐎3X^{\\prime}\\to\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{LO}_{3}), and its powers are topologically simple but non-trivial. A natural choice is S1superscript𝑆1S^{1} which can be obtained from the simplicial complex by removing all horizontal edges. The action of ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3} on the circle can be then equivalently described as a rotation by 2​π/32𝜋32\\pi/3. Consequently, the powers of this space are n𝑛n-dimensional tori Tnsuperscript𝑇𝑛T^{n} with component-wise (diagonal) action of ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3}; by definition Tnsuperscript𝑇𝑛T^{n} is the n𝑛n-th power of S1superscript𝑆1S^{1}. The space Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐋𝐎4)Homsubscript𝐑3subscript𝐋𝐎4\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{LO}_{4}) is a bit more complicated, in particular it is not homotopically equivalent to a 1-dimensional space.\nUp to equivalence, it is the order complex of the partial order depicted in Fig. 1(c) where ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3} acts on rows cyclically.111111In the proof we will not need such a precise description of the space, and we will only provide an equivariant map Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐋𝐎4)→L4→Homsubscript𝐑3subscript𝐋𝐎4subscript𝐿4\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{LO}_{4})\\to L_{4} where L4subscript𝐿4L_{4} is the space represented by the poset in Fig. 1(c).\nIt may be observed that Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐋𝐎4)Homsubscript𝐑3subscript𝐋𝐎4\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{LO}_{4}) is simply connected, i.e., that π1​(Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐋𝐎4))=0subscript𝜋1Homsubscript𝐑3subscript𝐋𝐎40\\pi_{1}(\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{LO}_{4}))=0, and that π2​(Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐋𝐎4))subscript𝜋2Homsubscript𝐑3subscript𝐋𝐎4\\pi_{2}(\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{LO}_{4})) is a non-trivial group. Moreover, the action of ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3} on Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐋𝐎4)Homsubscript𝐑3subscript𝐋𝐎4\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{LO}_{4}) induces a non-trivial action of ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3} on π2​(Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐋𝐎4))subscript𝜋2Homsubscript𝐑3subscript𝐋𝐎4\\pi_{2}(\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{LO}_{4})). The precise group and action is described in Appendix A, nevertheless it is irrelevant for us at this point.\nThe space that we use to replace Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐋𝐎4)Homsubscript𝐑3subscript𝐋𝐎4\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{LO}_{4}), and denote by P2superscript𝑃2P^{2}, shares these two properties with Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐋𝐎4)Homsubscript𝐑3subscript𝐋𝐎4\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{LO}_{4}), and moreover πn​(P2)=0subscript𝜋𝑛superscript𝑃20\\pi_{n}(P^{2})=0 for all n>2𝑛2n>2. Spaces which have only one non-trivial homotopy group (and are sufficiently ‘nice’) are called Eilenberg-MacLane spaces, and denoted by K​(G,n)𝐾𝐺𝑛K(G,n) where πn​(K​(G,n))=Gsubscript𝜋𝑛𝐾𝐺𝑛𝐺\\pi_{n}(K(G,n))=G is the only non-trivial homotopy group. These spaces are well-defined up to homotopy equivalence. They are also closely connected with cohomology: One of the core statements of obstruction theory provides a bijection [X,K​(G,n)]≃Hn​(X;G)similar-to-or-equals𝑋𝐾𝐺𝑛superscript𝐻𝑛𝑋𝐺[X,K(G,n)]\\simeq H^{n}(X;G) for each Abelian group G𝐺G and n≥1𝑛1n\\geq 1. Consequently, it is much easier to classify maps into an Eilenberg-MacLane space up to homotopy.\nThe space P2superscript𝑃2P^{2} is in fact an Eilenberg-MacLane space K​(G,2)𝐾𝐺2K(G,2) where G𝐺G is a suitable group with a free action of ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3}, it is chosen in such a way that it allows an equivariant homomorphism Hom⁡(𝐑3,𝐋𝐎4)→P2→Homsubscript𝐑3subscript𝐋𝐎4superscript𝑃2\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathbf{R}_{3}},\\mathbf{LO}_{4})\\to P^{2} while allowing for much easier classification of maps into it. Next, we prove that the minion hpol⁡(S1,P2)hpolsuperscript𝑆1superscript𝑃2\\operatorname{hpol}(S^{1},P^{2}) is isomorphic to the minion 𝒵3subscript𝒵3\\mathscr{Z}_{3} of affine maps modulo 333, i.e., maps ℤ3n→ℤ3→superscriptsubscriptℤ3𝑛subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{Z}_{3} of the form (x1,…,xn)↦∑i=1nαi​ximaps-tosubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝛼𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖(x_{1},\\dots,x_{n})\\mapsto\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\alpha_{i}x_{i} where α1,…,αn∈ℤ3subscript𝛼1…subscript𝛼𝑛subscriptℤ3\\alpha_{1},\\dots,\\alpha_{n}\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{3} are fixed constants such that ∑i=1nαi=1(mod3)superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝛼𝑖annotated1pmod3\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\alpha_{i}=1\\pmod{3}.\nWe construct this minion homomorphism by classifying equivariant continuous maps from Tnsuperscript𝑇𝑛T^{n} with the diagonal action of ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3} to P2superscript𝑃2P^{2}. Since we are interested in equivariant maps and equivariant homotopy, we use a version of equivariant cohomology, called Bredon cohomology, introduced in [ref]7. For our purpose, this equivariant cohomology is defined analogously to regular cohomology except the coefficients have a ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3}-action, and this action together with the action of ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3} on the space is taken into account in all computations.\nThe space P2superscript𝑃2P^{2} has the property that for every ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3}-space X𝑋X such that there is an equivariant map X→P2→𝑋superscript𝑃2X\\to P^{2}, there is a bijection [X,P2]ℤ3≃Hℤ32​(X;G)similar-to-or-equalssubscript𝑋superscript𝑃2subscriptℤ3subscriptsuperscript𝐻2subscriptℤ3𝑋𝐺[X,P^{2}]_{\\mathbb{Z}_{3}}\\simeq H^{2}_{\\mathbb{Z}_{3}}(X;G) where G𝐺G is the group with a ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3} action described above. Again, this is a consequence of the equivariant obstruction theory. We then compute that and hence observe that there are 3n−1superscript3𝑛13^{n-1} elements in hpol(n)⁡(S1,P2)superscripthpol𝑛superscript𝑆1superscript𝑃2\\operatorname{hpol}^{(n)}(S^{1},P^{2}). This means that hpol⁡(S1,P2)hpolsuperscript𝑆1superscript𝑃2\\operatorname{hpol}(S^{1},P^{2}) and 𝒵3subscript𝒵3\\mathscr{Z}_{3} have the same number of elements of each arity.\nTo obtain the required minion isomorphism, we provide a minion homomorphism and show that it is injective. More precisely, this homomorphism is given by assigning to each affine map f:ℤ3n→ℤ3:𝑓→superscriptsubscriptℤ3𝑛subscriptℤ3f\\colon\\mathbb{Z}_{3}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{Z}_{3} (or a tuple of its coefficients), a continuous map μ​(f):Tn→P2:𝜇𝑓→superscript𝑇𝑛superscript𝑃2\\mu(f)\\colon T^{n}\\to P^{2}, and showing that if f≠g𝑓𝑔f\\neq g then μ​(f)𝜇𝑓\\mu(f) and μ​(g)𝜇𝑔\\mu(g) are not equivariantly homotopic, and that μ​(fπ)𝜇superscript𝑓𝜋\\mu(f^{\\pi}) and μ​(f)π𝜇superscript𝑓𝜋\\mu(f)^{\\pi} are equivariantly homotopic for all π𝜋\\pi. Since both minions have the same number of elements of each arity (and this number is finite), μ𝜇\\mu is bijective, and hence a minion isomorphism. All these computations are presented in detail in Appendix B. The above isomorphism together with the composition of ζ𝜁\\zeta, η𝜂\\eta, and ξ𝜉\\xi provides the following lemma. There is a minion homomorphism χ:pol⁡(𝐋𝐎3,𝐋𝐎4)→𝒵3:𝜒→polsubscript𝐋𝐎3subscript𝐋𝐎4subscript𝒵3\\chi\\colon\\operatorname{pol}(\\mathbf{LO}_{3},\\mathbf{LO}_{4})\\to\\mathscr{Z}_{3} where 𝒵3subscript𝒵3\\mathscr{Z}_{3} denotes the minion of affine maps over ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3}. This minion homomorphism is not enough to prove NP-hardness. Although we could conclude from it, for example, that PCSP⁡(𝐋𝐎3,𝐋𝐎4)PCSPsubscript𝐋𝐎3subscript𝐋𝐎4\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{LO}_{3},\\mathbf{LO}_{4}) is not solved by any level of Sherali-Adams hierarchy (this is a direct consequence of [11, Theorems 3.3 and 5.2]). To provide hardness, we need to further analyse the image of χ𝜒\\chi which is done using combinatorial arguments.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: The first part builds on the topological method introduced by Krokhin, Opršal, Wrochna, and Živný [ref]21 [ref]31 .
