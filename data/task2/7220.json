      "content": "Paper Title: Dimensionality-Aware Outlier Detection: Theoretical and Experimental Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNon-parametric approaches for outlier detection¬† either explicitly or implicitly aim to assess the density in the vicinity of a query point, such that points with the lowest densities are reported as the strongest outlier candidates.\nThe assessment of density can be direct, or based on distances, or on the ratio of one density with respect to another.\nThe distance-based DB-outlier method¬† estimates density in the vicinity of a query by counting the number of data points contained in a neighborhood with predefined radius.\nConversely, the kùëòk-nearest-neighbor algorithm\n(k‚ÄãNNùëòNN\\operatorname{\\mathit{k}\\textrm{NN}})¬†\nmeasures the radius needed so as to capture a fixed number of points, kùëòk.\nLocal outlier detection methods based on density ratios, such as LOF¬†, identify outliers to be those points having local densities that are small relative to those of their nearest neighbors. Many variations of the aforementioned outlier models have been proposed over the past decades. Some rely on nonstandard notions of neighborhood, such as COF (connectivity-based outlier factor)¬†[ref]52, INFLO (Influenced Outlierness)¬†, and others based on reverse nearest neighbors¬†.\nOthers estimate the local density in different ways, such as LDF (Local Density Factor)¬†,\nLOCI (Local Outlier Integral)¬†,\nand\nKDEOS (Kernel Density Estimation Outlier\nScore)¬†.\nYet other variations derive an outlier score from a comparison of a local model for the query point to local models of other data points; these include the local distance-based outlier detection (LDOF) approach¬†,\nprobabilistic modeling of local outlier scores (LoOP)¬†, or meta-modeling of outlierness¬†.\nA somewhat different approach is angle-based outlier detection (ABOD)¬†, which bases the degree of outlierness of a query point on the variance of the angles formed by it and other pairs of points. Despite the many variants of the fundamental techniques of non-parametric outlier detection that have appeared over the past quarter century, two classic methods in particular, LOFLOF\\operatorname{\\textrm{LOF}} and k‚ÄãNNùëòNN\\operatorname{\\mathit{k}\\textrm{NN}}, have repeatedly been confirmed as top performers or recommended baselines in larger comparative studies involving local anomaly detection¬† [ref]21 . None of these methods, however, take into account the possibility of variation in local intrinsic dimensionality within the dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: Many variations of the aforementioned outlier models have been proposed over the past decades.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
