      "content": "Paper Title: Teasel: A Transformer-Based Speech-Prefixed Language Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider a variety of SoTA unimodal and multimodal Transformers and fusion methods.\nExperimental comparisons are reported in three sections: First, we compare Teasel against unimodal (text only) large textual Transformers, RoBERTa\n is a robustly pre-trained version of BERT Transformer.  have published a base and large version of RoBERTa, using 12 and 24 layers, respectively. We used the base and large version of RoBERTa as a text-only baseline. Second, we compare Teasel against popular multimodal fusion methods which use a Transformer as a feature extractor. These methods are as follows. Tensor Fusion Network (TFN)\nutilizes tensor outer-product to combine three modalities in unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal fashion. Furthermore, it concatenates all six flattened vectors as a multimodal representation [ref]23 . Low-rank Multimodal Fusion (LFM) optimizes the TFN time complexity from exponential to linear using modality-specific low-rank factors [ref]24. Memory Fusion Network (MFM) trains modality-specific generative factorized representations and joint multimodal features across all modalities for multimodal tasks [ref]41. Modality-Invariant and -Specific Representations for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MISA) factorizes modalities into modality-invariant and modality-specific features and then fuses them to predict a label . Interaction Canonical Correlation Network (ICCN) applies Deep CCA to dissolve hidden relationships between BERT sentence embeddings, audio sequence, and facial features . Finally, we compare Teasel performance against multimodal fusion Transformer-based methods. Multimodal Adaptation Gate-Transformer (MAG-Transformer)\nis a module to generate a shift to the internal representation of Transformer models using visual and acoustic modalities. Combining the MAG module with a pre-trained Transformer would let them integrate speech and visual modalities to the middle level of the pre-trained lexicon Transformer . Multimodal Transformer (MulT) performs directional cross-modal attention mechanism followed by self-attention for every two modalities to combine the heterogeneous multimodal signals using supervised settings . Self-Supervised Multi-task Multimodal (Self-MM) employs multi-task learning and self-supervised learning to generate unimodal labels. Later, training the multimodal and unimodal representations to learn both variations and agreements among the modalities . Shallow-Fusion method jointly fine-tunes roberta-large and vq-wav2vec models on downstream tasks using a late fusion method  .\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: (TFN)\nutilizes tensor outer-product to combine three modalities in unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal fashion.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
