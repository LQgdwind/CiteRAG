One typical track of user behavior¬†[ref]4 in industry can be expressed as exposure ‚Üí‚Üí\\to click ‚Üí‚Üí\\to conversion in Fig.¬†2. In this context, CTR represents the transition chance from exposure space to click space; CVR represents that from click space to conversion space; and CTCVR represents that from exposure space to conversion space.\nThe growth of large-scale database and feature interaction approaches has made CTR estimation a well-established practice and revenue source in the industry¬†  .\nHowever, click-through feedback frequently misrepresents the actual user preferences since it is easily tainted by many factors in practice, e.g., clickbait¬† .\nIn contrast, post-click feedback, i.e., CVR, faithfully reflects user preferences and directly influences gross merchandise volume, attracting special attention in recommendation committee. A na√Øve but widely selected approach¬† to constructing CVR estimators is training the estimator over the click space ùí™ùí™\\mathcal{O}, in which conversion labels are completely observable. However, there are two key problems with this strategy.\nThe first issue is sample selection bias i.e., the training space only consists of user-item intersections where click takes place, whereas the inference space is the entire exposure space ùíüùíü\\mathcal{D}.\nSince the intersections with lower CVR are more likely to be excluded from the training space ùí™ùí™\\mathcal{O}  [ref]14, training data is missing not at random¬†, which leads to a bias between the training space and inference space.\nThe second issue is the sparsity of clicked samples¬†[ref]4 [ref]14.\nWith a CTR of 4% for the Ali-CPP benchmark and 3.8% for our industrial benchmark, the amount of training data is extremely insufficient to develop a generalizable CVR estimator.\nIn summary, both of these issues significantly hinder the generalization and online performance of the na√Øve approach beyond the click space. The entire space multitask model (ESMM)¬†[ref]4 is an intuitive approach to mitigate both issues by avoiding direct training of CVR estimators.\nThe key insight is to break down the CVR estimation task into CTR and CTCVR estimation that can be trained over the exposure space. It effectively mitigates data sparsity, and yields substantial gains in industry¬† .\nHowever, the unbiasedness of its CVR estimation remains not ensured, which raises serious concerns.\nIn this study, we mainly investigate two limitations of ESMM as follows: Intrinsic Estimation Bias (IEB), where the CVR estimates are intrinsically biased against the actual values. False Independence Prior (FIP), where the CTR and CVR estimates are susceptible to conditional independence, which is undesirable since the causal dependency from click to conversion is falsely overlooked. Inspired by causality paradigm, a model-agnostic approach named Entire Space Counterfactual Multitask Model (ESCM2) is proposed, which incorporates a counterfactual risk minimizer to regularize the CVR estimator in the ESMM framework.\nAs discussed in Section¬†IV, the analytical properties of the proposed regularizer successfully handle both IEB and FIP defects.\nThe contributions of this study are threefold: We demonstrate that ESMM‚Äôs CVR estimates suffer from the intrinsic estimation bias, providing experimental results and mathematical analysis to support this claim111Although some numerical evidence¬†[ref]14 suggests that the CVR estimator based on ESMM is biased, a formal definition and theoretical analysis of this bias is still missing. To this end, we provide a formal definition of the intrinsic estimation bias, and prove its existence in Proposition¬†1.. We demonstrate that ESMM introduces false independence prior to its CTCVR estimates, with well crafted experiments to support this claim. We develop ESCM2, which is the first effort to suggest a causal improvement to ESMM. With ESCM2, the IEB and FIP issues in ESMM are effectively handled. We back up our assertions with a plethora of real-world experiments and mathematical analysis. This paper is an extension of our work¬† presented in SIGIR‚Äô22.\nBased on this prior work we have made extensions in several aspects.\nFirst, we have presented relevant theorems and proofs to demonstrate that the proposed doubly robust estimator handles IEB and FIP concerns.\nThen, the proposed regularizers‚Äô statistical properties (i.e., bias and variance) have been investigated for rigor.\nMoreover, we have demonstrated that ESCM2 is a particular Monte Carlo‚Äôs approach, which could motivate a large number of theoretical extensions.\nFinally, we have added details of model structure, online A/B test and emerging related works. The remaining sections are structured as follows:\nSection¬†II provides some preliminaries to better understand the proposed method.\nSection¬†III investigates the IEB and FIP issues with ESMM.\nWe introduce the proposed counterfactual regularizers in Section¬†IV-A, analyze their theoretical effectiveness to handle the IEB and FIP issues in Section¬†IV-B, and summarize the implementation of ESCM2 in Section¬†IV-C.\nTo demonstrate the superiority of ESCM2, real-word case studies are conducted in Section¬†V.\nSection¬†VI is an overview of related works; Section¬†VII discusses conclusions and open questions.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Recommendation system seeks to deliver valuable items to users to meet their interest [ref]1  , driving user growth in e-commerce¬†[ref]4, advertising , and social media .\nFig.¬†1 depicts a typical content-based recommendation pipeline in industry, which consists of the offline and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
