We randomly generate graphs by Barab√°si‚ÄìAlbert method . For an online node vùë£v, we sample its degree (the number of offline nodes connected to it) by a Binomial distribution ‚Ñ¨‚Äã(U,dv/U)‚Ñ¨ùëàsubscriptùëëùë£ùëà\\mathcal{B}(U,d_{v}/U) where dvsubscriptùëëùë£d_{v} is the average degree of node vùë£v. The average degrees of online nodes are chosen from 4, 2, and 0.5. Each server has a capacity on the number of the computing units. The capacity Bu‚Ä≤superscriptsubscriptùêµùë¢‚Ä≤B_{u}^{\\prime} is sampled from a uniform distribution on the range   . The computing load of a VM request is sampled from a uniform distribution on the range   . The utility per computing unit rusubscriptùëüùë¢r_{u} is the price of a computing unit on the server uùë¢u. We choose the price (in dollars) in the range [0.08,0.12]0.080.12[0.08,0.12] according to the prices of the compute-optimized instances on Amazon EC2 [ref]2. We randomly generate 20k, 1k, and 1k samples of BA graphs for training, validation and testing, respectively. We compare our algorithms with baselines for OBM listed below.\nWe compare our algorithms with the most common baselines for OBM as listed below. OPT: The offline optimal solution\nis obtained using Gurobi 1\nfor each graph instance. Greedy: The greedy algorithm  matches an online node\nto the available offline node that is connected to the node and has the highest bid value. Greedy has a strong empirical performance and\nis a special case of MetaAd with Œ∏‚Üí‚àû‚ÜíùúÉ\\theta\\to\\infty. PrimalDual: PrimalDual  calculates the scores of each bidder for each online node based on both the bid values and the remaining budgets, and then selects for an online node the available bidder with the highest score. It is a special case of MetaAd with Œ∏‚Üí1‚ÜíùúÉ1\\theta\\rightarrow 1. ML: A policy-gradient algorithm that solves the OBM problem . The inputs to the policy model are the available history information including the current bid value, the remaining budget of each offline node and the average matched bid value. For learning-based algorithms, we use the neural networks which have two layers, each with 200 hidden neurons for fair comparison. The neural networks are trained by Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10‚àí3superscript10310^{-3} for 50 epochs.\nLikewise, we use LOBM-ŒªùúÜ\\lambda to refer to LOBM with a hyper-parameter ŒªùúÜ\\lambda governing the competitiveness requirement in (28).\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: the price of a computing unit on the server uùë¢u.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
