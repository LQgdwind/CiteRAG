      "content": "Paper Title: Fast Graph Generation via Spectral Diffusion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLearning to generate graph-structural data not only requires knowing the nodes’ feature distribution, but also a deep understanding of the underlying graph topology, which is essential to modelling various graph instances, such as social networks [ref]1 , molecule structures  , neural architectures , recommender systems , etc. Conventional likelihood-based graph generative models, e.g. GraphGAN , GraphVAE  and GraphRNN , have demonstrated great strength on graph generation tasks. In general, a likelihood-based model is designed to learn the likelihood function of the underlying graph data distribution, with which one can draw new samples with preserved graph properties from the distribution of interest. However, most likelihood-based generative models suffer from either limited quality of modeling graph structures, or considerable computational burden [ref]10. Recently, a series of diffusion-based generative models have been proposed to overcome the limitations of likelihood-based models. Although being originally established for image generation [ref]11, diffusion models exhibit a great success in graph generation tasks with complex graph structural properties  [ref]10. Roughly speaking, diffusion refers to a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that smoothly converts authentic data into pure noise via noise insertion. A diffusion model is able to reverse the data back from the noise, as long as the corresponding reversed-time SDE is known, which depends on the time-dependent gradient field of the density function (i.e. score function). To achieve this, a neural network is trained to learn the score function, and hence a reversed-time process can be constructed with the estimated score. The first graph diffusion model through SDEs, coined Graph Diffusion via SDE Systems (GDSS) [ref]10, is designed to simultaneously generate node features and adjacency matrix via reversed diffusion. Similar to image diffusion models [ref]11 , at each diffusion step, GDSS directly inserts standard Gaussian noise to both node features and the adjacency matrix. Meanwhile, two separate neural networks are trained to learn the score functions of the node features and adjacency matrix, respectively. However, unlike the densely distributed image data, graph adjacency matrices can be highly sparse, which makes isotropic Gaussian noise insertion incompatible with graph structural data. In these circumstances, as shown in Figure 1, there is a stark difference between the diffusion process on images and on graph adjacency matrices. As can bee seen from the figure, the image corrupted by full-rank Gaussian noise exhibits recognizable numerical patterns along the early- and middle-stage of forward diffusion. However, the corrupted sparse graph adjacency matrix degenerates into a dense matrix with uniformly distributed entries in a few diffusion steps. In intuition, Figure 1 implies that standard diffusion SDEs with full-rank isotropic noise insertion is destructive of learning graph topology and feature representations. Theoretically speaking, for extremely sparse graphs (e.g. molecules) with low-rank adjacency matrices, the adjacency score functions are supported on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the full adjacency matrix space. Thus, directly applying diffusion models on graph topology generation is not desirable: once the diffusion SDE is run in the full space of the adjacency matrix, lethal noise will be injected into the out-of-support regions and drives the signal-to-noise ratio to be essentially zero, which is fatal for training score networks. Even for densely connected graphs, the standard diffusion model is problematic for topology generation. Unlike image pixels that are merely locally correlated, an adjacency matrix governs the message-passing pattern of the whole graph. Thus, isotropic Gaussian noise insertion severely distorts the message-passing pattern, by blindly encouraging message passing on sparsely connected parts, which impedes the representation learning of sparse regions. In order to establish a graph-friendly diffusion model, one should design an appropriate diffusion scheme that is compatible with the graph topology structure.\nTo this end, we propose the Graph Spectral Diffusion Model (GSDM), which is driven by diffusion SDEs on both the node feature space and the graph spectrum space. At each diffusion step, instead of corrupting the entire adjacency matrix, our method confines the Gaussian insertion to the graph spectrum space, i.e. the eigenvalue matrix of the adjacency matrix. This novel diffusion scheme enables us to perform smooth transformations on graph data during both the training and sampling phases. As illustrated in Figure 2, our proposed GSDM significantly outperforms the standard graph diffusion model (GDSS [ref]10) in terms of graph generation quality and plausibility. For the Grid dataset shown in the top row of the figure, GDSS samples seem to be merely chaotic clusters, while GSDM samples exhibit smooth surface-like patterns that are visually similar to real data. For the Community-small dataset shown in the bottom row of the figure, GDSS fails to capture the link between two communities on some samples, while GSDM is able to capture dumbbell-like pattern (two clusters connected by one edge) as well as butterfly-like pattern (two clusters connected by two edges). This implies that GDSS’s generation not only fails to mimic the observed topology distribution, but also suffers from capturing challenging details of the data such as links between communities. In contrast, GSDM is capable of generating high-quality graphs that are topologically similar to the real data, while retaining critical details. We empirically evaluate the capability of our proposed GSDM on generic graph generation tasks, by evaluating the generation quality on both synthetic and real-world graph datasets. As shown in Section 4, GSDM outperforms existing one-shot generative models on various datasets, while achieving competitive performance to autoregressive models. Further molecule generation experiments show that our GSDM outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that our proposed spectral diffusion model is capable of capturing complicated dependency between nodes and edges. Our main contributions are 3 folds: We propose a novel Graph Spectral Diffusion Model (GSDM) for fast and quality graph generation. Our method overcomes the limitations of existing graph diffusion models by leveraging diffusion SDEs on both the node feature and graph spectrum spaces. Through the lens of stochastic analysis, we prove that GSDM enjoys a substantially stronger performance guarantee than the standard graph diffusion model. Our proposed spectral diffusion sharpens the reconstruction error bound from 𝒪​(n2​exp⁡(n2))𝒪superscript𝑛2superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}\\exp(n^{2})) to 𝒪​(n​exp⁡(n))𝒪𝑛𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n\\exp(n)), where n𝑛n is the number of nodes. We evaluate GSDM on both synthetic and real-world graph generation tasks, on which GSDM outperforms all existing graph generative models. Moreover, GSDM also achieves evidently higher computational efficiency compared to existing graph diffusion models.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: requires knowing the nodes’ feature distribution, but also a deep understanding of the underlying graph topology, which is essential to modelling various graph instances, such as social networks [ref]1 , molecule structures  , neural architectures , recommender systems , etc. Conventional likelihood-based graph generative models, e.g. GraphGAN , GraphVAE  and GraphRNN , have demonstrated\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
