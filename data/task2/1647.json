      "content": "Paper Title: AniGAN: Style-Guided Generative Adversarial Networks for Unsupervised Anime Face Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe generator of AniGAN consists of a content encoder Ecsubscript𝐸𝑐E_{c}, a style encoder Essubscript𝐸𝑠E_{s} and a decoder F𝐹F, as shown in Fig. 2. Encoder.\nThe encoder includes a content encoder Ecsubscript𝐸𝑐E_{c} and a style encoder Essubscript𝐸𝑠E_{s}. Given a source photo-face 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} and a reference anime-face 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y}, the content encoder Ecsubscript𝐸𝑐E_{c} is used to encode the content of the source image 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}, and the style encoder is employed to extract the style information from the reference 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y}.\nThe functions can be formulated as follows: where α𝛼\\alpha is the content code encoded by the content encoder Ecsubscript𝐸𝑐E_{c},\nγssubscript𝛾𝑠\\gamma_{s} and βssubscript𝛽𝑠\\beta_{s} are the style parameters extracted from the reference anime-face 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y}. Decoder.\nThe decoder F𝐹F constructs an image from a content code and style codes. However, different from typical image translations that transfer styles while preserving both local and global structures of source image, our decoder aims to transform the local shapes of facial parts and preserve the global structure of the source photo-face during style transfer. Recent image translation methods 1  [ref]18 [ref]24  transfer the style of the target domain by equipping residual blocks (resblocks) in the bottleneck of the generator with style codes. However, we observe that such decoder architectures cannot well handle the StyleFAT task. Specifically, they are either insufficient to elaborately transfer an anime style, or introduce visually annoying artifacts in generated faces.\nTo decode high-quality anime-faces for StyleFAT, we propose an adaptive stack convolutional block (denoted as ASC block), Fine-grained Style Transfer (FST) block and two normalization functions for the decoder (see Fig. 2) ASC block Existing methods such as MUNIT [ref]18, FUNIT 1, and EGSC-IT transfer styles to generate images via injecting the style information of the target domain into the resblocks in the bottleneck of their decoder. However, we observe that resblocks may ignore some anime-style information, which degrades the translation performance of decoder on StyleFAT task. More specifically, although multiple reference images with different anime styles are given, the decoder with resblocks synthesizes similar styles for specific regions, especially on eyes. For example, the decoder with resblocks improperly renders right eyes with the same color in the generated images (see Fig. 7).\nWe argue that the decoder would ”skip” some injected style information due to the residual operation.\nTo address this issue, we propose an ASC block for the decoder. ASC stacks convolutional layers, activation, and our proposed normalization layers, instead of using resblocks, as shown in Fig. 2. FST block\nOne aim of our decoder is to transform local facial features into anime-like ones,\ndifferent from existing methods which preserve local structures from a source photo-face. We here explore how to transform local shapes in the decoder when transferring styles.\nOne possible solution is to first employ face parsing or facial landmark detection to detect facial features and then transform local facial features via warping like .\nHowever, since the local structure of anime-faces and photo-faces are significantly dissimilar to each other, warping often leads to artifacts in the generated anime-faces. For example, it is difficult to well warp the mouth of a photo-face into a tiny one of a reference anime-face.\nInstead of employing face parsing or facial landmark detection, our insight is that local structures can be treated as a kind of styles like color/texture and can be altered through style transfer. Therefore, we propose a FST module to simultaneously transform local shapes of the source image and transfer color/texture information from the reference image.\nIn particular, as revealed in the literature, deep- and shallow-layer feature maps with low and high resolutions in the decoder indicate different levels of semantic information from high-level structures to low-level colors/textures. Motivated by the fact, we argue that the FST block can adaptively learn to transform local shapes and decode color/texture information by injecting the style information into feature maps with different resolutions. In other words, since the feature map contains high-level structural information, FST can learn to transform local shapes into anime-like ones with the specified style information. Thus, as shown in Fig. 2, FST consists of a stack of upsampling, convolutional, and normalization layers. Furthermore, style codes are injected after the upsampling layer in our FST block, different from the prior works [ref]18 [ref]24 1 that only injects style codes into the bottleneck of the generator. Consequently, FST block enables the decoder to adaptively synthesize color/texture and transform local shapes, according to both the style codes and different levels of feature maps. Normalization Recent image translation methods  [ref]18  normalize the feature statistics of an image via Adaptive\nInstance Normalization (AdaIN) to adjust the color/texture styles of the image.\nHowever, we aim to devise normalization functions which not only transfer color/texture styles from the reference, but also transform local shapes of the source image based on the reference.\nRecently, it was shown in [ref]24 that layer normalization (LN)  can transform the structure/shape of an image.\nBesides, AdaLIN was proposed in [ref]24 to control the degree of changes in textures and shapes by adaptively combining AdaIN and LN.\nHowever, AdaLIN is insufficient to simultaneously transfer the color/texture information of a local region and its shape information from a reference image to a generated image.\nThat is, since AdaLIN combines IN and LN in a per-channel manner, AdaLIN ignores the correlations among channels. For example, the shape styles of eyes and their color/texture styles may respectively dominate in different channels. In such case, the features learned by AdaLIN often ignore shape styles or color/texture styles. In other words, the combination space of AdaLIN tends to be smaller than that of all-channel combinations of IN and LN. To address the above issue, we propose two novel normalization functions called point-wise layer instance normalization (PoLIN) and adaptive point-wise layer instance normalization (AdaPoLIN) for the generator.\nour PoLIN and AdaPoLIN learn to combine all channels of IN and LN, different from AdaLIN [ref]24. To achieve all-channel combination of instance normalization (IN)  and LN, PoLIN learns to combine IN and LN via a 1×1111\\times 1 convolutional layer as defined below: where C​o​n​v​(⋅)𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣⋅Conv(\\cdot) denotes the 1×1111\\times 1 convolution operation, [⋅,⋅]⋅⋅[\\cdot,\\cdot] denotes the channel-wise concatenation, 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z} is the the feature map of a network layer, μIsubscript𝜇𝐼\\mu_{I}, μLsubscript𝜇𝐿\\mu_{L} and σIsubscript𝜎𝐼\\sigma_{I}, σLsubscript𝜎𝐿\\sigma_{L} denote the channel-wise and layer-wise means and standard deviations, respectively. AdaPoLIN adaptively combines IN and LN, while employing the style codes from the reference anime-faces to retain style information: where γssubscript𝛾𝑠\\gamma_{s} and βssubscript𝛽𝑠\\beta_{s} are style codes,\nand the bias in C​o​n​v​(⋅)𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣⋅Conv(\\cdot) is fixed to 0. Thanks to their all-channel combination of IN and LN, the proposed PoLIN and AdaPoLIN lead to a larger combination space than AdaLIN, thereby making them beneficial to handle color/texture style transfer and local shape transformation for StyleFAT.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: of source image, our decoder aims to transform the local shapes of facial parts and preserve the global structure of the source photo-face during style transfer.
