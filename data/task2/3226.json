      "content": "Paper Title: GCoD: Graph Convolutional Network Acceleration via Dedicated Algorithm and Accelerator Co-Design\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModels, Datasets, and Training Settings.\nOur evaluation considers five GCN algorithms, including three representative full-batch training GCN algorithms (i.e., GCN , GAT , and GIN ),\none mini-batch training GCN algorithm (i.e., GraphSAGE [ref]14), and one deep ResGCN ,\nand six graph datasets, including three citation graph datasets (Cora, CiteSeer, and Pumbed) , the one knowledge graph (NELL) ,\nand the two large scale datasets (Obgn-ArXiv from Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) \nand Reddit post dataset [ref]14), respectively.\nThe specifications of the aforementioned five GCN models are summarized in Tab. IV, from which we can see that\nthe adopted GCNs and GINs consist of 16 hidden units for the three citation graphs and 64 hidden units for the NELL and Reddit graphs, following a SOTA GCN accelerator [ref]13; the GAT models consist of 8 hidden units and 8 heads; the GraphSAGE models adopt two layers and the same hidden dimensions as GCNs, with a neighborhood sample size of 25 and 10, respectively, following the basic settings in [ref]9 [ref]14; and deep ResGCNs adopt 28 layers with 128 hidden units, following the settings in .\nWe train all the above GCN models for 400 epochs using an Adam optimizer  with a learning rate of 0.01.\nThe statistics of these six datasets are summarized in Tab. III. We follow the same dataset splits as described in  [ref]14 . *GCoD (8-bit) uses 10240 PEs as 8-bit saves required bandwidth. Baselines and Evaluation Metrics.\nTo benchmark our GCoD with SOTA GCN acceleration works, we consider a total of nine baselines: PyTorch Geometric (PyG) [ref]9 and Deep Graph Library (DGL)  on a Linux workstation with Intel Xeon E5-2680 v3 CPUs and NVIDIA RTX 8000 GPUs, respectively, and SOTA GCN accelerators HyGCN , AWB-GCN [ref]13,\nand Deepburning-GL on three FPGA platforms (i.e., ZC706, KCU1500, and Alveo U50) . The system configurations of the baselines and our GCoD are summarized in Tab. V.\nWe evaluate all above platforms in terms of acceleration latency speedups, energy consumption, and required off-chip memory bandwidth and accesses.\nIn addition, we compare the achieved accuracy of GCoD algorithm with SOTA GCN compression baselines, including RP , SGCN , QAT , and Degree-Quant . Hardware Experiment Setup.\nTo evaluate GCoD accelerator, we consider the standard FPGA evaluation and implementation flows in Vivado 2018.3 . Specifically, we adopt a Xilinx VCU128 FPGA board , which is equipped with 9024 DSPs, 42MB on-chip memory, and 460 GB/s HBM off-chip memory, where the off-chip memory bandwidth is proportionally distributed across GCoD’s sub-accelerators based on their assigned workloads/resources.\nFor a fair comparison with AWB-GCN [ref]13, GCoD accelerator is clocked at 330MHz and adopts 4096 PEs with a 32-bit fixed point precision.\nIn addition, we discuss a GCoD variant that supports the quantized GCNs and termed as GCoD (8-bit). Quantization largely reduces the off-chip memory bandwidth requirement and thus enable GCoD (8-bit) to afford 10240 on-chip PEs (≈\\approx 5200 DSPs).\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: evaluation considers five GCN algorithms, including three representative full-batch training GCN algorithms (i.e., GCN , GAT , and GIN ),\none mini-batch training GCN algorithm (i.e., GraphSAGE [ref]14), and one deep ResGCN ,\nand six graph datasets, including three citation graph datasets (Cora, CiteSeer, and Pumbed) , the one knowledge graph (NELL) ,\nand the two large scale datasets\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
