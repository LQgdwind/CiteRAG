      "content": "Paper Title: Finite-valued Streaming String Transducers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe have drawn a rather complete\npicture of finite-valued SSTs and answered several open questions of [ref]5.\nRegarding expressiveness, they can be decomposed as unions of deterministic SST\n(Theorem 1), and they are\nequivalent to finite-valued two-way transducers\n(Theorem 2), and to ”finite-valued”\nnon-deterministic MSO\ntransductions (see Section 1). On the algorithmic side,\ntheir equivalence problem is decidable in elementary time\n(Theorem 3) and ”finite valuedness” of ”SSTs” is\ndecidable in PSpace (PTime for a fixed number of\nvariables), see Theorem 4. As an alternative proof\nto the result of , our results imply the\nPSpace decidability of ”finite valuedness” for two-way transducers\n(Corollary 1). Because of the effective expressiveness\nequivalence between ”SSTs” and non-deterministic MSO transductions, our\nresult also entails decidability of ”finite valuedness” for the latter\nclass. A first interesting question is how big the valuedness of an ”SST” can\nbe.\nIn the classical case of one-way transducers the valuedness has been\nshown to be at most exponential (if finite at all) .\nWe can obtain a bound from Lemma 8, but the\nvalue is likely to be sub-optimal. Our ”equivalence” procedure relies on the\ndecomposition of a k𝑘k-valued ”SST” into a union of k𝑘k ”deterministic”\n”SSTs” each of elementary size. Our construction is likely to\nbe sub-optimal again, and so is our complexity for checking ”equivalence”.\nOn the other hand, only a PSpace lower bound is\nknown . A better understanding of the\ncomplexity of the ”equivalence” problem for (sub)classes of ”SSTs” is a\nchallenging question. Already for ”deterministic” ”SSTs”, ”equivalence”\nis only known to be between NLogSpace and\nPSpace . However, beyond the ”finite-valued” setting there is little hope to\nfind a natural restriction on ”valuedness” which would preserve\nthe decidability of the ”equivalence” problem. Already for\none-way transducers of linear ”valuedness” (i.e. where the number\nof outputs is linear in the ”input” length), ”equivalence” is\nundecidable, as shown through a small modification of the\nproof of . ”Deterministic” ”SSTs” have been extended,\nwhile preserving decidability of the ”equivalence problem”,\nin several ways:\nto copyful ”SSTs”  ,\nwhich allow to copy the content of variables several times,\nto infinite strings , and to\ntrees .\nGeneralizations of these results to the ”finite-valued” setting\nyield interesting questions. On trees, similar questions\n(effective ”finite valuedness”, decomposition and ”equivalence”)\nhave been answered positively for bottom-up tree\ntransducers 1. Finally, ”SSTs” have linear ”input”-to-”output” growth (in the length of the\nstrings). There is a recent trend in extending transducer models\nto allow polynomial growth\n [ref]10 [ref]11 ,\nand ”finite valuedness” has not yet been studied in this context.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: We have drawn a rather complete\npicture of finite-valued SSTs and answered several open questions of [ref]5.\nRegarding expressiveness, they can be decomposed as unions of deterministic SST\n(Theorem 1), and they are\nequivalent to finite-valued two-way transducers\n(Theorem 2), and to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
