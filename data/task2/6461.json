      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Polychromatic Neural Representation for CT Metal Artifact Reduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComparison on Simulation Data. Table 1 presents the quantitative results. On the DeepLesion dataset , ACDNet , our Polyner, and DICDNet  achieve the top three performances and significantly outperform other baseline models. Specifically, our Polyner produces the second-best performance, trailing slightly behind ACDNet  by only -0.62 dB in PSNR. However, on the XCOM dataset , we observe that DICDNet and ACDNet trained on the DeepLesion dataset  suffer from severe performance drops due to the OOD problem. Their performance is even lower than that of the model-based NMAR  algorithm, with -3.98 dB and -3.59 dB in PSNR, respectively. In contrast, our Polyner obtains the best performance, slightly outperforming CNN-MAR trained on the XCOM dataset  by +0.22 dB in PSNR. Fig. 2 shows the qualitative results. Notably, three model-based algorithms (FBP , LI , and NMAR ) and two unsupervised methods (ADN 0 and Score-MAR ) cannot yield satisfactory results, exhibiting severe artifacts on both datasets. Conversely, while DICDNet  and ACDNet for the DeepLesion dataset  yield excellent MAR performances, their results on the XCOM dataset  include severe artifacts. This contrasts with CNN-MAR [ref]7, which achieves superior results for the XCOM dataset  but not for the DeepLesion dataset . These visual inspections are consistent with the above quantitative comparisons. Remarkably, our proposed Polyner presents clean and fine-detail CT reconstructions for both datasets, indicating its robustness and superiority over existing MAR methods. More visual results can be found in the supplementary material. Comparison on Real Data. Though our Polyner model performs best on the two simulation datasets, it is important to study its performance on real collected CT data. To achieve this, we insert a metal paper clip into a walnut sample and then scan it with a commercial Bruker SKYSCAN 1276 micro-CT, as shown in Fig 3 (Left). We compare five baselines with our Polyner for reconstructing a 2D slice of the sample. The remaining three baselines (NMAR , CNN-MAR [ref]7, and ADN 0) are not compared because they require prior knowledge of water-bone segmentation, which is invalid for the walnut sample. Fig. 3 (Right) demonstrates the qualitative results. FBP  performs the worst, producing severe shadow artifacts. LI  exhibits local deformations in the reconstructed images. Score-MAR  almost fails due to the domain shift problem. ACDNet  is not effective in completely removing these shadow artifacts, it instead produces an offset in image contrast. In comparison, our Polyner recovers the best visual results in both image details and contrast. We also present the quantitative results in Fig. 3. The proposed Polyner achieves the best performance in two metrics. However, it is worth noting that the quantitative performances of all methods are relatively low (the best PSNR of 22 dB by our Polyner) since the reference CT image cannot be considered GT due to the non-negligible non-rigid deformation caused by the metal paper clip insertion. In addition, we compare our Polyner with FDK algorithm  on the real mouse tight sample scanned by a 3D cone-beam CT geometry. Related results are provided in the supplementary material.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: datasets.
