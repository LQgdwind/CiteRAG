Submitted to Multimedia Tools and Applications, Springer.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA number of recent machine learning-based approaches leveraging structured data for social navigation have been recently published.\nA GNN model integrated with a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm based in Monte Carlo Tree Search was presented in [ref]5.\nIt utilises a graph-based model to detect the implicit relations between the humans in a room.\nInteractions are useful to predict future human trajectories.\nFor instance, interacting pedestrians generally behave differently than those who do not interact.\nThis phenomena is also exploited in [ref]7, where a GCN-based DRL leverages the gaze of humans to estimate interactions and predict their trajectories.\nThese works consider human-robot and human-human relations but disregard interactions with objects or obstacles that could be exploited.\nMoreover, the DRL algorithms in [ref]5 and [ref]7 use a simple handcrafted reward function based on the minimum distance between the robot and the humans that disregards any other information including the orientation and velocity of the humans or how densely populated the room is (distance restrictions are usually eased in crowded spaces).\nDue to the variety of different scenarios and factors to consider, handcrafting a reward function that complies with social rules seems prohibitively complex and time-consuming. A model combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a GNN to learn an action policy for multi-robot navigation is presented in [ref]22.\nThe CNN extracts features from local observations of the environment, and the action policy for the robot swarm is computed from those features using GNN.\nAlthough safety and collision avoidance are considered, the approach only considers humans as obstacles. Other works use GNNs for reasoning and perception in the domain of social navigation.\nA significant amount of them directs their focus to the prediction of pedestrians’ paths as exemplified in works undertaken by ,  or .\nThe use of GNNs for these tasks allows extracting additional information from the crowd such as relations between people.\nHowever, none of the previous works tackle the problem of modelling discomfort. GNNs have been used to model and estimate discomfort in our previous works,  and .\nBoth works generate discomfort estimations in a scale from 0 to 100 and consider human-human, human-robot and human-object interactions, as well as walls and other objects.\nWhile  generates a single value a given scenario,  generates a two-dimensional cost map using a combination of GNNs and CNNs, in that order.\nThe main limitation of these models is that the scenarios they consider are static (i.e., they disregard human and robot motion). The work at hand follows a similar approach to  with a number of enhancements.\nFirstly, we consider two different scores to measure two aspects of social navigation (see section 3).\nSecondly, the model is trained using dynamic scenes where humans and the robot move, which was the main limitation of .\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: structured data for social navigation have been recently published.\nA GNN model integrated with a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm based in Monte Carlo Tree Search was presented in [ref]5.\nIt utilises a graph-based model to detect the implicit relations between the humans in a room.\nInteractions are useful to predict future human trajectories.\nFor instance, interacting\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
