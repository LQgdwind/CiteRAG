      "content": "Paper Title: WorkflowHub: a registry for computational workflows\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs the name of the registry suggests, the underlying aim of WorkflowHub is to act as a “Hub”, and specifically a Hub that helps to connect the workflows ecosystem and ease the interoperation of its constituent platforms and services. To realise this, WorkflowHub relies on a web-friendly metadata framework that simultaneously supports data representation within the registry itself, while also acting as a foundation for exchange of data and metadata between the platforms and services that are described in Figure 1. Here, we provide more details for three core areas that underpin this “Hub” functionality . WorkflowHub participates in the EOSC federated Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure through LS-Login and the OAuth2 protocol, in addition to also supporting authentication via GitHub. This feature allows systems interacting with WorkflowHub to identify users as the same individual across different systems – even with their identity provided by their participating institutional accounts – enabling single-sign on and smart authorization decisions on accessing and operating on workflows, their metadata and other resources across the ecosystem forming around WorkflowHub. To help describe workflows and their components, the registry uses three profiles from bioschemas : Computational Tool232323https://bioschemas.org/profiles/ComputationalTool/1.0-RELEASE, Computational Workflow242424https://bioschemas.org/profiles/ComputationalWorkflow/1.0-RELEASE, and Formal Parameter252525https://bioschemas.org/profiles/FormalParameter/1.0-RELEASE. Even though these are a part of the bioschemas effort, the profiles support a discipline independent and standardised way of describing workflows and their components. In addition, and owing to close collaboration with the Common Workflow Language (CWL) [ref]35  community, the CWL workflow specification is encouraged as a workflow language independent way of describing a WorkflowHub entry. This is the so-called “Abstract CWL”. This format can even hold semantic annotations, which WorkflowHub leverages to extract the typing of workflow inputs and outputs, as well as EDAM ontology concepts for Topics and Operations . RO-Crate  is a standard for FAIR Research Objects. It was developed by the community to package a workflow with the components required to understand and execute that workflow. The additional packaged components may include test data, Abstract CWL, diagrams, publications, and SOPs, as well as the flat metadata file that provides the context for all these assets262626https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/ . The implementation of RO-Crate is central to the ability of WorkflowHub to interoperate and exchange Workflow-RO-Crate272727https://w3id.org/workflowhub/workflow-ro-crate/1.0 data with the ecosystem in Figure 1 (e.g. Zenodo archiving) and for exposing workflows as FAIR Digital Objects  . WorkflowHub can also interoperate with workflow execution platforms that are part of the ecosystem (see Figure 1) through its implementation of the GA4GH Tools Registry Service (TRS) API282828https://ga4gh.github.io/tool-registry-service-schemas/292929https://www.ga4gh.org/product/tool-registry-service-trs/. This means that a user of a TRS enabled analysis platform, like Galaxy, is able to search for and retrieve workflows, without leaving the platform. It also means that WorkflowHub can send workflows to these platforms, ready for execution. Ultimately, the impact of these features is threefold. Firstly, WorkflowHub is able to support machine actionability, as described by the FAIR principles . This underpins the registry’s ability to connect to services and platforms that are in use day-to-day by workflow users and developers. Finally, these same users are able to access this ecosystem “Hub” using multiple authentication mechanisms and leverage multiple standards when contributing workflows.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: the profiles support a discipline independent and standardised way of describing workflows and their components.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
