      "content": "Paper Title: An Empirical Study on Bugs Inside PyTorch: A Replication Study\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFollowing the replicated study on TensorFlow , we classified the analyzed bugs’ root causes into 1 of 11 categories. Our results show that more than 25% of the bugs analyzed were caused by inconsistencies in the APIs which demonstrate that PyTorch requires more time and development effort in order to be a truly reliable framework. In the following, we discuss the 11 categories for root causes of bugs in PyTorch from the 194 bugs analyzed. Logic error (25.77%). The bugs in this category were caused by wrong programming logic. For example, in issue #50663 , maintainers report a bug in the implementation of a deep copy operation. A deep copy operation is expected to create an exact replica of the copied object, however, a wrong logic in the implementation caused it to not copy part of the object (gradient buffer), causing users to experience undefined behavior errors. Inconsistency (25.26%). The bugs in this category were caused by changing the APIs or updating the framework’s version which resulted in inconsistencies or incompatibilities between framework interfaces, modules, or functions. For example, pull request (PR) #53424  reports a bug in calling a tensor object. This bug was caused because of name shadowing after adding a new module in an update which raised an error during creating new tensor objects. Algorithm (12.37%). The bugs in this category were caused by wrong implementation of algorithms, such as incorrect algorithmic logic or incorrect implementation of algorithmic concepts. For example, in PR #56488  NumPy was reported to generate the same random number for each data batch as opposed to the expected behaviour. NumPy is actively used in PyTorch’s implementation and an incorrect usage of its API had caused this bug. Corner case (9.79%). The bugs in this category, were caused by wrong handling of corner cases. Corner cases are considered particular use-cases or program execution flow that are not generally used or triggered by library users, but must, nevertheless, be handled by the library. For example, in issue #16532 , it was reported that gradients are missing when autograd is called inside a function on Multi-GPUs. We classify such issues as corner cases since most developers will not use PyTorch functions in such a way. Configuration error (8.76%). The bugs in this category were caused by wrong configurations. For example, issue #22389  reports a bug which caused the developers to be unable to use TensorBoard. This bug happened because a dependency which was required for TensorBoard’s functionality was not installed during PyTorch installation. Type confusion (8.25%). The bugs in this category were caused by type mismatches. Such issues present errors that stop the program from functioning. For example, issue #42218  reports that the program failed to function because of such an error. Memory (3.09%). The bugs in this category were caused by incorrect usage of memory resources. These issues can be caused because of using too much RAM or memory leaks. For example, issue #35901  reports that program failed during run because of an out of memory error. The rest of the root cause categories were not prevalent enough to be a cause of concern. Referenced type errors (2.58%) such as issue #42435  were caused by incorrect include or import statements. Processing type (2.06%) errors such as issue #49052  were caused by program variables being initialized or assigned incorrectly, using incorrect formats for variables, or other incorrect data processing related usages. Concurrency (1.55%) and dimension mismatch (0.52%) type errors were caused by synchronization problems (such as issue #67626 ) and dimension mismatch during tensor computation and transformation operations (such as PR #71065 ), respectively. Figure 2 shows which symptoms a root cause can have based on our findings, providing a detailed view of which symptoms and root cause relationship.\nMost notable from our results is that Hang is only present in bugs stemming from Logic errors, albeit making up only a small proportion of its symptoms. Logic error bugs, on the other hand, manifest through all symptom types found in this study. Functional error and Crash are the most frequent symptoms for Logic error bugs, making up altogether over half of the total symptoms for Logic error bugs. Another interesting finding is that Concurrency issues only display Performance degradation as a symptom. In addition, the only symptom of Dimension mismatch in our study were Warning-style errors and configuration error bugs also most often display as Build failures. Comparison of bug root causes between TensorFlow and PyTorch.\nFigure 3 shows the comparison between our results and the results reported by Jia et al. .\nWe first note a few similarities on the common bug root causes across both libraries.\nInconsistencies are the second most important bug root cause in both libraries, where changes in the APIs caused breaking changes or incompatible behaviour in the library.\nAnother common theme is the prevalence of type confusion bugs across both libraries, a common issue in dynamically typed languages such as Python and configuration errors, due to the highly configurable nature of both libraries [ref]3 .\nThere is, however, some stark contrast between frequencies of bug root causes.\nLogic error (25%) was the primary cause of bugs in PyTorch, while TensorFlow bugs were primarily caused by Processing-related issues (22%).\nAnother major difference is that we find a much higher occurrence of bugs caused by wrong implementation of algorithms (12% in PyTorch) than the figures reported in TensorFlow (3%).\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: of type confusion bugs across both libraries, a common issue in dynamically typed languages such as Python and configuration errors, due to the highly configurable nature of both libraries [ref]3 .\nThere is, however, some stark contrast between frequencies of bug root causes.\nLogic error (25%) was the primary cause of bugs in PyTorch, while TensorFlow bugs were primarily caused by\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
