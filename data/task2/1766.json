Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Contrastive Reasoning in Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we consider contrastive explanations on large scale and fine-grained recognition. Large-scale datasets, like ImageNet [ref]46, consist of a wide variety of classes. Fine-grained recognition is the subordinate categorization of similar objects such as different types of birds, and cars among themselves . We consider Stanford Cars  and traffic sign recognition CURE-TSR [ref]55 datasets for fine-grained recognition. On ImageNet, we use PyTorch’s ImageNet pretrained VGG-161616 [ref]52 architecture to show results in Fig. 3. VGG-161616 is chosen to be consistent with Grad-CAM. Note that we tested generating contrastive explanations on other architectures including AlexNet , SqueezeNet , VGG-191919 [ref]52, ResNet-18,34,50,10118345010118,34,50,101 , and DenseNet-161161161 . On Stanford Cars dataset, we replace and train the final fully connected layer of an ImageNet pre-trained VGG-161616 architecture to discriminate between 196196196 classes. For CURE-TSR, we use the trained network provided by the authors in [ref]55. The results from the fine-grained datasets and the cat-dog image used in Grad-CAM  are shown in Fig. 3. Note that the time taken to generate a contrastive explanation is the same as Grad-CAM.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: In this section, we consider contrastive explanations on large scale and fine-grained recognition.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
