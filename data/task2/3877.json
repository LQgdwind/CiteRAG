      "content": "Paper Title: Explain and Conquer: Personalised Text-based Reviews to Achieve Transparency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDyadic data refer to a domain with two finite sets of elements in which observations are made for dyads (i.e., pairs with one element from each set). These pairs are connected considering N−M𝑁𝑀N-M relationships. That is, an item from the first set can be linked to M𝑀M different items from the second set and an item from the second set can be linked to N𝑁N different items from the first set. Let us assume that the two kind of objects correspond to a set of users U𝑈U and a set of items I𝐼I. Data D𝐷D is organised in dyads (d) as follows: where i​n​tj​k𝑖𝑛subscript𝑡𝑗𝑘int_{jk} is the interaction established between ujsubscript𝑢𝑗u_{j} and i​tk𝑖subscript𝑡𝑘it_{k}. In the social network domain, interactions are established through different mechanisms (e.g., giving likes, uploading photos, posting comments and so on). Since we are exploring the transparency and explanation of the network in the NLU (Natural Language Understanding) domain, we have restricted these interactions to the text in the context of TripAdvisor (i.e., reviews). In this regard, we have adapted the formulation as follows: where r​e​sk𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘res_{k} is a restaurant from the set R𝑅R and t​e​x​tj​k𝑡𝑒𝑥subscript𝑡𝑗𝑘text_{jk} the review the user ujsubscript𝑢𝑗u_{j} posted about the restaurant r​e​sk𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘res_{k}. We can represent these interactions using a directed graph. These structures are represented by nodes connected using directed edges. These edges can be labelled, specifying weights. Adapting this idea to the TripAdvisor social network, as depicted in Figure 1: Nodes: represent the users uj∈Usubscript𝑢𝑗𝑈u_{j}\\in U and restaurants r​e​sk∈R𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘𝑅res_{k}\\in R. Users establish interactions with restaurants by posting reviews (uj→r​e​sk→subscript𝑢𝑗𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘u_{j}\\to res_{k}) but not in reverse (r​e​sk↛uj↛𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘subscript𝑢𝑗res_{k}\\not\\to u_{j}). Edges: represent the interactions between the nodes. Focusing on directed and text-based interactions, an edge (uj→r​e​sk→subscript𝑢𝑗𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘u_{j}\\to res_{k}) defines a dyad (uj,resk,textj​k)∈Du_{j},res_{k},text_{jk})\\in D. User context: we define the context C​(uj)𝐶subscript𝑢𝑗C(u_{j}) of a user ujsubscript𝑢𝑗u_{j} as the set of interactions: We defined these contexts in a city-based scenario C​(uj)c​i​t​y𝐶subscriptsubscript𝑢𝑗𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦C(u_{j})_{city} to simplify and demarcate the graphs. Weights: the interactions (uj→𝑠r​e​sk𝑠→subscript𝑢𝑗𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘u_{j}\\xrightarrow{s}res_{k}) could be either positive or negative, according to the integer score s∈ 𝑠15s\\in  associated with the review. We defined\nnegative interactions as s∈ 𝑠13s\\in  and positives as s∈ 𝑠45s\\in . When the users interact (i.e., posting new comments) in TripAdvisor, they generate new pairs in the network, inherently explained with text since these pairs are supported by the authorship of the reviews. However, new pairs can also be suggested by other more opaque methods, such as recommender systems or paid promotion mechanisms. These methods leverage the available interactions and other features to match users U𝑈U with restaurants R𝑅R. Despite the fact that these systems thoroughly proved their success, there is a gap in the research field related to the explanation of why these new pairs are suggested. From a general business point of view, recommender systems and paid promotion mechanism methods improve on customer satisfaction. In the case of recommender systems, the impact generating business value is noticeable. Netflix, for example, disclosed in a blog post  that “(…) 75% of what people watch is from some sort of recommendation (…)” . Moreover, Netflix still grows its subscriber base by about 10% yearly (i.e., 6 million new subscribers per year) and has identified over 2,000 “taste communities” with specific content preferences . Furthermore, Netflix personalised recommendations have increased user engagement and helped to reduce customer churn over the last years . Netflix thumbnails are used to present items (films or series) to the users. The same item can be presented to the users in very different ways, depending on their interactions in the platform and their interests, so that these thumbnails change accordingly . This intuitive idea is depicted in Figure 2. Amazon, on its side, attributes up to 35% of the revenue to the cross-selling system (i.e., recommendation related to the features “Frequently bought together” and “Customers who bought this item also bought”) . Recommendations are reinforced if we look at the most well-known online platforms, where a major part of the home page and interface is used to show personalised content to the users. Personalisation really matters to customers, and to business. 93% of companies with advanced recommendation strategies in their processes have significantly increased their revenue in recent years [ref]6. The later report [ref]6 states that 77% of businesses that exceeded their revenue goals in 2019 have a documented personalisation strategy, while 74% have a dedicated budget for it. Thus, personalisation and explanation play a crucial part in the acceptability of the user. Particularly in the context of TripAdvisor, it is not only important to present an interesting restaurant for the user, but also it is of utmost importance how this presentation is made. Our intention is to fill this gap by proposing a general framework for dyadic data text-based explanation, with a practical example in this social network. When one of the aforementioned methods (recommender system or paid promotion mechanism) matches a user from U𝑈U to a restaurant from R𝑅R, our model PTER (Personalised TExt-based Reviews) will choose for that user, and from among the reviews available in the system, the text that he/she would have written as a review if he/she had visited the restaurant before. Therefore, our selected textual representation should resemble the authorship of the reviews, acting as a personalised summary of why that restaurant was linked to the user. There are more probabilities for the user to visit the restaurant if the algorithm shows a text that identifies his/her preferences. In other words, provided that we know in advance the new suggested pairs by these systems (e.g., recommender systems, paid promotion mechanisms and so on), we aim to answer the question “how to present and explain it?”. Our contributions are as follows: We leveraged the deep transformer-encoder model BERT (Bidirectional Encoders Representations from Transformers)  as a pre-trained surrogate model to provide text-based explanations in a LTR (Learning To Rank) text retrieval task. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been explored in the TripAdvisor platform. We propose a way to explain dyads using the available reviews of the restaurants. We present a new data labelling proposal in dyadic environments for supervised NLP downstream tasks. We provide experimental results proving the consistency of our ground truth definition. This problem definition regarding explanation in dyadic data contexts can be further explored and proposed as a new benchmark task in NLU. We designed our own evaluation framework based on a clustering process to assess the human suitability of the explanations using a random adversary and an authorship reference, showing the significant improvement of our proposal. Moreover, we leveraged the EXTRA (EXplanaTion RAnking) benchmark datasets  to compare PTER with other state-of-the-art baselines. We publicly share six new TripAdvisor datasets [ref]9 corresponding to the cities of Barcelona, Madrid, New York, New Delhi, London and Paris to support further research regarding dyadic data explanation tasks. The remainder of the article is organised as follows: Section 2 presents the state-of-the-art works in relation to the explanation of pairs (user, item) in recommender systems and particularly in the hospitality context. In Section 3, we describe the data, the natural language pre-processing methods and the BERT model used in this work. In Section 4, we explain our approach, defining the problem at hand and the topology of the PTER model, as well as the basis of our evaluation framework. In Section 5, we continue with the experimental results. Finally, in Section 6, we summarise the conclusions and future research.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Personalisation really matters to customers, and to business. 93% of companies with advanced recommendation strategies in their processes have significantly increased their revenue in recent years [ref]6.
