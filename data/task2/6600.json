Replacing Theorem 2 by Theorem 2’ in the analysis of Section 3.7, we immediately obtain the following theorem. Consider any κ≥0𝜅0\\kappa\\geq 0.

The only difference between Theorem 6 and Theorem 6 is again that Condition (C4) is relaxed to Condition (C4’). We have implemented the optimization problem corresponding to Theorem 6 in Maple. The search is similar that the search done in Section 3.7, but imposes Condition (C4’) instead of (C4) on the parameters. The file of the optimization program can be found at . For κ=2𝜅2\\kappa=2, we obtain the upper bound which improves the upper bound ω<3.251640𝜔3.251640\\omega<3.251640 from Section 3 (i.e., the bound from ). The parameters giving this upper bound are shown in Table 7. For these parameters, we have which implies the bound ω​(2)<3.251502𝜔23.251502\\omega(2)<3.251502.\nThe file available at  also includes a program to check that these parameters satisfy all the constraints of Theorem 6, as well as these calculations.\nWe observe that for these parameters we have and thus Inequalities (C4’) and (D3) are saturated.\nIn Section 5 we will show how to relax (D3), which will give a better bound on ω​(κ)𝜔𝜅\\omega(\\kappa).\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: D_{\\alpha}}\\{\\alpha^{\\prime}_{N}\\}=\\alpha_{N} in Equation (25) of .\n{mytheorem}2’[Adapted from Section 6 in ]\nFor any set of parameters αi​j​k∈ℚ​[ref]0 [ref]1subscript𝛼𝑖𝑗𝑘ℚ01\\alpha_{ijk}\\in\\mathbb{Q}[ref]0 [ref]1 satisfying Conditions (C1), (C2), (C3), (C4’) and any large enough N𝑁N, the tensor\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
