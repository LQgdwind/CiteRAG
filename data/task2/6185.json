Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

RMSNorm is proposed as an alternative normalization technique in Transformers.\nSeveral large language models, such as Chinchilla  and LLaMA , use Pre-RMSNorm in their blocks .\nRMSNorm can help accelerate the training and inference with similar performance in these large models.\nSpecifically, the experiments in  show that RMSNorm improves the pre-training speed by 5%percent55\\% compared with the LayerNorm baseline. It is challenging to convert Transformers with one normalization to the other type.\nIt is not clear which version of normalization is more suitable for Transformers.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: Normalization plays a crucial role and has many variants in Transformers [ref]39.\nLayerNorm is widely used in Transformer architectures to address this issue.\nThe position of LN within the architecture is essential for the final performance.\nWhile the initial Transformer\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
