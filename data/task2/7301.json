      "content": "Paper Title: Accelerating hyperbolic t-SNE\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we will experimentally evaluate our hyperbolic acceleration scheme.\nFor our experiments, we use the data sets listed in Table I. The first three data sets and the last one contain data obtained from single-cell RNA sequencing .\nThe data by Lukk et al., the Planaria data set , and the C.Elegans are experimentally obtained gene expression atlases.\nThe first contains human cell data, the latter two contain flatworm data.\nIn contrast, the MyeloidProgenitors data consists of synthetic data, obtained via a boolean gene regulatory network .\nThese data sets are chosen due to their size variation and their use in previous hyperbolic t-SNE approaches   9.\nWe further include the MNIST data set, as it is a frequently used test set for dimensionality reduction algorithms.\nIt contains 70,000 hand-written images of the ciphers 0 to 9.\nFor the WordNet data set 5, consisting of word relations, we follow the general approach as outlined in previous work .\nThat is, we trained a network for 400 epochs, after which no significant change occurred.\nFrom this training, we pick the checkpoint with the lowest cost function value as input for our embeddings. When computing a hyperbolic t-SNE embedding of these data with our method, we perform the following steps that reflect best practices for Euclidean t-SNE as closely as possible.\nFirst, we employ principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the data to 50 dimensions to speed up computations as previously recommended [51, Sec. 4.2].\nThen, we further employ regular t-SNE strategies by first performing early exaggeration, that is, a series of gradient descent steps for which the attractive forces pi​jsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑗p_{ij} are amplified by multiplying them with a factor, see [51, Sec. 4.3].\nWe use an exaggeration factor of 12, following a corresponding ablation study .\nWe then apply several non-exaggerated gradient descent steps, that is, steps with regular pi​jsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑗p_{ij} as defined above, as with usual t-SNE [51, Sec. 3.4]. For the learning rate, we align with a heuristic from the Euclidean case.\nIn the Euclidean case, the initial learning rate is set to η=n/12𝜂𝑛12{\\eta=n/12} .\nWe observe that this setting alone causes embeddings that tend to the boundary of the Poincaré disk very quickly.\nTo slow this progression down and to enable a more thorough development of clusters in the hyperbolic case, we modify the Euclidean heuristic and set the initial learning rate to This is also because, within the hyperbolic disk, the distance between the left boundary and the right one is not large, for instance, dℋ​((−1+10−4,0),(1−10−4,0))≈80superscript𝑑ℋ1superscript10401superscript104080d^{\\mathcal{H}}\\left((-1+10^{-4},0),(1-10^{-4},0)\\right)\\approx 80.\nThus, the embedding has to grow significantly slower than in the Euclidean case, where embeddings easily grow to diagonal sizes of several hundred units. From this initial learning rate, we use momentum and gains as described for the Euclidean setting  .\nGradient descent optimization with momentum is available for hyperbolic space [10, Alg. 2] and we implement it via the machinery discussed above 7.\nThis allows us to rely on the comparatively rather small initial learning rate that builds up with momentum and gains.\nWe default to the same parameters used in the Euclidean case, that is, a momentum of 0.50.50.5 during early exaggeration and a momentum of 0.80.80.8 during the non-exaggerated iterations.\nFurthermore, we run all experiments with a uniform perplexity of 303030, which is in the recommended range [4, Tab. 2] and corresponds to the default values used in previous experiments .\nFurthermore, all accelerations use θ=0.5𝜃0.5{\\theta=0.5}, if not specified otherwise, as is used in previous work [ref]50.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: Tab. 2] and corresponds to the default values used in previous experiments .\nFurthermore, all accelerations use θ=0.5𝜃0.5{\\theta=0.5}, if not specified otherwise, as is used in previous work [ref]50.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
