      "content": "Paper Title: Faster maximal clique enumeration in large real-world link streams\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe question of listing maximal cliques in dynamical networks has emerged relatively recently as an important research question to describe the structure of interaction data with temporal information.\nThis problem has been considered in different ways: some see a dynamical network as a sequence of graph snapshots, which leads to tackle the problem as the evolution of cliques in graphs through time.\nThis is for instance the point of view adopted in  .\nOther works model the dynamical network as a link stream, thus acknowledging the intrinsically temporal aspect of the clique itself and thus look at it as an object which should be redefined in the dynamical context    [ref]42 [ref]3.\nWe focus on this second point of view. In this paper, we consider works that define cliques in link streams.\nThis issue has been addressed with slightly different formalisms: some consider the link streams formalism  [ref]42 and others use temporal networks one   [ref]3.\nAll these works nonetheless consider cliques as a set of vertices interacting during a given time interval, as discussed in Section 2.2.\nBoth representations contain the same information and it is simple to go from one representation to the other, making it possible to compare the efficiency of the different methods. Viard et al.  proposed the first algorithm to list maximal cliques in link streams.\nIn that work, links do not have duration but the cliques are themselves parameterized with a value ΔΔ\\Delta, and thus called ΔΔ\\Delta-cliques.\nIn this work ΔΔ\\Delta-cliques are defined such that all pairs of nodes in the ΔΔ\\Delta-clique interact at least once during each sub-interval of duration ΔΔ\\Delta.\nTheir algorithm has since then been both simplified and extended to the more general formalism of link streams in [ref]42.\nThe idea underlying this algorithm is to extend either in terms of time or nodes a clique in a link stream, starting from a specific link of the stream.\nWhile this method indeed allows to find all maximal cliques in the link stream, it relies on memoization in order to decide whether a given clique has already been processed and this induces a high memory usage, which is prohibitive in many cases. In parallel, Himmel et al.   proposed another algorithm to enumerate ΔΔ\\Delta-cliques in link streams (named temporal graphs in these papers).\nIt adapts the BK algorithm to this dynamical setting, and implement different pivoting strategies.\nThis version regularly outperforms the algorithm in , especially on larger ΔΔ\\Delta values.\nThe results are more contrasted when compared to the algorithm in [ref]42: depending on the experimental settings and the data under study, one or the other method may be more efficient.\nMore recently, a generalization of this algorithm has been proposed in Bentert et al. [ref]3 to list all maximal ΔΔ\\Delta-k𝑘k-plexes in link streams.\nA ΔΔ\\Delta-k𝑘k-plex in a link stream is defined by analogy with k𝑘k-plexes in a graph, which is a maximal subgraph of size s𝑠s such that any vertex in the k𝑘k-plex is adjacent to at least s−k𝑠𝑘s-k vertices in the subgraph.\nSo a ΔΔ\\Delta-k𝑘k-plex in a link stream is a subset of s𝑠s nodes and a time interval in which all pairs of nodes interact with at least s−k𝑠𝑘s-k vertices of the ΔΔ\\Delta-k𝑘k-plex, at least once during each sub-interval of duration ΔΔ\\Delta.\nNote that a ΔΔ\\Delta-111-plex (k=1𝑘1k=1) is equivalent to a ΔΔ\\Delta-clique, which allows to compare this algorithm to the others described above.\nHere also, the algorithm is based on the structure of the BK algorithm, but it contains a few implementation improvements on , which makes it more efficient in terms of practical computation times. Finally, some methods which were originally designed to update cliques in graphs that evolve with time may be exploited in the context of clique enumeration in link streams.\nIn particular, Das et al.  apply the Tomita et al.  clique enumeration method in this context.\nThis is done by enumerating the cliques that contain at least one edge that is new at the current time.\nWhile the formal problem is different from ours, this method can be directly adapted to our problem, as we will see in Section 4.1.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: dynamical network as a link stream, thus acknowledging the intrinsically temporal aspect of the clique itself and thus look at it as an object which should be redefined in the dynamical context    [ref]42 [ref]3.\nWe focus on this second point of view.
