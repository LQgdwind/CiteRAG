      "content": "Paper Title: Fully Spiking Actor Network with Intra-layer Connections for Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIntra-layer connections play an essential role in the brain and are widely used in SNNs. Generally, intra-layer connections can be divided into self connections and lateral connections. The former is widely used in spiking neural models to provide more complex and adaptive dynamics. The latter, also known as lateral interactions, was previously used to build different receptive fields in visual tasks. Caused by the reset mechanism, spiking neural models have the characteristics of self connection. Recurrent Spiking Neural Network (RSNN) fully exploits the self connection characteristics of spiking neural models, making them more adaptive [ref]43 [ref]17 . However, most of them are based on soft reset or hard reset, and cannot describe hyperpolarization, which reduces the readiness of biological neurons to fire again after recent firing activity. To solve this problem, AHP-neurons  model the after-hyperpolarizing (AHP) currents, leading to spike frequency adaptation. Although the update to the AHP-current in response to an output spike is fixed by a hyper-parameter, AHP-neurons develop a new way of self connection and provide a principled alternative to LSTM units for sequence processing tasks. In the field of neuroscience, the work on lateral interactions mainly focuses on the retina , which makes most of the work on lateral interactions in SNNs related to visual tasks   [ref]48. Because of its ability to sharpen edges and highlight contours, lateral interactions are used to extract features from images. Furthermore, lateral interactions are widespread in various regions of the brain . Frémaux et al.  use population coding to represent actions, and each neuron encodes a different motion vector. They adopt fixed lateral interactions in the neuron population to implement the N-winner-take-all mechanism, leading to generalization across actions. However, there are several problems in this method, such as depending on the relatively low-dimension action space, a large number of hyper-parameters need to be adjusted for different action spaces, which limits its application in complex tasks. Zhang et al.  use a method similar to ours to model intra-layer connections. The difference is that the spike-train level post-synaptic potentials (S-PSPs) are transmitted between neurons from the same layer, rather than the spike signals in our method. However, S-PSPs rely on a relatively long spike-train, which makes its simulation time much longer than the methods using back-propagation through time (e.g. ours) , resulting in relatively high energy consumption and inference time.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: models have the characteristics of self connection.
