Transfer learning (TL) based RL algorithms enable agents to quickly adapt to new tasks or transfer between agents to improve performance through knowledge sharing.\nMost of the current policy transfer works are mainly applied to the single-agent setting, performing policy transfer based on the similarity of tasks 3 4 5, or leveraging other agent’s policy for a compelling exploration of new tasks 6 7.\nIn the MARL setting, existing works transfer knowledge via policy distillation 8 9 or adaptively exploit a suitable policy based on the option learning .\nHowever, these methods are usually complex to model and sensitive to hyperparameters. In this paper, we propose a novel policy reciprocity (PR) framework in the collaborative setting  to solve the above problems, where each agent can share knowledge with other agents while learning to achieve mutually beneficial symbiosis.\nIn particular, we define an adjacency space for mismatched states, then each agent performs modified value iteration by exploiting these adjacency states. Under this setting, agents can learn more information from the policies of other agents even with observations of different dimensions, enhancing performance and accelerating the learning process. Moreover, theoretical analysis shows that multiple agents can achieve consensus with each other and gradually converge to the optimal value function by trading off the reciprocity potential, which provides guidance for empirical analysis. Finally, we extend PR with deep neural networks that can improve the performance of various existing MARL and transfer RL algorithms.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities in solving practical applications, such as the coordination of robotic swarms  and autonomous vehicles [ref]2.\nThe most popular method is the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm [ref]3 [ref]4 , which avoids both the combinatorial complexity of centralized training  and the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
