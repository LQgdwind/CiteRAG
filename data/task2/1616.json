New contributions include considering the speed and previous poses of the robot and the people around it. It also provides a new dataset. Submitted to Multimedia Tools and Applications, Springer.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a family of machine learning approaches which extend neural networks to be able to take graph-structured data as input.\nThey can perform classifications and regressions on graphs, nodes, edges, as well as predicting links when working with partially observable phenomena.\nExcept for few exceptions (e.g., ) GNNs are composed by similar stacked blocks (layers) operating on a graph whose structure remains static but the features associated to its nodes are updated in every layer of the network (see Fig. 1). As a consequence, the features associated to the nodes of the graph in each layer become more abstract and are influenced by a wider context as layers go deeper.\nThe features in the nodes of the last layer are frequently used to perform the final classification or regression. The first published efforts on applying neural networks to graphs date back to works by A. Sperduti et al. .\nGNNs were further studied and formalised by M. Gori et al.  and F. Scarselli et al. .\nHowever, it was with the appearance of Gated Graph Neural Networks 3 and especially Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs, ) that GNNs gained traction.\nA review and a unified notation for GNNs can be found in . Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN ) is one of the most common GNN blocks.\nBecause of its simplicity, we build on the GCN block to provide the reader with an intuition of how GNNs work.\nFollowing the notation proposed in , GCN blocks operate over a graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E), where V={vi}i=1:Nv𝑉subscriptsubscript𝑣𝑖:𝑖1superscript𝑁𝑣V=\\{v_{i}\\}_{i=1:N^{v}} is a set of nodes, being visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} the feature vector of node i𝑖i and Nvsuperscript𝑁𝑣N^{v} the number of vertices in the graph.\nE={(sk,rk)}k=1:Ne𝐸subscriptsubscript𝑠𝑘subscript𝑟𝑘:𝑘1superscript𝑁𝑒E=\\{(s_{k},r_{k})\\}_{k=1:N^{e}} is a set of edges where sksubscript𝑠𝑘s_{k} and rksubscript𝑟𝑘r_{k} are the source and destination indices of edge k𝑘k and Nesuperscript𝑁𝑒N^{e} is the number of edges in the graph.\nEach GCN layer generates an updated representation vi′superscriptsubscript𝑣𝑖′v_{i}^{\\prime} for each node visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} using two functions: For every node visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i}, the first function (ρe→v​(Ei)superscript𝜌→𝑒𝑣subscript𝐸𝑖\\displaystyle\\rho^{e\\rightarrow v}(E_{i})) is used to aggregate the feature vectors of other nodes with an edge towards visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} and generates a temporary aggregated feature e¯isubscript¯𝑒𝑖\\overline{e}_{i} which is used by the second function: The function ϕv​(e¯i,vi)superscriptitalic-ϕ𝑣subscript¯𝑒𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖\\phi^{v}(\\overline{e}_{i},v_{i}) is then used to generate an updated vi′superscriptsubscript𝑣𝑖′v_{i}^{\\prime} feature vector for each node i𝑖i from the aggregated feature vector e¯isubscript¯𝑒𝑖\\overline{e}_{i} using a neural network (usually a multi-layer perceptron, but the framework does not make any assumption on this): Such a learnable function is generally the same for all the nodes.\nBy stacking several blocks where features are aggregated and updated, the feature vectors can carry information from nodes far away in the graph and convey higher level features that can be finally used for classification or regressions. Several means of improving GCNs have been proposed.\nRelational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs ) extend GCNs by considering different types of edges separately.\nThey are applied to vertex classification and link prediction in  .\nGraph Attention Networks (GATs [ref]43) extend GCNs by adding self-attention mechanisms (see ).\nThey are applied to vertex classification in [ref]43.\nIn Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MPNNs ), the messages which are aggregated are not only composed of node features but also edge features.\nThis allows MPNNs to account for both vertex and edge features.\nFor a more detailed review of GNNs and the generalised framework, please refer to .\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs ) extend GCNs by considering different types of edges separately.\nThey are applied to vertex classification and link prediction in  .\nGraph Attention Networks (GATs [ref]43) extend GCNs by adding self-attention mechanisms (see ).\nThey are applied to vertex classification in [ref]43.\nIn Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MPNNs ), the messages which are\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
