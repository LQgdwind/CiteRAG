      "content": "Paper Title: Supermasks in Superposition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets, Models & Training  In this experiment we validate the performance of SupSup on SplitCIFAR100 and SplitImageNet. Following Wen et al. [ref]51, SplitCIFAR100 randomly partitions CIFAR100  into 20 different 5-way classification problems.\nSimilarly, SplitImageNet randomly splits the ImageNet [ref]5 dataset into 100 different 10-way classification tasks.\nFollowing [ref]51 we use a ResNet-18 with fewer channels for SplitCIFAR100 and a standard ResNet-50  for SplitImageNet. The Edge-Popup algorithm from [ref]39 is used to obtain supermasks for various sparsities with a layer-wise budget from . We either initialize each new mask randomly (as in [ref]39) or use a running mean of all previous learned masks. This simple method of ‚ÄúTransfer‚Äù works very well, as illustrated by Figure¬†2. Additional training details and hyperparameters are provided in Section¬†D. Computation  In Scenario ùñ¶ùñ¶ùñ¶ùñ¶\\mathsf{GG}, the primary advantage of SupSup from Mallya et al.  or Wen et al. [ref]51 is that SupSup does not require the base model WùëäW to be stored. Since WùëäW is random it suffices to store only the random seed. For a fair comparison we also train BatchE [ref]51 with random weights. The sparse supermasks are stored in the standard scipy.sparse.csc222https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html format with 16 bit integers. Moreover, SupSup requires minimal overhead in terms of forwards pass compute. Elementwise product by a binary mask can be implemented via memory access, i.e. selecting indices. Modern GPUs have very high memory bandwidth so the time cost of this operation is small with respect to the time of a forward pass. In particular, on a 1080 Ti this operation requires ‚àº1%similar-toabsentpercent1\\sim 1\\% of the forward pass time for a ResNet-50, less than the overhead of BatchE (computation in Section¬†D). Baselines  In Figure¬†2, for ‚ÄúSeparate Heads‚Äù we train different heads for each task using a trunk (all layers except the final layer) trained on the first task. In contrast ‚ÄúSeparate Heads - Rand W‚Äù uses a random trunk. BatchE results are given with the trunk trained on the first task (as in [ref]51) and random weights WùëäW. For ‚ÄúUpper Bound‚Äù, individual models are trained for each task. Furthermore, the trunk for task iùëñi is trained on tasks 1,‚Ä¶,i1‚Ä¶ùëñ1,...,i. For ‚ÄúLower Bound‚Äù a shared trunk of the network is trained continuously and a separate head is trained for each task. Since catastrophic forgetting occurs we omit ‚ÄúLower Bound‚Äù from Figure¬†2 (the SplitCIFAR100 accuracy is 24.5%).\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: Datasets, Models & Training  In this experiment we validate the performance of SupSup on SplitCIFAR100 and SplitImageNet.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
