Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: Demystifying Platform Requirements for Diverse LLM Inference Use Cases\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA key difference among LLMs compared to previous DNN models (such as ResNet [ref]74), is that the model execution shapes vary widely as the use case changes.\nA use case is characterized by three key features : Beam Size, Sbsubscript𝑆𝑏S_{b}: Number of parallel outputs maintained during the decode phase. Typically value: 2-4. Number of Input Tokens, τpsubscript𝜏𝑝\\tau_{p}: Number of tokens that the user has passed as the input prompt. This value varies widely with different applications. TT​T​F​Tsubscript𝑇𝑇𝑇𝐹𝑇T_{TTFT} depends primarily on τpsubscript𝜏𝑝\\tau_{p}. Number of Output Tokens, τdsubscript𝜏𝑑\\tau_{d}: Number of tokens to be generated during the decode phase in an auto-regressive fashion. Similar to τpsubscript𝜏𝑝\\tau_{p}, this value varies widely with different applications. Table IV shows the five use cases we considered for this work. These have varying input token lengths, output token lengths, and latency constraints. These use cases represent different real-world applications, such as chat Services, code generation, summarization, and question-answering.\nAdditionally, Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)  is used in almost all question-answering-based LLM agents. We also model this as a separate use case where the input tokens have context appended to the input prompt. We use the term LLM workload to refer to the specific job running on the\nhardware platform and placing specific computational demands, and define it as follows: W​o​r​k​l​o​a​d={U​s​e​c​a​s​e,L​L​M​M​o​d​e​l,O​p​t​i​m​i​z​a​t​i​o​n​s}𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑙𝑜𝑎𝑑𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝐿𝐿𝑀𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑂𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑧𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠Workload=\\{Usecase,LLMModel,Optimizations\\}\nwhere O​p​t​i​m​i​z​a​t​i​o​n​s={B​a​t​c​h​S​i​z​e,P​r​e​c​i​s​i​o​n,P​a​r​a​l​l​e​l​i​s​m}𝑂𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑧𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝐵𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑠𝑚Optimizations=\\{BatchSize,Precision,Parallelism\\} We use various hugging face datasets along with LLaMA tokenizer to estimate input and output tokens for various use cases.\nWe use dolphin dataset for chat services token estimation. We use LongBench6 for average token estimation for text summarization     and code generation .\nFor RAG-based applications, the context length can vary from a few thousand tokens to tens of thousands of tokens. We use MLDR[ref]55, a Multilingual Long-Document Retrieval dataset built on Wikipedia, to estimate additional context tokens to user input.\n\nReference markers found: [74]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]74: A key difference among LLMs compared to previous DNN models (such as ResNet [ref]74), is that the model execution shapes vary widely as the use case changes.\nA use case is characterized by three key features : Beam Size, Sbsubscript𝑆𝑏S_{b}: Number of parallel outputs\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
