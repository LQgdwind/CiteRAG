All data is provided in full in the results section of this paper.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur work is inspired by the recent paper [ref]1 by Atserias–Dalmau, which gives a sufficient condition for a PCSP to have linear width.121212While the result in [ref]1 is stated in terms of sublinear, as opposed to linear, width, the proof yields a linear-level, optimal lower bound.\nIn the language of the current paper,\nthat condition requires that any pair of vertices should be connected by oriented walks of length 222; thus, it corresponds to the case τ=2𝜏2\\tau=2 of our aperiodicity notion.\nAtserias–Dalmau’s condition is satisfied, in particular, by cliques, thus resulting in a linear-level lower bound against local consistency for the solution of approximate graph colouring. Extending the lower bound to approximate graph homomorphism requires dealing with graphs having arbitrarily high mixing time and, thus, it needs the full power of our Theorem 1.\nSome of the machinery of [ref]1 is used in this paper as a black box (in particular, a result on the sparsity of random hypergraphs obtained via Chernoff bounds). However, the transition from τ=2𝜏2\\tau=2 to arbitrarily high τ𝜏\\tau requires rather different proof ideas. In particular, the concept of τ𝜏\\tau-fibrosity that we introduce in this work to study the number of long, isolated chains of hyperedges in sparse hypergraphs turns out to behave differently for τ≤3𝜏3\\tau\\leq 3 and for τ≥4𝜏4\\tau\\geq 4: In the latter case, large fibrosity is not implied by sparsity alone, and bounds on the length of the shortest cycles in hypergraphs need to be established via a probabilistic analysis. A recent line of work established lower bounds against relaxations of approximate graph colouring   and homomorphism  based on linear and semidefinite programming as well as linear-equation solvers. NP-hardness of the former problem was proved in  conditional to Khot’s d𝑑d-to-111 Conjecture .\nBrakensiek–Guruswami conjectured that approximate graph homomorphism should be tractable in polynomial time if 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is bipartite or 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} has a loop, and NP-hard otherwise . Therefore, our Corollary 2 is consistent with — and supports — the conjectured complexity dichotomy for this problem.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Our work is inspired by the recent paper [ref]1 by Atserias–Dalmau, which gives a sufficient condition for a PCSP to have linear width.121212While the result in [ref]1 is stated in terms of sublinear, as opposed to linear, width, the proof\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
