      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-task Pre-training Language Model for Semantic Network Completion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe pre-training language model method could be divided into two categories: feature-based method and fine-tuning based method  . Traditional word embedding methods, such as Word2Vec  and Glove , aimed to use feature-based methods to learn context semantic information and express words in the form of feature vectors. ELMo [ref]36 extends traditional word embedding to context-aware word embedding where polysemy can be properly handled. Different from feature-based approaches,\nMLM-based pre-training method used in BERT [ref]37 opened up a pre-training paradigm of language model based on transformer structure.\nRoBERTa [ref]38 carefully measures the impact of key hyper-parameters and training data size and further enhances the effect.\nSpanBERT  extended the BERT by masking contiguous random spans rather than random tokens, and training the span boundary representations to predict the entire content of the masked span without relying on the individual token representations within it.\nMacBERT  improves upon RoBERTa in several ways, especially the masking strategy that adopts MLM as a correction (Mac). Recently, the language model of pre-training has also been explored in the context of KG.  learned context embeddings on entity-relational chains (sentences) generated by random walk in knowledge graph and initialized them as knowledge graph embedding models such as TransE . ERNIE  utilized knowledge graphs, which can enhance language representation with external knowledge to train an enhanced language representation model. COMET  used GPT to generate a given head phrase and a tail phrase tag of relation type in the knowledge base, which is not completely suitable for comparing the patterns of two entities with known relations. KG-BERT  used the MLM method for pre-training on the triple data to learn the corpus information of the knowledge graph scene. Unlike these studies, we use a multi-task pre-training strategy based on MLM, Mask Entity Model (MEM) and Mask Relation Model (MRM) so that the model can learn not only context corpus information but also learn the association information of triples at the semantic level.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: . Traditional word embedding methods, such as Word2Vec  and Glove , aimed to use feature-based methods to learn context semantic information and express words in the form of feature vectors. ELMo [ref]36 extends traditional word embedding to context-aware word embedding where polysemy can be properly handled.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
