      "content": "Paper Title: Fine-grained reductions around CFL-reachability\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nContext-free language (CFL) reachability is a framework for graph analysis which was introduced by Thomas Reps  and Mihalis Yannakakis  and allows one to specify path constraints in terms of context-free languages. CFL reachability finds application in such fields of research as static code analysis (e.g. type-based flow analysis  or points-to analysis  ), graph databases , bioinformatics . CFL reachability problem is formulated as follows. One is given context-free language ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} over finite alphabet ΣΣ\\Sigma and a directed graph D=(V,E,L)𝐷𝑉𝐸𝐿D=(V,E,L) which edges are labeled with the symbols from ΣΣ\\Sigma. It is needed to decide whether there exist a path between a pair of vertices in D𝐷D on which labels on the edges form a word from ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}. There exist two possible variations of a problem, where the question of defined above reachability is asked for a selected pair (s,t)𝑠𝑡(s,t) of vertices — s-t reachability, or for all pairs of them – all-pairs reachability. CFL reachability problem complexity is often measured by the number of vertices in the graph: n=|V|𝑛𝑉n=|V|, while the grammar is supposed to be fixed. There are several cubic   and slightly subcubic [ref]13 (with time 𝒪​(n3/p​o​l​y​(log⁡n))𝒪superscript𝑛3𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n^{3}/poly(\\log n))111Every logarithm in the paper is a logarithm with base 2.) algorithms for all-pairs CFL reachability, so the problem clearly lies in complexity class P. Fine-grained complexity theory studies the exact degree of the polynomial expressing the complexity of the problems. In respect to CFL reachability the big open question is whether a truly subcubic (with time 𝒪~​(n3−ϵ)~𝒪superscript𝑛3italic-ϵ\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{3-\\epsilon})222Here and throughout the paper 𝒪~~𝒪\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}} notation hides polylogarithmic factors, e.g. 𝒪~(n3−ϵ)=𝒪(n3−ϵ⋅poly(log(n))\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{3-\\epsilon})\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ =\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ \\mathcal{O}(n^{3-\\epsilon}\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ \\cdot\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ poly(\\log(n)).) algorithm exists. Another, equally interesting, question is whether the fine-grained complexity of s-t and all-pairs CFL reachability are the same. One of the ways to answer the question about an exact complexity of a problem is to find a lower bound. It is hard to create unconditional lower bound at most of the times. At the moment for the most of the problems there are known only trivial lower bounds based on the necessity to read all the input and produce all the output. As an example of a non-trivial lower bound one can see 𝒪​(n​log⁡n)𝒪𝑛𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n) lower bound for sorting algorithms based on comparisons, but this case is the exception rather than the rule. In fine-grained complexity the usual way to answer a question about an exact complexity of a problem is to create a conditional lower bound: the lower bound is true if some widely believed hypothesis is true. The most popular hypotheses in the field are stated for the SAT, 3SUM and APSP problems. Conditional lower bounds are achieved via a fine-grained reduction which shows how to convert an algorithm for problem A𝐴A into an algorithm for problem B𝐵B. In this case fast enough algorithm for A𝐴A can lead to breakthrough algorithm for B𝐵B which is not believed to exist.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: CFL reachability problem complexity is often measured by the number of vertices in the graph: n=|V|𝑛𝑉n=|V|, while the grammar is supposed to be fixed.
