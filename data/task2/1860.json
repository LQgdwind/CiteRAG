      "content": "Paper Title: Active learning for medical code assignment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExtraction of clinical information from unstructured data to support operational, clinical, and financial decision making is typically manually conducted based on heuristics and previous knowledge and expertise. This manual process leads to an inefficient way of delivering care to patients in the health system [ref]31. In this context, many researchers have been studying and applying various Machine Learning (ML) techniques to automatically extracting valuable insights from this unstructured data and extract diagnosis and procedure insights from clinical notes and images    . ML techniques performed well on various feature extraction, classification, and regression tasks   . One issue of the application of ML models is that they require a considerable amount of labeled and stratified training data to ensure robust learning, which is not always possible to obtain in the medical domain that usually lacks labeled datasets, contains rare events, and is difficult to access due to privacy [ref]18 1 . The lack of labeled data occurs because the annotation costs are high since domain experts are needed to manually label the data (like doctors, nurses, or health administrators). The interaction of an expert human in the learning process is known as human-in-the-loop machine learning (HILML), in which the expert interacts with the training process to enhance the information extraction and the optimization performance. This approach can reduce the exponential search in the functions space and feature selection [ref]18 . HILML techniques allow the expert to analyze and explore the data space and the features extracted based on the impact of changes in the prediction, identifying findings and insights that can support and improve the ML performance  2. In healthcare, a common HILML used is Active Learning (AL), which has been applied to clinical text data to reduce the annotation cost, i.e., selecting more relevant notes that require minor effort to be annotated     . AL is typically used when the training dataset is small due to the difficulty to label samples, requiring a human annotator along the learning process to improve the model  [ref]6  [ref]18 . Currently, Deep Learning models have been providing good results in the medical domain on clinical text. However, most studies involving AL with Deep Learning models have focused on image datasets, leaving the case of text as an open problem [ref]6    0. Thus, this research aims to evaluate the possibility of employing AL methods in the medical domain, focusing on coding assignment the clinical notes. Therefore, we focus on the application of the most common active learning methods in the clinical notes of MIMIC-III database under the discharge summaries category. In this scenario, the goal is automatically to assign the ICD-9 (the Ninth Revision of International Classification of Diseases) codes based on the content of the notes. It is worth mentioning that, due to the domain aspects, the data is imbalanced and follows a power-law distribution with respect to the number of samples that correspond to each class. Besides, the assignment of ICD-9 codes is a multi-label task, i.e., the sample can be associated with one or more labels or classes  . Such aspects motivate this research, because AL methods can select the most informative samples to be labeled, reducing the annotation cost, and provide a better data balance for the training set. Besides, AL can support data exploration and model interpretation, bringing information for the user about the model design and data that present uncertainty. In that sense, researchers in the visual analytics field are proposing methods that can support the interpretation of ML models in order to provide a better understanding of the data and model behavior, supporting an exploratory analysis [ref]6   . These tools can be combined with Active Learning models to facilitate the interaction of non-ML users with the system, improving the interpretability of AI/HIML systems in medicine.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: making is typically manually conducted based on heuristics and previous knowledge and expertise.
