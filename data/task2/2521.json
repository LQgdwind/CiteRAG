      "content": "Paper Title: NASOA: Towards Faster Task-oriented Online Fine-tuning with a Zoo of Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe commonly used hand-craft backbones for fine-tuning including MobileNet\n, ResNet [ref]21, and ResNeXt\n[ref]54. Recently, some state-of-the-art backbone\nseries such as RegNet [ref]40, and EfficientNet\n are developed by automated algorithms\nfor higher accuracy and faster inference speed. However, the objective\nof our NAS is to find a group of models with good model generalization\nability and training speed. Suggested by ,\nthe model fine-tuning accuracy (model generalization ability) has\na strong correlation between ImageNet accuracy (r=0.96𝑟0.96r=0.96). Meanwhile,\nthe training speed can be measured by the step time of each training\niteration. Thus, our NAS can be formulated by a multi-objective optimization\nproblem (MOOP) on the search space S𝑆S given by: where 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is the architecture, acc(.)\\mathrm{acc}(.) is the\nTop-1 accuracy on ImageNet, Ts(.)T_{s}(.) is the average step time of\none iteration, and Tmsubscript𝑇𝑚T_{m} is the maximum step time allowed. The\nstep time is defined to be the total time of one iteration, including\nforward/backward propagation, and parameter update. Search Space Design is extremely important [ref]40.\nAs shown in Figure 2, we propose a novel flexible\njoint block-level and macro-level search space to enable simple to\ncomplex block design and fine adjustment of the computation allocation\non each stage. Unlike existing topological cell-level search space\nsuch as DARTS , AmoebaNet, and\nNASBench101, ours is more compact and avoids\nredundant skip-connections which have great memory access cost (MAC).\nOur block-level search space is more flexible to adjust the width,\ndepth (for each stage), when to down-sample/raise the channels. In\ncontrast, EfficientNet only scales up/down the total width and depth\nby a fixed allocation ratio, and RegNet cannot change the number/type\nof operations in each block. Block-level Search Space. We consider a search space based\non 1-3 successive nodes of 5 different operations. Three skip connections\nwith one fixed residual connection are searched. Element-wise add\nor channel-wise concat is chosen to combine the features for the skip-connections.\nFor each selected operation, we also search for the ratio of changing\nchannel size: ×0.25absent0.25\\times 0.25, ×0.5absent0.5\\times 0.5, ×1absent1\\times 1, ×2absent2\\times 2,\n×4absent4\\times 4. Note that it can cover many popular block designs such\nas Bottleneck [ref]21, ResNeXt [ref]54\nand MB block . It consists of 5.4×1065.4superscript1065.4\\times 10^{6}\nunique blocks. Macro-level Search Space. Allocation computation over different\nstages is crucial for a backbone . Early-stage\nfeature maps in one backbone are larger which captures texture details,\nwhile late-stage feature maps are smaller which are more discriminative\n. Therefore, for macro-level search space, we design\na flexible search space to find the optimal channel size (width),\ndepth (total number of blocks), when to down-sample, and when to raise\nthe channels. Our macro-level structure consists of 4 flexible stages.\nThe spatial size of the stages is gradually down-sampled with factor\n2. In each stage, we stack a number of block architectures. The positions\nof the doubling channel block are also flexible. This search space\nconsists of 1.5×1071.5superscript1071.5\\times 10^{7} unique architectures. Multi-objective Searching Algorithm. For MOOP in Eq 1,\nwe define architecture 𝒜1subscript𝒜1\\mathcal{A}_{1} dominates 𝒜2subscript𝒜2\\mathcal{A}_{2}\nif (i) 𝒜1subscript𝒜1\\mathcal{A}_{1} is no worse than 𝒜2subscript𝒜2\\mathcal{A}_{2} in all\nobjectives; (ii) 𝒜1subscript𝒜1\\mathcal{A}_{1} is strictly better than 𝒜2subscript𝒜2\\mathcal{A}_{2}\nin at least one objective. 𝒜∗superscript𝒜\\mathcal{A}^{*} is Pareto optimal\nif there is no other 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} that dominate 𝒜∗superscript𝒜\\mathcal{A}^{*}.\nThe set of all Pareto optimal architectures constitutes the\nPareto front. To solve this MOOP problem, we modify a well-known\nmethod named Elitist Non-Dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II)\n to optimize the Pareto front 𝒫fsubscript𝒫𝑓\\mathcal{P}_{f}\n. The main idea of NSGA-II is to rank the sampled architectures\nby non-dominated sorting and preserve a group of elite architectures.\nThen a group of new architectures is sampled and trained by mutation\nof the current elite architectures on the 𝒫fsubscript𝒫𝑓\\mathcal{P}_{f} . The\nalgorithm can be paralleled on multiple computation nodes and lift\nthe 𝒫fsubscript𝒫𝑓\\mathcal{P}_{f} simultaneously. We modify the NSGA-II algorithm\nto become a NAS algorithm: a) To enable parallel searching on N computational\nnodes, we modify the non-dominated-sort method to generate exactly\nN mutated models for each generation, instead of a variable size as\nthe original NSGA-II does. b) We define a group of mutation operations\nfor our block/macro search space for NSGA-II to change the network\nstructure dynamically. c) We add a parent computation node to measure\nthe selected architecture’s training speed and generate the 𝒫fsubscript𝒫𝑓\\mathcal{P}_{f}\n. Efficient Training Model Zoo Zo​osubscript𝑍𝑜𝑜Z_{oo} (ET-NAS). By the proposed\nNAS method, we then create an efficient-training model zoo Zo​osubscript𝑍𝑜𝑜Z_{oo}\nnamed ET-NAS which consists of K𝐾K Pareto optimal\nmodels 𝒜i∗superscriptsubscript𝒜𝑖\\mathcal{A}_{i}^{*} on 𝒫fsubscript𝒫𝑓\\mathcal{P}_{f}. 𝒜i∗superscriptsubscript𝒜𝑖\\mathcal{A}_{i}^{*}\nare pretrained by ImageNet. Details of the search space, its encoding,\nNSGA-II algorithm and 𝒜i∗superscriptsubscript𝒜𝑖\\mathcal{A}_{i}^{*} architectures can be\nfound in Appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: The commonly used hand-craft backbones for fine-tuning including MobileNet\n, ResNet [ref]21, and ResNeXt\n[ref]54.
