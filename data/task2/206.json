      "content": "Paper Title: GPU-Accelerated Computation of Vietoris-Rips Persistence Barcodes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTopological data analysis (TDA)  is an emerging field in the era of big data, which has a strong mathematical foundation. As one of the core tools of TDA, persistent homology seeks to find topological or qualitative features of data (usually represented by a finite metric space). It has many applications, such as in neural networks , sensor networks , bioinformatics , deep learning , manifold learning [ref]43, and neuroscience . One of the most popular and useful topological signatures persistent homology can compute are Vietoris-Rips barcodes. There are two challenges to Vietoris-Rips barcode computation. The first one is its highly computing- and memory-intensive nature in part due to the exponentially growing number of simplices it must process. The second one is its irregular computation patterns with high dependencies such as its matrix reduction step . Therefore, sequential computation is still the norm in computing persistent homology. There are several CPU-based software packages in sequential mode for computing persistent homology   [ref]33  [ref]5. Ripser  [ref]5  is a representative and computationally efficient software specifically designed to compute Vietoris-Rips barcodes, achieving state of the art performance   by using effective and mathematically based algorithmic optimizations. The usage of hardware accelerators like GPU is inevitable for computation in many areas. To continue advancing the computational geometry field, we must include hardware-aware algorithmic efforts. The ending of Moore’s law  and the termination of Dennard scaling  technically limits the performance improvement of general-purpose CPUs . The computing ecosystem is rapidly evolving from conventional CPU computing to a new disruptive accelerated computing environment where hardware accelerators such as GPUs play the main roles of computation for performance improvement. Our goal in this work is to develop GPU-accelerated computation for Vietoris-Rips barcodes, not only significantly improving the performance, but also to lead a new direction in computing for topological data analysis. We identify two major computational components for computing Vietoris-Rips barcodes, namely filtration construction with clearing and matrix reduction. We look into the underlying mathematical and empirical properties tied to the hidden massive parallelism and data locality of these computations. Having laid mathematical foundations, we develop efficient parallel algorithms for each component, and put them together to create a computational software. Our contributions presented in this paper are as follows: 1. We introduce and prove the Apparent Pairs Lemma for Vietoris-Rips barcode computation. It has a natural algorithmic connection to the GPU. We furthermore prove theoretical bounds on the number of so-called ”apparent pairs.” 2. We design and implement hardware-aware massively parallel algorithms that accelerate the two major computation components of Vietoris-Rips barcodes as well as a data structure for persistence pairs for matrix reduction. 3. We perform extensive experiments justifying our algorithms’ computational effectiveness as well as dissecting the nature of Vietoris-Rips barcode computation, including looking into the expected number of apparent pairs as a function of the number of points. 4. We achieve up to 30x speedup over the original Ripser software; surprisingly, up to 2.0x CPU memory efficiency and requires, at best, 60% of the CPU memory used by Ripser on the GPU device memory. 5. Ripser++ is an open source software in the public domain to serve the TDA community and relevant application areas. here are four challenges to developing Ripser++: There is still little that we know about the empirical properties of persistent homology computation. It was discovered in [Zhang] that the matrix reduction component of persistent homology computation is highly irregular, heavily depending on the filtration type and without a general solution for all datasets. This was one of the motivations to atleast partially solve the problem by restricting to Vietoris-Rips filtrations. The GPU executes in a SIMD fashion in units of ”warps” of 32 threads. It is very nonintuitive to parallelize a completely sequential algorithm into a SIMD-parallel execution pattern. Furthermore, according to our experiments, Ripser is state of the art in Vietoris-Rips barcodes computation. Improving upon state of the art is a difficult task and doing so with the (still improving) device memory restrictions and the necessity to contribute SIMD parallelism on top of Ripser brings about added pressure. We are one of very few research that has introduced parallelism to persistent homology computation. The available literature is very sparse and can be overly theoretical. Unfortunately beautiful theory does not necessarily translate into high performance in practice.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: features of data (usually represented by a finite metric space).
