      "content": "Paper Title: Trust Your Robots! Predictive Uncertainty Estimation of Neural Networks with Sparse Gaussian Processes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFigure 1 visualizes our approach. The proposed predictive model uses an existing, and already well-trained DNN for accurate predictions. At the same time, the method offers the possibility to obtain the predictors’ reliable uncertainty in a closed form solution, using a DNN-based MoE-GPs. Intuitively, we can linearize and transform DNNs around a mode to obtain a linear model. As any linear models are GP regressors from a function space view, we can get a GP-based representation of DNNs with a DNN-based kernel, the NTK. We describe below how the obtained GPs can estimate the uncertainty of DNNs, but cannot replace the DNN predictions. Moreover, as full GPs do not scale to big data, we choose to use MoE-GPs, which divides the data into smaller subsets and form many smaller GPs per these subsets. This results in the proposed combination of DNNs and sparse GPs. Fundamentals First, we introduce our notation. Considering a supervised learning task on input-output pairs 𝒟={𝒳,𝒴}={(𝒙i,𝒚i)}i=1N𝒟matrix𝒳𝒴superscriptsubscriptmatrixsubscript𝒙𝑖subscript𝒚𝑖𝑖1𝑁\\mathcal{D}=\\begin{Bmatrix}\\mathcal{X},\\mathcal{Y}\\end{Bmatrix}=\\begin{Bmatrix}({\\bm{x}}_{i},{\\bm{y}}_{i})\\end{Bmatrix}_{i=1}^{N}, where 𝒙i∈ℝDsubscript𝒙𝑖superscriptℝ𝐷{\\bm{x}}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D}, 𝒚i∈ℝKsubscript𝒚𝑖superscriptℝ𝐾{\\bm{y}}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K}, we describe a DNN as a parametrized function f𝜽:ℝD→ℝK:subscript𝑓𝜽→superscriptℝ𝐷superscriptℝ𝐾f_{\\bm{\\theta}}:\\mathbb{R}^{D}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{K} , where 𝜽∈ℝP𝜽superscriptℝ𝑃\\bm{\\theta}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{P}. Here, learning typically seeks to obtain an empirical risk minimizer of the loss function, i.e. min𝜽1|𝒟|​∑(𝒙,𝒚)∈𝒟ℒ​(f𝜽​(𝒙),𝒚)+δ2​𝜽T​𝜽subscript𝜽1𝒟subscript𝒙𝒚𝒟ℒsubscript𝑓𝜽𝒙𝒚𝛿2superscript𝜽𝑇𝜽\\min_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\quad\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{D}|}\\sum_{({\\bm{x}},{\\bm{y}})\\in\\mathcal{D}}\\mathcal{L}(f_{\\bm{\\theta}}({\\bm{x}}),{\\bm{y}})+\\frac{\\delta}{2}\\bm{\\theta}^{T}\\bm{\\theta} where δ𝛿\\delta is an L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}-regularizer, and mini-batches ℬ⊂𝒟ℬ𝒟\\mathcal{B}\\subset\\mathcal{D} are used to find a local maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) solution 𝜽^bold-^𝜽{\\bm{\\hat{\\theta}}}. We assume a twice differentiable and strictly convex loss function ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}, e.g. mean squared error (MSE), and piece-wise linear activations in f𝜽subscript𝑓𝜽f_{\\bm{\\theta}} (e.g. RELU). For a clear exposition, we drop the indices i𝑖i. To set the scene for the paper, the Neural Linear Models (NLMs) [ref]27    are defined, which can estimate a DNNs’ predictive uncertainty. To do so, consider a transformed dataset 𝒟~={𝒳,𝒴~}~𝒟𝒳~𝒴\\widetilde{\\mathcal{D}}=\\left\\{\\mathcal{X},\\widetilde{\\mathcal{Y}}\\right\\} with the pseudo-output 𝒚~:=𝑱𝒇​(𝒙)​𝜽^−𝑯𝓛​(𝒙,𝒚)−1​𝑹𝓛​(𝒙,𝒚)assign~𝒚subscript𝑱𝒇𝒙bold-^𝜽subscript𝑯𝓛superscript𝒙𝒚1subscript𝑹𝓛𝒙𝒚\\widetilde{{\\bm{y}}}:={\\bm{J_{f}}}({\\bm{x}}){\\bm{\\hat{\\theta}}}-{\\bm{H_{\\mathcal{L}}}}({\\bm{x}},{\\bm{y}})^{-1}\\bm{R_{\\mathcal{L}}}({\\bm{x}},{\\bm{y}}). This transformation uses the model derivatives of the underlying DNN around 𝜽^bold-^𝜽{\\bm{\\hat{\\theta}}}, namely the Jacobian 𝑱𝒇​(𝒙):=∂f𝜽​(𝒙)/∂𝜽T∈ℝK×Passignsubscript𝑱𝒇𝒙subscript𝑓𝜽𝒙superscript𝜽𝑇superscriptℝ𝐾𝑃{\\bm{J_{f}}}({\\bm{x}}):=\\partial f_{\\bm{\\theta}}({\\bm{x}})/{\\partial\\bm{\\theta}^{T}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times P}, the Hessian 𝑯𝓛​(𝒙,𝒚):=∂2ℒ​(f𝜽​(𝒙),𝒚)/∂f𝜽​(𝒙)T​∂f𝜽​(𝒙)∈ℝK×Kassignsubscript𝑯𝓛𝒙𝒚superscript2ℒsubscript𝑓𝜽𝒙𝒚subscript𝑓𝜽superscript𝒙𝑇subscript𝑓𝜽𝒙superscriptℝ𝐾𝐾{\\bm{H_{\\mathcal{L}}}}({\\bm{x}},{\\bm{y}}):={\\partial^{2}\\mathcal{L}(f_{\\bm{\\theta}}({\\bm{x}}),{\\bm{y}})}/{\\partial f_{\\bm{\\theta}}({\\bm{x}})^{T}\\partial f_{\\bm{\\theta}}({\\bm{x}})}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times K} and the residuals 𝑹𝓛​(𝒙,𝒚):=∂ℒ​(f𝜽​(𝒙),𝒚)/∂f𝜽​(𝒙)∈ℝKassignsubscript𝑹𝓛𝒙𝒚ℒsubscript𝑓𝜽𝒙𝒚subscript𝑓𝜽𝒙superscriptℝ𝐾\\bm{R_{\\mathcal{L}}}({\\bm{x}},{\\bm{y}}):={\\partial\\mathcal{L}(f_{\\bm{\\theta}}({\\bm{x}}),{\\bm{y}})}/{\\partial f_{\\bm{\\theta}}({\\bm{x}})}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K}. Assuming a white noise and an uninformative prior, the NLMs are: The NLMs can be thought as a Bayesian linear model with learned features from a DNN, which is obtained via a linearization around the DNNs’ last layer [ref]27. Thus, the isotropic prior is governed by the parameter δ𝛿\\delta that corresponds to the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} regularizer  while the white noise is governed by the term 𝑯𝓛−1​𝑹𝓛superscriptsubscript𝑯𝓛1subscript𝑹𝓛{\\bm{H_{\\mathcal{L}}}}^{-1}\\bm{R_{\\mathcal{L}}} in the described data transformation, given that the DNN fit the train data well, e.g. 𝑹𝓛≈0subscript𝑹𝓛0\\bm{R_{\\mathcal{L}}}\\approx 0. The term 𝑯𝓛subscript𝑯𝓛{\\bm{H_{\\mathcal{L}}}} is independent of the input if the 2nd derivative of a loss is a constant, e.g. MSE. Moreover, for commonly used loss functions such as cross entropy and MSE, the covariance 𝚺𝚺\\bm{\\Sigma} of DNN predictions f𝜽subscript𝑓𝜽f_{\\bm{\\theta}} is equal to that of the NLMs’ 𝒚~~𝒚\\widetilde{{\\bm{y}}} [ref]27 . This means that for the same input 𝒙𝒙{\\bm{x}}, the NLMs can estimate the predictive uncertainty of DNNs. Yet, 𝒚~~𝒚\\widetilde{{\\bm{y}}} cannot be used to replace f𝜽subscript𝑓𝜽f_{\\bm{\\theta}}, due to their differences in f𝜽subscript𝑓𝜽f_{\\bm{\\theta}} and 𝒚~~𝒚\\widetilde{{\\bm{y}}}. In the Appendix, we provide concrete examples and their derivations. Main idea Let’s now apply a kernel trick 8 to the NLMs, so that we can obtain an effective combination of DNNs with GPs. To explain, we can further map the NLM to a function space, as opposed to working in the weight space. Doing so, a well known function space formulation of linear models 8 turns the NLM into a GP with the kernel 𝑲=1δ​𝑱𝒇​(𝒙)T​𝑱𝒇​(𝒙)𝑲1𝛿subscript𝑱𝒇superscript𝒙𝑇subscript𝑱𝒇𝒙{\\bm{K}}=\\frac{1}{\\delta}{\\bm{J_{f}}}({\\bm{x}})^{T}{\\bm{J_{f}}}({\\bm{x}}), which is also known as the Network Tangent Kernel (NTK). Thus, GPs with NTK can be used to estimate the predictive uncertainty of DNNs, as their equivalent NLMs can. Here, what motivates the formulation is the idea of deep kernel machines , i.e. we learn the kernel representations as oppose to hand designing the features and the kernels, and in our case, the kernel representations are the tangents of DNNs’ Jacobians. Importantly, doing so, we get a training-free combination of DNNs with GPs, as we keep DNN predictions the same as the MAP, while estimating their uncertainty using GPs with NTK. Unfortunately, such combinations of DNNs with GPs are restricted by a prominent weakness of standard GPs : the cubic time complexity 𝒪​(N3)𝒪superscript𝑁3\\mathcal{O}(N^{3}) that grows with the dataset size N𝑁N. So, the computational costs are prohibitive for large scale problems that DNNs assume (typically referred to N>10000𝑁10000N>10000 in  8). While we leave the theoretic motivation to section 3.2, we thus propose MoE-GPs with NTK, in order to advance the scalability of the proposed combination. A MoE-GP consists of M𝑀M experts of GPs or learners ℱ={f~GP1,⋯,f~GPM}ℱsubscript~𝑓subscriptGP1⋯subscript~𝑓subscriptGP𝑀\\mathcal{F}=\\left\\{\\widetilde{f}_{\\mathrm{GP}_{1}},\\cdots,\\widetilde{f}_{\\mathrm{GP}_{M}}\\right\\}, and a gating function g:ℝD→ΔM−1:𝑔→superscriptℝ𝐷superscriptΔ𝑀1g:\\mathbb{R}^{D}\\to\\Delta^{M-1} that maps any input 𝒙𝒙{\\bm{x}} to g​(𝒙)=[g1​(𝒙),⋯,gM​(𝒙)]𝑔𝒙subscript𝑔1𝒙⋯subscript𝑔𝑀𝒙g({\\bm{x}})=[g_{1}({\\bm{x}}),\\cdots,g_{M}({\\bm{x}})]  . Each expert of the MoE learns and predicts within a subset of the input domain, and a gating function generates these subsets. Specifically, we choose a gating function gm​(𝒙)=1subscript𝑔𝑚𝒙1g_{m}({\\bm{x}})=1 in just one coordinate for each input . Such strict partition enables the use of a local model for each input , avoiding the combinations of multiple predictions of a model for each input, e.g. model averaging as in Meier et al. . The subscripts m=1,2,…,M𝑚12…𝑀m=1,2,...,M denote the mthth{}^{\\text{th}} expert throughout the paper. Then, we write a MoE-GP as, As depicted in figure 1, the gating function gm​(𝒙)subscript𝑔𝑚𝒙g_{m}({\\bm{x}}) assigns the input data 𝒙𝒙{\\bm{x}} to the mthsuperscript𝑚thm^{\\text{th}} subset, and individual GPs f~GPm​(𝒙)subscript~𝑓subscriptGP𝑚𝒙\\widetilde{f}_{\\mathrm{GP}_{m}}({\\bm{x}}) learn and make predictions for the assigned data within the mthsuperscript𝑚thm^{\\text{th}} subset. Consequently, the generative model and the predictions 𝒩​(𝐲~m∗,𝚺m​(𝒙∗))𝒩superscriptsubscript~𝐲𝑚subscript𝚺𝑚superscript𝒙\\mathcal{N}(\\widetilde{{\\mathbf{y}}}_{m}^{*},\\bm{\\Sigma}_{m}({\\bm{x}}^{*})) on the new test datum 𝒙∗superscript𝒙{\\bm{x}}^{*} are: where, 𝑲m=𝑲m​(𝒳,𝒳)subscript𝑲𝑚subscript𝑲𝑚𝒳𝒳{\\bm{K}}_{m}={\\bm{K}}_{m}(\\mathcal{X},\\mathcal{X}), 𝒌m,∗=𝒌m​(𝒳,𝒙∗)subscript𝒌𝑚subscript𝒌𝑚𝒳superscript𝒙{\\bm{k}}_{m,*}={\\bm{k}}_{m}(\\mathcal{X},{\\bm{x}}^{*}) and 𝒌m,∗∗=𝒌m​(𝒙∗,𝒙∗)subscript𝒌𝑚absentsubscript𝒌𝑚superscript𝒙superscript𝒙{\\bm{k}}_{m,**}={\\bm{k}}_{m}({\\bm{x}}^{*},{\\bm{x}}^{*}). This posterior predictive distribution 𝚺msubscript𝚺𝑚\\bm{\\Sigma}_{m} is an indicator of total uncertainty, i.e. the kernel function captures the model uncertainty while the constant term σ0,m​𝑰subscript𝜎0𝑚𝑰\\mathrm{\\sigma}_{0,m}{\\bm{I}} corresponds to the aleatoric uncertainty . In GPs, as we do not have access to exact function values, the aleatoric uncertainty often relies on the assumption of additive i.i.d white noise, and in MoE-GPs, the terms σ0,m​𝑰subscript𝜎0𝑚𝑰\\mathrm{\\sigma}_{0,m}{\\bm{I}} are inferred from the data per subset, leading to a non-stationary kernel. This is achieved by optimizing the marginal likelihood 8. The benefits of the MoE-GP formulation are two-folds. First, as shown above, the generative model of a GP is defined per subset, and therefore, the GP experts are smaller than the one on the entire dataset. This improves the computational complexity of GPs . Second, the covariance computations are in a closed form. Thus, we neither need sampling nor ensemble  . Using the Lanczos approximation 4, which approximates the matrix inversion with the multiplications (suited for GPUs), we can compute the uncertainty estimates from GPs, with a constant time complexity 4. For classification, we leverage the framework of Lu et al. 5, which can perform classification with the regression models via confidence calibration [ref]5. While we refer to Lu et al. 5 for the details, this steps enables us to obtain the classification uncertainty in closed form, i.e, for a class c𝑐c: where 𝒛msubscript𝒛𝑚{\\bm{z}}_{m} is the activation, Tmsubscript𝑇𝑚T_{m} is the temperature scaling factor, which is a function of a scaling constant λm,0subscript𝜆𝑚0\\lambda_{m,0}, and GP regression uncertainty 𝚺m​(𝒙∗)subscript𝚺𝑚superscript𝒙\\bm{\\Sigma}_{m}({\\bm{x}}^{*}). Intuitively, high prediction uncertainty will reduce the corresponding p​(c|𝒛m)𝑝conditional𝑐subscript𝒛𝑚p(c|{\\bm{z}}_{m}) by increasing the Tmsubscript𝑇𝑚T_{m}, thereby calibrating the confidences [ref]5 6 5.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: (MSE), and piece-wise linear activations in f𝜽subscript𝑓𝜽f_{\\bm{\\theta}} (e.g. RELU).
