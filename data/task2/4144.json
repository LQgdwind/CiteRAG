      "content": "Paper Title: Stability and Generalization of Stochastic Optimization with Nonconvex and Nonsmooth Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we review the related work on generalization analysis. We will focus on two approach: the algorithmic stability approach and the uniform convergence approach. Algorithmic Stability. We first review the related work on algorithmic stability. Algorithmic stability is a fundamental concept in SLT to measure the sensitivity of an algorithm up to a perturbation of the training dataset, which is closely related to learnability  [ref]49. There are various algorithmic stability concepts. Some stability concepts measure the sensitivity in terms of function values, e.g., uniform stability [ref]6, hypothesis stability [ref]6 , Bayes stability  and on-average stability  , while others measure the sensitivity in terms of output models, e.g., argument stability  and on-average argument stability . A most widely used stability concept is the uniform stability [ref]6, which can imply almost optimal generalization bounds with high probability   . Second moment bounds of generalization error for uniformly stable algorithms were developed [ref]6, and improved recently by considering a “leave-one-out” estimate . The celebrated connection between stability and generalization motivates the discussion of stability for many specific algorithms, including regularization algorithms [ref]6 , stochastic optimization algorithms  0   , iterative hard thresholding , structured prediction , meta learning  and transfer learning . In particular, the influential work gives the first stability analysis of SGD applied to convex and smooth problems . The smoothness assumption is removed in the recent study  [ref]3, and a tight lower bound on the stability of SGD was developed [ref]3. Stability analysis can be also used to study the convergence of optimization error for multi-epoch SGD . Uniform Convergence. Machine learning models may achieve good performance on the training dataset but bad generalization behavior, which motivates the generalization analysis by the uniform convergence approach to study the difference between training and testing over the whole hypothesis space. Initially, the uniform convergence was mainly studied in terms of function values , which, however, is not appropriate to stochastic optimization with nonconvex loss functions. The underlying reason is that an algorithm can only guarantee to find a local minimizer (one cannot get convergence rate of training errors to the that of the best model). Then, the uniform convergence of function values  fail to show the convergence of testing errors to that of the best model. Instead, one has to turn to other performance measures such as the gradients of risks for smooth problems 1 and the gradients of Moreau envelope for weakly convex problems 1. In particular, Ghadimi and Lan 1 gave the first nonasymptotical convergence rate of the gradient norm. Motivated by this observation, the uniform convergence for gradients have been recently studied  0  2. The work  initialized the discussion on the uniform convergence of gradients by characterizing the complexity of function spaces with covering numbers, which was extended to the uniform convergence in terms of Rademacher complexities 0. These discussions are devoted to control the uniform deviation between gradients of empirical and population risks under a smoothness condition. For nonsmooth problems, the gradients are not well defined since the functions may not be differentiable. This problem was recently addressed by considering the gradients of Moreau envelope of empirical/population risks 2, which are appropriate stationary measures for weakly convex problems. Specifically, the uniform deviation of gradients for the Moreau envelope between empirical and population risks was studied based on covering numbers 2. Other than the above two approaches, there are also interesting discussions on generalization analysis by using tools in integral operators  2   and information theory    .\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: stability.
