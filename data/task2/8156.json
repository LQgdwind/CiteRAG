      "content": "Paper Title: WISDOM: An AI-powered framework for emerging research detection using weak signal analysis and advanced topic modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe rise of globalization and increasing competition has sparked a growing research interest in emerging technologies. In recent years, the number of publications centred around emerging technologies has been increasing . Emerging technologies have not only been debated in academic research, but they have also been a central topic in policy discussions and initiatives . However, diverse interpretations of what constitutes “emerging technologies” exist, with certain definitions converging on common aspects while also highlighting varying dimensions and characteristics of this phenomenon. For instance, some definitions underscore the potential socio-economic impact that emerging technologies can wield (e.g., ). Conversely, other definitions place significant emphasis on the uncertainty inherent in the emergence process (e.g., ) or on the distinctive attributes of novelty and growth (e.g., ). In an important and comprehensive study, Rotolo et al.  defined emerging technologies by five key attributes: radical novelty, fast growth, coherence, significant impact, and a degree of uncertainty and ambiguity. In particular, they identify an emerging technology as a technology that is profoundly innovative and exhibits relatively rapid growth. It is also marked by a certain level of consistency over time and possesses the potential to significantly influence socio-economic domains. However, its most notable impact is anticipated to occur in the future, and during the emergence phase, where there remains an element of uncertainty and ambiguity . In a broader definition,  tagged emerging technologies as those that have not gained widespread acceptance but are anticipated to have a significant impact on most organizations in the near future. The understanding of emerging technologies is also dependent on the viewpoint of the analyst/domain expert , and their project objectives. One expert might perceive technology as emerging due to its novelty and anticipated impact on society and the economy, while others might view the same technology as an extension of an already-existing one . This lack of consensus over definitions and the variety of perspectives has led to the development of different methodological approaches to detect and analyze emerging technologies. In addition, the absence of comprehensive and accurate historical data on emerging technologies makes the forecasting of these technologies a very challenging task . Scientometrics studies, favoring quantitative indicators and employing various data sources such as patents and publications, have been the most common approach for identifying emerging technologies . For example,  applied bibliometrics and proposed a method to monitor and extract insight into emerging technologies from public electronic databases. Lee  employed co-word analysis and scientometric indicators to uncover emerging research themes within the realm of information security, analyzing patterns and trends in the field. As another example, in , using the notion of core documents and cross-citations, authors proposed a bibliometric method for detecting emerging topics. In 2012,  conducted an examination of the interconnections among various data sources and proposed a scientometric model aimed at monitoring the emergence of novel technologies. In a more recent study,  employed bibliometric techniques to investigate emerging technologies in cancer research, focusing on specific types of cancer, i.e., breast and prostate cancers. Due to a lack of consensus in definitions, it is not surprising that these methods for detecting and analyzing emergence often exhibit substantial disparities, even when employing identical or similar techniques . Digital technologies have enhanced the accessibility of massive data, with several science and technology databases available catering to various fields of innovation in which data is continuously increasing in terms of size and variety . On the other hand, the existence of advanced computer science algorithms opens up new possibilities for acquiring more profound insights from a diverse set of digital databases . In , authors employed dynamic topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning technique, to detect and explore the thematic patterns and emerging directions within scientific publications in the field of scientometrics. Ebadi et al.  utilized NLP techniques and dynamic topic modeling to analyze the hypersonics research landscape and its temporal evolution. In another study and using patent data , a quantitative forward-looking approach was proposed for identifying technological opportunities that anticipated potential flows of technological knowledge between heterogeneous domains. In a study conducted in 2019 , authors built and combined multiple machine learning models and introduced a framework aimed at identifying and anticipating emerging research themes at a thematic level. Using various data sources of diverse types, in , a system was introduced that relied on natural language processing (NLP) for identifying weak signals and automatically categorizing the identified keywords. And, using deep learning and weak signal analysis, in , a multi-layered approach was proposed to detect emerging technologies signals from scientific publications. In addition to the variety observed in the literature in terms of definitions and methods, conventional approaches employed for identifying emerging technologies have certain constraints. These include relying on simple indicators, necessitating extensive manual involvement, and introducing subjectivity due to heavy reliance on domain expert input at the outset . Apart from subjectivity, although expert knowledge is a valuable source of information, they may not be aware of emerging technologies outside their specific domain or may overlook innovations they are not familiar with. Moreover, expert insights are often qualitative and challenging to quantify. This can make it difficult to compare and prioritize emerging technologies objectively. Motivated by the recent advances in the field of AI and to address the above-mentioned limitations, in this work, we introduce WISDOM, an automated framework empowered by artificial intelligence, designed to detect emerging research themes through advanced topic modeling and weak signal analysis. In a similar work, Park and Kim  employed structural topic modeling (STM)  and weak signal analysis to statistically analyze the temporal shifts in renewable energy topics using publications from 2010 to 2019, and investigated the characteristics of the extracted topics. WISDOM enhances their approach in at least two significant ways: 1) WISDOM utilizes BERTopic [ref]8, which presents several advantages over STM. BERTopic harnesses pre-trained large language models for language comprehension, enabling it to capture more nuanced semantic relationships and context compared to STM. Furthermore, BERTopic generates representative keywords and document embeddings, resulting in more interpretable topics that facilitate easier understanding and interpretation. And, in addition to depicting shifts in topics over time, the BERTopic model also provides information on time-specific topic representations, enhancing our comprehension of the field’s evolution. 2) WISDOM employs an automatic topic labeling engine, which not only enhances the performance and efficiency of the framework but also eliminates the need for manual intervention, thereby automating the pipeline and ensuring objectivity. WISDOM serves as a valuable tool for aiding strategic planners and domain experts in the more efficient recognition and monitoring of trends related to emerging topics while enhancing the effectiveness and objectivity of the detection process.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: using publications from 2010 to 2019, and investigated the characteristics of the extracted topics.
