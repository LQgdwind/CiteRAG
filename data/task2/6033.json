      "content": "Paper Title: Data-driven Knowledge Fusion for Deep Multi-instance Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMIL was originally developed for predicting drug activity , which involves determining whether a bag of molecules (instances) contains those that can be used to make drugs.\nThe difficulty of this problem is that bag-level labels are provided, whereas instance-level labels are either unavailable or nonexistent.\nThis makes MIL a typical weakly supervised problem since the scarcity of labeled bags compared to the abundance of unlabeled instances. Obviously, not all of these data hold equal importance for the classification process, just as not all molecules can be used to make drugs.\nFrom a MIL research standpoint, certain key samples can be seen as intrinsic features of the data set, such as bags occupying vital positions in the data space and instances that play a crucial role in determining the label of the bag.\nFor example, BAMIC [ref]25 and miVLAD [ref]22 approach the MIL problem from different angles by selecting key samples from the cluster centers of the bag space and instance space, respectively, using these samples to simplify the problem through the creation of mapping functions.\nMILIS  offers a distinctive solution that leverages an iterative optimization technique to pinpoint and remove instances that either do not affect the bag label or have a minimal impact on it.\nConversely,  uses a top-kùëòk strategy to pick a certain number of instances that possess a higher likelihood of affecting the bag label.\nMILDM  and ELDB  take into account the distribution of label space when selecting key samples, aimed at improving the interpretability and accuracy of the model‚Äôs classification results. Simultaneously,   [ref]30 performed initial exploration to showcase the effectiveness of applying neural networks to MIL.\n‚ÄùSince then, numerous outstanding deep MIL algorithms have been proposed.\nMI-Net  employs deep supervision and residual connections to establish two efficient and scalable network structures.\nABMIL  proposes two attention strategies for solving the MIL problem by representing the bag label as a fully neural network parameterized Bernoulli distribution.\nLAMIL  introduces a loss function based on the attention mechanism that leverages the consistency cost to improve the generalization capability of the model.\nDSMIL  presents a novel MIL aggregator to capture the instance relationships within a bag and uses self-supervised contrastive learning to obtain strong representations of the bags.\nMAMIL  considers the neighboring instances of each instance in a bag to handle various types of instances and produce a diverse feature representation for the bag.\nHMIL  achieves better results with smaller data sets and improves generalization by exploiting the correlation among instances over different hierarchies. The above methods offer many valuable lessons, such as the acquisition of key samples and the application of attention mechanisms.\nNaturally, we aim to go beyond simply using using them as small modules in our methods or as comparison algorithms in experiments.\nIn reality, our goal is to extract the valuable knowledge contained in [ref]25  [ref]22 , with the intention of aiding the training of the model.\nAs a result, the data-driven knowledge fusion and the two-level attention mechanism are designed to mimic this process.\nMore details about these techniques will be provided in the next section.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: be seen as intrinsic features of the data set, such as bags occupying vital positions in the data space and instances that play a crucial role in determining the label of the bag.\nFor example, BAMIC [ref]25 and miVLAD [ref]22 approach the MIL problem from different angles by selecting key samples from the cluster centers of the bag space and instance space, respectively, using these samples to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
