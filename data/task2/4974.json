Some proposals use packet loss as a signal for network congestion, e.g., Cubic , Reno , and NewReno [ref]6; while others rely on the variation of delay, e.g., Vegas , or combine packet loss and delay  . Different CC techniques specialized for datacenter networks are also proposed  [ref]27. Researchers have also investigated the use of machine learning to construct better heuristics. Indigo  and Remy  use offline learning to obtain high-performance CC algorithms. PCC  and PCC Vivace  opt for online learning to avoid any hardwired mappings between states and actions. Aurora  utilizes deep reinforcement learning to obtain a new CC algorithm running in userspace. Orca  improves upon Aurora and designs a userspace CC agent that infrequently configures kernel-space CC policies. Our proposal further improves these work. At the same time, Symbolic regression methods     [ref]21   have recently emerged for discovering underlying math equations that govern some observed data. Algorithms with such a property are more favorable for real-world deployment as they output white-box rules.  use genetic programming based method\nwhile  uses a recurrent neural network to perform a search in the symbolic space. We thus propose to synergize such numerical and data-driven approaches using symbolic regression (SR) in the congestion control domain. We use SR by following a post-hoc method of first training an RL algorithm then distilling it into its symbolic rules. Earlier methods that follow a similar procedure do exist, e.g.,   distills the learned policy as a soft decision tree. They work on visual RL where the image observations are coarsely quantized into 10×10101010\\times 10 cells, and the soft decision tree policy is learned over the 100100100 dimensional space. 0 also aims to learn abstract rules using a common sense-based approach by modifying Q learning algorithms. Nevertheless, they fail to generalize beyond the specific simple grid worlds they were trained in.\n1 learns from boolean feature sets, 2 directly approximates value functions based on a state-transition model, 3 optimizes risk-seeking policy gradients.\nOther works on abstracting pure symbolic rules from data include attention-based methods 4, visual summary 5, reward decomposition 6, causal models 7, markov chain 8, and case-based expert-behaviour retrieval 9  [ref]21.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: . Some proposals use packet loss as a signal for network congestion, e.g., Cubic , Reno , and NewReno [ref]6; while others rely on the variation of delay, e.g., Vegas , or combine packet loss and delay  .

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
