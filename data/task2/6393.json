We use the same training configuration as PEBAL for fine-tuning, with 20 epochs, Adam as the optimizer, and a learning rate of 0.00001. The distinction is that batch size is configured to be 8. In both long-tailed and normal image classification, we employ a similar method as EnergyOE 9.\nBy using the ST method, we can obtain a pre-trained model following the setting of OE [ref]18. Our auxiliary dataset is a subset of TinyImages80M with 300K images. Next, 300K images are used to extract the prior probability. We only use 30K subset images for training following PASCAL .\nFor fine-tuning, we use an almost identical training setting as EnergyOE, where the initial learning rate is 0.001 with cosine decay  and the batch size is 128 for in-distribution data and 256 for unlabeled OOD training data.\nWe summarize our hyperparameter setting for all tasks in Table 1.
