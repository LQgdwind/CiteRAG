      "content": "Paper Title: Story Visualization by Online Text Augmentation with Context Memory\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStoryGAN  is one of the recent methods that utilized a story-level discriminator to improve global consistency in generated images.\nCP-CSV  disentangles figure and background information to enhance character consistency.\nIn order to improve global semantic matching between paragraph and generated image sequence, DuCo-StoryGAN  presents a pre-trained video captioner as an auxiliary loss along with other design improvements on top of StoryGAN.\nMore recently, VLC-StoryGAN  utilizes constituency parse-trees and common sense knowledge to improve consistency and an object-level feedback loop to improve image quality.\nAnother recent work VP-CSV  is a two-stage approach, i.e., 1) character generation and 2) background completion, using Transformer model to address this task.\nWe discuss these in more detail in the supplementary material for the space sake.\nBut the prior arts largely neglect to encode the story narrative, which is our primary contribution here. Very recently, Maharana et al. propose a new task setup of story continuation; using first image as a condition.\nThey fine-tune the large model DALL-E [ref]32 for the SV, which they call StoryDALL-E 4.\nOurs differs from it in several aspects as follows.\nWe have explicit memory connections between adjacent image generators using the context memory to globally encode the sentences.\nIn contrast, 4 utilizes global story embedding as additional input for understanding context.\nFurther, while it is huge in size (1.3B parameters), trained with 14 million text-image pair, ours are much larger (97M parameters) and outperforms it in multiple metrics by large margins; even in the image quality metric, FID.\nPlease refer to Sec. 4.2 for empirical comparisons. Similar to story visualization, text-to-video generation also generates multiple frames from a given text.\nSince the pioneering work of Sync-DRAW 5 in text-to-video generation, 7   utilize generative adversarial network for high-quality image generation. Recently, high-quality video generation models are proposed, including GODIVA  and NÜWA . Furthermore, recent studies generate high-resolution videos, making sequential frames in high-quality 1 .\nHowever, most of state-of-the-art text-to-video model 1  generates a video from a single sentence, mostly having consistent backgrounds.\nVery recently, there is a method proposed to generate a video from a long paragraph .\nAlthough they generate the video in a long time horizon, they require both a mega-scale model trained with huge data and a detailed paragraph where each sentence is describing the scene that are close in time.\nIn contrast, story visualization requires generating frames arbitrarily distant in time (i.e., so-called ‘key-frames’) corresponding to different sentences, requiring to generate an image sequence that have contextually convincing background. Text-to-image generation is a sub-problem of story visualization, with literature focusing on semantic relevance and resolution improvements.\nRecently, text-based image synthesis has been greatly improved with the help of a vast amount of training data with a hyper-scale model including DALL-E [ref]32 and its successor DALL-E2, CogView  and Make-A-Scene  using a sketch input. Although text-to-image generation models generates very high-quality images, it may lack encoding the context, metaphoric sentences spread acorss multiple sentences.\nIn addition, naively using state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models is computationally prohibited.\nFor example, diffusion-based models   have hyper-scale model size, (e.g., Imagen  parameter count of 2-B, DALL-E2  parameter count of 3.5-B) making it non-trivial for applying it in a wide range of inference scenarios that may not have the sufficient computing resource.\nHere, we consider relatively light architectures as our base model for computational efficiency.\nMore discussion are in the supplement. To mitigate context fragmentation issue , i.e., losing long-term dependency over a data stream in context, there are efforts to encode long-term contexts in generating an image sequence.\n  adopt a recurrent path into transformer architecture.\nSpecifically, the modeling of new data segments is conditioned on historical hidden states produced in the previous time step and uses highly summarized memory states.\nUnlike the conventional memory architectures, we propose a novel memory that has a dense connection from the past with attentive weighting schemes for their better usage (Sec. 3.1). While offline data augmentation that prepares data outside of learning process is prevalent in many literature  2 9, online-augmentation that depends on training is seldom explored especially in story visualization task 0.\n0  propose an online augmentation for image classification and VQA task.\n6 uses bi-level optimization in image classification.\nIn medical domain, 8 investigate the online augmentation for personalized image based Histopathology diagnosis 8.\nNote that we show the benefit of online augmentation over the offline augmentation in the SV for the first time in this literature.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: which is our primary contribution here. Very recently, Maharana et al. propose a new task setup of story continuation; using first image as a condition.\nThey fine-tune the large model DALL-E [ref]32 for the SV, which they call StoryDALL-E 4.\nOurs differs from it in several aspects as follows.\nWe have explicit memory connections between adjacent image generators using the context memory\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
