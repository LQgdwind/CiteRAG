      "content": "Paper Title: Supervised Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization using Centroid-encoder\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFisher’s linear discriminant analysis (LDA) reduces the dimension\nof labeled data by simultaneously\noptimizing class separation and within-class scatter  . Both LDA and PCA\nare linear methods in that they construct optimal projection matrices, i.e., linear transformations for reducing the dimension of the data. It is, in general, possible to add labels to unsupervised methods\nto create their supervised analogues.\nA heuristic-based supervised PCA model first selects important features by calculating correlation with the labels and then applies standard PCA of the chosen feature set .\nAnother supervised PCA technique, proposed by Barshan et al. , uses a Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion to compute the principal components which have maximum dependence on the labels.\nColored maximum variance unfolding , which is the supervised version of MVU, is capable of separating different new groups better than MVU and PCA. The projection of neighborhood component analysis  produces a better coherent structure in two-dimensional space than PCA on several UCI data sets. Parametric embedding , which embeds high-dimensional data by preserving the class-posterior probabilities of objects, separates different categories of Japanese web pages better than MDS. Optimizing the NCA objective on a pre-trained deep architecture, Salakhutdinov et al.  achieved 1%percent11\\% error rate on MNIST test data with 3-nearest neighbor classifier on 30-dimensional feature space. Min et al. proposed to optimize the NCA and maximally collapsing metric learning  objective using a Student t-distribution on a pre-trained network . Their approach yielded promising generalization error using a 5-nearest neighbor classifier on MNIST and USPS data on two-dimensional feature space.\nNeighbor retrieval visualizer  optimizes its cost such that the similar objects are mapped close together in embedded space. Its supervised variant uses the class information to produce the low dimensional embedding. NeRV and its supervised counterpart were reported to outperform some of the state-of-the-art dimension reduction techniques on a variety of datasets. Supervised Isomap , which explicitly uses the class information to impose dissimilarity while configuring the neighborhood graph on input data, has a better visualization and classification performance than Isomap. A supervised method using Local Linear Embedding has been proposed by .  have suggested a\nLaplacian eigenmap based supervised dimensionality reduction technique. Stuhlsatz et al. proposed a generalized discriminant analysis based on classical LDA [ref]38, which is built on deep neural network architecture. Min et al. proposed a shallow supervised dimensionality reduction technique where the MCML objective is optimized based on some learned or precomputed exemplars .\nAlthough UMAP is originally presented as an unsupervised technique, its software package includes the option to build a supervised model 111Manual for Supervised UMAP is located at https://readthedocs.org/projects/umap-learn/downloads/pdf/latest/. UMAP is available in Python’s Scikit-learn package . Autoencoder neural networks are the starting point for our approach and are described in the next section. In a preliminary biological application,\ncentroid-encoder (CE) was used to visualize the high-dimensional pathway data .\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: has been proposed by .  have suggested a\nLaplacian eigenmap based supervised dimensionality reduction technique.
