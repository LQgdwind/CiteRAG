      "content": "Paper Title: AutoDO: Robust AutoAugment for Biased Data with Label Noise via Scalable Probabilistic Implicit Differentiation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe conduct SVHN, CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet classification experiments. The code is in PyTorch  with the Kornia library  for differentiable image operations. We evaluate DA methods using both the near-perfect original train datasets and their distorted versions. To do that, we introduce a class imbalance ratio (IR) that scales down the number of available train images for a subset of classes. Class imbalance is defined as the ratio of images with {1​…​C/2}1…𝐶2\\{1\\ldots C/2\\} labels to {C/2+1​…​C}𝐶21…𝐶\\{C/2+1\\ldots C\\}, where C𝐶C is the total number of classes. Next, we introduce a label noise ratio (NR) that defines a proportion of randomly flipped labels in the train dataset. For example, the notation IR-NR=100-0.1 for SVHN in Table 1 means that 10% (NR=0.1) of random images have randomly flipped labels and the number of images with digits {0​…​4}0…4\\{0\\ldots 4\\} is 100×100\\times larger than for {5​…​9}5…9\\{5\\ldots 9\\}. For comparison, there is a variety of gradient-free   [ref]20, gradient-based  [ref]11  and search-free [ref]7  methods described in Section 2. We narrow it down to only a single method from each type by excluding   due to high complexity and  [ref]11  due to publicly unavailable code. Hence, we define the following experimental configurations: baseline with standard augmentations, optimization-free RandAugment [ref]7 (RAA), Bayesian Fast AutoAugment [ref]20 (FAA), gradient-based DADA , and our AutoDO. As part of ablation studies, we enable AutoDO features one-by-one with the following notation: 𝝀ASHAsuperscript𝝀subscript𝐴SHA{\\bm{\\lambda}}^{A_{\\textrm{SHA}}} - shared (across all data points) augmentation hyperparameters, 𝝀Asuperscript𝝀𝐴{\\bm{\\lambda}}^{A} - per-point augmentation hyperparameters, 𝝀Wsuperscript𝝀𝑊{\\bm{\\lambda}}^{W} - loss reweighting, and 𝝀Ssuperscript𝝀𝑆{\\bm{\\lambda}}^{S} - soft-labeling. The baseline configuration uses only standard augmentations such as random cropping, horizontal flipping and erasing . We adopt the publicly available policy models for RAA, FAA and DADA. Using Section 4.1 format [μ𝜇\\mu, rngrng\\mathrm{rng}], the list of augmentation operations optimized by AutoDO includes: rotation - [0∘,30∘]superscript0superscript30[0^{\\circ},30^{\\circ}], scale - [1.0,0.5]1.00.5[1.0,0.5], translateX/Y - [0.0,0.45]0.00.45[0.0,0.45], and shearX/Y - [0.0,0.3]0.00.3[0.0,0.3]. This list has been selected from the ablation study of the most helpful operations in Cubuk et al. [ref]7. Other operations in AutoDO are applied as in the RAA model. We use the same learning hyperparameters for all methods as specified in the Appendix A. AutoDO optimization starts after the 100th epoch for ImageNet and 50th epoch for others (parameter E𝐸E in Alg. 1). The evaluated architectures are ResNet-18 for ImageNet, Wide-ResNet-28-10 for SVHN and CIFAR-10/100. We run each experiment four times for SVHN and CIFAR-10/100 and report the top-1 mean error rate μ𝜇\\mu and standard deviation σ𝜎\\sigma on test datasets. We run only one experiment on large-scale ImageNet and report top-1 error rate. Due to a lack of test labels for ImageNet, we use a validation dataset as a test dataset. We follow [ref]20 and split original train dataset 𝒟trainsubscript𝒟train\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{train}} into validation 𝒟valisubscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑖val\\mathcal{D}^{i}_{\\mathrm{val}} and train 𝒟trainisubscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑖train\\mathcal{D}^{i}_{\\mathrm{train}} datasets using K𝐾K-fold stratified shuffling  for i𝑖ith experiment. The size of 𝒟valisubscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑖val\\mathcal{D}^{i}_{\\mathrm{val}} is 32% for SVHN, 20% for CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet of the original 𝒟trainsubscript𝒟train\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{train}}. After the split, we distort 𝒟trainisubscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑖train\\mathcal{D}^{i}_{\\mathrm{train}} by introducing class imbalance (IR) and label noise (NR). We estimate AutoDO hyperparameters of 𝒟trainisubscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑖train\\mathcal{D}^{i}_{\\mathrm{train}} using 𝒟valisubscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑖val\\mathcal{D}^{i}_{\\mathrm{val}}, train on 𝒟trainisubscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑖train\\mathcal{D}^{i}_{\\mathrm{train}} and test on 𝒟testsubscript𝒟test\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{test}}. Unlike [ref]20, we never train on the original 𝒟train=𝒟traini∪𝒟valisubscript𝒟trainsubscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑖trainsubscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑖val\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{train}}=\\mathcal{D}^{i}_{\\mathrm{train}}\\cup\\mathcal{D}^{i}_{\\mathrm{val}} (except for ablations), which leads to lower accuracy compared to ones reported in the corresponding papers due to smaller train dataset size. We choose this approach (𝒟vali→𝝀𝒟traini𝝀→subscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑖valsubscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑖train\\mathcal{D}^{i}_{\\mathrm{val}}\\xrightarrow{{\\bm{\\lambda}}}\\mathcal{D}^{i}_{\\mathrm{train}}) to obtain undistorted 𝒟valisubscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑖val\\mathcal{D}^{i}_{\\mathrm{val}} and distorted 𝒟trainisubscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑖train\\mathcal{D}^{i}_{\\mathrm{train}} for our experiments.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: randomly flipped labels and the number of images with digits {0​…​4}0…4\\{0\\ldots 4\\} is 100×100\\times larger than for {5​…​9}5…9\\{5\\ldots 9\\}.
