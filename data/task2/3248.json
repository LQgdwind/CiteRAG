      "content": "Paper Title: EvoMoE: An Evolutional Mixture-of-Experts Training Framework via Dense-To-Sparse Gate\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Transformer model architecture is becoming increasingly important in data mining and has achieved impressive results in a wide range of applications, such as natural language processing [ref]1, computer vision , graph learning , and recommendation systems . Recently, there is a trend of improving the capability of Transformer models through enlarging data and model scales [ref]1. Specifically,  explored the scaling law of transformer models which shows that the model performance scales as a power-law with data sizes, model sizes and the computation. However, with the rapid increasing of the model sizes, it is hard to further scale the model to extremely large sizes due to the limited computation power of available hardware devices.\nTo address these challenges, sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), a popular form of conditional computation, has been proposed to increase the model size while without increasing the computational cost (e.g., FLOPs) proportionally    [ref]9  [ref]11.\nSpecifically, the input tokens are routed by a sparse gate to a few experts, leading to lower computational costs compared to a dense model with the same model size. The success of MoE model relies on both the large model capacity introduced by plenty of experts and the sophisticated sparse routing connections learned by the gate network.\nMany existing works  [ref]9  [ref]11 are exploring novel gating networks to improve the model quality or the training efficiency.\nThey typically adopt a pre-defined sparse gate architecture (e.g., Top-1 or Top-2 with a fixed number of activated experts), and then train the model parameters of both the gate and experts jointly from scratch.\nHowever, such joint-training over pre-defined sparse architecture could severely limit the model quality, and even the training efficiency.\nParticularly, at the beginning of training a MoE model, both the gate and the experts are randomly initialized. The gate does not have evidence to decide which expert to process an input token, and the experts also do not have experiences to process a randomly-assigned input token. Training all experts from a random state with random routed samples requires a long and duplicated warming-up process.\nFurthermore, these pre-defined gates limit the MoE to explore only 1 or 2 experts at a time. But in the early stage with a immature gate, such small opportunities could be easily influenced by the random routing noises, and the improper routing could even be reinforced for a long time.\nOur observation shows that such random routing in the initial stage and long-distance reinforce-based model updating in existing approaches could affect both the training time and final model quality. In this paper, to overcome the limitations in existing approaches, we revisit the learning process of MoE models and advocate a simple but effective end-to-end training paradigm, named EvoMoE.\nInstead of directly training from a pre-defined sparse architecture, EvoMoE gradually evolves into a diverse and sparse MoE architecture from an initial model in two phases: expert-diversify and gate-sparsify.\nSpecifically, we find that both the gate and the experts are underachieving in MoE training thus resulting in unstable routing performance. Motivated by the successes of weight-sharing models, in the first stage, we introduce the expert-diversify mechanism to learn the commonly shared knowledge across different experts.\nOur proposed mechanism only trains one common experts with all input tokens at first, which could be seen as sharing the model parameters across all the experts.\nTo involve the diversity of these experts, we then randomly perturb each expert with different masks as the initial model state of the following training steps.\nIn the gate-sparsify phase, the weight-sharing constraint is released and the training of MoE turns to the sparsely activated manner over these diverse experts.\nUnlike the pre-defined sparse gate in the previous works, we introduce DTS (Dense-to-Sparse) gate to decide the sparse gate gradually for MoE models. We proposed DTS gate to adaptively learn a better gating network from a dense one and gradually route tokens to fewer experts, making the training structure sparser and continuously reducing the computation cost, while keeping the model quality improving as usual.\nIn particular, to implement the DTS gate, our idea is to carefully control the temperature of a softmax-based routing function, so that to adjust the weights distribution among experts and control the sparsity of the MoE layer during training. In short, EvoMoE advances in two aspects. First, compared to the joint-training of gate and experts from scratch, EvoMoE splits joint-training process and provides an opportunity to train experts during a warm start. Such mechanism of training gate after experts can reduce a lot of random error-trails at the beginning. Second, compared to the reinforce-based model updating, starting with a dense gate allows us to get training feedback from all diverse experts and adjust the routing weights directly to the right direction, which not only speeds up the convergence of the gate, but also benefits for the expert specialization. We evalute EvoMoE on three popular models and tasks, including RoBERTa  (Encoder-Only) for masked language modeling (MLM) task, GPT  (Decoder-Only) for language modeling (LM) task and Transformer  (Encoder-Decoder) for machine translation (MT) task.\nThe results show that EvoMoE outperforms existing baselines, including Switch , BASE Layer , Hash Layer [ref]11 and StableMoE . Specifically, on MLM task, EvoMoE outperforms other MoE methods up to 0.562 GLUE score and 0.403 in average for the GLUE benchmark ;\non LM task, EvoMoE outperforms other MoE methods up to 0.88 ppl and 0.545 ppl on average;\non translation task, EvoMoE can averagely achieve 1.0 BLEU score improvement as well as 1.33x speed-up that Switch Transformer.\nExperiments also verify the ability of EvoMoE for scaling models with more experts or more MoE layers. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first introduce the background of Transformers and MoEs in Section II. And we identify two key defects in existing MoE training process including the conformity and instability in Section II-C. Motivated by these properties, we present our EvoMoE design in Section III and introduce the expert-diversity stage and gate-sparsify stage respectively. Section IV describes some implementation details.\nWe provide the evaluation methodology and conduct substantial experiments under various settings in section V to support our claims. More relevant approaches are introduced in Section VI. Finally, we provide some concluding remarks in section VII.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: The Transformer model architecture is becoming increasingly important in data mining and has achieved impressive results in a wide range of applications, such as natural language processing [ref]1, computer vision , graph learning , and recommendation systems .
