      "content": "Paper Title: Scene relighting with illumination estimation in the latent space on an encoder-decoder scheme\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the key ideas presented in  is their interpretation of the light latent representation and consequently the way in which it is used as one of the loss components. Their aim is to model the ‚Äúenvironment map‚Äù of the image, which is a small 16√ó32163216\\times 32 pixel image, through the latent representation. To create the ‚Äúground-truth‚Äù environment maps that will be learnt by the network in the latent representation, the environment maps, used for creation of their dataset, are ‚Äúmapped back to the latitude-longitude format‚Äù of given small image size by modelling LED lights (used to illuminate people in portrait photographs) as Gaussian distributions with the means indicating their positions . Another important processing step presented in the mentioned paper is how to go from a multi-channel tensor in the latent space to a three-channel, 16√ó32163216\\times 32 RGB image that will be compared with the ground-truth environment map. To achieve that goal, they use a weighted pooling layer, a concept introduced in [ref]10, cited by the authors of , about estimating color constancy of the image. Given a latent variable tensor Œ¶‚àà‚Ñù2028√ó16√ó16Œ¶superscript‚Ñù20281616\\Phi\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2028\\times 16\\times 16} (first dimension is the number of channels, two last ones are spatial dimension) it is split into four tensors ‚Ñù512√ó16√ó16superscript‚Ñù5121616\\mathbb{R}^{512\\times 16\\times 16}: Œ¶csubscriptŒ¶ùëê\\Phi_{c}, Œ¶RsubscriptŒ¶ùëÖ\\Phi_{R}, Œ¶GsubscriptŒ¶ùê∫\\Phi_{G}, Œ¶BsubscriptŒ¶ùêµ\\Phi_{B}. The first of them represents pooling weights that will be applied to each of the other tensors representing respectively the contents of the red, green and blue channels of the estimated color map. Lastly, the weighting pooling is applied by an element-wise multiplication of Œ¶csubscriptŒ¶ùëê\\Phi_{c} with each of the tensors representing color channels and summing across spatial dimensions so that three ‚Ñù512√ó1√ó1superscript‚Ñù51211\\mathbb{R}^{512\\times 1\\times 1} tensors are obtained: Œ¶^Rsubscript^Œ¶ùëÖ\\hat{\\Phi}_{R}, Œ¶^Gsubscript^Œ¶ùê∫\\hat{\\Phi}_{G}, Œ¶^Bsubscript^Œ¶ùêµ\\hat{\\Phi}_{B}. The estimated environment map channels content can be rearranged, so that each of them forms a 16√ó32163216\\times 32 pixel image channel of the estimated environment map Œ¶^ILsubscriptsuperscript^Œ¶ùêøùêº\\hat{\\Phi}^{L}_{I} of the image IùêºI. Weighted pooling can be interpreted as follows: to obtain the value of each pixel in the estimated environment map, all pixels within one channel vote, with learned weights, for the final value. Since those pixels are representing some spatial ‚Äúpatches‚Äù [ref]10 in the original image due to the nature of convolutional neural networks, the weights should represent the learned importance of certain image patches in estimating light condition information  [ref]10. We have used those concepts in our architecture as well, although in a simplified manner. We have created two models: one which follows exactly the latent representation interpretation and processing from the original paper  and second that assigns part of the obtained latent variable to represent environment map in the given image, while the rest of the encoding is not guided by any loss and aims to convey information about content of the image other than illumination, such as the geometry of the objects. In both cases weighted pooling is used for entire or significant part of the light latent representation. Training with these models requires not only the ground-truth for the relit image, but also a desired light latent space representation ‚Äì the environment maps. Since our dataset generation is inherently different from the one presented in  we decided to generate our ground-truth environment maps based on the known light properties: its color temperature and direction. Color temperature has been translated into RGB values with the use of the Colour-Science [ref]16 Python library. We represent light direction as a Gaussian distribution over value/brightness component of the light color in HSL color space, with its mean Œºùúá\\mu localized on the horizontal axis of the generated image and standard deviation œÉùúé\\sigma equal to 10% of the environment map height (see figures 15 and 16 in the appendix for an example).\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: space to a three-channel, 16√ó32163216\\times 32 RGB image that will be compared with the ground-truth environment map.
