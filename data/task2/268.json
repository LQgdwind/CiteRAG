      "content": "Paper Title: TEA: Temporal Excitation and Aggregation for Action Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the tremendous success of deep learning methods on image-based recognition tasks     , some researchers started to explore the application of deep networks on video action recognition task  3   [ref]6 . Among them, Karpathy et al.  proposed to apply a single 2D CNN model on each frame of videos independently and explored several strategies to fuse temporal information. However, the method does not consider the motion change between frames, and the final performance is inferior to the hand-crafted feature-based algorithms. Donahue et al. [ref]6 used LSTM  to model the temporal relation by aggregating 2D CNN features. In this approach, the feature extraction of each frame is isolated, and only high-level 2D CNN features are considered for temporal relation learning. The existing methods usually follow two approaches to improve temporal modeling ability. The first one was based on two-stream architecture proposed by Simonyan and Zisserman 3. The architecture contained a spatial 2D CNN that learns still feature from frames and a temporal 2D CNN that models motion information in the form of optical flow . The training of the two streams is separated, and the final predictions for videos are averaged over two streams. Many following works had extended such a framework.   explored different mid-level combination strategies to fuse the features of two streams. TSN  proposed the sparse sampling strategy to capture long-range video clips. All these methods require additional computation and storage costs to deal with optical flow. Moreover, the interactions between different frames and the two modalities are limited, which usually occur at late layers only. In contrast, our proposed method discards optical flow extraction and learns approximate feature-level motion representations by calculating temporal differences. The motion encoding can be integrated with the learning of spatiotemporal features and utilized to discover and enhance their motion-sensitive ingredients. The most recent work STM  also attempted to model feature-level motion features and inserts motion modeling into spatiotemporal feature learning. Our method differs from STM in that STM directly adds the spatiotemporal features and motion encoding together. In contrast, our method utilizes motion features to recalibrate the features to enhance the motion pattern. Another typical video action recognition approach is based on 3D CNNs and its (2+1)D CNN variants  6   . The first work in this line was C3D , which performed 3D convolutions on adjacent frames to jointly model the spatial and temporal features in a unified approach. To utilize pre-trained 2D CNNs, Carreira and Zisserman  proposed I3D to inflate the pre-trained 2D convolutions to 3D ones. To reduce the heavy computations of 3D CNNs, some works proposed to decompose the 3D convolution into a 2D spatial convolution and a 1D temporal convolution 6    1 9 or utilize a mixup of 2D CNN and 3D CNN   4. In these methods, the long-range temporal connection can be theoretically established by stacking multiple local temporal convolutions. However, after a large number of local convolution operations, the useful features from distant frames have already been weakened and cannot be captured well. To address this issue, T3D  proposed to adopt densely connected structure  and combined different temporal windows . Non-local module  and stnet  applied self-attention mechanism to model long-range temporal relationship. Either additional parameters or time-consuming operations accompany these attempts. Different from these works, our proposed multiple temporal aggregation module is simple and efficient without introducing extra operators.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: With the tremendous success of deep learning methods on image-based recognition tasks     , some researchers started to explore the application of deep networks on video action recognition task  3   [ref]6 .
