Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

LFW [ref]17 is a face verification benchmark containing 13k images of over 5k identities.\nIn the benchmark experiments, we followed the standard protocol [ref]17 using the 6k predefined comparison pairs.\nMoreover, we conducted the experiments on three more challenging benchmarks representing the issues of cross-age (AgeDB [ref]32), cross-pose (CFP-FP ), and cross-quality (XQLFW [ref]25).\nAgeDB [ref]32 is unconstrained face recognition benchmark for age-invariant face verification.\nIt contains over 16k images of over 5k identities.\nIn the experiments, we follow the protocol of AgeDB-30 since it is the most reported and challenging one for AgeDB consisting of age gaps of over 30 years.\nCFP-FP  is a face recognition benchmark that addresses the issue of comparing frontal to profile face images.\nIn our experiments, we followed the evaluation protocol of  containing 3500 genuine pairs and 3500 imposter pairs.\nXQLFW [ref]25 is a benchmark that addresses the problem of cross-quality comparisons in face recognition.\nThe protocol defines 6k face image pairs based on the LFW database.\nHowever, for each pair, one face image is of much lower quality than the other face.\nThe IARPA Janus Benchmark-B (IJB-B)  contains around 21k images and 55k frames from over 7k videos of 1,845 identities.\nIn the experiment, we follow the standard evaluation protocol using around 10k genuine and 8M impostor comparisons.\nThe IARPA Janus Benchmarkâ€“C (IJB-C)  extends on\nthe IJB-B by adding more identities.\nIn total, it consists of 31k images with over 117k frames of over 11k videos from 3531 identities.\nThe verification protocol considers over 19k genuine and 16M imposter comparisons.\nIn contrast to IJB-B, IJB-C focuses more on occlusion and diversity of subject occupation to improve the representation of the global population. Besides reporting the verification accuracy based on benchmarks, we make use of four face recognition datasets to cover a much wider range of possible decision thresholds and thus, to cover more potential applications.\nMorph  consists of 55k face images from over 13k subjects.\nThe images are frontal and of high quality.\nLFW [ref]17 contains 13k images of over 5k identities and the ColorFeret database  consists of 14k high-resolution face images from over 1k different individuals.\nThe data possess a variety of poses (from frontal to profile) and facial expressions under well-controlled conditions.\nThe Adience dataset  consists of 26k images from over 2k different subjects.\nThe images of the Adience dataset possess a wide range in terms of image quality.\nIn the supplementary material, we included a more detailed discussion, such as on the licenses.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: To compare the performance of the proposed QMagFace approach with ten recent state-of-the-art approaches six face recognition benchmarks are used, LFW [ref]17, AgeDB-30 [ref]32, CFP-FP , XQLFW [ref]25, IJB-B , and IJB-C.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
