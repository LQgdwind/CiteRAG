      "content": "Paper Title: Cloud2Curve: Generation and Vectorization of Parametric Sketches\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSetup  We pre-process the sketches in Quick, Draw! and K-MNIST into a sequence of position-independent strokes and their starting points 𝒮=[(𝐬k,𝐯k)]k=1K𝒮superscriptsubscriptdelimited-[]subscript𝐬𝑘subscript𝐯𝑘𝑘1𝐾\\displaystyle{\\mathcal{S}=\\bigl{[}(\\mathbf{s}_{k},\\mathbf{v}_{k})\\bigr{]}_{k=1}^{K}}. To stabilize the training dynamics, we also center the whole sketch and scale it down numerically to fit inside a unit circle. As part of data augmentation, we performed the following: (i) We made sure the strokes do not have too sharp bends. We split a stroke into multiple strokes from a point with high curvature or when it is too long. Such transformation alleviates the problem of learning overly smooth representations up to a great extent. (ii) We added standard Gaussian noise to each 2​D2𝐷2D point in the stroke. Implementation Details \nAlthough our decoder model in Eq. 2 is very generic, we chose to use a standard RNN. Alternatives such as Transformer  could also be used. The consequence of using position independent strokes is that the predicted parametric curve must also be position independent.\n A trick to guarantee that 𝒫0=[ref]0 [ref]0Tsuperscript𝒫0superscript00𝑇\\mathcal{P}^{0}=[ref]0 [ref]0^{T} is to only predict N𝑁N control points for i=1→N𝑖1→𝑁i=1\\rightarrow N and explicitly fix 𝒫0:=[ref]0 [ref]0Tassignsuperscript𝒫0superscript00𝑇\\mathcal{P}^{0}:=[ref]0 [ref]0^{T}. We set the family of distributions p​(𝐏k|⋅;θ)𝑝conditionalsubscript𝐏𝑘⋅𝜃p(\\mathbf{P}_{k}|\\cdot;\\theta) and p​(𝐯k|⋅)𝑝conditionalsubscript𝐯𝑘⋅p(\\mathbf{v}_{k}|\\cdot) at each time-step as isotropic Gaussian with their mean and std vector predicted by our encoder ℰℰ\\mathcal{E}.\nThe reason we chose to not use GMM here is because of its difficulty to reparameterize (as required in Eq. 3). However, the loss of expressiveness is compensated by increasing model capacity.\nInitiation of inference requires a special input state. Since (𝒫,r,𝐯)=(𝟎,0,𝟎)𝒫𝑟𝐯000(\\mathcal{P},r,\\mathbf{v})=(\\mathbf{0},0,\\mathbf{0}) is a semantically invalid state, it can be used as a special token to kickstart the generation and also use in teacher-forcing while training. As mentioned earlier, we use a set transformer as the encoder ℰθsubscriptℰ𝜃\\mathcal{E}_{\\theta}.\nSpecifically, we use the strategy of  to compute a compact latent distribution by simply applying a learnable self-attention layer on the encoder features.\nNote that, unlike the decoding side, we never use stroke level segmentation for the encoder. Thus we can perform inference without stroke-segmented sketches. For the decoder, we used a 222-layer LSTM with hidden vectors of size 1024​D1024𝐷1024D. We fixed the value of maximum allowable degree to N=9𝑁9N=9, therefore the Bézier curves can have at max 101010 control points which is more than enough to represent fairly complex geometry. For computing the Bézier loss ℒBsubscriptℒ𝐵\\mathcal{L}_{B}, we used a granularity of G=128𝐺128G=128. For the transformer-based encoder model, we used a 512​D512𝐷512D transformer with 888 heads and 444 layers. For stable training, we follow the usual KL annealing trick  [ref]16 by varying wK​Lsubscript𝑤𝐾𝐿w_{KL} from 00 to 111 over epochs. Qualitative Results of Sketch Generation and Vectorization  We trained one model for each class from both Quick, Draw! and K-MNIST datasets. Since K-MNIST dataset is fairly small, we do not train a model from scratch. Instead, we finetune on a model pre-trained on Quick, Draw!. Fig. 5 shows qualitative results in terms of conditional generation from our generative sketch model. We also show qualitative results for deterministic raster-to-curve vectorizations in Fig. 6. Both results are computed following the procedures described in 3.3. Trained with two categories, the model can also interpolate between two given sketches [ref]16 by interpolating on the latent space (refer to Fig. 7 for an example). Cloud2Curve Generates Compact Sketches \nOne important technical benefit of generating sketches using Bézier curves is that the generated sketches are shorter in terms of number of points to be stored. Moreover, short representation of sketches lead to less complex downstream models like classification and retrieval. The length histograms both at stroke-level (points per stroke) and sketch-level (points-per-sketch) of generated sketches are shown in Figure. 8(a,b) demonstrate this point for Cloud2Curve vs SketchRNN and BézierSketch. We notice that the number of points per stroke is heavily concentrated around 555 (and bounded by 2→10→2102\\rightarrow 10) for all our models but SketchRNN has a much larger spread. As a direct consequence, the average number of points in an entire sketch is also smaller (by a margin of 2020~{}20). We also show that increasing λdsubscript𝜆𝑑\\lambda_{d} reduces the lengths even further, thereby achieving more abstract sketches (Refer to Fig. 9 for qualitative examples). Using MSE loss has an effect of increasing the length because it tries to fit the data more precisely considering small artifact. Quantitative Analysis on Sketch Generation Quality \nTo confirm that our generative model samples are semantically plausible, we rendered them and classified them using a CNN classifier [ref]42 trained on real sketches from Quick, Draw!. The results in Figure 8(c) show that our parametric curve sketches are indeed accurately recognizable by state-of-the-art image classifiers even when longer in length. To further assess generation quality, the FID score  is also computed. We compute a modified FID score using rasterized samples after projecting them down to the activations of penultimate layer of a pre-trained Sketch-a-Net [ref]42 classifier. Figure. 8(d) shows that our model can generate long sketches better than sequential models like SketchRNN in terms of FID (lower is better). Quantitative Analysis on Sketch Vectorization Quality \nWe finally validate our model as a raster-to-curve vectorizer. We vectorize testing sketches and calculate the test loss between vectorized sketch and the available stroke-segmented ground-truth to evaluate the quality of sketch curve fitting. Furthermore, to evaluate the vectorization quality from a semantic perspective, we calculate classification accuracy of the generated vector sketches by first rasterizing and then classifying them with a pre-trained Sketch-a-Net [ref]42. The results are shown in Table 1. We notice that although the usage of sequential information (MSE loss) helps reducing the SWD error a lot, the perceptual quality (classification score) remains fairly similar. We also evaluated BézierSketch  on Quick, Draw!, with and without using stroke sequence information, which correspond to an upper bound and a baseline respectively to our contribution of cloud-based sketch-rendering. The results show that Cloud2Curve almost matches BézierSketch with full sequence supervision, and is significantly better than BézierSketch using raw cloud data (and random sequence assignment).\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: such as Transformer  could also be used. The consequence of using position independent strokes is that the predicted parametric curve must also be position independent.\n A trick to guarantee that 𝒫0=[ref]0 [ref]0Tsuperscript𝒫0superscript00𝑇\\mathcal{P}^{0}=[ref]0 [ref]0^{T} is to only predict N𝑁N control points for i=1→N𝑖1→𝑁i=1\\rightarrow N and explicitly fix 𝒫0:=[ref]0\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
