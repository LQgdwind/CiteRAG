Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

The CUB dataset contains 5994/5794 training/test images over 200 bird species. The Dogs dataset is a fine-grained classification dataset with 120 dog breeds. The Cars dataset consists of 16,185 vehicle pictures of 196 classes of cars. All images are resized to 224√ó224224224224\\times 224 pixels without cropping. Backbones.\nThree popular transformers, DeiT-Ti¬†, DeiT-S¬†, and CaiT-XXS-24¬†[ref]43, are adopted as the ViT backbones in our experiments, initialized with the official pre-trained weights on ImageNet-1k¬†. Parameters.\nAll models are trained for 200 epochs with AdamW optimizer¬† and cosine LR scheduler, following the training strategies used in official codes of DeiT. Grid search is used to tune all involved hyperparameters of our method and baselines.\nThe weighted coefficients ŒªŒº,ŒªœÉsubscriptùúÜùúásubscriptùúÜùúé\\lambda_{\\mu},\\lambda_{\\sigma} are set to 0.5, 0.1, and the two thresholds tŒº,tœÉsubscriptùë°ùúásubscriptùë°ùúét_{\\mu},t_{\\sigma} are 2 and 1.\nWe use 10 local prototypes for all datasets, and 10, 5, and 5 global prototypes for CUB, Dogs and Cars datasets, respectively. KùêæK is 81 for CUB and Dogs, and 121 for Cars. FC layers are non-trainable in ProtoPFormer. Baselines.\nWe compare the proposed ProtoPFormer with the classic and state-of-the-art¬†(SOTA) prototype-based approaches.\n(1) Base represents the vanilla ViT model, serving as the non-interpretable counterpart of our method.\n(2) ProtoPNet¬† is the first work that interprets DNNs‚Äô decisions through a linear combination of similarity scores of prototypes. (3) ProtoTree¬† combines prototypes with decision trees for hierarchical reasoning. (4) TesNet¬† introduces a transparent embedding space with class-aware basis concepts.\n(5) Def.ProtoPNet¬† designs spatially flexible prototypes for handling images with pose variations.\n(6) CT¬† stands for ConceptTransformer which utilizes attributes as visual concepts. This method cannot be applied to Dogs and Cars which lack visual attribute labels.\n(7) ViT-Net¬† integrates ViTs and trainable neural trees based on ProtoTree, which only employs ViTs as feature extractors without fully exploiting their architectural characteristics. For fair comparison, we rerun all baselines with three ViT backbones and use grid search to turn their hyperparameters.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
