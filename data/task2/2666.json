      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Selective Communication for Multi-Agent Path Finding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMulti-Agent Path Finding is the problem of arranging a set of collision-free paths for a set of agents on a given graph. Although MAPF is NP-hard to solve optimally on graphs  and even 2D grids , many optimal MAPF algorithms have been developed in recent years. Some reduce MAPF to other well-studied problems, e.g., ILP  and SAT , others solve it with search-based algorithms, e.g., enhanced A* search  , Conflict-Based Search  and its improved variants . However, the limitation of these centralized planning methods is that they do not scale well to a large number of agents. RL and IL methods with decentralized execution have been applied to address this issue [ref]9 0 1 2 3 4 5. During execution, each agent takes action based on its individual decision model with its own observation (may also include messages from other agents) as input, which avoids the scalability problem. For RL-based methods [ref]9 0 2 5, MAPF is generally modeled as a Markov Game 6 with partial observability, where a reward function is designed for each agent, and the goal of each agent is to maximize its expected total return. Usually, expert guidance is applied to guide the RL during training in terms of behavior cloning [ref]9, shaped reward 2, or heuristic map 5. For IL-based methods 1 3 4, partial observability is still considered, but the objective is to minimize the divergence between expert demonstrations and generated trajectories, so that the learned policy can mimic the expert behavior. Recently, researchers focus on trainable communication channels between agents for MAPF, where extra information can be obtained during both training and execution to enhance multi-agent cooperation 3 4 5. However, these methods focus on broadcast communication in which messages will be transmitted to all other or predefined set of agents. For instance, in 3 and 4, the messages are broadcast to all other agents within a distance (communication radius). In 5, the central agent takes the messages from the two nearest neighbors after getting all the broadcast messages from its neighbors inside the field of view (FOV). Although empirical results have shown great improvements of communication based methods compared with non communication ones 5, the drawback is that broadcast communication requires lots of bandwidth and incurs additional system overhead and latency in practice. More importantly, not every agent provides useful information for cooperation, and redundant information can even impair the learning process. Plenty of methods on reducing communication overhead or learning selective communication have been proposed in the literature of RL 7 8 9 0 1 2. But most of them are designed for centralized training framework on cooperative Markov Game, where agents share the same team reward. In contrast, each agent has its individual reward in MAPF, and thus more information needs to be swapped for cooperation. Therefore, selective communication is much more important in this case. To design a succinct communication protocol for MAPF, we consider a request-reply communication scenario where messages are updated in two stages, and propose Decision Causal Communication, a simple yet efficient mechanism to enable agents to select other members in the swarm for communication during both training and execution. More specifically, before communication, each agent is capable to figure out which neighbors in its FOV are relevant and influential by just using local observation. The agent makes two temporary decisions based on its raw local observation and the modified local observation by masking out a neighbor. For any neighbor that can cause difference between these two temporary decisions, that neighbor is considered as relevant and influential, and the agent will send a request to that neighbor for communication purpose. This communication protocol is also naturally capable for decentralized execution. Empirical results show the high success rate with low communication overhead of our method compared with its counterparts. Contributions. In this work, we propose DCC for MAPF. Unlike broadcast communication, DCC learns selective communication, and hence encourages agents to focus only on relevant information. We demonstrate that, on one hand, selective communication can remove temporal redundant messages, which is beneficial to multi-agent cooperation. On the other hand, communication overhead is greatly cut down due to the reduction of communication frequency.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: limitation of these centralized planning methods is that they do not scale well to a large number of agents.
