      "content": "Paper Title: Spatz: Clustering Compact RISC-V-Based Vector Units to Maximize Computing Efficiency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe pervasiveness of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications triggered an explosion of computational requirements across many application domains. The required computing of the largest ML model doubles every 3.43.43.4 months, while its parameter count doubles every 2.32.32.3 months  . As a result, large-scale computing systems struggle to keep up with the increasing complexity of such ML models. In fact, the performance of the fastest supercomputers only doubles every 1.21.21.2 years , while their power budget is capped around \\qty20 M  by infrastructure and operating cost constraints. Furthermore, smart devices running AI applications at the Internet of Things (IoT) edge  are also tightly constrained in their power budget due to battery lifetime and passive cooling requirements. Therefore, small and large modern computing architectures must optimize their compute and data movement energy and delay . Another major issue for present computer architectures stems from the drastic slowdown of technology scaling, particularly Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) area scaling. For example, the SRAM bit cell area on TSMC’s cutting-edge N3E technology node did not scale compared to its previous N5 node, still coming at \\qty0.021^ 2  µ, while logic area scaled down by \\qty70 [ref]5. The flattening of SRAM scaling challenges almost every hardware design. However, it is particularly disastrous for AI hardware, which exploits SRAMs to implement high-bandwidth, low-latency on-chip storage. As a result, modern AI accelerators resort to large swaths of Standard Cell Memories (SCMs) , which dominate their total area. Furthermore, interconnects have trouble keeping up with transistor scaling [ref]7. The increasing memory and bandwidth requirements of modern computing applications demand large interconnect networks, leading to a considerable area overhead due to the interconnect between Processing Elements (PEs) and memories. Designers often rely on the extreme domain specialization of hardware architectures to boost their energy efficiency and performance at the price of loss of flexibility. This is not sustainable given the rapidly evolving nature of applications and AI models. This paper focuses on fully programmable architectures based on instruction processors. Particularly, we tackle the interconnect and memory scaling issue on the shared-L1 cluster of Figure 1, a generic template for programmable computing architectures. Each shared-L1 cluster contains a set of PEs sharing tightly-coupled L1 memory through a low-latency interconnect [ref]8. The cluster’s L1 memory is typically implemented as a multi-banked SRAM data cache or SPM. In addition, each PE includes private high-bandwidth L0 SCM. Simple System-on-Chips (SoCs) for edge-AI, such as GreenWaves’ GAP-8 , comprise a small shared-L1 cluster coupled with ML accelerators. Replicated and interconnected through some latency-tolerant Network-on-Chip (NoC), the cluster also serves as a template for building high-performance computing systems, such as MemPool  and Manticore 0. Furthermore, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which dominate the Top500 supercomputer list 1, follow the shared-L1 cluster architectural model. For example, NVIDIA Hopper GPUs are composed of several Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) with four tensor cores and an L1 data cache with \\qty256 Ki . Each tensor core controls several Fused Multiply-Add (FMA) units, with each SM capable of up to 102410241024 FMAs per cycle 2. The slow SRAM and wire scaling make the design of the cluster’s L1 interconnect increasingly challenging as they struggle to provide the PEs with high-bandwidth, low-latency L1 access. To alleviate this issue, Kung’s architectural balance principle suggests we can trade bandwidth at upper levels of the memory hierarchy against capacity at lower levels 3. Therefore, an architecture can increase the capacity of each PE’s SCM-based L0 memory to relax the bandwidth requirements of the multi-banked SRAM-based L1 memory. In a typical shared-L1 cluster, where the PEs are scalar cores, the L0 memory is the PE’s General-Purpose Register File (GPR). Unfortunately, the GPR’s register width and count are hardcoded in a scalar Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and are unavailable as architectural knobs. For example, on the RISC-V’s RV64I ISA, the GPR comprises 323232 \\qty[quantity-product=-]64 registers, \\qty256 4. In his seminal Turing award lecture, Backus discussed the issues stemming from the word-at-a-time style of programming inherited from the von Neumann computer 5. The Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) abstraction amortizes the Von Neumann Bottleneck (VNB) associated with fetching and dispatching instructions that only operate on a single word. SIMD also provides architectures with a knob on the GPR capacity through wider datapaths and registers. Unfortunately, typical packed-SIMD ISAs, e.g., Arm’s Neon 6 and Intel’s AVX 7, encode the register width in the opcode. Therefore, changing the GPR capacity requires an ISA extension, and vectorized software cannot easily exploit wider datapaths. On the other hand, vector-SIMD architectures have long been touted as one of the most efficient approaches to amortize the VNB. Unlike packed SIMD, vector-SIMD designs decouple the datapath width and vector register width (or vector length). As a result, the vector-SIMD approach promises high performance and energy efficiency without requiring the ultra-wide datapaths of packed-SIMD-based architectures 8. In addition, the vector length is typically much longer than the datapath width. Therefore, each vector instruction executes its micro-operations in a time-multiplexed fashion, further amortizing the VNB by reducing the instruction issue count. Moreover, the Vector-Length Agnostic (VLA) programming technique is a lightweight syntax to allow vectorized software to adapt automatically to the architecture’s current vector length 9. This paper analyzes small, streamlined vector processors as the PE of shared-L1 clusters, exploiting the configurability of the L0 Vector Register File (VRF) to alleviate the bandwidth requirements of the L1 SPM. We present Spatz, an open-source compact Vector Processing Unit (VPU) based on the RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) specification 0, and use it as the processing element in a multi-PE cluster. We amortize the VNB by coupling Spatz with a tiny scalar core 1. Therefore, we can forgo the long vectors of typical VPUs and can exploit a small latch-based SCM VRF as the L0 memory of the computing cluster. This paper extends our earlier work 2 by exploring Spatz driving large double-precision Floating Point Units (FPUs). The contributions of this paper are: The design of a physically-driven latch-based SCM acting as a VRF, and an analysis of its post-implementation energy consumption as a function of its capacity in GlobalFoundries’ \\qty12 n  Fin Field-Effect Transistor (FinFET) node (Section II); An analysis of the energy efficiency of the shared-L1 cluster, as a function of its L0 VRF capacity. Our analysis also covers typical clusters built with simple scalar PEs, and memory streaming solutions (Section III); The architecture of Spatz, a parametric, compact \\qty[quantity-product=-]64 VPU based on the RVV version 1.0. Spatz uses a generic accelerator interface, allowing it to work in tandem with any scalar core compatible with this interface (Section IV); An implementation of the Spatz-based cluster in GlobalFoundries’ \\qty12 FinFET process with eight double-precision FPUs achieves an FPU utilization just \\qty3.4 lower than the ideal upper bound on a double-precision, floating-point \\numproduct64x64 matrix multiplication. The cluster reaches \\qty7.7/, corresponding to \\qty15.7 G DP and \\qty95.7 G DP/ at \\qty1 G  and nominal operating conditions (TT, \\qty0.80, \\qty25), with more than \\qty55 of the power spent on the FPUs. At the same area, a computing cluster built upon compact vector processors reaches an energy efficiency \\qty30 higher than that of a cluster with the same FPU count built upon scalar RISC-V-based cores specialized for stream-based floating-point computation.
