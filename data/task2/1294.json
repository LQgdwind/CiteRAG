      "content": "Paper Title: LCS Graph Kernel Based on Wasserstein Distance in Longest Common Subsequence Metric Space\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor real-world datasets, we use several widely used benchmark datasets. Among them, MUTAG , PTC-FM, PTC-MR , AIDS  and UACC257  include graphs with discrete labels of both vertices and edges. Also, MSRC-9, MSRC-21, MSRC-21C  include graphs with discrete vertex labels. The BZR, COX2 , ENZYMES , and PROTEINS  datasets include graphs with discrete and continuous vertex attributes. In addition, BZR-MD, COX2-MD, and ER-MD  include graphs with discrete labels of vertices and with both discrete and continuous attributes of edges. The IMDB-B and IMDB-M [ref]50 datasets include both unlabeled and unattributed graphs. The datasets above are available in Tudataset [ref]51. Also, ogbg-molhiv is a large-scale dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark [ref]52, including graphs with both discrete vertex and edge labels; each vertex has a nine-dimensional node feature. Table 2 shows specific information of datasets that we use. We divide datasets into three categories according to their sources as bio, cv, and soc, respectively denoting bioinformatics, computer vision, and social network. The Avg.|ùí±|ùí±|\\mathcal{V}| and Avg.|‚Ñ∞|‚Ñ∞|\\mathcal{E}| columns respectively show the average number of vertices and edges in a dataset, where it is apparent that the datasets BZR-MD, COX2-MD, and ER-MD are dense graph datasets. Because our proposed method only supports graphs with a single discrete label of vertices and/or edges, we apply some preprocessing before experiments: (1) We remove continuous attributes from original graphs, making sure that only discrete labels remain. (2) For those unlabeled graphs, we use the degree measures of the respective vertices as attributes. (3) For those graphs with discrete multi-label or multi-dimensional features, we apply a perfect hash to map this feature to a single discrete label.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: vertex attributes. In addition, BZR-MD, COX2-MD, and ER-MD  include graphs with discrete labels of vertices and with both discrete and continuous attributes of edges. The IMDB-B and IMDB-M [ref]50 datasets include both unlabeled and unattributed graphs. The datasets above are available in Tudataset [ref]51. Also, ogbg-molhiv is a large-scale dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
