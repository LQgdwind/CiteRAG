      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterized MDPs and Reinforcement Learning Problems - A Maximum Entropy Principle Based Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe broadly classify our simulations into two categories. Firstly, in the model-free RL setting we demonstrate our Algorithm 1 to determine the control policy μ∗superscript𝜇\\mu^{*} for the finite and infinite Shannon entropy variants of the Gridworld environment in Figure 2. Each cell in the Gridworld denotes a state. The cells colored black are invalid states. An agent can choose to move vertically, horizontal, diagonally or stay at the current cell. Each action is followed by a probability to slip in the neighbouring states (probability of 0.05 to slip in each of the vertical and horizontal directions, and probability of 0.025 to slip in each of the diagonal directions - cumulative p​(s​l​i​p)≈0.3𝑝𝑠𝑙𝑖𝑝0.3p(slip)\\approx 0.3). For the finite entropy case - each step incurs a unit cost. The process terminates when the agent reaches the terminal state 𝐓𝐓\\mathbf{T}. For the infinite entropy case - each step incurs a unit reward. Secondly, in the parameterized MDPs and RL setting we demonstrate our Algorithms 2 and 3 in designing a 5G small cell network. This involves simultaneously determining the locations of the small cells in the network as well as the optimal routing path of the communication packets from the base station to the users. We compare our MEP-based Algorithm 1 with the benchmark algorithms Entropy Regularized (ER) G-learning (also referred to as Soft Q-learning) , Q-learning  and Double Q-learning [ref]13. Note that our choice of the benchmark algorithm G-learning (or, entropy regularized Soft Q) presented in ) is based on its commonality to our framework as discussed in the Section III-B, and the choice of algorithms Q-learning and Double Q-learning is based on their widespread utility in the literature. Also, note that the work done in  already establishes the efficacy of the G-learning algorithm over the following algorithms in literature Q-learning, Double Q-learning, ΨΨ\\Psi-learning , Speedy Q-learning [ref]46, and the consistent Bellman Operator 𝒯Csubscript𝒯𝐶\\mathcal{T}_{C} of . Below we highlight features and advantages of our MEP-based Algorithm 1. Faster Convergence to Optimal J∗superscript𝐽J^{*}:  Figures 3(a1)-(a3) (finite entropy variant of Gridworld) and Figures 3 (b1)-(b3) (infinite entropy variant of Gridworld) illustrate the faster convergence of our MEP-based Algorithm 1 for different discount factor γ𝛾\\gamma values. Here, at each episode the percentage error Δ​V/J∗Δ𝑉superscript𝐽\\Delta V/J^{*} between the value function Vβμsuperscriptsubscript𝑉𝛽𝜇V_{\\beta}^{\\mu} corresponding to learned policy μ=μ​(e​p)𝜇𝜇𝑒𝑝\\mu=\\mu(ep) in the episode e​p𝑒𝑝ep, and the optimal value function J∗superscript𝐽J^{*} is given by where N𝑁N denotes the total experimental runs and i𝑖i indexes the value function Vβ,iμsuperscriptsubscript𝑉𝛽𝑖𝜇V_{\\beta,i}^{\\mu} for each run. As observed in Figures 3(a1)-(a3), and Figures 3(b1)-(b3), our Algorithm 1 converges even faster as the discount factor γ𝛾\\gamma decreases. We characterize the faster convergence rates also in terms of the convergence time - more precisely the percentage E¯p​rsubscript¯𝐸𝑝𝑟\\bar{E}_{pr} of total episodes taken for the learning error Δ​V/J∗Δ𝑉superscript𝐽\\Delta V/J^{*} to reach within 5%percent55\\% of the best (see Figures 3(a4) and 3(b4)). As is observed in the figures, the performance of our (MEP-based) algorithm in comparison to entropy regularized G learning is better across all values (0.650.650.65 to 0.950.950.95) of discount factor γ𝛾\\gamma. Note that the performance of Algorithm 1 gets even better with decreasing γ𝛾\\gamma values where the smaller discount factor values occur in instances such as the context of recommendation systems , and teaching RL-agents using human-generated rewards . Robustness to noise in data: Figures 3(c1)-(c4) demonstrate robustness to noisy environments; here the instantaneous cost c​(s,a,s′)𝑐𝑠𝑎superscript𝑠′c(s,a,s^{\\prime}) in the finite horizon variant of Gridworld is noisy. For the purpose of simulations, we add Gaussian noise 𝒩​(0,σ2)𝒩0superscript𝜎2\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2}) with σ=1𝜎1\\sigma=1 for vertical and horizontal actions, and σ=0.5𝜎0.5\\sigma=0.5 for diagonal movements. Here, at each episode we compare the percentage error Δ​V/J∗Δ𝑉superscript𝐽\\Delta V/J^{*} in the learned value functions Vβsubscript𝑉𝛽V_{\\beta} (corresponding to the state-action value estimate in (III-C)) of the respective algorithms. Similar to our observations and conclusions in Figures 3(a1)-(a3) and Figures 3(b1)-(b3) we see faster convergence of our MEP-based algorithm over the benchmark algorithms in Figures 3(c1)-(c3) in the case of noisy environment. Also, Figure 3(c4) demonstrates that across all discount factor values (0.650.650.65 to 0.950.950.95), Algorithm 1 converges faster than the entropy regularized Soft Q learning. Simultaneously determining the unknown parameters and policy in Parameterized MDPs:  We design the 5G Small Cell Network (see Figure 1) both when the underlying model (cs​s′asuperscriptsubscript𝑐𝑠superscript𝑠′𝑎c_{ss^{\\prime}}^{a} and ps​s′asuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝑠superscript𝑠′𝑎p_{ss^{\\prime}}^{a}) is known (using Algorithm 2) and as well as unknown (using Algorithm 3). In our simulations we randomly distribute 464646 user nodes {ni}subscript𝑛𝑖\\{n_{i}\\} at {xi}subscript𝑥𝑖\\{x_{i}\\} and the base station δ𝛿\\delta at z𝑧z in the domain Ω⊂ℝ2Ωsuperscriptℝ2\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{2} as shown in Figure 4(a). The objective is to determine the locations {yj}j=15superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑦𝑗𝑗15\\{y_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{5} (parameters) of the small cells {fj}j=15superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑓𝑗𝑗15\\{f_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{5} and determine the corresponding communication routes (policy). Here, the state space of the underlying MDP is 𝒮={n1,…,n46,f1,…,f5}𝒮subscript𝑛1…subscript𝑛46subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓5\\mathcal{S}=\\{n_{1},\\ldots,n_{46},f_{1},\\ldots,f_{5}\\} where the locations y1,…,y5subscript𝑦1…subscript𝑦5y_{1},\\ldots,y_{5} of the small cells are the unknown parameters {ζs}subscript𝜁𝑠\\{\\zeta_{s}\\} of the MDP, the action space is 𝒜={f1,…,f5}𝒜subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓5\\mathcal{A}=\\{f_{1},\\ldots,f_{5}\\}, and the cost function c​(s,a,s′)=‖ρ​(s)−ρ​(s′)‖22𝑐𝑠𝑎superscript𝑠′superscriptsubscriptnorm𝜌𝑠𝜌superscript𝑠′22c(s,a,s^{\\prime})=\\|\\rho(s)-\\rho(s^{\\prime})\\|_{2}^{2} where ρ​(⋅)𝜌⋅\\rho(\\cdot) denotes the spatial location of the respective states. The objective is to simultaneously determine the parameters (unknown small cell locations) and the control policy (communication routes in the 5G network). We consider two cases where (a) ps​s′asuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝑠superscript𝑠′𝑎p_{ss^{\\prime}}^{a} is deterministic, i.e. an action a𝑎a at the state s𝑠s results into s′=asuperscript𝑠′𝑎s^{\\prime}=a with probability 111, and (b) ps​s′asuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝑠superscript𝑠′𝑎p_{ss^{\\prime}}^{a} is probabilistic such that action a𝑎a at the state s𝑠s results into s′=asuperscript𝑠′𝑎s^{\\prime}=a with probability 0.90.90.9 or to the state s′=f1superscript𝑠′subscript𝑓1s^{\\prime}=f_{1} with probability 0.10.10.1. Additionally, due to absence of prior work in literature on network design problems modeled as parameterized MDPs, we compare our results only with the solution resulting from a straightforward sequential methodology (as shown in Figure 4(a)) where we first partition the user nodes into 555 distinct clusters to allocate a small cells in each cluster, and then determine optimal routes in the network. Deterministic p​(s,a,s′)𝑝𝑠𝑎superscript𝑠′p(s,a,s^{\\prime}): Figure 4(b) illustrates the allocation of small cells and the corresponding communication routes (resulting from optimal policy μ∗superscript𝜇\\mu^{*}) as determined by the Algorithm 2. Here, the network is designed to minimize the cumulative cost of communication from each user node and small cell. As denoted in the Figure, the route δ→y3→y4→y1→ni→𝛿subscript𝑦3→subscript𝑦4→subscript𝑦1→subscript𝑛𝑖\\delta\\rightarrow y_{3}\\rightarrow y_{4}\\rightarrow y_{1}\\rightarrow n_{i} carries the communication packet from the base station δ𝛿\\delta to the respective user nodes nisubscript𝑛𝑖n_{i} as indicated by the grey arrow from y1subscript𝑦1y_{1}. The cost incurred here is approximately 180%percent180180\\% lesser than that in Figure 4(a) clearly indicating the advantage obtained from simultaneously determining the parameters and policy over a sequential methodology. In the model-free RL setting where the functions c​(s,a)𝑐𝑠𝑎c(s,a), ps​s′asuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝑠superscript𝑠′𝑎p_{ss^{\\prime}}^{a}, and the locations {xi}subscript𝑥𝑖\\{x_{i}\\} of the user nodes {ni}subscript𝑛𝑖\\{n_{i}\\} are not known, we employ our Algorithm 3 to determine the small cell locations {yj}j=15superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑦𝑗𝑗15\\{y_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{5} and as well as the optimal policy {μ∗​(a|s)}superscript𝜇conditional𝑎𝑠\\{\\mu^{*}(a|s)\\} as demonstrated in the Figure 4(c). It is evident from Figures 4(b) and (c) that the solutions obtained when the model is completely known and unknown are approximately same. In fact, the solutions obtained differ only by 1.9%percent1.91.9\\% in terms of the total cost ∑s∈𝒮Jζ​ημ​(s)subscript𝑠𝒮subscriptsuperscript𝐽𝜇𝜁𝜂𝑠\\sum_{s\\in\\mathcal{S}}J^{\\mu}_{\\zeta\\eta}(s) (22) incurred, clearly indicating the efficacy of our model-free learning Algorithm 3. Probabilistic p​(s,a,s′)𝑝𝑠𝑎superscript𝑠′p(s,a,s^{\\prime}): Figure 4(d) illustrates the solution as obtained by our Algorithm 2 when the underlying model (c​(s,a)𝑐𝑠𝑎c(s,a), ps​s′asuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝑠superscript𝑠′𝑎p_{ss^{\\prime}}^{a}, and {xi}subscript𝑥𝑖\\{x_{i}\\}) is known. As before, here the network is designed to minimize the cumulative cost of communication from each user node and small cell. The cost associated to the network design is approximately 127%percent127127\\% lesser than in Figure 4(a). Figure 4(e) illustrates the solution as obtained by the Algorithm 3 for the model-free case (c​(s,a)𝑐𝑠𝑎c(s,a), ps​s′asuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝑠superscript𝑠′𝑎p_{ss^{\\prime}}^{a}, and {xi}subscript𝑥𝑖\\{x_{i}\\} are unknown). Similar to the above scenario, the solutions obtained for this case using the Algorithms 2 and 3 are also approximately the same and differ only by 0.3%percent0.30.3\\% in terms of the total cost ∑sJζ​ημ​(s)subscript𝑠subscriptsuperscript𝐽𝜇𝜁𝜂𝑠\\sum_{s}J^{\\mu}_{\\zeta\\eta}(s) incurred; thereby, substantiating the efficacy of our proposed model-free learning Algorithm 3. Sensitivity Analysis:  Our algorithms enable categorizing the user nodes {ni}subscript𝑛𝑖\\{n_{i}\\} in Figure 4(b) into the categories of (i) low, (ii) medium, and (iii) high sensitiveness such that the final solution is least susceptible to the user nodes in (i) and most susceptible to the nodes in (iii). Note that the above sensitivity analysis requires to compute the derivative ∑s′∂Vβμ​(s′)/∂ζssubscriptsuperscript𝑠′superscriptsubscript𝑉𝛽𝜇superscript𝑠′subscript𝜁𝑠\\sum_{s^{\\prime}}\\partial V_{\\beta}^{\\mu}(s^{\\prime})/\\partial\\zeta_{s}, and we determine it by solving for the fixed point of the Bellman equation in (24). The derivative ∑s′∂Vβμ​(s′)/∂ζssubscriptsuperscript𝑠′superscriptsubscript𝑉𝛽𝜇superscript𝑠′subscript𝜁𝑠\\sum_{s^{\\prime}}{\\partial V_{\\beta}^{\\mu}(s^{\\prime})}/{\\partial\\zeta_{s}} computed at β→∞→𝛽\\beta\\rightarrow\\infty is a measure of sensitivity of the solution to the cost function ∑sJζ​ημ​(s)subscript𝑠subscriptsuperscript𝐽𝜇𝜁𝜂𝑠\\sum_{s}J^{\\mu}_{\\zeta\\eta}(s) in (22) since Vβμsuperscriptsubscript𝑉𝛽𝜇V_{\\beta}^{\\mu} in (11) is a smooth approximation of Jζ​ημ​(s)subscriptsuperscript𝐽𝜇𝜁𝜂𝑠J^{\\mu}_{\\zeta\\eta}(s) in (22) and Vβμ→Jζ​ημ​(s)→superscriptsubscript𝑉𝛽𝜇subscriptsuperscript𝐽𝜇𝜁𝜂𝑠V_{\\beta}^{\\mu}\\rightarrow J^{\\mu}_{\\zeta\\eta}(s) as β→∞→𝛽\\beta\\rightarrow\\infty. A similar analysis for Figure 4(c)-(e) can be done if the locations {xi}subscript𝑥𝑖\\{x_{i}\\} of the user nodes {ni}subscript𝑛𝑖\\{n_{i}\\} are known to the agent. The sensitivity of the final solution to the locations {yj}subscript𝑦𝑗\\{y_{j}\\}, z𝑧z of the small cells and the base station can also be determined in a similar manner. Entropy over paths versus entropy of the policy:  We demonstrate the benefit of maximizing the entropy of the distribution {pμ​(ω|s)}subscript𝑝𝜇conditional𝜔𝑠\\{p_{\\mu}(\\omega|s)\\} over the paths of an MDP as compared to the distribution {μ​(a|s)}𝜇conditional𝑎𝑠\\{\\mu(a|s)\\} over the control actions. Figure 4(g) demonstrates the 5G network obtained by considering the distribution over the control policy, and the Figure 4(h) illustrates the network obtained by considering the distribution over the entire paths. The network cost incurred in the Figure 4(h) is 5%percent55\\% less than the cost incurred in Figure 4(g). Here, we have considered the above demonstrated probabilistic ps​s′asuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝑠superscript𝑠′𝑎p_{ss^{\\prime}}^{a} scenario and minimized the cumulative communication cost incurred only from the user nodes. Avoiding poor local minima and large scale setups:  As noted in the Section V-B, annealing β𝛽\\beta from a small value βmin(≈0)annotatedsubscript𝛽absent0\\beta_{\\min}(\\approx 0) to a large value βmaxsubscript𝛽\\beta_{\\max} prevents the algorithm from getting stuck at a poor local minima. Figure 4(i) demonstrates the network design obtained where the Algorithm 2 does not anneal β𝛽\\beta, and iteratively solves the optimization problem at β=βmax𝛽subscript𝛽\\beta=\\beta_{\\max}. The resulting network incurs a 11%percent1111\\% higher cost in comparison to the network obtained in 4(h) where the Algorithm 2 anneals β𝛽\\beta from a small to a large value. Figure 4(j) demonstrate the 5G network design obtained using Algorithm 2 when the user nodes are increased by around 121212 times (610610610), and the allocated small cells are doubled to 101010.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: station to the users.
