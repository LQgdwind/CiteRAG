      "content": "Paper Title: GSA-Forecaster: Forecasting Graph-Based Time-Dependent Data with Graph Sequence Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph-based time-dependent data is a set of dependent time series where the data may show dependency within each time series (called temporal dependency) and between different time series (called spatial dependency, even if physical space is not involved). A graph is used to capture the spatial dependency: a node of the graph indexes a time series and an edge represents spatial dependency between two time series. If each time series is associated with a physical location (though it is not necessary to be so), the data is also called spatial time series   or spatial- and time-dependent data . Graph-based time-dependent data is different from temporal graphs , another type of graph data, as, in temporal graphs, each node of the graph is not associated with a time series, and only the edges of the graph change over time. For forecasting graph-based time-dependent data, we propose (1) a new attention mechanism (graph sequence attention) that captures temporal dependency significantly better than prior attention mechanisms; (2) a new model (GSA-Forecaster) that achieves significantly better forecasting accuracy compared with state-of-the-art models.\nIn this section, we review prior models and attention mechanisms and discuss the differences between them and our work. Conventional time series predictors such as auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)  as well as more recent work like vector autoregression (VAR)  and causal graph processes  usually make stationarity assumptions, which are often violated in real-world data . Deep learning models        [ref]25 5     [ref]22 4  generally do not make such assumptions and thus gain popularity in forecasting graph-based time-dependent data. Most of these deep learning models        [ref]22   use RNN or CNN to extract temporal dependency within the data. However, both RNN and CNN do not learn well long-range temporal dependency between the data at distant time positions [ref]25. This is because the number of operations used by RNN and CNN to relate data at two distant time positions grows at least logarithmically with the distance between them [ref]25. Conversely, attention mechanisms, originally developed by the natural language processing (NLP) community, relate the data at distant positions in a sequence directly and thus are good at capturing long-range temporal dependency [ref]25. Transformer [ref]25 and its extensions     6  employ attention mechanisms to solve NLP tasks such as machine translation and word embedding, achieving great success. Later, attention mechanisms have been applied to other fields including image/video generation 7 8 9, object detection 9, node and graph classification 0 1 2, and recently time series forecasting  3 5 4. Forecaster  is a state-of-the-art attention mechanism-based model for forecasting graph-based time-dependent data. Forecaster is built upon the architecture of Transformer to leverage its capability of capturing temporal dependency and further uses the sparse linear layers reflecting the graph structure of the data in its architecture to learn the impact of spatial dependency. The attention mechanisms employed by most of these prior models [ref]25     6  7 8 9  5 0 1 2 4 share the same feature: When they relate the data at positions A and B in a sequence, they compare the data encodings only between positions A and B. In this paper, we term the attention mechanisms with this feature as the standard attention. As demonstrated in Section 3.3, the standard attention mechanism is not sufficient to capture temporal dependency within graph-based time-dependent data. In contrast to the standard attention mechanism, when our proposed graph sequence attention considers the data at positions A and B, it compares the data encodings not only between positions A and B but also between their temporal neighborhoods. This allows graph sequence attention to more effectively capture temporal dependency (see the example in Figure 12). Li et al. 3 also incorporate temporal neighborhoods in the design of attention mechanisms. They first perform convolutions within each temporal neighborhood to extract its aggregated features. Then, they compare the aggregated features of different temporal neighborhoods to detect temporal dependency. Different from their mechanism, our graph sequence attention directly compares the corresponding data encodings within different temporal neighborhoods to capture temporal dependency. Our mechanism does not require convolutions — its performance is not subject to the accuracy of the extracted aggregated features. Our mechanism takes auxiliary information into account while 3 does not. As for spatial dependency, prior work  [ref]22 4    proposes to use graph neural networks to model its impact. GSA-Forecaster follows the approach of Forecaster  that uses sparse linear layers, a kind of graph neural network, to account for spatial dependency.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: as more recent work like vector autoregression (VAR)  and causal graph processes  usually make stationarity assumptions, which are often violated in real-world data .
