However, when learning a sequential of tasks emerging over time, neural networks notoriously suffer from catastrophic forgetting [ref]1 on old knowledge. This problem results from non-i.i.d distribution of data streams in such a scenario. To this end, continual learning (CL)   has been proposed to bridge the above gap between intelligent agents and humans. In common CL settings, there are clear boundaries between distinct tasks which are known during training. Within each task, a batch of data are accumulated and the model can be trained offline with the i.i.d data. Recently, online CL  [ref]5 setting has received growing attention in which the model needs to learn from a non-i.i.d data stream in online settings. At each iteration, new data are fed into the model only once and then discarded. In this manner, task boundary is not informed, and thus online CL is compatible with task-free   scenario. In real-world scenarios, the distribution of data stream changes over time gradually instead of switching between tasks suddenly. Moreover, the model is expected to quickly adapt to large amount of new data, e.g. user-generated content. Online CL meets these requirements, so it is more meaningful for practical applications. Many existing CL works deal with task-incremental learning (TIL) setting  , in which task identity is informed during test and the model only needs to classify within a particular task. However, for online CL problem, TIL is not realistic because of the dependence on task boundary as discussed above and reduces the difficulty of online CL. In contrast, class-incremental learning (CIL) setting  requires the model to learn new classes continually over time and classify samples over all seen classes during test. Thus, online CIL setting is more suitable for online data streams in real-world CL scenarios . Most existing online CIL methods are based on experience replay (ER)   strategy which stores a subset of learned data in a replay memory and uses the data in memory to retrain model thus alleviating forgetting. Recently, in CIL setting logits bias problem in the last fully connected (FC) layer, i.e. softmax classifier, is revealed , which is a main cause of catastrophic forgetting. In Figure 1a, we show in online CIL, even if ER is used, logits bias towards newly learned classes in the softamx classifier is still serious and the forgetting on old tasks is dramatic (See Figure 1b). Although some works    propose different methods to reduce logits bias, they all depend on task boundaries and extra offline phases during training so that not applicable for online CIL setting. In this paper, we propose to tackle the online CIL problem without the softmax classifier to avoid logits bias problem. Instead, we propose a new framework where training and inference are both in a generative way. We are motivated by the insight that generative classifier is more effective in low data regime than discriminative classifier which is demonstrated by [ref]17. Although the conclusion is drawn on simple linear models [ref]17, similar results are also observed on deep neural networks (DNNs)   recently. It should be noticed that in online CIL setting the data is seen only once, not fully trained, so it is analogous to the low data regime in which the generative classifier is preferable. In contrast, the commonly used softmax classifier is a discriminative model. Concretely, we abandon the softmax FC layer and introduce nearest-class-mean (NCM) classifier 0 for inference, which can be interpreted as classifying in a generative way. The NCM classifier is built on the feature space on the top of previous network layers. Thanks to ER strategy, NCM classifier can utilize the replay memory for inference. As for training, inspired by a recent work 1, which shows pair-based deep metric learning (DML) losses can be interpreted as optimizing the feature space from a generative perspective, we introduce Multi-Similarity (MS) loss 2 to obtain a good feature space for NCM classifier. Meanwhile, we prove theoretically that MS loss is an alternative to a training objective of the generative classifier. In this way, we can bypass logits bias. To strengthen the model’s capable of learning from new data in complex data streams, we further introduce an auxiliary proxy-based DML loss 3. Therefore, our whole training objective is a hybrid of generative and discriminative losses. During inference, we ignore the discriminative objective and classify with the generative NCM classifier. By tuning weight of the auxiliary loss, our method can work well in different data streams. In summary, our contributions are as follows: We make the first attempt to avoid logits bias problem in online CIL setting. In our generative framework, a generative classifier is introduced to replace softmax classifier for inference and for training, we introduce MS loss which is proven theoretically to optimize the model in a generative way. In order to improve the ability of MS loss to learn from new data, we further introduce an auxiliary loss to achieve a good balance between retaining old knowledge and learning new knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmarks in multiple online CIL settings, including a new task-free setting we design for simulating more realistic scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate our method outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art replay-based methods substantially, especially alleviating catastrophic forgetting significantly.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: new skills and accumulating knowledge throughout their lifespan.
