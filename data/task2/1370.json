      "content": "Paper Title: Worldsheet: Wrapping the World in a 3D Sheet for View Synthesis from a Single Image\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe first train and evaluate our approach on the Matterport dataset , which contains 3D scans of homes. We load the Matterport dataset in the Habitat simulator 6, following the same training, validation, and test splits as in SynSin [ref]53. During training, we supervise our model with paired 2D images of the input and the target views. We empirically find that it works slightly better to first train the scene mesh predictor (Sec. 3.1) and then freeze the scene mesh to further train the inpainting network (Sec. 3.4), rather than training both components jointly from scratch. Metrics. Following SynSin [ref]53, we evaluate the predicted novel view images Ip​a​i​n​tsubscript𝐼𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑡I_{paint} using three metrics: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR; higher is better), Structural Similarity (SSIM; higher is better), and Perceptual Similarity distance (Perc Sim; lower is better). The Perc Sim metric is based on the convolutional feature distance between the prediction and the ground-truth, which is shown to be highly correlated with human judgement [ref]58 [ref]53. Since only a part of the target view image can be seen from the input image as illustrated in Figure 3, we separately evaluate these metrics on visible regions (Vis, which can be seen from the input view), invisible regions (InVis, which cannot be seen and must be imagined), and the entire image (Both). Note that the visible region masks are obtained from the ground-truth scene geometry and camera frustum (available from the Habitat simulator) instead of predicted by our mesh, and are the same as in SynSin’s evaluation. Baselines. We compare our method to several previous approaches: Im2Im  is an image-to-image translation method which predicts an appearance flow to warp an input view to the target view based on an input camera transformation. Tatarchenko et al. [ref]47 is similar to Im2Im, but directly predicts the target view image instead of an appearance flow. Vox w/ UNet and Vox w/ ResNet are two variants of the deep voxel representation  with different encoder-decoder architectures based on UNet, or ResNet as implemented in [ref]53. SynSin [ref]53 projects a dense feature point cloud (extracted from every image pixel) to the target camera pose and applies a refinement network on the point cloud projection to output the target view image.\nWe also evaluate the prediction of our model before inpainting (i.e. directly using the mesh rendering output Io​u​tsubscript𝐼𝑜𝑢𝑡I_{out} as the target view) to analyze how well our method performs with texture sampling and mesh rendering alone. Results. The results are shown in Table 1. Even without inpainting, the mesh rendering output Io​u​tsubscript𝐼𝑜𝑢𝑡I_{out} from our method already outperforms previous approaches by a large margin under all the three metrics on the visible regions. With the help of an inpainting network, our final output Ip​a​i​n​tsubscript𝐼𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑡I_{paint} has significantly higher performance than previous work on both invisible and visible regions, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on this dataset. Figure 4 shows view synthesis examples from our method and previous work on the Matterport dataset, where our method can paint things such as doorframe or sofa at more precise locations. Generalization to the Replica dataset. Following [ref]53, we also evaluate how well our model generalizes to another scene dataset, Replica , which contains high-quality laser scans of both homes and offices. We take our model trained on the Matterport dataset and directly evaluate on the Replica dataset without re-training. The results are shown in Table 1, where all methods are trained and evaluated under the same setting. It can be seen that our method achieves noticeably better generalization to this dataset and outperforms previous approaches by a large margin. Figure 5 shows view synthesis examples on the Replica dataset. Generalization to larger viewpoint changes. We further analyze how well our and previous approaches generalize to larger camera pose changes beyond their training data. In this analysis, we sample new input-target view pairs on the test scenes with 2×2\\times larger camera angle changes than in the training data, and directly evaluate all approaches on these new viewpoints without retraining. The results are shown in Table 2, where our method largely outperforms other approaches under all metrics. Figure 4 (second row) shows an example under 2×2\\times larger camera angle change.\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: on the Matterport dataset , which contains 3D scans of homes.
