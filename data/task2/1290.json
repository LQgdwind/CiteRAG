Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Classification vs. regression.\nThe hyper-parameter Œ±ùõº\\alpha, as shown in Eq.¬†4, controls the ratio of the importance between classification and regression.\nAs reported in Tab.¬†3, when Œ±=1ùõº1\\alpha=1, the gap with NMS is not narrowed.\nIt could be attributed to the misalignment between the best positions for classification and regression.\nWhen Œ±=0ùõº0\\alpha=0, the assignment rule only relies on the predicted scores of classification.\nUnder this condition, the gap with NMS is considerably eliminated, but the absolute performance is still unsatisfactory, which could be caused by overfitting the sub-optimal initialization.\nIn contrast, with a proper fusion of classification and regression quality, the absolute performance is remarkably improved. Quality function.\nWe further explore the effect of different fusion methods on the quality function, i.e., Eq.¬†4.\nAs presented in Tab.¬†4, the method called ‚ÄòAdd‚Äô replaces the original quality function by (1‚àíŒ±)‚ãÖp^œÄ‚Äã(i)‚Äã(ci)+Œ±‚ãÖIoU‚Äã(bi,b^œÄ‚Äã(i))‚ãÖ1ùõºsubscript^ùëùùúãùëñsubscriptùëêùëñ‚ãÖùõºIoUsubscriptùëèùëñsubscript^ùëèùúãùëñ(1-\\alpha)\\cdot\\hat{p}_{\\pi(i)}(c_{i})+\\alpha\\cdot\\mathrm{IoU}\\bigl{(}b_{i},\\hat{b}_{\\pi(i)}\\bigr{)}, which has a similar form to [ref]19.\nHowever, we find that the multiplication fusion, i.e., ‚ÄòMul‚Äô, is more suitable for the end-to-end detection, which achieves 0.7% mAP absolute gains over the ‚ÄòAdd‚Äô fusion method. We modify 3D Max Filtering as a post-processing.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: which has a similar form to [ref]19.\nHowever, we find that the multiplication fusion, i.e., ‚ÄòMul‚Äô, is more suitable for the end-to-end detection, which achieves 0.7% mAP absolute gains over the ‚ÄòAdd‚Äô fusion method. We modify 3D\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
