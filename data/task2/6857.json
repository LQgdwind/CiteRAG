      "content": "Paper Title: Layer-wise Feedback Propagation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe prove the convergence of LFP by relating it to gradient descent with a binary crossentropy loss. Specifically, we show that — provided the restrictions of the proven theorem (Feedback function from Equation 7, ReLU-activated models, LFP-0, and logits oc≥0subscript𝑜𝑐0o_{c}\\geq 0) — the updates computed by LFP have under a condition shown below the same sign as the updates computed via gradient descent. As the sign is the driving factor behind convergence [ref]42, the key to prove convergence lies in showing that the signs of gradient descent and LFP are matching. This principle, namely, that the sign is the relevant component for an effective update when minimizing a loss under small step sizes, is known in the adversarial attack community, where it is exploited in the mechanisms of the Fast Gradient Sign Method adversarial attack (FGSM) [ref]43 and iterative FGSM attacks [ref]44  . The convergence of SignSGD and SigNum in theory has been established under mild conditions in Section 3 of . The gradient used to update weights can be expressed by chainrule into three terms: where ∂L∂oc𝐿subscript𝑜𝑐\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial o_{c}} is the partial derivative of the loss with respect to the logit ocsubscript𝑜𝑐o_{c} and ∂oc∂ajsubscript𝑜𝑐subscript𝑎𝑗\\frac{\\partial o_{c}}{\\partial a_{j}} is the partial derivative of the logit ocsubscript𝑜𝑐o_{c} with respect to the neuron ajsubscript𝑎𝑗a_{j} to which the parameter wi​jsubscript𝑤𝑖𝑗w_{ij} belongs to. When considering the gradient in equation (A.1) together with the LFP-update dwi​jlfpsubscriptsuperscript𝑑lfpsubscript𝑤𝑖𝑗d^{\\text{lfp}}_{w_{ij}} from Equation (4), as well as Equations (2) and (3)), we can observe an analogous structure: where r​(oc)𝑟subscript𝑜𝑐r(o_{c}) denotes the feedback received by the logit ocsubscript𝑜𝑐o_{c}, r​(oc→aj)𝑟→subscript𝑜𝑐subscript𝑎𝑗r(o_{c}\\rightarrow a_{j}) the feedback flowing from ocsubscript𝑜𝑐o_{c} to activation ajsubscript𝑎𝑗a_{j} and r​(aj→wi​j)𝑟→subscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑤𝑖𝑗r(a_{j}\\rightarrow w_{ij}) the feedback flowing from ajsubscript𝑎𝑗a_{j} to wi​jsubscript𝑤𝑖𝑗w_{ij} for the update step.\nIn the following, sign​(⋅)sign⋅\\text{sign}(\\cdot) denotes the sign-function. Firstly, the feedback function in Equation (7) contains the derivative of a binary crossentropy (BCE) with a sigmoid, with a negative sign: ocsubscript𝑜𝑐o_{c} in Equation (7) is a simple scaling factor. Consequently, and since oc≥0subscript𝑜𝑐0o_{c}\\geq 0 the following holds: The sign is different, which makes sense because the weight update employs the negative gradient, whereas for LFP-Feedback we do not switch signs. Instead of the middle term ∂oc∂ajsubscript𝑜𝑐subscript𝑎𝑗\\frac{\\partial o_{c}}{\\partial a_{j}}, LFP utilizes the feedback r(oc→aj))r(o_{c}\\rightarrow a_{j})) sent from logit ocsubscript𝑜𝑐o_{c} to neuron ajsubscript𝑎𝑗a_{j} to compute neuron feedback rjsubscript𝑟𝑗r_{j}, as described by Equations 2 and 3. As LFP employs LRP to backpropagate feedback, this is equal to computing the LRP-relevance R​(oc→aj)𝑅→subscript𝑜𝑐subscript𝑎𝑗R(o_{c}\\rightarrow a_{j}) of ajsubscript𝑎𝑗a_{j} with respect to output ocsubscript𝑜𝑐o_{c} (cf. Equations 2, 3 and LRP-Equations, e.g., from ). We can show that this term is correlated to the partial derivative II from Equation (A.1). Let z𝑧z denote the current value of ajsubscript𝑎𝑗a_{j}. The important property is that relevance explains the prediction relative to a zero state. If R​(oc→aj)𝑅→subscript𝑜𝑐subscript𝑎𝑗R(o_{c}\\rightarrow a_{j}) is positive, it implies that setting ajsubscript𝑎𝑗a_{j} to zero would decrease ocsubscript𝑜𝑐o_{c}. Then, using Taylor approximation Analogously, if R​(oc→aj)𝑅→subscript𝑜𝑐subscript𝑎𝑗R(o_{c}\\rightarrow a_{j}) of ajsubscript𝑎𝑗a_{j} is negative, then it implies that setting ajsubscript𝑎𝑗a_{j} to zero would increase ocsubscript𝑜𝑐o_{c}: For ReLU units we have always z≥0𝑧0z\\geq 0. Therefore, whenever the approximation of the difference oc∣aj=z−oc∣aj=0evaluated-atsubscript𝑜𝑐subscript𝑎𝑗𝑧evaluated-atsubscript𝑜𝑐subscript𝑎𝑗0o_{c}\\mid_{a_{j}=z}-o_{c}\\mid_{a_{j}=0} by the partial derivative ∂oc∂aj​(z)subscript𝑜𝑐subscript𝑎𝑗𝑧\\frac{\\partial o_{c}}{\\partial a_{j}}(z) times the value z𝑧z holds, the relevance R​(oc→aj)𝑅→subscript𝑜𝑐subscript𝑎𝑗R(o_{c}\\rightarrow a_{j}) has the same sign as the partial derivative ∂oc∂aj​(z)subscript𝑜𝑐subscript𝑎𝑗𝑧\\frac{\\partial o_{c}}{\\partial a_{j}}(z) . Thus, for ReLU-models, we can expect to have The approximation might not hold for |z|𝑧|z| sufficiently large. The experiments show that the impact of possible violations are limited. Lastly, for the third term ∂aj∂wi​jsubscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑤𝑖𝑗\\frac{\\partial a_{j}}{\\partial w_{ij}}, we show that it has for ReLU activations the same sign as LFP from Equation (4). Let zjsubscript𝑧𝑗z_{j} denote the pre-activation corresponding to aksubscript𝑎𝑘a_{k}. Here, we consider two cases: 1. In the first case, if the output of ajsubscript𝑎𝑗a_{j} is zero: aj=0≥zjsubscript𝑎𝑗0subscript𝑧𝑗a_{j}=0\\geq z_{j}, then it receives in the backward pass also zero feedback rjsubscript𝑟𝑗r_{j} via LFP (cf. Equations 2, 3): which means that the weight update dwi​jlfpsubscriptsuperscript𝑑lfpsubscript𝑤𝑖𝑗d^{\\text{lfp}}_{w_{ij}} from Equation (4) also becomes zero.\n2. In the second case, if the ReLU value is positive, i.e. zj=aj>0subscript𝑧𝑗subscript𝑎𝑗0z_{j}=a_{j}>0, then and we can rewrite the distribution of feedback to the weight update in Equation (4) (denoted as r​(aj→wi​j)𝑟→subscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑤𝑖𝑗r(a_{j}\\rightarrow w_{ij})) as follows: Putting (I), (II), and (III) and Equation (A.2) together, we get: Consequently, all three terms from Equation (A.1) can be related to a corresponding counterpart from LFP. The sign of dwi​jlfpsubscriptsuperscript𝑑lfpsubscript𝑤𝑖𝑗d^{\\text{lfp}}_{w_{ij}} from Equation (4) opposes the sign of ∂L∂wi​j𝐿subscript𝑤𝑖𝑗\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_{ij}}. This, however, leads to the same update direction for wi​jsubscript𝑤𝑖𝑗w_{ij} as LFP adds the update with a positive sign (Equation (4)), while the gradient decent update step contains a negative sign. ∎\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: 0) — the updates computed by LFP have under a condition shown below the same sign as the updates computed via gradient descent.
