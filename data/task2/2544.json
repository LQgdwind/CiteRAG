      "content": "Paper Title: PRECODE - A Generic Model Extension to Prevent Deep Gradient Leakage\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section describes the experimental settings of the systematic empirical studies conducted to evaluate the behaviour of the proposed PRECODE realization on different model architectures, datasets, and attacks, with respect to model performance and privacy of training data. We evaluate privacy leakage by reconstructing training images using the state of the art gradient inversion attacks IGA¬†[ref]8 and CPL¬†[ref]31.\nFor comparative evaluation of PRECODE, we also defend inversion attacks using gradient perturbation techniques, i.e., noisy gradients¬† and gradient compression¬†8.\nGradient quantization is not considered due to the comparatively large negative impact on model performance¬†.\nModel performance is evaluated by training both fully connected as well as convolutional neural networks for image classification on three different datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Medical MNIST. The CIFAR-10 dataset¬†5 is composed of 60‚Ä≤‚Äã000superscript60‚Ä≤00060^{\\prime}000 colored images with a size of 32√ó32323232\\times 32 pixels.\nEach image displays one out of ten classes and the amount of images per class is equally distributed.\nCIFAR-100¬†5 represents a harder variant, using same amount of images and same image size but displaying 100100100 different classes.\nBoth datasets are separated into training and test splits according to the corresponding benchmark protocols.\nThe Medical MNIST dataset  comprises six classes of 64√ó64646464\\times 64 sized grayscale images.\nWhereas one class contains 8‚Ä≤‚Äã954superscript8‚Ä≤9548^{\\prime}954 images, each other class is represented by 10‚Ä≤‚Äã000superscript10‚Ä≤00010^{\\prime}000 images.\nThe dataset is randomly split into 80%percent8080\\% training and 20%percent2020\\% test split. We consider three baseline model architectures with increasing complexity: a shallow MLP (SMLP), deep MLP (DMLP), and LeNet.\nMLPs are especially considered as Geiping et al. theoretically proof that the input to fully connected layers can generally be reconstructed from their gradient¬†[ref]8.\nThe MLPs are composed of fully connected layers with 102410241024 neurons and ReLU activation.\nWhereas the SMLP uses two hidden layers, the DMLP uses four hidden layers.\nThe output layer is a fully connected layer with softmax activation, and the number of neurons is equal to the number of classes within a dataset.\nIn addition to MLPs, we use the LeNet implementation from¬†[ref]32 as prototypical architecture for convolutional neural networks.\nTo investigate the privacy enhancing properties of our proposed method, we extend these baseline architectures by placing PRECODE with k=256ùëò256k=256 and Œ≤=0.001ùõΩ0.001\\beta=0.001 between the last feature extracting layer and the final classification layer. To evaluate the model performance and convergence time we train all randomly initialized models for 300300300 epochs while minimizing the cross-entropy loss using Adam¬†2 optimizer with learning rate 0.0010.0010.001, momentum parameters Œ≤1=0.9subscriptùõΩ10.9\\beta_{1}=0.9 and Œ≤2=0.999subscriptùõΩ20.999\\beta_{2}=0.999, and a batch size of 646464.\nFor the PRECODE extended models, the loss function is adjusted according to Eq.¬†3.\nTraining and test accuracy are measured after each epoch as average across all train/test samples, respectively.\nFor experiments with gradient perturbation defense mechanisms, the gradients of the cross-entropy loss are perturbed in each optimization step.\nAll reported metrics are averaged across three runs with different seeds. For evaluating privacy leakage, we randomly sample a victim dataset composed of 128128128 images from training data.\nWe ensured that each class is represented in the victim dataset.\nWe follow the attack setup as in¬†[ref]31 [ref]32  and simulate a single training step to generate the victim gradient using corresponding victim data.\nFor reconstruction we use the publicly available PyTorch implementation of IGA222https://github.com/JonasGeiping/invertinggradients.\nWe use the default configuration for the attack, i.e., initialization of dummy images from Gaussian distribution, cosine distance based loss function with Œ±=10‚àí6ùõºsuperscript106\\alpha=10^{-6} as total variation regularization weight, Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.010.010.01, and step-wise learning rate decay¬†[ref]8.\nWe found that high quality reconstructions can be generated within 7‚Ä≤‚Äã000superscript7‚Ä≤0007^{\\prime}000 iterations.\nWe stopped attacks if there is no decrease in reconstruction loss for 1‚Ä≤‚Äã200superscript1‚Ä≤2001^{\\prime}200 iterations. Following the findings in [ref]8 [ref]31 [ref]32, we assume label information for each reconstruction to be known as it can be analytically reconstructed from gradients of cross-entropy loss functions w.r.t. weights of fully connected layers with softmax activation (cf. section¬†2.1).\nPlease note that the adjusted loss function of PRECODE might impact such analytical label reconstruction.\nHowever, we assume label information also to be known when attacking PRECODE enhanced models.\nOtherwise our proposed method might have systematic advantages if attacks would need to jointly optimize for images and their labels. Similar to¬†[ref]8 [ref]31, we compute mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM)¬† between original and reconstructed images to measure the reconstruction quality.\nBetter reconstruction, i.e., higher similarity to original images, is indicated by lower MSE as well as higher PSNR and SSIM values.\nIn addition, we compute the attack success rate (ASR) as fraction of the successfully reconstructed images of the victim dataset¬†.\nWe consider images as being successfully reconstructed if SSIM ‚â•0.6absent0.6\\geq 0.6.\nUsing three different seeds, we repeat all inversion attacks on constant sets of 128128128 victim images per dataset and report the average MSE, PSNR, SSIM, and ASR.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: and attacks, with respect to model performance and privacy of training data. We evaluate privacy leakage by reconstructing training images using the state of the art gradient inversion attacks IGA¬†[ref]8 and CPL¬†[ref]31.\nFor comparative evaluation of PRECODE, we also defend inversion attacks using gradient perturbation techniques, i.e., noisy gradients¬† and gradient compression¬†8.\nGradient\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
