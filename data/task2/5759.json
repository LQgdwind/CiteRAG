Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Hence, we consider the previous BPC methods for comparison. In particular, we include the BPC formulation using reverse-KL Divergence (BPC-rKL) [ref]36, forward-KL Divergence (BPC-fKL)  and Wasserstein metric (BPC-W)  for comparison. Additionally, we also show that our method gives best if not second best performance compared to other baselines. Hence, we include eight dataset-condensation baselines for comparison. Particularly, we include\nDataset Distillation (DD) , Flexible Dataset Distillation (LD) [ref]4, Gradient Matching (DC) [ref]53, Differentiable Siamese Augmentation (DSA) , Distribution Matching (DM) , Neural Ridge Regression (KIP) , Condensed data to align features (CAFE)  and Matching Training Trajectories (MTT)  for comparison. In addition, for the sake of completeness, we include the major Coreset selection baselines such as Herding , k-Center and Forgetting  for comparison.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: due to the formulation shown in Section 3.
