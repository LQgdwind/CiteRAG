      "content": "Paper Title: GradInit: Learning to Initialize Neural Networks for Stable and Efficient Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe initialization of network parameters has a strong impact on the training stability and performance of deep neural networks.\nInitializations that prevent gradient explosion/vanishing in back propagation played a key role in early successes with feed-forward networks  [ref]2.\nEven with cleverly designed initialization rules, complex models with many layers or multiple branches can still suffer from instability.\nFor example, the original Transformer model¬†[ref]3 does not converge without learning rate warmup using the default initialization¬† [ref]5 ; RoBERTa¬† and GPT-3¬† have to tune the Œ≤2subscriptùõΩ2\\beta_{2} parameter of Adam for stability when the batch size is large.\nRecent innovations have shown that architecture-specific initializations, which are carefully derived to maintain stability, can promote convergence without needing normalization layers¬†[ref]5  0 1 2.\nUnfortunately, the reliance on analytically derived initializations makes it difficult to realize the benefits of these methods when performing architecture search, training networks with branched or heterogeneous components, or proposing altogether new architectures. In this work, we propose a simple method for learning the initialization of a network with any architecture.\nTypically, initialization schemes draw parameters independently from a zero-mean distribution, with the variance of each distribution set to pre-determined values depending on the dimensions of the layers¬† [ref]2.\nRather than deriving a closed-form expression for the these distribution parameters, our method re-scales each random weight tensor (e.g. convolution kernels) directly by a learned scalar coefficient.\nThis small set of coefficients is optimized to make the first step of a stochastic optimizer (e.g. SGD or Adam) as effective as possible at minimizing the training loss, while preventing the initial gradient norm from exploding.\nIn addition, this process is designed to take into account the direction, step size, and stochasticity of the optimizer.\nFinally, after the variance has been learned for each parameter tensor, the random network parameters are re-scaled and optimization proceeds as normal.\nWe empirically find that our methods can make the initialization fall into a smooth loss region, reduce the inter-sample gradient variance, and accelerates training. Our proposed method, GradInit, is architecture agnostic, and works with both Adam and SGD optimizers. In the vision domain, we show it accelerates the convergence and test performance of a variety of deep architectures, from the vanilla feed-forward VGG net to ResNet, with or without Batch Normalization. It is efficient and scalable, finding good initializations using less than 1% of the total training time in our experiments, and it improves the initialization of ResNet-50 on ImageNet to obtain better final test accuracy.\nIn the language domain, GradInit enables training the original Transformer model¬†[ref]3 using either Adam or SGD without learning rate warmup for machine translation, which is commonly acknowledged to be difficult¬† 3.\nAs an extreme example of the capabilities of GradInit, we use it to initialize and train a 1202-layer ResNet that achieves significantly higher test accuracy than ResNet-110, which other initialization methods have failed to achieve. Finally, by visualizing the initial norms and gradient variances of the weights before and after GradInit is applied, we show that GradInit is a useful tool for identifying potential causes for instability at initialization, such as those imposed by normalization layers, and we summarize interesting scale patterns learned by GradInit that can be helpful for designing better initialization rules.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: stability and performance of deep neural networks.\nInitializations that prevent gradient explosion/vanishing in back propagation played a key role in early successes with feed-forward networks  [ref]2.\nEven with cleverly designed initialization rules, complex models with many layers or multiple branches can still suffer from instability.\nFor example, the original Transformer model¬†[ref]3\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
