      "content": "Paper Title: StyleDrop: Text-to-Image Generation in Any Style\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nText-to-image models trained on large image and text pairs have enabled the creation of rich and diverse images encompassing many genres and themes  [ref]4 9  . The resulting creations have become a sensation, with Midjourney  reportedly being the largest Discord server in the world . The styles of famous artists, such as Vincent Van Gogh, might be captured due to the presence of their work in the training data. Moreover, popular styles such as “anime” or “steampunk”, when added to the input text prompt, may translate to specific visual outputs based on the training data. While many efforts have been put into “prompt engineering\", a wide range of styles are simply hard to describe in text form, due to the nuances of color schemes, illumination and other characteristics. As an example, Van Gogh has paintings in different styles (e.g., Fig. 1, top row, rightmost three columns). Thus, a text prompt that simply says “Van Gogh” may either result in one specific style (selected at random), or in an unpredictable mix of several styles. Neither of these is a desirable outcome. In this paper, we introduce StyleDrop111“StyleDrop” is inspired by eyedropper (a.k.a color picker), which allows users to quickly pick colors from various sources. Likewise, StyleDrop lets users quickly and painlessly ‘pick’ styles from a single (or very few) reference image(s), building a text-to-image model for generating images in that style. which allows significantly higher level of stylized text-to-image synthesis, using as few as one image as an example of a given style.\nOur experiments (Fig. 1) show that StyleDrop achieves unprecedented accuracy and fidelity in stylized image synthesis.\nStyleDrop is built on a few crucial components: (1) a transformer-based text-to-image generation model [ref]4; (2) adapter tuning 2; and (3) iterative training with feedback.\nFor the first component, we find that Muse [ref]4, a transformer modeling a discrete visual token sequence, shows an advantage over diffusion models such as Imagen  and Stable Diffusion 9 for learning fine-grained styles from single images.\nFor the second component, we employ adapter tuning 2 to style-tune a large text-to-image transformer efficiently. Specifically, we construct a text input of a style reference image by composing content and style text descriptors to promote content-style disentanglement, which is crucial for compositional image synthesis 8 .\nFinally, for the third component, we propose an iterative training framework, which trains a new adapter on images sampled from a previously trained adapter. We find that, when trained on a small set of high-quality synthesized images, iterative training effectively alleviates overfitting, a prevalent issue for fine-tuning a text-to-image model on a very few (e.g., one) images. We study high-quality sample selection methods using CLIP score (e.g., image-text alignment) and human feedback in Sec. 4.4.3, verifying the complementary benefit. In addition to handling various styles, we extend our approach to customize not only style but also content (e.g., the identifying/distinctive features of a given object or subject), leveraging DreamBooth [ref]30. We propose a novel approach that samples an image of my content in my style from two adapters trained for content and style independently. This compositional approach voids the need to jointly optimize on both content and style images 7 0 and is therefore very flexible. We show in Fig. 5 that this approach produces compelling results that combines personalized generation respecting both object identity and object style. We test StyleDrop on Muse on a diverse set of style reference images, as shown in Fig. 1. We compare with other recent methods including DreamBooth [ref]30 and Textual Inversion , using Imagen  and Stable Diffusion 9 as pre-trained text-to-image backbones. An extensive evaluation based on prompt and style fidelity metrics using CLIP 5 and a user study shows the superiority of StyleDrop to other methods.
