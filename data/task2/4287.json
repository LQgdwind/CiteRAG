      "content": "Paper Title: Can Population-based Engagement Improve Personalisation? A Novel Dataset and Experiments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe VLE dataset brings plenty of opportunities to the research community that is interested in building context-agnostic engagement using content related features. It is significantly larger (15x than  and 3x than [ref]6) and more education focused than the contenders [ref]44 focused on engagement with videos. The larger quantity of examples may even enable more complex model families (e.g. deep learning) to be used in this task although our limited early experiments did not reap fruit. Another noteworthy opportunity is that this dataset can be extended periodically to create even larger and more accurate evaluations of the dataset. The Wiki-based features open up limitless possibilities as many sophisticated feature sets can be built and experimented. Due to the connectivity to Wikipedia, both its content and link structures can be exploited to invent meaningful, yet interpretable features. A further step can enable other data structures such as knowledge bases (e.g Wikidata), category tree etc. to be used for feature creation. Support for other tasks beyond the main tasks will allow this dataset to be useful in creating decision support systems that can help future content creators and help them create engaging educational videos  while confirming prior findings   [ref]6 regarding drivers of learner engagement. Furthermore, the dataset also enables comparing the findings from studies outside of education [ref]44. The Wikipedia features also facilitates grounds to explore topic related tasks such as learning the structure of knowledge . There also exists limitations in this dataset. VLE dataset is largely comprised of Computer Science and Data Science materials (Figure 3) that are delivered all in English. While this is an opportunity for AI and Computer Science education, results in Figure 4 also shows that this fact leads to comparatively less fruitful non-CS results. The dataset and its features are also not suitable for non-English video collections. Amid its size, the dataset still lacks variety of materials in topical and lingual sense. At first sight, the majority of the lectures in our dataset come from male presenters, potentially creating a significant gender imbalance in the dataset. As pointed out in section 3.3, we have taken some measures to restrict the feature set to what we believe to be more neutral features. However, since we do not have access to gender information in the data collected, it is impossible to test and guarantee that there is zero correlation between the proposed features in the VLE dataset and negative gender biases. Care should be taken when enhancing these features and there is room to do more rigorous tests to understand if any gender biases are present within the dataset. Learner Engagement is a loaded concept with many facets. In relation to consuming videos, many behavioural actions such as pausing, rewinding and skipping can contribute to latent engagement with a video lecture .\nDue to the technical limitations of the platform and privacy concerns, only watch time, view and mean ratings are included in this dataset. Although watch time has been used as a representative proxy for learner engagement with videos  [ref]44 , we acknowledge that more informative measures may lead to more complete engagement signals.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: brings plenty of opportunities to the research community that is interested in building context-agnostic engagement using content related features.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
