      "content": "Paper Title: Refining Low-Resource Unsupervised Translation by Language Disentanglement of Multilingual Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we compare our refinement procedure against other related methods, as well as those that share a similar language disentanglement objective as ours. Particularly, we reproduce the method proposed by Sen et al.  in low-resource unsupervised MT. This method is equivalent to stage 1 of our refinement procedure, except that the entire decoder is linguistically disentangled with separate decoders for different languages, not just FFN parameters. Meanwhile, Sachan and Neubig  and Zhang et al. [ref]34 both share the same goal of alleviating the curse of multilinguality, but in the context of supervised multilingual translation, where the model teaches itself to implicitly “select” relevant language-specific layers by gating mechanisms or gradient readjustments. We adapt these methods to unsupervised MT by substituting supervised training data with multilingual back-translated samples by the models. Lastly, Zuo et al.  recently propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE) variant  [ref]29, where experts (FFNs) are selected randomly to perform the forward pass. In the context of language disentanglement, these separate experts act as implicit language-specific components. We also adapt this method to low-resource unsupervised tasks with multilingual back-translation and set the number of experts as the number of languages. For all methods, we use CRISS as the initial model. The comparison results are shown in Table 4. As shown, the method proposed by Sen et al.  performs slightly above stage 1 of our method, while it underperforms our complete procedure by up to 2.7 BLEU in Gu-En task. This is in line with the fact that it is almost equivalent to our first stage. The approaches suggested by Sachan and Neubig  and Zhang et al. [ref]34, on the other hand, yield considerably lower BLEU scores in various low-resource unsupervised tasks. A possible reason for this underperformance is that these methods are designed for supervised multilingual translation, where accurate parallel data plays a crucial role. When adapting to the unsupervised regime, the synthetic training samples created by back-translation may be too noisy and inaccurate. Meanwhile, the MoE candidate  also produce lower BLEU scores than our method, which can be due to its lack of explicit language-specific components to enforce a language disentanglement naturally.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: procedure, except that the entire decoder is linguistically disentangled with separate decoders for different languages, not just FFN parameters.
