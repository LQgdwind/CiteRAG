      "content": "Paper Title: Combining Vision and Tactile Sensation for Video Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPhysical interaction is an essential aspect of human life. As robots are pushed into the real world and their tasks become more complex, physical robot interactions (PRI) will become an increasingly essential feature. An agent’s understanding of physical cause-effect relationships underpins its performance in PRI tasks. Without this cause-effect understanding, an agent is unable to distinguish and filter between promising or unfavourable candidate actions. Visual and tactile sensations are essential to building physical interaction perception in humans , in particular, human tactile cognition helps with a series of interactive tasks [ref]22 like grasping, manipulating an object, in-hand manipulation, tactile exploration, object pushing, and human-to-human physical collaboration. Tseng et al. [ref]34 and Thoroughman et al.  showed humans use predictive models to perform such complex physical interaction tasks. In robotics, physical interaction tasks are typically performed with deep neural network video prediction models [ref]25 and bench-marked with object-pushing datasets such as the BAIR dataset . These prediction architectures use optical sensation to perceive their environment. However, unlike the multi-modal systems humans use for environment perception, this single-modality approach results in more latent variables and prediction uncertainty. We believe the integration of other sensing modalities, such as tactile sensation, into these physical interaction perception models will improve an agent’s cause-effect predictions during PRI. This work aims to explore and develop physical perception forward models that take advantage of both visual and tactile sensations. A forward model in the context of human neuro-cognitive science  refers to a predictive model of a physically interactive task. In robotics, this is an action-conditioned predictive model that uses a history of sensory readings and robot states, as well as planned future robot movements, to generate the predicted sensory readings in the prediction horizon. To combine these two modalities, we introduce tactile sensation to a state-of-the-art video prediction architecture (Stochastic Video Generator ) with a variety of approaches. We explore these approaches within the context of object pushing, where the prediction system must predict the future image frames of a scene, given previously seen frames and a known robot action. We believe our unsupervised tactile-visual learning approach could be beneficial to other aspects of physical-robot interaction such as grasping, in-hand manipulation, human-robot interaction, and soft tissue manipulation. Contribution 1: In this article, we propose a novel array of action-conditioned multi-modal (tactile and visual) prediction models for physical interaction perception. Our proposed model, Simultanious Prediction of Optical and Tactile Sensations (SPOTS), outperforming other state-of-the-art models. It uses a dual pipeline prediction architecture that enables two bespoke network architectures dedicated to the prediction of the individual sensation. Crossover connections between the two pipelines capture the correlation between tactile and optical sensation and enable multi-modal learning. This bio-inspired approach mimics the structure and interaction between the visual, somatosensory and auditory primary cortexes in the mammalian brain  (Fig. 1). For instance, humans have individual cortexes for processing a given sensing modality, but crossover between the cortexes enables cross-sensation processing . Contribution 2: We generate two novel datasets111The two datasets and the model code is available for download and use here: https://github.com/imanlab/SPOTS_IML as there are no available PRI datasets that contain tactile and visual data. Our first novel dataset contains visually identical objects with different friction properties. The second is a large household object clusters dataset replicating standard vision-only benchmarks. The datasets contain RGB-D image data of the scene, robot state and tactile sensations from a magnetic-based sensor (Xela uSkin XR1944 ). Contribution 3: We present a set of comparative studies using the datasets to test the different potential multi-modal models presented in this article, exploring the quantitative and qualitative performance impact of integrating tactile sensation to PRI video prediction models. We use this comparison study to explore how best to perform the integration of tactile and visual sensation within recurrent neural networks. We show that within these datasets, the tactile-enabled prediction models outperform their vision-only counterparts both quantitatively and qualitatively. Further, we show that the multi-modal prediction system also enables accurate tactile predictions during physical interactions. The results shown in this paper indicate that as robotics pushes into the real-world, accurate and safe PRI should be rooted in multi-modal physical perception models.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: candidate actions.
