      "content": "Paper Title: Pathformer: Recursive Path Query Encoding for Complex Logical Query Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraditional KG reasoning tasks such as KG completion  are essentially one-hop query problems.\nThat is, only one link is involved.\nRepresentative methods on KG completion are Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) methods [ref]27 [ref]28 [ref]29  ,\nwhich embed entities and relations into vector spaces and make inferences by scoring triples with a well-defined scoring function.\nOther methods for KG completion include rule-learing  , text representation learning   , and GNNs  .\nHowever, the CLQA task is a multi-hop query problem since finding the answers to a complex logical query on a large and incomplete KG may involve multiple variables and unobserved links.\nMoreover, compared to answering one-hop queries on incomplete KGs, CLQA also requires the ability to execute logical operators.\nTherefore, CLQA can be regarded as a multi-hop logical reasoning task on KGs. Recently, some neural QE methods have been proposed to solve the CLQA problem.\nThey embed EFOL queries and entities into the vector space and select answer entities based on the distance of query embeddings to candidate entity embeddings.\nMotivated by the advancements in deep learning on sets , GQE  embeds queries and entities into a one-point vector space to support conjunctive queries.\nQuery2box  designs various set logic operations based on box embedding and uses Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) to convert disjunctive queries into conjunctive queries to support the union operation corresponding to disjunction in a scalable manner.\nBetaE  models entities and queries with beta probability distributions to support the negation operator.\nConE  is also a geometric embedding method, which enables the negation operator through cone embedding.\nFuzzQE  uses t-norm fuzzy logic  to improve previous embedding methods.\nQuery2Particles  uses the transformer  to encode each query into multiple particle vectors based on the diversity of answers.\nMLP&MLP-Mixer  uses a set of neural-network-based models to embed entities and queries into a one-point vector space.\nGammaE  uses gamma embeddings to encode complex logical queries.\nBIQE  uses a bidirectional sequence encoder  to solve conjunctive queries.\nOur work shares a similar spirit with BIQE in the sense that both methods use the transformer encoder to learn future information to model the implicit complex dependencies between various parts of a query.\nHowever, BIQE processes the entire computation graph at a time, and for this purpose,\nit designs particular positional encoding scheme to represent graph structure and conjunction operator.\nAs a result, it cannot supports negation operator.\nIn addition, according to the studies on graph inductive biases  , it is insufficient to represent the graph structure only by positional encoding scheme.\nThis insufficiency may result in the loss of input information, thereby affecting performance.\nPathformer just uses the transformer encoder to recursively encode path query sequences without the need to represent the graph structure.\nFurthermore, Pathformer can handle negative queries. In addition to neural QE methods, some recent studies incorporate symbolic information into neural methods. We discuss these symbolic integration methods in Supplementary Material VII-C.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: reasoning tasks such as KG completion  are essentially one-hop query problems.\nThat is, only one link is involved.\nRepresentative methods on KG completion are Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) methods [ref]27 [ref]28 [ref]29  ,\nwhich embed entities and relations into vector spaces and make inferences by scoring triples with a well-defined scoring function.\nOther methods for KG completion include\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
