Let hvsubscriptℎ𝑣h_{v} be a representation of a node v𝑣v, and h𝒢subscriptℎ𝒢h_{\\mathcal{G}} be a representation of a graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}. Then, the goal of graph neural networks (GNNs) is to represent nodes of the given graph by leveraging its topological structure. To be specific, GNNs learn node representations (i.e., hvsubscriptℎ𝑣h_{v}) by iteratively aggregating messages from their neighbors in a layer-wise manner, which is usually referred to as message-passing [ref]8 and formally defined as follows: where fU(l)superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑈𝑙f_{U}^{(l)} denotes an update function that updates a representation of the given node along with its neighbors’ representations, fA(l)superscriptsubscript𝑓𝐴𝑙f_{A}^{(l)} denotes an aggregate function that aggregates messages from the node’s neighbors, 𝒩​(v)𝒩𝑣\\mathcal{N}(v) denotes a set of neighbors of the node v𝑣v, and l𝑙l denotes a l𝑙l-th layer of GNNs. To further obtain the representation for an entire graph, we usually summarize all node representations from Equation 1 into a single embedding vector with a permutation-invariant function fRsubscript𝑓𝑅f_{R} as follows: While a natural choice of fRsubscript𝑓𝑅f_{R} is to use simple operations, such as mean or sum, various graph representation learning methods have been recently studied to accurately capture the entire graph information, including node clustering based [ref]46 [ref]2, and node drop based methods  .\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: specific, GNNs learn node representations (i.e., hvsubscriptℎ𝑣h_{v}) by iteratively aggregating messages from their neighbors in a layer-wise manner, which is usually referred to as message-passing [ref]8 and formally defined as follows: where fU(l)superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑈𝑙f_{U}^{(l)} denotes an update function that updates a representation of the given node along with its neighbors’\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
