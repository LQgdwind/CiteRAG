      "content": "Paper Title: Proximity-Informed Calibration for Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine learning systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes and safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis¬†  [ref]9 , where incorrect decisions can have severe human health consequences.\nTo ensure safe and reliable deployment, confidence calibration approaches¬†  [ref]28 are employed to produce more accurate uncertainty estimates, which allow models to establish trust by communicating their level of uncertainty, and to defer to human decision-making when the models are uncertain. In this paper, we present a calibration-related phenomenon termed proximity bias, which refers to the tendency of current deep classifiers to exhibit higher levels of overconfidence on samples of low proximity, i.e., samples in sparse areas within the data distribution (see Figure¬†1bc for an illustrative example). In this study, we quantify the proximity of a sample as the average distance to its KùêæK (e.g. K=10ùêæ10K=10) nearest neighbor samples in the data distribution, and we observe that proximity bias holds for various choices of KùêæK. Importantly, the phenomenon persists even after applying existing popular calibration methods, leading to different levels of miscalibration across proximities. The proximity bias issue raises safety concerns in real-world applications, particularly for underrepresented populations (i.e. low proximity samples)¬† .\nA recent skin cancer analysis highlights this concern by revealing that AI-powered models demonstrate high performance for light-skinned individuals but struggle with dark-skinned individuals due to their underrepresentation¬†. This issue can also manifest in the form of proximity bias: suppose a dark-skinned individual has a high risk of 40% of having the cancer. However, due to their underrepresentation within the data distribution, the model overconfidently assigns them 98% confidence of not having cancer. As a result, these low proximity individuals may be deprived of timely intervention. To study the ubiquity of this problem, we examine 504504504 ImageNet pretrained models from the timm library¬† and make the following key observations: 1) Proximity bias exists generally across a wide variety of model architectures and sizes; 2) Transformer-based models are more susceptible to proximity bias than CNN-based models; 3) Proximity bias persists even after performing popular calibration algorithms including temperature scaling; 4) Low proximity samples are more prone to model overfitting while high proximity samples are less susceptible to this issue. Besides, we argue that proximity bias is overlooked by confidence calibration. Revisiting its definition, ‚Ñô‚Äã(Y=Y^‚à£P^=p)=p‚Ñôùëåconditional^ùëå^ùëÉùëùùëù\\mathbb{P}(Y=\\hat{Y}\\mid\\hat{P}=p)=p for all p‚àà [ref]1ùëù01p\\in [ref]1, we find that its primary goal is to match confidence with the accuracy of samples sharing the same confidence level. However, Figure¬†1a reveals that although the model seems well-calibrated within each confidence group, there still exists miscalibration errors among these groups (e.g. low and high proximity samples) due to proximity bias. Motivated by this, we propose a debiased variant of the expected calibration error (ECE) metric, called proximity-informed expected calibration error (PIECE) to further capture the miscalibration error due to proximity bias.\nThe effectiveness is supported by our theoretical analysis that PIECE is at least as large as ECE. This equality holds when there is no cancellation effect with respect to proximity bias. To tackle proximity bias and further improve confidence calibration, we propose a plug-and-play method, ProCal. Intuitively, ProCal learns a joint distribution of proximity and confidence to adjust probability estimates. To fully leverage the characteristics of the input information, we develop two separate algorithms tailored for continuous and discrete inputs.\nWe evaluate the algorithms on large-scale datasets: balanced datasets including ImageNet¬† and Yahoo-Topics¬†, long-tail datasets iNaturalist 2021¬† and ImageNet-LT¬† and distribution-shift datasets MultiNLI¬† and ImageNet-C¬†. The results show that our algorithm consistently improves the performance of existing algorithms under four metrics with 90% significance (p-value < 0.1). Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: Findings: We discover the proximity bias issue and show its prevalence over large-scale analysis (504504504 ImageNet pretrained models). Metrics: To quantify the effectiveness of mitigating proximity bias, we introduce proximity-informed expected calibration error (PIECE) with theoretical analysis. Method Effectiveness: To address proximity bias and improve calibration, we propose a plug-and-play algorithm ProCal with the theoretical guarantee. We verify its effectiveness on image and text datasets with balanced, distribution-shift, and long-tail settings.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: Machine learning systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes and safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis¬†  [ref]9 , where incorrect decisions can have severe human health consequences.\nTo ensure safe and reliable deployment, confidence calibration approaches¬†  [ref]28 are employed to produce more accurate\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
