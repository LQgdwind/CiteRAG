To reach this goal, we have seen the increasing use of synthetic data and simulation platforms for indoor scenes in recent years by leveraging state-of-the-art game engines and free, publicly available 3D content    , including MINOR [ref]379, HoME [ref]380, Gibson , House3D , AI-THOR , VirtualHome , VRGym  (Fig. 36), and VRKitchen [ref]385. In addition, the AirSim  open-source simulator was developed for outdoor scenarios. Such synthetic data could be relatively easily scaled up compared with traditional data collection and labeling processes. With increasing realism and faster rendering speeds built on dedicated hardware, synthetic data from the virtual world is becoming increasingly similar to data collected from the physical world. In these realistic virtual environments, it is possible to evaluate any AI method or system from a much more holistic perspective. Using a holistic evaluation, whether a method or a system is intelligent or not is no longer measured by the successful performance of a single narrow task; rather, it is measured by the ability to perform well across various tasks: the perception of environments, planning of actions, predictions of other agents’ behaviors, and ability to rapidly adapt learned knowledge to new environments for new tasks. To build this kind of task-driven evaluation, physics-based simulations for multi-material, multi-physics phenomena (Fig. 37) will play a central role. We argue that cognitive AI needs to accelerate the pace of its adoption of more advanced simulation models from computer graphics, in order to benefit from the capability of highly predictive forward simulations, especially graphics processing unit (GPU) optimizations that allow real-time performance . Here, we provide a brief review of the recent physics-based simulation methods, with a particular focus on the  material point method (MPM). The accuracy of physics-based reasoning greatly relies on the fidelity of a physics-based simulation. Similarly, the scope of supported virtual materials and their physical and interactive properties directly determine the complexity of the AI tasks involving them. Since the pioneering work of Terzopouloset al.   for solids and that of Foster and Metaxas  for fluids, many mathematical and physical models in computer graphics have been developed and applied to the simulation of solids and fluids in a 3D virtual environment. For decades, the computer graphics and computational physics community sought to increase the robustness, efficiency, stability, and accuracy of simulations for cloth, collisions, deformable, fire, fluids, fractures, hair, rigid bodies, rods, shells, and many other substances. Computer simulation-based engineering science plays an important role in solving many modern problems as an inexpensive, safe, and analyzable companion to physical experiments. The most challenging problems are those involving extreme deformation, topology change, and interactions among different materials and phases. Examples of these problems include hypervelocity impact, explosion, crack evolution, fluid-structure interactions, climate simulation, and ice-sheet movements. Despite the rapid development of computational solid and fluid mechanics, effectively and efficiently simulating these complex phenomena remains difficult. Based on how the continuous physical equations are discretized, the existing methods can be classified into the following categories: Eulerian grid-based approaches, where the computational grid is fixed in space, and physical properties advect through the deformation flow. A typical example is the Eulerian simulation of free surface incompressible flow  . Eulerian methods are more error-prone and require delicate treatment when dealing with deforming material interfaces and boundary conditions, since no explicit tracking of them is available. Lagrangian mesh-based methods, represented by FEM   , where the material is described with and embedded in a deforming mesh. Mass, momentum, and energy conservation can be solved with less effort. The main problem of acfem is mesh distortion and lack of contact during large deformations   or topologically changing events . Lagrangian mesh-free methods, such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)  and the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM) . These methods allow arbitrary deformation but require expensive operations such as neighborhood searching . Since the interpolation kernel is approximated with neighboring particles, these methods also tend to suffer from numerical instability issues. Hybrid Lagrangian–Eulerian methods, such as the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) methods  and the MPM. These methods (particularly the MPM) combine the advantages of both Lagrangian methods and Eulerian grid methods by using a mixed representation. In particular, as a generalization of the hybrid fluid implicit particle (FLIP) method   from computational fluid dynamics to computational solid mechanics, the MPM has proven to be a promising discretization choice for simulating many solid and fluid materials since its introduction two decades ago  . In the field of visual computing, existing work includes snow  , foam   , sand  , rigid body , fracture  , cloth , hair , water , and solid-fluid mixtures   . In computational engineering science, this method has also become one of the most recent and advanced discretization choices for various applications. Due to its many advantages, it has been successfully applied to tackling extreme deformation events such as fracture evolution , material failure  , hyper-velocity impact  , explosion , fluid-structure interaction  , biomechanics , geomechanics , and many other examples that are considerably more difficult when addressed with traditional, non-hybrid approaches. In addition to experiencing a tremendously expanding scope of application, the MPM’s discretization scheme has been extensively improved . To alleviate numerical inaccuracy and stability issues associated with the original MPM formulation, researchers have proposed different variations of the MPM, including the generalized interpolation material point (GIMP) method  , the convected particle domain interpolation (CPDI) method , and the dual domain material point (DDMP) method .\n\nReference markers found: [379]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]379: increasing use of synthetic data and simulation platforms for indoor scenes in recent years by leveraging state-of-the-art game engines and free, publicly available 3D content    , including MINOR [ref]379, HoME [ref]380, Gibson , House3D , AI-THOR , VirtualHome , VRGym  (Fig. 36), and VRKitchen [ref]385.
