The past decade has witnessed the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in medical image analysis, including disease classification 3, [ref]11, , , segmentation , [ref]8, 8, 9, detection , , and report generation , , . CNNs require a large amount of finely annotated training data to locate diseases. However, the annotation is tedious and laborious for radiologists. As a result, the X-ray datasets often only have the image-level labels and few location labels, which leads to inferior localization results. Developing localization models with coarse-grained (image-level) labels and few location annotations is an urgent problem, which\narouses a weakly-supervised localization task . Existing weakly-supervised localization algorithms are mainly based on multi-instance learning (MIL) ,  and class activation maps (CAM) 3, 0, 6. However, these methods often yield inaccurate or incomplete regions. For example, the CAM-based method only activates the most discriminative region and generates incomplete targets. To overcome these problems, beyond mere algorithmic innovations 2, , , 4, we argue that considering the complementary information between anatomical regions and multiple images can lead to a better localization result. This insight is inspired by the domain knowledge in the medical field: radiologists are trained to read a large number of X-ray images and analyse them by recognizing and comparing the differences (e.g., shapes, textures, contrast, etc.). Radiologists make decisions based on what they have learned and observed though comparison. Recently, several attention-based works , 7 conducted disease localization by comparing abnormal and normal instances. However, they involved no direct supervision (e.g., the position label) to conduct error feedback, and it was difficult to interpret what the models have learned.\nTo overcome these insufficiencies, we proposed the cross chest graph (CCG) 4 to regularize the model instead of the attention operations , 7. CCG considered the inter-image relationship and neglected the intra-image relationship. More importantly, CCG obtained regions via clustering, and the self-organized regions lack pathological explanations. Based on but quite different from CCG, the proposed Graph Regularized Embedding Network (GREN) (Figure 1) considers both inter-image and intra-image relationships, and explicitly models the anatomical structures. We calculate the relationship between the two lung lobes because most chest diseases such as pneumonia, infiltration and consolidation, rarely appear symmetrically in both sides 7, and cardiomegaly usually makes left lung region smaller on X-ray image. Thus, the features of these abnormal regions can be identified via comparing the lung lobes. Our main contributions are: We propose GREN, the first method exploring relational graphs across images and regions to regularize training in weakly-supervised localization. Compared with the attention-based methods, GREN avoids the normal control sampling problem. Compared with Graph-Rise , GREN requires no additional manual annotations. As the core elements, we present the intra-image and inter-image knowledge learning modules to model the complementary information. We achieve the state-of-the-art result for disease localization on NIH chest X-ray dataset. Ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. We make the code publicly available for subsequent studies to reproduce our results.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: to support clinical diagnosis and treatment.
