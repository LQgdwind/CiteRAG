      "content": "Paper Title: Combinatorial Gap Theorem and Reductions between Promise CSPs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe define a concept of a minion (d,r)𝑑𝑟(d,r)-homomorphism (Definition 3) that weakens minion homomorphisms in the following sense: for d=1,r=1formulae-sequence𝑑1𝑟1d=1,r=1 the concepts coincide, and increasing d𝑑d or r𝑟r makes the concept weaker. We then apply the Main Theorem (Theorem 8) to show that a generalization of Theorem 6 remains true with this weaker concept, thus giving us more reductions between PCSPs. If Pol⁡(𝐀1,𝐁1)Polsubscript𝐀1subscript𝐁1\\operatorname{Pol}({\\mathbf{A}}_{1},{\\mathbf{B}}_{1}) has a minion (d,r)𝑑𝑟(d,r)-homomorphism to Pol⁡(𝐀2,𝐁2)Polsubscript𝐀2subscript𝐁2\\operatorname{Pol}({\\mathbf{A}}_{2},{\\mathbf{B}}_{2}), then PCSP⁡(𝐀2,𝐁2)PCSPsubscript𝐀2subscript𝐁2\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{A}}_{2},{\\mathbf{B}}_{2}) is reducible to PCSP⁡(𝐀1,𝐁1)PCSPsubscript𝐀1subscript𝐁1\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{A}}_{1},{\\mathbf{B}}_{1}). This theorem partially resolves the shortcomings of the state-of-the-art discussed above. In particular, the theorem gives a reduction of any NP-hard CSP to many known NP-hard PCSPs, including all NP-hard Boolean symmetric PCSPs, which were classified in  (e.g., the (2+ε)2𝜀(2+\\varepsilon)-SAT from  and, more generally, NP-hard symmetric folded PCSPs classified in [ref]13), those NP-hard approximate coloring problems, i.e., PCSPs of the from PCSP⁡(𝐊n,𝐊m)PCSPsubscript𝐊𝑛subscript𝐊𝑚\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{K}}_{n},{\\mathbf{K}}_{m}), identified in  (e.g., PCSP⁡(𝐊3,𝐊5)PCSPsubscript𝐊3subscript𝐊5\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{K}}_{3},{\\mathbf{K}}_{5})), all approximate 3-uniform hypergraph coloring problems, i.e., PCSPs over (𝐍𝐀𝐄n3,𝐍𝐀𝐄m3)superscriptsubscript𝐍𝐀𝐄𝑛3superscriptsubscript𝐍𝐀𝐄𝑚3({\\mathbf{NAE}}_{n}^{3},{\\mathbf{NAE}}_{m}^{3})  (for this we need an improvement of the proof by Wrochna ), those NP-hard PCSPs identified in  (promise SAT on non-Boolean domains), in  (graph 3-coloring with strong promises), and in  (variants of 3-uniform hypergraph coloring). The examples of reductions that are not (known to be) covered include NP-hardness proofs\nin   \nand reductions that were used in  to improve . These examples suggest directions for improving the Main Theorem and thus Theorem 7; we discuss these directions in the Conclusion. The reduction in Theorem 7 is very simple and the proof of correctness essentially amounts to applying the Main Theorem, whose proof is itself quite short. We now explain the reduction in some detail. We fist observe that every PCSP⁡(𝐀,𝐁)PCSP𝐀𝐁\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{A}},{\\mathbf{B}}) is equivalent to a certain PCSP⁡(𝐀′,𝐁′)PCSPsuperscript𝐀′superscript𝐁′\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{A}}^{\\prime},{\\mathbf{B}}^{\\prime}), where 𝐀′superscript𝐀′{\\mathbf{A}}^{\\prime} consists of all relations up to any fixed sufficiently large arity on any sufficiently large domain. This is a very simple consequence of   but still a remarkable observation: we can use any instance as an input to PCSP⁡(𝐀′,𝐁′)PCSPsuperscript𝐀′superscript𝐁′\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{A}}^{\\prime},{\\mathbf{B}}^{\\prime}) and thus effectively to PCSP⁡(𝐀,𝐁)PCSP𝐀𝐁\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{A}},{\\mathbf{B}}). In fact, the trivial reduction from CSP⁡(𝐀2,𝐁2)CSPsubscript𝐀2subscript𝐁2\\operatorname{CSP}({\\mathbf{A}}_{2},{\\mathbf{B}}_{2}) to CSP⁡(𝐀1′,𝐁1′)CSPsuperscriptsubscript𝐀1′superscriptsubscript𝐁1′\\operatorname{CSP}({\\mathbf{A}}_{1}^{\\prime},{\\mathbf{B}}_{1}^{\\prime}) is correct in the situation of Theorem 6 (and, again, this was essentially proved in ). Our reduction is just the next most obvious one – in essence, we introduce a variable for every bounded arity subset of the original variables and include the obvious constraints coming from the requirement that values of variables form partial solutions. In summary, the reduction from PCSP⁡(𝐀𝟐,𝐁𝟐)PCSPsubscript𝐀2subscript𝐁2\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{A_{2}}},{\\mathbf{B_{2}}}) to PCSP⁡(𝐀1,𝐁1)PCSPsubscript𝐀1subscript𝐁1\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{A}}_{1},{\\mathbf{B}}_{1}) is a composition of a reduction from PCSP⁡(𝐀2,𝐁2)PCSPsubscript𝐀2subscript𝐁2\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{A}}_{2},{\\mathbf{B}}_{2}) to PCSP⁡(𝐀1′,𝐁1′)PCSPsuperscriptsubscript𝐀1′superscriptsubscript𝐁1′\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{A}}_{1}^{\\prime},{\\mathbf{B}}_{1}^{\\prime}) (which is the “repetition” reduction describe above) and a reduction from the latter PCSP to PCSP⁡(𝐀1,𝐁1)PCSPsubscript𝐀1subscript𝐁1\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{A}}_{1},{\\mathbf{B}}_{1}) (which is the “polymorphism” or “long code ” reduction). We remark that all the reductions in the PCSP/PCP area, which we are aware of, are variations of these two types of reductions. Is it a coincidence? Finally, it seems unlikely that Theorem 6 is a single source of hardness for all PCSPs in the same sense as Theorem 5 is for CSPs. However, we hope that our result will serve as a useful step toward the goal of obtaining such a theorem, which would give a uniform reduction that completely replaces (and explain) a bit ad hoc intermediate problems and reductions that are still necessary for some PCSPs. Ideally, and this seems much more challenging even for CSPs, the theorem would also fully capture the tractability part. Another exciting direction is toward the more general Promise Valued CSP framework (see [ref]6 ), which includes problems such as those in Theorem 2. Remarkably, an analogue of Theorem 6 is already available by an unpublished work of Kazda .\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: NP-hard PCSPs, including all NP-hard Boolean symmetric PCSPs, which were classified in  (e.g., the (2+ε)2𝜀(2+\\varepsilon)-SAT from  and, more generally, NP-hard symmetric folded PCSPs classified in [ref]13), those NP-hard approximate coloring problems, i.e., PCSPs of the from PCSP⁡(𝐊n,𝐊m)PCSPsubscript𝐊𝑛subscript𝐊𝑚\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{K}}_{n},{\\mathbf{K}}_{m}), identified in  (e.g.,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
