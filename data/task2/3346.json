      "content": "Paper Title: Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos: A Survey and Future Directions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSpan-based methods aim to predict the probability of each video snippet/frame being the start and end positions of the target moment. Inspired by the reading comprehension (RC) task in NLP  [ref]7 , L-Net  and ExCL  first formulate TSGV as a span prediction task. In addition to the regression-based predictors, ExCL also designs corresponding span prediction heads. Based on these two works, Zhang et al.  compare differences between RC and TSGV tasks and propose VSLNet. Specifically, video is continuous and causal relations between video events are usually adjacent, while words in query are discrete and demonstrate syntactic structure. Shown in Fig. 17, VSLNet exploits a context-query attention modified from QANet [ref]7 to perform fine-grained multimodal interaction. Then a conditioned span predictor computes the probabilities of the start/end boundaries of the target moment. To bridge the gap between RC and TSGV, VSLNet introduces a query-guided highlighting module, which effectively narrows down the moment search space to a smaller highlighted region. Existing methods including VSLNet generally perform better on short videos than on long videos. Their follow-up work  extends VSLNet to handle long videos by incorporating concepts from multi-paragraph question answering . Long videos are split into multiple short videos and a hierarchical searching strategy is deployed for moment localization. In general, the overall frameworks of regression- and span-based methods are similar. Thus, the continuous performance improvements of subsequent work  [ref]101          4   [ref]156            are also achieved by modifying the feature encoding and multimodal interaction modules, introducing auxiliary objectives, and/or augmenting additional features. In particular, SeqPAN [ref]101 introduces the concept of named entity recognition    in NLP by splitting the snippet sequence into begin, inside, and end regions of the target moment, and background region. IVG-DCL  introduces a dual contrastive learning mechanism to enhance multimodal interaction and leverages a structured causal model  to address the selection bias of TSGV. CI-MHA  proposes to remedy the start/end prediction noise caused by annotator disagreement via an auxiliary moment segmentation task. ABIN  devises an auxiliary adversarial discriminator network to produce coordinate and frame correlation distributions for moment boundary refinement. DORi  incorporates appearance features and captures the relations between objects and actions guided by the query. CBLN 4 addresses TSGV from a new perspective. It reformulates TSGV by scoring all pairs of start and end indices simultaneously and predicting moments with a biaffine structure. Hao et al.  and Liu et al.  focus on solving the bias issue via video shuffling and contrastive sample generation, respectively. PPT  and VPTSL  introduce prompts to jointly model video and text with the unified framework. LocFormer  designs a multimodal transformer for TSGV in BERT-style. CFSTRI [ref]156, MS2P  and STDNet  adopt spatio-temporal cues to interact with query for TSGV. Yang et al.  and Hao  decompose the query into multiple semantic phrases to interact with video for boundary prediction. MCA  and PEARL  further incorporate subtitles of the video to assist the TSGV. EMB  solves uncertainties in TSGV with an elastic moment bounding strategy.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Span-based methods aim to predict the probability of each video snippet/frame being the start and end positions of the target moment.
