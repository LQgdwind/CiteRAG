      "content": "Paper Title: Topological Augmentation for Class-Imbalanced Node Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClass-imbalanced learning.\nClass imbalance is a common problem in many fields of data mining research   .\nExisting solutions for class-imbalanced learning can be categorized into four groups:\nResampling methods balance the training set by either discarding majority    or synthesizing minority samples [ref]6 .\nEnsemble techniques    train multiple classifiers with various balancing strategies and combine them for inference.\nPost-hoc correction     compensates for minority classes by adjusting the logits during inference.\nLoss modification methods    perform compensation by emphasizing/suppressing minority/majority classes.\nGenerally, these techniques do not consider the graph topology thus have limited performance in IGL. Imbalanced graph learning.\nTo handle class imbalance in graph data, several methods have been proposed in recent studies   4    , we review the most closely related works here.\nOne of the early works GraphSMOTE 4 adopts SMOTE [ref]6 oversampling in the node embedding space to synthesize minority nodes and complements the topology with a learnable edge predictor.\nA more recent work GraphENS  synthesizes the whole ego network through saliency-based ego network mixing to handle the neighbor-overfitting problem.\nOn the other hand, ReNode  addresses topology imbalance, i.e., the unequal structure role of labeled nodes in the topology, by down-weighting close-to-boundary labeled nodes.\nNevertheless, most studies root from a node-centric perspective and aim to address the imbalance by node/class-wise reweighting or resampling.\nIn this paper, we approach the source of the class-imbalance bias from an under-explored topology-centric perspective, and therefore can further boost existing node-centric techniques. GNN with heterophilic/long-distance propagation.\nThere have been many discussions on mining from heterophilic graphs 8  [ref]8 6 and learning with multi-hop propagations [ref]11  3 in the literature.\nHeterophilic GNNs usually combine intermediate representations to get better structure-aware features 8.\nThe recent work GPR-GNN [ref]8 further assigns learnable weights to combine the representations of each layer adaptively via the Generalized PageRank (GPR) technique.\nFor learning with multi-hop propagation, PPNP [ref]11 is a representative method that adopts personalized PageRank to leverage information from a larger neighborhood.\nHowever, these works specifically focus on handling the globaly heterophilic graph/long-distance propagation by modifying GNN architecture 8 [ref]8 or aggregation operators [ref]11 , and these problems were considered to be orthogonal to IGL.\nIn this work, we present the first study on the impact of AMP and DMP in the context of IGL, and jointly handle them with a model-agnostic augmentation framework that is compatible with other GNN backbones and IGL techniques.\nEmpirical results show that our method can also significantly boost the performance of such advanced GNNs [ref]8 [ref]11 in various IGL tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: .\nExisting solutions for class-imbalanced learning can be categorized into four groups:\nResampling methods balance the training set by either discarding majority    or synthesizing minority samples [ref]6 .\nEnsemble techniques    train multiple classifiers with various balancing strategies and combine them for inference.\nPost-hoc correction     compensates for minority classes by adjusting the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
