      "content": "Paper Title: Abstract\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRational analysis involves understanding human cognition as a rational adaptation to environmental structure and it is extended by resource-rational analysis which aims to explain why people may choose to adopt particular goals or heuristics in view of their cognitive resources . People‚Äôs cognitive strategies are jointly shaped by the environment and computational constraints when planning strategies to complete a task . Maisto et¬†al. [ref]36 proposes that, during planning, intermediate goals are selected to minimise the computational Kolmogorov complexity. Resource-rational task decomposition, which reduces the computational overhead of planning at a primitive action level, is consistent with elements of previous studies on human planning . Ho et¬†al. conducted trials of candidates navigating a simple gridworld through a variety of obstacles to reach a goal which demonstrates that people plan by constructing a simplified mental representation of the task environment . Here we propose a complementary interpretation, where making use of segmentation by incorporating interim goals one reduces informational costs of the individual infodesic routes. In our context, consider the classical mountaineering techniques known as ‚Äúaiming off‚Äù and ‚Äúhandrailing‚Äù [ref]29, which are often combined in poor visibility. Aiming off entails subgoaling in the form of deliberately aiming away from the intended goal instead of trying to walk on an exact bearing, for example, aiming due East of the goal. Handrailing is when the mountain leader walks along a feature of the landscape, i.e. a cliff, fence, etc., this provides robust and cognitively cheap navigation. For example, an interim goal is selected which is known to be due East along a fence from the actual intended destination. The mountain leader aims off to the interim goal which is known to be due East of the final goal, arriving at this interim goal, one then knows the final goal is due West along the fence. The mountain leader then handrails the fence to arrive at the final destination. This task decomposition enables a person to benefit from a reduction in the information processing required due to the structure of the environment, i.e.¬†an epistemic strategy: physical actions ‚Äúthat [make] mental computation easier, faster or more reliable‚Äù . When segmenting an infodesic, one decomposes the original problem into\nsubproblems with given subgoals. The constituent free energies for\nthese subgoals utilise different policies. In the deterministic case\nwith greedy value optimisation (Œ≤‚Üí‚àû‚ÜíùõΩ\\beta\\to\\infty), no state will be\nrevisited twice throughout a trajectory. This means that we can always\nconstruct a superpolicy for the overall goal-seeking behaviour by\nintegrating the respective subpolicies and policy-switching is not\nrequired. Even if we consider lower Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta values, whenever there is\nno ambiguity about which subpolicy applies at which state, i.e.¬†no\noverlapping of the support for the different policies, the validity of\nthe triangle inequality for free energy can be upheld, as shown in the\ntheorem presented in S9.\nHowever, when we reduce Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta, policies typically become\nincreasingly stochastic to reduce the divergence from the action\nmarginal. At some point, the stochastic trajectories belonging to\ndifferent subgoals will begin to overlap en route: the agent may visit the same state during different segments of the infodesic, and therefore under different policies. At the given state it is thus now no longer uniquely resolvable without further information which of the subsegment policies is currently active. As we have shown, although without taking any switching costs into\naccount, this enables the agent to benefit from informationally more\nefficient policies, having an advantage over single policies by\nbetter making use of the structure of the environment (similar to\ntemporal abstractions in  and subgoaling in\n2). For instance, as can be seen in the example shown\nin Fig. 5B, by moving to the corner\nopposite the goal, the agent aligns all future actions with the\nmarginalised action distribution thereby reducing the cost of\ninformation processing even while incorporating the sequence ‚ü®#‚Äã0,#‚Äã6,#‚Äã12,#‚Äã18‚ü©#0#6#12#18\\langle\\#0,\\#6,\\#12,\\#18\\rangle. To ascertain which is cognitively\ncheaper will require a more thorough understanding of the switching\ncosts. It is possible that there are cases when it may be cheaper to\nuse multiple policies even when taking the switching costs into account.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: in view of their cognitive resources .
