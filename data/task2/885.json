      "content": "Paper Title: EI-MTD: Moving Target Defense for Edge Intelligence against Adversarial Attacks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAn adversarial attack is to produce adversarial examples that lead to misclassiﬁcation when added some well-designed perturbations to the benign inputs. Recent literature has proposed multiple methods of crafting adversarial examples for DNNs , , [ref]16, , . The process of crafting adversarial examples is usually formalized as an optimization problem based on gradients. FGSM  generates adversarial examples with a single gradient step. Later, the basic iterative method called I-FGSM [ref]25 improved upon FGSM was proposed, which takes multiple, smaller FGSM steps, ultimately rendering both FGSM-based adversarial training ineffective [ref]25. The PGD attack is considered as the strongest ﬁrst-order attack that uses first-order gradient descent to ﬁnd adversarial examples [ref]16. The methods to generate these adversarial examples often rely on the gradient of loss functions, such as FGSM , I-FGSM [ref]25, and M-DI2-FGSM , etc. Early on, researchers noticed that adversarial examples computed against one DNN are likely to be misclassiﬁed by other DNNs , [ref]10. This phenomenon is termed transferability that serves as the basis of black-box attacks. The accepted explanation for the transferability phenomenon is that the gradients (which are used to compute adversarial examples) of each DNN are good approximators of those of other DNNs [ref]10, . Previous methods assume adversarial data can be directly fed into deep neural networks. However, in many applications, people can only pass data through devices (e.g., cameras, sensors). Kurakin et al. applied adversarial examples to the physical world [ref]25. Eykholt et al. [a48] attack a vehicle vision system by modifying a stop sign as a speed limit sign. Sharif et al.  attack a state-of-the-art face-recognition algorithm through printing a pair of eyeglass frames. Hence, adversarial attacks become a real thread to edge intelligence.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: examples that lead to misclassiﬁcation when added some well-designed perturbations to the benign inputs.
