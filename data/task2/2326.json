Case I: Variance of Reward-To-Go.

Equation 17 implies that Hπsubscript𝐻𝜋H_{\\pi} is the mean of the accumulation of signal C​(s,a)=r​(s,a)2+2​γ​𝔼​[Qπ​(s′,a′)|s,a]𝐶𝑠𝑎𝑟superscript𝑠𝑎22𝛾𝔼delimited-[]conditionalsubscript𝑄𝜋superscript𝑠′superscript𝑎′𝑠𝑎C(s,a)=r(s,a)^{2}+2\\gamma\\mathbb{E}[Q_{\\pi}(s^{\\prime},a^{\\prime})|s,a] with discounted factor γ2superscript𝛾2\\gamma^{2}. Since C​(s,a)𝐶𝑠𝑎C(s,a) is a function of the reward r​(s,a)𝑟𝑠𝑎r(s,a) and value function Qπ​(s,a)subscript𝑄𝜋𝑠𝑎Q_{\\pi}(s,a), we consider the joint vector of Qπsubscript𝑄𝜋Q_{\\pi} and Hπsubscript𝐻𝜋H_{\\pi} as Gπsubscript𝐺𝜋G_{\\pi}, i.e., Gπ=[Qπ⊤,Hπ⊤]⊤subscript𝐺𝜋superscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑄top𝜋subscriptsuperscript𝐻top𝜋topG_{\\pi}=[Q^{\\top}_{\\pi},H^{\\top}_{\\pi}]^{\\top}. We have that Gπsubscript𝐺𝜋G_{\\pi} satisfies the general Bellman equation in eq. 3 with B𝐵B and Mπsubscript𝑀𝜋M_{\\pi} specified as We consider the setting in which reward is bounded, i.e., r​(s,a)≤CR𝑟𝑠𝑎subscript𝐶𝑅r(s,a)\\leq C_{R} for all (s,a)∈𝒮×𝒜𝑠𝑎𝒮𝒜(s,a)\\in\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}. Case II: Gradient of Q-function. Suppose that the policy is parametrized by a smooth function πwsubscript𝜋𝑤\\pi_{w}, in which w∈ℝdw𝑤superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑤w\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{w}} is the parameter. Then the gradient ∇wQπ​(s,a)subscript∇𝑤subscript𝑄𝜋𝑠𝑎\\nabla_{w}Q_{\\pi}(s,a) of the Q-function w.r.t w𝑤w plays an important role in several RL applications such as variance reduced policy gradient  and on- and off-policy policy optimization [ref]56   [ref]5. Specifically, [ref]56  [ref]5 show that ∇wQπsubscript∇𝑤subscript𝑄𝜋\\nabla_{w}Q_{\\pi} satisfies: where ∇wΠπw∈ℝdw​|𝒮|​|𝒜|subscript∇𝑤subscriptΠsubscript𝜋𝑤superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑤𝒮𝒜\\nabla_{w}{\\rm\\Pi}_{\\pi_{w}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{w}|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|} is obtained by stacking ∇wlog⁡(π​(s,a))subscript∇𝑤𝜋𝑠𝑎\\nabla_{w}\\log(\\pi(s,a)) over 𝒮×𝒜𝒮𝒜\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}, i.e., [∇wΠπw]​(s,a)=∇wlog⁡(πw​(s,a))delimited-[]subscript∇𝑤subscriptΠsubscript𝜋𝑤𝑠𝑎subscript∇𝑤subscript𝜋𝑤𝑠𝑎[\\nabla_{w}{\\rm\\Pi}_{\\pi_{w}}](s,a)=\\nabla_{w}\\log(\\pi_{w}(s,a)), and [∇wΠπw⋅Qπ]∈ℝdw​|𝒮|​|𝒜|delimited-[]subscript∇𝑤⋅subscriptΠsubscript𝜋𝑤subscript𝑄𝜋superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑤𝒮𝒜[\\nabla_{w}{\\rm\\Pi}_{\\pi_{w}}\\cdot Q_{\\pi}]\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{w}|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|} is element-wise product between ∇wΠπwsubscript∇𝑤subscriptΠsubscript𝜋𝑤\\nabla_{w}{\\rm\\Pi}_{\\pi_{w}} and Qπsubscript𝑄𝜋Q_{\\pi}, i.e., [∇wΠπw⋅Qπ]​(s,a)=∇wlog⁡(πw​(s,a))​Qπ​(s,a)delimited-[]subscript∇𝑤⋅subscriptΠsubscript𝜋𝑤subscript𝑄𝜋𝑠𝑎subscript∇𝑤subscript𝜋𝑤𝑠𝑎subscript𝑄𝜋𝑠𝑎[\\nabla_{w}{\\rm\\Pi}_{\\pi_{w}}\\cdot Q_{\\pi}](s,a)=\\nabla_{w}\\log(\\pi_{w}(s,a))Q_{\\pi}(s,a). Equation 23 implies that ∇wQπsubscript∇𝑤subscript𝑄𝜋\\nabla_{w}Q_{\\pi} is the mean of the accumulation of signal C​(s,a)=γ​𝔼​[Qπ​(s′,a′)​∇wlog⁡(πw​(s′,a′))|s,a]𝐶𝑠𝑎𝛾𝔼delimited-[]conditionalsubscript𝑄𝜋superscript𝑠′superscript𝑎′subscript∇𝑤subscript𝜋𝑤superscript𝑠′superscript𝑎′𝑠𝑎C(s,a)=\\gamma\\mathbb{E}[Q_{\\pi}(s^{\\prime},a^{\\prime})\\nabla_{w}\\log(\\pi_{w}(s^{\\prime},a^{\\prime}))|s,a] with the discounted factor γ𝛾\\gamma. Let Gπ=[Qπ⊤,∇wQ⊤]⊤subscript𝐺𝜋superscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑄top𝜋subscript∇𝑤superscript𝑄toptopG_{\\pi}=[Q^{\\top}_{\\pi},\\nabla_{w}Q^{\\top}]^{\\top}. We have that Gπsubscript𝐺𝜋G_{\\pi} satisfies the general Bellman equation in eq. 3 with B𝐵B and Mπsubscript𝑀𝜋M_{\\pi} specified as where diag​(∇wΠπw)∈ℝdw​|𝒮|​|𝒜|×|𝒮|​|𝒜|diagsubscript∇𝑤subscriptΠsubscript𝜋𝑤superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑤𝒮𝒜𝒮𝒜{\\rm diag}(\\nabla_{w}{{\\rm\\Pi}}_{\\pi_{w}})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{w}|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|\\times|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|} is obtained by arranging ∇wlog⁡(π​(s,a))∈ℝdwsubscript∇𝑤𝜋𝑠𝑎superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑤\\nabla_{w}\\log(\\pi(s,a))\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{w}} diagonally. Without loss of generality, we assume that the score function is bounded   , i.e., ‖∇wlog⁡(πw​(s,a))‖2≤CΠsubscriptnormsubscript∇𝑤subscript𝜋𝑤𝑠𝑎2subscript𝐶Π\\left\\|\\nabla_{w}\\log(\\pi_{w}(s,a))\\right\\|_{2}\\leq C_{\\rm\\Pi} for all (s,a)∈𝒮×𝒜𝑠𝑎𝒮𝒜(s,a)\\in\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}. Case III: Stochastic Value Gradient. The stochastic value gradient (SVG) method combines advantages of model-based and model-free methods, in which both the estimated model and value function are updated to evaluate the policy gradient . In the framework of SVG, the reward r​(s,a)𝑟𝑠𝑎r(s,a) is differentiable with respect to both s∈ℝds𝑠superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑠s\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}} an a∈ℝda𝑎superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑎a\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{a}}, the stochastic policy takes the form a=π​(s,w)+η𝑎𝜋𝑠𝑤𝜂a=\\pi(s,w)+\\eta, and the transition probability is modelled as s′=f​(s,a)+ξsuperscript𝑠′𝑓𝑠𝑎𝜉s^{\\prime}=f(s,a)+\\xi, where π:𝒮→𝒜:𝜋→𝒮𝒜\\pi:\\mathcal{S}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{A} and f:𝒮×𝒜→𝒮:𝑓→𝒮𝒜𝒮f:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{S} are deterministic mappings, w∈ℝdw𝑤superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑤w\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{w}} is the policy parameter, and η∼P​(η)similar-to𝜂𝑃𝜂\\eta\\sim P(\\eta) and ξ∼P​(ξ)similar-to𝜉𝑃𝜉\\xi\\sim P(\\xi) are noise variables. We abbreviate the partial differentiation using subscripts as gx≜∂g/∂x≜subscript𝑔𝑥𝑔𝑥g_{x}\\triangleq\\partial g/\\partial x. The gradient of the Q𝑄Q-function w.r.t the policy parameter w𝑤w is given by  where Rs∈ℝds​|𝒮|​|𝒜|subscript𝑅𝑠superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑠𝒮𝒜R_{s}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|} and Ra∈ℝda​|𝒮|​|𝒜|subscript𝑅𝑎superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑎𝒮𝒜R_{a}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{a}|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|} are vectors obtained via stacking partial derivatives rs​(s,a)∈ℝdssubscript𝑟𝑠𝑠𝑎superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑠r_{s}(s,a)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}} and ra​(s,a)∈ℝdasubscript𝑟𝑎𝑠𝑎superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑎r_{a}(s,a)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{a}} over (s,a)∈𝒮×𝒜𝑠𝑎𝒮𝒜(s,a)\\in\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}, and Πs=diag​(πs)∈ℝds​|𝒮|​|𝒜|×da​|𝒮|​|𝒜|subscriptΠ𝑠diagsubscript𝜋𝑠superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑠𝒮𝒜subscript𝑑𝑎𝒮𝒜{\\rm\\Pi}_{s}={\\rm diag}(\\pi_{s})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|\\times d_{a}|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|}, Πw=diag​(πw)∈ℝdw​|𝒮|​|𝒜|×da​|𝒮|​|𝒜|subscriptΠ𝑤diagsubscript𝜋𝑤superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑤𝒮𝒜subscript𝑑𝑎𝒮𝒜{\\rm\\Pi}_{w}={\\rm diag}(\\pi_{w})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{w}|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|\\times d_{a}|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|}, Fs=diag​(fs)∈ℝds​|𝒮|​|𝒜|×ds​|𝒮|​|𝒜|subscript𝐹𝑠diagsubscript𝑓𝑠superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑠𝒮𝒜subscript𝑑𝑠𝒮𝒜F_{s}={\\rm diag}(f_{s})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|\\times d_{s}|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|}, and Fa=diag​(fa)∈ℝda​|𝒮|​|𝒜|×ds​|𝒮|​|𝒜|subscript𝐹𝑎diagsubscript𝑓𝑎superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑎𝒮𝒜subscript𝑑𝑠𝒮𝒜F_{a}={\\rm diag}(f_{a})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{a}|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|\\times d_{s}|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|} are Jacobian matrices.\nConsider GVF defined as Gπ=[Qs⊤,Qa⊤,∇wQπ⊤]⊤subscript𝐺𝜋superscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑄top𝑠subscriptsuperscript𝑄top𝑎subscript∇𝑤subscriptsuperscript𝑄top𝜋topG_{\\pi}=[Q^{\\top}_{s},Q^{\\top}_{a},\\nabla_{w}Q^{\\top}_{\\pi}]^{\\top}.
