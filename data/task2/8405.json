      "content": "Paper Title: Correspondence and Inverse Correspondence for Input/Output Logic and Region-Based Theories of Space\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince its inception , the literature on input/output logic has striven to devise syntactic and computational characterizations of the sets of obligations and compatible permissions logically deducible from a given set of conditional norms; moreover, since its inception, establishing explicit connections between input/output frameworks and modal logic frameworks, e.g. via embeddings and translations, has been regarded as a possible route for achieving this aim. However, modal embeddings into deontic logic have proven to be highly dependent on the specific definitions of certain outputs, and hence not uniformly available, highly nonmodular, and technically challenging (cf. ). Very recently, modular sequent calculi for input/output logics have been introduced  for the four original outputs of  and of their causal counterparts introduced in , as well as helping to establish complexity bounds, and define possible worlds semantics\nand formal embeddings into normal modal logics, leading to formally explicit modal characterizations of the output operators mentioned above. The modal characterization results in  are very similar to those of Section 3, which hold for a class of modal axioms encompassing the analytic inductive axioms ([38, Definition 55], see also Section 7). In , analytic inductive axioms have been characterized as those axioms which can be equivalently transformed into rules which preserve cut elimination when added to a calculus with cut elimination. We are presently exploring the possibility of applying the results of the present paper in the modular design of proof calculi with good computational properties for classes of input/output logics. The availability of this uniform proof theoretic framework might be particularly useful vis-à-vis the recent convergence between input/output logic and formal argumentation theory  [ref]15.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: logics. The availability of this uniform proof theoretic framework might be particularly useful vis-à-vis the recent convergence between input/output logic and formal argumentation theory  [ref]15.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
