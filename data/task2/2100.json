      "content": "Paper Title: Heuristic-Guided Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe horizon-truncation idea can be traced back to Blackwell optimality in the known MDP setting .\nReducing the discount factor amounts to running HuRL with a zero heuristic.\nPetrik and Scherrer , Jiang et al.   study the MDP setting; Chen et al.  study POMDPs. Amit et al.  focus on discount regularization for Temporal Difference (TD) methods, while Van Seijen et al. [ref]6 use a logarithmic mapping to lower the discount for online RL. Reward shaping has a long history in RL, from the seminal PBRS work  to recent bilevel-optimization approaches . Tessler and Mannor  consider a complementary problem to HuRL: given a discount γ′superscript𝛾′\\gamma^{\\prime}, they find a reward r′superscript𝑟′r^{\\prime} that preserves trajectory ordering in the original MDP.\nMeanwhile there is a vast literature on bias-variance trade-off for online RL with horizon truncation. TD(λ𝜆\\lambda) [ref]39 [ref]40 and Generalized Advantage Estimates  blend value estimates across discount factors, while Sherstan et al.  use the discount factor as an input to the value function estimator. TD(ΔΔ\\Delta)  computes differences between value functions across discount factors. Classic uses of heuristics include A* , Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) , and Model Predictive Control (MPC) .\nZhong et al.  shorten the horizon in MPC using a value function approximator.\nHoeller et al.  additionally use an estimate for the running cost to trade off solution quality and amount of computation.\nBejjani et al.  show heuristic-accelerated truncated-horizon MPC on actual robots and tune the value function throughout learning.\nBhardwaj et al.  augment MPC with a terminal value heuristic, which can be viewed as an instance of HuRL where the base algorithm is MPC.\nAsai and Muise  learn an MDP expressible in the STRIPS formalism that can benefit from relaxation-based planning heuristics.\nBut HuRL is more general, as it does not assume model knowledge and can work in unknown environments. Offline RL techniques employ pessimistic extrapolation for robustness , and their learned value functions can be used as heuristics in HuRL.\nKumar et al.  penalize out-of-distribution actions in off-policy optimization while Liu et al.  additionally use a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to detect out-of-distribution states. We experimented with VAE-filtered pessimistic heuristics in Appendix C.\nEven pessimistic offline evaluation techniques  can be useful in HuRL, since function approximation often induces extrapolation errors . Our concept of heuristic pessimism can be easily confused for the well-established notion of admissibility , but in fact they are opposites. Namely, an admissible heuristic never underestimates V∗superscript𝑉V^{*} (in the return-maximization setting), while a pessimistic one never overestimates V∗superscript𝑉V^{*}. Similarly, our notion of improvability is distinct from consistency: they express related ideas, but with regards to pessimistic and admissible value functions, respectively. Thus, counter-intuitively from the planning perspective, our work shows that for policy learning, inadmissible heuristics are desirable. Pearl  is one of the few works that has analyzed desirable implications of heuristic inadmissibility in planning.\n HuRL is a new way to warm-start online RL methods.\nBianchi et al. 0 use a heuristic policy to initialize agents’ policies.\nHester et al. , Vinyals et al.  train a value function and policy using batch IL and then used them as regularization in online RL. Nair et al.  use off-policy RL on batch data and fine-tune the learned policy. Recent approaches of hybrid IL-RL have strong connections to HuRL 1  2.\nIn particular, Cheng et al.  is a special case of HuRL with a max-aggregation heuristic.\nFarahmand et al.  use several related tasks to learn a task-dependent heuristic\nand perform shorter-horizon planning or RL. Knowledge distillation approaches 3 can also be used to warm-start learning, but in contrast to them, HuRL expects prior knowledge in the form of state value estimates, not features, and doesn’t attempt to make the agent internalize this knowledge. A\nHuRL agent learns from its own environment interactions, using prior knowledge only as guidance. Reverse Curriculum approaches 4 create short horizon RL problems by initializing the agent close to the goal, and moving it further away as the agent improves. This gradual increase in the horizon inspires the HuRL approach. However, HuRL does not require the agent to be initialized on expert states and can work with many different base RL algorithms.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: and Scherrer , Jiang et al.   study the MDP setting; Chen et al.  study POMDPs. Amit et al.  focus on discount regularization for Temporal Difference (TD) methods, while Van Seijen et al. [ref]6 use a logarithmic mapping to lower the discount for online RL.
