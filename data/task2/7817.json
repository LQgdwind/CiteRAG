      "content": "Paper Title: Synthesis of Temporal Causality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCausality is a key ingredient for explaining model-checking results  [ref]15   and a reasoning tool in several verification and synthesis algorithms   . These techniques have retrofitted causality definitions from philosophy   and artificial intelligence [ref]30, which were not designed for reactive systems with infinite dynamics and often fall short in such ad-hoc applications. For instance,\npopular approaches for explaining model-checking results highlight the counterexample trace at events that constitute causes   . Yet, marking a (possibly infinite) set of events does not clearly describe\nthe temporal behavior manifested by them since, e.g., two events can be individually responsible for the effect or only together. Similarly, the occurrence of events in the loop part of a trace can be relevant, e.g., only once or infinitely often. To address such reoccurring problems arising with causal reasoning in reactive systems, Coenen et al. have recently proposed temporal causality for drawing causal relationships between temporal properties on a given trace of a system [ref]19. Causal properties can then be described symbolically with logics or automata, which give a concise description of the possibly infinite causal behavior, and are, moreover, amenable to verification algorithms.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: Causality is a key ingredient for explaining model-checking results  [ref]15   and a reasoning tool in several verification and synthesis algorithms   .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
