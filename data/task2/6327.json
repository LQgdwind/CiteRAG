      "content": "Paper Title: Augmenting Zero-Shot Detection Training with Image Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject detectors for real world applications should be able to recognize a large amount of different classes. But in the conventional approach of object detection, every single class the detector should recognize has to be already represented in the training data set. This approach is quite limiting since not every one of these classes is known beforehand. This limitation becomes especially apparent due to the fact that commonly used object detection data sets are quite limited in the amount of different classes.\nZero-shot detection (ZSD) [ref]1 aims to overcome this limitation. The goal is to train the detector on a given set of classes (seen classes), but then be able to not only recognize the seen classes, but also classes that are not present during training (unseen classes). This way, zero-shot detectors are not limited to the classes the model was trained on.\nOne way to do ZSD is to use an embedding space to get a correspondence between images and labels. To make a classification prediction, a model using this approach predicts an embedding vector instead of directly predicting class probabilities. The correspondence through the embedding space can then be used to relate the embedding vector to the class prediction. This way, these models are no longer restricted by the number of classes, only by the expressiveness of the embedding space and how well the model is aligned to it. Recent ZSD models are often trained on either the 48/17 COCO split [ref]1 or the 65/15 COCO split , meaning that only 48 and 65 classes are used for training, respectively. Therefore we believe that the alignment to the embedding space can be improved by presenting a larger variety of object categories.\nOne way how conventional object detection can be improved is to incorporate image classification data into the object detection training pipeline .\nThis way, the detector is able to detect a larger amount of object categories. But since this approach is proposed for conventional object detectors, class probabilities are predicted directly and the model is therefore still limited to the classes it was trained on.\nIn this paper, we use the idea to augment the training of an object detector with image classification data and apply it to the task of ZSD. Similar to previous work, we change the head of a single-stage detector, e.g., YOLOX [ref]7, to predict embedding vectors instead of class probabilities. We then align our model to the CLIP  embedding space by training on the 65/15 COCO split . Moreover, we augment the training with ImageNet1000 [ref]31 classification data to improve the alignment of our model to the CLIP embedding space. We show that this improves the performance of our model significantly. Furthermore, we propose an unseen/seen split for ImageNet1000, since using images from ImageNet that are part of unseen COCO classes would violate the ZSD setup.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: beforehand.
