      "content": "Paper Title: Catch Me If You Can: Semi-supervised Graph Learning for Spotting Money Laundering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral methods have been proposed to accurately identify AML activities . The earliest approaches predominantly relied on rule-based classification. For example, Rajput et al.  developed an ontology-based expert system to detect suspicious transactions. However, rule-based algorithms are easy to be evaded by fraudsters . Therefore, graph and ML-based approaches have emerged. Michalak et al.  used fuzzy matching to capture subgraphs that are more likely to contain suspicious accounts involved in fraudulent activities. A few other approaches tried to assess if the capital flow is involved in money laundering activities using radial basis function (RBF) neural networks calculating w.r.t time-to-times . From a graph of money transfers between accounts, existing approaches attempted to detect money laundering activities by employing a variety of methods starting from simple logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM) , random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) to more sophisticated approach that are based on GNNs [ref]3. Some earlier approaches   employed a clustering-based method to detect money laundering activities by grouping transactions into clusters. Soltani et al.  proposed a money laundering detection algorithm. This structural similarity-based approach finds pairs of transactions with common attributes and behaviours that potentially involve money laundering activities. Money laundering usually involves high-volume flows of funds through chains of bank accounts . However, approaches that employ structural and behavioural dynamics of dense subgraph detection do not take it into account . Methods that do not perform flow tracking, yield lower detection accuracy and hence cannot provide theoretical guarantees, while the flow across multiple nodes is important for accuracy and robustness against camouflage in the money laundering activities . However, real-world data is typically either unlabeled, or has noisy, or sparse labels, whereas these algorithms detect money laundering activities in a supervised manner, suffering from highly skewed labels and limited adaptability. Further, money laundering activities often involve cash flow relationships between entities, i.e., network structures . Therefore, some approaches model the transactions in the form of multipartite graphs to detect the complete flow of money from source to destination  in an unsupervised manner based on graphs. In particular, FlowScope  is a flow-based approach for detecting money laundering behaviour to detect the chains of transactions. A knowledge graph (KG) can be formed in a similar fashion, where nodes represent entities and edges represent binary relations between those entities [ref]13. More formally, 𝒢={E,R,T}𝒢𝐸𝑅𝑇\\mathcal{G}=\\{E,R,T\\}, where 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is a labelled and directed multi-graph, and E,R,T𝐸𝑅𝑇E,R,T are the sets of entities, relations, and triples, respectively. Each triple555The notation <head,relation,tail><head,relation,tail> is called resource description framework (RDF) - a W3C standard for serializing data. in the KG can be formalized as (h,r,t)∈Tℎ𝑟𝑡𝑇(h,r,t)\\in T, where h∈Eℎ𝐸h\\in E is the head node, t∈E𝑡𝐸t\\in E is the tail node, and r∈R𝑟𝑅r\\in R is the edge connecting hℎh and t𝑡t (i.e., the relation r𝑟r holds between hℎh and t𝑡t) [ref]13. Recently, graph analytics techniques on such KGs have emerged as an increasingly important means for AML analysis. In particular, GNN architectures such as graph convolutional networks (GCN) , GraphSAGE [ref]14, and FastGCN  have emerged , showing efficiency and scalability in graph-based representation learning  . The reason is that in low-labelled dataset scenarios, unsupervised techniques can learn low-dimensional meaningful representations of nodes by leveraging the graph structure and features. An unsupervised GE model learns embeddings of unlabeled graph nodes. Further, literature has shown that the inclusion of non-local information – specifically information about the neighbours of a centre node always improves the performance of each model, non-graph-based models mostly benefit from using additional features given by a GE model. This makes graph learning-based approaches quite promising due to their ability to understand complex patterns and feature discovery capabilities. Generating quality feature vectors using appropriate graph embedding (GE) methods play a significant role in any downstream learning task. Numerous GE methods have been proposed to date [ref]3. A GE technique aims to map a KG into a dense, low-, feature space, which is capable of preserving as much structure and property information of the graph as possible and aiding in calculations of the entities and relations. A GE model consists of three steps: representing entities and relations, defining a scoring function, and learning entity and relation representation . Translation-based embedding techniques such as TransD  and TransE  are the earliest embedding methods that represent the neighbourhood of nodes as well as the kind of relations that exist to the neighbouring nodes. Using translation-based embedding methods, embeddings are generated by treating relations as translations from the head entity to the tail entity . Embeddings are created such that 𝐡​⨁𝐫≈𝐭𝐡direct-sum𝐫𝐭\\mathbf{h}\\bigoplus\\mathbf{r}\\approx\\mathbf{t}, by preserving a proximity measure defined on graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}666The ⨁direct-sum\\bigoplus operator could be different w.r.t GE models.. The resultant embedding vectors for the entities and relations in in the KG are a denser and more efficient representation of the domain that can more easily be used for many downstream tasks. However, most translation-based embeddings are limited in their capacity to model complex and diverse objects, including important properties of relations, such as symmetric, transitive, one-many, many-to-one, and many-many relations in KGs . Therefore, GE methods such as RDF2Vec, SimpleIE , KGloVe , and CrossE  have been proposed. On the other hand, the GraphSAGE model learns embeddings of unlabeled graph nodes by leveraging the graph structure and features of the nodes. Being an inductive embedding technique, GraphSAGE allows extracting embeddings of unseen nodes, without the need to re-training. Unlike another embedding model such as Node2Vec which learns a look-up table of node embeddings instead of training individual embeddings for each node, GraphSAGE learns a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating attributes from each node’s local neighbourhood and combines those with the node’s own attributes [ref]14. As real-life transaction network graphs are large-scale, some works were published with a view on scalability. In particular, FastGCN outperformed GCN and GraphSAGE in various benchmark datasets by as much as two orders of magnitude without sacrificing accuracy . Weber et al.  trained GCN and FastGCN models on a large synthetic graph of 1 million nodes and 9 million edges. Although the GCN model significantly outperformed LR, the RF model turns out to be the best classifier, even outperforming the GCN. Another recent work  using a two-layer GCN model on a real transaction graph called Elliptic from Bitcoin blockchain, shows that the GCN model outperforms linear models like LR, comparable to MLP, but underperforms in comparison with RF. They showed that the inclusion of non-local information – specifically information about the neighbours of a centre node always improves the performance of each model. The majority of these models take into consideration only spatial information, thereby largely ignoring temporal information. However, transaction graphs are dynamic, where each transaction has an associated timestamp. To learn knowledge from such a dynamic graph, EvolveGCN  is proposed to extract node embeddings by coupling both spatial- and temporal information. EvolveGCN evolves along the temporal axis, where a recurrent neural network (RNN) is used for evolving the GCN model’s parameters. EvolveGCN is flexible for modelling temporal data since it is not reliant on node embeddings. Dynamic graph transformer (DGT)  is another approach in which the transformer model is composed of two modules: the transformer and the pooling. The transformer module captures the cross-domain knowledge by the attention mechanism, where the final attention layer generates the informative node embeddings.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: of methods starting from simple logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM) , random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) to more sophisticated approach that are based on GNNs [ref]3.
