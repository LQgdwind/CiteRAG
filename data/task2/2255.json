      "content": "Paper Title: Continual Learning via Inter-Task Synaptic Mapping\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nContinual learning aims to emulate the underlying trait of natural learning to learn various tasks on the fly without losing competence for what has been achieved in the past [ref]1  . Ideally, already owned skill should ease the learning process of different-but-related tasks in the future. This problem appears as an extension of data stream learning  where a learner must not only demonstrate adaptive and evolving aptitudes to handle non-stationary environments but also possess the knowledge retention property such that it gains more intelligence as the increase of tasks being learned [ref]5. The underlying challenge of continual learning lies in the catastrophic forgetting problem where learning a new task catastrophically replaces old knowledge with new one thereby losing its relevance to handle old tasks. The regularization approach [ref]5  is among several well-known methods to resolve the catastrophic forgetting problem of the continual learning  [ref]5 . The key idea is to prevent important parameters from being perturbed by learning a new task. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)  is one pioneering work in this area where the unique trait is seen in the application of Fisher information matrix to construct the parameter importance matrix while integrating the L-2 norm like regularization approach [ref]5 . The synaptic intelligence (SI) method is proposed to address expensive computation of parameter importance matrix via the Fisher information matrix . The accumulation of loss for every training sample is used to inform the significance of each synaptic. This work has been extended in  called onlineEWC using the Laplace approximation. The learning without forgetting (LWF) approach is slightly different where it uses a joint optimization procedure between the cross entropy loss of current task and the knowledge distillation loss [ref]9. It is later found that the knowledge distillation loss can be replaced by the cross-entropy loss [ref]9. Memory Aware Synapses (MAS) is a regularization-based approach where the importance of network parameters are calculated in an unsupervised and online manner. Another prominent work is proposed in  where the regularization mechanism is performed in the neuron level instead of the synaptic level by measuring neuron importance and governing learning rates. The main limitation of these approaches lies in the absence of inter-task relationship where a new task might share some commonalities to previous tasks. That is, a neuron might still accept new information or even contribute to understand the current task. Since a new task is embraced by those which do not contribute too much to the previous tasks, one should guarantee enough network capacity to handle all tasks otherwise new synapses have to be grown. Another challenge also exists in scaling the parameter importance matrix which can quickly explode in the large-scale problems thus causing the unlearning effect since it has to be accumulated across all tasks  unless an independent parameter importance matrix has to be created from scratch for every task. An Inter-Task-Synaptic-Mapping (ISYANA) is proposed here to address the catastrophic forgetting problem of the continual learning. ISYANA is built upon the task-to-synapses and task-to-task mappers. The task-to-synapses module provides a relational mapping between each hidden node and all tasks determining the acceptable type of information it can absorb. The task-to-task component exhibits the inter-task relationship thus revealing the complete problem structure and the commonalities of each task. This module is capable of providing a sort of neighborhood degree of a sample to all tasks which can be linked to the task-to-synapses module. The relationship of a sample to previous tasks is assessed by checking its proximity to previous tasks. A node is frozen by reducing its learning rate provided that it has low relevance to the current task and the current task characterizes low mutual information to the old tasks. In a nutshell, the parameter importance matrix is crafted from the combination of the task-to-task and task-to-synapses relationships. The catastrophic forgetting is handled in the neuron level due to the fact where a connective weight plays little role to a learning problem unless it is combined with other weights to construct a neuron,. i.e., hierarchical structure of a network structure. The concept-to-concept or task-to-task module is devised by the cluster guided mechanism in the deep latent space. It puts forward a meta-network crafted from an extension of the deep clustering network  . That is, a class-specific cluster is designed in the deep latent space. Note that the clustering approach is carried out fully in the per-class manners such that learning a new task should not disturb the representation of old tasks. The concept-to-concept module applies the growing and consolidation phases. The growing phase constructs a set of clusters describing the current task based on the class label of each task. The consolidation phase is undertaken after the growing phase by calculating the mean values of the clusters to bound the network complexity where the mean values of the clusters exhibit a complete summary of already seen data points. In other words, there does not exist any requirement to store representation layer of each task which does not sustain for large-scale problems. The inter-task similarity is calculated via the KL divergence approach among all clusters between tasks. The task-to-synapses module complements the task-to-task module where it functions as the one-to-one mapping between a neuron and a target class. It measures the mutual information of a node to each task making possible for a neuron to still accept the current concept notwithstanding that it is highly relevant to previously seen tasks. In short, a node can be shared by different but related tasks. All of which can be done in the online fashion without being prone to the issue of exploding parameter importance matrix thereby improving its feasibility for a high number of tasks. The advantage of ISYANA has been numerically validated in benchmark continual learning problems. It is compared with the prominent continual learning algorithms where it demonstrates competitive performance compared to recently published algorithms. Codes of ISYANA is made available in https://github.com/ContinualAL/ISYANAKBS.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Continual learning aims to emulate the underlying trait of natural learning to learn various tasks on the fly without losing competence for what has been achieved in the past [ref]1  .
