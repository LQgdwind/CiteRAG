      "content": "Paper Title: CPSAA: Accelerating Sparse Attention using Crossbar-based Processing-In-Memory Architecture\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTable I lists the recent studies of the attention mechanism. Different from SANGER’s classification, we divide these works into three categories, i.e., software-based, software-hardware co-design, and the new adding hardware-based. The software-based methods can be further divided into static and dynamic sparsity patterns. The static sparsity pattern can only get coarse-grained sparsity for data dependent [ref]2 . The dynamic sparsity pattern can achieve higher sparsity conditioned on individual input samples during runtime, but their unstructured sparsity increases the random memory access overhead  [ref]41. Software-hardware co-design methods adopt more efficient hardware, such as FPGAs and ASICs. FTRANS [ref]16 is an efficient acceleration framework for transformer-based NLP. Zhang et al. propose a novel pruning method and design the FPGA-based sparse attention accelerator . A3  can accelerate the attention mechanism with algorithmic approximation and hardware specialization. SpAtten 2 leverages token sparsity, head sparsity, and quantization opportunities to reduce redundent computation and random access. SANGER  presents a prediction-based pruning algorithm to reduce unnecessary calculations while designing the “splitting and packing” algorithm to reduce the massive random memory access overhead. DOTA  proposes a dynamic weak connections detector to avoid unnecessary attention calculation and promote sparse attention. Although these co-design solutions can relieve the random memory access by designing hardware-specific algorithms, many off-chip data transmissions exist because of their separate memory and processor architecture. Using SANGER as an example, the “splitting and packing” algorithm can reduce random memory access by converting the unstructured sparsity to fine-grained structured sparsity. However, the benefit of the fine-grained structured sparsity comes at the cost of the dynamically configured control signals, which are highly complex to scheduling processing elements and memory access in runtime. In addition, SANGER introduces off-chip random access and data dependency to their sparsity pruning phase. Thus, no current accelerators can solve the off-chip random memory access problem elegantly. We also list current hardware-based PIM-featured dense attention accelerators in Table I. These solutions use high parallel ReRAM arrays to significantly reduce the latency of DDMM operations 6 . However, since the sparsity of the attention matrices is not considered, current PIM-based attention accelerators need to calculate all five DDMM operation steps, wasting lots of computational resources on irrelevant tokens. Therefore, how to design a PIM-based sparse attention accelerator and reducing unnecessary calculations become the key to achieve further accelerations.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: hardware-based. The software-based methods can be further divided into static and dynamic sparsity patterns. The static sparsity pattern can only get coarse-grained sparsity for data dependent [ref]2 . The dynamic sparsity pattern can achieve higher sparsity conditioned on individual input samples during runtime, but their unstructured sparsity increases the random memory access overhead\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
