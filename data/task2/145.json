      "content": "Paper Title: Sketchformer: Transformer-based Representation for Sketched Structure\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRepresentation learning for sketch has received extensive attention within the domain of visual search. Classical sketch based image retrieval (SBIR) techniques explored spectral, edge-let based, and sparse gradient features the latter building upon the success of dictionary learning based models (e.g. bag of words)   . With the advent of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were rapidly adopted to learn search embedding . Triplet loss models are commonly used for visual search in the photographic domain   1, and have been extended to SBIR. Sangkloy et al.  used a three-branch CNN with triplet loss to learn a general cross-domain embedding for SBIR. Fine-grained (within-class) SBIR was similarly explored by Yu et al. . Qi et al. 8 instead use contrastive loss to learn correspondence between sketches and pre-extracted edge maps. Bui et al.   perform cross-category retrieval using a triplet model and combined their technique with a learned model of visual aesthetics 1 to constrain SBIR using aesthetic cues in . A quadruplet loss was proposed by 5 for fine-grained SBIR. The generalization of sketch embeddings beyond training classes have also been studied  5, and parameterized for zero-shot learning . Such concepts were later applied in sketch-based shape retrieval tasks 3. Variants of CycleGAN 6 have also shown to be useful as generative models for sketch 3. Sketch-A-Net was a seminal work for sketch classification that employed a CNN with large convolutional kernels to accommodate the sparsity of stroke pixels . Recognition of partial sketches has also been explored by 4. Wang et al. 0 proposed sketch classification by sampling unordered points of a sketch image to learning a canonical order. All the above works operate over rasterized sketches e.g. converting the captured vector representation of sketch (as a sequence of strokes) to pixel form, discarding temporal order of strokes, and requiring the network to recover higher level spatial structure. Recent SBIR work has begun to directly input a vector (stroke sequence) representations for sketches 1, notably SketchRNN; an LSTM based sequence to sequence (seq2seq) variational auto-proposed by Eck et al. 2, trained on the largest public sketch corpus ‘QuickDraw!’ 9. SketchRNN embedding was incorporated in a triplet network by Xu et al. 2 to search for sketches using sketches. A variation using cascaded attention networks was proposed by 4 to improve vector sketch classification over Sketch-A-Net. Later, LiveSketch  extended SketchRNN to a triplet network to perform SBIR over tens of millions of images, harnessing the sketch embedding to suggest query improvements and guide the user via relevance feedback. The limited temporal scope of LSTM based seq2seq models can prevent such representations modeling long, complex sketches, a problem mitigated by our Transformer based model which builds upon the success shown by such architectures for language modeling 8 [ref]7 [ref]8. Transformers encode long term temporal dependencies by modeling direct connections between data units. The temporal range of such dependencies was increased via the Transformer-XL [ref]7 and BERT [ref]8, which recently set new state-of-the-art performance on sentence classification and sentence-pair regression tasks using a cross-encoder. Recent work explores transformer beyond sequence modeling to 2D images 7. Our work is first to apply these insights to the problem of sketch modeling, incorporating the Transformer architecture of Vaswani et al. 8 to deliver a multi-purpose embedding that exceeds the state of the art for several common sketch representation tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: can prevent such representations modeling long, complex sketches, a problem mitigated by our Transformer based model which builds upon the success shown by such architectures for language modeling 8 [ref]7 [ref]8.
