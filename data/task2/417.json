      "content": "Paper Title: Computationally efficient sparse clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClustering data points (X1,…,Xn)subscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑛(X_{1},\\dots,X_{n}) into homogeneous groups is a fundamental and important data processing step in statistics and machine learning. In recent years, clustering in the high-dimensional settings has seen an increasing influx of attention; see for example  for a recent review. When the dimensionality of the data points, p𝑝p, is large compared to the number of samples, n𝑛n, consistent clustering is, in general, information theoretically impossible . Consequently, traditional clustering algorithms such as Lloyd’s algorithm , spectral clustering  , SDP relaxations of k𝑘k-means , the EM algorithm  and approximate message passing  are poised to fail in this regime. To circumvent this issue, additional parsimony assumptions have to be taken into account. The prevalent approach is to assume sparsity of the cluster centres. For instance,   propose to use weighted versions of k𝑘k-means where only a small number of features are considered and chosen by ℓ1superscriptℓ1\\ell^{1}-penalization. Similarly,  and  propose to use ℓ1superscriptℓ1\\ell^{1}-penalized versions of k𝑘k-means which are computed by iterative update steps. These algorithms work well empirically, but a sound theoretical treatment of them is lacking so far. Only more recently has there been a series of papers which provide algorithms with some theoretical guarantees, considering a sparse Gaussian mixture model and extensions of it. Above the BBP transition , i.e. when p=o​(n​minj≠l⁡‖θl−θj‖4)𝑝𝑜𝑛subscript𝑗𝑙superscriptnormsubscript𝜃𝑙subscript𝜃𝑗4p=o(n\\min_{j\\neq l}\\|\\theta_{l}-\\theta_{j}\\|^{4}), it is not necessary to use the sparsity assumption. In particular, a SDP relaxation of k𝑘k-means  and Lloyd’s algorithm   have been shown to achieve minimax optimal misclustering rates. In contrast, below the BBP transition it is necessary to take the sparsity assumption into account and use modified algorithms  . For instance,  propose a high-dimensional modification of the EM-algorithm which takes sparsity into account. They show that the cluster centres are estimated at the optimal rate and give upper and lower bounds for the accuracy of predicting the label of a new observation. The same loss function is also considered in  and . Another possibility is to select the relevant features first and afterwards use a vanilla clustering algorithm such as Lloyd’s algorithm or k𝑘k-means. This approach has been analyzed in  and  . Particularly, Jin et al.  develop a precise theory for the simplified model and show in which asymptotic regimes of (p,n,ϵ,κ)𝑝𝑛italic-ϵ𝜅(p,n,\\epsilon,\\kappa) consistent clustering is possible when considering the misclustering error Moreover, Jin et al.  conjecture the existence of a computational barrier, meaning a region of parameters (p,n,ϵ,κ)𝑝𝑛italic-ϵ𝜅(p,n,\\epsilon,\\kappa) where consistent clustering is possible only when using algorithms that are not computable in polynomial time. The phenomena of such computational barriers has been recently discovered in other sparse problems too, such as sparse PCA   1  1, sparse CCA 7, sub-matrix detection , biclustering   and\nrobust sparse mean detection  [ref]7. Most relevant to the present article, 5  give evidence that detection in the sparse Gaussian mixture model is impossible in polynomial time under certain conditions which include ‖θ‖4=o​(p/n)superscriptnorm𝜃4𝑜𝑝𝑛\\|\\theta\\|^{4}=o(p/n), ‖θ‖4=o​(s2/n)superscriptnorm𝜃4𝑜superscript𝑠2𝑛\\|\\theta\\|^{4}=o(s^{2}/n), and n=o​(p)𝑛𝑜𝑝n=o(p). It seems plausible that as a consequence, clustering better than with a random guess should also be hard in this regime, but a formal proof of this intuition is missing in the literature so far. Giving some evidence in this direction, 5 present a reduction which shows that, assuming hardness of the detection problem, no polynomial-time classification rule can near-perfectly match the output of Fisher’s linear discriminant (the statistically optimal classifier) when predicting the label of a new observation. In this article we further investigate statistical and computational limits of clustering in the high-dimensional limit, extending and building on the results of  5  [ref]7. For our theoretical results we focus on the symmetric two-cluster model In particular, we show that when s2/n=o​(‖θ‖4/log⁡p)superscript𝑠2𝑛𝑜superscriptnorm𝜃4𝑝s^{2}/n=o(\\|\\theta\\|^{4}/\\log p), a simple polynomial-time algorithm based on sparse PCA, in the spirit of   , achieves the sharp exponential minimax optimal misclustering rate as ‖θ‖→∞→norm𝜃\\|\\theta\\|\\rightarrow\\infty. Notably, this rate coincides with the low-dimensional minimax rate without assuming sparsity . We give evidence based on the recently proposed low-degree likelihood ratio 5 1 3 that when p/n≥‖θ‖4​(1+Ω​(1))𝑝𝑛superscriptnorm𝜃41Ω1p/n\\geq\\|\\theta\\|^{4}(1+\\Omega(1)) (i.e., below the BBP transition) and s2/n=ω​(‖θ‖4​log⁡p​n)superscript𝑠2𝑛𝜔superscriptnorm𝜃4𝑝𝑛s^{2}/n=\\omega(\\|\\theta\\|^{4}\\log pn), no polynomial-time algorithm can distinguish the model (2) from i.i.d. Gaussian samples, corroborating and extending the existing computational lower bounds 5 . More concretely, our results imply that a large class of tests based on low-degree polynomials fail to solve the distinguishing task. We furthermore give a reduction showing that if this distinguishing problem is indeed hard, then no polynomial-time algorithm can cluster better than a random guess. This is similar in spirit to existing detection-to-recovery reductions (see e.g., Section 5.1 of  or Section 10 of ). Hence, the sample size requirement for our algorithm appears to be almost computationally optimal. One of our conceptual contributions (see Section 2.3) is to show how bounds on the low-degree likelihood ratio rigorously imply failure of polynomial-based tests for the problem of weak testing (i.e., beating a random guess). Previous results of this nature have focused only on consistent testing (where the error probability must tend to zero).\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: computational barriers has been recently discovered in other sparse problems too, such as sparse PCA   1  1, sparse CCA 7, sub-matrix detection , biclustering   and\nrobust sparse mean detection  [ref]7.
