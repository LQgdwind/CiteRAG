      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Radiance Transfer Fields for Relightable Novel-view Synthesis with Global Illumination\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInverse rendering   aims at estimating scene properties such as geometry, lighting, and materials from image observations.\nIn this work, we are particularly interested in decoupling lighting using multi-view data, and therefore focus our literature review on corresponding related work in illumination decomposition and relighting. Controllable illumination in a multi-view light stage  is conceptually the most straightforward way of obtaining a light-reflectance decomposition in the presence of global illumination, via one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) captures.\nEven though not trivial, novel-view synthesis and relighting boils down to clever interpolation   .\nIn contrast, input to our method is casually-captured multi-view data under unknown illumination, while embedding synthetic OLAT data generation into the training process to aid disentanglement. Techniques for inverse rendering from multi-view data typically impose strong assumptions on lighting and material, with shading models commonly only considering direct illumination   [ref]3 [ref]4 [ref]38  .\nDifferent scene representations have been explored in this context, including meshes  , signed distance functions (SDFs) , or neural radiance or reflectance fields   [ref]3 [ref]4 [ref]38.\nA common paradigm is the explicit reconstruction of a material representation, e.g., an albedo and roughness map, limiting them to recover appearance effects within the range of these predefined representations.\nIn contrast, our approach seeks to decompose observed color into illumination and a radiance transfer function in a surface-based scene representation, enabling relighting with intricate indirect illumination, while reconstructing materials only for supervision. Incorporating multiple light bounces into inverse rendering and relighting can be done by using heuristic lighting models  , by assuming known illumination , or by employing physically-based rendering to approximate irradiance .\nChen et al.  approximate PRT in neural rendering, given geometry, without physically-based modeling of multiple light bounces.\nThul et al.  utilize PRT in a custom optimization to perform global illumination-aware decomposition of lighting and materials, approximating the required gradients with a single-bounce model.\nIn contrast, differentiable path tracing    can be used to obtain full gradients for global illumination-aware inverse rendering  7.\nWe also leverage the concept of differentiable path tracing  during training as a means for achieving disentanglement.\nDifferent from path tracing, our performance at inference time is independent of light transport complexity and by design produces noise-free renderings of multi-bounce illumination.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Techniques for inverse rendering from multi-view data typically impose strong assumptions on lighting and material, with shading models commonly only considering direct illumination   [ref]3 [ref]4 [ref]38  .\nDifferent scene representations have been explored in this context, including meshes  , signed distance functions (SDFs) , or neural radiance or reflectance fields   [ref]3\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
