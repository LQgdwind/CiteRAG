      "content": "Paper Title: Embedded Graph Convolutional Networks for Real-Time Event Data Processing on SoC FPGAs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEmbedded vision systems have become an integral part of many modern technologies, especially in advanced mobile robotics such as autonomous vehicles . The use of vision cameras facilitates the detection and location of objects, which is crucial for navigation, obstacle avoidance, path planning and performing specific tasks such as manipulating objects or interacting with the environment  . Typical frame cameras capture video sequences in greyscale or colour with specific spatial (e.g. 1280×72012807201280\\times 720 pixels) and temporal (e.g. 60 frames per seconds (FPS)) resolution. However, their application is limited by issues such as motion blur under fast movement or uneven lighting present in the scene. They also struggle in high dynamic range (HDR) environments, where it is challenging to set an exposure time that accommodates both bright and dark areas.\nIn addition, the high latency (low FPS rate) makes it impossible to analyse the scene between frames.\nMoreover, static elements cause repeatedly transmiting the same information, increasing energy consumption and generating redundant data.\n It is important to note that the above-mentioned limitations are far less applicable to the human vision. This fact was the inspiration for the development of neuromorphic sensors (so-called event cameras or dynamic vision sensors (DVS)) [ref]4. In an event camera, each pixel operates independently and detects changes in light intensity, thus generating ‘events’, which are described by the location of their occurrence (as pixel coordinates), the time of occurrence (with microsecond accuracy) and the polarity. The output of the event camera is a sparse spatio-temporal point cloud which significantly increases camera’s resistance to motion blur and allows correct operation even in adverse lighting conditions. Furthermore, this approach ensures that only information about significant changes is captured, which helps to reduce average energy consumption [ref]5. Although event cameras have numerous advantages, the main problem is the efficient processing of the event stream. Computer vision methods developed over the last 60 years for frame cameras are not suitable for sparse spatio-temporal point clouds. Therefore, several approaches to this problem have been proposed. The simplest method is to project the event data onto a two-dimensional plane in order to create a pseudo-frame, similar to the one obtained from a traditional camera . This allows the direct application of classical methods and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [ref]7 . However, this approach requires an aggregation of events over a given time interval resulting in lost high temporal resolution and generation of redundant pixels without key information. Therefore, recent research focuses on modifications to frame-based methods aimed at exploiting the sparsity of data  0. In addition, an increasing number of works propose to process events in their original form. One approach is the use of spiking neural networks (SNNs). This method, also inspired by biology, is not yet widely used, due to the difficulty to train such models, but is gaining popularity for certain applications 1 2 3. An alternative approach are graph neural networks (GNNs), which process event data through a graph representation. In such a structure, individual events are represented as vertices, while the edges connecting these vertices correspond to their relationships. This allows the data to be represented as sparse clouds of vertices in spatio-temporal space, enabling the use of standard learning mechanisms such as backpropagation, thus facilitating the training process compared to SNNs 4 5 6. In addition, recent research indicates that such graphs can be updated asynchronously, thus reducing the number of operations processed for a single event 7 8 9. In this work, we consider hardware implementation for an FPGA platform that enables energy-efficient and real-time processing of event data (e.g. 0 1). Using the concept of hardware-aware algorithm design and taking into account the unique features of FPGA devices, we have proposed and evaluated a variation of the PointNet++ graph convolutional network architecture. This approach allowed us to significantly reduce the size of the model by more than 100 times, while limiting the accuracy loss to 1.7-2.3% for different datasets. We designed a small custom GCN model (Figure 1) and implemented it on a SoC FPGA as a proof-of-concept. The hardware module achieves a processing throughput of up to 13.3 million events per second (MEPS) with a low latency of 4.47 ms. These results demonstrate the potential of our approach for efficient real-time processing of event camera data in embedded systems. To address the accuracy results for the hardware-implemented model, we carried out an accelerator scalability analysis (Section VI-D). We can summarise our contribution as follows: We present the first scalable hardware-aware approach for the optimisation of graph convolutional networks addressing each layer utilised in PointNet++ like architecture. We present the first end-to-end hardware accelerator for graph convolutional networks on a SoC FPGA device, designed for real-time continuous event data processing and implemented exclusively with elements of constant latency and known throughput. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.\nIn Section II, we present basic information about event cameras and graph convolutional networks.\nSection III summarises existing work on graph convolutional networks for event data processing and hardware accelerators for graph neural networks. Section IV details the methods used in developing a network architecture for event data processing, with its evaluation presented in Section V. A comprehensive description of the hardware implementation of the graph convolutional network accelerator, including the integration of hardware and software components on the SoC FPGA platform, is provided in Section VI. The paper concludes with Section VII, where we summarise our results and outline plans for further work.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: limitations are far less applicable to the human vision.
