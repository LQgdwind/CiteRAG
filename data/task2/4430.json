      "content": "Paper Title: Spatial-Temporal Federated Learning for Lifelong Person Re-identification on Distributed Edges\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate the average accuracy of different edge clients under different federated lifelong learning methods (i.e., FedSTIL, FedWeIT [ref]30, FedCurv ) in Fig 6.\nCompared with the baseline methods, our method can achieve higher accuracy over 60 rounds of training.\nBesides, with continuous training on the new tasks, the accuracy can increase stablely with less fluctuation, which also indicates the robustness of our methods.\nThis improvement is largely owing to the effective knowledge sharing and the alleviation of the forgetting of the learnt knowledge during federated lifelong learning.\nWe then analyze the impact of knowledge sharing and forgetting on federated lifelong person ReID.\n Knowledge Sharing.\nOur FedSTIL can achieve higher accuracy because it can effectively exchange knowledge among edge clients.\nIn general, all federated learning-based methods (i.e., FedAvg , FedProx , FedCurv , FedWeIT [ref]30, and our FedSTIL) can achieve higher accuracy than other local-based training methods (i.e., STL, EWC [ref]32, MAS [ref]33, and iCaRL ).\nThese results indicate that exchanging on-edge knowledge can significantly improve the overall accuracy,\nbecause the local data of an edge client is limited for learning, such as insufficient data or limited camera views.\nThus, sharing the knowledge across edge clients can make up for the limitations of local data.\nMoreover, we can observe that our FedSTIL achieves the highest accuracy compared with other federated learning-based methods (i.e., FedAvg , FedProx , FedCurv , and FedWeIT [ref]30).\nThe improvement mainly owes to the task-relevant knowledge sharing among edge clients, which alleviates the interference incurred by the irrelevant knowledge transferring among the edge clientsâ€™ models. Alleviation of Forgetting.\nOur FedSTIL can maintain the accuracy with less forgetting of the previous knowledge during the continuous training on the subsequent tasks.\nWe can observe in Fig. 6 that both the Rank-1 and mAP accuracy of federated learning methods (i.e., FedAvg  and FedProx ) will not increase after the 404040-th round.\nAs shown in Fig. 7, this is because the knowledge learnt from the past tasks is gradually forgotten during the learning of the new tasks.\nIn contrast, federated lifelong methods (i.e., FedCurv , FedWeIT [ref]30, and FedSTIL) can alleviate forgetting on the past tasks, which help to achieve higher accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: We evaluate the average accuracy of different edge clients under different federated lifelong learning methods (i.e., FedSTIL, FedWeIT [ref]30, FedCurv ) in Fig 6.\nCompared with the baseline methods, our method can achieve higher accuracy over 60 rounds of training.\nBesides, with continuous training on the new tasks, the accuracy\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
