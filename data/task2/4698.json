      "content": "Paper Title: Momentum Adversarial Distillation: Handling Large Distribution Shifts in Data-Free Knowledge Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD), it is critical to synthesize\ndata that are useful for transferring knowledge from ùöÉùöÉ\\mathtt{T} to ùöÇùöÇ\\mathtt{S}.\nExisting DFKD methods differ mainly in their objectives to guide the\ndata synthesis. These methods generally fall into either the adversarial\ncamp or the non-adversarial camp. Non-adversarial DFKD methods [ref]7  9 4  \nmake use of certain heuristics to search for synthetic data that resembles\nthe original training data ùíüùöÉ,trainsubscriptùíüùöÉtrain\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathtt{T},\\text{train}}. For example,\nZSKD 4 and DAFL [ref]7 consider\nprediction probabilities of ùöÉùöÉ\\mathtt{T} and the confidence of ùöÉùöÉ\\mathtt{T}\nas heuristics. In DAFL, synthetic data is generated via a generator\nùô∂ùô∂\\mathtt{G} rather than being optimized directly like in ZSKD. KegNet\n extends DAFL by making ùô∂ùô∂\\mathtt{G} conditioned\non class labels. Adversarial DFKD methods      \nleverage adversarial learning to explore the data space more efficiently.\nMost methods of this type are derived from the ABM \ndiscussed in Section¬†2 with additional objectives\nto improve the quality and/or diversity of synthetic data. For example,\nRDSKD  uses a diversity-seeking loss ;\nCMI  uses an inverse contrastive loss to\nimprove diversity; and DeepInversion  uses\nBatch Norm moment matching (BNmm) and DeepDream‚Äôs inception losses\n(total variation, L2)  to generate\nvisually interpretable images. DeepInversion  is one of a few DFKD methods\n 9  that have been shown\nto learn well on the full-size ImageNet dataset. Its success has inspired\nsubsequent works on large-scale continual learning \nand data-free object detection . However, training\nDeepInversion on ImageNet is very time-consuming because this method\noptimizes synthetic images directly and each complete optimization\nrequires a very large number of iterations (about 20,000). LS-GDFD\n9 learns to generate synthetic data instead but\nrequires one generator for each class (that is, 1,000 generators for\n1,000 classes) to avoid the ‚Äúmode collapse‚Äù problem and achieve\ngood performance. FastDFKD  leverages meta-learning\nto speed up the training process significantly. On the contrary, by\napplying our proposed technique in Section¬†3.2,\nour MAD only needs 1 generator (compared to 1,000 of LS-GDFD)\nand 6,000 training iterations (compared to 20,000√ó\\times of DeepInversion)\nto achieve reasonably good performance on ImageNet (Section¬†5.2.2).\nIn addition, our technique is orthogonal to and can combine with the\nmeta-learning idea in  for further improvement. Besides the DFKD methods discussed above, there is a line of works\nthat consider a less extreme scenario in which unlabeled transfer\nsets are given for training. These transfer sets can be very different\nfrom the original dataset in terms of distribution and semantics and\ncan be freely collected from open resources. Nayak et al. \nanalyzed various kinds of transfer sets ranging from random noise\nimages to natural images and found that the target-class balance property\nof the transfer set and the similarity between the transfer set and\nthe original training set play important roles in improving knowledge\ndistillation results. Fang et al.  argued\nthat although the transfer images can be semantically different from\nthe original traning images, they still share common local visual\npatterns. Therefore, the authors proposed an interesting method called\nMosaicKD which combines different local patches extracted from the\ntransfer images to craft synthetic mosaic images that capture the\nsemantics of the original data while enjoy realistic local structures. Adversarial training methods like GANs has been shown to suffer from\nthe catastrophic forgetting problem of the discriminator  .\nThese works consider GANs training as a continual learning problem\nand leverage existing methods to mitigate the issue. For example,\nLiang et al.  use either EWC \nor SI  to enforce similarity between the\ndiscriminator‚Äôs weights at the current step and at the last checkpoint.\nHoang et al.  suggest some other tricks\nsuch as using a momentum optimizer (e.g., Adam )\nor applying gradient penalty  to the\ndiscriminator. In this paper, we consider the catastrophic forgetting\nproblem of the student as a consequence of the large distribution\nshift problem caused by the generator. Therefore, we focus on regularizing\nthe generator rather than the student. Besides, from this perspective,\nthe catastrophic forgetting problem in GANs is indeed less severe\nthan that in adversarial DFKD. It is because in GANs, the discriminator\nis trained on real data with a fixed distribution, which can somewhat\nreduce the effect of the distribution shift of fake (synthetic) data\nwhile in adversarial DFKD, real data is not available. Recent works\nthat also address the student forgetting problem in DFKD like ours\ninclude DFKD-Mem  and PRE-DFKD .\nDFKD-Mem  stores the past synthetic samples\nin a memory bank and uses these samples as additional training data\nfor the student. Our method, on the other hand, uses an EMA generator\nto generate old synthetic samples on-the-fly, which is more memory\nefficient and adapts better to the student update. PRE-DFKD \nmodels past synthetic data via a VAE 2 and treats\nthe decoder of this VAE as a replay generator. However, training a\nVAE on a continuous stream of synthetic samples could be unstable\nand could lead to another catastrophic forgetting problem on its own.\nIn addition, VAE is not effective for generating images with large\nsize (e.g., ImageNet images) due to the ‚Äúposterior collapse‚Äù problem\n8.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: DFKD methods differ mainly in their objectives to guide the\ndata synthesis.
