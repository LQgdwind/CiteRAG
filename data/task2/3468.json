      "content": "Paper Title: Explainability of Predictive Process Monitoring Results: Can You See My Data Issues?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExplainability, interpretability, and transparency are common terms with more or less the same meaning, referring to the problem of understanding and trusting the underlying mechanisms as well as the predictions of a ML model . According to [ref]14, an explanation is \"a human-interpretable description of the process by which a decision maker took a particular set of inputs and reached a particular conclusion\". In the context of our research, the decision maker is a ML-based predictive model. Moreover, an explanation has a broader meaning including not only the reasoning process behind the generation of predictions, but also the factors contributing to reach a prediction. For example, it is crucial to know which data characteristics are considered deterministic of a prediction, and which features are considered important to the predictive model. Interpretability is the degree to which a human can consistently predict the model’s result [ref]4. This human prediction and the mimicking of the model’s reasoning is based on the mental model a human forms with respect to how the model reached its decisions. In [ref]4 [ref]15, interpretability is considered being equal to transparency. Transparency can be regarded through three levels. The first is simulatability which refers to the human’s capability to simulate how a model reaches a prediction. Another level is decomposability, meaning understanding a predictive model in terms of its elementary components, e.g., its inputs and hyperparameters. The last aspect is algorithmic transparency, denoting the understandability of a prediction algorithm inner working [ref]4. Model transparency can be an inherent characteristic of itself or be achieved through an explanation of a model. Transparent models are understandable on their own and satisfy one or all model transparency levels [ref]15. Linear models, decision trees, Bayesian models, rule-based learning, and General Additive Models (GAM) are all considered being transparent/interpretable models varying in degree of transparency achievement. However, the mental model of humans and their ability to mimic the reasoning process of a predictive model and, hence, to trust and accept its predictions depend on certain qualities of a good explanation. The composition, content and quality of an explanation can be influenced, characterised and then evaluated according to its constructing approach. XAI methods can be differentiated according to several factors. These factors include how an explanation is being generated, the granularity and the scope to which an explanation can be generalised, when to apply a XAI method, how an explanation is presented, and the user group addressed by an explanation. Generating explanations can be done using several ways including, explanations by providing the user with examples of process instances which are similar in their attributes while being different in the prediction. Another way is to visualise intermediate representations and layers of a predictive model with the aim to qualitatively determine what a model has learned . Explanation by feature relevance includes assigning importance scores to features contributing to a ML model prediction represent one type of XAI methods. The latter include SHAP  and partial dependence plot (PDP)  as examples. An explanation can be generated locally for one process instance or a sample, or may be applied globally to the reasoning process of a predictive model over the complete event log or dataset. Accumulated Local Effects (ALE)  is an example of global XAI methods, while LIME  is considered a local XAI method. Choosing the form an explanation is presented is determined by the way the explanation is generated, the characteristics of the end user (e.g., level of expertise), and the scope of the explanation, the purpose of generating an explanation, (e.g., to visualise effects of feature interactions on decisions of the respective predictive model).  introduces three categories of presentation forms including visual, verbal, and analytic explanations. The point of time to generate an explanation is another determining factor of a XAI method. The depth at which an explanation is able to reflect a predictive model’s reasoning process internally or to find a mapping between the model’s inputs and its outputs determines whether to rely on intrinsic explanations or post-hoc ones. When explainability is imposed through mechanisms put in place while constructing the model to obtain a white-box predictive model, it is called intrinsic explanations. Meanwhile, using an explanation method to understand the reasoning process of a model in terms of its outcomes is called post-hoc explanation of a predictive model. XAI methods are further categorised as being either model-agnostic or model-specific. Model-agnostic approaches are able to explain any type of ML predictive model, whereas model-specific approaches can only be used on top of specific models. For example, DeepLift  and LRP  provide explanations for neural network-based predictive models.  discusses advantages of model-agnostic approaches focusing on the flexibility of model choice, explanation form and representation. In turn,  argues against the flexibility of model-agnostic approaches highlighting that these approaches make assumptions about explained predictive models to maintain the expected flexibility.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: are common terms with more or less the same meaning, referring to the problem of understanding and trusting the underlying mechanisms as well as the predictions of a ML model .
