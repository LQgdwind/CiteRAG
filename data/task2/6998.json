      "content": "Paper Title: Panoptic Vision-Language Feature Fields\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAn important consideration for building spatial AI applications is the representation used to model the scene. Ideally, the chosen representation can be built incrementally in real-time, model the geometry with high fidelity, and allow for flexible runtime semantic queries. Recently, open-vocabulary semantic scene representations based on NeRF [ref]1 have been proposed [ref]2  [ref]4 for robotics. Such systems reconstruct scene geometry implicitly from 2D views, and enable zero-shot semantic segmentation and natural language-based object detection. They achieve this by distilling features from a vision-language model into a feature field representation mapping points in the scene to vision-language vectors, which can be compared against natural language prompts. Such representations present great promise for augmented reality, mobile manipulation, and intelligent robotic applications, bridging physical 3D spaces with natural language representations. A limitation of current systems is that, while they can perform semantic segmentation, they cannot produce a panoptic segmentation of the scene by telling instances of objects belonging to the same class apart. A key problem in 3D instance segmentations that are built from multiple views is that instance segmentations across different views are not guaranteed to be consistent. This is further complicated by the fact that 2D segments are noisy, and might only segment a subpart of each object in individual views. A recent approach, Panoptic Lifting , tackles panoptic segmentation by fusing 2D panoptic segmentations into 3D. This is achieved by mapping instance identifiers across different views through a linear assignment. A drawback of this approach is that it assumes a maximum number of instances in the scene, and requires computing the assignment at each training step, which is increasingly expensive as the assumed number of instances grows. Furthermore, the semantic predictions of Panoptic Lifting are restricted to a fixed set of semantic categories. In this work, we propose Panoptic Vision-Language Feature Fields (PVLFF), a novel pipeline for 3D open-vocabulary panoptic mapping, as shown in Fig. 1. PVLFF learns a radiance field [ref]1\nfrom posed images, and simultaneously learns semantic and instance feature fields from 2D proposals computed by an off-the-shelf dense vision-language encoder EVLsuperscriptEVL\\mathrm{E^{VL}}  and a pretrained instance segmenter EISsuperscriptEIS\\mathrm{E^{IS}} . At runtime, instance features can be easily clustered using conventional clustering algorithms to produce an instance segmentation, either of the 3D pointclouds or of 2D views of the scene after volumetric rendering. The resulting instance segments can be further fused with the semantic segmentation inferred from the semantic feature field based on language prompts, producing an open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Our core insight is that existing vision-language feature field approaches  [ref]2 [ref]4 can be extended to do panoptic segmentation by introducing a separate instance feature head, which is learned from 2D instance segments using a contrastive loss function. The contrastive loss function enables learning from inconsistent instance segments and does not require assuming a maximum instance count.\nWe furthermore show that the learned instance features can be clustered hierarchically, which enables segmenting instances at different scales.\nSuch hierarchical representation of instances can benefit scene-understanding and high-level planning applications, such as assembling a piece of furniture, which involves a robot identifying individual components like screws, bolts, or joints. We evaluate PVLFF on the Hypersim , Replica , and ScanNet  datasets. Our method, trained with no class supervision, achieves\nsatisfactory results compared to\nthe state-of-the-art closed-set panoptic systems. We also show that our method outperforms zero-shot methods on both 2D and 3D semantic segmentation (+4.6%percent4.6+4.6\\% of mIoUmIoU\\mathrm{mIoU}). We further ablate the design choices of our method. In summary, our contributions are: A hierarchical instance feature field that enables obtaining multi-scale 3D instance segments from 2D proposals using contrastive learning; To the best of our knowledge, the first zero-shot open-vocabulary 3D panoptic segmentation system.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: be built incrementally in real-time, model the geometry with high fidelity, and allow for flexible runtime semantic queries.
