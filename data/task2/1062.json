      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Generalization in Reinforcement Learning with Mixture Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has brought significant progress in learning policies to tackle various challenging tasks, such as board games like Go  , Chess and Shogi , video games like Atari   and StarCraft , and robotics control tasks 4. Despite its outstanding performance, deep RL agents tend to suffer poor generalization to unseen environments   [ref]29 [ref]3 [ref]2 . For example, in video games, agents trained with a small set of levels struggle to make progress in unseen levels of the same game [ref]2; in robotics control, agents trained in simulation environments of low diversity generalize poorly to the realistic environments . Such a generalization gap has become a major obstacle for deploying deep RL in real applications. One of the main causes for this generalization gap is the limited diversity of training environments [ref]29 [ref]3 [ref]2.\nMotivated by this, some works propose to improve RL agents’ generalizability by diversifying the training data via data augmentation techniques [ref]3 3 2 1.\nHowever, these approaches merely augment the observations individually with image processing techniques, such as random crop, patch cutout  and random convolutions 3.\nAs shown in Figure 1 (left), such techniques are performing local perturbation within the state feature space,\nwhich only incrementally increases the training data diversity and thus leads to limited generalization performance gain.\nThis is evidenced by our findings that these augmentation techniques fail to improve generalization performance of the RL agents when evaluated on a large-scale benchmark (see Section 4.1). In this work, we introduce mixreg that trains the RL agent on a mixture of observations collected from different training environments.\nInspired by the success of mixup  in supervised learning, per training step, mixreg generates augmented observations by convexly combining two observations randomly sampled from the collected batch, and trains the RL agent on them with their interpolated supervision signal (e.g. the associated rewards or state values).\nIn this way, the generated observations are widely distributed between the diverse observations and can effectively increase the training data diversity, as shown in Figure 1 (right).\nMoreover, mixreg imposes piece-wise linearity regularization to the learned policy and value functions w.r.t. the states.\nSuch regularization encourages the agent to learn a smoother policy with better generalization performance.\nNotably, mixreg is a general scheme and can be applied to both policy-based and value-based RL algorithms. We evaluate mixreg on the recently introduced Procgen Benchmark [ref]2.\nWe compare mixreg with three best-performing data augmentation techniques (i.e. cutout-color, random crop, random convolution) in 2, and two regularization techniques (i.e. batch normalization 0 and ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} regularization) adopted in previous works [ref]3 .\nWe find that mixreg boosts the generalization performance of the RL agent more significantly, surpassing the baselines by a large margin. Moreover, when combined with other methods such as ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} regularization, mixreg brings further improvement.\nWe also verify the effectiveness of mixreg for both policy-based and value-based algorithms.\nAdditionally, we conduct several analytical experiments to study and provide better understanding on its effectiveness. This work makes the following contributions. We are among the first to study how to effectively increase training data diversity to improve RL generalization. Different from data augmentation techniques as commonly adopted in recent works, we propose to look into mixing observations from different environments. We introduce mixreg, a simple and effective approach for improving RL generalization by learning smooth policy over mixed observations. Mixreg can be easily deployed for both policy and value-based RL algorithms. On the recent large-scale Procgen benchmark, mixreg outperforms many well-established baselines by large margins. It also serves as a strong baseline for future studies.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: and Shogi , video games like Atari   and StarCraft , and robotics control tasks 4.
