A relational system G𝐺G consists of a set V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) of\nvertices and a family of relations R1,R2,…,Rksubscript𝑅1subscript𝑅2…subscript𝑅𝑘R_{1},R_{2},\\dots,R_{k} on V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G). Assume\nG𝐺G is a relational system with relations R1,R2,…,Rksubscript𝑅1subscript𝑅2…subscript𝑅𝑘R_{1},R_{2},\\dots,R_{k} and H𝐻H a\nrelational system with relations S1,S2,…,Sksubscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2…subscript𝑆𝑘S_{1},S_{2},\\dots,S_{k}, where the arity of\nthe corresponding relations Risubscript𝑅𝑖R_{i} and Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i} is the same for all i=1,2,…,k𝑖12…𝑘i=1,2,\\dots,k. A homomorphism of G𝐺G to H𝐻H is a mapping f:V​(G)→V​(H):𝑓→𝑉𝐺𝑉𝐻f\\colon V(G)\\to V(H)\nthat preserves all relations, i.e., satisfies (v1,v2,…)∈Ri⟹(f​(v1),f​(v2),…)∈Sisubscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2…subscript𝑅𝑖𝑓subscript𝑣1𝑓subscript𝑣2…subscript𝑆𝑖(v_{1},v_{2},\\dots)\\in R_{i}\\implies(f(v_{1}),f(v_{2}),\\dots)\\in S_{i}, for all i=1,2,…,k𝑖12…𝑘i=1,2,\\dots,k. The constraint satisfaction problem with fixed template H𝐻H asks whether or not\nan input relational system G𝐺G, with the same arities of corresponding\nrelations as H𝐻H, admits a homomorphism to H𝐻H. Note that when H𝐻H has a single relation S𝑆S, which is binary and symmetric,\nthen we obtain the graph homomorphism problem referred to at the beginning of\nSection 1. When H𝐻H has a single relation S𝑆S, which is an\narbitrary binary relation, we obtain the digraph homomorphism\nproblem  which is in a certain sense  as difficult to\nclassify as the general constraint satisfaction problem. When H𝐻H has two\nrelations +,−+,-, then we obtain a problem that is superficially similar to\nthe homomorphism problem for signed graphs, except that switching is not\nallowed. This problem is called the edge-coloured graph homomorphism\nproblem [ref]5, and it turns out to be similar to the digraph\nhomomorphism problem in that it is difficult to classify . On the\nother hand, the homomorphism problem for signed\ngraphs  [ref]8 , seems easier to classify, and exhibits a\ndichotomy similar to the graph dichotomy classification, see\nTheorem 5. List homomorphism problems are also special cases of constraint satisfaction\nproblems, as lists can be replaced by unary relations. Consider first the case\nof graphs. Suppose H𝐻H is a fixed graph, and form the relational system H#superscript𝐻#H^{\\#}\nwith vertices V​(H)𝑉𝐻V(H) and the following relations: one binary relation E​(H)𝐸𝐻E(H)\n(this is a symmetric relation corresponding to the undirected edges of the\ngraph H𝐻H), and 2|V​(H)|−1superscript2𝑉𝐻12^{|V(H)|}-1 unary relations RXsubscript𝑅𝑋R_{X} on V​(H)𝑉𝐻V(H), each\nconsisting of a different non-empty subset X𝑋X of V​(H)𝑉𝐻V(H). The constraint\nsatisfaction problem with template H#superscript𝐻#H^{\\#} has inputs G𝐺G with a symmetric\nbinary relation E​(G)𝐸𝐺E(G) (a graph) and unary relations SX,X⊆V​(H)subscript𝑆𝑋𝑋𝑉𝐻S_{X},X\\subseteq V(H),\nand the question is whether or not a homomorphism exists. If a vertex v∈V​(G)𝑣𝑉𝐺v\\in V(G) is in the relation SXsubscript𝑆𝑋S_{X} corresponding to RXsubscript𝑅𝑋R_{X}, then any mapping\npreserving the relations must map v𝑣v to a vertex in X𝑋X; thus imposing the\nrelation SXsubscript𝑆𝑋S_{X} on v∈V​(G)𝑣𝑉𝐺v\\in V(G) amounts to setting L​(v)=X𝐿𝑣𝑋L(v)=X. Therefore the\nlist homomorphism problem for the graph H𝐻H is formulated as the\nconstraint satisfaction problem for the template H#superscript𝐻#H^{\\#}. Such a translation is also possible for homomorphism of signed graphs. Brewster and Graves\nintroduced a useful construction. The switching graph (H+,π+)superscript𝐻superscript𝜋(H^{+},\\pi^{+}) has two\nvertices v1,v2subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2v_{1},v_{2} for each vertex v𝑣v of (H,π)𝐻𝜋(H,\\pi), and each edge v​w𝑣𝑤vw of (H,π)𝐻𝜋(H,\\pi) gives\nrise to edges v1​w1,v2​w2subscript𝑣1subscript𝑤1subscript𝑣2subscript𝑤2v_{1}w_{1},v_{2}w_{2} of colour π​(v​w)𝜋𝑣𝑤\\pi(vw) and edges v1​w2,v2​w1subscript𝑣1subscript𝑤2subscript𝑣2subscript𝑤1v_{1}w_{2},v_{2}w_{1}\nof the opposite colour. (This definition applies also for loops, i.e., when\nv=w𝑣𝑤v=w.) Then each homomorphism of the signed graph (G,σ)𝐺𝜎(G,\\sigma) to the signed\ngraph (H,π)𝐻𝜋(H,\\pi) corresponds to a homomorphism of the edge-coloured graph\n(G,σ)𝐺𝜎(G,\\sigma) to the edge-coloured graph (H+,π+)superscript𝐻superscript𝜋(H^{+},\\pi^{+}) and conversely. For list\nhomomorphisms of signed graphs, we can use the same transformation, modifying\nthe lists of the input signed graph. If (G,σ)𝐺𝜎(G,\\sigma) has lists L​(v),v∈V​(G)𝐿𝑣𝑣𝑉𝐺L(v),v\\in V(G), then the new lists L+​(v),v∈V​(G),superscript𝐿𝑣𝑣𝑉𝐺L^{+}(v),v\\in V(G), are defined as follows: for\nany x∈L​(v)𝑥𝐿𝑣x\\in L(v) with v∈V​(G)𝑣𝑉𝐺v\\in V(G), we place both x1subscript𝑥1x_{1} and x2subscript𝑥2x_{2}\nin L+​(v)superscript𝐿𝑣L^{+}(v). It is easy to see that the signed graph (G,σ)𝐺𝜎(G,\\sigma) has a list\nhomomorphism to the signed graph (H,π)𝐻𝜋(H,\\pi) with respect to the lists L𝐿L if\nand only if the edge-coloured graph (G,σ)𝐺𝜎(G,\\sigma) has a list homomorphism to\nthe edge-coloured graph (H+,π+)superscript𝐻superscript𝜋(H^{+},\\pi^{+}) with respect to the lists L+superscript𝐿L^{+}. The new\nlists L+superscript𝐿L^{+} are symmetric sets in H+superscript𝐻H^{+}, meaning that for any x∈V​(H),v∈V​(G)formulae-sequence𝑥𝑉𝐻𝑣𝑉𝐺x\\in V(H),v\\in V(G), we have x1∈L+​(v)subscript𝑥1superscript𝐿𝑣x_{1}\\in L^{+}(v) if and only if we have x2∈L+​(v)subscript𝑥2superscript𝐿𝑣x_{2}\\in L^{+}(v). Thus we obtain the list homomorphism problem for the edge-coloured\ngraph (H+,π+)superscript𝐻superscript𝜋(H^{+},\\pi^{+}), restricted to input instances (G,σ)𝐺𝜎(G,\\sigma) with lists L𝐿L\nthat are symmetric in H+superscript𝐻H^{+}. As above, we can transform this list homomorphism\nproblem for the edge-coloured graph (H+,π+)superscript𝐻superscript𝜋(H^{+},\\pi^{+}), to a constraint satisfaction\nproblem. The details are similar to the construction of H#superscript𝐻#H^{\\#}, except this time\nthe new template (H+,π+)∗superscriptsuperscript𝐻superscript𝜋(H^{+},\\pi^{+})^{*} is obtained by adding unary relations RX=Xsubscript𝑅𝑋𝑋R_{X}=X\nonly for sets X⊆V​(H+)𝑋𝑉superscript𝐻X\\subseteq V(H^{+}) that are symmetric in H+superscript𝐻H^{+}. We conclude that\nour problems List-S-Hom(H^)^𝐻(\\widehat{H}) fit into the general constraint\nsatisfaction framework, and therefore it follows from   that\ndichotomy holds for problems List-S-Hom(H^)^𝐻(\\widehat{H}). We therefore\nask which problems List-S-Hom(H^)^𝐻(\\widehat{H}) are polynomial-time\nsolvable and which are NP-complete. The solution of the Feder-Vardi dichotomy conjecture involved an\nalgebraic classification of the complexity pioneered by Jeavons 2. A\nkey role in this is played by the notion of a polymorphism of a relational\nstructure H𝐻H. If H𝐻H is a digraph, then a polymorphism of H𝐻H is a\nhomomorphism f𝑓f of some power Htsuperscript𝐻𝑡H^{t} to H𝐻H, i.e., a function f𝑓f that assigns\nto each ordered t𝑡t-tuple (v1,v2,…,vt)subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2…subscript𝑣𝑡(v_{1},v_{2},\\ldots,v_{t}) of vertices of H𝐻H a vertex\nf​(v1,v2,…,vt)𝑓subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2…subscript𝑣𝑡f(v_{1},v_{2},\\ldots,v_{t}) such that two coordinate-wise adjacent tuples obtain\nadjacent images. For general templates, all relations must be similarly\npreserved. A polymorphism of order t=3𝑡3t=3 is a majority if\nf​(v,v,w)=f​(v,w,v)=f​(w,v,v)=v𝑓𝑣𝑣𝑤𝑓𝑣𝑤𝑣𝑓𝑤𝑣𝑣𝑣f(v,v,w)=f(v,w,v)=f(w,v,v)=v for all v,w𝑣𝑤v,w. A Siggers polymorphism is\na polymorphism of order t=4𝑡4t=4, if f​(a,r,e,a)=f​(r,a,r,e)𝑓𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑟𝑒f(a,r,e,a)=f(r,a,r,e) for all a,r,e𝑎𝑟𝑒a,r,e.\nOne formulation of the dichotomy theorem proved by Bulatov  and\nZhuk  states that the constraint satisfaction problem for the\ntemplate H𝐻H is polynomial-time solvable if H𝐻H admits a Siggers polymorphism,\nand is NP-complete otherwise. Majority polymorphisms are less powerful, but it\nis known  that if H𝐻H admits a majority then the constraint\nsatisfaction problem for the template H𝐻H is polynomial-time solvable.\nMoreover, it was shown in  that a graph H𝐻H is a bi-arc\ngraph if and only if the associated relational system H∗superscript𝐻H^{*} admits a majority\npolymorphism. Thus the list homomorphism problem for a graph H𝐻H with possible\nloops is polynomial-time solvable if H∗superscript𝐻H^{*} admits a majority polymorphism, and\nis NP-complete otherwise. It was observed in 3 that this is not true\nfor signed graphs. There is a convenient way to think of polymorphisms f𝑓f of the relational\nsystem (H+,π+)∗superscriptsuperscript𝐻superscript𝜋(H^{+},\\pi^{+})^{*}. A mapping f𝑓f is a polymorphism of (H+,π+)∗superscriptsuperscript𝐻superscript𝜋(H^{+},\\pi^{+})^{*}\nif and only if it is a polymorphism of the edge-coloured graph (H+,π+)superscript𝐻superscript𝜋(H^{+},\\pi^{+}) and if, for\nany symmetric set X⊆V​(H+)𝑋𝑉superscript𝐻X\\subseteq V(H^{+}), we have x1,x2,…,xt∈Xsubscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2…subscript𝑥𝑡𝑋x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{t}\\in X\nthen also f​(x1,x2,…,xt)∈X𝑓subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2…subscript𝑥𝑡𝑋f(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{t})\\in X. We call such polymorphisms of\n(H+,π+)superscript𝐻superscript𝜋(H^{+},\\pi^{+}) semi-conservative. We can apply the dichotomy result of   to obtain an algebraic\nclassification. For any signed graph (H,π)𝐻𝜋(H,\\pi), the problem List-S-Hom(H,π)𝐻𝜋(H,\\pi) is\npolynomial-time solvable if (H+,π+)superscript𝐻superscript𝜋(H^{+},\\pi^{+}) admits a semi-conservative Siggers\npolymorphism, and is NP-complete otherwise. As mentioned above, one can not replace the semi-conservative Siggers\npolymorphism by a semi-conservative majority polymorphism 3.\nWe focus in this paper on seeking a graph theoretic classification, at least\nfor some classes of signed graphs.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: a problem that is superficially similar to\nthe homomorphism problem for signed graphs, except that switching is not\nallowed.
