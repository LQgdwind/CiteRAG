      "content": "Paper Title: Rehabilitation Exercise Quality Assessment through Supervised Contrastive Learning with Hard and Soft Negatives\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nST-GCNs [ref]21 have been widely used for skeleton-based action analysis, including action recognition and classification [ref]21 [ref]32. Deb et al.  explored ST-GCN’s role in rehabilitation exercise quality assessment. Beyond the basic ST-GCN [ref]21, which includes multiple cascading ST-GCN layers and a global average pooling layer, an ’extended’ ST-GCN was developed for exercise-type-specific models. This extended version (1) substitutes global average pooling with LSTM, addressing the loss of subtle features critical for assessing rehabilitation exercise quality, and (2) replaces the fixed adjacency matrix with a dynamically modified one, allowing for adaptive adjustments to the significance of body joints in different exercises. However, these enhancements also considerably increased the models’ parameter count and computational complexity. Zheng et al.  developed exercise-type-specific assessment models using the vanilla ST-GCN [ref]21 with a reduced number of ST-GCN layers. To make the neural network robust to changes in the positioning of the subject in question and the capture device, a Rotation-Invariant (RI) descriptor, namely the dot product matrix of the human skeleton, was applied to the input to ST-GCN. In addition, to make ST-GCN inferences interpretable and provide visualization of body joints associated with erroneous movements, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping [ref]36 was applied to ST-GCN. Réby et al.  utilized a combination of ST-GCN with Transformers for developing exercise-type-specific assessment models. The neural network incorporated a spatial self-attention module to understand intra-frame relations between different body joints and a temporal self-attention module for modeling inter-frame interactions. Given the limited number of samples for a specific exercise type in existing rehabilitation exercise quality assessment datasets, the complex network struggled to train effectively and thus did not yield improved results compared with the vanilla ST-GCN [ref]21. Mourchid and Salma  proposed a dense spatiotemporal graph convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a combination of ST-GCN, GRU, and Transformer encoder  and also an ST-GCN with multiple residual layers and an attention fusion mechanism for exercise-type-specific assessment model development. Li et al.  introduced a graph convolutional Siamese network for the tasks of rehabilitation exercise quality assessment and exercise type classification. The network takes as input a pair consisting of a test exercise and a ’standard’ exercise, assessing the correctness of the test exercise in relation to the standard exercise and identifying the exercise type. Yao et al.  employed a multi-stream adaptive graph convolutional network  and trained it in a contrastive learning setting by minimizing the linear combination of three loss functions. These include a Huber loss function for assessing the difference between the predicted and ground-truth scores, a loss function aimed at reducing the feature distance for samples with similar scores and increasing it for those with significant score differences, and another loss function dedicated to minimizing the deviation in joint attention weights among samples that share similar scores. Despite its complex architecture and training framework, the method performed poorly in rehabilitation exercise quality assessment compared to Deb et al. . This paper introduces a novel rehabilitation exercise quality assessment approach using supervised contrastive learning  with hard  and soft negatives for training a general, non-exercise-type-specific ST-GCN [ref]21  model. This method benefits from leveraging training samples encompassing all exercise types in the complete dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: ST-GCNs [ref]21 have been widely used for skeleton-based action analysis, including action recognition and classification [ref]21 [ref]32.
