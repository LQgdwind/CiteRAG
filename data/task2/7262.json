      "content": "Paper Title: DTMM: Deploying TinyML Models on Extremely Weak IoT Devices with Pruning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n1) Hardware. We implement DTMM with the Cortex-M55 processor , the latest AI-capable processor with vector processing (i.e., Helium SIMD extension [ref]33) for MCUs. The Cortex-M55 has eight 128-bit vector registers to store operands for SIMD instructions. Each vector register can be divided into lanes of width 8, 16 or 32 bits. For example, if each weight of a model is 8 bits (i.e., 8-bit quantization), a SIMD instruction can process 16 (=128/8) weights simultaneously. Each Helium vector instruction requires two CPU cycles. After the data is partially loaded into a register in the first cycle, the ALU can immediately use it for computations. 2) Software. The software implementation of DTMM consists of two parts: offline toolchain and on-device runtime. We develop the offline toolchain using Python 3.6 and Tensorflow 2.6, and the on-device runtime using C and Helium SIMD extension in TensorFlow Lite Micro (TFLM) [ref]9. Offline toolchain. The offline toolchain includes the scheduler that determines the pruning strategy, the pruner that performs filterlet-based pruning, and other modules such as quantization and retraining. To make our storage structure FWCS used by the models after DTMM pruning compatible with TFLM, we further update TFLM’s schema.fbs file, a format library (including metadata and runtime tensors), and add FWCS as a new format member. On-device runtime. We implement an on-device runtime based on TFLM. Our convolution operator is developed using C and inline Helium assembly. All these updates to TFLM do not affect its execution on other ML models. In particular, our convolution operator is launched only if a layer is pruned by DTMM; Otherwise, the traditional one is used. 3) Models and datasets. We evaluate DTMM with three ML models widely adopted in the previous studies on MCUs, including VGG-11 , ResNet-12 [ref]16 and YOLO , in three popular ML tasks: image classification, visual wake words, and objection detection. For the classification tasks of image classification and visual wake words, we use VGG-11 and ResNet-12. For the object detection task, we use YOLO. We train these ML models on the following datasets, which were used in the previous TinyML studies 6 : 1) CIFAR-10 5: for image classification with 60 K of 32×32323232\\times 32 RGB images of 10 different classes. 2) Visual Wake Words (VWW) : for identifying the existence of person in an image. Images are resized to 64×64×36464364\\times 64\\times 3 for more efficient execution on MCUs. 3) Face Detection Dataset Benchmark (FDDB) 2: for detecting the location and size of all faces in the image. Images are resized to 112×112×31121123112\\times 112\\times 3 for MCUs. Table II summarizes the accuracy, model size, and runtime memory for each unpruned model with 8-bit quantization. 4) Training and pruning. We use the above three datasets to train a corresponding version of each model and then perform pruning, 8-bit quantization, and fine-turning on each version of the model before execution. For CIFAR-10, we follow the official training and testing division (5:1). We split the other two datasets (VWW and FDDB) into 70% and 30% for training/fine-tuning and testing, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: 1) Hardware.
