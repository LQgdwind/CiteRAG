      "content": "Paper Title: Regularizing Neural Networks with Meta-Learning Generative Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile deep neural networks achieved impressive performance on various machine learning tasks, training them still requires a large amount of labeled training data in supervised learning.\nThe labeled datasets are expensive when a few experts can annotate the data, e.g., medical imaging.\nIn such scenarios, generative data augmentation is a promising option for improving the performance of models.\nGenerative data augmentation basically adds pairs of synthetic samples from conditional generative models and their target labels into real training datasets.\nThe expectations of generative data augmentation are that the synthetic samples interpolate missing data points and perform as oversampling for classes with less real training samples¬†.\nThis simple method can improve the performance of several tasks with less diversity of inputs such as medical imaging tasks¬†[ref]2 [ref]3  . However, in general cases that require the recognition of more diverse inputs (e.g., CIFAR datasets¬†), generative data augmentation degrades rather than improves the test accuracy¬†[ref]7.\nPrevious studies have indicated that this can be caused by the low quality of synthetic samples in terms of the diversity and fidelity¬†[ref]7 .\nIf this hypothesis is correct, we can expect high-quality generative models (e.g., StyleGAN2-ADA¬†) to resolve the problem; existing generative data augmentation methods adopt earlier generative models e.g., ACGAN¬†0 and SNGAN¬†1.\nContrary to the expectation, this is not the case.\nWe observed that generative data augmentation fails to improve models even when using a high-quality StyleGAN2-ADA (Figure¬†2).\nAlthough the samples partially appear to be real to humans, they are not yet sufficient to train classifiers in existing generative data augmentation methods.\nThis paper investigates methodologies for effectively extracting useful information from generative models to improve model performance. We address this problem based on the following hypotheses.\nFirst, synthetic samples are actually informative but do not perfectly represent class categories in real data.\nThis is based on a finding by Brock et¬†al.¬†4 called ‚Äúclass leakage,\" where a class conditional synthetic sample contains attributes of other classes.\nFor example, they observed failure samples including an image of ‚Äútennis ball\" containing attributes of ‚Äúdogs\" (Figure 4(d) of¬†4).\nThese class leaked samples do not perfectly represent the class categories in the real dataset.\nIf we use such class leaked samples for updating classifiers, the samples can distort the decision boundaries, as shown in Figure¬†4.\nSecond, regardless of the quality, the generative models originally contain uninformative samples to solve the tasks.\nThis is simply because the generative models are not explicitly optimized to generate informative samples for learning the conditional distribution p‚Äã(y|x)ùëùconditionalùë¶ùë•p(y|x); they are optimized only for learning the data distribution p‚Äã(x)ùëùùë•p(x).\nFurther, the generative models often fail to capture the entire data distribution precisely due to their focus on the high-density regions.\nThese characteristics of generative models might disturb the synthesis of effective samples for generative data augmentation.\nTo maximize the gain from synthetic samples, we should select appropriate samples for training tasks. In this paper, we present a novel regularization method called meta generative regularization (MGR).\nBased on the above hypotheses, MGR is composed of two techniques for improving generative data augmentation: pseudo consistency regularization (PCR) and meta pseudo sampling (MPS).\nPCR is a regularization term using synthetic samples in training objectives for classifiers.\nInstead of supervised learning with negative log-likelihood ‚àílog‚Å°p‚Äã(y|x)ùëùconditionalùë¶ùë•-\\log p(y|x), i.e., cross-entropy, on synthetic samples, we regularize the feature extractor to avoid the distortions on decision boundaries.\nThat is, PCR leverages synthetic samples only for learning feature spaces.\nPCR penalizes the feature extractors by minimizing the gap between variations of a synthetic sample, which is inspired by consistency regularization in semi-supervised learning¬†5 6 7.\nMPS corresponds to the second hypothesis and its objective is to select useful samples for training tasks by dynamically searching optimal latent vectors of the generative models.\nTherefore, we formalize MPS as a bilevel optimization framework of a classifier and a finder that is a neural network for searching latent vectors.\nSpecifically, this framework updates the finder through meta-learning to reduce the validation loss and then updates the classifier to reduce the PCR loss (Figure¬†2).\nBy combining PCR and MPS, we can improve the performance even when the existing generative data augmentation degrades the performance (Figure¬†2). We conducted experiments with multiple vision datasets and observed that MGR can stably improve baselines on various settings by up to 7 percentage points of test accuracy.\nFurther, through the visualization studies, we confirmed that MGR utilizes the information in synthetic samples to learn feature representations through PCR and obtain meaningful samples through MPS.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: and perform as oversampling for classes with less real training samples¬†.\nThis simple method can improve the performance of several tasks with less diversity of inputs such as medical imaging tasks¬†[ref]2 [ref]3  . However, in general cases that require the recognition of more diverse inputs (e.g., CIFAR datasets¬†), generative data augmentation degrades rather than improves the test\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
