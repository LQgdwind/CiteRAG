      "content": "Paper Title: Learning-Based Quality Assessment for Image Super-Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the rapid development of high-definition displays, the demand for high resolution image/video content has been increasing rapidly. To improve the user-end visual experience, image Super-Resolution (SR) technique is developed to interpolate High-Resolution (HR) images from their Low-Resolution (LR) references. Examples of these interpolated HR images can be seen in Fig. 1. The past two decades have witnessed a booming of image SR algorithms with widespread applications including medical image processing, video surveillance, remote sensing, and face recognition, among many others. In the SR process, an Image Quality Assessment (IQA) metric is critical as both a performance indicator and a guidance for further improvement. However, the mainstream IQA methods, such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index [ref]1, do not have high correlation with subjective opinions in image SR . Existing IQA methods can be divided into two categories: subjective tests by human observers and objective models by automatic algorithms. Between them, the more reliable way is the subjective test, since human users are the ultimate viewers of images. Several SR methods assess their performances using small-scale subjective tests [ref]7 [ref]8. However subjective test is time-consuming and hard to be embedded into practical applications. Instead, it is often utilized to construct databases, which serve as standard testing sets to compare objective models. Numerous objective IQA models have also been proposed. According to the availability of reference, objective models can be classified into full-reference, reduced-reference and no-reference IQA models. In a typical image SR problem, the perfect quality HR image is unavailable as a reference, therefore, full-reference models are generally inapplicable. In addition, SR algorithms often introduce mixed impairments, including blurring, ringing and aliasing artifacts, which are not well measured by the existing methods  . Therefore, conventional general-purpose reduced-reference and no-reference IQA models should be redesigned specifically for image SR problem. The key challenge in SR-IQA is how to effectively learn distinguishing feature representations of various LR and HR images and then map the features to image quality prediction. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has shown its advantage in IQA with promising successes in recent years   . Compared with other data-driven models, CNN is capable of learning features and making quality predictors jointly in an end-to-end manner. Despite its superiority, CNN has not yet been well exploited in SR-IQA, for which most methods are not based on deep learning     . In this work, we propose a CNN-based SR-IQA algorithm. Considering the importance of reference information , we employ CNNs to extract the features from both images before and after the SR process. A two-stream CNN architecture is thereby designed to simultaneously take the test HR and the corresponding LR reference images, followed by feature fusion and quality prediction of the HR image. The performance of deep learning based models relies heavily on the quality and quantity of training images. Although several benchmark databases of image SR qualities have been constructed     0, they are limited in their sample sizes. The largest database contains only 1,620 HR images. A larger image SR database is thus imperative, for which the biggest challenge is in the enormous workload of human labeling. In this work, we observe a negatively exponential decay behavior of subjective scores after iterative downsample-and-SR processing of natural images. This helps us develop a large-scale database with reduced human labeling workload. Experiments on randomly selected samples demonstrate the high accuracy of this database. Based on this database, we are able to develop and train the two-stream deep network that predicts the quality of SR images with a high correlation to human scores. Our major contributions are as follows: Developed so far the largest IQA database for image SR with a novel semi-automatic labeling method, which greatly reduced the workload of human labeling. Proposed a two-stream deep network that incorporates the available LR image into the quality evaluation of HR image. It results in an end-to-end model that jointly learns perceptually consistent features from the two images and a quality predictor. Designed a feature fusion method that combines the two-stream deep CNN, leading to superior performance against state-of-the-art quality prediction. The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the related work. Section III explains the methodology and process to construct the proposed large-scale database. Section IV elaborates the proposed deep network, including network architecture, feature fusion method, and model training. Section V provides the experimental results. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: critical as both a performance indicator and a guidance for further improvement.
