      "content": "Paper Title: Sample Dropout: A Simple yet Effective Variance Reduction Technique in Deep Policy Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConservative Policy Iteration (CPI)  optimizes the objective defined as policy advantage (i.e., a surrogate objective) by linearly mixing the behavior policy with the learned policy.\nTo relax this linear mixing mechanism, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)  uses the Total Deviation (TV) divergence between behavior policy and target policy as policy regularization and presents that the policy has guaranteed a monotonic improvement with this regularization. Similarly, Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO)  also presents a monotonic improvement guarantee by using average TV divergence over all empirical samples. Mirror Descent Policy Optimization (MDPO)  proposes a more generic regularization, which uses a Bregman divergence to regularize the policy update.\nUnlike explicit policy regularization, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [ref]11 adopts a simple ratio clipping technique which clips probability ratios to form a pessimistic surrogate objective and performs multiple epochs of policy optimization on the same set of sampled data.\nDespite the strong empirical performance of PPO, existing studies show that under this clipping mechanism, the ratios could still become unbounded  [ref]14 .\nTo address this problem, existing works choose to either modify the surrogate objective or enforce the trust-region constraint.\nFor example,  proposes Truly PPO, which modifies the clipping mechanism of PPO by applying a negative incentive to prevent the policy from being pushed away during training.\nAnd,  proposes ratio-regularized policy optimization algorithms with an improvement guarantee, optimizing the policy until the estimate of ratio deviation exceeds a threshold to ensure that the correction term is bounded.\nBy comparison, our work directly operates on samples rather than policy radio.\nTo expand, while algorithms like PPO use ratio clipping to derive a lower bound of the original surrogate objective, we drop samples using the criterion we develop, which can further be combined with PPO.\nOur criterion of sample dropout relies on ratio deviation. Similar to ours, ESPO  uses ratio deviation estimates as a condition to early stop the multi-epoch optimization. Our method differs from ESPO in the following aspects:\n1) The early-stopping mechanism in ESPO only considers the expectation of ratio deviation rather than the distribution of ratio deviation.\nConsequently, samples with small ratio deviation could be wasted due to the early-stop operation. 2) ESPO uses a hard constraint on the correction term while we directly operate on samples.\n3) Our method has a wide application scope and can be applied in ESPO itself.\nIn short, our technique is orthogonal to prior works on improving policy optimization, as evidenced by the fact that it can be combined with existing policy optimization algorithms, which will be shown in the experiment section in detail.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: (MDPO)  proposes a more generic regularization, which uses a Bregman divergence to regularize the policy update.\nUnlike explicit policy regularization, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [ref]11 adopts a simple ratio clipping technique which clips probability ratios to form a pessimistic surrogate objective and performs multiple epochs of policy optimization on the same set of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
