      "content": "Paper Title: Power Control with QoS Guarantees: A Differentiable Projection-based Unsupervised Learning Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost of the aforementioned works handled the power budget constraint systematically via using a sigmoid (in case of a single channel) or softmax (in case of multiple channels) at the output layer of the DNN . The QoS constraints, on the other hand, were handled either by adding a penalty term to the loss function, indicating the violation of these constraints, or by transforming the problem into its Lagrangian and performing the learning in the dual domain  [ref]17. Neither of those guarantees zero violation of constraints at the test time; therefore heuristic algorithms are generally applied to allocate feasible powers in the instance of QoS violation.\nIn this paper, our contributions can be summarized as follows:\n We propose two novel DL solutions for the classical power control problem in a multi-user interference channel with QoS and power budget constraints. The first is called Deep Implicit Projection Network (DIPNet), and the second is called Deep Explicit Projection Network (DEPNet). The former requires convex constraints; whereas, the latter does not. DIPNet utilizes differentiable convex optimization layer  , a type of implicit layers in DNNs [ref]20, to implicitly define a projection function. The projection function projects the neural network’s output to the feasible set defined by the QoS and power budget constraints. Thus, the DNN’s output always satisfies the constraints. DEPNet is inspired by [ref]21, where a process called correction is applied iteratively on the output of the DNN to make it fall unto the feasible set of inequality constraints. The iterative process can be perceived as a differentiable and explicitly-defined projection function that projects the output of DNN to the feasible set of the problem with reduced computational complexity. The process is compatible with GPU-based training. To improve the sum-rate performance of the proposed models even further, the Frank-Wolfe algorithm (FW), an iterative algorithm for constrained optimization problems , has been applied. This algorithm takes the output of the proposed models as its initial point and searches within the feasible set to find a better solution. The proposed models are trained in an unsupervised manner and compared with (i) the enhanced version of PCNet , called PNet, which works in the multi-channel scenario, is considered as the DNN-based benchmark, (ii) Geometric Program (GP)  and genetic algorithm are used as the optimization-based benchmark. The network sum-rate, constraint violation probability, and online test time are the performance metrics. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DIPNet and DEPNet guarantee zero constraint violation probability while outperforming PNet in terms of network sum-rate and constraint violation probability. In addition, the proposed models outperform GP and genetic algorithm in terms of computation time complexity. Note that [ref]20 and [ref]21 have proposed the fundamental techniques, i.e., deep implicit layers and iterative gradient-descent-based projection, respectively. In this paper, we have demonstrated their applicability to handle both the convex and non-convex constraints in wireless resource allocation problems.\nThe proposed differentiable projection functions are compatible with any DNN architecture.\nThus, considering sophisticated DNN architectures will not impact the functionality and applicability of the proposed projection methods.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: by adding a penalty term to the loss function, indicating the violation of these constraints, or by transforming the problem into its Lagrangian and performing the learning in the dual domain  [ref]17.
