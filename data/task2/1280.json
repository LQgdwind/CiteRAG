      "content": "Paper Title: What Makes a ‚ÄúGood‚Äù Data Augmentation in Knowledge Distillation ‚Äì A Statistical Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets and Networks. We evaluate our method primarily on the CIFAR100¬† and Tiny ImageNet***https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/ datasets. CIFAR100 has 100 object classes (32√ó\\times32 RGB images). Each class has 500 images for training and 100 images for testing. Tiny ImageNet is a small version of ImageNet¬†[ref]11 with 200 classes (64√ó\\times64 RGB images). Each class has 500 images for training, 50 for validation and 50 for testing. To thoroughly evaluate our methods, we benchmark them on various standard network architectures: vgg¬†, resnet¬†[ref]14, wrn¬†, MobileNetV2¬†, ShuffleV2¬†. We will also include results on ImageNet100 (a randomly drawn 100-class subset of ImageNet) and ImageNet. Benchmark Methods. In addition to the standard cross-entropy training and the original KD method¬†, we also compare with the state-of-the-art distillation approach, Contrastive Representation Distillation (CRD)¬†[ref]45. It is important to note that our method focuses on improving KD by using better inputs, while CRD improves KD at the output end (i.e., a better loss function). Therefore, they are orthogonal and we will show they can be combined together to deliver even better results. Hyper-Parameter Settings. The temperature œÑùúè\\tau of knowledge distillation is set to 4 following CRD¬†[ref]45. Loss weight Œ±=0.9ùõº0.9\\alpha=0.9 (Eq.¬†(1)). For CIFAR100 and Tiny ImageNet, training batch size is 64; the original number of total training epochs is 240, with learning rate (LR) decayed at epoch 150, 180, and 210 by multiplier 0.1. The initial LR is 0.05. All these settings are the same as CRD¬†[ref]45 for fair comparison. Note, in our experiments we will present the results of more training iterations. If the number of total epochs is scaled by a factor kùëòk, the epochs after which learning rate is decayed is also be scaled by kùëòk. For example, if we train a network for CIFAR100 for 480 epochs (k=2ùëò2k=2) in total, the learning rate will be decayed at epoch 300, 360, and 420. We use PyTorch¬† to conduct all our experiments. For CIFAR100, we adopt the pretrained teacher models from CRD‚Ä†‚Ä†‚Ä†https://github.com/HobbitLong/RepDistiller for fair comparison. For Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet100, we train our own teacher models. For ImageNet, we use torchvision models following CRD¬†[ref]45. Data Augmentation Schemes. We investigate the following popular DA schemes: Identity: This augmentation scheme simply makes a copy of each batch data during training, which should be the lower bound of all DA schemes discussed here since it adds no new information. Flip: Random horizontal flip. Flip+Crop: Random horizontal flip and random crop. This is the standard DA extensively used in 2D image recognition task (such as on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets). Cutout¬†: Cutout occludes a small random patch of an image. AutoAugment¬†: AutoAugment is an ensemble of a collected DA schemes. The DA policy is automatically selected by reinforcement learning instead of manually. Mixup¬†: Mixup applies linear interpolation between two inputs and applies the same linear interpolation to their labels to make the new label for the augmented sample. CutMix¬†: CutMix cuts a small patch from a source image and pastes it to another source image. The resulted image is considered as a new input. The target for the new input is a linear interpolation from the two source labels.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: datasets.
