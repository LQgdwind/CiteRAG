One major branch of causal discovery aims to uncover an adjacency matrix representing the DAG of the joint distribution over the dataset, with an assumption that the underlying\nthat the underlying graph connecting the variables is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Since this assumption could provides the solution to narrow down the class of graphs which are compatible with the observed probability distribution. This branch could also be divided into two different classes. One is the constraint-based approach, and the other one is the score-based approach. Constraint-based approaches construct graphs by testing conditional independencies in the empirical joint distribution, while they require large sample sizes to be reliable. Score-based approaches test the validity of candidate graphs according to a predefined score function. Some common score functions include Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)¬†, Bayesian Gaussian equivalent (BGe)¬† and Bayesian Dirichlet equivalence (BDe)¬† and Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO)  ,etc. Traditional works such as¬†  employ combinatoric approaches to identify a DAG structure. However, the search complexity is O‚Äã(2d2)ùëÇsuperscript2superscriptùëë2O(2^{d^{2}}), where dùëëd is the number of nodes, which is an NP-hard problem. The first work to recast the combinatoric graph search problem as a continuous optimization problem is proposed by¬†[ref]11, in which a smooth function quantifies the ‚ÄúDAG-ness‚Äù of the graph. Due to its high complexity and NP-hard characterization, further researches seek to improve on this or relax the constraint¬†[ref]14  [ref]25   . Some work takes a reinforcement learning method to causal discovery, such as RL-BIC proposed by¬†. Authors generate directed graphs using an encoder-decoder neural network model as the ‚Äúactor‚Äù and using BIC score and some penalty terms for cycles in graphs as a reward signal to score these candidate graphs. Further,  extends this work to ordering-based reinforcement learning (CORL) to learn the optimal order of variables. In order to further reduce the problem size. Recently,  proposes RCL-OG, which is a reinforcement learning based approach replacing the Markov chain Monte Carlo method with the order graph to model different DAG\ntopological orderings.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: where dùëëd is the number of nodes, which is an NP-hard problem.
