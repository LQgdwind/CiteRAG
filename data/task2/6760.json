      "content": "Paper Title: Analysis of Loss and Crosstalk Noise in MZI-based Coherent Silicon Photonic Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile several coherent SP-NNs have been recently proposed [ref]24 , the work in   showed that the inferencing accuracy of such networks can drop by up to 90% due to fabrication-process variations and thermal crosstalk. In addition to such variations, the work in  explored the impact of optical loss and phase noise in MZIs for the Diamond SP-NN configuration and showed that the SP-NN’s inferencing accuracy can drop to below 20% when scaling the network in the presence of phase errors and MZI losses. However, the work in  simply assumed that the loss in different devices in a network to be normally distributed (irrespective of their phase settings). The work in  systematically analyzed the impact of loss and crosstalk in SP-NNs. However, the loss and crosstalk models presented in  are not a function of the phase settings of the MZIs. Hence, only the maximum and minimum loss and crosstalk are calculated. In addition, the models illustrated in  cannot be extended to OIUs of any arbitrary configuration.\nAs the size and complexity of emerging SP-NNs increase to handle more complex tasks, the total insertion loss accumulated in the network increases as well. This necessitates the use of power-hungry optical amplification devices  and higher laser power at the input. Uncertainties due to fabrication-process variations—the analysis of which is beyond the scope of this paper—in the two DCs in an MZI can degrade the extinction ratio (ER) of the device which, in turn, will increase the loss and crosstalk in the output . Yet, no prior work comprehensively analyzes the impact of optical loss and crosstalk noise in coherent SP-NNs from the device to the system level. Although the work in  suggests that using silicon nitride instead of silicon to implement MZI-based SP-NNs as a possible solution to reduce losses, the performance degradation due to coherent crosstalk in SP-NNs still remains unaddressed. Different from the aforementioned work, this paper presents a comprehensive modeling framework for the optical loss and coherent crosstalk noise in coherent SP-NNs. The proposed loss and crosstalk analysis at the MZI device level takes into account the phase settings on the device. In addition, the models developed at the network level are adaptable meaning that the number of inputs/outputs and layers in SP-NNs can vary to explore SP-NN optical power penalty and scalability constraints while evaluating average and worst-case optical loss and crosstalk. Compared to our prior work in , we extended our analysis for two more well-known SP-NN configurations (Reck and Diamond) in addition to the Clements configurations. We show that our proposed models can be applied to any SP-NN with any configuration, proving their versatility. We present a comprehensive analysis of the laser power penalty and inferencing accuracy loss in SP-NNs due to optical loss and crosstalk noise. In addition, we present an analysis of the effect of optical loss and crosstalk when optoelectronic NAUs are used in the SP-NNs. We also present a detailed analysis of scalability constraints of SP-NNs due to optical loss and crosstalk when a single OIU is being used as a processing unit to carry out the computations in the optical domain.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: While several coherent SP-NNs have been recently proposed [ref]24 , the work in   showed that the inferencing accuracy of such networks can drop by up to 90% due to fabrication-process variations and thermal crosstalk.
