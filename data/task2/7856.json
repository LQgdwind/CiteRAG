      "content": "Paper Title: Floorplanning with I/O Assignment via Feasibility-Seeking and Superiorization Methods\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFloorplanning: The methods can be broadly divided into discrete meta-heuristic methods, discrete exact methods (e.g., branch-and-bound (B&B) methods), continuous analytical methods, and learning-based methods. Discrete methods encompass two primary categories: meta-heuristic methods and exact methods. Meta-heuristic methods are employed to seek sub-optimal solutions, while exact methods strive to achieve optimality. They typically employ a representation, such as sequence pair¬†, B‚àósuperscriptùêµB^{*}-tree¬† or constraint graph¬†, to encode the relative positions of modules. Subsequently, they search for a solution within the representation space and decode it to obtain the corresponding floorplan. Anand et al.¬† utilize a B‚àósuperscriptùêµB^{*}-tree representation and propose a heuristic based on simulated annealing (SA) to find floorplans with minimized dead space. Funke et al.¬† employ a constraint graph and a B&B method to achieve wirelength-optimal floorplans while considering specific sets of blocked regions. The multilevel heuristic reduces solution space by clustering or partitioning, handling large-scale problems. Chen et al.¬† present IMF, starting with min-cut partitioning and merging via SA with B‚àósuperscriptùêµB^{*}-tree. Yan et al.¬† propose DeFer based on deferred decision-making, using the generalized slicing tree and an enumerate packing technique to defer the decision on the slicing structure, followed by block swapping and mirroring to enhance wirelength. Ji et al.¬† introduce QinFer, recursively bipartitioning the circuit into leaf subcircuits for distributed floorplanning, optimizing wirelength, employing a Quasi-Newton method to reduce overlap, and enhancing robustness with a refined distribution algorithm. Analytical methods model floorplanning as a continuous optimization problem with quadratic¬†[ref]21 or nonlinear¬† objective functions. Typically, these methods involve a global floorplanning step to obtain approximate positions for all modules, followed by a legalization step to eliminate overlaps and obtain the precise positions of the modules. Zhan et al.¬†[ref]21 use the bell-shaped function to smooth the density function in global floorplanning and generate a corresponding sequence pair and obtain a floorplan without any overlap between modules for legalization. Lin et al.¬† solve floorplanning with voltage-island constraints by a two-stage method. A density-driven nonlinear analytical method is firstly applied in global floorplanning, then a slicing tree is built to record the global distribution result and to determine the final feasible result in the legalization step. Lin et al.¬† propose a multi-level thermal-aware floorplanning method which integrates the analytical thermal model into the non-linear placement model, enabling approximate temperature and minimizing wirelength at the same time. Li et al.¬† present an analytical method based on Poisson‚Äôs equation in global floorplanning, and utilize a constraint graph-based legalization approach for floorplanning with soft modules. Recently learning-based algorithms, especially reinforcement learning and graph neural network, have gained great popularity. GoodFloorplan¬† combines graph convolutional network and reinforcement learning to explore the design space effectively. Liu et al¬† employ graph attention to learn an optimized mapping between circuit connectivity and physical wirelength, and produce a chip floorplan using efficient model inference. I/O pin assignment, impacting the total wirelength in the order of 5%¬†, significantly influences the circuit performance. Several works incorporate it in floorplanning or placement. I/O pin assignment is to find locations of I/O pins along the boundaries of the chip. Modern analytical methods iteratively handle cell placement and I/O pin assignment, using I/O pin locations as a starting set of ‚Äúanchors‚Äù to placement¬†. Westra and Groeneveld¬† extend the quadratic placement formulation to make concurrent global placement of cells and I/O pins. Banderia et al¬† proposed a Hungarian matching-based heuristic, I/O Placer, which adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy for fast and scalable I/O assignment. This work is part of the OpenROAD project¬†. MAP:\nThis is a method for handling the FSP. For the convex case, the method is also referred to as ‚Äúprojection onto convex sets‚Äù (POCS)¬†, and exhibits convergence¬† when the sets have a nonempty intersection, or cyclic convergence¬† with empty intersection of sets under certain configurations. For the FSP with non-convex sets, recent literature studies the convergence of the so-called Douglas‚ÄìRachford (DR) method, see, e.g., . For FSP with two closed sets, Bauschke et al.¬† prove local convergence of the DR method to a fixed point when each of the sets is a finite union of convex sets and observe the cyclic phenomenon under more general non-convex sets. Artacho et al.¬† establish global convergence and describe the global behavior of the DR method for the problem which involves finding a point in the intersection of a half-space and a non-convex set with well-quasi-ordering property or a property weaker than compactness. However, DR is suited for the two-set case and is not simple to extend to problems under diverse constraints in practice. There is limited theoretical work available on the general MAP for the non-convex case, particularly when dealing with union convex sets.\nSt√©phane et al.¬†[ref]37 prove the convergence of MAP under some strict conditions. SM:\nA recent tutorial¬† on the SM\nprovides valuable insights into the SM and references numerous recent works and sources on this subject. Blake Schultze et al.¬† apply the total\nvariation superiorization to image reconstruction in proton computed\ntomography to improve the result. Since its inception in 2007, the SM has evolved and gained ground, as can be seen from the, compiled and continuously updated, bibliography at: http://math.haifa.ac.il/yair/bib-superiorization-censor.html#top. Inspired by their approach, we propose\nhere a wirelength-superiorized FSP algorithm for floorplanning.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: a Quasi-Newton method to reduce overlap, and enhancing robustness with a refined distribution algorithm.
