      "content": "Paper Title: Motion Planning Diffusion: Learning and Planning of Robot Motions with Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFew works have explored using score-based and diffusion models in robotics. At task planning levels,  recently proposes DALL-E-Bot, which generates a text description from a scene image and then prompts the text-to-image generator DALL-E [ref]28 for a “goal scene”, thus identifying the desired poses. [ref]35 proposes StructDiffusion for arranging objects based on language commands, by predicting the object arrangements using a language-conditioned diffusion model. On learning fine-grained trajectory structure, recently, diffusion models have been used to generate human-like motions .\nIn our previous work , we showed a simple example of how to use conditioned score-based models to generate trajectories for different environments. Mostly similar to our work,  used diffusion to learn cost functions for jointly optimizing motion and grasping poses in SE(333).\n[ref]38 introduced the Diffuser, a trajectory generative model used for planning in Offline RL and long-horizon tasks.\n proposes the Decision Diffuser learned over position-only trajectories that can be conditioned with classifier-free guidance skill generation or constraint satisfaction. In contrast to these works, we bring diffusion models closer to motion planners, by incorporating diffusion models as priors combined with differentiable cost likelihoods and also by learning higher trajectory derivatives. We show that, via our formulation, we can directly sample optimal trajectories from the posterior by following the reverse diffusion sampling process, contrasting to sampling from the optimized proposal distribution as in .\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: and diffusion models in robotics.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
