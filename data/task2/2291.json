      "content": "Paper Title: Logarithmic Weisfeiler-Leman Identifies All Planar Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm is a well-known combinatorial\nprocedure for detecting symmetries in graphs. It is widely used in approaches to tackle the graph-isomorphism problem, both from a theoretical (  4) and from a practical perspective ([ref]7   2).\nThe algorithm is derived from a technique called naïve vertex classification (or Colour Refinement), which may be viewed\nas the 111-dimensional version WL1superscriptWL1\\textsf{WL}^{1} of the WL\nalgorithm. For every k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1, the k𝑘k-dimensional WL algorithm\n(WLksuperscriptWL𝑘\\textsf{WL}^{k}) iteratively colours k𝑘k-tuples of vertices of a\ngraph by propagating local information until it reaches a stable colouring. Weisfeiler and Leman introduced the 2-dimensional version\nWL2superscriptWL2\\textsf{WL}^{2}, today known as the classical WL algorithm, in\n. The algorithm WLksuperscriptWL𝑘\\textsf{WL}^{k} can be\nimplemented to run in time O​(nk+1​log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛𝑘1𝑛O(n^{k+1}\\log n) on graphs of order n𝑛n\n. The algorithm has striking connections to numerous areas of mathematics\nand computer science,\nwhich surely is a reason why research on it has been active since its\nintroduction over half a century ago. For example, there are tight connections to\nlinear and semidefinite programming   0, homomorphism\ncounting  , and the algebra of coherent\nconfigurations . Most recently, the WL algorithm has been applied in several interesting machine-learning contexts\n 6 3 4 9. A very strong and highly exploited link between the algorithm and\nlogic was established by Immerman and Lander  and\nCai, Fürer, and Immerman : WLksuperscriptWL𝑘\\textsf{WL}^{k} assigns the same\ncolour to two k𝑘k-tuples of vertices if and only if these tuples satisfy the same formulas of the (k+1)𝑘1(k+1)-variable fragment\nCk+1superscriptC𝑘1\\textsf{C}^{k+1} of first-order logic with counting\nquantifiers. Cai, Fürer, and Immerman \nused this correspondence and an Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé game\nthat characterises equivalence for the\nlogic Ck+1superscriptC𝑘1\\textsf{C}^{k+1} to prove that, for every k𝑘k, there are\nnon-isomorphic graphs\nof order O​(k)𝑂𝑘O(k) that are not distinguished by WLksuperscriptWL𝑘\\textsf{WL}^{k}. Here we say that WLksuperscriptWL𝑘\\textsf{WL}^{k} distinguishes two graphs if WLksuperscriptWL𝑘\\textsf{WL}^{k} computes different stable colourings on them, that\nis, there is some colour such that the numbers of k𝑘k-tuples of that\ncolour differ in the two graphs. We say that WLksuperscriptWL𝑘\\textsf{WL}^{k}\nidentifies a graph G𝐺G if it distinguishes G𝐺G from all graphs\nG′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} that are not isomorphic to G𝐺G. It has been shown that for suitable\nconstants k𝑘k, the algorithm WLksuperscriptWL𝑘\\textsf{WL}^{k} identifies all planar graphs 3, all\ngraphs of bounded tree width 8, and all graphs in many\nother natural graph classes 2 4 5 7 9. For\nsome of these classes, fairly tight bounds for the optimal value of k𝑘k,\ncalled the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) dimension, are known. Notably,\ninterval graphs have WL dimension 222 2, graphs of\ntree width k𝑘k have WL dimension in the range ⌈k/2⌉−3𝑘23\\lceil k/2\\rceil-3 to k𝑘k\n6, and, most relevant for us, planar graphs have WL dimension\n222 or 333 7. Another parameter of the WL\nalgorithm that has received recent attention is the number of\niterations it needs to reach its final, stable colouring.\nSince a set of size nksuperscript𝑛𝑘n^{k} can only be partitioned\nnk−1superscript𝑛𝑘1n^{k}-1 times, a natural upper bound on the number of\niterations to reach the final output is nk−1superscript𝑛𝑘1n^{k}-1 (n𝑛n always denotes the number of\nvertices of the input graph). This bound cannot be improved for WL1superscriptWL1\\textsf{WL}^{1}, since there are infinitely many\ngraphs on which the algorithm takes n−1𝑛1n-1 iterations to compute its final output\n5. However, for WL2superscriptWL2\\textsf{WL}^{2}, it was shown that the bound\nΘ​(n2)Θsuperscript𝑛2\\Theta(n^{2}) is asymptotically not tight 8. Currently, the best upper bound on the iteration number for WL2superscriptWL2\\textsf{WL}^{2} is\nO​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) 0. The number of iterations of WLksuperscriptWL𝑘\\textsf{WL}^{k} is crucial for the\nparallelisability of the algorithm: for ℓ≥log⁡nℓ𝑛\\ell\\geq\\log n, it holds that ℓℓ\\ell\niterations of WLksuperscriptWL𝑘\\textsf{WL}^{k} can be simulated in O​(ℓ)𝑂ℓO(\\ell) steps on a PRAM\nwith O​(nk)𝑂superscript𝑛𝑘O(n^{k}) processors 1 9. In particular, if for a class\n𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} of graphs, all G,G′∈𝒞𝐺superscript𝐺′𝒞G,G^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{C} (of order n𝑛n) can be distinguished\nby WLksuperscriptWL𝑘\\textsf{WL}^{k} in O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) iterations, then the isomorphism problem\nfor graphs in 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is in the complexity class AC1superscriptAC1\\textsf{AC}^{1}. Grohe and\nVerbitsky 1 proved that this is the case for all classes\nof graphs of bounded tree width and all maps (graphs embedded into a\nsurface together with a rotation system specifying the embedding), and\nVerbitsky 6 proved it for the class of 3-connected planar\ngraphs.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: combinatorial\nprocedure for detecting symmetries in graphs.
