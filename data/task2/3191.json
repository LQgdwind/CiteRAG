      "content": "Paper Title: An Interpretive Constrained Linear Model for ResNet and MgNet\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn , a unified neural network framework was proposed, known as MgNet, to establish the connections between ResNet-type CNNs and multigrid methods. In that work, the basic block of MgNet was first introduced, as in (1.4). These elementary components in block 1.4, including the residual term f−A∗u𝑓∗𝐴𝑢f-A\\ast u, the convolutional operators A𝐴A and Bisuperscript𝐵𝑖B^{i}, the activation functions σ𝜎\\sigma, and the positions of these two σ𝜎\\sigma, were initially motivated by the deep connection between multigrid methods and ResNet. However, a natural interpretation of the underlying mechanism of the basic block iteration is still lacking  (1.4).\nFurthermore, in this paper we propose the constrained linear model to interpret the basic block (1.4) from the iterative method perspective.\nBefore MgNet, ideas and techniques from multigrid methods had been used to develop efficient CNNs.\nThe researchers who developed ResNet 7 first took the multigrid methods as evidence to support what is known as a residual representation for the interpretation of ResNet.\nFurther,    adopted multi-resolution ideas to improve the performance of their networks.\nAdditionally, a CNN model with a structure similar to that of the V-cycle multigrid was proposed to address volumetric medical image segmentation and biomedical image segmentation in [ref]40 .\nThe literature also includes studies focused on applying deep learning techniques in multigrid and numerical PDEs  . Considering the connections between CNN models and some computational mathematics methods,\nresearchers have also proposed the dynamic system or optimization perspective \n   6 .\nA key motivation of the dynamic systems viewpoint is that the iterative scheme xi=xi−1+f​(xi−1)superscript𝑥𝑖superscript𝑥𝑖1𝑓superscript𝑥𝑖1x^{i}=x^{i-1}+f(x^{i-1}) in pre-act ResNet resembles the forward Euler scheme in numerical dynamic systems.\nFollowing this idea,  3 interpreted the data flow in ResNet as the solution of the transport equation in the characteristic line.\nFurthermore, 6 interpreted some different CNN models with residual block as some special discretization schemes for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), for example PloyNet 6, FractalNet 9, and RevNet .\nIgnoring the specific discretization methods,  proposed a family of CNN models based on black-box solvers for ODEs.\nSome types of CNN architecture are further designed based on the iterative schemes of optimization algorithms   2.\nThese studies share the philosophy that many optimization algorithms\ncan be considered as discretization schemes for some special ODEs . Considering the resemble properties of ResNet,  5 claim that ResNet is an ensemble of shallower models, and that discarding the intermediate residual block does not influence the model accuracy. 1 8 point out that ResNet optimizes the risk in a functional space by combining an ensemble of effective features.\nIn addition, some works, such as  3 , propose to study the generalization and smoothness properties of ResNet from the Neural Tangent Kernel perspective.\nAs for the approximation properties of ResNet, 4 demonstrates that a very deep ResNet with stacked modules, that have one neuron per hidden layer, and ReLU activation functions can uniformly approximate any Lebesgue integrable function. Recently, 4 studied and proved the approximation properties of ResNet and MgNet with multi-channel 3×3333\\times 3 kernels for functions with image-type inputs, i.e. functions defined on ℝd×dsuperscriptℝ𝑑𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times d}.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: their networks.\nAdditionally, a CNN model with a structure similar to that of the V-cycle multigrid was proposed to address volumetric medical image segmentation and biomedical image segmentation in [ref]40 .\nThe literature also includes studies focused on applying deep learning techniques in multigrid and numerical PDEs  .
