      "content": "Paper Title: LoMOE: Localized Multi-Object Editing via Multi-Diffusion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this work, we employ a pretrained Stable Diffusion  model, denoted as ΦΦ\\Phi. This model encodes an input image 𝐱0∈𝒳=ℝ512×512×3subscript𝐱0𝒳superscriptℝ5125123\\mathbf{x}_{0}\\in\\mathcal{X}=\\mathbb{R}^{512\\times 512\\times 3} into a latent code x0∈ℝ64×64×4subscript𝑥0superscriptℝ64644x_{0}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{64\\times 64\\times 4}. Given an image 𝐱0subscript𝐱0\\mathbf{x}_{0} and it’s corresponding latent code x0subscript𝑥0x_{0}, inversion entails finding a latent xi​n​vsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑛𝑣x_{inv} which reconstructs x0subscript𝑥0x_{0} upon sampling. In a DDPM [ref]20, the inversion step is defined by the forward diffusion process, which involves Gaussian noise perturbation (ϵt∼𝒩​(0,I))similar-tosubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡𝒩0𝐼\\big{(}\\epsilon_{t}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\,I)\\big{)} for a fixed number of timesteps t∈[T]𝑡delimited-[]𝑇t\\in[T], governed by Eqs. 1 and 2. where αtsubscript𝛼𝑡\\alpha_{t} represents a prefixed noise schedule. But given the stochastic nature of the DDPM forward and reverse process which leads to poor reconstruction upon sampling, we adopt a deterministic DDIM reverse process [ref]42 7 which is deterministic when σt=0subscript𝜎𝑡0\\sigma_{t}=0 ∀for-all\\forall t𝑡t, where the family 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} of inference distributions is parameterized by σ∈ℝ+T𝜎subscriptsuperscriptℝ𝑇\\sigma\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T}_{+}. During training, a neural network ϵθ​(xt,t)subscriptitalic-ϵ𝜃subscript𝑥𝑡𝑡\\epsilon_{\\theta}(x_{t},t) learns to predict the noise ϵtsubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡\\epsilon_{t} added to a sample xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t}. Additionally, this network can also be conditioned on text, images, or embeddings , denoted by ϵθ​(xt,t,c,⊘)subscriptitalic-ϵ𝜃subscript𝑥𝑡𝑡𝑐⊘\\epsilon_{\\theta}(x_{t},t,c,\\oslash), where c𝑐c is the encoded text condition (using CLIP ) and ⊘⊘\\oslash is the null condition. In our case, xi​n​vsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑛𝑣x_{inv} is obtained by providing c0subscript𝑐0c_{0} corresponding to 𝐱0subscript𝐱0\\mathbf{x}_{0} that is generated using a text-embedding framework such as BLIP . 7 observe that the inverted noise maps generated by DDIM Inversion ϵθ​(xt,t,c,⊘)∈ℝ64×64×4subscriptitalic-ϵ𝜃subscript𝑥𝑡𝑡𝑐⊘superscriptℝ64644\\epsilon_{\\theta}\\left(x_{t},t,c,\\oslash\\right)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{64\\times 64\\times 4} do not follow the statistical properties of uncorrelated, white gaussian noise in most cases, causing poor editability. Thus as in  7, we softly enforce gaussianity using a pairwise regularization ℒp​a​i​rsubscriptℒ𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑟\\mathcal{L}_{pair} 7 and a divergence loss ℒK​Lsubscriptℒ𝐾𝐿\\mathcal{L}_{KL}  weighted by λ𝜆\\lambda. (Details of these losses can be found in Sec. 1 of the supplementary material). Inversion provides us with a good starting point for the editing process, compared to starting from a random latent code (refer Sec. 2.1 of the supplementary material for details). However, if we use the standard diffusion process for our edit process, then we will not have control over local regions in the image using simple prompts. To tackle this, we use a MultiDiffusion  process for localized multi-object editing.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: and it’s corresponding latent code x0subscript𝑥0x_{0}, inversion entails finding a latent xi​n​vsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑛𝑣x_{inv} which reconstructs x0subscript𝑥0x_{0} upon sampling.
