      "content": "Paper Title: Finite-Time Analysis of Asynchronous Q-learning under Diminishing Step-Size from Control-Theoretic View\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe recent paper  derives sample complexity in terms of the probability tail bounds using the adaptive step-size where d^min,ksubscript^𝑑𝑘\\hat{d}_{\\min,k} is a number that is updated at every iteration, and c𝑐c is some universal constant. Note that the step-size does not depend on dminsubscript𝑑d_{\\min} or the mixing time, while it requires an additional step to update d^min,ksubscript^𝑑𝑘\\hat{d}_{\\min,k}, which brings in additional complexity compared to our diminishing step-size. Moreover, their update requires a state-action dependent process, the number of times that the current state-action visits a certain state-action pair, which requires 𝒪​(|𝒮|​|𝒜|)𝒪𝒮𝒜{\\cal O}(|{\\cal S}||{\\cal A}|) memory space. With the help of concentration inequality in Markov chain  and refined analysis based on number of visits to (s,a)𝑠𝑎(s,a), probability tail bounds can be obtained as well. Another recent paper  uses a step-size that satisfies the constraint where and for some constant c𝑐c to derive sample complexity in terms of the expectation using analysis based on Moreau envelope . Under ergodic assumption, it derives 𝒪​(tmix​(αk)k)𝒪subscript𝑡mixsubscript𝛼𝑘𝑘\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{t_{\\text{mix}}(\\alpha_{k})}{k}}\\right) where tmix​(αk)subscript𝑡mixsubscript𝛼𝑘t_{\\text{mix}}(\\alpha_{k}) is upper bounded by logarithmic term.\nThe study in  showed that extending the analysis of [ref]6 and using the step-size 1k1𝑘\\frac{1}{k} lead to sample complexity depending polynomially on 11−γ11𝛾\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}.\nThe paper  uses the diminishing step-size αk=hk+k0subscript𝛼𝑘ℎ𝑘subscript𝑘0\\alpha_{k}=\\frac{h}{k+k_{0}} with where h≥4dmin​(1−γ)ℎ4subscript𝑑1𝛾h\\geq\\frac{4}{d_{\\min}(1-\\gamma)} to derive sample complexity in terms of probability tail bounds. The recent progress  proved that analysis on decomposition of error term into shifted Martingale terms leads to probability tail bounds. Most of the previous and recent analysis uses step-sizes with the associated conditions that depend on the mixing time, whereas our work uses a diminishing step-size that is independent of the mixing time. Therefore, our analysis covers different scenarios. With the construction of the upper and lower comparison systems, both of which can be analyzed without injecting the mixing time into the step-size condition, we can derive the convergence rate of the original system.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: where tmix​(αk)subscript𝑡mixsubscript𝛼𝑘t_{\\text{mix}}(\\alpha_{k}) is upper bounded by logarithmic term.\nThe study in  showed that extending the analysis of [ref]6 and using the step-size 1k1𝑘\\frac{1}{k} lead to sample complexity depending polynomially on 11−γ11𝛾\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}.\nThe paper  uses the diminishing step-size\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
