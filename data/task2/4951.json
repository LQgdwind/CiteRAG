      "content": "Paper Title: No-Box Attacks on 3D Point Cloud Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPointNet [ref]28 was a pioneering approach for DNN-based point cloud analysis. Learnt features are extracted from individual points in the input point cloud and then aggregated to global features via max-pooling. As a result of these global features, a shape can be summarized by a sparse set of key points, also called the critical point set. The authors of PointNet showed that any set of points between the critical point set and another set called the upper bound shape will give the same set of global features, and thus lead to the same network decision. While this proved a certain level of robustness of PointNet to input perturbations, it also pointed to strong reliance on the critical point set, which was subsequently used to design various adversarial attacks. PointNet has inspired much subsequent work on DNN-based point cloud analysis, of which we review only three approaches subsequently used in our experiments. One of these is PointNet++ [ref]29, a hierarchical network designed to capture fine geometric structures in a point cloud. Three layers make up PointNet++: the sampling layer, the grouping layer, and the PointNet-based learning layer. These three layers are repeated in PointNet++ to learn local geometric structures.\nAnother representative work is Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) [ref]30. It exploits local geometric structures by creating a local neighborhood graph and using convolution-like operations on the edges connecting neighboring pairs of points. PointConv  is another architecture that extends PointNet by incorporating convolutional layers that work on 3D point clouds. To better handle local features in point cloud data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used to approximate weight functions, and inverse density scale is used to re-weight these functions.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: PointNet [ref]28 was a pioneering approach for DNN-based point cloud analysis.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
