      "content": "Paper Title: One Transformer for All Time Series: Representing and Training with Time-Dependent Heterogeneous Tabular Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we compare UniTTab with different state-of-the-art approaches using different datasets and tasks. Pollution prediction task. This is the regression task presented in Section¬†5.1 and based on the Pollution Dataset. We report two main types of results:\nbased on LSTM training and on directly fine-tuning the pre-trained model.\nThe former is based on the protocol proposed by Padhi et¬†al. , and trains a separate LSTM using\nthe\nvectors ùíõ1,‚Ä¶,ùíõtsubscriptùíõ1‚Ä¶subscriptùíõùë°\\boldsymbol{z}_{1},...,\\boldsymbol{z}_{t} (Sections¬†3 and¬†4) as input and the labels of the downstream task as the supervision.\nHowever, the latter, proposed here, is likely a much more natural choice, and it is coherent with most of the recent AI literature, where the backbone network, after pre-training, is directly fine-tuned for a specific downstream task without training a separate network. Specifically, when we fine-tune either UniTTab or TabBERT, we include a [CLS] token in the input sequence of the Sequence Transformer and we use the corresponding ùíõ[MASK]subscriptùíõ[MASK]\\boldsymbol{z}_{\\texttt{[MASK]}} as input to a shallow MLP dedicated to the specific task.\nIn case of LUNA [ref]22, we report the results we obtained using its public code and only the LSTM training (adopted also in [ref]22), because fine-tuning this method requires non-trivial modifications of its architecture. In all the experiments and for all the models, we keep fixed the time series length to t=10ùë°10t=10 rows as specified in .\nIn Tables¬†3 and¬†4 we show the results obtained with our partition of the dataset and the original partition, respectively (see Section¬†5.1), where the experiments in Table¬†3 have been repeated 5 times with different random seeds.\nNote that the random seed is used both to initialize the models‚Äô parameters and to randomly split the time series in training and testing splits.\nIn all cases, UniTTab drastically outperforms both TabBERT and LUNA, and, as expected, direct fine-tuning significantly improves over the separate LSTM training. In the same tables we also report the results obtained using both XGBoost [ref]4\nand CatBoost [ref]31, which are the state-of-the-art non Deep Learning based methods for tabular data\n(Section¬†1). Specifically,\nsince both XGBoost and CatBoost cannot directly work on (variable-length) time series, we used a standard library  to extract features from a time series. These ‚Äúengineered‚Äù features include field-specific statistics (e.g., the mean or the variance for numerical features and the mode for the categorical ones, etc.), autocorrelation with different ‚Äúlags‚Äù, the number of local minima and maxima, etc. Moreover, the features are automatically pre-selected using a Filter feature selection method on a validation set extracted and separated from the training data.\nFinally, we used grid search on the validation dataset\nto set the optimal values of the XGBoost and the CatBoost hyperparameters (e.g., the number of trees, the max depth of each tree, etc.).\nAfter feature selection and hyperparameter tuning, the validation set is merged with the training set and XGBoost/CatBoost are re-trained\nusing the same data adopted for training the LSTMs or fine-tuning the UniTTab/TabBERT models.\nWe will use this procedure (task and dataset dependent feature selection and hyperparameter tuning) for XGBoost CatBoost in all the other\ndownstream tasks of this paper. The results in Tables¬†3 and¬†4 show that, most of the time, all the Deep Learning methods significantly outperform both XGBoost and CatBoost, and, specifically, fine-tuning UniTTab leads, respectlively, to more than 21 RMSE points (our partition) and more than 14 RMSE points (original partition) of improvement over these Boosted Decision Trees methods. Fraud detection task. For this task, we adopt the Transaction Dataset introduced in , which is a synthetic dataset created with heuristic rules to generate realistic credit card transactions (see Figure¬†1).\nThe dataset is composed of\n24M transactions from 20,000\nusers. There are k=10ùëò10k=10 attributes, which become k=13ùëò13k=13 when the time stamp is split in 4 different fields.\nA time series is composed of t=10ùë°10t=10 transactions (i.e., rows), all extracted from the transaction history of the same user and using a sliding window with a stride of 5.\nThis led to a total number of 4.87M time series, which are used in the pre-training phase. The Fraud detection downstream task\nis a binary classification task based on the prediction of the fraudulent label, associated with a subset of samples.\nFollowing , we use\n1.9M labeled samples (with t=10ùë°10t=10) for the supervised training stage. Since the positive and the negative classes are highly unbalanced, the positive samples are upsampled (for more details, we refer to ). The testing set is composed of 487K time series. The results reported in Table¬†5 show that UniTTab\noutperforms all the compared methods, independently on whether an LSTM is used or not.\nSimilarly to the Pollution prediction task, in Table¬†5 we also report the results obtained using both XGBoost and CatBoost, with task and dataset specific features and hyperparameters (see above). Similarly to the Pollution prediction task, also in the\nFraud detection task, UniTTab significantly outperforms both XGBoost and CatBoost. Loan default prediction task.\nFor this task, we use the PKDD‚Äô99 Financial Dataset ,\nwhich is a\ncollection of real anonymized financial data of a Czech bank. Besides other client specific information (which we do not use), this dataset contains bank account transactions of 4,500 clients.\nWe use k=ùëòabsentk= 6 fields to represent each transaction (row),\nwhich become k=8ùëò8k=8 after splitting the time stamp in 3 different fields.\nOn average, the full history of transactions for a given client is 232.\nTo increase the number of time series available for pre-training, we set a maximum length value tm‚Äãa‚Äãxsubscriptùë°ùëöùëéùë•t_{max}, and we use\ntime series with variable length tùë°t, where t‚â§tm‚Äãa‚Äãxùë°subscriptùë°ùëöùëéùë•t\\leq t_{max}.\nSpecifically,\nfor each client, assuming that\nta‚Äãl‚Äãlsubscriptùë°ùëéùëôùëôt_{all} is her/his total number of transactions,\nif ta‚Äãl‚Äãl<tm‚Äãa‚Äãxsubscriptùë°ùëéùëôùëôsubscriptùë°ùëöùëéùë•t_{all}<t_{max}, then we use t=ta‚Äãl‚Äãlùë°subscriptùë°ùëéùëôùëôt=t_{all}. Otherwise, at each pre-training iteration we randomly select a time series ùíîùíî\\boldsymbol{s} of t=tm‚Äãa‚Äãxùë°subscriptùë°ùëöùëéùë•t=t_{max} consecutive transactions over the sequence of all possible ta‚Äãl‚Äãlsubscriptùë°ùëéùëôùëôt_{all} rows of that client.\nIn Table¬†6 we present results with tm‚Äãa‚Äãxsubscriptùë°ùëöùëéùë•t_{max} ranging from 50 to 150.\nThis experiment is important to test whether a model dealing with time series can operate in real life scenarios where the actual row sequence length can be very long, and it differs from the previous experiments in which tùë°t was fixed to 10.\nSpecifically,\nthe Loan default prediction task is a binary classification task consisting in\npredicting how likely a client is going to default the loan.\nFor this downstream task, we use 682 clients, jointly with their loan ground truth label,\nwhich, following , are\nsplit in 478 clients for training and 204 for testing, and we\nreport the average results obtained with 5 random splits.\nNote that we removed (from the pre-training, the fine-tuning and the testing data) all those transactions directly related to the loan payment.\nMoreover, both at fine-tuning and at testing time, we cut the transaction history of each client before the loan started.\nWe fine-tune the models similarly to the Fraud detection task (i.e., using a [CLS] token, etc.).\nBoth in the fine-tuning and in the testing stage, the length tùë°t of a transaction is variable. However, differently from the pre-training stage, if ta‚Äãl‚Äãl>tm‚Äãa‚Äãxsubscriptùë°ùëéùëôùëôsubscriptùë°ùëöùëéùë•t_{all}>t_{max}, then we select the last tm‚Äãa‚Äãxsubscriptùë°ùëöùëéùë•t_{max} transactions. Table¬†6 shows that, most of the time, UniTTab outperforms both TabBERT\nand LUNA,\nespecially when using very long sequences (tm‚Äãa‚Äãx=150subscriptùë°ùëöùëéùë•150t_{max}=150).\nThe bottom of that table shows the results of XGBoost and CatBoost, with the usual dataset and task specific features and hyperparameters selection. Additionally,\nwe also report the result obtained by\nXu \nusing Random Forests with 18 features, some of which are computed extracting aggregated information from the time series, while others\nare socio-demographic information about the client which all the other methods do not use.\nThe F1 scores for this highly unbalanced dataset show that UniTTab with long sequences (tm‚Äãa‚Äãx=150subscriptùë°ùëöùëéùë•150t_{max}=150) significantly outperforms Random Forests and Boosting Decision Trees, while being comparable to them when using the other metrics.\nNote that this is the smallest over the four datasets we use in this paper, and, most likely, the lack of sufficient data for the unsupervised pre-training stage, makes weaker the Deep Learning methods (our UniTTab included) in this scenario (see Section¬†5.3 for more details). Churn prediction task.\nIn this last battery of experiments, we use our RBAT Dataset provided by an international bank111For both privacy and commercial reasons, this dataset cannot be released., which is composed of several hundred thousands real bank account transactions of private clients. From this datasets, we\nhave randomly selected 100K bank accounts, corresponding to about 32.5M transactions (i.e., rows), which we used for both pre-training and fine-tuning on the donwstream task (see later), and another 20K accounts used for testing the donwstream task.\nThe considered transactions span about 2 years, from 2021 to 2022. For a given account, the average transaction history length is 325.\nThere are n=3ùëõ3n=3 types of transactions (see Section¬†3):\n(1) generic transactions, with kg=5subscriptùëòùëî5k_{g}=5 fields, (2) POS transactions, with kp=8subscriptùëòùëù8k_{p}=8 fields and (3) ATM transactions, with ka=7subscriptùëòùëé7k_{a}=7 fields. Since the generic transaction fields are shared also by the other two types of transactions, the total number of different fields is 10, which become 12 when the time stamp is split in 3 different fields (day, month, year).\nIn the future, we plan to extend our experiments with larger portions of this dataset, including other types of transactions (n>3ùëõ3n>3). In the pre-training stage, we use 100K different accounts.\nFor data augmentation, we follow the same protocol adopted when pre-training on the PKDD‚Äô99 Financial Dataset, i.e., we use time series of variable length t‚â§tm‚Äãa‚Äãxùë°subscriptùë°ùëöùëéùë•t\\leq t_{max}, extracted at random at each iteration from the whole history of each account. We use tm‚Äãa‚Äãx=150subscriptùë°ùëöùëéùë•150t_{max}=150.\nSince the baseline\nTabBERT cannot deal with different types of transactions and needs a fixed number of fields for each row, when training TabBERT we concatenate all the\nk=10ùëò10k=10 fields of all the row types. In a given row ùíìùíì\\boldsymbol{r}, the field values of those attributes which are not included in the type of ùíìùíì\\boldsymbol{r}, are represented using a [MISSING] token.\nNote that this solution is computationally more expensive, especially in the Field Transformer, where the computation costs grow quadratically with kùëòk, and the computational gain of our proposal is larger when nùëõn is bigger.\nFor ablation reasons (see Section¬†5.1), we also train a modified version of TabBERT in which we introduce the Row-type dependent embedding (Section¬†4) with no additional change.\nThis baseline corresponds to the baseline used in Table¬†1 (first entry), on top of which we add the Row-type dependent embedding described in Section¬†4, thus we call it ‚ÄúTabBERT + Variable Row Types‚Äù (TabBERT + VRT). The Churn prediction task consists in predicting a bank account closure\nafter a period of one\nmonth from the last transaction considered.\nIn more detail, at inference time,\ngiven a time series ùíîùíî\\boldsymbol{s}, extracted from a given bank account,\nthe model should predict a possible closure of that account which can happen\nany day of the month following the last transaction contained in ùíîùíî\\boldsymbol{s}\n(which is a supervised information provided at fine-tuning time).\nSimilarly to the Loan default prediction task,\nduring both fine-tuning and testing, we use time series with variable length\ntùë°t and, if ta‚Äãl‚Äãl>tm‚Äãa‚Äãxsubscriptùë°ùëéùëôùëôsubscriptùë°ùëöùëéùë•t_{all}>t_{max}, then we select the last tm‚Äãa‚Äãxsubscriptùë°ùëöùëéùë•t_{max} transactions (which are the closest to a possible account closure).\nFinally, we use a separate set of 20K bank accounts for testing.\nSince this dataset is much larger than the others,\nfor computational reasons we have not included LUNA in this comparison. However, similarly to the other tasks, we also used XGBoost and CatBoost with the usual dataset and task specific features and hyperparameter selection. Table¬†7 shows that TabBERT + VRT significantly improves the baseline TabBERT, showing that the Row-type dependent embedding has an accuracy benefit on the downstream task which goes beyond its computational advantages. Moreover, also in this task our full method (UniTTab) outperforms TabBERT, XGBoost and CatBoost with a large margin.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: sequence of the Sequence Transformer and we use the corresponding ùíõ[MASK]subscriptùíõ[MASK]\\boldsymbol{z}_{\\texttt{[MASK]}} as input to a shallow MLP dedicated to the specific task.\nIn case of LUNA [ref]22, we report the results we obtained using its public code and only the LSTM training (adopted also in [ref]22), because fine-tuning this method requires non-trivial modifications of its\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
