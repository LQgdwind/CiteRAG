Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Formal Language Approach to Explaining RNNsThe source code is available at https://github.com/bishwamittra/LEXR\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn general, methods to increase the interpretability of machine learning can broadly be categorized along two orthogonal dimensions: intrinsic   [ref]22 or post-hoc    as well as local [ref]6  or global .\nThe approach proposed here generates model-agnostic (post-hoc) and local explanations.\nHowever, it is slightly different from most other methods for local explanations in that it does not seek explain the decision making relative to (the surrounding of) a particular input but rather inside a user-defined region of interest.\nThis is a deliberate design choice as the surrounding of a sequence is usually specific to the application domain and should not be defined generically. Various methods have been proposed to explain the decision making of RNNs and RNN acceptors     .\nMost relevant to our work are the approaches by Weiss, Goldberg, and Yahab  as well as Mayr and Yovine , which both use Angluin’s L∗∗\\ast algorithm to learn a global explanation in the form of a DFA.\nThough these two methods are similar, they differ in the way conformance of the DFA and the RNN acceptor is established: Weiss, Goldberg, and Yahab  use a partition refinement approach, while Mayr and Yovine  use one inspired by Valiant’s probably approximately correct (PAC) learning [ref]37.\nWe here follow Mayr and Yovine’s approach and generate an LTL formula that might make a small number of mistakes but is structurally simpler than an exact explanation. LEXR uses a learning algorithm for LTL formulas proposed by Neider and Gavran .\nDue to the modular nature of our framework, however, it is easy to substitute this learning algorithm with similar LTL learning algorithms, such as the one by Camacho and McIlraith , or even with learning algorithms for more expressive languages, such as the Property Specification Language .\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: In general, methods to increase the interpretability of machine learning can broadly be categorized along two orthogonal dimensions: intrinsic   [ref]22 or post-hoc    as well as local [ref]6  or global .\nThe approach proposed here generates model-agnostic (post-hoc) and local explanations.\nHowever, it is slightly different from most other\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
