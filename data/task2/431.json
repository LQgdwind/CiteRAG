Among the multiple workers, the parameters are synchronized using parameter servers¬†[ref]28\nor AllReduce communications¬†[ref]45 [ref]29.\nFor Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP)¬† ,\neach worker must wait for all other workers to finish the current minibatch pùëùp before it starts to\nprocess the next minibatch p+1ùëù1p+1 so that it can use an updated version\nof the weights for minibatch p+1ùëù1p+1.\nFor Asynchronous Parallel (ASP)¬† ,\neach worker need not wait for other workers to finish minibatch pùëùp, possibly using a stale\nversion of the weights.\nWith BSP, which is possible for both the parameter servers and AllReduce communications, the system\nmay suffer from high synchronization overhead, especially in a heterogeneous GPU cluster where each worker\nwith a different GPU provides different training performance¬†. On the other hand, while ASP, which is possible\nfor the parameter servers, has no synchronization overhead, it is known that ASP does not ensure convergence¬† . A method that takes the middle ground between BSP and ASP is Stale Synchronous Parallel (SSP)¬†6.\nWith SSP, each worker is allowed to proceed the training of minibatches using a stale version of the weights that may not reflect the most recent updates computed by other workers.\nThus, workers need not synchronize with other workers whenever it finishes the processing of a minibatch.\nAs such, parameter staleness can occur.\nHowever, this staleness is bounded as defined by the user and referred to as the staleness threshold.\nAs SSP is beneficial when worker performance is varied, it has been explored especially in the context of\nheterogeneous systems¬†. In SSP, each worker periodically pushes the weight updates to the parameter server.\nThis synchronization interval is called a clock.\nThus, each worker increases its local clock by one for every iteration, which is the training period of a minibatch.\nFor a given staleness threshold sùë†s where s‚â•0ùë†0s\\geq 0,\neach worker with clock cùëêc is allowed to use a stale version of the weights, which includes all the updates from iteration 0 to c‚àís‚àí1ùëêùë†1c-s-1 and, possibly, more recent updates past iteration c‚àís‚àí1ùëêùë†1c-s-1.\nThat is, a worker can continue training of the next minibatch\nwith parameters whose updates may be missing from up to the sùë†s most recent minibatches.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: the weight updates.\nTherefore, if a DNN model cannot be loaded into the memory of a single GPU, DP\ncannot be used. Among the multiple workers, the parameters are synchronized using parameter servers¬†[ref]28\nor AllReduce communications¬†[ref]45 [ref]29.\nFor Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP)¬† ,\neach worker must wait for all other workers to finish the current minibatch pùëùp before it starts to\nprocess\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
