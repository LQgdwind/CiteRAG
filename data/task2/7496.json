      "content": "Paper Title: Spot Check Equivalence: an Interpretable Metric for Information Elicitation Mechanisms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNotice that, by assumption, with enough spot-checking, you will get the truthful equilibrium. They use the minimum spot-checking ratio that ensures the truthful strategy profile is an equilibrium as a measure of the mechanisms’ performance. Formally, they use pP​a​r​e​t​osubscript𝑝𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑜p_{Pareto} to denote the minimum spot-checking ratio where the truthful equilibrium Pareto dominates the no-effort equilibrium when applying the hybrid peer-prediction/spot-checking mechanism. They use pd​ssubscript𝑝𝑑𝑠p_{ds} to denote the minimum spot-checking ratio where the truthful strategy profile is a dominant strategy in spot-checking mechanism. Then they propose a theorem for comparing the spot-checking mechanism and the spot-checking peer-prediction mechanism: For any spot-checking peer-prediction mechanism, if the no-effort equilibrium exists and Pareto dominates the truthful equilibrium when the cost of effort is 0 (cE=0superscript𝑐𝐸0c^{E}=0) and no task is checked (p=0𝑝0p=0), then pP​a​r​e​t​o≥pd​ssubscript𝑝𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑜subscript𝑝𝑑𝑠p_{Pareto}\\geq p_{ds} for any cE≥0superscript𝑐𝐸0c^{E}\\geq 0. There are three differences between the models in Gao et al.  and Zhang and Schoenebeck  that account for this stark difference. The most obvious difference is that the payments in Gao et al.  are restricted to be additive across tasks. This is rather similar to assuming a linear payment rule when the score is additive across tasks. However, Zhang and Schoenebeck  use tournaments, which are not linear and typically have much better motivational proficiency. Second, Gao et al. ’s assumption of a fixed payment function f𝑓f is extremely restrictive. As we discussed in Section 1, when the spot-checking ratio decreases, it is possible to maintain the same incentive properties by simply scaling up the payment function. Thus, if we scale up f𝑓f, we can make pd​ssubscript𝑝𝑑𝑠p_{ds} arbitrarily small, and, conversely, by scaling down f𝑓f, we can make pd​ssubscript𝑝𝑑𝑠p_{ds} arbitrarily close to 1.\nOn the other hand, in Zhang and Schoenebeck  the mechanism is defined as a performance measurement and a payment scheme, and the payment scheme is optimized to work with the scoring function, rather than being artificially fixed. Finally, Gao et al. ’ make a key assumption on the no-effort signals being perfectly correlated. For example, in peer grading, the writing and formatting quality is a signal that can be accessed with very little effort while assessing the correctness both requires more effort and will likely lead to less agreement. Notice that the premise of Theorem 6.1 is that when the cost of effort is 0 (cE=0superscript𝑐𝐸0c^{E}=0) and no task is checked (p=0𝑝0p=0), the equilibrium where agents exert no effort Pareto dominates the truthful equilibrium. Let’s zoom in on this. First, consider the case where the cost of the high effort signal cE=0superscript𝑐𝐸0c^{E}=0. Notice that any spot-checking mechanism that checks any positive ratio of tasks will have the high-effort profile as an equilibrium because agents will receive some positive payoff, but have 0 cost. Next, consider a peer-prediction mechanism (e.g. a hybrid peer-prediction/spot-checking mechanism with spot-checking ratio 0). Again, the theorem is vacuously true, unless the profile in which no agent exerts effort Pareto dominates the high-effort equilibrium because, in the former, all agents agree and receive a maximal payoff333They are assuming here that complete agreement brings a maximum payoff., but, in the latter, they do not all agree. Together, this shows that any peer prediction mechanisms will have a Spot Check Equivalence of 00, since in this case, any spot-checking ratio that is greater than 0 will inevitably lead to the truthful equilibrium given that the effort cost is nonexistent. Because having a Spot Check Equivalence of 00 is an assumption of the theorem, it is no wonder that such peer-prediction mechanisms do not help! However, this still potentially makes for a very strong critique of peer-prediction mechanisms because in many real-world settings, there exist cheap signals. For example, as mentioned in the introduction, when humans are labeling LLM responses, it is much easier to judge them on how authoritative-sounding the responses are than on how truthful the responses are. However, such labels may encourage hallucinations. Indeed, Gao et al.  led to several papers trying to create peer-prediction mechanisms that are robust against “cheap” signals (i.e. the no-effort/low-effort signals that can bring higher agreement than the high-effort signals). Kong and Schoenebeck [ref]17 propose a peer prediction mechanism called Hierarchical Mutual Information Paradigm (HMIP), assuming a hierarchical information structure where high-effort (or higher expertise) agents have access to the information of low-effort (or lower expertise) agents. HMIP encourages agents to invest effort and incentivizes truthful reporting by paying the high-effort agents for correctly predicting the “cheap” signals from the low-effort agents.\nAdditionally, a human subject experiment  shows evidence of a hierarchical information structure among the participants.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: create peer-prediction mechanisms that are robust against “cheap” signals (i.e. the no-effort/low-effort signals that can bring higher agreement than the high-effort signals).
