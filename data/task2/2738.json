      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Data Structures for 𝑘-Nearest Neighbor Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor general distance functions of constant description complexity, for\nwhich the lower envelope of any t𝑡t functions has O​(t)𝑂𝑡O(t) faces, edges,\nand vertices, Liu [ref]17 recently presented an algorithm to\ncompute k𝑘k-shallow cuttings of linear size. This improves the shallow\ncuttings used by Kaplan et al.  in the dynamic 1-NN data\nstructure. Liu [ref]17 also shows that in the static setting we can use a circular range query data structure  to improve space usage. Like in the Euclidean case, we can use this auxiliary data structure to improve the space usage of the 𝒟0subscript𝒟0\\mathcal{D}_{0} data structure to linear for large n𝑛n. There is a fully dynamic data structure of size O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) that stores a set of n𝑛n point sites and allows for k𝑘k-nearest neighbors queries using a fixed constant description complexity distance function in O​(log2⁡n/log⁡log⁡n+k)𝑂superscript2𝑛𝑛𝑘O(\\log^{2}n/\\log\\log n+k) time. A site can be inserted in O​(log3+ε⁡n/log⁡log⁡n)𝑂superscript3𝜀𝑛𝑛O(\\log^{3+\\varepsilon}n/\\log\\log n) expected amortized time and deleted in O​(log5+ε⁡n/log⁡log⁡n)𝑂superscript5𝜀𝑛𝑛O(\\log^{5+\\varepsilon}n/\\log\\log n) expected amortized time. The k𝑘k-shallow cutting algorithm by Liu [ref]17 produces shallow cuttings of size S​(n,k)=O​(n/k)𝑆𝑛𝑘𝑂𝑛𝑘S(n,k)=O(n/k) in T​(n,k)=O​(n​log3⁡n​λs+2​(log⁡n))𝑇𝑛𝑘𝑂𝑛superscript3𝑛subscript𝜆𝑠2𝑛T(n,k)=O(n\\log^{3}n\\lambda_{s+2}(\\log n)) expected time. A prism containing a query point can be located using a point location data structure in Q​(n,k)=O​(log⁡n)𝑄𝑛𝑘𝑂𝑛Q(n,k)=O(\\log n) time. We can then apply Theorem 5.1 directly to obtain a k𝑘k-NN data structure. In the recently published journal version of the paper , Liu improves upon these results even further. The improved algorithm produces shallow cuttings of size S​(n,k)=O​(n/k)𝑆𝑛𝑘𝑂𝑛𝑘S(n,k)=O(n/k) in T​(n,k)=O​(n​log⁡n)𝑇𝑛𝑘𝑂𝑛𝑛T(n,k)=O(n\\log n) expected time. To be precise, the construction algorithm of Liu  can build all shallow cuttings in a hierarchy in O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) expected time. This means that the preprocessing and deletion time of the bootstrapping data structure (Lemma 5.5) are improved to O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) and O​(r​log⁡n)𝑂𝑟𝑛O(r\\log n), respectively.\nApplying Theorem 5.1 to these shallow cuttings, and adjusting the update times to account for this improvement in the bootstrapping data structure, proves the result.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: For general distance functions of constant description complexity, for\nwhich the lower envelope of any t𝑡t functions has O​(t)𝑂𝑡O(t) faces, edges,\nand vertices, Liu [ref]17 recently presented an algorithm to\ncompute k𝑘k-shallow cuttings of linear size.
