Our paper focuses on transfer attacks. The transferability of AE in deep learning models was first discovered by Szegedy \\etal[ref]44. Papernot \\etal[ref]37 [ref]36 utilized this property to perform black-box attack to real MLaaS systems, which proves its possibility for real attacks. Carlini \\etal proposed that high-confidence adversarial examples increase the transferability. Efforts have been made to understand transferability of AEs.\nLiu \\etal found that unlike untargeted AEs, targeted AEs almost never transfer and proposed to use an ensemble of surrogates to increase transferability of targeted attacks. Wu \\etal studied influencing factors of transferability and point out that reduced variance of gradients results in better transferability. Su \\etal conducted a comprehensive analysis of transfer attack using 18 different surrogates. They found that relaxing norm constraint of adversarial perturbation generates better transferability. They concluded that FGSM >> PGD >> CW in the sense of transferability as well. Demontis \\etal further highlighted that simpler surrogates and better gradient alignment provide better transferability. This conclusion was based on adding different levels of regularization and found stronger regulation provides better transferability. In addition, they concluded that targets which have large gradients for the input are more vulnerable to transfer attack as well. Our work aims at examining whether their conclusions generalize to transfer attack in the real applications and extending their results to get more insights. In particular, when evaluating the relation between surrogate complexity and transferability, we believe that a better way to examine the impact of complexity in the real settings is to directly use surrogates with different depths but the same architecture family, rather than changing regularization. Our conclusion about the non-monotonicity of the effect of surrogate depth on transferability is a complement to Demontis \\etal.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: Early works on adversarial attacks [ref]44      mainly focus on white-box attacks, where the adversary has full access to the target model.\nConsidering the lack of information in black-box attacks, efforts have been made in two\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
