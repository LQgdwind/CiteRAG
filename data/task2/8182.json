      "content": "Paper Title: Whole-Graph Representation Learning For the Classification of Signed Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhole-graph embeddings can be obtained through handcrafted approaches such as feature engineering [ref]46, matrix factorization , or graph kernels [ref]33. However, they often suffer from generalization problems . Representation learning methods are data-driven and allow solving this issue by adapting the graph representation to the targeted dataset. A popular approach involves leveraging models from the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as in Graph2vec  and Graph Classification via Graph Structure Learning (GC-GSL) . Graph2vec, one of the earliest methods for whole-graph representation learning, is an unsupervised and task-agnostic approach that leverages the Doc2vec model  from NLP and applies it to graphs. Instead of treating a text as a collection of paragraphs, Graph2vec considers a graph as a collection of subgraphs, which are then used to train a SkipGram model (cf. Section 4.3 for more details). Another family of approaches relies on graph autoencoders to learn the representation in an unsupervised way, e.g., Permutation-Invariant Graph-level Autoencoder (PIGAE) [ref]53, or the Denoising Autoencoder-based (DAE) method from . Such neural networks are composed of two parts. First, the encoder receives a raw representation of the graph, which is compressed to remove redundant information and superfluous variability and get a fixed-sized and compact representation. Second, the decoder is in charge of reconstructing the original input based on the compressed representation. The autoencoder is trained by minimizing the reconstruction error. The literature contains another family of approaches, that adapt Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) from the field of image processing to handle graphs, resulting in supervised methods able to learn whole-graph representations for specific classification tasks, e.g., Patchy-San Convolutional Network (PSCN)  and NgramCNN . PSCN adapts the notion of convolution to the context of graphs, which allows applying the same principle as for image processing. The graph is represented by a collection of subgraphs, on which PSCN performs convolutions. These are then aggregated to create higher-level representations of the graph. Finally, another strategy is to modify vertex-oriented Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to produce whole-graph representations, e.g., Message Passing\nNeural Network (MPNN)  or Virtual Column Network (VCN) . This is conducted by the addition of a so-called master node, which is connected to all the other vertices. At the end of the training, the vector associated with this master node can be used as a representation of the graph.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: Whole-graph embeddings can be obtained through handcrafted approaches such as feature engineering [ref]46, matrix factorization , or graph kernels [ref]33.
