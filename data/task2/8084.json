      "content": "Paper Title: Digital Fingerprinting on Multimedia: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe generation of multimedia content has experienced explosive growth in the past decade [ref]1 . The ubiquity of portable devices such as smartphones and cameras has enabled everyone to easily create and share high-quality photos, videos, and audio files [ref]3 [ref]4. Meanwhile, social media platforms like Meta, Instagram, and TikTok, with their user-friendly interfaces and powerful dissemination mechanisms, have further driven the generation and consumption of multimedia content. Simultaneously, artificial intelligence (AI) technology  has significantly enhanced the efficiency of content creation. Statistics show that YouTube has approximately 5 billion video views per day and 3.7 million new videos uploaded. The thriving of media platforms like YouTube and Spotify has made content easily accessible, but has also brought about many serious issues, such as content plagiarism . It has also made it very challenging to retrieve specific content from the massive multimedia resources on the web . Most traditional and common retrieval methods rely on some form of metadata (e.g., titles, keywords, or descriptions) added to the content to enable retrieval based on annotated words . However, the traditional manual keyword labeling not only is time-consuming but also struggles to capture the diversity and ambiguity of the content . The explosion of multimedia content has also led to the duplication of files, consuming precious storage space and network bandwidth  . Facing new challenges such as content copying, content search, copyright verification, and content ranking, traditional data management methods, algorithms, frameworks, and tools are no longer sufficient to handle such massive data volumes and provide effective solutions for data growth management . As digital content, such as artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) , has become increasingly pervasive in human life, the effective identification, authentication, and regulation of these digital contents have become an urgent problem to be solved. Traditional copyright protection  and content regulation measures are already struggling to meet the increasingly complex demands. Digital fingerprint  has emerged as an important technology to solve this problem, with its computational and spatial efficiency. It provides a better solution for organizing, managing, differentiating, identifying, and retrieving large-scale multimedia . Digital fingerprints serve as a novel approach to resource management and protection. They provide a distinct characterization of content identity through its signal representation, known as \"content-based identification\" , similar to how human fingerprints uniquely distinguish individual identities. Compared to traditional digital watermarking techniques, digital fingerprints do not alter the content of multimedia files. Instead, they represent the content of multimedia files by extracting stable features and generating a compact summary, which can then be used for efficient content management, copyright protection, and retrieval applications by comparing the generated compact summaries. As the scale of multimedia data continues to expand, fingerprint-based recognition applications, such as image search, song identification, and content duplication detection, have been widely adopted . The main advantage of fingerprints is that they are highly compressed representations of the original data, containing only relevant features , effectively reducing the search space. Compared to unstructured and cumbersome browsing, fingerprints can greatly reduce image retrieval time . Fingerprint-based deduplication can simplify data organization and optimize the management, retrieval, and access of content assets. By creating unique fingerprints for different content segments, fingerprint identification technology can achieve more accurate deduplication and partial matching recognition 0. This technology has been widely applied to content plagiarism monitoring across multimedia types such as text, images, videos, and audios 1 2. Its copyright infringement detection functionality is crucial for protecting the intellectual property of artists’ works 3. A general framework of the digital fingerprinting system is shown in Figure 1. Digital fingerprint algorithms are an important research direction in the field of digital signal processing and pattern recognition 4. By analyzing and extracting feature information from digital content, they generate unique digital fingerprint codes for applications such as content identification, authentication, and tracing. As digital content has become widely used and permeated in human life, digital fingerprint technology has played an increasingly important role in areas such as copyright protection, media regulation, and information security. Research on digital fingerprint algorithms began in the early 1990s, and after more than 30 years of development, a relatively mature technical system has been formed. Currently, digital fingerprints have been widely applied in various digital content types, including audio, video, images, and text, and the fingerprint extraction algorithms for different types of digital content also have their own characteristics. Meanwhile, with the rapid development of AI technology 5, deep learning-based digital fingerprint extraction and recognition methods have also emerged, further enhancing the performance and applicability of digital fingerprint technology. The so-called multimedia-based digital fingerprint 6 refers to the use of digital content containing multiple media modalities (such as audio, video, images, text, etc.) to generate digital fingerprints. Compared to single-media types, multimedia digital fingerprints can leverage the complementarity of different modality information to improve the robustness and discriminability of fingerprints, and support more complex application scenarios. The diversity and complexity of multimedia content also pose new challenges to the extraction and matching of digital fingerprints, as detailed below. First, existing fingerprint extraction and matching algorithms have high computational costs and long processing times when dealing with large-scale multimedia content 7. These algorithms need optimization in processing speed and computational complexity to meet the higher requirements for real-time and computational resources in scenarios such as streaming media and real-time monitoring. In addition, the accuracy and robustness of feature extraction is also a major issue, as noise, compression, and other processing operations may affect the effectiveness of feature extraction, and there is a particular need to enhance robustness against composite attacks and adversarial attacks. As the volume of multimedia content grows exponentially, developing compact and efficient fingerprint representation methods and deduplication technologies to reduce storage requirements and bandwidth consumption have become increasingly important. Finally, privacy protection 8 9 is also a major challenge. The content information contained in perceptual hashes may lead to privacy leakage , and there is an urgent need to design privacy protection mechanisms that balance computational complexity and efficiency. In the digital watermarking field, the term \"fingerprint\" has also been used to describe a technology that deters unauthorized redistribution of multimedia content by embedding a distinct identifying signal in each authorized copy . The fingerprint identification method is fundamentally different from the watermark concept . The digital fingerprint technology discussed in this paper is a content-based compressed signature for summarizing multimedia content . Over the past decades, there have been many surveys and reviews in the field of digital fingerprints, but there is currently no comprehensive review from a multimedia perspective. A comparison with related reviews is presented in Table 1. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of digital fingerprint algorithms based on different multimedia types. The outline is shown in Figure 2. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: Comprehensive survey of digital fingerprints based on different multimedia types. This survey systematically reviews the research status and development trends of multimedia-based digital fingerprints. It first introduces the concept, characteristics, and applications of digital fingerprints in various fields (Section 2). It then focuses on analyzing the unimodal fingerprint extraction algorithms for different types of digital content, including text fingerprints, image fingerprints, video fingerprints, and audio fingerprints (Sections 3-6).

The paper summarizes a wide range of real-world application cases of digital fingerprints, covering areas from content recognition to copyright protection and copy detection, and introduces the practical applications of digital fingerprints in different scenarios, especially large model-based applications. Challenges and future development directions (Section 9).
