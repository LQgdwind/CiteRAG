There are several papers attempting to find tensors that give good upper bounds on ω𝜔\\omega\nin the laser method: Papers on barriers may be interpreted as describing where not to look for good tensors:\n [ref]2  [ref]1\ndiscuss limits of the laser method for various types of tensors and various types of implementations. A program to utilize algebraic geometry and representation theory to find good tensors for the laser method was initiated in\n . Here we describe a more modest goal:\ndetermine criteria that indicate (or even guarantee) that border rank is\nstrictly sub-multiplicative under the Kronecker square. To our knowledge, the first example of a non-minimal border rank tensor that\nsatisfied 𝐑¯​(T⊠2)=𝐑¯​(T)2¯𝐑superscript𝑇⊠absent2¯𝐑superscript𝑇2\\underline{\\mathbf{R}}(T^{\\boxtimes 2})=\\underline{\\mathbf{R}}(T)^{2} was given in : the small Coppersmith-Winograd\ntensor Tc​w,qsubscript𝑇𝑐𝑤𝑞T_{cw,q} for q>2𝑞2q>2 and in this paper we show equality also holds when q=2𝑞2q=2.\nThis shows that tight tensors need not exhibit strict submultiplicativity.\nSeveral examples of strict submultiplicativity were known previous to this paper: the 2×2222\\times 2 matrix\nmultiplication tensor M⟨2⟩∈ℂ4​⊗​ℂ4​⊗​ℂ4subscript𝑀delimited-⟨⟩2superscriptℂ4tensor-productsuperscriptℂ4tensor-productsuperscriptℂ4M_{\\langle 2\\rangle}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{4}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{4}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{4}, 𝐑¯​(M⟨2⟩)=7¯𝐑subscript𝑀delimited-⟨⟩27\\underline{\\mathbf{R}}(M_{\\langle 2\\rangle})=7 \nwhile 𝐑¯​(M⟨2⟩⊠2)≤46¯𝐑superscriptsubscript𝑀delimited-⟨⟩2⊠absent246\\underline{\\mathbf{R}}(M_{\\langle 2\\rangle}^{\\boxtimes 2})\\leq 46 7.\nThe tensors of [ref]12 have a drop of one, a generic tensor T∈ℂ3​⊗​ℂ3​⊗​ℂ3𝑇superscriptℂ3tensor-productsuperscriptℂ3tensor-productsuperscriptℂ3T\\in\\mathbb{C}^{3}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{3}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{3}\nsatisfies 𝐑¯​(T)=5¯𝐑𝑇5\\underline{\\mathbf{R}}(T)=5 while 𝐑¯​(T⊠2)≤22¯𝐑superscript𝑇⊠absent222\\underline{\\mathbf{R}}(T^{\\boxtimes 2})\\leq 22 , and 𝐑¯​(Ts​k​e​w​c​w,2)=5¯𝐑subscript𝑇𝑠𝑘𝑒𝑤𝑐𝑤25\\underline{\\mathbf{R}}(T_{skewcw,2})=5 while\n𝐑¯​(Ts​k​e​w​c​w,2⊠2)=17¯𝐑superscriptsubscript𝑇𝑠𝑘𝑒𝑤𝑐𝑤2⊠absent217\\underline{\\mathbf{R}}(T_{skewcw,2}^{\\boxtimes 2})=17  . All the strict submultiplicativity examples have positive dimensional V​S​P¯¯𝑉𝑆𝑃\\underline{VSP}. This\nis attributable to\nthe degeneracy of σ4​(S​e​g​(ℙ2×ℙ2×ℙ2))subscript𝜎4𝑆𝑒𝑔superscriptℙ2superscriptℙ2superscriptℙ2\\sigma_{4}(Seg(\\mathbb{P}^{2}\\times\\mathbb{P}^{2}\\times\\mathbb{P}^{2})) for the generic tensors in ℂ3​⊗​ℂ3​⊗​ℂ3superscriptℂ3tensor-productsuperscriptℂ3tensor-productsuperscriptℂ3\\mathbb{C}^{3}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{3}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{3},\nand to the large symmetry groups for the other cases: If a tensor\nT∈A​⊗​B​⊗​C𝑇𝐴tensor-product𝐵tensor-product𝐶T\\in A{\\mathord{\\otimes}}B{\\mathord{\\otimes}}C has a positive dimensional symmetry group GTsubscript𝐺𝑇G_{T}\nand GTsubscript𝐺𝑇G_{T} does not have a one-dimensional submodule in each of A​⊗​B𝐴tensor-product𝐵A{\\mathord{\\otimes}}B, A​⊗​C𝐴tensor-product𝐶A{\\mathord{\\otimes}}C, B​⊗​C𝐵tensor-product𝐶B{\\mathord{\\otimes}}C, A​⊗​B​⊗​C𝐴tensor-product𝐵tensor-product𝐶A{\\mathord{\\otimes}}B{\\mathord{\\otimes}}C,\nthen dim⁡(V​S​P¯​(T))>0dim¯𝑉𝑆𝑃𝑇0\\operatorname{dim}(\\underline{VSP}(T))>0 because any ideal in the GTsubscript𝐺𝑇G_{T}-orbit closure of an ideal of a border rank decomposition\nfor T𝑇T will give another border rank decomposition. It would be too much to hope that\na concise tensor T𝑇T not of minimal border rank satisfying dim⁡V​S​P¯​(T)>0dim¯𝑉𝑆𝑃𝑇0\\operatorname{dim}\\underline{VSP}(T)>0\nalso satisfies 𝐑¯​(T⊠2)<𝐑¯​(T)2¯𝐑superscript𝑇⊠absent2¯𝐑superscript𝑇2\\underline{\\mathbf{R}}(T^{\\boxtimes 2})<\\underline{\\mathbf{R}}(T)^{2}. Consider the following example:\nLet T=T1⊕T2𝑇direct-sumsubscript𝑇1subscript𝑇2T=T_{1}\\oplus T_{2} with the Tjsubscript𝑇𝑗T_{j} in disjoint spaces, where\nT1subscript𝑇1T_{1} has non-minimal border rank and dim⁡V​S​P¯​(T1)=0dim¯𝑉𝑆𝑃subscript𝑇10\\operatorname{dim}\\underline{VSP}(T_{1})=0 and T2subscript𝑇2T_{2} has minimal border rank with\ndim⁡V​S​P¯​(T2)>0dim¯𝑉𝑆𝑃subscript𝑇20\\operatorname{dim}\\underline{VSP}(T_{2})>0. Then there is no reason to believe T⊠2superscript𝑇⊠absent2T^{\\boxtimes 2}\nshould have strict submultiplicativity. It is possible that the converse holds: that\nstrict submultiplicativity under the Kronecker square implies a positive dimensional\nV​S​P¯¯𝑉𝑆𝑃\\underline{VSP}. It might be useful, following [ref]12 to split the submultiplicativity question into\ntwo questions: first to determine if the usual tensor square is submultiplicative and\nthen if the border rank of the Kronecker square is less than the border rank of the\ntensor square.\nNote that in general, assuming non-defectivity, for a projective\nvariety X⊂ℙ​V𝑋ℙ𝑉X\\subset\\mathbb{P}V of dimension N𝑁N, σR−1​(X)subscript𝜎𝑅1𝑋\\sigma_{R-1}(X)\nhas codimension N+1𝑁1N+1 in σR​(X)subscript𝜎𝑅𝑋\\sigma_{R}(X). In our case R=r2𝑅superscript𝑟2R=r^{2} and in the tensor\nsquare case N=6​m−6𝑁6𝑚6N=6m-6, and in the Kronecker square case N=3​m2−3𝑁3superscript𝑚23N=3m^{2}-3.\nA priori, for T∈ℂm​⊗​ℂm​⊗​ℂm𝑇superscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚T\\in\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m} of border rank r𝑟r,\nT⊗2∈σr2​(S​e​g​(ℙ(m−1)×6))superscript𝑇tensor-productabsent2subscript𝜎superscript𝑟2𝑆𝑒𝑔superscriptℙ𝑚16T^{\\otimes 2}\\in\\sigma_{r^{2}}(Seg(\\mathbb{P}^{(m-1)\\times 6})) and\nsubmultiplicativity is a codimension\n6​m−56𝑚56m-5 condition, whereas\nT⊠2∈σr2​(S​e​g​(ℙ(m2−1)×3))superscript𝑇⊠absent2subscript𝜎superscript𝑟2𝑆𝑒𝑔superscriptℙsuperscript𝑚213T^{\\boxtimes 2}\\in\\sigma_{r^{2}}(Seg(\\mathbb{P}^{(m^{2}-1)\\times 3})) and\nsubmultiplicativity is a codimension\n3​m2−23superscript𝑚223m^{2}-2 condition. Despite this, the second condition is weaker than the first.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: are several papers attempting to find tensors that give good upper bounds on ω𝜔\\omega\nin the laser method: Papers on barriers may be interpreted as describing where not to look for good tensors:\n [ref]2  [ref]1\ndiscuss limits of the laser method for various types of tensors and various types of implementations.
