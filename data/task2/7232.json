More focus has been given to synthetic EHR generation due to the scarcity of medical data [ref]24   .\nIn their work, Lee et al. (2018) generate synthetic CC's from discrete variables in EHRs, like age group, gender, and discharge diagnosis . Recent advancements in EHR generation have leveraged a range of methodologies, from Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to transformer-based language modeling.\nIn a study by Liu et al. (2018), a novel transformer-based language modeling job was introduced. This work involved predicting the content of medical notes, taking into consideration previous data from a patient's medical record .\nKrishna et al. (2020) primarily used LSTM and BERT to generate semi-structured clinical summaries (SOAP) notes from doctor-patient conversations .\nIve et al. (2020) used a neural Transformer model to generate artificial clinical documents for mental health records .\nSirrianni et al. (2022) employed GPT-2 and GPT-Neo for next-word prediction on dental medical notes that include exam notes, emergency notes, trauma notes, etc .\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: imperative for utmost accuracy, and the rigorous demands for privacy.\nRecent improvement in NLG is revolutionizing EHR generation in different fields such as report generation from medical images [ref]21, medical note generation from table data , medical topic to text generation [ref]23, and so on.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
