      "content": "Paper Title: Multimodal Data Augmentation for Visual-Infrared Person ReID with Corrupted Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReal-world monitoring and surveillance application (e.g., individuals in airport, and vehicles in traffic) rely on challenging tasks, like object detection  , tracking , and re-identification (ReID)  [ref]50. The aim of person ReID is to recognize individuals over a set of distributed non-overlapping cameras. State-of-art systems for person re-identification (e.g., deep Siamese networks) typically learn an embedding through various metric learning losses, which aim at making similar image pairs (with the same identity) closer to each other and dissimilar image pairs (with different identities) more distant from each other. Despite the recent advances with deep learning (DL) models, person ReID remains a challenging task due to the non-rigid structure of the human body, the different viewpoints/poses with which a person can be observed, image corruption, and the variability of capture conditions (e.g., illumination, scale, contrast)  1. Visible-infrared (V-I) person ReID aims to recognize individuals of interest across a network of RGB and IR cameras. IR cameras are often employed in conjunction with RGB cameras for, e.g., night time recognition in outdoor environments. Most approaches for V-I person ReID focus on the cross-modal matching problem. This paper focuses on person ReID systems that allow for fusion of visible and infrared modalities based on a joint representation space. Although several techniques have been proposed for dynamic and attention-based fusion  , few V-I person ReID methods have been proposed for RGB-IR fusion 5. In this setting, it is difficult to extract discriminant modality-specific features when one modality becomes corrupted, while conserving the shared modality features . In real-world surveillance applications, the accuracy of person ReID models often declines when image data is corrupted by noise, occlusions, saturation, blur, weather conditions, etc. [ref]5. Several strategies have been developed to improve the generalization performance of person ReID models in response to corrupted image data. Using more complex DL models, trained with more data have been shown to improve the performances in object detection 2, and image classification  tasks. For instance, using transformer-based models may be more suitable to tackle corruption  [ref]5. However, using more complex models, like vision-transformers  limits real-time ReID applications. In addition, using more diverse training data can help , and therefore data augmentation (DA) [ref]5 methods may improve performance, without increasing the models complexity, and while avoiding the costs of data collection and annotation . In this paper, we propose a MDA strategy to improve the accuracy of V-I person ReID systems.\nChen et al. [ref]5 recently proposed a DA learning strategy, called the Consistent ID Loss, with Inference before BNNeck, and Local-based Augmentation (CIL). It is mainly based on local DA, and provides improvements in accuracy for unimodal (RGB) person ReID. However, the multimodal aspect has not been explored in the literature to tackle corruptions. Yet, such approach might be helpful to tackle corruption as modalities are not similarly affected by corruptions and can still benefit by DA strategies . To manage corrupted image data in multimodal settings, a multimodal DA (MDA) strategy is introduced, allowing to leverage the complementary knowledge among modalities, while dynamically balancing the importance of individual modality in the final predictions. Consequently, the strategy should reduce the corruption impact. Having in mind the multimodal person ReID aspect, and regarding that person ReID datasets were only used for cross-modal ReID, protocols are provided along with a comprehensive study over three V-I person ReID datasets, SYSU-MM01 , RegDB 5 and (less explored) ThermalWORLD 5. Finally, as the focus is made on corruption robustness for the multimodal setting, the corruption benchmark proposed by [ref]5 is extended to the infrared thermal modality. Our main contributions are summarized as follows.\n(1) A MDA strategy is proposed to improve the accuracy of DL models for V-I person ReID. To optimize the collaboration among modalities, discriminant joint feature representations in the DL model, our MDA strategy relies on local occlusions and global modality masking data augmentation.\n(2) A comprehensive V-I multimodal experimental protocol is proposed to evaluate the impact on performance of clean and corrupted image data using the well-known SYSU-MM01, RegDB, and ThermalWORLD datasets. Corruptions from [ref]5 are extended to the infrared domain to analyse multimodal data corruption impact.\n(3) An extensive set of experiments is conducted, showing that the used V-I fusion model outperforms the related state-of-art models. The limitations of unimodal models are shown by comparing a basic fusion model learned with the adapted DA to the unimodal state-of-art person ReID models.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: Real-world monitoring and surveillance application (e.g., individuals in airport, and vehicles in traffic) rely on challenging tasks, like object detection  , tracking , and re-identification (ReID)  [ref]50.
