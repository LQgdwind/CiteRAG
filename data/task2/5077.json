      "content": "Paper Title: Cross-Modal Adapter for Text-Video Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPre-trained models become prevalent in recent years  [ref]40. Since fine-tuning the whole model has a large computational cost and is time-consuming , parameter efficient tuning (PET) has been proposed to efficiently adapt the pre-trained models to downstream tasks [ref]39 . Among them, adapters [ref]37   and prompt learning    are two dominant lines of research. Adapters \nare light-weighted layers inserted in the pre-trained model. During fine-tuning, only the weights of adapters are updated, and other parameters are frozen. Task-specific information is learned and knowledge learned in the pre-training phase is also preserved. In the NLP community, Mahabadi et al. [ref]37 proposes to use hyper-networks to generate parameters for adapters in each layer. Furthermore, Mahabadi et al.  proposes Compactor, a parameterized hyper-complex multiplication layer, to reduce the parameter of adapter modules. Recently, in the CV community, Chen et al.  proposes a Conv-Adapter which consists of a point-wise convolution and depth-wise convolution in a bottleneck structure to enable adapters in convolutional neural networks. Previous works explore either vision or language modality, while our method investigates the effectiveness of adapters in the multi-modality domain. Prompt learning  [ref]39, first proposed in NLP, can probe pre-trained knowledge for downstream tasks with human-designed or learnable prompt input. Concretely, a natural language task instruction (prompt) is prepended in the input, and the whole pre-trained model is frozen. The prompt could be discrete or continuous embedding [ref]39  .\nSince multi-modal pre-trained models, e.g., CLIP [ref]40, have shown impressive performance on various tasks, context optimization  (CoOp), has been proposed to prompt CLIP on image classification tasks. CoOp optimizes continuous learnable prompts for the text encoder to learn better label distribution for image classification tasks. Visual prompt tuning  (VPT) leverages prompt in each layer of vision models. Recently, a multi-modal prompt tuning method, MaPLe , has been proposed to fully exploit the knowledge of CLIP. Contrary to these works, our method is based on the adapter, and experiments demonstrate that ours outperforms prompt-based methods on various datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: Pre-trained models become prevalent in recent years  [ref]40.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
