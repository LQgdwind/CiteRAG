Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Coarse to Fine Framework for Object Detection in High Resolution Image\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSmall object detection on MS COCO[ref]18 dataset has become a critical topic and attracted great attention from researchers. FPN[ref]19 is a major method to handle scale variance through feature pyramid, and it is extended to some variants, such as EFF-FPN[ref]37 and AugFPN. SNIP and SNIPER use image pyramid to train and test detectors on the same scales and selectively back-propagates the gradients of objects with different sizes via a function of the image scales. Autofocus adopts a coarse to fine approach and learns where to look in the next scale in the image pyramid. Dynamic zoom-in network employs reinforcement learning to model long-term reward in terms of detection accuracy and computational cost, then dynamically select a sequence of regions for further detection at higher resolution. Perceptual GAN utilizes an adversarial network to boost the detection performance by narrowing the representation difference between small and large objects, and a super-resolution feature generator is trained with proper high-resolution object features for supervision. A similar idea appears in but considers the impacts of the receptive fields of various sizes as well. TinyPerson claims that scale mismatch between the data for network pre-training and detector learning incurs degradation and designs Scale Match to align object scales between different datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: Small object detection on MS COCO[ref]18 dataset has become a critical topic and attracted great attention from researchers.
