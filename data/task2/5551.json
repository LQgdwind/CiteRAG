In fact, this c𝑐c is not explicit and depends on the implementation details of an algorithm developed in that paper.\nOur main result asserts that c𝑐c can be taken to be three and that this constant is best possible. For two graphs G𝐺G and H𝐻H and every t≥1𝑡1t\\geq 1, the following implications hold: Furthermore, for every t≥1𝑡1t\\geq 1, there exist graphs G𝐺G and H𝐻H such that G≃3​t−1SAHsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to-or-equals3𝑡1SA𝐺𝐻G\\simeq_{3t-1}^{\\textup{SA}}H and G≄tLHsuperscriptsubscriptnot-similar-to-or-equals𝑡L𝐺𝐻G\\not\\simeq_{t}^{\\textup{L}}H. Here, G≃tLHsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to-or-equals𝑡L𝐺𝐻G\\simeq_{t}^{\\textup{L}}H and G≃tSAHsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to-or-equals𝑡SA𝐺𝐻G\\simeq_{t}^{\\textup{SA}}H denote that the level-t𝑡t Lasserre relaxation and respectively the level-t𝑡t Sherali–Adams relaxation of ISO⁡(G,H)ISO𝐺𝐻\\operatorname{ISO}(G,H) are feasible. Theorem 1.1 is proven using the framework of homomorphism indistinguishability.\nIn previous works  [ref]25  ,\nthe feasibility of various systems of equations associated to graphs like the Sherali–Adams relaxation of ISO⁡(G,H)ISO𝐺𝐻\\operatorname{ISO}(G,H) was characterised in terms of homomorphism indistinguishability over certain graph classes.\nWe continue this line of research by characterising the feasibility of the level-t𝑡t Lasserre relaxation of ISO⁡(G,H)ISO𝐺𝐻\\operatorname{ISO}(G,H) by homomorphism indistinguishability of G𝐺G and H𝐻H over the novel class of graphs ℒtsubscriptℒ𝑡\\mathcal{L}_{t}\nintroduced in Definition 4.1. For every integer t≥1𝑡1t\\geq 1, there is a minor-closed graph class ℒtsubscriptℒ𝑡\\mathcal{L}_{t} of graphs of treewidth at most 3​t−13𝑡13t-1 such that for all graphs G𝐺G and H𝐻H it holds that G≃tLHsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to-or-equals𝑡L𝐺𝐻G\\simeq_{t}^{\\textup{L}}H if and only if G≡ℒtHsubscriptsubscriptℒ𝑡𝐺𝐻G\\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}_{t}}H. The bound on the treewidth of graphs in ℒtsubscriptℒ𝑡\\mathcal{L}_{t} in Theorem 1.2 yields the upper bound in Theorem 1.1 given the result of   [ref]4 [ref]13 that two graphs G𝐺G and H𝐻H satisfy G≃tSAHsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to-or-equals𝑡SA𝐺𝐻G\\simeq_{t}^{\\text{SA}}H if and only if they are homomorphism indistinguishable over the class 𝒯​𝒲t−1𝒯subscript𝒲𝑡1\\mathcal{TW}_{t-1} of graphs of treewidth at most t−1𝑡1t-1.\nTo our knowledge, Theorem 1.1 is the first result which tightly relates equivalence relations on graphs by comparing the graph classes which characterise them in terms of homomorphism indistinguishability. Our techniques extend to a stronger version of the Lasserre hierarchy which imposes non-negativity constraints on all variables.\nDenoting feasibility of the level-t𝑡t Lasserre relaxation of ISO⁡(G,H)ISO𝐺𝐻\\operatorname{ISO}(G,H) with non-negativity constraints by G≃tL+Hsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to-or-equals𝑡superscriptL𝐺𝐻G\\simeq_{t}^{\\textup{L}^{+}}H,\nwe characterise ≃tL+superscriptsubscriptsimilar-to-or-equals𝑡superscriptL\\simeq_{t}^{\\textup{L}^{+}} in terms of homomorphism indistinguishability over the graph class ℒt+superscriptsubscriptℒ𝑡\\mathcal{L}_{t}^{+}, defined in Definition 4.1 as a super class of ℒtsubscriptℒ𝑡\\mathcal{L}_{t}.\nThis is in line with previous work in  , where the feasibility of the level-t𝑡t Sherali–Adams relaxation of ISO⁡(G,H)ISO𝐺𝐻\\operatorname{ISO}(G,H) without non-negativity constraints was characterised as homomorphism indistinguishable over the class 𝒫​𝒲t−1𝒫subscript𝒲𝑡1\\mathcal{PW}_{t-1} of graphs of pathwidth at most t−1𝑡1t-1. For every integer t≥1𝑡1t\\geq 1, there is a minor-closed graph class ℒt+superscriptsubscriptℒ𝑡\\mathcal{L}_{t}^{+} of graphs of treewidth at most 3​t−13𝑡13t-1 such that for all graphs G𝐺G and H𝐻H it holds that G≃tL+Hsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to-or-equals𝑡superscriptL𝐺𝐻G\\simeq_{t}^{\\textup{L}^{+}}H if and only if G≡ℒt+Hsubscriptsuperscriptsubscriptℒ𝑡𝐺𝐻G\\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}_{t}^{+}}H. Given the aforementioned correspondence between the Sherali–Adams relaxation with and without non-negativity constraints and homomorphism indistinguishability over graphs of bounded treewidth and pathwidth, we conduct a detailed study of the relationship between the class of graphs of bounded treewidth, pathwidth, and the classes ℒtsubscriptℒ𝑡\\mathcal{L}_{t} and ℒt+superscriptsubscriptℒ𝑡\\mathcal{L}_{t}^{+}. Their results, depicted in Figure 1, yield independent proofs of the known relations between feasibility of the Lasserre relaxation with and without non-negativity constraints and the Sherali–Adams relaxation with and without non-negativity constraints  [ref]4  using the framework of homomorphism indistinguishability. In the course of proving Theorems 1.2 and 1.3, we derive further equivalent characterisations of ≃tLsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to-or-equals𝑡L\\simeq_{t}^{\\textup{L}} and ≃tL+superscriptsubscriptsimilar-to-or-equals𝑡superscriptL\\simeq_{t}^{\\textup{L}^{+}}. These characterisations, which are mostly of a linear algebraic nature, ultimately yield a characterisation of ≃tL+superscriptsubscriptsimilar-to-or-equals𝑡superscriptL\\simeq_{t}^{\\textup{L}^{+}} in terms of a fragment of first-order logic with counting quantifiers and indistinguishability under a polynomial time algorithm akin to the Weisfeiler–Leman algorithm.\nIn this way, we obtain the following algorithmic result.\nIt implies that exact feasibility of the Lasserre semidefinite program with non-negativity constraints can be tested in polynomial time.\nIn general, only the approximate feasibility of semidefinite programs can be decided efficiently, e.g. using the ellipsoid method  [ref]4. Let t≥1𝑡1t\\geq 1.\nGiven graphs G𝐺G and H𝐻H, it can be decided in polynomial time whether G≃tL+Hsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to-or-equals𝑡superscriptL𝐺𝐻G\\simeq_{t}^{\\textup{L}^{+}}H. Finally, for t=1𝑡1t=1, we show that ℒ1subscriptℒ1\\mathcal{L}_{1} and ℒ1+superscriptsubscriptℒ1\\mathcal{L}_{1}^{+} are respectively equal to the class 𝒪​𝒫𝒪𝒫\\mathcal{OP} of outerplanar graphs and to the class of graphs of treewidth at most 222. The following Theorem 1.5 parallels a result of  asserting that two graphs G𝐺G and H𝐻H are indistinguishable under the 222-WL algorithm iff G≃1L+Hsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to-or-equals1superscriptL𝐺𝐻G\\simeq_{1}^{\\textup{L}^{+}}H. Two graphs G𝐺G and H𝐻H satisfy G≃1LHsuperscriptsubscriptsimilar-to-or-equals1L𝐺𝐻G\\simeq_{1}^{\\textup{L}}H iff G≡𝒪​𝒫Hsubscript𝒪𝒫𝐺𝐻G\\equiv_{\\mathcal{OP}}H.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Although feasibility of the level-t𝑡t Lasserre relaxation of ISO⁡(G,H)ISO𝐺𝐻\\operatorname{ISO}(G,H) was sandwiched between feasibility of the level-c​t𝑐𝑡ct and level-t𝑡t Sherali–Adams relaxation in [ref]4,\nthe constant c𝑐c remained unknown.
