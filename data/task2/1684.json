      "content": "Paper Title: LocalDrop: A Hybrid Regularization for Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince many regularization strategies empirically performed well in various complex applications, the theoretical part of these strategies has been brought to attention recently. Gal and Ghahramani [ref]21 studied the Bernoulli dropout model from the Bayesian perspective. They justified that dropout can be regarded as a particular situation of Bayesian regularization by combining Bayesian models and deep learning to gauge model uncertainty. Besides, Wan  proposed a generalization bound of dropout via the Rademacher complexity. Gao and Zhou [ref]22 proved that various dropout strategies can decrease the Rademacher complexity to prevent FCNs from overfitting. Mou  combined the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis set and the variance set to determine a generalization upper bound by applying the proposed general framework with random perturbation on parameters. Neyshabur [ref]17 , Barlett , Golowich  and Li  obtained different generalization error bounds of the Rademacher complexity in neural networks. Zhai and Wang  proposed a new regularization algorithm based on the network Rademacher complexity bound by mathematical derivation. More perspectives on generalization of neural networks and regularizations are provided by Neyshabur [ref]17, Arora   and Zheng .\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Since many regularization strategies empirically performed well in various complex applications, the theoretical part of these strategies has been brought to attention recently.
