      "content": "Paper Title: Evaluating the Robustness of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Policies in a Multi-agent Urban Driving Environment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn AD research, there are only a few benchmarks for evaluating the performance of RL-based AD models. Vinitsky [ref]15 proposes a benchmark for DRL in mixed-autonomy traffic. While the benchmark involves four scenarios: the figure eight network, the merge network, the grid, and the bottleneck, it evaluates a limited number of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms (two gradient-based and two gradient-free).\nIn addition, the proposed benchmark is specific to connected AD research. Stang  proposes another benchmark for RL algorithms in a simulated AD environment. As a limitation, this benchmark focuses on a simple lane-tracking task, and furthermore, evaluates only off-policy RL algorithms. In contrast, our work evaluates both on-policy and off-policy algorithms and further allows for comparing the performance of DRL algorithms in a complex urban environment. As another limitation, both [ref]15 and  only support DRL benchmarking for single-agent AD environments. Li [ref]18 introduces a driving simulation framework called MetaDrive and performs a benchmarking of RL algorithms for AD. While the authors use five different driving scenarios, they only evaluate two RL algorithms (PPO and SAC).\nThe work could also benefit from using realistic visual rendering as provided by the CARLA framework in our work. Palanisamy  proposes a multi-agent urban driving framework in which one can train more than one AC. Using IMPALA, a connected AC policy is trained within the CARLA simulator. However, as a limitation, the work is restricted to connected AD problems only. Furthermore, there are frameworks proposed for training and testing autonomous vehicles. For example, F1TENTH framework  with three racing scenarios and baselines for testing and evaluating autonomous vehicles. However, the framework does not support dealing with ARL. Han  proposes an off-road simulated environment for AD with realistic off-road scenes, such as mountains, deserts, snowy fields, and highlands. While realistic environments are useful for evaluating the generalization abilities of AD models, the work is limited to single-agent AD environments.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: In AD research, there are only a few benchmarks for evaluating the performance of RL-based AD models.
