      "content": "Paper Title: Trinary Tools for Continuously Valued Binary Classifiers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInteractive tools for understanding machine learning models are motivated by many reasons, see Gleicher [ref]27 or Lipton  for surveys.\nOur work falls into the broad category of black box methods that focus on examining results of trained models, in contrast to methods for creating transparent models, providing explanations of decision, or inspecting model internals. Prior tools for interactive examination of the outputs of continuously valued classifiers are similar to our work.\nLike our approach, ModelTracker  and Prospector  consider assessment of binary classifier output, providing summary views to identify details and set thresholds. Their designs influenced ours. ModelTracker focuses on specific tasks, e.g., adjusting the threshold and identifying instances.  and  provide related approaches for multi-class probabilities. These tools focus on multi-class issues, such as cross-class confusion, rather than single class thresholding. None of these approaches consider rejection, comparisons among subgroups, or supporting sampling to mitigate generalization mistakes. A number of tools have focused on specific scenarios for black-box classifier result analysis.\nSome tools, such as [ref]33, focus on aggregate summaries over large collections of classifiers.\nOthers, such as [ref]34, focus on identifying relationships between outputs and features.\nOther tools   focus on identifying subgroup fairness issues.\n and  describe systems that enable identifying subgroups for comparisons. Our work extends these ideas to the needs of continuously valued binary classifier assessment. Threshold tuning is often automated, with a historic tradition of optimization . However, specific scenarios require trade-offs to be encoded as costs, and for good models of the likelihood of errors to exist. Tools, such as  , have considered interactive refinement of the objectives used for parameter tuning in classifier construction.\nOur approach provides tools that allows users to explore parameters to find tradeoffs suitable for their scenarios.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: Interactive tools for understanding machine learning models are motivated by many reasons, see Gleicher [ref]27 or Lipton  for surveys.\nOur work falls into the broad category of black box methods that focus on examining results of trained models, in contrast to methods for creating transparent models,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
