      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Two-Stream CNN for Multi-Modal Age-related Macular Degeneration Categorization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEver since the great success of AlexNet , data augmentation using low-level image processing techniques such as crop, flip, rotation and changes in brightness, saturation and contrast has been a rule of thumb for CNN training. Not surprisingly, we observe from Table I that data augmentation used by existing works for AMD categorization all follows this convention. We notice a very recent attempt by Burlina et al.   to train a binary AMD classifier using GAN-generated examples. In particular, the authors train two PGGANs [ref]27, one for generating normal CFP images and the other for synthesizing CFP images with AMD. Their motivation, i.e., to substitute GAN-generated data for manually labeled data, differs from ours. Moreover, according to their study, the classifier trained on synthetic data has lower performance than its counterpart trained on real data (0.8292 vs 0.9112 in Accuracy and 0.9235 vs 0.9706 in AUC). The result suggests that synthetic data alone is insufficient. For synthesizing high-resolution training images, there is an increasing interest in leveraging image-to-image GANs  [ref]29   [ref]32. For detection of exudates in CFP images, Zheng et al.  expand their training data by developing a pix2pix  based network that converts exudate segmentation maps into CFP images. As illustrated in Fig. 3(a), a pix2pix model converts an input image, e.g., an exudate segmentation map in , to a synthetic CFP image by a fully convolutional network known as a generator. The generator is trained to fool another convolutional network known as a discriminator, which is responsible for discriminating between real and fake samples. For tumor segmentation in brain MRI images, Shin et al. [ref]29 train pix2pix to synthesize MRI images from tumor and tissue segmentation maps. For lesion detection in chest X-ray images, Xing et al.  also adopt pix2pix, where the input of pix2pix is obtained by masking out all regions of abnormal images except for lesion areas. In the context of diabetic retinopathy grading, Zhou et al.   synthesize CFP images by a pix2pixHD  based network, which translates vessel and lesion masks into the images. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the major improvement of pix2pixHD over pix2pix is a joint use of two generators and two discriminators to generate higher-resolution images in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our proposed method uses pix2pixHD. However, in contrast to existing works where the input is manually annotated  , or automatically produced yet requiring manual annotation for training underlying semantic segmentation models , or both [ref]29, our input, namely Class Activation Maps (CAMs), is automated extracted by image classifiers, with no need of any lesion annotation.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: all follows this convention.
