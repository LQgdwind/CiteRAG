      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Scene-Text to Scene-Text Translation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine Translation: It is a well-studied area     9 [ref]8 that aims to convert a text from its source language to a target language. Current state-of-the-art models for machine translation are deep-learning based  9 [ref]8. In the speech domain, Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) aims to translate speech from one language to another while preserving the speaker’s voice and accent     . Inspired by these lines of work, we focus on text translation in the visual modality, which brings newer research challenges, such as preserving font properties and integrity of the image background, which needs to be addressed to produce visually appealing translations. Image Generation:\nThe generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown impressive results for generating photo-realistic images    . Although GANs achieve high-quality generations, they do not easily converge during training and are susceptible to mode collapse that leads to less diversity in their generations 8. Addressing these shortcomings, a new family of likelihood-based models namely denoising diffusion   5 has emerged. They define a Markov chain of diffusion steps that gradually destruct data by adding noise and then learn to reverse the diffusion process to reconstruct the original data from noise. Unlike GANs, diffusion models have a stable training process and higher sampling diversity. They have remarkably achieved the state-of-the-art results on a wide array of generation tasks such as text-to-image generation 2 3, audio generation , 3D-shape generation , and video generation . We adopt them for our task, and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a diffusion-based model in the area of scene-text editing. Editing Text in Images:\nThe problem of editing text in images has witnessed significant research interest in recent years   1   0. This task aims to modify scene text to target content while retaining visual properties of the original text. SRNet  is one such method that learns an end-to-end GAN-based style-retention network. SwapText  improved upon the SRNet architecture by modeling the geometrical transformation of the text using spatial points. More recently, TextStyleBrush , RewriteNet , and MOSTEL 0 introduce a self-supervised training approach on real-world images for this task. Further, TextStyleBrush is evaluated on handwritten images as well. Authors in 1 proposed a character-wise text editor model for this task. However, their approach assumes source and target text instances are of the same length, which is not always true, especially in the translation task. A more recent approach MOSTEL 0 also introduces stroke-level modifications to produce more photo-realistic generations. Despite demonstrating a few selected qualitative results for cross-lingual editing, these works have only scratched the surface of this area and it remains largely unexplored and understudied. Our work aims to fill this gap.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Machine Translation: It is a well-studied area     9 [ref]8 that aims to convert a text from its source language to a target language.
