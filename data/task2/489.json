      "content": "Paper Title: GNNAdvisor: An Adaptive and Efficient Runtime System for GNN Acceleration on GPUs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBenchmarks: \nWe choose the two most representative GNN models widely used by previous work [ref]53   on node classification tasks to cover different types of aggregation.\n1) Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)  is one of the most popular GNN model architectures.\nIt is also the key backbone network for many other GNNs, such as GraphSAGE , and differentiable pooling (Diffpool) . Therefore, improving the performance of GCN will also benefit a broad range of GNNs. For GCN evaluation, we use the setting: 2 layers with 16 hidden dimensions, which is also the setting from the original paper .\n2) Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) .\nGIN differs from GCN in its aggregation function, which weighs the node embedding values from the node itself. In addition, GIN is also the reference architecture for many other advanced GNNs with more edge properties, such as Graph Attention Network (GAT) . For GIN evaluation, we use the setting: 5 layers with 64 hidden dimensions, which is the setting used in the original paper . Baselines: \nwe choose several baseline implementations for comparison.\n1) Deep Graph Library (DGL) [ref]53 is the state-of-the-art GNN framework on GPUs, which is built upon the famous tensor-oriented platform – Pytorch [ref]46. DGL significantly outperforms the other existing GNN frameworks  over various datasets on many mainstream GNN architectures. Therefore, we make an in-depth comparison with DGL in our evaluation;\n2) Pytorch-Geometric (PyG)  is another\nGNN framework in which users can define their edge convolutions when building customized GNN aggregation layers;\n3) NeuGraph  is a dataflow-centered GNN system on GPUs built on Tensorflow ;\n4) Gunrock [ref]54 is the GPU-based graph processing framework with state-of-the-art performance on traditional graph algorithms (e.g., PageRank). Datasets: \nWe cover all three types of datasets, which have been used in previous GNN-related work [ref]53  .\nType I graphs are the typical datasets used by previous GNN algorithm papers   .\nThey are usually small in the number of nodes and edges, but rich in node embedding information with high dimensionality.\nType II graphs  are the popular benchmark datasets for graph kernels and are selected as the built-in datasets for PyG . Each dataset consists of a set of small graphs, which only have intra-graph edge connections without inter-graph edge connections.\nType III graphs   are large in terms of the number of nodes and edges. These graphs demonstrate high irregularity in structure, which is challenging for most of the existing GNN frameworks. Details of these datasets are listed in Table 1. Platforms & Metrics: \n\nWe implement GNNAdvisor’s backend with C++ and CUDA C and its front-end with Python. Our major evaluation platform is a server with an 8-core 16-thread Intel Xeon Silver 4110 CPU \nand a Quadro P6000  GPU.\nBesides, we use Tesla V100  GPU on the DGX-1 system  to demonstrate the generality of GNNAdvisor.\nRuntime parameters of different input settings are optimized by GNNAdvisor Decider.\nTo measure the performance speedup, we calculate the averaged latency of 200 end-to-end inference (forward propagation) or training (forward+backward propagation).\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: Benchmarks: \nWe choose the two most representative GNN models widely used by previous work [ref]53   on node classification tasks to cover different types of aggregation.\n1) Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)  is one of the most popular GNN model architectures.\nIt is also the key backbone\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
