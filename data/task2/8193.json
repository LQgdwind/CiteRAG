      "content": "Paper Title: Fine-Grained Expressive Power of Weisfeiler-Leman: A Homomorphism Counting Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in the field of graph representation learning. However, since no deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for graph isomorphism testing has yet been found¬†, none of the popular GNN models are universal approximators of graph functions even with sufficient number of parameters, according to¬†Chen et¬†al. . This drawback of GNNs has been informally stated as the limited expressive power of GNNs. In particular,¬†Xu et¬†al. 5 has proved that the expressive power of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), a widely adopted class of GNNs, is upper-bounded by that of 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm, or 1-WL¬†4. Following¬†Xu et¬†al. 5, numerous works have proposed more powerful GNNs based on higher-order WL algorithms as well as their variants¬†  [ref]16 [ref]19 0 2 6 9 . Some of the works¬†[ref]19 0 2 6 9 even systematically compare the expressive power of those powerful GNNs, and establish expressiveness hierarchies among them. However, these comparisons usually fail to quantify the expressiveness gap between different methods, and provide little insight into what tasks a certain class of GNNs tend to excel at. Recently, there are several works¬† 7 trying to characterize the expressive power of GNNs by considering their ability to perform homomorphism counting, namely, the power to determine the number of homomorphisms from a small query graph to the graph we are interested in. Earlier on, another line of works¬† [ref]16  has proposed to study GNN expressiveness by considering their substructure counting power, or the power to determine subgraph isomorphisms instead of homomorphisms. Both approaches can provide fine-grained knowledge about the expressive power of GNNs. As an example, the expressiveness gap between two families of GNNs can be made manifest by examining the substructures whose homomorphism (or isomorphism) counts that one of them can compute while the other cannot. Despite the similarity between those two perspectives, it is argued that homomorphism counting power is a better metric for expressiveness, due to reasons such as that homomorphism counts are known¬† to be a good basis upon which many other graph parameters (including subgraph isomorphism counts) can be computed, and that there is an exact equivalence¬†  between the ability to count homomorphisms for some certain classes of query graphs and the well-known Weisfeiler-Leman expressiveness hierarchy, while such equivalence does not exist for substructure counting. As many popular GNNs are designed upon (and easily shown to be as expressive as) variants of WL algorithms, we may now confine our attention to the following question: what exactly query graphs whose homomorphisms can a specific variant of Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm count? While the terminologies in the above question are to be made clear later, we point out that answering the question is not easy. Even for the well-studied kùëòk-dimensional folklore Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms (kùëòk-FWL)¬†  , determining their exact homomorphism counting power relies on the (not so intuitive) concept of tree decompositions¬†. Another work¬†7 closely follows¬†, and extends its result to three other variants of WL algorithms using the language of nested ear decompositions. Despite those efforts, no answer to the above question has been given in the most general setting.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: of 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm, or 1-WL¬†4.
