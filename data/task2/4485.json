      "content": "Paper Title: Complex matrix inversion via real matrix inversions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe do not dispute the reasons in Section 1.1 but numerical linear algebra is a field that benefits from a wide variety of different methods for the same task, each suitable for a different regime. There is no single method that is universally best in every instance. Even the normal equation, frown upon in numerical linear algebra like matrix inversion, can be the ideal method for certain least squares problems. In fact, if we examine the advantages of computing x^L​Usubscript^𝑥𝐿𝑈\\widehat{x}_{LU} over x^𝗂𝗇𝗏subscript^𝑥𝗂𝗇𝗏\\widehat{x}_{\\operatorname{\\mathsf{inv}}} in Section 1.1 more closely, we will find that the conclusion is not so clear cut. Firstly, the comparison in (3) assumes that accuracy is quantified by backward error |b−A​x^|𝑏𝐴^𝑥\\lvert b-A\\widehat{x}\\rvert but in reality it is the forward error |x−x^|𝑥^𝑥\\lvert x-\\widehat{x}\\rvert that is far more important and investigations in  , both analytical and experimental, show that the forward errors of x^L​Usubscript^𝑥𝐿𝑈\\widehat{x}_{LU} and x^𝗂𝗇𝗏subscript^𝑥𝗂𝗇𝗏\\widehat{x}_{\\operatorname{\\mathsf{inv}}} are similar. Secondly, if instead of solving a single linear system A​x=b𝐴𝑥𝑏Ax=b, we have p𝑝p right-hand sides b1,…,bp∈ℂnsubscript𝑏1…subscript𝑏𝑝superscriptℂ𝑛b_{1},\\dots,b_{p}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{n}, then it becomes A​X=B𝐴𝑋𝐵AX=B where B=[b1,…,bp]∈ℂn×p𝐵subscript𝑏1…subscript𝑏𝑝superscriptℂ𝑛𝑝B=[b_{1},\\dots,b_{p}]\\in\\mathbb{C}^{n\\times p} and we seek a solution X∈ℂn×p𝑋superscriptℂ𝑛𝑝X\\in\\mathbb{C}^{n\\times p}. In this case the speed advantage of computing X^L​Usubscript^𝑋𝐿𝑈\\widehat{X}_{LU} over X^𝗂𝗇𝗏subscript^𝑋𝗂𝗇𝗏\\widehat{X}_{\\operatorname{\\mathsf{inv}}} disappears when p=O​(n)𝑝𝑂𝑛p=O(n): Note that the earlier flop count 2​n3/32superscript𝑛332n^{3}/3 for x^L​Usubscript^𝑥𝐿𝑈\\widehat{x}_{LU} ignores the cost of two backsubstitutions but when there are 2​p2𝑝2p backsubstitutions, these may no longer be ignored and are in fact dominant, making the cost of computing X^𝗂𝗇𝗏subscript^𝑋𝗂𝗇𝗏\\widehat{X}_{\\operatorname{\\mathsf{inv}}} and X^L​Usubscript^𝑋𝐿𝑈\\widehat{X}_{LU} comparable. In , it is shown that because of data structure complications, computing X^𝗂𝗇𝗏subscript^𝑋𝗂𝗇𝗏\\widehat{X}_{\\operatorname{\\mathsf{inv}}} can be significantly faster than X^L​Usubscript^𝑋𝐿𝑈\\widehat{X}_{LU}. Moreover, the old wisdom that one may avoid computing explicit inverse matrices, while largely true, is not always true. There are situations, some of them alluded to in [34, p. 260], where computing an explicit inverse matrix is inevitable or favorable: In such radios, explicit inverse matrices are implemented in hardware   . It is straightforward to hardwire or hardcode an explicit inverse matrix but considerably more difficult to do so in the form of “LU factors with permutations and backsubstitutions,” which can require more gates or code space and is more prone to implementation errors. In the so-called KKR CPA algorithm , one needs to integrate the KKR inverse matrix over the first Brillouin zone, necessitating an explicit inverse matrix. The inverse of a matrix often reveals important statistical properties that could only be discerned when one has access to the full explicit inverse  , i.e., we do not know which entries of A−1superscript𝐴1A^{-1} matter until we see all of them. For a specific example, take the ubiquitous model y=X​β^+ε𝑦𝑋^𝛽𝜀y=X\\widehat{\\beta}+\\varepsilon with design matrix X𝑋X and observed values y1,…,ynsubscript𝑦1…subscript𝑦𝑛y_{1},\\dots,y_{n} of the dependent variable y𝑦y , we understand the regression coefficients β^^𝛽\\widehat{\\beta} through the values its covariance matrix Σ≔σ2⋅(X𝖳​X)−1≔Σ⋅superscript𝜎2superscriptsuperscript𝑋𝖳𝑋1\\Sigma\\coloneqq\\sigma^{2}\\cdot(X^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{T}}X)^{-1} where σ2superscript𝜎2\\sigma^{2} is the variance of the dependent variable . To see which values are large (positively correlated), small (negatively correlated), or nearly zero (uncorrelated) in relation to other values, we need access to all values of ΣΣ\\Sigma. For an unbiased estimator θ^​(X)^𝜃𝑋\\widehat{\\theta}(X) of a parameter θ𝜃\\theta, its Cramer–Rao lower bound is the inverse of its Fisher information matrix I​(θ)𝐼𝜃I(\\theta). This is an important quantity that gives a lower bound for the covariance matrix [ref]13  in the sense of covθ⁡(θ^​(X))⪰I​(θ)−1succeeds-or-equalssubscriptcov𝜃^𝜃𝑋𝐼superscript𝜃1\\operatorname{cov}_{\\theta}\\bigl{(}\\widehat{\\theta}(X)\\bigr{)}\\succeq I(\\theta)^{-1} where ⪰succeeds-or-equals\\succeq is the Loewner order. In some Gaussian processes, this lower bound could be attained . We need the explicit matrix inverse I​(θ)−1𝐼superscript𝜃1I(\\theta)^{-1} to understand the limits of certain statistical problems and to design optimal estimators that attain the Cramer–Rao lower bound. The inverses of the adjacency matrix, forward adjacency matrix, and various graph Laplacians of a graph G𝐺G contain important combinatorial properties about G𝐺G     that are only revealed when one examines all entries of their explicit inverse matrices. Matrix inversions do not just arise in numerical computing with floating point operations. They are routinely performed in finite field arithmetic over a base field of the form 𝕜=GF⁡(pn)𝕜GFsuperscript𝑝𝑛\\Bbbk=\\operatorname{GF}(p^{n}) in cryptography  , combinatorics , information theory , and finite field matrix computations . They are also carried out in rational arithmetic over transcendental fields 0 1 6, e.g., with a base field of the form 𝕜=ℚ​(x1,…,xn,ex1,…,exn)𝕜ℚsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛superscript𝑒subscript𝑥1…superscript𝑒subscript𝑥𝑛\\Bbbk=\\mathbb{Q}(x_{1},\\dots,x_{n},e^{x_{1}},\\dots,e^{x_{n}}) and an extension field of the form 𝔽=ℚ​[i]​(x1,…,xn,ex1,…,exn)𝔽ℚdelimited-[]𝑖subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛superscript𝑒subscript𝑥1…superscript𝑒subscript𝑥𝑛\\mathbb{F}=\\mathbb{Q}[i](x_{1},\\dots,x_{n},e^{x_{1}},\\dots,e^{x_{n}}), or with finite fields in place of ℚℚ\\mathbb{Q} and ℚ​[i]ℚdelimited-[]𝑖\\mathbb{Q}[i]. With such exact arithmetic, the considerations in Section 1.1 become irrelevant. In summary, the Frobenius inversion algorithms in this article are useful (i) for problems with well-conditioned A𝐴A, B𝐵B, and A+B​A−1​B𝐴𝐵superscript𝐴1𝐵A+BA^{-1}B but ill-conditioned A+i​B𝐴𝑖𝐵A+iB; (ii) in situations requiring an explicit inverse matrix; (iii) to applications involving exact finite field or rational arithmetic.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: of a parameter θ𝜃\\theta, its Cramer–Rao lower bound is the inverse of its Fisher information matrix I​(θ)𝐼𝜃I(\\theta).
