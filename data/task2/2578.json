Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Airbert: In-domain Pretraining for Vision-and-Language Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the generative setting, an agent is required to predict navigable actions step by step.\nWe adopt the state-of-the-art generative model Recurrent VLN-BERT [ref]15 for R2R and REVERIE tasks.\nThe model uses a pretrained multimodal transformer as a backbone and adds recurrence to a state token to keep track of history for sequential action prediction.\nAlthough the original Recurrent VLN-BERT model only implements an LXMERT-like  architecture PREVALENT [ref]13, and one-stream BERT-like architecture OSCAR , it is easy to plug our two-stream ViLBERT architecture as the backbone. The adapted model is shown in Figure 7(b).\nFor initialization, the language stream is used to encode the instruction C𝐶C into an instruction representation H𝐻H.\nAs no visual inputs are used during the initialization, the co-attention modules in the original language stream of ViLBERT are removed, and the output feature of the [CLS] token is used as the agent’s initial state s0subscript𝑠0s_{0}.\nFor navigation at each step k𝑘k, the visual stream takes the previous state sk−1subscript𝑠𝑘1s_{k-1}, visual observations Vksubscript𝑉𝑘V_{k} at step k𝑘k and the encoded language features H𝐻H to generate a new state sksubscript𝑠𝑘s_{k} and action decision pksubscript𝑝𝑘p_{k}. When fine-tuning on the R2R dataset, we use scene features with a ResNet-152 pretrained on Places365  and augment the training data with generated path-instruction pairs from [ref]13.\nWe train the model via imitation learning and A2C reinforcement learning for 300,000 iterations with a batch size of 16 and learning rate of 10−5superscript10510^{-5}.\nWhen fine-tuning on the REVERIE dataset, object features encoded by a Bottom-Up Top-Down attention model [ref]4 are used along with the scene features.\nThe model is trained for 200,000 iterations with a batch size of 8.\nAll the experimental setups for fine-tuning are the same as [ref]15 for a fair comparison.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: In the generative setting, an agent is required to predict navigable actions step by step.\nWe adopt the state-of-the-art generative model Recurrent VLN-BERT [ref]15 for R2R and REVERIE tasks.\nThe model uses a pretrained multimodal transformer as a backbone and adds recurrence to a state token to keep track of history for sequential action\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
