      "content": "Paper Title: Learnable Gabor modulated complex-valued networks for orientation robustness\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe enable learning of approximate orientation invariance and equivariance in convolutional neural networks (CNN).\nDatasets in various domains often exhibit a range of pose variation (e.g. scale, translation, orientation, reflection).\nCNNs are inherently equipped to handle translation invariance, but remedies for other symmetries often involve large models and datasets with plenty of augmentation.\nThis inability to properly adapt to transformations such as local/global rotations is a major limitation in CNNs. An important distinction is that of equivariance versus invariance. For a network to be equivariant, it should be robust to variation in pose and be able to carry over transformations of the input to transformed features and output.\nFor tasks where output is dependent on these transformations, network invariance alone is suboptimal as transformation information is discarded, by definition.\nFor example, in ultra deep astronomical imaging, the scattered light from foreground Galactic cirrus contaminates and occludes interesting Low-Surface Brightness (LSB) extragalactic objects.\nThese cirrus clouds exhibit orientation dependent features:\nsegmenting cloud regions is a problem requiring invariance, as orientation of cloud streaks does not necessarily affect the geometry of the cloud’s envelope.\nOn the other hand, removing occluding clouds, which is crucial to studying background LSB galaxies, is a denoising problem that requires robust and descriptive equivariant features. Numerous works have been published alongside CNN research attempting to integrate forms of rotation invariant and equivariant feature learning in an a-priori fashion.\nApproaches typically generate rotation dependent responses by one of the following strategies: 1) learning orientations by constructing filters from a steerable basis [ref]1 [ref]2 , 2) rotating convolution filters/input by preset angles   , or 3) introducing orientation information through analytical filters  [ref]8.\nA significant drawback of the former type is that it introduces significant computational overhead .\nIn the second category, the rotation process imposes the use of interpolation which results in artefacts for any rotation outside of the discrete sampling grid.\nThis is overcome in the latter category by using analytical filters with an inherent rotation parameter. Orientations are static in  [ref]8, similarly to the second category, however there is no inherent limitation of analytical filters preventing them from having learnable orientation parameters.\nThere is thus a need for a dynamic orientation sensitive architecture that can accurately adapt to the input’s transformation. We address this need in this work using Gabor filters, analytical filters that are parameterised by orientation, scale and frequency among other variables.\nFurthermore, Gabor filters are differentiable with respect to their parameters, meaning that these parameters can be learned through steepest descent style algorithms. Contributions - In this paper we propose Learnable Gabor Convolutional Networks (LGCN), a complex-valued CNN architecture highly sensitive to rotation transformations. We utilise adjustable Gabor modulation of convolutional weights to generate dynamic orientation activations.\nBy learning Gabor parameters alongside convolutional filters we achieve features that are dependent on exact angles with no interpolation artefacts.\nMoreover, there is no explicit constraint on convolutional filters, allowing a diverse feature space that adapts to the degree of rotation equivariance required.\nWe extend the modulation approach used in  to complex space, enabling use of the full complex Gabor filter and exploiting the inherent descriptive power of complex neurons.\nFurther, we build on this and propose a convolutional operator where Gabor filter modulation is cyclically shifted, inspired by group theory CNNs  [ref]1   , allowing propagation of orientation information throughout a forward pass in an equivariant manner.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: in an a-priori fashion.\nApproaches typically generate rotation dependent responses by one of the following strategies: 1) learning orientations by constructing filters from a steerable basis [ref]1 [ref]2 , 2) rotating convolution filters/input by preset angles   , or 3) introducing orientation information through analytical filters  [ref]8.\nA significant drawback of the former type is\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
