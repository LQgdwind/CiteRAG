      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Text Generation by Learning from Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnsupervised text generation. There has been extensive work on neural unsupervised text generation. One popular approach is the variational auto-encoder , which is able to generate text by manipulated latent space for certain attributes, such as sentiment , topic , and syntax [ref]53. Recently, search-based methods has been developed for various text generation tasks, including text simplification , summarization, keyword-to-text generation 9, and paraphrasing 9 4. However, these methods are not learnable; hence, the inference is inefficient and the performance cannot be improved by training. Most of other work of unsupervised text generation is built upon heuristics of certain tasks. For instance, Narayan and Gardent  propose a task-specific pipeline for sentence simplification. Zheng and Lapata  employ a graph-based ranking algorithm to select the most significant sentence as the summarization of a document. Chu and Liu  utilize the overlapping of text as a hint for multi-document summarization. In our work, the proposed tgls is a generic framework, which also allows encoding prior knowledge of a task into the search algorithm. Paraphrase generation. Most of the recent work on paraphrase generation focuses on neural models trained with large scale parallel-datasets. Several of them adopt different search techniques in supervised learning. The RL-based approaches propose to learn reward functions to score sampled sequence   . Besides, Du and Ji  finds that the learning-to-search approach can improve the performance of neural paraphrasing model. While our work mainly considers search and learning for unsupervised generation. There is a group of work that utilizes (statistical- or neural-) machine translation (MT) systems, generating paraphrase by translating source sentences into a pivot language, and then translate it back into the original language   . Although no supervision of paraphrase is needed, the success of this approach depends on one or more high-quality MT systems, and hence large-scale parallel datasets for training translation models. For unsupervised paraphrasing, one direction is to perform sampling by either a latent-space variational posterior sampler  or a word-space Metropolis–Hastings (MH) sampler 9. By decreasing the temperature of the stationary distribution, Liu et al. 4 show that search-based formulation outperforms sampling for unsupervised text generation. Our work further extends it to a learning-from-search framework, improving both accuracy and inference efficiency. Text style transfer. Our text formalization is one application of text style transfer. Other examples include sentiment  and the prose style 9.\nTypically, text style transfer can be divided into three categories: parallel supervised, non-parallel supervised (with only style labels), and purely unsupervised. Parallel supervised style transfer trains a sequence-to-sequence model , whereas purely unsupervised style transfer replies on disentangling latent space 7. Most previous work on text style transfer is in the non-parallel supervised setting, assuming style labels are available. Researchers have developed style embedding-based approaches  , style-specific decoders , style-word editing approaches 2, among others. Our approach also follows this setting, but to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to model style transfer as a search problem, as well as to extend it to the proposed tgls framework of search and learning.\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: text generation.
