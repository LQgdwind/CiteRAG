      "content": "Paper Title: Accelerating Dataset Distillation via Model Augmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset Distillation (DD) [ref]47  or Dataset Condensation [ref]55 , aims to reduce the training cost by generating a small but informative synthetic set of training examples; such that the performance of a model trained on the small synthetic set is similar to that trained on the original, large-scale dataset.\nRecently, DD has become an increasingly more popular research topic and has been explored in a variety of contexts, including federated learning  , continual learning 2 9, neural architecture search  , medical computing   and graph neural networks  . DD has been typically cast as a meta-learning problem  involving bilevel optimization. For instance, Wang et al. [ref]47 formulate the network parameters as a function of the learnable synthetic set in the inner-loop optimization; then optimize the synthetic set by minimizing classification loss on the real data in the outer-loop. This recursive computation hinders its application to real-world large-scale model training, which involves thousands to millions of gradient descent steps. Several methods have been proposed to improve the DD method by introducing ridge regression loss  5, trajectory matching loss , etc.\nTo avoid unrolling the recursive computation graph, Zhao et al.  propose to learn synthetic set by matching gradients generated by real and synthetic data when training deep networks. Based on this surrogate goal, several methods have been proposed to improve the informativeness or compatibility of synthetic datasets from other perspectives, ranging from data augmentation , contrastive signaling 3, resolution reduction 2, and bit encoding . Although model training on a small synthetic set is fast, the dataset distillation process is typically expensive. For instance, the state-of-the-art method IDC 2 takes approximately 30 hours to condense 50,000 CIFAR-10 images into 500 synthetic images with a single RTX-2080 GPU, which is equivalent to the time it takes to train 60 ConvNet-3 models on the original dataset. Furthermore, the distillation time cost will rapidly increase for large-scale datasets e.g. ImageNet-1K, which prevents its application in computation-limited environments like end-user devices. Prior work [ref]55 on reducing the distillation cost results in significant regression from the state-of-the-art performance.\nIn this paper, we aim to speed up the dataset distillation process, while preserving even improving the testing performance over state-of-the-art methods. Prior works are computationally expensive as they focus on generalization ability such that the learned synthetic set is useful to train many different networks as opposed to a targeted network. This requires optimizing the synthetic set over thousands of differently initialized networks.\nFor example, IDC 2 learns the synthetic set over 2000 randomly initialized models, while the trajectory matching method (TM)  optimizes the synthetic set for 10000 distillation steps with 200 pre-trained expert models.\nDataset distillation, which learns the synthetic data that is generalizable to unseen models, can be considered as an orthogonal approach to model training which learns model parameters that are generalizable to unseen data. Similarly, training the synthetic data with diverse models leads to better generalization performance.\nThis intuitive idea leads to the following research questions: Question 1. How to design the candidate pool of models to learn synthetic data, for instance, consisting of randomly initialized, early-stage or well-trained models?  Prior works [ref]47  2  use models from all training stages. The underlying assumption is that models from all training stages have similar importance. Zhao et al. [ref]55 show that synthetic sets with similar generalization performance can be learned with different model parameter distributions, given an objective function in the form of feature distribution matching between real and synthetic data. In this paper, we take a closer look at this problem and show that learning synthetic data on early-stage models is more efficient for gradient/parameter matching based dataset distillation methods. Question 2. Can we learn a good synthetic set using only a few models?\n Our goal is to learn a synthetic set with a small number of (pre-trained) models to minimize the computational cost. However, using fewer models leads to poor generalization ability of the synthetic set. Therefore, we propose to apply parameter perturbation on selected early-stage models to incorporate model diversity and improve the generalization ability of the learned synthetic set. In a nutshell, we propose two model augmentation techniques to accelerate the training speed of dataset distillation, namely using early-stage models and parameter perturbation to learn an informative synthetic set with significantly less training cost.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1., our method achieves up to 20×\\times speedup and comparable performance on par with state-of-the-art DD methods.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: Dataset Distillation (DD) [ref]47  or Dataset Condensation [ref]55 , aims to reduce the training cost by generating a small but informative synthetic set of training examples; such that the performance of a model trained on\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
