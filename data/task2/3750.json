      "content": "Paper Title: Transfer Attacks Revisited: A Large-Scale Empirical Study in Real Computer Vision Settings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) achieve tremendous success in a variety of application domains  , but they are inherently vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs) which are malicious samples crafted to deceive target DNNs [ref]44   . This vulnerability significantly hinders their use in security-sensitive domains. Among the many properties of AEs, the transferability, that an AE crafted with respect to one DNN also works against other DNNs, is particularly intriguing. Leveraging this property, the adversary could forge AEs using a surrogate DNN to attack the target DNN without knowledge of the target. This is highly dangerous because an increasing number of cloud-based MLaaS platforms are deploying DNNs with public API.\nFurthermore, given that years’ advances in technology did not eliminate this vulnerability, it is highly likely that\ntransferability stems from the intrinsic properties of DNNs. Understanding the phenomenon improves the interpretability of DNNs in its own right as well. Therefore, understanding the deciding factors of transferability and their working mechanisms has attracted intensive researches [ref]44 6  [ref]29   . However, to the best of our knowledge, all systematic empirical studies are conducted under controlled “lab” environments that are too ideal to make the derived conclusions reliable in the real environment. For instance, many\nstudies  6 give the adversary access to the training data of the target\nmodel, and some others  discuss surrogates with similar complexity to the target model.\nAlthough there are studies that attack deployed DNNs known as cloud models [ref]29, their conclusions are neither systematic nor informative enough, suffering from the lack of adequate observations to do statistical tests and suitable metrics to account for the difference between lab and real settings.\nThe difference between lab and real environment includes: Complexity and architecture of the target.\nIn the real environment, neither the target’s complexity nor its architecture is known to the attacker. The cloud model could be arguably far more complicated than a surrogate and of an uncommon architecture.\nUnder this circumstance, the conclusions derived from academic target models may not hold, calling for thorough examinations. Training of the target.\nIn the real environment, the adversary knows nothing about the training\ndetails of the target, including the optimization hyperparameters and algorithms. Additionally, the training datasets are far more complicated and noisy in the real environment222Amazon declares they have access to billions of images daily and continue to learn from new data ., increasing the difficulty in simulating a similar training environment at\nlocal. Structure of the input.\nThe cloud models are designed for high resolution images. Therefore, the cloud models\nmay not produce meaningful outputs for inputs from academic datasets that are extremely low resolution like MNIST  and CIFAR10 , as shown in Figure 1(a).\nConclusions made on these toy datasets may not hold under this condition. Structure of the output.\nCloud models usually return multiple predictions and their corresponding confidences, which are different from the logits returned by classifiers in lab settings (multiple returns problem). In addition, cloud models usually have a significantly larger set of labels333Google shares an open dataset consisting of about 60M labels . that are hard to estimate and categorize locally (class inconsistency problem). These differences, as depicted in Figure 1, add to the difficulty in measuring the effectiveness of transfer attacks in a real-world scenario. To address these limitations, we conduct a large-scale systematic empirical study on\ntransfer attacks in the real settings. To comprehensively explore the possible factors\nthat may affect the transferability, we combine different settings of the attack\ncomponents at local environment where AEs are generated. To thoroughly evaluate\nthe effectiveness of transfer attacks and the robustness of real-world models, we\nselect four leading cloud-based Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS)\nplatforms, namely Aliyun (Alibaba Cloud), Baidu Cloud, AWS Rekognition and Google Cloud Vision as the targets. Our contributions include: We identify the main gaps of evaluating transfer attack in the real world, namely multiple returns problem and label inconsistency problem, and extend existing metrics to address these difficulties. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first metrics that can be reasonably applied to analyze transfer attack on MLaaS systems. We conduct a systematic evaluation on the transferability of adversarial\nattacks against four leading commercial MLaaS platforms on two computer\nvision tasks: object classification and gender classification, using datasets\nconsisting of real-world pictures in order to get meaningful insights (ImageNet  and Adience , respectively). Based on the results of our evaluation, we measure the robustness of the discussed platforms and point out that while on average transfer attack performs poorly, they can be systematically designed to achieve stable success rates, \\eg, use FGSM for the object classification.\nMore detailed guidelines for the industry is provided in Appendix X-F. We hope this will help the\nindustry fortify their models and improve their services. We explore the possible factors that may affect the transferability using\n180 different settings as the combination of components in a transfer attack. 36,000 AEs in total generated from 200 seed images for each task are evaluated, making the conclusions statistically adequate. We find that some former conclusions can be\ngeneralized to the real settings while some others are inapplicable. A\ncomparison between the former conclusions and their real-world counterparts is\nshown in Table I. Additionally, we demonstrate that transfer attacks possess many previously unknown properties in real-world environments. We believe that our\nfindings will provide new insights for future\nresearch.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: (DNNs) achieve tremendous success in a variety of application domains  , but they are inherently vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs) which are malicious samples crafted to deceive target DNNs [ref]44   .
