      "content": "Paper Title: Quantized Embedding Vectors for Controllable Diffusion Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLarge language models (LLMs) have shown their ability to generate high quality text [ref]1  and produce task-controllable outputs [ref]3 . Fine-tuning methods (e.g.,  ) can be employed to control LLMs based on supervised data, such as control text . This involves freezing pre-trained LLMs and generating texts using an external classifier, leading to lightweight and modular plug-and-play language models (PPLMs) [ref]8.\nNevertheless, achievements in control thus far have been restricted to basic attribute-level controls, such as sentiment or topic. [ref]3 [ref]8, and there is a need to improve their portability, convergence speed and perplexity [ref]3 . The existing practical challenge refers to optimizing the embedding and accelerating the generation process. The learned embedding defines a mapping that bridges the discrete text and the continuous input, and its quality affects the language perplexity. Accordingly, in the text generation process, (1) obtaining generation language models (GLMs) from scratch should be avoided; (2) the generating process should be facilitated; and the embedding space should be optimized by processing learned embedding vectors, as pre-trained and learned embedding vectors outperform randomly initialized embedding vectors on controllable DLMs (Diffusion Language Models) ; and (3) GLMs should be obtained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (FT) methods to reduce the tunable weights. Neural network quantization has revolutionized modern deep learning by alleviating the issue of pressing demand for computing resources and power due to increasing size and training time of neural networks. Quantization methods in combination with continuous diffusion language models also have shown success in various domains such as computer vision , audio and music generation  . However, applying these methods to text generation has been challenging due to the discrete nature of text . On the other hand, adapter tuning methods have been widely used to fine-tune pre-trained language models by incorporating small neural modules into them, see    and references therein. Despite the effectiveness of this fine-tuning technique, it has not been explored in the context of controllable DLMs. To address (2) and (3), we propose a novel controllable DLM called Quantized Embedding Controllable Diffusion Language Models (QE-CDLM). This model is based on continuous diffusion and incorporates an adaption FT method to reduce the number of tunable weights. As shown in Figure 1, the QE-CDLM begins with a pre-trained language model (LM), which is fed with Gaussian noise vectors and word-corresponding vectors. The embedding spaces for different control tasks are then remodeled and optimized using corresponding quantization methods. This quantization process on embedding vectors leads to a reduction in the perplexity of the generated text. Additionally, the LoRA method, an efficient fine-tuning technique, balances the trade-off between tunable weights and the quality of DLMs. The contributions of QE-CDLM are as follows: We validate that quantizing the task-adapting embedding vectors makes controllable DLMs converging faster than the method of independent learned embedding vectors. The quantized embedding vector optimizes the task-specific embedding space in controllable DLMs. Utilizing quantization techniques, e.g., ternarization and binarization of embedding vectors, leads to control texts with improved perplexity. The adaption fine-tuning method achieves a satisfying trade-off between the quality of controllable DLMs and the number of tunable weights. Compared to classical FT methods, this approach shows competitive performance in generating control texts with a reduced number of tunable weights, making it more affordable, and thus increasing the portability. Our code to reproduce all the experimental results is publicly available at https://github.com/ChengKang520/Q-Controllable-DLM.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Large language models (LLMs) have shown their ability to generate high quality text [ref]1  and produce task-controllable outputs [ref]3 .
