      "content": "Paper Title: Retentive Neural Quantum States: Efficient Ansätze for Ab Initio Quantum Chemistry\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTransformer-based NQS ansatze  were introduced in part to improve upon an existing parallelizable autoregressive ansatz [ref]35 based on MADE , a feedforward network that preserves the autoregressive property by applying a set of fixed binary masks to its own weights, making it a strong choice for the modulus network. MADE outputs a full set of conditional probabilities for its given input sequence, so effective sampling requires n𝑛n full passes through the network, starting with a sequence of dummy spins and replacing them qubit-by-qubit with sampled configurations. The MADE ansatz demonstrates superior accuracy to CCSD techniques when applied to electronic ground state calculations [ref]36. MADE’s simple structure and ease of parallelization does come at a price: the binary masks necessitate that a substantial portion of network weights do not contribute to the model’s output, reducing MADE’s expressiveness relative to its size. Moreover, as a feedforward network, the size of the MADE network is explicitly tied to the number of qubits in the NQS system and must grow with it. These hindrances motivate the search for more expressive and scalable autoregressive networks, like the transformer. First developed for natural language processing (NLP), the transformer [ref]32 operates in direct contrast with recurrent models—which process input sequences entry-by-entry through multiple forward passes—by processing the entire sequence of inputs at once inside a single forward pass. The fundamental architectural component of the transformer is the multi-headed attention block, which processes the input sequences. The functional form of a single attention head is given as follows Here, a batch X𝑋X of (embedded) input vectors is projected by WQsubscript𝑊𝑄W_{Q}, WKsubscript𝑊𝐾W_{K}, and WVsubscript𝑊𝑉W_{V} to batches Q𝑄Q, K𝐾K, and V𝑉V of dksubscript𝑑𝑘d_{k}-dimensional query, key, and value vectors. In practice, we choose dv=dksubscript𝑑𝑣subscript𝑑𝑘d_{v}=d_{k}. After computing all possible inner products between queries and keys, a softmax function converts the inner products corresponding with a specific query into weights for the values: the result is referred to as a context vector. Several residual, layer norm, and feedforward layers perform additional processing on these context vectors following attention. Informally, attention compares all pairs of entries in the input sequence in order to produce a single weighted context vector for each input. A multi-headed attention block independently operates several attention heads in tandem so the transformer can learn multiple forms of context simultaneously. The explicit term-by-term comparison of inputs not only parallelizes easily during training, but also allows attention to capture correlations between relatively distant inputs in the sequence, a feature distinguishing transformers from RNNs that rely on an iteratively updated internal memory vector to identify and preserve correlations between inputs. The initial transformer architecture is an encoder-decoder model, with only the decoder being truly autoregressive. In practice, the encoder and decoder are often used independently, and both can be made autoregressive with proper input masking. The NQS-Transformer architecture  applies the NQS ansatz QiankunNet , which pairs a transformer modulus network with a feedforward phase network, to electronic ground state calculations at problem sizes beyond those tested with MADE. Because transformers explicitly learn correlations between inputs, and because the number of parameters given in a transformer is not intrinsically tied to the length of the input sequences—in this case, the number of qubits n𝑛n in the NQS problem—the transformer provides a suitable candidate for improved NQS scalability over MADE despite being a more sophisticated architecture. Nonetheless, the transformer still presents some room for improvement in scalability, particularly during inference. Regardless of how many parameters it possesses, the transformer will always require O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}) time to perform a forward pass. This bottleneck occurs inside the attention heads, since attention explicitly and nonlinearly compares all pairs of inputs. This time complexity is unavoidable even for autoregressive attention, since input is so compared with every preceding input. The caching of keys and values during inference, known as KV caching , increases efficiency by eliminating redundant calculations, and FlashAttention  and its successors have helped to significantly reduce the time needed to perform attention on GPU hardware. Nonetheless, quadratic time complexity is an inherent property of attention. Since NQS requires multiple forward passes of its own ansatz at every iteration in order to create the data used to train the model, a model that possesses the transformer’s advantages in training, but can perform inference in sub-quadratic time, would possess an inherent scalability advantage as an ansatz. This desire exists within the general field of LLMs beyond NQS, and several efforts have been made to reduce attention complexity through linear approximation of attention , dual-form RNNs that offer greater parallelization during training  , and state space models . These models show significant promise and it is natural to consider any one of them as a potential transformer alternative in NQS.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: Transformer-based NQS ansatze  were introduced in part to improve upon an existing parallelizable autoregressive ansatz [ref]35 based on MADE , a feedforward network that preserves the autoregressive property by applying a set of fixed binary masks to its own weights, making it a strong choice for the modulus network.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
