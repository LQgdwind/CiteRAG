      "content": "Paper Title: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes in Robotics: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe key source of uncertainty in multi-robot coordination is the asymmetry of information available to each robot in the team.\nIf communication is limited, the action-observation history of robot j𝑗j is in general not known to another robot i𝑖i.\nThis means that it is not possible for i𝑖i to predict which action j𝑗j will take, as this depends on both j𝑗j’s policy and j𝑗j’s private action-observation history.\nThis makes coordination challenging. One way to avoid the complexity of a decentralized solution is to assume that robots can freely communicate so-as to share a single shared belief state [105, Sec. 2.4.3.]. In the resulting multi-agent POMDP the action space consists of joint action tuples (a1,a2,…,an)superscript𝑎1superscript𝑎2…superscript𝑎𝑛(a^{1},a^{2},\\ldots,a^{n}) of each of the n𝑛n robots in the team, and the observation space consists of joint observation tuples (z1,…,zn)superscript𝑧1…superscript𝑧𝑛(z^{1},\\ldots,z^{n}).\nThis multi-agent POMDP is simply a POMDP where the actions and observations have a tuple structure, and standard POMDP solvers may be applied to compute a policy.\nSuch a policy is often realized by deploying a centralized coordinator that uses the current belief state to determine the next individual action aisuperscript𝑎𝑖a^{i} of each robot i𝑖i, and then receives the individual observations zisuperscript𝑧𝑖z^{i} to update the belief state via Bayes’ rule.\nThis approach has been successfully applied in many multi-robot coordination problems, see, e.g.,       .\nThe communication requirement is a major practical challenge of applying multi-agent POMDPs. A decentralized POMDP (Dec-POMDP) takes the approach of “centralized planning with decentralized execution” .\nLike the multi-agent POMDP, the Dec-POMDP also replaces the action and observation spaces by the joint action and joint observation space.\nHowever, the solution of a Dec-POMDP is a decentralized policy that each robot in the team can execute individually, without having to know the action-observation histories of other robots, or sharing a belief state.\nThe policy is computed centrally, and then distributed to each robot for decentralized execution.\nNo communication at execution time is assumed, but any available communication can be explicitly modeled [105, Sec. 8.3].\nThis approach is used for multi-robot coordination in, e.g.,     [ref]86.\nWhile the Dec-POMDP approach is extremely general, it is also computationally more challenging than solving a POMDP .\nWe refer the reader to  for technical details.\n\nReference markers found: [86]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]86: execution.\nNo communication at execution time is assumed, but any available communication can be explicitly modeled [105, Sec. 8.3].\nThis approach is used for multi-robot coordination in, e.g.,     [ref]86.\nWhile the Dec-POMDP approach is extremely general, it is also computationally more challenging than solving a POMDP .\nWe refer the reader to  for technical details.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
