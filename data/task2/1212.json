      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Playing Full MOBA Games with Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur work belongs to system-level AI development for strategy video game playing, so we mainly discuss representative works along this line, covering RTS and MOBA games. StarCraft has been used as the testbed for Game AI research in RTS for many years.\nMethods adopted by existing studies include rule-based, supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and their combinations  .\nFor rule-based methods, a representative is SAIDA, the champion of StarCraft AI Competition 2018 (see https://github.com/TeamSAIDA/SAIDA).\nFor learning-based methods, recently, AlphaStar combined supervised learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning and achieved the grandmaster level in playing StarCraft 2 [ref]33.\nOur value estimation (Section 3.2) shares similarity to AlphaStar’s by using invisible opponent’s information. Recently, a macro strategy model, named Tencent HMS, was proposed for MOBA Game AI .\nSpecifically, HMS is a functional component for guiding where to go on the map during the game, without considering the action execution of agents, i.e., micro control or micro-management in esports, and is thus not a complete AI solution.\nThe most relevant works are Tencent Solo  and OpenAI Five .\nYe et al.  performed a thorough and systematic study on the playing mechanics of different MOBA heroes.\nThey developed a RL system that masters the micro control of agents in MOBA combats.\nHowever, only 1v1 solo games were studied without the much more sophisticated multi-agent 5v5 games.\nOn the other hand, the similarities between this work and Ye et al.  include: the modeling of action heads (the value heads are different) and off-policy correction (adaption).\nIn 2019, OpenAI introduced an AI for playing 5v5 games in Dota 2, called OpenAI Five, with the ability to defeat professional human players .\nOpenAI Five is based on deep reinforcement learning via self-play.\nIt trains using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) 8.\nThe major difference between our work and OpenAI Five is that the goal of this paper is to develop AI programs towards playing full MOBA games. Hence, methodologically, we introduce a set of techniques of off-policy adaption, curriculum self-play learning, value estimation, and tree-search that addresses the scalability issue in training and playing a large pool of heroes.\nOn the other hand, the similarities between this work and OpenAI Five include: the design of action space for modeling MOBA hero’s actions, the use of recurrent neural network like LSTM for handling partial observability, and the use of one model with shared weights to control all heroes.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: learning-based methods, recently, AlphaStar combined supervised learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning and achieved the grandmaster level in playing StarCraft 2 [ref]33.\nOur value estimation (Section 3.2) shares similarity to AlphaStar’s by using invisible opponent’s information. Recently, a macro strategy model, named Tencent HMS, was proposed for MOBA Game\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
