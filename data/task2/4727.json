      "content": "Paper Title: 3D Scene Flow Estimation on Pseudo-LiDAR: Bridging the Gap on Estimating Point Motion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe scene flow  estimates the motion of 3D point in the scene, which is different from LiDAR odometry [ref]2 that estimates the consistent pose transformation of the entire scene. 3D scene flow is more flexible. The flexibility of scene flow makes it capable of assisting in many different tasks, such as object tracking  and LiDAR odometry[ref]2. Generally, depth and optical flow together represent the scene flow in the scene flow estimation method based on 2D image   or RGBD image. Mono-SF  infers the scene flow of visible points using constraints on motion invariance of multi-view geometric and depth distribution of a single view. To obtain more reliable scene flow, Hur et al.  propagate temporal constraints to continuous multi-frame images. RAFT-3D  estimates the scene flow by soft grouping pixels into rigid objects. The nature of the scene flow being the 3D motion vectors is split by the methods for estimating scene flow by optical flow and pixel depth in image space. Because of the lack of explicit 3D geometry information in the image space, these methods often cause large pixel matching errors during scene flow inference. For example, two unrelated points that are far apart in 3D space may be very close to each other in the image plane. Dewan et al.  predict 3D scene flow from adjacent frames of LiDAR data in a without-learning method. This method requires various strong assumptions, such as that the local structure will not be deformed by the motion in the 3D scene. Some recent works  [ref]9 0 1 learn 3D scene flow from point cloud pairs based on deep neural network. However, these methods of 3D scene Ô¨Çow estimation are invariably self-supervised/supervised on the synthesized dataset FlyingThings3D 2 and evaluated the generalization of the model on the real-world dataset KITTI Scene Flow 3. The models trained on the synthesized dataset will cause accuracy degradation in the real world [ref]9. 3D scene flow annotations are very scarce in real-world datasets. Some works 1 [ref]9 proposes some excellent self-supervised losses, but these are difficult to achieve success on LiDAR signals. LiDAR signals are recognized to have two weaknesses, sparsity and point cloud distortion. Firstly, the existing self-supervised losses [ref]9 1 imply a strong assumption of point-by-point correspondence. But point clouds from different moments are inherently discrete. The point-by-point correspondence and the discrete nature of the point cloud are contradictory. The sparsity of the LiDAR signal further exacerbates this fact. Secondly, the data collection process for mechanical LiDAR is accompanied by motion, which results in point cloud points in the same frame not being collected at the same moment, i.e., point cloud distortion. However, 3D scene flow estimation is the process of local 3D matching, which requires accurate temporal information. Unlike the LiDAR signal, the pseudo-LiDAR signal comes from the back-projection of the dense depth map into a 3D point cloud. Almost no distortion is caused by pseudo-LiDAR due to the instantaneous capture of the image. A novel structure is designed in this paper to enable self-supervised learning of scene flow to benefit from pseudo-LiDAR. Although the spatial position of the points in the point cloud generated from the depth map is not always accurate, our method is still able to find the correspondence between the points in adjacent frames well. As shown in Fig. 1, the point clouds of adjacent frames have similar representations of same objects in the scene because the performance of the depth estimation network is unchanged. Thus the spatial features of a point at frame tùë°t can easily find similar spatial features at frame t+1ùë°1t+1 and this match is usually accurate. On the other hand, the camera is cheaper than LiDAR. Although the cost of LiDAR is shrinking year by year, there is still an undeniable cost difference between LiDAR and camera. Recently, Ouster released an inexpensive OS1-128 LiDAR, but the price still costs $18,000 4. The stereo camera system may provide a low-cost backup system for the LiDAR-based scheme of scene flow estimation. In summary, our key contributions are as follows: A self-supervised method for learning 3D scene flow from stereo images is proposed. Pseudo-LiDAR based on stereo images is introduced into 3D scene flow estimation. The method in this paper bridges the gap between 2D data and the task of estimating 3D point motion. The sparse and distortion characteristics of the LiDAR point cloud bring errors for the calculation of existing self-supervised loss of the 3D scene flow. The introduction of the pseudo-LiDAR point cloud in this paper improves the effectiveness of these self-supervised losses because of the dense and non-distortion characteristics of the pseudo-LiDAR point cloud, which is demonstrated by experiments in this paper. 3D points with large errors caused by depth estimation are filtered out as much as possible to reduce the impact of noise points on the scene flow estimation. A novel disparity consistency loss is proposed by exploiting the coupling relationship between 3D scene flow and stereo depth estimation.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: The scene flow  estimates the motion of 3D point in the scene, which is different from LiDAR odometry [ref]2 that estimates the consistent pose transformation of the entire scene. 3D scene flow is more flexible.
