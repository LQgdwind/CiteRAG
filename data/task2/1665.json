      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable Causal Domain Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDomain Adaptation. Here, we provide a brief overview of the main domain adaptation scenarios that can be found in the literature. There are three main domain adaptation problems: (1) Covariate shift, which is one of the most studied forms of data shift, occurs if the marginal distributions of context variables change across the source and target domains while the posterior (conditional) distributions are the same between source and target domains   . (2) Target shift occurs if the marginal distributions of the target variable change across the source and target domains while the posterior distributions remain the same   [ref]24.\n(3) Concept shift occurs if marginal distributions between source and target domains remain unchanged while the posteriors change across the domains   .\nWe only focus on the covariate shift in this paper. Since assuming invariance of conditionals makes sense if the conditionals represent causal mechanisms , we use the relaxed version of the usual covariate shift assumption and assume that it holds for a subset of predictor variables, as suggested and used in  . Causal Inference in Domain Adaptation. Here, we briefly provide an overview of causal inference methods that address the problem of covariate shift: (1) Transportability     expresses knowledge about differences and commonalities between the source and target domains in a formalism called selection diagram. Using this representation and the do-calculus , enable us to derive a procedure for deciding whether effects in the target domain can be inferred from experiments conducted in the source domain(s).\n(2) Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP) techniques    search\nfor finding a subset of variables to estimate individual regressions for\neach domain in a way that produces regression residuals with equal distribution across all\ndomains. Theoretical identifiability guarantees for the set of direct causal predictors for ICP techniques are limited to the linear Gaussian models. In other words, when the model is non-linear, non-Gaussian, or there are latent confounders, there is no guarantee that the obtained set is the set of direct causal predictors  .\n(3) Graph surgery 2 3\nremoves variables generated by unstable mechanisms from the joint factorization to yield a distribution invariant to the differences across domains. (4) Graph pruning methods   formalized as a feature selection problem in which the goal is to find\nthe optimal subset that the conditional distribution of the target variable given this subset of predictors is invariant across domains. Both transportability and graph surgery methods need to know the causal model of interest in advance.\nHowever, learning causal models from data is a challenging task, especially in the presence of unmeasured confounders . On the other hand, graph pruning methods do not rely on prior knowledge of the causal graph, but they currently do not scale beyond dozens of variables .\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: and target domains   . (2) Target shift occurs if the marginal distributions of the target variable change across the source and target domains while the posterior distributions remain the same   [ref]24.\n(3) Concept shift occurs if marginal distributions between source and target domains remain unchanged while the posteriors change across the domains   .\nWe only focus on the covariate shift\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
