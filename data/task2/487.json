      "content": "Paper Title: Estimating semantic structure for the VQA answer space\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate our contributions on the following two VQA corpuses: has been proposed in  and\ncontains open-ended questions in natural language about real images. The\ncorpus gathers 265K images with at least 3 questions for each. Each question is annotated with 10 ground-truth answers. has been introduced in ¬†. It has been constructed by reorganizing the training and validation splits of the VQAv2¬† dataset in order to explicitly make the distribution of answers different between the training and test.\nIn other words, the VQAv2-CP dataset has been designed to measure the sensitivity of a VQA model to the language bias, and therefore is a test for measuring the ability of a model to generalize to unseen situations. The evaluation of our contribution on VQAv2-CP is a particularly interesting setup, as obtaining good results there requires an agent to reason beyond exploiting biases. This is important in the context of our contribution. While classical auxiliary losses add additional difficulty to a learning task, as for instance self-supervised contrastive losses 7, the proposed semantic loss is a different case as it is inherently still based on classification of the answer classes, albeit on a restructured output space. Testing this auxiliary loss in a setting, where the training distribution equals the test distribution would make the evaluation unfavorable by introducing a difference between the minimized objective and the evaluation metric. We claim that the new semantic loss increases reasoning and decreases the dependence on biases, which is better evaluated on datasets with shifts in distributions such as VQAv2-CP. We nevertheless also include comparisons on VQAv2. To demonstrate that the semantic loss is model-agnostic, we test it on three different standard VQA architectures: [ref]7, is a strong baseline architecture for VQA. It introduced the use of a bottom-up (from pixels to visual objects) visual attention to the standard top-down mechanism. In particular, UpDn uses an object detector ‚Äî R-CNN¬†8 ‚Äî to extract bounding boxes along with dense visual features for each object in the image. Thereby, the question attention is computed over a set of objects rather than over standard grid features as has been done before in the literature. [ref]8 adds a bilinear attention operator on top of the bottom-up top-down mechanism introduced in [ref]7. Moreover, this model allows multi-hop reasoning by stacking multiple bilinear attention layers with residual connections.  is a Transformer-based¬†\nmulti-modal architecture aiming at modeling both the interactions inside one modality (between words or visual objects) and the interactions between the two modalities (between words and objects) using self-attention mechanisms. Like BAN¬†, this architecture contains several stacked self-attention blocks in order to perform complex multi-hop reasoning. We complement our evaluation by showing the complementarity of our method with RUBi¬†, a\nSOTA approach focusing on the reduction of language bias. It consists of a training procedure adding a\nquestion-only branch with a masking mechanism to the base VQA model during the training. The RUBi module adapts the prediction of the base model in order to prevent it from fully exploiting a language-only bias. At test time, the question-only branch is removed. Training details ‚Äî \nWe train all our models during 40 epochs.\nWe use the 6-layers version of MCAN¬†. At the beginning of the training we linearly increase the learning rate from 1‚Äãe‚àí41superscriptùëí41e^{-4} to 2‚Äãe‚àí12superscriptùëí12e^{-1} during 8 epochs, followed by a decay by a factor of 0.20.20.2 at epochs 10 and 20. We set the batch size to 64.\nFor UpDn¬†[ref]7 and BAN¬†[ref]8 we set the batch size to 512 and increase the learning rate from 2‚Äãe‚àí32superscriptùëí32e^{-3} to 2‚Äãe‚àí12superscriptùëí12e^{-1} during the first 8 epochs, followed by a decay by a factor of 0.20.20.2 at epochs 10 and 20. We use the 4-layers implementation of BAN.\nWe use binary cross entropy along with the Adam optimizer¬†9 for MCAN¬† and Adamax¬†9 for BAN¬†[ref]8 and UpDn¬†For the baseline models, we use publicly available implementations at https://github.com/MILVLG/openvqa. All of our experiments are run on two NVIDIA P100 GPUs with half precision training using the apex library.333https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex\nNote that all of our models are trained on the training split only, without the help of any external dataset such as in [ref]8 and .\nWe set the two hyper-parameters Œª=10.0ùúÜ10.0\\lambda=10.0 and k=10ùëò10k=10 using grid search.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: distributions such as VQAv2-CP.
