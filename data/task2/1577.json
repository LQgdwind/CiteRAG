      "content": "Paper Title: Vampire With a Brain Is a Good ITP Hammer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe usability of interactive theorem provers (ITPs) is significantly enhanced by proof automation.\nIn particular, employing so-called hammers , systems that connect the ITP to\nan automatic theorem prover (ATP), may greatly speed up the formalisation process. There are two ingredients of the hammer technology that appear to be best implemented\nusing machine learning, especially while taking advantage of the corresponding large ambient ITP libraries,\nwhich can be used for training. One is the premise selection task,\nin which the system decides on a manageable subset of the most relevant facts from the ITP library\nto be passed to the ATP as axioms along with the current conjecture\n[ref]1    8.\nThe other is the internal guidance of the ATP’s proof search  ,\nwhere a machine-learned component helps to resolve some form of don’t-care non-determinism in the prover algorithm with the aim of speeding up the proof search.\nIn the predominant saturation-based proving paradigm, employed by the leading ATPs such as E , SPASS , or Vampire 3,\ninternal guidance typically focuses on the clause selection choice point  5. ENIGMA  0   is a system\ndelivering internal proof search guidance driven by state-of-the-art machine learning methods to the automatic theorem prover E .\nIn 2019, the authors of ENIGMA announced 1 a 70 %times70percent70\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{\\char 37\\relax} improvement\n(in terms of the number of problems solved under a certain wall clock time limit)\nof E on the Mizar mathematical library (MML) .\nThis was achieved using gradient boosted trees coupled with a clause representation by efficiently extracted manually designed features. In our recent work , we presented an enhancement of the automatic theorem prover Vampire 3\nby a new form of clause selection guidance. The idea is to employ a recursive neural network  and\nto train it to classify clauses based solely on their derivation history. This means we deliberately abstract away the logical content of a clause,\ni.e. “what the clause says”, and only focus on “where the clause is coming from (and how)”. There is a pragmatic appeal in this design decision: evaluating a clause becomes relatively fast compared\nto other approaches based on neural networks (cf., e.g., 5 ).\nIt is also very interesting that such a simple approach works at all,\nlet alone being able to match or even improve on the existing “better informed” methods. We originally developed and evaluated  the architecture in the experimental setting of theory reasoning over the SMT-LIB library.\nIn this paper, we instead explore its utility for improving the performance of Vampire in the role of an ITP hammer,\nfocusing on the well-established Mizar benchmark 2.\nMizar requires the architecture to be adapted to a different set of features, notably a much larger set of background axioms (used instead of theory axioms) and a conjecture.\nWhile we previously  evaluated various modes of integrating the learned guidance and some supporting techniques,\nhere we conduct new experiments that shed light on how the behaviour of the prover changes with varying parameters of the network itself.\nFinally, our evaluation allows for a direct comparison with the ENIGMA work of Jakubův and Urban 1. In the rest of this paper, we first recall (in Sect. 2) how the saturation-based ATP technology can be\nenhanced by internal guidance learnt from previous proofs.\nWe then explain (in Sect. 3)\nhow to construct and train recursive neural networks as successful classifiers of clause derivations.\nWhile there is a certain overlap with our previous work , the new benchmark\nallows for the incorporation of conjecture-related features (Sect. 3.2)\nand we also find room to explain how to efficiently train our networks using parallelisation (Sect. 3.4).\nFinally, we report (in Sect. 4) on an experimental evaluation of our extension of Vampire with the described techniques\nover the Mizar mathematical library.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: is the premise selection task,\nin which the system decides on a manageable subset of the most relevant facts from the ITP library\nto be passed to the ATP as axioms along with the current conjecture\n[ref]1    8.\nThe other is the internal guidance of the ATP’s proof search  ,\nwhere a machine-learned component helps to resolve some form of don’t-care non-determinism in the prover algorithm with\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
