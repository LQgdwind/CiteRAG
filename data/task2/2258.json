      "content": "Paper Title: Explanatory Pluralism in Explainable AI\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor a more comprehensive review of the methods in XAI, I refer the reader to . In this section, I have chosen some representative examples to illustrate the application of my proposed taxonomy in Figure 4. Within the category of Diagnostic-explanation are Saliency Maps , LIME , and Shapley Values  which identify particular input features important to affecting the output of models. The Explication-explanation category focuses on techniques to render explanations or model output understandable to humans interacting with the AI model. Such methods may include refining AI model interfaces with Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) research , Google’s AI Explanations “What-If” tool  to present feature relevance in contrastive terms, or by using the System Causability Scale [ref]17 to measure the extent to which explanations generated were understandable. The Expectation-explanation category includes methods that focus on identifying and building regularities into models 1 2, ensuring robustness against adversarial attacks , and avoiding a pattern of output that potentially biases towards inappropriate features . Interpretable models by virtue of their architectural attributes allow us to form certain expectations. For instance, the Neural Additive Model architecture uses a linear combination of neural networks to compute classification . We can expect that a linear combination will combine each input feature in some weighted additive manner rather than have potentially unexpected interactions between features in high dimensions as deep neural networks typically do. Role-explanation emphasize the social context and embedded nature of AI models. By explicitly including humans in the process of decision-making and training, the consideration of Human-In-The-Loop is three-fold: 1) humans may be required to review AI model decisions to comply with regulatory constraints; 2) humans can augment AI models with expertise and skills that AI models currently do not possess ; and 3) by including humans within each stage of the AI model, we can better ensure that AI objectives are aligned with human values since such systems open themselves up to more flexible alignment with human preferences . Furthermore, risk mitigation protocols, as required for “high-risk” AI systems under the proposal for Harmonized Rules on AI , may identify ways to recover control when the AI system steps outside the boundaries of the role it plays, thereby increasing our trust in the AI system to perform within suitable roles. Finally, the growing body of regulations can help us to clarify what are the roles we envision AI systems can act beneficially within and their associated expectations.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: model interfaces with Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) research , Google’s AI Explanations “What-If” tool  to present feature relevance in contrastive terms, or by using the System Causability Scale [ref]17 to measure the extent to which explanations generated were understandable.
