Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: CPPF: Towards Robust Category-Level 9D Pose Estimation in the Wild\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWang et al. [ref]32 captures 8K real RGB-D frames (4300 for training, 950 for validation and 2750 for testing) of 18 different real scenes (7 for training, 5 for validation, and 6 for testing) using a Structure Sensor. We use the 2750 testing scenes for evaluation. We use the instance segmentation masks from NOCS [ref]32 for a fair comparison. We compare our method with a set of real-world training methods: NOCS [ref]32, CASS , SPD , FS-Net , DualPoseNet [ref]21; and a set of methods requiring synthetic training data only: Chen et al. , Gao et al. [ref]10. The original mAP results reported by Chen et al. [ref]10 uses the IoU matches computed by NOCS [ref]32 which is potentially unfair, we fix this by using the matches computed by Chen et al.’s  method itself. We also augment Gao et al.’s [ref]10 method to additionally regress 3D box scales. NOCS [ref]32, Chen et al. , Gao et al. [ref]10 and DualPoseNet [ref]21’s results are given by running the official code provided by the authors, while the others are borrowed from the original papers. Notice that DualPoseNet [ref]21 uses its own instance segmentation masks other than those provided by NOCS, which may result in a higher mAP than the actual. The results are given in Table 1. We see that our method achieves an mAP of 16.9, 44.9 and 50.8 for (5∘, 5 cm), (10∘, 5 cm) and (15∘, 5 cm) respectively. It outperforms the best sim-to-real baseline by 9.1, 27.8 and 24.3, which is a quite large margin. Our method is also comparable to those methods that are trained on real-world pose annotations. More detailed analysis and comparison is illustrated in Figure 6. Some qualitative comparisons are given in Figure 7. This experiment shows that our proposed method generalize well to real-world data with only synthetic training data.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: Wang et al. [ref]32 captures 8K real RGB-D frames (4300 for training, 950 for validation and 2750 for testing) of 18 different real scenes (7 for training, 5 for validation, and 6 for testing) using a Structure\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
