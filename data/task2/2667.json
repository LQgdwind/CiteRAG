      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Selective Communication for Multi-Agent Path Finding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRL-based planners generally formulate MAPF as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem to learn decentralized policies for agents (robots). Compared with centralized planning methods, learning decentralized polices scales well to a large number of agents. Collision free policies are usually learned by guiding RL with constraints or demonstration data  [ref]9 [ref]10 [ref]12. Incorporating demonstration guidance with RL can be divided into two categories, using demonstrations generated by a centralized planner, or by a single-agent planner. For instance, a well known framework named PRIMAL [ref]9 builds on the asynchronous advantage actor critic (A3C) network  as its RL part and uses behaviour cloning to supervise the training of RL. So it requires demonstrations generated by a centralized planner named ODrM* . The limitation of using a centralized planner is that it requires solving a MAPF problem and is thus time-consuming, especially in a complex environment with a large number of agents. For methods using single-agent planner as guidance, MAPPER [ref]12 and Globally Guided RL (G2RL) [ref]10 use A* search for single-agent path generation and apply an off-route penalty if agents fail to follow the path. The potential issue is that, as single-agent shortest paths are usually not unique and not globally optimal for multi-agent environment, forcing agents to follow these paths by extra shaped rewards can mislead agents. To tackle the above issues, our previous method DHC  does not require a centralized planner. Although single-agent shortest paths are still adopted as guidance, DHC embeds all the potential choices of shortest paths as heuristic into the input of the model, instead of forcing agents to follow a specific path. Thus, no special shaped rewards are required. Even though empirical results have shown that enhancing RL with guidance can help to learn collision free policies for MAPF, the cooperation among agents is not directly modeled. Communication via graph convolution is a promising way to achieve multi-agent cooperation, where an agent aggregates information from its neighbors, including itself, and makes decisions based on this augmented information   . This idea is recently deployed for MAPF. By treating each agent in the environment as a node and connecting neighboring nodes (agents) if they are inside the FOV of each other, a graph is formulated by DHC and multi-head dot-product attention  serves as the convolutional kernel to compute interactions among agents. Similar ideas are applied by the work described in  and Message-Aware Graph Attention neTwork (MAGAT) , where the communication part is a graph neural network (GNN) . However, it is worth noting that both  and  are IL-based methods, which train the model to imitate the demonstrations generated by Conflict-Based Search (CBS)  and Enhanced CBS , respectively. Thus, MAPF instances still need to be pre-solved while extreme scenarios may fail to be solved and collected into the training data. Also, none of these communication based methods consider the efficiency of communication, resulting in high communication overhead and latency.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: planning methods, learning decentralized polices scales well to a large number of agents.
