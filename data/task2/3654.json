      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Few-Shot Object Detection via Knowledge Inheritance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExisting approaches in FSOD mainly follow two principles, i.e., meta-learning and transfer learning (a.k.a. finetuning). Meta-Learning.\n enhances information interaction by introducing the attention-RPN and multi-relation module.\n introduces consistency regularization on predictions from various transformed images to improve the generalization ability over perturbed images.\n proposes a support-query mutual guidance mechanism and a hybrid loss to enhance the discrimination ability on unseen classes.\n resorts to heterogeneous graph convolutional networks to achieve efficient message passing among all the query image regions (usually proposals) and novel class nodes.\nHowever, distinct from our adopted generalized FSOD¬†[ref]15 setting, the above methods follow the transferred FSOD setting, where they evaluate the few-shot detector merely on novel classes.\nIn the generalized FSOD,  proposes to adaptively adjust the channel-wise importance of the final global feature maps according to different novel tasks, whereas  focuses on the intermediate instance-level feature adaptation. More recently,  proposes a feature aggregation module to effectively combine support and query features in the late stage.\n proposes to optimize both feature space partition and novel class reconstruction by a class margin equilibrium approach.\n proposes a dense relation distillation module and an adapative context-aware feature aggregation module to exploit support information, global and local features to assist few-shot detection on novel classes.\nThese methods, though adopt the generalized FSOD setting, in fact focus solely on the generalization performance to novel classes, while lacking the consideration for preventing catastrophic forgetting. As a common problem in the meta-learning principle, all the above methods, regardless of the evaluation settings, suffer from severe efficiency issues. First, an extra support branch substantially increases the computational overheads. Even worse, the interaction module between the support and query branches further increases the overheads by NùëÅN times under NùëÅN-way setting. This makes the above methods impractical when it comes to the benchmark with large numbers of classes, such as LVIS. Transfer learning.\n[ref]10 leverages contextual information to tackle the object confusion problem with transformer¬† structure.\n proposes to add positive samples of different scales as input to handle the scale variation problem.\n[ref]15 proposes a simple two-phase framework (TFA) without auxiliary components, which, however, takes a long journey to converge due to their inappropriate adaptation strategies.\n leverages the semantic relation between base and novel classes and introduces explicit relation reasoning into the learning of novel object detection.\n proposes to increase the data variance for novel classes by transferring the shared within-class variation from base classes.\n[ref]39 introduces a few-shot classification refinement mechanism to enhance classification capability along with retreatment solutions to combat distractor samples due to incomplete annotations.\n enhances object features with intrinsical characteristics that are universal across different object categories to increase model generalization ability.\n constructs a discriminative feature space for each novel class by asscociation and discrimination.\nRecently,  proposes a contrastive proposal encoding loss to alleviate the misclassification issues by promoting instance level intra-class compactness and interclass variance.\n introduces gradient decoupled layer for multi-stage decoupling\nand prototypical calibration block for multi-task decoupling.\nInstead of introducing additional modules¬†[ref]10    [ref]39  or loss terms¬†[ref]39    that increases the computational complexity on few-shot transfer or even inference as well, we propose an efficient yet effective pretrain-transfer framework without any additional components, upon which we build the KI initializer with adaptive length re-scaling mechanism to claim the new SOTA performance with surprisingly fast adaptation.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: graph convolutional networks to achieve efficient message passing among all the query image regions (usually proposals) and novel class nodes.\nHowever, distinct from our adopted generalized FSOD¬†[ref]15 setting, the above methods follow the transferred FSOD setting, where they evaluate the few-shot detector merely on novel classes.\nIn the generalized FSOD,  proposes to adaptively adjust the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
