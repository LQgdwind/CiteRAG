      "content": "Paper Title: Dataset Distillation Meets Provable Subset Selection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning has advanced at an extraordinary rate in the previous decade, becoming the first option in many fields. This advancement is attributed to constantly increasing computational resources that stimulate cutting-edge algorithms to cope with large amounts of data. However, dealing with the infinite expansion of data under a constraint of limited computing power has been increasingly difficult [ref]36, especially during the training phase, where training a single deep learning model could last for weeks or even months. To that end, subset selection [ref]32 [ref]21 and dataset distillation  [ref]36 methods have been proposed to speed up the training process. Subset selection. The idea is to select a representative subset from the entire data  , before each training epoch, followed by training the model on that subset. However, these methods fall short when such a subset is computed once for the entire training procedure. Dataset distillation. More recent approaches focused on creating a small synthetic dataset (not necessarily a subset) such that training the model on this small data will approximate the training process on the entire big data. This technique is known as dataset distillation   and it has been gaining great interest in recent years. Notably, these synthetic datasets offer the advantage of employing continuous gradient-based optimization procedures rather than geometrical and combinatorial approaches and are not restricted to the collection of inputs and labels provided by the dataset, resulting in increased flexibility and better performance in practice. Usually, dataset distillation methods start by initializing at random a synthetic dataset or by sampling uniformly a subset from the input data. Then, learning the small synthetic data is done iteratively by sampling batches uniformly at random from the entire data and minimizing a distillation objective, which depends on the algorithm, for example, matching gradients with respect to the data and the loss function used by the model [ref]21, using the neural tangent kernel of the model , using a teacher/student model mechanism , or using neural network Gaussian process techniques .\nHence, dataset distillation, irrespective of the method used, includes the initialization step and the learning step. Then, the learning step itself can be viewed as a process of two functions: The first function squeezes the (current) information to be learned from the whole data set (in previous approaches, this corresponds to the random sampling at each iteration). The second function injects the extracted information into the synthetic samples (this is the learning process). Thus, most data distillation methods rely heavily on uniform sampling in both the initialization step and in learning, where squeezing is performed by sampling random batches of real data. To this end, we raise the following questions regarding the effectiveness of the uniform sampling and provide the intuition behind them: (1) Is uniform sampling sufficient for dataset distillation initialization?\nIn general, initialization has a crucial role in determining convergence of the training process of deep learning model . We argue that the initialization of distillation is as important as model initializing for training, and has a similar effect on the convergence and final solution. While each instance is equally important from the point of view of the uniform sampler, the reality of such a matter is far from this, namely, some subsets are more informative than others. Using subset selection with theoretical guarantees for initializing the distilled set offers both practical and theoretical benefits: a) the learning starts from a better solution that is closer to a robust local minimum; b) the training process can only further improve the guarantees associated with the initial subset. (2) Should we apply uniform sampling in the squeezing part at each iteration? As the learning process proceeds, more and more information from different data points is captured in the distilled set. Thus, the loss of the learning process with respect to these points gets lower and lower, and consequently, the gradients with respect to these points (specifically toward the end of the learning process) get lower as well. Eventually, uniform sampling creates a batch full of “small norm” gradients with very few samples affecting the gradient mean. This causes lower diversity of high gradient samples. To resolve this issue we suggest replacing uniform samples with “important” examples – those that the distillation process has not yet encapsulated. In summary, we can obtain better distillation results by sampling a meaningful subset of points at each iteration and learning the synthetic data with respect to them.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: cutting-edge algorithms to cope with large amounts of data.
