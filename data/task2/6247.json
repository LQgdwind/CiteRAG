From the reported top-1 test accuracy in Table¬†3, our PrimalFormer shows better accuracy while achieves top efficiency (see Table¬†4) than several efficient self-attention counterparts including Reformer, Performer and Linformer.\nNotably, our model Primal.++Trans.¬†achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.4%percent60.460.4\\%, which is 1.6%percent1.61.6\\% higher than Transformer, and 1.2%percent1.21.2\\% higher than the currently best YOSO-E, showing that the deployed Primal-Attention is able to boost the performance upon canonical Transformer distinctively.\nOn top of it, Primal.++Trans.¬†has distinctively higher efficiency and require much less memory than the canonical Transformer as in Table¬†4, and our Primal.¬†outperforms all compared variants of efficient Transformer.\nCompared to Table 1 with simpler data, Primal.++Trans.¬†further achieves performance gain over PrimalFormer.\nThe reason can be that the shallower (the first) layer needs more model capacity for depicting the data patterns in the learning, while the deep (the second) layer captures less detailed features and is regularized with more informative feature learning through our Primal-Attention.\nThe efficiency of our Primal-Attention are further pronounced with longer sequences than that of the UEA benchmark in Table 2.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: Long-Range Arena (LRA)¬†[ref]39 is a benchmark for the long-sequence scenarios, including equation calculation (ListOps)¬†, review classification (Text)¬†, document retrieval (Retrieval)¬†, image classification (Image)¬† and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
