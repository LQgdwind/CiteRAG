      "content": "Paper Title: Primal-Attention: Self-attention through Asymmetric Kernel SVD in Primal Representation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTransformers [ref]1 have become ubiquitous nowadays with state-of-the-art results in various tasks, such as natural language processing [ref]2 [ref]3 , computer vision    , reinforcement learning   , etc.\nIn the remarkable success of Transformers, the self-attention blocks play a key role, where the complicated dependencies between the individuals in data sequences can be depicted by using the established queries, keys, and values.\nDespite the prevailing advantages,\ntheoretical understandings towards Transformers seem yet lagged behind its unprecedented empirical performance. Recently, the kernel-based perspective has been proposed\nwhere the dot-product attention operation is shown as a kernel matrix .\nThis finding is quite encouraging by bridging kernels  with Transformers, as kernel methods have long been well studied with good interpretation ability.\nFollowing this spirit, different works have been proposed subsequently to improve self-attention, e.g.,      .\nHowever, in these works, the applied kernel techniques rely on Mercer kernels  requesting symmetry, which is inconsistent with the\nintrinsically asymmetric setups of self-attention.\nIn , it analytically characterizes the attention by asymmetric kernels based on Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces (RKBS) .\nNonetheless, neither the asymmetry property nor the related optimization is utilized for improvements.\nIn , self-attention is derived with a primal-dual representation from the support vector regression, which still adopts the technique for Mercer kernels.\nMoreover, in the cast supervised task, the assumed ground-truth outputs of self-attention are practically non-existent, making it difficult to be applied in the optimization. In this work, we provide a novel perspective to interpret self-attention with a primal-dual representation based on asymmetric Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD), which fills\nthe gap of dismissing the asymmetry between theory and implementation.\nSpecifically, in this unsupervised setup, we propose to remodel self-attention in the primal representation, namely, Primal-Attention, and to optimize it accordingly.\nOur method is driven by two major motivations.\nFirstly,\nwe observe that attention matrices in Transformers can be\nlow-rank, as shown in Figure 1(d), and this property becomes more significant towards deeper network layers.\nSecondly, the self-attention matrix is intrinsically an asymmetric kernel matrix  .\nTo this end, we propose KSVD for self-attention, which takes both low-rank and asymmetric properties into consideration.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a primal-dual representation for the asymmetric self-attention and applies it to modelling and optimization.\nThe contributions of this work are summarized as follows: We characterize self-attention by KSVD with asymmetric kernels. Different from existing works employing symmetric kernel-based methods, we take asymmetry into account so as to be more consistent with the real setups in self-attention. (Section 2) We derive a primal-dual representation for self-attention through KSVD, and propose a novel attention in the primal, named Primal-Attention, avoiding the expensive kernel computation in the dual.\nWith KSVD, the values are interpreted as the projection weights that yield maximal variances of features, and the low-rank property can be\npursued by confining the projection numbers.\n(Section 3, Section 4) We prove that the stationary solution to the derived KSVD leads to a zero-value objective\nof the unconstrained primal problem.\nTherefore, the optimization of KSVD in Primal-Attention can be efficiently implemented by minimizing a regularization term added to the loss, with no need of extra decomposition operations.\n(Section 4) In numerical experiments, Primal-Attention achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets together with efficiency advantages over the canonical self-attention.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that our deployed optimization from KSVD can regularize the attention with a sharper singular value decay, hence promoting learning more low-rank features, which is shown in Figure 1.
