      "content": "Paper Title: CLIPN for Zero-Shot OOD Detection: Teaching CLIP to Say No\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning models   have demonstrated excellent versatility and performance when the classes in the training and test datasets remain the same . This is facilitated by the fact that the models are trained under completely closed-world conditions, meaning all encountered classes are in-distribution (ID) ones . Nevertheless, these models tend to suffer from poor generalization and undesirable performance when deployed in real-world applications. This frustrating phenomenon is partially attributed to the existence of an enormous number of unknown classes distributed in the real world, which is challenging to detect as they have not been explicitly seen during the training stage. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection task    has been raised and promptly attracted considerable interest from researchers. Briefly, the OOD detection task aims to empower the model to distinguish if the input images come from unknown classes.\nOne of the mainstream OOD detection methods is to learn ID-specific features and classifiers, then develop the scoring function [ref]42  to metric how closely the input data matches the ID classes, which is measured by ID-ness [ref]42 (or OOD-ness, an opposite case).\nFor instance, MSP , MaxLogit [ref]13, energy-based 7 and gradient-based 5 have been extensively employed to measure the ID-ness.\nBetter ID-ness brings better OOD results.\nIn summary, the key idea of these methods is to teach ID knowledge to the model and then detect the dis-matched cases referring to the model’s reply (score).\nThe effectiveness of the above methods is seriously compromised by the following cases.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1, the green stars represent some OOD samples that are easy to distinguish, as they are relatively distant from all ID classes and naturally have high entropy, uniform probability , low logit [ref]13 or low energy 7.\nConversely, hard-to-distinguish OOD samples (brown stars in Fig. 1) are more common and challenging.\nThese samples are located relatively close to a certain ID class while being far away from other classes, resulting in high ID-ness. Therefore, existing methods such as those mentioned above fail to identify such samples accurately.\nAs results shown in Fig. 5, even when we apply MSP  with different thresholding, there are still numerous mis-classified OOD samples, which are located in close proximity to ID classes. Recently, some methods have sought to address the issue of hard-to-distinguish OOD samples by leveraging generalizable representations learned by CLIP , an open-world language-vision model trained on datasets with enormous volumes, such as Laion-2B 6.\nNaturally, this task extends to zero-shot OOD detection (ZS OOD detection) [ref]8 0, which employs language-vision models to detect OOD data without requiring training on the ID dataset.\nZOC [ref]8 uses an additional text encoder to generate some candidate OOD classes not included in ID classes.\nUnfortunately, it is inflexible and unreliable when faced with a dataset containing a large number of ID classes, rendering it challenging to scale for large datasets such as ImageNet-1K 0.\nMCM 0 leverages the text encoder component of CLIP and ID class prompts to obtain a more representative and informative ID classifier, which in turn enhances the accuracy of ID-ness estimates. However, this method still neglects to address the challenge of dealing with hard-to-distinguish OOD samples and suffers from limited performance; see results in Table 1. Different from ZOC [ref]8 and MCM 0, we attempt to exploit the open-world knowledge in CLIP to straightly identify some hard-to-distinguish OOD samples even if their ID-ness is high.\nAs the toy example shown in Figure. 2 (a), given a dog image and a cat image, we design four groups of prompts. Two groups contain class prompts with/of/…/having the photos of the dog or cat, while the other two groups use “no” prompts: a photo without/not of/…/not having the dog or cat.\nWe conducted an experiment on CLIP to match the images with four prompts. Unfortunately, the results show that CLIP fails to accurately match the images, implying that it lacks “no” logic; as illustrated in the toy visualization in Fig. 2 (b) and qualitative visualization in Fig. 6. To empower “no” logic within CLIP, we propose a new CLIP architecture, called CLIP saying “no” (CLIPN).\nIt upgrades CLIP in terms of OOD detection in three ways.\n(1) Architecture. New “no” prompts and a “no” text encoder are added to CLIP. Our novel learnable “no” prompts integrate negation semantics within prompts, complementing the original CLIP’s prompts.\nMoreover, our “no” text encoder captures the corresponding negation semantics of images, making the CLIP saying “no” possible.\n(2) Training Loss. We further propose two loss functions. The first is image-text binary-opposite loss, which makes an image feature match with correct “no” prompt features. In other words, it can teach CLIP when to say “no”. The second is text semantic-opposite loss which makes the standard prompt and “no” prompts be embedded far away from each other. In other words, it can teach CLIP to understand the meaning of “no” prompts.\n(3) Threshold-free Inference Algorithms. After the training of CLIPN, we design two threshold-free algorithms: competing-to-win and agreeing-to-differ. The goal of competing-to-win is to select the most confident probability from\nstandard and “no” text encoders as the final prediction. While agreeing-to-differ generates an additional probability for the OOD class by considering predictions from both standard and “no” text encoders.\nExperimental results on 9 benchmark datasets (3 ID and 6 OOD datasets) showed that our CLIPN outperforms existing methods.\nIn summary, our contributions are Four-fold. We propose a novel CLIP architecture, named CLIPN, which equips CLIP with a “no” logic via the learnable “no” prompts and a “no” text encoder. We propose the image-text binary-opposite loss and text semantic-opposite loss, which teach CLIPN to match images with “no” prompts, thus learning to identify unknown samples. We propose two novel threshold-free inference algorithms (competing-to-win and agreeing-to-differ) to perform OOD detection via using negation semantics. Experimental results show that our CLIPN outperforms most existing OOD detection algorithms on both large-scale and small-scale OOD detection tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: model to distinguish if the input images come from unknown classes.\nOne of the mainstream OOD detection methods is to learn ID-specific features and classifiers, then develop the scoring function [ref]42  to metric how closely the input data matches the ID classes, which is measured by ID-ness [ref]42 (or OOD-ness, an opposite case).\nFor instance, MSP , MaxLogit [ref]13, energy-based 7 and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
