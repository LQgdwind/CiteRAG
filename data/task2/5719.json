      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Transformer GANs for Graph-Constrained House Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe only illustrate the details of our contributions on the house layout generation task for simplicity. The extension of the proposed contributions to house roof generation is straightforward.\nTake house layout generation in Figure 1 as an example. The generator G𝐺G receives a noise vector for each room and a bubble diagram as inputs. It then generates a house layout, where each room is represented as an axis-aligned rectangle.\nWe represent each bubble diagram as a graph, where each node represents a room of a certain type, and each edge represents the spatial adjacency.\nSpecifically, we generate a rectangle for each room, where two rooms with a graph edge should be spatially adjacent, while two rooms without an edge should be spatially dis-adjacent. Input Graph Representation.\nGiven a bubble diagram, we first generate a node for each room and initialize it with a 128128128-d noise vector sampled from a normal distribution.\nWe then concatenate the noise vector with a 101010-d room type vector tr→→subscript𝑡𝑟\\overrightarrow{t_{r}} (r𝑟r is a room index), encoded in the one-hot format.\nTherefore, we can obtain a 138138138-d vector gr→→subscript𝑔𝑟\\overrightarrow{g_{r}} to represent the input bubble diagram as follows, Note that, different from the highly successful ViT , we use graph nodes as the input of the proposed graph Transformer instead of using image patches, which makes our framework very different. Convolutional Message Passing Neural Network.\nAs indicated in HouseGAN , Conv-MPN stores feature as a 3D tensor in the output design space.\nWe thus apply a shared linear layer to expand gr→→subscript𝑔𝑟\\overrightarrow{g_{r}} into a feature volume 𝐠rl=1superscriptsubscript𝐠𝑟𝑙1{\\rm\\bf{g}}_{r}^{l=1} of size 16×8×8168816{\\times}8{\\times}8, where l=1𝑙1l{=}1 is the feature extracted from the first Conv-MPN layer, which will be upsampled twice using a transposed convolution\nto become a feature volume 𝐠rl=3superscriptsubscript𝐠𝑟𝑙3{\\rm\\bf{g}}_{r}^{l=3} of size 16×32×3216323216{\\times}32{\\times}32. The Conv-MPN layer updates a graph of room-wise feature volumes via a convolutional message passing [ref]49.\nSpecifically, we update 𝐠rl=1superscriptsubscript𝐠𝑟𝑙1{\\rm\\bf{g}}_{r}^{l=1} over the following steps:\n1) We use a GTE to capture the long-range correlations across rooms that are connected in the input graph;\n2) We employ another GTE to capture the long-range dependencies across non-connected rooms in the input graph;\n3) We concatenate a sum-pooled feature across connected rooms in the input graph;\n4) We concatenate a sum-pooled feature across non-connected rooms;\nand\n5) We apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the combined feature.\nThis process can be formulated as follows, where N​(r)N𝑟{\\rm{N}}(r) and N¯​(r)¯N𝑟{\\rm\\overline{N}}(r) denote sets of rooms that are connected and not-connected, respectively;\n“+” and “;” denote pixel-wise addition and channel-wise concatenation, respectively.\nWe also explore two more variations (Eq. (3) and (4)) to validate the effectiveness of Eq. (2) as follows, Node Attentions in Graph Transformer Encoder.\nTo capture local and global relationships across graph nodes, we propose a novel GTE, as shown in Figure 2.\nGTE combines self-attention in Transformer and graph convolution networks to capture global and local correlations, respectively.\nNote that we do not use position embeddings in our framework since our goal is to generate node positions in the generated house layout. The proposed GTE is quite different from the one presented in ViT  since the two input modalities are different, i.e., images and graph nodes.\nThus, we extend the multi-head self-attention in  to the multi-head node attention, which aims to capture the global correlations across connected rooms/nodes and the global dependencies across non-connected rooms/nodes.\nTo this end, we propose two novel graph node attention modules, i.e., connected node attention (CNA) and non-connected node attention (NNA).\nBoth CNA and NNA share the same network structure. The goal of CNA (see Figure 2) is to model the global correlations across connected rooms.\nSpecifically, we perform a matrix multiplication between the transpose of Pools∈N​(r)​𝐠sl𝑠N𝑟Poolsuperscriptsubscript𝐠sl\\underset{s\\in{\\rm N}(r)}{\\rm Pool}{\\rm\\bf{g}}_{s}^{l} and 𝐠rlsuperscriptsubscript𝐠𝑟𝑙{\\rm\\bf{g}}_{r}^{l}, and apply a Softmax function to calculate the connected node attention map AttN​(r)N𝑟Att\\underset{{\\rm N}(r)}{\\rm Att}, where c​a​r​d​(N​(r))𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑁𝑟card(N(r)) is the number of connected graph nodes in a training batch.\nThe connected node attention map AttN​(r)N𝑟Att\\underset{{\\rm N}(r)}{\\rm Att} measures the connected node’s impact on other connected nodes.\nThen we perform matrix multiplication between 𝐠rlsuperscriptsubscript𝐠𝑟𝑙{\\rm\\bf{g}}_{r}^{l} and the transpose of AttN​(r)N𝑟Att\\underset{{\\rm N}(r)}{\\rm Att}.\nLastly, we multiply the result by a scaling parameter α𝛼\\alpha to obtain the output, where α𝛼\\alpha is a learnable parameter, initialized to 0, and learned by the model [ref]50.\nBy doing so, each connected node in N​(r)N𝑟{\\rm N}(r) is a weighted sum of all the connected nodes.\nThus, CNA obtains a global view of the spatial graph structure and can selectively adjust rooms according to the connected attention map, improving the house layout’s representations and high-level semantic consistency. Similarly, the goal of NNA is to capture global relations across non-connected rooms.\nSpecifically, we perform a matrix multiplication between the transpose of Pools∈N¯​(r)​𝐠sl𝑠¯N𝑟Poolsuperscriptsubscript𝐠sl\\underset{s\\in{\\rm\\overline{N}}(r)}{\\rm Pool}{\\rm\\bf{g}}_{s}^{l} and 𝐠rlsuperscriptsubscript𝐠𝑟𝑙{\\rm\\bf{g}}_{r}^{l}, and apply a Softmax function to calculate the non-connected node attention map AttN¯​(r)¯N𝑟Att\\underset{{\\rm\\overline{N}}(r)}{\\rm Att}: where c​a​r​d​(N¯​(r))𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑑¯𝑁𝑟card(\\overline{N}(r)) is the number of non-connected graph nodes in a training batch.\nThe non-connected node attention map AttN¯​(r)¯N𝑟Att\\underset{{\\rm\\overline{N}}(r)}{\\rm Att} measures the non-connected node’s impact on other non-connected nodes.\nThen we perform matrix multiplication between 𝐠rlsuperscriptsubscript𝐠𝑟𝑙{\\rm\\bf{g}}_{r}^{l} and the transpose of AttN¯​(r)¯N𝑟Att\\underset{{\\rm\\overline{N}}(r)}{\\rm Att}.\nLastly, we multiply the result by a scale parameter β𝛽\\beta to obtain the output as follows, where β𝛽\\beta gradually learns weights from 0 [ref]50.\nBy doing so, each non-connected node in N¯​(r)¯N𝑟{\\rm\\overline{N}}(r) is a weighted sum of all the non-connected nodes.\nFinally, we perform an element-wise sum with 𝐠rlsuperscriptsubscript𝐠𝑟𝑙{\\rm\\bf{g}}_{r}^{l} so that the updated node feature can capture both connected and non-connected spatial relations.\nThis process can be expressed as follows, Graph Modeling in Graph Transformer Encoder.\nWhile CNA and NNA are useful for extracting long-range and global dependencies, it is less efficient at capturing fine-grained local information in complex house data structures. To fix this limitation, we propose a novel graph modeling block, as shown in Figure 2. Specifically, given the features 𝐠rlsuperscriptsubscript𝐠𝑟𝑙{\\rm\\bf{g}}_{r}^{l} generated in Eq. (9), we further improve the local correlations by using graph convolutional networks as follows, where A𝐴A denotes the adjacency matrix of a graph, GC​(⋅)GC⋅{\\rm GC}(\\cdot) represents graph convolution, and P𝑃P the trainable parameters.\nσ​(⋅)𝜎⋅\\sigma(\\cdot) is the gaussian error linear unit (GeLU) proposed in [ref]13 activation function that aims to provide the network non-linearity.\nWe follow the structure design in GraphCMR  to build our graph modeling block, which can explicitly encode the graph-constrained house structure within the network and thereby improve spatial locality in the feature representations. Generation Head.\nWe adopt three CNN layers to convert a feature volume into a room segmentation mask of size 1×32×32132321{\\times}32{\\times}32.\nThe numbers of convolutional channels are 256, 128, and 1, respectively.\nWe pass the graph of segmentation masks to the proposed discriminator D𝐷D during the training stage.\nFinally, we fit the tightest axis-aligned rectangle for each room to generate the house layout.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: 𝐠rl=3superscriptsubscript𝐠𝑟𝑙3{\\rm\\bf{g}}_{r}^{l=3} of size 16×32×3216323216{\\times}32{\\times}32. The Conv-MPN layer updates a graph of room-wise feature volumes via a convolutional message passing [ref]49.\nSpecifically, we update 𝐠rl=1superscriptsubscript𝐠𝑟𝑙1{\\rm\\bf{g}}_{r}^{l=1} over the following steps:\n1) We use a GTE to capture the long-range correlations across rooms that are connected in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
