      "content": "Paper Title: Displacement-Driven Approach to Nonlocal Elasticity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we analyze the effect of different kernels and different boundary conditions on the static bending response of the nonlocal plate. In all the simulations, we considered an isotropic plate with material properties identical to the nonlocal beam in §7.1. The in-plane dimensions of the plate were chosen as Lp=Bp=1subscript𝐿𝑝subscript𝐵𝑝1L_{p}=B_{p}=1m, and thickness was chosen as hp=Lp/10subscriptℎ𝑝subscript𝐿𝑝10h_{p}=L_{p}/10. We considered the effect of the exponential kernel and the power-law kernel, similar to the analysis conducted for the nonlocal beam. In each case, we have assumed an isotropic and symmetric horizon of nonlocality such that l−j=l+j=lfsubscript𝑙subscript𝑗subscript𝑙subscript𝑗subscript𝑙𝑓l_{-_{j}}=l_{+_{j}}=l_{f} for points sufficiently far from the boundaries. We analyzed the static response of the plate subject to a uniformly distributed transverse load (UDTL) for two different kinds of boundary conditions: (a) the plate clamped at all the edges, and (b) the plate simply-supported at all its edges, for different combinations of the kernel parameters.\nThe constraints on the generalized displacement coordinates corresponding to these boundary conditions are as follows : For each boundary condition, we obtained the response of the plate for the following different kernel parameters: Exponential kernel: the kernel parameter l0subscript𝑙0l_{0} was varied in (0,0.005]​m(=(0,Lp/200])annotated00.005mabsent0subscript𝐿𝑝200(0,0.005]\\text{m}~{}(=(0,L_{p}/200]) and the nonlocal horizon parameter lfsubscript𝑙𝑓l_{f} was varied in [0.5,1]​m(=[Lp/2,Lp])annotated0.51mabsentsubscript𝐿𝑝2subscript𝐿𝑝[0.5,1]\\text{m}~{}(=[L_{p}/2,L_{p}]). The lowest value for l0subscript𝑙0l_{0} was chosen as l0=10−6subscript𝑙0superscript106l_{0}=10^{-6} instead of zero. This is because the choice of l0=0subscript𝑙00l_{0}=0 leads to a singularity within the exponential kernel, wherein the exponential kernel reduces to a Dirac-delta operator . Power-law kernel: the nonlocal horizon parameter lfsubscript𝑙𝑓l_{f} was varied in [0.5,1]​m(=[Lp/2,Lp])annotated0.51mabsentsubscript𝐿𝑝2subscript𝐿𝑝[0.5,1]\\text{m}~{}(=[L_{p}/2,L_{p}]) and the kernel parameter α𝛼\\alpha, also called as the fractional-order , was varied in [0.7,1]0.71[0.7,1]. Similar to the nonlocal beam, there exists a constraint on the lower limit of α𝛼\\alpha (=0.40.40.4 for the nonlocal plate), while the value of lfsubscript𝑙𝑓l_{f} can approach to zero [ref]51. The numerical results, in terms of the maximum transverse displacement obtained at the mid-point of the plate, are presented in Fig. (6) and Fig. (7) for the exponential and the power-law kernel, respectively. Analogous to the nonlocal beam, the transverse displacement of the mid-point of the nonlocal plate is non-dimensionalized against the analogous value obtained for a local Mindlin plate. As evident from the results, the same considerations noted for the nonlocal Timoshenko beam directly extend to the nonlocal Mindlin plate.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: Similar to the nonlocal beam, there exists a constraint on the lower limit of α𝛼\\alpha (=0.40.40.4 for the nonlocal plate), while the value of lfsubscript𝑙𝑓l_{f} can approach to zero [ref]51.
