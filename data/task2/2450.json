      "content": "Paper Title: Clustering by Maximizing Mutual Information Across Views\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDespite many recent successes in learning representations, the idea\nof contrastive learning appeared long time ago. In 2006, Hadsell et.\nal. 5 proposed a max-margin contrastive\nloss and linked it to a mechanical spring system. In fact, from a\nprobabilistic view, contrastive learning arises naturally when working\nwith energy-based models. For example, in many problems, we want to\nmaximize log⁡p​(y|x)=log⁡ef(y,x))∑y′∈𝒴ef​(y′,x)\\log p(y|x)=\\log\\frac{e^{f(y,x))}}{\\sum_{y^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{Y}}e^{f(y^{\\prime},x)}}\nwhere y𝑦y is the output associated with a context x𝑥x and 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y}\nis the set of all possible outputs or vocab. This is roughly equivalent\nto maximizing f​(y,x)𝑓𝑦𝑥f(y,x) and minimizing f​(y′,x)𝑓superscript𝑦′𝑥f(y^{\\prime},x) for all y′≠ysuperscript𝑦′𝑦y^{\\prime}\\neq y\nbut in a normalized setting. However, in practice, the size of 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y}\nis usually very large, making the computation of p​(y|x)𝑝conditional𝑦𝑥p(y|x) expensive.\nThis problem was addressed in [ref]32 2\nby using Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) \nto approximate p​(y|x)𝑝conditional𝑦𝑥p(y|x). The basic idea of NCE is to transform the\ndensity estimation problem into a binary classification problem: “Whether\nsamples are drawn from the data distribution or from a known noise\ndistribution?”. Based on NCE, Mikolov et. al. \nand Oord et. al.  derived a simpler\ncontrastive loss which later was referred to as the InfoNCE loss \nand was adopted by many subsequent works      \nfor learning representations. Recently, there have been several attempts to leverage inter-sample\nstatistics obtained from clustering to improve representation learning\non a large scale   .\nPCL  alternates between clustering data\nvia K-means and contrasting samples based on their views and their\nassigned cluster centroids (or prototypes). SwAV \ndoes not contrast two sample views directly but uses one view to predict\nthe code of assigning the other view to a set of learnable prototypes.\nInterCLR 4 and ODC 1 avoid\noffline clustering on the entire training dataset after each epoch\nby storing a pseudo-label for every sample in the memory bank (along\nwith the feature vector) and maintaining a set of cluster centroids.\nThese pseudo-labels and cluster centroids are updated on-the-fly at\neach step via mini-batch K-means.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: y\nbut in a normalized setting. However, in practice, the size of 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y}\nis usually very large, making the computation of p​(y|x)𝑝conditional𝑦𝑥p(y|x) expensive.\nThis problem was addressed in [ref]32 2\nby using Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) \nto approximate p​(y|x)𝑝conditional𝑦𝑥p(y|x). The basic idea of NCE is to transform the\ndensity estimation problem into a binary classification\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
