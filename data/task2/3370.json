      "content": "Paper Title: Conditional entropy minimization principle for learning domain invariant representation features\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA fundamental assumption in most statistical machine learning algorithms is that the training data and the test data are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d). However, it is usually violated in practice due to a phenomenon often referred to as the domain distribution shift where the training domain and the test domain distributions are not the same. This leads to an increased risk/error of the trained classifier on the test domain. Mitigating this issue is the subject of the area broadly referred to as Domain Generalization (DG). Over the past decade, many methods have been proposed for DG, under different settings  . Among these, Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM)   has emerged as one of the promising methods. IRM is constructed based on a widely accepted assumption that the representations are general and transferable if the feature representations remain invariant from domain to domain. However, this approach is shown to fail in some simple settings where spurious invariant features exist [ref]2   . A particular example is the problem of classifying cow and camel images   where the label is a deterministic function of the invariant features, for example, the shape of animals, and does not depend on the spurious features such as the background. However, because cows usually appear in a picture with a greenfield while the camels live in a desert with a yellow background, the background color could be incorrectly learned as a spurious invariant feature. This can lead to classification errors, for example, if the cow is placed in a yellow field, then it may be misclassified as a camel. Therefore, even though an invariance-principle-based approach can learn invariant features, it may still fail in a classification task if the extracted features contain not only the true invariant features but also spurious invariant features. These spurious features could be eliminated if one can observe a sufficiently large number of domains  [ref]2. For example, if the seen domain contains a picture of a cow walking in a desert.\nHowever collecting labeled data from all possible domains is impractical. Several frameworks have been proposed to deal with the presence of spurious invariant features. For example, in 2 the entropy of the extracted features is minimized to filter out spurious features. However, only linear classifiers are considered and although the approach is motivated by the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework 3, IB is not directly utilized in the learning objective. A similar approach directly based on the IB objective function for eliminating spurious invariant features appears in 4 5. Although numerical results in 4 5 significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods, the methods are heuristically motivated and lack theoretical justification. In contrast to previous works, the key contributions of this paper are the following: We propose a new objective function that is motivated by the conditional entropy minimization (CEM) principle and show that it is explicitly related to the Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) principle 6. We theoretically show that under some suitable assumptions, minimizing the proposed objective function will filter-out spurious features. Our approach is general in the sense that it is able to handle non-linear classifiers and may be extended to other DG methods that employ the invariance-principle. The key idea of our approach is to adopt the IRM framework for learning a good representation function that can capture both the true invariant features and the spurious invariant features, but penalize the conditional entropy of representations given labels to filter-out the spurious invariant features. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we summarize relevant work on DG and briefly introduce the IRM algorithm and the IB framework. In Section 3 we formally define the problem and state and discuss the main assumptions underlying our theoretical analysis. Section 4 provides the main theoretical results which motivate our practical approach proposed in Section 5. Experiments and their results are described in Section 6 with concluding remarks presented in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: and transferable if the feature representations remain invariant from domain to domain.
