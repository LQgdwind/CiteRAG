      "content": "Paper Title: Jacobian Norm with Selective Input Gradient Regularization for Improved and Interpretable Adversarial Defense\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost adversarial defense methods focus on corrupted data, while neglecting clean data. However, a good defensive model should perform well in the presence of both clean and corrupted data. We thus compared our method with state-of-the-art methods by evaluating performance for both clean and crafted data. Experimental results are reported in Table IV. In previous experiments, we compared against different defense models that are to date still unbroken including the PGD based adversarial training  and several randomness-based works   [ref]46 . Additionally, we compared against JARN , which utilizes the Jacobians to generate images resembling to the original images. The compared performance results are shown in Table IV. Note that previous defense efforts [ref]48 often achieve improved accuracy on contaminated data at the expense of lowering clean data accuracy. In contrast, we introduced a notion of linearized robustness which performs well in both clean and perturbed data. As shown in Table IV, in comparison to the PGD-based adversarial training, our proposed method outperforms all methods for both clean and perturbed data accuracy under the white-box attack. For example, differential privacy (DP) , which introduces noises at various locations of the network so as to guarantee a certified defense, does not perform well against L‚àûsubscriptùêøL_{\\infty}-norm based attacks, e.g., PGD  and FGSM . Moreover, to pursue a higher level of certified defense, DP dramatically reduces the clean data accuracy down to 25.1%. A set of noise injection methods, i.e., RSE [ref]46, Adv-BNN  and PNI , combine the adversarial training and noise injection into the inputs/weights of the network. However, these methods, except for the PNI  manually set the noise configurations, making it very ad-hoc, and thus not generalizable to different datasets. PNI  exploits the min-max optimization with trade-off on clean-and perturbed data by injecting trainable Gaussian noise on various locations of the network to generate adversarial examples. Whilst PNI  improves the accuracy of both clean and perturbed data, noise injection is not related to the robustness response of the network. In contrast, our proposed method regularizes the Jacobian norm and the input gradients, such that the network parameters can be dynamically trained to perform better adversarial defense. In addition, the Jacobian norm regularization explicitly suggests the robustness of the classification model in response to imperceptible data perturbation.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: in Table IV.
