      "content": "Paper Title: EvoMoE: An Evolutional Mixture-of-Experts Training Framework via Dense-To-Sparse Gate\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBecause larger pretrained models always achieve better model quality , the size of state-of-the-art NLP models has been increasing 10×10\\times per year, e.g., BERT , GPT [ref]21, T5 , GPT-2 , GPT-3 , which require increasing compute budgets. To improve the model capacity without increasing computation budgets, researchers sparsely scale transformers recently as Figure 2(b) by replacing the feed-forward network with the mixture of experts (MoE) architecture and activating only a subset of these experts for each input sample [ref]7  [ref]9.\nThe main components of the MoE architecture include an expert network E𝐸E for scaling model capacity and a sparse gate network G𝐺G for introducing model sparsity. Expert Network:\nThe expert network E𝐸E includes a series of experts {e1,…,eN}subscript𝑒1…subscript𝑒𝑁\\{e_{1},...,e_{N}\\} to increase the model capacity, where each expert eisubscript𝑒𝑖e_{i} represents a single neural network, e.g., FFN, and contains its own parameters. In Figure 3, the MoE layer consists of three FFN networks.\nFor each expert eisubscript𝑒𝑖e_{i} (ei:ℝD→ℝD:subscript𝑒𝑖→superscriptℝ𝐷superscriptℝ𝐷e_{i}:\\mathbb{R}^{D}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{D}), it takes the token xssubscript𝑥𝑠x_{s} as an input to produce its own output ei​(xs)subscript𝑒𝑖subscript𝑥𝑠e_{i}(x_{s}). The final output of the expert network yssubscript𝑦𝑠y_{s} is the linearly weighted combination of each expert’s output on the token by the gate’s output, formulated as Equation 4. In Figure 3, the expert network takes the input token xs:[−0.2,0.4,1.5]:subscript𝑥𝑠0.20.41.5x_{s}:[-0.2,0.4,1.5] and produces the output of each individual expert on xssubscript𝑥𝑠x_{s}, e.g., e0​(xs)subscript𝑒0subscript𝑥𝑠e_{0}(x_{s}), e1​(xs)subscript𝑒1subscript𝑥𝑠e_{1}(x_{s}) and e2​(xs)subscript𝑒2subscript𝑥𝑠e_{2}(x_{s}). By combining the gate’s output, i.e., [0.35,0.65,0]0.350.650[0.35,0.65,0], the output of this MoE layer is ys=0.35∗e0​(xs)+0.65∗e1​(xs)subscript𝑦𝑠0.35subscript𝑒0subscript𝑥𝑠0.65subscript𝑒1subscript𝑥𝑠y_{s}=0.35*e_{0}(x_{s})+0.65*e_{1}(x_{s}). Sparse Gate Network:\nThe sparse gate network G𝐺G is the key component to introduce model sparsity, which takes a batch of tokens {x1,…,xs}subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑠\\{x_{1},...,x_{s}\\} as input and produces the probability of them with respective to all experts {e1,…,eN}subscript𝑒1…subscript𝑒𝑁\\{e_{1},...,e_{N}\\}.\nShazeer et al. [ref]7 proposes the Top-K gating as Equation 5, which keeps only the top k values before the softmax function. In addition, Wgsubscript𝑊𝑔W_{g} is a trainable variable (Wg∈ℝD×Nsubscript𝑊𝑔superscriptℝ𝐷𝑁W_{g}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D\\times N}) and determine the targeted experts for each token. We illustrate the workflow of a MoE layer in Figure 3, where k=2𝑘2k=2 and Wgsubscript𝑊𝑔W_{g} is a 3 ×\\times 3 (i.e., feature dimension ×\\times number of experts) matrix to represents the parameter of gate network. We first perform a dot-product on xssubscript𝑥𝑠x_{s} and Wgsubscript𝑊𝑔W_{g} to calculate similarity between the input token and the experts. The result, [2.01,2.64,1.8]2.012.641.8[2.01,2.64,1.8], indicates that the input prefers e1>e0>e2subscript𝑒1subscript𝑒0subscript𝑒2e_{1}>e_{0}>e_{2} and we only activate e0subscript𝑒0e_{0} and e1subscript𝑒1e_{1} as k=2𝑘2k=2. Finally, we conduct a softmax function to get the weight score of each expert and perform a weighted sum to get the final output yssubscript𝑦𝑠y_{s}. Previous work mainly focuses on how to improve the quality and efficiency of training such sparse gate network.  Shazeer et al. [ref]7 proposed the noisy Top-K gating on Long Short-TerM memory (LSTM) kayers  and  Lepikhin et al. [ref]9 introduced MoE with Top-2 gate into Transformer.\n Lewis et al. 0 adopted the numerous solution for balanced token-to-expert routing and Roller et al. 1 utilized the hash-based routing strategy. Distributed Training of MoE Models:\nExpert parallel training is a specific method of parallelism for MoE models, which is first proposed by GShard [ref]9. Experts are placed on different workers and each worker takes a different batch of training samples. For non-MoE layers, expert parallelism behaves the same as data parallelism. In MoE layers, tokens in the sequence are sent to workers where their desired experts reside. Similar to model parallelism, the outputs of each MoE layer are exchanged again to be organized back into original sequences for the computation of the next layer. As MoE models often have numerous experts, expert parallelism can scale up with model size better than model parallelism.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Because larger pretrained models always achieve better model quality , the size of state-of-the-art NLP models has been increasing 10×10\\times per year, e.g., BERT , GPT [ref]21, T5 , GPT-2 , GPT-3 , which require increasing compute budgets.
