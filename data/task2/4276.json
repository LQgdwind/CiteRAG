At each γevalsubscript𝛾eval\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eval}}, a polar code tailored for design SNR γevalsubscript𝛾eval\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eval}} is generated by each of the construction methods222[ref]37 only provided the nested polar code for N=64𝑁64N=64 at FER=10−2FERsuperscript102\\text{FER}=10^{-2}. The non-frozen set selection for N=64𝑁64N=64, K=32𝐾32K=32 case in [ref]37 is adopted here for evaluation., and then evaluated by CA-SCL decoding at the same SNR γevalsubscript𝛾eval\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eval}}. Since the constructions are channel-dependent, the polar codes corresponding to different γevalsubscript𝛾eval\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eval}} are potentially different, even when they are generated by the same construction method. The training SNR before fine-tuning is selected uniformly at random from the range [−3,0.5]30.5[-3,0.5] dB in each episode for 𝒫​(64,32,4)𝒫64324\\mathcal{P}(64,32,4), and the corresponding training SNR range is [−2.5,0.5]2.50.5[-2.5,0.5] dB for 𝒫​(128,64,4)𝒫128644\\mathcal{P}(128,64,4). Figs. 4 and 5 show that the constructions from the IMP-fine-tuned method outperform Tal-Vardy’s and 5G constructions in all evaluated scenarios under CA-SCL decoding with various list sizes L𝐿L. The improvement in FER increases with L𝐿L. Figs. 4 and 5 also show that the polar codes constructed by the IMP-fine-tuned model achieve the lowest FER among codes generated by these considered benchmark methods tailored for CA-SCL decoding. For a given γevalsubscript𝛾eval\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eval}} and a given decoding list size L𝐿L, the IMP algorithm with fine-tuning finds the same 𝒫​(128,64,4)𝒫128644\\mathcal{P}(128,64,4) as the GenAlg does. When the two algorithms identify the same polar codes at a given γevalsubscript𝛾eval\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eval}}, the IMP algorithm still shows its advantage over the GenAlg in the sense that the γevalsubscript𝛾eval\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eval}} values that are not seen during training can be directly fed into the same trained IMP model to generate corresponding polar codes. In contrast, re-training is needed for the GenAlg model when γevalsubscript𝛾eval\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eval}} deviates from the design SNR.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: Figs. 4 and 5 compare the FER of the learned constructions by the IMP algorithm with pointwise fine-tuning to the constructions given by the Tal-Vardy’s method , the 5G NR standard , the GenAlg [ref]35, the nested polar-code construction method [ref]37, and the tabular RL method [ref]38 for 𝒫​(64,32,4)𝒫64324\\mathcal{P}(64,32,4) and 𝒫​(128,64,4)𝒫128644\\mathcal{P}(128,64,4), respectively.
