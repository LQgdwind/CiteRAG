Each of it is a 28×\\times28 pixel gray handwritten digital image, marked with ten classes range from 0 to 9. CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32×\\times32 color images of 10 classes such as airplane, bird, ship and frog, with 6000 in each class. ImageNet project is a large visual database for visual object recognition research. It contains more than 14 million images, covering up to 20000 categories. In our experiment, we selected 10 classes with a total of 13500 images for detection and defense test. DNNs:\nA Variety of different models are adopted in our experiments. For MNIST, we crafted two self-trained ConvNets, whose network structure is shown in Table 3. For CIFAR-10, we trained AlexNet [ref]21 and VGG19 , whose classification rate are 99.82%percent\\% and 99.88%percent\\% respectively. Besides, Inception v3 (Inc-v3)  and VGG19 are used in the experiment of ImageNet dataset. Their recognition accuracy go to 99.48%percent\\% and 99.50%percent\\%. Attack methods:\nWe used eleven attack methods, which adopt various algorithms to generate adversarial examples of different perturbation size and distribution, so as to prove the effectiveness of defense and detection of SFE. The white-box attacks include FGSM , DeepFool (L2) , PGD [ref]26, MI-FGSM , BIM , JSMA  and UAP  while black-box attacks contain CRA , AUNA , PWA  and LSA . Attack success rate and average perturbation sizes are shown in Table 4 and Table 5, where ρa​d​vsubscript𝜌𝑎𝑑𝑣\\rho_{adv} denotes the average perturbation size of each pixel after normalization to [ref]0 [ref]0 . Defense baselines:\nNine defense methods and five detection baselines were applied in our experiment. Defense methods includes resize(RS), rotate(RT), random resize(RRS),random rotate(RRT) , RCE , Ens-D , DAE 3, Defense-GAN  and APE-GAN 6. The settings of different defenses are detailed in Table 6. As for detection, 45C-Detector ,Perturbation detection (Per-D) , adversarial training-based detection (AdvT-D) , PGD-based detection (PGD-D)  [ref]26 and GAT  are used to make fair comparison with SFE. Metrics:\nThe metrics used in the experiments are defined as follows: ① Classification accuracy: a​c​c=nt​r​u​eN𝑎𝑐𝑐subscript𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝑁acc=\\frac{n_{true}}{N}, where nt​r​u​esubscript𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒n_{true}is the number of clean examples correctly classified by the targeted model and N𝑁N denotes the total number of benign images. ② Attack success rate: A​S​R=Na​d​vN𝐴𝑆𝑅subscript𝑁𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑁ASR=\\frac{N_{adv}}{N}, where Na​d​vsubscript𝑁𝑎𝑑𝑣N_{adv} denotes the number of adversarial examples misclassified by the targeted model after attacks. ③ Perturbation L2-norm: ρa​d​v=‖xa​d​v−x‖2subscript𝜌𝑎𝑑𝑣subscriptnormsubscript𝑥𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑥2\\rho_{adv}=||x_{adv}-x||_{2}, where x𝑥x and xa​d​vsubscript𝑥𝑎𝑑𝑣x_{adv} are benign and its corresponding adversarial example respectively, and ||⋅||2||\\cdot||_{2} represents L2 norm. ④ Detection rate, D​R=Nd​e​tN𝐷𝑅subscript𝑁𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑁DR=\\frac{N_{det}}{N},where Nd​e​tsubscript𝑁𝑑𝑒𝑡N_{det} is the number of input examples that are detected by model. ⑤ Defense success rate, D​S​R=Nd​e​fNa​d​v𝐷𝑆𝑅subscript𝑁𝑑𝑒𝑓subscript𝑁𝑎𝑑𝑣DSR=\\frac{N_{def}}{N_{adv}},where Nd​e​fsubscript𝑁𝑑𝑒𝑓N_{def} denotes the number of adversarial examples correctly classified by the target model after defense. ⑥ Within-class distance, F​S​Ak=1−n​o​r​m​(∑j=1nk​d​i​s​t​(fxj,k,fc​k))nk𝐹𝑆subscript𝐴𝑘1𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑗superscript1subscript𝑛𝑘𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡subscript𝑓subscript𝑥𝑗𝑘subscript𝑓𝑐𝑘subscript𝑛𝑘FSA_{k}=1-\\frac{norm(\\sum{j=1}^{n_{k}}dist(f_{x_{j},k},f_{ck}))}{n_{k}},F​S​A=∑i=1K​d2​(k)K𝐹𝑆𝐴𝑖superscript1𝐾superscript𝑑2𝑘𝐾FSA=\\frac{\\sum{i=1}^{K}d^{2}(k)}{K} , where nksubscript𝑛𝑘n_{k} denotes the number of examples belonging to class k𝑘k. fxj,ksubscript𝑓subscript𝑥𝑗𝑘f_{x_{j},k} denotes the feature vector of the example xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j} belonging to the k−t​h𝑘𝑡ℎk-th class in the high-dimensional feature space. fc​ksubscript𝑓𝑐𝑘f_{ck} represents the center of class k𝑘k in the feature subspace. K𝐾K denotes the number of total class and d​i​s​t​(⋅)𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡⋅dist(\\cdot) represents the normalization function. For each class, we sum F​S​Ak𝐹𝑆subscript𝐴𝑘FSA_{k} and average it to gain the final F​S​A𝐹𝑆𝐴FSA. The model with smaller with-in class distance always has higher classification accuracy. ⑦ Among-class distance, F​S​Dk,k+1=d​i​s​t​(fc​k,fc​k+1)𝐹𝑆subscript𝐷𝑘𝑘1𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡subscript𝑓𝑐𝑘subscript𝑓𝑐𝑘1FSD_{k,k+1}=dist(f_{ck},f_{ck+1}),F​S​D=1K​(K+1)/2​∑i=1K−1∑j=i+1KF​S​Di,j𝐹𝑆𝐷1𝐾𝐾12superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝐾1superscriptsubscript𝑗𝑖1𝐾𝐹𝑆subscript𝐷𝑖𝑗FSD=\\frac{1}{K(K+1)/2}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{K-1}\\sum\\limits_{j=i+1}^{K}FSD_{i,j} , where fc​ksubscript𝑓𝑐𝑘f_{ck} and fc​k+1subscript𝑓𝑐𝑘1f_{ck+1} represent the center of class k𝑘k and k+1𝑘1k+1. The final F​S​D𝐹𝑆𝐷FSD is calculated by averaging the sum of F​S​Di,j𝐹𝑆subscript𝐷𝑖𝑗FSD_{i,j} in each class. Similar to with-in class distance, the model with larger among-class distance performs better in identification and recognition.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: DNNs:\nA Variety of different models are adopted in our experiments.
