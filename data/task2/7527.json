      "content": "Paper Title: Boosting Neural Representations for Videos with a Conditional Decoder\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImplicit Video Representation. Recently, implicit video representations have engaged increasing interest due to their wide-ranging potential applications, such as video compression, inpainting and interpolation. Roughly, existing implicit video representations can be classified into two categories: (i) Index-based methods  [ref]19 [ref]1  [ref]11 take content-independent time vectors and/or spatial coordinates as inputs. They only rely on the neural network to store all video information. (ii) Hybrid-based methods   1   take content-relevant embeddings as inputs to provide a visual prior for the network, which reduces the learning difficulty of the model and thereby enhances its representation performance. These content-relevant embeddings can be derived from each frame using specific encoders  1  or generated through random initialization and backpropagation  .\nIn this paper, we focus on designing a universal conditional decoder framework to effectively boost the representation performance of existing video INRs, thus setting a new benchmark in the field. Network Conditioning. Early methods in conditional feature modulation heavily rely on conditional normalization (CN). CN replaces the feature-wise transformation in normalization layers with affine parameters generated from external information, which has shown its effectiveness in applications like style transfer   , semantic image synthesis , and denoising . A pivotal contribution by Perez et al.  demonstrates that it is possible to directly modulate intermediate features in a network without undergoing normalization. This technique has been widely used in super-resolution  , compression , and restoration .\nInstead of using CN to modify the distribution of intermediate features as in previous INR studies [ref]19 [ref]1 [ref]11, we introduce a conditional affine transformation without normalization to achieve a more precise alignment of intermediate features with the target frame, potentially improving the reconstruction quality of existing video INRs. INR for Video Compression. As implicit neural networks generally fit videos using the model weights, it offers a novel perspective on video compression by translating it into model compression. Most video INRs [ref]19 [ref]1   follow the three-step compression pipeline of NeRV : (i) model pruning, such as global unstructured pruning, with fine-tuning to reduce the model size; (ii) post-training quantization or quantization-aware training to lower the precision of each weight; (iii) entropy coding to minimize the statistical correlation of coded symbols. Unfortunately, optimizing these components separately leads to sub-optimal coding efficiency. Thus, Gomes et al. [ref]11 and Maiya et al.  have applied entropy minimization   8 to improve the video INR compression. During training, they estimate the bitrate of quantized weights using a small neural network to model each weightâ€™s distribution. But in the inference stage, this neural entropy model is replaced with either a context-adaptive binary arithmetic coder (CABAC) or an arithmetic coder using a fixed statistical frequency table. This switch in entropy models between training and inference leads to the sub-optimal RD performance. Moreover, these methods focus on compressing model weights, overlooking the significance of content-relevant embeddings in hybrid-based video INRs. To bridge these gaps, we propose a consistent entropy minimization technique to unify the weight and embedding compression. Consequently, our scheme is exceptionally suited for any video INR compression, marking a significant stride in this domain.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: potential applications, such as video compression, inpainting and interpolation.
