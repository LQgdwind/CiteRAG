      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Self-Contrast Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph self-supervised learning (GSSL)¬†[ref]1 [ref]2 [ref]3 has attracted significant attention in recent years. Compared with traditional semi-supervised and supervised graph learning¬†  ,\nGSSL seeks to employ supervision extracted from data itself,\nwhich can effectively circumvent the need for costly annotated data.\nIn particular,\none of the main types of GSSL is graph contrastive learning (GCL)¬† [ref]3,\nwhose core idea is to minimize the distance between representations of different augmented views of the same graph (‚Äúpositive pairs‚Äù),\nand maximize that of augmented views from different graphs (‚Äúnegative pairs‚Äù). According to whether negative samples are used by the model or not,\nmost existing graph-level GCL methods fall into one of two classes.\nOn the one hand,\nsome approaches construct one positive sample and KùêæK negative samples for each graph¬†[ref]3  ,\nand formulate their objectives based on the normalized temperature-scaled cross entropy loss (NT-Xent)¬†,\nsuch as GraphCL¬†[ref]3.\nHowever,\nthese methods are easily affected by KùêæK and an appropriate KùêæK value is usually set empirically, which lacks theoretical supports.\nWhen KùêæK is small,\nthe model might not learn sufficient information to discriminate positive and negative samples;\notherwise,\nthere could lead to a large number of false-negative samples and slow convergence.\nIn these methods,\nfor each graph in a batch,\nother graphs in the same batch are considered as its negative samples,\ni.e.,\nK=B‚àí1ùêæùêµ1K=B-1,\nwhere BùêµB is the batch size.\nAs shown in Fig. 1,\nthe performance of\nGraphCL is significantly affected by KùêæK on the COLLAB dataset.\nIn particular,\nwhen KùêæK is small,\nthe performance of GraphCL drops drastically.\nOn the other hand,\nthe second type of methods propose to not use negative samples.\nHowever,\nthese methods could suffer from a degenerate solution ,\nwhere all outputs ‚Äúcrash‚Äù to an undesired constant.\nTo avoid such model collapse,\nadditional strategies have to be applied, such as asymmetric dual encoders  .\nRecently,\nsome studies  have showed that although these training strategies can avoid collapse to some extent, they may still cause collapse in partial dimensions of the representation, which leads to worse performance.\nThe main reason for the model collapse is the complete non-use of negative samples.\nTherefore, a research question arises:\n\nTo avoid the problem of KùêæK selection and the degenerate solution,\ncan we develop a GCL model that constructs only one positive sample and one negative sample for each graph?\n Given one positive sample and one negative sample for each graph,\na straightforward framework is to use triplet loss as objective function.\nHowever,\ntriplet loss is hard-to-train and mainly suffers from poor local optima and slow convergence,\npartially due to that the loss function employs only one negative example while not interacting with other negative classes per update¬†.\nIn short, there are two difficulties:\none is to find a valid negative sample and the other is to solve the hard-to-train problem. For the first difficulty,\nhard negative sample mining¬†     has been proposed.\nHowever, most existing methods applied to graphs are node-level sampling, and very few is for graph-level sampling.\nRecently,\nCuco¬† proposes curriculum contrastive learning,\nwhich ranks negative samples from easy to hard and trains them in order.\nCGC¬† proposes to obtain reliable counterfactual negative samples by pre-training to help contrastive learning.\nHowever,\nthis introduces additional computational overhead\nthat limits the performance of GCL.\nInspired by the fact that\nsome substances change their properties in response to external conditions,\nwe propose a simple yet effective method to obtain negative samples from graph themselves.\nFor example,\nan enzymatic protein could become a non-enzymatic one after some perturbations.\nSince the non-enzymatic protein is directly generated from the enzymatic protein,\nthey can share structural similarities to some degree,\nwhich makes the negative sample discriminatively difficult, thereby achieving a similar effect to hard negative sampling. To address the hard-to-train problem,\nwe consider multiple facets of each graph to construct masked embedding vectors for its positive/negative samples.\nThen the self-contrast is performed not only between the whole embedding vectors,\nbut also between masked embedding vectors corresponding to each facet.\nThe masked contrast can be used to provide more information and speed up the model convergence.\nFurther,\noptimizing the triplet loss essentially maximizes the distance between positive and negative samples. This amplifies the margin between different classes but cannot ensure low-dimensional representations for each class compact. Therefore, we further shorten the absolute distance between anchor and positive sample, which can make each class more compact and make the distance between similar samples in the feature space closer.\nIt can also provide shortcuts for model convergence (we will show the experimental results in Section¬†V). In this paper,\nwe study graph contrastive learning and propose a novel Graph Self-Contrast framework GraphSC,\nwhich follows the pattern of generating positive and negative samples from the samples themselves and conducting self-contrast.\nFor each graph,\nGraphSC¬†first generates one positive sample and one negative sample from the graph itself,\nand then self-contrasts the graph with its positive/negative samples as well as their masked embeddings.\nInspired by the assumption in¬†[ref]3 that the semantics of a graph will not change for a certain perturbation strength,\nwe move forward and assume that the semantics of a graph will change under strong perturbations.\nSpecifically,\nwe propose to generate two different (positive and negative) views of a graph via graph augmentation functions of various intensities.\nAfter that,\nthe original graph and two generated views of the graph are fed into a shared GNN encoder,\nafter which sum pooling is used to derive graph-level representations.\nIn particular,\nwe use the representation of the original graph as anchor, and the representations of views generated by weak and strong perturbations\nas a positive sample and a negative sample, respectively.\nFurther,\nto implement masked self-contrast,\nwe perform a division on the embeddings of positive/negative samples, and\ndivide each representation vector into multiple factors by Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC)¬†.\nIn addition to the contrast between the whole embedding vectors,\nwe mask each factor separately and perform masked self-contrast between corresponding representations.\nMoreover,\nwe use Mean Square Error (MSE) loss/Barlow Twins loss (BT)¬† as a regularization to shorten the absolute distance between anchor and positive sample.\nThis leads to better convergence in implementation.\nFinally,\nwe summarize the contributions as follows:\n We propose a novel graph self-contrast representation learning framework GraphSC. We present a simple yet effective method to construct negative samples from\ngraphs themselves in graph-level representation learning. We use triplet loss in graph contrastive learning and\naddress the hard-to-train problem of triplet loss\nby putting forward\na masked self-contrast mechanism and directly shortening the absolute distance for positive pairs. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of GraphSC¬†in both unsupervised learning and transfer learning settings.\nExperimental results\nshow that GraphSC¬†\nperforms favorably against other state-of-the-arts.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Graph self-supervised learning (GSSL)¬†[ref]1 [ref]2 [ref]3 has attracted significant attention in recent years.
