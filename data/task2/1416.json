      "content": "Paper Title: FLTrust: Byzantine-robust Federated Learning via Trust Bootstrapping\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFederated learning (FL)   is an emerging distributed learning paradigm on decentralized data. In FL, there are multiple clients (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices, and edge devices) and a service provider (e.g., Google, Apple, and IBM). Each client holds a local training dataset; and the service provider enables the clients to jointly learn a model (called global model) without sharing their raw local training data with the service provider. Due to its potential promise of protecting private/proprietary client data, particularly in the age of emerging privacy regulations such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), FL has been deployed by high-profile companies. For instance, Google has deployed FL for next-word prediction on Android Gboard ; WeBank uses FL for credit risk prediction ; and more than 10 leading pharmaceutical companies leverage FL for drug discovery in the project MELLODDY . Roughly speaking, FL iteratively performs the following three steps:\nthe server provided by the service provider sends the current global model to the clients or a selected subset of them; each selected client trains a model (called local model) via fine-tuning the global model using its own local training data and sends the local model updates back to the server111It is algorithmically equivalent to send local models instead of their updates to the server.; and the server aggregates the local model updates to be a global model update according to an aggregation rule and uses it to update the global model. For instance, FedAvg , a popular FL method in non-adversarial settings developed by Google, computes the average of the local model updates weighted by the sizes of local training datasets as the global model update. However, due to its distributed nature, FL is vulnerable to adversarial manipulations on malicious clients, which could be fake clients injected by an attacker or genuine clients compromised by an attacker. For instance, malicious clients can corrupt the global model via poisoning their local training data (known as data poisoning attacks  2) or their local model updates sent to the server (called local model poisoning attacks 5   ). The corrupted global model makes incorrect predictions for a large number of testing examples indiscriminately (called untargeted attacks) 5, or it predicts attacker-chosen target labels for attacker-chosen target testing examples while the predicted labels for other non-target testing examples are unaffected (called targeted attacks)   . For instance, the global model in FedAvg can be arbitrarily manipulated by a single malicious client [ref]9 [ref]48. Byzantine-robust FL methods [ref]9 2 9  [ref]48\naim to address malicious clients. The goal therein is to learn an accurate global model when a bounded number of clients are malicious. Their key idea is to\nleverage Byzantine-robust aggregation rules, which essentially compare the clients’ local model updates and remove statistical outliers before using them to update the global model. For instance, Median [ref]48 computes the coordinate-wise median of the clients’ local model updates as the global model update. However, recent studies  5 showed that existing Byzantine-robust FL methods are still vulnerable to local model poisoning attacks on malicious clients. The fundamental reason is that they have no root of trust. Specifically, from the server’s perspective, every client could be malicious, providing no root of trust for the server to decide which local model updates are suspicious. Our work:  In this work, we propose a new Byzantine-robust FL method called FLTrust. Instead of completely relying on the local model updates from clients, the server itself bootstraps trust in FLTrust. Specifically, the service provider manually collects a small clean training dataset (called root dataset) for the learning task.\nThe server maintains a model (called server model) for the root dataset just like how a client maintains a local model. In each iteration, the server updates the global model by considering both its server model update and the clients’ local model updates. Our new Byzantine-robust aggregation rule:  Specifically, we design a new Byzantine-robust aggregation rule in FLTrust to incorporate the root of trust.\nA model update can be viewed as a vector, which is characterized by its direction and magnitude. An attacker can manipulate both the directions and magnitudes of the local model updates on the malicious clients. Therefore, our aggregation rule takes both the directions and magnitudes into considerations when computing the global model update. Specifically, the server first assigns a trust score (TS) to a local model update, where the trust score is larger if the direction of the local model update is more similar to that of the server model update. Formally, we use the cosine similarity between a local model update and the server model update to measure the similarity of their directions. However, the cosine similarity alone is insufficient because a local model update, whose cosine similarity score is negative, can still have a negative impact on the aggregated global model update. Therefore, we further clip the cosine similarity score using the popular ReLU operation. The ReLU-clipped cosine similarity is our trust score.\nThen, FLTrust normalizes each local model update by scaling it to have the same magnitude as the server model update. Such normalization essentially projects each local model update to the same hyper-sphere where the server model update lies in the vector space, which limits the impact of the poisoned local model updates with large magnitudes. Finally, FLTrust computes the average of the normalized local model updates weighted by their trust scores as the global model update, which is used to update the global model. FLTrust can defend against existing attacks:  We perform extensive empirical evaluation on six datasets from different domains, including five image classification datasets (MNIST-0.1, MNIST-0.5, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CH-MNIST) and a smartphone-based human activity recognition dataset (Human Activity Recognition). We compare FLTrust with multiple existing Byzantine-robust FL methods including Krum [ref]9, Trimmed mean [ref]48, and Median [ref]48. Moreover, we evaluate multiple poisoning attacks including label flipping attack (a data poisoning attack), Krum attack and Trim attack (untargeted local model poisoning attacks) 5, as well as Scaling attack222The Scaling attack is also known as a backdoor attack. (targeted local model poisoning attack) . Our results show that FLTrust is secure against these attacks even if the root dataset has less than 100 training examples, while existing Byzantine-robust FL methods are vulnerable to them or a subset of them. For instance, a CNN global model learnt using FLTrust has a testing error rate of 0.04 under all the evaluated attacks on MNIST-0.1. However, the Krum attack can increase the testing error rate of the CNN global model learnt by Krum from 0.10 to 0.90. Moreover, we treat FedAvg under no attacks as a baseline and compare our FLTrust under attacks with it. Our results show that FLTrust under attacks achieves similar testing error rates to FedAvg under no attacks. We also study different variants of FLTrust and the impact of different system parameters on FLTrust. For instance, our results show that FLTrust works well once the root dataset distribution does not diverge too much from the overall training data distribution of the learning task. FLTrust can defend against adaptive attacks: \nAn attacker can adapt its attack to FLTrust. Therefore, we also evaluate FLTrust against adaptive attacks. Specifically, Fang et al. 5 proposed a general framework of local model poisoning attacks, which can be applied to optimize the attacks for any given aggregation rule. An attacker can substitute the aggregation rule of FLTrust into the framework and obtain an adaptive attack that is particularly optimized against FLTrust. Our empirical results show that FLTrust is still robust against such adaptive attacks. For instance, even when 60% of the clients are malicious and collude with each other, FLTrust can still learn a CNN global model with testing error rate 0.04 for MNIST-0.1. This testing error rate is the same as that of the CNN global model learnt by FedAvg under no attacks. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose the first federated learning method FLTrust that bootstraps trust to achieve Byzantine robustness against malicious clients. We empirically evaluate FLTrust against existing attacks. Our results show that FLTrust can defend against them. We design adaptive attacks against FLTrust and evaluate their performance. Our results show that FLTrust is also robust against the adaptive attacks.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: labels for other non-target testing examples are unaffected (called targeted attacks)   .
