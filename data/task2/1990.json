With the deployed computational power and storage capability, MEC systems construct the node-edge-cloud architecture in supporting the applications at resource-constrained nodes that require low latency communication (e.g., autonomous driving) or high throughput (e.g., content delivery network) . Edge nodes such as sensors, mobile devices, and connected vehicles are generating an unprecedented amount of data consistently and coupled with cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) / Deep Learning (DL) techniques, the MEC system is able to conduct intelligent inference (e.g., road congestion prediction ) and perceptive control (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) swarm navigation ). In traditional ML fashion, in order to train a complex DL model with millions of model parameters, a tremendous amount of data aggregated from multiple edge nodes is typically needed, which is offloaded via wireless network to edge server. However, collecting data for model training is unrealistic from privacy, security, regulatory, or necessity perspectives. With the ever-increasing computational capability on edge nodes, it becomes more attractive to perform model training on the edge node side instead of sending raw data to the edge server. To this end, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a variant of the previous Distributed ML (DML) manner, which decouples the data acquisition and model training at the edge server [ref]6 . In general, FL systems aim to optimize a global model under the orchestration of an edge server, which allows the collaboration of multiple edge nodes for data augmentation while keeping training data locally. FL involves several communication rounds, each of which includes local model training, model update transmission, and global model aggregation. Along the iterative process, the edge server is able to train a statistical model that is suitable for all participating nodes without accessing user-sensitive data. The improved data confidentiality and reduced volume of communication cost make FL one of the most promising technologies for future network intelligence . Nonetheless, a fundamental challenge for FL in comparison with the optimization in DML, where algorithms run on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) data samples partitioned from a large dataset, is the data heterogeneity   [ref]11. To be more specific, the model is updated via feature learning on local data samples, which are user-specific and reveal a different pattern. The data samples across participating nodes may not be independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.). Since participating nodes in each iteration are selected randomly, data distribution on nodes cannot represent the global data distribution. Training on nodes with non-i.i.d. datasets will lead to the biased model update, which stagnates model convergence and reduces the model accuracy substantially, and consequently invokes additional communication rounds to resource-constrained edge nodes  [ref]11. Though a relatively small amount of data is sent (i.e., in general, model parameters have a smaller size than the raw training data), communication time in FL is proven to be the critical bottleneck for FL due to the network uncertainty, bandwidth limitation, and straggler effect, etc. . In this paper, we design a node selection111A critical property that differentiates FL from a typical distributed optimization problem is the massively distributed nodes [ref]6. Therefore, in each round, a small fraction of nodes is selected for participation. scheme to improve the convergence rate of FL with non-i.i.d nodes, called FedPNS, which is a Probabilistic Node Selection framework with contribution-related criteria. We find out global model aggregation over all participating nodes is not of necessity, whereas excluding some adverse local updates may lead to a better global model in terms of model accuracy. In order to improve the expected decrement of FL loss in each round, we propose an Optimal Aggregation algorithm to determine the optimal subset of local updates (from the participating nodes) for global model aggregation, which utilizes the inner product between local gradients and the global gradient222We use local/global gradient and local/global update interchangeably. as the indicator. By applying the result from Optimal Aggregation, the data heterogeneity can be profiled, which is used to adjust the probability for each node to be selected in the subsequent global rounds. Consequently, the server can preferentially select nodes that propel faster model convergence. Note that our probabilistic node selection is conducted on the server-side, which does not impose additional communication costs. Our main\ncontributions in this paper are as follows We analyze the convergence bound of the commonly adopted Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm [ref]6 from a theoretical perspective and derive the expected decrease of FL global loss, considering the data heterogeneity and the way to aggregate local updates. We challenge the necessity of global model aggregation over local updates of all participating nodes and propose Optimal Aggregation to identify and exclude the potential adverse local updates, which enlarges the expected decrease of global loss in each round. We design FedPNS, a Probabilistic Node Selection scheme that enables server to dynamically adjust the probability for each node to be selected in each round, based on the result of Optimal Aggregation. FedPNS tendentiously selects nodes that boost model convergence. The convergence rate improvement of FedPNS over FedAvg is illustrated theoretically and the imposed computational complexity of FedPNS is discussed. We empirically evaluate the performance of FedPNS via extensive experiments using the synthetic dataset and real datasets with different learning objectives. The experimental results show the effectiveness of FedPNS in improving the convergence rate of the FL model compared\nwith the commonly adopted FedAvg algorithm.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: growth of computational capability at mobile edge sides, next-generation computing network is experiencing a paradigm shift from traditional cloud computing to Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems [ref]1.
