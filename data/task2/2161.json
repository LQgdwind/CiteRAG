      "content": "Paper Title: An Online Riemannian PCA for Stochastic Canonical Correlation Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets and baseline. We conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST [ref]27, Mediamill  and CIFAR-10 ) to evaluate the performance of RSG+ to extract top-k𝑘k canonical components. To our best knowledge, [ref]5 is the only previous work which stochastically optimizes the population objective in a streaming fashion and can extract top-k𝑘k components, so we compare our RSG+ with the matrix stochastic gradient (MSG) method proposed in [ref]5 (There are two methods proposed in [ref]5 and we choose MSG because it performs better in the experiments in [ref]5). The details regarding the three datasets and how we process them are as follows: MNIST [ref]27: MNIST contains grey-scale images of size 28×28282828\\times 28. We use its full training set containing 606060K images. Every image is split into left/right half, which are used as the two views.\nMediamill : Mediamill contains around 25.825.825.8K paired features of videos and corresponding commentary of dimension 120,101120101120,101 respectively.\nCIFAR-10 : CIFAR-10 contains 606060K 32×32323232\\times 32 color images. Like MNIST, we split the images into left/right half and use them as two views. Evaluation metric. We choose to use Proportion of Correlations Captured (PCC) which is widely used [ref]30 , partly due to its efficiency, especially for relatively large datasets. Let U^∈Rdx×k,V^∈Rdy×kformulae-sequence^𝑈superscript𝑅subscript𝑑𝑥𝑘^𝑉superscript𝑅subscript𝑑𝑦𝑘\\hat{U}\\in R^{d_{x}\\times k},\\hat{V}\\in R^{d_{y}\\times k} denote the estimated subspaces returned by RSG+, and U∗∈Rdx×k,V∗∈Rdy×kformulae-sequencesuperscript𝑈superscript𝑅subscript𝑑𝑥𝑘superscript𝑉superscript𝑅subscript𝑑𝑦𝑘U^{*}\\in R^{d_{x}\\times k},V^{*}\\in R^{d_{y}\\times k} denote the true canonical subspaces (all for top-k𝑘k). The PCC is defined as PCC=TCC​(X​U^,Y​V^)TCC​(X​U∗,Y​V∗)PCCTCC𝑋^𝑈𝑌^𝑉TCC𝑋superscript𝑈𝑌superscript𝑉\\text{PCC}=\\frac{\\text{TCC}(X\\hat{U},Y\\hat{V})}{\\text{TCC}(XU^{*},YV^{*})},\nwhere TCC is the sum of canonical correlations between two matrices. Performance. The performance in terms of PCC as a function of # of seen samples (coming in a streaming way) are shown in Fig. 2, and our RSG+ achieves around 10 times runtime improvement from MSG (see appendix for the table). Our RSG+ captures more correlation than MSG [ref]5 while being 5−105105-10 times faster. One case where our RSG+ underperforms [ref]5 is when the top-k𝑘k eigenvalues are dominated by the top-l𝑙l eigenvalues with l<k𝑙𝑘l<k (Fig. 2(b)): on Mediamill dataset, the top-4 eigenvalues of the covariance matrix in view 1 are: 8.61,2.99,1.15,0.378.612.991.150.378.61,2.99,1.15,0.37. The first eigenvalue is dominantly large compared with the rest and our RSG+ performs better for k=1𝑘1k=1 and worse than [ref]5 for k=2,4𝑘24k=2,4.\nWe also provide the runtime of RSG+ under different data dimension (set dx=dy=dsubscript𝑑𝑥subscript𝑑𝑦𝑑d_{x}=d_{y}=d) and number of total samples sampled from joint gaussian distribution in appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: Datasets and baseline. We conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST [ref]27, Mediamill  and CIFAR-10 ) to evaluate the performance of RSG+ to extract top-k𝑘k canonical components.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
