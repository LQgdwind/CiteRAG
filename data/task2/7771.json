      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Reactive Synthesis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStructured requirements specification languages for embedded control systems such as EARS  and CLEAR  \nare semantically represented in a rule-like fragment of linear temporal logic (LTL) [ref]4.\nConsider, for example, the EARS specification pattern where constraint T𝑇T specifies the trigger condition, A𝐴A the actions to be triggered, and R𝑅R the corresponding release condition for these actions.\nHereby, the constraints T𝑇T, A𝐴A, R𝑅R may contain any finite number of 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} (next-step), but no other, temporal operators.\nThe logical meaning of (1) is easily encoded by where 𝐆𝐆\\mathbf{G} (globally)\nand 𝐔𝐔\\mathbf{U} (strong until) are LTL temporal operators.\nIn this way, every EARS specification pattern\ncan be implemented in a rule-like sublogic\nof LTL without nested until operators [ref]4.\nWe define a corresponding sublogic of LTL which we call GXU. The GXU logic is of course motivated by the earlier GXW  , which has proven to be practically meaningful for modeling a large number of embedded control scenarios from industrial automation and for autogenerating correct-by-construction programmable logic control (PLC) programs  .\nAs the naming suggests, GXW only supports weak until, whereas GXU also includes the strong until operator.\nWith this extension GXU can now express all\nGR(1) specifications . We consider Church’s synthesis problem, which involves generating an input-output control program to implement a given control specification.\nSolutions to Church’s problem\nare traditionally based on the fundamental logic-automaton\nconnection, and they rely on rather complex determination procedures and emptiness tests for ω𝜔\\omega-automata  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0.\nHowever, in the special case of GXU with its syntactic restrictions, we can easily compile specifications to programs as long as the individual specification rules are mutually consistent.\nMore precisely, this structural\napproach 1 to GXU reactive synthesis\nproceeds in two subsequent steps by: Recursing on the syntactic structure of the GXU control\nspecification for instantiating and combining a small set of GXU-specific Mealy machines with monitors templates.\nThe transitions of the resulting Mealy machines are equipped with automata that monitor finite windows of input traces to determine when trigger conditions exist. Determining possible conflicts between individual GXU constraints by solving a corresponding validity problem. Consistency checks in (step 2.) are naturally encoded as forall-exists top-level quantified Boolean formulas (2QBF) .\nDue to the syntactic restrictions of GXU we are able to\nsolve this specific class of logical problems in polynomial time.\nThe complexity of consistency checking (step 2.) dominates over the structural recursion (step 1.),\nand we obtain our main result that realizability for GXU is decidable in polynomial time. In comparison, the synthesis procedure for GXW in  is incomplete as it generally does not deal with interdependent specifications, and GR(1) synthesis\nis polynomial in the underlying state space, which itself can be exponential.\nFurthermore, since GXU synthesis is essentially based on logical operations, it can easily be extended to support a richer control specification language that includes clocks and other decidable data constraints. Specifying the operating environment of a controller arguably is one of the most challenging steps in designing embedded control systems.\nFor example, the GXU specification clearly is not realizable. Whenever the input event ’aa\\mathrm{a}’ holds in two consecutive steps, the\nsystem can not produce a value for the output event ’bb\\mathrm{b}’ such\nthat specification (3) holds.\nA sensible repair to (3) therefore is to constrain input events by the temporal constraint\n𝐆​(a→𝐗​¬a)𝐆→a𝐗a\\mathbf{G}(\\mathrm{a}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{X}\\neg\\mathrm{a}). The general problem of assumption mining is to find environment restrictions which are sufficient for making the system under consideration realizable, while still giving the environment maximal freedom 2.\nAssumption mining solutions constrain the behavior of the environment by excluding countertraces that come from failed synthesis attempts 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0.\nSince we have reduced the realizability problem for GXU to a logic problem, we are now able to mine environmental assumptions in a symbolic manner, which solely relies on a combination of logical notions, including\nPadoa’s characterization of definability,\nand the corresponding construction of interpolation formulas for restricting environmental behavior. Overall, our main contributions are as follows. Definition of the GXU logic, which is more expressive than both GXW  \nand GR(1) . Definition of the concept and use of Mealy machines with monitors, where each transition is equipped with an interleaved automaton that monitors the input events and is used to determine the generation of the corresponding output events. A polynomial time synthesis method for GXU specifications based on a reduction of the realizability problem to an equivalent and polynomial time validity problem. Assumption mining based on a combination of logic-based concepts such as Padoa’s theorem and Craig interpolation. The paper is structured as follows.\nSection 2 sets the stage by summarizing fundamental logical concepts and notation.\nNext, Section 3 defines the GXU sublogic of LTL, and\nSection 4\ndescribes the structural approach to construct,\nfrom a small finite amount of patterns,\na Mealy machine with monitors for realizing a single GXU formula.\nSynthesis for GXU is described in Section 5.1, including (1) the use of Mealy machines to represent streams satisfying the given GXU formula, and (2) a reduction of GXU realizability to a logical validity problem.\nIn Section 5.2 we describe a logical approach to assumption mining for GXU.\nWe illustrate the reactive synthesis and repair of GXU specifications in Section 6 using a case study from the field of automation.\nIn Section 7 we compare these results with the most closely related work,\nand Section 8 concludes with a few remarks.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Structured requirements specification languages for embedded control systems such as EARS  and CLEAR  \nare semantically represented in a rule-like fragment of linear temporal logic (LTL) [ref]4.\nConsider, for example, the EARS specification pattern where constraint T𝑇T specifies the trigger condition, A𝐴A the actions to be triggered, and R𝑅R the corresponding release condition for\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
