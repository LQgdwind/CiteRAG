      "content": "Paper Title: Skeleton-based Human Action Recognition via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nData augmentation is a well-established technique utilized to enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms by diversifying the training data. This approach involves synthesizing new samples from the existing training data by employing transformations such as scaling, rotation, translation, and other deformations. Adding these transformed samples to the training set can improve the generalization performance of the machine learning algorithm, making it more resilient to variations in the input data. Data augmentation is widely applied across several deep-learning tasks, including image classification, object detection, and natural language processing. On the other hand, Skeleton-based data augmentation is used explicitly for tasks involving 3D pose information, such as 3D human pose estimation. This approach involves transforming the 3D joint positions of a skeleton to generate new pose samples. Image-based data augmentation is utilized for tasks where the input data consists of images, including image classification and object detection. In this research, we investigated various image-based and skeleton-based techniques for data augmentation, as outlined in TABLE. Our approach is inspired by RandAugmentation [ref]34, which randomly injects the training pipeline with predefined augmentations based on the number and magnitude of augmentations to be applied. The Flipping Sequence augmentation technique, as described in [ref]35, involves the generation of synthetic pose sequences by horizontally flipping the input pose sequences. This is achieved through the reflection of the 3D joint positions across a horizontal plane when applied to skeleton data and by flipping in both the horizontal and vertical planes when applied to image data. As a result, a new pose sequence with actions performed in the opposite direction is produced. The Geometric Rotation augmentation, as discussed in [ref]34, generates new synthetic samples by applying random rotations to the input data. This is achieved by rotating the input images or 3D objects around a fixed point, utilizing a specified angle and center of rotation. The Cutout augmentation, as presented in , is a regularization technique utilized in deep learning. This technique involves randomly masking a portion of an image during the training process, which necessitates the model to learn to ignore these regions and focus on the remaining parts. This can enhance the modelâ€™s generalization to new data, thus improving its performance. Cutout augmentation is frequently adopted in image classification tasks, where it can aid the model in recognizing objects in images, despite variations in their appearance. It can be easily implemented in most deep learning frameworks as a simple and effective regularization method for deep learning models. The Zoom augmentation, as described in[ref]34, involves rescaling the input images or 3D objects using a specified zoom factor, which determines the extent of the zooming. This augmentation method is appropriate for both image and skeleton data. Additionally, the Shear augmentation, as discussed in Cubuk et al. (2020)[ref]34, is achieved through the utilization of a linear transformation that maps the x-axis or y-axis coordinates of the input data to new positions. The Translate augmentation, also presented in Cubuk et al. (2020)[ref]34, involves the shifting of the x-axis, y-axis, or both coordinates of the input data by a specified amount. The introduction of various types of noise to image data during training has been demonstrated to enhance the generalizability and robustness of machine learning models [ref]37. Salt-and-Pepper noise  is a form of noise that mimics the effect of corrupted or missing pixels in the input data. This is achieved by randomly setting a specified proportion of pixels to either the minimum or maximum intensity value, creating the appearance of salt and pepper grains on the image. The remaining pixels remain unaltered. Another noise-based augmentation strategy is Localvars noise [ref]37. This method generates random noise samples from a specified distribution. Speckle noise [ref]37 generates random noise samples from a Poisson distribution with a specified mean. In contrast, Gaussian noise [ref]37 generates random noise samples from a Gaussian distribution with a specified mean and standard deviation. In the context of skeleton data, Bone Shuffling augmentation is applied. This is achieved by randomly permuting the 3D joint positions of the skeleton, resulting in a new pose sequence in which a different body configuration performs the same actions. Additionally, Bone Masking augmentation is implemented by setting the 3D joint positions of the skeleton to zero for a randomly selected subset of bones. A similar technique can also be applied on the frame level rather than the bone level.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: and object detection.
