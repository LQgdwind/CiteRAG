      "content": "Paper Title: IV-GNN : Interval Valued Data Handling Using Graph Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning is a learning technique of the unknown structure of the input data distribution using multiple layers in the network . Encouraged by the commercial success of deep learning approaches in Euclidean structured data, a large number of methods has been introduced for Non-Euclidean data as well . Unlike Euclidean space, well-known properties like global parametrization, coordinate system, vector space structure of shift-invariance are not satisfied in Non-Euclidean space . Therefore, one of the key challenges was, to introduce the concept of convolution type operation in graphical data.\n\nGraph Neural Network model approaches can be classified into two categories, namely spectral-based and spatial-based methods .\nThe basic approach of spectral based GNN is to introduce filters from the graph signal processing perspective on a similar notion of the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) .\nHowever, due to high computational cost and lack of scalability, the relatively newer field of research, spatial-based GNN has gained popularity as they can handle large graphs by aggregating the neighbouring nodes. We overview few models with spatial-based approach here, One of the earliest work in this area, Graph Neural Network (GNN) [ref]3 recursively updates latent node representations by exchanging information with the neighbouring nodes, until equilibrium is reached. The recurrent function is chosen to be a contraction mapping to ensure convergence. Gated Graph Neural Networks (GGNN)  uses a gated recurrent unit as the recurrent function and use back-propagation through time (BPTT) for parameter learning. Hence, the condition on parameters to converge is no longer there, which reduces the number of steps. Stochastic Steady-State Embedding (SSE) [ref]22 uses a recurrent function that takes a weighted average of the states from previous steps and a new state to ensure the stability of the algorithm. GraphSage [ref]23 proposes a batch-training algorithm, which improves scalability for large graphs. It samples a fixed-sized neighbourhood of a node to aggregate information. Graph Isomorphism Network GIN  is one of the best performing models reported in the literature. It has been claimed that both the GIN and WL test are equally powerful in a graph classification task. It imposes a constraint on the functions used in the model to be injective to achieve the maximum representational power of a GNN. Higher order Graph Neural Network kùëòk-GNN  uses kùëòk-dimensional neighbourhood of a node to aggregate information from these and generate the low-dimensional representation for the mode. All of these above discussed GNN-architectures have one limitation in common; that they can only accept countable features. The categorical features can also be handled by these models by converting them to integer data using integer encoding or one-hot encoding. However, there are several instances as mentioned earlier, where it is more convenient to represent the feature as interval and treat interval as a single unit throughout the progress of the algorithm. Therefore, in this paper, a new interval aggregation scheme a‚Äãg‚Äãrn‚Äãe‚Äãwùëéùëîsubscriptùëüùëõùëíùë§agr_{new} has been introduced, satisfying all the necessary properties of a general aggregation function. Then, we have proposed Interval-Valued Graph Neural Network (IV-GNN) using a‚Äãg‚Äãrn‚Äãe‚Äãwùëéùëîsubscriptùëüùëõùëíùë§agr_{new} as aggregation operator, which can handle interval-valued features. We have performed graph classification tasks on four bioinformatics datasets, two social network datasets, and six synthetic datasets and have found that IV-GNN (with the proposed interval aggregation scheme) performs better than GNNs with various existing interval aggregation functions. Moreover, we demonstrate that our proposed model using degenerate interval-valued features (a special case of the more general IV-GNN model) outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, that accept only countable features, for the graph classification task.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: as they can handle large graphs by aggregating the neighbouring nodes.
