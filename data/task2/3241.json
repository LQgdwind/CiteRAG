      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey on Interpretable Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement learning (RL)  is a general machine learning framework for designing systems with automatic decision-making capabilities.\nResearch in RL has soared since its combination with deep learning, called deep RL (DRL), achieving several recent impressive successes (e.g., AlphaGo , video game [ref]3, or robotics [ref]4).\nThese attainments were made possible notably thanks to the introduction of the powerful approximation capability of deep learning and its adoption for sequential decision-making and adaptive control. However, this combination has simultaneously brought all the drawbacks of deep learning to RL.\nIndeed, as noticed by abundant recent work in DRL, policies learned using a DRL algorithm may suffer from various weaknesses, e.g.: They are generally hard to understand because of the blackbox nature of deep neural network architectures . They are difficult to train, require a large amount of data, and DRL experiments are often difficult to replicate . They may overfit the training environment and may not generalize well to new situations . Consequently, they may be unsafe and vulnerable to adversarial attacks . These observations reveal why DRL is currently not ready for real-world high-stake applications such as autonomous driving or healthcare, and explain why interpretable and explainable RL has recently become a very active research direction. For most of real-world deployments of RL algorithms, it is crucial that learned policies are intelligible as they\nprovide an answer (or a basis for an answer) to various concerns encompassing ethical, legal, operational, or usability viewpoints: When designing an autonomous system, it is essential to ensure that its behavior follows some ethical and fairness principles discussed and agreed upon beforehand by the stakeholders according to the context  0 1 2 3 4 5. The growing discussion about bias and fairness in machine learning 6 suggests that mitigating measures must be taken in every aspect of an RL methodology as well.\nIn this regard, intelligibility is essential to help assess the embedding of moral values into autonomous systems, and contextually evaluate and debate their equity and social impact.\n As autonomous systems start to be deployed, legal issues arise regarding notably safety 7, accountability 8 9, or privacy 0.\nFor instance, fully-autonomous driving cars should be permitted in the streets only once proven safe with high confidence.\nThe question of risk management 1 but also responsibility, in the case of an accident involving such systems, has become a more pressing and complex problem.\nVerification, accountability, but also privacy can only be ensured with more transparent systems. Since transparent systems are inspectable and verifiable, they can be examined before deployment to encourage that their decision-making is based on meaningful (ideally causal) relations and not on spurious features, ensuring higher reliability and increased robustness.\nFrom the vantage point of machine learning researchers or engineers, such systems have the advantage of being more easily debugged and corrected.\nMoreover, one may expect that such systems are easier to train, more data efficient, and more generalizable and transferable to new domains thanks to interpretability inductive biases. From an end-user’s point of view, interpretable and explainable models can form an essential component for building more interactive systems, where a user can request more information about the outcome or the decision-making process.In particular, explainable systems would arguably be more trustworthy, which is a key requirement for their integration and acceptance 2. Although the question of trust touches on many other contextual and non-epistemic factors (e.g., risk aversion or goal) beyond intelligibility.\n In addition to this high-level list of concerns, we refer the interested reader to 3 for a more thorough discussion about the potential societal impact of the deployment of deep RL-based systems.\nAlthough interpretability is a pertinent instrument to achieve more accountable AI-systems, the debate around their real-life implementation should stay active, and include diverse expertise from legal, ethical, and socio-political fields, whose coverage goes beyond the scope of this survey. Motivated by the importance of these concerns, the number of publications in DRL specifically tackling interpretability issues has increased significantly in recent years.\nThe surging popularity of this topic also explains the recent publication of three survey papers 4 5 6 on interpretable and explainable RL.\nIn 4 and 6, a short overview is provided with a limited scope, notably in terms of surveyed papers, while\n5 covers more studies, organized and categorized into explanation types.\nThe presentation of those surveys generally leans towards explainability as opposed to interpretability (see Section 3 for the definitions adopted in this survey) and focuses on understanding the decision-making part of RL. In contrast, this survey aims at providing a more comprehensive view of what may constitute interpretable RL, which we here specifically distinguish from explainable RL (see Section 3).\nIn particular, while decision-making is indeed an important aspect of RL, we believe that achieving interpretability in RL should involve a more encompassing discussion of every component involved in these algorithms, and should stand on three pillars:\ninterpretable inputs (e.g., percepts or other information provided to the agent), interpretable (transition/reward) models, and interpretable decision-making (policies or value functions). Based on this observation, we organize previous work that proposes methods for achieving greater interpretability in RL, along those three components, with an emphasis on deep RL papers published in the last 10 years.\nThus, in contrast to the previous three surveys, we cover additional work that belongs to interpretable RL such as relational RL or neuro-symbolic RL and also draw connections to other work that naturally falls in this designation, such as object-based RL, physics-based models, or logic-based task descriptions.\nOne goal of this proposal is to discuss the work in (deep) RL that is specifically identified as belonging to interpretable RL and to draw connections to previous work in RL that is related to interpretability.\nSince such latter work covers a very broad research space, we can only provide a succinct account for it. The remaining of this survey is organized as follows.\nIn the next section, we recall the necessary definitions and notions related to RL.\nNext, we discuss the definition of interpretability (and explainability) in the larger context of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (Section 3.1), and apply it in the context of RL (Section 3.2).\nIn the following sections, we present the studies related to interpretable inputs and models in Section 4 and Section 5 respectively.\nThe work tackling interpretable decision-making, which constitutes the core part of this survey, is discussed in Section 6.\nFor the sake of completeness, we also sketch a succinct review of explainable RL in Section 7, although this area has been more thoroughly explored in the existing literature.\nBased on this overview, in Section 8, we provide a list of open problems and future research directions, which we deemed particularly relevant.\nFinally, we conclude in Section 9.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: decision-making capabilities.\nResearch in RL has soared since its combination with deep learning, called deep RL (DRL), achieving several recent impressive successes (e.g., AlphaGo , video game [ref]3, or robotics [ref]4).\nThese attainments were made possible notably thanks to the introduction of the powerful approximation capability of deep learning and its adoption for sequential\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
