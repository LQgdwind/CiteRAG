      "content": "Paper Title: BAGM: A Backdoor Attack for Manipulating Text-to-Image Generative Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe latent diffusion model proposed by Rombach et al. in  exploits denoising autoencoders in a diffusion model to reduce the computational load, while simultaneously improving the fidelity of their text-to-image architecture, culminating in a high-resolution, state-of-the-art generative pipeline. The novelty comes in the separation of its process into two models. The auto-encoding model learns representations of a lower-dimensional latent space which provides freedom to the diffusion model to learn conceptual and semantic data compositions, resulting in improved image generation and more efficient computation . Brack et al. proposed a semantic guidance (SEGA) diffusion model [ref]21 that aims to provide flexibility and more control to users when generating images. SEGA interacts with the concepts already presented in the diffusion model’s latent space, allowing it to perform calculations during diffusion iterations [ref]21. The semantic guidance approach exploits multi-dimensional vector algebra, moving the unconditioned estimates towards the prompt-conditioned estimates depending on the editing direction. Through Saharia et al., Google introduced their photo-realistic, text-to-image diffusion model - Imagen [ref]15. Imagen contains a text encoder and cascading conditional diffusion models that converts the encoded text embeddings to high resolution image data. Imagen introduces a novel diffusion sampling technique called dynamic thresholding, which generates high quality images, leveraging high guidance weights [ref]15. The deep learning architecture deployed for the Imagen model is a variant of the popular U-Net architecture [ref]23. Inspired by Imagen, the DeepFloyd-IF pipeline  leverages a very similar, cascading architecture for text-to-image generation. Ramesh et al.  proposed a hierarchical, text-conditioned image generation architecture based on CLIP latents , with CLIP emerging as a popular representation learner for many text-to-image frameworks . The hierarchical image generation architecture contains decoder and encoder processes, allowing for the production of semantically similar output images . The encoder training process makes use of the CLIP framework to learn a joint representation of text and image representation spaces . The decoder processes the CLIP embedding outputs through a prior auto-regressive or diffusion model, which is then used to condition a diffusion decoder that synthesises the image . The stable diffusion model  is built on the foundational latent diffusion model work reported in , combined with inspiration from other conditional diffusion models including DALL-E 2 and Imagen [ref]15 . The stable diffusion model is trained on a subset of 512x512 captioned images from the large-scale, multimodal datset, LAION-5B  .\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: model to learn conceptual and semantic data compositions, resulting in improved image generation and more efficient computation .
