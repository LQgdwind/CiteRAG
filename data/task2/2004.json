      "content": "Paper Title: Understanding the Performance of Knowledge Graph Embeddings in Drug Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe task of discovering effective and safe drugs is a complex and interdisciplinary one, with many drugs failing in clinical trials before being able to help patients . Thus, the field is looking to leverage the large quantities of available data and information, much of which is inherently interconnected, to help improve the chances of a successful drug making it to market. Consequently, over recent years, an increasing number of Knowledge Graphs (KG) suitable for use within the drug discovery domain have been created [ref]17 , where drugs, genes and diseases are used as entities, with the interactions between them captured as relations. Several fundamental tasks within drug discovery can then be thought of as predicting the missing links between these entities – for example, drug repurposing can be considered as predicting missing links between drug and disease entities  or target discovery as identifying missing links between genes and diseases [ref]28. Naturally the family of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models (approaches which learn low dimensional representation of entities and relations which are trained to predict the plausibility of a given triple) have begun to be employed for these tasks. Perhaps unlike other domains, the predictions from such models are part of processes which can result in physical real-world experimentation being performed, and ultimately even clinical trials being undertaken – both with significant financial, regulatory and time costs associated, and more importantly impacting on the efforts to improve patient health. Therefore, there is an obvious need to ensure not only accurate predictions are being made but also that there is clear understanding of the various factors that can affect model predictive performance so that such predictions can be used effectively to derive impact and value. One other interesting aspect to consider is that these KGE models are typically not designed or tested against drug discovery datasets, so there is limited understanding about how they should be expected to perform in such cases. Indeed, recent work  has shown that biomedical knowledge graphs have markedly different topological structure to typical KG benchmark datasets such as FB15K-237 [ref]37 or WN18RR , displaying much greater average connectivity. Thus adding motivation for understanding how KGE models perform on such datasets. In this paper, we perform a detailed experimental study of various factors that can affect KGE model performance, using five model architectures (ComplEx , DistMult , RotatE , TransE  and TransH ) and two real-world drug discovery oriented KGs (Hetionet [ref]17 and BioKG ) with the goal of aiding better understanding, evaluation practices and reproducibility in the domain. The factors we investigate are the training setup of the model, the impact of changes in model hyperparameters, how model performance can be affected by both different random initialisations and changes in the train/test dataset splits and assessing performance on a domain specific task. All experiments are performed under a unified and consistent evaluation framework, on public data sources, using known best practices to ensure fair and reproducible comparisons. Additionally we release code to replicate our results111https://github.com/AstraZeneca/kgem-in-drug-discovery. Lastly, we note that the contribution of this work is not to achieve state-of-the-art results on a given dataset or even to decide upon the definitive choices for the various factors we are investigating, rather it is to highlight how these can affect overall predictive performance and to encourage further research and attention on such foundational topics. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to specifically focus on KGE model performance factors in the drug discovery domain.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: chances of a successful drug making it to market.
