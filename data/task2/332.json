      "content": "Paper Title: Constructing Geographic and Long-term Temporal Graph for Traffic Forecasting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraffic forecasting.\nTraffic forecasting is one of the most essential and challenging tasks in ITS and has attracted a lot of attention in the literature. Existing methods can be summarized into the following two categories. The first category is the classical statistical methods, such as ARIMA , KARIMA , SARIMA  and vector autoregression (VAR) .\nThese approaches are not satisfactory because the real-world traffic data can haldly satisfy the assumptions of these methods. The second category is the data-driven method.\nAmong the methods that fall into this category, traditional machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR)  , Bayesian approaches   and k-nearest neighbor (KNN)  , outperforms the first category. Nonetheless, traditional machine learning methods rely heavily on handcraft feature engineering and are not skilled in mining massive and complex data. Recently, due to the advance of deep learning in various domains   , deep learning based methods  [ref]7  [ref]6 are adept in capturing spatial-temporal dependences with large-scale datasets and become state-of-the-art.\nAmong these methods, relatively early dense networks for traffic forecasting contains deep belief network (DBN)  and stacked autoencoder  .  adopt the DBN at the bottom and a multitask (MTL)   regression layer at the top to take use of the sharing weights.\nCompared with the traditional machine learning methods, these methods which only analyse a single region each time  improve the accuracy of prediction, but the improvement is limited due to the lack of effective mining for spatiotemporal information.\nSome works    adopt CNN to capture the adjacent spatial correlation inspired by the rapid development of computer vision (CV) research .\nSome methods    mine the temporal dependencies mainly using RNN or its varieties which are famous for sequential prediction tasks. The varieties of RNN includes long short-term memory (LSTM)  and gated recurrent unit (GRU)  networks.\nAs traffic forecasting is a spatial-temporal data mining problem, the approach   combining CNN and RNN to model spatial-temporal correlations simultaneously get more accurate results for traffic forecasting.\nHowever, CNN are good at mining spatial relationships of data with the grid structure [ref]6 [ref]7 while the road network is the more complex graph-structured\ndata. Graph Convolutional Network.\nGraph convolution concentrates on generalizing convolution to work on structured graphs and analyze its local patterns. The graph convolution methods can be divided into two categories: the spectral methods and the spatial methods. The former methods [ref]41  are based on the spectral graph theory and [ref]41 proposes the Graph Laplacian.\n adopts Chebyshev polynomial approximation for eigenvalue decomposition, resulting in reduced computational complexity.\nThe latter spatial GCN    directly completes generalized convolution on a graph’s nodes with their neighboring nodes.\nThese methods are also known as adjacency matrix based GCN and the spectral methods can be regarded as a special case of the spatial GCN.\nThe spatial GCN incorporating the adjacency matrix is more flexible to be applied with other network structures, furthermore, it has more potential to dispose of relatively large graph structure. Therefore, we also choose the spatial GCN for GLT-GCRNN. The traffic road network can be considered as a graph naturally, thus some researchers are inspired to introduce graph convolutional network (GCN) to learn the road network spatial relationships and adopt RNN or 1D convolution along the time axis [ref]6 . These methods become state-of-the-art recently.   introduces the attention mechanism on the graph for GCN based traffic forecasting.\nNonetheless, the graph learned by GCN of most works is constructed entirely based on the geographic information, such as the distance and the connectivity of links.\n [ref]7 uses a temporal only graph in terms of links’ time series similarity by dynamic time warping algorithm.\nSelecting the neighborhood of nodes is of great importance for the spatial method of GCN , it is essential to construct comprehensive and appropriate graph for traffic forecasting in the same light.\nGLT-GCRNN presenting a novel geographic and long-term temporal (GLT) graph construction method for road network is of great research significance and potential.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: heavily on handcraft feature engineering and are not skilled in mining massive and complex data.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
