      "content": "Paper Title: DLT: Conditioned layout generation with Joint Discrete-Continuous Diffusion Layout Transformer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAn essential aspect of graphic design is layout creation: the arrangement and sizing of visual components on a canvas or document. A well-designed layout enables users to easily comprehend and efficiently interact with the information presented. The ability to generate high-quality layouts is crucial for a range of applications, including user interfaces for mobile apps and websites  and graphic design for information slides , magazines , scientific papers 0, infographics , and indoor scenes . To facilitate graphic design tasks, modelling approaches such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 8, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)  , and masking completion [ref]36 6  were explored for generating novel layouts. These approaches employ various architectures such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) , and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) 7. Recently proposed, Transformer-based approaches  [ref]36 6  have been shown to produce diverse and plausible layouts for a variety of applications and user requirements. Layouts are often represented as a set of components, each consisting of several attributes, such as class, position, and size 8. Inspired by recent advancements in NLP, a common practice is to model a component as a sequence of discrete attribute tokens, and a layout as the concatenation of all attribute tokens [ref]36  6. The model is trained using a self-supervised objective (either next-word completion or unmasking) to generate an output sequence. The discretization process is done by binning geometry attributes, such as position and size.\nHowever, using discrete tokens fails to take into account the natural representation of (geometry) data, which is continuous, and either result in poor resolution of layout composition, or in a large sparse vocabulary that is not covered well by smaller datasets. Providing controllable layout generation is crucial for many real-world graphic design applications that require user interaction. We would like to allow a user to fix certain component attributes, such as component class, or a set of components, and then generate the remaining attributes (position and size) or components. In recent iterative-based masking completion approaches 6, such conditioning is performed only during inference, in a way that does not provide the model with the ability to separate between the conditioned and generated parts of the layout during the iterative refinement. This lack of separation might lead to ambiguity in the generation process which can result in suboptimal performance. Diffusion models are a generative approach that has gained significant attention recently. Continuous diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in various tasks and domains, such as text-to-image , video generation 1, and audio . While diffusion models were extended to discrete spaces 1 , a challenge still remains on how to apply these models to generative tasks whose representation consists of both continuous and discrete features.\nIn this paper, we introduce a Diffusion Layout Transformer (DLT) for layout generation and flexible editing. Different from traditional diffusion models, we propose a novel framework based on a joint continuous-discrete diffusion process and provide theoretical justification for the derived optimization objective. Using a transformer-encoder architecture, we apply a diffusion process jointly both on the continuous attributes of the layout components (size and location) and on the discrete ones (class), as depicted in Figure 1. Our diffusion model addresses an important limitation of transformer-based models that rely on a discrete representation of the layout, which can lead to reduced resolution and limited diversity of layout compositions. Our framework offers flexible layout editing which allows for conditioning on any subset of the attributes of the layout components provided (class, size and location). Unlike masking completion approaches [ref]36 6 , which perform conditioning only during inference, and inspired by diffusion image inpainting techniques 4, we explicitly train the model to perform layout conditioning. We use condition embedding to control on which layout attributes to apply the diffusion process. In this way, the model is able to separate between the condition and the generation parts during the iterative refinement.\nOur experiments reveal that these design choices significantly improve the model’s performance compared to inference-based conditioning. We study the effectiveness of our DLT model by evaluating it on three popular layout datasets of diverse graphic design tasks over several common metrics. Using extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art layout generation models on layout synthesis and editing tasks while maintaining runtime complexity on par with these models. By comparing different alternatives, we show that both the joint diffusion process and the conditioning mechanism contribute to the model’s strong generative capabilities. Our joint discrete-continuous diffusion framework has a generic design and thus is applicable to other domains such as multi-modal generation tasks (text+image, text + audio, etc’).\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: , and indoor scenes .
