      "content": "Paper Title: Multimodal Representations Learning Based on Mutual Information Maximization and Minimization and Identity Embedding for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHuman perception of the world is naturally multimodal. In real life, there are three fundamental multimodal channels: text, audio and visual. The complex non-linear processing mechanism of human brain has the ability to mine modality-invariant information in these modalities, which can enhance the perception of human brain to the environments. Many literatures [ref]1  have demonstrated that combining multimodal channels will provide additional valuable information which is beneficial to the downstream tasks in computing intelligence scenarios. However, it is difficult for the existing computer system to map the multimodal data into a unified high-dimensional space to facilitate the system decision in the multimodal scenarios. Furthermore, many of these multimodal data often contain latent emotional elements which is a reflection of a person’s state of mind. Mining and recognizing these emotional elements is crucial for human-computer interaction [ref]3. Numerous researchers have devoted themselves to studying how to recognize the emotion category from multimodal data, and this research direction, namely multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA), has become a hot topic due to its great application potential in psychotherapy or discovering user intention. There are two points lie at the heart of MSA: One is bridging the heterogeneity gap between multimodal information resources and constructing a common cross-modal representation space, another is modeling the contextual information in the conversation sequence. For the former one, the most common method is to utilize the strong feature extraction ability of deep neural network to map the multimodal data into a feature space and manipulate the geometric property of feature spaces. Specifically, Zadeh et al. [ref]4 proposed Tensor Fusion Network (TFN) which operated a 3-fold Cartesian product between trimodal features. While TFN conducts numerous dot product operations in feature space resulting in an increase in computation. Therefore, Liu et al.  proposed Low-rank Multimodal Fusion (LMF) based on TFN and improved the calculation efficiency by decomposing the high-order tensors. Apart from manipulating geometric property, auxiliary loss is used to aid modal fusion. In particular,  proposed an autoencoder-based modal fusion method which combined reconstruction loss and canonical correlation analysis. Furthermore, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is also used in modal fusion. Sahu et al.  achieved cross-modal information interaction in an adversarial manner. One common characteristic of the methods mentioned above is that they construct a multimodal representation that can contain the intra-modal and cross-modal interactions. However, there are still challenges to be addressed: the multimodal representation must be robust enough to filter out the unexpected noise and the lack of overall control over information flow from input data till fusion results. The core of the latter one is utilizing the time clues in conversation sequence to improve the discrimination of the model. Early works mainly focused on how to model contextual information throughout the conversation. For instance, Hazarika et al.  exploited a skip attention mechanism to model the speaker’s memories which appeared in the historical conversation. Recent works attempted to model contextual information from more perspectives. Specifically, Majumder et al.  modeled the emotional dynamics from current speakers, contextual content and emotion states. Ghosal et al.  combined different commonsense knowledge to learn the interactions. These methods typically process features from different utterances to model the contextual information. However, this often brings a lot of extra computation and this problem becomes more serious in multimodal scenarios. Meanwhile, only focusing on the interaction between features of the deep layers will lose useful information in the shallow layers. To solve the aforementioned intractable problems and challenges, we propose a multimodal representation model based on Mutual information Maximization and Minimization and Identity Embedding (MMMIE) to learn multimodal representations for MSA. Firstly, to achieve sufficient modal fusion throughout the information flow, Mutual Information (MI) maximization is used to mine the modal-invariant information between different modal pairs and the intractability of MI is solved by using a lower bound estimation method based on neural network, namely MINE . Then, to improve the robustness of the model, we introduce the concept of minimal sufficient information (MSI) which means the model should extract as little information as possible from the input data and retain the task-related information. By limiting the amount of information, the model is prompted to pay more attention to useful information and avoid the influence of noise in redundant information on performance. The minimization of MI can be solved by an upper bound estimation method, namely Contrastive Log-ratio Upper Bound (CLUB) . In addition, for the contextual information, inspired by the position embedding proposed in Transformer , we propose Identity Embedding and add it to the features of each modality, then based on attention mechanism and LSTM , the contextual information can be modeled throughout the information flow. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated by comprehensive experiments on two large and widely used emotional datasets, i.e., the IEMOCAP  and the MELD . Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose a fusion method that combines mutual information maximization and minimization for multimodal sentiment analysis. By maximizing the MI between modal pairs and minimizing the MI between input data and corresponding features, the effectiveness of fusion can be improved and the robustness of the multimodal representations can be ensured. Identity embedding is proposed to model the contextual information in conversation sequence. Different from the previous work of operating on the feature space, the proposed method only needs a few trainable parameters, and benefits from the Transformer architecture, where contextual information can be prompted from shallow layers to deep layers of the network. Comprehensive experiments are designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Furthermore, comparable results to the state-of-the-art models are obtained on two public datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: processing mechanism of human brain has the ability to mine modality-invariant information in these modalities, which can enhance the perception of human brain to the environments.
