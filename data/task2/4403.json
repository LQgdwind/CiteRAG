      "content": "Paper Title: Improved mixing for the convex polygon triangulation flip walk1footnote 11footnote 1This paper subsumes a previous version of the same preprint, as well as parts of another, namely [18].\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe study of mixing times—the art and science of proving upper and lower bounds on the efficiency of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods—is a well-established area of research, of interest for combinatorial sampling problems, spin systems in statistical physics, probability, and the study of subset systems. Work in this area brings together techniques from spectral graph theory, combinatorics, and probability, and dates back decades; for a comprehensive survey of classic methods, results, and open questions see the canonical text by Levin, Wilmer, and Peres . Recent breakthroughs [ref]1 [ref]2  [ref]10    0—incorporating techniques from the theory of abstract simplicial complexes—have led to a recent slew of results for the mixing times of combinatorial chains for sampling independent sets, matchings, Ising model configurations, and a number of other structures in graphs, injecting renewed energy into an already active area. We focus on a class of geometric sampling problems that has received considerable attention from the counting and sampling   and mixing time 4 6 3  research communities over the last few decades, but for which tight bounds have been elusive: sampling triangulations. A triangulation is a maximal set of non-crossing edges connecting pairs of points (see Figure 1) in a given n𝑛n-point set. Every pair of triangles sharing an edge forms a quadrilateral. A triangulation flip consists of removing such an edge, and replacing it with the only other possible diagonal within the same quadrilateral. Flips give a natural Markov chain (the flip walk): one selects a uniformly random diagonal from a given triangulation and (if possible) flips the diagonal. McShine and Tetali gave a classic result in a 1997 paper 4, showing that in the special case of a convex two-dimensional point set (a convex n𝑛n-gon), the flip walk mixes (converges to approximately uniform) in time O​(n5​log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛5𝑛O(n^{5}\\log n), improving on the best-known prior (and first polynomial) upper bound, O​(n25)𝑂superscript𝑛25O(n^{25}), by Molloy, Reed, and Steiger 6. McShine and Tetali applied a Markov chain comparison technique due to Diaconis and Saloff-Coste  and to Randall and Tetali 9 to obtain their bound, using a bijection between triangulations and a structure known as Dyck paths. They noted that they could not improve on this bound using this bijection. Furthermore, they believed that an earlier lower bound of Ω​(n3/2)Ωsuperscript𝑛32\\Omega(n^{3/2}), also by Molloy, Reed, and Steiger 6, should be tight. We show the following result (see Section 3 for the precise definition of mixing time): The triangulation flip walk on the convex n+2𝑛2n+2-point set mixes in time O​(n3​log3⁡n).𝑂superscript𝑛3superscript3𝑛O(n^{3}\\log^{3}n). Prior to the present paper, no progress had been made either on upper or lower bounds for this chain in 25 years—even as new polynomial upper bounds and exponential lower bounds were given for other geometric chains, from lattice point set triangulations 3  to quadrangulations of planar maps , and despite many breakthroughs using the newer techniques for other problems. In addition to this specific result, we give a general decomposition theorem—which we will state as Theorem 4.2 once we have built up enough preliminaries, for bounding mixing times by recursively decomposing the state space of a Markov chain. This theorem is a purely combinatorial alternative to the spectral result of Jerrum, Son, Tetali, and Vigoda .\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: and probability, and dates back decades; for a comprehensive survey of classic methods, results, and open questions see the canonical text by Levin, Wilmer, and Peres .
