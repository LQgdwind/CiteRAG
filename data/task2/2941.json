      "content": "Paper Title: Diversity Enhanced Active Learning with Strictly Proper Scoring Rules\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe proposed BEMPS, as a general Bayesian model for acquisition functions,\nquantifies the model uncertainty using the theory of (strictly) proper scoring rules for categorical\nvariables .\nThus, we first review existing acquisition functions (aka query strategies)\nproposed in some recent AL models that are most related to ours, and\nrefer interested readers to  for\na comprehensive discussion of recent strategies.\nOne common and simple heuristic often used is maximum entropy    [ref]7,\nwhere one chooses samples that maximise the predictive entropy.\nBayesian AL by disagreement (BALD)  and its batch version (i.e.,\nBatchBALD) [ref]12 instead compute the mutual information between the model predictions\nand the model parameters, which indeed chooses samples that maximise the decrease in\nexpected entropy .\nRecently, inspired by the one-step-look-ahead strategy of ELR ,\nZhao et¬†al.  extended MOCU  to WMOCU with a theoretical guarantee of convergence.\nBut WMOCU only applies to errors which are less relevant for some inference tasks.\nBEMPS naturally extends those methods, focusing on Bayesian estimation\nof uncertainty related to the model‚Äôs expected proper score. Ensemble methods are used to obtain better uncertainty estimates with deep learning, including Monte-Carlo dropout (MC-dropout)  [ref]12  and\ndeep ensembles .\nMore sophisticated techniques are being developed, for instance, MCMC, hybrid and deterministic approaches  .\nHowever, plain ensembling remains a competitive and simple method for deep learning . Query strategies considering just uncertainty do not always work well in a batch setting, due to the highly similar samples acquired in a batch   .\nTo overcome this problem, there have been many AL methods that\nachieve batch diversity by acquiring samples that are both informative and diverse, such as    [ref]1   9.\nBADGE [ref]1 and ALPS \nare the two recent AL methods focusing on batch diversity.\nBADGE uses gradient embeddings of unlabelled samples as inputs of kùëòk-MEANS++ to select a set of diverse samples, which relies on fine-tuning pretrained language models.\nInstead of using gradient embeddings,\nALPS uses surprisal embeddings computed from\nthe predictive word probabilities generated by a masked language model for cold-start AL.\nWhereas our BEMPS computes for each unlabelled sample\na vector of expected change in the proper scores, relating directly to the performance. Other recent batch AL approaches, WAAL  and VAAL \nuse semi-supervised learning, for instance WAAL‚Äôs models are trained on the feature space obtained with the help of the unlabelled data.\nWe exclude these methods from our comparison since they are semi-supervised learning algorithms.\nBoth Core-set 6 and WAAL  also set up sophisticated\nnon-Bayesian cost functions using bounds to deal with the many unknown probabilities when trying\nto optimise for a batch, whereas the Bayesian formula of BEMPS can be directly\nestimated. In experimental work,\nthe use of a validation set to train deep learning models in active learning is not uncommon, the goal of which is to avoid over-fitting and achieve early-stopping.\nSome existing methods assume that there\nis a large validation set available a prior\n[ref]1 [ref]12 [ref]7,\nbut means the cost of labelling the set is not factored into the labelling budget.\nWe argue that the availability of a separate validation set is impractical\nin real world AL scenarios.\nAlthough\nYuan et¬†al.  use fixed epochs to train the classifier without a validation set to save the cost,\nthe classifier could either be under-fit or over-fit.\nWe instead use a dynamic approach to generate alternative validation sets\nfrom the ever increasing labelled pool after each iteration.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: recent AL models that are most related to ours, and\nrefer interested readers to  for\na comprehensive discussion of recent strategies.\nOne common and simple heuristic often used is maximum entropy    [ref]7,\nwhere one chooses samples that maximise the predictive entropy.\nBayesian AL by disagreement (BALD)  and its batch version (i.e.,\nBatchBALD) [ref]12 instead compute the mutual information\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
