      "content": "Paper Title: On the Interaction of Adaptive Population Control with Cumulative Step-Size Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEvolution Strategies (ES) have shown to be well-suited for the optimization of test functions subjected to strong noise or high multimodality with adequate global structure.\nThe crucial strategy parameter in both cases is the population size.\nOn noisy functions, such as the noisy sphere, large populations enable to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the ES and reduce the expected residual distance to the optimizer .\nFor well-structured highly multimodal problems, e.g., the Rastrigin function, they help to facilitate a global search, enabling to locate the global optimizer among exponentially many (in the dimensionality) local optima  .\nWhile models for the population sizing for an multi-recombinative ES on the Rastrigin function are derived in  , the results of  demonstrate the importance of tuning the population size for the highest efficiency on Rastrigin. Adaptive population control strategies (abbreviated as PCS) are able to adapt to both strong noise    and high multimodality  [ref]8 by increasing the population size when insufficient algorithm performance is detected.\nWhile benchmarks on the well-known Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) test bed  are available in many cases,\nan in-depth analysis of adaptive population control is still pending.\nFurthermore, PCS are often tuned for the underlying test bed, such that direct comparison between different methods turns out to be difficult in some cases.\nIn principle, adaptive population control can be implemented into any ES.\nState-of-the-art ES use covariance matrix adaptation (CMA) 0 for the search space distribution together with cumulative step-size adaptation (CSA) 1 2 for the global mutation strength.\nAs it turns out, there is significant dependence of the PCS performance on the underlying CMA- and CSA-parametrization.\nThis also holds among standard implementations of the CSA-ES, which will be shown.\nPopulation control cannot be studied isolated from the underlying mutation strength adaptation.\nA change of the population size usually results in changes of the mutation strength, which in turn influences the performance measure of the PCS.\nHence, three state-of-the-art PCS routines   [ref]8 will be selected that are suitable for both noisy and multimodal problems.\nThe PCS will incorporate performance measures both in search space and in fitness space, respectively.\nHowever, they will be investigated for isotropic mutations by using only the CSA-ES (without CMA) on a simple test bed.\nThe idea is to reduce the problem complexity and provide theoretical reasoning for the parameter choices.\nHence, adaptation time-scales and mutation strength rescaling are analyzed for CSA and PCS both theoretically and experimentally.\nThe obtained parametrization is then applied to all PCS, enabling a direct comparison of the methods for the first time.\nFurthermore, the influence of different CSA-variants on adaptive population control is illustrated. In the next Sec. section II, the adaptive population control routine is introduced, which is later investigated in Sec. section V.\nIn Sec. section III, preliminary theoretical results are derived which enable a better understanding the ES in the limit of large population sizes.\nIn Sec. section IV, a simple population change schedule is introduced to test the stability of the CSA.\nThen, the adaptive PCS are introduced and discussed in Sec. section V.\nFurthermore, their performances are compared and the influence of the CSA is discussed.\nFinally, conclusions are drawn in Sec. section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: of tuning the population size for the highest efficiency on Rastrigin.
