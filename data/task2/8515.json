Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: TINQ: Temporal Inconsistency Guided Blind Video Quality Assessment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBenchmark Datasets. We validate TINQ on both super-resolution and user-generated content distortions. For super-resolution, we employ VSR-QAD [ref]48, the only public SR VQA dataset, containing 120 reference videos downsampled by factors of ×2absent2\\times 2, ×4absent4\\times 4, and ×8absent8\\times 8, and upscaled by 10 SR algorithms, resulting in 2,260 videos after outlier filtering. For real world distortions, we use KoNViD-1K 7 (1,200 UGC videos) and LIVE-VQC [ref]33 (585 UGC videos with over 205,000 opinion scores). Competing Methods. For the SR scenario, we evaluate full-reference (FR) methods (PSNR, SSIM , VIF , VMAF , SRIF ), reduced-reference (RR) methods (SpEED-QA , IGTS , DISQ , DR-IQA , STF , VSR-QAD), and no-reference (NR) methods (DeepSRQ , VIDEVAL , VSFA , GSTVQA , STI-VQA 1, 2Bi-VQA , MBVQA ). Among them, SRIF, IGTS, DISQ, STF, DeepSRQ are SR IQA methods, and VSR-QAD is the first SR VQA method. For natural distortions, we use VSFA, TLVQM 9, VIDEVAL, VISION , SimpleVQA , VIQE , 2Bi-VQA, STFR, and MBVQA. Performance Criteria. We evaluate performance using Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (SRCC), Kendall rank-order correlation coefficient (KRCC), Pearson linear correlation coefficient (PLCC), and root mean square error (RMSE). For VSR-QAD, we follow its protocols: randomly splitting videos into 70%percent7070\\% training, 10%percent1010\\% validation, and 20%percent2020\\% testing. VSFA, 2Bi-VQA, and MBVQA are retrained, with other results cited from VSR-QAD. For UGC datasets, we split them into 60%percent6060\\% training, 20%percent2020\\% validation, and 20%percent2020\\% testing, repeating the process 10 times and reporting median results. Implementation Details. Models were trained for 100 epochs on an NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti with PyTorch 1.7.1.\nTemporal inconsistency videos guided both spatial and temporal modules during training, and were removed during testing. The Adam optimizer was used with an initial learning rate of 10−5superscript10510^{-5}, decaying by 0.8 every 10 epochs. Batch size was 16, with no weight decay. The loss combined SRCC and MSE to leverage both ranking and regression.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: Benchmark Datasets. We validate TINQ on both super-resolution and user-generated content distortions. For super-resolution, we employ VSR-QAD [ref]48, the only public SR VQA dataset, containing 120 reference videos downsampled by factors of ×2absent2\\times 2, ×4absent4\\times 4, and ×8absent8\\times 8, and upscaled by 10 SR algorithms,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
