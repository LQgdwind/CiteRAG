      "content": "Paper Title: DG-RePlAce: A Dataflow-Driven GPU-Accelerated Analytical Global Placement Framework for Machine Learning Accelerators\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGlobal placement is a fundamental step in VLSI physical design that determines the locations of standard cells and macros in a layout.\nThe backend design closure flow requires a fast placement engine for rapid design prototyping,\nfeeding back to synthesis, and guiding optimization.\nHowever, emerging machine learning accelerators\nhave introduced new challenges for global placement.\nOn the one hand, machine learning accelerators with millions of standard cells and macros\nraise runtime concerns for the design closure process.\nOn the other hand,\nmachine learning accelerators featuring 2D processing element (PE) arrays, such as\nsystolic arrays , have gained prominence because of their efficiency in convolutional neural network computations .\nThe dataflow and datapath architectures of these machine learning accelerators exhibit substantial differences compared to\nthose of traditional datapath designs,\nrequiring dedicated treatment during global placement to achieve decent Quality of Results (QoR). To address aspects of the aforementioned challenges,\nseveral global placers have been proposed over the past decades.\nTo improve runtime, researchers have focused on parallelizing global placement algorithms to\nleverage the computational substrates provided by multi-core CPUs and GPUs.\n introduces a multi-threaded shared-memory implementation of RePlAce  using off-the-shelf multi-core CPU hardware.\n and \npropose GPU-accelerated analytical placers by parallelizing the computation of the\nLogarithm-Sum-Exponential (LSE) wirelength function\nas well as the density function.\nRecently, DREAMPlace  \nand Xplace \nhave implemented the approach of RePlAce on GPU\nby casting the placement problem as a neural network training\nproblem; these works demonstrate the superiority\nof GPU-accelerated global placers.\nWhile DREAMPlace has already achieved\nsignificant runtime improvement relative to RePlAce, our aim is to push these boundaries even further by leveraging optimized data structures and a new parallel wirelength gradient computation algorithm. Other pioneering works\nexploit the dataflow and datapath structures during macro placement and global placement.\n and [ref]9\nexploit RTL information and dataflow to guide macro placement.\n integrates the dataflow information into the mixed analytical global placement framework through virtual objects.\nFurthermore,  introduces the first global placement framework that exploits the datapath regularity of 2D PE arrays.\nIn our present work, we propose a new, fast GPU-accelerated global placement framework, exploiting both dataflow information and datapath regularity.\nOur approach ultimately guides global placement towards better Quality of Results (QoR).\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows. We propose DG-RePlAce, a new and fast global placer that leverages the intrinsic dataflow and datapath structures of machine learning accelerators,\nto achieve high-quality global placement. DG-RePlAce is built on top of the OpenROAD infrastructure\nwith a permissive open-source license, enabling other\nresearchers to readily adapt it for other enhancements.111The source\ncodes are available in the DG-RePlAce GitHub repository 4. We propose efficient data structures and algorithms to further speed up the global placement. Experimental results on a variety of machine learning accelerators show that, our approach is respectively on average 22.49‚ÄãX22.49ùëã22.49X and 1.75‚ÄãX1.75ùëã1.75X faster\nthan RePlAce and DREAMPlace in terms of global placement runtime. Overall\nturnaround time is on par with that of DREAMPlace, despite (one-time) file\nIO runtime overheads that are due to OpenDB/OpenROAD integration. Experimental results using a variety of machine learning accelerators show that, compared with RePlAce and DREAMPlace, our approach achieves an average reduction in routed wirelength by 10%percent1010\\% and 7%percent77\\%, and total negative slack by 31%percent3131\\% and 34%percent3434\\%, respectively. Experimental results on the two largest TILOS MacroPlacement Benchmarks\n[ref]26 testcases show that compared with RePlAce and DREAMPlace,\nDG-RePlAce achieves much better timing metrics (WNS and TNS) measured post-route optimization. This suggests that the proposed dataflow-driven methodology is not limited to machine learning accelerators. The remaining sections are organized as follows.\nSection II introduces the terminology and background.\nSection III discusses our approach.\nSection IV shows experimental results,\nand Section V concludes the paper and\noutlines future research directions.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: data structures and a new parallel wirelength gradient computation algorithm.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
