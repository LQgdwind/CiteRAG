      "content": "Paper Title: Pruning and Quantization for Deep Neural Network Acceleration: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown extraordinary abilities in complicated applications such as image classification, object detection, voice synthesis, and semantic segmentation .\nRecent neural network designs with billions of parameters have demonstrated human-level capabilities but at the cost of significant computational complexity.\nDNNs with many parameters are also time-consuming to train [ref]26. These large networks are also difficult to deploy in embedded environments. Bandwidth becomes a limiting factor when moving weights and data between Compute Units (CUs) and memory. Over-parameterization is the property of a neural network where redundant neurons do not improve the accuracy of results. This redundancy can often be removed with little or no accuracy loss [ref]225. Figure¬†1 shows three design considerations that may contribute to over-parameterization: 1) network structure, 2) network optimization, and 3) hardware accelerator design. These design considerations are specific to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) but also generally relevant to DNNs. Network structure encompasses three parts: 1) novel components, 2) network architecture search, and 3) knowledge distillation. Novel components is the design of efficient blocks such as separable convolution, inception blocks, and residual blocks. They are discussed in Section¬†2.4. Network components also encompasses the types of connections within layers. Fully connected deep neural networks require N2superscriptùëÅ2N^{2} connections between neurons. Feed forward layers reduce connections by considering only connections in the forward path. This reduces the number of connections to NùëÅN. Other types of components such as dropout layers can reduce the number of connections even further. Network Architecture Search (NAS) , also known as network auto search, programmatically searches for a highly efficient network structure from a large predefined search space. An estimator is applied to each produced architecture. While time-consuming to compute, the final architecture often outperforms manually designed networks. Knowledge Distillation (KD)  [ref]206 evolved from knowledge transfer . The goal is to generate a simpler compressed model that functions as well as a larger model. KD trains a student network that tries to imitate a teacher network. The student network is usually but not always smaller and shallower than the teacher. The trained student model should be less computationally complex than the teacher. Network optimization  includes: 1) computational convolution optimization, 2) parameter factorization, 3) network pruning, and 4) network quantization.\nConvolution operations are more efficient than fully connected computations because they keep high dimensional information as a 3D tensor rather than flattening the tensors into vectors that removes the original spatial information. This feature helps CNNs to fit the underlying structure of image data in particular. Convolution layers also require significantly less coefficients compared to Fully Connected Layers (FCLs). Computational convolution optimizations include Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based convolution , Winograd convolution , and the popular image to column (im2col)  approach.\nWe discuss im2col in detail in Section¬†2.3 since it is directly related to general pruning techniques. Parameter factorization is a technique that decomposes higher-rank tensors into lower-rank tensors simplifying memory access and compressing model size.\nIt works by breaking large layers into many smaller ones, thereby reducing the number of computations.\nIt can be applied to both convolutional and fully connected layers.\nThis technique can also be applied with pruning and quantization.\n Network pruning     involves removing parameters that don‚Äôt impact network accuracy. Pruning can be performed in many ways and is described extensively in Section¬†3. Network quantization   involves replacing datatypes with reduced width datatypes. For example, replacing 32-bit Floating Point (FP32) with 8-bit Integers (INT8). The values can often be encoded to preserve more information than simple conversion. Quantization is described extensively in Section¬†4. Hardware accelerators   are designed primarily for network acceleration. At a high level they encompass entire processor platforms and often include hardware optimized for neural networks. Processor platforms include specialized Central Processing Unit (CPU) instructions, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). CPUs have been optimized with specialized Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) instructions usually within specialized Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) units  . While CPUs can be used for training, they have primarily been used for inference in systems that do not have specialized inference accelerators. GPUs have been used for both training and inference. nVidia has specialized tensor units incorporated into their GPUs that are optimized for neural network acceleration . AMD , ARM , and Imagination 7 also have GPUs with instructions for neural network acceleration. Specialized ASICs have also been designed for neural network acceleration. They typically target inference at the edge, in security cameras, or on mobile devices. Examples include: General Processor Technologies (GPT) , ARM, nVidia, and 60+ others  all have processors targeting this space. ASICs may also target both training and inference in datacenters. Tensor processing units (TPU) from Google 5, Habana from Intel , Kunlun from Baidu , Hanguang from Alibaba 4, and Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) from Graphcore 1. Programmable reconfigurable FPGAs have been used for neural network acceleration    . FPGAs are widely used by researchers due to long ASIC design cycles. Neural network libraries are available from Xilinx 8 and Intel .\nSpecific neural network accelerators are also being integrated into FPGA fabrics 8  . Because FPGAs operate at the gate level, they are often used in low-bit width and binary neural networks   . Neural network specific optimizations are typically incorporated into custom ASIC hardware. Lookup tables can be used to accelerate trigonometric activation functions 6 or directly generate results for low bit-width arithmetic , partial products can be stored in special registers and reused 8, and memory access ordering with specialized addressing hardware can all reduce the number of cycles to compute a neural network output 6. Hardware accelerators are not the primary focus of this paper. However, we do note hardware implementations that incorporate specific acceleration techniques.\nFurther background information on efficient processing and hardware implementations of DNNs can be found in [ref]225. We summarize our main contributions as follows:\n We provide a review of two network compression techniques: pruning and quantization. We discuss methods of compression, mathematical formulations, and compare current State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) compression methods. We classify pruning techniques into static and dynamic methods, depending if they are done offline or at runtime, respectively. We analyze and quantitatively compare quantization techniques and frameworks. We provide practical guidance on quantization and pruning. This paper focuses primarily on network optimization for convolutional neural networks. It is organized as follows: In Section¬†2 we give an introduction to neural networks and specifically convolutional neural networks. We also describe some of the network optimizations of convolutions. In Section¬†3 we describe both static and dynamic pruning techniques. In Section¬†4 we discuss quantization and its effect on accuracy. We also compare quantization libraries and frameworks. We then present quantized accuracy results for a number of common networks. We present conclusions and provide guidance on appropriate application use in Section¬†5. Finally, we present concluding comments in Section¬†7.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: designs with billions of parameters have demonstrated human-level capabilities but at the cost of significant computational complexity.\nDNNs with many parameters are also time-consuming to train [ref]26.
