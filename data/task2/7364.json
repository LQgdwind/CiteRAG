      "content": "Paper Title: A practical existence theorem for reduced order models based on convolutional autoencoders\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLet Ω⊂ℝdΩsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{d} be a bounded domain, and let be the parameter-to-solution map of a parametrized PDE, where Θ⊂ℝpΘsuperscriptℝ𝑝\\Theta\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{p} is the parameter space and Hs​(Ω)superscript𝐻𝑠ΩH^{s}(\\Omega) denotes a suitable Sobolev space with smoothness index s∈ℕ.𝑠ℕs\\in\\mathbb{N}. A classical numerical solver based on, e.g., finite elements or finite differences, provides access to pointwise approximations of the PDE solution over a collection of nodes 𝐱1,…,𝐱Nh∈Ω¯,subscript𝐱1…subscript𝐱subscript𝑁ℎ¯Ω\\mathbf{x}_{1},\\dots,\\mathbf{x}_{N_{h}}\\in\\overline{\\Omega}, with Nhsubscript𝑁ℎN_{h} being the total number of vertices constituting the spatial grid. Therefore, we can think of the numerical solver, also referred to as Full Order Model (FOM) in the reduced order modeling literature, as a map The purpose of DL-ROMs is to construct a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model Φ:ℝp→ℝNh:Φ→superscriptℝ𝑝superscriptℝsubscript𝑁ℎ\\Phi:\\mathbb{R}^{p}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{N_{h}} such that Φj​(𝝁)≈u𝝁​(𝐱j)subscriptΦ𝑗𝝁subscript𝑢𝝁subscript𝐱𝑗\\Phi_{j}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu})\\approx u_{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(\\mathbf{x}_{j}), where ΦjsubscriptΦ𝑗\\Phi_{j} denotes the j𝑗jth output neuron of ΦΦ\\Phi. In the case of autoencoder-based approaches, the construction of ΦΦ\\Phi relies on three neural network models, namely, The first two models, the encoder and the decoder, respectively, are trained such that In this way, by leveraging the autoencoder Ψ∘Ψ′ΨsuperscriptΨ′\\Psi\\circ\\Psi^{\\prime}, the spatial features characterizing the solutions to the PDE can be synthesized using a smaller number of degrees of freedom, known as the “latent” variables. In fact, each discrete vector 𝐮𝝁:=[u𝝁​(𝐱1),…,u𝝁​(𝐱Nh)]⊤assignsubscript𝐮𝝁superscriptsubscript𝑢𝝁subscript𝐱1…subscript𝑢𝝁subscript𝐱subscript𝑁ℎtop\\mathbf{u}_{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}:=[u_{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(\\mathbf{x}_{1}),\\dots,u_{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(\\mathbf{x}_{N_{h}})]^{\\top} can now be represented as Ψ′​(𝐮𝝁)∈ℝmsuperscriptΨ′subscript𝐮𝝁superscriptℝ𝑚\\Psi^{\\prime}(\\mathbf{u}_{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}, with a substantial reduction in complexity whenever m≪Nh.much-less-than𝑚subscript𝑁ℎm\\ll N_{h}. Conversely, the third network, ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi, sometimes also referred to as reduced network, is trained to learn the parameter-to-latent-variables map, Once all DNN modules have been trained, the encoder block Ψ′superscriptΨ′\\Psi^{\\prime} can be discarded and the DL-ROM constructed by composition, i.e., Given a new parametric instance 𝝁∈Θ𝝁Θ\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\in\\Theta, the reduced network computes the corresponding latent solution, namely ϕ​(𝝁)italic-ϕ𝝁\\phi(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}), which is then expanded by the decoder to retrieve the final output.\nIn other words, methods based on autoencoders are grounded on the idea of splitting the complexity of the problem into two components. On the one hand, we have the spatial complexity of PDE solutions, tackled by Ψ′superscriptΨ′\\Psi^{\\prime} and ΨΨ\\Psi. On the other hand, there is the inherent complexity associated with the parameter dependence of PDE solutions, addressed by ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi. The existing literature provides insights on the choice of the latent dimension m𝑚m (see, e.g., 9) and on the type of architectures, favoring the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)—whenever possible—for the decoder module (see, e.g., 8). It is worth mentioning that, while the works 8 9 are purely theoretical, their conclusions are perfectly aligned with empirical evidence. In fact, researchers had long conjectured that autoencoders could compress solutions to their intrinsic dimension, dictated by the number of parameters  [ref]30. Similarly, by leveraging the heuristic observation that discrete signals defined over hypercubic domains are roughly equivalent to RGB images, several authors had suggested the use of CNNs for the autoencoder module  . Nonetheless, little is know about the training of these architectures, in terms of, e.g., sample size and choice of the loss function. Our main contribution, which is fully detailed in Theorem 1, goes precisely in this direction. Given a probability distribution ϱitalic-ϱ\\varrho over the parameter space, for each of the three architectures, ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi, ΨΨ\\Psi and Ψ′superscriptΨ′\\Psi^{\\prime}, we identify a specific class of neural network models, with the decoder ΨΨ\\Psi being convolutional, such that, with high probability, the trained DL-ROM satisfies an error bound of the form where m𝑚m is (proportional to) the latent dimension, N~~𝑁\\tilde{N} is the sample size (up to log factors) and C𝐶C is a constant that depends on the solution operator (recall that p𝑝p and s𝑠s are the number of parameters and the smoothness of the PDE solutions, respectively). In doing so, we also specify the sampling and the optimization procedure associated with the reduced network ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi, identifying a specific loss function and a corresponding regularization criterion, thus making our existence result practical. Note that, although based on the same ideas presented in , our result is somewhat stronger. In fact, with respect to the space variable 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}, it provides a uniform error bound, as opposed to a space-averaged one. At its core, our derivation leverages the theory of sparse polynomial approximation of high-dimensional, holomorphic maps, and thus relies on the assumption that the parameter-to-solution map admits a suitable holomorphic extension. However, as we will explore later, this assumption is not overly restrictive. In fact, there are numerous practical cases where this condition holds true, such as the parametric diffusion equation, for which an application of Theorem 1 is explicitly discussed in Section 3.1. Finally, we mention that our analysis is limited to the one-dimensional case, d=1𝑑1d=1. Generalizations to higher-dimensional domains are in order but out of the scope of this work.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: perfectly aligned with empirical evidence.
