      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Representation Learning for Road Type Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Convolutional Networks (GCN) are a recent generation of approaches, which represent every node of a graph as a function of its neighborhood   . Learning node representations has three important advantages. First is its computational efficiency as a result of sharing network parameters, second is the integration of nodes attributes to generate information about their positions and roles in the graph, and third is the generalization of learned knowledge to the unseen nodes and graphs. Aggregating the information of a local node neighborhood instead of the entire graph will therefore help to address the limitations of approaches relying on shallow embedding   and the ones using deep auto-encoders  . Similar to GCN, GraphSAGE [ref]27 applies convolutional mechanism to train a set of aggregator functions in order to learn aggregated information of a local neighborhood. GraphSAGE can leverage node features in order to learn an embedding function, which generalizes to unseen nodes or graphs. However, GraphSAGE and GCN differ in the aggregation as well as vector combination methods they apply. An attention based graph convolutional approach, Graph Attention Network (GAT) [ref]21 operates on graph-structured data using masked self-attention layers to improve the performance of prior graph convolution based methods. The gated attention network (GaAN) [ref]41, on the other hand, applies a convolutional sub-network to control the importance of attention head based on a number of gates. The more recent, Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN)  models injective multiset functions for neighborhood aggregation by developing a theory of “deep multi-sets”, which parametrizes universal multi-set functions using neural networks such as multi-layer perceptrons, MLP. GIN applies SUM aggregators to implement injective and universal functions over the multi-sets. Using recent graph representation learning approaches such as GraphSAGE [ref]27, GAT [ref]21, GaAN [ref]41, and GIN , a node learns representation by aggregating the information of nodes sampled from its local neighborhood through a certain number of hops, where one hop is moving one layer forward from a node. Learning graph structure using local neighborhood aggregation, however, is not capable of integrating edge features in graph representation learning as algorithms rely on node features only. However, in road network graphs, edge features are more descriptive and could play a significant role in learning representations. To address this issue, representation fusion of nodes, edges, and between-edges, the Relational Fusion Network (RFN) citejepsen2020relational for road network graphs is proposed. RFN uses both primal and dual graphs where dual graph nodes and edges represent primal graph edges and between-edges, respectively. Applying relational fusion, RFN addresses speed limit classification and speed limit estimation problems in an inductive supervised setting using binary classification. Similar to RFN , we apply dual graph in our experiments, however, we use exclusively dual graph generated by line graph transformation of the original graph in order to make use of informative road segment attributes in learning representations and, therefore, we do not make use of original graph in our analysis. To the best of our knowledge, the basic approach to generate line graph in this article is similar to the one used in dual graph presented in . Moreover, in contrast to RFN, which only addresses speed limit classification and estimation in an inductive supervised setting using binary classes, our experiments explore the four major tasks of multi-class road type classification in unsupervised and supervised transductive as well as inductive settings. A more detailed description of experimental setup used by RFN in comparison to ours is presented in section 4.2.2. The unsupervised classification of road networks is an important problem since completing missing labels is logistically demanding and expensive task. In OSMnx , labels are frequently left out or road types are miss-labeled. Especially the inductive setting allows training on high-quality densely labeled road network and transferring this knowledge onto more sparsely labeled road networks. Furthermore, this article proposes a novel approach, GAIN to aggregating knowledge for learning representations used to address road type classification problem. However, GAIN could be applied to learning representations of any types of graphs and not just road type graphs and, therefore, any classification task could be addressed using the same approach. To enhance learning representations, we also propose sampling from a topological neighborhood composed of both local (GraphSAGE [ref]27) and global neighbor nodes by applying a new search mechanism presented in Section 3.3. This facilitates using relevant information of the neighbor nodes in further distances to a node.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: instead of the entire graph will therefore help to address the limitations of approaches relying on shallow embedding   and the ones using deep auto-encoders  .
