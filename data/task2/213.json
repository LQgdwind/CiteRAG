This has generated a growing interest to develop large-scale distributed machine learning paradigms . In this regard, the edge computing paradigm provides the underlying infrastructure that empowers regional learning or device learning at the networkâ€™s edge. However, traditional learning approaches cannot be readily applied to a large-scale distributed learning system. One promising approach to build a large-scale distributed learning system is through the use of the emerging federated learning (FL) framework . In FL, on-device learning agents collaboratively train a global learning model without sharing their local datasets. The global model at the central server allows the local model to improve the learning performance of each agent; however, iteratively updating the global model based on the aggregation of local models can also have a negative impact on the personalized performance . For example, in a supervised FL setting, the local model is optimized to fit the local dataset, whereas the global model is built on the simple aggregation of local learning parameters (e.g., FedAvg , FedProx [ref]13) so as to perform well on the distributed dataset. In practice, local datasets collected by each agent are unbalanced, statistically heterogeneous, and exhibit non-i.i.d (non-independent and non-identically distributed) characteristics. Thus, the global model of FL can become biased and strongly affected by the agents who have more data samples or by those who perform larger update steps during the aggregation of local model parameters. Consequently, beyond a certain threshold value of training rounds, the generalized global model can negatively affect the personalized performance of several learning agents .\nHence, the conventional FL cannot efficiently handle the underlying cohesive relation between the generalization and personalization (or specialization) abilities of the learning model in the testing and validation phase . This raises an important, fundamental research question: How can one resolve the discrepancies between global and personalized accuracy?\nTo answer this question and overcome the aforementioned limitations of existing FL frameworks, we seek to develop a novel design philosophy which can be widely used for future large-scale distributed learning systems.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the work in  was the first attempt to study and improve the personalized performance of FL using a so-called personalized federated averaging (Per-FedAvg) algorithm based on MLF. However, in  the cohesive relation between the generalization and personalization were not adequately analyzed. Recent work in [ref]15 developed an analysis for the personalization in FL applications using three approaches, such as hypothesis-based clustering, data interpolation, and model interpolation.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: in a supervised FL setting, the local model is optimized to fit the local dataset, whereas the global model is built on the simple aggregation of local learning parameters (e.g., FedAvg , FedProx [ref]13) so as to perform well on the distributed dataset.
