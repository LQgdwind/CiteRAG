      "content": "Paper Title: Conflict-Averse Gradient Descent for Multi-task Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMulti-task learning (MTL) refers to learning a single model that can tackle multiple different tasks [ref]11   8. By sharing parameters across tasks, MTL methods learn more efficiently with an overall smaller model size compared to learning with separate models 8  . Moreover, it has been shown that MTL could in principle improve the quality of the learned representation and therefore benefit individual tasks   . For example, an early MTL result by  demonstrated that training a neural network to recognize doors could be improved by simultaneously training it to recognize doorknobs. However, learning multiple tasks simultaneously can be a challenging optimization problem because it involves multiple objectives 8. The most popular MTL objective in practice is the average loss over all tasks. Even when this average loss is exactly the true objective (as opposed to only caring about a single task as in the door/doorknob example), directly optimizing the average loss could lead to undesirable performance, e.g. the optimizer struggles to make progress so the learning performance significantly deteriorates. A known cause of this phenomenon is the conflicting gradients [ref]41: gradients from different tasks 1) may have varying scales with the largest gradient dominating the update, and 2) may point in different directions so that directly optimizing the average loss can be quite detrimental to a specific task’s performance. To address this problem, previous work either adaptively re-weights the objectives of each task based on heuristics   or seeks a better update vector 0 [ref]41 by manipulating the task gradients. However, existing work often lacks convergence guarantees or only provably converges to any point on the Pareto set of the objectives. This means the final convergence point of these methods may largely depend on the initial model parameters. As a result, it is possible that these methods over-optimize one objective while overlooking the others (See Fig. 1). Motivated by the limitation of current methods, we introduce Conflict-Averse Gradient descent (CAGrad), which reduces the conflict among gradients and still provably converges to a minimum of the average loss. The idea of CAGrad is simple: it looks for an update vector that maximizes the worst local improvement of any objective in a neighborhood of the average gradient. In this way, CAGrad automatically balances different objectives and smoothly converges to an optimal point of the average loss. Specifically, we show that vanilla gradient descent (GD) and the multiple gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) are special cases of CAGrad (See Sec. 3.1). We demonstrate that CAGrad can improve over prior state-of-the-art gradient manipulation methods on a series of challenging multi-task supervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning problems.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: Multi-task learning (MTL) refers to learning a single model that can tackle multiple different tasks [ref]11   8.
