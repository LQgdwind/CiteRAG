Contrastive language-image pre-training, or CLIP in short, is a cross-modal model trained to match the most relevant text to an image. Developed by Radford et al. and trained on a large-scale dataset - approximately 4√ó1084superscript1084\\times 10^{8} image-text pairs - CLIP has proven to have powerful zero-shot capabilities; meaning that it performs well on tasks and domains that it was not explicitly trained for.\nIn our study, we first perform an experiment using CLIP ViT-B/32 on the NewsCLIPings datasets, in order to compare our training pipeline with \nbut we also utilize the updated and improved444https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/clip-ViT-L-14 CLIP ViT-L/14 version in the comparative study.\nCLIP ViT-B/32 produces an embeddings vector of size e=512ùëí512e=512 while ViT-L/14 produces e=768ùëí768e=768.\nWe use CLIP off-the-shelf555https://github.com/openai/CLIP and do not fine-tune it further\ndue to computational resource constraints. Luo et al. experimented with fine-tuning the whole or the top layers of CLIP-ResNet-50, but their results were mixed; fine-tuning could not consistently outperform the ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù, off-the-shelf, CLIP in all cases. There have been proposed methods for robustly fine-tuning large-scale cross-modal neural networks  but they are outside the scope of this study; since we do not attempt to reach the highest possible performance but primarily focus on providing a fair comparative study of various Synthetic Misinformers.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: and captions that will be used to train the Detector.\nThe first works on MMD mostly relied on convolutional neural networks pre-trained on ImageNet to extract features from images (namely VGG-19 [ref]8 [ref]11 and ResNet50  ) and word embeddings to extract features from captions (namely word2vec [ref]8 [ref]11 and fastText ).\nMore recent approaches, have utilized large-scale multimodal and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
