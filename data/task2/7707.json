      "content": "Paper Title: Evaluatology: The Science and Engineering of Evaluation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExperimental methodologies are widely used in the fields of social sciences, computer sciences, psychology, and medicine. Evaluations in the field of social sciences: According to Rossi et al., ¬†[ref]30, at the earliest, Thomas Hobbes and his contemporaries tried to \"use numerical measures to assess social conditions and identify the cause of mortality, morbidity, and social disorganization in the discipline of social science.\" Rossi et al.¬†¬†[ref]30 define program evaluation as the process of using social research methods to systematically assess programs aimed at \"improving social conditions and our individual and collective well-being,\" with the goal of providing answers to the stakeholders.\nRossi et al.¬†¬†[ref]30 summarize the five domains of evaluation questions and methods that exhibit strong interplays: (1) the need for the programs, (2) program theory and design, (3) program process, (4) program impacts, and (5) program efficiency. Evaluations in the Field of Computer Science: The SPEC CPU benchmark suite, known as SPEC CPU¬†, is widely recognized as the most renowned benchmark suite for CPU performance evaluation. Throughout its history, six versions of the SPEC CPU benchmark suite have been released, with the latest version being SPEC CPU2017, which can be found in Table¬†1. The SPEC CPU workloads cover a broad range of CPU-intensive tasks. The performance evaluation metric used in SPECCPU is based on the execution time. The reported score of SPECCPU represents the ratio of its execution time compared to that of a reference machine. The specific details of a reference machine can be found in Table¬†1. To ensure the credibility of the results, the overall metrics are calculated as the geometric mean of each respective ratio. Each ratio is based on the median execution time from three runs or the slower of the two runs. Dongarra et al.¬† proposed the LINPACK benchmark for evaluating high-performance computing (HPC) systems. The LINPACK Benchmark is designed to solve dense linear systems of equations of order n, represented by the equation A‚Äãx=bùê¥ùë•ùëèAx=b. It originated from the development of the LINPACK software package in the 1970s. The LINPACK benchmark is commonly used to evaluate HPC systems, and the measurement metric is the number of floating-point operations per second (FLOPS). FLOPS represents the count of floating-point operations (FLOPs) performed by the solving algorithm of the LINPACK benchmark, which is calculated as (2‚àón3/3+2‚àón22superscriptùëõ332superscriptùëõ22*n^{3}/3+2*n^{2}) operations divided by the execution time of the benchmark. The LINPACK benchmark is also used by the TOP500 list of the world‚Äôs most powerful supercomputers to rank their performance. As shown in Figure¬†14, ImageNet is a significant benchmark in the field of computer vision, consisting of 14,197,122 high-resolution images manually annotated across 21,841 distinct categories, commonly known as ImageNet-21K¬†. These categories encompass a wide range of objects, animals, and scenes. The ILSVRC (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge) is an annual computer vision competition that focuses on a subset of ImageNet-21K called ImageNet-1K¬†. It aims to evaluate the performance of deep learning models in tasks such as image classification and object detection, providing specific task configurations and evaluation criteria. ImageNet-1K is primarily used for image classification tasks and consists of 1,281,167 training images, 50,000 validation images, and 100,000 test images. The evaluation metrics commonly used in ILSVRC include Top-1 accuracy, which measures the match between the predicted category and the true category of the image, and Top-5 accuracy, which indicates if the true category of the image is among the top five predicted categories by the model. Evaluations in the field of medicine: The evaluation in the field of medicine can be traced back to the early medical eras, although there are no documented records. A rigorous modern medical evaluation methodology and system were established as early as 1938¬†. Clinical trials, with a history spanning over 250 years, are the primary and widely recognized method for medical evaluation. They are defined as experimental designs to evaluate the potential impact of medical interventions on human subjects¬†. Currently, clinical trials based on experimental designs can be categorized into various types, including randomized trials, double-blind trials, prospective trials, and retrospective trials¬†. As illustrated in Figure¬†15, Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), considered the gold standard for medical evaluation, possess a rigorous and reliable theoretical framework¬†. However, their high time and financial costs limit their application. To compensate for the shortcomings of RCTs, emerging clinical evaluation methods, such as Real-World Data (RWD) assessment and digital clinical trials, have been proposed¬† . These novel medical assessments are still in their early stages and have noticeable deficiencies in their theoretical foundations, such as lacking rigor and reliability. Evaluations in the field of psychology: In the field of psychology, social and personality psychologists often rely on scales, such as psychological inventories, tests, or questionnaires¬†, to evaluate psychometric variables¬†. These variables include attitudes, traits, self-concept, self-evaluation, beliefs, abilities, motivations, goals, social perceptions, and more¬†. It is important to note that cognitive biases, which are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment¬†, may introduce distortions in self-report style evaluations.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Experimental methodologies are widely used in the fields of social sciences, computer sciences, psychology, and medicine.
