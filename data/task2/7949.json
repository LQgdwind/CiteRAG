      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Video Summarization via Reinforcement Learning and a Trained Evaluator\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost unsupervised video summarization algorithms adhere to the principle that a video summary should enable a viewer to understand the original content of the video with less effort, time, and resources [ref]13  [ref]21      [ref]27. These algorithms employ Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to generate a summary that encapsulates the essence of the video. Unsupervised video summarization algorithms based on GAN typically utilize three units: a summarizer, a generator, and a discriminator. The summarizer generates the summary from the input video by assigning importance scores to the frames and selecting only the high-scoring frames to form a video snippet. The generator creates two new video representations from the video summary and the original input video. These new representations are expected to be similar in content and style. The discriminator evaluates the generator’s outputs and attempts to identify which one was based on the summary. The use of an adversarial learning process to train a keyframe selector based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was pioneered by [ref]13. Subsequent works have focused on improving that method through various modifications such as creating a more robust discriminator to retain as much information as possible in a video’s summary [ref]21, modifying the loss functions and optimization steps , and adding a video decomposition stage, which breaks each video into smaller and non-overlapping chunks of consecutive frames with uniformly sampled strides before feeding them to the summarizer network . Further improvements were made by adding a frame score refinement stage to the summarizer’s output  . This included the use of an attention module that progressively edits each frame’s score based on current and previous frames , and the addition of an Actor-Critic model that adjusted the frames’ scores in a non-sequential order based on past and future frames and previously made adjustments . The advantage of using GAN for unsupervised video summarization is in its ability to generate more diverse, realistic summaries that match the input video content and style. However, there are also some drawbacks. One is the complexity of the training procedure as it involves multiple models with different objectives and losses . Balancing and coordinating the training of these models to ensure their convergence and stability are challenging . Other issues such as mode collapse, vanishing gradients, or oscillation could cause training instabilities  . Also, another drawback is that GAN may not capture some important aspects of video summarization, such as temporal coherence . Therefore, some approaches have used reinforcement learning with custom reward functions to overcome the above mentioned issues    . A custom reward function measures specific properties required in an optimal video summary, such as diversity, representativeness, smoothness, and sparsity. A two-part reward function called Diversity-Representativeness was suggested in  that measured diversity by examining differences between frames of the summarized video and representativeness by comparing the selected frames to the entire video. The aim was to train a model that created a summary of diverse and representative frames from different parts of the video. The use of Diversity-Representativeness became so prominent that it was even added to the optimization process of the summarizer in the GAN-based methods . Alternatively, the use of graph neural networks was proposed as another way to avoid adversarial training . This method built a graph representation of the input video and used the node feature magnitude to generate hard assignments for the summary selection. Many video summarization methods mentioned above use LSTM-based models and therefore could have problems such as vanishing and exploding gradients . To address these challenges, some unsupervised video summarization methods have incorporated self-attention modules or transformer encoders  into their LSTM-based models   [ref]27 . Others have exclusively utilized transformer encoders  . These strategies primarily concentrate on substituting LSTM-based models with self-attention encoders. Despite these modifications, these methods continue to employ reward-based training, utilizing traditional rewards such as representativeness/diversity and length regularization cost  . Our training pipeline shares similarities with the reinforcement learning approach outlined in . However, a crucial distinction lies in the utilization of a learned reward function instead of handcrafted ones. The core of the proposed learned reward function is a model that is trained during a self-supervised learning stage. This stage employs a novel dynamic window masking algorithm, which signifies our self-supervised learning stage from the one in . Additional explanation regarding our methodology is presented in the following section.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: unsupervised video summarization algorithms adhere to the principle that a video summary should enable a viewer to understand the original content of the video with less effort, time, and resources [ref]13  [ref]21      [ref]27.
