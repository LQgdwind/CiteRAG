      "content": "Paper Title: TSkips: Efficiency Through Explicit Temporal Delay Connections in Spiking Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSpiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a class of bio-physically realistic models with Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)¬† neurons that offer a promising alternative for processing sequential data. By encoding information in the precise timing of spikes, SNNs capture spatio-temporal dependencies¬† [ref]7 through the membrane potential of their LIF neurons. This intrinsic ability to process temporal information allows SNNs to excel at capturing dynamic patterns, effectively functioning as specialized RNNs¬† with reduced complexity. The ability of SNNs to leverage the precise timing of spikes offers a distinct advantage over traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for sequential tasks. Note, ANNs are ‚Äústateless‚Äù in nature¬†5 and their reliance on specially curated input encoding schemes¬†  hinder their ability to accurately capture precise timing information crucial in event streams, as generated by Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS)¬† . Standard Recurrent Neural Networks (vRNNs)¬†7 and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks¬†9 0 attempt to address this, but remain difficult to train¬† and computationally expensive. Furthermore, transformers and spiking transformers¬†  excel at sequential processing but come at the cost of significantly larger models and computational overhead. Deep SNNs offer the appealing combination of rich temporal information processing and computational efficiency, but training them effectively presents unique challenges¬†5. The combination of multiple time steps with Back Propagation through Time (BPTT), non-differentiable spikes and sparse event data can worsen the vanishing spike problem¬†. To circumvent this, previous works have proposed adaptive LIF neurons with trainable threshold and leak¬†[ref]29 and approximate surrogate gradients¬†1 . Other works¬†  6 have considered synaptic delays as an additional parameter alongside weights, thus offering a richer representation of the spike patterns present in event data. We posit that these learnable synaptic delays only capture spatio-temporal patterns over a short window of time. Note, however, event data for speech recognition and optical flow also have long-term temporal dependencies that need to be captured through better spike representation. In contrast, this work introduces explicit temporal delays in forward and backward skip connections, named temporal skips (TSkips), for SNNs and hybrid ANN-SNN  models.\nTSkips offer finer control over spike timing, enhance responsiveness to temporal patterns, mitigate vanishing spikes, all while capturing long-term spatio-temporal dependencies for event-based data. In addition, our method utilizes adaptive LIF neurons¬†[ref]29 that have learnable leaks and thresholds that capture local temporal patterns. The next question to address would be, what are the optimal TSkip configurations within the network architecture and what are the corresponding temporal delays associated with them? To efficiently identify optimal TSkip configurations across different architectures and sequence lengths, we leverage training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) tailored for SNNs¬†. TSkips introduces minimal increase in model size with very few additional trainable parameters, minimal overhead and improves inference on event-based tasks. In addition, we have observed that training time is faster for the proposed networks compared to standard SNNs, RNNs and LSTMs. The contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: We introduce TSkips, a novel mechanism that enhances SNNs and hybrid ANN-SNN architectures by enabling direct transmission of spike information between non-adjacent layers with temporal delays, effectively capturing long-term spatio-temporal patterns.\n(Section¬†3) We analyzed various TSkip configurations, revealing the complexities of the search space, particularly the interplay between the temporal delay (Œî‚Äãt)Œîùë°(\\Delta t), TSkip position and network depth. This complexity motivated the use of NAS to efficiently identify optimal TSkip architectures. (Section¬†4.2) We show that TSkips achieves strong performance across sequential tasks. On the DSEC-flow dataset, they reduce average endpoint error (AEE) and inference energy, up to 18% and 56%, respectively, as shown in Fig.¬†1. Furthermore, TSkips achievess significant accuracy improvements on DVS128 Gesture, SHD and SSC datasets ‚Äî¬†up to 8.3%, 8.6% and 16.04%, respectively. This highlights the scalability and effectiveness of our approach across diverse sequential tasks and architectures.
