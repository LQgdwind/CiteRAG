In fact, in many real-world problems, both the state and action spaces are continuous. Naturally, the Lipschitz assumptions hold. This means that when similar actions follow similar states, their effects will be similar. Thus, numerous studies have focused on the smoothness of the policy and value functions by introducing Lipschitz constraints. For policy smoothness, researchers   proposed temporal and spatial smoothness regularization terms to penalize policies when actions taken on the next state were significantly dissimilar from actions taken on the current state. Besides, related work  has studied how to automatically set a proper step size along the gradient direction for ensuring Lipschitz w.r.t. policy parameters. For the value function, one line of investigation focuses on Lipschitz continuity of the value function to obtain regret upper bounds   or upper bounds of action-value function’s Lipschitz constant w.r.t. different components [ref]2. However, as discussed in a previous study [ref]20, overly strong Lipschitz constraints can cause the policy to lose its state-dependent adaptive behaviors. A more recent line of work focuses on the local Lipschitz continuous constraint [ref]20 [ref]2  [ref]39. The most closely related prior work to our method is by Wang et al. [ref]39, which derived a model-inferred upper bound of Q-function’s Lipschitz constant w.r.t. input actions. This approach was costly due to the necessity of large-scale data to approximate the environment dynamics. Our work aims to estimate the upper bound w.r.t. input states, freeing itself from dependence on models.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: line of investigation focuses on Lipschitz continuity of the value function to obtain regret upper bounds   or upper bounds of action-value function’s Lipschitz constant w.r.t. different components [ref]2.
