Instruction Curation.\nTo improve model performance after instruction tuning, some relevant works manage to filter low-quality instruction data or construct carefully curated examples during the fine-tuning stage, thereby enhancing model capabilities.\nLIMA  shows that fine-tuning a strong pre-trained language model on 1000 human curated and high-quality examples can produce remarkable, competitive results on a wide range of prompts.\nSeveral recent works  [ref]16  have developed instruction quality evaluation methods for measuring the quality of vision or language datasets, such as computing the perplexity, calculating the gradient, and acquiring ChatGPT for rating, to filter low-quality data for training.\nIn particular, Instruction Mining [ref]16 proposes a linear rule for selecting high-quality instruction data, which does not require human annotation in LIMA.\nUnlike the aforementioned works in a single modal, InstructionGPT-4 is the first multimodal large language model that achieves better performance through effective data selection. In contrast to Instruction Mining [ref]16, our work aims to present a more general data quality evaluation pipeline and train a robust data selector to automatically select proper data from the raw dataset used during fine-tuning.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: set of research, including FLAN , InstructGPT , and ChatGPT.\nInspired by this, several recent works aim at enabling LLMs to handle multimodal tasks with visual instruction tuning, such as MiniGPT-4 [ref]1, LLaVA , LLaMA-Adapter 9 and InstructBLIP [ref]9.\nThese works choose linear projection layers as the bridges between image encoders and LLMs, and perform visual instruction tuning either on\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
