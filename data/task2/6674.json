A QBAF is a quadruple 𝒬=⟨𝒜,ℛ−,ℛ+,τ⟩𝒬𝒜superscriptℛsuperscriptℛ𝜏\\mathcal{Q}=\\left\\langle\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{R}^{-},\\mathcal{R}^{+},\\tau\\right\\rangle, where 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is the set of arguments; ℛ−superscriptℛ\\mathcal{R}^{-} is the attack relation (ℛ−⊆𝒜×𝒜superscriptℛ𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{R}^{-}\\subseteq\\mathcal{A}\\times\\mathcal{A}); ℛ+superscriptℛ\\mathcal{R}^{+} is the support relation (ℛ+⊆𝒜×𝒜superscriptℛ𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{R}^{+}\\subseteq\\mathcal{A}\\times\\mathcal{A}); ℛ−superscriptℛ\\mathcal{R}^{-} and ℛ+superscriptℛ\\mathcal{R}^{+} are disjoint; τ𝜏\\tau is the base score (τ:𝒜→ [ref]1:𝜏→𝒜01\\tau\\!:\\!\\mathcal{A}\\!\\rightarrow\\! [ref]1). We often denote the structure of QBAFs graphically, where nodes\nrepresent the arguments and edges the support and\nattack relations. We label edges in attack and support relations with −- and\n++, respectively. Figure 2 shows an example.\nA QBAF is called acyclic if the corresponding graph is acyclic.\nAs in 8, we restrict attention to acyclic QBAFs. The dialectical strength of arguments in QBAFs can be evaluated by several gradual semantics\nσ:𝒜→ [ref]1:𝜎→𝒜01\\sigma:\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow [ref]1,\ne.g. as defined in   2 4.\nThe explainability of some gradual semantics like the h-categorizer semantics  and the counting semantics 6 has been studied in .\nIn this paper, we focus on explaining the DF-QuAD gradual semantics 8. This problem has been neglected in the literature so far even though DF-QuAD has broad applicability 8     in settings where explainability is important. In DF-QuAD, for any argument A𝐴A, σ​(A)𝜎𝐴\\sigma(A) is defined as follows: where vA​asubscript𝑣𝐴𝑎v_{Aa} is the aggregation strength of all the attackers against A𝐴A, while vA​ssubscript𝑣𝐴𝑠v_{As} is the aggregation strength of all the supporters for A𝐴A.\nvA​asubscript𝑣𝐴𝑎v_{Aa} and vA​ssubscript𝑣𝐴𝑠v_{As} are defined as follows: An example of applying DF-QuAD is as follows. Consider the acyclic QBAF 𝒬=⟨𝒜,ℛ−,ℛ+,τ⟩𝒬𝒜superscriptℛsuperscriptℛ𝜏\\mathcal{Q}=\\left\\langle\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{R}^{-},\\mathcal{R}^{+},\\tau\\right\\rangle with arguments and relations\nas in Figure 2 and\nτ​(X)=0.5𝜏𝑋0.5\\tau(X)=0.5 for all X∈𝒜𝑋𝒜X\\!\\in\\!\\mathcal{A}.\nIt is easy to see that\nvA​a=0.375subscript𝑣𝐴𝑎0.375v_{Aa}=0.375, vA​s=0.125subscript𝑣𝐴𝑠0.125v_{As}=0.125, vB​a=vB​s=0subscript𝑣𝐵𝑎subscript𝑣𝐵𝑠0v_{Ba}=v_{Bs}=0, vC​a=0.5subscript𝑣𝐶𝑎0.5v_{Ca}=0.5, vC​s=0subscript𝑣𝐶𝑠0v_{Cs}=0, vD​a=0.25subscript𝑣𝐷𝑎0.25v_{Da}=0.25, vD​s=0subscript𝑣𝐷𝑠0v_{Ds}=0, vF​a=0subscript𝑣𝐹𝑎0v_{Fa}=0, vF​s=0.5subscript𝑣𝐹𝑠0.5v_{Fs}=0.5, vG​a=0.75subscript𝑣𝐺𝑎0.75v_{Ga}=0.75, vG​s=0subscript𝑣𝐺𝑠0v_{Gs}=0.\nThen, σ​(A)=0.375𝜎𝐴0.375\\sigma(A)=0.375, σ​(B)=0.5𝜎𝐵0.5\\sigma(B)=0.5, σ​(C)=0.25𝜎𝐶0.25\\sigma(C)=0.25, σ​(D)=0.375𝜎𝐷0.375\\sigma(D)=0.375, σ​(F)=0.75𝜎𝐹0.75\\sigma(F)=0.75, σ​(G)=0.125.𝜎𝐺0.125\\sigma(G)=0.125.
