      "content": "Paper Title: Beyond Low-pass Filtering: Graph Convolutional Networks with Automatic Filtering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe study of graph convolutional networks is rooted in graph signal processing or spectral graph theory . By defining the graph Fourier transform and the inverse graph Fourier transform of a graph signal, the convolution between a graph signal and a filter can be derived by the convolution theorem where the Fourier transform of the convolution of two signals equals the elementwise product of their Fourier transforms. With this theorem, Bruna et al.  defined graph convolutional filters as functions of eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian matrix. Eigendecomposition of a graph Laplacian matrix is computationally expensive. To bypass this bottleneck, Defferrard et al. [ref]20 showed that a filter function defined on the eigenvalues is equivalent to the same function defined on the graph Laplacian matrix. Based on this result, various of filter functions which are defined on the graph Laplacian matrix directly have been proposed such as Chebyshev polynomials [ref]20, a first-order approximation of Chebyshev polynomials [ref]21, and Cayley polynomials . Besides graph Fourier transform, another line of works defines graph convolution through graph wavelet transform  . These methods are localized in the vertex domain and do not require eigendecomposition as well. However, complex operations on the graph Laplacian matrix still impede model efficiency due to higher-order computation. Concurrently, despite graph convolution, message passing has mostly dominated the recent development of graph neural networks due to its efficiency, generality, and flexibility. The basic idea is to propagate graph signals along with graph structures. By iterating the propagation step multiple times, a node can broaden its neighborhood to the entire graph. Earlier schemes of graph message passing follow the recurrent architecture, where the parameters are shared across multiple propagation steps   . These methods update node states recursively until steady states are reached. On the other side, compositional schemes modularize message passing as a neural network layer to improve model pluggability and capacity . Gilmer et al.  formalized the message passing framework with two components, a propagator and a updator. The propagator summarizes information for a node based on its neighborhood context. The updator transforms the collected information with learnable parameters. The most intuitive propagate function is the mean function, which takes the average of the center node information and its neighborhood information. Various improvements are made over the mean aggregate function by refining edge weights through normalization [ref]21 and diffusion , assigning learnable weights to neighbors  , introducing a scalar parameter to pass graph isomorphism test , teleporting back to a nodeâ€™s initial information to avoid the over-smoothing problem . In addition, the expressive power of most GNNs are upbounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) graph isomorphism test. Some recent works are able to surpass this limitation  [ref]39. The over-smoothing problem is studied in depth by [ref]39 and . They introduced decoupling mechanisms and identity mapping respectively. Some other advanced works focus on designing complex architectures of graph neural networks by increasing network depth and receptive field size   . Graph neural networks based on message passing do not consider spectral properties of the message passing operations, namely graph convolution. Wu et al.  proved that stacking multiple GCN with identity activation is a low-pass filter. Balcilar et al.  showed that most graph neural networks are essentially low-pass filters. \nIn parallel to graph convolution transforms, graph wavelet transforms decompose graph signals in multi-scale  . These works also consider the high-frequency part of graph signals, but they lack the ability to automatically adjust the bandwidth of graph signals based on data.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: filters as functions of eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian matrix.
