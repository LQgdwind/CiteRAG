      "content": "Paper Title: Reasoning with fuzzy and uncertain evidence using epistemic random fuzzy sets: general framework and practical models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEpistemic random fuzzy sets naturally arise in the context of statistical inference. As proposed by Shafer  and formally justified in [ref]8, the information conveyed by the likelihood function in statistical inference problems can be represented by a consonant belief function, whose contour function is equal to the relative likelihood function. For a statistical model f​(𝒙,θ)𝑓𝒙𝜃f({\\boldsymbol{x}},\\theta), where 𝒙∈𝒳𝒙𝒳{\\boldsymbol{x}}\\in{\\cal X} is the observation and θ∈Θ𝜃Θ\\theta\\in\\Theta is the unknown parameter, the likelihood-based belief function B​e​l​(⋅,𝒙)𝐵𝑒𝑙⋅𝒙Bel(\\cdot,{\\boldsymbol{x}}) on ΘΘ\\Theta after observing 𝒙𝒙{\\boldsymbol{x}} is, thus, consonant and defined by the contour function where L​(⋅,𝒙):θ→f​(𝒙;θ):𝐿⋅𝒙→𝜃𝑓𝒙𝜃L(\\cdot,{\\boldsymbol{x}}):\\theta\\rightarrow f({\\boldsymbol{x}};\\theta) is the likelihood function, and it is assumed that the denominator in (21) is finite. The corresponding plausibility function is, thus, defined by for any A⊂Θ𝐴ΘA\\subset\\Theta, i.e., it is a possibility measure. However, as noticed by Shafer in  and , and also discussed in , this construction is not compatible with Dempster’s rule: if we consider two independent observations 𝒙𝒙{\\boldsymbol{x}} and 𝒙′superscript𝒙′{\\boldsymbol{x}}^{\\prime}, the belief function B​e​l​(⋅;𝒙,𝒙′)𝐵𝑒𝑙⋅𝒙superscript𝒙′Bel(\\cdot;{\\boldsymbol{x}},{\\boldsymbol{x}}^{\\prime}) is not equal to the orthogonal sum B​e​l​(⋅;𝒙)⊕B​e​l​(⋅;𝒙′)direct-sum𝐵𝑒𝑙⋅𝒙𝐵𝑒𝑙⋅superscript𝒙′Bel(\\cdot;{\\boldsymbol{x}})\\oplus Bel(\\cdot;{\\boldsymbol{x}}^{\\prime}), which is not consonant. As argued in , this problem disappears if we do not consider the likelihood-based belief function to be induced by a consonant random crisp set, but by a constant random fuzzy set θ~𝒙subscript~𝜃𝒙{\\widetilde{\\theta}}_{\\boldsymbol{x}} with membership function θ~𝒙​(θ)=p​l​(θ;𝒙)subscript~𝜃𝒙𝜃𝑝𝑙𝜃𝒙{\\widetilde{\\theta}}_{\\boldsymbol{x}}(\\theta)=pl(\\theta;{\\boldsymbol{x}}). We can interpret θ~𝒙subscript~𝜃𝒙{\\widetilde{\\theta}}_{\\boldsymbol{x}} as the fuzzy set of likely values of θ𝜃\\theta after observing 𝒙𝒙{\\boldsymbol{x}}.\nCombining the contour functions (21) by the normalized product intersection rule then yields the correct result, i.e., the constant random fuzzy set θ~𝒙,𝒙′subscript~𝜃𝒙superscript𝒙′{\\widetilde{\\theta}}_{{\\boldsymbol{x}},{\\boldsymbol{x}}^{\\prime}} with membership function θ~𝒙,𝒙′​(θ)=θ~𝒙​(θ)⊙θ~𝒙′​(θ)subscript~𝜃𝒙superscript𝒙′𝜃⊙subscript~𝜃𝒙𝜃subscript~𝜃superscript𝒙′𝜃{\\widetilde{\\theta}}_{{\\boldsymbol{x}},{\\boldsymbol{x}}^{\\prime}}(\\theta)={\\widetilde{\\theta}}_{\\boldsymbol{x}}(\\theta)\\varodot{\\widetilde{\\theta}}_{{\\boldsymbol{x}}^{\\prime}}(\\theta). Now, consider a prediction problem, where we want to predict the value of a random variable Y𝑌Y whose distribution also depends on θ𝜃\\theta. We can always write Y𝑌Y in the form Y=φ​(θ,U)𝑌𝜑𝜃𝑈Y=\\varphi(\\theta,U), where U𝑈U is a pivotal random variable with known distribution  . After observing the data 𝒙𝒙{\\boldsymbol{x}}, our knowledge of θ𝜃\\theta is represented by the fuzzy set θ~𝒙subscript~𝜃𝒙{\\widetilde{\\theta}}_{\\boldsymbol{x}}. Conditionally on U=u𝑈𝑢U=u, our knowledge of Y𝑌Y is, thus, represented by the fuzzy set Y~​(u)=φ​(θ~𝒙,u)~𝑌𝑢𝜑subscript~𝜃𝒙𝑢{\\widetilde{Y}}(u)=\\varphi({\\widetilde{\\theta}}_{\\boldsymbol{x}},u), with membership function The mapping Y~:u→Y~​(u):~𝑌→𝑢~𝑌𝑢{\\widetilde{Y}}:u\\rightarrow{\\widetilde{Y}}(u) is, then, a random fuzzy set representing statistical evidence about Y𝑌Y. Let 𝐗=(X1,…,Xn)𝐗subscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑛{\\boldsymbol{X}}=(X_{1},\\ldots,X_{n}) be an independent and identically distributed (iid) Gaussian sample with parent distribution N​(θ,1)𝑁𝜃1N(\\theta,1), and let Y∼N​(θ,1)similar-to𝑌𝑁𝜃1Y\\sim N(\\theta,1). After observing a realization 𝐱𝐱{\\boldsymbol{x}} of 𝐗𝐗{\\boldsymbol{X}}, the likelihood function is Denoting by θ^^𝜃\\widehat{\\theta} the sample mean, the fuzzy set θ~𝐱subscript~𝜃𝐱{\\widetilde{\\theta}}_{\\boldsymbol{x}} of likely values of θ𝜃\\theta after observing 𝐱𝐱{\\boldsymbol{x}} is the relative likelihood It is the Gaussian fuzzy number GFN​(θ^,n)GFN^𝜃𝑛\\textsf{GFN}(\\widehat{\\theta},n) with mode θ^^𝜃\\widehat{\\theta} and precision n𝑛n. Now, Y𝑌Y can be written as Y=θ+U𝑌𝜃𝑈Y=\\theta+U, with U∼N​(0,1)similar-to𝑈𝑁01U\\sim N(0,1). Consequently, the conditional possibility distribution on Y𝑌Y given U=u𝑈𝑢U=u is the Gaussian fuzzy number θ~𝐱+u=GFN​(θ^+u,n)subscript~𝜃𝐱𝑢GFN^𝜃𝑢𝑛{\\widetilde{\\theta}}_{\\boldsymbol{x}}+u=\\textsf{GFN}(\\widehat{\\theta}+u,n), and our knowledge of Y𝑌Y is described by the random fuzzy set U→GFN​(θ^+U,n)→𝑈GFN^𝜃𝑈𝑛U\\rightarrow\\textsf{GFN}(\\widehat{\\theta}+U,n), with U∼N​(0,1)similar-to𝑈𝑁01U\\sim N(0,1). This is a Gaussian fuzzy number with fixed precision h=nℎ𝑛h=n and normal random mode M=θ^+U∼N​(θ^,1)𝑀^𝜃𝑈similar-to𝑁^𝜃1M=\\widehat{\\theta}+U\\sim N(\\widehat{\\theta},1). This important class of random fuzzy sets will be studied in the next section.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Epistemic random fuzzy sets naturally arise in the context of statistical inference.
