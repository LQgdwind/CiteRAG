      "content": "Paper Title: Truss-based Structural Diversity Search in Large Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the literature, there exist a large number of studies on k𝑘k-truss mining and indexing. As a cohesive subgraph, k𝑘k-truss requires that each edge has at least (k−2)𝑘2(k-2) triangles within this subgraph . Interestingly, several equivalent concepts of k𝑘k-truss termed as different names are independently studied. For example, k𝑘k-truss has been named as the k𝑘k-dense community  , k𝑘k-mutual-friend subgraph , k𝑘k-brace , and triangle k𝑘k-core . The task of truss decomposition is to find the non-empty k𝑘k-truss for all possible k𝑘k’s in a graph. Wang and Cheng  propose a fast in-memory algorithm for truss decomposition. In addition, truss decomposition has also been studied in various computing settings (e.g., external-memory algorithms , MapReduce algorithms  , and shared-memory parallel systems ) and different types of graphs (e.g., uncertain graphs   , directed graphs [ref]36, and dynamic graphs  ).\n\n\nRecently, several community models are built on the k𝑘k-truss    3.\nMeanwhile, a number of k𝑘k-truss-based indexes (e.g., TCP-index  and Equi-Truss ) are proposed for another problem of community search, which supports the efficient retrieval of communities.\nA detailed comparison of truss-based indexes is made below. Truss-based Index Comparison.\nWe introduce and compare three different indexes based on k𝑘k-truss, including our 𝖳𝖲𝖣𝖳𝖲𝖣\\mathsf{TSD}-𝗂𝗇𝖽𝖾𝗑𝗂𝗇𝖽𝖾𝗑\\mathsf{index}, TCP-index , and Equi-Truss . Among them,\nTCP-index and Equi-Truss are developed for k𝑘k-truss community search . A k𝑘k-truss community is a maximal connected k𝑘k-truss such that all edges are triangle connected via a series of adjacent triangles within this community. Huang et al.  proposes a tree-shaped structure of TCP-index for efficiently finding k𝑘k-truss communities. To speed up the discovery of k𝑘k-truss communities, Akbas and Zhao  propose a novel indexing technique of Equi-Truss by compressing TCP-index into a more compact structure. Specifically, the major differences of our 𝖳𝖲𝖣𝖳𝖲𝖣\\mathsf{TSD}-𝗂𝗇𝖽𝖾𝗑𝗂𝗇𝖽𝖾𝗑\\mathsf{index} in contrast to state-of-the-art TCP-index  and Equi-Truss  are listed as follows. First, TCP-index and Equi-Truss take the global trussness and triangle connectivity on the whole graph into consideration, while TSD-index only focuses on the local neighborhood induced subgraph without considering the triangle constraint. Second, the index construction of 𝖳𝖲𝖣𝖳𝖲𝖣\\mathsf{TSD}-𝗂𝗇𝖽𝖾𝗑𝗂𝗇𝖽𝖾𝗑\\mathsf{index} costs much more expensive than those of TCP-index and Equi-Truss, in terms of their time complexities  . Last but not least, 𝖳𝖲𝖣𝖳𝖲𝖣\\mathsf{TSD}-𝗂𝗇𝖽𝖾𝗑𝗂𝗇𝖽𝖾𝗑\\mathsf{index} and TCP-index have tree-shaped structures with different edge weights, and more importantly the meaning of edge weights are substantially different. For example, Figure 18(a) shows the graph G𝐺G. Consider a vertex q1subscript𝑞1q_{1} in G𝐺G, Figures 18(b) and 18(c) respectively show the corresponding TCP-index of q1subscript𝑞1q_{1} and 𝖳𝖲𝖣𝖳𝖲𝖣\\mathsf{TSD}-index of q1subscript𝑞1q_{1}. All edges have different weights in two indexes in Figures 18(b) and 18(c). Consider an edge (q2,q3)subscript𝑞2subscript𝑞3(q_{2},q_{3}) of the TCP-index in Figure 18(b), indicates that (q2,q3)subscript𝑞2subscript𝑞3(q_{2},q_{3}) will be involved in a 4-truss community as the global graph G𝐺G. However, the edge (q2,q3)subscript𝑞2subscript𝑞3(q_{2},q_{3}) of the 𝖳𝖲𝖣𝖳𝖲𝖣\\mathsf{TSD}-𝗂𝗇𝖽𝖾𝗑𝗂𝗇𝖽𝖾𝗑\\mathsf{index} in Figure 18(c), indicates that (q2,q3)subscript𝑞2subscript𝑞3(q_{2},q_{3}) will be involved in a maximal connected 2-truss in the 𝖾𝗀𝗈𝖾𝗀𝗈\\mathsf{ego}-𝗇𝖾𝗍𝗐𝗈𝗋𝗄𝗇𝖾𝗍𝗐𝗈𝗋𝗄\\mathsf{network} GN​(q1)subscript𝐺𝑁subscript𝑞1G_{N(q_{1})}. In contrast to the above studies, k𝑘k-truss-based structural diversity search is firstly studied in this paper. Leveraging the micro-network analysis of 𝖾𝗀𝗈𝖾𝗀𝗈\\mathsf{ego}-𝗇𝖾𝗍𝗐𝗈𝗋𝗄𝗌𝗇𝖾𝗍𝗐𝗈𝗋𝗄𝗌\\mathsf{networks}, we propose a novel tree-shaped structure of 𝖳𝖲𝖣𝖳𝖲𝖣\\mathsf{TSD}-𝗂𝗇𝖽𝖾𝗑𝗂𝗇𝖽𝖾𝗑\\mathsf{index} and efficient algorithms to address our problem.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: various computing settings (e.g., external-memory algorithms , MapReduce algorithms  , and shared-memory parallel systems ) and different types of graphs (e.g., uncertain graphs   , directed graphs [ref]36, and dynamic graphs  ).\n\n\nRecently, several community models are built on the k𝑘k-truss    3.\nMeanwhile, a number of k𝑘k-truss-based indexes (e.g., TCP-index  and Equi-Truss ) are proposed\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
