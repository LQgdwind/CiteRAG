      "content": "Paper Title: Modeling Human Driver Interactions Using an Infinite Policy Space Through Gaussian Processes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere is a considerable body of work in human driver modeling in terms of state estimation, trait estimation, intention estimation, motion prediction or anomaly detection . The proposed approach in this paper is related to the context of trait estimation where the style of the driver is attempted to be extracted. Several solutions for these problems are introduced in the literature. Among these, Naive Bayes models , gaussian mixture models , markov chain models , markov state space models , optimal control based models , inverse reinforcement learning based models , , Gaussian Process based models , , [ref]29, , game theoretical approaches , , , , Gated Recurrent Unit based models , joint use of recurrent and convolutional neural networks , joint use of recurrent and generative networks , and joint use of generative networks and imitation learning  can be counted. In recent years, a new method combining level-kùëòk game theoretical approach with reinforcement learning is proposed and used in several modeling domains , [ref]6, , [ref]40, , , . This method distinguishes itself from others by its ability to model several (>100) agents as strategic decision makers, simultaneously, instead of modeling a single decision maker and assigning predetermined behavioral patterns to the rest of the agents. In all of these studies, human drivers are modeled via discrete levels. What distinguishes the method presented in this paper from the earlier ones is that we abandon the belief that the humans can be successfully modeled via only discrete levels. We claim that humans can have behavioral models in a continuous range within the intervals between these discrete levels. We introduce and prove a theorem about the hierarchy of real-valued reasoning levels, which establishes the proposed method as a level-kùëòk refinement. In brief, our contributions in this paper are as follows: We put forward a refinement on level-kùëòk reasoning concept that allows us to work between discrete levels in continuous domain for modeling human behavior. To our knowledge, this is the first study on continuous level-kùëòk modeling. We develop the necessary theoretical background to provide a hierarchical structure among real-valued reasoning levels. Newly created continuous driver models are investigated on a real dataset to provide statistical analysis for model prediction capability. The results are compared with the earlier results using benchmark cases.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: models , gaussian mixture models , markov chain models , markov state space models , optimal control based models , inverse reinforcement learning based models , , Gaussian Process based models , , [ref]29, , game theoretical approaches , , , , Gated Recurrent Unit based models , joint use of recurrent and convolutional neural networks , joint use of recurrent and generative networks , and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
