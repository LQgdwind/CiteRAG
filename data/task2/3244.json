      "content": "Paper Title: Automatic Configuration for Optimal Communication Scheduling in DNN Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning (DL) has been widely adopted for data mining and analytics.\nDL drives rapid development of emerging applications\nsuch as face recognition [ref]20 and natural language processing (NLP) .\nTo support these applications,\nthe datasets become larger and larger and the models become more and more complex 6,\nmaking DL training increasingly time-consuming.\nAs a result, large-scale training is often conducted in a distributed manner.\nIn distributed training, communication is usually the bottleneck .\nMany studies have been done to improve the communication performance\nfor distributed training,\nsuch as Parameter Server (PS) , All-reduce , and Gradient Compression . Most recently, communication scheduling   [ref]39\nis proposed to further improve the communication efficiency of distributed training.\nThe key idea of communication scheduling is\nto change the transmission order of different DNN layers,\nin order to better parallelize the communication and computing tasks.\nThe state-of-the-art ByteScheduler [ref]39\nprovides a generic communication scheduling service for different DL frameworks\n(such as MXNet , PyTorch  and Tensorflow ),\nwhich adopts tensor partitioning and priority-based communication scheduling\nto realize pipelined communication and computation of distributed training. Based on experimental analysis,\nwe observe that\nthe configuration of hyper-parameters (i.e., the partition size and the credit size)\nis critical to ByteScheduler\nand inappropriate hyper-parameters may significantly degrade the effectiveness of partitioning and rearrangement.\nCurrently,\nByteScheduler adopts Bayesian Optimization (BO)  to accelerate the searching process\nby finding a near optimal configuration of the hyper-parameters beforehand.\nBO assumes the optimal values of the hyper-parameters stay constant\nthroughout the entire training procedure.\nIn practice, however, various runtime factors,\nsuch as worker node status and network conditions,\nchange over time,\nmaking the statically-determined one-shot configuration result suboptimal\nfor dynamic training environments.\n To address this problem,\nin this paper we present a real-time configuration method (called AutoByte)\nthat automatically and timely searches the optimal hyper-parameters\nas the training systems dynamically change.\nAutoByte extends the ByteScheduler framework with a meta-network,\nwhich takes the system’s runtime statistics as the model input\nand outputs predictions for speedups under specific configurations.\nThe runtime statistics include static parameters\n(such as the numbers of workers and model types)\nand dynamic parameters\n(such as layer-wise computation time and transmission rate\nwhich characterize the dynamic computation and communication conditions).\nAutoByte integrates offline training with online adaptation for its meta-network\nto better fit the practical training scenarios.\nAutoByte executes reconfigurations for the dynamically-generated optimal hyper-parameters\nbased on an optimization trigger mechanism,\nwhich can timely adjust the hyper-parameters\nand always achieve high training performance as runtime factors change.\n Our evaluation on various DNN models shows that\nAutoByte can dynamically tune the hyper-parameters to effectively improve the training performance.\nWe show that\nthe configuration automatically generated by AutoByte performs very close to the real optimal configuration found by Grid Search\n[ref]39,\nand that\nwhen multiple training jobs share the network bandwidth\n(as in real cloud environments), AutoByte can quickly find the optimal configuration under varying network bandwidth\nand improve the training performance by up to 19.2%percent\\%.\nWe further evaluate AutoByte’s effectiveness for different bandwidth settings and communication architectures (PS and All-reduce),\nand the results show that\nAutoByte can outperform the state-of-the-art communication scheduling algorithms\nby up to 33.2 %percent\\%\nat low resource usage cost. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In §§\\S2, we introduce the necessary background of communication scheduling in distributed training. We illustrate the downgrading caused by inappropriate partition size and credit size in ByteScheduler with both diagrams and experiments. Meanwhile, we show that the original hyper-parameters tuning technique Bayesian Optimization (BO) in ByteScheduler fails to adapt with the dynamic factors changing, e.g., available bandwidth and computation resource, which incurs suboptimal decisions. In §§\\SIII, we first explore the dynamic factors which impact the choosing of optimal credit size and partition size. Then we introduce the design of AutoByte, at its core, AutoByte uses a meta network optimizer to automatically exploit the relation of input metrics and training speed. To mitigate the extra overhead, AutoByte leverages an offline training and online adapting strategy. In §§\\SIV, we evaluate the speedup of AutoByte compare to vanilla ML framework and ByteSheduler on three different models. We also show the rapid adaptation and low overhead of AutoByte.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: Deep learning (DL) has been widely adopted for data mining and analytics.\nDL drives rapid development of emerging applications\nsuch as face recognition [ref]20 and natural language processing (NLP) .\nTo support these applications,\nthe datasets become larger and larger and the models become more and more complex 6,\nmaking DL training increasingly\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
