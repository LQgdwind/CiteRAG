      "content": "Paper Title: CM-Net: Concentric Mask based Arbitrary-Shaped Text Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo evaluate the performance of our method for detecting curved and adhesive text instances, the proposed CM-Net is compared with other SOTA methods on CTW1500 and Total-Text datasets respectively. The short edges of test images in the two datasets are resized to 640. Comparison with Real-Time Methods.\nAs we can see from Table VI CTW1500 and Total-Text, the conclusions on these two curved text benchmarks are the same as the conclusions on MSRA-TD500. On CTW1500 and Total-Text, CM-Net achieves 84.1% and 84.8% in F-measure, and 50.3 and 49.8 FPS in detection speed, which surpasses the performance of PAN [ref]16 and DB  simultaneously to a large extent. Particularly, on CTW1500, CM-Net runs 10.5 FPS and 23.3 FPS faster than PAN and DB and outperforms them 3.1% and 2.5% in F-measure. On the Total-Text dataset, we get the detection result of the DB  without DCN through the official code to ensure the fairness of comparison. Similar conclusions can be concluded that the proposed CM-Net also performs better than PAN and DB both in detection accuracy and speed, which verifies the superiority of CM-Net. Comparison with Non-Real-Time Methods.\nOn the CTW1500 dataset, CM-Net outperforms all SOTA methods both in detection accuracy and speed. A visualization example of the learned concentric masks and some involved post-processing steps are depicted in Fig. 12 (a)–(e). The proposed CM-Net successfully detects concentric masks of arbitrary-shaped text instances (Fig. 12 (b)) and rebuilds text contour with simple post-processing (Fig. 12 (c), (d))). Some qualitative illustrations are shown in Fig. 12 (g), which demonstrate our method can effectively detect extreme irregular-shaped geometries (highly-curved text instances) and adhesive text instances. On the Total-Text dataset, although our method is a little lower (0.6%) than ContourNet [ref]20 in F-measure, CM-Net has a least 13 times faster speed (49.8 FPS) than it. In detection accuracy, ContourNet is following the architecture of Mask-RCNN [ref]7, it first roughly locates the text instances by quadrilateral boxes and then accurately segments the regions of text instances from the boxes, which avoids the interference brought by the background but complicated the framework and deeply influences the detection speed. Compared with ContourNet, since our method detect text instances from the background directly, CM-Net has great superiority in detection speed. Moreover, benefiting from the MPF module, the proposed CM-Net still can achieve competitive detection accuracy with ContourNet while bringing no influence to detection speed. At the same time, ReLaText  and ATTR  need extra training data to train the network to achieve competitive detection accuracy with our method. They not only heavily depend on plenty of labeled data but also run slower than CM-Net 5 times at least. The proposed CM-Net achieves the best comprehensive performance both in detection accuracy and speed. Some qualitative results are shown in Fig. 12 (h). The superior performance on CTW1500 and Total-Text demonstrates the CM-Net can successfully detect adhesive arbitrary-shaped text instances.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: the same as the conclusions on MSRA-TD500.

Particularly, on CTW1500, CM-Net runs 10.5 FPS and 23.3 FPS faster than PAN and DB and outperforms them 3.1% and 2.5% in F-measure.
