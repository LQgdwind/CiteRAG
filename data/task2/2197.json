      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Space Partitions for Path Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPath planning has been used extensively in many applications, ranging from reinforcement learning [ref]7 3  and robotics    to biology , chemistry , material design , and compiler optimization [ref]42. The goal is to find the most rewarding trajectory (i.e., state-action sequence) 𝐱=(s0,a0,s1,…,sn)𝐱subscript𝑠0subscript𝑎0subscript𝑠1…subscript𝑠𝑛\\mathbf{x}=(s_{0},a_{0},s_{1},\\ldots,s_{n}) in the search space ΩΩ\\Omega: 𝐱∗=arg⁡max𝐱∈Ω⁡f​(𝐱)superscript𝐱subscript𝐱Ω𝑓𝐱\\mathbf{x}^{*}=\\arg\\max_{\\mathbf{x}\\in\\Omega}f(\\mathbf{x}), where f​(𝐱)𝑓𝐱f(\\mathbf{x}) is the reward. In this work, we focus on deterministic path planning problems with long trajectories 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}, and discontinuous and/or multimodal reward functions f𝑓f. Such high-dimensional non-convex optimization problems exist in many real domains, both continuous and discrete. While we could always find near-optimal 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} by random sampling given an infinite query budget, in practice we prefer a sample-efficient method that achieves high-reward trajectories with fewer queries of the reward function f𝑓f. While global methods like Bayesian Optimization (BO)  may struggle with limited samples and high-dimensional spaces, classic approaches like CEM 7 and CMA-ES  learn a local model around promising trajectories. For example, CEM tracks a population of trajectories and repeatedly re-samples its population according to the highest-performing trajectories from the previous generation. On the other hand, such a focus can trap CEM in local optima, as confirmed empirically (Sec. 5). Other recent approaches, such as VOOT  and DOO 1, use a (recursive) region partitioning scheme: they split the search space ΩΩ\\Omega into sub-regions Ω=Ω1∪…∪ΩkΩsubscriptΩ1…subscriptΩ𝑘\\Omega=\\Omega_{1}\\cup\\ldots\\cup\\Omega_{k}, then invest more samples into promising sub-regions while continuing to explore other regions via an upper confidence bound (UCB). While such exploration-exploitation procedures adaptively focus on promising sub-regions and lead to sub-linear regret and optimality guarantees, their region partition procedure is manually designed by humans and remains non-adaptive. For example, DOO partitions the space with uniform axis-aligned grids and VOOT with Voronoi cells, both independent of the reward f𝑓f to be optimized. Recently, Wang et al. proposed LaNAS  and LaMCTS , which adaptively partition the search regions based on sampled function values, and focus on good regions. They achieve strong empirical performance on Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and black-box optimization, outperforming many existing methods including evolutionary algorithms and BO. Notably, in recent NeurIPS’20 black-box optimization challenges, two teams that use variants of LaMCTS ranked 3rd 8 and 8th . In this paper, we provide a simple theoretical analysis of LaMCTS to reveal the underlying principles of adaptive region partitioning, an analysis missing in the original work. Based on this analysis, we propose Latent Space Partitions for Path Planning (LaP3), a novel optimization technique for path-planning.\nUnlike LaMCTS, LaP3 uses a latent representation of the search space.\nAdditionally, we use the maximum (instead of the mean) as the node score to improve sample efficiency, verified empirically in Sec. 5.3. Both changes are motivated by our theoretical analysis. We verify LaP3 on several challenging path-planning tasks, including\n2D navigation environments from past work with difficult-to-escape local optima,\nand\nreal-world planning problems in compiler optimization and molecular design. In all tasks, LaP3 demonstrates substantially stronger exploration ability to escape from local optima compared to several baselines including CEM, CMA-ES and VOOT. On compiler phase ordering, we achieve on average 39% and 31% speedup in execution cycles comparing to -O3 optimization and OpenTuner , two widely used optimization techniques in compilers. On molecular design, LaP3 outperforms all of our baselines in generating molecules with high values of desirable properties, beating the best baseline in average property value by up to 0.40.40.4 on properties in a  01  range. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show factors that affect the quality of planning and verify the theoretical analysis. LaP3 is a general planning technique and can be readily plugged into existing algorithms with path planning components. For example, we apply LaP3 to PETS [ref]7 in model-based RL and observe substantially improved performance for high-dimensional continuous control and navigation, compared to CEM as used in the original PETS framework.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Path planning has been used extensively in many applications, ranging from reinforcement learning [ref]7 3  and robotics    to biology , chemistry , material design , and compiler optimization [ref]42.
