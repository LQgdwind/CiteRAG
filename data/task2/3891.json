      "content": "Paper Title: Lagrangian PINNs: A causality–conforming solution to failure modes of physics-informed neural networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe contributions of this paperis threefold. We described the challenge of training of the traditional architecture of PINNs through the lens of approximation theory using Kolmogorov n–width, and the rate of decay of singular values of the solution.\nThis realization explains many of the successful remedies in training of PINNs.\nMore importantly, it can help with identifying unknown challenging problems, and opens of a wide variety of possibility to address them. We identified Burgers’ equation in the presence of traveling shocks as another challenging case.\nThe complexity of the training is explained based on our discussion of the irreducibly of the solution on a linear space. We propose LPINN for 1D linear and non–linear convection–diffusion equations.\nThe reformulation of the equations on the characteristics automatically conforms to the direction of travel of the information in the domain, and satisfies the expected causality.\nMore importantly, the solution on the manifold is of lower dimension, i.e., low Kolmogorov n–width, and is less sensitive to the system parameters.\nUsing the inherent low–dimensionality of the characteristics [ref]48, only a shallow branch is added to the traditional PINN to minimize the composite loss comprised of residual equations of characteristics, and the state variable on the characteristics.\n\nWhile it is suggested that the condition number of the loss is a probable source of complexity in training of PINNs , the proposed LPINN architecture is robust with respect to the condition number and show convergence regardless. Future work should investigate the problem with shocks where the characteristics intersect. In such cases, a vanishing viscosity approach or removing the triple point value using Rankine–Hugoniot condition seem to be straightforward solutions .\nSimilar strategies are even applied to PINNs in presence   .\nAn extension of the proposed LPINN to higher spatial dimensions is possible using Radon transform .\nIn cases where characteristics curves are not real, e.g., wave equation, a manifold can be identified by registration–based or feature tracking approaches, e.g.,  [ref]56  [ref]57 , and to replace the mass–spring–damper grid models in arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) formulation of PINNs .\nSpecifically, an optimal and low–rank manifold can be constructed offline by identifying an optimally morphing grid .\nMoreover, LPINN architecture provides an opportunity for one–shot discovery of an optimal manifold.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: the solution on the manifold is of lower dimension, i.e., low Kolmogorov n–width, and is less sensitive to the system parameters.\nUsing the inherent low–dimensionality of the characteristics [ref]48, only a shallow branch is added to the traditional PINN to minimize the composite loss comprised of residual equations of characteristics, and the state variable on the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
