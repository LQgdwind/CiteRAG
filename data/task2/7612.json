      "content": "Paper Title: T-TAME: Trainable Attention Mechanism for Explaining Convolutional Networks and Vision Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVision Transformers (ViTs) [ref]1 have been found to match or outperform Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in many important visual tasks such as natural image classification [ref]2, classification of masses in breast ultrasound , skin cancer classification [ref]4, and face recognition . As a result of the complex multi-layer nonlinear structure and end-to-end learning strategy of models, such as CNNs and ViTs, they typically act as “black box” models that lack transparency . This fact makes it difficult to convince users in critical fields, such as healthcare, law, and governance to trust and employ such systems , thus limiting the adoption of Artificial Intelligence  . Therefore, it is necessary to develop solutions that address the transparency challenge of deep neural networks. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is an active research area in the field of machine learning. XAI focuses on developing explainable techniques that help users of AI systems comprehend, trust, and more efficiently manage them  .\nFor the image classification task, several explanation approaches have been proposed to tackle the explainability problem for CNN and ViT models .\nThese methods typically produce an explanation map, also referred to as a saliency map, highlighting the salient input features. We must stress that explainability methods should not be confused with approaches targeting weakly supervised learning tasks such as weakly supervised object localization or segmentation , which also generate superficially similar heatmaps as an intermediate step. Contrary to the latter, the goal of explainability approaches is to explain the classifier’s decision rather than to locate the region of the target object (for an example, see Fig. 1). The existing explanation approaches for image classifiers can be roughly categorized as follows. Gradient-based methods, such as Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++, were pioneering approaches in explaining CNNs   and were also among the first methods applied to ViTs .\nSince these approaches utilize gradient information, they are subject to associated limitations such as gradient saturation and noise issues, resulting in explanations that may include high-frequency variations  .\nRelevance-based methods, on the other hand, use a Taylor decomposition of a relevance function they define to propagate relevance of pixel information through the examined network   .\nThese methods do not directly rely on gradient information and are therefore less prone to the limitations associated with gradient-based approaches; however, their difficulty to be adapted to novel classifier architectures restricts their applicability .\nFinally, perturbation-   and response-based approaches     observe the output’s sensitivity to a multitude of small input changes, and combine intermediate network representations to derive an explanation, respectively.\nThe methods within these categories operate without using gradients and thus avoid relevant drawbacks; however, their process for generating an explanation is computationally very expensive. Distinguished from the above works, L-CAM  is a trainable response-based method: it utilizes an appropriate objective function to guide the training of an attention mechanism in order to derive explanation maps of high quality in one forward pass.\nHowever, L-CAM uses the feature maps of only the last convolutional layer of the frozen CNN model to be explained (hereafter also referred to as the “backbone network”), thus may not be able to adequately capture the information used within this backbone for making a classification decision.\nAdditionally, L-CAM is not applicable to ViTs, because ViT feature maps are not three-dimensional, unlike CNN feature maps, and because of the different ways in which ViTs handle input perturbations (see  for a comparison w.r.t. robustness between ViTs and CNNs). To this end, we propose T-TAME: Transformer-compatible Trainable Attention Mechanism for Explanations. T-TAME is inspired by the learning-based paradigm of L-CAM. Unlike L-CAM, T-TAME exploits intermediate feature maps extracted from multiple layers of the backbone network. These features are then used to train a multi-branch hierarchical attention architecture for generating class-specific explanation maps in a single forward pass. Additionally, T-TAME introduces components that manage the compatibility of the trainable attention mechanism with the backbone network, enabling its use with both CNN and ViT backbones. We demonstrate that T-TAME generates higher quality explanation maps over the current SOTA explainability methods, by performing a rich set of qualitative and quantitative comparisons. A preliminary version of this work, still applicable only to CNN backbones, was presented in . In summary, the contributions of this paper are: We present the first, to the best of our knowledge, trainable post-hoc method for generating explanation maps for both CNN and Transformer-based image classification networks, which utilizes an attention mechanism to process feature maps from multiple layers. We provide a comprehensive evaluation study of the proposed T-TAME method for three heterogeneous backbones: the widely used CNN models VGG-16  and ResNet-50 0, as well as the breakthrough ViT model ViT-B-16 [ref]1. Based on example explanations produced by T-TAME and ablation experiments, we gain insights into the ViT classifier. Specifically, we demonstrate ViT’s global view of input images, thanks to its multi-head attention layer, and we confirm its robustness to out-of-sample distributions of input images.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Vision Transformers (ViTs) [ref]1 have been found to match or outperform Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in many important visual tasks such as natural image classification [ref]2, classification of masses in breast\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
