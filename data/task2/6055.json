      "content": "Paper Title: Controllable One-Shot Face Video Synthesis With Semantic Aware Prior\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe first evaluate our method both objectively and subjectively. Next, we analyze the model performance under different bandwidth constraints for video compression applications. Dataset We evaluate our method on both the VoxCeleb  and TalkingHead-1KH [ref]35 dataset. We use the original train/test split of the datasets and cropped the faces from the videos and resize them to 256×256256256256{\\times}256 following . To evaluate the model performance under large head pose difference between source and driving frames, we further collect a subset of test videos with dramatic head pose changes from VoxCeleb. Specifically, we compute the head pose variance within each video. We then take the videos with top 10%percent1010\\% variance as the hard subset to measure model performance under extreme head poses. Please refer to Appendix for more details. Implementation details Our method uses a pre-extracted 3D prior to avoid repeated regeneration during training. Our method’s inference time is comparable to existing baseline methods. Additional details, such as the landmark selection process and computational cost, are available in Appendix. Baselines For same-identity reconstruction, we compare with FOMM  and Face-vid2vid [ref]35. We take the public implementation and re-train the model. Additionally, we compare with two recent direct synthesis methods (LIA  and PIRender ). For cross-identity re-enactment, we mainly compare with the keypoint-based methods (FOMM  and Face-vid2vid [ref]35) that use the relative motion . That is, we transfer the motion difference between neighboring frames instead of the absolution motion. Please see Appendix for implementation details. Evaluation metrics Following prior works on neural talking-head, we evaluate our method using 1) Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) for reconstruction faithfulness, 2) Frechet Inception Distance [ref]12 (FID) for output image quality, and 3) Average Keypoint Distance  (AKD) for semantic consistency and Average Euclidean Distance [ref]30 (AED) for facial identity preserving, where AKD and AED measure the facial keypoints and facial identity by computing the similarity of keypoints and identity features extracted by off-the-shelf models. We also introduce two additional metrics: Average Keypoint Distance on Mouth (AKD-M) that measures AKD for keypoints around the mouth, and Average Emotion Distance (AEMOD) that measures the embedding distance of an off-the-shelf emotion recognition model. These two metrics are designed to capture fine-grained facial expressions.
