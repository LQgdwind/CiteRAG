      "content": "Paper Title: No-Reference Quality Assessment for 360-degree Images by Analysis of Multi-frequency Information and Local-global Naturalness\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MFILGN model, we conduct extensive experiments compared to existing FR and NR objective image quality assessment algorithms. The FR models include conventional FR IQA as well as OIQA approaches (i.e. PSNR, SSIM , MS-SSIM , FSIM , S-PSNR , WS-PSNR  and CPP-PSNR ) and a deep learning-based FR IQA method (i.e. DeepQA [ref]36). Moreover, the NR models consist of traditional NR IQA approaches (i.e. BRISQUE  and BMPRI ) and three deep learning-based NR IQA as well as OIQA methods (i.e. DB-CNN , MC360IQA [ref]49 and VGCN ). Among these existing state-of-the-art objective FR image quality assessment models, the PSNR-related metrics including PSNR, S-PSNR, WS-PSNR and CPP-PSNR are the signal fidelity measurement, which compute the pixel differences between the reference and distorted images. Considering the characteristics of the HVS, the SSIM and its variants (i.e. MS-SSIM and FSIM) extract structural information from original and distorted images for perceptual image quality assessment. Besides, the DeepQA takes the human visual sensitivity into account in the deep learning framework. For NR methods, the BRISQUE is based on NSS features in the spatial domain and designed for conventional 2D IQA, and the BMPRI generates multiple pseudo reference images and exploits local binary pattern features for quality estimation. Additionally, the DB-CNN puts forward the bilinear pooling for predicting the perceptual image quality in the architecture of CNN. It is worth noting that the MC360IQA and VGCN are two deep learning-based methods specifically designed for 360-degree images. The MC360IQA utilizes 6 parallel sub-networks for viewport images, while the VGCN builds the graph convolution network based on different viewports. Table I shows the overall performance comparisons on OIQA  and CVIQD   databases. The best experimental results are highlighted in bold. The compared performance values are from . For fair comparison, the performance values of traditional image quality assessment models are tested on the used testing data. Moreover, the learning-based models are trained on each specific 360-degree image quality database (i.e. OIQA database or CVIQD database) with randomly selected 80% training data, and then tested on the remaining 20% testing data. We can see that the PSNR-based metrics are inferior to other objective models considering the HVS properties. This is a common phenomenon because only signal errors are involved in the framework of PSNR-related models, which is far from the human perception. The 2D IQA models show unsatisfactory performance because they do not consider the specific characteristics of 360-degree images, such as the multiple viewports which are important for quality perception when browsing VR visual contents. Moreover, the deep learning-based models have advantages over traditional objective image quality assessment approaches for both FR and NR categories, especially the MC360IQA and VGCN which are two deep learning-based methods specifically developed for VR images. In addition, our proposed MFILGN achieves the best performance among the existing state-of-the-arts, including the deep learning-based OIQA and NSS-based IQA algorithms.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: The FR models include conventional FR IQA as well as OIQA approaches (i.e. PSNR, SSIM , MS-SSIM , FSIM , S-PSNR , WS-PSNR  and CPP-PSNR ) and a deep learning-based FR IQA method (i.e. DeepQA [ref]36).
