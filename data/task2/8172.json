      "content": "Paper Title: From Innermost to Full Probabilistic Term Rewriting: Almost-Sure Termination, Complexity, and Modularity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTermination\nand complexity analysis are among the main tasks in program verification, and\ntechniques and tools to analyze termination or complexity of\nterm rewrite systems (TRSs) automatically have been studied for decades.\nWhile a direct application of classical reduction orderings is often too weak,\nthese orderings can be used successfully within the dependency pair (DP) framework\nfor termination  1 and for innermost runtime complexity .\nMoreover, the framework of  uses weak\ndependency pairs in order to analyze derivational and runtime complexity.\nThese frameworks allow for modular termination and complexity proofs\nby decomposing the original problem into sub-problems which can\nthen be analyzed independently using different techniques.\nThus, DPs are used in essentially all current termination and complexity\ntools for TRSs\n(e.g., AProVE , MuTerm ,\nNaTT 7,\nTcT ,\nTTT2 4).\nTo allow certification of proofs with DPs, they have been formalized in\nseveral proof assistants (e.g., [ref]1   5) and there exist several corresponding certification tools\nfor termination and complexity proofs with DPs (e.g., CeTA 5). On the other hand, probabilistic programs are used to describe randomized\nalgorithms and probability distributions, with applications in many areas, see, e.g., .\nTo use TRSs also for such programs, probabilistic term rewrite systems (PTRSs) were introduced in   .\nIn the probabilistic setting, there are several notions of “termination”.\nFor example, a program is almost-surely terminating (𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST})\nif the probability for termination is 111.\nAnother interesting property is positive almost-sure termination (𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST}) 3  which means\nthat the expected length of every evaluation is finite.\nFinally, strong or bounded almost-sure termination\n(𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{SAST})   requires that for every\nconfiguration t𝑡t (e.g., for every term), there is a finite bound on the expected\nlengths of all evaluations starting in t𝑡t. Thus, if there is a start configuration\nt𝑡t which non-deterministically leads to evaluations of arbitrary finite length, then the\nprogram can be 𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST}, but not 𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{SAST}. Hence, 𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{SAST} implies 𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST}, and 𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST} implies 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}, but the\nconverse directions do not hold in general. While there exist many automatic approaches to prove 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}, 𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST}, or 𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{SAST} of imperative programs\non numbers (e.g., 2 8 7   1 3 7 2 6  9),\nthere are only few automatic approaches for programs with complex non-tail recursive\nstructure  0 .\nThe approaches that are suitable for algorithms on recursive data structures 6 5 \nare mostly specialized for specific data structures and cannot easily be adjusted to\nother (possibly user-defined) ones, or are not yet fully automated. We recently developed an adaption of the DP framework for 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} 0 and an adaption for\ninnermost 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} 8 6 (i.e., 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} restricted to rewrite sequences where one only\nevaluates at innermost positions), which allows us to benefit from a similar modularity\nas in the non-probabilistic setting.\nHowever, the DP framework for innermost 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} is\nsubstantially more powerful than the one for 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}.\nIndeed, also in the non-probabilistic setting,\ninnermost termination is usually substantially easier to prove than full termination,\nsee, e.g.,  1.\nThe same holds for non-probabilistic complexity analysis, where the DP framework\nof  is restricted to innermost rewriting and\nthe framework of \nis considerably more powerful for innermost than for full rewriting.\nTo lift innermost termination and complexity proofs to full rewriting,\nin the non-probabilistic setting there exist several sufficient criteria\nwhich ensure that innermost termination implies full termination 0\nand that innermost runtime complexity coincides with full runtime complexity 4. Up to now no such results were known in the probabilistic setting.\nOur paper presents the first sufficient criteria for PTRSs which ensure that, e.g., 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}\ncoincides for full and innermost rewriting, and we also show similar results for\nother rewrite strategies like leftmost-innermost rewriting.\nWe focus on criteria that can be checked automatically, so we can combine our results\nwith the DP framework for proving innermost 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} of PTRSs 8 6.\nIn this way, we obtain a technique that (if applicable) can\nprove 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} for full rewriting automatically\nand is significantly more powerful than the corresponding DP framework for full 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} 0. Our criteria also hold for 𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST}, 𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{SAST}, and expected\ncomplexity.\nAt the moment,\nfor 𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST} and 𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{SAST}, there only exist techniques\nto apply polynomial or matrix orderings directly ,\nand we are not aware of any automatic technique to\nanalyze expected runtimes of PTRSs.\nBut if specific automatic techniques are developed to analyze\ninnermost 𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST}, innermost 𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{SAST}, or\ninnermost expected complexity in the future, then our criteria could be directly applied to\ninfer the respective properties also for full rewriting automatically. As a corollary of our results in the probabilistic setting,\nwe also develop the first results relating derivational and innermost\nderivational complexity for ordinary non-probabilistic TRSs.\nThe difference between derivational and runtime complexity is that\nruntime complexity only considers start terms where a defined function symbol (i.e., an\n“algorithm”)\nis applied\nto arguments built with constructor symbols (i.e., to “data”),\nwhile derivational complexity allows arbitrary start terms. There exist numerous\nresults on the\nmodularity of termination, confluence, and completeness of TRSs\nin the non-probabilistic setting, see, e.g., 0.\nBased on our novel criteria,\nwe\ndevelop the first modularity\nresults for probabilistic termination w.r.t. different evaluation strategies,\ni.e.,\nwe investigate whether 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}, 𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST}, or 𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{SAST} are preserved\nfor\nunions of PTRSs.\nAdditionally, we also study preservation of 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}, 𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST}, or 𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{SAST}\nunder signature extensions, which can be seen as a special case of modularity, i.e., a specific union of PTRSs,\nwhere the second PTRS only contains trivial rewrite rules.\nWe show that while 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} and 𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{SAST} are preserved under signature extensions, this does not hold for 𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST},\nimplying that any sound and complete proof technique for 𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST} of PTRSs\nhas to take the specific signature into account.\nRelated to these results, we show that for PTRSs,\n𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST} and 𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{SAST}\nare almost always equivalent. For example, if the signature contains at\nleast one function symbol of arity greater than 111,\nthen there is no difference between\n𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST} and 𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{SAST} for finite PTRSs. We start with preliminaries on term rewriting in Sect. 2.\nThen we recapitulate PTRSs based on   1 8 \nin Sect. 3.\nIn Sect. 4 we show that the properties of 0\nthat ensure equivalence of innermost and full termination do not suffice in the probabilistic setting and extend them accordingly.\nIn particular, we show that innermost and full 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} coincide for PTRSs that are\nnon-overlapping and linear.\nThis result also holds for 𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST}, 𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{SAST}, and the expected runtime complexity, as well as for strategies like\nleftmost-innermost evaluation.\nIn Sect. 5 we show how to weaken the linearity\nrequirement in order to prove\nfull 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} for larger classes of PTRSs.\nThe implementation of our criteria in the tool AProVE is evaluated in Sect. 6.\nAfterwards, in Sect. 7 we analyze the\nmodularity of all these (full and innermost)\ntermination properties for PTRSs.\nWe conclude in Sect. 8 and\nrefer to App. A for all missing proofs.111To ease readability,\nfor those proofs which require larger technical constructions, we only give proof sketches\nin the main part of the paper and present the corresponding full technical proofs in\nApp. A. The current paper extends our earlier conference paper 7 by: All results concerning 𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{SAST} and the novel relations between\n𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{SAST} and 𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST} (the whole LABEL:sect:Relating_PASTand_SAST\nas well as all results on 𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚂𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{SAST} from LABEL:Relating_AST_and_its_RestrictedForms and 5).
