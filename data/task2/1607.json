      "content": "Paper Title: GradInit: Learning to Initialize Neural Networks for Stable and Efficient Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor a Transformer model to converge, either an explicit or implicit learning rate warmup stage is needed, especially for the original Transformer architecture. It is observed that this Post-LN architecture tends to outperform the Pre-LN model [ref]6 while having higher gradient variance at initialization . Is it believed that this high variance makes a warmup stage inevitable. Previous works that removes the warmup stage often involves architectural changes, e.g., removing Layer Normalizations, since it can surprisingly cause instability . Here, we show that with a proper initialization, we can do away with the warmup stage for the original Post-LN Transformer without any modification to the architecture. Table 7 summarizes the architectural changes and best results of methods for improving the initialization of Post-LN Transformers. We compare the stability of the GradInit and Admin initialization methods without warmup in Figure 3. Dataset, Architecture, & Hyperparameters. IWSLT’14 DE-EN  is a German to English translation dataset that has 160k training examples. Our Transformer model is inherited from [ref]3, which is a Post-LN Transformer placing its Layer Normalization after the summation of the skip connection and the residual branch. It has a 512-dimensional word embedding layer and 1024 dimensions in its hidden FFN layer. We also apply GradInit to the variant from Admin [ref]6, where a learnable vector 𝒘s​k​i​psubscript𝒘𝑠𝑘𝑖𝑝{\\bm{w}}_{skip} is element-wise multiplied with each dimension of the skip connection, but we initialize it to 1 for GradInit. Please refer to [ref]6 for how Admin initializes these weights.\nFollowing [ref]6, we use a linearly decaying learning rate schedule that decays from the maximum learning rate ηmaxsubscript𝜂\\eta_{\\max} to 0 as the model trains for 100K iterations.\nFor training with SGD, we set the prescribed learning rate ηmax=0.15subscript𝜂0.15\\eta_{\\max}=0.15, and use η=0.15,γ=1formulae-sequence𝜂0.15𝛾1\\eta=0.15,\\gamma=1 for GradInit. We do a grid search on ηmaxsubscript𝜂\\eta_{\\max} for Admin and report its best result in Table 7.\nFor training with Adam, we set η=5×10−4,γ=103formulae-sequence𝜂5superscript104𝛾superscript103\\eta=5\\times 10^{-4},\\gamma=10^{3} for the objective of GradInit, so that η​γ𝜂𝛾\\eta\\gamma is O​(10−1)𝑂superscript101O(10^{-1}) as discussed in Section 3.3. We train the initialized model ηmaxsubscript𝜂\\eta_{\\max} and β2subscript𝛽2\\beta_{2} as listed in Figure 3. We evaluate the BLEU score every epoch, and report the best BLEU scores throughout training for each run. For GradInit, we set the maximum number of iterations T𝑇T to 780. By comparison, the warmup stage usually takes 4000 iterations, and we find that if we use 780 steps for warmup, the model does not converge with ηmax≥3×10−4subscript𝜂3superscript104\\eta_{\\max}\\geq 3\\times 10^{-4}. For ηmax=2×10−4subscript𝜂2superscript104\\eta_{\\max}=2\\times 10^{-4} with 780-step warmup, the BLEU score is 35.4, worse than GradInit’s 36.0, showing the advantage of GradInit against warmup. Stability after removing warmup for Adam. In Figure 3, the training process becomes more unstable as β2subscript𝛽2\\beta_{2} grows larger. From the analysis of RAdam [ref]35, this is because the variance of the gradient has a stronger impact on the adaptive learning rate when β2subscript𝛽2\\beta_{2} is closer to 1. Therefore, the largest β2<1subscript𝛽21\\beta_{2}<1 that maintains the performance of the trained model reflects the stability of the initialization. We can see GradInit results in more stable models than Admin in general, though their best performance numbers are almost the same.\nIn addition, we find 𝒘s​k​i​psubscript𝒘𝑠𝑘𝑖𝑝{\\bm{w}}_{skip} can help stabilize training in extreme hyper parameter settings, e.g., at ηmax=5×10−4subscript𝜂5superscript104\\eta_{\\max}=5\\times 10^{-4} and β2=0.995subscript𝛽20.995\\beta_{2}=0.995 in Figure 3, GradInit with 𝒘s​k​i​psubscript𝒘𝑠𝑘𝑖𝑝{\\bm{w}}_{skip} obtains a good average BLEU score of 36.0, while without 𝒘s​k​i​psubscript𝒘𝑠𝑘𝑖𝑝{\\bm{w}}_{skip} only succeeded in obtaining a BLEU score >35absent35>35 for one out of four experiments, resulting in an average BLEU score of 8.9. We also find the network is unable to be trained without learning rate warmup if we just fix 𝒘s​k​i​psubscript𝒘𝑠𝑘𝑖𝑝{\\bm{w}}_{skip} to its initial value given by Admin and leave the initialization of other parameters unchanged. Nevertheless, with GradInit, we do not need to modify the architecture of Post-LN Transformer to obtain the same good result as Admin. For a closer look at the stabilization mechanism, we show the weight norms and gradient variance at initialization of the original Post-LN architecture using GradInit and Xavier initialization in Figure 9 of the Appendix. For Xavier initialization, the gradient variance is relatively higher for all encoder layers, so GradInit downscales the encoder layer weights more in general. For the LN weights, GradInit only downscales the final LN of both the encoder and decoder, which reduces the variance of the encoder and decoder during the forward pass. Another strategy GradInit learns is to downscale the weights of the output projection and the FFN layers, so that the residual branch is relatively down-weighted compared with the skip connection, similar to Admin. Removing warmup without architectural change. Another widely observed phenomenon is that adaptive methods such as Adam seem to be much better than SGD for training Transformer-based language models .\nTable 7 shows that, with GradInit, we can find a good initialization for the Post-LN Transformer on IWSLT-14 DE-EN that trains using SGD without learning rate warmup nor gradient clipping, and achieves performance close to Adam trained using the same type of learning rate schedule. By comparison, Admin also makes the Transformer trainable with SGD, but the BLEU score is lower than the one initialized with GradInit. By comparing Figures 9 and 10 in the Appendix, we find GradInit for Adam and SGD adopts different rescaling patterns, with the Adam version depending more on downscaling the residual branches through the FFN and output projection layers than the SGD version, and the SGD version downscaling more in the final FFN block of the decoder. This highlights the importance of considering the optimization algorithm 𝒜𝒜{\\mathcal{A}} in GradInit, and also indicates the presence of different ways to reduce the initial gradient variance.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: an explicit or implicit learning rate warmup stage is needed, especially for the original Transformer architecture.
