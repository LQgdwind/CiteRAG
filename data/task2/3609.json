According the the same optimization stack, we summarize the major differences in Table¬†I and analyze the computing challenges in Figure¬†2. \n\n\n\nFull Optimization Stack\nSingle-Tenant\nMulti-Tenant\n\n\n\n\nCo-location\nNo\nYes\n\n1  Service-level\nInterference\nNo\nHigh Interference\n\n2  Graph-level\nDAG(s)\nMostly Seq.\nSeq. + Parallel\n\n\nParallelism\nLimited\nExtensive\n\n3  Runtime-level\nComplexity\nLow\nHigh\n\n\nResource Usage\nExclusive\nShared\n\n4  Kernel-level\nTuning Objective\n100% util.\nxùë•x% partial util.\n\n5  Resource-level\nManagement\nNo\nResource Partition\n\n Service-level: AI-centric cloud services handle millions of service queries simultaneously¬†. With the massive computing capacity of GPUs, multiple DL queries could be strategically co-located for efficient concurrent execution, which is one key difference between multi-tenant GPU computing versus traditional CPU multi-tasking.\nBy allowing the resource sharing among concurrent DL workloads, the service providers could potentially improve the GPU resource utilization and reduce cost of ownership (COO) like infrastructure and power cost especially for large-scale data centers¬†. However, the challenges remains for strategic co-location like that the inter-tenant interference¬† could happen and degrade the quality of service such as service-level objectives (SLA) of tail latency and throughput.\nThis could become worse with increased number of co-located workloads and degrade the overall serving throughput.\nTherefore, there are many recent service-level orchestration works¬†   that design different heuristic-based, modeling-based or prediction-based mechanisms to conduct strategic co-location for efficient multi-tenant computing on GPUs. Graph-level: DNNs with many operators are commonly represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which use nodes to represent operators and edges to represent the data flow and dependency¬†[ref]15.\nSingle-model DAGs are usually sequential with limited parallelism like VGG, ResNets, MobileNets and EfficietNets, which have only one or two branches and thus exposes small scheduling space¬†. By contrast, multi-tenant DL computing with multiple parallel DAGs usually have extensive inter-operator parallelism, as shown in Figure¬†2, which enables more flexible inter-operator scheduling among tenants¬†. Certain challenges exist in such graph scheduling such as the increased complexity in larger number of operators and scheduling space, and the more complex GPU resource contention analysis, etc. Runtime-level: Previously due to the limited inter-operator parallelism, only a few works¬†  touch upon runtime-level scheduling such as certain multi-branch models like Inception, NasNets and Transformers.\nThese works leverage certain GPU runtime primitives (e.g., Nvidia multi-stream¬†2) for concurrent operator scheduling, many of which however incur large runtime overheads. For example, multi-stream synchronization forces all streams to wait/stall until the last stream finishes its workloads¬†2.\nMulti-tenant scheduling tends to suffer more from such overheads with the increased number of operators and scheduling complexity.\nDue to the increased attention in GPU multi-tenant scheduling, GPU vendors have recently released a series of important features such as CUDA graphs¬†7 to address such scheduling overheads. Kernel-level: Kernel configurations such as loop tiling, thread blocking, memory colasing, etc. could significantly influence each operator‚Äôs computing efficiency. Previous single-tenant kernel-level works like TVM¬†[ref]3 and TF-XLA¬† try to find the best configuration that can saturate the GPU resource, i.e., exclusive resource usage.\nHowever, as multi-tenant DNNs share the underlying resource, kernels optimized for single-tenant settings can easily become sub-optimal for multi-tenant scenarios. Recently, there are certain works that show multi-tenant DL computing should optimize kernel configurations according to its available resource ratio during practical execution¬†, which shows a 5√ó\\times throughput difference. Resource-level:\nTo achieve adaptive multi-tenant resource partitioning and provisioning, it asks for both strategic design and hardware support.\nThe first challenge for such adaptive resource provisioning lies in the DL workload dynamics¬†. Multiple DL models with different deep structures have highly non-stable computing/memory requirements, making the inter-model resource sharing and competition highly dynamic and thus hard to determine the optimal resource partitioning.\nOn the other hand, adaptive resource management requires the flexible GPU reconfiguration capability.\nAlthough there are certain adaptive resource provisioning features (e.g., Nvidia multi-process service, multi-instance GPU¬†5 ) that supports resource partitioning, the reconfiguration process requires non-negligible time (e.g., several m‚Äãsùëöùë†ms), which is a major limitation of the recent resource scheduling works¬†[ref]9 .\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: Traditional DL computing optimization in full stack often expands in  1 service-level orchestration¬†,  2 graph-level optimization¬†[ref]15 ,  3 runtime-level scheduling¬†,  4 kernel-level tuning¬†[ref]3  and  5 resource-level management¬†[ref]9 .\nAlthough there are many previous works for computing optimization in these difference\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
