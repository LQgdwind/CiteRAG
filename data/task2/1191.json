      "content": "Paper Title: Cost–effective Variational Active Entity Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep–learning models, including VAEs, operate on numerical inputs, i.e., feature vectors. One possible approach to obtain such representations is, similarly to , [ref]3 or , to use a RNN–  or BERT–based neural architecture 9. However, such an approach would require considerable training resources and, more importantly, would bound the resulting representations of tuples to the current data domain and ER task, since they rely on processing the word vocabulary of all input tuples. The resulting representations would then be hard to reuse in other ER tasks. In this paper, we rely on a simple alternative that generates initial attribute value vectorized representations, i.e., intermediate representations (I​R​s𝐼𝑅𝑠IRs) that are similarity–preserving and independent from the type of neural architecture used for matching. Such I​R​s𝐼𝑅𝑠IRs are vectors of numbers that can be independently generated using methods such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) , word–embedding models [ref]31  (W2V), BERT pre–trained embeddings [ref]32, or relational embeddings specialized for data integration tasks such as ER  (EmbDI). In practice, I​R𝐼𝑅IR generation involves construing each attribute value of a given table as a sentence and: LSA: consider the corpus of all such sentences to model its latent topics and generate I​R​s𝐼𝑅𝑠IRs using known topic modeling methods (e.g.,  ). W2V: pass each word of each sentence through a pre–trained word–embedding model and generate I​R​s𝐼𝑅𝑠IRs by averaging the resulting embeddings at sentence–level. BERT: pass each sentence through a pre–trained BERT model [ref]32 and construe the result as the I​R𝐼𝑅IR for the input sentence (i.e., attribute value). EmbDI: consider the corpus of all sentences to train a data integration embedding model following  and follow the W2V method to obtain I​R​s𝐼𝑅𝑠IRs. I​R​s𝐼𝑅𝑠IRs are important because they encode morphological and semantic information of values. Without their use, we would have to rely on the VAE architecture to learn numerical representations of words using high–dimensional deep Embedding layers. Such architecture types are common with DeepMatcher or DITTO. In this paper, we show that VAER is general enough so that it can incorporate the types of evidence commonly used with other ER systems (e.g., W2V in DeepMatcher and BERT in DITTO), while further contributing to the cost reductions of the ER process by (i) reducing the dimensionality of the VAE; (ii) speeding up the VAE training process, e.g., through transfer learning, as described in Section III-D; and (iii) reducing the generalization requirements, since part of the similarity correlations between words aimed to be conveyed by the final representations are already caught by I​R​s𝐼𝑅𝑠IRs.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Deep–learning models, including VAEs, operate on numerical inputs, i.e., feature vectors.
