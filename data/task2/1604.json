      "content": "Paper Title: Machine Learning Model Development from a Software Engineering Perspective: A Systematic Literature Review\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAmershi et al.  conducted a comprehensive study involving AI professionals at Microsoft. By investigating scientists, researchers, managers, programmers, and other professionals in their respective daily activities, the authors have identified the three major challenges in building large-scale AI applications: data management, reuse, and modularity. In order to address the challenges for ML, the paper analyzes how Microsoft software teams adapt their existing agile processes to incorporate the complexity from machine learning to then build artificial intelligence-based applications such as text, voice, and video translators or the interactive speaking agents built on speech and language recognition. The authors interviewed company employees to find out how they tackle challenges from a development standpoint - especially in machine learning modeling. The paper contributes to the field by providing insights related to the adoption of software engineering processes to machine learn modeling, such as: (i) machine learning modeling dependency on data and the consequent importance of all data related stages in a machine learning modeling workflow; and (ii) the need for teams with skills for software engineering and machine learning modeling; (iii) the difficulty of modularization and reuse of machine learning models (which is different from regular software applications) since modules in machine learning have greater impact on each other. Consequently, by acknowledging that ML applications are structurally different from applications in other domains, the authors were able to build a comprehensive and up-to-date workflow (which was adopted in our present work as a common reference to understand the ML modeling process) with typical stages that address the ML model development. While Amershi et al.  identifies the main challenges regarding building large-scale AI applications and used it for building an up-to-date ML workflow, another comprehensive study by Correia et al.  conducted interviews with data scientists from five different Brazilian companies in order to identify which were the most challenging stages of the ML workflow proposed by Amershi et al. . The authors found that data scientists have pointed to Data Processing and Feature Engineering as the most challenging stages in the ML workflow, even while they also mentioned important issues regarding Model Training, Model Evaluation, and Model Deployment. These results indicate the lack of a well-engineered process in the ML model development practice. A study conducted by Zhang et al.  investigated 138 research papers in search of methods for testing and debugging the ML code. Their findings show that only a few contributions focus on testing interpretability, privacy, or efficiency. Zhang et al.  focus on exclusively analyzing the stage of Model Evaluation, as opposed to targeting all ML stages. In contrast to the partial information in works such as Amershi et al. , authors such as Hesenius et al.  argue that although there are challenges faced by software engineers when developing data-driven applications, the data dependency of ML/AI applications does not constitute an issue to the adoption of a common integrated Software Engineering (SE) process, upon which the project’s overall success would depend. As a consequence, by defining a set of roles (Software Engineer, Data Scientist, Data Domain Expert, and Domain Expert), stages, and responsibilities to structure the necessary work, decisions and documents, the authors provided a structured engineering process that suits all data-driven applications, ultimately filling the gap found in the literature. It is worth mentioning that although the article presents a general framework in contrast to specific solutions aiming to solve particular and partial issues related to ML/AI modeling, the adoption of the proposed model does not disregard specializations of the aforementioned process, including individual steps and specifically tailored tools for certain data-driven applications. In a similar fashion, by presenting methods for measuring the best practices degree of adoption when investigating the relationship between different groups of practices and assessing/predicting their effects by performing regression models, Serban’s [ref]5 article reaches conclusions that are in line with Hesenius et al. in a way that there is a set of best practices which is applicable to any ML application development, regardless of the type of data under consideration. Additionally, the author has contributed to the evolution of such practices by presenting a methodology in which each practice is related to its effects and adoption rate. Washizaki et al. [ref]6 presented a related work which clearly complements both works of Hesenius et al.  and Serban et al.[ref]5. The paper addresses the classification of software engineering design patterns by conducting a systematic study which collects, classifies, and analyzes SE architecture and the design of “bad” patterns for ML systems which links traditional software systems and ML systems architecture and design. One interesting result presented by the article is the understanding that SE patterns for ML systems are divided between two processes: The Machine Learning pipeline and SE development. Between these two very distinct approaches, one regarding customized ML workflows related to the specifics of each ML based system and the other oriented towards a broadly general workflow (which would be suitable to any ML application regardless of its specifics), there are several studies with different approaches for the relation/application of software engineering development process to ML modeling. Some of them deal with specifics like the adoption of software engineering best practices related to the development of application programming interfaces (Reimann, Kniesel-Wünsch [ref]7), while others address the accountability gap in ML/AI by proposing a framework based on software development best practices (Hutchinson et al.). Further, Nascimento et al.  pointed out that the differences between Traditional systems and Machine Learning systems can be identified by observing the differences between their respective software development activities. In fact, the authors identified that SE activities are more challenging for ML systems which follow specific four-stage software development process, namely: understanding the problem, handling data, building models and monitoring those models. Other works focus on well-known stages of SE lifecycle or the ML Workflow by identifying and addressing many different types of gaps, such as in the works presented in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6. Finally, we have also found papers which demonstrate the difficulty with reconciling Software Engineering Development with Machine Learning Modeling due to the fundamental differences of such processes as the work of Kim 7.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: the best practices degree of adoption when investigating the relationship between different groups of practices and assessing/predicting their effects by performing regression models, Serban’s [ref]5 article reaches conclusions that are in line with Hesenius et al. in a way that there is a set of best practices which is applicable to any ML application development, regardless of the type\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
