      "content": "Paper Title: Application of Ghost-DeblurGAN to Fiducial Marker Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMotion blur resulting from camera shake and rapid object motion is frequently seen in photos or videos captured by, for instance, hand-held cameras as well as cameras onboard autonomous vehicles [ref]1  [ref]3. Severe motion blur causes image degradation, which hinders the object detection task and could lead to detection failure [ref]4. In recent years, deep-learning-based deblurring methods [ref]1 [ref]3  have been proven effective in improving object detection performance when used along with object detection systems, such as YOLO . However, previous studies have not dealt with the application of deep-learning-based deblurring methods in fiducial marker systems. Fiducial markers    are particular objects, commonly planar and black-and-white, that provide the environment with controllable artificial features. They are widely used in augmented reality and robotic systems  . Although the theories behind marker detection    and the deep-learning-based object detection  [ref]4 are different, as shown in Fig. 1, marker detection also suffers from motion blur. Marker detection is the first step and a fundamental requirement of high-level tasks   . Suppose that the vehicles in Fig. 1 utilize fiducial markers to acquire artificial features for marker-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)  , then the feature extraction will fail since the markers cannot be detected due to motion blur. Similarly, suppose that the vehicles in Fig. 1 employ the markers as 3D fiducials to obtain localization information directly for a visual servoing framework , the vehicle will lose its signal input (localization information) when the image is blurred. To the best of our knowledge, CCTag  is the only fiducial marker system that considers motion blur in its algorithm, however, the other visual fiducial marker systems     do not take motion blur as a routine case, which makes the adoption of the deblurring method vital in real-world applications involving fiducial markers. Despite deblurring performance rankings on public datasets, including GoPro [ref]3, being updated nearly on a monthly basis, the model sizes and runtimes of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches   tend to increase as well. This is unfriendly to real-time applications. On the contrary, the SOTA fiducial marker systems, such as AprilTag 3 , have already achieved real-time detection. Hence, the notable gap between deep-learning-based deblurring methods and fiducial marker systems is the runtime performance. To fill this gap, factors, including model size, FLOPs, and inference time, rather than solely the SOTA deblurring quality, need to be considered. This work aims to solve the above-mentioned problems and the contributions of this work are summarized as follows. 1) The development of a novel lightweight generative adversarial network, Ghost-DeblurGAN, for real-time deblurring. Although the proposed model is not the SOTA deblurring method compared with other non-lightweight implementations  , Ghost-DeblurGAN is more appropriate for real-time applications as it has a tiny model size and rapid inference time. 2) The proposal of a new large-scale dataset, YorkTag, that contains blurred images containing fiducial markers and their corresponding ground truth sharp images. The YorkTag can be used as a new benchmark for future deblurring research.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Motion blur resulting from camera shake and rapid object motion is frequently seen in photos or videos captured by, for instance, hand-held cameras as well as cameras onboard autonomous vehicles [ref]1  [ref]3.
