      "content": "Paper Title: Dot-depth three, return of the 𝒥-class\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLet 𝒞𝒞\\mathscr{C} be a prevariety. For all n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N}, we define two classes Poln​(𝒞)subscriptPol𝑛𝒞\\textup{Pol}_{n}(\\mathscr{C}) and BPoln​(𝒞)subscriptBPol𝑛𝒞\\textup{BPol}_{n}(\\mathscr{C}). We let Pol0​(𝒞)=BPol0​(𝒞)=𝒞subscriptPol0𝒞subscriptBPol0𝒞𝒞\\textup{Pol}_{0}(\\mathscr{C})\\!=\\!\\textup{BPol}_{0}(\\mathscr{C})\\!=\\!\\mathscr{C}. Then, for every n≥1𝑛1n\\geq 1, we define inductively Poln​(𝒞)=Pol​(BPoln−1​(𝒞))subscriptPol𝑛𝒞PolsubscriptBPol𝑛1𝒞\\textup{Pol}_{n}(\\mathscr{C})=\\textup{Pol}(\\textup{BPol}_{n-1}(\\mathscr{C})) and BPoln​(𝒞)=BPol​(BPoln−1​(𝒞))=Bool​(Poln​(𝒞))subscriptBPol𝑛𝒞BPolsubscriptBPol𝑛1𝒞BoolsubscriptPol𝑛𝒞\\textup{BPol}_{n}(\\mathscr{C})=\\textup{BPol}(\\textup{BPol}_{n-1}(\\mathscr{C}))=\\textup{Bool}(\\textup{Pol}_{n}(\\mathscr{C})). We say that the class BPoln​(𝒞)subscriptBPol𝑛𝒞\\textup{BPol}_{n}(\\mathscr{C}) is level n𝑛n in the concatenation hierarchy of basis 𝒞𝒞\\mathscr{C}. Note that we have BPoln​(𝒞)⊆Poln+1​(𝒞)⊆BPoln+1​(𝒞)subscriptBPol𝑛𝒞subscriptPol𝑛1𝒞subscriptBPol𝑛1𝒞\\textup{BPol}_{n}(\\mathscr{C})\\subseteq\\textup{Pol}_{n+1}(\\mathscr{C})\\subseteq\\textup{BPol}_{n+1}(\\mathscr{C}) for n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N}. We are mainly interested in “full” levels BPoln​(𝒞)subscriptBPol𝑛𝒞\\textup{BPol}_{n}(\\mathscr{C}). However, the classes Poln​(𝒞)subscriptPol𝑛𝒞\\textup{Pol}_{n}(\\mathscr{C}) are important tools in the paper. Historically, the first concatenation hierarchy is the dot-depth (Brzozowski, Cohen ) of basis DD={∅,{ε},A+,A∗}DD𝜀superscript𝐴superscript𝐴\\textup{DD}=\\{\\emptyset,\\{\\varepsilon\\},A^{+},A^{*}\\}. Thomas  proved that the dot-depth corresponds exactly to the quantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic with the linear order and the successor (FO​(<,+1)FO1\\textup{FO}(<,+1)). More precisely, Poln​(DD)=Σn​(<,+1)subscriptPol𝑛DDsubscriptΣ𝑛1\\textup{Pol}_{n}(\\textup{DD})=\\Sigma_{n}(<,+1) and BPoln​(DD)=ℬ​Σn​(<,+1)subscriptBPol𝑛DDℬsubscriptΣ𝑛1\\textup{BPol}_{n}(\\textup{DD})=\\mathscr{B}\\Sigma_{n}(<,+1) for all n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N}. This logical characterization extends to arbitrary concatenation hierarchies : for every prevariety 𝒞𝒞\\mathscr{C}, there exists a set 𝕀𝒞subscript𝕀𝒞\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathscr{C}} of first-order predicates such that Poln​(𝒞)=Σn​(𝕀𝒞)subscriptPol𝑛𝒞subscriptΣ𝑛subscript𝕀𝒞\\textup{Pol}_{n}(\\mathscr{C})=\\Sigma_{n}(\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathscr{C}}) and BPoln​(𝒞)=ℬ​Σn​(𝕀𝒞)subscriptBPol𝑛𝒞ℬsubscriptΣ𝑛subscript𝕀𝒞\\textup{BPol}_{n}(\\mathscr{C})=\\mathscr{B}\\Sigma_{n}(\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathscr{C}}) for all n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N}. Group based hierarchies. Prevarieties consisting of group languages are prominent bases. Group languages are those that can be recognized by a morphism into a finite group. A group prevariety is a prevariety 𝒢𝒢\\mathscr{G} that contains only group languages. We use bases that are group prevarieties as well as slight extensions thereof. For each class 𝒢𝒢\\mathscr{G}, we let 𝒢+superscript𝒢\\mathscr{G}^{+} be the class consisting of all languages {ε}∪L𝜀𝐿\\{\\varepsilon\\}\\cup L and A+∩Lsuperscript𝐴𝐿A^{+}\\cap L for L∈𝒢𝐿𝒢L\\in\\mathscr{G}. One may verify that if 𝒢𝒢\\mathscr{G} is a prevariety, then so is 𝒢+superscript𝒢\\mathscr{G}^{+}. Also, 𝒢+superscript𝒢\\mathscr{G}^{+} contains the languages {ε}𝜀\\{\\varepsilon\\} and A+superscript𝐴A^{+}. Let us present three standard group prevarieties. The trivial prevariety ST={∅,A∗}STsuperscript𝐴\\textup{ST}=\\{\\emptyset,A^{*}\\} yields a hierarchy introduced by Straubing  and Thérien . It characterizes the alternation hierarchy of first-order logic equipped with only the linear order (FO​(<)FO\\textup{FO}(<)). Also, ST+=DDsuperscriptSTDD\\textup{ST}^{+}=\\textup{DD}: the hierarchy of basis ST+superscriptST\\textup{ST}^{+} is the dot-depth. Another example is the prevariety MOD of modulo languages (membership of a word in the language depends only on its length modulo some fixed integer). The hierarchies of bases MOD and MOD+superscriptMOD\\textup{MOD}^{+} characterize the alternation hierarchies of FO​(<,M​O​D)FO𝑀𝑂𝐷\\textup{FO}(<,MOD) and FO​(<,+1,M​O​D)FO1𝑀𝑂𝐷\\textup{FO}(<,+1,MOD), where “MOD” is the set of modular predicates, see e.g., . Finally, let us mention the group hierarchy of Margolis and Pin . Its basis is the class GR of all group languages. There are many papers investigating membership, separation and covering for particular hierarchies of this kind (see e.g.,       [ref]40 ). Yet, proving that they are decidable for all levels remains a longstanding open question in automata theory. In the paper, we shall use the following generic theorem of  , which applies to level one in an arbitrary group based hierarchy. Let 𝒢𝒢\\mathscr{G} be a group prevariety with decidable separation. Then, BPol​(𝒢)BPol𝒢\\textup{BPol}(\\mathscr{G}) and BPol​(𝒢+)BPolsuperscript𝒢\\textup{BPol}(\\mathscr{G}^{+}) have decidable covering. This result can be pushed further for the Straubing-Thérien hierarchy and the dot-depth. The following is proved in [ref]42. BPol2​(ST)subscriptBPol2ST\\textup{BPol}_{2}(\\textup{ST}) and BPol2​(DD)subscriptBPol2DD\\textup{BPol}_{2}(\\textup{DD}) have decidable covering. We prove a generic characterization of BPol. It implies that if a non-zero full level has decidable covering, then the next full level has decidable membership. By Theorem 24, it follows that if 𝒢𝒢\\mathscr{G} is a group prevariety with decidable separation, then BPol2​(𝒢)subscriptBPol2𝒢\\textup{BPol}_{2}(\\mathscr{G}) and BPol2​(𝒢+)subscriptBPol2superscript𝒢\\textup{BPol}_{2}(\\mathscr{G}^{+}) have decidable membership. Also, Theorem 25 implies that BPol3​(ST)subscriptBPol3ST\\textup{BPol}_{3}(\\textup{ST}) and BPol3​(DD)subscriptBPol3DD\\textup{BPol}_{3}(\\textup{DD}) have decidable membership.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: Margolis and Pin .
