An important aspect of the how of OCI is the human staff’s response to the machine intelligence. Historically, people preferred human over algorithmic judgment (i.e., machine or artificial intelligence)  . Whenever and wherever this tendency still exists, it may challenge OCI. Fortunately, algorithm aversion is not a foregone conclusion of human behavior—increasingly, researchers are observing instances of the opposite, that is, people seeking out algorithmic input . Unfortunately, people occasionally put too much trust in algorithmic decision aids  , which may also challenge OCI. Thus, a pivotal human factor of a successful OCI is well-calibrated trust in its machine intelligence. A well-calibrated decision-maker will know when to heed and ignore an OCI’s input. From a design perspective, this reality suggests a need for implementing tools to measure and predict trust in the OCI   along with ways to calibrate that trust. The trust calibration literature is quite broad, but some obvious, simple steps include engineering the messages such that they guide users to the appropriate level of trust  and providing interpretable explanations of the system’s output  . Extensive evidence across a variety of domains supports the observation that a crowd can outperform experts [ref]15  . Nevertheless, expertise still matters: Clever aggregation that weighs individual contributors’ forecast relative to their knowledge can yield even wiser crowds [ref]7   . For example, in an image annotation setting where multiple annotators labeled images, modeling individual annotators as multidimensional entities with competence, expertise, and bias variables resulted in better aggregation of their opinions . A similar result was observed in studies that asked participants to forecast current events and economic outcomes . Situational factors, however, may undermine the effect of individual expertise. One study asked participants to estimate corporate earnings and found that having access to public information resulted in participants under-weighting their own private information . This behavior resulted in individual estimates that were more accurate but crowd estimates that were less accurate—a result that underscores how important aggregation that accounts for human factors is to an OCI.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: level of trust  and providing interpretable explanations of the system’s output  .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
