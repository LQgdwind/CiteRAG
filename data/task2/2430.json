Positive/Negative Approximate Multipliers for DNN Accelerators\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nApproximate DNN accelerators have attracted a vast research interest.\nA significant fraction of a DNN operations (about 90%) is attributed to GEMM operations, i.e., convolution and matrix multiplications .\nSuch computations rely on MAC units and the state of the art approximates the multipliers to boost the energy efficiency of the overall accelerator.\nCartesian Genetic Programming is used in   to generate fixed approximate multipliers and replace the accurate ones, achieving high hardware gains for a minimal accuracy loss or even accuracy improvement.\n introduced a multiplier-less artificial neuron that is based on additions only.\nNevertheless,    require retraining, which as aforementioned is not always feasible. In [ref]6 the authors avoid retraining and use layer-based approximation\nin which a different fixed approximate multiplier from 3 is used per layer.\nIn addition, a weight tuning method is employed targeting to reduce the introduced multiplication error.\nThe work in  extends the approximate multipliers of 3 and shows that, in simple DNNs, high energy gains and minimal accuracy loss can be achieved, even without retraining.\nHowever, for more complex DNNs the energy gains are not maintained.\nAcknowledging the need for runtime reconfiguration,  generates approximate multipliers with dynamically reconfigurable accuracy and uses them to apply layer-wise approximation in DNNs by changing the multiplier’s accuracy mode per layer.\nThe work in  uses  to generate low variance approximate reconfigurable multipliers, and proposes a weight-oriented approximation for DNN inference.\n employs a curable approximation in which the MAC’s adder is split into low and high parts and the carry of low part is accumulated by the neighboring MAC unit.\nThe carry of the last MAC unit is not corrected.\nHowever,  is evaluated on the LeNet architecture, a very shallow architecture which cannot provide the amount of operations recent DNNs do.\nThe work in  uses the Canonic Sign Digit Encoding to represent the weights and employs truncation as an approximation method.\nThe architecture proposed in  uses Dynamic and Static Segmented approximate multipliers that support high and low precision for the size of the segment.\nA trainable input classifier is used to select the required precision per segment.\n8 targets energy consumption minimization of MAC-based signal processing algorithms.\n8 utilizes different fixed approximate multipliers in an interleaved manner to compensate errors during the accumulate operations.\nNevertheless,  8 consider 161616-bit inference and can be deemed inapplicable in modern DNN accelerators that use mainly 888-bit precision .\nFinally,  introduces a control variate approximation to recover the accuracy loss due to approximate multiplications.\nThe overall convolution error is estimated at runtime and it is finally accumulated in the output result. However, for the error accumulation, it requires an additional column of MAC units. Our work differentiates from the state of the art as since it does not require retraining and it employs a reconfigurable multiplier that supports positive/negative error as well as accurate execution.\nIn addition, we propose a filter-oriented weight mapping methodology to map DNNs to the modes of the approximate multiplier so that given accuracy loss constraints are satisfied.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: or even accuracy improvement.\n introduced a multiplier-less artificial neuron that is based on additions only.\nNevertheless,    require retraining, which as aforementioned is not always feasible. In [ref]6 the authors avoid retraining and use layer-based approximation\nin which a different fixed approximate multiplier from 3 is used per layer.\nIn addition, a weight tuning method is employed\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
