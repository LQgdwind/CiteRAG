While any child can explain what an “apple” is by enumerating its characteristics, deep neural networks (DNNs) fail to explain what they learn in human-understandable terms despite their high prediction accuracy . This accuracy-vs-interpretability trade-off has become a major concern as high-performing DNNs become commonplace in practice  [ref]3 , thus questioning the ethical   and legal   ramifications of their deployment. Concept bottleneck models (CBMs, [ref]9, Figure 1(a)) aim at replacing “black-box” DNNs by first learning to predict a set of concepts, that is, “interpretable” high-level units of information (e.g., “color” or “shape”) 0 provided at training time 1 2, and then using these concepts to learn a downstream classification task. Predicting tasks as a function of concepts engenders user trust 3 by allowing predictions to be explained in terms of concepts and by supporting human interventions, where at test-time an expert can correct a mispredicted concept, possibly changing the CBM’s output. That said, concept bottlenecks may impair task accuracy [ref]9 4, especially when concept labels do not contain all the necessary information for accurately predicting a downstream task (i.e., they form an “incomplete” representation of the task 5), as seen in Figure 1(b). In principle, extending a CBM’s bottleneck with a set of unsupervised neurons may improve task accuracy, as observed by Mahinpei et al. 4. However, as we will demonstrate in this work, such a hybrid approach not only significantly hinders the performance of concept interventions, but it also affects the interpretability of the learnt bottleneck, thus undermining user trust 3. Therefore, we argue that novel concept-based architectures are required to overcome the current accuracy/interpretability pitfalls of CBMs, thus enabling their deployment in real-world settings where concept annotations are likely to be incomplete. In this paper, we propose Concept Embedding Models (CEMs), a novel concept bottleneck model (described in Section 3) which overcomes the current accuracy-vs-interpretability trade-off found in concept-incomplete settings (as shown in Figure 1(c)). Furthermore, we introduce two new metrics for evaluating concept representations (Section 4) and use them to help understand why our approach circumvents the limits found in the current state-of-the-art CBMs (Section 5). Our experiments show that CEM (1) attains better or competitive task accuracy w.r.t. standard DNNs trained without concept supervision, (2) learns concept representations that capture meaningful semantics at least as well as vanilla CBMs, and (3) supports effective test-time concept interventions.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: in human-understandable terms despite their high prediction accuracy .
