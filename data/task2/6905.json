Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Static methods include TransE , DistMult , ComplEx , R-GCN , ConvE , and RotatE . Temporal models include HyTE , TTransE , TA-DistMult , DySAT , TeMP , DyRep+MLP , R-GCRN+MLP , RE-NET [ref]13, xERTE , TLogic , RE-GCN , TANGO-TuckER [ref]18, TANGO-Distmult [ref]18, CyGNet [ref]28, EvoKG , and HIP . Some of the temporal baselines (HyTE, TTransE, and TeMP) are not applicable to event forecasting since they are proposed to handle graph interpolation, whereas our work focuses on the extrapolation task. Thus, we deal with them in the way of previous work [ref]13 [ref]28 , which is trivial to mention.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: approaches. Static methods include TransE , DistMult , ComplEx , R-GCN , ConvE , and RotatE .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
