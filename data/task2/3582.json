Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Model Inversion Attack against Transfer Learning: Inverting a Model without Accessing It\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFredrikson et al. [ref]14 initiated the research of model inversion attacks on personalized Warfarin dosing in a black-box manner.\nTheir method works by estimating the probability of a potential target attribute given the available information and the model.\n Unlike Fredrikson et al.’s optimization-based methods, Yang et al.’s method  is training-based. It inverts a model by learning a second model that acts as the inverse of the original one.\nThe second model takes the predicted confidence vectors of the original model as input, and outputs reconstructed data.\nZhao et al. [ref]47 improved Yang et al.’s work  by incorporating image explanations into the target model’s output vectors.\nThe explanations and vectors are then used together to train an inversion model.\nAlthough Zhao et al.’s method outperforms Yang et al.’s method, Zhao et al’s method requires that either the target model can output image explanations\nor the attacker can train a surrogate model with the same functions as the target model.\nHowever, neither of these requirements is feasible in our problem. In addition to the prevalent setting, model inversion attacks have also been studied in other settings.\nSalem et al. [ref]28 studied data reconstruction attacks in an online learning setting,\nwhile Carlini et al.  studied data extraction from language models.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: Fredrikson et al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
