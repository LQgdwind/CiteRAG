      "content": "Paper Title: DiffAugment: Diffusion based Long-Tailed Visual Relationship Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this work, we perform experiments on the GQA-LT dataset built on top of Visual Genome by [ref]2. It has 72,5807258072,580 training images, 2,57325732,573 validation images and 7,72277227,722 test images; with 1,70317031,703 objects and 310310310 relations. The most frequent object and relation has 374,282374282374,282 and 1,692,06816920681,692,068 examples,\nand the least frequent has 111 and 222 respectively. Following the strategy used by [ref]2, the dataset is split into three parts– Many, Medium, Few and the selection ratio of each split is based on the frequency of each class: Many (top 5%percent55\\%s - 86 classes for S/O and 16 classes for R), Medium(middle 15%percent1515\\% - 255 classes for S/O and 46 classes for R), Few (remaining 80%percent8080\\% - 1362 classes for S/O and 248 classes for R).\nBaseline Models We evaluate the effect of our diffusion based augmentation on two state-of-the-art Visual Relationship Recognition approaches – LSVRU  and RelTransformer [ref]5.\nFor both the baselines, we also consider models trained using class-balancing loss functions such as weighted cross-entropy loss (WCE) for fine-tuning. For both the methods, since trained model checkpoints are not publicly available, we train the models from scratch using their official implementations111https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/RelTransformer, https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/LTVRR/tree/ltvrd-challenge-2023 in order to get baseline results222We are unable to reproduce the performance reported for RelTransformer with WCE loss using the official implementation. Hence we report the fine-tuning results based upon the performance that we get in Table 1. and further fine-tune them on our generated samples.\nEvaluation metrics The main metric used is the average per-class accuracy, which is the accuracy of each class calculated separately, then averaged.\nImplementation details For augmenting the triplets in stage 1 (Section 3.2), we consider the triplets containing either few or medium classes and augment with synsets having LCH similarity greater than or equal to 2.26 (empirical value). The CLIP text encoder produces a 768-D linguistic embedding while the Faster-RCNN output is a 4096-D visual embedding. In order to calculate the hardness of each triplet, K-means clustering is performed with 1200 cluster centres, thus giving a 1200-D hardness vector for each triplet after L1 normalization. A total of 48K augmented triplets from few classes and 48K augmented triplets from medium classes are used for the experiments. While the training of the baselines required 8 Nvidia V100 GPUs with a batch size of 8 and is done for 12 epochs, finetuning can be performed on a single GPU. We use a batch size of 256 for the augmented visual embeddings’ data loading and fine-tune for 10 epochs on the augmented data. \n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Methods\nSubject/Object\nRelation\nCombined\n\nmany\nmedium\nfew\nall\nmany\nmedium\nfew\nall\nall\n\n86\n255\n1362\n1703\n16\n46\n248\n310\n2013\n\nArchitecture: LSVRU \n\nCE\n68.24\n36.34\n6.74\n14.28\n60.24\n13.70\n6.34\n10.22\n12.25\n\nCE + DiffAugment\n62.23\n41.77\n10.14\n17.51\n35.21\n23.94\n8.04\n11.80\n14.66\n\nCE + VilHub + RelMix\n68.80\n44.20\n10.26\n18.30\n63.86\n12.00\n6.83\n10.55\n14.42\n\nCE + VilHub + RelMix + DiffAugment\n62.66\n44.08\n12.79\n19.99\n48.94\n19.20\n7.89\n11.69\n15.84\n\nWCE\n54.83\n43.32\n12.25\n19.05\n52.75\n35.17\n13.03\n18.37\n18.71\n\nWCE + DiffAugment\n39.83\n33.90\n17.33\n20.95\n37.37\n37.72\n18.13\n22.03\n21.49\n\nArchitecture: RelTransformer [ref]5\n\nCE\n72.45\n50.06\n11.69\n20.50\n62.48\n16.83\n7.45\n11.69\n16.10\n\nCE + DiffAugment\n70.55\n50.47\n13.23\n21.70\n47.89\n30.13\n7.09\n12.62\n17.16\n\nWCE\n53.67\n47.35\n19.47\n25.37\n54.86\n38.96\n15.10\n20.70\n23.04\n\nWCE + DiffAugment\n39.16\n38.04\n22.68\n25.81\n45.19\n40.19\n18.01\n22.71\n24.26\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Method\nFine-tuning\nSubject/Object\nRelation\nCombined\n\nstrategy\nmany\nmedium\nfew\nall\nmany\nmedium\nfew\nall\nall\n\n\n86\n255\n1362\n1703\n16\n46\n248\n310\n2013\n\nLSVRU \n\nWCE + DiffAugment\nRandom\n39.83\n33.90\n17.33\n20.95\n37.37\n37.72\n18.13\n22.03\n21.49\n\nEasy then Hard\n37.34\n31.43\n17.74\n20.78\n38.39\n37.56\n18.64\n22.47\n21.62\n\nRelTransformer [ref]5\n\nCE + DiffAugment\nRandom\n70.55\n50.47\n13.23\n21.70\n47.89\n30.13\n7.09\n12.62\n17.16\n\nEasy then Hard\n70.05\n51.10\n14.00\n22.39\n55.38\n24.65\n6.97\n12.09\n17.24\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: In this work, we perform experiments on the GQA-LT dataset built on top of Visual Genome by [ref]2.
