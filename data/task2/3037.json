      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Attention-guided Graph Clustering with Dual Self-supervision\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClustering is one of the fundamental tasks in data analysis, which aims to categorize samples into multiple groups according to their intrinsic similarities, and has been successfully applied to many real-world applications such as image processing   [ref]3 [ref]4 , face recognition   , and object detection  0 1.\nRecently, with the booming of deep learning, numerous researchers have paid attention to deep embedding clustering analysis, which could effectively learn a clustering-friendly representation by extracting intrinsic patterns from the latent embedding space.\nFor example,\nHinton and Salakhutdinov 2 developed a deep auto-encoder (DAE) framework that first conducts embedding learning and then performs K-means 3 to obtain clustering results.\nXie et al. 4 designed a deep embedding clustering method (DEC) to perform embedding learning and cluster assignment jointly.\nGuo et al. 5 improved DEC by introducing a reconstruction loss to preserve data structure. Although these DAE-based approaches obtain impressive improvement, they neglect the underlying topological structure among data, which has demonstrated its importance in various works 6 7 8. Recently, a series of works have been proposed to use graph convolutional networks (GCNs) 9 to exploit the topological structure information.\nFor instance,\nKipf et al. 0 incorporated GCN into DAE and variational DAE, and proposed graph auto-encoder (GAE) and variational graph auto-encoder (VGAE), respectively.\nPan et al. 1 designed an adversarially regularized graph auto-encoder network (ARGA) to promote GAE.\nWang et al. 2 incorporated graph attention networks 3 into GAE for attributed graph clustering.\nBo et al. 4 fused GCN into DEC to consider the node content and topological structure information at the same time. However, these works still suffer from the following drawbacks.\nFirst, they equate the importance of the features extracted from DAE and GCN, e.g., in 4, the DAE and GCN features of a typical layer are averaged. Such a simple fusion strategy is not a good choice since those features contain different characteristic information.\nSecond, they neglect the multi-scale information embedded in different layers, which may lead to inferior clustering results.\nThird, they output two probability distributions capable of obtaining the final clustering results; however, the complex real-world datasets are usually agnostic and vastly different, so it is difficult to decide which one should be used to get the final clustering results. To the best of our knowledge, this is a decision-making dilemma for those kinds of deep graph clustering methods.\nLast but not least, the previous approaches fail to adequately exploit the available information from the high-confidence clustering assignments. To address the above-mentioned drawbacks, we propose a novel deep embedding clustering method, focusing on exploiting the available off-the-shelf information from feature embeddings and cluster assignments. As shown in Figure 1, the proposed method consists of a heterogeneity111Here, ‘heterogeneity’ indicates the discrimination of feature structure, e.g., the DAE-based feature structure and the GCN-based feature structure.-wise fusion (HWF) module, a scale-wise fusion (SWF) module, a distribution-wise fusion (DWF) module, a soft self-supervision (SSS) strategy, and a hard self-supervision (HSS) strategy. A preliminary version of this work was published in ACM Multimedia 2021 5, which can be regarded as a special case of the current version that focuses on embedding enhancement via the HWF and SWF modules. However, the conference paper suffers from the decision-making dilemma concerning two learned probability distributions from DAE and GCN, i.e., which one should be selected as the final clustering assignment result. In summary, the main contributions of this journal paper are as follows: To handle the decision-making dilemma, we propose a learning-aware fusion module to adaptively fuse the learned data probability distributions to predict the clustering results. In addition, for the two learned distributions, we improve the soft self-supervision strategy to better preserve the distribution consistency alignment. Moreover, for the aforementioned fused distribution, we develop a hard self-supervision strategy with a pseudo supervision loss to employ the high-confidence clustering assignments to improve clustering performance. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets validate that our method consistently outperforms the conference version 5. For instance, on DBLP, our method improves the ARI by more than 14.80%. In addition, the ablation studies and visualizations quantitatively and qualitatively validate the effectiveness of this method. We organize the rest of this paper as follows. Section II briefly reviews the related works. Section III introduces the proposed network architecture, followed by the experimental results and analyses in Section IV.
