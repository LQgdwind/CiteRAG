The nonlinear coupling between the Maxwell and DD equations is accounted for by alternately feeding their updated solutions into each other during the time integration [ref]23. Each set of equations is discretized using a time-domain DG (DGTD) method    that uses its own time-step size [ref]23. The time-dependent electron DD equations in the unit cell are expressed as an initial-boundary value problem (IBVP) [ref]23 where n​(𝐫,t)𝑛𝐫𝑡n({\\mathbf{r}},t) and 𝐪​(𝐫,t)𝐪𝐫𝑡{\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{r}},t) are the unknowns to be solved for,\nd​(𝐫)𝑑𝐫d({\\mathbf{r}}) and 𝐯​(𝐫,t)𝐯𝐫𝑡{\\mathbf{v}}({\\mathbf{r}},t) are known coefficients, R​(𝐫,t)=Rt​(net,nht)−G​(𝐄t,𝐇t)𝑅𝐫𝑡superscript𝑅𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑛𝑒𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑛ℎ𝑡𝐺superscript𝐄𝑡superscript𝐇𝑡R({\\mathbf{r}},t)={R^{t}}(n_{e}^{t},n_{h}^{t})-G({{\\mathbf{E}}^{t}},{{\\mathbf{H}}^{t}}) is the net-recombination, Rt​(ne,nh)superscript𝑅𝑡subscript𝑛𝑒subscript𝑛ℎR^{t}({n_{e}},{n_{h}}) is the transient recombination rate, and G​(𝐄,𝐇)𝐺𝐄𝐇G({\\mathbf{E}},{\\mathbf{H}}) is the generation rate  [ref]23. Here, to simplify the notation, the subscript “e” is dropped. The IBVP for holes only differs by the sign in front of the drift term. Apart from the time dependency and the time derivative term on the left side of (27), the system has the same form as (19)-(23). Using the same spatial discretization as that used for (19)-(23), one can obtain the semi-discrete form [ref]23 where N¯k​(t)subscript¯𝑁𝑘𝑡{\\bar{N}_{k}(t)} and Q¯k​(t)subscript¯𝑄𝑘𝑡{\\bar{Q}}_{k}(t) unknown vectors storing time-dependent basis expansion coefficients, B¯kn​(t)superscriptsubscript¯𝐵𝑘𝑛𝑡\\bar{B}_{k}^{n}(t) and B¯k𝐪superscriptsubscript¯𝐵𝑘𝐪\\bar{B}_{k}^{\\mathbf{q}} are vectors constructed from the net-recombination and boundary conditions (other than PBC), M¯k​ksubscript¯𝑀𝑘𝑘{{\\bar{M}}_{kk}}, C¯k​ksubscript¯𝐶𝑘𝑘{\\bar{C}_{kk}}/C¯k​k′subscript¯𝐶𝑘superscript𝑘′{\\bar{C}_{kk^{\\prime}}}, G¯k​ksubscript¯𝐺𝑘𝑘{\\bar{G}_{kk}}/G¯k​k′subscript¯𝐺𝑘superscript𝑘′{\\bar{G}_{kk^{\\prime}}}, and D¯k​ksubscript¯𝐷𝑘𝑘{{\\bar{D}}_{kk}}/D¯k​k′subscript¯𝐷𝑘superscript𝑘′{{\\bar{D}}_{kk^{\\prime}}} are the elemental mass, convection, gradient, and divergence matrices, respectively [ref]23. The numerical fluxes and boundary conditions are the same as those used in the stationary DD equations. The semi-discretized system (32)-(33) is integrated in time using an explicit third-order total-variation-diminishing Runge-Kutta scheme . Likewise, Maxwell equations in the unit cell are expressed as the following IBVP where 𝐄​(𝐫,t)𝐄𝐫𝑡{{\\mathbf{E}}}({\\mathbf{r}},t) and 𝐇​(𝐫,t)𝐇𝐫𝑡{{\\mathbf{H}}}({\\mathbf{r}},t) are the transient electric and magnetic fields, μ​(r)𝜇r\\mu(\\textbf{r}) is the permeability, 𝐉​(𝐫,t)𝐉𝐫𝑡{\\mathbf{J}}({\\mathbf{r}},t) is the transient current density, and U∈{𝐄,𝐇}𝑈𝐄𝐇U\\in\\{\\mathbf{E},\\mathbf{H}\\}. Discretizing (34)-(38) with the DGTD method      yields where E¯kν​(t)superscriptsubscript¯𝐸𝑘𝜈𝑡\\bar{E}_{k}^{\\nu}(t) and H¯kν​(t)superscriptsubscript¯𝐻𝑘𝜈𝑡\\bar{H}_{k}^{\\nu}(t) are unknown vectors storing time-dependent basis expansion coefficients, J¯kν​(t)superscriptsubscript¯𝐽𝑘𝜈𝑡\\bar{J}_{k}^{\\nu}(t) is the current density vector, εksubscript𝜀𝑘\\varepsilon_{k} and μksubscript𝜇𝑘\\mu_{k} are the constant permittivity and permeability in element k𝑘k, D¯kν=M¯k−1​S~kνsuperscriptsubscript¯𝐷𝑘𝜈superscriptsubscript¯𝑀𝑘1superscriptsubscript~𝑆𝑘𝜈\\bar{D}_{k}^{\\nu}={\\bar{M}_{k}^{-1}}\\tilde{S}_{k}^{\\nu}, and F¯k=M¯k−1​L~ksubscript¯𝐹𝑘superscriptsubscript¯𝑀𝑘1subscript~𝐿𝑘\\bar{F}_{k}={\\bar{M}_{k}^{-1}}{\\tilde{L}_{k}}, where M¯ksubscript¯𝑀𝑘{\\bar{M}_{k}}, S~kνsuperscriptsubscript~𝑆𝑘𝜈{\\tilde{S}_{k}^{\\nu}}, and L~ksubscript~𝐿𝑘{\\tilde{L}_{k}} are the mass, stiffness, and surface mass matrices, respectively . In (39)-(44), Fk𝐄,ν​(t)superscriptsubscript𝐹𝑘𝐄𝜈𝑡F_{k}^{{\\mathbf{E}},\\nu}(t) and Fk𝐇,ν​(t)superscriptsubscript𝐹𝑘𝐇𝜈𝑡F_{k}^{{\\mathbf{H}},\\nu}(t) are the ν𝜈\\nu components of 𝐧^×[𝐇k​(t)−𝐇k∗​(t)]^𝐧delimited-[]subscript𝐇𝑘𝑡superscriptsubscript𝐇𝑘𝑡\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}\\times[{\\mathbf{H}_{k}}(t)-{\\mathbf{H}}_{k}^{*}(t)] and 𝐧^×[𝐄k​(t)−𝐄k∗​(t)]^𝐧delimited-[]subscript𝐄𝑘𝑡superscriptsubscript𝐄𝑘𝑡\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}\\times[{\\mathbf{E}_{k}}(t)-{\\mathbf{E}}_{k}^{*}(t)], respectively, ν∈{x,y,z}𝜈𝑥𝑦𝑧\\nu\\in\\{x,y,z\\}.\nThe upwind flux  is used here: where Z𝑍Z and Y𝑌Y are the wave impedance and wave admittance, respectively.
