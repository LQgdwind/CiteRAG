The traffic assignment problem (TAP) is one of the most prominent routing problems, with a long history dating back to the 50â€™ .\nIn this work, we consider the integer traffic assignment problem (ITAP), a variant of TAP where the flows on edges are constrained to be integers. We are given a graph representing the roads in a city and a list of origin-destination (OD) pairs, each one representing a commuter that must move from one point to the other. For each OD pair we must find a path connecting the origin node to the destination node, while minimizing some congestion measure on the edges of the graph. Intuitively we want to distribute the paths (commuters) so that no edge (road) becomes too congested. While in TAP, for each OD pair, we are allowed to split the flow across several paths each carrying a fractional amount of the flow, in ITAP, each path must carry an integer amount of flow, that is, an integer number of commuters. This restriction makes ITAP an NP-hard problem. From a physics standpoint one can see this system as a system of variable-length interacting polymers, where each polymer is clamped at its endpoints and is either attracted to or repelled from others . In TAP, the interaction between paths is commonly considered repulsive, the idea being that we want to minimize the congestion. In our work, we also consider the attractive case, where it is advantageous to merge paths as much as possible. This setting is motivated by network-building games in which one must build a graph that connects the OD pairs efficiently while minimizing the number of links used . Think, for example, of a city that has to build road infrastructure that reaches every house efficiently while minimizing the length of constructed roads. In such formulation one clearly incentivizes paths to share edges, that is, avoiding building a road between every pair of houses. In another example, one aims to route internet traffic through as few nodes as possible so as to turn off the rest and save energy . Our study aims to provide a systematic comparison of various algorithms for both the repulsive and attractive versions of the problem. We perform this study on random instances of the problem where the underlying graph is sparse and random with a varying average degree, the origin-destination pairs are selected uniformly at random among all the nodes, and we vary the number of the paths considered. Further, we vary the size of the graph while keeping the average degree constant. Considering such random benchmarks is common in the field of statistical physics of disordered systems where physical systems  are often modelled using a random realization of the disorder (here, the graph and the origin-destination pairs) and increasing the size of the system.\nStudying these random ensembles of instances then aims to identify properties that are prone to be universal in the sense that classes of real-world instances will exhibit analogous properties. The study of random instances of the ITAP problem was initiated in [ref]54, and here we extend it by examining more algorithms. From an algorithmic point of view, we are particularly interested in the performance gap between simple greedy heuristics and more sophisticated algorithms, such as the message passing algorithm from [ref]54 or simulated annealing, that aim to take into account the interactions between the paths in a more detailed manner. Another very common manner to solve an integer optimization problem is to relax it to a version with continuous variables and investigate the performance gap between the relaxed and integer problems.\n\nReference markers found: [54]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]54: properties that are prone to be universal in the sense that classes of real-world instances will exhibit analogous properties.
