      "content": "Paper Title: Fingerprinting Generative Adversarial Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe discuss some relevant works and highlight their differences from our solution. Watermarking GANs.\nCompared to classification models, IP protection of GAN models is much less explored. To our best knowledge, the only work is [ref]6, which designed a watermarking solution for GAN models. To embed a watermark into a protected GAN, the model owner needs to train the model from scratch, which is less practical for an already trained GAN. As discussed in Section I, watermarking has the limitations of usability and applicability  , which can be solved by fingerprinting. Using GANs for IP protection.\nSome works utilized GANs to enhance or defeat IP protection methods. For instance,  adopted GANs to generate watermarks for BERT language models.  applied GANs to identify and remove watermarks from classification models. Different from those works, our solutions focus on protecting GANs. Meta learning for fingerprinting.\nPan et al.  propose a meta-learning-based fingerprinting scheme, which is a task-agnostic framework independent of the tasks. They adopt a number of positive and negative suspect models, where the positive suspect models are derived from the protected model based on pruning, fine-tuning, and distillation, and the negative models are models different from the target model for different training data or model structures. Although their framework shows robustness against various attacks, we argue that it is not practical to protect GANs for commercial use. In Appendix H, we show the time to train a high-quality GAN. The heavy time cost makes this framework unrealistic in protecting state-of-the-art GANs. Detecting and attributing GAN-generated images.\nSome works [ref]56 [ref]57  leveraged fingerprints to detect GAN-generated images and trace their sources.\nHowever, they are not quite applicable to fingerprint GAN models for IP protection. For instance, [ref]57  require the model owner to modify the GAN model training process (e.g., training loss and training data) to have the capability of embedding fingerprints in the output images, which violates the requirement of model fingerprinting. In [ref]56,\nthe fingerprint in the output image is very sensitive to model transformations: “Even GAN training sets that differ in just one image can lead to distinct GAN instances [ref]56.” As a result, an adversary can just use a different training set to fine-tune the target GAN model to invalidate the fingerprint. In contrast, our methods do not need to modify the model, and exhibit higher unremovability.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: and highlight their differences from our solution.
