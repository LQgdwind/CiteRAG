      "content": "Paper Title: Sufficient Invariant Learning for Distribution Shift\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerally, machine learning algorithms assume that the training distribution and test distribution are drawn from the same distribution. Under this identically and independently distributed (IID) assumption, machine learning algorithms have shown significant performance improvements in diverse domains. However, in the real-world, this assumption does not hold, and distribution shifts, where the training and test distribution differ, occur frequently. In such scenarios, machine learning algorithms often exhibit significant deterioration of generalization performance on the shifted test distribution. Therefore, developing robust models that can handle the distribution shift is a key challenge in the field of machine learning [ref]12  [ref]32 [ref]39. One of the main difficulties of distribution shift is spurious correlation, which appears to describe the class well in the training distribution but fails to do so in the test distribution. The strong correlation between class and spurious features in the training set hinders the model from learning invariant features that describe their classes well and regardless of distribution shifts  . In subpopulation shift [ref]32 [ref]39, for example, practitioners aim to achieve balanced generalization performance across groups, represented by combinations of class and attribute. Spurious features serve as shortcuts for learning specific groups that dominate the training set, leading to the underrepresentation of groups comprised of relatively few data points  . Furthermore, spurious correlation can degrade the generalization performance for unseen domains. By learning common invariant features among multiple training domains, we can improve domain generalization performance. However, spurious correlations that exert a strong influence on specific domains disturb the learning of these domain-invariant features in domain shift settings [ref]12 . As a result, research in invariant learning has been pursued to remove spurious correlation, thereby enhancing the model robustness in various distribution shift scenarios  0  . However, even if our model successfully eliminates spurious correlations, the failure to learn a diverse set of invariant features could undermine its ability to guarantee generalization performance in the test domain. (Section 4.1). Specifically, if the invariant features learned by the model are absent in the test domain, the model will struggle to make accurate predictions under distribution shifts. As illustrated in Figure 1, a model that has learned a spurious feature performs poorly on shifted test samples. Despite using invariant learning algorithms to avoid learning spurious patterns, the model may still fail to capture a diverse set of features. For instance, a model that classifies ducks solely based on the shape of their webbed feet, yet fails to recognize a duck swimming in a pond as a duck. Therefore, building a robust model requires more than just eliminating spurious correlations; it also necessitates the learning of sufficiently diverse invariant features. We refer to this approach as Sufficient Invariant Learning (SIL). Through SIL, we aim to train a model that is more robust to distribution shifts and guarantees enhanced generalization performance (Section 4). One of the principal methods to improve generalization performance is to consider flatness. In IID setting, algorithms that take flatness into account have recently demonstrated superior performance in various tasks  1 . However, research considering flatness and its mechanism when spurious correlation exists is limited, and so far, it has been focused only on the domain shift situation  . In this paper, we present for the first time that considering flatness in distribution shift scenarios enables the model to learn a sufficiently diverse set of invariant features (Section 3.1). Additionally, we argue that flatness is essential to lower the generalization gap in general distribution shift situations, not just in domain shifts but also in subpopulation shifts, where strong spurious correlations significantly corrupt the generalization performance of the conventional Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) algorithm. To this end, we propose Adaptive Sharpness-aware Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (ASGDRO), which consistently achieves improved generalization performance in diverse distribution shifts scenarios by identifying the common flat minima for SIL (Section 3.2). We summarize our contributions as follows: We propose the necessity of SIL under distribution shift for the first time. Additionally, we argue that it is essential to find common flat minima across different groups or domains to achieve SIL. We propose ASGDRO, a SIL algorithm, designed to identify common flat minima. Moreover, we introduce a new dataset, Heterogeneous-CMNIST(H-CMNIST), which incorporates multiple invariant features along with spurious correlation, to demonstrate that ASGDRO is capable of learning a sufficiently diverse set of invariant features, unlike other invariant learning algorithms. We show the superior performance of ASGDRO across diverse distribution shifts. Using Grad-CAM and Hessian analysis, we show that ASGDRO achieves SIL and finds common flat minima.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: of generalization performance on the shifted test distribution.
