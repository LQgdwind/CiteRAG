      "content": "Paper Title: Estimating semantic structure for the VQA answer space\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVQA as a classification task — \nThe broad majority of works are approaching VQA as a classification task. This strategy simplifies the supervision part of the training and makes the VQA approaches easily comparable between each other. Indeed, many VQA approaches, including attention-based networks , object-based attention mechanisms , bilinear fusion methods , and, more recently, Transformer -based models , have been introduced and evaluated on the VQA classification benchmarks. Biases in VQA datasets — \nThe success of these works is in part due to the creation of large annotated VQA corpus. The VQAv1 [ref]1 dataset gathers more than 200k real-world images annotated with 760K questions in natural language. Moreover, each question is annotated with 10 ground truth answers in order to model the ambiguity and the disagreement between annotators. Nevertheless, as the data collection is fastidious and costly, VQAv1 suffers from numerous language biases as pointed out by many works such as , and  [ref]11.\nIn order to downplay the influence of the language bias,  released an updated version of the same dataset (baptized VQAv2) by carefully balancing the answer distribution per question type.\n went one step further by designing a fully synthetic dataset called CLEVR in which automatically generated questions are asked on synthetically generated 3D images. This corpus is thought as a diagnostic dataset aimed at evaluating the visual reasoning capability of the models.\nHowever, the limited environment of CLEVR  prevents from generalizing to complex realistic images such as in VQAv2 .\nFinally,  built the GQA dataset, a semi-synthetic dataset where automatically generated questions are asked on real images, which can be seen as an intermediate step between CLEVR and VQAv2. The generalization curse of VQA — \nNevertheless, despite the efforts made on data collection, the language bias issue persists and VQA models continue to suffer from the generalization curse. Early works raised an alarm by diagnosing many drawbacks on VQA models, such as their tendency to pay little attention to the image and to \\sayonly read half of the question [ref]11. Similarly, [ref]13 showed that attention-based models do not attend to the same visual regions as humans do. More recently,  pointed out the gender biases learned by image captioning models. To better diagnose the generalization gap on VQA,  reorganized VQAv1 [ref]1 and VQAv2  into the VQA-CP (VQA under Changing Priors), a new dataset where the per-question answer distribution of the train split is made explicitly different from the one in the test split. In particular, they show that a blind model (which only has access to the question without seeing the image) achieves a surprisingly high accuracy on VQAv2 – 44%percent4444\\% – whereas it reaches only 16%percent1616\\% on VQAv2-CP . Moreover, many of the successful models on VQA datasets fall short on VQA-CP unveiling their lack in visual understanding and their tendency to rely on question biases. Reducing language biases on VQA — \nTherefore, several works have recently tried to tackle this generalisation issue.  trained their model using an adversarial game against a question-only adversary in order to discourage the base model to rely on language prior. Similarly, the authors of RUBi  added a question-only branch to the base model during the training to adapt its prediction in order to prevent it from learning question biases. Other methods make use of additional annotated supervision to improve the generalization capability. Using the VQA-HAT dataset’s annotations [ref]13, the HINT  model is supervised to attend to the same visual regions as humans.\n built upon HINT proposing even a more sophisticated approach by carefully designing a three-steps learning strategy, named Self-Critical Reasoning (SRC).\nSRC accentuates the model sensitivity to the important visual regions.\nIt should be noted that SRC requires additional data annotations such as human attention maps [ref]13 or textual explanations .\nFinally,  introduced a Decomposed Linguistic Representation111To the best of our knowledge, at the time of writing of our paper, paper  has not yet been accepted to a peer-reviewed conference or journal. (DLR) approach consisting in learning to decompose the question into the \\saytype representation, \\sayobject representation and \\sayconcept representation. Although it allows to improve the model’s accuracy on VQAv2-CP , it causes a significant drop of performance on VQAv2 .\nIn this paper, we contribute to these efforts as we demonstrate how a semantic loss, helping the model to structure its output space, permits to reduce dependency towards language biases.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: have been introduced and evaluated on the VQA classification benchmarks.
