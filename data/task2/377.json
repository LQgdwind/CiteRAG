      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Predictive Coding Models in a Deep-Learning Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSpratling\n  used non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to reformulate the  model of predictive coding\nto make it compatible with biased competition models of the brain.\nA related technique, known as\ndivisive input modulation, offers promise of creating useful representations\nof subparts and is related to non-negative matrix factorization.\n showed that NMF\ncould create a useful object representation of, say faces,\nthat consisted of local subparts resembling eyes, nose, and mouth. More formally,\nconsider a set of images represented as an n×m𝑛𝑚n\\times m matrix, named 𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠\\mathit{Images},\nwhose entries are all non-negative values.\nThe matrix\n𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠\\mathit{Images} contains m𝑚m images, 𝑰1​…​𝑰msubscript𝑰1…subscript𝑰𝑚\\boldsymbol{I}_{1}\\ldots\\boldsymbol{I}_{m}.\nEach 𝑰msubscript𝑰𝑚\\boldsymbol{I}_{m}\nholds the\nset of N𝑁N non-negative pixel values\nfor one image.\nThe goal is to learn representations for the images by refactoring\nthe 𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠\\mathit{Images} matrix according\nto the constraint that all entries in the factors are non-negative.\nThe refactoring takes the form below. WTsuperscript𝑊𝑇W^{T} has dimension n×r𝑛𝑟n\\times r and R𝑅R has dimension r×m𝑟𝑚r\\times m.\nThink of WTsuperscript𝑊𝑇W^{T} as holding the feedback weights in a neural network and of R𝑅R\nas holding the transformed representation of each image within its columns.\nIts non-negativity constraints cause the matrix to be refactored into a parts-based\nrepresentation.\nThis is because the factorization only allows additive combinations .\nEach column of R𝑅R is an internal representation of the corresponding image in Images.\nr𝑟r is the number of rows of R𝑅R and this determines the size of the representation.\nFor instance, if using the example given in Fig. 2,\nn𝑛n would be 256 and r𝑟r would be 32.  has shown that by changing the operators used in the\npredictive coding formulas,\na method related to NMF\nknown as divisive input modulation\ncan be used\nwhich leads to some possible advantages over the  approach.\nConsider the revised\npredictive update equations shown below . Eqn. 7a matches Eqn. 1a, except that it obeys the NMF constraint.\nEqns. 7b and 7c match Eqns. 1b\nand 1c, except that they use different operators.\nSpecifically, predictive error in\nEqn. 7b is calculated using divisive input modulation,\nimplemented by element-wise division (⊘⊘\\oslash), instead\nof subtractive inhibition.\nFor divisive input modulation, perfect reconstruction yields a value of one instead of zero.\nFor Eqn. 7c, elementwise multiplication (⊙direct-product\\odot) is used instead of addition\nand this is an example of a multiplicative update rule .\nExpressions of the form “max⁡(ϵ,Matrix)italic-ϵMatrix\\max\\left(\\epsilon,\\mathrm{Matrix}\\right)” mean replace any values in MatrixMatrix\\mathrm{Matrix}\nthat are smaller than ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon with ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon.\nFor Eqn. 7b, this prevents division by zero\nand for Eqn. 7c this prevents any of the 𝒓𝒓\\boldsymbol{r} neurons\nfrom becoming permanently non-responsive.\nϵ1subscriptitalic-ϵ1\\epsilon_{1} and ϵ2subscriptitalic-ϵ2\\epsilon_{2} are small positive numbers and example values to use\nin simulations can be found in . The weight update rule uses multiplicative update and is shown below . Recall that when there is no prediction error, 𝒆T−1superscript𝒆𝑇1\\boldsymbol{e}^{T}-1 is zero and the right side\nof the operator ⊙direct-product\\odot simplifies to one.\nβ𝛽\\beta is a rate parameter.  provide batch-based algorithms for NMF, one of which minimizes\nthe Kulback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the training and reconstructed images (WT​𝒓superscript𝑊𝑇𝒓W^{T}\\boldsymbol{r}).\nWhereas, the equations of Rao/Ballard are obtained by minimizing sum of squared error,\nthe equations above minimize KL divergence.  argues that his model has a number of advantages over\nthe original  model.\nFirst, it can be implemented using only non-negative neural firing rates which makes it much easier to\ncreate bio-plausible implementations.\nSecond, it is broadly compatible biased competition models [ref]12 which also\nmakes it easier to create bio-plausible implementations.\nThird, it has been argued that the proposed feedback connections of the Spratling model\nare more biologically plausible than those in the  model.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: it can be implemented using only non-negative neural firing rates which makes it much easier to\ncreate bio-plausible implementations.\nSecond, it is broadly compatible biased competition models [ref]12 which also\nmakes it easier to create bio-plausible implementations.\nThird, it has been argued that the proposed feedback connections of the Spratling model\nare more biologically plausible\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
