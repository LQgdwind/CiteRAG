      "content": "Paper Title: MKF-ADS: Multi-Knowledge Fusion Based Self-supervised Anomaly Detection System for Control Area Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAuthentication-based and cryptography-based methods have been studied over the years by several researchers  . dariz et al.  provide a combined encryption and authentication mechanisms for vehicular network, and in  uses a dynamic symmetric key to encrypt the 8byte data payload but does not modify the CAN ID. Although these methods provide a certain security guarantee for IVN, they also suffer from response delays or increased bus loads . Alladi et al.  proposed a lightweight and secure authentication and attestation scheme for attesting vehicles while they are on the roads. Cui et al.  proposed a lightweight encryption and authentication scheme for the CAN bus of AVs using message authentication codes and Grain stream cipher. In short, they are either computationally demanding or protocol-modified, which prevents them from providing dependable efficient defense. Hence, providing security defense via MACs or encryption is not a straightforward proposition. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been widely studied owing to taking positive countermeasures in the event of attacks . Early IVN-IDSs identify malicious messages through a predefined knowledge base (e.g., frequency and entropy)   , but these methods have a high false positive rate (FPR) and cannot detect unknown attacks. Generally, statistics-based IDS are efficient and lightweight but may ignore low-volume and aperiodic frequency attacks. Machine learning-based methods have been extensively researched  . However, these approaches have a botnack in detection performance. Due to the great density of the generated vehicular data and enhanced computing resources, various deep learning-based strategies have recently been presented that outperform the current signature-based or machine-learning approaches. Song et al.  designed a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) based method for anomaly detection, removing the need for extracting handcrafted features. To extract valuable features, the CNN and LSTM-based deep learning model was presented by Xun et al. . The hybrid model was also introduced in  [ref]36. Further, Cheng et al.  incorporated attention mechanisms on this basis to reduce the false alarm rate. Javed et al. [ref]38 replaced the time-permissive feature extraction model LSTM with the GRU model to improve the inference speed. Although the detection capabilities of these methods have improved to varying degrees, they all rely heavily on a large number of pre-labeled labels for supervised learning and are not practical in defending against attack variants. Anomaly detection systems (ADSs) have been struggling to break through on how to model unknown attacks. Ashraf et al.  utilized auto-encoder (AE) to reconstruct the input messages via spatial-temporal features. Similarly, Agrawal et al.  presented a method that reconstructs sequence directly using spatial-temporal features and then detects anomalies based on threshold deviations. Jeong et al.  present explainable intrusion detection based on the self-supervised AE paradigm. Tariq et al.  trained a Convolutional LSTM-based model by transfer learning to identify attacks, called CANTrasfer. They also applied one-shot learning so the system could detect adaptive attacks, but the detection performance is relatively poor. Zhang et al.  presented graph convolutional neural network (GCNN)-based ADS to capture the falsification attacks. Considering that CAN messages always follow comparatively fixed patterns, ADS can use predictive analysis to detect complex cyber attacks. This paradigm is stringent excluding all suspicious messages that deviate from the prediction. Taylor et al. 3 and Qin et al.  developed the LSTM-based model to predict the next package, where the error measure is made using the predicted output value of the log loss function. Sun et al. 5 introduced convolution and attention mechanism (AM) to make up for valuable feature extraction. Interestingly, In  6 and  7, the outstanding model in NLP has been suggested applying to ADS (e.g. BERT 6 and GPT 7). Although the plentiful context features are incorporated, the number of model parameters is tens to hundreds of times higher than the previous scheme.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: removing the need for extracting handcrafted features.
