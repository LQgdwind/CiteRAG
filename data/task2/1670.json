      "content": "Paper Title: FeatureNorm: L2 Feature Normalization for Dynamic Graph Embedding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraphs are ubiquitous non-Euclidean data structures applied in various scenes, such as social networks, communication networks, and financial transaction networks, etc. Learning node representations in a latent space while preserving structural properties and interactive information stored in the original graph is one of the fundamental problems, which has attracted much attention in machine learning communities. Most existing node embedding works assume the graph is static and is associated with a fixed set of nodes and edges [ref]1, [ref]2, [ref]3. However, networks in many real-world application scenarios are intrinsically time-evolving. Evidence can be found in social networks, (traffic) communication networks, and financial transaction networks. Modeling dynamic graphs is challenging due to complicated cases brought by an evolving process: nodes can be added or removed, edges can appear or disappear, and communities can be merged or split. For instance, in social and email communication networks, people tend to frequently add and sometimes remove their connections based on daily business affairs; in IP-IP networks, agents periodically send messages from one address to any other address in the whole network, which makes the temporal model tough to capture the true evolving regularities. In short, the inherent difficulties stated above result in a lack of convincing dynamic graph models so far. A surge of graph research works emerged after the simplified graph convolutional neural network (GCN) was proposed by Kipf and Welling . However, the latest developments on GCN show that applying multiple graph convolutional layers would introduce oversmoothing problem, i.e., nodes in a graph become more and more similar thus being indistinguishable. The reason is that graph convolution is a special type of Laplacian smoothing. By stacking graph convolutional layers repeatedly, the feature space will shrink together and the final node embedding matrix will converge to a low-rank matrix, which results in nodes being almost identical and indistinguishable representation.\nIt was first introduced by Li, et al.  and further studied by , , .\nYet, we notice that very few works investigate this problem in dynamic graph models, although it harasses the development of dynamic graph research. In fact, in dynamic graph setting, stacking multiple graph convolutional layers to capture topological and temporal properties is an indispensable procedure according to present widely-used methods, but serious feature shrink or oversmoothing problems will also occur. Here we use the term “serious feature shrink” to express the same meaning as oversmoothing phenomenon, but at the same time to emphasize the cause of oversmoothing. In short, in this paper we first analyze the feature shrink and oversmoothing problems in the dynamic graph embedding. Then we propose a simple yet versatile method, that is L2 feature normalization, to tackle the problem. Finally, extensive experiments show that the performance can be remarkably improved by the proposal.\nTo summarize, the main contributions of our work are as follows: We analyze the feature shrink and oversmoothing problems in dynamic graph embedding, which is the first work to the best of our knowledge. An effective and versatile feature normalization method is proposed to tackle serious feature shrink or oversmoothing issue in dynamic graph embedding. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can not only improve the performance of various baselines obviously, but also can be served as a plug-in to boost the related models and unleash their true capabilities.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: problems, which has attracted much attention in machine learning communities.
