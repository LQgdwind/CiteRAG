Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: MTAD: Tools and Benchmarks for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerally, there are three categories of methods to select a proper threshold: (1) manual selection based on domain knowledge [ref]9. This requires labor-intensive inspection on the anomaly scores and sufficient domain knowledge. Hence it is not scalable if a large number of KPIs are monitored in a large-scale system.\n(2) automatic selection based on the distribution of anomaly scores. To be more specific, the principle of Extreme Value Theory (EVT)  is generally adopted[ref]7[ref]14. The object of EVT is to find the law of extreme values without making any assumption on data distribution. The only required parameter is a risk ratio to determine the number of false positive anomalies. EVT can set a threshold without any ground truth labels or experienced experts. However, it still requires the risk ratio to be manually set and may suggest a suboptimal threshold.\n(3) searching the optimal threshold within a range. This is also a widely used method to estimate the best performance of a model . Specifically, the thresholds are enumerated within a range with the aim to achieve the best accuracy in the labeled test data. Then, the best accuracy associated with the threshold is reported as the performance of the evaluated model.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: Generally, there are three categories of methods to select a proper threshold: (1) manual selection based on domain knowledge [ref]9.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
