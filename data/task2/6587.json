      "content": "Paper Title: A Deep Dive into Perturbations as Evaluation Technique for Time Series XAI\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur current experiment setup evolves around an in-depth analysis of the attributions of seven attribution techniques (Saliency, IntegratedGradients, DeepLift, Occlusion, GradientShap, DeepLiftShap, KernelShap) based on the implementations in Captum 111Captum is a Pytorch-based XAI module for Python: https://captum.ai/.\nWe incorporate 16 perturbation strategies, two based on Simic et al. , six based on Schlegel et al. [ref]19, and eight extensions we describe later.\nWe implemented nine single time point perturbations (zero, mean, inverse, dataset mean, dataset max, dataset min, OOD high, OOD low, random between min and max) and seven subsequence perturbations (zero, subsequence mean, dataset mean, inverse, OOD high, OOD low, random between min and max).\nThe subsequence length is fixed to ten percent of the length of the data. We focus on the UCR benchmark datasets [ref]5 and take three of the most extensive datasets (FordA, FordB, ElectricDevices) to investigate data characteristics.\nHowever, our approach can be applied to any time series classification dataset.\nThe FordA and FordB are sensor data with a length of 500 and provide an anomaly detection binary classification task.\nFordA has 3601 samples in the training set and 1320 in the test set.\nFordB has 3636 samples in the training set and 810 in the test set.\nThe ElectricDevices dataset is shorter, with only 96 time points.\nHowever, the dataset has 8926 training samples and 7711 test samples. We investigate two architectures of convolutional neural networks.\nThe first architecture tackles the FordA and FordB datasets.\nThe model consists of three 1D convolutional layers with a kernel size of three and increases the channels from one to 10 to 50 to 100.\nA max-pooling of three after the convolutional layer decreases the size again.\nA ReLu activation function activates the neuron.\nAfterward, a fully connected layer with 100 neurons and a ReLu function uses the feature maps from the convolutional layers to process the data further.\nAnd lastly, another fully connected layer with two neurons classifies the data with a softmax activation on top.\nWe train the model with a batch size of 120 and the Adam optimizer .\nThe second architecture is trained on the ElectricDevices data and introduces a residual from the input to the fully connected layers.\nThe original input gets downsampled using a 1D convolution with kernel size seven for the residual addition right before the fully connected layers. We train our models using the cross-entropy loss for multi-label classification on the datasets for 500 epochs.\nOur models achieve for FordA an accuracy of 0.99 for the training set and 0.89 for the test set, demonstrating overfitting to the training data.\nOur models achieve for FordB an accuracy of 0.99 for the training set and 0.70 for the test set, demonstrating overfitting to the training data.\nOur models achieve for ElectricDevices an accuracy of 0.94 for the training set and 0.64 for the test set, demonstrating overfitting to the training data.\nAs Ismail Fawaz et al.  showed, even our simple models are not too far from the state-of-the-art with other more sophisticated models.\nHowever, as we want to analyze our model, we look into the attributions of the training data, and thus our overfitting is a nice bonus to investigate spurious correlations and shortcuts [ref]6. Results –\nFirst, we start with the FordA dataset; next, we will present the FordB results, and lastly, the ElectricDevices dataset.\nFordA demonstrates interesting results regarding the attribution techniques and the perturbation strategies.\nThe best working strategies are setting the perturbed value to an out-of-distribution low  on a subsequence [ref]19 as you can see in Figure 6.\nEspecially, the saliency method  achieves the best result regarding the flip of predictions by flipping 2088 of 3601 samples, as also seen in Figure 2.\nHowever, the KernelSHAP method  comes close to the flip with just 39 less with 2049 flips.\nAlso, as seen in Figure 2 on the plot on the right, the perturbation strategy out-of-distribution low changes the class quite late with a lot of perturbed values.\nSuch an effect is unwanted in many cases as the model is, so to say, attacked by an adversarial attack outside of the distribution of the original data.\nIn some cases, we can use such a method to test the model on data shifts, as, for example, the attributions can shift heavily.\nHowever, for our focus on the model itself, such an adversarial attack is interesting but does not show internal decision makings for the dataset we are interested in. However, we also notice that the perturbation strategy heavily influences the best working method.\nIf we switch, for example, to a perturbation to zero, we see Occlusion  as the winner in Figure 6.\nSuch a change in the best working technique demonstrates that the perturbation analysis just with one strategy is not enough to compare attribution techniques.\nWe need multiple strategies to decide on one technique.\nHowever, we can also further take a deeper look into the attributions themselves.\nFocusing on the different skewness of the attributions and their distributions as seen in Figure 3, we can already see some trends toward techniques enabling an easier inspection of the method and how well the method performs for the perturbation analysis.\nEspecially, KernelSHAP in Figure 3 demonstrates a nice pattern with two nearly not overlapping distributions.\nSuch a nice distribution can help us to decide on one attribution technique. The model for the FordB dataset is a bit worse than for the FordA dataset, which leads, in most cases, to worse performance in the perturbation analysis .\nHowever, again the KernelSHAP and Saliency generate good working attributions for the change in the prediction for the perturbation to zero strategy.\nFor this dataset, KernelSHAP achieves to change of 3472 from 3636 samples as seen in Figure 7.\nEspecially interesting is the distribution of the skewness of the attributions.\nA more in detail analysis of these two peaks could lead to further insights into the model and the attributions, but such an analysis needs another visualization, e.g., projecting the attributions in a scatter plot.\nHowever, if we further inspect our corresponding model card in Figure 4, we can see that on the plot on the right, the change happens if a lot of values are removed from the original sample.\nSuch a result is also observable in the other perturbation cards for the other techniques.\nIn our study, we have identified a possible shortcut [ref]6 that our model has learned from the training data.\nWe speculate that the shortcut consists of a certain range or specific time points which need to be in a certain range of values to be classified as one class or the other class, and if we destroy this property, we change the prediction.\nSo, our model learns a static version or range for one class and classifies everything else into the other class.\nSuch a model does have more in common with an outlier detector than with a wanted classifier.\nThus, we identified a shortcut of the model to be able to improve the classification without using all available features [ref]6. The ElectricDevices dataset is harder for the model as we do not only have a binary classification problem but seven classes the model needs to separate.\nHowever, as before, not even the state-of-the-art performance is as accurate as possible , which leads to worse attributions and a more diverse perturbation analysis result.\nAgain, KernelSHAP performs best with a change of 8906 from 8926 samples with the values perturbed to the global max as seen in the perturbation card of Figure 5.\nHowever, also IntegratedGradients  works well, but only with another perturbation strategy, namely changing the perturbed value to the global mean of the dataset.\nThe dataset demonstrates quite nicely that the attribution techniques need different perturbation strategies to reveal the models’ internal decision-making.\nSome of the techniques focus on different features the model learned as the ranking of the best-performing attribution techniques based on the perturbation analysis changes from strategy to strategy for this dataset.\nAdditionally, when we delve into the labels of the changed and unchanged predictions, we notice that various attribution methods alter different labels in the perturbation.\nFor example, KernelSHAP seems to modify every class besides seven, whereas Saliency influences classes other than five and six.\nHowever, unlike the previous FordB dataset, we do not see an unwanted perturbation pattern in the amount of perturbed values visualization.\nSuch an effect presents that the attribution techniques are more suitable for the dataset and model than for the FordB model. Summary – As we have seen in our results (Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8), KernelSHAP performs quite well but takes a lot of time to calculate the attributions.\nDue to the sampling-based approach of KernelSHAP, the attributions are not deterministic and can vary from multiple computational runs.\nFurther, in many cases, Saliency (or Vanilla Gradient multiplied by the Input) works surprisingly well and is only sometimes improved by additional extensions on top, such as IntegratedGradients.\nThus, Saliency provides a promising variant for future experiments and techniques on top of it.\nSo, if the attribution (explanation) is time-critical, Saliency is a well-suited method.\nIf it is not time-critical, KernelSHAP provides the best-working attributions based on our experiments.\nOur collected data has even more insights and findings using the proposed perturbation analysis cards, which we look forward to analyzing and publishing with the code.\nThe published source code can be used as a framework to experiment on more datasets, and the perturbation analysis cards can be used to report the results.\nThe GitHub repository can be explored with more perturbation analysis cards and JSON data for the collected results of our experiments.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: implementations in Captum 111Captum is a Pytorch-based XAI module for Python: https://captum.ai/.\nWe incorporate 16 perturbation strategies, two based on Simic et al. , six based on Schlegel et al. [ref]19, and eight extensions we describe later.\nWe implemented nine single time point perturbations (zero, mean, inverse, dataset mean, dataset max, dataset min, OOD high, OOD low, random between\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
