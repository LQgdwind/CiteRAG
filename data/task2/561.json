      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Partition Embedding Interaction with Block Term Format for Knowledge Graph Completion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge graph embedding is an active research topic with many different methods. Based on the interaction mechanisms, they can be roughly divided into three main categories: (1) semantic matching models are based on similarity measures between the head and tail embedding vectors, (2) neural-network-based models are based on neural networks as universal approximators to compute the matching score, and (3) translation-based models are based on the geometric view of relation embeddings as translation vectors [ref]25 . RESCAL  is a general model that uses a bilinear map to model the interactions between the whole head and tail entity embedding vectors, with the relation embedding being used as the matching matrix, such that where 𝒉,𝒕∈ℝD𝒉𝒕superscriptℝ𝐷{\\bm{h}},{\\bm{t}}\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^{D} are the embedding vectors of hℎh and t𝑡t, respectively, and 𝑴r∈ℝD×Dsubscript𝑴𝑟superscriptℝ𝐷𝐷{\\bm{M}}_{r}\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^{D\\times D} is the relation embedding matrix of r𝑟r, with D𝐷D being the embedding size. However, the matrix 𝑴rsubscript𝑴𝑟{\\bm{M}}_{r} grows quadratically with embedding size, making the model expensive and prone to overfitting. TuckER  is a recent model extending RESCAL by using the Tucker format . However, it also models the interactions between the whole head, tail, and relation embedding vectors, making the core tensor in the Tucker format grow cubically with the embedding size, and also quickly becomes expensive. One approach to reducing computational cost is to design special interaction mechanisms that restrict the interactions between a few entries of the embeddings. For example, DistMult  is a simplification of RESCAL in which the relation embedding is a diagonal matrix, equivalently a vector 𝒓∈ℝD𝒓superscriptℝ𝐷{\\bm{r}}\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^{D}, such that 𝑴r=diag​(𝒓)subscript𝑴𝑟diag𝒓{\\bm{M}}_{r}={\\text{diag}}({\\bm{r}}). Its score function can also be written as a trilinear product which is an extension of the dot product to three vectors. DistMult is fast but restrictive and can only model symmetric relations. Most recent models focus on designing interaction mechanisms that aim to be richer than DistMult while achieving a low computational cost. For example, HolE 9 uses a circular correlation between the head and tail embedding vectors; ComplEx  uses complex-valued embedding vectors, 𝒉,𝒕,𝒓∈ℂD𝒉𝒕𝒓superscriptℂ𝐷{\\bm{h}},{\\bm{t}},{\\bm{r}}\\in{\\mathbb{C}}^{D}, and a special complex-valued vector trilinear product; and SimplE 2 5 represents each entity as two role-based embedding vectors and augments an inverse relation embedding vector. In our previous work [ref]25, we analyzed knowledge graph embedding methods from the perspective of a weighted sum of trilinear products to propose a more advanced Quaternion-based interaction mechanism and showed its promising results, which were later confirmed in a concurrent work . However, these interaction mechanisms are specially designed and fixed, potentially causing them to be suboptimal or difficult to extend. In this work, we propose a multi-partition embedding interaction framework to automatically learn the interaction mechanism and systematically control the trade-off between expressiveness and computational cost. Semantic matching models are related to tensor decomposition methods where the embedding model can employ a standard tensor representation format in tensor calculus to represent the data tensor, such as the CP tensor rank format 0, Tucker format , and block term format [ref]6. However, when applied to knowledge graph embedding, there are some differences, such as changing from continuous tensor to binary tensor, relaxation of constraints for data analysis, and different solvers 4. We analyze the connections to the related tensor decomposition methods in Section 3.2. These models aim to learn a neural network, to automatically model the interaction. Recent models using convolutional neural networks such as ConvE [ref]7 can achieve good results by sharing the convolution weights. However, they are restricted by the input format to the neural network [ref]7, and the operations are generally less expressive than direct interactions between the entries of the embedding vectors 9. We will empirically compare with them. The main advantages of these models are their simple and intuitive mechanism with the relation embeddings as the translation vectors . However, it has been shown that they have limitations in expressiveness 2. The recent model TorusE  improves the translation-based models by embedding in the compact torus space instead of real-valued vector space and achieves good results. We will also empirically compare with them.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: are based on neural networks as universal approximators to compute the matching score, and (3) translation-based models are based on the geometric view of relation embeddings as translation vectors [ref]25 .
