      "content": "Paper Title: Parameter-free Dynamic Graph Embedding for Link Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe use the next interaction prediction task to study the efficiency of JODIE, CoPE and FreeGEM.\nOther baselines, such as Time-LSTM , RRN , LatentCross  and CTDNE 7 show comparable efficiency with JODIE 4 and thus are omitted.\nJODIE and CoPE both run 50 epochs and choose the best performing model on validation set as the optimal model, but FreeGEM only requires multiple runs of offline/online SVD.\nAs shown in Table 6, FreeGEM is at least 36X faster than JODIE and at least 370X faster than CoPE, demonstrating its high efficiency. Besides, the running time of JODIE and CoPE increase significantly when the number of interactions increases, but the running time of FreeGEM only increases moderately which is more desirable for real-world applications. We use the future item recommendation task to study the effects of attribute-integrated SVD in cold-start setting.\nWe define the users who have not appeared in training set and verification set as cold-start users.\nFor ML-1M, there are 29 cold-start users.\nWhen attributes are not integrated, FreeGEM randomly recommends items to these users.\nFor 17 of the cold-start users whose Recall@10 is not 0, FreeGEM increases their average Recall@10 from 0.011 to 0.029, achieving a relative increase of 166%.\nFor 7 cold-start users whose Recall@10 is 0, FreeGEM increases their average Recall@10 to 0.100, which is very high compared with the average Recall@10 of all users in ML-1M. For the next interaction prediction task, we change the proportion of the training set to verify the robustness of FreeGEM in different levels of data sparsity.\nWe change the percentage of the training set from 10% to 80%, next 10% interactions after the training set as the validation set, and next 10% interactions after the validation set as the test set.\nThe results are shown in Figure 7, in which we can observe that the accuracy of FreeGEM is almost unaffected. This experiment demonstrate that that FreeGEM has strong robustness to the scale of training data.\nThe results of many baselines can also be found in JODIE 4. There could be recommendation bias concerns on under represented groups in specific applications and the existence of under represented groups usually comes from the biases during the data collection process.\nSome bias mitigation techniques are specially designed to solve this problem [ref]21.\nWe carry out further experiments on ML-100K.\nFirst, we group the users by gender and find that there are 670 male users (71.0%) and 273 female users (29.0%) in this dataset.\nMale users had 753,313 interaction records (74.4%), and female users had 246,298 interaction records (25.6%).\nThis shows that there is bias of gender distribution in this dataset.\nThen, we remove the attribute-integrated SVD module from our method and calculate the performance of our model on male and female users. We find that without using attributes, the Recall of male users is 0.124 and Recall of female users is 0.085. Male users are with 45.9% higher Recall than female users.\nFinally, we take the attribute-integrated SVD module back to see how the performance differs. We find that after using attributes, the Recall of male users increases to 0.156, Recall of female users increases to 0.127. Male users are with 22.8% higher Recall than female users.\nTo sum up, due to the bias of gender distribution in the ML-100K dataset, there is a clear bias in recommendation accuracy, i.e., male users are with 45.9% higher Recall than female users even without using user attributes in the model. However, to our surprise, the bias in the recommendation results becomes less significant after using user attributes in our model, i.e., male users are with only 22.8% higher Recall than female users when user attributes are incorporated.\nWe think the reason is that user attributes can help these under represented groups (female users) to improve their embedding quality.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: and the existence of under represented groups usually comes from the biases during the data collection process.\nSome bias mitigation techniques are specially designed to solve this problem [ref]21.\nWe carry out further experiments on ML-100K.\nFirst, we group the users by gender and find that there are 670 male users (71.0%) and 273 female users (29.0%) in this dataset.\nMale users had\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
