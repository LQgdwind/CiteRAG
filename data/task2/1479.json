      "content": "Paper Title: An Empirical Study on Deployment Faults of Deep Learning Based Mobile Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we summarize the related work to well position our study within the literature. Challenges that ML/DL poses for SE. Machine learning (ML) plays an increasingly significant role in various application domains and poses new challenges for software developers . To understand these challenges, Alshangiti et al.  analyzed the ML-related questions posted on SO and found that these questions are more difficult to answer than other questions. By further analysis, they demonstrated that model deployment is the most challenging across all the ML phases and that DL-related topics are the most common in the ML-related questions. In recent years, several studies have focused on the challenges in developing DL applications. For example, Han et al.  applied an automatic topic modelling technique to the SO questions related to three popular DL frameworks and derived the topics contained in these questions. Their results revealed common concerns that developers face when using DL frameworks, such as version problems and model training. Similarly, Zhang et al.  manually analyzed DL-related questions on SO and found that program crashes, model deployment, and implementation related questions are the most frequently asked. Recently, Chen et al.  investigated SO questions related to the deployment process of DL based applications. They derived the topics of the specific challenges that developers face when deploying DL models to server, mobile, and browser platforms. In contrast, instead of deriving the topics of challenges at a macro level, we aim to analyze symptoms and fix strategies of the deployment faults and provide actionable implications for fault detection and fix in mobile DL apps. In addition, we do not limit our analysis to just SO and also consider GitHub, which ensures comprehensiveness of this study. Empirical study on faults. There have been a number of empirical studies that focus on faults in different types of software systems. For example, Lu et al.  studied concurrency fault characteristics; Franco et al. [ref]29 explored real-world faults in numerical software; Gao et al.  conducted an empirical study on recovery faults in large-scale distributed systems.\nIn recent years, the rapid development of DL technologies has inspired some empirical studies on characterizing the faults in software applications that make use of DL frameworks. For example, Zhang et al. [ref]16 collected faults in TF programs from SO and GitHub. They categorized the symptoms and root causes of these faults through manual analysis. Following this work, Humbatova et al. [ref]18 and Islam et al.  extended their scope to the faults in programs written based on five popular DL frameworks to present more comprehensive results. Moreover, Islam et al.  analyzed the fix strategies of these faults in their follow-up work. Recently, Zhang et al.  studied the program faults of DL jobs running on a remote and shared server platform. Across the existing empirical studies, faults are often characterized based on multiple dimensions, including types, symptoms, root causes, fix strategies, etc. Compared to the prior studies, we apply these fault characterization methods to the faults in a different domain, i.e, mobile DL apps. Mobile DL apps. To make DL models accessible for users, developers need to deploy them to different platforms according to various application scenarios. A popular way is to deploy them on mobile devices. To facilitate this deployment process, researchers have proposed many optimization techniques (e.g., cloud offloading  and model compression ). In addition, researchers have built numerous DL based applications on mobile devices   . To bridge the knowledge gap between research and practice, Xu et al.  conducted an empirical study on large-scale Android apps collected from Google Play store and demonstrated the increasing popularity of DL in real-world mobile apps. Despite this popularity, the related techniques for deploying DL models to mobile devices are still not very mature. Recently, Guo et al.  investigated the performance gap when the trained DL models are migrated from PC to mobile devices with the help of TF Lite and Core ML. Their findings unveiled that the deployment still suffers from compatibility and reliability issues. Despite these efforts, the characteristics of deployment faults of mobile DL apps are still under-investigated and thus we aim to fill in this knowledge gap.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: on faults.
