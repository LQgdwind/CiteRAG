      "content": "Paper Title: A Robot Web for Distributed Many-Device Localisation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRobot Web uses the standard Gaussian factor graph representing the multi-robot localisation problem and is most closely related to the wealth of factor graph formulations and solvers in robotics, as well explained in the work of Dellaert and Kaess\n .\nMost methods for inference on factor graphs assume a centralised computer with access to the whole graph and focus on either efficient batch solution or incremental inference on graphs that are continually\nchanging.\nCentralised pose-graph optimisation algorithms suitable for multiple robots are well-explored in the literature    .\nMR-iSAM2 5 extends iSAM2  to build an incremental, centralised graph optimisation method for multiple robots.\nHowever, centralised methods require a base station, and are vulnerable to failure of this station, can require high communication bandwidth, create privacy concerns, and generally are not scalable 3. There have been many previous attempts at distributed multi-robot\nlocalisation and SLAM which uses local computation and\npeer-to-peer communication, but these are generally far more limited\nor specific than Robot Web; there is a useful recent survey by Halsted et al. .\nLeung et al. demonstrated that in a distributed network of robots, where the network is never fully connected, it is possible to achieve exact and centralised-equivalent estimates for localisation 6 and SLAM 5.\nMany of the existing results in multi-robot SLAM perform a version of gradient descent, albeit in a distributed fashion . A recent example is the work by Tian et al. 9 utilising block coordinate descent on the Riemannian manifold. The work by\nTian et al. has also been used in Kimera-Multi [ref]12 for pose-graph optimisation. Other papers formulate the graph optimisation problem as a linear minimum mean-squared-error problem and utilise stationary iterative methods [ref]24 such as the Jacobi method or the Gauss-Seidel method.\nFor example, the Jacobi method is used by Barooah and Hespanha  and Aragues et al.  to solve the linearised system equations iteratively. The Jacobi method is implemented in a distributed manner as described in .\nChoudhary et al.  demonstrates a distributed algorithm that scales to 50 robots.\nThe algorithm utilises a distributed Gauss-Seidel method for solving\nlinearised equations. This method has been used as a back-end optimisation module in other works such as DOOR-SLAM 2 and the recent work by Cieslewski et al. . In DDF-SAM, Cunningham et al.  presented an algorithm that distributes factor graph optimisation across multiple robots. It relies on Gaussian elimination, and requires robots to exchange Gaussian marginals about shared variables.\nLater in DDF-SAM2 , an extension is proposed that avoids information double-counting.\nSimilarly, the method presented in 4 involves robots exchanging condensed portions of their factor graphs in order to minimise communication.\nHowever, approaches which rely on Gaussian elimination become slow as the number of variables grows. A significant limitation of the distributed methods above is that they\nare synchronous, which means the robots must share their messages at\npredetermined times to ensure the shared information is up-to-date.\nIn contrast, asynchronous methods offer the flexibility that the\nrobots can operate at their own rate, without waiting for other\nrobots. Examples are the works by Todescato et al.\n1 and Tian et al.\n0. The first reference conducts the\noptimisation in Euclidean space, while the latter does the\noptimisation by computing the gradient descent on a Riemannian\nmanifold in a distributed manner. The authors of these papers also\ninvestigated the convergence of their distributed algorithms under\ncommunication delay. Robot Web is also asynchronous and distributed, but both much more\nsimple in formulation and more general than these methods. Significantly, Tian et al. 0 assume Gaussian noise are unable to handle outliers. Additionally, their formulation requires the sensor measurements to be a relative transformation.\nRobot Web supports general robot and sensor models and allows robust\nfactors, making it robust to large fractions of non-Gaussian outlier measurements. There has been some work on\nmulti-agent distributed localisation using variations of belief\npropagation in the sensor networks community.\nFor instance, Schiff et al. 6 performed multi-robot localisation using non-parametric belief propagation.\nWymeersch et al. 4 also used belief propagation to perform cooperative positioning in a distributed manner. They used the sum-product algorithm over a factor graph in an ultra-wideband network.\nThen Caceres et al.  extended 4 to a network composed of GNSS nodes.\nThese distributed positioning methods were later generalised by adding\nnonlinear measurement models and utilising Gaussian message passing\n7, 8; and\nin 2017, Wan et al. 2 proposed a distributed multi-robot SLAM algorithm, using belief propagation. In their method, a mixture of Gaussian and non-parametric models was used to handle nonlinear models. They also assumed measurements are affected by Gaussian noise and used synchronous\nmessage passing. Robot Web goes far beyond these methods to present a general framework for general robots and sensors.\nIt defines for the first time an open, asynchronous communication framework,\nand via the focus on GBP with robust factors enables highly robust and scalable performance.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: in a distributed fashion .
