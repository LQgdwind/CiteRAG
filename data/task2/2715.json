      "content": "Paper Title: G-CoS: GNN-Accelerator Co-Search Towards Both Better Accuracy and Efficiency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBaselines and datasets.\nFor evaluating G-CoS over SOTA GNN accelerators, we consider three baselines: HyGCN , AWB-GCN ,\nand Deepburning-GL , respectively. For evaluating G-CoS over SOTA GNAS, we consider three GNAS baselines: GraphNAS¬†[ref]10, Auto-GNN¬†, and AutoGraph¬†[ref]35. For benchmarking over SOTA handcrafted GNNs, we consider four baselines: GCN¬†, GAT¬†[ref]28, LGCN¬†, and GraphSAGE¬†, covering the most common GNN variants. Our experiments are conducted on four datasets: three citation graph datasets (Cora, CiteSeer and Pumbed) 4, and the Reddit post dataset ), respectively. GNN training setup.\nFor the GNN training, we follow the same dataset splits as   5.\nThe GNN supernet is trained using an Adam optimizer 6 with a learning rate of 0.001 for 1000 epochs, L2 regularization, and dropout. After the design space exploration is finished, the final derived models are trained with additional 400 epochs from scratch under the same configurations. Evolutionary search algorithm setup.\nFor the evolutionary search algorithm presented in Alg.¬†1, we use a set of generic configurations. Specifically, the fitness function is set as the weighted sum of (inverse)latency and task accuracy, such that latency and task accuracy contributes similarly to the fitness score. The mutation function is set to have a 50% chance, i.e., the selected GNN-accelerator design pairs have half of the randomly picked design attributes changed. The birth/dying rate (sùë†s) is set to 0.2. Hardware experiment setup.\nTo evaluate G-CoS‚Äôs generated accelerators, we adopt standard the FPGA evaluation and implementation flows in Vivado 2020.2¬†7. For the platform, we picked the Xilinx VCU128 FPGA board¬†0, which is equipped with 9024 DSPs, 42MB on-chip memory and 460GB/s HBM of-chip memory. For a fair comparison with other baselines, we limit the DSP consumption to be less than 4096 throughout the design. The generated GNN accelerators are clocked at 330MHz and adopt a 16-bit fixed point precision. For the accelerator template, we fix the number of sub-accelerators to 5 (unless otherwise specified). Note that the design principles of G-CoS introduced in Sec.¬†IV-C is platform agnostic, i.e., G-CoS can be flexibly extended to other platforms such as ASIC. During the design space exploration, to quickly go over numerous design options, we design and implement an in-house performance simulator to measure the execution time (i.e., the number of cycles).\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: G-CoS over SOTA GNN accelerators, we consider three baselines: HyGCN , AWB-GCN ,\nand Deepburning-GL , respectively.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
