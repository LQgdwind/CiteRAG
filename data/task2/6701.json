As a result, they overlook the importance of hard instances for training. In this paper, we intend to mine hard instances for improving WSI classification performance.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)  has been widely used in WSI analysis with its unique learning paradigm in recent years  8 6  [ref]31 .\nMIL is a weakly supervised learning framework that utilizes coarse-grained bag labels for training instead of fine-grained instance annotations.\nPrevious algorithms can be broadly\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
