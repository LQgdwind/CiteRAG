      "content": "Paper Title: Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning for Functional Split Control in Energy Harvesting Virtualized Small Cells\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDue to an exponential growth in mobile traffic demand , dense heterogeneous networks (HetNets) of multi-tier base stations (BSs) are being deployed as a means of enhancing capacity. In a HetNet, a large number of small BSs (SBSs) are employed to ensure coverage of hot-spots (e.g., entertainment areas, shopping malls, offices), while macro BSs (MBSs) are deployed for ensuring mobility and coverage. One of the issues that arise from the dense deployment of SBSs is the rapidly increasing electrical power consumption, which is playing a major part in the operational expenditures of mobile network operators (MNOs) . Hence, energy sustainable design and operation of mobile networks is identified as one of the key requirements of 5G and beyond mobile networks in order to ensure cost effectiveness and reduce the impact on the environment. To this end, new architectural paradigms, such as multi-access edge computing (MEC), are emerging, and renewable energy is gaining popularity as a means to decrease dependency on the power grid . MEC enables BSs to leverage cloud computing capabilities and offers computational resources on-demand basis . Relying on MEC, a flexible functional split between SBSs and a centralized baseband (BB) unit pool  has been proposed, where part of the BB processes are executed at the SBSs, while the remainder is offloaded to a central BB unit (BBU) pool. This solution can be enabled via network function virtualization (NFV), which permits network functions to be executed on general purpose hardware as virtual functions, and software defined networking (SDN) as a tool to manage these functions . As a result, network functions of SBSs can be virtualized and placed at different sites of the network. These SBSs, known as virtualized small cells (vSCs), enable higher flexibility in resource allocation and management. In parallel, energy harvesting (EH) technology is becoming widely applicable in mobile networks. EH allows both cost and environmental impact reduction ; however, it comes with its own unique challenges, mainly due to unreliable intermittent energy sources. Hence, in EH BSs, it is important to intelligently manage the harvested energy in order to avoid service degradation or interruption. Consequently, BSs with EH and MEC can open a new frontier in energy-aware processing and sharing of resources according to flexible functional splits. The EH powered vSCs can opportunistically use the processing capabilities of the MEC server, which can be co-located at the MBS site. In particular, we consider a two-tier scenario where EH powered vSCs can offload part of their BB processing to the central MBS site with a MEC server. This is particularly important since the power consumption due to BB processing has a huge share in the total power consumption breakdown of SBSs [ref]8.\nIn , we have proposed an offline solution for performance bounds of dynamic selection of functional split options for vSCs powered by EH. These results prove that dynamically adapting functional split options can provide significant grid energy savings as opposed to static configurations. However, the offline solution adopted relies on a-priori knowledge and does not scale up with the number of vSCs due to high computational complexity. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) allows learning an optimal/near optimal strategy through interactions with the environment while achieving a system wide goal, e.g., efficient utilization of the harvested energy, without requiring the model of the environment variables (e.g., user demands, EH). However, implementing RL algorithms in the presence of multiple vSCs operating in parallel is challenging. Centralized solutions experience long convergence and training phases due to prohibitively large state/action sets. A distributed approach may allow to reduce the complexity by dividing the problem among multiple agents. A common reward signal is employed so that the agents aim at optimizing the same system wide goal in a distributed manner.\nThis approach, also known as multi-agent RL (MRL) 0, scales better due to the distribution of the learning and decision making processes among the vSCs. However, in MRL, the impact of each individual agent’s actions on the reward is difficult to distinguish as the reward may depend on all the actions in a complex manner. Hence, MRL solutions should ensure some coordination among the agents (i.e., the vSCs) towards achieving system wide gains. MRL based algorithms for dynamic selection of functional split options in vSCs with EH capabilities are proposed in our previous work 1. In 1, distributed Q-learning (QL) and fuzzy Q-learning (FQL) are applied with coordination enabled via broadcasting the normalized traffic load of the MBS. In this work, we propose to achieve better coordination among the agents through the exchange of specific local state information. Hence, we increase the amount of shared knowledge in order to reduce conflicting behaviors, and, in turn, converge to stationary policies with higher system wide gains. The main challenge with this approach is the exponential increase in the state space dimension, which may slow down the learning process and even jeopardize its convergence. Tabular MRL methods (e.g., QL, FQL) work through mapping each state to a value; hence, each state-action pair needs to be properly explored. In problems with continuous state variables, as ours, this mapping is performed through quantization or fuzzy inference systems, and may result in large state spaces. For instance, the solutions proposed in 1 rely on broadcasting the MBS traffic load and have 444 state variables corresponding to energy, battery, local and MBS traffic load. Denoting the quantization level by z𝑧z, the state space of each agent in 1 has size z4superscript𝑧4z^{4}. If vSCs exchange battery state information for better coordination, the number of states will be multiplied by a factor of zNsuperscript𝑧𝑁z^{N}, where N𝑁N is the number of vSCs in the system. This implies an increment in the size of the state space from 625625625 in 1 to a range from 781257812578125 to 1.9073486×e131.9073486superscript𝑒131.9073486\\times e^{13} for z=5𝑧5z=5, in a scenario of 333 and 151515 vSCs, respectively. Tabular MRL methods cannot be applied on such a large state space. In deep RL (DRL), deep neural networks are used to approximate the Q-values of state-action pairs 2. DRL allows working with large state and action spaces through Q-value estimations without the need for large and impractical look-up tables. Accordingly, we propose a distributed DRL (DDRL) algorithm for the dynamic control of functional split options in vSCs with EH capabilities, where each vSC is modeled as a distinct DRL-based agent that takes decisions in coordination with other vSC agents. As opposed to tabular MRL, DDRL allows to coordinate the policies of the learning agents via local state information exchanges without facing practically infeasible state-action tables. The main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows:  We formulate a network wide sequential decision making problem in order to optimally leverage flexible functional split options at the vSCs with the goal of minimizing both the grid energy consumption and the amount of dropped traffic.  We propose a MRL solution, i.e., DDRL, that can handle the prohibitively large state space in an efficient manner. We analyze its complexity and convergence properties and describe its spatio-temporal behavior. We evaluate the performance (in terms of energy consumption and traffic drop rate) of the proposed DDRL solution and compare it against benchmark multi-agent FQL 1 as well as an offline performance bound . In addition, energy and cost savings of MRL-based controllers are estimated as compared to a system relying only on grid power. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the related literature. Section 3 presents the reference architecture considered in this work. Section 4 describes the the problem statement as well as power consumption, traffic and EH models. The proposed DDRL solution is explained in Section 5. Section 6 is dedicated to the simulation scenario, numerical results of simulations including the comparison with an FQL solution and cost analysis. Finally, we draw our conclusions in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: to the central MBS site with a MEC server.
