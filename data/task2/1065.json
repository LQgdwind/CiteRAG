      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Occupancy Function from Point Clouds for Surface Reconstruction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, applying deep learning techniques to point clouds has received significant attention. The early work is stimulated by the advances of 3D sensing and the availability of point cloud data. PointNet [ref]22 is a pioneer work in this field. By using symmetric functions (mean- and max-pooling) and point-wise non-linear mapping for points feature learning, PointNet is computationally efficient and permutation invariant. Deep-RBFNet [ref]23 is inspired by RBF-based surface representation  and Radial Basis Function Network . Before feeding into a PointNet-like architecture, they propose first encoding each input 3D point with RBF kernels scattered in the space whose center and width are trainable parameters.  use a Fisher Vector  to be the non-linear activation. Since the Fisher Vector is based on a Gaussian Mixture Model, it is analogous to RBF encoding [ref]23. A considerable amount of methods leverage the point-wise local or global structure, extracting nearest neighbors hierarchical graphs to construct efficient learning architectures. The structure could be extracted from either bottom-up      or top-down    direction. PointConv [ref]35 and PCNN  aim to extend the image discrete convolution operation to point clouds. The key is transforming discrete points back to continuous function over the 3D space. PointConv [ref]35 solve this problem with a kernel-based point density estimation, and the point cloud shape is approximated as its density field. PCNN  propose to do this transform by directly place a fixed-size RBF at each point and sum these RBFs over all of the points, producing a smooth field that contours the distribution of points. The method  will be briefly reviewed in section III-B when presenting our occupancy learning method.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: applying deep learning techniques to point clouds has received significant attention.
