      "content": "Paper Title: Valentine: Evaluating Matching Techniques for Dataset Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVirtually every non-trivial, data science task nowadays begins with data integration. At the core of data integration lies dataset discovery: the process of navigating numerous data sources in order to find relevant datasets as well as the relationships among those datasets. The bulk of work in dataset discovery, focuses on tabular data        [ref]8  0 1 since it constitutes the main form of datasets in the web and enterprises: web tables, spreadsheets, CSV files and database relations. Typically, a dataset discovery method receives a dataset as input and finds other datasets in a data repository which are related to it. The ultimate goal of dataset discovery is to augment a dataset with information previously unknown to the user. There are many flavors of dataset discovery: i)i) searching for tables that can be joined   , ii)ii) augmenting a given table with more data entries or extra attributes    , frequently for improving the accuracy of machine learning models 0 1, and iii)iii) finding similar tables to a given one using different similarity measures [ref]8 . The majority of these methods are based on a common, very critical component: schema matching, i.e., capturing relationships between elements of different schemata. In the case of tabular data, dataset discovery methods typically use schema matching techniques to automatically determine whether two columns (or even entire tables) are joinable or unionable. Since dataset discovery methods exploit relatedness information about a given set of datasets, the underlying matching technique of any data discovery method greatly affects its performance. At the moment of writing, dataset discovery methods typically implement their own matcher, by combining or customizing existing methods. However, the majority of discovery works do not take advantage of the abundance of schema matching methods in the literature 2 3. This happens for good reasons: the vast majority of the techniques are not open-source or available for use, and oftentimes the on-paper description of algorithms can be vague. Worse, most methods require setting a vast number of parameters, making any reproducibility effort a tough or impossible task. Most importantly, even when a few schema matching methods are publicly available, employing them into a dataset discovery pipeline becomes a daunting task: there exists no proper comparison of the state-of-the-art schema matching techniques in the literature – an open problem which was stated almost two decades ago 2. In this paper, we present the first work towards evaluating schema matching algorithms on tabular data, for the specific needs of dataset discovery. Traditionally, schema matching algorithms have been evaluated for 1-1 matches: for each column in the source schema, algorithms aim at matching exactly one column in the target schema. This is limiting for dataset discovery use cases where users typically navigate ranked lists of results. We argue that providing ranked lists instead of 1-1 matches, both challenges the traditional matching evaluation metrics (precision and recall), and requires changes to existing algorithms. This work aims to facilitate the development of novel dataset discovery methods by i)i) automating the schema matching component, ii)ii) by adapting existing algorithms and iii)iii) by proposing novel evaluation metrics with Valentine: a unified, open-source schema matching experiment suite for dataset discovery. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: we survey the dataset discovery literature and distill four relatedness scenarios that we strictly define: two joinability and two unionability scenarios; we extend existing methods to fabricate dataset pairs for those relatedness scenarios in a principled manner; we implement and integrate six schema matching algorithms 4 5 6 7 8 9 and our own baseline method, and adapt them to the needs of dataset discovery; we develop a unified and extensible, open-source111https://github.com/delftdata/valentine experimentation suite that can be used as a drop in replacement of the schema matching component in current and future dataset discovery methods; we present – to the best of our knowledge – the most comprehensive effectiveness and efficiency evaluation of schema matching algorithms for tabular data to date, with ∼similar-to\\sim75K experiments (553 dataset pairs ×\\times 135 configurations over multiple schema matching methods). In the rest of the paper we present how schema matching is being used in dataset discovery methods, and propose a new evaluation metric (Section II). We then define a taxonomy with the schema matching scenarios for dataset discovery (Section III) and how we constructed datasets and ground truth for those cases (Sections IV and V). We then present schema matching methods and the changes required for dataset discovery (Section VI) and finally present experimental results, lessons learned, and open problems (Sections VII, VIII, IX).\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: of navigating numerous data sources in order to find relevant datasets as well as the relationships among those datasets.
