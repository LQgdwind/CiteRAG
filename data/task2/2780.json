      "content": "Paper Title: Inexact bilevel stochastic gradient methods for constrained and unconstrained lower-level problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe are going to use instances of Continual Learning (CL) as practical stochastic bilevel problems to test the performance of BSG-N-FD, BSG-1, StocBiO, and DARTS. CL was briefly described in Section 1, and is now introduced in more detail. Let us denote a whole features/labels dataset by 𝒟={(uj,vj),j∈{1,…,N}}𝒟subscriptu𝑗subscriptv𝑗𝑗1…𝑁{\\cal D}=\\{(\\textbf{u}_{j},\\textbf{v}_{j}),\\,j\\in\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\}, consisting of N𝑁N pairs of a feature vector ujsubscriptu𝑗\\textbf{u}_{j} and the corresponding true label vjsubscriptv𝑗\\textbf{v}_{j}. For any data point j𝑗j, the classification is deemed correct if the right label is predicted. To evaluate the loss incurred when using the prediction function ϕ​(u;θ)italic-ϕu𝜃\\phi(\\textbf{u};\\theta), which in this section is supposed to be a DNN, we use a loss function ℓ​(ϕ​(u;θ),v)ℓitalic-ϕu𝜃v\\ell(\\phi(\\textbf{u};\\theta),\\textbf{v}). The goal of CL is to minimize the prediction error over a sequence of tasks that become available one at a time. Among the many different formulations proposed for CL, hierarchical objectives have been used in  [ref]56. In this section, we present an incremental setting where each task is available as a subset of samples, similar to the formulation in . Given t∈{1,…,T}𝑡1…𝑇t\\in\\{1,\\ldots,T\\}, let 𝒟tsubscript𝒟𝑡{\\cal D}_{t} be the set of samples for a new task Ttsubscript𝑇𝑡T_{t}, which can be split into a training set Dtrtsubscriptsuperscript𝐷𝑡trD^{t}_{\\operatorname{tr}} and a validation set Dvtsubscriptsuperscript𝐷𝑡vD^{t}_{\\operatorname{v}}. Moreover, let us split the parameters θtsubscript𝜃𝑡\\theta_{t} of the model ϕ​(u;θt)italic-ϕusubscript𝜃𝑡\\phi(\\textbf{u};\\theta_{t}) into two subvectors, λtsubscript𝜆𝑡\\lambda_{t} and δtsubscript𝛿𝑡\\delta_{t}, whose roles are to give us flexibility in minimizing the classification error on the training and validation data along the sequence of tasks. According to , when using a neural network as a prediction function, a reasonable strategy is to choose λtsubscript𝜆𝑡\\lambda_{t} and δtsubscript𝛿𝑡\\delta_{t} as the vectors of weights in the hidden and output layers, respectively. To solve the overall CL problem, one starts from the first task T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} and, after an arbitrary number of iterations or amount of time, we include in the problem the second task T2subscript𝑇2T_{2}. One reiterates this procedure until all the tasks have been added to the problem. Let us now suppose that one has already added t𝑡t tasks. At this stage, the goal of the UL and LL problems is to determine the values of λtsubscript𝜆𝑡\\lambda_{t} and δtsubscript𝛿𝑡\\delta_{t} that ensure a small classification error on Ttsubscript𝑇𝑡T_{t} and on all the previous tasks Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i}, with i<t𝑖𝑡i<t. To this end, the UL problem determines (λt,δt)subscript𝜆𝑡subscript𝛿𝑡(\\lambda_{t},\\delta_{t}) by minimizing the prediction error on Dvalt=∪i≤tDvisubscriptsuperscript𝐷𝑡valsubscript𝑖𝑡subscriptsuperscript𝐷𝑖vD^{t}_{\\operatorname{val}}=\\cup_{i\\leq t}D^{i}_{\\operatorname{v}}, which is composed of the data sampled from the validation sets associated with the current and previous tasks. Similarly, the LL problem determines δtsubscript𝛿𝑡\\delta_{t} by minimizing the error on Dtraint=∪i≤tDtrisubscriptsuperscript𝐷𝑡trainsubscript𝑖𝑡subscriptsuperscript𝐷𝑖trD^{t}_{\\operatorname{train}}=\\cup_{i\\leq t}D^{i}_{\\operatorname{tr}}.\nNote that at each stage one solves a different problem since the objective functions of the UL and LL change as new tasks are included in the problem. The formulation of the problem solved at stage t𝑡t, with t∈{1,…,T}𝑡1…𝑇t\\in\\{1,\\ldots,T\\}, can be written as follows: We point out that the large dimension of the datasets usually considered in ML may prevent the use of the whole sets Dtrisubscriptsuperscript𝐷𝑖trD^{i}_{\\operatorname{tr}} and Dvisubscriptsuperscript𝐷𝑖vD^{i}_{\\operatorname{v}} from previous tasks i𝑖i’s, where i<t𝑖𝑡i<t and t𝑡t is the current task. In such cases, it may be necessary to resort to subsets D¯tri⊂Dtrisubscriptsuperscript¯𝐷𝑖trsubscriptsuperscript𝐷𝑖tr\\bar{D}^{i}_{\\operatorname{tr}}\\subset D^{i}_{\\operatorname{tr}} and D¯vi⊂Dvisubscriptsuperscript¯𝐷𝑖vsubscriptsuperscript𝐷𝑖v\\bar{D}^{i}_{\\operatorname{v}}\\subset D^{i}_{\\operatorname{v}}, which we will not do in this paper given that our interest focuses on the solution of stochastic BLPs. Once a new task is included in the problem, the classification accuracy of the DNN on the previous tasks tends to deteriorate, thus resulting in the well-studied phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting , which can be alleviated by adding LL inequality constraints to the lower level of problem (5.14).\nSuch inequality constraints are inspired by  and ensure that, at each stage, the current model outperforms the old model on all the previous tasks, thus preventing the deterioration of the classification accuracy when learning new tasks. In particular, for all i<t𝑖𝑡i<t and t≥2𝑡2t\\geq 2, we have We point out that similar constraints were also used in the bilevel formulation proposed in [ref]56, where the violation of the constraints is penalized. Note that, in general, the constraints in (5.15) may be nonconvex when using a neural network as the prediction function ϕ​(u;λt,δt)italic-ϕusubscript𝜆𝑡subscript𝛿𝑡\\phi(\\textbf{u};\\lambda_{t},\\delta_{t}).\nHowever, our theory does encompass nonconvexity of the LL constraints as long as the LL SOSC is satisfied (see Assumption 3.5).\n\nReference markers found: [56]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]56: CL is to minimize the prediction error over a sequence of tasks that become available one at a time.
