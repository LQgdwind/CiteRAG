      "content": "Paper Title: FheFL: Fully Homomorphic Encryption Friendly Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning with Byzantine Users\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn our experiments, we consider label-flipping attacks where malicious users poison data by changing the labels of particular classes and training the local model. The intention of the malicious participant is to misclassify targeted labels during the prediction stage. In our experiments, we compared the proposed FheFL algorithm‚Äôs accuracy against FedAvg [ref]33, Trimmed Mean [ref]34, Median [ref]34 and KRUM . Table II compares the accuracy of the FheFL against all other methods without any attackers. .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 Users\n100 Users\n\n\n\nAlgorithm\nAccuracy\nLoss\nAccuracy\nLoss\n\nFedAvg [ref]33\n98.32%\n0.0344\n98.68%\n0.067\n\nTrimmed mean [ref]34\n94.57%\n0.0705\n96.48%\n0.06367\n\nMedian [ref]34\n94.89%\n0.0691\n96.88%\n0.06867\n\nKRUM \n95.10%\n0.2332\n96.34%\n0.2156\n\nFheFL (This work)\n98.27%\n0.0377\n98.78%\n0.0379\n\n The results show that when the number of users increases, model accuracy is generally going up. Moreover, the proposed non-poisoning rate-based weighted aggregation scheme outperforms Trimmed Mean [ref]34, Mean Median [ref]34 and KRUM  approaches. We also observed that our aggregation technique is slightly better than the FedAvg algorithm when the number of users is equivalent to 100100100. This can be attributed to the non-poisoning rate which smoothes out the gradients which are far away from the intended direction. .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttackers\n= 5%\n= 15%\n= 20%\n\nAlgorithm\nAccuracy\nAASS\nAccuracy\nAASS\nAccuracy\nAASS\n\nFedAvg [ref]33\n94.55%\n0.55%\n92.56%\n10.05%\n84.54%\n89.21%\n\nTrimmed mean [ref]34\n95.31%\n0.34%\n94.64%\n3.23%\n87.21%\n60.76%\n\nMedian [ref]34\n96.43%\n0.37%\n95.04%\n2.93%\n88.72%\n61.69%\n\nKRUM \n94.63%\n0.42%\n93.09%\n7.63%\n86.93%\n74.32%\n\nFheFL (This work)\n98.24%\n0.13%\n97.76%\n0.43%\n97.32%\n0.78%\n\n Then we tested the robustness of the algorithms in the presence of malicious users. We turned 20%percent2020\\% of the users into malicious who perform a label-flipping attack. The malicious users train handwritten images of 777s as ones and 111s as seven. The other classes are not changed. In each epoch, the server expected to select 222 malicious users and 888 benign users randomly. As shown in Figure 2, the proposed aggregation algorithm has converged during the 404040th epoch and became steady during the rest of the epochs and was able to outperform all other popular schemes. Here, the results under different proportions of malicious users are illustrated in Table III. The proposed algorithm outperforms all the popular aggregation schemes in terms of overall accuracy and successfully mitigating the data poisoning attacks. When percentage of the attackers is increasing, the accuracy and detection rate are going down in all the algorithms which is expected. We also compared the loss of accuracy of the proposed FheFL algorithm due to encrypted domain operations. We used two sets of security parameters i.e., N=16384ùëÅ16384N=16384 and N=8192ùëÅ8192N=8192. As shown in Figure 3, there is a loss in accuracy compared to the plain domain accuracy (see Figure 2 for plain domain accuracy). When we use a larger ring with N=16384ùëÅ16384N=16384 and 60‚àílimit-from6060-bit precision, the loss of accuracy is less than 3%percent33\\% for one-hundred users. When we reduce the ring dimension and precision to N=8192ùëÅ8192N=8192 and 25‚àílimit-from2525-precision respectively, the loss of accuracy doubles. While a smaller ring increases the efficiency as described in the next subsection, it leads to a loss in accuracy. A similar trend was observed in [ref]16 and . In [ref]16, a plain neural network was used and the loss in accuracy between the plain domain and encrypted domain approach is around 4%percent44\\%. A simple logistic regression was used in  where the difference in accuracy between the plain domain and the encrypted domain is around 3.5%percent3.53.5\\%.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: The intention of the malicious participant is to misclassify targeted labels during the prediction stage.
