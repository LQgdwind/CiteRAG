      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring the Combination of Contextual Word Embeddings and Knowledge Graph Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn practice, extrinsic evaluation of embedding models involves a task or set of tasks, the choice of which should be guided by the properties of the embedding model that we want to evaluate.\nSuch a task is usually defined by: the goal of the task (ex: detecting similar words, predicting relations, etc.); a machine learning model separate from the embedding models, that will use the embeddings as features to solve the task;\nas mentioned by , such a model is typically supervised; data on which the embedding models will be applied to obtain the embeddings and perform the task; a way to evaluate the performance on the task. A wide variety of downstream tasks have been designed over the years to evaluate embedding models, the main ones described in  and  respectively for word and KB embedding models. Most methods used for word embedding models are applicable as-is on contextual embeddings, though with slightly different data ([ref]32). While the tasks are quite similar between textual (word or context) and KB embedding model evaluations, the kind of data used as input for the embedding model is quite different.\nFor textual embeddings the data is text, while for KB embeddings the data is either triples or KG node identifiers. We will describe the main families of tasks used and how they are designed for both textual and KB embeddings. For an overview of the datasets available for each task, see the corresponding sections in either  or . is a type of task focused on identifying the relationship between two elements.\nWhile very used for KB embeddings, [ref]22 presents a contextual embedding version. To perform this task with KB embeddings, the data used is a triple <subject, _, object> in which the relation has been removed and serves as the target of the prediction task.\nFor textual embeddings, we have something of a textual adaptation of the KB version of the task, with the object and subject of the relation lexicalized – put into a textual form, either a word or a word in context.\nThere is a variant of textual relation prediction called relation extraction, in which the relation to predict is described in the text (ex: “Barrack Obama was elected president of the USA”, the relation of being the president of is present in the text) making the task more of an extraction of the relation from the text than a simple prediction of the relation between entities. While usually what is predicted is the relation between the elements, the relation can be provided with the source or the target of the relation, the remaining one being the prediction target. In that case, it can be called entity prediction.\nRelation and entity prediction are more generally called triple completion as they amount to filling the missing part of a triple. is the task of predicting the type of an entity represented by a KG node or a word.\nEntity typing is typically used for KB embeddings as type information is usually included in the knowledge base, but [ref]22 presents a contextual embeddings version.\nThis family of tasks can be interpreted as a measure of whether the model learns to categorize the elements by their nature. With KB embeddings we embed a single entity and try to determine its type.\nIt is usually quite easy to acquire the gold labels for this task with KG, as typically every node is attributed a class.\nWith textual embeddings we take a word (and its context if necessary) and predict its type in a similar manner.\nIt is however a bit less straightforward to determine the type of the entity in this case than with KBs. is the task of checking if two words or KG nodes represent the same entity.\nThis kind of task is supposed to evaluate the ability to model semantic similarity in a rather straightforward manner.\nFor textual embeddings in particular, the task can be used to evaluate how synonymy is encoded in the model. For KB embeddings we embed pairs KG nodes known to represent or not the same object, while in the case of word embeddings, we embed pairs of words. There is also variant of the task called word in context (WiC) [ref]22 which corresponds to the contextual embedding version of the task, for which we determine if words used in their respective contexts are used with the same sense. is a task for which we determine if a chunk of text logically entails another.\nA typical example would be Mary gave John a book that implies that Mary gave a book. This task should evaluate the ability of the model to encode logical relations, and fits more contextual embeddings and so-called sentence embeddings than word embeddings. is a task for which we determine if a triple describes a true information or not.\nReusing the example from , the triple <Alfred Hitchcock, Director Of, Psycho> is true while <James Cameron, Director Of, Psycho> is false. Those generic task families are the most used because they have a wide variety of datasets available and are quite simple to set up.\nAlso, while those relatively simple tasks do not evaluate performance for a target application, they can be used to estimate the performance when we rely on properties of the language similar to those evaluated by the task.\nSuch an approach was used in [ref]22, where the authors use relation extraction, word in context and entity typing to evaluate their knowledge enhanced contextual embedding.\nWhile their method is close to what we propose, they evaluate their model exclusively on textual data. Tasks which are more closely related to real world use cases are also used, for example triple extraction from text,\nquestion answering, recommender systems, Named Entity Recognition (NER) or semantic role labelling.\nThose tasks are harder to analyse to linguistically interpret the performance of the model, but they provide a better insight on how the embedding model impacts performance for a target application.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: ones described in  and  respectively for word and KB embedding models. Most methods used for word embedding models are applicable as-is on contextual embeddings, though with slightly different data ([ref]32). While the tasks are quite similar between textual (word or context) and KB embedding model evaluations, the kind of data used as input for the embedding model is quite different.\nFor\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
