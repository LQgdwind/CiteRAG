      "content": "Paper Title: DIVINE: Diverse Influential Training Points for Data Visualization and Model Refinement\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBreiman  noted that there can exist multiple hypotheses that fit a training dataset equally well, leading to different stories about the relationship between the input features and output response. There are a few recent works that relate to our formulation.\nFirstly, Fisher et al.  defines the empirical ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-Rashomon set is defined as:\nSϵ={θ∈Θ:R^​(θ)≤R^​(θ^)+ϵ}subscript𝑆italic-ϵconditional-set𝜃Θ^𝑅𝜃^𝑅^𝜃italic-ϵS_{\\epsilon}=\\{\\theta\\in\\Theta:\\hat{R}(\\theta)\\leq\\hat{R}(\\hat{\\theta})+\\epsilon\\}.\nSϵsubscript𝑆italic-ϵS_{\\epsilon} can be seen as the set of all classifiers in ΘΘ\\Theta that have an average loss no more than ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon greater than the average loss of θ^^𝜃\\hat{\\theta}. Marx et al. [ref]42 study predictive multiplicity within the Rashomon set (calling it the ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-level set): they define a metric called ambiguity, which is the proportion of training data points whose θ′∈Sϵsuperscript𝜃′subscript𝑆italic-ϵ\\theta^{\\prime}\\in S_{\\epsilon}. To calculate ambiguity, they find θ′superscript𝜃′\\theta^{\\prime} via a mixed integer program (MIP) for each z𝑧z.\nWhile these works study how to deal with varying predictions in Sϵsubscript𝑆italic-ϵS_{\\epsilon}, we essentially solve a dual problem where we want to find the minimum ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon such that the empirical Sϵsubscript𝑆italic-ϵS_{\\epsilon} contains at least one model with different predictions for z𝑧z. More concretely, we want to find ϵi>0subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑖0\\epsilon_{i}>0, where\nϵi=min​ϵ​s.t.​∃θ∈Sϵ:ρ​(θ,zi)≠ρ​(θ^,zi):subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑖minitalic-ϵs.t.𝜃subscript𝑆italic-ϵ𝜌𝜃subscript𝑧𝑖𝜌^𝜃subscript𝑧𝑖\\epsilon_{i}=\\text{min}\\;\\epsilon\\;\\;\\textrm{s.t.}\\;\\exists\\theta\\in S_{\\epsilon}:\\rho(\\theta,z_{i})\\neq\\rho(\\hat{\\theta},z_{i}).\nLetham et al.  looks across Sϵsubscript𝑆italic-ϵS_{\\epsilon} to identify classifiers which have maximally different predictions (similar to discrepancy defined in [ref]42).\nWe do something similar but different: we ask how much does your average loss need to suffer in order to change the prediction of a test point. Wiener and El-Yaniv [ref]50 used Czsubscript𝐶𝑧C_{z} to create a selection function for rejection option classification: they call Czsubscript𝐶𝑧C_{z} the disbelief index. They consider Specifically, if the Cz>Δsubscript𝐶𝑧ΔC_{z}>\\Delta, then they proceed to predict on z𝑧z using θ^^𝜃\\hat{\\theta}. If Cz≤Δsubscript𝐶𝑧ΔC_{z}\\leq\\Delta, then they abstain from providing a prediction for z𝑧z. They choose Δ=σ​(n,δ/4,d)=4​2​d​(ln⁡2​n​ed)+ln⁡2δnΔ𝜎𝑛𝛿4𝑑42𝑑2𝑛𝑒𝑑2𝛿𝑛\\Delta=\\sigma(n,\\delta/4,d)=4\\sqrt{\\frac{2d\\left(\\ln\\frac{2ne}{d}\\right)+\\ln\\frac{2}{\\delta}}{n}}, where σ𝜎\\sigma is the slack of a uniform deviation bound in terms of the training set size n𝑛n, a confidence parameter δ𝛿\\delta, and the VC-dimension d𝑑d of ΘΘ\\Theta.\nUsing a weighted SVM, they find θ′superscript𝜃′\\theta^{\\prime} by adding z′=(z,−ρ​(θ^,z))superscript𝑧′𝑧𝜌^𝜃𝑧z^{\\prime}=(z,-\\rho(\\hat{\\theta},z)) to the training data and then upweight the penalty of misclassifying z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} (penalty is set to ten times the weight of all other training points combined). Since Czsubscript𝐶𝑧C_{z} is a noisy statistic and depends heavily on the n𝑛n samples chosen from 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}, they use bootstrap sampling and then take the median of all measurements as the final value of the disbelief index, which is closely related to the disagreement coefficient from Hanneke [ref]22. Earlier, Dasgupta et al.  used an ERM oracle with an example-based constraint in the context of active learning. In a setup similar to Wiener and El-Yaniv [ref]50 and ours, Dasgupta et al.  decides to request a label for z𝑧z if Cz≤Δsubscript𝐶𝑧ΔC_{z}\\leq\\Delta. They also select ΔΔ\\Delta to be in terms of the empirical errors of both classifiers, n𝑛n, δ𝛿\\delta, and d𝑑d.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: can be seen as the set of all classifiers in ΘΘ\\Theta that have an average loss no more than ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon greater than the average loss of θ^^𝜃\\hat{\\theta}. Marx et al.
