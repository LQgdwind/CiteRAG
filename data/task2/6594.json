This theorem is similar to, but goes beyond, Theorem E.1 in [ref]23. We show equivalence up to ∼similar-to\\sim rather than ∼Psubscriptsimilar-to𝑃\\sim_{P}, given that the latent variables are constrained with respect to some causal graph (with all conditional independencies). The proof is detailed in the appendix. The main outline of this proof includes showing that, under the constrain that the latent distribution respects the same causal graph 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}}, the block permutation matrix (in Theorem E.1 of [ref]23) can be reduced to a diagonal matrix. Similar to [ref]23 we approximate the posterior distribution using GMMs. (Identifiability of 𝐳𝐳{\\mathbf{z}} under causal ordering) In the case when only causal ordering is known, the strong identifiability in theorem 1 reduces to block diagonal identifiability (∼Dsubscriptsimilar-to𝐷\\sim_{D}). Given the fact that constraining latent variables based on the complete causal graph may not be feasible, the lemma relaxes this constraint to enforce causal ordering, which guarantees ∼Dsubscriptsimilar-to𝐷\\sim_{D} identifiability. In section 4, we show how to achieve causal ordering in the latent space. (Model Identifiability)\nLet 𝐟o,𝐟~osubscript𝐟𝑜subscript~𝐟𝑜{\\mathbf{f}}_{o},\\tilde{{\\mathbf{f}}}_{o}, satisfy the injectivity assumption with y∼ℙ​(𝐳),y′∼ℙ~​(𝐳)formulae-sequencesimilar-to𝑦ℙ𝐳similar-tosuperscript𝑦′~ℙ𝐳y\\sim\\mathbb{P}({\\mathbf{z}}),y^{\\prime}\\sim\\tilde{\\mathbb{P}}({\\mathbf{z}}), where ℙ,ℙ~ℙ~ℙ\\mathbb{P},\\tilde{\\mathbb{P}} follow the same causal graph 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}} and let 𝒟⊆ℝo𝒟superscriptℝ𝑜\\mathcal{D}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^{o}, where o=|𝒪|𝑜𝒪o=|\\mathcal{O}| such that 𝐟o,𝐟~osubscript𝐟𝑜subscript~𝐟𝑜{\\mathbf{f}}_{o},\\tilde{{\\mathbf{f}}}_{o} are injective on to 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}.\nSuppose 𝐟o​(y)subscript𝐟𝑜𝑦{\\mathbf{f}}_{o}(y) and 𝐟~o​(y′)subscript~𝐟𝑜superscript𝑦′\\tilde{{\\mathbf{f}}}_{o}(y^{\\prime}) are equally distributed, then, 𝐟o​(𝐳)=𝐟~o​(𝐳)subscript𝐟𝑜𝐳subscript~𝐟𝑜𝐳{\\mathbf{f}}_{o}({\\mathbf{z}})=\\tilde{{\\mathbf{f}}}_{o}({\\mathbf{z}}). This theorem is similar to, but goes beyond Theorem D.4 in [ref]23. We show equivalence up to ∼similar-to\\sim rather than ∼Asubscriptsimilar-to𝐴\\sim_{A}, given that the latent variables are constrained with respect to some causal graph (with all conditional independencies). We detail the proof in the appendix. Similar to the proof of Theorem 1, we use GMMs to model our posterior distribution. The main component of the proof is to reduce affine transformation in Theorem D.4 [ref]23 to an identity transformation. (Model identifiability under causal ordering) In the case when latent variables follow a particular causal ordering τ𝜏\\tau rather than the entire causal graph 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}}, there exists a block diagonal transformation 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} such that 𝐟o​(𝐳)=(𝐟~o∘𝐃)​(𝐳)subscript𝐟𝑜𝐳subscript~𝐟𝑜𝐃𝐳{\\mathbf{f}}_{o}({\\mathbf{z}})=(\\tilde{{\\mathbf{f}}}_{o}\\circ\\mathbf{D})({\\mathbf{z}}).\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: GMMs with a sufficient amount of components can model any densities in the limiting case , which in turn breaks the symmetry in the latent space behaving like auxiliary information in iVAE  [ref]23.\nIn light of this, we model our latent distribution\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
