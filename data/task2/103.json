      "content": "Paper Title: SBERT-WK: A Sentence Embedding Method by Dissecting BERT-based Word Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor supervised tasks, we compare SBERT-WK with other sentence embedding\nmethods in the following eight downstream tasks. MR: Binary sentiment prediction on movie reviews . CR: Binary sentiment prediction on customer product reviews . SUBJ: Binary subjectivity prediction on movie reviews and plot summaries . MPQA: Phrase-level opinion polarity classification . SST2: Stanford Sentiment Treebank with binary labels . TREC: Question type classification with 6 classes . MRPC: Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus for paraphrase prediction [ref]45. SICK-E: Natural language inference dataset [ref]36. More details on these datasets can be found in . The design of our sentence embedding model targets at the transfer\ncapability to downstream tasks. Typically, one can tailor a pre-trained\nlanguage model to downstream tasks through tasks-specific fine-tuning.\nIt was shown in previous work  [ref]23, that subspace analysis methods are more\npowerful in semantic similarity tasks. However, we would like to show\nthat sentence embedding can provide an efficient way for downstream\ntasks as well. In particular, we demonstrate that SBERT-WK does not hurt\nthe performance of pre-trained language models. Actually, it can even\nperform better than the original model in downstream tasks under both BERT and RoBERTa backbone settings. For SBERT-WK, we use the same setting as the one in semantic similarity\ntasks. For downstream tasks, we adopt a multi-layer-perception (MLP)\nmodel that contains one hidden layer of 50 neurons. The batch size is\nset to 64 and the Adam optimizer is adopted in the training. All\nexperiments are trained with 4 epochs. For MR, CR, SUBJ, MPQA and MRPC,\nwe use the nested 10-fold cross validation. For SST2, we use the\nstandard validation. For TREC and SICK-E, we use the cross validation. The experimental results on the eight supervised downstream tasks are given\nin Table IV. Although it is desired to\nfine-tune deep models for downstream tasks, we see that SBERT-WK still\nachieves good performance without any fine-turning. As compared with the\nother 10 benchmarking methods, SBERT-WK has the best performance in 5\nout of the 8 tasks. For the remaining 3 tasks, it still ranks among the\ntop three. Unlike STS tasks, SRoBERTa-WK-base achieves the best\naveraged performance (88.8%) on supervised tasks. For TREC,\nSBERT-WK is inferior to the two best models, USE and BERT [CLS], by\n0.6%. For comparison, the baseline SBERT is much worse than USE, and\nSBERT-WK-base outperforms SBERT-base by 6.8%. USE is particularly suitable TREC\nsince it is pre-trained on question answering data, which is highly\nrelated to the question type classification task. In contrast, SBERT-WK\nis not trained or fine-tuned on similar tasks. For SICK-E, SBERT-WK is\ninferior to two InferSent-based methods by 1.2%, which could be\nattributed to the much larger dimension of InferSent. We observe that averaging BERT outputs and [CLS] vectors give pretty\nsimilar performance. Although [CLS] provides poor performance for semantic\nsimilarity tasks, [CLS] is good at classification tasks. This is because\nthat the classification representation is used in its model training.\nFurthermore, the use of MLP as the inference tool would allow certain\ndimensions to have higher importance in the decision process. The\ncosine similarity adopted in semantic similarity tasks treats all\ndimension equally. As a result, averaging BERT outputs and [CLS] token\nrepresentation are not suitable for semantic similarity tasks. If we\nplan to apply the [CLS] representation and/or averaging BERT embeddings to\nsemantic textual similarity, clustering and retrieval tasks, we need to\nlearn an additional transformation function with external resources.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: classification .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
