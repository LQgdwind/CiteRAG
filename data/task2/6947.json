      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Defense Against Model Stealing Attacks on Convolutional Neural Networks This research was funded by Synopsys Inc. and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo enable model owners to claim their models if stolen, previous work proposes watermarking the model  [ref]21.\nWatermarking can be done by changing the output probabilities for a small subset of queries. However, this technique does not prevent model stealing.\nOther defense approaches protect against attacks by perturbing the posterior prediction.\nThese perturbation-based defenses can be categorized into two categories: proactive and reactive techniques. Reactive techniques are triggered with the detection of an ongoing extraction attack.\nThey continuously monitor the interactions with the user and the defended model to be able to assess the knowledge stolen by the attacker  or to detect an ongoing attack through detecting a deviation from the normal distribution [ref]17 or a large number of  Out-of-Distribution (OOD) queries [ref]16.\nTo detect OOD queries, [ref]16 proposes a technique called  Adaptive Misinformation (AM) where they flag as malicious queries the ones with low prediction scores.\nThen they use another model for “misinformation” that generates noise vectors which will be combined with the prediction posteriors. However, this technique is sensitive to false positives which deteriorates the model’s performance. Reactive defenses help reduce the efficiency of attacks, but they cause inference delays and increase computational costs. Proactive defenses are always perturbing the posterior predictions, regardless an attack is detected or not. Some techniques propose to truncate the probability scores or to add random noise . But, these techniques are not efficient against state-of-the-art attacks.\nThe  Reverse Sigmoid (RS) defense  leverages the last layer in a neural network, i.e., the one that outputs the prediction probabilities of each class, and changes its activation function to a reverse sigmoid.\nThis technique uses a high perturbation level which hurts the model’s transparency. To find the suitable perturbation per query, MAD  tries to solve an optimization problem where it simulates the attacker by another network and tries to add the perturbation that maximizes the error of the simulated surrogate model. It adds targeted noise to the posterior probabilities to poison the adversary’s gradient signal.\nGRAD2 is a similar approach to MAD that relies on redirecting the gradient signal. Besides, it proposes to train a surrogate model on the attacker’s queries to simulate the attacker’s knowledge. GRAD2 always assumes that the attacker will send a large batch of queries that it can use for training the simulated attacker. This hinders its practicality since it assumes that the system, where the model is implemented to perform predictions, has sufficient hardware to perform the training. In general, existing perturbation-based defenses are computationally expensive or they use high perturbations that hurt the model’s transparency. However, in real-world systems that make decisions based on predictions (e.g., a computer vision system in an autonomous vehicle), the model has to provide a level of confidence in its predictions. The techniques that provide high perturbations make the model useless for these applications.\nIn addition, optimization-based techniques require a lot of gradient calculations, which results in enormous inference delays and an increase in computational costs.\nOur proposed defense overcomes these issues through a heuristic approach that aims to add perturbations without requiring more hardware resources, as shown in Table I. We offer better trade-offs in satisfying the perturbation budget vs. the defender’s error constraint.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: To enable model owners to claim their models if stolen, previous work proposes watermarking the model  [ref]21.\nWatermarking can be done by changing the output probabilities for a small subset of queries.
