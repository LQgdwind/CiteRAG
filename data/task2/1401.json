Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: SubICap: Towards Subword-informed Image Captioning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImage captioning is a multi-modal task that aims at translating visual information into linguistic descriptions. Over the past decade, image captioning has seen remarkable progress. Image Captioning (IC) leverages the progress made in both CV and NLP, by using SOTA deep visual 4,  and linguistic models [ref]9 as building blocks of the IC framework. Moreover, various strong IC frameworks, such as encoder-decoder ,  and attention-based models , [ref]11,  have been inspired from a closely related domain, i.e., Machine Translation (MT). Various language models such as RNNs 0 and Transformers  that have shown promise in MT, have worked very well for IC as well.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: Over the past decade, image captioning has seen remarkable progress.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
