      "content": "Paper Title: CORA: Adapting CLIP for Open-Vocabulary Detection with Region Prompting and Anchor Pre-Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject detection is a fundamental vision problem that involves localizing and classifying objects from images.\nClassical object detection requires detecting objects from a closed set of categories.\nExtra annotations and training are required if objects of unseen categories need to be detected.\nIt has attracted much attention on detecting novel categories without tedious annotations, or even detect object from new category, which is currently referred as open-vocabulary detection (OVD) . Recent advances on large-scale vision-language pre-trained models, such as CLIP , enable new solutions for tackling OVD.\nCLIP learns a joint embedding space of images and text from a large-scale image-text dataset, which shows remarkable capability on visual recognition tasks.\nThe general idea of applying CLIP for OVD is to treat it as an open-vocabulary classifier.\nHowever, there are two obstacles hindering the effective use of CLIP on tackling OVD. How to adapt CLIP for region-level tasks?\nOne trivial solution is to crop regions and treat them as separate images, which has been adopted by multiple recent works  [ref]14 [ref]35  [ref]31.\nBut the distribution gap between region crops and full images leads to inferior classification accuracy.\nMEDet  mitigates this issue by augmenting the text feature with image features.\nHowever, it requires extra image-text pairs to prevent overfitting to so-called “base” classes that are seen during training.\nRegionCLIP   directly acquires regional features by RoIAlign , which is more efficient but cannot generalize well to novel classes without finetuning. The finetuning is costly when adopting a larger CLIP model. How to learn generalizable object proposals?\nViLD [ref]14, OV-DETR [ref]35, Object-Centric-OVD [ref]31, RegionCLIP  need RPN or class-agnostic object detectors  to mine potential novel class objects.\nHowever, these RPNs are strongly biased towards the base classes on which they are trained, while perform poorly on the novel classes.\nMEDet  and VL-PLM  identify this problem and adopt several handcrafted policies to rule out or merge low-quality boxes, but the performance is still bounded by the frozen RPN.\nOV-DETR [ref]35 learns generalizable object localization by conditioning box regression on class name embeddings, but at the cost of efficiency issue induced by repetitive per-class inference. In this work, we propose a new framework based on DEtection TRansformers (DETR)  that incorporates CLIP into detector training to achieve open-vocabulary detection without additional image-text data.\nSpecifically, we use a DETR-style object localizer for class-aware object localization, and the predicted boxes are encoded by pooling the intermediate feature map of the CLIP image encoder, which are classified by the CLIP text encoder with class names.\nHowever, there is a distribution gap between whole-image features from CLIP’s original visual encoder and the newly pooled region features, leading to an inferior classification accuracy.\nThus, we propose Region Prompting to adapt the CLIP image encoder, which boosts the classification performance, and also demonstrates better generalization capability than existing methods.\nWe adopt DAB-DETR  as the localizer, in which object queries are associated with dynamic anchor boxes.\nBy pre-matching the dynamic anchor boxes with the input categories before box regression (Anchor Pre-Matching), class-aware regression can be achieved without the cost of repetitive per-class inference. We validate our method on COCO  and LVIS v1.0  OVD benchmarks.\nOn the COCO OVD benchmark, our method improves AP50 of novel categories over the previous best method  by 2.4 AP50 without training on extra data, and achieves consistent gain on CLIP models of different scales.\nWhen compared under a fairer setting with extra training data, our method significantly outperforms the existing methods by 3.8 AP50 on novel categories and achieves comparable performance on base categories.\nOn the LVIS OVD benchmark, our method achieves 22.2/28.1 APr with/w.o. extra data, which significantly outperforms existing methods that are also trained with/w.o. extra data.\nBy applying region prompting on the base classes of COCO, the classification performance on the novel classes is boosted from 63.9% to 74.1%, whereas other prompting or adaptation methods easily bias towards the base classes. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows:\n(1) Our proposed region prompting effectively mitigates the gap between whole image features and region features, and generalize well in the open-vocabulary setting.\n(2) Anchor Pre-Matching enables DETR for generalizable object localization efficiently.\n(3) We achieve state-of-the-art performance on COCO and LVIS OVD benchmarks.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: use of CLIP on tackling OVD.
