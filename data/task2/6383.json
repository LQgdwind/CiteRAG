      "content": "Paper Title: Energy-Based Cross Attention for Bayesian Context Update in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe demonstrate that the proposed framework improves the controllability and compositionality of DMs, which is a significant challenge for generative models. To assess this, we split the task into synthetic and real image editing. Synthetic image editing. Text-to-image DMs provide impressive results, but it is difficult to generate images perfectly aligned with user intentions [ref]1. Although modifying prompts can guide generation, it can also introduce unintended changes in the generated content. Our results, shown in Figure 5, demonstrate that the proposed method can edit image contents while maintaining the original-prompt-related identity of the generated images thanks to the EBCU, which continuously harmonizes the latent representations and text prompts. While composable-diff [ref]22 can generate compositions, they often fail to preserve the original properties of images, such as the color in the second row, or fail to compose the desired concept, such as the boat in the first row. Real image editing. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can also edit real images, which is especially challenging as existing methods often dramatically alter input content or introduce unexpected variations. To do this, we integrate our framework with DDIM inversion  , which inverts images with meaningful text prompts into the domain of pre-trained diffusion models. First, we use the image captioning network BLIP  to automatically caption the interested image, following [ref]28. Next, we obtain the inverted noise latents of the input image using Diffusion Pivotal Inversion . Then, we apply EBCQ and EBCU while denoising the inverted latents. The optimized unconditional textual embedding vector is also targeted for additional EBCUs. The results in Figure 6 demonstrate that our method achieves better editing performance by avoiding undesired changes. Quantitative comparisons. We further conducted a comparative analysis of the proposed framework against several state-of-the-art diffusion-based image editing methods    [ref]28. For our evaluations, we focus on two image-to-image translation tasks. The first one is an animal transition task, which translates (1) cat →→\\rightarrow dog, (2) horse →→\\rightarrow zebra, and (3) adding glasses to cat input images (cat →→\\rightarrow cat with glasses). The second one is a human transition task, which translates (1) woman →→\\rightarrow man, (2) woman →→\\rightarrow woman with glasses, and (3) woman →→\\rightarrow man with glasses. Source images are retrieved from the LAION 5B dataset  and CelebA-HQ . Motivated by  [ref]28, we measure CLIP Accuracy and DINO-ViT structure distance. Experimental details are provided in the appendix E including explanations of baselines, datasets, metrics, and hyperparameter configurations. Table 1 and 2 in the appendix show that the proposed energy-based framework gets a high CLIP-Acc while having low Structure Dist. It implies that the proposed framework can perform the best edit while still retaining the structure of the original input image. While DDIM + word swap records remarkably high CLIP-Acc in horse →→\\rightarrow zebra task, Figure 8 shows that such improvements are based on unintended changes in the overall structure. More visualizations are provided in the appendix E.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: the task into synthetic and real image editing.
