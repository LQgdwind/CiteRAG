      "content": "Paper Title: DisCo-CLIP: A Distributed Contrastive Loss for Memory Efficient CLIP Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImage-Text Data Sets. A large-scale image-text data set is a prerequisite for contrastive image-text pre-training. In the literature, there are many private¬†  or public data sets¬† [ref]35 [ref]34. LAION-400M¬†[ref]35 is a data set with 400 million image-text pairs filtered by CLIP score. We crawl the images according to the provided URLs and finally obtain 360M image-text pairs as some URLs are expired and no longer available. LAION-5B¬†[ref]34 is a larger data set with 5 billion image-text pairs. It contains a subset of 2.32 billion English image-text pairs. We refer to this subset as LAION-2B as in¬†[ref]34. We also crawl the data set according to the released URLs and finally obtain 2.1 billion image-text pairs.\nIn this paper, for a fair comparison with CLIP¬†[ref]27 and LAION¬†[ref]34 which conduct experiments using 400M data pairs, we create a subset of 400M image-text pairs from our crawled LAION-2B and also make a subset of 100M image-text pairs for ablation study. Pre-training Details. The implementation of our DisCo-CLIP is based on OpenCLIP222https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip¬†, an open source CLIP implementation. We follow the original CLIP333https://github.com/openai/CLIP¬†[ref]27 and mainly use ViT-B/32¬† as the vision backbone.Training images are resized to 224√ó224224224224\\times 224 and fed to the vision backbone. For the text backbone, we use a text Transformer¬† , and set the maximum length of text to 76 as in ¬†[ref]27. Due to limited time and GPU resource, we do not train ViT-L/14 because it takes more than four times of training time compared to ViT-B/32. It should also be noted that in all our experiments, we do not use the GradAccum strategy as in BASIC¬†. Checkpointing is enabled in vanilla CLIP and our DisCo-CLIP.\nWe train models using an Adam¬† optimizer and cosine learning rate scheduler with a linear warmup¬†. Weight decay regularization¬† is used on all parameters except bias, layer normalization, and temperature in contrastive loss. Since our training experiments use different batch sizes, according to previous works¬† , we change the learning rate for different batch sizes. For our learning rate scheduler, we first define a base learning rate of 5e-4 and a base batch size of 32,768, and then linearly warm it up to the maximum learning rate. The maximum learning rate is determined according to a linear strategy, max_lr = base_lr‚àóbatch size32,768max_lr = base_lrbatch size32,768\\text{max\\_lr = base\\_lr}*\\frac{\\text{batch size}}{\\text{32,768}}. Training stability is a challenging issue in mixed-precision training as NaN might happen in many cases.\nWe obverse that Œ≤2subscriptùõΩ2\\beta_{2} in Adam is very important for training stability and find 0.98 works well for our experiments instead of the default value of 0.999.\nFor most of our experiments, we use 64 NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs for model training, but for some experiments, we only use 8 NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs to show that our solution is more resource-efficient.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: Image-Text Data Sets.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
