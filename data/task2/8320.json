      "content": "Paper Title: On sampling two spin models using the local connective constant\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor integer r≥2𝑟2r\\geq 2, it is well-known that the Ising model on the infinite r𝑟r-ary tree, with external field\nλ>0𝜆0\\lambda>0 and inverse temperature β≥0𝛽0\\beta\\geq 0,\nexhibits uniqueness for Recall that when β>1𝛽1\\beta>1, the Ising model is called ferromagnetic, while for\nβ<1𝛽1\\beta<1, it is called antiferromagnetic.\nFor z>1𝑧1z>1 and δ∈(0,1)𝛿01\\delta\\in(0,1), we let the interval As far as the Ising model is concerned, we obtain the following result. For ε∈(0,1)𝜀01\\varepsilon\\in(0,1), Δ>1Δ1{\\Delta}>1, k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1, >k1{}_{k}>1 and λ>0𝜆0\\lambda>0\nconsider graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) of maximum degree ΔΔ{\\Delta} such that the radius-k𝑘k connective constant is k.\nLet μ𝜇\\mu be the Ising model on G𝐺G with external field λ𝜆\\lambda and inverse temperature β∈𝕌Ising(,kε)\\beta\\in{\\mathbb{U}_{\\rm Ising}}({}_{k},\\varepsilon). There is a constant C=C(Δ,,kε)C={C({\\Delta},{}_{k},\\varepsilon)} such that the mixing time of Glauber dynamics\non μ𝜇\\mu is at most C​n​log⁡n𝐶𝑛𝑛Cn\\log n. The maximum degree bounds that apply in our setting are those from  .\nSpecifically, for a graph G𝐺G of maximum degree ΔΔ{\\Delta}, they imply optimum mixing for Glauber dynamics\non the Ising model with inverse temperature β∈𝕌Ising​(Δ−1,δ)𝛽subscript𝕌IsingΔ1𝛿\\beta\\in{\\mathbb{U}_{\\rm Ising}}({\\Delta}-1,\\delta) and external field λ>0𝜆0\\lambda>0.\nSimilarly to Theorem 1.1, with Theorem 1.5, we improve on the max-degree bound\nwhen <kΔ−1{}_{k}<{\\Delta}-1. When k gets its maximum value Δ−1Δ1{\\Delta}-1,\nthe bound in Theorem 1.5 matches the max-degree one. As mentioned earlier, it is natural to compare Theorem 1.5 with results in the literature where\nthe mixing bound is better than the maximum degree one.\nTable 1 summarises our applications of Theorem 1.5 for the Ising model on\nthe triangular lattice 𝕋𝕋\\mathbb{T}, the hexagonal lattice ℍℍ\\mathbb{H}, the octagonal lattice\n𝕆𝕆\\mathbb{O} and the square lattice ℤrsuperscriptℤ𝑟\\mathbb{Z}^{r}, for dimensions r=1,2,…,5𝑟12…5r=1,2,\\ldots,5.\nAs mentioned before, the choice of these lattices is only indicative; there many other structures that we do not consider here due to space limitations. Perhaps one of the best-understood cases in the literature is the Ising model on the square lattice ℤrsuperscriptℤ𝑟\\mathbb{Z}^{r}, for r>0𝑟0r>0.\nThe best bounds on the mixing time for Glauber dynamics have been known since the 1990s from the influential work of Martinelli\nand Olivieri in 1 2. Theorem 1.5 does not improve on these results.\nHowever, the rapid mixing bounds we obtain for the remaining lattices are new.\nPrior to our results here, the only known bounds were with respect to the maximum degree ΔΔ{\\Delta}. For completeness we state the rapid mixing bounds for the Ising model on\nG​(n,d/n)𝐺𝑛𝑑𝑛G(n,d/n). For the ferromagnetic Ising model, see the work of Mossel and Sly in 3.\nThe bounds for the antiferromagnetic Ising are implied in the work of Efthymiou, Hayes, Štefankovič and Vigoda in [ref]16,\nwhile explicit bounds appear in .\nOur results here do not have any implication for G​(n,d/n)𝐺𝑛𝑑𝑛G(n,d/n) because we consider bounded degrees. For the Ising model and G,k, we have the following result, which is analogous to Theorem 1.2. For ε∈(0,1)𝜀01\\varepsilon\\in(0,1), λ>0𝜆0\\lambda>0, ρ>1ρ1\\uprho>1 and integers N>0𝑁0N>0, Δ>1Δ1{\\Delta}>1,\nconsider graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) of maximum degree ΔΔ{\\Delta} such that ∥()G,kN∥21/N=ρ\\|({}_{G,k})^{N}\\|^{1/N}_{2}=\\uprho.\nLet μ𝜇\\mu be the Ising model on G𝐺G with external field λ𝜆\\lambda and inverse temperature β∈𝕌Ising​(ρ,ε)𝛽subscript𝕌Isingρ𝜀\\beta\\in{\\mathbb{U}_{\\rm Ising}}({\\uprho},\\varepsilon). There is a constant C=C​(Δ,ρ,ε)𝐶𝐶Δρ𝜀C={C({\\Delta},{\\uprho},\\varepsilon)} such that the mixing time of Glauber dynamics\non μ𝜇\\mu is at most C​n​log⁡n𝐶𝑛𝑛Cn\\log n. As far as the Ising model and the adjacency matrix are concerned, we obtain the following\nresult. For ε∈(0,1)𝜀01\\varepsilon\\in(0,1), λ>0𝜆0\\lambda>0, ϱ>1italic-ϱ1{\\varrho}>1 and integer Δ>1Δ1{\\Delta}>1,\nconsider graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) of maximum degree ΔΔ{\\Delta} such that ∥∥2G=ϱ\\|{}_{G}\\|_{2}={\\varrho}.\nLet μ𝜇\\mu be the Ising model on G𝐺G with external field λ𝜆\\lambda and inverse temperature β∈𝕌Ising​(ϱ,ε)𝛽subscript𝕌Isingitalic-ϱ𝜀\\beta\\in{\\mathbb{U}_{\\rm Ising}}({\\varrho},\\varepsilon). There is a constant C=C​(Δ,ϱ,ε)𝐶𝐶Δitalic-ϱ𝜀C={C({\\Delta},{\\varrho},\\varepsilon)} such that the mixing time of Glauber dynamics\non μ𝜇\\mu is at most C​n​log⁡n𝐶𝑛𝑛Cn\\log n. Theorem 1.7 matches Hayes’ results in  for the Ising model.\nWe only present it for the sake of completeness. We get results similar to those in Theorem 1.4 for the antiferromagnetic Ising model.\nNote that there is no hardness region for the ferromagnetic Ising model .\nSpecifically, using Theorem 1.5 and 9   for the antiferromagnetic Ising model,\nwe have the following result. Unless NP=RPNPRP{\\rm NP}={\\rm RP}, for ε∈(0,1)𝜀01\\varepsilon\\in(0,1), Δ≥3Δ3{\\Delta}\\geq 3, N,k≥1𝑁𝑘1N,k\\geq 1 and ρ>1ρ1\\uprho>1\nthe following is true: For any 0<β≤ρ−1+ερ+1−ε0𝛽ρ1𝜀ρ1𝜀0<\\beta\\leq\\frac{\\uprho-1+\\varepsilon}{\\uprho+1-\\varepsilon} and λ𝜆\\lambda such that\nwe are not in the tree uniqueness region, there is no FPRAS for estimating\nthe partition function of the antiferromagnetic Ising model\nfor graphs G𝐺G of maximum degree at most ΔΔ{\\Delta} such that ∥()G,kN∥21/N=ρ\\|({}_{G,k})^{N}\\|^{1/N}_{2}=\\uprho. For any ρ−1+ερ+1−ε≤β≤1ρ1𝜀ρ1𝜀𝛽1\\frac{\\uprho-1+\\varepsilon}{\\uprho+1-\\varepsilon}\\leq\\beta\\leq 1 and any λ>0𝜆0\\lambda>0,\nthere is an FPRAS for estimating the partition function of the antiferromagnetic Ising model\nfor graphs G𝐺G of maximum degree at most ΔΔ{\\Delta} such that ∥()G,kN∥21/N=ρ\\|({}_{G,k})^{N}\\|^{1/N}_{2}=\\uprho. As noted before, using Theorem 1.5, we can also express the above dichotomy by using the radius-k𝑘k\nconnective constant k instead of ∥()G,kN∥21/N\\|({}_{G,k})^{N}\\|^{1/N}_{2}.\nWe do not state this result here because it is incremental to Theorem 1.8.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: For the ferromagnetic Ising model, see the work of Mossel and Sly in 3.\nThe bounds for the antiferromagnetic Ising are implied in the work of Efthymiou, Hayes, Štefankovič and Vigoda in [ref]16,\nwhile explicit bounds appear in .\nOur results here do not have any implication for G​(n,d/n)𝐺𝑛𝑑𝑛G(n,d/n) because we consider bounded degrees.
