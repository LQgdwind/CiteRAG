This is mainly due to the difficulty of correlating information between the camera plane and the BEV given the pinhole camera projection model 2 and the lack of geometric information about the scene. Some methods such as Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS), predict a probability distribution for a set of discrete depth values in order to project the image features to 3D space; these features are then sum-pooled to generate the BEV map that is used for semantic grid generation [ref]4. FIERY follows the same projection method as LSS and accumulates these features in the BEV along a temporal dimension to create the semantic grids [ref]5. Compared to LSS, M2BEV assumes a uniform depth distribution along the camera ray to project the image features to a voxel space that is then reduced to a BEV using convolutions . Others, like the Pyramid Occupancy Network, the View Parsing Network (VPN) and the Variational Encoder-Decoder Network use fully-connected networks to ’shrink’ the 2D camera information into 1-dimensional feature vectors that are then sampled to generate the 2D BEV   . Attention mechanisms have also been proposed as a method to correlate the information from the camera plane to the BEV plane. Saha et al. generate the BEV from image features by projecting vertical scanlines in the image plane to polar rays in the top-view using inter-plane attention and polar ray self-attention mechanisms . Zhou and Krähenbühl propose a camera-aware, cross-view attention mechanism to learn the mapping from each camera image to the BEV using the camera parameters . BEVFormer proposes the use of deformable attention 3 to generate the BEV feature map from features across different image scales and timesteps .\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: for a set of discrete depth values in order to project the image features to 3D space; these features are then sum-pooled to generate the BEV map that is used for semantic grid generation [ref]4.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
