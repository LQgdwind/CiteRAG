      "content": "Paper Title: CSI-fingerprinting Indoor Localization via Attention-Augmented Residual Convolutional Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare our methods with four SOTA CNN-based methods, whose training processes are set the same as ours for a fair comparison: Sun19 [ref]7: In [ref]7, a feature learning module, called CALP, is proposed, and the positioning method is composed of a cascade of five CALP modules followed by a FC layer. Arnold19 : The method consists of two Conv layers, two pooling layers with a stride (1,4)14(1,4) and four FC layers with 128 hidden neurons. For the Conv layers, we set the kernel size as (5,5)55(5,5). Chin20 : The method has\nfour cascaded gated Conv, Conv, and pooling layers with stride (1,4)14(1,4), plus a 666-layer FCN, where the hidden neurons have a configuration of 102410241024-512512512-256256256-256256256-646464-222. The method is originally proposed for a system with 924924924 subcarriers; therefore, it uses a large pooling stride. When we apply it to the Ku Leuven Boardroom datasets, we reduce the pooling stride from (1,4)14(1,4) to (1,2)12(1,2). We also enlarge the convolution kernel from (1,3)13(1,3) to (5,5)55(5,5) for better performance. Bast20 : The authors of  are also the releasers of Ku Leuven datasets. Their network contains 13 Conv layers, improved with skip connection and drop-out layers, and three FC layers at the end. MHSA22 : The authors of 555The authors also propose a method called MHSA-EC by computing and using effective CSI. As the subcarrier used by each antenna is not provided in the dataset, we are unable to calculate the effective CSI, thus we do not compare with MHSA-EC. also implement attention mechanism in their network. In their network, a 1D-CNN is used to extract features from the spatial dimension and the frequency dimension of CSI, respectively, followed by a stack of 1D self-attention layers. This setting differs from our method where these two dimensions are always jointly considered, where 2D-Conv and 2D-attention are utilized. We set the number of 1D Conv layers as 444 and the feature maps across layers as 646464, which have been fine-tuned. Also, we use 444 MHSA layers, following . Wang18 : The positioning network used in  contains 333 Convs with 5×5555\\times 5 kernels and 111 Conv with 3×3333\\times 3 kernels. A (2,2)22(2,2) AveP is used after each Conv. At last, the features are flattened and mapped to locations via a FC layer. We use the raw CSI in KU Leuven datasets as the input to the network666The authors of  also propose two preprocessing steps, 1) estimating AoA from CSI, and 2) constructing multiple images from AoA maps in different timestamps. These two steps cannot be repeated in Ku Leuven datasets, thus we omit these steps.. Hoang20 : Work  uses three 5×5555\\times 5 Convs with 101010 output features to extract information from CSI, followed by a 2-layer FCN. The number of hidden neurons in FCN is set as 1/101101/10 the feature size in CNN originally. This setting exceeds the GPU memory limit in the training phase. Thus, we reduce 1/101101/10 to 1/201201/20, and the FCN has a size of 320032003200-222.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: We compare our methods with four SOTA CNN-based methods, whose training processes are set the same as ours for a fair comparison: Sun19 [ref]7: In [ref]7, a feature learning module, called CALP, is proposed, and the positioning method is composed of a cascade of five CALP modules followed by a FC layer.
