      "content": "Paper Title: Equivalence Between SE(3) Equivariant Networks via Steerable Kernels and Group Convolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAny non rotation equivariant network F𝐹F operating on signals over f:ℝ3→ℝ:𝑓→superscriptℝ3ℝf:{\\mathbb{R}}^{3}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}} can be made rotation equivariant by considering the associated multi-view network defined by F~(f)(x,R):=F(R.f)(x)\\tilde{F}(f)(x,R):=F(R.f)(x) where R∈SO​(3)𝑅SO3R\\in\\mathrm{SO}(3) acts of f𝑓f by (R.f)(x):=f(R−1x)(R.f)(x):=f(R^{-1}x). We immediately have the equivariance relation F~(R.f)(x,H)=F~(f)(x,RH)\\tilde{F}(R.f)(x,H)=\\tilde{F}(f)(x,RH). Variants of this approach have been considered in  . Such approaches however are limited as there is no information aggregation across multiple views at every layer, in practice pose information is aggregated at a later stage (at the last layer). In Section 4.2 we show that multi-view-CNNs are special cases of SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3)-CNNs. Filters used by standard CNNs do not have predictable behavior under rotation. However it is possible do design filters which are equivariant to rotations . Such filters are based on so-called steerable kernels bases which are vector valued maps κ:ℝd→ℝK:𝜅→superscriptℝ𝑑superscriptℝ𝐾\\kappa:{\\mathbb{R}}^{d}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}^{K} (d=2,3𝑑23d=2,3) such that any rotation R∈SO​(d)𝑅SO𝑑R\\in\\mathrm{SO}(d) of the input x∈ℝd𝑥superscriptℝ𝑑x\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^{d} induces a rotation D​(R)∈SO​(d)𝐷𝑅SO𝑑D(R)\\in\\mathrm{SO}(d) of the output κ​(R​x)=D​(R)​κ​(x)𝜅𝑅𝑥𝐷𝑅𝜅𝑥\\kappa(Rx)=D(R)\\kappa(x). In 2D such bases can be obtained using the Fourier basis, while in 3D it can be obtained using Spherical Harmonics. This property of steerable kernels transfers to convolution features, for any scalar signal f:ℝd→ℝ:𝑓→superscriptℝ𝑑ℝf:{\\mathbb{R}}^{d}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}} the vector field v​(f):=f∗κassign𝑣𝑓∗𝑓𝜅v(f):=f\\ast\\kappa satisfies v(R.f)(x)=D(R)v(f)(R−1x)v(R.f)(x)=D(R)v(f)(R^{-1}x) where R𝑅R acts of f𝑓f by (R.f)(x):=f(R−1x)(R.f)(x):=f(R^{-1}x). Steerable CNNs build on this idea to produce and operate on equivaiant fields satisfying the aforementioned equivariance relation. Several other works [ref]3 [ref]4 introduced equivalent constructions on point cloud domains, and we present the construction of [ref]3 in Section 4.3. Another way to approach equivariance is to consider functions defined over the group G𝐺G to which we want to be equivariant. The action of G𝐺G on functions f:G→ℝ:𝑓→𝐺ℝf:G\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}} is given by (g.f)(x):=f(g−1x)(g.f)(x):=f(g^{-1}x). A natural way to achieve G𝐺G-equivariance is through group convolution (G𝐺G-convolution) which generalizes the usual notion of convolution to arbitrary groups , group convolution takes a function and a kernel f,κ:G→ℝ:𝑓𝜅→𝐺ℝf,\\kappa:G\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}} and produces a function f∗Gκ:G→ℝ:subscript∗𝐺𝑓𝜅→𝐺ℝf\\ast_{G}\\kappa:G\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}} satisfying the equivariance property (g.f)∗Gκ=g.(f∗Gκ)(g.f)\\ast_{G}\\kappa=g.(f\\ast_{G}\\kappa) for all g∈G𝑔𝐺g\\in G. In , Kondor and Trivedi show that any equivariant continuous linear map between continuous functions on a compact group G𝐺G must be given by a group convolution. A similar result follows from   when the group is unimodular. Group CNNs based on group convolutions inherit the same equivariance property. Multiple designs have been proposed, in 2D SE​(2)SE2\\mathrm{SE}(2) \nand for various subgroups of SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3): SO​(3)SO3\\mathrm{SO}(3) , ℝ3⋊Cright-normal-factor-semidirect-productsuperscriptℝ3𝐶{\\mathbb{R}}^{3}\\rtimes C , H𝐻H , ℝ3⋊Hright-normal-factor-semidirect-productsuperscriptℝ3𝐻{\\mathbb{R}}^{3}\\rtimes H  where C,H⊂SO​(3)𝐶𝐻SO3C,H\\subset\\mathrm{SO}(3) are the symmetry group of the cube and the icosahedral (symmetries of the icosahedron) groups respectively. We present the general definition of group convolution and CNNs in Section 3. Thus we have reviewed three approaches to SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3)-equivariance: the first is through multi-view augmentation a second is through 3D steerable CNNs relying on usual ℝ3superscriptℝ3{\\mathbb{R}}^{3}-convolution of equivariant vector/tensor fields over ℝ3superscriptℝ3{\\mathbb{R}}^{3} with SO​(3)SO3\\mathrm{SO}(3) steerable kernels and the other is through SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3) convolution of scalar fields over SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3). Our main focus in this work is to provide a detailed proof and analysis of the equivalence between 3D steerable CNNs and SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3) group CNNs stated in [ref]16 and to provide an explicit formulas to translate expressions and filters between the two representations (4.4) which has not been done in prior works. The equivalence principle described in [ref]16 says that equivariant tensor field representations arise as harmonic decompositions of SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3) signals and convolutions. An equivariant vector obtained via 3D steerable CNNs v(R.f)(x)=D(R)v(f)(x)v(R.f)(x)=D(R)v(f)(x) can be thought as a scalar function on SE​(3)=ℝ3⋊SO​(3)SE3right-normal-factor-semidirect-productsuperscriptℝ3SO3\\mathrm{SE}(3)={\\mathbb{R}}^{3}\\rtimes\\mathrm{SO}(3),\nw:(x,R)↦∑i​jDi​j​(R)​v​(f)j​(x)∈ℝ:𝑤maps-to𝑥𝑅subscript𝑖𝑗subscript𝐷𝑖𝑗𝑅𝑣subscript𝑓𝑗𝑥ℝw:(x,R)\\mapsto\\sum_{ij}D_{ij}(R)v(f)_{j}(x)\\in{\\mathbb{R}} and we show that performing 3D steerable convolution on v𝑣v is equivalent to a SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3) convolution on w𝑤w (4.3). As a part of our analysis we also analyze SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3)-convolution separability used in  to propose an efficient implementation of SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3)-CNN. Moreover, we provide additional insights showing that multi-view CNNs can be realized as SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3) CNNs (4.2). While there are general results regarding equivalence of different approaches for SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3) equivariance [ref]16 , to the best of our knowledge, our detailed analysis has not been explicitly performed in existing literature      . Furthermore the existing theories are stated in the continuous case while actual works like [ref]3 [ref]4  operate on irregular domains like point clouds which are not invariant by rotation nor translation. In contrast our analysis covers both cases. Finally, we investigate SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3)-CNNs non-linearities in the harmonic domain and derive corresponding non linearities for Tensor Field Networks, [ref]3 and similar constructions  [ref]4 by equivalence. We show experimental results for [ref]3 in Section 4.5.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: f𝑓f by (R.f)(x):=f(R−1x)(R.f)(x):=f(R^{-1}x).
