      "content": "Paper Title: Can Shape-Infused Joint Embeddings Improve Image-Conditioned 3D Diffusion?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDifferent approaches have been proposed to obtain generative models capable of synthesizing 3D objects. Early advances were marked by the introduction of 3D Variational Autoencoders such as 3D-VAE , which proposed a voxel-based architecture for 3D generation. Building on the success in two-dimensional spaces, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)  were adapted for creating 3D voxelized shapes, a notable example being 3D-GAN. Despite achieving impressive results, GANs often face challenges related to training stability, primarily due to the adversarial nature of their generator and discriminator networks. This issue spurred interest in alternative generative approaches, including flow-based models , Energy-Based Models (EBMs) [ref]14, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) [ref]15 [ref]16. Flow-based models, such as DPF-Net , manipulate probability distributions to generate samples through variable transformations. EBMs, exemplified by 3D DescriptorNet , optimize energy functions over observed variables and generate new data via Langevin Dynamics  . In contrast, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) denoise a progressively noised input sample, a process achieved through a forward diffusion mechanism. Once trained, the model is utilized to reverse this forward diffusion process, thereby enabling the generation of samples from mere noise. They have proven to be extraordinarily effective in text-to-image generation works such as DALLE-2  and Stable Diffusion . Following their success in two-dimensional generation, the extension of DDPMs to three-dimensional generation became a logical progression. Initial explorations in 3D Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), such as PVD , have demonstrated their effectiveness in generating unconditional shapes, surpassing earlier generative techniques. PVD employs Point-Voxel CNN  to generate point cloud shapes, while also reporting challenges in training voxel-based DDPMs. Due to its unconditional approach, PVD requires distinct models and training processes for each new shape category. In contrast, Luo and Hu  introduce a point cloud DDPM conditioned on shape latents derived from a point cloud autoencoder. This advancement allows a single model to produce several object categories, showcasing the versatility of conditioned DDPMs. Hui et al.  have applied diffusion processes to SDFs wavelet coefficients, generating coarse volumes and utilizing a refiner network for detailing. Leveraging latent diffusion, LION  demonstrates image-conditioning of a 3D generation model using CLIP  text or image embeddings. However, although well-structured, CLIP embeddings inherently lack 3D features, and their use in 3D generation might lead to loss of fine-grained structural shape properties and details that are not captured by images or text. We aim to assess these limitations by employing joint image-shape embeddings.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: to the adversarial nature of their generator and discriminator networks.
