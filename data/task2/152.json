      "content": "Paper Title: Distributed Training of Deep Neural Network Acoustic Models for Automatic Speech Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCentralized distributed training relies on a PS to communicate with all the learners. All the communication takes place between the server and the learners and there is no communication among the learners. This introduces a high communication cost at the PS, which is proportional to the number of learners, and will eventually hurt the scaling of the training. A PS does not necessarily need to be realized as a physical server or sharded servers . It can also be conceptually realized via the allreduce operation  based on message passing. In HPC terminology, an operation is a “reduce” operation if it is commutative and associative (e.g. summation). Allreduce is the operation that reduces all the elements and broadcasts the reduction results to each participant. Decentralized distributed training does not require a centralized server to support the communication. Fig.3(b) shows how decentralized SGD works. The learners form a network by connecting with each other following some topology (e.g. a ring). Each learner keeps a local copy of the model and carries out gradient computation and model updates locally. The updated local model is then propagated to other learners in the network typically via model averaging. Consider the centralized data parallel SGD setting of Eq.5 under synchronous mode. Suppose each learner pulls the model from the PS, evaluates the gradient using batch size Mlsubscript𝑀𝑙M_{l} and updates the model locally Then we average models across all the learners which shows that given the basic SGD in Eq.5 one-step model averaging and gradient averaging are equivalent. Eq.13 also provides a way to create a decentralized implementation of centralized SGD where all learners form a ring and the PS is replaced by a global model averaging carried out by the allreduce operation using reduction (sum) followed by broadcast. In general, the mathematical model of data parallel decentralized SGD is given by Eq.14: where, for l=1,…,L𝑙1…𝐿l=1,\\dots,L, 𝐖k=[wk(𝟣),…,wk(𝗅),…,wk(𝖫)]subscript𝐖𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝑤1𝑘…subscriptsuperscript𝑤𝗅𝑘…subscriptsuperscript𝑤𝖫𝑘\\mathbf{W}_{k}=[w^{\\scriptstyle{\\mathsf{(1)}}}_{k},\\dots,w^{\\scriptstyle{\\mathsf{(l)}}}_{k},\\dots,w^{\\scriptstyle{\\mathsf{(L)}}}_{k}] is a matrix with each column containing model parameters in each learner l𝑙l at iteration k𝑘k 𝐓𝐓\\mathbf{T} is a mixing matrix for the model averaging pattern among learners given a network topology 𝚽k=[w^k(𝟣),…,w^k(𝗅),…,w^k(𝖫)]subscript𝚽𝑘subscriptsuperscript^𝑤1𝑘…subscriptsuperscript^𝑤𝗅𝑘…subscriptsuperscript^𝑤𝖫𝑘\\mathbf{\\Phi}_{k}=[\\hat{w}^{\\scriptstyle{\\mathsf{(1)}}}_{k},\\dots,\\hat{w}^{\\scriptstyle{\\mathsf{(l)}}}_{k},\\dots,\\hat{w}^{\\scriptstyle{\\mathsf{(L)}}}_{k}] is a matrix with each column containing model parameters used for computing gradient in each learner l𝑙l at iteration k𝑘k 𝝃k=[ξk(𝟣),…,ξk(𝗅),…,ξk(𝖫)]subscript𝝃𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝜉1𝑘…subscriptsuperscript𝜉𝗅𝑘…subscriptsuperscript𝜉𝖫𝑘\\bm{\\xi}_{k}=[\\xi^{\\scriptstyle{\\mathsf{(1)}}}_{k},\\dots,\\xi^{\\scriptstyle{\\mathsf{(l)}}}_{k},\\dots,\\xi^{\\scriptstyle{\\mathsf{(L)}}}_{k}] is a matrix with each column containing indexing random variables for mini-batch samples used for computing gradients in each learner l𝑙l at iteration k𝑘k g​(𝚽k,𝝃k)=[1M1​∑m=1M1∇f​(w^k(𝟣);ξk,m(𝟣)),…,1ML​∑m=1ML∇f​(w^k(𝖫);ξk,m(𝖫))]𝑔subscript𝚽𝑘subscript𝝃𝑘1subscript𝑀1superscriptsubscript𝑚1subscript𝑀1∇𝑓subscriptsuperscript^𝑤1𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝜉1𝑘𝑚…1subscript𝑀𝐿superscriptsubscript𝑚1subscript𝑀𝐿∇𝑓subscriptsuperscript^𝑤𝖫𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝜉𝖫𝑘𝑚g(\\mathbf{\\Phi}_{k},\\bm{\\xi}_{k})=[\\frac{1}{M_{1}}\\sum_{m=1}^{M_{1}}\\nabla f(\\hat{w}^{\\scriptstyle{\\mathsf{(1)}}}_{k};\\xi^{\\scriptstyle{\\mathsf{(1)}}}_{k,m}),\\dots,\\frac{1}{M_{L}}\\sum_{m=1}^{M_{L}}\\nabla f(\\hat{w}^{\\scriptstyle{\\mathsf{(L)}}}_{k};\\xi^{\\scriptstyle{\\mathsf{(L)}}}_{k,m})] is a matrix with each column containing gradients computed in each learner l𝑙l at iteration k𝑘k The first term on the right in Eq.14 describes the communication pattern among learners while the second term depends on gradient computation on each learner. The two terms can be evaluated concurrently. Each learner keeps a local model and computes the gradients locally. Meanwhile, the local model is also averaged with other learners in the network through the mixing matrix. If the computation takes a longer time than the communication, the first term can be entirely overlapped by the second term. Eq.14 can also be carried out in synchronous [ref]26[ref]9 or asynchronous [ref]9 mode. In synchronous mode, the model update has to hold until the two terms are both in place. In asynchronous mode, the model update takes place whenever a learner finishes its local computation. By introducing various synchronization mechanisms between the two terms, Eq.14 can cover a broad variety of decentralized training strategies. It is also worth pointing out that although it is suitable for theoretical analysis of convergence behaviors of a training strategy, Eq.14 does not reflect its communication cost which mainly includes the time of data transfer from storage and memory, model/gradient transfer between CPU and GPU and model/gradient averaging among learners. Model averaging in the decentralized SGD is indicated by the mixing matrix 𝐓𝐓\\mathbf{T} which is typically chosen as doubly stochastic matrices. A matrix 𝐓=(ti​j)𝐓subscript𝑡𝑖𝑗\\mathbf{T}=(t_{ij}) is called a doubly stochastic matrix if ti​j∈ [ref]1subscript𝑡𝑖𝑗01t_{ij}\\in [ref]1 and ∑iti​j=∑jti​j=1subscript𝑖subscript𝑡𝑖𝑗subscript𝑗subscript𝑡𝑖𝑗1\\sum_{i}t_{ij}=\\sum_{j}t_{ij}=1. For instance, where 𝐓1subscript𝐓1\\mathbf{T}_{1} represents a model averaging scheme in which each learner averages its local models with its immediate left and right neighbors in a ring. 𝐓usubscript𝐓𝑢\\mathbf{T}_{u} represents the scheme where local models of all learners are averaged. Treating 𝐓𝐓\\mathbf{T} as a transition matrix of a Markov chain, if its represented chain is irreducible and aperiodic, it has a stationary uniform distribution 𝐓usubscript𝐓𝑢\\mathbf{T}_{u}: 𝐓n→𝐓u→superscript𝐓𝑛subscript𝐓𝑢\\mathbf{T}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{T}_{u} when n→∞→𝑛n\\rightarrow\\infty. It indicates that with sufficient rounds of model averaging under 𝐓𝐓\\mathbf{T}, local models of all learners will reach consensus, which is the average of all local models. In recent years, decentralized parallel SGD has been theoretically shown to be equally good in terms of convergence rate as the conventional SGD [ref]26. Communication-wise, decentralized parallel SGD is advantageous over the centralized strategies as it removes the communication barrier on the PS. Recent work from IBM [ref]9 has demonstrated good performance in both speedup and WER using asynchronous decentralized strategies in large-scale acoustic modeling. In particular, a hybrid distributed setting was proposed in  that combines synchronous and asynchronous modes under the same decentralized parallel SGD framework. Asynchronous decentralized strategies are also found to tolerate larger batch sizes relative to the centralized strategies.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: through the mixing matrix.
