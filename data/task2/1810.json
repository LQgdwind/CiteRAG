      "content": "Paper Title: Uncertainty for Identifying Open-Set Errors in Visual Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual object detectors localise and classify objects in an image, with a bounding box to describe object location and a class label to describe the object’s semantic category. Recently, the task of probabilistic object detection was proposed to to include uncertainty estimation , where each detection additionally contains a spatial and semantic uncertainty. While a number of recent works have explored spatial uncertainty estimation    4 5    or uncertainty estimation in 3D-LiDAR object detection       , we focus on semantic uncertainty estimation for image-based object detection. We refer the reader to  for a review on probabilistic object detection techniques. Kendall et al.  identified epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty as especially relevant for deep networks. Aleatoric uncertainty is due to noise or randomness present in the data (e.g. sensor noise or object occlusions)  . Epistemic uncertainty is uncertainty in a model’s parameters due to lack of knowledge or data , and can be used to identify inputs not represented in the model’s training data – epistemic uncertainty is required for identifying open-set errors . Object detectors that estimate epistemic uncertainty in the semantic output  [ref]6 5 4  utilise MC Dropout  or Deep Ensembles . Both methods are sampling-based techniques [ref]6, relying on testing an input multiple times and combining the results to obtain an uncertainty estimate. MC Dropout was proposed to approximate a Bayesian Neural Network , performing inference several times while dropout is enabled. Deep Ensembles instead performs inference with several distinct models . In addition to using MC Dropout, Harakeh et al. 5 proposed a Bayesian post-processing method to replace non-maximum suppression (NMS), showing this improved the uncertainty estimation 5. In contrast to   [ref]6 4 5, we propose a technique for estimating epistemic uncertainty that requires only a single inference pass, adding minimal computation.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: inputs not represented in the model’s training data – epistemic uncertainty is required for identifying open-set errors .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
