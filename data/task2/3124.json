      "content": "Paper Title: Collective Discrete Optimisation as Judgment Aggregation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now show that each of the rules defined in the specific settings of participatory budgeting, collective scheduling, and collective networking, are all instances of the general rules we defined in Section 3.2.\nRecall that a rule ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} is an instance of rule ℛ′superscriptℛ′\\mathcal{R}^{{{}^{\\prime}}} if there exists a translation from the setting of ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} to the setting of ℛ′superscriptℛ′\\mathcal{R}^{{{}^{\\prime}}} such that the two rules give equivalent outcomes.\nIn the following proposition we prove that three known rules from different settings are instances of the median rule (ℛsimples​u​msubscriptsuperscriptℛ𝑠𝑢𝑚simple\\mathcal{R}^{{sum}}_{{\\textbf{{simple}}}}). The following rules are all instances of the median rule: the max rule with cardinality satisfaction measure by Talmon and Faliszewski , the maximum collective spanning tree by Darmann et al. , the utilitarian aggregation with swap distance by Pascual et al. . For each of these specific CDO domains we use the translation given in Section 4.1. Given Lemma 1, we show that the max rule with cardinality satisfaction measure by Talmon and Faliszewski  is an instance of ℛsimples​u​msubscriptsuperscriptℛ𝑠𝑢𝑚simple\\mathcal{R}^{{sum}}_{{\\textbf{{simple}}}} as it is equivalent to the median rule. Both rules maximise the satisfaction of voters by counting the number of items approved in the candidate outcome and the ballots. Furthermore, the set of feasible outcomes is equivalent to those candidate outcomes that do not surpass the budget limit. The same holds for the maximum collective spanning tree by Darmann et al.  given its translation, as feasible outcomes correspond to spanning trees. Pascual et al.  showed that their utilitarian aggregation rule with swap distance is equivalent to the Kemeny rule in preference aggregation, which is known to be equivalent to the median rule in judgment aggregation.\n∎ Further, we show that rules from CDO problems are instances of ℛCCs​u​msubscriptsuperscriptℛ𝑠𝑢𝑚CC\\mathcal{R}^{{sum}}_{{\\textbf{{CC}}}}. The Chamberlin-Courant rule for approval ballots by Skowron and Faliszewski [ref]29 and its generalisation to participatory budgeting by Talmon and Faliszewski  are both instances of ℛCCs​u​msubscriptsuperscriptℛ𝑠𝑢𝑚CC\\mathcal{R}^{{sum}}_{{\\textbf{{{CC}}}}}. Talmon and Faliszewski  propose a rule which outputs a set of items maximising the number of ballots with nonempty intersection with the outcome (a special case is the multi-winner variant by Skowron and Faliszewski [ref]29). Both are modeled by ℛCCs​u​msubscriptsuperscriptℛ𝑠𝑢𝑚CC\\mathcal{R}^{{sum}}_{{\\textbf{{CC}}}}, where the sum operator is paired with a set scoring giving each voter a score of one if her ballot shares an item with the outcome (and zero otherwise).\n∎ We now show that four rules introduced in different settings are instances of ℛsimplee​g​a​lsubscriptsuperscriptℛ𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑙simple\\mathcal{R}^{{egal}}_{{\\textbf{{simple}}}}. The following rules are instances of ℛsimplee​g​a​lsubscriptsuperscriptℛ𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑙simple\\mathcal{R}^{{egal}}_{{\\textbf{{simple}}}}: the egalitarian median rule in judgment aggregation (dHsubscript𝑑𝐻d_{H}-max by Lang et al. , or MaxHam by Botan et al. ) the egalitarian aggregation function with swap cost by Pascual et al. , the maximin voter satisfaction problem for approval voting for spanning trees by Darmann et al. , the maximin approval voting rule for multiwinner elections by Brams et al. . The egalitarian median rule is an instance of ℛsimplee​g​a​lsubscriptsuperscriptℛ𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑙simple\\mathcal{R}^{{egal}}_{{\\textbf{{simple}}}} as the functions for both rules are equivalent, given the translation from judgment aggregation to our setting (described in the proof sketch of statement (i) in Lemma 1). The egalitarian aggregation function with swap costs is an instance of ℛsimplee​g​a​lsubscriptsuperscriptℛ𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑙simple\\mathcal{R}^{{egal}}_{{\\textbf{{simple}}}} using the translation in Section 4.1: the rational scheduling ballots are such that each must contains the same number of approvals. For example, an agent must accept exactly one of ap≺qsubscript𝑎precedes𝑝𝑞a_{p\\prec q} and aq≺psubscript𝑎precedes𝑞𝑝a_{q\\prec p}. Subsequently, the swap cost for an agent’s ballot with respect to a candidate outcome differs from the simple set scoring by the same constant factor for each agent. Therefore, maximizing the minimum voters satisfaction yields the same result after translating. The latter rules follows by definition.\n∎ Next we relate our ranked rules with known participatory budgeting rules. The greedy rule with cardinality satisfaction measure by Talmon and Faliszewski  is an instance of the ranked agenda rule (ℛsimpler​a​n​ksubscriptsuperscriptℛ𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘simple\\mathcal{R}^{{rank}}_{{\\textbf{{simple}}}}), and the greedy rule with the generalised Chamberlin-Courant satisfaction measure by Talmon and Faliszewski  is an instance of ℛCCr​a​n​ksubscriptsuperscriptℛ𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘CC\\mathcal{R}^{{rank}}_{{\\textbf{{CC}}}}. It is easy to see that the rank operator behaves in the same way as their greedy rule, adding the item which increases the score (satisfaction measure) the most while not breaking the feasibility constraints (surpassing the budget limit). Furthermore, the cardinality satisfaction measure and the simple set scoring give the same outcome for every input. Therefore, the greedy rule with cardinality satisfaction measure by Talmon and Faliszewski  is an instance of ℛsimpler​a​n​ksubscriptsuperscriptℛ𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘simple\\mathcal{R}^{{rank}}_{{\\textbf{{simple}}}}. Moreover, since CC and the Chamberlin-Courant satisfaction measure assign the same score in the same situations, the last two rules in the statement will also give the same outcomes.\n∎\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: that rules from CDO problems are instances of ℛCCs​u​msubscriptsuperscriptℛ𝑠𝑢𝑚CC\\mathcal{R}^{{sum}}_{{\\textbf{{CC}}}}.
