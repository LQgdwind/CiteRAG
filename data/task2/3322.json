The Ideal Membership Problem (IMP for short) is an important algebraic framework that has been instrumental in such an approach. The IMP underlies many proof systems based on polynomials such as Nullstellensatz, Polynomial Calculus, and Sum-of-Squares, and therefore plays an important role in such areas as proof complexity and approximation. Let 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} be a field and 𝔽​[x1,…,xn]𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}] the ring of polynomials over 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F}. Given polynomials f0subscript𝑓0f_{0}, f1,…,fk∈𝔽​[x1,…,xn]subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑘𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛f_{1},\\dots,f_{k}\\in\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}] the IMP asks if f0subscript𝑓0f_{0} belongs to the ideal ⟨f1,…,fk⟩subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑘\\langle f_{1},\\dots,f_{k}\\rangle generated by f1,…,fksubscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑘f_{1},\\dots,f_{k}. This fact is usually demonstrated by presenting a proof, that is, a collection of polynomials h1,…,hksubscriptℎ1…subscriptℎ𝑘h_{1},\\dots,h_{k} such that the following polynomial identity holds f0=h1​f1+⋯+hk​fksubscript𝑓0subscriptℎ1subscript𝑓1⋯subscriptℎ𝑘subscript𝑓𝑘f_{0}=h_{1}f_{1}+\\dots+h_{k}f_{k}. Many applications require the ability to produce such a proof. We refer to the problem of finding a proof of membership as the search IMP. Note that by the Hilbert Basis Theorem any ideal of 𝔽​[x1,…,xn]𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}] can be represented by a finite set of generators meaning that the above formulation of the problem covers all possible ideals of 𝔽​[x1,…,xn]𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}]. The general IMP is a difficult problem and it is not even obvious whether or not it is decidable. The decidability was established in   . Then Mayr and Meyer  were the first to study the complexity of the IMP. They proved an exponential space lower bound for the membership problem for ideals generated by polynomials with integer and rational coefficients. Mayer  went on establishing an exponential space upper bound for the IMP for ideals over ℚℚ\\mathbb{Q}, thus proving that such IMPs are EXPSPACE-complete. The source of hardness here is that a proof that f0∈⟨P⟩subscript𝑓0delimited-⟨⟩𝑃f_{0}\\in\\langle P\\rangle may require polynomials of exponential degree. In the cases when the degree of a proof has a linear bound in the degree of f0subscript𝑓0f_{0}, the IMP can be solved efficiently. (There is also the issue of exponentially long coefficients that we will mention later.) To illustrate the connection of the IMP to combinatorial problem we consider the following simple example. We claim that the graph in Fig. 1 is 2-colorable if and only if polynomials have a common zero. Indeed, denoting the two possible colors 0 and 1, the first three polynomials guarantee that the only zeroes this collection of polynomials can have are such that x,y,z∈{0,1}𝑥𝑦𝑧01x,y,z\\in\\{0,1\\}. Then the last three polynomials make sure that in every common zero the values of x,y,z𝑥𝑦𝑧x,y,z are pairwise different, and so correspond to a proper coloring of the graph. Of course, the graph in the picture is not 2-colorable, and by the Weak Nullstellensatz this is so if and only if the constant polynomial 1 belongs to the ideal generated by the polynomials above. A proof of that can be easily found The example above exploits the connection between polynomial ideals and sets of zeroes of polynomials, also known as affine varieties. While this connection does not necessarily holds in the general case, as Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz requires certain additional properties of ideals, it works for so called combinatorial ideals that arise from the majority of combinatorial problems similar to the example above. The varieties corresponding to combinatorial ideals are finite, and the ideals themselves are zero-dimensional and radical. These properties make the IMP significantly easier, in particular, it can be solved in single exponential time . Also, Hilbert’s Strong Nullstellensatz holds in this case, which means that if the IMP is restricted to radical ideals, it is equivalent to (negation of) the question: given f0,f1,…,fksubscript𝑓0subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑘f_{0},f_{1},\\dots,f_{k} does there exists a zero of f1,…,fksubscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑘f_{1},\\dots,f_{k} that is not a zero of f0subscript𝑓0f_{0}. The special case of the IMP with f0=1subscript𝑓01f_{0}=1 has been studied for combinatorial problems in the context of lower bounds on Polynomial Calculus and Nullstellensatz proofs, see e.g.   . A broader approach of using polynomials to represent finite-domain constraints has been explored in  [ref]26. Clegg et al., , discuss a propositional proof system based on a bounded degree version of Buchberger’s algorithm [ref]9 for finding proofs of unsatisfiability. Jefferson et al., [ref]26 use a modified form of Buchberger’s algorithm that can be used to achieve the same benefits as the local-consistency algorithms which are widely used in constraint processing. The bit complexity of various (semi)algebraic proof systems is another link that connects approximation algorithms and the IMP. As is easily seen, if the degree of polynomials h1,…,hksubscriptℎ1…subscriptℎ𝑘h_{1},\\dots,h_{k} in a proof f0=h1​f1+⋯+hk​fksubscript𝑓0subscriptℎ1subscript𝑓1⋯subscriptℎ𝑘subscript𝑓𝑘f_{0}=h_{1}f_{1}+\\dots+h_{k}f_{k} is bounded, their coefficients can be found by representing this identity through a system of linear equations. A similar approach is used in other (semi)algebraic proof systems such as Sum-of-Squares (SOS), in which bounded degree proofs can be expressed through an SDP program. Thus, if in addition to low degree the system of linear equations or the SDP program has a solution that can be represented with a polynomial number of bits (thus having low bit complexity), a proof can be efficiently found. However, O’Donnell [ref]30 proved that low degree of proofs does not necessarily imply its low bit complexity. He presented a collection of polynomials that admit bounded degree SOS proofs of nonnegativity, all such proofs involve polynomials with coefficients of exponential length. This means that the standard methods of solving SDPs such as the Ellipsoid Method would take exponential time to complete. Raghavendra and Weitz  suggested some sufficient conditions on combinatorial ideals that guarantee a low bit complexity SOS proof exists whenever a low degree one does. Two of these conditions hold for the majority of combinatorial problems, and the third one is so-called k𝑘k-effectiveness of the IMP part of the proof. Bulatov and Rafiey  showed that for problems where the IMP part is of the form IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) (to be introduced shortly) only one of the first two conditions remains somewhat nontrivial and k𝑘k-effectiveness is no longer required, as well. In this paper we consider IMPs that arise from a specific class of combinatorial problems, the Constraint Satisfaction Problem or the CSP for short. In a CSP we are given a set of variables, and a collection of constraints on the values that variables are allowed to be assigned simultaneously. The question in a CSP is whether there is an assignment to variables that satisfies all the constraints. The CSP provides a general framework for a wide variety of combinatorial problems, and it is therefore very natural to study the IMPs that arise from constraint satisfaction problems. Following [ref]26  , every CSP can be associated with a polynomial ideal. Let CSP 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} be given on variables x1,…,xnsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛x_{1},\\dots,x_{n} that can take values from a set D={0,…,d−1}𝐷0…𝑑1D=\\{0,\\dots,d-1\\}. The ideal I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}) of 𝔽​[x1,…,xn]𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}] (𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} is supposed to contain D𝐷D, and is therefore usually is considered to be a numerical field) whose corresponding variety equals the set of solutions of 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} is constructed as follows. First, for every xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} the ideal I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}) contains a domain polynomial fD​(xi)subscript𝑓𝐷subscript𝑥𝑖f_{D}(x_{i}) whose zeroes are precisely the elements of D𝐷D. Then for every constraint R​(xi1,…,xik)𝑅subscript𝑥subscript𝑖1…subscript𝑥subscript𝑖𝑘R(x_{i_{1}},\\dots,x_{i_{k}}), where R𝑅R is a predicate on D𝐷D, the ideal I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}) contains a polynomial fR​(xi1,…,xik)subscript𝑓𝑅subscript𝑥subscript𝑖1…subscript𝑥subscript𝑖𝑘f_{R}(x_{i_{1}},\\dots,x_{i_{k}}) that interpolates R𝑅R, that is, for (xi1,…,xik)∈Dksubscript𝑥subscript𝑖1…subscript𝑥subscript𝑖𝑘superscript𝐷𝑘(x_{i_{1}},\\dots,x_{i_{k}})\\in D^{k} it holds fR​(xi1,…,xik)=0subscript𝑓𝑅subscript𝑥subscript𝑖1…subscript𝑥subscript𝑖𝑘0f_{R}(x_{i_{1}},\\dots,x_{i_{k}})=0 if and only if R​(xi1,…,xik)𝑅subscript𝑥subscript𝑖1…subscript𝑥subscript𝑖𝑘R(x_{i_{1}},\\dots,x_{i_{k}}) is true. This model generalizes a number of constructions used in the literature to apply Nullstellensatz or SOS  proof systems to combinatorial problems, see, e.g.,    . One of the major research directions in the CSP research is the study of CSPs in which the allowed types of constraints are restricted. Such restrictions are usually represented by a constraint language that is a set of relations or predicates on a fixed set. The CSP parametrized by a constraint language ΓΓ\\Gamma is denoted CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma). Mastrolilli in  initiated a systematic study of IMPs that arise from problems of the form CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma), denoted IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma). More precisely, for a constraint language ΓΓ\\Gamma over domain D={0,…,d−1}⊆𝔽𝐷0…𝑑1𝔽D=\\{0,\\dots,d-1\\}\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}, in an instance of IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) we are given an instance 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) with set of variables X={x1,…,xn}𝑋subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛X=\\{x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}\\}, and a polynomial f0∈𝔽​[x1,…,xn]subscript𝑓0𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛f_{0}\\in\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}]. The question is whether or not f0subscript𝑓0f_{0} belongs to I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}). Observe, that using Hilbert’s Strong Nullstellensatz the problem can also be reformulated as, whether there exists a solution to 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} that is not a zero of f0subscript𝑓0f_{0}. Sometimes we need to restrict the degree of the input polynomial, the IMP in which the degree of f0subscript𝑓0f_{0} is bounded by d𝑑d is denoted by IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma). The main research question considered in  is to classify the problems IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) according to their complexity. Since the only solution algorithm for IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) available at that point was generating a Gröbner basis,  stated the main research problem in a different way: For which constraint languages ΓΓ\\Gamma a Gröbner basis of I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}) can be constructed in polynomial time for every instance 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma)? Bulatov and Rafiey  showed that the two questions are actually equivalent in all known cases. We will return to this issue later. Mastrolilli  along with Mastrolilli and Bharathi  succeeded in characterizing the complexity of IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) for constraint languages ΓΓ\\Gamma over a 2-element domain. Their results are best presented using the language of polymorphisms. Recall that a polymorphism of a constraint language ΓΓ\\Gamma over a set D𝐷D is a multi-ary operation on D𝐷D that can be viewed as a multi-dimensional symmetry of relations from ΓΓ\\Gamma. By Pol​(Γ)PolΓ\\textsf{Pol}(\\Gamma) we denote the set of all polymorphisms of ΓΓ\\Gamma. As in the case of the CSP, polymorphisms of ΓΓ\\Gamma is what determines the complexity of IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma), see . For the purpose of this paper we mention three types of polymorphisms. Two of them are given by equations they satisfy. A semilattice operation is a binary operation f𝑓f that satisfies the equations of idempotency f​(x,x)=x𝑓𝑥𝑥𝑥f(x,x)=x, commutativity f​(x,y)=f​(y,x)𝑓𝑥𝑦𝑓𝑦𝑥f(x,y)=f(y,x), and associativity f​(x,f​(y,z))=f​(f​(x,y),z)𝑓𝑥𝑓𝑦𝑧𝑓𝑓𝑥𝑦𝑧f(x,f(y,z))=f(f(x,y),z). A majority operation is a ternary operation g𝑔g that satisfies the equations g​(x,x,y)=g​(x,y,x)=g​(y,x,x)=x𝑔𝑥𝑥𝑦𝑔𝑥𝑦𝑥𝑔𝑦𝑥𝑥𝑥g(x,x,y)=g(x,y,x)=g(y,x,x)=x. An important example of a majority operation is the dual-discriminator given by g​(x,y,z)=x𝑔𝑥𝑦𝑧𝑥g(x,y,z)=x unless y=z𝑦𝑧y=z, in which case g​(x,y,z)=y𝑔𝑥𝑦𝑧𝑦g(x,y,z)=y. Finally, for an Abelian group 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} the operation h​(x,y,z)=x−y+zℎ𝑥𝑦𝑧𝑥𝑦𝑧h(x,y,z)=x-y+z of 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} is called the affine operation of 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A}. Let ΓΓ\\Gamma be a constraint language over D={0,1}𝐷01D=\\{0,1\\} and such that the constant relations R0,R1∈Γsubscript𝑅0subscript𝑅1ΓR_{0},R_{1}\\in\\Gamma, where Ri={(i)}subscript𝑅𝑖𝑖R_{i}=\\{(i)\\}. Then If ΓΓ\\Gamma is invariant under a semilattice or affine operation (of ℤ2subscriptℤ2\\mathbb{Z}_{2}) then IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) is polynomial time for any d𝑑d. If ΓΓ\\Gamma is invariant under a majority polymorphism, IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) is polynomial time. Otherwise IMP0​(Γ)subscriptIMP0Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{0}(\\Gamma) is coNP-complete. Theorem 1.1 has been improved in  by showing that IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) remains polynomial time when ΓΓ\\Gamma has an arbitrary semilattice polymorphism, not only on a 2-element set, an arbitrary dual-discriminator polymorphism, or an affine polymorphism of ℤpsubscriptℤ𝑝\\mathbb{Z}_{p}, p𝑝p prime. The IMP is mostly solved using one of the two methods. The first one is the method of finding an IMP or SOS proofs of bounded degree using systems of linear equations or SDP programs. The other approach uses the standard polynomial division to verify whether a given polynomial has zero remainder when divided by generators of an ideal: if this is the case, the polynomial belongs to the ideal. Unfortunately the ring 𝔽​[x1,…,xn]𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}] is not Eucledian, which means that the result of division depends on the order in which division is performed. To avoid this complication, one may construct a Gröbner basis of the ideal that guarantees that the division algorithm always produces a definitive answer to the IMP. However, constructing a Gröbner basis is not always feasible, as even though the original generating set is small, the corresponding Gröbner basis may be huge. Even if there is an efficient way to construct a Gröbner basis, the algorithm may be quite involved and tends to work only in a limited number of cases. A more sophisticated approach was suggested in . It involves reductions between problems of the form IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) before arriving to one for which a Gröbner basis can be constructed in a relatively simple way. Moreover,  also introduces a slightly different form of the IMP, called the χ𝜒\\chiIMP, in which the input polynomial has indeterminates as some of its coefficients, and the problem is to find values for those indeterminates (if they exist) such that the resulting polynomial belongs to the given ideal. They showed that χ𝜒\\chiIMP is solvable in polynomial time for every known case of polynomial time solvable IMP, and that χ𝜒\\chiIMP helps to solve the search version of the IMP. If ΓΓ\\Gamma has a semilattice, dual-discriminator, or the affine polymorphism of ℤpsubscriptℤ𝑝\\mathbb{Z}_{p}, p𝑝p prime, then χ​IMPd​(Γ)𝜒subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\chi\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) is solvable in polynomial time for every d𝑑d. If χ​IMPd​(Γ)𝜒subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\chi\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) is polynomial time solvable then for every instance 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) a Gröbner basis of I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}) can be found in polynomial time.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: in the context of lower bounds on Polynomial Calculus and Nullstellensatz proofs, see e.g.   .
