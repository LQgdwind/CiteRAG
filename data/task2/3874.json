      "content": "Paper Title: Episodic Memory Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuestion-Answering in Embodied Environments.\nTraining embodied agents to answer questions grounded in indoor environments has been the subject of several prior works. Specifically,   present agents that can answer questions about a single and multiple target objects in simulated scenes, respectively.  presents an instantiation of this line of work to photorealistic scenes from the Matterport3D simulator and 3D point cloud based inputs whereas 5 presents an extension of the task that requires the agent to interact with its environment. In all of the above, the agents are setup to carry out each question-answering episode with a ”clean-slate” i.e. with no avenues for the agent to potentially re-use scene information gathered during prior traversals of the same scene. Although the agent in 5 has a semantic spatial memory storing information about object semantics and free space, it is not persistent across different question-episodes from the same scene. Moreover, all prior work involves generating a ranked list of language answer tokens as predictions. Our task formulation allows for the sharing of a semantic scene memory that is persistent across the different questions from a scene and localizes answers to questions – a much more high-fidelity setting for egocentric AI assistants. Video Question Answering.\nOur work is also reminiscent of video question-answering (VideoQA) tasks. VideoQA has witnessed a rich history of prior work with the introduction of datasets sampled from ”open-world” domains (movies , TV shows , cooking recipes  ) and tasks involving detecting/localizing actions and answering questions about events that transpire in the videos. Our EMQA dataset instead, comprises of egocentric videos generated from navigation trajectories in indoor environments. In addition to localization within the input video sequence, this setting enables additional output modalities, such as grounding over scene floor-plans, that are incompatible with existing VideoQA domains. Moreover, existing VideoQA datasets are accompanied with rich, per-frame annotations such as subtitles, plot scripts and other sub-event metadata. In contrast, EMQA assumes no such additional annotations.  is concurrent with our work and proposes a large-scale dataset of egocentric videos paired with 3D meshes of environments in which the recorded activities took place. Localization via Dialog.   present a task wherein an entity having access to the top-down floorplan of an environment needs to localize an agent (on the top-down map) navigating within a scene through first-person vision alone. Both assume that the top-down floorplan of the scene is provided to the agent as input whereas our model constructs the map representation from scratch from the guided tours. Scene Memory Representations.\nBuilding representations of scenes for assisting agents in embodied tasks has a rich history of prior work with early examples adopting the hidden state of an LSTM navigation model as a compact representation of the scene  . To overcome the limited expressive power of a single state vector representing complex, 3D scenes, more recent approaches have modelled scene memories as either a buffer of observed egocentric features  , 2D metric grids [ref]5   , topological maps  4 or full-scale 3D semantic maps 1 [ref]8 . Storing observed egocentric features in a buffer does not explicitly model the geometric and spatial relationships among objects in the scene. Topological graphs are not optimal for precise metric localization (a desideratum for our task). The memory constraints involved with constructing voxel-based 3D scene representations restricts the feature maps proposed in 1 [ref]8 to simple scenes (handful of objects placed on a table-top). On the contrary, our task deals with indoor environments of significantly higher visual complexity. Our scene memory (allocentric, top-down semantic feature map) is most similar to [ref]5. We present a novel extension to the scene features from [ref]5 by incorporating temporal information with the semantic features (“when” was “what” observed and “where”).\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: expressive power of a single state vector representing complex, 3D scenes, more recent approaches have modelled scene memories as either a buffer of observed egocentric features  , 2D metric grids [ref]5   , topological maps  4 or full-scale 3D semantic maps 1 [ref]8 .
