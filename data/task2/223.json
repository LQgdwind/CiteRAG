For the case at hand, we look at methods that use HTG or similar approaches to learn augmentation of the handwritten examples.\nOne straightforward example of this is a method proposed by Bhunia et al. , who trains a GAN to warp the training set using a parametric function. Unlike ours, this approach cannot generate words outside a given lexicon, which is a crucial property as we show below (see Table 3).\nKrishanan el al. [ref]28 proposed a method to harness synthetic data for word spotting, while not relying on a specific source of synthetic data (e.g. can use data made by our method). Alonso et al. [ref]2 presented a new HTG model reminiscent of the work in , which in turn inspired our approach.\nThe network presented in [ref]2 uses LSTM to embed the input word into a fixed length representation which can be fed into a BigGAN [ref]8 architecture.\nAs opposed to our approach, which allows for variable word and image length, this generator is only able to output images of a fixed width across all word lengths.\nAnother large benefit of using a fully convolutional generator is removing the need to learn an embedding of the entire word using a recurrent network, we instead can learn the embeddings for each character directly without the need for character level annotation. Another recent approach by Ingle et al.  uses an online generator similar to , followed by rendering. This approach is coupled with some synthetic generation of noise or other nuisance factors. Since this method relies on an online data generator, it cannot adapt to the versatility nor typical noise of an unseen offline dataset, which we claim is the common use case.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: the training set using a parametric function. Unlike ours, this approach cannot generate words outside a given lexicon, which is a crucial property as we show below (see Table 3).\nKrishanan el al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
