      "content": "Paper Title: On the Overlooked Pitfalls of Weight Decay and How to Mitigate Them: A Gradient-Norm Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we first empirically verify that weight decay indeed affects gradient norms and further conducted comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SWD scheduler in mitigating large gradient norms and boosting performance. Models and Datasets. We train various neural networks, including ResNet18/34/50 , VGG16 [ref]37, DenseNet121 [ref]19, GoogLeNet , and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) , on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100 , ImageNet, and Penn TreeBank . The optimizers include popular Adam variants, including AMSGrad , Yogi , AdaBound , Padam , and RAdam . See Appendix B and C for more details and results. Minima sharpness. Previous studies  7     reported that the minima sharpness measured by the Hessian positively correlate to the gradient norm. Note that a number of popular minima sharpness depends on the Hessian at minima . In Figures 6 and 8, we visualize the top Hessian eigenvalues to measure the minima sharpness. Figure 6 shows that stronger weight decay leads to sharper minima. Figure 8 suggests that AdamS learns significantly flatter minima than AdamW. Both large gradient norms and sharp minima correspond to high-complexity solutions and often hurts generalization . This is a surprising finding for weight decay given the conventional belief that weight decay as a regularization technique should encourage low-complexity solutions. Generalization. Figure 9 shows the learning curves of AdamS, AdamW, and Adam on several benchmarks. In our experiments, AdamS always leads to lower test errors. Figure 19 in Appendix shows that, even if with similar or higher training losses, AdamS still generalizes significantly better than AdamW, Adam, and recent Adam variants. Figure 8 displays the learning curves of all adaptive gradient methods. The test performance of other models can be found in Table 1. The results on ImageNet (See Figure 18 in Appendix) shows that, AdamS can also make improvements over AdamW. Simply scheduling weight decay for Adam by SWD even outperforms complex Adam variants. We report that most Adam variants surprisingly generalize worse than SGD (See Appendix C). The Robustness of SWD. Figure 11 shows that AdamS is more robust to the learning rate and weight decay than AdamW and Adam. AdamS has a much deeper and wider basin than AdamW and Adam. Figure 10 further demonstrates that AdamS consistently outperforms Adam and AdamW under various weight decay hyperparameters. According to Figure 10, we also notice that the optimal decoupled weight decay hyperparameter in AdamW can be very different from L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} regularization and SWD. Thus, AdamW requires re-tuning the weight decay hyperparameter in practice, which is time-consuming. The robustness of selecting hyperparameters can be supported by Figure 6, where the proposed scheduler also depends on the initial weight decay strength. It means that the proposed gradient-norm-aware scheduler exhibit the behavior of negative feedback to stabilize the strength of weight decay during training. Cosine learning rate schedulers and warm restarts. We conducted comparative experiments on AdamS, AdamW, and Adam in the presence of cosine annealing schedulers and warm restarts proposed by Loshchilov and Hutter, [ref]31. We set the learning rate scheduler with a recommended setting of Loshchilov and Hutter, [ref]31. Our experimental results in Figure 12 suggest that AdamS consistently outperforms AdamW and Adam in terms of both training losses and test errors. It demonstrates that, with complex learning rate schedulers, the advantage of SWD still holds. Limitations. While the proposed scheduler boosts weight decay in most experiments, the improvement of SWD may be limited sometimes. SWD does not work well particularly when L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} regularization even yields better test results than weight decay (See the experiments on Language Modeling Figure 13 in Appendix C). Our paper does not touch the pitfall of L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} regularization and how to schedule its strength. We leave scheduling L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} regularization as future work.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: the effectiveness of the SWD scheduler in mitigating large gradient norms and boosting performance.
