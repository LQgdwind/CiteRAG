      "content": "Paper Title: Data Streaming and Traffic Gathering in Mesh-based NoC for Deep Neural Network Acceleration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare the proposed method and repetitive unicast method in terms of the runtime latency and power consumption. We assume that there is a higher level entity or a mapping framework similar to [ref]16   [ref]26  exists that does the task of mapping neurons to the PEs, controlling timing for better synchronization without stalls, so that our focus is on evaluating the performance of the on-chip network. In order to fully utilize the spatial PE arrays, the parameters obtained from Pytorch framework  are used to model the traces for the NoC. PEs represent the neurons that are organized in a 2D mesh. The total neurons in each layer are divided to fit the PEs in a mesh. Assume that memory elements (global memory) are located on the north, east, and west sides of the network. Each PE receives the input activation and filter weights from the streaming units on the north and east sides of the mesh, respectively. Accumulation happens locally to generate the partial sums, which are then collected from the left side to the global buffer at the right side of the mesh. The output feature map of the current layer is completely generated before moving ahead with another layer. A cycle-accurate C++ based NoC simulator  is used to simulate the generated traces for Alexnet [ref]4 and VGG-16 . Orion 3.0  is used to estimate the power consumption for NoC, and DSENT  is used to estimate the power consumption for the streaming bus. Simulations are performed on 8x8 and 16x16 2D mesh networks. Table I shows the NoC setting used for performance analysis. As the number of PEs/router increases, the gather payload also increases. To accommodate these gather payloads, we can either use a fixed number of flits or a dynamic flit size per gather packet. For the DNN workload, each node in the same row will generate a prefix sum result. Hence, a fixed number of flits is chosen for our experiments, which avoids the extra overhead in router design if a dynamic flit size is used. For 1,2,4,8 PEs/router, the gather packet size is set as 3,5,9,17 flits/packet by default, respectively. This flit size is enough to collect all the gather payloads for an 8x8 network; however, for a 16x16 NoC, two gather packets are needed, as the first one will be full halfway to the global memory.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: We compare the proposed method and repetitive unicast method in terms of the runtime latency and power consumption.
