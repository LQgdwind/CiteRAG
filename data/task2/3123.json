      "content": "Paper Title: SegDiff: Image Segmentation with Diffusion Probabilistic Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDiffusion methods, which iteratively improve a given image, obtain image quality that is on par with or better than other types of generative models, including other forms of log-likelihood models and adversarial models¬†[ref]10 . Such methods have been shown to excel in many generation tasks, both conditional and unconditional. The vast majority of diffusion models are applied in domains in which there is no absolute ground truth result and the output is evaluated either through a user study or using several quality and diversity scores. As far as we know, with the exception of super resolution¬† 1 [ref]27, diffusion models have not been applied to problems in which the ground truth result is unique. In this work, we tackle the problem of image segmentation. This problem is a cornerstone of both classical computer vision and the deep learning methods of the last decade. The leading methods in the field employ encoder-decoder networks of varied architectures¬†     . While adversarial methods have been attempted¬† 9  , they do not constitute the current state of the art. Therefore, it is uncertain whether diffusion models, which have been used primarily for GAN-like generation tasks, would be competitive in this domain. In this work, we propose applying a diffusion model to learn the image segmentation map. Unlike other recent improvements in the field of image segmentation¬†4  , we train our method end-to-end, without relying on a pre-trained backbone network. The diffusion model employs a denoising network conditioned on the input image only through a sum in which this information is aggregated with information arising from the current estimate xtsubscriptùë•ùë°x_{t}. Specifically, the input image IùêºI and the current estimate xtsubscriptùë•ùë°x_{t} of the binary segmentation map are passed through two different encoders, and the sum of these multi-channel tensors is passed through a U-Net¬† to provide the next estimate xt‚àí1subscriptùë•ùë°1x_{t-1}. Since the generation process is stochastic in its nature, one may obtain multiple solutions. As we show, merging these solutions, by simply averaging multiple runs, leads to an improvement in overall accuracy. The novel method presented produces state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks: Cityscapes¬†, building segmentation¬†, and nuclei segmentation¬† . Our main contributions are: We are the first to apply diffusion models to the image segmentation problem. We propose a new way to condition the model on the input image. We introduce the concept of multiple generations, in order to improve performance and calibration of the diffusion model. We obtained state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks. The margin is especially large for small data sets.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: iteratively improve a given image, obtain image quality that is on par with or better than other types of generative models, including other forms of log-likelihood models and adversarial models¬†[ref]10 .
