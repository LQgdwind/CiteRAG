      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Graph Transformer with Adaptive Node Sampling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, the Transformer architecture 3 and its variants (e.g., Bert [ref]7 and ViT [ref]8) have achieved unprecedented successes in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). In light of the superior performance of Transformer, some recent works   attempt to generalize Transformer for graph data by treating each node as a token and designing dedicated positional encoding. However, most of these works only focus on small graphs such as molecular graphs with tens of atoms . For instance, Graphormer  achieves state-of-the-art performance on molecular property prediction tasks. When it comes to large graphs, the quadratic computational and storage complexity of the vanilla Transformer with the number of nodes inhibits the practical application. Although some Sparse Transformer methods    can improve the efficiency of the vanilla Transformer, they have not\nexploited the unique characteristics of graph data and require a quadratic or at least sub-quadratic\nspace complexity, which is still unaffordable in most practical cases. Moreover, the full-attention mechanism\npotentially introduces noise from numerous irrelevant nodes in the full graph. To generalize Transformer to large graphs, existing Transformer-based methods   [ref]7 on graphs explicitly or implicitly restrict each node‚Äôs receptive field to\nreduce the computational and storage complexity. For example, Graph-Bert  restricts the receptive field of each node to the nodes with top-kùëòk intimacy scores such as Personalized PageRank (PPR). GT-Sparse  only considers 1-hop neighboring nodes. We argue that existing Graph Transformers have the following deficiencies: (1) The fixed node sampling strategies in existing Graph Transformers are ignorant of the graph properties, which may sample uninformative nodes for attention. Therefore, an adaptive node sampling strategy aware of the graph properties is needed. We conduct case studies in Section 4 to support our arguments. (2) Though the sampling method enables scalability, most node sampling strategies focus on local neighbors and neglect the long-range dependencies and global contexts of graphs. Hence, incorporating complementary global information is necessary for Graph Transformer. To solve the challenge (1), we propose Adaptive Node Sampling for Graph Transformer (ANS-GT) and formulate the optimization strategy of node sampling in Graph Transformer as an adversary bandit problem. Specifically in ANS-GT, we modify Exp4.P method  to adaptively assign weights to several chosen sampling heuristics (e.g., 1-hop neighbors, 2-hop neighbors, PPR) and combine these sampling strategies to sample informative nodes.\nThe reward is proportional to the attention weights and the sampling probabilities of nodes, i.e. the reward to a certain sampling heuristic is higher if the sampling probability distribution and the node attention weights distribution are more similar. Then in the training process of Graph Transformer, the node sampling strategy is updated simultaneously to sample more informative nodes. With more informative nodes input into the self-attention module, ANS-GT can achieve better performance. To tackle the challenge (2), we propose a hierarchical attention scheme for Graph Transformer to encode both local and global information for each node. The hierarchical attention scheme consists of fine-grained local attention and coarse-grained global attention. In the local attention, we use the aforementioned adaptive node sampling strategy to select informative local nodes for attention. As for global attention, we first use graph coarsening algorithms 6 to pre-process the input graph and generate a coarse graph. Such algorithms mimic a down-sampling of the original graph via grouping the nodes into super-nodes while preserving global graph information as much as possible. The center nodes then interact with the sampled super-nodes. Such coarse-grained global attention helps each node capture long-distance dependencies while reducing the computational complexity of the vanilla Graph Transformers. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to show the effectiveness of ANS-GT. Our method outperforms all the existing Graph Transformer architectures and obtains state-of-the-art results on 6 benchmark datasets. Detailed analysis and ablation studies further show the superiority of the adaptive node sampling module and the hierarchical attention scheme. In summary, we make the following contributions: We propose Adaptive Node Sampling for Graph Transformer (ANS-GT), which modifies a multi-armed bandit algorithm to adaptively sample nodes for attention. In the hierarchical attention scheme, we introduce coarse-grained global attention with graph coarsening, which helps graph transformer capture long-range dependencies while increasing efficiency. We empirically evaluate our method on six benchmark datasets to show the advantage over existing Graph Transformers and popular GNNs.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: In recent years, the Transformer architecture 3 and its variants (e.g., Bert [ref]7 and ViT [ref]8) have achieved unprecedented successes in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV).
