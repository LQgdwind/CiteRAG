      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive Neural-Operator Backstepping Control of a Benchmark Hyperbolic PDE\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe first investigations into backstepping-based adaptive control of PDEs were introduced for reaction-diffusion PDEs. Initially, a set of three approaches extending the simpler ODE counterparts were introduced: a Lyapunov approach , a passive identification approach where one constructs an observer-like PDE system to estimate the plant parameter , and a swapping identifier where filters are introduced for the measurement to create a prediction error which can be minimized via standard techniques such as gradient descent . Papers ,  then extended these techniques to adaptive control for systems with unknown delays in ODEs, and to wave PDEs. This paved the way for a swapping-based output-feedback extension to a single hyperbolic PDE [ref]4, and then to extensions to systems of hyperbolic PDES , , . Further, 2 expanded the direction introduced by  into a series of works on adaptive control of delay-systems. Concurrently, many works explored adaptive backstepping for different systems including coupled hyperbolic PDEs in 0, coupled hyperbolic PDE-PDE-ODE systems in 6, and the wave equation in 5. Lastly, we briefly mention the more recent works in adaptive control expanding into distributed input systems with unknown delays 9 and event-triggered adaptive control of coupled hyperbolic PDEs 3, 4, 0.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: extended these techniques to adaptive control for systems with unknown delays in ODEs, and to wave PDEs.
