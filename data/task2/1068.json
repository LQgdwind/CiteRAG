      "content": "Paper Title: Rethinking pooling in graph neural networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe success of graph neural networks (GNNs)¬† 6 in many domains¬†      is due to their ability to extract meaningful representations from graph-structured data.\nSimilarly to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a typical GNN sequentially combines local filtering, non-linearity, and (possibly) pooling operations to obtain refined graph representations at each layer.\nWhereas the convolutional filters capture local regularities in the input graph, the interleaved pooling operations reduce the graph representation while ideally preserving important structural information. Although strategies for graph pooling come in many flavors¬†0  [ref]26 , most GNNs follow a hierarchical scheme in which the pooling regions correspond to graph clusters that, in turn, are combined to produce a coarser graph¬†[ref]4     .\nIntuitively, these clusters generalize the notion of local neighborhood exploited in traditional CNNs and allow for pooling graphs of varying sizes.\nThe cluster assignments can be obtained via deterministic clustering algorithms¬†[ref]4  or be learned in an end-to-end fashion¬† .\nAlso, one can leverage node embeddings¬†, graph topology¬†, or both¬† , to pool graphs.\nWe refer to these approaches as local pooling. Together with attention-based mechanisms¬†[ref]26 , the notion that clustering is a must-have property of graph pooling has been tremendously influential, resulting in an ever-increasing number of pooling schemes¬†    .\nImplicit in any pooling approach is the belief that the quality of the cluster assignments is crucial for GNNs performance.\nNonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, this belief has not been rigorously evaluated. Misconceptions not only hinder new advances but also may lead to unnecessary complexity and obfuscate interpretability. This is particularly critical in graph representation learning, as we have seen a clear trend towards simplified GNNs\n¬†  [ref]11  1. In this paper, we study the extent to which local pooling plays a role in GNNs.\nIn particular, we choose representative models that are popular or claim to achieve state-of-the-art performances and simplify their pooling operators by eliminating any clustering-enforcing component.\nWe either apply randomized cluster assignments or operate on complementary graphs.\nSurprisingly, the empirical results show that the non-local GNN variants exhibit comparable, if not superior, performance to the original methods in all experiments. To understand our findings, we design new experiments to evaluate the interplay between convolutional layers and pooling; and analyze the learned embeddings.\nWe show that graph coarsening in both the original methods and our simplifications lead to homogeneous embeddings.\nThis is because successful GNNs usually learn low-pass filters at early convolutional stages.\nConsequently, the specific way in which we combine nodes for pooling becomes less relevant. In a nutshell, the contributions of this paper are: iùëñi) we show that popular and modern representative GNNs do not perform better than simple baselines built upon randomization and non-local pooling; i‚Äãiùëñùëñii) we explain why the simplified GNNs work and analyze the conditions for this to happen; and i‚Äãi‚Äãiùëñùëñùëñiii) we discuss the overall impact of pooling in the design of efficient GNNs. Aware of common misleading evaluation protocols¬† [ref]11, we use benchmarks on which GNNs have proven to beat structure-agnostic baselines.\nWe believe this work presents a sanity-check for local pooling, suggesting that novel pooling schemes should count on more ablation studies to validate their effectiveness.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: graph, the interleaved pooling operations reduce the graph representation while ideally preserving important structural information.
