      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Label Continual Learning using Augmented Graph Convolutional Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCompared with the traditional single-label classification problem, multi-label classification is more practical in the real world.\nEarlier multi-label learning methods  prefer to build the model with the help of extra-label localisation information, which is assumed to include all possible foreground objects. And they aggregate the features from proposals to incorporate local information for multi-label prediction.\nHowever, extra localisation information is costly, preventing the models from applying to end-to-end training approaches.\nMore recent advances are mainly by constructing the label relationships.\nSome works   use the recurrent neural network (RNN) for multi-label recognition under a restrictive assumption that the label relationships are in order, which limits the complex relationships in label space.\nFurthermore, some works  [ref]30  build label relationships using graph structure and use graph convolutional network (GCN) to enhance the representation.\nThe standard limit of these methods is that they can only construct the intra-task correlation matrix using the training data from the current task and fail to capture the inter-task label dependencies in a continual data stream.\nThey rely on prior knowledge to construct the correlation matrix, which is the key of GCN that aims to gain the label dependencies. These methods utilize the information of the whole training dataset to capture the co-occurrence patterns of objects in an offline way.\nSome recent methods focus on the partial label problem    for offline multi-label learning. Compared with this offline way, we construct the correlations and use soft label statistics to solve the partial label problem for MLCL.\nKim et al.   propose to extend the ER [ref]34 algorithm using an improved reservoir sampling strategy to study the imbalanced problem on multi-label datasets.\nHowever, the label dependencies are ignored in this work .\nIn contrast, we propose to model label relationships sequentially in MLCL and consider mitigating the relationship-level forgetting in MLCL.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: network (RNN) for multi-label recognition under a restrictive assumption that the label relationships are in order, which limits the complex relationships in label space.\nFurthermore, some works  [ref]30  build label relationships using graph structure and use graph convolutional network (GCN) to enhance the representation.\nThe standard limit of these methods is that they can only construct\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
