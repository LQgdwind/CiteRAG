      "content": "Paper Title: 1. Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConvergence tests in relative energy-norm error are carried out with three\ndifferent mesh refinement strategies. The first one is uniform hℎh-refinements,\nin pursuance of both exposing the behaviour of AgFEM, in absence of hanging\nnode constraints, and the limited regularity of the Fichera corner problem. The\nremaining two are error-driven; they are distinguished by different optimality\ncriteria on the elemental error indicator γTsubscript𝛾𝑇\\gamma_{T}, for any T∈𝒯h𝑇subscript𝒯ℎT\\in{\\mathcal{T}}_{h}. It is not in the scope of this work to design a posteriori error\nestimation techniques for AgFEM, although there are some works with other\nunfitted FE methods that explore this question .\nHence, since the target problems have known analytical solution, γTsubscript𝛾𝑇\\gamma_{T}\nis taken as the energy norm of the local true error e=u−uh𝑒𝑢subscript𝑢ℎe=u-u_{h}, that is, Error-driven mesh adaptation seeks an optimal mesh with an iterative procedure.\nIn the examples below, optimality is declared when the global absolute\ndiscretisation error, measured in energy norm, ‖e‖asubscriptnorm𝑒𝑎\\|e\\|_{a} is below a\nprescribed quantity γ𝛾\\gamma, i.e. (8) is referred to as the\nacceptability criterion. The process starts with an initial guess of the optimal mesh. After finding the\napproximate solution and the exact cell-wise error distribution, a new mesh is\ndefined with a remeshing strategy. This step consists in comparing each\nγTsubscript𝛾𝑇\\gamma_{T} to a given threshold, commonly known as the optimality\ncriterion, which is later defined. Depending on the result of the comparison, a\ndifferent remeshing flag is assigned to the cell. If γTsubscript𝛾𝑇\\gamma_{T} is above the\nthreshold, T𝑇T is marked for refinement. Otherwise, T𝑇T is left unmarked\nor, optionally, marked for coarsening, when γTsubscript𝛾𝑇\\gamma_{T} falls well below the\nthreshold. Following this, the mesh is transformed, according to the cell-wise\nremeshing flags, and partitioned. Next, a new FE space is created, by\ndistributing DOFs on top of the new mesh and computing the nonconforming\nDOF constraints and, if using 𝒱hagsuperscriptsubscript𝒱ℎag{\\mathcal{V}}_{h}^{\\mathrm{ag}}, also the ill-posed DOF\nconstraints. After FE integration and assembly, the resulting linear system\nis solved and the cell-wise error distribution is updated. If the current mesh\ncomplies with the acceptability criterion of (8),\nthe process is stopped, otherwise it goes back to the application of the\noptimality criterion. As mentioned before, two different optimality criteria (thresholds for\nrefinement) are studiedThe first one, the LB  \ncriterion, establishes that the error distribution in an optimal mesh (denoted\nwith *) is uniform, that is where M∗superscript𝑀M^{*} is the number of cells in the optimal mesh. At each mesh adaptation\nstep, this quantity is estimated as with d𝑑d the space dimension, m𝑚m the degree of the interpolation (in\nsecond-order elliptic problems) and M𝑀M the number of cells of the current\niteration. On the other hand, the OB  criterion\nconsiders that the distribution of error density in an optimal mesh is\nuniform, that is where ΩΩ\\Omega is the measure of the domain and ΩT∗∩ΩsubscriptΩsuperscript𝑇Ω\\Omega_{T^{*}\\cap\\Omega} is\nthe measure of T∗∩Ωsuperscript𝑇ΩT^{*}\\cap\\Omega. While the former criterion has\nbeen proved  to provide standard body-fitted FE meshes\nsatisfying (8) with the least number of\nelements, the latter scales the threshold in terms of the size of the\n(ill-posed) cell. One of the goals of the following experiments is to see how\nboth strategies perform in the context of unfitted FEs. Note that, with\nrespect to standard body-fitted FEM, both remeshing strategies are almost\napplied verbatim to an unfitted FE setting; the only difference being that\nthe local quantities in cut cells are computed in the interior part only, in the\nsame way as for the local integration of the weak form stated in\n(4). Convergence tests with uniform hℎh-refinements follow the usual procedure,\nwhereas error-driven tests are controlled with a finite sequence of decreasing\nerror objectives γisubscript𝛾𝑖\\gamma_{i}, i>1𝑖1i>1. For each i>1𝑖1i>1, the iterative procedure\ndescribed above is carried out to find the mesh that complies with the\nacceptability criterion of (8) with\nγ=γi𝛾subscript𝛾𝑖\\gamma=\\gamma_{i}. If subscript γisubscript𝛾𝑖\\gamma_{i} refers to the quantities obtained at the\nlast mesh iteration, at the end of the procedure we can extract the pair that is, a point of the convergence test curve. Figure 7 depicts\nsome meshes found with this iterative procedure, using the LB\nacceptability criterion. We carry out all convergence tests for a fixed number of threads (MPI tasks). We\nemploy six MN-IV high-memory nodes and map each core to a different MPI task.\nTherefore, the experiments are launched in 6⋅48=288⋅6482886\\cdot 48=288 processors. The\npartition of the mesh considers 288288288 subdomains and is defined to seek an equal\ndistribution of the number of cells among processors (p4est default setting).\nThe well-posedness threshold for aggregation η0subscript𝜂0\\eta_{0} (see\nSection 2.2) is prescribed to 0.250.250.25 in what follows. Let us now start the discussion of the numerical results obtained with\nconvergence tests. As shown in Figure 8 hℎh-AgFEM\nbehaviour consistently mirrors the one of std. hℎh-FEM. This includes that\n(1) hℎh-AgFEM always produces more optimal meshes, in terms of the error,\nthan its non-adaptive version; and (2) optimal convergence rates are retained,\neven for the hℎh-AgFEM Fichera problems, where convergence in the\nnon-adaptive version is limited by regularity. Although the std. method is slightly more accurate than its ag. counterpart\nfor the Fichera problems with uniform refinements, the usual behaviour is that\nthey are very similar in terms of accuracy. Another outcome observed is that the\nLB criterion is clearly more cost-efficient, in terms of mesh size, than\nthe OB one for both std. and ag. variants. This is also reported\nin  with std. hℎh-FEM. However, as expected, the linear solver does not manage to generate a solution\nin most of std. FE cases. Either the preconditioner cannot be generated or\nit is not positive definite (thus, incompatible with the conjugate gradient\nmethod). Both issues are directly related to the severe ill-conditioning of\nmatrices obtained with the std. method, as extensively reported in previous\nworks  . On the other hand, when using the ag. method, GAMG is fully robust and converges towards the solution at the\n10−9superscript10910^{-9} tolerance. |u−uh|H1/|u|H1subscript𝑢subscript𝑢ℎsubscript𝐻1subscript𝑢subscript𝐻1|u-u_{h}|_{H_{1}}/|u|_{H_{1}} |u−uh|H1/|u|H1subscript𝑢subscript𝑢ℎsubscript𝐻1subscript𝑢subscript𝐻1|u-u_{h}|_{H_{1}}/|u|_{H_{1}} |u−uh|H1/|u|H1subscript𝑢subscript𝑢ℎsubscript𝐻1subscript𝑢subscript𝐻1|u-u_{h}|_{H_{1}}/|u|_{H_{1}} |u−uh|H1/|u|H1subscript𝑢subscript𝑢ℎsubscript𝐻1subscript𝑢subscript𝐻1|u-u_{h}|_{H_{1}}/|u|_{H_{1}} |u−uh|H1/|u|H1subscript𝑢subscript𝑢ℎsubscript𝐻1subscript𝑢subscript𝐻1|u-u_{h}|_{H_{1}}/|u|_{H_{1}} Despite poor robustness of the solver with the std. method, available results\nin Figure 9 are enough to clearly identify higher\ngrowth rates in number of iterations for std. matrices, than for ag. ones.\nThis exposes that, among the two methods, only hℎh-AgFEM is potentially\nscalable, as the number of iterations mildly grows with the size of the problem;\neven for hℎh-AgFEM points in Figure 9 with the\nlargest number of DOFs, convergence is declared in almost twenty\niterations. We have verified that, in this context, the solver achieves\nsingle-digit reduction of the residual norm in 2-3 iterations, at most. Textbook\nmultigrid efficiency is attained when the solver uses a modest number of point\nsmoothing steps and convergence nearly advances at one digit in reduction of the\nresidual norm per iteration . We have checked the former is\nsatisfied, by inspecting PETSc log data, whereas the latter is broadly\nfulfilled in AgFEM experiments. Therefore, GAMG on hℎh-AgFEM\nmatrices is not only robust, but also efficient. Petsc gAMG iterations Petsc gAMG iterations Petsc gAMG iterations Petsc gAMG iterations Petsc gAMG iterations A final experiment with convergence tests looks at the sensitivity of AgFEM\nto the well-posedness threshold η0subscript𝜂0\\eta_{0}. As it is shown in\nFigure 10, low values of η0subscript𝜂0\\eta_{0} may not bypass the\nsmall cut-cell problem and hinder GAMG solvability, as shown in the 3D\nparallel examples. Conversely, high values of η0subscript𝜂0\\eta_{0} do not affect robustness,\nbut increase solver iterations and reduce (local) accuracy. This is most likely\nan effect of excessive well-posed-to-ill-posed DOF extrapolation. As a\nresult, optimal η0subscript𝜂0\\eta_{0} values may be found in the middle of the  1 [ref]1 range.\nThis means that, while enforcing a minimum amount of aggregation is required to\nguarantee robustness, superfluous aggregation deteriorates solver efficiency.\nThis effect is particularly prominent in hℎh-adaptivity; setting η0=1subscript𝜂01\\eta_{0}=1 on\nuniform meshes leads to decent results, as demonstrated in a previous\nwork . |u−uh|H1/|u|H1subscript𝑢subscript𝑢ℎsubscript𝐻1subscript𝑢subscript𝐻1|u-u_{h}|_{H_{1}}/|u|_{H_{1}} |u−uh|H1/|u|H1subscript𝑢subscript𝑢ℎsubscript𝐻1subscript𝑢subscript𝐻1|u-u_{h}|_{H_{1}}/|u|_{H_{1}} |u−uh|H1/|u|H1subscript𝑢subscript𝑢ℎsubscript𝐻1subscript𝑢subscript𝐻1|u-u_{h}|_{H_{1}}/|u|_{H_{1}} Petsc gAMG iterations Petsc gAMG iterations Petsc gAMG iterations\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: reduce (local) accuracy.
