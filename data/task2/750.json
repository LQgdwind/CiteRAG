      "content": "Paper Title: Compositional Generalization via Neural-Symbolic Stack Machines\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHumans have an exceptional capability of compositional reasoning. Given a set of basic components and a few demonstrations of their combinations, a person could effectively capture the underlying compositional rules, and generalize the knowledge to novel combinations [ref]9   [ref]28.\nIn contrast, deep neural networks, including the state-of-the-art models for natural language understanding, typically lack such generalization abilities [ref]26  , although they have demonstrated impressive performance on various applications. To evaluate the compositional generalization, [ref]26 proposes the SCAN benchmark for natural language to action sequence generation. When SCAN is randomly split into training and testing sets, neural sequence models   can achieve perfect generalization. However, when SCAN is split such that the testing set contains unseen combinations of components in the training set, the test accuracies of these models drop dramatically, though the training accuracies are still nearly 100%percent100100\\%. Some techniques have been proposed to improve the performance on SCAN, but they either still fail to generalize on some splits   0  , or are specialized for SCAN-like grammar learning 8. In this paper, we propose the Neural-Symbolic Stack machine (NeSS), which integrates a symbolic stack machine into a sequence-to-sequence generation framework, and learns a neural network as the controller to operate the machine. NeSS preserves the capacity of existing neural models for sequence generation; meanwhile, the symbolic stack machine supports recursion  , so it can break down the entire sequence into components, process them separately and then combine the results, encouraging the model to learn the primitives and composition rules.\nIn addition, we propose the notion of operational equivalence, which formalizes the intuition that semantically similar sentences often imply similar operations executed by the symbolic stack machine. It enables NeSS to categorize components based on their semantic similarities, which further improves the generalization. To train our model without the ground truth execution traces, we design a curriculum learning scheme, which enables the model to find correct execution traces for long training samples. We evaluate NeSS on four benchmarks that require compositional generalization: (1) the SCAN benchmark discussed above; (2) the task of few-shot learning of compositional instructions [ref]28; (3) the compositional machine translation task [ref]26; and (4) the context-free grammar parsing tasks . NeSS achieves 100%percent100100\\% generalization performance on all these benchmarks.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: a set of basic components and a few demonstrations of their combinations, a person could effectively capture the underlying compositional rules, and generalize the knowledge to novel combinations [ref]9   [ref]28.\nIn contrast, deep neural networks, including the state-of-the-art models for natural language understanding, typically lack such generalization abilities [ref]26  , although they\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
