      "content": "Paper Title: Verification Algorithms for Automated Separation Logic Verifiers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe first verification algorithm for separation logic was the SE algorithm for Smallfoot . Its partial heap representation as a collection of heap chunks has been adopted and refined by many separation logic verifiers (such as Caper [ref]17, the Gillian instantiations for C and JavaScript , JaVerT , SecC , VeriFast , and Viper’s SE-backend), for instance, to support user-defined predicates , alternative permission models such as fractional permissions [ref]12 and counting permissions , advanced separation logic connectives such as magic wands  and iterated separating conjunction , and proof search for angelic choice using backtracking [ref]17. Our evaluation covers those extensions that are implemented in Viper, namely predicates, fractional permissions, magic wands, and iterated separating conjunction. Gillian  is an SE framework\nthat can be instantiated for different input languages and separation logics and lets\neach instantiation define its own representation of the heap.\nThe existing instantiations for C and JavaScript use an algorithm similar but not identical to SE-PS, but Gillian could also express the other SE algorithms we discuss.\nOur evaluation can guide developers toward an optimal use of Gillian’s expressiveness. VCG for separation logic was first developed in the context of VeriCool [ref]57 and then extended to concurrency in Chalice .\nThe algorithm there, as well as in Viper’s VCG-backend, uses a total-heap representation. While Chalice and Viper use a single total map to represent all heap values, GrassHopper  uses a dedicated map for each resource. As we observed in our evaluation, and has previously been shown in the context of VCC , this representation can improve performance and completeness by simplifying framing. GrassHopper uses advanced algorithms to automate reasoning about predicates, which were not in scope for our evaluation here. Existing verifiers support a range of permission logics, including separation logic and implicit dynamic frames [ref]57.\nSeparation logic is typically defined over partial heaps, whereas the theory of implicit dynamic frames uses total heaps. However, there is a strong connection between both logics , and the algorithms discussed in this paper can support both. There are other approaches to automating verification in separation logic. For instance, Steel  is built on top of F* , which uses type inference to devise derivations in a dependently typed separation logic.\nRefinedC  automates proof search in Lithium, a fragment of the Iris separation logic . Its verification algorithm is implemented in Coq as a tactic.\nSuch approaches differ substantially from the SE and VCG algorithms discussed in this paper in the degree of automation they provide, their expressiveness, or their ability to devise foundational proofs, which makes a meaningful comparison difficult.\n\nHip/Sleek  performs a forward verification similar to SE but operates directly by checking entailments on separation logic formulas and, thus, does not need a heap encoding.\nTo our knowledge, existing separation logic solvers do not support all of the separation logic features (predicates, magic wands and quantified resources, and their combination) supported by the algorithms we considered. Kassios et al.  compared the performance of Chalice’s VCG algorithm to an alternative SE-backend most similar to SE-PS, and found a significant performance advantage for the SE-backend throughout. However, their comparison does not include the versions of SE and VCG used in modern tools, does not assess completeness, and does not reflect the diversity of verification problems, with only 29 examples in total being compared. Finally, choices between explicitly enumerating states (e.g., heap chunks in partial heap models and program paths in SE) and using logical formulas to represent the different options (in total heap models and VCG algorithms) also exist for other ways of automated reasoning.\nFor example, explicit-state model checking enumerates individual states, whereas symbolic model checking represents sets of states via logical formulas, offering different tradeoffs .\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: separation logic was the SE algorithm for Smallfoot .
