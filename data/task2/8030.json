      "content": "Paper Title: Combining Neural Architecture Search and Automatic Code Optimization: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe end-to-end design process of NN architectures proves challenging when performed manually, as it requires time and expertise. This is why many researchers resort to  Neural Architecture Search (NAS) , which is a set of techniques for automatically designing NN architectures. Formulated as an optimization problem, NAS searches for the best architecture within a set of NN candidates, referred to as the search space, using a search algorithm that optimizes one objective, such as accuracy, or multiple objectives, such as execution time, energy consumption, memory usage, etc. Due to the time-consuming training of every sampled architecture, an evaluation strategy is used to estimate the objective(s) with minimal or no training. NAS has been successful in many tasks, including Image Classification [ref]12, object detection , and keyword spotting [ref]14. However, following the DL trend, the found models require intensive compute power and memory resources due to their complex nature. This complexity also makes it hard to deploy them to hardware for efficient inference. This challenge has spurred the development of novel multi-objective NAS methods, known as Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS)  . HW-NAS is described with the same components as NAS. The search space can be tailored to the target hardware and task , and the search algorithm finds the Pareto front, which represents the best architectures in terms of trade-off between the considered objectives. These objectives include hardware metrics such as latency [ref]17 [ref]12, FLOPs  , energy consumption  and so on. The complexity of HW-NAS is hindered by the evaluation of these objectives, which requires estimation techniques such as using lookup tables [ref]17, analytical approximations , and surrogate models [ref]12. For in-depth details about HW-NAS techniques, we refer readers to .\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: training of every sampled architecture, an evaluation strategy is used to estimate the objective(s) with minimal or no training.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
