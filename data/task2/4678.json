      "content": "Paper Title: BOME! Bilevel Optimization Made Easy: A Simple First-Order Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe value-function formulation (4)\nis a classical approach in bilevel optimization   .\nHowever,\ndespite its attractive properties,\nit has been mostly used as a theoretical tool,\nand much less exploited for practical algorithms compared with the more widely known hypergradient approach (Section 2), especially for challenging nonconvex functions f𝑓f and g𝑔g such as those encountered in deep learning.\nOne exception is Liu et al. [ref]33,\nwhich proposes a BO method by solving the value-function formulation using an interior-point method combined with a smoothed approximation.\nThis was improved later in\na pessimistic trajectory truncation approach  and a sequential minimization approach  (BVFSM).\nSimilar to our approach, these methods do not require computation of Hessians, thanks to the use of value function.\nHowever, as we observe in experiments (Section 6.2), BVFSM tends to be dominated by our method both in accuracy and speed,\nand is sensitive to some hyperparameters that are difficult to tune (such as the coefficients of the log-barrier function in interior point method).\nTheoretically,\nLiu et al. [ref]33   provide only asymptotic analysis on the convergence of the smoothed and penalized surrogate loss to the target loss.\nThey do not give an analysis for the algorithm that was actually implemented. Our algorithm is build up on the dynamic control barrier method of Gong et al. [ref]16, an elementary approach for constrained optimization.\nGong et al. [ref]16 also applied their approach to solve a\nlexicographical optimization of form minθ⁡f​(θ)subscript𝜃𝑓𝜃\\min_{\\theta}f(\\theta) s.t. θ∈arg​minθ′⁡g​(θ′)𝜃subscriptargminsuperscript𝜃′𝑔superscript𝜃′\\theta\\in\\operatorname*{arg\\,min}_{\\theta^{\\prime}}g(\\theta^{\\prime}), which is a bilevel optimization without an outer variable (known as simple bilevel optimization ). Our method is an extension of their method to general bilevel optimization. Such extension is not straightforward, especially when the lower level problem is non-convex, requiring introducing the stop-gradient operation in a mathematically correct way. We also provide non-asymptotic analysis for our method, that goes beyond the continuous time analysis in Gong et al. [ref]16. A key sophistication in the theoretical analysis is that we need to control the approximation error of θ∗​(vk)superscript𝜃subscript𝑣𝑘\\theta^{*}(v_{k}) with θk(T)superscriptsubscript𝜃𝑘𝑇\\theta_{k}^{(T)} at each step, which requires an analysis significantly different from that of Gong et al. [ref]16. Indeed, non-asymptotic results have not yet been obtained for many BO algorithms. Even for the classic hypergradient-based approach (such results are established only recently in Ji et al. [ref]22). We believe that we are the first to establish a non-asymptotic rate for a purely first-order BO algorithm under general assumptions, e.g. the lower level problem can be both convex or non-convex. Another recent body of\ntheoretical works on BO focus on how to optimize when only stochastic approximation of the objectives is provided   [ref]22    ; there are also recent works on the lower bounds and minimax optimal algorithms  [ref]22. These algorithms and analysis are based on hypergradient descent and hence require Hessian-vector products in implementation.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: with the more widely known hypergradient approach (Section 2), especially for challenging nonconvex functions f𝑓f and g𝑔g such as those encountered in deep learning.\nOne exception is Liu et al.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
