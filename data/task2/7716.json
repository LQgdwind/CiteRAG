      "content": "Paper Title: Optimizing the Deployment of Tiny Transformers on Low-Power MCUs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, transformer-based architectures have had increasing success in various domains thanks to their flexibility, high accuracy, and generalization capabilities. More precisely, encoder-decoder [ref]12 and decoder-only [ref]13 models are now dominating the field of NLP while encoder-only [ref]14 is widely used in CV.\nIn particular, models from tens of millions to tens of billions of parameters have been designed to solve complex problems such as question-answering and image generation [ref]14 .\nOn the other side, in the tinyML field, new encoder-only transformer networks are emerging, demonstrating excellent capability, especially in time-series analysis . Transformers are built around repeating an identical Transformer block.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the Transformer block comprises two stages, the MHSA and the Fully-Connected stage. To deploy transformers on MCUs, the MHSA stage is the most challenging step, given that the Fully-Connected stage is common in CNNs and its optimization has already been tacked in previous works. The dimensions of each operation in the MHSA are determined by four parameters: the sequence length S𝑆S, the embedding dimension E𝐸E, the projection dimension P𝑃P and the head dimension H𝐻H.\nThe first step in the MHSA stage is the projection of the input sequence X∈ℝS×E𝑋superscriptℝ𝑆𝐸X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{S\\times E} into the query, key, and values, Q,K,V∈ℝS×P𝑄𝐾𝑉superscriptℝ𝑆𝑃Q,K,V\\in\\mathbb{R}^{S\\times P}, by means of three weights matrices, Wquery,Wkey,Wvalue∈ℝH×E×Psubscript𝑊querysubscript𝑊keysubscript𝑊valuesuperscriptℝ𝐻𝐸𝑃W_{\\text{query}},W_{\\text{key}},W_{\\text{value}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H\\times E\\times P}. In the second step, Q𝑄Q, K𝐾K, and V𝑉V are combined in the Attention step, which is the core of the Transformer block. It is defined as with d𝑑d being the dimensionality of 𝐊𝐊\\mathbf{K} used as a scaling factor and where the softmax function is applied to each row. The softmax of the i𝑖i-t​h𝑡ℎth element of a row of size n𝑛n is defined as follows: The output of this second step is the matrix M​1𝑀1M1.\nThese first two steps are repeated for every head of the MHSA layer, leading to H𝐻H parallel executions of the three Linear projection layers and the two GEneral Matrix Multiplications (GEMMs) of Eq. 13 and Eq. 2.\nThe final step of the MHSA stage involves a Linear layer to project the matrix M​1𝑀1M1 back into the input embedding space E𝐸E, fusing the computation from the different heads. The second stage of the Transformer block, shown in Figure 1, is the Fully-Connected stage. It is an entirely sequential stage comprising a row-wise layer normalization, an element-wise Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) , and two Linear layers. In Table I, we report the number of parameters and the computational workload for the two stages in Figure 1. To measure the workload’s complexity, we account for the number of Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations in GEMMs and Linear layers. However, it is essential to note that other operators, such as softmax, transposition, concatenation, and GELU, can also strongly impact overall latency.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Recently, transformer-based architectures have had increasing success in various domains thanks to their flexibility, high accuracy, and generalization capabilities.
