      "content": "Paper Title: Personal Privacy Protection via Irrelevant Faces Tracking and Pixelation in Video Live Streaming\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVideo live streaming has never been so prevailing as in the past two or three years. Live streaming platforms, sites, and streamers rapidly become part of our daily life. Benefit from the popularity of smart-phones and cheaper 5G networks, online video live streaming profoundly shapes our daily life . Streaming techniques endow people with the capability to instantly record and broadcast real scenes to audiences. The primary host of live streaming activities transformed from TV stations, news bureau, and professional agencies to the ordinaries. Without the imposed censorship, these private streaming channels severely disregard the personal privacy rights . As a result, streamers, together with live streaming platforms, have raised a host of privacy infringement issues. Despite different privacy laws in different regions, these privacy infringements are always concerning and even committed to crimes . Apart from the indifference of streamers, the handcrafted and labor-intensive pixelation process is in fact the main reason leads to rampant privacy violations amid streaming . Streaming platforms are therefore incapable of allocating adequate human labor on executing censorship anytime, anywhere. Being a giant hosting service provider, YouTube is already aware of the reason and published its offline face pixelation tool on the latest YouTube Creator Studio . When uploading videos, creators are now required to pixelate faces of children under age 13 through YouTube Creator Studio, unless parental consent is obtained . YouTube Live and Facebook Live experienced explosive growths during the global COVID-19 pandemic, and how to push similar privacy-protection policies in streaming is under heated discussions. As far as we know, current studies, including YouTube Studio  and Microsoft Azure , mainly focus on processing offline videos; whilst leave the face pixelation solution on the online video live streaming field underexplored. Thus, in this paper, we build a privacy-protection method named Face Pixelation in Video Live Streaming (FPVLS) to blur irrelevant peoples’ faces amid streaming. FPVLS protects personal privacy rights as well as promotes the sound development for the video live streaming industry. The tangible reference of FPVLS is the mosaics manually allocated in TV shows. People who are unwilling to expose in front of the audiences will be facially pixelated in the show’s post-production process. Hence, FPVLS can be intuitively resolved as an automized replica of the manual face pixelation process. Furthermore, the manual face pixelation process is remarkably close to the multi-face tracking (MFT) algorithms, because they both involve continuous identification of target faces on frames. Then, fine-tuning MFT algorithms on live streaming seem to be a straightforward solution for FPVLS. Follow the above interpretation, we directly migrated and tuned the multi-face trackers on our collected video live streaming dataset. However, vast tests reveal that migrated multi-face trackers suffer a severe drifting issue. Fig. 1 demonstrates a typical street-streaming scene from left to right. A street hawker is waving hands to the female streamer for greeting. Without the permission of the hawker, his face shall be pixelated for privacy protection. Meanwhile, a passerby in a light green shirt is passing through the streamer and the hawker. YouTube Studio, which relies on MFT algorithms, generates the middle row’s mosaics circled in red. During the crossover of the passerby and the hawker (middle-three snapshots), the hawker’s face mosaics drift manifestly. At the rightmost snapshot, the mosaics are even brought to the passerby’s neck region and leave the hawker’s face completely exposed. Such a drifting issue is mainly caused by the underperformance of the face detection algorithms in the unconstrained live-streaming scenes. State-of-the-art MFT studies adopt a similar tracking-by-detection structure [ref]8 [ref]9 0, which assembles face detectors ahead of trackers. Detectors specify the bounding boxes of faces on frames and pass the results to trackers. Trackers either designate an existing tracklet or initiate a new tracklet for each detection, and further merge tracklets into an intact trajectory. The detector’s outcomes primarily determine the quality of the tracklets, and trackers accept tracklets as priors in making scene-based matching or reasoning.\nOn the whole performance of the MFT algorithm, the detector plays an as pivotal role as the tracker. However, the detection accuracy is seldom mentioned and discussed in current MFT algorithms [ref]8 [ref]9 0 1 2. Benchmark tests for these MFT algorithms are carried out in music videos, movie clips, TV sitcoms, or CCTV footage recorded by professional, high-resolution, steady, or stably moving cameras with various shot changes. Face detectors function well in these videos; accordingly, tracklets can be reliably generated. Clean face detection results and reliable primal tracklets become the acquiescence, and the major concern of current MFT is how to establish consistent, accurate associations among tracklets under frequent switching shots. In practice, live streaming scenes are commonly recorded by handheld mobile phone cameras with only a single or a few shots. Likewise, the video quality can only maintain at a relatively low level (720p/30FPS or lower). Crowded scenarios, frequent irregular motions of the camera, and abrupt broadcasting resolution conversion are everywhere in live streaming. All these harsh realities indicate that face detection networks are no longer able to yield accurate results for the generation of reliable tracklets. Once scattered or unreliable tracklets are initialized, trackers are prone to fast corruption and jeopardize the efficacy of MFT based pixelation methods. Only very few previous works 3 1 noticed the uncertainty caused by unreliable detection results but hardly explored solutions. Besides the drifting, the apparent over-pixelation problem can be observed in the middle snapshots of Fig. 1. Introduced by the tracking algorithms and inherited by tracking based pixelation methods, the over-pixelation occurs when pixelation methods generate unnecessary and excessive mosaics for un-identifiable faces. Heavy or full occlusion and massive motion blurs are the common reasons in causing un-identifiable faces. Over-pixelation is an intrinsic problem while migrating tracking algorithms to pixelation tasks. MFT algorithms benefit from estimating the locations of temporary un-identifiable faces 4 2. Such an evidence accumulation process fairly contributes to constructing long enough trajectories, thereby avoiding frequent face ID-switch. Unlike tracking, in the meantime of redacting irrelevant faces out, pixelation tasks eager to preserve the audience as many originals as possible. Consequently, to accomplish the irrelevant people’s faces tracking and pixelation task under streaming scenes, FPVLS adopts a brand new, clustering and re-detection based, frame-to-video framework. The core of this framework is the raw face trajectory generation stage and the trajectory refinement stage. In a nutshell, when streaming started, face detection and embedding (recognition) networks are alternately applied on frames to yield face vectors. Noises caused both by false positives in detection and variations in embedding networks are concealed in these face vectors. Thereupon, Positioned Incremental Affinity Propagation (PIAP) is proposed to cope with these noises and generate raw face trajectories. PIAP inherits the ability of clustering under ill-defined cluster numbers from classic Affinity Propagation (AP) 5. We introduce the positioned information to revise affinities and endow PIAP with noise-resistance. We further employ incremental clustering to accelerate the consensus-reaching process. Besides the noises, false negatives in detection arouse intermittences in raw trajectories. The trajectory refinement stage aims to elaborately compensate the intermittences without provoking over-pixelation. We construct a proposal network to re-detect the faces in the intermittences. The two-sample test based on the Empirical Likelihood Ratio (ELR) is then applied to cull the non-faces from re-detection results. The proposal network and the two-sample test collaborate to yield the final trajectories. Lastly, the post-process allocates Gaussian filters on the refined trajectories for pixelation. An example of FPVLS is presented in the bottom row of Fig. 1. The mosaics marked in yellow rectangular remain on the hawker’s face after the crossover. The drifting issue is greatly alleviated. Further, as shown in the middle pictures of the third row, while the target face is fully occluded, FPVLS will not produce baffling, over-pixelated mosaics like YouTube Studio or other tracking based methods. Specifically, this paper consists of following contributions: We build the first online pixelation framework: Face Pixelation in Video Live Streaming (FPVLS). FPVLS adopts PIAP clustering and the two-sample test based on ELR to alleviate the trajectories drifting as well as contain the over-pixelation problem. We proposed the Positioned Incremental Affinity Propagation (PIAP) clustering algorithm to generate raw trajectories upon inaccurate face vectors. The proposed PIAP spontaneously handles the cluster number generation problem, and are endowed with noise-resistant and time-saving merits through position information and increment clustering. A non-parametric imposing two-sample test based on empirical likelihood ratio (ELR) statistics is introduced. Cooperating with the proposal network, the two-sample test compensates the deep networks insufficiency through the ELR statistics, and avoid over-pixelation in the trajectory refinement. Such an error rejection algorithm can serve other face detection algorithms. We collected a diverse video live streaming dataset from the streaming platforms and manually labeled dense annotations (51040 face labels) on frames to conduct our experiments. This dataset will be released to the public and could be the benchmark dataset for future studies on video live streaming. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows.
