      "content": "Paper Title: Multimodal Visual-Tactile Representation Learning through Self-Supervised Contrastive Pre-Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the realm of robotics, visual perception has traditionally served as a central modality extensively leveraged for acquiring nuanced environmental representations, a role emphasized in a range of studies  . However, this approach harbors intrinsic limitations in fully encapsulating the dynamic and intricate state of the surrounding environment . Conversely, tactile sensing excels in delineating fine-grained attributes that are beyond the grasp of visual modalities, effectively capturing the subtleties that evade visual systems. Thus, a synergic integration of both visual and tactile modalities offers a more robust and comprehensive world representation, wherein the visual systems predominantly decipher global features while tactile sensing augments this with enriched local feature representations  . However, the fusion of these modalities is far from trivial, given the disparate information density each conveys over time. Especially in manipulation task settings, the reliance on vision remains high until the robot engages physically with an object or surface; following this interaction, the tactile modality often becomes the principal source of nuanced data, particularly in scenarios involving occlusion by the robotic arm. Recent endeavors are increasingly focusing on the efficient fusion of vision and tactile representations to navigate the challenges delineated above    [ref]9 0. This is further propelled by the significant advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches, catalyzed by the lack of labeled tactile and visuotactile datasets 0 1 2 [ref]9.\nIn contrast to visual data, where simulations and virtual environments can often provide substantial and rich datasets, tactile data collection requires physical interaction with a wide array of materials and objects to encapsulate a rich diversity of tactile experiences. This not only escalates the complexity but also significantly extends the time needed for data collection. Recognizing these challenges, researchers are turning towards the SSL strategy to leverage unlabeled data, which is easier and quicker to collect 0 1 2.\nSSL facilitates the learning of useful representations from this unlabeled data, potentially accelerating the development of sophisticated visuotactile systems by reducing the dependency on labor-intensive labeled datasets, thus presenting a promising avenue to mitigate the hurdles in tactile data collection. In recent years, contrastive learning (CL) has risen as a prominent subfield of self-supervised learning (SSL), establishing itself as the predominant methodology for pretraining visual encoders 3 4 5 6 7 8. In this study, we propose a Multi-modal Visual-Tactile (MViTac) representation learning algorithm for effectively fusing the two modalities. Our methodology facilitates the learning of both intra and inter-modal representations, leveraging the richness of visual and tactile observations. We use two sets of encoders to compute the InfoNCE loss for the two ranges of losses. We employ the within-modality (intra) loss to maximize the agreement of the representations of similar modality instances. Similarly, we employ the across-modality (inter) loss to maximize the similarity of representations of different modalities across the same sample.\nUtilizing the Touch-and-Go 1 and Calandra  datasets for training the encoders, we undertake an exhaustive evaluation across diverse downstream tasks, including material property identifications and robot grasp prediction. We thereby substantiate the efficacy of our approach in transcending the performance benchmarks set by previous state-of-the-art frameworks.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: involving occlusion by the robotic arm.
