      "content": "Paper Title: An Algorithm-Hardware Co-Optimized Framework for Accelerating N:M Sparse Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTransformer-based networks are a formidable force in deep learning .\nTremendous impact in many fields, such as neural machine translation [ref]2, language understanding [ref]3, and image processing , has been made since the innovation of Transformers.\nNevertheless, the impressive performance of Transformers comes with heavy computing and memory costs, which become a significant barrier to the efficient deployment of Transformer-based applications.\nNotably, BERT, a representative Transformer-based model [ref]3, requires 440MB memory and over 176G floating-point operations.\nSuch severe requirements on memory and computation make it critical to find an efficient solution for deploying Transformers. Sparsity is an important feature that can be utilized to improve the efficiency of DNNs deployment in dedicated accelerators.\nIn the pioneering works, OPTIMUS [ref]5 and EdgeBERT , the latest ASIC accelerators, leverage unstructured sparsity to realize efficient deployment for Transformers.\nNevertheless, it is hard to predict the unstructured sparsity in advance, and therefore the acceleration performance can be greatly dragged.\nRecent studies  demonstrate deep neural networks leveraging N:M fine-grained structured sparsity, where N out of M parameters are zeros for every continuous M parameters, can achieve comparable performance over those leveraging unstructured sparsity .\nHowever, it is significantly restricted to accelerate N:M sparse networks on current hardware platforms.\nAs shown in Fig.¬†1¬†(a), the only existing solution is ASP with Ampere GPUs that focuses on the middle-level (2:4), i.e., 50%, sparse ratio.\nBased on our experiments, a heavy Transformer can be dramatically slimmed by weight pruning with the aggressive N:M pattern, e.g., 2:8 or 1:8, achieving a considerable reduction in the amount of both parameters and operations.\nThe only choice of uniform 2:4 sparsity limits performance when deploying Transformer-based models, making it inflexible to meet different hardware constraints (e.g., latency, energy).\nCompared with the uniform 2:4 sparsity, the more flexible general N:M sparsity in real applications can satisfy various algorithm and hardware constraints under different deployment scenarios.\nHowever, there is currently a lack of an integrated framework to investigate the deployment of Transformer with general N:M sparse patterns.\nTo bridge this gap, as presented in Fig.¬†1¬†(b), we propose an algorithm-hardware co-optimized framework for accelerating N:M sparse Transformers, which addresses two significant issues: 1). how to produce a series of N:M sparse Transformers in an efficient way; 2). how to design a flexible and efficient dedicated architecture for N:M sparse Transformers on diverse FPGA platforms. Although advanced optimization algorithms ASP and SR-STE can maintain the middle-level (2:4) sparsity via static and dynamic fine-tuning, we observe existing methods degrade the performance significantly under high sparse ratio (e.g., ‚â•75%absentpercent75\\geq 75\\%).\nIn addition, the ASP and SR-STE schemes leverage single-shot magnitude-based pruning for a specified hyper-parameter N and M.\nThis traditional recipe results in a significant performance drop with a higher sparse ratio and restricts the deployment of flexible N:M sparse models on the FPGA platform.\nTo overcome the aforementioned problems, we propose a sparsity inheritance mechanism, which increases the sparsity progressively to enable efficient searching for NùëÅN:MùëÄM sparse Transformers under various sparsity configurations (e.g., 2:8, 1:8).\nWe also propose a pruning method, namely inherited dynamic pruning (IDP), which shrinks pre-pruning models progressively, and the convergent pre-pruning initialized models can aid in the convergence of the following sub-networks.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on Transformer-based models, showing that models generated by IDP with the sparsity inheritance mechanism have superior performance on various sparsity ratios than those using the ASP and SR-STE.\nMoreover, for efficient model deployment, we apply a simple but effective bitmap-based compression scheme, which dramatically reduce the storage requirements for N:M sparse Transformers. To enable flexible and efficient deployment on various FPGA devices, we design a highly configurable dedicated accelerator for N:M sparse Transformers, namely STA.\nSTA fully explores the parallelism of Transformers in three aspects, including head parallelism, row parallelism, and column parallelism, which significantly improves computational efficiency.\nIt features two computing cores, a diverse matrix multiplication (MatMul) engine, called DMME, and a scalable softmax module, both of which are highly configurable.\nOperations of N:M sparse Transformers are dominated by two types of MatMuls.\nOne is the sparse-dense MatMul with N:M sparse network parameters, and the other is dense-dense MatMul free of parameters.\nDMME performs both sparse-dense and dense-dense MatMuls on-the-fly, and achieves much higher computational efficiency over the prior work 0 under both modes.\nEspecially for sparse-dense MatMul, DMME only performs operations related to those remaining non-zero parameters, which greatly improves computational efficiency.\nThe scalable softmax module can perform the softmax function in Transformers.\nIt keeps all the intermediate results fully local, eliminating latency from intermediate off-chip data communication.\nAccording to the given architectural settings, STA can be rapidly implemented on FPGAs to realize efficient deployment for specific N:M sparse Transformers. To summarize, the contributions of our paper are as follows:\n To our best knowledge, this is the first work that presents an algorithm-hardware co-optimized framework to systematically study the efficiency of fine-grained N:M sparse Transformers on FPGA. The proposed framework can adjust to diverse hardware constraints for flexible and efficient model deployment. To generate a series of N:M sparse Transformers simultaneously, we propose a sparsity inheritance mechanism along with the inherited dynamic pruning (IDP) algorithm, which can significantly achieve about 6.7%percent6.76.7\\% accuracy improvement of Transformers under high sparsity compared with state-of-the-art methods. We present a simple but effective bitmap-based compression scheme for N:M sparse Transformers compared to multiple sparse indexing formats, which dramatically reduces the storage requirements up to 5.33√ó5.33\\times.\n We propose a dedicated hardware architecture, namely STA, to realize flexible and efficient deployment of N:M sparse Transformers. It features two novel hardware modules handling intensive operations of Transformers, including a diverse matrix multiplication engine (DMME) that unifies dense and sparse MatMul operations in high computational efficiency, and a scalable softmax module to avoid frequent off-chip memory accesses. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four NLP tasks and four Transformer-based models to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, which achieves up to 19.47√ó19.47\\times speedup over Intel i9-9900X, NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti, and prior FPGA-based accelerators for Transformers.\n The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section¬†II presents an overview of Transformers, and state-of-the-art works for accelerating Transformers with innovations on hardware architecture.\nSection¬†III introduces the workflow of our proposed algorithm-hardware co-optimization framework.\nSection¬†IV and Section¬†V elaborate optimizations on pruning algorithm and hardware architecture, respectively.\nComprehensive experimental results are presented in Section¬†VI to show significant potential of our proposed co-optimization framework in Transformer-based applications.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Transformer-based networks are a formidable force in deep learning .\nTremendous impact in many fields, such as neural machine translation [ref]2, language understanding [ref]3, and image processing , has been made since the innovation of Transformers.\nNevertheless, the impressive performance of Transformers comes with heavy computing\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
