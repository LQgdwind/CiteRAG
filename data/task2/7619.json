      "content": "Paper Title: Rule-driven News Captioning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraditional image captioning task , [ref]2 aims to produce general captions, which overlook named entities in images, such as specific people, organizations, and places.\nIn contrast, the news captioning task , [ref]4 leverages background knowledge from relevant news articles to generate named-entity-included captions, thereby greatly improving the quality and practicality of image captions. Significant progress has been made in news captioning community.\nFor examples, Biten et al. [ref]5 generate a template with placeholders, and then select named entities from news articles to replace the placeholders.\nTran et al.  use the byte-pair encoding to generate unseen or rare named entities.\nRecently, there have been several attempts to apply large-scale pre-trained models to the task of news captioning.\nFor examples, Zhang et al. [ref]4 utilize a multi-modal entity prompting mechanism to fine-tune the large-scale pre-trained model.\nHowever, these methods still face a significant challenge.\nThe news captioning task requires adhering to some fundamental rules of news reporting, such as accurately describing the individuals, actions, or locations for the special event.\nThe existing methods ignore the rich rule patterns, which only focus on the correlation between input news content and output predictions.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, given an image with a man who is performing and the news article, the existing captioner may generate the rule-agnostic sentence “The singer-songwriter Thiago Thiago de Mello”, which can not strictly describe the location “New York” and the correct person’s name “Pedro Sa Moraes”. To tackle this problem, we propose the rule-driven news captioning method, which can generate image descriptions following designated rule signal. Our method consists of three components:\n1) Named Entity Extraction.\nWe use the pre-trained named entity recognition (NER) technique to extract named entities from news articles.\nThen, the CLIP model is employed to compute the image-text similarity to match the named entities that closely align with the news image content. To ensure that the CLIP model is applicable to the news domain, we fine-tuned it on the news caption dataset.\n2) News Rule Construction.\nWe design the news-aware semantic rule for the descriptions.\nThis rule incorporates the primary action depicted in the image (e.g., “performing”) and the set of roles played by named entities surrounding the action (e.g., “Agent” and “Place”). Meanwhile, it can present a clear affiliation between generic objects (e.g., “man”) in images and named entities (e.g., “Pedro Sa Moraes”) in news articles.\n3) Caption Generation.\nWe incorporate the news-aware semantic rule into the large-scale pre-trained model, BART, using the prefix-tuning strategy.\nSpecifically, BART can be used as the pre-trained multi-modal summarization model  to generate captions for both images and news articles.\nWe embed the semantic rule into BART’s multiple encoder layers. As a result, BART is effectively guided to generate news sentences that adhere to the rules of news reporting. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two publicly available news datasets, i.e., GoodNews [ref]5 and NYTimes800k .\nExperimental results show that our method can achieve competitive or state-of-the-art performance against the existing methods on all benchmarks.\nEspecially under CIDEr metric, our method can achieve significant improvement over the best competitor [ref]4 by 7.59% on GoodNews.\nAblation studies further examine the efficacy of each component.\nBesides, we visualize the generated news-aware semantic rules, to clearly observe the named entities’ changes improved by our method.\nIn summary, we have the following main contributions: We propose the novel rule-driven news captioning method. Different from existing works that primarily focus on the relationship between input news content and output predictions, our approach enables the captioner to follow designated rule signal for the caption generation. We design the news-aware semantic rule that encompasses the primary action depicted in the image as well as the roles played by the named entities involved in the action. This semantic rule is then injected into the large-scale pre-trained model, BART, using the prefix-tuning strategy, which guides BART to generate news sentences. Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely used datasets, including GoodNews [ref]5 and NYTimes800k , to assess the effectiveness of our method. The visualization of the semantic rules confirms its capacity to control the named entities within news descriptions.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Traditional image captioning task , [ref]2 aims to produce general captions, which overlook named entities in images, such as specific people, organizations, and places.\nIn contrast, the news captioning task , [ref]4 leverages\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
