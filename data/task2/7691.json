      "content": "Paper Title: (Towards a) Statistical Probabilistic Lazy Lambda Calculus\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn order to establish the proper foundations for our forthcoming definition of simulation, we take a short detour into lifting of relations to probability distributions. We try to make the material in this subsection self-contained. Let ℛℛ{\\cal R} be a binary relation on a countable 𝖷𝖷\\mathsf{X}. We use 𝖯,𝖰𝖯𝖰\\mathsf{P},\\mathsf{Q} for discrete sub probability distributions, and |𝖯|,|𝖰|𝖯𝖰|\\mathsf{P}|,|\\mathsf{Q}| for their carrier sets. We write ∑i𝚙i×𝖺isubscript𝑖subscript𝚙𝑖subscript𝖺𝑖\\sum_{i}{\\mathtt{p}}_{i}\\times\\mathsf{a}_{i} for the sub-convex combination of point measures at 𝖺isubscript𝖺𝑖\\mathsf{a}_{i}. Lift binary relations on 𝖷𝖷\\mathsf{X} are to probability distributions as follows. Let 𝖯=∑i𝚙i×𝖺i,𝖰=∑j𝚚j×𝖻jformulae-sequence𝖯subscript𝑖subscript𝚙𝑖subscript𝖺𝑖𝖰subscript𝑗subscript𝚚𝑗subscript𝖻𝑗\\mathsf{P}=\\sum_{i}{\\mathtt{p}}_{i}\\times\\mathsf{a}_{i},\\mathsf{Q}=\\sum_{j}{\\mathtt{q}}_{j}\\times\\mathsf{b}_{j}. Then:\n𝖯​ℛ¯​𝖰𝖯¯ℛ𝖰\\mathsf{P}\\ \\overline{{\\cal R}}\\ \\mathsf{Q} if there is a matching 𝗆i,jsubscript𝗆𝑖𝑗\\mathsf{m}_{i,j} such that: In contrast to the definitions of Segala and Lynch , Deng et al. , the inequality in the last line above permits us to address subprobabilities. The following lemma shows that ℛ¯¯ℛ\\overline{{\\cal R}} can be understood as a Kleisli construction on the probabilistic power domain of Jones and Plotkin . This“splitting lemma” for (countable) probability distributions is a small generalization from the finite in Chapter 4 of Jones and Plotkin . 𝖯​ℛ¯​𝖰𝖯¯ℛ𝖰\\mathsf{P}\\ \\overline{{\\cal R}}\\ \\mathsf{Q} iff for all 𝖲⊆|𝖯|𝖲𝖯\\mathsf{S}\\subseteq\\ |\\mathsf{P}| such that\n(𝖲​;​ℛ)​⋂|𝖯|=𝖲𝖲;ℛ𝖯𝖲(\\mathsf{S}\\ {\\text{{;}}}\\allowbreak\\,\\ {\\cal R})\\bigcap\\ |\\mathsf{P}|=\\mathsf{S}, it is the case that: We follow Chapter 4 of Jones and Plotkin  essentially verbatim, using the countable version of MaxFlow-MinCut from Aharoni et al. [ref]9; in any (possibly infinite) network there exists an orthogonal pair of a flow and a cut222A flow and a cut are orthogonal if the flow exhausts the capacity of the edges that go forward in the cut, even as it assigns 00 flow to the edges that flow back in the cut.. We use this result for very simple countably infinite directed bipartite graph with no infinite paths. The vertices of the graph are given by {𝗌𝗋𝖼,𝗌𝗂𝗇𝗄}∪|𝖯|∪|𝖰|𝗌𝗋𝖼𝗌𝗂𝗇𝗄𝖯𝖰{\\{}\\mathsf{src},\\mathsf{sink}{\\}}\\cup\\ |\\mathsf{P}|\\cup|\\mathsf{Q}|. 𝗌𝗋𝖼𝗌𝗋𝖼\\mathsf{src} is connected to 𝖺isubscript𝖺𝑖\\mathsf{a}_{i} with capacity 𝚙isubscript𝚙𝑖{\\mathtt{p}}_{i}. 𝖻isubscript𝖻𝑖\\mathsf{b}_{i} is connected to 𝗌𝗂𝗇𝗄𝗌𝗂𝗇𝗄\\mathsf{sink} with capacity 𝚚isubscript𝚚𝑖{\\mathtt{q}}_{i}. 𝖺isubscript𝖺𝑖\\mathsf{a}_{i} is connected to 𝖻jsubscript𝖻𝑗\\mathsf{b}_{j} with a very high capacity, say 100100100. Consider (𝖥𝖥\\mathsf{F},𝖢𝖢\\mathsf{C}), the orthogonal pair of a flow and a cut in this graph. If all the edges from the 𝗌𝗋𝖼𝗌𝗋𝖼\\mathsf{src} are in 𝖢𝖢\\mathsf{C}, 𝖥𝖥\\mathsf{F} validates the criterion, yielding the result for the forward direction. If not. Since the capacity of edges from |𝖯|𝖯|\\mathsf{P}| into |𝖰|𝖰|\\mathsf{Q}| is large, they cannot be exhausted. So, 𝖢𝖢\\mathsf{C} consists only of edges from the 𝗌𝗋𝖼𝗌𝗋𝖼\\mathsf{src} or into the 𝗌𝗂𝗇𝗄𝗌𝗂𝗇𝗄\\mathsf{sink}. The set of vertices connected to 𝗌𝗋𝖼𝗌𝗋𝖼\\mathsf{src} in 𝖢𝖢\\mathsf{C} provides evidence of violation of the criterion.\n In the forthcoming development, we use the matching definition in the precongruence proof and the characterization of lemma 3 almost everywhere else. Since ℛ​;​⋂iℛi=⋂iℛ​;​ℛiℛ;subscript𝑖subscriptℛ𝑖subscript𝑖ℛ;subscriptℛ𝑖{\\cal R}\\ {\\text{{;}}}\\allowbreak\\,\\ \\bigcap_{i}\\ {\\cal R}_{i}=\\bigcap_{i}{\\cal R}\\ {\\text{{;}}}\\allowbreak\\,\\ {\\cal R}_{i}, we deduce: Let ∑i𝚙i′×𝖺i≤∑i𝚙i×𝖺isubscript𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝚙′𝑖subscript𝖺𝑖subscript𝑖subscript𝚙𝑖subscript𝖺𝑖\\sum_{i}{\\mathtt{p}}^{\\prime}_{i}\\times\\mathsf{a}_{i}\\leq\\ \\sum_{i}{\\mathtt{p}}_{i}\\times\\mathsf{a}_{i} if 𝚙i′<𝚙isubscriptsuperscript𝚙′𝑖subscript𝚙𝑖{\\mathtt{p}}^{\\prime}_{i}<{\\mathtt{p}}_{i} for all i𝑖i.
