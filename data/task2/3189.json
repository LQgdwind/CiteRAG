      "content": "Paper Title: Split-GCN: Effective Interactive Annotation for Segmentation of Disconnected Instance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate our model in two aspects: in-domain and cross-domain annotation settings. For in-domain experiments, we use the Cityscapes dataset  as the main benchmark to compare our model‚Äôs performance. For cross-domain experiments, we assess the generalization ability of our trained model (with the Cityscapes dataset) on several different cross-domain datasets: KITTI 5, Rooftop [ref]42, ADE20K , and Card.MR . As assumed in   [ref]27, we suppose that the users provide the ground-truth boxes and use them as the input to the model.\n\n\nImage Encoder:\nFollowing the method from PolygonRNN++ , we use the ResNet-50 7 as the backbone of the image encoder.\n\n\nTraining Details:\nWe train the model with the structure shown in Figure 1. We use ImageNet 2 pretrained weights only for the image encoder in the feature extraction network. For training, we use point matching loss, point L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} loss, motion vector loss, and polygon separating loss in an end-to-end manner.A split factor kùëòk represents the maximum number of disconnected components in an object. For instance, k=2ùëò2k=2 means that an object contains one or two disconnected components. We set the range of kùëòk to 1‚â§k1ùëò1\\leq k, where kùëòk is a natural number. We set the initial adjacency matrix of GCN to a single block NùëÅN‚Äìgon as mentioned in Section 3.3. Control points NùëÅN represents the number of the predicted points. When N=40ùëÅ40N=40, an object boundary consists of 40 control points. Experiments regarding the value of kùëòk and NùëÅN are in Section 4.1. For the most experiments, we set the split factor k=3ùëò3k=3 and N=40ùëÅ40N=40. We train our model on a single NVIDIA Titan XP GPU for 150150150 epochs. We use the batch size of 24 and the initial learning rate and weight decay of 1e-4. Moreover, the decay on the learning rate is 1/101101/10 at every 505050 epochs. During training, the input image is cropped using a GT bounding box and appropriately resized with a resolution of 224√ó224224224224\\times 224. Additionally,We use standard augmentation techniques (random rotation, horizontal flip, and scaling) on the data. State-of-the-art & Baseline Models:\nWe first compare our model to state-of-the-art models from the Cityscapes leaderboard to demonstrate the competitiveness of our model. We also compare our model to the baseline models. The baseline models are from competitive models using the similar approaches: Curve-GCN (Spline-GCN and Polygon-GCN) [ref]27, PolygonRNN++ , and PSP-DeepLab . We choose PSP-DeepLab using spatial pyramid pooling  because it has similar encoder architecture as our model. We also choose Curve-GCN and PolygonRNN++, which are the latest models using polygon-based methodology as our model.\n\n\nMetrics:\nWe use three metrics to evaluate our model:\n(1) We use two Average Precision (AP) metrics to compare the performance of our model to the state-of-the-art models. First, AP is calculated by Intersection-over-Union(IoU) with an increase of 0.050.050.05 from 0.50.50.5 to 0.950.950.95 overlap thresholds. Second, AP50 is calculated by IoU with a 0.50.50.5 overlap threshold, which follows the Cityscapes  metrics.\n(2) We use the mean IoU (mIoU) metric to compare the performance of our model to the baseline models. For each predicted instances and ground truth, we calculated the mIoU by averaging the IoU of every class. (3) As mIoU alone is insufficient to measure the inaccuracies on the object boundary, we use the boundary F score  as another metric to evaluate the performance on the object boundary more precisely. The boundary F score measures the performance of the precision and recall on a given boundary width of 1 pixel and 2 pixels, denoted as F1px and F2px, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: performance. For cross-domain experiments, we assess the generalization ability of our trained model (with the Cityscapes dataset) on several different cross-domain datasets: KITTI 5, Rooftop [ref]42, ADE20K , and Card.MR . As assumed in   [ref]27, we suppose that the users provide the ground-truth boxes and use them as the input to the model.\n\n\nImage Encoder:\nFollowing the method from\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
