      "content": "Paper Title: MonoLayout: Amodal scene layout from a single image\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate MonoLayout-static against Schulter et al. [ref]34 and MonoOccupancy  on the task of static scene (road/sidewalk) layout estimation. Note that Schulter et al. assume that the input image is first passed through monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation networks, while we operate directly on raw pixel intensities. Table 1 summarizes the performance of existing road layout estimation approaches (Schulter et al. [ref]34, MonoOccupancy ) on the KITTI Raw and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. For KITTI Raw, we follow the exact split used in Schulter et al. and retrain MonoOccupancy and MonoLayout-static on this train split. Since the manual annotations for semantic classes for KITTI Raw aren’t publicly available, we manually annotated sequences with semantic labels (and will make them publicly available). From Table 1 (c.f. “KITTI Raw\"), we see that MonoLayout-static outperforms both MonoOccupancy  and Schulter et al. [ref]34 by a significant margin. We attribute this to the strong hallucination capabilities of MonoLayout-static due to adversarial feature learning (c.f. Fig. 2). Although Schulter et al. [ref]34 use a discriminator to regularize layout predictions, they seem to suffer from cascading errors due to sequential processing blocks (eg. depth, semantics extraction). MonoOccupancy  does not output sharp estimates of road boundaries by virtue of being a variational autoencoder (VAE), as mean-squared error objectives and Gaussian prior assumptions often result in blurry generation of samples [ref]23. The hallucination capability is much more evident in the occluded region evaluation, where we see that MonoLayout-static improves by more than 10%percent1010\\% on prior art.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: We evaluate MonoLayout-static against Schulter et al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
