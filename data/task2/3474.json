Multilingualism plays a very important role in these systems because we don’t have one language to deal with, in regard to resumes and job-seeking activities [ref]173. Resumes to job description matching systems in a are difficult to find especially when they have to deal with a single language. To figure out interpretable figures, and make the best use of multilingual text, one major focus of the project is to derive useful and semantic knowledge. Table 3 show the recommendation base, multilingual matching models. Lexicon differs with respect to the languages and learning the lexicon from one language to another is a difficult task i.e., English lexicons are different than Turkish . Bal et al.  analyzed Turkish job advertisements and tried to identify the structure of the common sentences to create some rule patterns to extract. They addressed the difficulties encountered such as the Turkish verbs are at the end of the sentence, whereas in English, verbs are at the middle of the sentence. Multiple solutions for JD/Resume matching were proposed to treat several individual languages in the literature i.e., , Indonesian , Vietnamese , Brazilian , Belgium , Spanish , Chinese . Cross-lingual may be a solution. Cross-lingual embedding represents words in multiple languages, they are crucial for task scaling of multiple languages by transferring knowledge from high resource languages i.e., English to low resource language i.e., German and Dutch .\nLena et al.  evaluated the embeddings that are on the sequence labeling tasks of parsing CV and they also show the size of a bilingual dictionary, frequency of dictionary words along with performance measures. The researchers have conducted an experiment on Dutch-English and German-English cross-lingual embeddings. They used Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) linear projection in a monolingual vector to estimate Dutch/German embeddings in terms of English space. Subsequently, these embeddings are used for the sequence model. The sequence model is always trained in terms of English space. The data used for training is either English data along with the Dutch/German training data or just English training data. Once the model is created to support multilingualism, it is tested Dutch/German test data. Several other factors have been considered for experimenting with bilingual dictionaries like size, data source, and bilingual dictionary frequency. The French and English multilingual aspect was considered by Malherbe and Aufaure  proposed a knowledge base architecture (English and French) of skills that is extracted (job offer, resumes) from the job offer website. The crawled data was filtered to include skills data based on the term frequency in the corpus. After formalizing these documents, the system is coupled with external sources of information that are named as Stack-Overflow and DBpedia. A normalization technique was applied to associate each job offer and profile with the corresponding skills base. The link was based on having the same alias between the tags of Stack-Overflow and the concepts in DBpedia. The very 1st step was to process the skill terminologies obtained from English and French sources for which a hypothesis “to use an expression that appears frequently in the skills field content of the profiles” was proposed. The 2nd step of the framework is based on extracting the related concepts in specially chosen knowledge graphs, namely DBpedia and Stack-Overflow tags. Most of the data uploaded by a candidate are in unstructured text form. Their extraction of multilingual skills using their proposed approach was able to reach 80% . Celik  presented a semantic-based extraction system for matching resumes for any job opening to gather important information from the resumes. The study proposed an ontology-o=based resume Parser (ORP) system for Turkish and English language used in resumes along with concept-matching tasks, the data is analyzed semantically, and then it is parsed with important information like education, experience, business, and features. The study was divided into 6 major steps, starting with the conversion of the resume, partitioning it into segments, then parsing important data from input, normalizing that data, after that applying clustering and classification tasks to focus on the important sections of the resumes. The framework used is based on SWRL and provides a formal OWL ontology with rules in the abstract syntax. Jaro-Winkler distance algorithm was used to detect incorrectly spelled words. Added to that, they ensure multilingualism in this research by translating items from the different ontologies and assigning tags labels of English or Turkish languages. Tamburri et al.  presented a DataOps model based on agile practice in skills extraction from resumes and jobs, featuring machine learning models. The researchers have applied a DataOps pipeline for skills extraction constructed from five steps (Data Pre-processing, Sentences Annotation for Learning, Model Training, fine-tuning training, and prediction). Their experiment is directed on using BERT cloud base-model pre-trained in English  and fine-tuned with annotated sentences extracted from vacancies. They applied their model to a Dutch-Flemish cross-border labor market for job seekers. Linkedin proposed a method to make users profiles in other languages and create another profile in the preferred language. Moreover, users can set the language that their profile will be displayed, and Linkedin does not translate the content or messages. People viewing a profile can choose from the language a profile owner setup before 141414https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140710185825-25298675-multilingual-create-a-secondary-language-profile-on-linkedin/. To summarise, with the growth of powerful pretrained language models i.e., BERT, the need to fine-tune in a specific field or even in a specific required language to train such model to identify the features i.e., skills. To do so, a dataset needs to be labeled to fine-tune a pretrained model. Tamburri et al.  used a specific dataset gathered from parsing JD/Resume and labeled manually via a domain expert and this labeled dataset became the standards dataset used in the fine-tuning. However, such sources are not enough to cover enough knowledge, also, expensive for manual labeling. In our proposed method, the use of reach multilingual ontology/knowledge base is required to be used in labeling JD/Resume for fine-tuning BERT language model purposes.\n\nReference markers found: [173]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]173: attention of many researchers.
