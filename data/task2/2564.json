      "content": "Paper Title: RANK-NOSH: Efficient Predictor-Based Architecture Search via Non-Uniform Successive Halving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeural Architecture Search has demonstrated its effectiveness in discovering high-performance architectures for various computer vision tasks, including image classification [ref]6 3 [ref]44, semantic segmentation  , and image generation   .\nConcretely, NAS methods attempt to identify the best architecture from a vast search space according to a predefined performance metric (e.g., accuracy, latency, etc.).\nPioneering works in this field require training and evaluating thousands of architectures in the search space   .\nFor example, the reinforcement learning method proposed by Zoph et al.Â  trains over 20,000 networks.\nThe tremendous amount of computation overhead largely limits their practical usage.\nSince then, improving the efficiency of architecture search algorithms has become a central topic in the NAS community. Recently, weight-sharing technique witnesses much success in improving the search efficiency of NAS   3 9 [ref]44.\nThose methods train a supernet that encompasses all architectures in the search space, and use the pretrained supernet to evaluate the performance of architectures.\nDespite their search efficiency, weight-sharing methods are not generally applicable to arbitrary search spaces due to the restrictions in constructing supernets 7 .\nMoreover, they also suffer from various inductive biases caused by the weight-sharing mechanism [ref]6    , which has a tendency towards parameter-free operations and wide, shallow structures. On the other hand, predictor-based NAS methods are free from the aforementioned disadvantages.\nStarting from a pool of randomly selected architectures, previous methods iteratively conduct the following steps: 1) train and evaluate all the architectures in the pool fully; 2) fit a surrogate performance predictor; 3) use the predictor to propose new architectures and add them to the pool for the next round   .\nCompared with previous RL and evolution-based NAS methods, using a performance predictor can reduce the number of networks evaluated from scratch.\nHowever, training all the architectures in the candidate pool fully is still extremely computationally expensive.\nMost complementary advances alone this line focus on developing better predictors that require a smaller training pool   , but the potential to further cut down the search cost by reducing the training length of individual architectures in the pool has not drawn much attention. In this work, we aim to investigate the possibility of reducing the search cost of predictor-based NAS by reducing the number of epochs required to train every architecture in the candidate pool.\nInspired by successive halving , our key idea is that the learning process of poor architectures can be terminated early to avoid wasting budgets.\nHowever, it is non-trivial to integrate successive halving to predictor-based NAS formulations.\nFirstly, predictor-based algorithms iteratively add new architectures to the candidate pool   , whereas regular successive halving only removes underperforming candidates from the initial pool.\nSecondly, with successive halving, architectures in the pool will be trained for different number of epochs, so their validation accuracy are not directly comparable in a semantically meaningful way.\nStandard regression-based predictor fitting, which requires the exact validation accuracy for each architecture when fully trained, will be problematic in this setting.\n To tackle those challenges in a unified way, we propose RANK-NOSH, an efficient predictor-based framework with significantly improved search efficiency.\nRANK-NOSH consists of two parts.\nThe first part is NOn-Uniform Successive Halving (NOSH), which describes a multi-level scheduling algorithm that allows adding new candidates and resuming terminated training process.\nIt is non-uniform in the sense that NOSH maintains a pyramid-like candidate pool of architectures trained for various epochs without discarding any candidates.\nFor the second part, we construct architecture pairs and use a pairwise ranking loss to train the performance predictor.\nThe predictor is essentially a ranking network and can efficiently distill useful information from our candidate pool consisting of architectures trained for different epochs.\nMoreover, the proposed framework naturally integrates recently developed proxies that measure architecture performance without training   5, which allows more architectures to be included in the candidate pool at no cost. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple search spaces, datasets, and budgets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method.\nOn DARTS space, NAS-Bench-101, and NAS-Bench-201, RANK-NOSH can reduce the search budget of SOTA predictor-based methods by 5x while achieving similar or even better results.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Neural Architecture Search has demonstrated its effectiveness in discovering high-performance architectures for various computer vision tasks, including image classification [ref]6 3 [ref]44, semantic segmentation  , and image generation   .\nConcretely, NAS methods attempt to identify the best architecture from a vast search space according to a predefined performance\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
