Image-based rendering aims to render novel views directly from input images and can be broadly categorized into methods which use geometry explicitly, methods which use geometry implicitly, and methods which do not use geometry at all. Classical techniques based on explicit geometry are texture-mapped models. Layered depth images (LDIs) , lumigraphs [ref]5, flow-based , and tensor-based methods  implicitly use geometry, while light-field methods 0 try to avoid using geometry. Hybrid methods  have also long been studied. More recently deep nets have been used for image-based rendering. Among the most widely used techniques are neural radiance fields (NeRF)  and multi-plane images (MPI) . Both have in common that they aim to extract from a given set of images a volumetric representation of the observed scene. While the volumetric representation is discrete for MPI and permits fast rendering, NeRF uses a continuous field to represent the volume. Studying these representations for editing applications is an exciting direction. EditNeRF looked at modifying the colors and shape of a conditional radiance field given user scribbles . Guo et al.  looked at composing photo-realistic scenes of captured objects. Yang et al. [ref]50 leverage 2D object instance masks to train a compositional model for repositioning objects in a scene. Our goal is to use this volumetric representation for interactive object segmentation given user scribbles. We think these representations are particularly useful for this application and permit more accurate recovery of the object than the classical 2D and 3D interactive segmentation techniques discussed before. We note a contemporary effort that obtains (non-interactive) object segmentation in synthetic scenes by using unsupervised learning for object radiance fields [ref]53. Our work is the first that studies the use of these representations for interactive object selection in real-world scenes.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: which use geometry implicitly, and methods which do not use geometry at all.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
