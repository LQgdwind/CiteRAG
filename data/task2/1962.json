      "content": "Paper Title: Contrastive Learning and Self-Training for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNetwork Architecture: Similar to [ref]40 8    [ref]20   we deploy the DeepLab-V2  framework with a ResNet-101 as feature extractor ‚Ñ±‚Ñ±\\mathcal{F}. As is common practice, we initialize ‚Ñ±‚Ñ±\\mathcal{F} with weights pre-trained on ImageNet and freeze all batch normalization layers. The final segmentation head ùíüùíü\\mathcal{D} consists of an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) head. We fix the dilation rates of the ASPP head to {6, 12, 18, 24} as it was done in previous work. To create a symmetrical network architecture, we use a similar ASPP head for the projector ùí´ùí´\\mathcal{P} as described before. The only difference is that the projector outputs a tensor with K‚Ä≤=256superscriptùêæ‚Ä≤256K^{\\prime}=256 channels and does not use any non-linearity. Implementation Details:\nOur implementation adopts the PyTorch deep learning framework . Most of the hyperparameters are taken directly from the base architecture from 8. We train the network using SGD with Nesterov acceleration to speed up convergence. We deploy a polynomial learning rate decay with an initial learning rate set to 2.5√ó10‚àí42.5superscript1042.5\\times 10^{-4} and an exponent of 0.90.90.9. The momentum of the optimizer is set to 0.90.90.9 and we use a weight decay of 5√ó10‚àí45superscript1045\\times 10^{-4}. Furthermore, we use 0.10.10.1 for both ŒªS‚ÄãTsubscriptùúÜùëÜùëá\\lambda_{ST} and ŒªC‚ÄãLsubscriptùúÜùê∂ùêø\\lambda_{CL}. For the momentum term œàùúì\\psi in Eq. 8 we use a cosine decay starting from 0.020.020.02. For training and testing, we rescale all source images to size 720√ó12807201280720\\times 1280 and all target images to 512√ó10245121024512\\times 1024 8. In addition, we also investigate the impact of color jittering and Gaussian blur, which was recently used in 7. We train our model using batches with 2 source images and 2 target images. The model is pre-trained for 666k iterations on the source domain before we switch to the loss function from Eq. 10. The pseudo-labels from the temporal ensemble are used after 151515k iterations. Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma is initially set to 1 and incremented by 1 every 252525k iterations. All iteration-related parameters were chosen to be approximately multiples of the number of target images and received no tuning. We set Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta to 555, which limits the weighting of classes that occur in less than 20%percent2020\\% of the images in the dataset. This was set by inspecting the class occurence probabilities in the GTA5 dataset and was also not tuned. Datasets and Metric: We evaluate our approach in the challenging synthetic-to-real scenario, where Cityscapes  is used as the real-world target domain. Cityscapes contains 2975 training and 500 validation images with a resolution of 1024√ó2048102420481024\\times 2048. One of the synthetic source datasets is GTA5 , which contains 24966 synthesized frames of size 1052√ó1914105219141052\\times 1914 of the well known Grand Theft Auto V video game. We evaluate GTA5 ‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrow Cityscapes using the common 19 classes. The second synthetic source dataset is SYNTHIA 0, which has 9400 images in total and only shares 16 classes with Cityscapes. Following [ref]40  [ref]20 7 , we evaluate this transfer with respect to all 16 classes and for a subset consisting of 13 classes. We train our model using all source images and evaluate it on the Cityscapes validation set. As a metric, we use the widely adopted mean-intersection-over-union (mIoU).\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: Network Architecture: Similar to [ref]40 8    [ref]20   we deploy the DeepLab-V2  framework with a ResNet-101 as feature extractor ‚Ñ±‚Ñ±\\mathcal{F}.
