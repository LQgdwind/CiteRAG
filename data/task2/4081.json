      "content": "Paper Title: An Adaptive Federated Relevance Framework for Spatial Temporal Graph Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe main issues in the existing work are two-fold: The deep learning approaches like CNN-based (FDCCNN  ) and RNN-based (ConvLSTM , Bi-LSTM [ref]5) are effective in processing spatial and temporal data separately. However, they have limitations when it comes to modelling the complex relationships and dependencies between different spatial and temporal entities. For example, it might be challenging for RNN-based approaches to model complex spatial relationships between different entities in a sequence, as they are designed primarily for modeling temporal dependencies. On the other hand, GNN-based methods (GCRN [ref]10, ST-GCN [ref]11, CGCN ) enable the modeling of complex relationships between entities through the use of graphs. Nevertheless, they are not able to utilise the underlying topological graph structures and temporal transition information in the spatial-temporal data simultaneously, which impedes them from achieving better learning performance. Federated learning algorithms like FedAvg , FedP 8 and FedAtt 7 can realise collaborative training involving multiple parties without exposing local data to others to preserve data privacy. As an emerging field, the research that incorporates GNN-based approaches to federated learning is starting to gain attraction with several algorithms (FASTGNN 9 and CNFGNN ) proposed recently. Still, it remains imperative to investigate methods for enhancing collaborative graph modeling capability on spatial-temporal attributes from the provided raw data . To solve the aforementioned problem, we introduce dynamic inter-intra graph learning to encode the spatial-temporal data. Specifically, intra-graph learning is designed to capture the spatial node correlations within a single graph snapshot generated at each timestamp, while inter-graph learning can learn the temporal node correlations across multiple graphs. Moreover, relevance-based federated learning is designed to expedite collaborative graph learning. The relevance of each participant herein is determined by adaptively attending the distance scores between local data distribution and the approximated global distributions. It thus puts more attention on the participants with divergent data distributions, from which the model’s generalisation ability can be improved.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: The main issues in the existing work are two-fold: The deep learning approaches like CNN-based (FDCCNN  ) and RNN-based (ConvLSTM , Bi-LSTM [ref]5) are effective in processing spatial and temporal data separately.
