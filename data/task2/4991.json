      "content": "Paper Title: DynamicISP: Dynamically Controlled Image Signal Processor for Image Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, many ISPs that utilize machine learning have been\nproposed. They can be broadly classified into two categories: methods\nthat tune the classical ISP functions and methods that replace them\nwith a DNN-based encoder-decoder model. In the first category, they tune the existing ISP parameters using\nmachine learning techniques. It defines perceptual loss or image recognition\nloss, depending on the goal, to increase perceptual quality or recognition\naccuracy. In some cases, evolutionary algorithms [ref]34  \nor other search methods  are applied\nbecause most existing ISPs are black-box and the search space of the\nparameters have multiple local minima [ref]42.\nHowever, these methods optimize only ISP parameters for a fixed downstream\npart, and the performance gain is limited. To partly address the problem,\na work proposes a joint training schedule wherein ISP and downstream\nCNN are optimized alternately while the other is fixed .\nOther methods optimize the parameters with gradient-based backpropagation\n [ref]32 . Although\nwe mentioned NeuralAE [ref]32 controls auto-exposure\nwith DNN, ISP parameters are trained with backpropagation as static\nparameters. ReconfigISP  not only optimizes\nthe hyperparameters but also explores functions by a neural architecture\nsearch method . It is important to note that the\ncomputational costs of this category are low because their ISPs for\ninference time consist of classical functions. We argue that the problem\nwith these methods is the lack of expressive power compared with the\nother category. In the other category, methods creates an ISP with encoder-decoder-based\nDNN. Recently, tremendous model architectures are proposed as an ISP\nfunction replacement, such as denoiser  ,\ncolor constancy  , and deblurring\n . Some works propose generic\nmodels that can replace various functions with the same architecture\n , while several others replace the\nwhole ISP pipeline with DNN    .\nThough DNN-based ISPs and ISP functions achieve state-of-the-art,\nthe computational cost remains an issue especially when high-resolution\noutputs are necessary. Currently, smartphones are one of the major\nuse cases of ISPs, thus low computational cost ISPs are highly desired. Based on the above, we propose a dynamic ISP control method that doesn't\nmatch either of these two categories. By dynamically controlling parameters,\nclassical ISPs are empowered with a minimal computational cost. Our\nmethod is possible to optimize from ISP to image recognition end-to-end,\ngoing beyond the usual individal optimization of the ISP and the recognition\nmodel.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: learning techniques.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
