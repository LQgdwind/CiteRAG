      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Sequence Packing without Cross-contamination: Accelerating Large Language Models without Impacting Performance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe most obvious way to reduce the extent of padding in the dataset is to group samples by size before batching (SORT),\ni.e., process the shorter samples together and longer samples together.\nBERT\nis pre-trained in two phases,\nwhere the first phase uses sequence length 128128128 for 900900900K steps and the second phase uses sequence length 512512512 for 100100100K steps.\nHowever even by splitting the training in this way, the wasted compute due to padding is approximately 20%percent2020\\% (see Figure¬†1).\nOther examples of this ‚Äúsorted batching‚Äù approach can be found in\nFaster Transformer¬†, lingvo¬†8 fairseq¬†, and RoBERTa¬†,\nwhich group samples of similar size together in one batch and fill up with padding only to the maximum length in this batch.\nThis approach can be highly efficient\nin cases where the dataset length is multiple orders of magnitude larger than the batch size and the number of different sequence lengths. Despite its high computational efficiency, this approach has multiple drawbacks.\nWe outline these below and propose an alternative which maintains the high efficiency,\nwhile also circumventing the downsides.\nFirstly, sorting the data can reduce the overall convergence speed when the batch size is large\nbecause it violates the i.i.d. assumption on the data distribution¬† [ref]18.\nSecondly, processing batches with shorter sequence lengths under-utilizes the compute\ncompared to running the same batch size with a longer sequence length.\nFor GPUs, a common heuristic to mitigate this effect is to adjust the batch size\nto keep the number of processed tokens near constant¬† .\nIn general however, the relationship between the sequence length and the optimum batch size is more complex\nand maximizing compute utilization can require the model\nto be sharded differently across multiple accelerators.\nAvoiding this, often manual process, is important for ease of use\nand the portability of methods across different hardware architectures.\nThirdly, modern NLP applications are optimized\nand compiled for fixed tensor sizes using tools such as XLA¬† [ref]9, which provides a ‚âà7‚Äãxabsent7ùë•\\approx 7x\nacceleration for BERT in MLPerf‚Ñ¢¬† compared to the non-XLA baseline¬†.\nChanging the sequence length or batch size requires re-optimization of the computational graph and recompilation of the program for the new tensor shapes.\nFor complex models such as BERT, optimization and recompilation take a non-negligible amount of time.\nEven if one pre-compiled and cached all combinations of batch size and sequence length,\nthe kernels would still need to be re-uploaded to the device every time the shapes change.\nDepending on how frequently the tensor shapes change, the overhead from switching kernels adds up.\nTo avoid these issues, it is preferable (and common) to work with fixed tensor shapes for the entire duration of the training run. More advanced approaches for reducing the padding overhead rely on custom computational kernels.\nLoosely these are referred to as ‚Äúun-padding‚Äù approaches.\nIn Effective Transformer¬†, the input batch is provided as a padded matrix but padding values are dynamically removed and restored during different calculation stages.\nWhile un-padding implementations are highly sophisticated and are able to completely circumvent the processing of padding tokens, they introduce a significant overhead due to the multiple GPU kernel launches (i.e., one kernel per sequence rather than one kernel per batch).\nAdditionally the time to process each batch will fluctuate depending on the sequence lengths in each batch,\ni.e., batches with only shorter sequences will typically be processed faster.\nWhen working with more than one accelerator, this variability in throughput results in all devices in the cluster\nwaiting for the device with the most compute intensive batch to finish processing.\nAs such, un-padding approaches are not appropriate for deployment on large clusters.\nThe ‚Äúpacking‚Äù based approach introduced in this paper offers significant advantages over un-padding approaches.\nFirstly, packing is implemented directly at the framework level and requires no additional custom kernel implementations.\nSecondly, the processing time for each batch is independent of the content of the batch, allowing the packing based approach to maintain the same speed-up whether running on a single device or thousands. While we demonstrate the effectiveness of packing specifically on the Wikipedia dataset,\npacking SQuAD¬†5 or GLUE datasets¬† \nfor BERT also leads to significant speed-ups (some in excess of 9x)\n(Sections¬†K and¬†L).\nThe effectiveness of packing is a result of\nboth the length distribution of the documents in the source datasets\nas well as the different text preprocessing steps for BERT ¬†.\nThe use of bi-directional self-attention in BERT implies that the input sequences should contain complete sentences.\nIf a sentence is abruptly cut short,\nthe hidden state on other (preceding) tokens in the sequence will be affected.\nLanguage models with causal attention (only attending to previous tokens in the input)\ndo not have this issue to the same degree.\nFor such models, if a sequence is cut short at an arbitrary token,\nthe other tokens (which occur earlier in the sequence) will not be affected.\nThis ability to cut sequences arbitrarily completely trivializes the packing problem for models based on causal attention.\nFor instance, GPT-3¬† is trained with a maximum sequence length of 204820482048\nwhere a single sequence may contain multiple segments of sentences separated by a special end of segment token.\nThe last segment in each sequence is simply cut to meet the sequence length requirement\nmaking the packing problem trivial and avoiding any padding.\nIn the interest of computational efficiency GPT-3 does not mask the attention between different segments in a sequence.\nIn contrast, the packing approach presented in this paper introduces a mask in the attention layer\n(see Section¬†3.2.2) to prevent cross-contamination between examples in a pack.\nNote, we mask the interaction between different sequences\nand not between different sentences or segments in the same sequence.\nThis ensures that the characteristics of the original dataset and model are matched as closely as possible.\nRoBERTa and many other models in production like T5¬†4\nuse a similar packing approach as GPT-3,\ncombining full sentences/sequences with GREEDY packing (first come first concatenate)\nand also separation tokens or additional padding.\nThe RoBERTa ablation study shows that mixing of sentences from different\ndocuments reduces accuracy, but it is used nonetheless for load balancing reasons\nwhich indicates that sorted batching is not sufficient. There might be hidden code snippets as in the deprecated tensor2tensor library\nthat seems to implement the same attention masking mechanism as we propose.\nHowever, these lack a sufficient documentation, testing, evaluation, ablation,\nand communication to the research community to be considered state of the art in NLP research.\nMore general, to the best of our knowledge and the knowledge of many other engineers\nand researchers that we were in contact with,\nthere is no other research work that focuses on packing in NLP.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: also circumventing the downsides.\nFirstly, sorting the data can reduce the overall convergence speed when the batch size is large\nbecause it violates the i.i.d. assumption on the data distribution¬† [ref]18.\nSecondly, processing batches with shorter sequence lengths under-utilizes the compute\ncompared to running the same batch size with a longer sequence length.\nFor GPUs, a common heuristic to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
