      "content": "Paper Title: YOLO-based Object Detection in Industry 4.0 Fischertechnik Model Environment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA distinct advantage of YOLOv3 compared to YOLOv1 is its multi scale prediction capability. This is achieved by adopting Darknet-535353 [ref]4, which originally has 535353 layer network trained on ImageNet . For detection task, 535353 more layers are stacked on top of it, giving us a 106106106 layer fully convolutional underlying architecture for YOLOv3. Across the stacked-Darknet with 106106106 layers, the up-sampling and concatenation methods are used three times where feature maps of sizes 13×13×255131325513\\times 13\\times 255, 26×26×255262625526\\times 26\\times 255 and 52×52×255525225552\\times 52\\times 255 are produced. As reported in [ref]30 and to produce these feature maps, their corresponding feature maps from two previous layers are up-sampled by scale of 444 and then concatenated with their corresponding earlier feature maps from the network. As authors of [ref]30 claim, adoption of this technique, schematically shown as Fig. 4(a), called Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)  is to obtain meaningful semantic information from the up-sampled features and finer-grained information from the earlier feature maps. It is noteworthy that, in case of dealing with scaled 13×13131313\\times 13, 26×26262626\\times 26 or 52×52525252\\times 52 feature maps to detect on different scales, the located grid cells on input image also need to have the same dimensionality so that a one to one correspondence among the cell numbers within the input image and the scaled feature maps hold true. In this case, each grid cell within the input image still stays responsible to account for an object centroid that it contains, and at the last layer its corresponding 1×1×255112551\\times 1\\times 255 predictor tensor will be interpreted to find the suitable bounding box and class label. In YOLOv3, each output tensor of size 1×1×255112551\\times 1\\times 255 comprises B=3𝐵3B=3 number of bounding boxes each represented with six attributes, namely the centroid coordinates, the dimensions, the objectness score and the last one to be a set of 808080 [ref]20 number of conditional class confidences. As YOLOv3 predicts on three different scales, in total nine number of “derived” bounding boxes are predicted. The derivation is in fact performed from a set of the so called “anchor boxes” that already provided to YOLOv3 by the “dimension clusters” pre-processing stage . The main motivation behind the anchor boxes is to have a limited set of prior-shapes deduced from the dataset and the ground truth boxes at hand, so that during the training phase the ground truth boxes are compared against them and a transformation between the prior and ground truth boxes are learnt. Here, the anchor box that has the highest IOU with the ground truth box will be chosen to train the model. A K-means clustering  approach selects in total nine anchor boxes on different scales as the mean anchor box of each of the nine established clusters on different scales and with respect to the COCO dataset [ref]20. The main advantage of prior boxes is to make YOLOv3 capable of predicting multiple objects with their shapes to have different height and width aspect ratios on varying scales. The desired learnt transformation to the anchor boxes is applied as with bxsubscript𝑏𝑥b_{x}, bysubscript𝑏𝑦b_{y}, bwsubscript𝑏𝑤b_{w}, bhsubscript𝑏ℎb_{h} are the coordinate centre, width and height of the final predicted box after the transformation along with txsubscript𝑡𝑥t_{x}, tysubscript𝑡𝑦t_{y}, twsubscript𝑡𝑤t_{w}, thsubscript𝑡ℎt_{h} to be the the predicted values of the box by model. The cxsubscript𝑐𝑥c_{x} and cysubscript𝑐𝑦c_{y} are the top-left coordinates of the corresponding grid cell and pwsubscript𝑝𝑤p_{w} and phsubscript𝑝ℎp_{h} are the anchor box dimensions. Note that, in some cases the model produces centroid coordinates cxsubscript𝑐𝑥c_{x} and cysubscript𝑐𝑦c_{y} to be located in neighbor cells, that are brought back to the current cell by applying a sigmoid function σ𝜎\\sigma. Also the exponential function is used to correct the obtained dimensions thsubscript𝑡ℎt_{h} and twsubscript𝑡𝑤t_{w} of the box if they are produced as negative values by the model, so that they can be transformed to the suitable anchor box during the training phase.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: A distinct advantage of YOLOv3 compared to YOLOv1 is its multi scale prediction capability.
