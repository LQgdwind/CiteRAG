      "content": "Paper Title: Skeleton Prototype Contrastive Learning with Multi-Level Graph Relation Modeling for Unsupervised Person Re-Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost recently, a few works exploit deep learning paradigms to learn gait representations from skeleton data for person re-ID in a supervised or self-supervised manner.\nLiao et al.  propose PoseGait, which feeds 81 hand-crafted pose features of 3D skeletons into CNN for human recognition. Rao et al. [ref]19 devise a self-supervised attention-based gait encoding (AGE) model with multi-layer LSTM to encode gait features from unlabeled skeleton sequences, and then fine-tune the learned features with the supervision of labels for person re-ID. In [ref]20, they further propose a locality-awareness approach (SGELA) that combines various pretext tasks (e.g.,formulae-sequenceùëíùëîe.g., reverse sequential reconstruction) and contrastive learning scheme to enhance self-supervised gait representation learning for the person re-ID task.\nThe latest self-supervised work is SM-SGE [ref]22, which utilizes a skeleton graph based reconstruction and inference mechanism to encode discriminative skeleton structure and motion features for  the person re-ID task. Our work differs  in following aspects. We for the first time propose an unsupervised learning paradigm to learn discriminative skeleton representations from unlabeled skeleton data to directly perform person re-ID. Our approach requires neither any form of feature engineering (e.g.,formulae-sequenceùëíùëîe.g., hand-crafted skeleton descriptors   ) nor any skeleton label for training model   or fine-tuning representations [ref]19 [ref]20 [ref]22. Unlike most existing works that directly represent skeletons as sequences of body joints [ref]19 [ref]20 or pose descriptors , this work not only explores more comprehensive body-structure modeling by devising unified and  generalized multi-level skeleton graphs, but also systematically mines valuable body-component relations at various levels. Besides, the proposed approach needs neither self-supervised pretext tasks (e.g.,formulae-sequenceùëíùëîe.g., reconstruction [ref]22) for pre-training or supervised classification networks for discriminative representation learning. Instead, it exploits the unsupervised skeleton prototype contrastive learning to mine representative skeleton features and class-related semantics from unlabeled 3D skeleton data. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first attempt to leverage skeleton graph based relation modeling and contrastive learning to realize  both skeleton representation learning and unsupervised person re-ID.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: data for person re-ID in a supervised or self-supervised manner.\nLiao et al.  propose PoseGait, which feeds 81 hand-crafted pose features of 3D skeletons into CNN for human recognition.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
