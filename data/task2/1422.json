      "content": "Paper Title: Energy-constrained Self-training for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks are usually data-starved and rely on the i.i.dformulae-sequence𝑖𝑖𝑑i.i.d assumption of training and testing data   [ref]3     . However, in reality, the deployment target tasks are usually significantly diverse, and collecting labeled data in the target domain is expensive or even prohibitive. For instance, densely annotating a Cityscapes image on average takes about 90 minutes , which severely hinders the generalization of an autonomous driving system in different cities. Therefore, the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from one labeled source domain to another target domain with the aid of unlabeled target data 0. Recently, one of the promising methods in UDA is the self-training 1 2, which iteratively generates a set of one-hot pseudo-labels in the target domain, and then retrains network based on these pseudo-labels with target data. Previous research of deep self-training usually adopts the one-hot pseudo-label, and evidence that it is essentially an entropy minimization process 1 that pushing network output to be as sharp as hard pseudo-label. However, the correctness of pseudo-labels cannot be guaranteed. Trusting all selected pseudo-labels as “ground truth” by encoding them as hard labels can lead to overconfident mistakes and propagated errors 2. Actually, the state-of-the-art accuracy of many UDA benchmarks are just around 50%. Especially at the first few epochs, it is hard to produce reliable pseudo-label. Besides, the labels of natural images can also be highly ambiguous. Taking a sample image from VisDA17 3 (see Fig. 1) as an example, both person and car dominate significant portions of this image. Enforcing a model to be very confident in only one of the classes during training can also hurt the learning behavior 4, particularly within the context of no ground truth label for the target samples. The manually defined pseudo label smoothing or entropy minimization are proposed to make the network more conservative 2. Essentially, our previous work 2 is modifying the inaccurate pseudo label histogram distribution to be more smooth following a fixed smoothing operation for any data. For instance, revising the three-classes one-hot pseudo label  [ref]0  [ref]0 [ref]0 or [ref]0  [ref]0  [ref]0 to [0.9,0.05,0.05]0.90.050.05[0.9,0.05,0.05] or [0.05,0.9,0.05]0.050.90.05[0.05,0.9,0.05]. However, these constraints for pseudo-label can not be adaptively adjusted for different inputs or network parameters. The aforementioned issues motivate us to introduce a regularization signal for the target sample that depends on the input and the network parameters at the present training iteration, and not related to the inaccurate pseudo label. Recent study 5 points out that a standard discriminative classifier can be essentially reinterpreted as an energy-based model (EBM) for the joint distribution p​(𝐱,𝐲)𝑝𝐱𝐲p(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}) 6 7 8 9. Both the energy-based model and supervised discriminative model can be benefited from simultaneously optimizing both p​(𝐲|𝐱)𝑝conditional𝐲𝐱p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{x}) with cross-entropy (CE) loss and optimizing log​p​(𝐱)log𝑝𝐱{\\rm log}p(\\mathbf{x}) with EBM 5. Here, we demonstrate that optimizing log​p​(𝐱)log𝑝𝐱{\\rm log}p(\\mathbf{x}) can be even more promising on self-training-based UDA. Since we do not have reliable labels on target domain, and log​p​(𝐱)log𝑝𝐱{\\rm log}p(\\mathbf{x}) can be an idea regularization signal, which is correlated with the input 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} and network parameter, and independent to pseudo label 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y}. Therefore, we propose a simple and straightforward idea that configures the energy minimization of data point 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} (i.e., log​p​(𝐱)log𝑝𝐱{\\rm log}p(\\mathbf{x})) as an additional regularization term. The target domain examples are optimized with pseudo-label CE loss and EBM objective. With the help of the energy-based model, our self-training is expected to be more controllable. In this paper, we propose a novel and intuitive framework to incorporate the EBM into the self-training UDA as pseudo label-irrelevant adaptive regularization signal. We empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method on multiple challenging benchmarks (classification and semantic segmentation) and achieve state-of-the-art performance.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Deep neural networks are usually data-starved and rely on the i.i.dformulae-sequence𝑖𝑖𝑑i.i.d assumption of training and testing data   [ref]3     .
