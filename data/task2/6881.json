      "content": "Paper Title: Computation-efficient Deep Learning for Computer Vision: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the past decade, the field of computer vision has experienced significant advancements in deep learning. Innovations in model architectures and learning algorithms [ref]1 [ref]2 [ref]3     have allowed deep networks to approach or even exceed human-level performance on benchmark competition datasets for a wide range of visual tasks, such as image recognition  , object detection , image segmentation  , video understanding  , and 3D perception . This considerable progress has stimulated interest in deploying deep models in practical applications, including self-driving cars, mobile devices, robotics, unmanned aerial vehicles, and internet of things devices   . However, the demands of real-world applications are distinct from those of competitions. Models achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in competitions often exhibit computational intensity and resource requirements during inference. In contrast, computation is typically equivalent to practical latency, power consumption, and carbon emissions. Low-latency or real-time inference is crucial for ensuring security and enhancing user experience    . Deep learning systems must prioritize low power consumption to improve battery life or reduce energy costs    . Minimizing carbon emissions is also essential for environmental considerations  . Motivated by these practical challenges, a substantial portion of recent literature focuses on achieving a balance between effectiveness and computational efficiency. Ideally, deep learning models should yield accurate predictions while minimizing the computational cost during inference. This topic has given rise to numerous intriguing research questions and garnered significant attention from both academic and industrial sectors. In light of these developments, this survey presents a comprehensive and systematic review of the exploration towards computationally efficient deep learning. Our aim is to provide an overview of this rapidly evolving field, summarize recent advances, and identify important challenges and potential directions for future research. Specifically, we will discuss existing works from the perspective of the following five directions: 1) Efficient Backbone Models.\nDesigning light-weighted backbone networks that effectively extract discriminative deep representations from images, videos or 3D scenes with minimal computation by optimizing both efficient network micro-architectures (e.g., operators, modules, and layers)    and improving the system-level organization of micro-architectures  . Recent advances in neural architecture search (NAS)   have further enabled the automatic design of backbones. 2) Dynamic Deep Networks.\nDeveloping dynamic networks is an important emerging research direction for improving computational efficiency. These networks break the limits of static computational graphs and propose adapting their structures or parameters to the input during inference . For example, the model can selectively activate certain model components (e.g., layers , channels , and sub-networks ) based on each test input or allocate less computation to less informative spatial/temporal regions    of each input. 3) Task-specialized Efficient Models.\nNumerous works focus on building task-specific heads on top of the features from light-weighted static/dynamic backbones to efficiently accomplish specific computer vision tasks. Examples include fast one-stage models for real-time object detection 0 1 2 3, the efficient multi-branch architecture for semantic segmentation 4, and end-to-end instance segmentation frameworks 5 6. 4) Model Compression Techniques.\nOrthogonal to network architecture design, many algorithms have been proposed to compress relatively large models with minimal accuracy loss. This can be achieved by pruning less important network components 7 8, quantizing parameters 9 0, or distilling knowledge from large models to smaller models of interest 1 2. 5) Efficient Deployment on Hardware.\nTo achieve high practical efficiency, it is necessary to consider hardware requirements when developing deep learning applications. Reducing latency on specific hardware devices is usually treated as an objective in network design 3 4 or algorithm-hardware co-design 5 6. Additionally, several acceleration tools have been developed for efficient deployment of deep learning models 7 8 9. While some relevant surveys exist  0, our survey is more up-to-date and comprehensive in several crucial aspects: 1) we systematically review model design techniques for images, videos, and 3D vision; 2) we summarize the recent works on designing dynamic deep neural networks for efficient inference; and 3) we thoroughly discuss the specialized models for accomplishing the most common and challenging computer vision tasks, e.g., object detection and image segmentation. The rest of this survey is organized as follows (see Figure 1 for the overview). In Sec. 2 and 3, we introduce the design of efficient static and dynamic backbone networks, respectively. In Sec. 4, the methodology for designing task-specialized efficient models is reviewed. The techniques for compressing deep learning models are investigated in Sec. 5. Efficient hardware deployment approaches are summarized in Sec. 6. Lastly, we discuss existing challenges and future directions in Sec. 7.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Over the past decade, the field of computer vision has experienced significant advancements in deep learning.
