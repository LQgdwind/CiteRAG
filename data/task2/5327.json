All data is provided in full in the results section of this paper.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA parameterised computational problem is a pair consisting of a function P:Σ∗→{0,1}:𝑃→superscriptΣ∗01P:\\Sigma^{\\ast}\\to\\{0,1\\} and a computable parameterisation κ:Σ∗→ℕ:𝜅→superscriptΣ∗ℕ\\kappa:\\Sigma^{\\ast}\\to\\mathbb{N}. A fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm for (P,κ)𝑃𝜅(P,\\kappa) is an algorithm that computes P𝑃P and runs, on input x∈Σ∗𝑥superscriptΣ∗x\\in\\Sigma^{\\ast}, in time f​(κ​(x))⋅|x|O​(1)⋅𝑓𝜅𝑥superscript𝑥𝑂1f(\\kappa(x))\\cdot|x|^{O(1)} for some computable function f𝑓f. We call (P,κ)𝑃𝜅(P,\\kappa) fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) if an FPT algorithm for (P,κ)𝑃𝜅(P,\\kappa) exists. A parameterised Turing-reduction from (P,κ)𝑃𝜅(P,\\kappa) to (P′,κ′)superscript𝑃′superscript𝜅′(P^{\\prime},\\kappa^{\\prime}) is an FPT algorithm for (P,κ)𝑃𝜅(P,\\kappa) that is equipped with oracle access to P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime} and for which there is a computable function g𝑔g such that, on input x𝑥x, each oracle query y𝑦y satisfies κ′​(y)≤g​(κ​(x))superscript𝜅′𝑦𝑔𝜅𝑥\\kappa^{\\prime}(y)\\leq g(\\kappa(x)). We write (P,κ)≤Tfpt(P′,κ′)subscriptsuperscriptfptT𝑃𝜅superscript𝑃′superscript𝜅′(P,\\kappa)\\leq^{\\mathrm{fpt}}_{\\mathrm{T}}(P^{\\prime},\\kappa^{\\prime}) if a parameterised Turing-reduction from (P,κ)𝑃𝜅(P,\\kappa) to (P′,κ′)superscript𝑃′superscript𝜅′(P^{\\prime},\\kappa^{\\prime}) exists. This guarantees\nthat fixed-parameter tractability of (P′,κ′)superscript𝑃′superscript𝜅′(P^{\\prime},\\kappa^{\\prime}) implies fixed-parameter tractability of (P,κ)𝑃𝜅(P,\\kappa).\nFor a more comprehensive introduction, we refer the reader the standard textbooks  and . The lower bounds in this work will rely on the hardness of the parameterised complexity class ⊕𝖶​direct-sum𝖶delimited-[]1\\oplus\\mathsf{W}, which can be considered a parameterised equivalent of ⊕Pdirect-sumP\\oplus\\mathrm{P}. Following 2, we define ⊕𝖶​direct-sum𝖶delimited-[]1\\oplus\\mathsf{W} via the complete problem ⊕Cliquedirect-sumClique\\oplus\\textsc{Clique}: Given as input a graph G𝐺G and a positive integer k𝑘k, the goal is to compute the number of k𝑘k-cliques in G𝐺G modulo 222, i.e., to compute ⊕𝖲𝗎𝖻​(Kk→G)direct-sum𝖲𝗎𝖻→subscript𝐾𝑘𝐺\\oplus\\mbox{$\\mathsf{Sub}(K_{k}\\to G)$}. The problem is parameterised by k𝑘k.\nA parameterised problem (P,κ)𝑃𝜅(P,\\kappa) is called ⊕𝖶​direct-sum𝖶delimited-[]1\\oplus\\mathsf{W}-hard if ⊕Clique≤Tfpt(P,κ)subscriptsuperscriptfptTdirect-sumClique𝑃𝜅\\oplus\\textsc{Clique}\\leq^{\\mathrm{fpt}}_{\\mathrm{T}}(P,\\kappa), and it is called ⊕𝖶​direct-sum𝖶delimited-[]1\\oplus\\mathsf{W}-complete if, additionally, (P,κ)≤Tfpt⊕CliquesubscriptsuperscriptfptT𝑃𝜅direct-sumClique(P,\\kappa)\\leq^{\\mathrm{fpt}}_{\\mathrm{T}}\\oplus\\textsc{Clique}. Modifications of the classical Isolation Lemma (see e.g.  and ) yield a randomised parameterised Turing reduction from finding a k𝑘k-clique to computing the parity of the number of k𝑘k-cliques. In combination with existing fine-grained lower bounds for finding a k𝑘k-clique  , it can then be shown that ⊕Cliquedirect-sumClique\\oplus\\textsc{Clique} cannot be solved in time f​(k)⋅|G|o​(k)⋅𝑓𝑘superscript𝐺𝑜𝑘f(k)\\cdot|G|^{o(k)} for any function f𝑓f, unless the randomised Exponential Time Hypothesis fails: The randomised Exponential Time Hypothesis (rETH) asserts that 333-SAT cannot be solved by a randomised algorithm in time exp⁡o​(n)𝑜𝑛\\exp{o(n)}, where n𝑛n is the number of variables of the input formula. As an immediate consequence, the rETH implies that ⊕𝖶​direct-sum𝖶delimited-[]1\\oplus\\mathsf{W}-hard problems are not fixed-parameter tractable. For the lower bounds in this work, we won’t reduce from ⊕Cliquedirect-sumClique\\oplus\\textsc{Clique} directly, but instead from the following, more general problem: Let ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} be a class of graphs. The problem ⊕cp-Hom​(ℋ)direct-sumcp-Homℋ\\oplus\\text{\\sc{cp-Hom}}(\\mathcal{H})\nhas as input a graph H∈ℋ𝐻ℋH\\in\\mathcal{H} and a surjectively H𝐻H-coloured graph (G,c)𝐺𝑐(G,c). The goal is to compute ⊕𝖧𝗈𝗆​((H,𝗂𝖽H)→(G,c))direct-sum𝖧𝗈𝗆→𝐻subscript𝗂𝖽𝐻𝐺𝑐\\oplus\\mbox{$\\mathsf{Hom}((H,\\mathsf{id}_{H})\\to(G,c))$}. The problem is parameterised by |H|𝐻|H|. The following lower bound was proved independently in [ref]28  and 2. Let ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} be a recursively enumerable class of graphs. If the treewidth of ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} is unbounded then ⊕cp-Hom​(ℋ)direct-sumcp-Homℋ\\oplus\\text{\\sc{cp-Hom}}(\\mathcal{H}) is ⊕𝖶​direct-sum𝖶delimited-[]1\\oplus\\mathsf{W}-hard and, assuming the rETH, it cannot be solved in time f​(|H|)⋅|G|o​(𝗍𝗐​(H)/log⁡𝗍𝗐​(H))⋅𝑓𝐻superscript𝐺𝑜𝗍𝗐𝐻𝗍𝗐𝐻f(|H|)\\cdot|G|^{o(\\mathsf{tw}(H)/\\log\\mathsf{tw}(H))} for any function f𝑓f. Next is the central problem in this work. Let ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} be a class of graphs. The problem ⊕Sub​(ℋ)direct-sumSubℋ\\oplus\\text{\\sc{Sub}}(\\mathcal{H})\nhas as input a graph H∈ℋ𝐻ℋH\\in\\mathcal{H} and a graph G𝐺G. The goal is to compute ⊕𝖲𝗎𝖻​(H→G)direct-sum𝖲𝗎𝖻→𝐻𝐺\\oplus\\mbox{$\\mathsf{Sub}(H\\to G)$}. The problem is parameterised by |H|𝐻|H|. For example, writing 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K} for the set of all complete graphs, the problem ⊕Sub​(𝒦)direct-sumSub𝒦\\oplus\\text{\\sc{Sub}}(\\mathcal{K}) is equivalent to ⊕Cliquedirect-sumClique\\oplus\\textsc{Clique}. Throughout this work, we will rely on two important tools introduced in . For the sake of being self-contained, we encapsulate them below in individual lemmas. The first tool is an adaptation of the so-called Complexity Monotonicity principle to the realm of fractured graphs and modular counting (see [30, Sections 4.1 and 6.3] for a detailed treatment and for a proof). Intuitively, the subsequent lemma states that evaluating, modulo 222, a linear combination of colour-prescribed homomorphism counts from fractured graphs, is as hard as evaluating its hardest term with an odd coefficient. There is a deterministic algorithm 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} and a computable function f𝑓f such that the following conditions are satisfied: 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} expects as input a graph Q𝑄Q and a Q𝑄Q-coloured graph (G,c)𝐺𝑐(G,c). 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} is equipped with oracle access to a function where the sum is over all fractures of Q𝑄Q and a𝑎a is a function from fractures of Q𝑄Q to integers. Each oracle query (G′,c′)superscript𝐺′superscript𝑐′(G^{\\prime},c^{\\prime}) is of size at most f​(|Q|)⋅|G|⋅𝑓𝑄𝐺f(|Q|)\\cdot|G|. 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} computes ⊕𝖧𝗈𝗆​((Q​♯​ρ,cρ)→(G,c))direct-sum𝖧𝗈𝗆→𝑄♯𝜌subscript𝑐𝜌𝐺𝑐\\oplus\\mbox{$\\mathsf{Hom}((Q\\raisebox{0.86108pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{-15.0}{$\\sharp$}}\\rho,c_{\\rho})\\to(G,c))$} for each fracture ρ𝜌\\rho with a​(ρ)≠0mod2𝑎𝜌modulo02a(\\rho)\\neq 0\\mod 2. The running time of 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} is bounded by f​(|Q|)⋅|G|O​(1)⋅𝑓𝑄superscript𝐺𝑂1f(|Q|)\\cdot|G|^{O(1)}. The second tool is a standard application of the inclusion-exclusion principle (see e.g. [30, Sections 4.2 and 6.3]). It will be used in the final steps of our reductions to remove the colourings. There is a deterministic algorithm 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} that satisfies the following conditions: 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} expects as input a graph H𝐻H with k𝑘k edges, a graph G𝐺G and a k𝑘k-edge colouring γ𝛾\\gamma of G𝐺G. 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} is equipped with oracle access to the function ⊕𝖲𝗎𝖻​(H→⋆)direct-sum𝖲𝗎𝖻→𝐻⋆\\oplus\\mbox{$\\mathsf{Sub}(H\\to\\star)$}, and each oracle query G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} satisfies |G′|≤|G|superscript𝐺′𝐺|G^{\\prime}|\\leq|G|. 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} computes ⊕𝖢𝗈𝗅𝖲𝗎𝖻​(H→(G,γ))direct-sum𝖢𝗈𝗅𝖲𝗎𝖻→𝐻𝐺𝛾\\oplus\\mbox{$\\mathsf{ColSub}(H\\to(G,\\gamma))$}. The running time of 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} is bounded by 2|H|⋅|G|O​(1)⋅superscript2𝐻superscript𝐺𝑂12^{|H|}\\cdot|G|^{O(1)}.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: The problem is parameterised by |H|𝐻|H|.
