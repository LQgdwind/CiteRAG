      "content": "Paper Title: MeloTrans: A Text to Symbolic Music Generation Model Following Human Composition Habit\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince musical motifs are short in length, usually no more than one bar, they do not have obvious semantic information. The main attribution that dominates their listening perception is emotional information. Therefore our study focuses on generating musical motifs that have consistent emotional expression with the input text. Emotion of music has been shown to have a significant correlation with various musical features, such as pitch distribution and note density . By controlling these musical features, one can explicitly control the emotional expression of music. Consequently, the core problem to be solved in this work is how to generate these musical features from textual information. Previous research in music psychology has well-established the relationship between emotional valence and mode (major vs. minor), as well as musical structural features (e.g., tempo, fast or slow) in tonal music. Music scored in a major key is typically judged more positively, while music scored in a minor key is typically judged more negatively . Fast tempos tend to make music sound happier, while slow tempos tend to make music sound sadder . Furthermore, faster tempos, higher note densities, and shorter note durations are associated with increased emotional arousal, while slower tempos, lower note densities, and longer note durations are associated with decreased arousal . Consequently, Valence-Arousal (VA) emotion features are used as a link between textual information and musical features  . Currently, the extraction of textual emotion information is a more mature technique  . In this work, a Textual Emotion Recognition (TER) pre-trained model is adopted to achieve the function of extracting VA values . According to the above concept, TTMM is composed of two phases: the VA-based music feature extraction phase and the motif generation phase. The workflow of the TTMM is shown in Figure 3. In the first phase, mode, note density (ND), and note average duration (NAD) are chosen as the musical features, where mode refers to whether the music is in a major or minor key; ND is defined as the number of notes contained in one beat of time; and the NAD is the sum of all note durations divided by the number of notes in beats. To obtain these variable, the VA values is first predicted by the pre-trained TER model. Then the VA values are mapped to the musical features by an empirical approach. It first determines the range of each predicted value according to the music theory rules introduced in the above literature, and then obtains the target value by random sampling. Specifically, Valence determines the mode, and Arousal determines the ND and NAD. The detail is outlined in Algorithm 2. In the second phase, the Number of Notes (NoN) is first obtained by multiplying the ND value with the duration of one bar, and the NoN is adjusted to an integer value not less than 2 according to the compositional rules. Next, the list of tone differences is selected according to the given mode label, which is [ref]0   [ref]5 [ref]7   [ref]0   [ref]5 [ref]7    in the case of a major key or [ref]0   [ref]5 [ref]7   0235781012[ref]0   [ref]5 [ref]7    in the case of a minor key. The number in the list indicates the semitone difference between the note within that mode and the reference note. For a given key, add the MIDI code of the base note to each element of the list to get the scale of the corresponding key. For example, if the mode label is ”Major” and the key is ”D”, then add each element of the list to the MIDI code 62 of the base tone of D4 to get the scale list               . Finally, the motif note sequence is determined by NoN times randomly choice from this list. On the other hand, the duration list is initialized by NAD, and then the length of the whole duration list is extended to one bar by randomly inserting beats (eighth note in our setup). Finally, the motif is obtained by combining the note sequence and the duration list.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: one bar, and the NoN is adjusted to an integer value not less than 2 according to the compositional rules.
