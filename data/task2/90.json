      "content": "Paper Title: Coherent and Archimedean choice in general Banach spaces\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith all these results still fresh in our minds, a brief comparison between the Archimedeanity notion introduced here, and related notions discussed elsewhere, will be useful in putting them in perspective.\nEssential Archimedeanity for sets of desirable options, as discussed in Section 5, is inspired by Walley’s notion of strictly desirable gambles .666Walley’s use of the term ‘strict’ in a context where it can be confused with the much general notion of ‘strict preference’ is a bit unfortunate.\nOne direct way of lifting the openness condition to sets of desirable option sets is based on the ‘includes some open neighbourhood of each of its points’ aspect of openness, and led Jasper De Bock and me to introduce and study what we now prefer to call ‘strong Archimedeanity’ for sets of desirable option sets.\nThat it is indeed stronger than Archimedeanity, is exemplified by the fact that it admits representation results in terms of closed sets of (super)linear functionals   [ref]8.\nDe Bock has shown recently [ref]8 that there is alternative way of lifting the ‘includes some open neighbourhood of each of its points’ aspect of openness to sets of desirable option sets that does not lead to strong Archimedeanity, but rather to the Archimedeanity notion I have introduced here. Archimedeanity for sets of desirable options is based on an ‘intersection of open sets’ idea, and is therefore closely related to even convexity , and the even continuity that Cozman  defined for finite-dimensional option spaces.\nIn their seminal work on partially ordered (binary) preferences on horse lotteries, Seidenfeld et al.  introduced an Archimedeanity condition, which I’ll call SSK-Archimedeanity here, and which Van Camp and Seidenfeld  have recently argued to be strictly weaker than Cozman’s even continuity.\nIt is this SSK-Archimedeanity that Seidenfeld et al.  lift to the context of choice functions on horse lotteries, and which, in combination with mixingness, is instrumental in allowing them to prove their representation result.\nHow this lifted SSK-Archimedeanity condition is related to the Archimedeanity condition studied here, is after quite some study still far from clear to me, and therefore an open question, especially because (i) as I’ve just mentioned, the unlifted SSK-Archimedeanity is strictly weaker than even convexity—which in turn is equivalent to our unlifted Archimedeanity on finite-dimensional option spaces—and (ii) the representation result for mixing choice models that Seidenfeld et al.  have proved based on this lifted SSK-Archimedeanity condition is somewhat more involved, and needs an extra condition in order to more closely resemble the one in Corollary 30. The results presented here constitute the basis for a very general theory of binary and non-binary choice.\nIts foundations are laid by the coherence axioms, which can be made stronger by adding mixingness and Archimedeanity, separately or jointly.\nFor each of the sets of axioms thus formed, we get a conservative inference framework with corresponding closure operators, as well as representation theorems that allow us to construe all coherent, Archimedean or mixing models—as well as combinations of them—as intersections (infima) of specific types of binary ones.\nThese representations are especially interesting because they lead to a complete axiomatic characterisation of various well-known decision making schemes.\nTo give but one example, the (coherent and) Archimedean and mixing models are exactly the ones that correspond to decision making using Levi’s E-admissibility scheme   associated with general—not necessarily closed or convex—sets of linear previsions.\nI believe that such a characterisation—jointly with the one in Jasper De Bock’s paper [ref]8—is achieved here for the first time in its full simplicity and generality, in Corollary 30.777The representation result by Seidenfeld et al.  for these types of models in the context of horse lotteries has, to the best of my knowledge, so far only been proved in a less general context and for the special case of mixing choice models, and the conditions for representation seem, at least to me, less intuitive and more involved than the ones presented here.\nAnd the theory is also flexible enough to allow for characterisations for a plethora of other schemes, amongst which Walley–Sen maximality  .\nIndeed, for the binary choice models we get the decision making schemes based on maximality for sets of desirable gambles, covered by coherent sets of desirable options; lexicographic probability orderings, covered by mixing sets of desirable options; evenly convex sets of positive superlinear bounded real functionals—lower previsions essentially—covered by Archimedean sets of desirable options; and evenly convex sets of positive linear bounded real functionals—linear previsions essentially—covered by Archimedean and mixing sets of desirable options. And for their more general, non-binary counterparts we get, through the representation theorems, schemes that are based on arbitrary intersections—infima—of a whole variety of such binary cases. What I haven’t talked about here are the more constructive aspects of the various conservative inference frameworks.\nThe representation results in this paper essentially allow us to express the closure operator that effects the conservative inference as an intersection of dominating special binary models, which are not always easy (and in some cases even impossible) to identify constructively.\nWe therefore also need to look for other and more constructive ways of tackling the conservative inference problem; early work on this topic seems to suggest that this is not an entirely hopeless endeavour  .\nOn a related note, the Archimedeanity axioms DAsubscriptDA{\\mathrm{D}}_{\\mathrm{A}}, DApsuperscriptsubscriptDAp{\\mathrm{D}}_{\\mathrm{A}}^{\\mathrm{p}} and KAsubscriptKA{\\mathrm{K}}_{\\mathrm{A}} are similarly ‘nonconstructive’, as they’re based on the existence of (super)linear functionals that ‘do certain things’.\nFor an equivalent approach to these axioms with a more constructive flavour, and with gambles as options, I refer to Jasper De Bock’s recent paper on this topic [ref]8. In future work it may be interesting to use the results presented here to derive similar axiomatic characterisations, conservative inference frameworks and representation theorems when the option space is not a linear space but a convex set of horse lotteries.\nWhile I gave a few indications about how this can be done in the Introduction, and worked out the details for the special case of uncertainty about variables with only two possible values in the running coin flip example, the focus there is on the linear option space the horse lotteries are ‘embedded’ in.\nUsing the embedding to directly formulate and study the axioms, inference methods and representations in horse lottery language, could also allow us to better lay bare the relationship with the (less general) approach followed by Seidenfeld et al. . The main advantage of working with sets of desirable option sets is that, on the one hand, it is mathematically equivalent to working with choice or rejection functions, as explained in Section 3, right before instalment 6 of the running example.\nOn the other hand, the framework is formally close enough to that of sets of desirable options in order to make ‘lifting’ axioms from the latter to the former at the same time easy enough to do and likely enough to be successful in producing conservative inference mechanisms and representation theorems.\nThis was already showcased in previous work by the author in collaboration with Jasper De Bock    .\nBut, the power of the ‘lifting’ procedure is again made clear here in the transition from Section 7 to Section 8, where I lift Archimedeanity for sets of desirable options to the corresponding notion for sets of desirable option sets, and therefore indirectly also for choice or rejection functions.\nThis, I believe, explains why the results obtained here seem, to me at least, more powerful and elegantly provable than those in earlier work   [ref]23   [ref]24, which focuses on other (but mathematically equivalent) types of choice models such as choice or rejection functions, and which relies on other axiomatisations.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: sets of desirable option sets.\nThat it is indeed stronger than Archimedeanity, is exemplified by the fact that it admits representation results in terms of closed sets of (super)linear functionals   [ref]8.\nDe Bock has shown recently [ref]8 that there is alternative way of lifting the ‘includes some open neighbourhood of each of its points’ aspect of openness to sets of desirable option sets\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
