      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Code Summarization with Block-wise Abstract Syntax Tree Splitting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSource code comments are important for facilitating collaboration between\nsoftware developers. Much effort has been devoted to designing automatic code\nsummarization techniques in the past decade. Conventional approaches mostly\nadopt Information Retrieval (IR) techniques            \nor methods from NLP\ndomain     7. Recent breakthroughs of deep learning has significantly affect the design of automatic code summarization methods .\nMost neural code summarization methods leverage the seq2seq framework in machine translation [ref]17.\nEarly approaches leverage various deep learning techniques like LSTM [ref]19, convolutional attention network , dual training  or multiple encoders  to generate code summarization based on input code tokens and the seq2seq framework. Recently, there is a surge of works on using ASTs of the source code to guide the generation of summarization. Most of them firstly serialize ASTs into sequences.\nOne representative traversal method is the Structure-Based Traversal method\n(SBT) . Given the serialized ASTs, existing works adopt sequential neural networks like\nLSTM , GRU   or\nTransformer  to extract features for generating code\nsummarization. The limitation of these methods is that structural information\ncannot be fully captured from serialized ASTs. To overcome this problem, some\nworks consider replacing the RNN based encoder with a Graph Neural Network\n(GNN) based encoder \nor feeding the outputs from the sequential encoder as the initial node\nrepresentations into the GNN based encoder .\nThese methods typically encounter high\noverhead and face difficulties in training, as ASTs are deep with many nodes which are hard and slow to learn.\nIn order to balance the\nretention of structural information and the training difficulties, Wan et\nal.  transform ASTs into binary trees for efficient\ntraining at the cost of partial information loss. Besides above methods of modeling ASTs, another way is to\nrepresent a code snippet as the set of compositional paths in its AST for code\nsummarization . There are other directions for improving code summarization.\nWan et al.  argue that the encoder-decoder framework suffers\nfrom exposure bias,\nand they opt to deep\nreinforcement learning for better code summarization. Chen and Zhou 2 consider modeling code retrieval and code summarization tasks together.\nZhang et al.  design a new method which combines merits of both IR-based and neural network-based code summarization methods. Haque et al. 3 add an additional RNN encoder to the seq2seq framework to encode file context and enhance code summarization. Gros et al.  reviews the evaluation metrics used in existing code summarization works.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: of deep learning has significantly affect the design of automatic code summarization methods .\nMost neural code summarization methods leverage the seq2seq framework in machine translation [ref]17.\nEarly approaches leverage various deep learning techniques like LSTM [ref]19, convolutional attention network , dual training  or multiple encoders  to generate code summarization based on\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
