Since the basic 2D CNNs, which extract appearance features of each frame separately, cannot capture the motion information in the video, two-stream CNNs   are proposed to use the stacked optical flow images as an additional input for short-term motion modeling. In order to model the long-term motion information in video, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are combined with 2D CNNs for video sequence modeling .\nDifferent from 2D CNNs, 3D CNNs [ref]3 capture spatial and temporal information at the same time with 3D spatiotemporal kernels, which are more suitable for video analysis. They are widely used in the field of action recognition, and many improved methods based on 3D CNNs are derived [ref]4 [ref]6 .\nHowever, 3D CNNs have the problem of high computational complexity. Some methods aim at reducing the computational complexity of 3D CNNs. Separable 3D CNN [ref]6 factorizes 3D convolution into 2D and 1D convolutions. Multi-Fiber Network 0 reduces considerable computation by using improved 3D group convolution.\nTemporal Shift Module 1 shifts features along time, and then uses 2D CNNs to process the shifted feature maps at each time.\nThe above works are based on local operations for information extraction and short-term contextual modeling, which expand the receptive field by stacking multiple layers. In the real world, the object does not exist alone, it always has relationships with other objects or the environment. In order to recognize an action, we need to combine the visual features of the object and its interactions with other objects or the scene. The interactions may occur between distant pixels in space as well as time 2. Therefore, modeling the long-range dense context is essential.\nThe most common method for long-range and dense contextual information modeling is to repeat the local operations, i.e. the convolutional and recurrent operations. However, repeating local operations is inefficient and causes optimization difficulties. In order to enhance the ability of capturing long-term contextual dependencies, non-local neural network is proposed 2. A non-local module directly computes the correlations between every two points in a spatiotemporal feature map by matrix multiplication. Several non-local modules are plugged into the deep 3D convolutional neural networks to capture dense long-range dependencies and thus improve the recognition accuracy. However, non-local operation causes a relative high computation cost.\nFor a clip of video with Tùëá\\mathit{T} frames, the computation complexity of the non-local module is ùí™ùí™\\mathcal{O}((T\\mathit{((T}√ó\\mathit{\\times}Hùêª\\mathit{H}√ó\\mathit{\\times}Wùëä\\mathit{W}√ó\\mathit{\\times}C)\\mathit{C)}√ó(T\\mathit{\\times(T}√ó\\mathit{\\times}Hùêª\\mathit{H}√ó\\mathit{\\times}Wùëä\\mathit{W}√ó\\mathit{\\times}C))\\mathit{C))}, where Hùêª\\mathit{H}, Wùëä\\mathit{W} and Cùê∂\\mathit{C} represent the height, width and the number of channels of the feature map respectively.\nDouble attention network (abbr. A2superscriptùê¥2A^{2}-Net) 3 aggregates global features into a compact set and redistributes features via two attention processes, which can be seen as another implementation of non-local operation with fewer computation. The computation complexity of A2superscriptùê¥2A^{2}-Net is ùí™ùí™\\mathcal{O}((T\\mathit{((T}√ó\\mathit{\\times}Hùêª\\mathit{H}√ó\\mathit{\\times}Wùëä\\mathit{W}√óC)\\mathit{\\times C)}√óC)\\mathit{\\times C)}, but usually Cùê∂\\mathit{C} is very large.\nCompact generalized non-local (CGNL) network 4 approximates non-local operation via low-order Taylor series. Its computation complexity is ùí™ùí™\\mathcal{O}((T\\mathit{((T}√ó\\mathit{\\times}Hùêª\\mathit{H}√ó\\mathit{\\times}Wùëä\\mathit{W}√óC)\\mathit{\\times C)}√ó(P+\\mathit{\\times(P+}11\\mathrm{1}))\\mathit{))}, where P‚â™(T\\mathit{P}\\ll\\mathit{(T} √ó\\mathit{\\times}Hùêª\\mathit{H} √ó\\mathit{\\times}W)\\mathit{W}) indicates the order of Taylor expansion for kernel functions.\nIn the field of image segmentation, criss-cross attention (CCA) 5 is proposed to reduce the computation complexity of non-local operation. One CCA module harvests sparse and pixel-wise contextual information on the criss-cross path for all the points in a feature map. With two stacked CCA modules in series, every point in the feature map is able to interact with any other point, which generates dense contextual information and long-range dependencies of the whole feature map. For a 2D feature map, the computation complexity of non-local operation is ùí™ùí™\\mathcal{O}((H\\mathit{((H}√ó\\mathit{\\times}Wùëä\\mathit{W}√ó\\mathit{\\times}C)\\mathit{C)}√ó(H\\mathit{\\times(H}√ó\\mathit{\\times}Wùëä\\mathit{W}√óC))\\mathit{\\times C))}, while that of the CCA module is ùí™ùí™\\mathcal{O}((H\\mathit{((H}√ó\\mathit{\\times}Wùëä\\mathit{W}√ó\\mathit{\\times}C)\\mathit{C)}√ó(H+W‚àí\\mathit{\\times(H+W-} 11\\mathrm{1}))\\mathit{))} 5. Criss-cross attention has shown an efficient and strong ability of spatial context modeling in image segmentation task. In our work, we build 3D criss-cross attention modules and insert them into multiple state-of-the-art action recognition architectures.\nFor a spatiotemporal feature map, a 3D criss-cross operation only needs (T+H+W‚àí2)ùëáùêªùëä2(T+H+W-2) sparse connections for each point, which reduces vast computation complexity and memory usage. To make the interaction between any two points in the spatiotemporal domain possible, a recurrent 3D CCA (RCCA-3D) module that includes three CCA-3D modules with shared parameters and recurrent connections is proposed, which can be seen in Figure 1. The complexity of RCCA-3D module is ùí™ùí™\\mathcal{O}((T\\mathit{((T}√ó\\mathit{\\times}Hùêª\\mathit{H}√ó\\mathit{\\times}Wùëä\\mathit{W}√ó\\mathit{\\times}C)\\mathit{C)}√ó(T+H+W‚àí\\mathit{\\times(T+H+W-} 22\\mathrm{2}))\\mathit{))}.\nTo find the optimal and efficient structure for video context modeling, we conduct an exhaustive research on different network structures for the action recognition tasks. First, we compare different combinations of the CCA-3D modules and determine the most effective structure of the RCCA-3D module. We make a series of explorations on the structure of the RCCA-3D as well as the fusion method between the relation representation obtained by our CCA-3D module and the appearance representation of the input to find the most effective architecture of the RCCA-3D module.\nThen we explore the inserted position of the RCCA-3D and the number of inner channels for each CCA-3D module, so as to help us make a trade-off between the accuracy and the amount of calculation and parameters.\nFinally, we compare our RCCA-3D module with the non-local module in neural networks of different architectures and on different datasets to verify the superiority of our method. Compared with the non-local method, the proposed RCCA-3D can reduce the number of parameters by 25% and reduce the computation amount FLOPs by 30%. With substantial experiments on the UCF101 6, HMDB51 7,\nMini-Kinetics and Kinetics-400 [ref]4 datasets, we prove that our proposed RCCA-3D module is effective in spatiotemporal context modeling. The main contributions of our work include: We extend 2D criss-cross attention to 3D. A CCA-3D module can model the relationship between the spatiotemporal points in the same line along the direction of horizon, vertical and depth at each time with a sparse attention map. We explore the connections between multiple CCA-3Ds, number of CCA-3Ds and other settings. We design a 3D recurrent criss-cross attention module that is most suitable to model the long-range spatiotemporal contextual information for action recognition. Extensive experiments with different backbones on multiple datasets are made to thoroughly analyze relation models and validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model, which achieves leading performance among the methods that only use RGB modality.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: analysis and synthesis, intelligent monitoring, content-based video retrieval and so on.\nThe application of deep neural networks   has achieved great success in the field of action recognition [ref]3 [ref]4  [ref]6.\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are extensively employed to extract visual features.
