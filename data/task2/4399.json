      "content": "Paper Title: A Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network with Meta Feature Learning for Abnormality Detection in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) is one of the most widely accepted technology for the examination of gastrointestinal (GI) tracts since its emergence in the year 2000 . There are a variety of disorders in the GI tract like ulcers, bleeding, inflammatory, polyps, and tumors. To detect and diagnose these GI disorders, an endoscopy procedure captures a sequence of images of the GI region for the examination. However, the procedure brings discomfort to patients as a camera fitted endoscopy tube is inserted into the patient’s body through mouth or rectum. WCE has gained popularity by examining deeper GI regions where conventional endoscopy tubes cannot reach. A WCE capsule keeps on moving in the GI tract and records its video that normally has more than 80,0008000080,000 frames . This poses a challenge in the manual inspection of the entire tract, as there may be very few abnormal frames as compared to normal frames. Further, the size of an abnormal region can be very small in a frame that may get missed. This requires a constant attention of human experts for long hours. Due to these challenges, Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) tools have become a popular choice in the automatic detection of abnormal candidate frames for final examination by gastro-experts. In the last decade, machine learning (ML) algorithms were prominent for the detection of GI abnormalities like bleeding , ulcer , polyps , etc. Deep learning (DL) models employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) also enticed the interest of researchers in the area of medical imaging due to their inherent capability of image feature extraction . Although DL algorithms automatically extract patterns in the data, the main challenge is the scarcity of data. Small datasets with high class imbalance, large variations in size, shape, and texture of abnormalities in WCE images make it difficult to build an efficient model [ref]7. Also, if the GI anomalies are very small as compared to the frame size, their features may get dominated by the features of normal regions, that in turn affects the prediction. In this study, a DL based classification model is proposed using a hybrid CNN architecture with three parallel CNNs. To deal with large variations in different types of anomalies, and to tackle the problem of visual similarity of certain anomalies with the normal regions in WCE images, two different convolution (Conv) operators are employed in each CNN. While the first CNN uses a cosine normalized Conv (CNC) in its Conv layers,  the second CNN exploits a depth-wise separable Conv (DSC) . The third CNN is a meta feature extraction network that works on the statistical patterns of the feature maps generated by Conv layers of the first and the second CNN and its own previous layer. The CNN-trio works independently in unison to gather distinguishing features of different types of abnormalities, which significantly improves the classification performance. The model also uses an attention layer 0 that tunes the salient regions in the input image before it is passed on to the CNNs and also accelerates the convergence. Highlights of the proposed DL model are summarized as follows. ∙∙\\bullet A hybrid convolutional neural network model is introduced for abnormality detection in wireless capsule endoscopy images. The model consists of two feeder networks with distinct convolution operations and a novel meta-feature extraction network for improved classification performance. ∙∙\\bullet The first feeder network utilizes cosine normalized convolution to control the variance within a feature map that speeds-up the learning process, while the second network exploits depthwise separable convolution to learn richer representations with less number of parameters. ∙∙\\bullet The meta-feature extraction network derives a rich pool of meaningful features drawn over the statistical patterns of the feature maps generated by the feeder networks layer-by-layer. ∙∙\\bullet An attention layer exploiting the residual attention mechanism is used as a pre-processing layer to generate saliency of abnormal regions in an image before it is passed on to the three networks. ∙∙\\bullet The proposed model outperforms six state-of-the-art gastrointestinal abnormality detection methods on two publicly available datasets. Cross-dataset validation results also exhibit the proposed model’s generalization capability. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a brief overview of some of the related works. Section 3 presents the proposed hybrid CNN model for abnormality detection in WCE images. Datasets, experimental results, and analysis are detailed in Section 4, and Section 5 concludes the proposed study.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: challenge is the scarcity of data.
