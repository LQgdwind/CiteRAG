      "content": "Paper Title: ENGAGE: Explanation Guided Data Augmentation for Graph Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph representation learning has been shown to be powerful in many graph analysis tasks [ref]10  1 2 . In particular, unsupervised graph representation learning methods    have attracted substantial attention, as they are adaptive to various applications especially when labels are scarce.\nAmong them, recently contrastive learning   has achieved superior performance by learning representations from contrastive views to reduce superfluous information.\nHowever, most existing works    2 simply apply random sampling for data augmentation, which could accidentally break the graph structures, thus reducing the effectiveness of representations.\nIn other domains such as computer vision and natural language processing, more intelligent data augmentation methods have been proposed by leveraging the semantic information 2  or domain knowledge .\nHowever, it is obscure to define and extract meaningful elements from abstract data types such as graphs. Also, the non-Euclidean property of graph increases the augmentation difficulty. Some preliminary efforts have been made to tackle the problem. For example, Fang et al.  propose using knowledge graphs to augment the original input graph and help construct contrastive pairs, which is applicable to computational chemistry. However, a more common and intriguing problem is how to design intelligent augmentation without external information sources. In addition, Zhu et al. 8 apply centrality as the node importance indicator and encourage perturbing nodes of lower centrality. However, node centrality is a static metric and is not necessarily relevant to downstream tasks in all scenarios. Some work  1 design end-to-end frameworks to automatically formulate data augmentation policies, but they could induce high computational costs. Also, their black-box nature would fail to explicitly locate task-relevant information in graph data. To solve the problem, this work proposes ENGAGE (ExplaNation Guided data AuGmEntation), where we use explanation to guide the generation of contrastive views for learning effective unsupervised representations on graph data. Specifically, we first propose a new explanation method called Smoothed Activation Map (SAM). Different from existing explanation methods that focus on understanding model predictions, SAM measures node importance based on the distribution of representations in the latent space.\nThen, with the node importance scores, we design an explanation guided graph augmentation method by perturbing edges and node features, which is used to construct paired graph views for contrastive learning. By leveraging explanations, significant graph structures are less likely to be damaged by accidents. Meanwhile, our SAM method is efficient by using the quantization technique , so that it can be applied into the training process.\nFinally, we conduct experiments on multiple datasets and tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed method.\nThe contributions can be summarized as below: We propose the ENGAGE framework which leverages explanation to inform graph augmentation, and uses contrastive learning for training representations to preserve the key parts in graphs while removing uninformative artifacts. We propose a new efficient explanation method called SAM for unsupervised representation learning on graph data. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level classification tasks, with two representative contrastive learning models and different encoders, demonstrating the effectiveness and flexibility of ENGAGE.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Graph representation learning has been shown to be powerful in many graph analysis tasks [ref]10  1 2 .
