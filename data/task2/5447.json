      "content": "Paper Title: Tab2KG: Semantic Table Interpretation with Lightweight Semantic Profiles\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section provides an overview of related approaches in the areas of dataset profiling and semantic table interpretation. Given the growth of data available on the Web and in industrial data lakes, there is a high demand for dataset profiling, e.g., for creating data catalogs . The profile features typically belong to several categories, including statistical observations at the instance and schema level  . Such features are not restricted to the initially defined schemas. For example, Neumaier et al. demonstrate how user interaction and search functionalities profit from the inclusion of spatio-temporal features into a dataset profile [ref]38. For tabular data, other approaches for dataset profile enrichment include the generation of table titles  and schema labels . The inferred relation-specific rules and observations can further verify the data quality and become part of dataset profiles [ref]41 . Recently, approaches to annotate tabular data with concepts from a knowledge base to predict column types gained increased attention. In the following, we introduce approaches for semantic table interpretation and the methods they use. Instance-level lookup. Most semantic table interpretation tools require access to a target knowledge graph, as they link data table cells to its resources . Such approaches on the instance-level have recently been driven by the SemTab Challenge 4 , which explicitly postulates a cell-entity annotation (CEA) task, where labels in data table cells are linked to entities in a target knowledge graph. The subsequent steps of column-type annotation (CTA) and columns-property annotation typically build upon the CEA results. Several approaches are based on entity lookup (ColNet , MantisTable , LinkingPark 7, DAGOBAH  , MTab , T2KMatch 6, CSV2KG , TableMiner+ 8, and the work by Zhang et al. ), with different (combined) query strategies, including URL matching , (partial) string lookup   7, string similarity   6 , spelling correction 7 or the use of named entity linking tools . After linking data table cells to resources in the knowledge graphs, the CTA is typically decided through voting or counting   7, ranking   8 or clustering . ColNet and TableMiner+ apply learning strategies to reduce the number of lookup tasks required for detecting the class of the entities represented by a column. MantisTable and CSV2KG utilize concept graphs in their ranking to identify the most-specific sub classes.\nAlso, identifying properties represented by the data tables typically relies on the CEA and additional knowledge graph lookups. For example, MTab does pairwise queries between entities identified in different columns to identify potential entity relations. To identify literal relations, MTab and TableMiner+ row-by-row compute data-type specific similarities between the literals in the target knowledge graph and the cell values. CSV2KG also involves the target ontology in this step. Sherlock  is a system that performs CTA and does not rely on CEA. However, it extracts column features for training a neural network, which is solely trained on DBpedia and explicitly predicts one of the selected DBpedia classes. The reliance on entity linking with the target knowledge graph makes these approaches unsuitable in settings where data tables only contain previously unseen data, which is a common issue . Even if the data instances in the data table are not entirely unknown, these approaches do not perform well when the number of matching entities drops . Another thing these approaches have in common is the reliance on a large underlying knowledge base such as DBpedia and stable lookup services. In contrast, Tab2KG does not require access to the target knowledge graph after the domain profile has been created. Subject column detection. Several approaches  8 for semantic table interpretation assume the existence of a subject column, i.e., the main column of the data table where every other column is directly connected to. The subject column detection is typically identified through a set of statistic features. Approaches relying on a subject column do not consider the involvement of any classes which are not directly represented in the data table (for example, consider Fig. 2, but without the first column). Tab2KG utilizes a graph-based approach where such class relations can be found. Column titles. Some data tables come with column titles, which may indicate respective classes or properties. Efthymiou et al.  propose a method based on ontology matching, where one column title defines the class label, and other column titles represent property labels. Domain-independent Semantic Labeler 0, DAGOBAH  and TableMiner+ 8 exploit column titles as one of their features. Tab2KG does not require any column titles. This way, we ensure the generalizability for data tables without headers and language-independence. Data type restrictions. Data tables contain data of various types, and thus there are approaches specific to some of them. For example, EmbNum+  transforms data table columns with numeric values into embedding vectors. Alobaid et al. demonstrate that using more fine-grained numeric data types increases semantic table interpretation performance for numeric column values . For the interpretation of cross-lingual textual values, Luo et al. propose using several translation tools . Tab2KG aims at the interpretation of data tables as a whole without restricting to particular data types or languages and thus establishes profiles that do not depend on particular data types or languages. User feedback. Instead of relying on fully-automated approaches for semantic table interpretation, which may be error-prone due to the challenges involved in this task, manual or semi-automated approaches rely on user feedback. Karma , Odalic , and ASIA  are interactive tools that let users decide on the correctness of suggested table annotations and thus achieve high precision, but demand both time and expertise from the user. Tab2KG is a fully-automated approach for semantic table interpretation that does not require user interventions. Domain-independent semantic table interpretation. Domain-independent approaches are not restricted to specific target knowledge graphs. Instead, they learn domain-independent similarity features to generate the mapping. The SemanticTyper  scores similarity between columns and data type relations based on handcrafted features for numeric and textual values. Based on similar features, the Domain-independent Semantic Labeler 0 adopts machine learning and handcrafted features to predict the similarity between a column and a class in the domain knowledge graph. Taheriyan et al.  generate a ranked list of potential column mappings learned from a sample of the domain ontology, which is then presented to the user. While both approaches are flexible concerning the target domain, Tab2KG aims to use only features present in the dataset profiles.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: the initially defined schemas.
