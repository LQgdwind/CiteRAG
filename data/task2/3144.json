      "content": "Paper Title: Self-supervised Graph Learning for Occasional Group Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs an important branch in Recommender System¬†  , occasional group recommendation has received more and more attention, and many social media platforms such as Meetup and Facebook aims to solve this problem¬†   6.\nThis task can be formulated as recommending items to occasional groups, where each occasional group has no or few historical interacted items111This paper addresses the occasional group (a.k.a cold-start group) with few historical interacted items.. Since each occasional group has extremely sparse interactions with items, traditional group recommendation methods can not learn high-quality group representations. To solve this problem,\nsome early studies adopt heuristic pre-defined aggregation strategy such as average strategy¬†, least misery strategy¬† and maximum satisfaction strategy¬† to aggregate the user preference to obtain the group preference. However, due to the fixed aggregation strategies,\nThese methods are difficult to capture the complex dynamic process of group decision making, which results in\nunstable recommendation performance¬†2.\nFurther, Cao et al.¬† propose to assign each user an attention weight, which represents the influence of group member in deciding the group‚Äôs choice on the target item.\nHowever, when some users in the occasional group only interact with few items (a.k.a. cold-start users), the attention weight assigned for each user is diluted by these cold-start users, and thus results in biased group profile. Recently, a few Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based group recommendation methods are proposed¬†7   [ref]16. The core idea of these GNNs is to incorporate high-order neighbors as collaborative signals to strengthen the cold-start users‚Äô embedding quality, and further enhance the embedding quality of the target group.\nAs shown in Figure¬†1, the GNN model first conducts graph convolution multiple steps on the user-item and user-user interaction graphs to learn the preference of group members, and then performs average¬†[ref]16, summation and pooling¬†6 or attention mechanism¬†[ref]16 to aggregate the preferences of group members to obtain the group representation.\nNext, based on the aggregated embeddings of groups and users, the GNNs can estimate the probability that a group/user purchase an item.\nFinally, the recommendation-oriented loss (e.g., BPR loss¬†1) is used to optimize the groups/users/items embeddings.\nMoreover, Zhang et al.¬†[ref]46 propose hypergraph convolution network (HHGR) with self-supervised node dropout strategy, which can model complex high-order interactions between groups and users. Through incorporating self-supervised signals, HHGR can alleviate the cold-start issue in some extent. However, the above methods still suffer from the following challenges.\nFirst, the group representation not only depends on the group members‚Äô preferences, but also relies on the group-level preferences towards items and collaborative group signals (the groups that share common users/items).\nAlthough some GNNs consider either group-level preferences¬† or collaborative group signals¬†[ref]16 [ref]46 to form the group representation, they do not consider all these signals together.\nSecond, the GNNs can not explicitly enhance the high-order cold-start neighbors‚Äô embedding quality.\nFor example in Figure¬†1, for the target group g2subscriptùëî2g_{2}, its group member u1subscriptùë¢1u_{1} and high-order neighbor i1subscriptùëñ1i_{1} only have few interactions. The embeddings of u1subscriptùë¢1u_{1} and i1subscriptùëñ1i_{1} are inaccurate, which will hurt the embedding quality of g2subscriptùëî2g_{2} after performing graph convolution operation.\nThus, how can we learn high-quality embeddings by GNNs for occasional group recommendation? To this end,\nmotivated by the self-supervised learning (SSL) technique¬†0  , which aims to spontaneously find the supervised signals from the input data itself and can further benefit the downstream tasks¬†1 2, we propose a self-supervised graph learning framework (SGGSGG{\\rm SGG}), which reconstructs the user/item group embedding with the backbone GNNs from multiple interaction graphs under the meta-learning setting¬†3.\nSGGSGG{\\rm SGG} can explicitly improve the users‚Äô/items‚Äô/groups‚Äô embedding quality.\nMore concretely, first, we choose the groups/users/items that have enough interactions as the target groups/users/items. We treat the learned embeddings of these target groups/users/items as the ground-truth embeddings, since traditional recommendation algorithms can learn high-quality embeddings for them.\nFurther, we mask a large proportion neighbors of the target groups/users/items to simulate the cold-start scenario, where the cold-start groups/users/items have few interactions. Based on the partially observed neighbors of the target groups/users/items, we perform graph convolution multiple steps to learn their ground-truth embeddings. More concretely, for each target group/user/item in their counterpart interaction graphs222For each group, its counterpart graphs are group-group, group-item and group-user graphs; for each user, his counterpart graphs are user-user and user-item graphs; for each item, its counterpart graph is user-item graph., we randomly sample KùêæK first-order neighbors for them. Based on the sampled neighbors, we perform graph convolution operation multiple times in each interaction graph, and fuse the corresponding refined embeddings to predict the target embedding. Finally, we jointly optimize the reconstruction losses between the users‚Äô/items‚Äô/groups‚Äô ground-truth embeddings and the predicted embeddings by the GNNs, which improves the convolution ability of the GNNs. Thus, the GNNs can obtain high-quality group representation that contains all the signals as presented in the first challenge. Nevertheless, the above proposed embedding reconstruction task does not explicitly strengthen the high-order cold-start neighbors‚Äô embedding quality for the target users/items/groups. To explicitly enhance the high-order cold-start neighbors‚Äô embedding quality, we incorporate an embedding enhancer to learn high-quality node‚Äôs embeddings under the same meta-learning setting as mentioned before. The embedding enhancer is instantiated as the self-attention learner, which learns the cold-start nodes‚Äô embeddings based on their masked first-order neighbors in the counterpart interaction graphs.\nWe incorporate the meta embedding produced by the embedding enhancer into each graph convolution step to further strengthen the GNNs‚Äô aggregation ability.\nThe contributions are: We present a self-supervised graph learning framework for group recommendation. In this framework, we design the user/item/group embedding reconstruction task with GNNs under the meta-learning setting, We further introduce an embedding enhancer to strengthen the GNNs‚Äô aggregation ability, which can improve the high-order cold-start neighbors‚Äô embedding quality. Comprehensive experiments show the superiority of our proposed framework against the state-of-the-art methods.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: for each user is diluted by these cold-start users, and thus results in biased group profile.
