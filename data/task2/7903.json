Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, up to now, there exist no algorithms also working on automatically adapting the KT process allowed for comparison. We adopt two types of EMT algorithms with DE and GA as base solvers which will be compared with MTDE-L2T and MTGA-L2T, respectively. By keeping the base solver the same for comparison, the experimental results can fairly reflect which KT design contributes to more search efficiency gain. Regarding the DE-based implicit EMT algorithms, the compared algorithms include AEMTO , MFDE , MKTDE , MTDE-AD , MTDE-B . Regarding the GA-based implicit EMT algorithms, the compared algorithms include MFEA , MFEA2 , Generalized MFEA (GMFEA) 9, MFEA with Adaptive KT (MFEA-AKT) [ref]9, and MTEA-AD . The reason for choosing these algorithms for comparison is that they share some similar structures with the KT action design in the L2T framework. For example, MFDE transfers differential vectors and MTDE-B transfers base vectors. In fact, MFDE is a special case of the agent with fixed output action a1=0.5,a2=0,a3=1formulae-sequencesubscriptùëé10.5formulae-sequencesubscriptùëé20subscriptùëé31a_{1}=0.5,a_{2}=0,a_{3}=1. Therefore, comparing these EMT algorithms can reveal whether our L2T framework is capable of discovering a better KT process than the human-designed KT process.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: AEMTO , MFDE , MKTDE , MTDE-AD , MTDE-B .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
