Existing methods for ObjectNav can be classified as either end-to-end learning methods or modular methods. End-to-end learning methods seek to learn a mapping from sensor observations to low-level actions using a single neural network, usually consisting of a visual encoder followed by a recurrent cell that aggregates information over time. Most end-to-end learning methods train the network using reinforcement learning (RL), although recently, Habitat-Web  collected a dataset of 80K human demonstrations and achieved strong performance using imitation learning. Significant progress has been made in end-to-end RL by introducing auxiliary tasks [ref]42, different reward functions [ref]42 [ref]29, and different visual encoders such as CLIP-pretrained backbones , DINO-pretrained backbones , and graph convolutional networks on object graphs  [ref]15 . Many recent works focus on finding ways to leverage additional data for training    [ref]29. Currently, the state-of-the-art method for ObjectNav is ProcTHOR , which generated thousands of synthetic scenes and applied end-to-end RL with a CLIP backbone. Modular methods seek to build a hierarchical policy in which one module handles high-level goal selection (“where to look”) and another module handles low-level action planning (“how to get there”) The advantages of this decomposition are that 1) the individual problems are easier to solve, 2) their solutions be reused across different tasks, and 3) the final pipeline is more interpretable than an end-to-end policy. In particular, the “how to get there” subproblem is equivalent to the task known as PointGoal Navigation (PointNav), for which near-perfect performance has been achieved by existing methods  . However, the “where to look” subproblem is unsolved and is the primary focus of research on modular ObjectNav. One approach is to treat this purely as an undirected exploration problem and try to maximize the area explored by the agent   . This lends itself to simple heuristics that can perform well without any learning, but is ultimately limited in its efficiency. To leverage semantic priors for goal selection, SemExp  built a top-down semantic map and used it to train an RL-based policy that minimizes distance to target objects, winning the 2020 Habitat ObjectNav Challenge. More recently, a few works   have proposed to select goals directly from supervised predictions about unexplored areas of the environment, avoiding RL entirely. This is the paradigm that we use in this paper. We discuss explicit prediction methods further in the next subsection.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: collected a dataset of 80K human demonstrations and achieved strong performance using imitation learning.
