      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring the Adversarial Frontier: Quantifying Robustness via Adversarial Hypervolume\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAdversarial Attacks.\nSince the discovery of adversarial vulnerabilities in DL models [ref]6, a substantial body of research has focused on the development of attack algorithms within various threat models to critically evaluate the robustness of these models   .\nSpecifically, researchers have developed white-box attacks by leveraging complete access to a model’s parameters and gradients; in contrast, black-box attacks are devised with merely an understanding of the model’s input-output interface available to the attacker. White-box Attacks.\nExploiting full knowledge of the model, including its gradients, white-box attacks evaluate a model’s robustness by formulating and solving an optimization problem [ref]1. This practice has led to the development of a series of attacks, including the PGD attack [ref]1, the Carlini-Wagner (CW) attack , the FGSM attack , the Basic Iterative Method (BIM) attack , and the DeepFool attack . A model’s adversarial accuracy, when subjected to these attacks, is a critical metric for determining its robustness. Black-box Attacks.\nDespite the efficacy of white-box attacks in assessing robustness, their real-world applicability is often restricted due to limited access to internal model details.\nTherefore, many black-box attacks have been developed to overcome this limitation      .\nAmong them, the Square attack stands out, successfully breaching the SOTA defenses using a gradient-free strategy and even surpassing some gradient-based attacks that have access to comprehensive information [ref]14.\nWithin the AutoAttack framework [ref]14, it is a critical component, utilized alongside the APGD attack to measure a model’s adversarial accuracy. Adversarial Defenses.\nDefensive strategies against adversarial attacks are designed to enhance a model’s inherent robustness or alleviate the effects of adversarial attacks. To improve the robustness, a range of adversarial training techniques have been introduced [ref]1 .\nFurthermore, several tactics have been devised to detect or neutralize adversarial examples, including input transformation  , adversarial purification  , and stateful defenses  .\nGiven that adversarial purification and stateful defenses are tailored for real-world classification systems rather than a standalone model, our study concentrates primarily on the robustness improvement brought by adversarial training and input transformation techniques. Adversarial Training.\nAdversarial training represents a prevalent approach to increase the robustness of DL models by incorporating adversarial examples into the training dataset, which enables the model to learn more robust decision boundaries [ref]1.\nAdversarial examples are often generated using the PGD attack [ref]1, and a significant volume of research corroborates its efficacy   . Input transformation.\nInput transformation is a cost-effective defensive strategy that can be seamlessly incorporated into systems with adversarially trained models to enhance robustness  .\nHowever, the efficacy of input transformation has come into question, as it has been proven to be vulnerable to circumvention .\nMoreover, using adversarial accuracy to measure the robustness improvement from input transformation techniques may lead to misleading results, since the adversarial accuracy of disparate techniques tends to be low and indistinguishable.\nIn contrast, our research introduces the adversarial hypervolume metric, which facilitates a comparative analysis of robustness improvements by providing more detailed insights into average confidence values.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Adversarial Attacks.\nSince the discovery of adversarial vulnerabilities in DL models [ref]6, a substantial body of research has focused on the development of attack algorithms within various threat models to critically evaluate the robustness of these models   .\nSpecifically,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
