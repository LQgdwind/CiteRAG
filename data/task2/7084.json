      "content": "Paper Title: Bandit-Driven Batch Selection for Robust Learning under Label Noise\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs applications increasingly demand larger and more complex deep learning models, the need for efficient training strategies has become paramount. One way to accelerate training and potentially improve model performance is through the use of Curriculum Learning (CL) and adaptive batch selection. These techniques optimize learning by selectively focusing on data samples that are intrinsically rich and informative at the most appropriate stages of the learning process. Such strategies not only accelerate convergence but also enhance the model’s ability to generalize [ref]19 [ref]20 [ref]27. While many methods use difficulty metrics to select easy, hard, or uncertain instances for training , a key area lies in handling noisy or mislabeled datasets . This domain is particularly important for two reasons: a) the impact of batch selection strategies is easily measured, leading to more insightful conclusions; and b) it addresses the prevalent real-world scenarios where data is often sourced from the web  or crowdsourced , and a large portion is considered “unclean”. Sample selection strategies using auxiliary Deep Neural Networks\n(DNN) effectively mitigate the impact of noisy or mislabeled data. However, these approaches incur substantial computational overhead, limiting their scalability    . While alternative methods like SELFIE  offer computational efficiency, they are under-explored and rely on steps like re-labeling for optimal performance. Meanwhile, the literature on CL and batch selection offers numerous methods for efficient sample selection across diverse domains  [ref]19. This paper introduces a novel approach that synergizes insights from the CL and batch selection literature to enhance efficient sampling schemes, specifically targeting scenarios with prevalent label noise. Our methodology aims to achieve superior performance without the computational burden often associated with deploying additional DNNs, thereby striking a balance between efficacy and computational efficiency. Unlike traditional CL approaches that focus on individual instances or tasks, our method refines the feedback loop from each training iteration to optimize the selected batch. This approach is particularly relevant for tackling the challenges posed by the increasing computational complexity and diversity of machine learning applications across various domains.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: that are intrinsically rich and informative at the most appropriate stages of the learning process. Such strategies not only accelerate convergence but also enhance the model’s ability to generalize [ref]19 [ref]20 [ref]27.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
