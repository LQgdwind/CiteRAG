      "content": "Paper Title: An Unsupervised Normalization Algorithm for Noisy Text: A Case Study for Information Retrieval and Stance Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDigitization and the advent of Web 2.0 have resulted in a staggering increase in the amount of online textual data.\nAs more and more textual data is generated online, or digitized from offline collections, the presence of noise in the text is a growing concern.\nHere noise refers to the incorrect forms of a valid word (of a given language). Such noise can be of two broad categories :\n(1) machine-generated, such as those produced by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, etc. while digitizing content, and\n(2) human-generated, produced by the casual writing style of humans, typographical errors, etc. For instance, social media posts (e.g. microblogs) and SMS contain frequent use of non-standard abbreviations (e.g., ‘meds’ for ‘medicines’, ‘tmrw’ for ‘tomorrow’). There exist plenty of important resources of textual data\ncontaining both the categories of noise.\nWith regard to machine-generated noise, old documents like legal documents, defense documents, collections produced from large scale book digitization projects111https://archive.org/details/millionbooks etc. are either in scanned version or in hard-copy format. Digitization of these vital collections involve OCR-ing the scanned versions.\nThe print-quality, font variability, etc. lead to poor performance of the OCR systems which incorporates substantial error in the resulting text documents. Moreover, these noisy documents can be present in many languages, which also contributes to the challenge, since the OCR systems of many languages may not be well-developed. The unavailability of error-free versions of these collections makes error modelling infeasible. For the second category of noise (user-generated), social networking sites such as Twitter and Weibo have emerged as effective resources for important real-time information in many situations   .\nInformal writing by users in such online media generates noise in the form of spelling variations, arbitrary shortening of words, etc. . The presence of various types of noise are known to adversely affect Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) applications such as search/retrieval, classification, stance detection, and so on .\nHence, normalization/cleansing of such noisy text has a significant role in improving performance of downstream NLP / IR / ML tasks.\nThe soul of a text normalization technique lies in mapping the different variations of a word to a single ‘normal’ form, achieving which successfully can lead to remarkable improvement in a lot of downstream tasks.\nThere have been several works that have attempted text normalization, both in supervised and unsupervised ways (see Section 2 for a survey).\nSupervised algorithms require large training data (e.g., parallel corpora of noisy and clean text) which is expensive to obtain. This leads to a necessity for unsupervised methods, on which we focus in this paper. There already exist several unsupervised text normalization approaches. However, most of the existing works have experimented with only one type of noise.\nFor instance, Ghosh et al.  developed a method for correcting OCR errors, while others [ref]8  addressed variations in tweets.\nThe type of errors in various text collections can be quite different – usually in tweets the error does not occur at the beginning of a word. However, OCR errors can appear at any location in a word, which makes noisy text normalization more challenging.\nSo, a robust text normalization system for generic noise should be adept at handling many random and unseen error patterns.\nBut to our knowledge, no one has attempted to address different categories of noise at the same time. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised, language-independent algorithm – called UnsupClean – capable of automatically identifying the noisy variants produced by any of the aforementioned categories of noise, viz. machine-generated and human-generated. We perform extensive experiments where we compare the proposed UnsupClean algorithm with four baseline text normalization algorithms – Aspell, Enelvo , and the algorithms developed by Sridhar et al [ref]8 and Ghosh et al. .\nTo compare the performance of the various text normalization algorithms, we focus on two practical downstream applications – retrieval/search, and stance detection. We judge the performance on a text normalization algorithm by checking the performance of state-of-the-art retrieval/stance detection models on datasets cleaned by the normalization algorithm.\nExperiments are performed over several standard datasets spanning over two languages (English and Bengali), both containing OCR noise, as well as over microblogs containing human-generated noise.\nThe empirical evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed algorithm over the baseline normalization algorithms – while we produce significantly better performance on OCR collections, our performance is competitive with all the baselines over the microblog collections.\nTo our knowledge, no prior work on text normalization/cleansing have reported such detailed comparative evaluation as done in this work – over two downstream applications, and over six datasets spanning two languages and both machine-generated and user-generated noise. To summarize, the strengths of the proposed text normalization algorithm UnsupClean are as follows:\n(1) The algorithm is completely unsupervised, and does not need any training data (parallel corpus), dictionaries, etc. Thus, the algorithm is suitable for application on resource-poor languages.\n(2) The algorithm can handle different types of noise, including both intentional mis-spellings by human users, as well as machine-generated noise such as OCR noise, and\n(3) The algorithm is language-independent, and can be readily applied to text in different languages.\nWe make the implementation of UnsupClean publicly available at https://github.com/ranarag/UnsupClean. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly surveys various types of text normalization/cleaning algorithms.\nThe proposed text normalization algorithm (UnsupClean) is detailed in Section 3.\nThe baseline text normalization algorithms with which the performance of UnsupClean is compared, are described in Section 4.\nNext, to check the effectiveness of various text normalization algorithms, we focus on two downstream applications over noisy text – retrieval and stance detection. The experiments related to these two downstream applications are described in Section 5 and Section 6 respectively. Each of these sections describe the datasets used, the retrieval / stance detection models used, and the experimental results.\nFinally, we conclude the study in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: normalization approaches.
