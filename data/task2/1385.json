Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

There are 50,000 images for training and 10,000 images for validation. We implement ResizeMix on two neural netowrks, \\ieWideResNet-28-10 [ref]52 and Shake-Shake (26 2x96d) [ref]19. We train the WideResNet-28-10 network for 200 epochs with a batch size of 256 using the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer. We use the Nesterov momentum  of 0.9, and the weight decay of 5×10−45superscript1045\\times 10^{-4}. The initial learning rate is 0.1 and decays with the cosine annealing schedule . When training the Shake-Shake (26 2x96d) network, we set the total epochs as 1,800 and the batch size as 256 using the SGD optimizer. The initial learning rate is 0.01 and the weight decay is 1×10−31superscript1031\\times 10^{-3}. We set the parameters of α𝛼\\alpha, β𝛽\\beta for limiting the resizing scale ratios defined in Sec. 4 as 0.1 and 0.8, which are used for determining the range of the patch resizing scale. The top-1 test accuracy comparisons are shown in Tab. 2. We compare the results of our method with CutMix [ref]51, and some saliency-guided mixing augmentations   , as well as some automated augmentation methods    . Our proposed ResizeMix augmentation outperforms CutMix [ref]51 by 0.5% and it even outperforms the automated augmentation method AutoAugment  by 0.28% with WideResNet-28-10. It is worth noting that ResizeMix does not introduce any additional computation cost, while most saliency-guided or automated augmentation methods take additional cost to promote the performance.\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: 60,000 color images of 32×\\times32 size with 10 classes.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
