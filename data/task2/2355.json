Utilizing prior work on tabular setting, describe our choice of reward-free algorithm. In the exploration phase, we use VI-Zero proposed by  which is displayed in Algorithm 2. Intuitively, the value function Q~h​(s,a)subscript~𝑄ℎ𝑠𝑎{\\widetilde{Q}}_{h}(s,a) computed in the algorithm measures the level of uncertainty that agent may suffer if it takes action a𝑎a at state s𝑠s in step hℎh. It incentivize the greedy policy to visit underexplored states improving our empirical estimate ℙ^^ℙ\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}. In the planning phase, given 𝜽∈ℬ​(1)𝜽ℬ1{\\bm{\\theta}}\\in\\mathcal{B}(1) as input we can use any planning algorithm (such as value iteration) for ℳ^𝜽=(𝒮,𝒜,H,ℙ^out,⟨𝜽,𝐫^⟩)subscript^ℳ𝜽𝒮𝒜𝐻superscript^ℙout𝜽^𝐫\\widehat{\\mathcal{M}}_{\\bm{\\theta}}=(\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},H,\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}^{\\mathrm{out}},\\langle{\\bm{\\theta}},{\\widehat{{\\mathbf{r}}}}\\rangle) where 𝐫^^𝐫{\\widehat{{\\mathbf{r}}}} is empirical estimate of 𝐫𝐫{\\mathbf{r}} using collected samples {𝐫hk}subscriptsuperscript𝐫𝑘ℎ\\{{\\mathbf{r}}^{k}_{h}\\}. The following theorem state theoretical guarantees of the reward-free algorithm for tabular VMDPs. Proof of Theorem 7 and more details can be found in Appendix C. There exists a reward-free algorithm for tabular VMDPs and a right choice of hyperparameters that satisfies Definition 1 with sample complexity\nmRFE​(ϵ,δ)≤𝒪​(min⁡{d,S}​H4​S​A​ι/ϵ2+H3​S2​A​ι2/ϵ),subscript𝑚RFEitalic-ϵ𝛿𝒪𝑑𝑆superscript𝐻4𝑆𝐴𝜄superscriptitalic-ϵ2superscript𝐻3superscript𝑆2𝐴superscript𝜄2italic-ϵm_{\\textsc{RFE}}(\\epsilon,\\delta)\\leq\\mathcal{O}(\\min\\{d,S\\}H^{4}SA\\iota/\\epsilon^{2}+H^{3}S^{2}A\\iota^{2}/\\epsilon),\nwhere ι=log⁡[d​S​A​H/(ϵ​δ)]𝜄𝑑𝑆𝐴𝐻italic-ϵ𝛿\\iota=\\log[dSAH/(\\epsilon\\delta)]. The theorem shows that we can achieve sample complexity of 𝒪~​(min⁡{d,S}​H4​S​A/ϵ2)~𝒪𝑑𝑆superscript𝐻4𝑆𝐴superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\min\\{d,S\\}H^{4}SA/\\epsilon^{2}) for the reward-free exploration (Definition 1) in the tabular setting, matching the best result in [ref]31. The following corollary immediately follows from Theorem 7 along with Theorem 6 and 16. In the tabular setting we can have an algorithm for\napproachability (Definition 3) with\nmAPP​(ϵ,δ)≤𝒪​(min⁡{d,S}​H4​S​A​ι/ϵ2+H3​S2​A​ι2/ϵ)subscript𝑚APPitalic-ϵ𝛿𝒪𝑑𝑆superscript𝐻4𝑆𝐴𝜄superscriptitalic-ϵ2superscript𝐻3superscript𝑆2𝐴superscript𝜄2italic-ϵm_{\\textsc{APP}}(\\epsilon,\\delta)\\leq\\mathcal{O}(\\min\\{d,S\\}H^{4}SA\\iota/\\epsilon^{2}+H^{3}S^{2}A\\iota^{2}/\\epsilon) , and an algorithm for CMDP (Definition 4) with\nmCMDP​(ϵ,δ)≤𝒪​(min⁡{d,S}​H4​S​A​ι2/ϵ2+H3​S2​A​ι3/ϵ)subscript𝑚CMDPitalic-ϵ𝛿𝒪𝑑𝑆superscript𝐻4𝑆𝐴superscript𝜄2superscriptitalic-ϵ2superscript𝐻3superscript𝑆2𝐴superscript𝜄3italic-ϵm_{\\textsc{CMDP}}(\\epsilon,\\delta)\\leq\\mathcal{O}(\\min\\{d,S\\}H^{4}SA\\iota^{2}/\\epsilon^{2}+H^{3}S^{2}A\\iota^{3}/\\epsilon).

Therefore, our framework while being modular enabling direct translation of reward-free RL to constrained RL, achieves sharp sample complexity guarantees. We comment that due to reward-free nature of our approach unlike , we can no longer provide regret guarantees.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: for the reward-free exploration (Definition 1) in the tabular setting, matching the best result in [ref]31.
