      "content": "Paper Title: Applying Deutsch’s concept of good explanations to artificial intelligence and neuroscience - an initial exploration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhat makes Deutsch’s HTV principle fascinating is that it was invented within the context of critical rationalism, the epistemology of Karl Popper. There is a close connection between epistemology - the philosophical study of knowledge - and the field of artificial intelligence, which studies (among other things) hows to store and utilize knowledge in computers and how to program computers to discover knowledge. Deutsch has argued that a better understanding of Popperian epistemology is necessary before artificial general intelligence can be realized. A core part of Popper’s philosophy is that he rejected induction and argued that induction is not required for the growth and development of scientific knowledge. This is in contrast to many present day AI methods which are equivalent to Bayesian methods of induction in how they learn from data.[ref]24  Indeed, an in-vogue view today is that all AI systems are an approximation of Solomonoff induction. To explain how science can work without induction Popper argued that theories can only be falsified by evidence, and not confirmed. In Popper’s view theories are “bold conjectures” invented to solve problems and not learned directly from experience. To give a poignant example, the idea that stars are actually distant suns was a bold conjecture first proposed by Anaxagoras around 450 BC. While how to generate such conjectures is of great interest to AI researchers, Popper was not so much concerned with how conjectures may be generated, seeing that as a question for psychologists to answer instead. The truthfulness of a conjecture, after all, is independent of its source. While experience can and does inform us as to which conjectures to keep and which to discard, in particular in the form of empirical tests, in Popper’s view experience is always theory-laden. In other words, observations cannot be made in an unprejudiced or unbiased manner as Francis Bacon had prescribed. To Popper, the question of which comes first, theory or observations, is much like the question of the chicken and the egg. Scientific theories are built on observations, which in term were informed by previous scientific theories in a chain going back to pre-scientific myths. Thus, while empirical testing of theories plays a role in the form of falsifying certain theories while preserving others, Popper believes that fundamentally all theories originate “from within” rather being impressed into the mind from outside. Interestingly, Popper conjectured that critical rationalism was not limited to explaining the functioning of science but could be extended to explain elements of psychology as well (ie. how the human brain works and obtains knowledge). If falsifiability is all that matters for a theory to be scientific, should theories based on myths that make falsifiable predictions about the actions of Gods, demons, and ghosts be considered scientific? The need to remove such obviously unscientific theories from the realm of the scientific was a partially addressed by Popper through his notion of “degrees of falsifiability”, but the extent to which this principle succeeds at the task is unclear. Deutsch seems to have introduced his HTV principle as an alternative criteria for demarcating scientific vs unscientific theories. The HTV principle asserts that we should reject explanations based on myths because they are easy to vary. Thus, if the data were different, they could easily adapt to that situation. An illustrative example which Deutsch elaborates in detail in his book The Beginning of Infinity and in a 2009 TED talk is the ancient Greek myth that the seasons were due to the periodic sadness of the god Demeter. This myth can be easily varied by changing the gods involved and their behaviours, and thus is not a good explanation. The theory can also be varied both without changing the predictions it makes, for instance by substituting the gods employed with other ones, and can also be varied in such a way as to make the predictions adapt to any scenario. Both of these types of variability make it a bad explanation, according to Deutsch. What makes a theory hard-to-vary? For Deutsch a key factor is constraints arising from the internal deductive logic of the theory. As he explains, the modern day explanation of the seasons is a good explanation because it involves a tight series of geometrical deductions regarding the suns rays and the Earth’s axis tilt. There are a few free parameters, such as the angle of tilt, but most of the explanation is rooted in geometrical deductions which cannot be varied. Another important source of constraint is consistency with established knowledge.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: required for the growth and development of scientific knowledge.
