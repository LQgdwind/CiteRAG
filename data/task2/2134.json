      "content": "Paper Title: SDGMNet: Statistic-based Dynamic Gradient Modulation for Local Descriptor Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn current years, modulating gradients becomes the shared theme of designing pair-based loss functions in metric learning. Modulation strategies can be categorized into two classes: Modulation for individual pairs and modulation for Siamese pairs. We briefly illustrate these two cases with triplet-based loss as an example in Fig. 1. Our method also stands on them. Thus, we try to absorb related modulation strategies no matter whether they are dynamic or exclusive for triplet loss. For better analyzing these cases in related works, let us represent the general loss as ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}. d+​(𝒂​,​𝒑)superscript𝑑𝒂,𝒑d^{+}(\\boldsymbol{a}\\text{,}\\boldsymbol{p}) denotes the general distance between a matching pair {𝒂​,​𝒑}𝒂,𝒑\\{\\boldsymbol{a}\\text{,}\\boldsymbol{p}\\}, and d−​(𝒂​,​𝒏)superscript𝑑𝒂,𝒏d^{-}(\\boldsymbol{a}\\text{,}\\boldsymbol{n}) denotes the one between non-matching {𝒂​,​𝒏}𝒂,𝒏\\{\\boldsymbol{a}\\text{,}\\boldsymbol{n}\\}. For convenience, we simplify d​(∙)𝑑∙d(\\ \\mathchoice{\\mathbin{\\vbox{\\hbox{\\scalebox{0.5}{$\\displaystyle\\bullet$}}}}}{\\mathbin{\\vbox{\\hbox{\\scalebox{0.5}{$\\textstyle\\bullet$}}}}}{\\mathbin{\\vbox{\\hbox{\\scalebox{0.5}{$\\scriptstyle\\bullet$}}}}}{\\mathbin{\\vbox{\\hbox{\\scalebox{0.5}{$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bullet$}}}}}\\ ) as d𝑑d. d+−d−superscript𝑑superscript𝑑d^{+}-d^{-} is usually referred to relative distance, denoted by drsuperscript𝑑𝑟d^{r}. θ𝜃\\theta is an instance for d𝑑d. Note that, distance and negative similarity are not distinguished deliberately in this paper. Modulation for individual pairs. Several loss functions, such as Lifted Structure Loss , Binomial Deviance Loss  and NCA , treat individual positive and negative pairs unequally. However, not all of them are aware of that while ∂ℒ/∂d+ℒsuperscript𝑑\\partial\\mathcal{L}/\\partial d^{+} should be modulated with an increasing function in terms of d+superscript𝑑d^{+}, −∂ℒ/∂d−ℒsuperscript𝑑-\\partial\\mathcal{L}/\\partial d^{-} needs decreasing one, if we follow HEM. For local descriptor learning, Keller et al.  follow HEM. They modulate ∂ℒ/∂di+ℒsuperscriptsubscript𝑑𝑖\\partial\\mathcal{L}/\\partial d_{i}^{+} and −∂ℒ/∂di−ℒsuperscriptsubscript𝑑𝑖-\\partial\\mathcal{L}/\\partial d_{i}^{-} with functions symmetrical about (di++di−)/2subscriptsuperscript𝑑𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑑𝑖2(d^{+}_{i}+d^{-}_{i})/2 for each triplet. And then global information is crudely fused by shifting the axis of symmetry. Exp-TL  conducts more powerful HEM with exponential loss. The new loss makes ∂ℒ/∂d+ℒsuperscript𝑑\\partial\\mathcal{L}/\\partial d^{+} increase and −∂ℒ/∂d−ℒsuperscript𝑑-\\partial\\mathcal{L}/\\partial d^{-} decease exponentially. HyNet  observes a hidden modulation in deep back propagation. It substitutes hybrid similarity for common similarity, so the hidden modulation is recast. The new modulation balances the needs of two kinds of pairs. In other tasks, Multi-Simi Loss 9 combines Lifted Structure Loss and Binomial Deviance Loss to satisfy respective demands of d+superscript𝑑d^{+} and d−superscript𝑑d^{-}. Circle Loss 1 fulfills this purpose with Circle Margin. SFace  employs sigmoid functions to mine hard pairs. Meanwhile, SFace also finds that the functions are disturbed in deep back propagation. But this problem is left alone and defended to restrain the noise in datasets, e.g., MS-Celeb-1M . Modulation for Siamese pairs. The relative hardness of Siamese pairs should be also taken into account. It provides more reliable information about the data distribution near the shared anchor. For a triplet, its hardness can be measured by drsubscript𝑑𝑟d_{r}. Harder triplets with larger drsubscript𝑑𝑟d_{r} should be emphasized with larger ∂ℒ/∂drℒsuperscript𝑑𝑟\\partial\\mathcal{L}/\\partial d^{r} during stochastic gradient descent. Balntas et al.  introduce a static hard margin for local descriptor learning. The hard margin modulates ∂ℒ/∂drℒsuperscript𝑑𝑟\\partial\\mathcal{L}/\\partial d^{r} with step function in terms of drsuperscript𝑑𝑟d^{r} and prevents easy triplets from backward propagation. Additionally, quadratic triplet loss in SOSNet  and scale-aware negative logarithmic softmax loss introduced by Keller et al.  polish original triplet loss with ‘soft margin’. Thus, ∂ℒ/∂drℒsuperscript𝑑𝑟\\partial\\mathcal{L}/\\partial d^{r} is modulated by continuous functions that monotonically increase with drsuperscript𝑑𝑟d^{r}. Zhang and Rusinkiewicz [ref]55 further enroll Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) to formulate a dynamic soft margin. Furthermore, n-pair losses are more popular with other metric learning tasks. In those cases, angular margin    cuts off partial easy Siamese pairs and achieves great success. Multi-Simi 9 Loss separates Siamese pairs into independent positive and negative parts. The gradients of positive or negative pairs that share the same anchor are associated to be modulated. In contrast, Circle Loss 1 considers two kinds of Siamese pairs together. Although not all of modulations discussed above are customized for triplet loss we try to modify, there is still something worthy of consideration. Especially, Zhang and Rusinkiewicz [ref]55 have proposed a dynamic modulation for Siamese pairs with CDF, but it is not considerate. Moreover, the deep analysis on back-propagated gradients performed by HyNet  and SFace  suggests that the hidden modulation deserves more attentions. Additionally, the SFace points out that the strict HEM might be irrational, which indirectly explains the nature of hybrid similarity in HyNet. Adsorbing these ideas, we concentrate on our concerns and propose SDGMNet.\n\nReference markers found: [55]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]55: with ‘soft margin’.
