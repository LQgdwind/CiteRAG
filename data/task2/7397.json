      "content": "Paper Title: Link Prediction with Relational Hypergraphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe carry out additional inductive experiments on knowledge graphs where each edge has its arity fixed to 222 and compare the results against the current state-of-the-art models. Setup. We evaluate HCNet on 444 standard inductive splits of WN18RR [ref]13 and FB15k-237 , which was proposed in Teru et al. . We provide the details of the datasets in Table 7. Contrary to the standard experiment setting [ref]5 [ref]20 on knowledge graph G=(V,E,R,c)𝐺𝑉𝐸𝑅𝑐G=(V,E,R,c) where for each relation r​(u,v)∈E𝑟𝑢𝑣𝐸r(u,v)\\in E, an inverse-relation r−1superscript𝑟1r^{-1} is introduced as a fresh relation symbol and r−1​(v,u)superscript𝑟1𝑣𝑢r^{-1}(v,u) is added in the knowledge graph, in our setup we do not augment inverse edges for HCNet. This makes the task more challenging. We compare HCNet with models designed only for inductive binary link prediction task with knowledge graphs, namely GraIL , NeuralLP , DRUM , NBFNet [ref]5, RED-GNN , and A*Net [ref]20, and we take the results provided in Zhu et al. [ref]20 for comparison. Implementation. We report the hyperparamter used in Table 8. For all models, we consider a 2-layer MLP as\ndecoder and adopt layer-normalization with dropout in all\nlayers before applying ReLU activation and skip-connection.\nWe also adopt the sinusoidal positional encoding as described in the body of the paper.\nWe discard all the edges in the training graph that are currently being treated as positive triplets in each batch to prevent overfitting.\nWe additionally pass in the considered query representation 𝒛qsubscript𝒛𝑞{\\bm{z}}_{q} to the decoder via concatenation to 𝒉v|𝒒(L)superscriptsubscript𝒉conditional𝑣𝒒𝐿{\\bm{h}}_{v|{\\bm{q}}}^{(L)}.\nThe best checkpoint for each model is selected based on its performance on the validation sets, and\nall experiments are performed on one NVIDIA A10 24GB GPU. For evaluation, we consider filtered ranking protocol [ref]13 with 323232 negative samples per positive triplet, and report Hits@101010 for each model. Results.\nWe report the results in Table 6. We observe that HCNets are highly competitive even compared with state-of-the-art models specifically designed for link prediction with knowledge graphs. HCNets reach the top 333 for 777 out of 888 datasets, and obtain a very close result for the final dataset.\nNote here that the top 222 models are NBFNet [ref]5 and A*Net [ref]20, which share a similar idea of HCNet and are all based on conditional message passing. The difference in results lies in the different message functions, which are further supported in Table 1 of Huang et al. . However, we highlight that HCNet does not augment with inverse relation edges, as described in the set-up of the experiment. HCNet can recognize the directionality of relational edges and pay respect to both incoming and outgoing edges during message passing. No current link prediction model based on message passing can explicitly take care of this without edge augmentation. In fact, Theorem F.4 implies that all current models based on conditional message passing, including NBFNets, need inverse relation augmentation to match the expressive power of HCNet.\nTheoretically speaking, this allows us to claim that HCNet is strictly more powerful than all other models in the baseline that are based on conditional message passing, assuming all considered models match their corresponding relational Weisfeiler-Leman test.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: knowledge graphs where each edge has its arity fixed to 222 and compare the results against the current state-of-the-art models.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
