      "content": "Paper Title: Mitigating Bias in Facial Analysis Systems by Incorporating Label Diversity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFacial expression is one of the most powerful and instinctive means of communication for human beings.\nIn the past decade, much progress has been made to build computer systems to understand and use this natural form of human communication   .\nUsually such systems are treated as a classification problem, and the basic set of emotions (classes) are defined as happiness, surprise, anger, sadness, fear, disgust and neutral (no emotion) 8.\nAs in other related fields, deep learning has improved the performance of FER systems, and some works 9 [ref]1 have recently focused on understanding and mitigating biases in such systems.\nLi and Deng  observed that disgust, anger, fear, and surprise are usually underrepresented classes in datasets, thus being harder to learn compared to the majority classes. Moreover, some works have shown slight differences in perception regarding some expressions in female and male faces.\nFor instance, women were shown to be generally seen as happier than men .\nBecker et al.  demonstrated that people are faster and more accurate at detecting angry expressions on male faces and happy expressions on female faces.\nDenton et al.  find that a smiling classifier\nis more likely to predict “smiling” when eliminating a person’s beard or applying makeup or lipstick to the image while keeping everything else unmodified. In our work, to extract the objective annotations of facial expressions, we adopt the Facial Action Coding System, which consists of facial action units (AUs)  that objectively code the muscle actions typically seen for many facial expressions .\nRecently, in the FER field, the idea of using the relationship among multiple labels has been explored [ref]1.\nIn the context of objective labels to mitigate fairness issues, Chen and Joo [ref]1 leads the initiative by proposing an in-processing approach that incorporates the triplet loss to embed the dependency between AUs and expression categories.\nHowever, differently than previous work, we propose to use AUs in the pre-processing step.\nMoreover, we show that our method not only successfully mitigates biases for FER, but also for rating attractiveness, and future work could expand it to other tasks that involve subjective labels.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: are defined as happiness, surprise, anger, sadness, fear, disgust and neutral (no emotion) 8.\nAs in other related fields, deep learning has improved the performance of FER systems, and some works 9 [ref]1 have recently focused on understanding and mitigating biases in such systems.\nLi and Deng  observed that disgust, anger, fear, and surprise are usually underrepresented classes in datasets,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
