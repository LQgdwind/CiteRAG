      "content": "Paper Title: FACMAC: Factored Multi-Agent Centralised Policy Gradients\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nValue function factorisation  has been widely employed in value-based MARL algorithms.\nVDN  and QMIX  factor the joint action-value function into per-agent utilities that are combined via a simple summation or a monotonic mixing function respectively, to ensure consistency between the arg​maxargmax\\operatorname*{arg\\,max} of the centralised joint-action value function and the arg​maxargmax\\operatorname*{arg\\,max} of the decentralised polices. This monotonicity constraint, however, prevents them from representing joint action-value functions that are characterised as nonmonotonic , i.e., an agent’s ordering over its own actions depends on other agents’ actions.\nA large number of recent works   1   thus focus on developing new value-based MARL algorithms that address this representational limitation, in order to learn a richer class of action-value functions. QTRAN  learns an\nunrestricted joint action-value function and aims to solve a constrained optimisation problem in order to decentralise it, but has been shown to scale poorly to more complex tasks such as SMAC .\nQPLEX  takes advantage of the dueling network architecture to factor the joint action-value function in a manner that does not restrict the representational capacity, whilst also remaining easily decentralisable, but can still fail to solve simple tasks with nonmonotonic value functions 1. Weighted QMIX 1 introduces a weighting scheme to place more importance on the better joint actions to learn a richer class of joint action-value functions. QTRAN++  addresses the gap between the empirical performance and theoretical guarantees of QTRAN. Our multi-agent actor-critic framework with decentralised actors and a centralised but factored critic, by contrast, provides a more direct and simpler way of coping with nonmonotonic tasks as one can simply factor the centralised critic in any manner without constraints. Additionally, our framework can be readily applied to tasks with continuous action spaces, whereas these value-based algorithms require additional algorithmic changes. Most state-of-the-art multi-agent actor-critic methods [ref]21 [ref]7   learn a centralised and monolithic critic conditioning on the global state and the joint action to stabilise learning. Even though the joint action-value function they can represent is not restricted, in practice they significantly underperform value-based methods like QMIX on the challenging SMAC benchmark 1 . In contrast, FACMAC utilises a centralised but factored critic to allow it to scale to the more complex tasks in SMAC, and follows the centralised policy gradient instead of per-agent policy gradients. Lyu et al.  recently provide some interesting insights about the pros and cons of centralised and decentralised critics for on-policy actor-critic algorithms. One important issue that they highlight is that merely utilising a centralised critic does not necessarily lead to the learning of more coordinated behaviours.\nThis is because the use of a per-agent policy gradient can lead to the agents getting stuck in sub-optimal solutions in which no one agents wishes to change their policy, as discussed in 3.2. Our centralised policy gradient resolves this issue by taking full advantage of the centralised training paradigm to optimise over the joint-action policy, which allows us to reap the benefits of a centralised critic. Since FACMAC is off-policy, we also benefit immensely from utilising a centralised critic over a decentralised one since we avoid the issues of non-stationarity when training on older data. Zhou et al.  propose to use a single centralised critic for MADDPG, whose weights are generated by hypernetworks that condition on the state, similarly to QMIX’s mixing network without the monotonicity constraints. FACMAC also uses a single centralised critic, but factorises it similarly to QMIX (not just using the mixing network) which allows for more efficient learning on more complex tasks. Of existing work, the deterministic decomposed policy gradients (DOP) algorithm proposed by Wang et al.  is perhaps most similar to our own approach. Deterministic DOP is off-policy and factors the centralised critic as a weighted linear sum of individual agent utilities and a state bias. It is limited to only considering linearly factored critics, which have limited representational capacity, whilst we are free to choose any method of factorisation in FACMAC to allow for the learning of a richer class of action-value functions.\nWhile they claim to be the first to introduce the idea of value function factorisation into the multi-agent actor-critic framework, it is actually first explored by Bescuca , where a monotonically factored critic is learned for COMA [ref]7. However, their performance improvement on SMAC is limited since COMA requires on-policy learning and it is not straightforward to extend COMA to continuous action spaces.\nFurthermore, both works only consider monotonically factored critics, whilst we employ a nonmonotonic factorisation and demonstrate its benefits.\nWe also investigate the benefits of learning a centralised but factored critic more thoroughly, providing a better understanding about the type of tasks that can benefit more from a factored critic. Furthermore, both deterministic DOP and LICA  use a naive adaptation of the deterministic policy gradient used by MADDPG and suffer from the same problems as discussed in Section 3.2, while our centralised policy gradients allow for better coordination across agents in certain tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: can be readily applied to tasks with continuous action spaces, whereas these value-based algorithms require additional algorithmic changes.
