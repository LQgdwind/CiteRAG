      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Dimensional Stable Roommates in 2-Dimensional Euclidean Space\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnuth  proposed to generalize the well-known Stable Marriage problem (a bipartite restriction of the Stable Roommates problem) to the 3-dimensional case. There are many such generalized variants in the literature, including the NP-complete 333-SR problem .\nHuang  strengthen the result by showing that 333-SR remains NP-hard even for additive preferences.\nHerein, each agent x∈V𝑥𝑉x\\in V has cardinal preferences μx:V∖{x}→ℝ:subscript𝜇𝑥→𝑉𝑥ℝ\\mu_{x}\\colon V\\setminus\\{x\\}\\to\\mathds{R} over all other agents such that x𝑥x prefers {x,s1,s2}𝑥subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2\\{x,s_{1},s_{2}\\} to {x,t1,t2}𝑥subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2\\{x,t_{1},t_{2}\\} if and only if μx​(s1)+μx​(s2)>μx​(t1)+μx​(t2)subscript𝜇𝑥subscript𝑠1subscript𝜇𝑥subscript𝑠2subscript𝜇𝑥subscript𝑡1subscript𝜇𝑥subscript𝑡2\\mu_{x}(s_{1})+\\mu_{x}(s_{2})>\\mu_{x}(t_{1})+\\mu_{x}(t_{2}).\nDeineko and Woeginger  strengthen the result of Huang by showing that\n333-SR remains NP-hard even for metric preferences: μx​(y)=μy​(x)≥0subscript𝜇𝑥𝑦subscript𝜇𝑦𝑥0\\mu_{x}(y)=\\mu_{y}(x)\\geq 0 and μx​(y)+μy​(z)≤μx​(z)subscript𝜇𝑥𝑦subscript𝜇𝑦𝑧subscript𝜇𝑥𝑧\\mu_{x}(y)+\\mu_{y}(z)\\leq\\mu_{x}(z) such that x𝑥x prefers {x,s1,s2}𝑥subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2\\{x,s_{1},s_{2}\\} to {x,t1,t2}𝑥subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2\\{x,t_{1},t_{2}\\} if and only if μx​(s1)+μx​(s2)<μx​(t1)+μx​(t2)subscript𝜇𝑥subscript𝑠1subscript𝜇𝑥subscript𝑠2subscript𝜇𝑥subscript𝑡1subscript𝜇𝑥subscript𝑡2\\mu_{x}(s_{1})+\\mu_{x}(s_{2})<\\mu_{x}(t_{1})+\\mu_{x}(t_{2}).\nIt is straightforward to see that Euclidean preferences are metric preferences and metric preferences are additive.\nWe thus strengthen the results of Deineko and Woeginger, and Huang,\nby showing that the hardness remains even for Euclidean preferences.\nRecently, McKay and Manlove  strengthen the result of Huang  by showing that the NP-hardness remains even if the cardinal preferences are binary, i.e., μx​(y)∈{0,1}subscript𝜇𝑥𝑦01\\mu_{x}(y)\\in\\{0,1\\} for all other agents y𝑦y.\nThis result is not comparable to ours since binary preferences and Euclidean preferences are not comparable.\nThey also show that 333-SR becomes polynomial-time solvable when the preferences are binary and symmetric. Multi-dimensional stable matchings are equivalent to the so-called fixed-size stable cores in hedonic games [ref]11, where each coalition (i.e., a non-empty subset of agents) in the core must have the same size, and stability only needs to be guaranteed for any other coalition of the same size.111A stable core is a partition ΠΠ\\Pi of the agents into disjoint coalitions such that no subset of agents would block the partition ΠΠ\\Pi by forming its own new coalition.\nHence, our NP-hardness result also transfers to the case of finding a fixed-size stable core in the scenario where the agents in the hedonic game have Euclidean preferences.\nHedonic games have been studied under graphical preference models  , where there is an underlying social network (a directed graph) such that agents correspond to the vertices in the graph.\nThe general idea is to assume that agents prefer to be with their own out-neighbors more than non-out-neighbors. The Euclidean preference model is related to the graphical preference model where the underlying graph is planar.\nHowever, the Euclidean model is more fine-grained and assumes that the intensity of the preferences also depends on the distance of the agents.\nNotably, under the graphical model, a stable core always exists and it can be found in linear time , but verifying whether a given partition is stable is NP-hard .\nHedonic games with fixed-size coalitions have been studied for other solution concepts such as strategy-proofness , Pareto optimality , and exchange stability . Other generalized variants include the study of 333-stable matching with cyclic preferences   , with preferences over individuals ,\nand the study of the higher-dimensional case  and of other restricted preference domains .\nWe refer to the textbook by Manlove  for more references.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: 333-SR becomes polynomial-time solvable when the preferences are binary and symmetric.
