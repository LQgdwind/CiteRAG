To create our best model, we combine the Arabic, English and Spanish data by combining their training and validation sets. We then train our model on the combined data using the methodology described in Section¬†IV-B. We use 12 different baselines to compare our method and demonstrate its effectiveness, most of which are the highest performing contenders in SemEval-2018 emotion classification competition. NTUA-SLP¬† ranked 1st on jaccard and micro-f1 metrics for English by using a pretrained Bi-LSTM with a multi-layer self-attention mechanism. They use word2vec embeddings that are trained on 550 million tweets. The best micro-f1 score for English is achieved by psyML¬†, which uses a very similar Bi-LSTM with self-attention model to NTUA-SLP, except they utilize hierarchical clustering to group correlated emotions together and train the same model incrementally for emotions within the same cluster. NVIDIA¬† trains an attention-based transformer network on large scale data and finetune this model on the training set for SemEval-English before testing it, obtaining results on par with those in the competition ranking. DeepMoji is a distant supervision based LSTM architecture and it obtains the state-of-the-art performance on many sentiment related tasks¬†[ref]9. They convert multi-label instances into seperate binary tasks. We report the results of their chain-thaw approach on the English dataset.\nFor Arabic, EMA¬†8 (1st place in jaccard and micro-f1, 2nd place in macro-f1) and PARTNA (1st place in macro-f1, 2nd place in jaccard and micro-f1) achieves the highest two ranks. EMA employs AraVec embeddings¬† as features into a support vector classifier (SVC) with L1subscriptùêø1L_{1} regularization. PARTNA uses a similar support vector based model except using an additional Arabic stemmer designed for handling tweets¬†. There are also studies that perform well but are not in SemEval rankings. Among these, CA-GRU¬† uses context information, the topic of the text in this case, as a feature by first feeding the text to a topic-detection model to obtain a vector of probability distributions over topics. HEF-DF¬† is a simple neural network hybrid model obtained from concatenating human engineered (i.e. handpicking features that represent syntactical and semantical significance) and deep features (i.e. using combinations of embeddings).\nAs with Arabic, two models exist for the 1st place in a metric for Spanish: MILAB_SNU (1st place in jaccard and micro-f1, 2nd place in macro-f1) and ELiRF-UPV, which uses manually and automatically generated lexicon sand combines 1D CNNs with an LSTM to obtain the 1st place in macro-f1 metric¬†[ref]33 (2nd place in jaccard and micro-f1). We also include Tw-StAR¬† as a baseline to compare our method‚Äôs multilingual performance with a standard model. Tw-StAR uses binary relevance transformation strategy to extract term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) features for a linear support vector machine. They also experiment with combinations of 5 different preprocessing methods and reach the 3rd rank for both Arabic and Spanish datasets.\nFastText is a framework that can convert text into feature vectors by using a skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of n-grams¬†. FastText contains readily extracted vectors for 157 languages. We finetune these vectors for English, Arabic and Spanish and use these vectors on their respective SemEval datasets. Table¬†I presents the results of our model compared to the state-of-the-art models and the competition-winners. The models that target only a single language perform significantly better compared to the multilingual models. The only exception is our model that is trained on three different language‚Äôs training data combined, which obtains significantly better results compared to our single language (Ours-SL) model with the same methodology and trained on each of these languages separately. Our method achieves the best score on all of the metrics in Arabic and Spanish languages. Our method achieves the best score in macro-f1 metric of the English language. In Arabic, our method achieves 4.8% (absolute) macro-f1 improvement compared to the previous best model on macro-f1 score, which is HEF-DF¬†. Our method obtains 2.3% (absolute) micro-f1 and 0.2% (absolute) jaccard score improvement compared to the previous best model CA-GRU¬†. In English, our method achieves 1% (absolute) macro-f1 improvement compared to the previous competition winner psyML¬†. Our method performs 0.5% (absolute) micro-f1 and 1.2% (absolute) jaccard score compared to the competition winner NTUA-SLP¬†. Note that although NTUA-SLP achieves the best score on micro-f1 and jaccard metrics, it performs 5.6% (absolute) macro-f1 less than our method. In Spanish, our method achieves 9.0% (absolute) macro-f1 improvement compared to the previous best model ELiRF-UPV¬†[ref]33. Our method also achieves 4.8% (absolute) micro-f1 and 1.7% (absolute) jaccard score improvement compared to the previous best model MILAB_SNU.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: results on par with those in the competition ranking.
