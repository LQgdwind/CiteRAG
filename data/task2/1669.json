      "content": "Paper Title: FeatureNorm: L2 Feature Normalization for Dynamic Graph Embedding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs mentioned in III-A, there are two typical ways to learn the time-evolving patterns in dynamic graph embedding. One is temporal-smoothness learning and the other is recurrent learning. In general, the former method is stable and robust while the latter is more powerful to capture long-distance dependencies. Certainly, two methods can be integrated as proposed in .\nFollowing the works in , [ref]19, , we extract two prototypes to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method as shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, which is also designed to exclude the influence of other factors and independently evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For clarity, we term these two frameworks as DynGCN and GRUGCN, respectively. In each snapshot Gt​(Vt,Et)subscript𝐺𝑡subscript𝑉𝑡subscript𝐸𝑡G_{t}(V_{t},E_{t}), the input feature matrix 𝐗tsubscript𝐗𝑡\\mathbf{X}_{t} contains two parts: one is nodes that have ever emerged in the history, and the other is the new appear nodes. For the first part, we follow the basic idea in  , [ref]19, , that is inheriting the historical embedding results  as the next step input. For the second new part, we use the golort initialization method  to initialize nodes value. Then each GCN block is a typical two-layer graph convolution which is parameter-sharing across time steps, with adding dropout between two graph conventional layers. In Figure 5, an additional recurrent block is added to enhance long-distance learning, which is the prototype of models in [ref]19, . These two frameworks are widely used in dynamic graph embedding, currently. To predict the occurrence of nodes appearing in the local neighborhood around visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} at t𝑡t, we use a binary cross-entropy loss function to push nodes co-occurring to have similar representation and restrain nodes not-occurring to have different representation. The loss function is: where σ𝜎\\sigma is the sigmoid function and {(vi′,vj′)∉Et}superscriptsubscript𝑣𝑖′superscriptsubscript𝑣𝑗′subscript𝐸𝑡\\{(v_{i}^{\\prime},v_{j}^{\\prime})\\notin E_{t}\\} is a negative set sampled with negative sample strategy, and λ𝜆\\lambda is a hyperparameter. Here, we only consider negative samples that have never appeared, that is, links that appeared before time t𝑡t are assumed positive links, so we avoid sampling such node pairs.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: the former method is stable and robust while the latter is more powerful to capture long-distance dependencies.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
