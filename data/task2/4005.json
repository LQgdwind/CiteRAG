      "content": "Paper Title: Non-Markovian Reward Modelling from Trajectory Labels via Interpretable Multiple Instance Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRM  aims to infer a reward function from revealed human preference information such as demonstrations [ref]32, pairwise choices [ref]12, corrections , good/bad/neutral labels , or combinations thereof . Most prior work assumes a human evaluates a trajectory by summing independent rewards for each state-action pair, but in practice their experience is likely to be temporally extended (e.g., via a video clip), creating the opportunity for dependencies to emerge between earlier events and the assessment of later ones. As noted by Chan et al. [ref]11 and Bewley and Lecue , such dependencies may arise from cognitive biases such as anchoring, prospect bias, and the peak-end rule , but they could equally reflect rational drivers of human preferences not captured by the state representation.\nSome efforts have been made to model temporal dependencies, such as a discrete psychological mode which evolves over consecutive queries about hypothetical trajectories , or a monotonic bias towards more recently-viewed timesteps due to human memory limitations . Elsewhere, Shah et al.  use human demonstrations and binary approval labels to learn temporally extended task specifications in logical form. In comparison to these restricted examples, our work provides a more general approach to capturing temporal dependencies in RM.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: RM  aims to infer a reward function from revealed human preference information such as demonstrations [ref]32, pairwise choices [ref]12, corrections , good/bad/neutral labels , or combinations thereof .
