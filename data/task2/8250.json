      "content": "Paper Title: DRIM-ANN: An Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search Engine based on Commercial DRAM-PIMs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nApproximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a widely adopted algorithm for efficiently identifying the closest points in a dataset to a given query point, enabling effective semantic search across vast amounts of information in various modalities, including images, graphs, and texts. Instead of using raw data of the information for the search, ANNS typically has the different information embedded with a high dimensional vector and leverages the euclidean distance between the vectors to characterize the correlation between the embedded information. This algorithm has become a foundational computing kernel in numerous applications, such as recommendation systems and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in large language model (LLM) based applications. The high dimension of the vectors and the large size of the vector corpus in many practical scenarios make ANNS I/O intensive and memory demanding, necessitating significant optimizations [ref]39 for higher searching performance. There have been many prior works focused on ANNS optimizations on CPUs     [ref]12 and GPUs [ref]29   . Notably, Faiss-CPU  explores CPU vectorization to fulfill the parallel computing requirements of ANNS, providing an industrial-grade, high-performance ANNS library. JUNO [ref]29 leverages RT core and CUDA core for LUT construction and distance calculation, respectively, for higher computing resource utilization. However, ANNS on CPU is often bottlenecked by memory I/O bandwidth, typically around 80 GB/s . In contrast, GPUs, which utilize HBM or GDDR memory, offer much higher bandwidth, but are often limited to a few dozen of gigabytes of memory, insufficient to accommodate the large high-dimensional vector corpus in many ANNS tasks. In addition, customized accelerators based on FPGAs     have been proposed to enhance the computational and I/O efficiency of ANNS. Despite significant performance gains, these architectures still struggle to simultaneously meet the high I/O bandwidth and large memory capacity demands of ANNS, leaving substantial room for optimization. In this context, processing-in-memory (PIM) architecture, particularly DRAM-based PIMs that offer high-bandwidth, large-capacity, and near-data computing capability emerges as highly attractive solutions for ANNS. Recent works such as Gcim  and Pyramid [ref]12 have explored PIM for ANNS, building customized computing fabrics stacked on high-bandwidth memory, which have demonstrated significant performance improvement and energy efficiency gains. However, these customized PIM architectures still face numerous technology challenges, and are mostly evaluated using simulators, which can sometimes produce be overly optimistic results. Inspired by previous ANNS optimizations on PIM architectures, we explore the use of off-the-shelf DRAM-PIM from UPMEM for ANNS. A typical UPMEM system supports 2,560 DPUs, each with 64 MB of memory and 1 GB/s bandwidth, resulting in a total memory capacity of 160 GB and a combined memory bandwidth of 2.56 TB/s . This setup can be linearly scaled if the host machine can accommodate more DIMM slots, providing the high bandwidth, large capacity, and near-data computing capabilities that are well-suited for ANNS. Unlike customized PIM architectures designed for specific applications, UPMEM features a sequential RISC processor in each DPU, enabling general-purpose computing tasks. However, these processors operate at only 450 MHz, with a nominal performance of around one instruction per cycle despite their multi-threading capabilities . The performance significantly drops for multiplication and division operations due to the lack of native hardware support. For example, multiplication is approximately 32 times more expensive than addition on UPMEM. Essentially, the computing capacity of each UPMEM DPU is limited, and the overall PIM architecture has a low compute-to-I/O ratio. As a result, even though ANNS is typically an I/O-intensive algorithm on CPUs, it can still be constrained by computing limitations on UPMEM. Despite the thousands of parallel DPUs that allow for parallel computing with private memory, UPMEM lacks a flexible communication fabric between these DPUs, unlike many customized PIM architectures. Additionally, DPUs often need to be synchronized before they can communicate with the host processor, as the communication between the host and DPUs is costly, with bandwidth limited to the host I/O, which is only about 0.75% of the total PIM bandwidth. Consequently, interaction among DPUs is expensive and requires synchronization, making load balancing critical to avoid underutilization of the DPUs. This is particularly challenging for ANNS, as each request may only involve a small portion of the entire dataset, potentially spreading across different DPUs and leading to significant load imbalance issues. Moreover, each DPU has a private memory hierarchy, requiring careful data management to fully exploit the high memory bandwidth. Meanwhile, multi-threaded optimization is necessary for each RISC processor in the DPU to hide memory access latency and fully utilize the deep processor pipeline. In summary, leveraging UPMEM for efficient ANNS remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose DRIM-ANN, the first off-the-shelf DRAM-PIM-based framework for cluster-based ANNS tasks. We begin by identifying the computing patterns of cluster-based ANNS and designing an ANNS engine that supports IVF-PQ and its variants, including OPQ  and DPQ . To leverage UPMEM’s high memory bandwidth and relatively low computational power, we convert the expensive Euclidean distance calculations required by the general ANNS engine into lossless look-up tables (LUTs), thereby compensating for the limited computational capabilities. Building on this converted ANNS engine, we propose a PIM-aware algorithm tuning framework to optimize ANNS configurations for the target DRAM-PIM architecture. Specifically, we develop an effective ANNS performance model to guide architecture-aware tuning. Next, we address the significant load balancing challenges encountered when deploying ANNS on UPMEM with over 2,000 parallel DPUs. To tackle this, we develop cluster splitting and cluster duplication strategies to optimize data layout and distribute active computing tasks more evenly across the DPUs, thereby mitigating the load imbalance issue. Notably, we formulate the layout optimization problem and propose an optimized strategy using a mixed layout approach. Additionally, we prioritize the duplication of clusters that are more likely to be accessed and dynamically allocate queries to the duplicated clusters at runtime to further balance the computing load across the DPUs. Our experiments on representative datasets show that DRIM-ANN achieves an average performance speedup of 2.92×2.92\\times compared to a 32-thread CPU implementation. This speedup can increase to 7.12×7.12\\times with a 5×5\\times improvement in computational power in the future. In summary, we make the following contributions: We present DRIM-ANN, the first Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) framework leveraging commodity DRAM-PIMs. The proposed framework supports general cluster-based ANNS variants utilizing product quantization (PQ). We propose a PIM-aware ANNS algorithm tuning strategy in-combination with the LUT replacement technique to lower the computing requirements of ANNS and alleviate the computing bottleneck of DRAM-PIMs. We identify the load imbalance issue in ANNS implementation on DRAM-PIMs and propose a systematic data layout optimization strategy along with a runtime scheduling approach. These solutions mitigate the imbalance caused by ANNS queries and enhance the utilization of massively parallel DPUs in DRAM-PIMs. Experimental results on typical datasets demonstrate that DRIM-ANN achieves an average performance speedup of 2.92×2.92\\times over a 32-thread CPU implementation, with the potential to reach up to 7.12×7.12\\times speedup given a 5×5\\times increase in the computing ability of current DRAM-PIMs.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: The high dimension of the vectors and the large size of the vector corpus in many practical scenarios make ANNS I/O intensive and memory demanding, necessitating significant optimizations [ref]39 for higher searching performance.
