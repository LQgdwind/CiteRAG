      "content": "Paper Title: Projection-Free Stochastic Bi-level Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMatrix Completion with Denoising: Let us consider the matrix completion problem with the goal of recovering the missing entries from incomplete and noisy observation of a small and random subset of its entries. In general, for problems without noise, the data matrix can be modeled as a low-rank matrix motivating the use of the nuclear norm constraint . Low-rank matrix completion problem arises in a wide range of applications such as image processing , multi-task learning , and collaborative filtering . However, under noisy observations, directly solving the matrix completion problem with just the nuclear norm constraints can result in suboptimal performance [ref]33 . Further, noise is present in many vision applications  , and using only low-rank priors is not sufficient for recovery of the underlying matrix. A common approach to tackle the noise is to apply a denoising algorithm as a pre-processing step. In general however, it is necessary to apply some heuristics, since denoising algorithms requires access to the full matrix, which is not available in the pre-processing stage. Denoising is also impractical in online settings, where a random subset of the entries of the matrix are observed at every iteration. The bilevel optimization framework provides a way out, allowing the incorporation of denoisining step withing the inner-level subproblem. Mathematically, the bi-level matrix completion with denoising problem can be written as where ùêå‚àà‚Ñùn√ómùêåsuperscript‚Ñùùëõùëö{\\mathbf{M}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m} is the given incomplete noisy matrix, ‚Äñùêï‚Äñ1:=‚àëi,j|ùêïi,j|assignsubscriptnormùêï1subscriptùëñùëósubscriptùêïùëñùëó\\left\\|{\\mathbf{V}}\\right\\|_{1}:=\\sum_{i,j}|{\\mathbf{V}}_{i,j}| is the sum-absolute-value (‚Ñì1subscript‚Ñì1\\ell_{1}) norm, and Œª1subscriptùúÜ1\\lambda_{1} and Œª2subscriptùúÜ2\\lambda_{2} are regularization parameters. Note that the regularization over the discrepancy between ùêóùêó{\\mathbf{X}} and denoised matrix ùêòùêò{\\mathbf{Y}} results in bilevel formulation (3). A similar technique in deterministic settings is utilized in various other applications in machine learning and signal processing problems  .\nObserve that (3) is in the form of bilevel formulation (1); however, when the entries are revealed in the form of randomly selected subsets Œ©1t‚äÇŒ©1superscriptsubscriptŒ©1ùë°subscriptŒ©1\\Omega_{1}^{t}\\subset\\Omega_{1} and Œ©2t‚äÇŒ©2superscriptsubscriptŒ©2ùë°subscriptŒ©2\\Omega_{2}^{t}\\subset\\Omega_{2} at every iteration, it becomes stochastic in nature (cf. Sec. II). The main challenge here is due to the nuclear norm constraint, which makes it quite computationally expensive (sometimes even impractical) to solve (3) using projection-based bilevel algorithms. In Sec. V-A, we will show experimentally that the proposed algorithm SBFW is best suited to address such challenges in large-scale bi-level stochastic optimization problems.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: learning , and collaborative filtering .
