We then design a deep RNN architecture by unfolding this algorithm. The proposed reweighted ℓ1​-​ℓ1subscriptℓ1-subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}\\text{-}\\ell_{1} minimization. We introduce the following problem: where “∘\\circ” denotes element-wise multiplication, 𝗴∈ℝh𝗴superscriptℝℎ{\\bm{\\mathsf{g}}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{h} is a vector of positive weights, 𝐙∈ℝh×h𝐙superscriptℝℎℎ{\\bm{\\mathrm{Z}}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{h\\times h} is a reweighting matrix, and 𝐆∈ℝh×h𝐆superscriptℝℎℎ{\\bm{\\mathrm{G}}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{h\\times h} is an affine transformation that promotes the correlation between 𝐡t−1subscript𝐡𝑡1{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t-1} and 𝐡tsubscript𝐡𝑡{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t}. Intuitively, 𝐙𝐙{\\bm{\\mathrm{Z}}} is adopted to transform 𝐡tsubscript𝐡𝑡{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t} to 𝐙𝐡t∈ℝhsubscript𝐙𝐡𝑡superscriptℝℎ{\\bm{\\mathrm{Z}}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{h}, producing a reweighted version of it. Thereafter, 𝗴𝗴{\\bm{\\mathsf{g}}} aims to reweight each transformed component of 𝐙𝐡tsubscript𝐙𝐡𝑡{\\bm{\\mathrm{Z}}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t} and 𝐙𝐡t−𝐆𝐡t−1subscript𝐙𝐡𝑡subscript𝐆𝐡𝑡1{\\bm{\\mathrm{Z}}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t}-{\\bm{\\mathrm{G}}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t-1} in the ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-norm regularization terms. Because of applying reweighting , the solution of Problem (II) is a more accurate sparse representation compared to the solution of the ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} minimization problem in  (where 𝐙=𝐈𝐙𝐈{\\bm{\\mathrm{Z}}}={\\bm{\\mathrm{I}}} and 𝗴=𝐈𝗴𝐈{\\bm{\\mathsf{g}}}={\\bm{\\mathrm{I}}}). Furthermore, the use of the reweighting matrix 𝐙𝐙{\\bm{\\mathrm{Z}}} to transform 𝐡tsubscript𝐡𝑡{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t} to 𝐙𝐡tsubscript𝐙𝐡𝑡{\\bm{\\mathrm{Z}}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t} differentiates Problem (II) from the reweighted ℓ1​-​ℓ1subscriptℓ1-subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}\\text{-}\\ell_{1} minimization problem in [ref]17 where 𝐙=𝐈𝐙𝐈{\\bm{\\mathrm{Z}}}={\\bm{\\mathrm{I}}}.

We use a proximal gradient method  to solve (II): At iteration l𝑙l, we first update 𝐡t(l−1)superscriptsubscript𝐡𝑡𝑙1{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t}^{(l-1)}—after being multiplied by 𝐙lsubscript𝐙𝑙{\\bm{\\mathrm{Z}}}_{l}—with a gradient descent step on the fidelity term as 𝐮=𝐙l​𝐡t(l−1)−1c​𝐙l​∇f​(𝐡t(l−1))𝐮subscript𝐙𝑙superscriptsubscript𝐡𝑡𝑙11𝑐subscript𝐙𝑙∇𝑓superscriptsubscript𝐡𝑡𝑙1{\\bm{\\mathrm{u}}}={\\bm{\\mathrm{Z}}}_{l}{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t}^{(l-1)}-\\frac{1}{c}{\\bm{\\mathrm{Z}}}_{l}\\nabla f({\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t}^{(l-1)}), where ∇f​(𝐡t(l−1))=𝐃T​𝐀T​(𝐀𝐃𝐡t(l−1)−𝐱t)∇𝑓superscriptsubscript𝐡𝑡𝑙1superscript𝐃Tsuperscript𝐀Tsuperscriptsubscript𝐀𝐃𝐡𝑡𝑙1subscript𝐱𝑡\\nabla f({\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t}^{(l-1)})={\\bm{\\mathrm{D}}}^{\\mathrm{T}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{A}}}^{\\mathrm{T}}({\\bm{\\mathrm{A}}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t}^{(l-1)}-{\\bm{\\mathrm{x}}}_{t}). Then, 𝐡t(l)superscriptsubscript𝐡𝑡𝑙{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t}^{(l)} is updated as where the proximal operator Φλ1c​𝗴l,λ2c​𝗴l,𝐆𝐡t−1​(𝐮)subscriptΦsubscript𝜆1𝑐subscript𝗴𝑙subscript𝜆2𝑐subscript𝗴𝑙subscript𝐆𝐡𝑡1𝐮\\varPhi_{\\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{c}{\\bm{\\mathsf{g}}}_{l},\\frac{\\lambda_{2}}{c}{\\bm{\\mathsf{g}}}_{l},{\\bm{\\mathrm{G}}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t-1}}({\\bm{\\mathrm{u}}}) is defined as with ℏ=𝐆𝐡t−1Planck-constant-over-2-pisubscript𝐆𝐡𝑡1\\bm{\\hbar}={\\bm{\\mathrm{G}}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t-1}. Since the minimization problem is separable, we can minimize (6) independently for each of the elements 𝗀lsubscript𝗀𝑙{\\mathsf{g}}_{l}, ℏPlanck-constant-over-2-pi\\hbar, u𝑢u of the corresponding 𝗴lsubscript𝗴𝑙{\\bm{\\mathsf{g}}}_{l}, ℏPlanck-constant-over-2-pi\\bm{\\hbar}, 𝐮𝐮{\\bm{\\mathrm{u}}} vectors.

For ℏ≥0Planck-constant-over-2-pi0\\hbar\\geq 0: and for ℏ<0Planck-constant-over-2-pi0\\hbar<0: Fig. 1 depicts the proximal operators for ℏ≥0Planck-constant-over-2-pi0\\hbar\\geq 0 and ℏ<0Planck-constant-over-2-pi0\\hbar<0. Observe that different values of glsubscript𝑔𝑙g_{l} lead to different shapes of the proximal functions Φλ1c​𝗀l,λ2c​𝗀l,ℏ​(u)subscriptΦsubscript𝜆1𝑐subscript𝗀𝑙subscript𝜆2𝑐subscript𝗀𝑙Planck-constant-over-2-pi𝑢\\varPhi_{\\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{c}{\\mathsf{g}}_{l},\\frac{\\lambda_{2}}{c}{\\mathsf{g}}_{l},\\hbar}(u) for each element u𝑢u of 𝐮𝐮{\\bm{\\mathrm{u}}}. Our iterative algorithm is given in Algorithm 1. We reconstruct a sequence 𝐡1,…,𝐡Tsubscript𝐡1…subscript𝐡𝑇{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{1},\\dots,{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{T} from a sequence of measurements 𝐱1,…,𝐱Tsubscript𝐱1…subscript𝐱𝑇{\\bm{\\mathrm{x}}}_{1},\\dots,{\\bm{\\mathrm{x}}}_{T}. For each time step t𝑡t, Step 1 applies a gradient descent update for f​(𝐙𝐡t−1)𝑓subscript𝐙𝐡𝑡1f({\\bm{\\mathrm{Z}}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t-1}) and Step 1 applies the proximal operator Φλ1c​𝗴l,λ2c​𝗴l,𝐆𝐡t−1(d)subscriptΦsubscript𝜆1𝑐subscript𝗴𝑙subscript𝜆2𝑐subscript𝗴𝑙superscriptsubscript𝐆𝐡𝑡1𝑑\\varPhi_{\\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{c}{\\bm{\\mathsf{g}}}_{l},\\frac{\\lambda_{2}}{c}{\\bm{\\mathsf{g}}}_{l},{\\bm{\\mathrm{G}}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t-1}^{(d)}} element-wise to the result. Let us compare the proposed method against the algorithm in —which resulted in the ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-RNN—that solves the ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} minimization in [ref]6 (where 𝐙l=𝐈subscript𝐙𝑙𝐈{\\bm{\\mathrm{Z}}}_{l}={\\bm{\\mathrm{I}}} and 𝗴l=𝐈subscript𝗴𝑙𝐈{\\bm{\\mathsf{g}}}_{l}={\\bm{\\mathrm{I}}}). In that algorithm, the update terms in Step 1, namely 𝐈−1c​DT​AT​AD𝐈1𝑐superscriptDTsuperscriptATAD{\\bm{\\mathrm{I}}}-\\frac{1}{c}\\textbf{D}^{\\mathrm{T}}\\textbf{A}^{\\mathrm{T}}\\textbf{AD} and 1c​DT​AT1𝑐superscriptDTsuperscriptAT\\frac{1}{c}\\textbf{D}^{\\mathrm{T}}\\textbf{A}^{\\mathrm{T}}, and the proximal operator in Step 1 are the same for all iterations of l𝑙l. In contrast, Algorithm 1 uses a different 𝐙lsubscript𝐙𝑙{\\bm{\\mathrm{Z}}}_{l} matrix per iteration to reparameterize the update terms (Step 1) and, through updating 𝗴lsubscript𝗴𝑙{\\bm{\\mathsf{g}}}_{l}, it applies a different proximal operator to each element 𝐮𝐮{\\bm{\\mathrm{u}}} (in Step 1) per iteration l𝑙l. The proposed reweighted-RNN. We now describe the proposed architecture for sequential signal recovery, designed by unrolling the steps of Algorithm 1 across the iterations l=1,…,d𝑙1…𝑑l=1,\\dots,d (yielding the hidden layers) and time steps t=1,…,T𝑡1…𝑇t=1,\\dots,T.\nSpecifically, the l𝑙l-th hidden layer is given by and the reconstructed signal at time step t𝑡t is given by 𝐬^t=𝐃𝐡t(d)subscript^𝐬𝑡superscriptsubscript𝐃𝐡𝑡𝑑\\hat{\\bm{\\mathrm{s}}}_{t}={\\bm{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t}^{(d)}; where 𝐔lsubscript𝐔𝑙\\mathbf{U}_{l}, 𝐖lsubscript𝐖𝑙\\mathbf{W}_{l}, 𝐕𝐕\\mathbf{V} are defined as The activation function is the proximal operator Φλ1c​𝗴l,λ2c​𝗴l,ℏ​(𝐮)subscriptΦsubscript𝜆1𝑐subscript𝗴𝑙subscript𝜆2𝑐subscript𝗴𝑙Planck-constant-over-2-pi𝐮\\varPhi_{\\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{c}{\\bm{\\mathsf{g}}}_{l},\\frac{\\lambda_{2}}{c}{\\bm{\\mathsf{g}}}_{l},\\bm{\\hbar}}({\\bm{\\mathrm{u}}}) with learnable parameters λ1subscript𝜆1\\lambda_{1}, λ2subscript𝜆2\\lambda_{2}, c𝑐c, 𝗴lsubscript𝗴𝑙{\\bm{\\mathsf{g}}}_{l} (see Fig. 1 for the shapes of the activation functions). Fig. 2(a) depicts the architecture of the proposed reweighted-RNN. Input vectors 𝐬tsubscript𝐬𝑡\\bm{\\mathrm{s}}_{t}, t=1,…,T𝑡1…𝑇t=1,\\dots,T are compressed by a linear measurement layer 𝐀𝐀{\\bm{\\mathrm{A}}}, resulting in compressive measurements 𝐱tsubscript𝐱𝑡{\\bm{\\mathrm{x}}}_{t}. The reconstructed vectors 𝐬^tsubscript^𝐬𝑡\\hat{\\bm{\\mathrm{s}}}_{t}, t=1,…,T𝑡1…𝑇t=1,\\dots,T, are obtained by multiplying linearly the hidden representation 𝐡t(d)superscriptsubscript𝐡𝑡𝑑{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t}^{(d)} with the dictionary 𝐃𝐃{\\bm{\\mathrm{D}}}. We train our network in an end-to-end fashion.

We now compare the proposed reweighted-RNN [Fig. 2(a)] against the recent ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-RNN  [Fig. 2(b)]. The l𝑙l-th hidden layer in ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-RNN is given by The proposed model has the following advantages over ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-RNN. Firstly, ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-RNN uses the proximal operator Φλ1c,λ2c,ℏ​(𝐮)subscriptΦsubscript𝜆1𝑐subscript𝜆2𝑐Planck-constant-over-2-pi𝐮\\varPhi_{\\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{c},\\frac{\\lambda_{2}}{c},\\bm{\\hbar}}({\\bm{\\mathrm{u}}}) as activation function, whose learnable parameters λ1subscript𝜆1\\lambda_{1}, λ2subscript𝜆2\\lambda_{2} are fixed across the network. Conversely, the corresponding parameters λ1c​𝗴lsubscript𝜆1𝑐subscript𝗴𝑙\\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{c}{\\bm{\\mathsf{g}}}_{l} and λ2c​𝗴lsubscript𝜆2𝑐subscript𝗴𝑙\\frac{\\lambda_{2}}{c}{\\bm{\\mathsf{g}}}_{l} [see (7), (8), and Fig. 1] in our proximal operator, Φλ1c​𝗴l,λ2c​𝗴l,ℏ​(𝐮)subscriptΦsubscript𝜆1𝑐subscript𝗴𝑙subscript𝜆2𝑐subscript𝗴𝑙Planck-constant-over-2-pi𝐮\\varPhi_{\\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{c}{\\bm{\\mathsf{g}}}_{l},\\frac{\\lambda_{2}}{c}{\\bm{\\mathsf{g}}}_{l},\\bm{\\hbar}}({\\bm{\\mathrm{u}}}), are learned for each hidden layer due to the reweighting vector 𝗴lsubscript𝗴𝑙{\\bm{\\mathsf{g}}}_{l}; hence, the proposed model has a different activation function for each unit per layer. The second difference comes from the set of parameters {𝐖l,𝐔l}subscript𝐖𝑙subscript𝐔𝑙\\{{\\bm{\\mathrm{W}}}_{l},{\\bm{\\mathrm{U}}}_{l}\\} in (13) and (9). The ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-RNN model uses the same {𝐖2,𝐔1}subscript𝐖2subscript𝐔1\\{{\\bm{\\mathrm{W}}}_{2},{\\bm{\\mathrm{U}}}_{1}\\} for the second and higher layers. In contrast, our reweighted-RNN has different sets of {𝐖l,𝐔l}subscript𝐖𝑙subscript𝐔𝑙\\{{\\bm{\\mathrm{W}}}_{l},{\\bm{\\mathrm{U}}}_{l}\\} per hidden layer due to the reweighting matrix 𝐙lsubscript𝐙𝑙{\\bm{\\mathrm{Z}}}_{l}. These two aspects [which are schematically highlighted in blue fonts in Fig. 2(a)] can lead to an increase in the learning capability of the proposed reweighted-RNN, especially when the depth of the model increases. In comparison to a generic stacked RNN 2 [Fig. 2(c)], reweighted-RNN promotes the inherent data structure, that is, each vector 𝐬tsubscript𝐬𝑡\\bm{\\mathrm{s}}_{t} has a sparse representation 𝐡tsubscript𝐡𝑡{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t} and consecutive 𝐡tsubscript𝐡𝑡{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t}’s are correlated. This design characteristic of the reweighted-RNN leads to residual connections which reduce the risk of vanishing gradients during training [the same idea has been shown in several works   in deep neural network literature]. Furthermore, in (10) and (12), we see a weight coupling of 𝐖lsubscript𝐖𝑙{\\bm{\\mathrm{W}}}_{l} and 𝐔lsubscript𝐔𝑙{\\bm{\\mathrm{U}}}_{l} (due to the shared components of 𝐀𝐀{\\bm{\\mathrm{A}}}, 𝐃𝐃{\\bm{\\mathrm{D}}} and 𝐙𝐙{\\bm{\\mathrm{Z}}}). This coupling satisfies the necessary condition of the convergence in  (Theorem 1). Using Theorem 2 in , it can be shown that reweighted-RNN, in theory, needs a smaller number of iterations (i.e.,\nd𝑑d in Algorithm 1) to reach convergence, compared to ISTA  and FISTA .\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: to 𝐙𝐡tsubscript𝐙𝐡𝑡{\\bm{\\mathrm{Z}}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t} differentiates Problem (II) from the reweighted ℓ1​-​ℓ1subscriptℓ1-subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}\\text{-}\\ell_{1} minimization problem in [ref]17 where 𝐙=𝐈𝐙𝐈{\\bm{\\mathrm{Z}}}={\\bm{\\mathrm{I}}}.
