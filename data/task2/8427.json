Specifically, H∗​(ℛ∙⁣→2⁣∙​(ℱ|P))subscript𝐻superscriptℛ∙→absent2∙evaluated-atℱ𝑃H_{*}(\\mathcal{R}^{\\bullet\\to 2\\bullet}(\\mathcal{F}|_{P})) is a horizontal smoothing (i.e., a smoothing in the sense of  along the first coordinate axis in ℝ≥0×ℝnsubscriptℝabsent0superscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{n}) of H∗​(ℛ∙​(ℱ|P))subscript𝐻superscriptℛ∙evaluated-atℱ𝑃H_{*}(\\mathcal{R}^{\\bullet}(\\mathcal{F}|_{P})), while H∗​(ℛδ→2​δ​(ℱ|P))subscript𝐻superscriptℛ→𝛿2𝛿evaluated-atℱ𝑃H_{*}(\\mathcal{R}^{\\delta\\to 2\\delta}(\\mathcal{F}|_{P})) is the restriction of that smoothing to some fixed vertical hyperplane {δ}×ℝn𝛿superscriptℝ𝑛\\{\\delta\\}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{n}. Similarly, the estimators 𝒪δ​(ℱ|P)superscript𝒪𝛿evaluated-atℱ𝑃\\mathcal{O}^{\\delta}(\\mathcal{F}|_{P}) and 𝒞δ​(ℱ|P)superscript𝒞𝛿evaluated-atℱ𝑃\\mathcal{C}^{\\delta}(\\mathcal{F}|_{P}) are restrictions, to that same hyperplane, of the function-offset multifiltration 𝒪∙​(ℱ|P)superscript𝒪∙evaluated-atℱ𝑃\\mathcal{O}^{\\bullet}(\\mathcal{F}|_{P}) and function-Čech multifiltration 𝒞∙​(P)superscript𝒞∙𝑃\\mathcal{C}^{\\bullet}(P), respectively. As such, all the estimators considered in the paper are based on what we designate as function-geometric multifiltrations, which combine geometric filtrations with sublevel sets of functions. The introduction of 𝒞∙​(P)superscript𝒞∙𝑃\\mathcal{C}^{\\bullet}(P) and ℛ∙​(P)superscriptℛ∙𝑃\\mathcal{R}^{\\bullet}(P) dates back to the first TDA paper on multiparameter persistence , but the study of function-geometric multifiltrations in general really took off a few years ago with the seminal work of Blumberg and Lesnick  on their robustness to perturbations of the point cloud P𝑃P and to the presence of outliers. Several such provably stable function-geometric multifiltrations have been introduced, including the multicover bifiltration  , the subdivision-Čech and subdivision-Rips bifiltrations , the degree-Čech and degree-Rips bifiltrations [ref]40. The related work focuses on their stability, computation, or approximation by sparser filtrations on finite point clouds—see e.g. [ref]1  [ref]12    . Our work offers a different perspective on function-geometric multifiltrations by studying their properties as estimators of a target related to the function 𝒻𝒻\\mathscr{f}, not to the point cloud P𝑃P.\nOur work also goes beyond the case n=1𝑛1n=1, considering arbitrary n𝑛n.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: multifiltrations have been introduced, including the multicover bifiltration  , the subdivision-Čech and subdivision-Rips bifiltrations , the degree-Čech and degree-Rips bifiltrations [ref]40.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
