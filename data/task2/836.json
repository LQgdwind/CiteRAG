      "content": "Paper Title: Information-Theoretic Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization with Continuous Approximations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we explain the technical details of the acquisition function behind iMOCA. We propose two approximations for the computation of information gain per unit cost.\n The information gain in equation 4.1 is defined as the expected reduction in entropy H(.)H(.) of the posterior distribution P​(ℱ∗|D)𝑃conditionalsuperscriptℱ𝐷P(\\mathcal{F}^{*}|D) due to evaluating 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} at fidelity vector 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z}. Based on the symmetric property of information gain, the latter can be rewritten as follows: In equation 4.3, the first term is the entropy of a K𝐾K-dimensional Gaussian distribution that can be computed in closed form as follows: In equation 4.3, the second term is an expectation over the Pareto front of the highest fidelities ℱ∗superscriptℱ\\mathcal{F}^{*}. This term can be approximated using Monte-Carlo sampling: where S𝑆S is the number of samples and ℱs∗subscriptsuperscriptℱ𝑠\\mathcal{F}^{*}_{s} denote a sample Pareto front obtained over the highest fidelity functions sampled from K𝐾K surrogate models.\nTo compute Equation 4.5, we provide algorithmic solutions to construct Pareto front samples ℱs∗subscriptsuperscriptℱ𝑠\\mathcal{F}^{*}_{s} and to compute the entropy with respect to a given Pareto front sample ℱs∗subscriptsuperscriptℱ𝑠\\mathcal{F}^{*}_{s}. Computing Pareto front samples: We first sample highest fidelity functions f~1,⋯,f~Ksubscript~𝑓1⋯subscript~𝑓𝐾\\tilde{f}_{1},\\cdots,\\tilde{f}_{K} from the posterior CF-GP models via random fourier features  . This is done similar to prior work  . We solve a cheap MO optimization problem over the K𝐾K sampled functions f~1,⋯,f~Ksubscript~𝑓1⋯subscript~𝑓𝐾\\tilde{f}_{1},\\cdots,\\tilde{f}_{K} using the popular NSGA-II algorithm  to compute the sample Pareto front ℱs∗subscriptsuperscriptℱ𝑠\\mathcal{F}^{*}_{s}. Entropy computation for a given Pareto front sample: Let ℱs∗={𝐯1,⋯,𝐯l}subscriptsuperscriptℱ𝑠superscript𝐯1⋯superscript𝐯𝑙\\mathcal{F}^{*}_{s}=\\{\\mathbf{v}^{1},\\cdots,\\mathbf{v}^{l}\\} be the sample Pareto front, where l𝑙l is the size of the Pareto front and each 𝐯i={v1i,⋯,vKi}superscript𝐯𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑣1𝑖⋯superscriptsubscript𝑣𝐾𝑖\\mathbf{v}^{i}=\\{v_{1}^{i},\\cdots,v_{K}^{i}\\} is a K𝐾K-vector evaluated at the K𝐾K sampled highest-fidelity functions. The following inequality holds for each component yjsubscript𝑦𝑗y_{j} of 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y} = (y1,⋯,yK)subscript𝑦1⋯subscript𝑦𝐾(y_{1},\\cdots,y_{K}) in the entropy term H​(𝐲|D,𝐱,𝐳,ℱs∗)𝐻conditional𝐲𝐷𝐱𝐳subscriptsuperscriptℱ𝑠H(\\mathbf{y}|D,\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z},\\mathcal{F}^{*}_{s}): where fsj⁣∗=max⁡{vj1,⋯​vjl}superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑣𝑗1⋯superscriptsubscript𝑣𝑗𝑙f_{s}^{j*}=\\max\\{v_{j}^{1},\\cdots v_{j}^{l}\\}. Essentially, this inequality says that the jt​hsuperscript𝑗𝑡ℎj^{th} component of 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y} (i.e., yjsubscript𝑦𝑗y_{j}) is upper-bounded by a value, which is the maximum of jt​hsuperscript𝑗𝑡ℎj^{th} components of all l𝑙l vectors {𝐯1,⋯,𝐯l}superscript𝐯1⋯superscript𝐯𝑙\\{\\mathbf{v}^{1},\\cdots,\\mathbf{v}^{l}\\} in the Pareto front ℱs∗subscriptsuperscriptℱ𝑠\\mathcal{F}^{*}_{s}.\nFor the ease of notation, we drop the dependency on 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} and 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z}. We use fjsubscript𝑓𝑗f_{j} to denote fj​(x)=gj​(x,zj∗)subscript𝑓𝑗𝑥subscript𝑔𝑗𝑥superscriptsubscript𝑧𝑗f_{j}(x)=g_{j}(x,z_{j}^{*}), the evaluation of the highest fidelity at x𝑥x and yjsubscript𝑦𝑗y_{j} to denote gj​(x,zj)subscript𝑔𝑗𝑥subscript𝑧𝑗g_{j}(x,z_{j}) the evaluation of gjsubscript𝑔𝑗g_{j} at a lower fidelity zj≠zj∗subscript𝑧𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑧𝑗z_{j}\\neq z_{j}^{*}. The proof of 4.6 can be divided into two cases: a) If yjsubscript𝑦𝑗y_{j} is evaluated at its highest fidelity (i.e, zj=zj∗subscript𝑧𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑧𝑗z_{j}=z_{j}^{*} and yj=fjsubscript𝑦𝑗subscript𝑓𝑗y_{j}=f_{j}), we provide a proof by contradiction for inequality 4.6. Suppose there exists some component fjsubscript𝑓𝑗f_{j} of 𝐟𝐟\\mathbf{f} such that fj>fsj⁣∗subscript𝑓𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗f_{j}>f_{s}^{j*}. However, by definition, 𝐟𝐟\\mathbf{f} is a non-dominated point because no point dominates it in the j𝑗jth dimension. This results in 𝐟∈ℱs∗𝐟subscriptsuperscriptℱ𝑠\\mathbf{f}\\in\\mathcal{F}^{*}_{s} which is a contradiction. Therefore, inequality 4.6 holds. b) If yjsubscript𝑦𝑗y_{j} is evaluated at one of its lower fidelities (i.e, zj≠zj∗subscript𝑧𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑧𝑗z_{j}\\neq z_{j}^{*}), the proof follows from the assumption that the value of lower fidelity of an objective is usually smaller than the corresponding higher fidelity, i.e., yj≤fj≤fsj⁣∗subscript𝑦𝑗subscript𝑓𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗y_{j}\\leq f_{j}\\leq f_{s}^{j*}. This is especially true for real-world optimization problems. For example, in optimizing the accuracy of a neural network with respect to its hyper-parameters, a commonly employed fidelity is the number of data samples used for training. It is reasonable to believe that the accuracy is always higher for the higher fidelity. By combining the inequality 4.6 and the fact that each function is modeled as an independent CF-GP, a common property of entropy measure allows us to decompose the entropy of a set of independent variables into a sum over entropies of individual variables : The computation of 4.7 requires the computation of the entropy of p​(yj|D,𝐱,zj,fsj⁣∗)𝑝conditionalsubscript𝑦𝑗𝐷𝐱subscript𝑧𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗p(y_{j}|D,\\mathbf{x},z_{j},f_{s}^{j*}). This is a conditional distribution that depends on the value of zjsubscript𝑧𝑗z_{j} and can be expressed as H​(yj|D,𝐱,zj,yj≤fsj⁣∗)𝐻conditionalsubscript𝑦𝑗𝐷𝐱subscript𝑧𝑗subscript𝑦𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗H(y_{j}|D,\\mathbf{x},z_{j},y_{j}\\leq f_{s}^{j*}). This entropy can be computed using two different approximations as described below: Truncated Gaussian approximation (iMOCA-T): \nAs a consequence of 4.6, which states that yj≤fsj⁣∗subscript𝑦𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗y_{j}\\leq f_{s}^{j*} also holds for all fidelities, the entropy of p​(yj|D,𝐱,zj,fsj⁣∗)𝑝conditionalsubscript𝑦𝑗𝐷𝐱subscript𝑧𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗p(y_{j}|D,\\mathbf{x},z_{j},f_{s}^{j*}) can also be approximated by the entropy of a truncated Gaussian distribution and expressed as follows: From equations 4.5, 4.4, and 4.8, we get the final expression of iMOCA-T as shown below: Extended-skew Gaussian approximation (iMOCA-E): Although equation 4.9 is sufficient for computing the entropy, this entropy can be mathematically interpreted and computed with a different approximation. The condition yj≤fsj⁣∗subscript𝑦𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗y_{j}\\leq f_{s}^{j*}, is originally expressed as fj≤fsj⁣∗subscript𝑓𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗f_{j}\\leq f_{s}^{j*}. Substituting this condition with it’s original equivalent, the entropy becomes H​(yj|D,𝐱,zj,fj≤fsj⁣∗)𝐻conditionalsubscript𝑦𝑗𝐷𝐱subscript𝑧𝑗subscript𝑓𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗H(y_{j}|D,\\mathbf{x},z_{j},f_{j}\\leq f_{s}^{j*}). Since yjsubscript𝑦𝑗y_{j} is an evaluation of the function gjsubscript𝑔𝑗g_{j} while fjsubscript𝑓𝑗f_{j} is an evaluation of the function fjsubscript𝑓𝑗f_{j}, we observe that yj|fj≤fsj⁣∗conditionalsubscript𝑦𝑗subscript𝑓𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗y_{j}|f_{j}\\leq f_{s}^{j*} follows an extended-skew Gaussian (ESG) distribution  [ref]3. It has been shown that the differential entropy of an ESG does not have a closed form expression . Therefore, we derive a simplified expression where most of the terms are analytical by manipulating the components of the entropy. We use the derivation of the entropy based on ESG formulation, proposed in (), for the multi-objective setting. In order to simplify the calculation H​(yj|D,𝐱,zj,fj≤fsj⁣∗)𝐻conditionalsubscript𝑦𝑗𝐷𝐱subscript𝑧𝑗subscript𝑓𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗H(y_{j}|D,\\mathbf{x},z_{j},f_{j}\\leq f_{s}^{j*}),\nlet us define the normalized variable Γfsj⁣∗subscriptΓsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗\\Gamma_{f_{s}^{j*}} as Γfsj⁣∗=yj−μgjγgj|fj≤fsj⁣∗subscriptΓsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗conditionalsubscript𝑦𝑗subscript𝜇subscript𝑔𝑗subscript𝛾subscript𝑔𝑗subscript𝑓𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗\\Gamma_{f_{s}^{j*}}=\\frac{y_{j}-\\mu_{g_{j}}}{\\gamma_{g_{j}}}|f_{j}\\leq f_{s}^{j*}. Γfsj⁣∗subscriptΓsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗\\Gamma_{f_{s}^{j*}} is an ESG with p.d.f whose mean μΓfsj⁣∗subscript𝜇subscriptΓsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗\\mu_{\\Gamma_{f_{s}^{j*}}} and variance σΓfsj⁣∗subscript𝜎subscriptΓsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗\\sigma_{\\Gamma_{f_{s}^{j*}}} are defined in Appendix A. We define the predictive correlation between yjsubscript𝑦𝑗y_{j} and fjsubscript𝑓𝑗f_{j} as τ=σgj,fj2σgj​σfj𝜏superscriptsubscript𝜎subscript𝑔𝑗subscript𝑓𝑗2subscript𝜎subscript𝑔𝑗subscript𝜎subscript𝑓𝑗\\tau=\\frac{\\sigma_{g_{j},f_{j}}^{2}}{\\sigma_{g_{j}}\\sigma_{f_{j}}}.\nThe entropy can be computed using the following expression. Due to lack of space, we only provide the final expression. Complete derivation for equations 4.10 and 4.11 are provided in Appendix A. From equations 4.5, 4.4 and 4.10, the final expression of iMOCA-E can be expressed as follow: The expression given by equation 4.11 is mostly analytical except for the last term. We perform numerical integration via Simpson’s rule using μΓfsj⁣∗∓γ​σ​(Γfsj⁣∗)minus-or-plussubscript𝜇subscriptΓsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗𝛾𝜎subscriptΓsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑗\\mu_{\\Gamma_{f_{s}^{j*}}}\\mp\\gamma\\sqrt{\\sigma(\\Gamma_{f_{s}^{j*}})} as the integral limits. Since this integral is over one-dimension variable, numerical integration can result in a tight approximation with low computational cost. Complete pseudo-code of iMOCA is shown in Algorithm 1. Generality of the two approximations: We observe that for any fixed value of 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}, when we choose the highest-fidelity for each function 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z}=𝐳∗superscript𝐳\\mathbf{z}^{*}: a) For iMOCA-T, we will have gi=fjsubscript𝑔𝑖subscript𝑓𝑗g_{i}=f_{j}; and b) For iMOCA-E, we will have τ=1𝜏1\\tau=1. Consequently, both equation 4.9 and equation 4.11 will degenerate to the acquisition function of MESMO optimizing only highest-fidelity functions: The main advantages of our proposed acquisition function are: cost-efficiency, computational-efficiency, and robustness to the number of Monte-Carlo samples. Indeed, our experiments demonstrate these advantages over state-of-the-art single-fidelity MO algorithms.
