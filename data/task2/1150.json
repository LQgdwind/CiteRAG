As a pioneer work, Lu et al. [ref]26 introduced generic visual relation detection as a visual task.\nIn the early stage, many works [ref]26     regard objects as isolated individuals and recognize relations between those independent object pairs. Nevertheless, these models overlook the importance of visual context. To benefit from rich global context, recent works consider each image as a whole and utilize the message passing\nmechanism [ref]21    [ref]22.\n[ref]22 introduced an end-to-end model\nthat learns to iteratively refine relationships and object predictions via message passing based on the RNNs.  proposed a multi-task framework to utilize\nsemantic associations over three tasks of object detection,\nscene graph generation, and image captioning. They found that jointly learning the three tasks achieves better performance.\nDai et al.\n[ref]21 firstly\nbrought the bias problem of SGG into attention. It presents an analysis of statistical co-occurrences between relationships and object pairs on the Visual Genome\ndataset  and draws a conclusion that these statistical co-occurrence priors provids strong regularization for relationship prediction. Besides, it encodes the global context of objects and relationships by LSTMs to\nfacilitate scene graph parsing.  incorporated statistical correlations into deep neural networks.\n utilized a dynamic tree structure to further capture the intrinsic property of scene graph and refine the results. Although  and [ref]21 proposed an unbiased metric (i.e., mean Recall), yet their performance on infrequent relationships is still far from satisfactory. The most related work to ours is . They built a graph representation of statistical correlations between object pairs and their relationships and used a graph neural network to learn the interaction between relationships and objects to generate a scene graph. Our work differs from  in two aspects. (1) Different priors. We propose a more balanced relation prior for the first time. (2) Graph of  with fixed edge weights may ignore coherent relations among visual features and lacks flexibility. In contrast, our graph structure is a combination of a learnable graph with a prior graph, which can effectively regularize the graph structure, leading to more balanced predictions.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: The notion of the scene graph is developed from visual relation detection.
