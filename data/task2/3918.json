      "content": "Paper Title: ReDFeat: Recoupling Detection and Description for Multimodal Feature Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHandcrafted Methods. Although visible deep learning features have sprung up in recent years, their handcrafted counterparts, such as SIFT , ORB  and SURF  still maintain popular in common scenes due to their robustness and cheapness  . Their cross-modal counterparts, such as MFP , SR-SIFT , PCSD 3, OS-SIFT , RIFT 8 and KAZE-SAR , still receive a large number of attention from the community of multimodal image processing due to the scarcity of well registered data that can support the deep learning methods. Both the visible and the handcrafted multimodal features focus on corner or edge detection and description, which are believed to contain information that is invariant to geometric and radiant distortion. Their successes motivate many deep learning methods 1   and us to inject edge-based priori into the training. Two-stage Deep Methods. In recent years, the deep learning ‘revolution’ has swept across the whole field of computer vision including local feature extraction. However, due to the lack of strong supervision of detection, deep local descriptors  [ref]33 2  9 had been stuck in a two-stage pipeline, in which the keypoints are extracted by classical detectors, e.g., Difference of Gaussian (DOG) , and then patches centered in those points are encoded into descriptors by DNN. This pipeline restricts the room for modifications so that most methods devote to modifying the loss functions for descriptors [ref]33 1  2. Additionally, Key.Net  takes the early effort to learn keypoint extraction with repeatability as a constraint, which is a minority of two-stage methods. Despite of the isolation between detection and description in this kind of methods, DNN still reveals strong potential for local feature extraction . Moreover, the independent constraints of detection and description in the two-stage pipeline pave the way to the joint frameworks, which are also the bases of our formulation. One-stage Deep Methods. An obvious limitation, that detection and description cannot reinforce each other, exists in the two-stage pipeline. To tackle this problem, SuperPoint 1 firstly proposes a joint detection and description framework, in which the detection and the description are trained with the synthetic supervision and the contrastive learning, respectively. To further enhance the interaction between these two steps, a framework for joint training with a semi-handcrafted local maximum mining as the detector, i.e., D2-Net 2 is proposed. The detection and description of D2-Net are not only optimized in the meantime, but also tangled for the mutual guide. However, its non-maximum suppression detector is unexplainable. Based on D2-Net, SAFeat  designs a multi-scale fusion network to extract scale-invariant features. CMMNet  applies D2-Net to multimodal scenario. So, both SAFeat and CMMNet inherit the weakness of D2Net. R2D2 7 proposes a fully learnable detector with feasible constraints and further introduces an extra learnable mask to filter out some unreliable detection. But it is unclear why the reliability should be additionally learned rather than fused into one detector. TransFeat  introduces transformer  to capture global information for local feature learning. It has been aware of the flaw of D2-Net’s detection and drawn on the local peaking loss from R2D2 to remedy the fault. Furthermore, ReinforcedPoint  and DISK , model the matching probability in a differential form, in which the detection and description are concisely coupled, and employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) to construct and optimize the matching loss. Undoubtedly, the matching performance of DISK would significantly benefit from direct optimization on matching loss, but RL is hungry for computation and data, which might not be feasible in multimodal scenario. To the best of our knowledge, besides CMMNet, MAP-Net 0 is the only joint detection and description method customized for multimodal images. However, it draws on the pipeline from DELG , whose features are specific for the image retrieval task instead of the accurate image matching task that we focus on. Therefore, we tend to conduct a further study on more feasible joint detection and description methods for cross-modal image matching.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: learning ‘revolution’ has swept across the whole field of computer vision including local feature extraction.
