      "content": "Paper Title: PyReason: Software for Open World Temporal Logic\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVarious neuro symbolic frameworks utilize an underlying logic to support capabilities such as fuzzy logic¬†, parameterization¬†[ref]2, and differentiable structures¬†. Typically, implementations of such frameworks create custom software for deduction for the particular logic used, which limits modularity and extensibility. Further, emerging neuro symbolic use cases including temporal logic over finite time periods¬† and knowledge graph reasoning¬† necessitate the need for a logical frmaework that encompasses a broad set of capabilities. Fortunately, generalized annotated logic¬†[ref]6 with various extensions¬†[ref]7   capture many of these capabilities. In this paper we present a new software package called PyReason for performing deduction using generalized annotated logic that captures many of the desired capabilities seen in various neuro symbolic frameworks including fuzzy, open world, temporal, and graph-based reasoning. Specifically, PyReason includes a core capability to reason about first order (FOL) and propositional logic statements that can be annotated with either elements of a lattice structure or functions over that lattice. Further, we have provided for additional practical syntactic and semantic extensions that allow for reasoning over knowledge graphs, temporal logic, reasoning about various network diffusion models, and predicate-constant type checking constraints. This implementation provides for a fast, memory optimized, implementation of the fixpoint operator used in the deductive process. By implementing the fixpoint operator directly (as opposed to a black box heuristic) the software enables full explainability of the result. As such is the case, this framework captures not only classical logic, but a wide variety of other logic frameworks including fuzzy logic¬†0 1 2, weighted real valued logic used in logical neural networks¬†[ref]2, van Emden‚Äôs logic¬†3, Fitting‚Äôs bilattice logic¬†4, various logic frameworks for reasoning over graphs or social networks   5 (as well as the various network diffusion models captured by those frameworks), and perhaps most importantly, logic frameworks where syntactic structure can be learned using differentiable inductive logic programming¬† 6 as well as other neuro symbolic frameworks¬†7 [ref]7. The key advantages of our approach include the following: Direct support for reasoning over knowledge graphs. Knowledge graph structures are one of the most commonly-used representations of symbolic data. While black box frameworks such as 8 also permit for reasoning over graphical structures, they do not afford the explainability of our approach. Support for annotations.\nClassical logic implementations such as Prolog¬†9 and Epilog¬† inherently do not support annotations or annotation functions, hence lack direct support for capabilities such as fuzzy operators. Further, our framework goes beyond support for fuzzy operators by enabling arbitrary functions that can be used over real values or intervals of reals. This is a key advantage to reasoning about constructs learned with neuro symbolic approaches such as [ref]2  6 7 [ref]7. Temporal Extensions. While the framework of [ref]6 was shown to capture various temporal logics, extensions such as  have provided for syntactic and semantic add-ons that explicitly represent time and allow for temporal reasoning over finite temporal sequences. Following , we use a semantic structure that represents multiple time points, but we have implemented this in a compact manner to preserve memory. Our solution allows for fuzzy versions of rules such as ‚Äúif q‚Äã(A)ùëûùê¥q(A) then r‚Äã(A)ùëüùê¥r(A) in tùë°t time steps.‚Äù Note that these capabilities are not present in nearly every current implementation of fuzzy logic. Use of interpretations. We define interpretations as annotated function over predicates and time together. It allows us to capture facts which are true before t=0ùë°0t=0. While annotated logic¬†[ref]6 can subsume various temporal logics without additional constructs, we have enabled temporal reasoning through incorporating a temporal component in interpretations. By combining annotated predicates and the time variable, we believe our framework is more flexible and suitable for emerging neuro symbolic applications involving time - as such applications will inherently require both time and real-valued annotations. Additionally, it is to be noted that we do not make a closed world assumption i.e. anything that is not mentioned in the initial set of interpretations is f‚Äãa‚Äãl‚Äãs‚Äãeùëìùëéùëôùë†ùëífalse. Instead, we consider all other interpretations to be unknown at the beginning of time. Graphical Knowledge Structures. We also implement  which provides graphical syntactic extensions to [ref]6. This is included in our implementation, notably adding extended syntactic operators for reasoning in such structures (e.g., an existential operator requiring the existence of kùëòk items). An example of such a rule would be a fuzzy version of ‚Äúif q‚Äã(A)ùëûùê¥q(A) and there exist kùëòk number of BùêµB‚Äôs such that b‚Äã(A,B)ùëèùê¥ùêµb(A,B) then r‚Äã(A)ùëüùê¥r(A)‚Äù.111Note that while this example is classical, PyReason supports fully annotated logic, allowing for arbitarily defined fuzzy operators (e.g., t-norms); See section¬†2 and online supplement for technical details. Reduction to computational complexity due to grounding. Our software leverages both the inherent sparsity of the graphical structure along with a novel implementation of predicate-constant type checking constraints that significantly improves utility in a variety of application domains but also provide drastic reduction to complexity induced by the grounding problem. We are not aware of any other framework for first-order logic that provides both such capabilities. Ability to detect and resolve inconsistencies in reasoning. As logical inferences are deduced through applications of the fixpoint operator over predefined logical rules, logical inconsistencies can not only be detected but also located exactly where in the inference process the inconsistency occurred. We resolve any such inconsistencies by leveraging uncertainty. In the software implementation, as soon as an inconsistency is detected we relax and fix the bounds to complete uncertainty. The ability to check and locate inconsistencies enhance the explainability feature. Neuro symbolic approaches like¬†[ref]2 [ref]7 may also look to leverage inconsistency as part of loss during the training phase. In section¬†2, we outline the syntax and semantics of [ref]6 as well as our extensions. Our software implementation is described in section¬†3 and is expanded upon in the online only supplement. In section¬†4, we provide experimental results of our framework to demonstrate reasoning capabilities in two different real-world domains. We have conducted experiments on a supply-chain¬† (10‚ÄãK10ùêæ10K constants), and a social media¬† (1.6‚ÄãM1.6ùëÄ1.6M constants) dataset. For evaluation, we used various manually-curated logic programs specifying rules for the temporal evolution of the graph, completion of the graph, and other such practical use-cases (e.g., identifying potential supply chain disruptions) and examined how various aspects affect runtime and memory usage (e.g., number of constants, predicates, timesteps, inference steps, etc.). The results show that both runtime and memory remain almost constant over large ranges, and then scale sub-linearly with increase in network size.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Various neuro symbolic frameworks utilize an underlying logic to support capabilities such as fuzzy logic¬†, parameterization¬†[ref]2, and differentiable structures¬†.
