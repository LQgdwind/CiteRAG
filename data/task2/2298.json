However, results on the efficient computation of explanations for\nwell-known KC languages are scarce.\nFor example,   \npropose compilation algorithms (which are worst-case exponential) to\ngenerate the PI-explanations from OBDDs.\nConcretely, a classifier is compiled into an OBDD, which is then\ncompiled into an OBDD representing the PI-explanations of the original\nclassifier.\nFurthermore,  proves that if a KC language satisfies\nCD, FO, and IM, then one PI-explanation can be\ncomputed in polynomial time. Unfortunately, a large number of KC\nlanguages of interest do not simultaneously satisfy CD,\nFO, and IM. This is the case for example with OBDD, SDD,\nd-DNNF, among others. Moreover,   proves that\nthere are polynomial time algorithms for d-DNNF for a number of\nXAI-relevant queries, with the exception of DPI (deriving a prime\nimplicant explanation).\nFinally, Barceló et al.  focus on smallest\nPI-explanations, and prove a number of NP-hardness results. Knowledge compilation (KC) languages also find a growing range of\napplications in constraint programming.\nConcrete examples include the compilation of constraints into\nMulti-Valued Decision Diagrams [ref]22  (and\ntheir use in the context of multi-objective\noptimization , among a number of other use cases) or\nd-DNNFs , but also for restoring consistency and\ncomputing explanations of dynamic CSPs , among\nothers.\nAlthough explanations for classifiers find a growing interest in ML\nand related fields, explanations of KC languages can also find a wider\nrange of applications, including reasoning about compiled\nconstraints.\nMoreover, even though recent years have witnessed a growing interest\nin finding explanations of machine learning (ML)\nmodels 5   1,\nexplanations have been studied from different perspectives and in\ndifferent branches of AI at least since the\n80s [ref]51 9 5,\nincluding more recently in constraint\nprogramming   .\nThe use of NP oracles for computing explanations has also been\ninvestigated in recent years  ,\nwhere the NP oracle can represent a CP/SMT/MILP reasoner. (With a mild\nabuse of notation, when we refer to an NP oracle it is assumed that for\nthe accepted instances, a witness will be returned by the oracle.)\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: Knowledge compilation (KC) languages also find a growing range of\napplications in constraint programming.\nConcrete examples include the compilation of constraints into\nMulti-Valued Decision Diagrams [ref]22  (and\ntheir use in the context of multi-objective\noptimization , among a number of other use cases) or\nd-DNNFs , but also for restoring consistency and\ncomputing explanations of dynamic\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
