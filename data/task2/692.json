      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-node Bert-pretraining: Cost-efficient Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe utilized data parallelism [ref]28 for multi-node training. To characterize the hardware topology, we use the name \"<X>M<Y>G\" to encode X number of \"Machines\" and \"Y\" number of \"GPUs\" on each machine. Table 1 shows our 32M8G hardware setup to conduct training. This setup has a unit cost of $19.5K per node, which is much less expensive than the unit price of a single DGX system, which ranges from $150K to $400K [ref]13. The system also offers more flexibility because it is more cost effective for light-weight computing needs, which do not utilize the interconnects as heavily as is required in distributed training for some large models. For simplicity, let us consider a simple scenario of a 2-node, 4 GPUs each, setup as shown in Figure 1. Each node will have four NVIDIA T4 cards in our case and are connected through PCIe. Nodes will be connected through network card. For the software stack, we used NVIDIA’s PyTorch implementation of the BERT model . Table 2 shows the software stack of our training program. We also utilized NCCL v2.4.8-1  as our distributed training backend framework that implements data parallelism [ref]28. In addition, NCCL  also auto detects the network topology upon setting up connections among nodes in order to form a ring topology if possible . When doing training in the context of data parallelism [ref]28, mini-batches of data are split into individual devices. In the forward pass, the calculated gradients will be collected. Gradients will be exchanged through PCIe within a node and through network card across different nodes, after which the parametres are updated based on the aggregated results. In particular, the PCIe gradient pass is independent with the network card gradient pass. During the backward pass, the whole model’s gradients in any device will need to be passed to all other devices as each device contains a full replica of the model in data parallelism. As such, we can tell from the previous bandwidth comparison that the network gradient transmission will certainly lag behind the PCIe gradient transmission. And we will see later that this is indeed the case: the time needed for completing a backward pass is dominated by the gradient exchange time spent over the network.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: We utilized data parallelism [ref]28 for multi-node training.
