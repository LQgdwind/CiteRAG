      "content": "Paper Title: BD-MSA: Body decouple VHR Remote Sensing Image Change Detection method guided by multi-scale feature information aggregation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nChange detection (CD) is a technique for determining whether a change has occurred at the same area by examining images of that location at different times . Binary change detection is a popular technique that analyzes information between two images to determine whether a pixel in one image has changed. It then categorizes the pixels in the image as either changed or unchanged. One of the fundamental and essential issues in remote sensing is the interpretation of very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing (RS) images. VHR remote sensing image change detection (RSCD) is useful for a variety of remote sensing applications, including urban land use analysis , urban planning , urban sprawl analysis , disaster assessment , and so on. The challenge in RSCD is capturing the connections between regions of interest between bi-temporal images while disregarding interference from other regions. At the same time, several irritating elements such as seasonality in the bi-temporal and image quality issues such as noise and contrast are not of importance and should be ignored when performing CD. The two primary streams of CD in RS images are the traditional method and the deep learning method, which has gained popularity in the last decade. Several strategies for detecting changes in RS images have been proposed before using deep learning to RS images on a broad scale. Coppin and Bauer  employed a pixel-based change detection method for RSCD, which detects changes in gray values or colors by comparing images from two points in time pixel by pixel. Deng et al.  discovered and quantified land use change using PCA and a hybrid classifier that includes both unsupervised and supervised classification. He et al.  combined texture change information with standard spectral-based change vector analysis (CVA), resulting in integrated spectral and texture change information. Wu et al. [ref]9 used slow feature analysis to isolate the most time-undeformed section of a multi-temporal image and migrate it to a new feature space, effectively concealing the image’s unaltered pixels. Although these techniques have produced good results, they have certain drawbacks because they rely on standard image processing: Traditional techniques often necessitate the manual design of features, which may necessitate domain expertise and experience; When dealing with complicated sceneries, varied lighting conditions, and multi-category changes, traditional approaches have rather weak generalization capacity; For supervised learning, traditional methods often necessitate enormous amounts of manually labeled data. Deep learning is a technique that has evolved tremendously quickly in the previous decade, and deep learning-based computer vision has achieved exceptional performance in RSCD tasks because to CNNs’ robust feature extraction capabilities. Deep learning computer vision based RSCD techniques can be divided into three categories based on the structure of these models: pure convolution based, attention mechanism based, and Transformer based. The above can be categorized as 1) Fully Convolutional (FC-EF, FC-Siam-Di, FC-Siam-Conc) 0, Improved UNet++ 1, IFNet 2, CDNet 3, DTCDSCN 4, TINY-CD 5, these models simply extract features from RS images using CNNs, which make it difficult to capture long-term dependencies across images and may be insensitive to complicated scene changes. 2) MSPSNet 6, DSAMNet 7, HANet 8, STANet 9, SNUNet 0, ADS-Net 1, DARNet 2, SRCDNet 3, TFI-GR 4, the strategies described above boost the model’s sensitivity to crucial regions and help improve change detection accuracy, but it is challenging to collect global information in bi-temporal images. 3) BIT 5, ChangeFormer 6, RSP-BIT 7, SwinSUNet 8, MTCNet 9, TransUNetCD 0, DMATNet 1, FTN 2, AMTNet 3, Hybrid-transcd 4, when compared to traditional convolutional approaches, Transformer can handle long-range relationships better, but its ability to extract local contextual information is poor and computationally expensive. Although the methods described above produced outstanding results in the RSCD task, they have certain flaws. Because of their narrow local perceptual domain and susceptibility to spatial fluctuations, pure convolution-based approaches have limited degrees of feature extraction for RSCD. Second, when executing RSCD, the approach based on the attention mechanism can only take into consideration the local information in the feature map and cannot aggregate the global information. Third, the Transformer-based solution lacks the link between contexts in the details, and the arithmetic need is excessively large. It is worth mentioning that the changing camera angles for different time phases, as well as the fact that most RS photographs are not shot at an angle perpendicular to the ground, result in shadows on various features in the enormous number of RS images. Furthermore, thin clouds appear in some RS photographs as a result of meteorological conditions. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the majority of the buildings in the image are inclined and cast long shadows on the ground, and thin clouds can be seen in some of the photographs. When executing RSCD, the margins of the change region are likely to get blurred due to the aforementioned issue. As a result, we prefer to address this issue during model training. Targeting the two aforementioned primary issues—that is, the inability of current RSCD methods to effectively aggregate global and local feature information simultaneously and the blurring of change region edges as a result of feature shadowing in remote sensing images—we proposed BD-MSA, a model that can simultaneously aggregate global and local information in multi-scale feature maps and decouple the change region’s center from its edges during training. The contributions of this paper are as follows: The Overall Feature Aggregation Module (OFAM), which we proposed in this paper, is a technique that can simultaneously aggregated global and local information in both channel and spatial dimensions. It can adapt feature information at different scales in the backbone part while effectively increasing the model’s accuracy; Given the large difference in recognition accuracy between the main body and the edge of the changing region in the RSCD task, this paper designs a Decouple Module in the prediction head part that can effectively separate the main body and the edge of the changing region, and the experimental results show that using this module improves the model’s recognition accuracy for the edge; Since the MixFFN module in SegFormer can capture intricate feature representations in the network, this paper presents the module in the network decoder, enhancing the feature extraction and generalization capabilities of the model; Extensive studies show that the technique presented in this work outperforms existing models on the public datasets DSIFN-CD and S2Looking, achieving the SOTA (state-of-the-art) performance. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The prior approaches are introduced in section II. The model’s detail described in this paper is introduced in Section III. Section IV conducts experiments to compare this paper’s method with related methods. This paper is summarized in Section V.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: classification.
