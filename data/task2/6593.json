      "content": "Paper Title: A Causal Ordering Prior for Unsupervised Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFollowing the common cause principle [ref]36, causal relationships between variables also imply statistical dependencies. Recent works have shown that it is possible to model causal relationships given access to either interventional or non-i.i.d. data. To this end, the method in  uses an injective polynomial decoder and the overall model is trained on both observational and interventional data. Similarly,  consider the case of an injective linear decoder and directly optimize the score function of the distribution (in both the latent and observation space). In [ref]29 a setting where observations are collected before and after unknown interventions (i.e. counterfactual data) is introduced, while [ref]3 extends this idea to causal graphs of higher complexity. Under the non-iid scenario,  focuses on extracting causal factors from spatiotemporal data by performing interventions across different time steps. There also exist works that assume some level of supervision, i.e. having access to ground-truth causal factors.  propose a method based on the GAN framework where the prior follows a nonlinear Structural Causal Model (SCM). Others  instead model exogenous noise directly, which is then mapped to causal latent variables via a linear SCM. Table 1 describes data and latent space assumptions of previously existing models in comparison to the proposed method.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: Following the common cause principle [ref]36, causal relationships between variables also imply statistical dependencies.
