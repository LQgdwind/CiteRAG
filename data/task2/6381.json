      "content": "Paper Title: Diff-TTSG: Denoising probabilistic integrated speech and gesture synthesis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFace-to-face (i.e., embodied) human communication involves both spoken and non-verbal aspects.\nThe latter include gaze, facial expression, proxemics, and co-speech gestures – head, arm, hand, and body motions that co-occur with speech.\nThe speech and gesture modalities are closely linked and originate from a shared representation of the message the speaker intends to convey .\nGestures may complement or supplement the spoken words, or even replace words entirely  .\nCrucially, the presence of gestures have been shown to enhance both human-human  and human-machine communication\n[ref]4 [ref]5.\nFor this reason, the automatic synthesis of speech and gestures are considered key enabling technologies for Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) such as virtual avatars and social robots. Despite the common origin of human spoken and non-verbal communication, speech synthesis and gesture generation have hitherto largely been treated as separate problems by non-overlapping research communities.\nText-to-speech research and data has historically focussed on speech read aloud by a voice actor, whilst human gesticulation is associated with spontaneous speech uttered in conversation.\nCombining read-style text-to-speech (TTS) with spontaneous speech-to-gesture (STG), using two different systems typically trained on data from different actors results in incoherent expression in the ECA [ref]6.\nIt may also degrade gesture quality, due to mismatch between the natural speech audio used during STG training and the synthetic audio used to drive gesticulation at synthesis time . Noticing the above discrepancies, there have been a few proposals to integrate the synthesis of both\nmodalities into one single text-driven system  , a problem termed integrated speech and gesture synthesis, or ISG.\nThis is compelling not only because it better resembles the intertwined manner in which communicative behaviour is generated in humans, but also because gesture-motion synthesis and speech-synthesis acoustic modelling are mathematically very similar problems: both may accept text as input and both produce a sequence of continuous-valued vectors as output.\nThey may thus be modelled using similar approaches.\nISG also eliminates redundancies, enabling more compact systems that are faster to run . However, unlike the synthesis of read-aloud speech from text –\nwhere TTS can reach similar naturalness scores as recorded human speech  – spontaneous speech synthesis and the synthesis of gesture motion both present more challenging modelling problems.\nApproaches that learn to solve both problems simultaneously\nare still in their infancy, providing an exciting research target.\nThe challenges are both due to the scarcity of high-quality data (e.g., spontaneous speech is rarely captured in controlled conditions; accurate 3D motion data requires marker-based motion capture) and due to the wide variety of different behaviours and expressions in such data; cf. 0.\nAn accurate description of the full spectrum of human embodied-communication behaviour thus calls for probabilistic approaches based on powerful deep generative models.\n In this paper, we propose the first diffusion model for learning to synthesise speech audio and body gestures together from text.\nUnlike the previous ISG state of the art, our approach is probabilistic, non-autoregressive, and, importantly, can be trained on small datsets from scratch.\nThis removes previous needs for pre-training on large speech datasets and multi-stage training with parts of the network frozen.\nWe perform an in-depth\nevaluation of our proposal using both uni-modal and multimodal subjective tests, disentanging synthesis quality in different modalities from their appropriateness for each other.\nOur results find significant improvements over the prior state of the art in all aspects studied.\nFor video examples and code, please see https://shivammehta25.github.io/Diff-TTSG/.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: may complement or supplement the spoken words, or even replace words entirely  .\nCrucially, the presence of gestures have been shown to enhance both human-human  and human-machine communication\n[ref]4 [ref]5.\nFor this reason, the automatic synthesis of speech and gestures are considered key enabling technologies for Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) such as virtual avatars and social\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
