Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: OTAvatar:One-shot Talking Face Avatar with Controllable Tri-plane Rendering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVolume rendering is a 3D rendering strategy and has demonstrated its success in novel view synthesis. Existing methods either use volume [ref]11 [ref]21 to explicitly represent 3D space or implicitly store the 3D scene in the MLP network . These methods are introduced to animate 3D-consistent portraits. Yu et al. 2 and Raj et al.  retrieved the spatial information from sparse support views to render portraits. On the other side, The 3D face generative model can reconstruct a given identity using GAN Inversion. These models vary from pure MLP architecture , to low-resolution neural rendering followed by an up-sampling strategy  , and to using more efficient 3D presentation . All these methods only support rendering static portraits. To animate the avatar with controllable motion, AD-NeRF and NeRFace introduce either the audio feature or 3DMM expression coefficients to the NeRF model to render dynamic heads. Nerfies employs a deformation field conditioned on spatial points to represent the face motion of different frames. HyperNeRF adds an ambient slicing network to tackle the topological drawback of Nerfies. Though these methods have achieved motion control and view consistency for face avatars, they all overfit each NeRF model to one subject, thus lack generalizability. HeadNeRF  is trained on both multi-view and frontal face datasets and can be generalized to multiple identities and support motion control using 3DMM coefficients, but its rendering quality is not satisfactory compared with the given portrait, and the motion control is unnatural with random jitters. In contrast, our method can reconstruct photo-realistic face avatars in one shot and animate natural talking motion.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: Volume rendering is a 3D rendering strategy and has demonstrated its success in novel view synthesis.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
