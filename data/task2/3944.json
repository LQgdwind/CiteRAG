      "content": "Paper Title: Nebula-I: A General Framework for Collaboratively Training Deep Learning Models on Low-Bandwidth Cloud Clusters\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe rapid evolution of pre-trained models are toward the trend of involving more and higher-quality data, larger amount of parameters and stronger computing power   [ref]3   [ref]6    0. It naturally relies on increasingly more compute cost and time, e.g. training the BERT-large 345 million model took 6.16E PF-days, training the GPT-3 175 billion model consumed 3.64E+03E PF-days [ref]3. On the one hand, larger models tend to obtain better performances, especially on few- and zero-shot learning tasks [ref]6 0, which can greatly empower the AI industry. On the other hand, the increasing demand of compute brings about challenges and triggers more explorations on the development of advanced distributed training techniques as well as the optimization of large-scale resource scheduling and allocation strategies. There have been extensive researches that focus on parallel computing for training large deep learning models. The most popular techniques include data parallism 1 2, model parallism 3 4, pipeline parallism 5 6 and hybrid parallism 4 7, which aim to accelerate the training process from different dimensions. These techniques have already been widely applied in the training of recent pre-trained models and obtained considerable speed-up ratios [ref]3  [ref]6 0. As the model size continues to grow, e.g. from 170 billion [ref]3 to 540 billion 0, more problems arise. One of the practical problems is: it will become more frequent that the spare resources one cluster can provide are insufficient to satisfy the training of a large model, which is particular common for business clusters. A direct intuition to address the problem is to expand the computing power by building larger-scale of hardware. With the development of nationwide infrastructure construction, many organizations have built super computers or intelligent clusters distributed in different locations. Each of these clusters, however, only serves independently in most cases. Shi et al. introduced a method to train deep learning models on public cloud clusters, which utilizes distributed compute connected by networks 8. This inspires us to explore potential solutions to connect the computational resources of different cloud clusters and train models in a collaborative style. Meanwhile, the modularity of many deep learning algorithms enables the decoupling of a model into different components, which could be dispatched to multiple clusters. However, there also exist many challenges. For example, as the connections between cloud clusters are usually low-bandwidth (even much lower than those mentioned in 8), especially between different locations, communication efficiency will easily become a bottleneck. To take a step forward, in this work, we proposed Nebula-I, a unified framework for collaboratively training deep learning models over public cloud clusters, especially on clusters connected by low-bandwidth wide area networks (WANs). Nebula-I is a stack of optimization layers together with a security layer, which is designed to better assist the deployment of a deep learning model on the cloud environment. Using Nebula-I, a model can be decoulpled and dispatched to different clusters which are then work collaboratively to execute certain tasks. Our motivations of proposing Nebula-I are in three folds. Firstly, we aim to set up practical solutions for pre-training larger models collaboratively over cloud clusters, in which the tasks are carried out using compute aggregated from different locations. Secondly, we would like to explore more possibilities that the cloud environment can support, to fully realize the functionality of cloud clusters and existed pre-trained models. Lastly, we expect Nebula-I can provide user-friendly interfaces that can minimize the development of end users who are willing to train models over the clouds. We demonstrated how Nebula-I works using two natural language processing (NLP) scenarios that include: a) pre-training a multilingual language model using two remote clusters, and b) fine-tuning a machine translation model using knowledge distilled from pre-trained models. These two steps form into the most popular training paradigm of recent deep learning methods, which can cover a large variety of training tasks. In our demonstration, we deployed Nebula-I on remote cloud clusters with heterogeneous architectures, i.e. GPU and NPU clusters from Baidu and Peng Cheng Laboratory. The connections between the clusters are low-bandwidth WANs (only up to 170Mbit/s and 60Mbit/s), which is significantly lower than those within a cluster. This raises great challenges for the communication efficiency especially for training cases that need frequent data exchanges. Experiments were conducted on both the scenarios to validate the effectiveness of Nebula-I. For Scenario-I, we show the computation efficiency using Nebula-I in pre-training over two remote clusters by comparing the throughput and verify that the model can converge well on the cloud environment. Specifically, we generated new state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on a series of cross-lingual natural language inference tasks with the multilingual model pre-trained under a novel learning framework and Nebula-I. For Scenario-II, we compared the knowledge-enhanced model with Transformer-base 9 and show that the accelerated model can well preserve the performance running across clusters. Different communication optimization combinations have been compared as well. The contribution of this work can be summarized as follows: We introduce a novel framework that well fits distributed deep learning over remote cloud clusters, which are connected by low-bandwidth networks; We propose a unified optimization technique in Nebula-I, named Nebula-Optimizer, that can jointly optimize the training strategy, parallization and communication; Both pre-training and fine-tuning scenarios have been validated on the cloud environment, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework; We output a multilingual pre-trained language model, ERNIE-M Extra, which has obtained new SoTA results on cross-lingual natural language inference tasks, under the proposed novel multilingual learning framework and Nebula-I. To our knowledge, this is the first work that decently introduces collaborative training techniques over cloud clusters, which could inspire further researches to delve into this area.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: The rapid evolution of pre-trained models are toward the trend of involving more and higher-quality data, larger amount of parameters and stronger computing power   [ref]3   [ref]6    0.
