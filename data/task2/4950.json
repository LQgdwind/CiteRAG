      "content": "Paper Title: No-Box Attacks on 3D Point Cloud Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become a go-to approach for many problems in image processing and computer vision     due to their ability to model complex input-output relationships from a relatively limited set of data. However, studies have also shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks  [ref]6. An adversarial attack involves constructing an input to the model (adversarial example) whose purpose is to cause the model to make a wrong decision.\nMuch literature has been devoted to the construction of 2D adversarial examples for image analysis models and the exploration of related defenses    [ref]6 . Research on adversarial attacks and defenses has gradually expanded to 3D point cloud models as well, especially point cloud classification 0 1 2 3 4. Point clouds themselves have become an increasingly important research topic 5 6 7 8. Given a deep model for point cloud classification, a number of methods have been proposed to determine critical points that could be used in an adversarial attack 9 0 1. For example, Zheng et al. 9 proposed a differentiable method of shifting points to the center of the cloud, known as a saliency map technique, which approximates point dropping and assigns contribution scores to input points based on the resulting loss value. Other methods to determine critical points similarly try to estimate the effect of point disturbance on the output. Once the critical points have been determined, they can be used to create adversarial examples.\nSeveral recent studies 0 2 1 use critical points as initial positions and then introduce perturbations to create attacks. Usually, some distance-related criteria, such as Hausdorff 1 or the Chamfer distance 1, are used to constrain perturbations around critical positions.\nInstead of perturbation, another kind of attack drops the critical points; for example, the well-known Drop100 and Drop200 attacks 9 drop, respectively, 100 and 200 points from the point cloud in order to force the model to make a wrong decision. These are considered to be among the most challenging attacks to defend against 3 4 0 5. The methods mentioned above, and others in the literature, require access to the DNN model in order to determine critical points. For example, “white-box” attacks have access to the model’s internal architecture and parameters, while “black-box” attacks are able to query the model and obtain its output, but without the knowledge of internal details 4. These approaches are in line with the popular view in the literature [ref]6: that the existence of adversarial examples is a flaw of the model, that they exist because the model is overly parametrized, nonlinear, etc. According to this reasoning, each model has its own flaws, i.e., its own critical points. Another view is that adversarial examples are consequences of the data distribution on which the model is trained 6. This would suggest that different models trained on the same data may share some adversarial examples, but they have to be determined in the context of the data distribution. In this paper, we present a different point of view. We show that it is possible to determine critical points in point clouds from the features of the point cloud itself, without access to the target DNN model or the data distribution. This is referred to as a “no-box” adversarial attack 7. To our knowledge, our work is the first on no-box attacks in the point cloud literature. In a broader context, no-box attacks suggest that critical points in point clouds are not only consequences of the flaws of deep models, nor the data distribution, but also inherent characteristics of the point clouds themselves, which give them their crucial properties that are important in their analysis, i.e., what makes an airplane - an airplane, or a chair - a chair.\nIn addition to the novel point of view, our methodology leads to a less computationally expensive way\nof generating adversarial attacks compared to other methods.\nFurthermore, the attack has the potential to generalize better and be more transferrable to different models, as it is not dependent on any particular target DNN model. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The related work is discussed in Section II, together with a more detailed explanation of our contribution. Our proposed methodology is presented in Sections III and IV.\nThe experimental results are reported in Section V, followed by conclusions in Section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: vision     due to their ability to model complex input-output relationships from a relatively limited set of data.
