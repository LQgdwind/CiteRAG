There can be various types of similarities between any two companies, which can be naturally represented as heterogeneous edges in the graph. Moreover, the strength of each relation can be captured by assigning appropriate edge weights. Such a graph-based representation enables the use of heuristic algorithms or GNN models for searching and identifying similar companies, based on their structural and attribute-level similarities.\nAccording to our survey888We have reviewed graph datasets in SNAP [ref]30, OGB , Network Repository , Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co), Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com) and Data World (https://data.world), most public graph datasets are designed for predicting node , edge  or graph [ref]35 level properties, while our graph is tailored for company similarity quantification999Formally, it is equivalent to edge prediction, yet edge prediction methods like GraphSAGE usually assume an exhaustive edge representation in the graph, which is not the case in CompanyKG as discussed in SectionÂ 3.1..\nThe most common entities in KGs are web pages , papers [ref]37, particles , persons  and so on.\nRelato Business Graph101010https://data.world/datasyndrome/relato-business-graph-database, which also represents companies as node entities, is the dataset most similar to ours. However, its limited scale and absence of edges with explicit implications of company similarity could constrain its suitability for quantifying company similarity.\nTo address this, we build CompanyKG, a large-scale company KG that incorporates diverse and weighted similarity relationships in its edges.\nWe present extensive benchmarking results for 11 reproducible baselines categorized into three groups: node-only, edge-only, and node+edge.\nTo the best of our knowledge, CompanyKG is the first large-scale heterogeneous graph dataset originating from a real-world investment platform, tailored for quantifying inter-company similarity.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: or GNN models for searching and identifying similar companies, based on their structural and attribute-level similarities.\nAccording to our survey888We have reviewed graph datasets in SNAP [ref]30, OGB , Network Repository , Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co), Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com) and Data World (https://data.world), most public graph datasets are designed for predicting\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
