      "content": "Paper Title: Pairwise Symmetry Reasoning for Multi-Agent Path Finding Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMulti-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)  is a combinatorial problem that asks us\nto plan collision-free paths for a team of moving agents while minimizing the sum of their travel times.\nIt is a core problem in a variety of real-world applications, including (but not limited to) automated warehousing  ,\nautonomous intersection management , drone swarm coordination , and video game character control .\nHigh-quality MAPF solutions are important for many of these applications, and thus\nnumerous optimal and bounded-suboptimal algorithms have been suggested in recent years, despite the fact that MAPF is NP-hard to solve optimally on general graphs  [ref]8, directed graphs [ref]9,\nplanar graphs 0, and\ngrids 1.\nThe current leading (bounded-sub)optimal algorithms (e.g., 2 3 4 5) either are based on\nConflict-Based Search (CBS) 6 or employ a similar strategy to CBS, whose central idea is to plan paths for each agent independently first by ignoring other agents and resolve collisions afterwards.\nThough each such algorithm proceeds in a different way,\nthey face\nthe same essential difficulty due to a phenomena called pairwise symmetry, which occurs when two agents have many different paths to their target locations, but every combination of them results in a collision. In order to prove that the solutions these algorithms return are (bounded-sub)optimal, they have to\nenumerate a dramatically large number of the combinations of these colliding paths. Figure 1 shows an example of a rectangle symmetry. There exists for each agent multiple shortest paths. Each path is grid symmetric: it can be derived from any other path by simply changing the order of the individual RIGHT and DOWN moves. All shortest paths for the two agents collide somewhere inside the yellow rectangular area. The optimal strategy here is for one agent to wait for the other. To find such a solution, however, optimal MAPF algorithms must first prove that every combination of wait-free paths leads to collisions. Yet the number of possible combinations of wait-free paths grows exponentially with the size of the yellow rectangular area, i.e., the larger the area, the harder the optimality proof.\n∎ In this work, we consider three challenging situations, each commonly found in\npopular MAPF domains and involving pairs of colliding agents: rectangle symmetry, which arises when two agents repeatedly collide along many different shortest paths. target symmetry, which arises one moving agent repeatedly collides with another stopped agent. corridor symmetry, which arises when two agents moving in opposite directions repeatedly collide inside a narrow passage. For each type of symmetries, we propose new algorithmic reasoning\ntechniques that can identify the situation at hand and resolve it in a single branching step by the addition of symmetry-breaking constraints.\nWe explore these ideas in the context of a leading and popular optimal MAPF algorithm CBS 6 (or, more precisely, its advanced variant CBSH 7). On the one hand,\nwe give a rigorous theoretical analysis which shows that our symmetry reasoning techniques preserve the completeness and optimality for CBS. On\nthe other hand, we evaluate the impact of these symmetry reasoning techniques in a wide\nrange of empirical comparisons, showing that the symmetry reasoning techniques can lead\nto an exponential reduction in CBS node expansions. In one headline\nresult, we show that our resulting algorithm CBSH-RTC resolves the majority of\ntwo-agent collisions in just a single branching step. In another headline\nresult, we report substantial improvement of the symmetry reasoning techniques on CBSH and its improved variants CBSH2 8 and Mutex Propagation 9 in terms of both runtime and percentage of instances solved within the runtime limit. Preliminary versions of this work appeared in AAAI 2019 0 and ICAPS 2020 1. Compared to those versions, this paper provides a more comprehensive description and discussion of pairwise symmetries, new generalized versions of rectangle and corridor reasoning techniques (see Sections 6 and 9), and an extended empirical evaluation, including comparison with CBSH2 and mutex propagation (see Section 11).\nAlthough we demonstrate our symmetry reasoning techniques only in the context of solving classic MAPF problems with the optimal MAPF algorithm CBS in this paper,\nthey can be applied and, indeed, based on our preliminary work, have already been applied to other generalized MAPF problems 2 and other optimal and bounded-suboptimal MAPF algorithms 4 5 3.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: of these applications, and thus\nnumerous optimal and bounded-suboptimal algorithms have been suggested in recent years, despite the fact that MAPF is NP-hard to solve optimally on general graphs  [ref]8, directed graphs [ref]9,\nplanar graphs 0, and\ngrids 1.\nThe current leading (bounded-sub)optimal algorithms (e.g., 2 3 4 5) either are based on\nConflict-Based Search (CBS) 6 or employ a similar\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
