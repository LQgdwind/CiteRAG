      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable computational algorithms for geo-spatial COVID-19 spread in high performance computing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section we apply two-grid RAS - V3 preconditioner to the region of Southern Ontario. This region, consisting of 272727 public health units (PHUs), is densely populated, accounting for 95% of the population of the province of Ontario, while only occupying approximately 13% of area .\nThe public data on COVID-19 statistics from these PHUs can help to infer the status of COVID-19 infections in time and space. We utilize the open source software QGIS  to define the geographical boundaries and generate a mesh file . The meshed domain is then subdivided into different subdomains for the domain decomposition solver. The mesh of Southern Ontario subdivided into 200200200 subdomains is shown in Fig. 7 (overlapping parts not shown for clarity). Note these subdomains do not correspond to the aforementioned PHUs. The initial conditions are obtained from publicly reported testing data on September 1, 2020. We generate densities of each compartment as a sum of 27 Gaussian pulses, centered at main city of each PHU (following similar approach as ), where each (xi,yi)subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖(x_{i},y_{i}) are the coordinates of the cities, and Bisubscript𝐵𝑖B_{i} represents the radius around (xi,yisubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖x_{i},y_{i}) which captures 95 % of the population of the it​hsuperscript𝑖𝑡ℎi^{th} PHU. The value of Aisubscript𝐴𝑖A_{i} is a constant which ensures that the integral of the two dimensional function over the entire domain equals to the total number of people in the respective compartment for that PHU. The time-invariant rate parameters of the SEIRD model (γEsubscript𝛾𝐸\\gamma_{E}, σ𝜎\\sigma and γRsubscript𝛾𝑅\\gamma_{R}) are based on clinically relevant information regarding average duration of infection, average time to detection, and an assumed detection rate (80%percent8080\\%)  . The time-varying infection rate parameters βEsubscript𝛽𝐸\\beta_{E}, βIsubscript𝛽𝐼\\beta_{I}, rate of death γDsubscript𝛾𝐷\\gamma_{D} and the diffusion coefficients νS,νE,νI,νRsubscript𝜈𝑆subscript𝜈𝐸subscript𝜈𝐼subscript𝜈𝑅\\nu_{S},\\nu_{E},\\nu_{I},\\nu_{R} are estimated using the testing and death statistics data collected during the six-month period from September 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021, representing the second wave of infection in the province .\nWe define the infection rate parameter as a sigmoid function to mimic the sudden reduction in disease transmission following the provincial lockdown after the 2020 holiday season as shown in Fig. 8(a𝑎a). Furthermore, we subdivide the domain of Southern Ontario into western, central and eastern regions as in Fig. 8(b𝑏b). The central region contains many PHUs with large populations in close proximity to one another. This region is separated from the larger population centres in the eastern and western regions of the province by large areas of low population density. In order to capture this spatio-temporal variation of infection rate, we assume, where, with xeasternsubscript𝑥easternx_{\\rm{eastern}} and xwesternsubscript𝑥westernx_{\\rm{western}} denoting the longitudinal boundaries separating the eastern from the central region and the central from the western region of the domain, respectively. Similarly βeasternsubscript𝛽eastern\\beta_{\\rm{eastern}}, βcentralsubscript𝛽central\\beta_{\\rm{central}} and βwesternsubscript𝛽western\\beta_{\\rm{western}} are the infection rates in the corresponding regions.\nIn Eq. 30, we model the spatial variation for βi​(𝐱,t)subscript𝛽𝑖𝐱𝑡\\beta_{i}(\\mathbf{x},t) and βe​(𝐱,t)subscript𝛽𝑒𝐱𝑡\\beta_{e}(\\mathbf{x},t) along the longitude x𝑥x, but they are invarient along the latitude y𝑦y. We adopt a simple calibration step by which the averaged results of PDE case with negligible diffusion is initially matched with the aggregated case counts for all PHUs in Southern Ontario.\nNext, the diffusion coefficients νS,νE,νIsubscript𝜈𝑆subscript𝜈𝐸subscript𝜈𝐼\\nu_{S},\\nu_{E},\\nu_{I} and νRsubscript𝜈𝑅\\nu_{R} are changed to model the localized spatial interaction/spread of the different compartments. These parameters are calibrated through simulations to ensure that they encourage sufficient mixing of the population within the city without causing significant inter-city population movements. Finally, we determine unique values of βeastern,βcentralsubscript𝛽easternsubscript𝛽central\\beta_{\\rm{eastern}},\\beta_{\\rm{central}}, and βwesternsubscript𝛽western\\beta_{\\rm{western}} by concurrently matching the reported data both at the provincial level (globally) and at the major population centres (locally). Fig. 9 shows the averaged infected population counts for different regions against the reported field data. There is reasonable agreement between the trends in the observed data and the numerical solutions. As described above, a full scale statistical (e.g., Bayesian) inference of all the model parameters were not pursued currently as the objective is to illustrate the performance (e.g., scalabilities) of the parallel solvers. To improve the agreement between the numerical simulation and the observed case counts, the Bayesian calibration method is currently being implemented by the authors and its findings will be reported in future publications. The contour plots in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 show the interaction of the populations of adjacent PHUs in the central region (containing the densely populated Greater Toronto and Hamilton areas) as the case counts increase. We observe similar growth in the number of infections in the more isolated regions of Windsor in the western region, and Ottawa in the eastern region. The use of a heterogeneous population density-dependent diffusion coefficients permit the mixing of the population at a relatively local scale within individual PHUs and with adjacent PHUs in high density regions. This does not permit for a realistic account of the spread of the disease among the population centres that are separated by regions of low-density. In this case, more sophisticated methods such as in [ref]7 which uses kinetic transport equations to model commuters and diffusion to model non-commuters, or 0 which defines an anisotropic diffusion coefficient according to various geographical features (such as highway networks, rivers and mountains) would be required. A more rigorous framework would permit for the effects of human mobility patterns (e.g., 6 ) to reflect the spatial spread. Note that the spatial variability in COVID-19 incidence rates can be related to various social and economic parameters (e.g.,  and 6). These variations can be captured in the model by including much finer stratifications of age and socio-economic status as described in .\nAlthough the critical demands of intensive care unit (ICU) beds, increased infections to co-morbid people or children, implications of post-acute COVID-19 (long covid) etc., could also be modelled by introducing appropriate compartments (see Appendix C), these aspects are considered in the current investigation. The strong and weak scalabilities of the proposed solver is tested for the case of Southern Ontario with increasing number of processes. Fig. 12 shows the preconditioner setup and solve times. A fixed system size of 92.5792.5792.57 million is tested with upto 178017801780 processes in order to demonstrate strong scaling (evidenced by the reduction of execution time with more processes). Weak scalability plot shows only small increase in solve time with the increase in total problem size from 15.4615.4615.46 to 92.5792.5792.57 million. From the scalability plots, we can extrapolate that forecasts of infections for three months can be obtained for a model size of 92.5792.5792.57 million within 777 hours using 178017801780 processes. Currently, we have only employed deterministic modelling with constant parameters showing the excellent scalability of DD-based preconditioners. However, model parameters like infection rate, diffusion coefficient, recovery rates etc., and initial conditions of the system are not precisely known. Moreover, error in modelling and noise in the data could also be accounted with a stochastic error term. It is thus important to consider a stochastic model to calibrate and reliably predict the infections with uncertainty bounds. The increased dimensionality and increase in time taken for likelihood evaluations with the sampling approach could be effectively reduced using the sampling-free approaches and domain decomposition based solvers 8 7 2. Details on future works of extending this five-compartment model to 22-compartment model and applying state of the art Bayesian inference algorithms for reliable predictions are provided in .\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: does not permit for a realistic account of the spread of the disease among the population centres that are separated by regions of low-density.
