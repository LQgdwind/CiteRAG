      "content": "Paper Title: Understanding in Artificial Intelligence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProgram synthesis is the task of learning programs (code) from examples of input and output data. This task is strongly linked to an AI that understands, since induced programs provide explainability (via symbolic rules),\nenable reasoning, and also result in a structured representation of an input.\nEarly attempts utilized Genetic programming  to evolve programs , and interest in the field has gained new strength with the success of program-like neural network models. This section describes recent techniques for program synthesis and how they relate to an AI that understands.  introduce Recursive-Reverse-Recursive Neural Network (R3NN) to incrementally construct programs conforming to a pre-specified Domain Specific Language (DSL). R3NN is a tree structured generation model that is trained with supervision, and it was able to solve the majority of Flash-Fill benchmarks , which consist on synthesizing programs built on regular expressions to perform the desired string transformation. However R3NN did not generalize well to larger programs nor does it seem to scale well computationally for more complex tasks. Poor generalization is a known issue in program synthesis.  address this problem by augmenting neural architectures with recursion. They apply Neural Programming Architecture (NPA) to four tasks: grade-school addition, bubble sort, topological sort, and quicksort; and they demonstrate that recursion improves accuracy.  employ general-purpose symbolic solvers for Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) problems  to learn SVRT (Synthetic Visual Reasoning Test) concepts [ref]186 such as spatial relationships between objects. Training is unsupervised, but the symbolic solvers do not scale well to more complex problems and there is no soft-reasoning. One reason why symbolic solvers do not scale well is that the search space grows exponentially. DeepCoder  addresses this problem by learning an embedding for the functions of a DSL to guide the (beam) search for program candidates.  were able to further improve and accelerate DeepCoder by learning to remove intermediate variables.  implemented a differentiable program interpreter utilizing a DSL inspired by functional programming, but they found, in agreement with , that discrete search-based techniques for program synthesis such as Œª2superscriptùúÜ2\\lambda^{2}  perform better than differentiable programming approaches. Later work by  extend a differentiable programming language with neural networks, enabling the combination of functions with learnable elements, in a similar fashion to Neural Network Modules  with symbolic modules. Discrete search-based techniques for program synthesis are also a focus of , who in addition highlight the importance of recursion. Using reinforcement learning, they demonstrate significantly improved generalization for learning context-free parsers. Similarly, improved generalization for equation verification and completion was achieved by  using Tree-LSTMs  with weakly supervised training. Recent work by [ref]195 further advances the above line of research, introducing the novel reinforcement learning algorithm AlphaNPI with structural biases for modularity, hierarchy and recursion. Program induction is similar to Program Synthesis in that a program needs to be learned from input-output examples, however, in Program induction the program is not explicit and not part of the result . In spirit, methods for Program induction tend to be closer to neural networks than to symbolic computing. For instance, architectures such as the Neural Turing Machine  , the Differential Neural Computer  , the Neural programmer [ref]200, Neural programmer-interpreters  [ref]195, Neural Program Lattices , the Neural State Machine [ref]200, and most recently MEMO  extend neural networks with external memory, and can infer simple algorithms such as adding numbers, copying, sorting and path finding.  illustrates the use of DeepProbLog to solve three program induction tasks and compare their results to Differentiable Forth (‚àÇ44\\partial 4) . The first of the three examples looks at calculating the resulting digit and the carry digit given the sum of two digits and the previous carry digit. The results between DeepProbLog and ‚àÇ44\\partial 4 where the same, with both obtaining 100% accuracy for training lengths of up to 8 digits and 64 testing digits. The second program induction problem they looked at was the bubble sort algorithm. Given a list of unsorted digits, the task is to arrange the digits in a sorted list. The program was tasked to figure out the action in each step of the bubble. DeepProbLog showed higher accuracy than ‚àÇ44\\partial 4 for input lists of length bigger than 3 and did so in a fraction of the time ‚àÇ44\\partial 4 was able to. The final program induction problem was solving algebraic word problems, where the program had to decide on the order of input digits and the mathematical operation required in each step. As with the first problem, similar results were obtained between DeepProbLog and ‚àÇ44\\partial 4, 96.5% and 96.0% respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [186]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]186: demonstrate that recursion improves accuracy.  employ general-purpose symbolic solvers for Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) problems  to learn SVRT (Synthetic Visual Reasoning Test) concepts [ref]186 such as spatial relationships between objects.
