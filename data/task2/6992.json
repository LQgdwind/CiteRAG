      "content": "Paper Title: The Complexity of Verifying Boolean Programs as Differentially Private\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider programs from a simple probabilistic while-like programming language over boolean data, where randomness is represented as probabilistic choice. We call this language BPWhile. This language can be seen as a low-level target language for differential privacy implementations which are intrinsically over finite data types   [ref]3 . As a first step, we show 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE}-hardness for Approximate-DP over this language, with respect to the size of the program. We show this result by using a reduction from the problem of deciding almost sure termination for programs in BPWhile. Programs in this language can be seen as discrete-time recursive Markov chains for which almost sure termination has been shown 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE}-complete .\nIntuitively, the hardness of verifying whether a program is differentially private comes from the fact that we need to compare distributions on outputs for neighboring pairs of inputs. Understanding such distributions essentially gives us a way to check whether a program terminates with probability 1 or not. We use this idea in all 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE}-hardness proofs in this work. We then present an algorithm for Approximate-DP which uses polynomial space, completing our proof of 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE}-completeness for Approximate-DP. Our algorithm is based on classical results showing that computing hitting probabilities in discrete-time Markov chains can be done in a space efficient way.\nOur proof of 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE}-completeness even holds in the case where the privacy parameter δ𝛿\\delta is zero—this setting is usually called pure differential privacy. Similarly to , we also consider a related problem concerning the approximation of privacy parameters. In particular, we study the following gap-promise variant of the problem. Distinguish (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-DP: Given a program that is promised to either be (0,0)00(0,0)-differentially private or not (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-differentially private, decide which is the case. Here, ε,δ𝜀𝛿\\varepsilon,\\delta may be fixed constants independent of the input. We show that this problem is also 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE}-hard via another reduction from the problem of deciding almost sure termination. At first glance, the statement seems specific to (0,0)00(0,0)-differentially privacy, but it implies more generally that it\nis hard to distinguish between (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-differentially private programs and programs which fail to be (ε+α,δ+β)𝜀𝛼𝛿𝛽(\\varepsilon+\\alpha,\\delta+\\beta)-differentially private for positive constants α,β𝛼𝛽\\alpha,\\beta.\nIn particular, it is hard even to approximate the best ε𝜀\\varepsilon and δ𝛿\\delta parameters for which a program guarantees differential privacy. Further, we consider several relaxations of the definition of differential privacy which have recently appeared in the literature. Specifically, we consider deciding Rényi-differential privacy (RDP) [ref]42, concentrated differential privacy (CDP) , and truncated concentrated differential privacy (tCDP) . For each of these privacy notions we define a gap version of the problem of deciding whether a program is private or not and we show that all of them are 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE}-complete. To show membership in 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE} we use similar approach as in the 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE}-algorithm for Decide (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-DP. The main difference is that definitions of RDP, CDP, and tCDP involve computations of Rényi divergences and, as we are working with probabilities that can have exponentially long descriptions, we carefully apply known uniform families of polylogarithmic depth circuits to perform these calculations. We prove our lower bounds using reductions from Distinguish (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-DP. To summarize, our contributions are: We give a proof of 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE}-hardness for the problem of deciding (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-differential privacy (by showing a polynomial time reduction from the language of almost surely terminating programs, Section 5.4). We show a 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE} algorithm for deciding (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-differential privacy (Section 5.3). We show 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE}-hardness for the problem of approximating the privacy parameters (Section 6). We show 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE} algorithms for deciding Rényi-differential privacy (Section 7.1), concentrated differential privacy (Section 7.2), and truncated differential privacy (Section 7.3). We also give a proof of 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE}-hardness for deciding Rényi-differential privacy (Theorem 7.3), concentrated differential privacy (Theorem 7.9), and truncated concentrated differential privacy (Theorem 7.13) (via reductions from the problem of approximating privacy parameters, Section 6).\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: choice.
