      "content": "Paper Title: Fast Subtrajectory Similarity Search in Road Networks under Weighted Edit Distance Constraints\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTrajectory Similarity Functions.‚Äâ\nTrajectory similarity functions can be classified into:\n\n\n(1) coordinate-aware similarity functions are defined based on spatial coordinates of trajectories      6 and\n\n(2) network-aware similarity functions employ network features, such as travel costs         4.\n\n\nCoordinate-aware similarity functions include dynamic time warping (DTW), edit distance with real penalty (ERP) , edit distance on real sequence (EDR) , edit distance with projections (EDwP) , and Fr√©chet distance.\nTheir pros and cons were investigated in    4 .\nERP and EDR are WED instances. DTW, EDwP, and Fr√©chet distance are not. Recent effort aimed to learn deep trajectory representations¬† or metrics¬†2 to reduce the computation of similarity to linear time.\nFor network-aware similarity functions,\na natural way is to measure the shared or unshared edges.\nWeighted Jaccard distance¬† and weighted Dice distance¬†\nare order-insensitive functions (i.e., edge ordering not incorporated).\nLongest common subsequences (LCSS)¬† ,\nLongest overlapping road segments (LORS)¬†, and longest common road segments (LCRS)¬†4 are order-sensitive functions,\nwhile they do not belong to\n\nWED¬†444See Appendix¬†F for semantic comparison of LORS,\nLCRS, and SURS..\nAnother strategy is to incorporate shortest path distances between vertices¬†    . Trajectory Indexing.‚Äâ\nAlthough much attention has been gathered to indexing for non-constrained trajectories (see surveys  ), indexing methods for trajectories in road networks are also studied actively      4.\nChen¬†et¬†al. proposed ERP¬† and EDR¬† along with the query processing algorithms.\nWang¬†et¬†al.¬† and Yuan and Li¬†4 proposed algorithms to support various similarity functions but they were designed for whole matching (though can be adapted for subtrajectories, see our experiments).\nFurthermore, their filtering policies are different from ours (based on scanning postings lists for all symbols¬† or prefix symbols¬†4 of a query).\nShang et al.¬† and Xie et al.¬† proposed distributed systems for similarity search under DTW and discrete Fr√©che/Hausdorff distances, respectively.\nThese methods   support only whole matching. Pivot points were proposed in  for pruning. The differences from our method are:\n\n\n(1) The pivots are selected by turning points or the distance to neighbor points/origin/destination, while our œÑùúè\\tau-subsequence is chosen by a selectivity optimization algorithm.\n\n(2) In contrast to pivot points, our filtering is designed towards the general case of WED, and thus does not require individual adaptation for specific similarity functions.\n\n String / Time-series Similarity Search.‚Äâ\nEdit distance has been employed for string similarity search.\nBouding techniques (e.g., by qùëûq-grams¬†  )\nare widely used.\nIn bioinformatics, three types of similarity search methods are used: global , local [ref]43  0, and semi-global\nalignments . The Smith-Waterman algorithm¬†[ref]43 can be used for WED.\nTrajectories also belong to time series data, whose similarity is often measured by\nEuclidean distance, DTW, ERP, or LCSS.\nCommon indexing methods are based on lower bounding¬† .\nSubstring similarity search can be carried out by indexing methods based on suffix arrays (or suffix-tries)¬† .\nOur BT method can be regarded as a method that dynamically builds prefix- and suffix-tries for verification instead of a static trie.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: has been employed for string similarity search.\nBouding techniques (e.g., by qùëûq-grams¬†  )\nare widely used.\nIn bioinformatics, three types of similarity search methods are used: global , local [ref]43  0, and semi-global\nalignments .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
