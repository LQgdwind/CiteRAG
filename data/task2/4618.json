      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamics-Adaptive Continual Reinforcement Learning via Progressive Contextualization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n1) RL in Continuous Spaces:\nRL is commonly studied following the MDP framework, which is defined as a tuple M=⟨𝒮,𝒜,𝒫,ℛ,γ⟩𝑀𝒮𝒜𝒫ℛ𝛾M=\\langle\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R},\\gamma\\rangle,\nwhere 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} is the set of states; 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is the set of actions; 𝒫:𝒮×𝒜×𝒮→ :𝒫→𝒮𝒜𝒮01\\mathcal{P}:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\times\\mathcal{S}\\rightarrow  is the transition probability function; ℛ:𝒮×𝒜×𝒮→ℝ:ℛ→𝒮𝒜𝒮ℝ\\mathcal{R}:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\times\\mathcal{S}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} is the reward function, and γ∈ 𝛾01\\gamma\\in  is the discount factor. At each time step t∈ℕ𝑡ℕt\\in\\mathbb{N}, the agent moves from stsubscript𝑠𝑡s_{t} to st+1subscript𝑠𝑡1s_{t+1} with probability p​(st+1|st,at)𝑝conditionalsubscript𝑠𝑡1subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑎𝑡p(s_{t+1}|s_{t},a_{t}) after it takes action atsubscript𝑎𝑡a_{t}, and receives instant reward rtsubscript𝑟𝑡r_{t}. Most RL algorithms rely on the mechanism of policy gradient to handle tasks with continuous state and action spaces. In such cases, the policy is defined as a function π:𝒮×𝒜→ :𝜋→𝒮𝒜01\\pi:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow , mapping each state to a probability distribution of actions, with ∑a∈𝒜π​(a|s)=1subscript𝑎𝒜𝜋conditional𝑎𝑠1\\sum_{a\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\pi(a|s)=1,∀s∈𝒮for-all𝑠𝒮\\forall s\\in\\mathcal{S}. If only the state space is continuous, the policy can use the Boltzmann distribution to select discrete actions, while when the action space is also continuous, the Gaussian distribution is commonly used. The goal of policy-based RL is to find an optimal policy π∗superscript𝜋∗\\pi^{\\ast} with internal parameter θ∈Θ𝜃Θ\\theta\\in\\Theta that maximizes the expected long-term discount return where the expectation is over the complete trajectory τ𝜏\\tau generated following πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta} until the end of the agent’s lifetime. In basic policy gradient methods (e.g., REINFORCE[ref]52), the action-selection distribution is usually parameterized by a deep neural network trained by taking the gradient ascent with the partial derivative of the objective (i.e., maximize the excepted return) with respect to the policy parameters. The policy gradient can be approximated expressed as where (τ1,τ2,…,τN)superscript𝜏1superscript𝜏2…superscript𝜏𝑁(\\tau^{1},\\tau^{2},\\dots,\\tau^{N}) is a batch of learning trajectories sampled from policy πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta} to estimate the return expectation. 2) CRL in Dynamic Environments: Following the convention in , in this article, we consider the dynamic environment as an infinite sequence of stationary tasks where each task corresponds to the specific environmental dynamics within its time period and the same dynamics may recur more than once across different time periods.\nThe time period is assumed to be long enough for the agent to get sufficient experience samples to finish policy learning for the associated task. Suppose that there is a space of MDPs denoted as ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}, and a dynamic environment 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} changing over time in ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}. The CRL agent interacts with 𝒟=[M1,M2,…,Mt−1,Mt,…]𝒟subscript𝑀1subscript𝑀2…subscript𝑀𝑡1subscript𝑀𝑡…\\mathcal{D}=[M_{1},M_{2},\\dots,M_{t-1},M_{t},\\dots], where each Mt∈ℳsubscript𝑀𝑡ℳM_{t}\\in\\mathcal{M} is a specific MDP/task that is stationary in the tthsuperscript𝑡tht^{\\rm th} time period.\nIn practice, the time period t𝑡t can be thought of as a task inference period, where Mtsubscript𝑀𝑡M_{t} is the corresponding task within it. Compared with Mt−1subscript𝑀𝑡1M_{t-1}, Mtsubscript𝑀𝑡M_{t} is either the same task as Mt−1subscript𝑀𝑡1M_{t-1} or changes into another different new or previous one. In this process, the identity and actual change point of each task are both unknown to the agent. It should be highlighted that, to represent the policies for multiple tasks with a single model, the inputs (observations) must at the very least implicitly contain the discriminative information of the tasks.\nIn this setting, the goal of CRL agent in dynamic environments in time period t𝑡t is to extend the acquired knowledge, accumulated from previously learned tasks [M1,M2,…,Mt−1]subscript𝑀1subscript𝑀2…subscript𝑀𝑡1[M_{1},M_{2},\\dots,M_{t-1}], to the current task Mtsubscript𝑀𝑡M_{t}, to learn a single policy to achieve the maximum return on all learned tasks [M1,M2,…,Mt]subscript𝑀1subscript𝑀2…subscript𝑀𝑡[M_{1},M_{2},\\dots,M_{t}]: where JMisubscript𝐽subscript𝑀𝑖J_{M_{i}} is the expected return on task Misubscript𝑀𝑖M_{i}.\nNote that the agent is expected to learn a sequence of tasks one by one strategically so that it can retain the previously acquired knowledge when learning new tasks.\nIn other words, the policy π𝜋\\pi with parameter θt∗superscriptsubscript𝜃𝑡∗\\theta_{t}^{\\ast} in (3) is an approximate optimal policy over all learned tasks [M1,M2,…,Mt]subscript𝑀1subscript𝑀2…subscript𝑀𝑡[M_{1},M_{2},\\dots,M_{t}]. In this article, the overall performance of the learned policy across all tasks is the primary metric for judging the performance of CRL agents.\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: where the expectation is over the complete trajectory τ𝜏\\tau generated following πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta} until the end of the agent’s lifetime.
