Liu et al  proposed a heuristic algorithm for big data task scheduling based on thermal-aware and DVFS-enabled techniques to minimize the total energy consumption of data centers. Kim et al.  modeled real-time service as VM requests and proposed several DVFS algorithms to reduce energy consumption for the DVFS-enabled cluster.\nCheng et al.  proposed a heterogeneity-aware task assignment approach to improve the overall energy consumption in a heterogeneous Hadoop cluster without sacrificing job performance.\nTeng et al.  presented a set of heuristic algorithms by taking advantage of DVFS and VM consolidation together for batch-oriented scenarios.\nNguyen et al. [ref]21 introduced a virtual machine consolidation algorithm with multiple usage prediction to improve the energy efficiency of cloud data centers. Our work differs from these efforts in several perspectives: (1) none of these DVFS-based and VM consolidation approaches can function well if the whole system is overloaded; (2) none of them put the efforts to schedule the mixed type of workloads; (3) none of them applied the renewable energy to power their systems.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: without sacrificing job performance.\nTeng et al.  presented a set of heuristic algorithms by taking advantage of DVFS and VM consolidation together for batch-oriented scenarios.\nNguyen et al.
