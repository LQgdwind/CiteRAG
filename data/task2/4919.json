      "content": "Paper Title: MixMask: Revisiting Masking Strategy for Siamese ConvNets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSelf-supervised learning is a widely adopted paradigm to learn representations from input data without human-annotated labels. In the computer vision domain, it has shown superior performance in various tasks, such as classification, detection, and segmentation. One prevalent self-supervised learning framework is the Siamese Network with two branches. The distance between the two branches is calculated using a similarity loss  , contrastive loss   , or distillation loss . Recently, Masked Image Modeling (MIM)  [ref]20 [ref]3 [ref]1 has emerged and proven to be an effective approach to learning useful representation. To fully leverage the advantages from both the masked design and siamese networks, Masked Siamese Network (MSN) [ref]1 upon ViT has been proposed. Meanwhile, convolutional networks as ConvNeXt  and its V2  achieve competitive results in both supervised and unsupervised scenarios, highlighting ConvNets’ potential.\nA recent work of Masked Siamese ConvNets (MSCN)  has extended MSN [ref]1 to the ConvNet-based encoder. However, this approach simply employs the masking scheme from MIM [ref]20 [ref]3 without adapting it to the peculiarities of Siamese ConvNet. Moreover, both MSN and MSCN heavily rely on the multicrop strategy introduced in   to improve the performance that is hindered by erasing operation. For instance, MSN generates ten additional views using focal mask on each iteration, and MSCN generates two extra views, which are computationally expensive for training. In general, erase-based masking heavily synergizes with the image patchify mechanism in ViT , which produces image patches that are independently processed by the encoder. Such independent patch-wise processing of an image allows to simply drop masked patches thus decreasing the computational cost [ref]20. In contrast, ConvNets process data continuously, which is not rational for dropping masked patches, ultimately leading to the same computing time, yet masked patches no longer contain meaningful semantic information. However, another issue comes from the fact that multiple contrastive frameworks use embedding loss  , which is not designed to recover the erased regions but to discriminate between the inputs. Furthermore, several works   indicate that contrastive loss tends to learn more global and coarse-grained features. Masking operation destroys such global features leading to the slower convergence of a model.\nThis is different from vision transformer based MIM methods [ref]20 [ref]3 that will recover the masked regions by operating on the pixel space using reconstruction loss. Therefore, we identify two main drawbacks of Masked Siamese ConvNets: (I)\nRegular erase-based masking operation disrupts the global features that are important for the contrastive objective  . It is straightforward that vanilla masking will drop semantic information from the input data and cannot be recovered by post-processing. For instance, if we mask 25% of image areas, 25% of information will be lost during training, and it will encumber the training efficiency. Thus, a better masking strategy is necessary to encourage models to learn better representations. (II) The default “symmetric” 111Our symmetric and asymmetric refer to a semantic distance in a single loss term, while other literature use symmetric and asymmetric in the sense of adding an additional symmetric component to the loss where two views appear in the symmetric order. semantic distance loss in the siamese networks that does not take into account the semantic distance change between different views of the same image after the masking operation. Clearly, when arbitrary regions of the image get erased, the global semantic meaning of the image changes as well. An original image of a dog in the center has a substantially different meaning compared to the same image, where regions containing different body parts of a dog are masked and no longer visible. Such symmetric loss design brings relatively low influence when both of the branches are masked. However, it causes a negative effect inevitably when only one branch is masked in the architecture. Since asymmetric siamese networks  have been observed to be more effective to learn, a more flexible loss design with soft distance is crucial to reflect the true semantic distance between the two asymmetric branches in masked siamese convnets. To address these two drawbacks, in this work, we propose to use a filling-based masking strategy to avoid information loss from erasing operation. Specifically, instead of erasing random areas in an image, we will randomly select another image and use its pixel values to fill the masked areas. Furthermore, instead of using discrete random masking that is applied in [ref]20, we found using block-wise masking will give better performance since it can better preserve global information important for contrastive loss. Together with our mask-filling strategy block-wise masking fills the uninformative erased regions with global views from other images in a batch. To reflect the semantic distance change after the filling operation we incorporate the asymmetric loss design introduced in . Compared to the erase-based strategy of MSCN, the filling-based masking method replaces uninformative erased regions with regions providing more meaningful semantic information of the input space, it does not require multicrops and only needs one additional view per image, which is more efficient than MSN and MSCN using ten and two cropping pairs. Such information from filling-based masking can be exploited by siamese networks to enhance the representation during training. Our ablation experiments show that this is a better masking solution for the Masked Siamese ConvNets. We conducted comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K datasets to evaluate our proposed method. We integrated our approach into multiple Siamese ConvNets, including MoCo, BYOL, SimCLR, and SimSiam. Our method significantly improves various baseline models across all datasets. Additionally, we evaluated our learned models on the semi-supervised and supervised finetuning, as well as downstream tasks such as object detection and segmentation, and consistently observed improvements. Our contributions in this work are as follows: We reveal that Siamese ConvNets exhibit lower convergence using the traditional erase-based masking scheme. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective filling-based masking strategy that is more aligned with the image-level contrastive objective for self-supervised Siamese ConvNets. We show that block-wise masking provides superior performance on Masked Siamese ConvNets to the discrete random masking, commonly used in self-supervised representation learning frameworks [ref]20  [ref]1. This observation highlights the difference of our method from MSCN  and Un-Mix . We integrate a flexible loss design with soft distance to adapt the integrated masking and siamese architecture, as well as to avoid mismatches between transformed input and objective in Masked Siamese ConvNets. Extensive experiments are performed on various datasets and siamese frameworks to demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method. We verify that our approach is consistently superior to MSCN on linear probing, semi-supervised fine-tuning, detection and segmentation downstream tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: Siamese Network with two branches.
