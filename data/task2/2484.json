      "content": "Paper Title: Second-order phase-field formulations for anisotropic brittle fracture\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPredicting the fracture behavior in brittle materials with anisotropic fracture toughness is still a challenge. The extension to the anisotropic case of selection criteria for the crack direction which have proved successful in fracture mechanics of isotropic materials, such as the principle of local symmetry   and the maximum energy release rate criterion , is by no means trivial . The generalized energy release rate criterion   , where the crack propagation direction is chosen by maximizing the ratio of the energy release rate to the fracture toughness with respect to the propagation angle, was shown to correlate successfully with experiments on materials exhibiting both weak [ref]29 and strong  anisotropy in the fracture toughness, see also the detailed review and discussion in . The variational phase-field approach to fracture, pioneered by Bourdin et al.  and first proposed as the regularization of Francfort and Marigo‚Äôs variational fracture formulation [ref]17, was recently extended to materials with anisotropic fracture toughness. Hakim and Karma   proposed a phase-field model for materials featuring two-fold weak anisotropy and elucidated several features of crack propagation in these materials. This model was extended to the three-dimensional setting including geometric nonlinearity and nonlinear elasticity  and to the consideration of multiple cleavage planes using multiple phase-field variables . With the purpose of tackling phenomena such as sawtooth crack patterns and forbidden crack directions, which are directly related to four-fold strongly anisotropic surface energies, Li et al.  formulated a fourth-order anisotropic variational fracture model inspired by phase-field models of crystal growth. Similarly, Teichtmeister et al.  formulated second- and fourth-order phase-field models based on structural tensors for two-fold and four-fold symmetry, respectively, and extended the framework to large deformations. Li and Maurini  improved and simplified the phase-field model in  in order to enable an analytical solution for the optimal crack profile, while keeping the fundamental properties of the phase-field approximation. Once again, four-fold symmetry was addressed with a fourth-order model. In this paper, we address brittle fracture in anisotropic materials featuring two-fold and four-fold symmetric fracture toughness and develop two variational phase-field models based on the family of regularizations proposed by Focardi , who also proved their ŒìŒì\\Gamma-convergence. The main novelty lies in the model for four-fold symmetric anisotropy: as opposed to all previously available models for the same type of anisotropy, our proposed model is of second order, hence it does not require higher-continuity basis functions nor mixed variational principles for finite element discretization. For the four-fold symmetric formulation we show that the standard quadratic degradation function is unsuitable and propose a procedure to derive a suitable one. The performance of the new models is assessed via several numerical examples that simulate anisotropic fracture under anti-plane shear loading. For both formulations at fixed displacements, we also provide some existence and uniqueness results for the phase-field solution. The remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces basic concepts on anisotropy of fracture properties that serve as basis for the following investigation. In Section 3, we recall the phase-field formulation of (isotropic) brittle fracture based on the Ambrosio-Tortorelli regularization and introduce the main results in , which are our point of departure for the new developments in the subsequent sections. We show that the models based on the Focardi regularization combined with the Euclidean norm, which we term isotropic Foc-pùëùp models, can be viewed as a family of models which includes the well-known AT-2 model as a special case (corresponding to the isotropic Foc-222 model). In Section 4, we focus on the isotropic Foc-444 model. We show that the standard quadratic degradation function is unsuitable for this model, we derive a new suitable one, and we test the ensuing formulation on an anti-plane shear numerical setup. In Section 5, we develop the anisotropic counterparts of the isotropic Foc-2 and Foc-4 formulations, which model an anisotropic fracture behavior with two- and four-fold symmetric fracture toughness, respectively. Section 6 illustrates the numerical tests on the two anisotropic formulations for different anti-plane shear setups. We draw the main conclusions in Section 7. Appendix A reports some existence and uniqueness results on both anisotropic formulations.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: the ratio of the energy release rate to the fracture toughness with respect to the propagation angle, was shown to correlate successfully with experiments on materials exhibiting both weak [ref]29 and strong  anisotropy in the fracture toughness, see also the detailed review and discussion in .
