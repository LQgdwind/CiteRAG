      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Learning for Cross-Domain Data Fusion in Urban Computing: Taxonomy, Advances, and Outlook\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCities, indispensable components of modern civilization, have undergone transformative trajectories propelled by human advancements in cultural, financial, political, and technological domains   . Despite their pivotal role in societal progress, the unprecedented surge in global urbanization since the 19th century has precipitated formidable sustainability challenges including energy consumption  , environmental pollution  , socio-economic disparities  [ref]145, and urban traffic issues  [ref]145. In the 21st century, the profound strides achieved in machine learning and spatio-tempral data mining have manifested in myriad successful applications across diverse domains, such as finance  , biology  , and healthcare  . This surge in technological prowess has incited a notable shift in research focus, with scholars now directing their attention toward harnessing these advancements to optimize the intricate facets of urban planning, operations, management, etc. A pivotal contribution to this evolving discourse is the pioneering work , which encapsulated and elucidated these endeavors by introducing the concept of Urban Computing. This paradigm leverages sensing technologies and expansive computing infrastructure to scrutinize voluminous data emanating from urban spaces. The fundamental objective is to gain profound insights into the dynamics of cities, thereby addressing challenges such as traffic congestion   , energy consumption  , and air quality pollution   . Urban computing necessitates the integration of extensive and diverse datasets sourced from various sources and modalities  , also referred to as Cross-Domain Data Fusion, which arises from the recognition that relying solely on a singular data source or modality may prove inadequate for the holistic implementation of urban tasks. In recent years, a growing number of studies in urban computing are expanding cross-domain data fusion to encompass diverse sources like sensors , satellites [ref]178, social media , and citizen-generated data . Additionally, there is a trend towards introducing new data modalities, including text (e.g., social media posts  and geographic information  ) and images (e.g., satellite [ref]178   and street-view images [ref]178  ). Figure 1 depicts the cross-domain data fusion in urban computing from the views of data modality and source. Prior research, exemplified by Zheng et al. , emphasized the critical role of cross-domain data fusion in amalgamating information from multiple sources. With the emergence of data fusion studies in urban computing, Zheng  classified the related fusion methodologies into three types: stage-based, feature level-based, and semantic-based data fusion. Furthermore, within the purview of semantic-based methods, a more intricate taxonomy emerges, delineating four subtypes: multi-view learning-based, similarity-based, probabilistic dependency-based, and transfer learning-based methods. Over the past decade, the emergence of Deep Learning (DL) has asserted dominance in processing spatio-temporal data in urban computing 69 . In contrast to traditional machine learning methods, these models present distinct superiority, characterized by larger model capacity, automated feature extraction capabilities, and inherent compatibility with cross-domain data fusion. The paradigm shift derived from deep learning renders previous surveys, especially , on urban data fusion somewhat obsolete, as traditional taxonomy may not aptly capture the nuances and differences among these advanced methodologies. In light of this issue, our survey is dedicated to bridging this gap and provides a contemporary perspective by offering a comprehensive and updated taxonomy that aligns with the era of deep learning. Through a thorough examination of deep learning-based cross-domain data fusion methods, we seek to establish a robust foundation for understanding and navigating the landscape of urban computing. Specifically, we commence by presenting a novel taxonomy that classifies existing urban data sources into five distinct types, while concurrently categorizing fusion methods into four types. This systematic classification offers valuable insights into the intricate integration of diverse modalities within urban computing. Secondly, we systematically categorize widely used datasets and outline common application scenarios for urban computing fusion models. Thirdly, inspired by the breakthrough of Large Language Models (LLMs) in financial time series  , medicine  , law , and climate  , we further summarize inspiring research that integrates LLMs into urban computing, which complements the basic taxonomy of cross-domain data fusion in urban computing. Related Surveys. Several surveys have recently explored the application of deep learning-based data fusion across various domains. Notably, Zheng  conducted a comprehensive investigation into the methodologies proposed for cross-domain big data fusion prior to 2015. Their research reveals that machine learning-based data fusion was the de-facto dominant approach in urban computing during that period, albeit with challenges in comprehending cross-modal relations. Subsequently, with the remarkable success of deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) in representation learning, Wang et al. 69 conducted an exhaustive review on the utilization of deep learning for spatio-temporal data mining, with a special focus on the fusion of multi-source spatio-temporal data. Liu et al.  further provided a summary of deep learning-based data fusion methodologies for urban big data fusion before 2020. Though these surveys shed light on the advancements in deep learning to their respective fields, they primarily concentrated on specific aspects and do not extensively cover cross-modal data fusion or the latest paradigms, including contrast-based and generation-based approaches which have gained significant popularity since 2021. In other words, none of them have provided a comprehensive and up-to-date taxonomy framework for data fusion methodologies in the context of urban computing. Furthermore, existing surveys lack a specific focus on the data and application perspectives of these DL models within the field of urban computing. For instance, Gao et al.  summarized the fusion models for spatio-temporal data based on generative adversarial networks (GAN), while Deldari et al.  concentrated on self-supervised representation learning on the fusion of multi-modal data in the general domain. Besides, there are a couple of surveys investigating the deep learning-based data fusion in specific applications (i.e., a subdomain) of urban computing, such as crowd flow prediction , intelligent transportation , and social event detection . These facts highlight the need for a new survey to serve as a guide for future endeavors in data fusion in urban computing concepts. To this end, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of deep learning-based data fusion methodologies, explicitly tailored for cross-domain data fusion in urban computing. Our intention is not only documenting the latest advancements but also illuminating available resources and practical applications, and identifying potential research directions. Table 1 succinctly summarizes the key differences between our survey and other relevant surveys in the field. Through our exploration, we seek to provide a valuable resource for researchers and stakeholders, fostering an enhanced understanding of the intricacies surrounding the integration of diverse urban data modalities via deep learning approaches. Our Contributions. Compared to previous surveys, the contributions of our survey can be summarized as follows: Comprehensive and Up-to-Date Survey. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey that systematically reviews studies on deep learning techniques for cross-domain data fusion models in urban computing. We firmly believe that the taxonomy, progress, and prospects introduced in this paper can significantly promote the development of this field. Novel and Structured Taxonomy. We present a novel taxonomy, which organizes current research efforts from three perspectives: i) data sources, which mainly include spatio-temporal, visual, and textual modalities; ii) fusion methods, consisting of feature-based, alignment-based, contrast-based, and generation-based fusion methods; iii) applications, spanning diverse domains such as urban planning, transportation, economy, public safety, society, environment, and energy. Extensive Dataset Compilation. Our survey thoroughly compiles and categorizes popular datasets in urban computing, taking into consideration their sources, temporal coverage, and spatial distribution characteristics. Additionally, we outline the prevailing common application scenarios for urban computing fusion models, examining their practical contributions and acknowledging their limitations in a series of downstream applications, respectively. Future Research Outlook. We endeavor to identify and provide detailed explanations of several promising directions for future research, covering various aspects, including data privacy protection, the establishment of open benchmarks, the diversification of applications, and the optimization of efficiency. Moreover, capitalizing on the progress of LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 03 and Sora 1) and their notable benefits in fusing multi-modal and multi-source data, we further investigate their innovative applications and propose potential approaches for urban computing.
