      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Golf Ball Detection and Tracking Based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Kalman Filter\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGolf is a popular sport that has attracted a huge number of participants and audiences. However, watching the dim, tiny, fast-moving golf balls flying around is not such a fun experience. Practicing golf in the golf driving range causes the problem to visualize the trajectory of the golf ball. In certain circumstances, the golf ball quickly flies beyond the visual sight immediately after being hit. That is why golf is one of the sports that frequently utilize video analysis during the training session. However, detecting the fast-moving tiny golf ball is very challenging and problematic, since the golf ball can fly extremely fast and quickly disappear from the camera field of view. As soon as the golf ball flies farther from the camera, it becomes smaller and smaller in the image, which increases the difficulty in detection. Another huge challenge is caused by motion blur. As we know that, if the camera’s frame rate is not high enough, a significant blur will appear in the image, making the ball hard to detect. Most of the proposed method could be classified as sensor integration method citearticle, traditional object tracking method [ref]20, and traditional computer vision approach [ref]10.\nUmek et al. [ref]32 proposed a sensor integrated golf equipment. Without changing the functionality of a golf club, two orthogonal affixed train gage (SG) sensors, a 3-axis gyroscope, and an accelerometer were used to monitor the state and actions of the golf swing. Different types of golf swings and movement in early phases of swing can be detected with strain gage sensors. By collecting the returned data, the biofeedback application could be used to help golf beginners to learn repetitive swing. For the traditional object tracking approach, Lyu et al. [ref]20 proposed a real-time high speed moving ball shape object tracking algorithm using the fusion of multiple features. In the initial step, frame difference is obtained by subtracting the two consecutive frames. The image obtained is converted to a binary image and an array of candidate objects is collected based on all the candidate contours. Then, the moments of all the contours are calculated. False candidates are eliminated by applying a multi-feature extraction method. Finally, the ROI is refined by the contour obtained in the previous step. Using the traditional computer vision approach, Woodward et al.  proposed a low-cost golf ball tracking method. The images are taken by two calibrated stereo cameras and reconstructed in 3-D space. To realize VR golf, the authors only consider recognizing the golf ball that is centimeter-wise from the camera. In the system, there are two dots, one blue and one yellow, attached to the golf club, and the golf ball is pink. The system requires an unchanged background. By subtracting the consecutive frame by the background, the golf ball could be tracked. While in reality, golf balls are a hundred meters away from the camera. The 3D reconstruction process is computationally intensive, which could not be implemented in real-time. The authors labeled the golf ball and the club with different colors, by recognizing the color feature, the club and golf ball could be detected. While, overall, none of these are efficient for real-time golf ball detection. Kim et al. [ref]10 proposed a two-stage method for ball detection from images taken by the multi-exposure camera. They first estimate the region of the ball based on a threshold calculated using Otsu’s method. Then, segment the ball through a labeling process. Classical visual object tracking algorithms all fail in tracking the golf ball since the ball is too small in the image. In our experiments, we found that feeding high-quality images directly into the detection models led to significant computational load and terrible results. Inspired by [ref]20, we propose an accurate and real-time golf ball tracking approach based on the object detection and Kalman filter . Instead of using the entire image, we make detection from small cropped image patches to increase the detection accuracy without sacrificing speed. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The main contributions of the paper include The paper proposes an effective and efficient approach for real-time detection and tracking of a small golf ball based on object detection and Kalman filter. Six CNN-based detection models have been implemented and compared in terms of detection precision and speed. A dataset with labeled golf ball images and sequences is generated to train and test the proposed approach. A short version of this paper has been accepted for publication at SMC 2020 conference . The manuscript has made substantial extensions of the conference version by adding more models, datasets, and experiments. The proposed method and the labeled dataset will be available on the author’s GitHub site: https://github.com/rucv/golf_ball.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: blur will appear in the image, making the ball hard to detect.
