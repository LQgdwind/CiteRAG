      "content": "Paper Title: Inner-approximate Reachability Computation via Zonotopic Boundary Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReachability analysis involves the computation of reachable sets, which are sets of states achieved either through trajectories originating in a given initial set (i.e., forward reachable sets) or through the identification of initial states from which a system can reach a specified target set (i.e., backward reachable sets) . This problem is fundamental and finds motivation in various applications such as formal verification, controller synthesis, and estimation of regions of attraction. As a result, it has garnered increasing attention from both industrial and academic communities, leading to the development of numerous theoretical results and computational approaches . For many systems, exact reachability analysis is shown to be undecidable , particularly in the case of nonlinear systems. Hence, approximation methods are often employed. However, in order to use these approximations as a basis for formal reasoning about the system, it is crucial that they possess certain guarantees. Specifically, it is desirable for the computed approximation to either contain or be contained by the true reachable set, resulting in what are known as outer-approximations and inner-approximations. This paper focuses on inner-approximate reachability analysis, which calculates an inner-approximation of the reachable set for systems described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The inner-approximate reachability analysis has various applications. For instance, it can be used to falsify a safety property by performing forward inner-approximate reachability analysis, which computes an inner-approximation of the forward reachable set 2. If the computed inner-approximation includes states that violate the safety property, then the safety property is not satisfied. On the other hand, it can be used to find a set of initial states that satisfy a desired property by performing backward inner-approximate reachability analysis 1. Recently, it has been applied to path-planning problems with collision avoidance . Several methods have been proposed for the inner-approximate reachability analysis, such as Taylor models [ref]8, intervals , and polynomial zonotopes . In the computation of inner-approximations, the accumulation of computational errors, known as the wrapping effect 7, becomes pronounced with the propagation of the initial set. To overcome this, a common approach is to partition the initial set into smaller subsets, enabling independent computations on each subset. However, this widely used method often results in an excessively large number of subsets, causing burdensome computation. Consequently, in [ref]35 , set-boundary reachability methods were developed based on a meticulous examination of the topological structure.\nThese methods contract a pre-computed outer-approximation by excluding the reachable set from the boundary of the initial set, resulting in an inner-approximation. Compared to the partition of the entire initial set, set-boundary methods alleviate the computational burden and enhance the tightness of results by focusing on splitting only the boundary of the initial set. Hence, the precision of extracting and refining 111If ùí´ùí´\\mathcal{P} and ùí¨ùí¨\\mathcal{Q} are partitions (or covers) of a set XùëãX, then ùí´ùí´\\mathcal{P} refines ùí¨ùí¨\\mathcal{Q} if for every U‚ààùí´ùëàùí´U\\in\\mathcal{P}, there is V‚ààùí¨ùëâùí¨V\\in\\mathcal{Q} such that U‚äÇVùëàùëâU\\subset V. the boundary of initial set significantly influences the non-conservativeness of inner-approximation aimed to compute. However, existing boundary operations have limitations that impact the precision and application of set-boundary reachability methods, either restricting the initial sets to be interval-formed  or utilizing interval sets to outer-approximate the set boundary [ref]35, which leads to an overly conservative inner-approximation and hinders the application of set-boundary reachability methods. On this concern, this paper proposes a novel set-boundary reachability method focusing on efficient extraction and refinement of the initial set‚Äôs boundary, along with flexible inner-approximation generations.\nWe adopt zonotopes as the abstract representation of states due to their remarkable advantages: the facets of a zonotope remain zonotopes and can be split into non-overlapping subsets while preserving their zonotopic nature.\nBased on the symmetric property of zonotope‚Äôs boundary, we propose an algorithm which can efficiently extract all facets of zonotopes.\nTo further refine the extracted boundary, a fundamental algorithm is developed to partition a zonotope into smaller, non-overlapping zonotopes, termed tiling algorithm. This algorithm leverages two innovative data structures, named as boundary and tiling matrices, providing a clear and efficient implementation of the partition procedure. Complexity analysis demonstrates the superior advantages of the tiling algorithm in computational complexity compared to the existing method . Finally, we contract a pre-computed outer-approximation of reachable set to obtain an inner-approximation, which is achieved by excluding the outer-approximation of the reachable set from the refined boundary of the initial set. In contrast to proportionally shrinking the shape of computed outer-approximation utilized in existing method [ref]35, we provide a more flexible strategy that allows an adaptive modification on the configuration of zonotopic outer-approximations, leading to more non-conservative inner-approximations. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: A Non-overlapping Zonotope Splitting Algorithm. We present a novel algorithm that efficiently splits a zonotope into non-overlapping subsets, while preserving their zonotopic properties. By utilizing boundary and tiling matrices, our algorithm offers a more straightforward implementation with improved computational complexity compared to existing methods. An Adaptive Contraction Strategy. We put forward an adaptive contraction strategy for computing a zonotopic inner-approximation of the reachable set. This strategy, compared to existing methods, provides a more flexible approach for the contraction of the pre-computed outer-approximations, generating less conservative inner-approximations. A Prototype Tool - BdryReach. We have developed a prototype tool named BdryReach to implement our proposed approach, which is available from https://github.com/ASAG-ISCAS/BdryReach. Numerous evaluations on various benchmarks demonstrate that BdryReach outperforms state-of-the-art tools in terms of efficiency and accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: 1.
