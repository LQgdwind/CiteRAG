      "content": "Paper Title: IRWE: Inductive Random Walk for Joint Inference of Identity and Position Network Embedding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo the best of our knowledge, existing embedding approaches can only capture one type of topology properties (i.e., node identities or positions). They cannot encode both types of properties in a unified framework and support the joint inference of the two types of embeddings. Perozzi et al. [ref]25 proposed DeepWalk that applies skip-gram to learn node embeddings from RWs on graph topology. The ability of DeepWalk to capture node positions is further discussed and validated in  [ref]10. Grover et al. [ref]15 modified the RW in DeepWalk to a biased form and introduced node2vec that can derive richer position embeddings by adjusting the trade-off between breadth- and depth-first sampling. From a probabilistic view, Cao et al.  reformulated the RW in DeepWalk to matrix factorization objectives w.r.t. all steps in RW. Moreover, Wang et al. , Ye et al. , and Chen et al.  introduced community-preserving embedding methods based on nonnegative matrix factorization, hyperbolic embedding, and graph contrastive learning, respectively. Ribeiro et al.  proposed struc2vec, a typical identity embedding method, by applying RW to an auxiliary multilayer graph constructed via a hierarchical similarity measurement based on node degrees. From a graph signal processing view, Donnat et al.  used spectral graph wavelets to develop GraphWave and theoretically proved its ability to capture node identities. To tackle the uncertainty of node embeddings, Pei et al.  introduced struc2gauss, which encodes node identities in a space formulated by Gaussian distributions, and analyzed the effectiveness of different energy functions and structural similarity measures for Gaussian embeddings. Moreover, Guo et al. 0 enhanced the capabilities of GNNs to preserve identity information by reconstructing several manually-designed statistics. Chen et al. 1 enabled the graph transformer to capture node identities by incorporating the rooted subgraph of each node. Some recent research discussed and analyzed the relation between the two types of embeddings. Zhu et al.  proposed the PhUSION framework with three steps (i.e., computation of node proximities, non-linear filtering, and dimension reduction) and demonstrated which components (e.g., proximity measurements) can be used for the identity or position embedding. Although PhUSION can reveal the similarity and difference between the two types of embeddings, it can only derive one type of embedding under each unique setting.\nRossi et al. [ref]10 proved that some typical techniques (e.g., RW and attribute aggregation) adopted by existing methods can only derive either identity or position embeddings, which validates our discussions in SectionÂ I.\nBased on the invariant theory, Srinivasan et al. 2 proved that the relation between identity and position embedding can be analogous to that of a probability distribution and its samples. They also demonstrated that transductive and inductive embedding learning is unrelated to which type of properties to be preserved. Although some conclusions in this research are consistent with our motivations regarding node identities and positions, it only considers the optimization of one type of embedding and the transformation to another type. Its inductive inference still relies on the availability of node attributes. In contrast, we focus on the joint optimization and inductive inference of the two types of embeddings without considering the effects of graph attributes.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: properties (i.e., node identities or positions). They cannot encode both types of properties in a unified framework and support the joint inference of the two types of embeddings. Perozzi et al. [ref]25 proposed DeepWalk that applies skip-gram to learn node embeddings from RWs on graph topology. The ability of DeepWalk to capture node positions is further discussed and validated in  [ref]10.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
