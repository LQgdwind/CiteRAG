      "content": "Paper Title: A Unified Framework for Contrastive Learning from a Perspective of Affinity Matrix\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFollowing the literature  [ref]5 [ref]7 2 , let 𝒳={X1,⋯,XN}𝒳subscript𝑋1⋯subscript𝑋𝑁\\mathcal{X}=\\{X_{1},\\cdots,X_{N}\\} and 𝒳′={X1′,⋯,XN′}superscript𝒳′subscriptsuperscript𝑋′1⋯subscriptsuperscript𝑋′𝑁\\mathcal{X^{\\prime}}=\\{X^{\\prime}_{1},\\cdots,X^{\\prime}_{N}\\} denote two different views of the same mini-batch of images via data augmentation. As shown in Fig. 1, through an embedding network fθ​(⋅)subscript𝑓𝜃⋅f_{\\theta}(\\cdot), which is composed of a backbone and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) based projector, we can obtain the feature matrices of the two batches of images, i.e., Z=fθ​(𝒳)∈ℝD×N𝑍subscript𝑓𝜃𝒳superscriptℝ𝐷𝑁Z=f_{\\theta}(\\mathcal{X})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D\\times N} and Z′=fθ​(𝒳′)∈ℝD×Nsuperscript𝑍′subscript𝑓𝜃superscript𝒳′superscriptℝ𝐷𝑁Z^{\\prime}=f_{\\theta}(\\mathcal{X^{\\prime}})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D\\times N}, where D𝐷D is the dimension of features, N𝑁N is the number of raw images in each mini-batch and θ𝜃\\theta denotes the parameters of the embedding network. Also, if we want to introduce the momentum encoder, one view of images can be represented as Z′=fθe​m​a​(𝒳′)∈ℝD×Nsuperscript𝑍′subscript𝑓subscript𝜃𝑒𝑚𝑎superscript𝒳′superscriptℝ𝐷𝑁Z^{\\prime}=f_{\\theta_{ema}}(\\mathcal{X^{\\prime}})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D\\times N}, where the parameters θe​m​asubscript𝜃𝑒𝑚𝑎\\theta_{ema} are updated with the exponential moving average (EMA) of the parameters of fθ​(⋅)subscript𝑓𝜃⋅f_{\\theta}(\\cdot) as well as a stop-gradient operation. SimAffinity: A simple affinity matrix based baseline. As one representative framework, SimCLR [ref]5 normally constructs all the possible negative pairs, i.e., 2​(N−1)2𝑁12(N-1) negative pairs, for each positive pair. However, incorporating such many negative pairs will significantly increase the computational overhead. Different from SimCLR, in this work, we consider the contrastive learning task from a new perspective of affinity matrix, i.e., only N−1𝑁1N-1 negatives are considered for each positive. To be specific, an affinity matrix based contrastive learning loss can be formulated as: where Z⊤​Z′∈ℝN×Nsuperscript𝑍topsuperscript𝑍′superscriptℝ𝑁𝑁Z^{\\top}Z^{\\prime}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times N} is the affinity matrix between Z𝑍Z and Z′superscript𝑍′Z^{\\prime}, both of which are generally ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-normalized along the feature dimension, Y∈ℝN×N𝑌superscriptℝ𝑁𝑁Y\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times N} denotes the pseudo labels whose each row is a one-hot vector, and ℒCEsuperscriptℒCE\\mathcal{L}^{\\text{CE}} is the cross-entropy loss function. We highlight that SimAffinity can be a representative to represent the InfoNCE loss based standard contrastive SSL methods, such as MoCo and SimCLR (further explanation can be seen in the Appendix C). More importantly, in Section 4.2, we will show that SimAffinity can significantly overcome MoCo and SimCLR with a simpler formulation by incorporating a new tailored symmetric loss. SimWhitening: A simple whitening-based baseline. Typically, if we combine Z𝑍Z with Z′superscript𝑍′Z^{\\prime} together, i.e., Z^={Z,Z′}∈ℝD×2​N^𝑍𝑍superscript𝑍′superscriptℝ𝐷2𝑁\\hat{Z}=\\{Z,Z^{\\prime}\\}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D\\times 2N}, we can obtain the mean vector 𝝁=m​e​a​n​(Z^)∈ℝD𝝁𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛^𝑍superscriptℝ𝐷\\bm{\\mu}=mean(\\hat{Z})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D} and covariance matrix Σ=(Z^−𝝁)​(Z^−𝝁)⊤∈ℝD×DΣ^𝑍𝝁superscript^𝑍𝝁topsuperscriptℝ𝐷𝐷\\Sigma=(\\hat{Z}-\\bm{\\mu})(\\hat{Z}-\\bm{\\mu})^{\\top}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D\\times D}. Suppose we are able to obtain the whitening matrix W=Σ−12∈ℝD×D𝑊superscriptΣ12superscriptℝ𝐷𝐷W=\\Sigma^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D\\times D} by eigen-decomposition, we have the whitened features Z¯=W⋅Z=Σ−12​Z¯𝑍⋅𝑊𝑍superscriptΣ12𝑍\\bar{Z}=W\\cdot Z=\\Sigma^{-\\frac{1}{2}}Z and Z′¯=W⋅Z′=Σ−12​Z′¯superscript𝑍′⋅𝑊superscript𝑍′superscriptΣ12superscript𝑍′\\bar{Z^{\\prime}}=W\\cdot Z^{\\prime}=\\Sigma^{-\\frac{1}{2}}Z^{\\prime}, where both Z𝑍Z and Z′superscript𝑍′Z^{\\prime} have been subtracted with the mean 𝝁𝝁\\bm{\\mu}. In this sense, we calculate the affinity matrix again and obtain the following loss function: As seen, the affinity matrix after whitening is essentially a bilinear similarity between Z𝑍Z and Z′superscript𝑍′Z^{\\prime} incorporating with the inverse of covariance matrix. Different from the existing whitening based SSL methods that mainly consider whitening under the non-contrastive setting, here we show that the whitening operation can be inserted into the contrastive setting with a single loss function. SimTrace: A simple trace-based baseline. Based on the above Eq. (2), we are able to obtain a non-contrastive method SimTrace by applying a trace operation on the whitened affinity matrix. That is to say, the loss function of SimTrace can be formulated as follows: where Trace​(⋅)Trace⋅\\text{Trace}(\\cdot) denotes the trace of a square matrix. That is to say, by utilizing a simple trace operation, the sum of elements on the main diagonal of the whitened affinity matrix is maximized. In another word, the sum of similarities between positive pairs is taken as the objective to maximize, which is in line with the core idea of non-contrastive SSL methods. In addition, according to the basic properties of trace (the proof is in the Appendix B), we have where Z′​Z⊤superscript𝑍′superscript𝑍topZ^{\\prime}Z^{\\top} is in fact the cross-covariance matrix between Z′superscript𝑍′Z^{\\prime} and Z𝑍Z, and Σ−1superscriptΣ1\\Sigma^{-1} here can be seen as a linear transformation matrix. In this sense, the covariance matrix is essentially implicitly considered as an objective to be optimized with the same single trace loss function. We highlight that SimTrace can typically represent the whitening based non-contrastive SSL methods, such as W-MSE , Barlow Twins  and VICReg . Notably, like these whitening based SSL methods, SimTrace can naturally avoid the collapse problem by the whitening operation with a weights-shared Siamese network, rather than requiring either asymmetric network designs or gradient stopping for achieving this purpose. On the contrary, these asymmetric designs (like training tricks), e.g., asymmetric predictor 2 [ref]7, can be flexibly integrated with SimTrace to further enhance its performance. More importantly, different from the existing methods, SimTrace does not require explicitly calculating the matrix square rooting Σ−12superscriptΣ12\\Sigma^{-\\frac{1}{2}} or explicitly performing the whitening operation (i.e., do not need to obtain the whitening matrix Σ−12superscriptΣ12\\Sigma^{-\\frac{1}{2}} by eigen-decomposition or Cholesky decomposition). We even do not use ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} normalization for SimTrace. Symmetry: A simple symmetric loss. One limitation of the instance discrimination pretext task is that two different images will be crudely taken as two different pseudo classes even though they may belong to the same semantic class. In other words, the false negative problem clearly exists and has not yet been effectively addressed in contrastive learning based SSL. To address this problem, CO2  introduces a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence based consistency regularization term to encourage the consistency between the similarities of the positive pair with respect to all the negatives. Different from CO2, benefitting from using affinity matrix as the objective, we propose a much simpler symmetric consistency regularization loss as below: where ∥⋅∥\\|\\cdot\\| denotes the Frobenius norm of matrix. That is to say, we just need to ensure the symmetry of the obtained affinity matrix, which can somewhat achieve the effect of alleviating the false negative problem in SSL. This is because, in general, we will only use the pseudo one-hot ground truth to maximize the similarity between the positive pair while minimizing the similarities between all negative pairs, including the false negative pairs. In contrast, using such a symmetry loss, the relative similarities (which are normally large) of the false negative pairs will be largely maintained to some extent (further explanation is shown in the Appendix E). Another difference with the work of CO2  is that, the two views of negatives are shuffled together in CO2, while our symmetric loss encourages the consistency between one view and another view by calculating the cross positive-negative similarity. In other words, the pair of positive and negative comes from different views, which can benefit the final performance owing to the diversity. More importantly, another advantage of the proposed symmetric loss is that it can effectively avoid the saturated gradients suffered of using KL divergence.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Following the literature  [ref]5 [ref]7 2 , let 𝒳={X1,⋯,XN}𝒳subscript𝑋1⋯subscript𝑋𝑁\\mathcal{X}=\\{X_{1},\\cdots,X_{N}\\} and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
