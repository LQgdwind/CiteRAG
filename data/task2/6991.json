      "content": "Paper Title: The Complexity of Verifying Boolean Programs as Differentially Private\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMurtagh and Vadhan 3 studied the complexity of finding the best privacy parameters for the composition of multiple differentially private mechanisms and showed it to be #​𝐏#𝐏\\mathbf{\\#P}-complete. This work, in part, led to the development of several variants of differential privacy, most of which we consider here, with better composition properties.\nBarthe et al.  showed that deciding differential privacy for probabilistic while-like programs using both finite and infinite data is undecidable, but it becomes decidable when a restriction is imposed on the way infinite data are used in while loops. However, they do not study the computational complexity of this problem.\nGaboardi et al.  showed 𝐜𝐨𝐍𝐏#​𝐏superscript𝐜𝐨𝐍𝐏#𝐏\\mathbf{coNP}^{\\mathbf{\\#P}}-completeness for the problem of deciding (ε,0)𝜀0(\\varepsilon,0)-differential privacy for probabilistic programs over finite data domains and without loops. They also studied this problem and approximate versions of it for (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-differential privacy.\nChadha et al. [ref]14 recently showed that deciding differential privacy for a class of automata that can be used to describe classical examples from the differential privacy literature can be done in linear time in the size of the automata. This class of automata includes computations over unbounded input data, such as real numbers.\nChistikov et al.   studied several complexity problems concerning differential privacy in the setting of labeled Markov chains. They showed that the threshold problem for a computable bisimilarity distance giving a sound technique to reason about differential privacy is in 𝐍𝐏𝐍𝐏\\mathbf{NP} . Further, they proved that another distance, based on total variation, which can be used to more precisely reason about differential privacy is undecidable in general, and the problem of approximating it is #​𝐏#𝐏\\mathbf{\\#P}-hard, and in 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE} . There are also other related results from the program verification and privacy literatures.\nCourcoubetis and Yannakakis [ref]17 studied the complexity of several verification problems for probabilistic programs.\nEtessami and Yannakakis  studied the complexity of several problems for recursive Markov chains. Notably, they showed that deciding almost sure termination for this computational model is 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE}-complete.\nKaminski et al.  studied the arithmetic complexity of almost sure termination for general probabilistic programs with unbounded data types.\nChadha et al.  showed 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE}-completeness for the problem of bounding quantitative information flow for boolean programs with loops and probabilistic choice. A bound on pure differential privacy entails a bound on quantitative information flow, but not the other way around, and hence their result does not directly apply in our context.\nGilbert and McMillan  studied the query complexity of verifying differential privacy programs modeled as black boxes.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: probabilistic programs over finite data domains and without loops. They also studied this problem and approximate versions of it for (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-differential privacy.\nChadha et al. [ref]14 recently showed that deciding differential privacy for a class of automata that can be used to describe classical examples from the differential privacy literature can be done in linear time\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
