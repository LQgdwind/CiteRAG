Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Large Scale Legal Text Classification Using Transformer Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn connection with the JRC-Acquis dataset, Steinberger et al.  present the “JRC EuroVoc Indexer JEX”,\nby the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission.\nThe tool categorizes documents using the EuroVoc taxonomy by employing\na profile-based ranking task; the authors report an F-score between 0.44 and 0.54 depending on the document language.\nBoella et al.  manage to apply a support vector machine approach to the problem by transforming the multi-label classification problem into a single-label problem.\nLiu et al.  present a new family of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models tailored for multi-label text classification.\nThey compare their method to a large number of existing approaches on various datasets; for the EurLex/JRC dataset however, another method\n(SLEEC), provided the best results. SLEEC (Sparse Local Embeddings for Extreme Classification) , creates\nlocal distance preserving embeddings which are able to accurately predict infrequently occurring (tail) labels.\nThe results on precision for SLEEC applied in Liu et al.  are P@1: 0.78, P@3: 0.64 and P@5: 0.52 – however, they use a\nprevious version of the JRC-Acquis dataset with only 15.4K documents. Chalkidis et al.  recently published their work on the new EURLEX57K dataset.\nThe dataset will be described in more detail (incl. dataset statistics) in the next sections.\nChalkidis et al. also provide a strong baseline for LMTC on this dataset.\nAmong the tested neural architectures operating on the full documents, they have best results with BIGRUs with label-wise attention.\nAs input representation they use either GloVe 0 embeddings trained on domain text,\nor ELMO embeddings .\nThe authors investigated using only the first zones of the (long) documents for classification, and show that\nthe title and recitals part of each document leads to almost\nthe same performance as considering the full document .\nThis helps to alleviate BERT’s limitation of having a maximum of 512 tokens as input.\nUsing only the first 512 tokens of each document as input, BERT [ref]10 archives the best performance overall.\nThe work of Chalkidis et al. is inspired by You et al.  who experimented with RNN-based methods with self attention\non five LMTC datasets (RCV1, Amazon-13K, Wiki-30K, Wiki-500K, and EUR-Lex-4K).\nSimilar work has been done in the medical domain, Mullenbach et al.  investigate\nlabel-wise attention in LMTC for medical code prediction (on the MIMIC-II and MIMIC-III datasets). In this work, we experiment with BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, XLNet,\nM-BERT and AWD-LSTM. We provide ablation studies to measure the impact of various training strategies and heuristics.\nMoreover, we provide new standardized datasets for further investigation by the research community,\nand leverage the EuroVoc term hierarchy to generate variants of the datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: performance as considering the full document .\nThis helps to alleviate BERT’s limitation of having a maximum of 512 tokens as input.\nUsing only the first 512 tokens of each document as input, BERT [ref]10 archives the best performance overall.\nThe work of Chalkidis et al. is inspired by You et al.  who experimented with RNN-based methods with self attention\non five LMTC datasets (RCV1,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
