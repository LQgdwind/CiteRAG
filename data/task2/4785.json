      "content": "Paper Title: On the Effectiveness of Hybrid Pooling in Mixup-Based Graph Learning for Language Processing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset. We conduct our study on both traditional NLP and PL tasks. For NLP, we consider User Preference-aware Fake News Detection (UPFD) [ref]55, which is a text-level binary classification problem. For PL, we consider function-level problem multi-classification task provided by Project_CodeNet [ref]56. Two popular programming languages, Java and Python, are included in our study. UPFD contains two sets of tree-structured fake and real news propagation graphs that are derived from Twitter. Given a single graph, the source news is represented by the root node, and the leaf nodes represent Twitter users who retweeted the root news. Edges reflect the 1) connection between users and the 2) connection between the user and root news that have been retweeted. Moreover, UPFD also includes 4 different node feature types. These are ➊ Profile feature, a 10-dimensional vector derived from ten user profile attributes; ➋ Spacy feature, a 300-dimensional vector encoded using spacy Word2Vec; ➌ Bert feature, a 768-dimensional vector encoded by BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers); ➍ Content feature, a 310-dimensional vector obtained by summing the Spacy and Profile features. Fake news detection is commonly approached as a binary classification task, where GNNs provide a negative or positive prediction given a graph of user preferences\nProject_CodeNet provides two datasets, JAVA250 and Python800. JAVA250 consists of 250 classification problems, and each problem has 300 Java programs. Python800 contains 800 classification problems, and each problem has 300 Python programs. In addition, we transformed the raw source code data from both datasets into a graph representation by utilizing a simplified parse tree. We follow the same process as the original paper to divide the datasets into training, validation, and test sets. Model. We build 4 different GNN architectures for each dataset. In the text classification, we follow the recommendation of [ref]55 and build Graph Convolution Network (GCN) [ref]57, Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) , Graph Attention Network (GAT) , and GraphSAGE  models. GCN is a specialized variant of a convolution neural network that is dedicated to operating graph-structured data. GAT mainly uses the attention mechanism for graph message passing. GIN is designed to generalize the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test. GraphSAGE effectively generates node embeddings for previously undiscovered data by utilizing node feature information. In program classification, we use GNN models (GCN, GCN-Virtual, GIN, and GIN-Virtual) provided by [ref]56. Especially to enhance the aggregation phase of GNNs, virtual nodes, which involve adding an artificial node to each network and connecting it in both directions to all other graph nodes, are offered. To sum up, Table2 shows the details of used datasets and models in our experiment.\n\nReference markers found: [55]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]55: Dataset.
