      "content": "Paper Title: Transformers in Action Recognition: A Review on Temporal Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConv3D + motion + RNN: In , weighted dynamic images, created from the depth and RGB videos are inputs of the framework. The framework is composed of bidirectional rank pooling, CNNs, and 3D ConvLSTM to extract complementary information from weighted dynamic images. Canonical correlation analysis is employed for feature-level fusion, and a linear SVM is used for predicting the class of action. In , a three-stream framework via 3D CNN, ConvLSTM, 2D CNN, temporal pooling, and a fully connected layer with softmax is employed to extract spatio-temporal features of RGB, depth, and optical flow modalities. In , Molchanov et al. employed 3D CNNs and RNNs in the proposed framework for hand gesture recognition using RGB, optical flow, depth, IR, and IR disparity modalities. Each modality’s class conditional probability vectors are averaged and fused to detect and classify hand gestures. motion + RNN: Dhiman et al.  proposed motion and shape temporal dynamics (STD) as action cues. They employed a framework with RGB dynamic images in motion stream and depth silhouette in STD stream for recognizing action from an unknown view. Conv3D + motion: In  and [ref]229, a spatio-temporal attention framework is presented to identify the most representative regions and frames in a video. Following this, RGB, flow, and depth features are retrieved by the ResC3D network and are fused using canonical correlation analysis. A linear SVM classiﬁer estimates the class label. Duan et al. propose a four-stream network for gesture recognition. This method uses a two-stream convolutional consensus voting network (2SCVN) for the RGB stream and optical ﬂow ﬁelds to model short and long-term video sequences. Besides, a two-stream 3D depth-saliency ConvNet (3DDSN) is employed to learn fine-grain motion and eliminate background clutter. Some approaches try to predict pose from RGB data and use it in action prediction. In , a framework is provided for hierarchical region-adaptive multi-time resolution depth motion map (RAMDMM) and multi-time resolution RGB action recognition system. The suggested approach presents a feature representation method for RGB-D data that allows multi-view and multi-temporal action recognition. Original and synthesized viewpoints are employed for multi-view human action recognition. In addition, to be invariant to changes in an action’s speed, it also employs temporal motion information by incorporating it into the depth sequences. Appearance information in terms of multi-temporal RGB data is utilized to emphasize the underlying appearance information that would otherwise be lost with depth data alone, which helps to enhance sensitivity to interactions with tiny objects. Wu et al. applied 3D CNNs with multimodal inputs to improve spatio-temporal features . This method suggests two distinct video presentations; depth residual dynamic image sequence (DRDIS) and pose estimation map sequence (PEMS). DRDIS displays spatial motion changes of an action over time which is robust under lighting conditions, texture, and color variations. PEMS is created by pose (skeletal) estimation from an RGB video and removes the background clutter. In , a gesture recognition framework called MultiD-CNN is suggested to learn spatio-temporal features from RGB-D videos. This method includes spatial and temporal information using two recognition models: 3D-CDCN and 2D-MRCN. 3D-CDCN adds the temporal dimension and makes use of 3D ResNets and ConvLSTM to concurrently learn spatio-temporal features. On the other hand, 2D-MRCN collects the motion throughout the video sequences into a motion representation and employs 2D ResNets to learn.\nConv3D + RNN: In , a two-stream network is suggested to extract spatio-temporal features which are more robust to background clutter from RGB-D videos. The framework contains 3D CNN, convolutional LSTM, spatial pyramid pooling, and a fully connected layer to provide better long-term spatio-temporal learning.\n\nReference markers found: [229]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]229: (STD) as action cues.
