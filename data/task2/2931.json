      "content": "Paper Title: Combining Recurrent, Convolutional, and Continuous-time Models with Linear State-Space Layers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor a model to be both recurrent and convolutional, one might expect it to be limited in other ways.\nIndeed, while [ref]12  also observe that certain recurrences can be replaced with a convolution, they note that it is not obvious if convolutions can be replaced by recurrences.\nMoreover, while the LSSL is a linear recurrence, popular RNN models are nonlinear sequence models with activation functions between each time step.\nWe now show that LSSLs surprisingly do not have limited expressivity. A well-known fact about state-space systems (1)+(2) is that the output y𝑦y is related to the input u𝑢u by a convolution y​(t)=∫h​(τ)​u​(t−τ)​𝑑τ𝑦𝑡ℎ𝜏𝑢𝑡𝜏differential-d𝜏y(t)=\\int h(\\tau)u(t-\\tau)d\\tau with the impulse response hℎh of the system.\nConversely, a convolutional filter hℎh that is a rational function of degree N𝑁N can be represented by a state-space model of size N𝑁N .\nThus, an arbitrary convolutional filter hℎh can be approximated by a rational function (e.g., by Padé approximants) and represented by an LSSL. In the particular case of LSSLs with HiPPO matrices (Sections 2 and 4.1), there is another intuitive interpretation of how LSSL relate to convolutions.\nConsider the special case when A𝐴A corresponds to a uniform measure (in the literature known as the LMU  or HiPPO-LegT [ref]24 matrix).\nThen for a fixed d​t𝑑𝑡dt, equation (1) is simply memorizing the input within sliding windows of 1Δ​t1Δ𝑡\\frac{1}{\\Delta t} elements,\nand equation (2) extracts features from this window.\nThus the LSSL can be interpreted as automatically learning convolution filters with a learnable kernel width. We show two results about RNNs that may be of broader interest.\nOur first result says that the ubiquitous gating mechanism of RNNs, commonly perceived as a heuristic to smooth optimization , is actually the analog of a step size or timescale Δ​tΔ𝑡\\Delta t. A (1-D) gated recurrence xt=(1−σ​(z))​xt−1+σ​(z)​utsubscript𝑥𝑡1𝜎𝑧subscript𝑥𝑡1𝜎𝑧subscript𝑢𝑡x_{t}=(1-\\sigma(z))x_{t-1}+\\sigma(z)u_{t}, where σ𝜎\\sigma is the sigmoid function and z𝑧z is an arbitrary expression,\ncan be viewed as the GBT(α=1𝛼1\\alpha=1) (i.e., backwards-Euler) discretization of a 1-D linear ODE x˙​(t)=−x​(t)+u​(t)˙𝑥𝑡𝑥𝑡𝑢𝑡\\dot{x}(t)=-x(t)+u(t). Applying a discretization requires a positive step size Δ​tΔ𝑡\\Delta t.\nThe simplest way to parameterize a positive function is via the exponential function Δ​t=exp⁡(z)Δ𝑡𝑧\\Delta t=\\exp(z) applied to any expression z𝑧z.\nSubstituting this into (3) with A=−1,B=1,α=1formulae-sequence𝐴1formulae-sequence𝐵1𝛼1A=-1,B=1,\\alpha=1\nexactly produces the gated recurrence.\n∎ While Lemma 3.1 involves approximating continuous systems using discretization, the second result is about approximating them using Picard iteration (Section 2).\nRoughly speaking, each layer of a deep linear RNN can be viewed as successive Picard iterates x0​(t),x1​(t),…subscript𝑥0𝑡subscript𝑥1𝑡…x_{0}(t),x_{1}(t),... approximating a function x​(t)𝑥𝑡x(t) defined by a non-linear ODE.\nThis shows that we do not lose modeling power by using linear instead of non-linear recurrences, and that the nonlinearity can instead be “moved” to the depth direction of deep neural networks to improve speed without sacrificing expressivity. (Infinitely) deep stacked LSSL layers of order N=1𝑁1N=1 with position-wise non-linear functions can approximate any non-linear ODE x˙​(t)=−x+f​(t,x​(t))˙𝑥𝑡𝑥𝑓𝑡𝑥𝑡\\dot{x}(t)=-x+f(t,x(t)). We note that many of the most popular and effective RNN variants\nsuch as the LSTM , GRU , QRNN , and SRU [ref]33,\ninvolve a hidden state xt∈ℝHsubscript𝑥𝑡superscriptℝ𝐻x_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H} that involves independently “gating” the H𝐻H hidden units.\nApplying Lemma 3.1, they actually also approximate an ODE of the form in Lemma 3.2.\nThus LSSLs and these popular RNN models can be seen to all approximate the same type of underlying continuous dynamics,\nby using Picard approximations in the depth direction and discretization (gates) in the time direction.\nAppendix C gives precise statements and proofs.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: For a model to be both recurrent and convolutional, one might expect it to be limited in other ways.\nIndeed, while [ref]12  also observe that certain recurrences can be replaced with a convolution, they note that it is not obvious if convolutions can be replaced by recurrences.\nMoreover, while the LSSL is a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
