      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Continuous Consistency Axiom\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDevelopment of data mining algorithms, in particular also of clustering algorithms (see Def.3), requires a considerable body of labeled data.\nThe data may be used for development of new algorithms, fine-tuning of algorithm parameters, testing of algorithm implementations, comparison of various brands of algorithms, investigating of algorithm properties like scaling in sample size, stability under perturbation and other. There exist publicly available repositories of labeled data111See e.g. https://ifcs.boku.ac.at/repository/, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php, there exist technologies for obtaining new labeled data sets like crowdsourcing , as well as extending existent small bodies of labeled data into bigger ones (semi-supervised learning)\nas well as various cluster generators  .\nNonetheless these resources may prove sparse for an extensive development and testing efforts because of risk of overfitting, risk of instability etc.\nTherefore efforts are made to provide the developers with abundant amount of training data. The development of axiomatic systems may be exploited for such purposes.\nTheoretical works on axiomatization of clustering algorithms are quite a cheap way to produce labeled data sets from existing ones.\nThese axiomatic systems (Def.2) include among others definitions of data set transformations under which some properties of the clustering algorithm will remain unchanged. The most interesting property is the partition of the data.\nThe axiomatic systems serve of course other purposes, like deepening the understanding of the concept of clusters, the group similarity, partition and the clustering algorithm itself. Various axiomatic frameworks have been proposed, e.g.\nfor unsharp partitioning by ,\nfor graph clustering by ,\nfor cost function driven algorithms by ,\nfor linkage algorithms by ,\nfor hierarchical algorithms by   ,\nfor multi-scale clustering by .\nfor settings with increasing sample sizes by ,\nfor community detection by ,\nfor pattern clustering by ,\nand for distance based clustering\n[ref]18, , see also .\nRegrettably, the natural settings for many algorithms, like k𝑘k-means, seem to have been ignored, that is (1) the embedding in the Euclidean space (Def.10), (2) partition of not only the sample but of the sample space, and (3) the behavior under continuous transformations (Def.12).\nIt would also be a useful property if the clustering would be the same under some perturbation of the data within the range of error.\nPerturbation 𝔭​(S)𝔭𝑆\\mathfrak{p}(S) is an akin concept to continuous transformation in that for some small ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0 the distance between P∈S𝑃𝑆P\\in S and 𝔭​(P)𝔭𝑃\\mathfrak{p}(P) is below ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon. \nThe importance of the perturbation robustness in clustering has been recognized years ago and was studied by   5 among others. The candidate axiomatic system for this purpose seems to be the mentioned Kleinberg’s system [ref]18, as there are no formal obstacles to apply the axioms under Euclidean continuous settings.\nAs we show, however, one of the transformations implied by Kleinberg’s axioms, the consistency axiom transformation (Property.6)\nturns out to be identity transformation in Euclidean space, if continuity is required (Def.12.)\nFurthermore, its special case of inner-consistency (Def. 8) turns out to be identity transformation in Euclidean space even without continuity requirement (Theorem 16 and Theorem 17).\nThe special case of outer-consistency (Def.9) suffers also from problems under continuous transformation (Theorem 20). The possibility to perform continuous ΓΓ\\Gamma-transformations preserving consistency is very important from the point of view of clustering algorithm testing because it is a desirable property that small perturbations of data do not produce different clusterings. In case that a consistency transform reduces to identity transform, the transformation is useless from the point of view of algorithm testing (same data set obtained). Therefore, the axiom of consistency has to be replaced.\nWe suggest to consider replacements for inner-consistency in terms of the centric consistency (Property.29) and the outer-consistency should be replaced with motion consistency (Def.39).\nBoth special types of consistency need replacements because each of them leads to contradictions, as shown in Section 4.1 We will demonstrate that we repair in this way the basic deficiency of Kleinberg, that is the self-contradiction as well as transfer the axiomatic thinking into continuous domain (Theorem 42).\nIn Section 12, we will verify the validity of our basic cluster-preserving transformations.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: algorithms by   ,\nfor multi-scale clustering by .\nfor settings with increasing sample sizes by ,\nfor community detection by ,\nfor pattern clustering by ,\nand for distance based clustering\n[ref]18, , see also .\nRegrettably, the natural settings for many algorithms, like k𝑘k-means, seem to have been ignored, that is (1) the embedding in the Euclidean space (Def.10), (2) partition of not\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
