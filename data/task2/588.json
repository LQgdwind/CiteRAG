Its stages are detailed in Algorithm 1. We first present the rationale, notations and definitions of the algorithm. Vectors are denoted by boldface and matrices by capital letters. We depict here the general case, however, in the following sections we focus on the representation of the data matrices over the real field. The data consists of N+1𝑁1N+1 snapshots in time of a flow 𝝍𝒌∈ℝMsubscript𝝍𝒌superscriptℝ𝑀\\bm{\\psi_{k}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{M}, {𝝍𝒌}k=0Nsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝝍𝒌𝑘0𝑁\\{\\bm{\\psi_{k}}\\}_{k=0}^{N}.\nWe construct two M×N𝑀𝑁M\\times N matrices as follows, A main assumption of DMD is that the data can be well represented in a lower dimensional space. To reduce the dimensionality we need to find the singular vectors that span the columns of Ψ0N−1superscriptsubscriptΨ0𝑁1\\Psi_{0}^{N-1}.  Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD) is used to find these vectors since the matrix Ψ0N−1superscriptsubscriptΨ0𝑁1\\Psi_{0}^{N-1} is not square. This decomposition is an extension of the eigenvector problem for non square matrices (for details see e.g.  Ch. I.8), and it is given by The superscript ∗ denotes the conjugate transpose. The matrix U𝑈U is an M×N𝑀𝑁M\\times N orthogonal matrix (U∗​U=IN×Nsuperscript𝑈𝑈subscript𝐼𝑁𝑁U^{*}U=I_{N\\times N}), V𝑉V is an N×N𝑁𝑁N\\times N orthogonal matrix (V∗​V=IN×Nsuperscript𝑉𝑉subscript𝐼𝑁𝑁V^{*}V=I_{N\\times N}), and ΣΣ\\Sigma is an N×N𝑁𝑁N\\times N diagonal matrix, where the entries on the diagonal are the singular values. We denote by Ursubscript𝑈𝑟U_{r} and Vrsubscript𝑉𝑟V_{r} the submatrices, containing the first r𝑟r columns of U𝑈U and V𝑉V, respectively (r≪Mmuch-less-than𝑟𝑀r\\ll M). ΣrsubscriptΣ𝑟\\Sigma_{r} is the a submatrix of ΣΣ\\Sigma, containing the r×r𝑟𝑟r\\times r left upper entries of ΣΣ\\Sigma. The dimensionality reduction of the data is obtained by setting The k𝑘kth column in the matrix X𝑋X, denoted by 𝒙𝒌subscript𝒙𝒌{\\bm{x_{k}}}, is the lower dimensional representation of the k𝑘kth snapshot, 𝝍𝒌subscript𝝍𝒌{\\bm{\\psi_{k}}}, i.e. 𝒙𝒌=Ur∗​𝝍𝒌subscript𝒙𝒌superscriptsubscript𝑈𝑟subscript𝝍𝒌{\\bm{x_{k}}}=U_{r}^{*}{\\bm{\\psi_{k}}}.\nNote that the columns of Ursubscript𝑈𝑟U_{r} are a basis of a linear space and the entries of 𝒙𝒌subscript𝒙𝒌\\bm{x_{k}} can be viewed as coordinates of the snapshot 𝝍𝒌subscript𝝍𝒌\\bm{\\psi_{k}} in that space. In the lower-dimensional space we seek a linear mapping F𝐹F from X𝑋X to Y𝑌Y that minimizes the Frobenius norm The solution of this optimization problem is given by, termed as the DMD matrix.\nThen, the k+1𝑘1k+1th sample can be expressed as We denote by ≈\\approx the linear, dimensionality-reduced approximation of the dynamical system. The linear mapping approximation, F𝐹F, minimizes the Frobenius norm of the error with respect to the first r𝑟r dominant singular vectors of the data.\nAssuming the matrix F𝐹F is full rank, we can reformulate Eq. (20) as where D𝐷D is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of F𝐹F, and the matrix W𝑊W contains the corresponding eigenvectors. We can reconstruct the dynamics projected on the lower dimensional space, e.g. the initial condition is reconstructed by 𝝍~𝟎=Ur​𝒙𝟎subscriptbold-~𝝍0subscript𝑈𝑟subscript𝒙0\\bm{\\tilde{\\psi}_{0}}=U_{r}\\bm{x_{0}}.\nMore generally, to reconstruct a snapshot at stage k𝑘k we can apply the mapping F𝐹F k𝑘k times, where the modes, {ϕ𝒊}i=1rsuperscriptsubscriptsubscriptbold-italic-ϕ𝒊𝑖1𝑟\\{\\bm{\\phi_{i}}\\}_{i=1}^{r}, and coordinates {αi}i=1rsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝛼𝑖𝑖1𝑟\\{\\alpha_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{r} are and {μi}i=1rsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝜇𝑖𝑖1𝑟\\{\\mu_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{r} are the eigenvalues of the matrix F𝐹F (the spectrum). Note that, the linear mapping from ψ~ksubscript~𝜓𝑘\\tilde{\\psi}_{k} to ψ~k+1subscript~𝜓𝑘1\\tilde{\\psi}_{k+1}, denoted by A𝐴A is give by, This mapping can be interpreted as a linear approximation of the dynamical system. The modes {ϕi}subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖\\{\\phi_{i}\\} are the right eigenvectors of the matrix A𝐴A and the corresponding eigenvalues are {μi}subscript𝜇𝑖\\{\\mu_{i}\\}.\nFor reconstruction, we define the (time-discrete) reconstruction error, E​R​RR​e​cd𝐸𝑅subscriptsuperscript𝑅𝑑𝑅𝑒𝑐ERR^{d}_{Rec}, as where 𝝍~𝒌subscriptbold-~𝝍𝒌\\bm{\\tilde{\\psi}_{k}} is defined in Eq. (22). One can expand the reconstruction, Eq. (22), to the continuous time setting. The discrete reconstruction is a sampling of a continuous exponential function, therefore, with the identity, where d​t𝑑𝑡dt is the sampling time step\nThus, in the time continuous setting, the dynamics reconstruction and the corresponding error take the form, We would like also to consider the limit case, as the step size between consecutive snapshots, d​t𝑑𝑡dt, approaches zero. In that case, the eigenvalue μ~isubscript~𝜇𝑖\\tilde{\\mu}_{i} is the limit of the quotient written above. We note that this is the classical algorithm and several variations and extensions were further proposed. It was shown in  that DMD is sensitive to noisy data . Specifically, the spectrum estimation is systematically biased in the presence of noise. This bias is not relaxed when more data is gathered . The effect of small sensor noise on DMD and on\nthe Koopman expansion was studied and characterized in . Several attempts have been made to remove this bias. Dawson et al. proposed the forward and backward dynamics to reduce the noise . Hemati et al. formulated the problem as a total least squares optimization . A variational approach was proposed in . The authors in   used Kalman filters to cope with the noise. Williams et al.  suggested to extend the basis of the sampled data snapshots, while [ref]46 uses deep learning to learn the basis dictionary of the operator. More recent approaches harness the benefits of neural networks to propose effective Koopman-based designs .\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: .
