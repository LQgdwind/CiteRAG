      "content": "Paper Title: Physically Realizable Natural-Looking Clothing Textures Evade Person Detectors via 3D Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCamouflage patterns are originally designed for concealing people in the wild and have now become typical textures of ordinary clothes. There are a few kinds of common camouflage patterns. Among them, we choose to imitate a specific type called digital camouflage patterns that consists of small rectangular pixels. As shown in  Fig. 3a, digital camouflage patterns are typically irregular in shape and consist of a limited number of colors. We noticed that the pixels of the camouflage patterns are locally\naggregated as clusters, each of which approximately covers\na polygon region. See  Fig. 3b for illustration. Inspired by the polygon generation ability of Voronoi diagram , we use a soft version of Voronoi diagram to generate the cluster regions of the\ncamouflage pixels. Polygon generation with Voronoi diagram.\nA Voronoi diagram is a partition of a plane into multiple regions . Each region is controlled by a point, consisting of all the pixels closer to the corresponding control point than to any other point (see Fig. 3c). In this way, the locations and shapes of the polygons can be parameterized by the coordinates of the control points. However, the locations and shapes of the polygons are not differentiable with respect to the coordinates of the control points if we directly apply this rule. Therefore, we define a soft version of Voronoi diagram by introducing probabilities for each pixel. Suppose the texture map only consists of several discrete colors in a color set 𝒞={ci=(Ri,Gi,Bi)|i=1,…,NC}𝒞conditional-setsubscript𝑐𝑖subscript𝑅𝑖subscript𝐺𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖𝑖1…subscript𝑁𝐶\\mathcal{C}=\\{c_{i}=(R_{i},G_{i},B_{i})|i=1,\\dots,N_{C}\\}. Then, NPsubscript𝑁𝑃N_{P} independent control points are assigned to each color, with coordinates {bi​j∈ℝ2,i=1,2,…,NC,j=1,2,…,NP}formulae-sequencesubscript𝑏𝑖𝑗superscriptℝ2formulae-sequence𝑖12…subscript𝑁𝐶𝑗12…subscript𝑁𝑃\\{b_{ij}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2},i=1,2,\\dots,N_{C},j=1,2,\\dots,N_{P}\\}. For each pixel with coordinates x𝑥x on the texture map, we assign a discrete distribution 𝒫(x)superscript𝒫𝑥\\mathcal{P}^{(x)} to describe its probability of coloring with {ci}subscript𝑐𝑖\\{c_{i}\\}: where pk(x)subscriptsuperscript𝑝𝑥𝑘p^{(x)}_{k} is the sampling probability of color cksubscript𝑐𝑘c_{k}. According to Eq. 2, the probability of a pixel x𝑥x colored by cisubscript𝑐𝑖c_{i} increases as it gets closer to a control point bi​jsubscript𝑏𝑖𝑗b_{ij}. The parameter α𝛼\\alpha is the smoothing radius of the Voronoi diagram. When α𝛼\\alpha approaches zero, the summation in Eq. 2 will be dominated by the closest control point to x𝑥x, therefore the color of x𝑥x will be deterministic, which resembles the original hard version of Voronoi diagram. In practice, we define a probability map 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} with size NC×H×Wsubscript𝑁𝐶𝐻𝑊N_{C}\\times H\\times W for all the pixels on the texture map. We further smooth the probability map 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} by a uniform smoothing kernel 𝒮=1m2​𝟙m×m𝒮1superscript𝑚2subscript1𝑚𝑚\\mathcal{S}=\\frac{1}{m^{2}}\\mathbbm{1}_{m\\times m} of size m×m𝑚𝑚m\\times m. The smoothed probability map is then computed by a convolutional operation: 𝒫′=𝒫∗𝒮.superscript𝒫′𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}=\\mathcal{P}*\\mathcal{S}. Sampling discrete colors by Gumbel softmax. Following the procedure stated above, we assign each pixel x𝑥x on the texture map to a discrete distribution 𝒫(x)superscript𝒫𝑥\\mathcal{P}^{(x)} guided by a Voronoi diagram, while each pixel should be assigned with a specific color c(x)superscript𝑐𝑥c^{(x)} in the end. However, directly sampling according to 𝒫(x)superscript𝒫𝑥\\mathcal{P}^{(x)} is not differentiable with respect to pi(x)superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑥p_{i}^{(x)}. Alternatively, using softmax function directly to blend all the colors certainly can not produce discrete colors. Therefore, we leverage the Gumbel-softmax6 1 reparameterization trick to approximate the discrete sampling process. Suppose gi∼Gumbel​(0,1)similar-tosubscript𝑔𝑖Gumbel01g_{i}\\sim\\mathrm{Gumbel}\\,(0,1) are i.i.d. random variables drawn from the standard Gumbel distribution. Given the discrete distribution 𝒫(x)superscript𝒫𝑥\\mathcal{P}^{(x)}, we can equivalently draw the color c(x)superscript𝑐𝑥c^{(x)} by cksubscript𝑐𝑘c_{k}, where The equivalency is guaranteed6 by Since the argmax operation is still non-differentiable, we instead use a softmax estimator 1 to approximate it, such that the color c(x)superscript𝑐𝑥c^{(x)} is calculated by where τ𝜏\\tau is the temperature coefficient. We have limτ→0c(x)=ck.subscript→𝜏0superscript𝑐𝑥subscript𝑐𝑘\\lim_{\\tau\\to 0}{c^{(x)}}=c_{k}.\nFinally, each pixel x𝑥x on the texture map T𝑇T will be colored with c(x)superscript𝑐𝑥c^{(x)}. In order to enlarge the optimization space, we replace the random seed gisubscript𝑔𝑖g_{i} with a variable gi′superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑖′g_{i}^{\\prime}. Since the random seed gisubscript𝑔𝑖g_{i} can be equivalently sampled by inverse transform sampling g=−log⁡(−log⁡(u))𝑔𝑢g=-\\log(-\\log(u)) with u∼Uniform​(0,1)similar-to𝑢Uniform01u\\sim\\mathrm{Uniform}\\,(0,1), we define the variable gisubscript𝑔𝑖g_{i} in Eq. 5 as where ui(fix)∼Uniform​(0,1)similar-tosuperscriptsubscript𝑢𝑖fixUniform01u_{i}^{\\mathrm{(fix)}}\\sim\\mathrm{Uniform}\\,(0,1) is fixed during the whole training process, and ui(train)superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑖trainu_{i}^{\\mathrm{(train)}} is a trainable variable clipped in range [ref]0 [ref]0 . The hyper-parameter λ∈[ref]0 𝜆01\\lambda\\in[ref]0  controls the ratio of the trainable variables. Putting together, we update the coordinates {bi​j}subscript𝑏𝑖𝑗\\{b_{ij}\\} and the trainable variable {ui(train)}superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑖train\\{u_{i}^{\\mathrm{(train)}}\\} jointly during optimization.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: is fixed during the whole training process, and ui(train)superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑖trainu_{i}^{\\mathrm{(train)}} is a trainable variable clipped in range [ref]0 [ref]0 .
