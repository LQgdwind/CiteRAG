      "content": "Paper Title: Generalization Analysis for Contrastive Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe most related work is the generalization analysis of CRL in Arora et¬†al. , where the authors developed generalization bounds for unsupervised errors in terms of Rademacher complexity of representation function classes. Based on this, they further studied the performance of linear classifiers on the learned features. In particular, they considered the mean classifier where the weight for a class label is the mean of the representation of corresponding inputs. A major result in Arora et¬†al.  is to show that the classification errors of the mean classifier can be bounded by the unsupervised errors of learned representation functions. This shows that the downstream classification task can benefit from a learned representation function with a low unsupervised error. The above work motivates several interesting theoretical study of CRL. Nozawa et¬†al. 1 studied CRL in a PAC-Bayesian setting, which aims to learn a posterior distribution of representation functions. Nozawa et¬†al. 1 derived PAC-Bayesian bounds for the posterior distribution and applied it to get PAC-Bayesian bounds for the mean-classifier, which relaxes the i.i.d. assumption. Negative examples in the framework  are typically taken to be randomly sampled datapoints, which may actually have the same label of the point of interest. This introduces a bias in the objective function of CRL, which leads to performance drops in practice. Motivated by this, Chuang et¬†al.  introduced a debiased CRL algorithm by building an approximation of unbiased error in CRL, and developed generalization guarantees for the downstream classification. Several researchers studied CRL from other perspectives. Lee et¬†al. [ref]24 proposed to learn a representation function fùëìf to minimize ùîº(X1,X2)‚Äã[‚ÄñX2‚àíf‚Äã(X1)‚Äñ22]subscriptùîºsubscriptùëã1subscriptùëã2delimited-[]superscriptsubscriptnormsubscriptùëã2ùëìsubscriptùëã122\\mathbb{E}_{(X_{1},X_{2})}[\\|X_{2}-f(X_{1})\\|_{2}^{2}], where X1,X2subscriptùëã1subscriptùëã2X_{1},X_{2} are unlabeled input and pretext target. Under an approximate conditional independency assumption, the authors showed that a linear function based on the learned representation approximates the ground true predictor on downstream problems. In a generative modeling setup, Tosh et¬†al.  proposed to learn representation functions by a landmark embedding procedure, which can reveal the underlying topic posterior information. Tosh et¬†al. [ref]40 studied CRL in a multi-view setting with two views available for each datum. Under an assumption on the redundancy between the two views, the authors showed that low-dimensional representation can achieve near optimal downstream performance with linear models.\nHaoChen et¬†al.  studied self-supervised learning from the perspective of spectral clustering based on a population augmentation graph, and proposed a spectral contrastive loss. They further developed generalization bounds for both representation learning and the downstream classification. This result is improved in a recent work by developing a guarantee to incorporate the representation function class¬†5. There are also recent work on theoretical analysis of representation learning via gradient-descent dynamics¬†[ref]24 9, mutual information¬†, alignment of representations¬†, and causality¬†. CRL is related to metric learning, for which generalization bounds have been studied in the literature¬†.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: by building an approximation of unbiased error in CRL, and developed generalization guarantees for the downstream classification.
