      "content": "Paper Title: BSSAD: Towards A Novel Bayesian State-Space Approach for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAnomaly detection in multivariate time series (MTS), also referred to as outlier or novelty detection, is the task of detecting data that deviates significantly from expected behavior. A multivariate time series consists of more than one time-dependent variable. Each variable depends not only on its past values but also has a dependency on other variables. In the medical domain or cyber-physical system, these variables could be sensors measurement like temperature, pressure, etc. Anomaly detection has applications in many domains. For example, in event detection , in the financial domain to identify fraud, in cyber-security to identify cyber-attacks, for identifying medical risks, or for fault detection in cyber-physical systems [ref]2. Detecting anomalous behavior in multivariate time series has been an active area of research for a long time  . Most of the previous works have focused on presenting multivariate time series as a collection of single time dependant variables without focusing on the dependencies between the variables , . These works have been classified as residual-based anomaly detection [ref]7. In residual-based anomaly detection, recurrent neural networks or autoencoders are usually implemented to predict future values . Then the predicted and the actual values are compared to calculate a residual error. Any error that exceeds a threshold value greater than the actual value is classified as an anomaly. Recently, there has been a focus on designing methods that consider multivariate time series as a whole by finding relationships along the temporal domain and between the features. The results from these methods have been highly promising [ref]7, . These methods have been referred to as density-based algorithms and have been able to achieve higher accuracy compared to residual-based algorithms in detecting anomalies. Density-based algorithms detect anomalies in multivariate time series data using Bayesian Theory. In Bayesian theory, the next state of a system is estimated by constructing the posterior probability density function of the data from a prior distribution. It is assumed that normal data is sampled from a posterior density function different from the one that anomalous data is sampled from. Hence, any data point that does not follow the same distribution or deviates significantly from the distribution followed by the normal data will be flagged as an anomaly. The most common state estimation techniques include Kalman filters and its variants 0, Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods 1 2. Implementing Bayesian state-space algorithms for anomaly detection in multivariate time series has significant obstacles. One obstacle is that to properly estimate the state, key knowledge about the mathematical relationship between the features (sensors) and their values along the time domain is required. Most of the previous works on state estimation have been built using physics equations 3. But that may not always be the case and definite mathematical models between the variables may not be available. Another key obstacle is that there is no information about the posterior distribution. To deal with these obstacles, we propose a novel and innovative density-based anomaly detection algorithm called Bayesian State-Space Anomaly Detection (BSSAD). Our method consists of two main modules: the neural network module (NNM) and the Bayesian state-space module (BSSM). The NNM is based on recurrent neural networks and autoencoders. The BSSM is implemented using Bayesian state-space estimation techniques of ensemble Kalman filters (EnKF) and particle filters (PF). Our method is motivated by the density-based algorithm presented in [ref]7. To develop mathematical relationships between the variables, we use a combination of recurrent neural networks, more specifically long short-term memory (LSTM) 4, and autoencoders (AE). LSTM and AE have been widely used for anomaly detection 5 6 7. The Bayesian state-space techniques estimate the posterior distribution using a Monte Carlo (MC) method. In MC methods, the posterior distribution is represented as a set of random samples from a known distribution. As the number of samples increases, the true posterior probability density function (pdf) can be estimated. Both EnKF and PF are types of MC methods. In contrast to the algorithm in [ref]7, which implemented a variant of the Kalman filter called an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) 8 9 to detect anomalies, our work implements ensemble Kalman filters (EnKF) and particle filters (PF) for constructing the posterior distribution and detecting the anomalies. UKF, EnKF, and PF can efficiently handle continuous, multivariate, and non-linear systems. PF have an added advantage of being able to handle multimodal, extremely non-Gaussian noise, and occlusions problems 0. Previous research has shown that both EnKF 3  and PF  have been shown to have better accuracy in estimating the next state when compared to UKF. Once the posterior distribution has been obtained, we calculate the Mahalanobis distance to find the distance between the current state and the predicted distribution. Any value whose distance exceeds a threshold is considered an anomaly. The contribution of our work is as follows: Formulation & Algorithm: We propose the novel Bayesian State-Space Anomaly Detection (BSSAD) 111https://github.com/BSSAD2022/BSSAD model that utilizes state-space algorithms and neural networks to detect anomalies. We implement our model using Ensemble Kalman filters (EnKF) and particle filters (PF). To the best of our knowledge, no other works have focused on using EnKF and PF for anomaly detection in multivariate times series data. Accuracy: We applied our model to multiple data sets. The results of our analysis showed that our model can achieve a F1-score. In addition, we propose to use the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) to measure the accuracy of anomaly detection as an alternative to the F1-score. MCC has been considered as a better metric than F1-score in binary classification tasks . Generality: The modular design of our model allows it to be highly flexible. Different parameters can be changed and algorithms can be easily swapped out so that our method can be applied to different data types and across multiple domains. The paper is organized as follows: In Section II we provide a review of related literature. In Section III, we provide an overview of key concepts that are necessary for building our model. In Section IV, we present our model. In Section V we present our experiments and observations and finally, in Section VI we conclude.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: example, in event detection , in the financial domain to identify fraud, in cyber-security to identify cyber-attacks, for identifying medical risks, or for fault detection in cyber-physical systems [ref]2.
