      "content": "Paper Title: Network-Aware Optimization of Distributed Learning for Fog Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFog computing introduces opportunities to pool network resources and maximize the use of idle computing/storage in completing resource-intensive activities . Offloading mechanisms improve system performance when high-bandwidth network connections are available between devices. Offloading has significantly accelerated ML tasks such as linear regression training  and neural network inference . Existing literature has also considered splitting different layers in deep neural networks between fog devices and edge/cloud servers. Specifically, [ref]32 proposed two network-dependent schemes and a min-cut problem to accelerate the training phase, while  developed an architecture to intelligently locate models on local devices or the cloud based on network reliability. Prior works on deep learning offloading in fog/edge computing generally focus on network factors, such as cost/latency, rather than model accuracy. For example,  [ref]35 maximize throughput in wireless and sensor IoT networks.  studies D2D data offloading in federated learning, but focuses on communication protocols to facilitate over-the-air parameter aggregations and dataset duplication across nodes. Our methodology considers more general ML models, optimizes tradeoffs between network cost and model accuracy, and provides novel theoretical performance bounds.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: training  and neural network inference .
