      "content": "Paper Title: Profinite trees, through monads and the \\pdflambda-calculus\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStone duality has tight links with automata theory, see  and . Profinite words naturally appear in the Reiterman theorem for pseudovarieties, as proved in  and , as sets of profinite equations determine pseudovarieties . Profinite words have also been used to understand the limitedness problem in 0 and to show the decidability of weak MSO+U over infinite trees in [ref]16. They also appear in relationship with symbolic dynamics . There is a celebrated line of research extending Stone duality to take into account monoid operations on the topological side and residuation operations on the algebraic side, see  , which inspired the introduction of profinite ŒªùúÜ\\lambda-terms in [ref]28. There is a growing connection between automata theory and ŒªùúÜ\\lambda-calculus. Salvati has defined the notion of regular language of ŒªùúÜ\\lambda-terms in 9, using semantic tools. In a more syntactic direction, Hillebrand and Kanellakis established in  a link between the regularity of a language and the ŒªùúÜ\\lambda-definability of its characteristic function. This idea is at the heart of the implicit automata program research by Nguy·ªÖn and Pradic started in 3, which shows that Hillebrand and Kanellakis‚Äô result can be adapted to get a correspondence between star-free languages and a substructural fragment of the simply typed ŒªùúÜ\\lambda-calculus, see 2. These two directions, semantic and syntactic, yield two notions of languages of ŒªùúÜ\\lambda-terms of any type which have been shown to coincide in 1. A lot of different algebras can be considered for trees, see  for a survey. In , √âsik and Weil have shown how preclones, i.e. non-symmetric operads, provide a suitable notion of algebras of trees. In , they introduce their block product and use it to give a characterization of first-order definable tree languages. In this article, we use clones as we then obtain an isomorphism theorem, and not only a bijection between the sets of constants as in the case of operads. The general approach to regular languages and profinite completions using monads began in  and was further studied in . A profinite tree was already used in , where it was defined as a Cauchy sequence of profinite trees. The link between metric completions and Stone duality is a fundamental aspect of  and was elaborated further in relation to Pervin spaces in 4. Codensity is the topic of abundant categorical literature, see e.g. in    where it provides a new point of view on already known monads. It has also been studied in relation to automata theory in a series of papers  1 . Finally, this article uses tools coming from the tradition of abstract syntax, from the seminal article  by Fiore, Plotkin, and Turi to its most recent developments for second-order algebraic theories   and higher algebraic theories .\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: of profinite equations determine pseudovarieties .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
