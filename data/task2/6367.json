      "content": "Paper Title: An Efficient and Multi-private Key Secure Aggregation for Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe concept of federated learning was first introduced by Google in 2016  to address the privacy leak for distributed data providers. The core idea of federated learning is that under the orchestration of a central server, many distributed data providers (also called ‚Äúclient‚Äù) collaborate locally to train a shared global model without uploading local training data to the data center . The most popular implementation for federated learning has been proposed based on iterative model averaging, called FedAvg 0. In FedAvg, many clients locally train the model with local data to obtain local gradient and send it to the server, and then the server aggregates (e.g., calculate the weighted average of local gradients) all received local gradients to update the global model. Afterward, many federated learning schemes  and implementations  were presented based on the FedAvg. However, recent works [ref]6  have proved that federated learning still suffered from privacy leakage. For example, [ref]6 showed that the adversary can reconstruct the training data from the transmitted local gradient. In order to improve the privacy-preservation for training data of each client, many secure aggregation schemes for federated learning have been researched   [ref]10   [ref]32 . The corresponding core idea was that each client would encrypt the local gradient before uploading, and then the server conducted the aggregation on the encrypted gradients. As a result, the server could at most get aggregated results instead of each client‚Äôs local gradient. More specifically, these secure aggregation schemes were mainly designed by two cryptographic techniques: additive homomorphic encryption (HE) technique  and (t,n)ùë°ùëõ(t,n)-threshold secret sharing technique . Unfortunately, these existing secure aggregation schemes faced many shortcomings, which greatly impeded their application in practice. For example, in the additive HE-based secure aggregation schemes   [ref]10  , all clients shared a pair of public and private keys, and encrypted local gradient with the same public key. Obviously, once a client was compromised by the adversary, this system was no longer secure. To overcome this disadvantage,   [ref]32 considered assigning different keys to different clients, which allowed each client to encrypt the local gradient with its own public key by the same additive HE algorithm. Specifically, given a system private key, these schemes adopted the (t,n)ùë°ùëõ(t,n)-threshold secret sharing technique to assign the different private keys to different clients. As long as more than tùë°t clients‚Äô encrypted gradients were aggregated, then the server can obtain the aggregated result. However, these existing HE-based schemes needed a trusted third party to complete key generation, and suffered from a huge computational cost and communication overhead, especially for the deep model with a large number of parameters. In order to improve the efficiency, many secure aggregation schemes    only adopted (t,n)ùë°ùëõ(t,n)-threshold secret sharing technique. In these schemes, each client randomly selected two secret values as private keys and generated the additive shares for these two private keys. Then, they distributed the additive shares among each other. The local gradient was masked by these additive shares for privacy preservation. Obviously, these schemes permitted at most n‚àítùëõùë°n-t dropped clients or colluded clients. Furthermore, when no more than n‚àítùëõùë°n-t dropped clients exist, then the remaining online clients should upload extra secret shares to help the server to recover aggregated gradients. Unfortunately, when the number of clients is NùëÅN, each client must store 2‚ÄãN2ùëÅ2N secret additive shares. Furthermore, for different iterations, if two secret values were selected differently, then all clients must compute the corresponding additive shares and transmit them to each other. Obviously, this operation would increase the extra interactive time and communication overhead. If two secret values were reused for different iterations, then the corresponding additive shares could be computed and transmitted in the system-initialized phase, which could save much interactive time and communication overhead. However, the adversary could obtain the difference of local gradient for two different iterations, which may leak some private information for the local training data. Besides, these secret sharing-based schemes did not consider the privacy preservation of the aggregated result. That is, any adversary (i.e., not just the server) could obtain the aggregated result once getting the transmitted data. As far as we know, designing an efficient secure aggregation scheme that supports client self-selected keys, robustness against collusion attacks, and fault tolerance robustness remains a challenge.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: local gradients) all received local gradients to update the global model.
