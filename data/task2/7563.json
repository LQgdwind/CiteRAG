The availability of high-quality audio recordings from head-worn microphones allowed us to automatically obtain labels for speaking activity via speech processing algorithms. Our task is particular in the amount of background (cocktail party) noise present and interlocutor speech present in the recordings, greater than in many speech datasets which use meeting or phone recordings  . This includes interlocutor speech from subjects close to the microphone wearer, whose words could even be understood clearly from the recordings. Our goal was to ignore both interlocutor speech and background noise, and obtain labels indicating speaking status of the microphone wearer only. We initially evaluated two VAD approaches: the pyannote.audio package   and rVAD method ). However, we found to be unsuccessful in dealing with the noise in our audio recordings. We therefore decided to use a denoising step followed by a diarization step via pyannote.audio and NVIDIA NeMo libraries respectively. The complete process to generate VAD labels is a follows: Loudness normalization (EBU R128) to normalize differences in audio energy across recordings (which could be due to microphone fit). We used ffmpeg’s loudnorm filter [ref]43. Denoising via Speechbrain’s SepFormer model  trained on the WHAM! dataset [ref]45. We ran the method using a 1-minute sliding window due to model input size limitations. This removed most of the cocktail party noise in the data, but not the voices of interlocutors. Speaker diarization via NVIDIA NeMo [ref]46, a pipeline including VAD, segmentation, speaker embeddings, and clustering. We found the method to effectively separate the wearer’s voice in its own cluster, distinguishing it from other speakers. We manually identify the microphone wearer’s cluster in the diarization outputs, with help from video recordings to identify the speaker. We transform the speech segments into a speaking status time series using their timing information.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: VAD labels is a follows: Loudness normalization (EBU R128) to normalize differences in audio energy across recordings (which could be due to microphone fit).
