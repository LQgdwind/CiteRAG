      "content": "Paper Title: Audio-Visual Glance Network for Efficient Video Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn Table¬†1, we compared AVGN with several competitive action recognition baselines¬†[ref]47       [ref]40  on multiple datasets: ActivityNet¬†, FCVID¬†, and Mini Kinetics¬†.\nWe evaluated the model based on the mAP and computational cost measured in terms of floating point operations per second (FLOPS) averaged over the entire videos during the inference stage.\nWe report the performance of AVGN in three settings: (i) AVGN with the maximum number of frames allowed for the prediction set to 14 (k=14ùëò14k=14); (ii) AVGN with TG=4subscriptùëáùê∫4T_{G}=4 and k=5ùëò5k=5 for ActivityNet and FCVID, k=3ùëò3k=3 for Mini-Kinetics; (iii) AVGN with an early exit¬†[ref]10, with the number of glances set to 2 (TG=2subscriptùëáùê∫2T_{G}=2) for cost-effective inference. We see that AVGN outperformed ListenToLook¬†, which also utilizes the audio modality in its ImgAud backbones, with an mAP gain of 3.7% on ActivityNet using less than a third of GFLOPs.\nAdditionally, AVGN performs competitively with AdaFocus variants and outperforms both in trimmed video recognition with better efficiency on Mini-Kinetics (73.1% mAP with 6.1 GFLOPs vs. 72.9% mAP with 8.6 GFLOPs on AdaFocusV3¬†). AVGN achieved 1.2% mAP gain over AdaFocusV2¬†[ref]40 while requiring 2.6 fewer GFLOPs on ActivityNet. On Mini-Kinetics, AVGN outperformed AdaFocusV2 by 2.5% accuracy with 2.6 fewer GFLOPs. Focusing only on the mAP metric, AVGN achieves the highest scores in ActivityNet and Mini-Kinetics. From the results of setting (ii) and (iii), we see the reliable performance of AVGN for low-cost inference, either by simple method of limiting the kùëòk or threshold method as [ref]10. AVGN+ also shows competitive results with significantly fewer GFLOPs than other methods. For example, it achieves comparable results with OCSampler¬† with half the GFLOPs on the FCVID dataset. It is worth noting that the slightly lower performance of AVGN on FCVID can be attributed to the fact that FCVID is a large-scale dataset that contains diverse video genres, whereas ActivityNet and Mini-Kinetics focus more on human action. Nonetheless, our experiments demonstrate that AVGN provides an efficient solution for video recognition tasks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and computational cost.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: In Table¬†1, we compared AVGN with several competitive action recognition baselines¬†[ref]47       [ref]40  on multiple datasets: ActivityNet¬†, FCVID¬†, and Mini Kinetics¬†.\nWe evaluated the model based on the mAP and computational cost measured in terms of floating point operations\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
