      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey of Machine Learning-Based Ride-Hailing Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSome collective repositioning methods leverage RL techniques.\nRide-hailing repositioning for electric vehicles is studied in  , in which the state of charge of the electric vehicles is an important factor to be considered.\nLiang et al.  develop a solution method utilizing deep RL combined with binary linear programming to obtain a regional joint planning policy for electric vehicles with their state of charge considered.\nUsing binary linear programming, each vehicle repositioning action is modeled as a binary decision variable, and its weight in the objective is obtained by the value function learned by the policy iteration method.\nSimilarly, Tang et al.  also combine RL with combinatorial optimization, in which the RL learned policy is used to advise decision making in the optimization step.\nLiang et al.  adopt temporal-difference (TD) learning to obtain action-value function.\nDifferent from [ref]125, the settings in  do not allow factorization of the joint action-value function into individual ones while guaranteeing global maximization.\nThus, they formulate two linear programming instances to collectively find the decisions for the vehicles.\nTo improve the stability of the training process in RL, Fluri et al.  propose a cascading multi-level learning model.\nIn this model, the area concerned is split in halves as the number of levels of learning increases.\nThe policy training process proceeds in a top-down manner, i.e., from less to more fine-grained area partitioning.\nThe motivation behind is that the policy trained from a coarse level can serve as guidance to the finer levels, which avoids the instability caused by directly training a policy with a large state size (w.r.t. the number of regions).\nFluri et al.  propose to leverage the Lloyd K-means algorithm [ref]135 to partition the area concerned into multiple smaller regions.\nDeng et al.  leverage the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (PPO)  to learn the joint repositioning policy for vehicles, in which the value- and policy-function are approximated by neural networks.\nShi et al.  use Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) [ref]139 to learn the grid-based multiple vehicles repositioning policy with the objective of total profits maximization.\nIn , a mean-filed multi-agent RL approach is leveraged to collectively relocate the vehicles in ride-hailing. Some other collective repositioning solutions leverage various ML techniques to predict future information of a ride-hailing system, which plays an important role in guiding the platforms to make better repositioning decisions .\nRiley et al.  leverage Vector autoregression to forecast the future demand from region to region.\nThe predicted demand and current system status are then fed into two mixed-integer programming instances to find the desired distribution of vehicles and the assignment of vehicles to regions, respectively.\nIglesias et al.  use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the future ride requests for each pair of origin and destination within a certain time period.\nThe predicted information is then used as input to their proposed mixed-integer linear programming instance, which is solved to find the optimal rebalancing actions.\nXu et al.  use two LSTM-based and Mixture Density Network (MDN)-based models to predict the distributions of origins and destinations of future requests, respectively.\nWith a prediction on the distributions, the repositioning decisions are then obtained by solving a mixed-integer programming problem with total idle driving distance minimization as the objective.\nCheng et al.  leverage a multilevel logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of ride requests occurring at different times and places.\nThe online repositioning planning decisions of drivers are obtained by leveraging a centralized multi-period stochastic optimization model with both the real-time and predicted demand considered.\nLi et al.  and Gao et al.  formulate the repositioning task as a two-stage stochastic programming problem.\nThe source of the stochasticity is the underlying uncertainty of the future demands, the probability distribution of which is obtained by kernel density estimation and a deep learning model combining the LSTM and MDN in  and , respectively.\nPouls et al.  propose a forecast-driven repositioning solution framework, the core of which is a mixed-integer programming problem with the demand predictions as inputs.\nMoreover, it is solved by an off-the-shelf solver called Gurobi .\nNote that, in practice, not all planning decisions can be successfully executed by the drivers at the end.\nXu et al.  take the first step to predict the failure possibility of repositioning tasks in the decision-making process, including situations where drivers disobey the planning or end up being unmatched for an unexpectedly long time even though they follow the repositioning planning decisions accordingly.\nIn the latter case, drivers will be compensated.\nThe failure rate of each repositioning task is predicted by XGBoost  with both driver- and environment-related features as inputs.\nThe problem of multi-vehicle collaboration optimization aiming at maximizing the platform’s profit is converted into a minimum cost flow problem, which is solved by an off-the-shelf method called GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) .\n\nReference markers found: [125]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]125: in which the RL learned policy is used to advise decision making in the optimization step.\nLiang et al.  adopt temporal-difference (TD) learning to obtain action-value function.\nDifferent from [ref]125, the settings in  do not allow factorization of the joint action-value function into individual ones while guaranteeing global maximization.\nThus, they formulate two linear programming\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
