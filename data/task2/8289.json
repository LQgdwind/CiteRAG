      "content": "Paper Title: Retentive Neural Quantum States: Efficient Ansätze for Ab Initio Quantum Chemistry\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNQS uses a classical neural network to represent the (normalized) quantum state vector |ψθ⟩∈ℂ2n\\left\\lvert\\psi_{\\theta}\\right\\rangle\\in\\mathbb{C}^{2^{n}} of an n𝑛n-qubit wavefunction. This neural network ansatz accepts standard basis indices (encoded in binary as qubit spins) as inputs, and returns the logarithm of the corresponding state vector component, This ansatz is used to evaluate the quantum expectation value of a Hamiltonian, which is a Hermitian operator H𝐻H acting on the 2nsuperscript2𝑛2^{n}-dimensional space containing |ψθ⟩delimited-|⟩subscript𝜓𝜃\\left\\lvert\\psi_{\\theta}\\right\\rangle. Like the VQE, NQS seeks to minimize the quantum expectation value in order to estimate the ground state of H𝐻H. In the context of this paper, H𝐻H is taken to be second quantized electronic Hamiltonian of an isolated molecule, comprised of the kinetic and potential energies of the joint electronic wavefunction, treating the atomic nuclei as singular classical point charges, an assumption known as the Born-Oppenheimer approximation  Here ZJsubscript𝑍𝐽Z_{J} and RJsubscript𝑅𝐽R_{J} represent the atomic number and position for atomic nucleus J𝐽J, and rjsubscript𝑟𝑗r_{j} represents the position of electron j𝑗j. Fixing a basis set of n𝑛n spin-orbitals, the second quantized Hamiltonian H𝐻H acts on a 2nsuperscript2𝑛2^{n}-dimensional state space defined by possible spin-orbital occupancies. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation, H𝐻H is further mapped to a Hamiltonian on an n𝑛n-qubit state space, amenable to NQS. More specifically, the Jordan-Wigner transformation expresses H𝐻H as a real linear combination of Pauli strings: The operators {I,X,Y,Z}𝐼𝑋𝑌𝑍\\left\\{I,X,Y,Z\\right\\} form an orthogonal set under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product, which spans the real vector space of 2×2222\\times 2 Hermitian matrices. Taking all tensor products of n𝑛n copies of them produces an analogous basis for the space of 2n×2nsuperscript2𝑛superscript2𝑛2^{n}\\times 2^{n} Hermitian matrices: the space of possible n𝑛n-qubit Hamiltonians. The scalars αisubscript𝛼𝑖\\alpha_{i} in eq. 4 derive from the Hilbert-Schmidt decomposition of H𝐻H in this basis. Although the n𝑛n-qubit Hamiltonian space is 4nsuperscript4𝑛4^{n}-dimensional, second quantization and Jordan-Wigner together guarantee that the number of terms in eq. 4 is O​(n4)𝑂superscript𝑛4O(n^{4}). These local Pauli strings correspond with fundamental quantum gates, and by applying these gates on a physically prepared trial wavefunction |ψθ⟩delimited-|⟩subscript𝜓𝜃\\left\\lvert\\psi_{\\theta}\\right\\rangle, and performing quantum measurements on the result, VQEs can generate stochastic estimates of eq. 2 0. In contrast, NQS constructs a different set of stochastic estimates, based on the following estimator, This formulation recasts eq. 2 into the expected value of lθ​(x)subscript𝑙𝜃𝑥l_{\\theta}(x), called the local energy, where x∼|ψθ​(x)|2similar-to𝑥superscriptsubscript𝜓𝜃𝑥2x\\sim\\left\\lvert\\psi_{\\theta}(x)\\right\\rvert^{2}. Thus we may approximate eq. 2 by sampling basis vectors from the probability distribution |ψθ|2superscriptsubscript𝜓𝜃2\\left\\lvert\\psi_{\\theta}\\right\\rvert^{2}, and averaging their local energies. Similarly, gradients can be estimated via a variant on the log-derivative trick [ref]20, The scalar b𝑏b in eq. 6 is a hyperparameter traditionally chosen to equal L​(θ)𝐿𝜃L(\\theta)  [ref]4 to reduce variance, but changing b𝑏b introduces no bias to the gradient estimator [ref]20. By relying on the stochastic formulations from eq. 5 and eq. 6, NQS remains computationally feasible if |ψθ⟩delimited-|⟩subscript𝜓𝜃\\left\\lvert\\psi_{\\theta}\\right\\rangle and H𝐻H satisfy two key conditions discussed in 1: H𝐻H is an efficiently computable operator: each row of H𝐻H must have, with respect to n𝑛n, polynomially many entries, with the location and value of each entry computable in polynomial time 5. |ψθ⟩delimited-|⟩subscript𝜓𝜃\\left\\lvert\\psi_{\\theta}\\right\\rangle models classically tractable (CT) states: its individual entries ⟨x|ψθ⟩inner-product𝑥subscript𝜓𝜃\\left\\langle x|\\psi_{\\theta}\\right\\rangle must be efficiently retrievable, and\nit must also be possible to efficiently sample spin configurations from x∼|ψθ|2similar-to𝑥superscriptsubscript𝜓𝜃2x\\sim\\left\\lvert\\psi_{\\theta}\\right\\rvert^{2}. Let us consider condition 1. Since Hamiltonians corresponding with electronic ground state problems contain O​(n4)𝑂superscript𝑛4O(n^{4}) Pauli strings—whose row entries are zero except for a single easily retrievable entry —it follows that they are efficiently computable. We now consider condition 2. The NQS ansatz, as defined in eq. 1, allows for easily retrievable state vector entries. Furthermore, the probabilities associated with |ψθ|2superscriptsubscript𝜓𝜃2\\left\\lvert\\psi_{\\theta}\\right\\rvert^{2} are determined by the individual entries of |ψθ⟩delimited-|⟩subscript𝜓𝜃\\left\\lvert\\psi_{\\theta}\\right\\rangle, so efficient access to these entries makes sampling, either approximate or exact, from this distribution possible. The original NQS ansatz was the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), a graphical model designed to learn probability distributions [ref]4. RBMs model unnormalized distributions and require an approximate Monte Carlo method like Metropolis-Hastings for efficient sampling. Moreover, these sampling methods involve significant computational overhead in order to generate uncorrelated samples, and therefore do not parallelize well 5. As a result, NQS development has generally moved away from RBMs toward autoregressive models that output conditional probabilities of spin configurations; these architectures generally follow the neural autoregressive quantum states structure from [ref]27. Consider an arbitrary fixed ordering of input spins (x1,…,xn)∈{0,1}nsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛superscript01𝑛(x_{1},\\dots,x_{n})\\in\\left\\{0,1\\right\\}^{n}. We may construct an autoregressive ansatz using a set of real-valued functions: one phase function ϕθ:{0,1}n→[−π,π]:subscriptitalic-ϕ𝜃→superscript01𝑛𝜋𝜋\\phi_{\\theta}:\\left\\{0,1\\right\\}^{n}\\rightarrow\\left[-\\pi,\\pi\\right] and n𝑛n modulus functions log⁡ψθt:{0,1}j→ :superscriptsubscript𝜓𝜃𝑡→superscript01𝑗01\\log\\psi_{\\theta}^{t}:\\left\\{0,1\\right\\}^{j}\\rightarrow\\left[0,1\\right] outputting a sequence of autoregressive conditional probabilities From this family of functions the actual NQS ansatz may be constructed according to Constructed from autoregressive conditional probabilities, this ansatz can only encode normalized quantum state vectors: furthermore, exact sampling from |ψθ|2superscriptsubscript𝜓𝜃2\\left\\lvert\\psi_{\\theta}\\right\\rvert^{2} may be done efficiently through qubit-by-qubit sampling of individual spins, using the conditional probabilities given by pθ1,…,pθnsuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝜃1…superscriptsubscript𝑝𝜃𝑛p_{\\theta}^{1},\\dots,p_{\\theta}^{n}. The original autoregressive NQS ansatze used recurrent architectures 1 [ref]27 to model the modulus functions {pθj}j=1nsuperscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝜃𝑗𝑗1𝑛\\{p_{\\theta}^{j}\\}_{j=1}^{n} with a single neural network, using an additional feedforward network for the phase function ϕθsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝜃\\phi_{\\theta}. Although the first autoregressive ansatz applied specifically to ab initio quantum chemistry used a family of separate networks for modulus functions , the development of autoregressive NQS ansatze has shifted back toward the original vision of encoding all moduli within a single autoregressive network, for a more efficient representation of the ansatz.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: distribution |ψθ|2superscriptsubscript𝜓𝜃2\\left\\lvert\\psi_{\\theta}\\right\\rvert^{2}, and averaging their local energies.
