      "content": "Paper Title: Cloud2Curve: Generation and Vectorization of Parametric Sketches\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe analysis of free-hand sketches using deep learning  has flourished over the past few years, with sketches now being well analysed from classification  2 and retrieval  [ref]12  perspectives.\nSketches for digital analysis have always been acquired in two primary modalities - raster (pixel grids) and vector (line segments). Raster sketches have mostly been the modality of choice for sketch recognition and retrieval  . However, generative sketch models began to advance rapidly [ref]16 after focusing on vector representations and generating sketches as sequences   of waypoints/line segments, similarly to how humans sketch. As a happy byproduct, this paradigm leads to clean and blur-free image generation as opposed to direct raster-graphic generations .\nRecent works have studied creativity in sketch generation [ref]16, learning to sketch raster photo input images , learning efficient human sketching strategies , exploiting sketch generation for photo representation learning 9, and the interaction between sketch generation and language . We present Cloud2Curve, a framework that advances the generative sketch modeling paradigm on two major axes: (i) by generating parametric sketches, i.e., a compositions of its constituent strokes as scalable parametric curves; and (ii) providing the ability to sample such sketches given point-cloud data, which is trivial to obtain either from raster-graphic or waypoint sequences.\nAltogether, our framework uniquely provides the ability to generate or deterministically vectorize scalable parametric sketches based on point clouds, as illustrated in Figure 1 and explained below. First, we note that although existing frameworks like SketchRNN [ref]16 and derivatives generate vector sketches, they do so via generation of a dense sequence of short straight line segments. Consequently, (i) the output sketches are not spatially scalable as required, e.g., for digital art applications, (ii) they struggle to generate long sketches due to the use of recurrent generators , and (iii) the generative process suffers from low interpretability compared to human sketching, where the human mental model relies more on composing sketches with smooth strokes. While there have been some initial attempts at scalable vector sketch generative models , they were limited by the need for a two step training process, and to generate parametric Bézier curves of a fixed complexity, which poorly represent the diverse kinds of strokes in human sketches. In contrast, we introduce a machinery to dynamically determine the optimal complexity of each generated curve by introducing a continuous degree parameter; and our model can further be trained end-to-end. Second, existing generative sketch frameworks require purely sequential data in order to train their sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder modules. This necessitates the usage of specially collected sequential datasets like Quick, Draw! and not general purpose raster sketch datasets. In contrast, we introduce a framework that encodes point-cloud training data and decodes a sequence of parametric curves. We achieve this through an inverse-graphics  3 approach of reconstructing training images/clouds by rendering its constituent strokes individually through a white-box Bézier decoder over several time-steps. To train this framework we compare reconstructed curves with the original segmented point cloud strokes with an Optimal Transport (OT) based objective. We show that such objectives, when coupled with appropriate regularizers, can lead to controllable abstraction of sketches. To summarize our contributions: 1) We introduce a novel formulation of Bézier curves with a continuous degree parameter that is automatically inferred for each individual stroke of a sketch. 2) We develop Cloud2Curve, a generative model capable of training and inference on point cloud data to produce spatially scalable parametric sketches. (3) We demonstrate scalable parametric curve generation from point-clouds, using Quick, Draw! and a subset of K-MNIST  datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: The analysis of free-hand sketches using deep learning  has flourished over the past few years, with sketches now being well analysed from classification  2 and retrieval  [ref]12  perspectives.\nSketches for digital analysis have always been acquired in two primary modalities - raster (pixel grids) and vector (line segments).
