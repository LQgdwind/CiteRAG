      "content": "Paper Title: IDGI: A Framework to Eliminate Explanation Noise from Integrated Gradients\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nResearch on explanations for machine learning models has garnered a significant amount of attention since the development of expert models of the 1970s [ref]15 [ref]2. Recently, with the increased use of Deep Neural Networks, several papers have focused on explaining the decisions of these black box models. One possible approach is based on Shapley values  [ref]14. The Shapley value was proposed to represent the contribution value of each player in the cooperative games to the outcome of the game. From the explanation perspective, the Shapley value based methods  computed for each feature how much it contributes to the prediction score when it’s considered alone compared to the rest of the features. The Shapley value of a feature is its true attribution value. However, calculating Shapley values is intractable when the input dimension is large. Several methods approximate the Shapley values. These include KernelSHAP , BShap , and FastShap . Another strategy for explaining models’ decisions is input perturbation. Input perturbation methods work by manipulating the input and observing its effect on the output; this process is often repeated many times to produce the general behavior of the model’s prediction on that input. For example, LIME  approximates the decision for an input by fitting a linear model around the neighborhood of the input, where the neighborhood is generated through perturbations. The similar idea of manipulating the input is utilized by RISE  and several other papers  . For deep neural networks, in addition to the above strategies, several have also focused on methods of backpropagation to assign attribution to the input values. For example, modified backpropagation based methods propagate the signal of the final prediction back to the input and assign a score for each feature in the input. Methods include Deconvnet , guided backpropagation , DeepLIFT  and LRP  . These approaches propagate the modified gradient/signal, instead of the true gradient, to the input. Using the true gradient of the prediction with respect to the input as the explanation was introduced by Simonyan et al.. Similarly, Shrikumar et al. propose using the element-wise product (gradient ⊗tensor-product\\otimes input) with input itself instead of the gradient directly. Grad-CAM utilizes gradients to produce the localization map of the important regions in the input image. A popular method, Integrated Gradients (IG), was proposed by Sundararajan et al.3; it computes the attribution for each feature to explain the decision of a differentiable model, e.g. DNNs. Its variants include Guided Integrated Gradients (GIG) and Blur Integrated Gradients (BlurIG)6. XRAI  utilizes IG to provide interpretation at the region level instead of the pixel level. SmoothGrad  and AGI  compute repeated attribution maps for a given input; however, those approaches require more computation as the single path methods (such as IG, GIG, and BlurIG) has to be repeated multiple times for a given input.\nFinally, I-GOS  and I-GOS++ find a mask that would decrease the prediction score the most when it is applied to an image; they use the output of IG in their search for the mask. Our work builds on, and is orthogonal to, the single-path IG-based methods where we reduce the noise created during the integration computation. In other words, our work can be applied to any given single-path IG-based method. Furthermore, since it works with single-path methods, it is also easy to adapt to multiple-path methods as well.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: Research on explanations for machine learning models has garnered a significant amount of attention since the development of expert models of the 1970s [ref]15 [ref]2.
