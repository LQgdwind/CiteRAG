      "content": "Paper Title: Lessons on Datasets and Paradigms in Machine Learning for Symbolic Computation: A Case Study on CAD\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo train and test supervised ML models, one needs a dataset of labelled instances to train upon. For our purpose, each instance is a set of polynomials in three variables, labelled with the best variable ordering for CAD (the one for which a CAD could be built in the least time). We build this as follows. Acquisition of sets of polynomials: We select the 5942 three-variable problems from the QF_NRA category of the SMT-LIB [ref]2, and extract the set of polynomials used from each. We acknowledge that these are all satisfiability problems and so do not represent the full application range of CAD (e.g. the more general problem of quantifier elimination). However, they do (mostly) arise from applications, making performance upon them particularly meaningful. Most problems are generated by the theorem prover MetiTarski [ref]31, but there are also examples coming from, e.g., biology  and the GeoGebra dynamic geometry tool [ref]37. CAD timings: For each set of polynomials, CylindricalAlgebraicDecomposition from Maple’s Regular Chains Library  was timed to build the CAD for all six possible variable orderings. A time limit of 30 seconds was used and for the cases in which no variable ordering finished within the limit, the process was repeated with a time limit of 60 seconds. Removal of over-complicated problems: Problems in which the construction of a CAD took more than 60 seconds for all six orderings were discarded, leaving 5599 problems. Elimination of duplicates: Each problem has associated with it six CADs (one for each ordering) and thus a vector of six CAD cell counts. When we identified two problems for whom these vectors were identical then we discarded one problem. This happened extensively in the dataset where there are many problems that differ only by a single coefficient, having little effect on the geometry/topology of the problem. After this step, only 1019 problems were left. We note that this step is the main difference between our work and : despite the latter using six times more data, they reported similar performance of the ML models trained. Aside from efficiency, this should avoid data leakage between testing and training.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: for which a CAD could be built in the least time).
