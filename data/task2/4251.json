To describe these metrics in a uniform manner, we will think of all of them as ordering data points by their difficulty, ranging from ‚Äúeasiest‚Äù to ‚Äúhardest.‚Äù When these metrics have been used for data pruning, the hardest examples are retained, while the easiest ones are pruned away. For example [ref]10 trained small ensembles (of about 101010) networks for a very short time (about 101010 epochs) and computed for every training example the average L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} norm of the error vector (EL2N score).\nData pruning by retaining only the hardest examples with largest error enabled training from scratch on only 50%percent5050\\% and 75%percent7575\\% of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 respectively without any loss in final test accuracy. However the performance of EL2N on ImageNet has not yet been explored.  noticed that over the entire course of training, some examples are learned early and never forgotten, while others can be learned and unlearned (i.e.¬†forgotten) repeatedly. They developed a forgetting score which measures the degree of forgetting of each example. Intuitively examples with low (high) forgetting scores can be thought of as easy (hard) examples.\n explored data pruning using these metrics, but not at ImageNet scale. [ref]13 defined a memorization score for each example, corresponding to how much the probability of predicting the correct label for the example increases when it is present in the training set relative to when it is absent (also see ); a large increase means the example must be memorized (i.e.¬†the remaining training data do not suffice to correctly learn this example). Additionally [ref]13 also considered an influence score that quantifies how much adding a particular example to the training set increases the probability of the correct class label of a test example.\nIntuitively, low memorization and influence scores correspond to easy examples that are redundant with the rest of the data, while high scores correspond to hard examples that must be individually learned.\n[ref]13 did not use these scores for data pruning as their computation is expensive. We note since memorization explicitly approximates the increase in test loss due to removing each individual example, it is likely to be a good pruning metric (though it does not consider interactions). Active learning iterates between training a model and selecting new inputs to be labeled   [ref]17  . In contrast, we focus on data pruning: one-shot selection of a data subset sufficient to train to high accuracy from scratch. A variety of coreset algorithms (e.g.¬†) have been proposed for this, but their computation is expensive, and so data-pruning has been less explored at scale on ImageNet. An early clustering approach  allowed training on 90%percent9090\\% of ImageNet without sacrificing accuracy. Notably  reduced this to 80%percent8080\\% by training a large ensemble of networks on ImageNet and using ensemble uncertainty to define the difficulty of each example, with low (high) uncertainty corresponding to easy (hard) examples. We will show how to achieve similar pruning performance without labels or the need to train a large ensemble.  assigned a score to every ImageNet image, given by the number of models in a diverse ensemble (10 models) that misclassified the image. Intuitively, low (high) scores correspond to easy (hard) examples. The pruning performance of this metric remains unexplored. We note: (1) only one of these metrics has tested well for its efficacy in data pruning at scale on ImageNet; (2) all of these metrics require label information; (3) there is no theory of when and why data pruning is possible for any of these metrics; and (4) none of these works suggest the possibility of exponential scaling. We thus go beyond this prior work by benchmarking the data pruning efficacy of not only these metrics but also a new unsupervised metric we introduce that does not require label information, all at scale on ImageNet. We also develop an analytic theory for data-pruning for the margin metric that predicts not only the possibility of exponential scaling but also the novel finding that retaining easy instead of hard examples is better when data is scarce.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: by their difficulty, ranging from ‚Äúeasiest‚Äù to ‚Äúhardest.‚Äù When these metrics have been used for data pruning, the hardest examples are retained, while the easiest ones are pruned away. For example [ref]10 trained small ensembles (of about 101010) networks for a very short time (about 101010 epochs) and computed for every training example the average L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} norm of the error vector\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
