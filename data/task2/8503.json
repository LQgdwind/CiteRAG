The Cosserat theory has since been adopted within position-based dynamics  and further extended with quaternions  , volume constraints [ref]21,\nand projective dynamics . Instead of evolving edge rotations, Shi et al.  proposed using a volume-like torsion energy to capture twisting effects. Curvature-based approaches were also presented to capture elastic rod dynamics with a smaller number of degrees of freedom (DOFs)  . From the various methods for simulating elastic strands, we selected DER   because it can handle general bending and twisting cases with few DOFs.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: into graphics, which was later extended to dynamical systems .
