      "content": "Paper Title: I saw, I conceived, I concluded: Progressive Concepts as Bottlenecks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHow would an experienced sonographer recognize a high-quality femur screening (femur standard plane) from thousands of ultrasound scans? Fig. 1 illustrates the standard procedure  of first seeking for specific organs to have a rough understanding of the image, and subsequently, based on the concepts from their knowledge, making a decision. This is also the most common process we follow when understanding images in our daily life - we see some objects/regions, conceive their properties according to our knowledge, and finally conclude the content of the image. Due to their superior performance, deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly entering all aspects of human decision-making. In applications associated with human safety and privacy, such as healthcare and autonomous driving, their black-box nature is associated with potentially unacceptable risk, and as a consequence, increasing efforts are directed towards the explainability of model decisions. Compared to post hoc interpretations     , which are intended to explain arbitrary black-box models, intrinsically explainable models [ref]9 4 1    , or white-box models, provide ante-hoc explanation during inference. Some methods [ref]9  9 reason in an intuitive way by considering visual prototypes or clues. These methods highlight regions of interest in the image that are semantically meaningful and understandable for humans. These visual explanations are intuitively helpful by explaining ”The model is looking at this” and ”this looks like that”, yet still containing redundant information and requiring more from the users’ prior knowledge for ”what is this”. In contrast, other methods, such as CBMs 4, aim to explain the reasoning process with human specialist-predefined concepts, such as colors and shapes of objects, which are precise and accurate for human understanding. When considering a problem with input x𝑥x and target y𝑦y, concept bottleneck models 4 predict y𝑦y from expert-annotated concept labels. Specifically, given the concepts c∈ℝd𝑐superscriptℝ𝑑c\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^{d}, concept bottleneck models learn the mapping g:x↦c:𝑔maps-to𝑥𝑐g\\colon x\\mapsto c and f:c↦y:𝑓maps-to𝑐𝑦f\\colon c\\mapsto y sequentially, jointly or independently 4. Here, d𝑑d is the dimension of the concept bottleneck. When the prediction of y𝑦y is based on human-specified concepts, the model is inherently explainable. However, recent results   suggest a potential information leakage from y𝑦y to the mapping g𝑔g during the sequential and joint training, which means these CBMs do not learn concepts in an intended manner, but rather as a proxy for target information. This leakage also undermined the intervenability of CBMs . The independent CBMs eliminate the target information leakage by learning y𝑦y from the ground truth c𝑐c. Nonetheless, saliency maps show that the independent CBMs fail to learn concepts from semantically meaningful information . This illustrates that CBMs do not really understand the meaning of given concepts - the x↦cmaps-to𝑥𝑐x\\mapsto c mapping is actually learned by a non-transparent model, which is neither intervenable nor explainable. In this paper, we reconsider concept learning in CBMs. In psychology, the concept is formally defined as the label of a set of things that have something in common . As illustrated in Fig. 1, the femur bone visualization, the expert-specified standard plane requirements, and even the category ”femur standard plane”, can be considered a progression of concepts with increasing abstraction. Here, abstraction means the level of difficulty for a non-expert to understand. To this end, the visual understanding task is a gradual abstraction process of concepts from redundant information. This is also supported by early post-hoc studies  , which reveal that shallower layers in a neural network tend to learn simpler concepts, while the higher layers prefer abstract ones. Inspired by the procedure ”seeing”, ”conceiving”, and ”concluding”, we improve CBMs by bottlenecking progressive concepts. This includes mapping from images to semantically meaningful visual concepts; abstraction from visual concepts to property concepts; and finally category prediction. The segmentation bottleneck visualizes the region of interest for the learned property concepts, which improves both the intervenability and interpretability of the model. Existing work 1  2 investigates the lack of expressivity of CBM predictors. The abstraction from property concepts to task targets can be challenging, especially when the concept is insufficient or the predictor does not have enough capacity to model a complex mapping. Learning additional concepts with e.g. self-supervision 1 fails to address the information leakage problem as trained in a joint way. The learned additional concepts also weaken the human-model communication, since they cannot easily be corrected by experts. Here, we enhance the predictor capacity by learning the interaction of the predefined concepts. Our key contributions are as follows: We propose Progressive Concept Bottleneck Models, providing both segmentation and property explanations. The property-level explanation has semantically meaningful representations in the input space. Our model allows human-model communication at different abstraction levels, which paves the way for human intervention at different knowledge levels. We expand the model capacity while keeping the explainability via learnable concept interaction. Our model outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and explainability on a challenging fetal ultrasound quality assessment task.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: are directed towards the explainability of model decisions.
