      "content": "Paper Title: MOOCRep: A Unified Pre-trained Embedding of MOOC Entities\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the development of technology, online\neducation has been growing rapidly over the past decade. It has provided a convenient system for people to learn at their own pace and facilitate the benefits of lifelong learning . The popularity of online learning has led to the growth of various learning platforms such as edX, Coursera, Udemy along with others. On the top, the Covid-19 pandemic has further accelerated this online learning revolution. However, with the ever-increasing amount of learning resources being added to these platforms, comes the burden of minimizing information overload. For the continued success, it is crucial to design a learning platform that can assist learners in locating and organizing learning materials in a highly efficient manner. To achieve this, it is required to design a system capable of understanding the relationship between different learning materials. It will lead to the development of tools to provide self-learners a well-curated learning path and create optimized curricula designs for them . A MOOC platform, as shown in figure  1, provides learners with various courses from different domains. Each course covers a series of modules and each module consists of a sequence of lectures. Each lecture is also tagged with universal Wikipedia concepts which are not bound to any course; while each concept can be tagged to multiple lectures. These lectures, courses, and concepts constitute the entities of MOOC platform and it is crucial to derive the relationships between them to improve various tasks such as, lecture recommendation  , concept path recommendation [ref]5, concept pre-requisite prediction  , and course recommendation . Multiple efforts have been put to solve these tasks. In general, the existing solutions usually design end-to-end frameworks to learn embeddings of the entities involved in the task and the objective functions are designed for minimizing task-oriented loss. However, these approaches require substantial amount of manually labeled data (e.g., concept pre-requisites), or suffer from the sparsity issue (e.g., lack of sufficiently reliable similar learners) limiting the performance of these models. To tackle these issues, we propose to utilize pre-training technique [ref]9 0 that learns representation by leveraging the abundant unlabeled data present in MOOC structure and textual content of entities (shown in figure 1). The learned representations can then be applied directly to the downstream models. Several pre-training methods have been developed in Natural Language Processing (NLP) on representation learning  1. However, they only exploit the textual content of the entities. Simply employing these methods to learn MOOC entity representation is not sufficient. For example, consider two knowledge concepts, lists and trees. The textual content of the two knowledge concepts might not be semantically similar but for a student learning the data structures, both the concepts are relevant and should be recommended together. Utilizing the rich information about the relevance relationship between the entities can benefit the model to learn effective embeddings. Additionally, some concepts on MOOC platform are advanced compared to others, for example, trees is a basic concept required to understand advanced concept, such as, binary search tree. Explicitly encoding the complexity level of a concept i.e., whether the concept is a basic or an advanced one, helps the model to incorporate the ordering relations between the concepts. In this paper, we propose MOOCRep, a method to learn effective embeddings that goes beyond capturing the textual content but also incorporates the relationships between entities.\nWe start with a pre-trained BERT model to learn embeddings of lectures and concepts using their textual content. Then, we use segment-aware transformer 2 to learn the course embedding that encodes the hierarchical structure of lectures and modules in a course shown in figure 1. Further, in order to preserve the inherent relations between MOOC entities, we design pre-training objectives to train our MOOCRep model. Our first pre-training objective captures the associated graph relationship between entities obtained from the MOOCCube dataset 3. We adopt a triplet loss 4 consisting of anchor, positive and negative samples where two entities connected by an edge in the graph are considered as positive samples. To obtain negative samples, we employ an efficient technique introduced in 5. The second pre-training objective incorporates domain-oriented knowledge about the complexity level of a concept. For this, we first heuristically compute the concept’s complexity level based on their distributional patterns in MOOCs. Next, we adopt Mean Square Error (MSE) loss to predict the complexity levels using the concept embeddings. Training the model by combining both these losses helps in preserving the relevance between entities from the graph structure as well as the sequential ordering between the concepts from their complexity levels. To evaluate our pre-trained entity embeddings, we show that the learned\nrepresentations substantially outperform the state-of-the-art models on important tasks in education domain. The two tasks we explore in this paper are concept pre-requisite prediction that can support development of concept paths for learners and next lecture recommendation to help learners find the next lecture of interest . Experimental results on these two downstream tasks show the applicability and strength of our pre-trained embeddings. To summarize, our main contributions in this paper are as follows: We are the first to introduce a method to learn generic embeddings of all MOOC entities which can be directly applied to various applications important to the education community . We develop a model that learns effective pre-trained embeddings of MOOC entities that encode their textual content along with different relationships between them. We show the improvement of pre-trained embeddings on concept pre-requisite prediction and lecture recommendation tasks. Our experiments show that our pre-trained embeddings achieve on an average 8.97%percent8.978.97\\% improvement over state-of-the-art pre-training algorithms.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: concepts constitute the entities of MOOC platform and it is crucial to derive the relationships between them to improve various tasks such as, lecture recommendation  , concept path recommendation [ref]5, concept pre-requisite prediction  , and course recommendation .
