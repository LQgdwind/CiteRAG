      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial System Variant Approximation to Quantify Process Model Generalization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProcess mining is a comparatively young research discipline that delights itself on ever-increasing popularity with applications in multiple domains such as Healthcare [ref]1, Manufacturing , Robotic Process Automation [ref]3, Human-Computer Interaction , and Simulation . Commonly, process mining techniques are leveraged to analyze a system. The system is observed during runtime and process steps are recorded sequentially. Recordings are then used to discover process models that are supposed to provide insights into the underlying system, i.e. to describe its behavior. An illustrative example is a complex manufacturing plant of a given product. Such a system usually requires machines to be filled with raw materials, components to be moved and assembled, and final products to be placed on pallets. Examples of corresponding observable process steps are conveyor start, start filling pallet, stop assembling, or stop machine. In this case, the sequences of steps are recorded and used to develop a process model that describes the behavior of the manufacturing plant. In process mining, four metrics are used to assess the quality of discovered process models: fitness, precision, simplicity, and generalization . The first three metrics have received a lot of attention in the literature over the last decade. However, generalization is a comparatively new and fairly untouched metric. Dongen et al.  describe generalization as “how well the model explains unobserved system behavior”. Similarly, Syring et al.  describe generalization as a metric that is “concerned with quantifying how well a process model generalizes to behavior that is possible in the (…) process but was never observed”. It is obvious that assessing the generalization metric is difficult since unobserved behavior is naturally unknown. Process models are used to draw conclusions about the underlying system and future behavior . Generalization, as an assessment metric, cannot be ignored in evaluating process models, because a process model that is solely evaluated on fitness, precision, and simplicity metrics might represent the observed recordings only , and hence overfits. Such a process model is inappropriate to derive conclusions about the system behavior. Recent research studies   have shown that state-of-the-art methods fail in assessing the extent to which a process model generalizes unobserved behavior. Hence, the measurement of generalization remains unsolved. This paper addresses the problem of quantifying generalization by utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [ref]11. GANs approximate data distributions from a given sample dataset. GANs have been extensively applied in the field of computer vision , and are capable of learning true underlying distributions of data [ref]11 . This paper is one of the first in applying GANs in the context of process mining by proposing and statistically testing a novel methodology to overcome the difficulty of assessing the quality metric of generalization. In particular, a Sequence Generative Adversarial Network (SGAN) is proposed to obtain a neural network that approximates the underlying system behavior. This neural network is trained on observed behavior only and is used to reveal the system's unobserved behavior. The generalization quality can then be assessed by comparing the unobserved behavior modeled by the process model with the unobserved behavior modeled by the neural network. The approach is called Adversarial System Variant Approximation (AVATAR). The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is evaluated and statistically tested in a controlled experiment utilizing 151515 systems. The paper is structured as follows. The related work is discussed in Section II. The fundamental preliminaries are provided in Section III followed by the proposed AVATAR methodology in Section IV. An experimental evaluation using 151515 ground truth systems and comprehensive result interpretations are reported in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper and provides future research directions. A notations overview and further detailed results can be found in the Appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Process mining is a comparatively young research discipline that delights itself on ever-increasing popularity with applications in multiple domains such as Healthcare [ref]1, Manufacturing , Robotic Process Automation [ref]3, Human-Computer Interaction , and Simulation .
