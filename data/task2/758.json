      "content": "Paper Title: Discovering High Utility-Occupancy Patterns from Uncertain Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the prevalence of Internet of Things (IoTs) technology, information sensing equipment (such as sensors, RFID tags, and so on) always generate massive amounts of data per second. It is essential for humans to discover hidden and useful information from this rich data. Agrawal et al.  first advocated the pioneering Apriori algorithm to level-wisely discover frequent patterns from a precise database. Unfortunately, this method traverses the database multiple times and generates a host of candidate itemsets, which leads to too much memory and consumption during execution. Han et al.  further presented the FP-growth algorithm and invented a novel tree structure, named FP-tree, with which no candidates are generated. In recent decades, a multitude of investigators have hastened to improve data mining algorithms due to only finding limited interestingness measures, for example, frequency or support. However, these are insufficient because every object or item is actually unequal in the final analysis. Other preferences, like the profit, cost, risk, and weight  3, have increasingly been studied, and they allow more valuable information to be discovered than the previous support-based mining algorithms. The utility-driven mining framework such as high-utility itemset mining (HUIM) model   is thus proposed. HUIM considers the unit utility (external utility) and quantity (internal utility) of objects or items. Based on these two factors, it is easy to calculate the utility of itemsets. If the derived utility value is greater than a defined minimum utility threshold in advance, then the itemsets can be called high-utility itemsets (HUIs). After that, Liu et al. 7 designed the two-phase model in which the main emphasis is to find the upper bound of the utility of itemsets and then trim most of the unqualified itemsets without further calculating their supersets. Other utility-based mining algorithms, such as HUP-growth , UP-growth , HUI-Miner 6, CoUPM [ref]6, ProUM , and HUSP-ULL  have also been proposed to deal with different mining tasks. Up to now, some studies of privacy-preserving utility mining also have been addressed and reviewed in prior work . First, Tang et al.  creatively proposed the concept of occupancy, which is the ratio of the number of items in the itemset to the one in the transaction, and considered it a dominant factor. Unfortunately, it could not help solve the problem of profit and utility. To address this issue, Shen et al.  blended the concepts of occupancy and utility, and then presented utility occupancy with the OCEAN algorithm, which is used to find patterns on behalf of the relative supporting transactions in the utility ratio. However, this utility-driven algorithm does not completely find the patterns that meet the requirements. Gan et al.  put forward a novel algorithm, called high utility-occupancy pattern mining (HUOPM) algorithm. It can avoid the errors in the OCEAN algorithm  and uses two novel structures to prune the search space. Finding qualified utility occupancy patterns has a wide range of applications in real life, especially in the era of rapid information development. For instance, Alipay analyzes the consumption records of consumers on various online platforms, such as Taobao and Meituan, and calculates the proportion of goods consumed in the record to obtain products that can represent the corresponding trade and thus gain consumer spending habits to recommend products to consumers based on their preferences. The algorithms mentioned above are all based on precise databases. Conversely, as a result of noisy data sources or failure of data transmission, losing some data is unavoidable and triggers uncertainty in databases . Therefore, it is difficult to apply these existing algorithms to handle uncertain database. Uapriori  was the first algorithm to discover frequent itemsets from uncertain databases. It mainly adopts a generate-and-test mechanism. However, it is relatively unsatisfactory because of memory space consumption. Subsequently, an approach without generating candidates by utilizing a UFP-tree structure was introduced 7. Utility-based mining in uncertain databases is also indispensable. For example, the upper-bound-based PHUI-UP 0 algorithm and PU-list-based PHUI-List algorithm 0 were designed to seek out potential high-utility patterns in uncertain databases. PHUI-UP adopts a hierarchical strategy and it depends on multiple scanning the database and generates a large number of candidate itemsets during the mining process. PHUI-List uses a vertical structure to store data, and the pruning strategy mentioned in this algorithm can speed up the mining process. So far, decision-makers can not find out existing algorithms for analyzing some complicated data with uncertainty and revealing high utility-occupancy patterns. To address this issue, in this paper we focus on the need for combining pattern mining, utility occupancy, and uncertain databases. Thus we introduce a novel algorithm, called High Utility-Occupancy Pattern Mining in Uncertain databases (UHUOPM for short). Three factors are involved in this algorithm, namely, frequency, probability, and utility occupancy.\nAmong them, frequency is mainly applied to distinguish the number of occurrences of the pattern, probability is the chance of appearing in the existing database, and utility occupancy is used to assess the contribution of selected patterns to the supporting transactions. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: This paper presents an efficient UHUOPM algorithm aimed at discovering potential high utility-occupancy patterns from uncertain databases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address the problem of utility-driven exploiting high utility-occupancy patterns in uncertain data. To reduce the amount of access to the database, two list structures, named probability utility occupancy list (PUO-list) and probability frequency utility table (PFU-table), are constructed. Moreover, several pruning strategies are proposed to reduce the search space. A concept called the remaining utility occupancy is adopted to calculate the overestimated upper bound of patterns since the utility occupancy does not hold the downward closure property. To evaluate the performance of the compared algorithms, subsequent experiments were conducted on both real-life and synthetic datasets. The experiments show that several pruning strategies can effectively eliminate most of the unqualified patterns and improve the performance of the designed algorithm in terms of memory consumption and runtime. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Related work is briefly introduced in Section 2. To better explain the algorithm, some preliminaries are illustrated in Section 3. In Section 4, the UHUOPM algorithm and several pruning strategies are introduced in detail. Furthermore, to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, the experiments that were conducted are described in Section 5. At last, a summary is given and future works are discussed in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: of itemsets and then trim most of the unqualified itemsets without further calculating their supersets.
