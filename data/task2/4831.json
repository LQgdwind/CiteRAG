      "content": "Paper Title: An Ensemble Teacher-Student Learning Approach with Poisson Sub-sampling to Differential Privacy Preserving Speech Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSub-sampling¬† and its extended statistical mechanism are used to maintain the data size by randomly selecting a larger subset of the actual data than those used in PATE. Recently, sub-sampling based divergence measurements¬†[ref]12  [ref]20 have been considered as a new solution to compute individual privacy budgets from each model for the final composition. One major advantage of sub-sampling-based privacy protection is that the sensitive training data is considered as ‚Äúrandom compositions‚Äù without being isolated as individual portions. Sub-sampling based DP procedures will attain a stronger privacy budget (a smaller ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon), so-called ‚Äúprivacy-amplification‚Äù in literature¬† [ref]20 [ref]12 . The amplification scale¬†[ref]12 of the privacy budget is determined by its sub-sampling ratio (Œ≥<1ùõæ1\\gamma<1), which is empirically lower bounded by a minimum number of data to train a mini-batch¬†. An example of calculating privacy-amplification with a given data set, X={x1,‚Ä¶,xN}ùëãsubscriptùë•1‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùëÅX=\\{x_{1},...,x_{N}\\}, consisting of feature vectors (xisubscriptùë•ùëñx_{i}), is by sampling a random Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma-proportion of the data as shown in Figure¬†1 (b) for query-based updates. When we apply an (Œµ,Œ¥ùúÄùõø\\varepsilon,\\delta)-DP mechanism only to a random Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma-proportion of the data, the whole computing progress satisfies a (l‚Äão‚Äãg‚Äã(1+Œ≥‚Äã(eŒµ‚àí1)),Œ≥‚ÄãŒ¥)ùëôùëúùëî1ùõæsuperscriptùëíùúÄ1ùõæùõø(log(1+\\gamma(e^{\\varepsilon}-1)),\\gamma\\delta)-DP guarantee based on Theorem 1 from Li et al.¬† (e.g., a smaller ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon means a stronger privacy protection). Existing sub-sampling techniques¬†[ref]12  apply a perturbation on the training sub-samples directly. In contrast, in this work, our perturbation aims at connecting the sub-sampling technique to train the teacher models with the DP-noisy output labels used to transfer its knowledge and DP-preserving properties to a student model. More specifically, we introduce the sub-sampling process of each batch of pair-wise speech data (e.g., utterances and sub-words predictions) based on the previous theoretical foundation (e.g., Lemma 4 in¬†[ref]12) on Poisson sub-sampled RDP¬†[ref]12.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: statistical mechanism are used to maintain the data size by randomly selecting a larger subset of the actual data than those used in PATE.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
