      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge-Aware Language Model Pretraining\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe strong effectiveness and rich generalization ability of pretrained language models (PLMs) [ref]1  [ref]3   have raised many questions about what is captured in transformer networks and why.\nRecent explorations found the pretrained language models may “rediscover” the linguistic pipeline at various transformer layers , can serve as implicit knowledge bases for relation extraction , perform soft reasoning tasks  , and conduct some language tasks reasonably in a fully unsupervised, zero-shot, fashion [ref]3 . With sufficiently large amount of parameters, i.e. several billions, and enough task-specific supervision, the pretrained language models can even directly generate answers for natural language questions, at the same accuracy with state-of-the-art reading comprehension systems, without using any context documents or knowledge graphs [ref]11. Impressive as they are, language models are still far from ready to serve as an “unsupervised multi-task learner” that learns knowledge directly from human language and generalizes to downstream language tasks [ref]3.\nThere are notable gaps of language models’ performances on downstream tasks between models with [ref]11  and without [ref]3 large amounts of task-specific fine-tuning. The language models still (de-)generate dull, factually-incorrect, or dream-like text when used in natural language generation    . These challenges often necessitate over-parameterization , grounding on external structural semantics    , or large amount of task-specific fine-tuning [ref]11, which are costly, complicated, and not always feasible for every language task. One potential limitation of these language models is their style of pretraining, e.g, auto-regressive language modeling [ref]3 or masked language modeling [ref]1, wherein transformer networks process a sequence of words and are asked to predict the next/masked words. There is no explicit guidance to the transformers that humans prefer them to capture correct, real-world information. As a result, all the knowledge captured in these pretrained language models is only signaled by patterns of co-occuring words in the input sequence that is learned implicitly during pretraining. In this paper, instead of creating bigger models or adding knowledge-specific architectures,\nwe propose to more efficiently leverage the existing parameters in the standard transformer language model, by simply making them aware of the various forms an entity can manifest itself as, and its role in the surrounding text.\nMore specifically, this knowledge-awareness is communicated via the input fed to PLMs and in the output expected from them during pretraining.\nFor input-awareness, we use an entity-name (surface form) dictionary that tokenizes word spans to their most popularly referred-to entity, e.g., as fuzzy frequency-based entity annotations 0, and serve these entity tokens as a parallel input channel along with the word tokens.\nFor output-awareness, in addition to the language modeling objective, we add an entity prediction task that guides the model to distinguish the correct entity from various negative distractions.\nThe two objectives together explicitly guide the language model to predict not only the correct words, but also the correct entity behind those words during pretraining, without changing the network architecture. By adding knowledge awareness to GPT-2 style auto-regressive language models,\nour pretrained language model, “Knowledge-Aware Language Model” (KALM), shows significantly improved handling of knowledge-sensitive tasks.\nIn the LAMA knowledge probing tasks , KALM outperforms its entity-unaware baseline, GPT-2, by about 25% across all tasks at both base and large transformer sizes. Our 24 layer KALM (Large) is even comparable with the 17 Billion parameter GPT-2 on some tasks.\nIt more accurately captures commonsense knowledge, factual semantics, and also relation semantics in these LAMA tests.\nThe knowledge signals also aid generic language understanding: we have observed better language modeling perplexity and word prediction accuracy with KALM too. The advantages in language modeling also transfer to downstream tasks. In zero-shot question answering, the exact match accuracy of the answers generated by KALM are 20%-100% better than those of an equivalent GPT-2 model. We did not use any task-specific supervision or additional gradient updates, relying solely on the unsupervised knowledge learned in KALM. We only feed in a few example question-answer pairs as templates to format how generated answers should look. Injecting rich knowledge signals leads to improvements approximately equal to those gained by doubling the transformer layers, indicating that PLMs can be trained more efficiently – growing the parameters exponentially is not the only way to improve language understanding. To better understand pretraining and the advantage of knowledge awareness, we leverage the edge probe technique  1 and dissect what is learned in the representations at various gradient step numbers throughout pretraining. We observe that the auto-regressive transformers start to learn the basis of language in the beginning of the pretraining, and gradually learns more complex semantics in the process; adding knowledge-awareness greatly accelerates learning of higher level semantics, e.g., coreferences and entity types, and helps the model perform better in those more complicated tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: The strong effectiveness and rich generalization ability of pretrained language models (PLMs) [ref]1  [ref]3   have raised many questions about what is captured in transformer networks and why.\nRecent explorations found the pretrained language models may “rediscover” the linguistic pipeline\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
