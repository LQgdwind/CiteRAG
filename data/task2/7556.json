Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: LoMOE: Localized Multi-Object Editing via Multi-Diffusion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo facilitate a comparison between various baselines on single-object edits, we employ a modified subset of the PIE-Bench 1 dataset supplemented with images from AFHQ , COCO 9, and Imagen . Overall, the benchmark consists of 300 images, covering editing types such as changing objects, adding objects, changing object content, changing object color, changing object material, changing background, and changing image style. Sample images for each edit type are shown in Fig. 10. The newly proposed multi-object editing benchmark LoMOE-Bench consists of 64 images, covering various editing types with each image featuring 2 to 7 masks, paired with corresponding text prompts. The masks for the images in LoMOE-Bench and the supplemental images in the single-object dataset are generated using SAM . In practice, the user is required to provide a bounding box around the object via a GUI interface, which then automatically saves the segmented mask. Sample images from LoMOE-Bench are depicted in Fig. 11. The images are also supplemented with various text-based annotations used by different baselines (refer Tab. 6) via a JSON file, including Target Image Prompt (TIP): A complex prompt describing the complete image after the edit. Source Mask Prompt (SMP): A simple text prompt describing the object inside the masked region of the input image. Target Mask Prompt (TMP): A simple text prompt that describes the edited object inside the masked region. Edit Instruction (EIn): Edit instruction for I-P2P [ref]5. \n\n\n\n\nMethod\nImage\nMask\n \n\n\nTIP\n\n \n\n\nSMP\n\n \n\n\nTMP\n\n \n\n\nEIn\n\n\nSDEdit  \n✓\n✗\n✓\n✗\n✗\n✗\n\nI-P2P  [ref]5\n✓\n✗\n✗\n✗\n✗\n✓\n\nDiffEdit  \n✓\n✓\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✗\n\nGLIDE  \n✓\n✓\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✗\n\nBLD  \n✓\n✓\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✗\n\nLoMOE\n✓\n✓\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✗\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: the masked region of the input image.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
