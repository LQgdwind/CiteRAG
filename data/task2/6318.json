      "content": "Paper Title: Automating Model Comparison in Factor Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe unifying view between probabilistic inference and model comparison as presented by this paper allows us to leverage the efficient message passing schemes for both tasks.\nInterestingly, this view allows for the use of belief propagation , variational message passing    and other message passing-based algorithms around the subgraph connected to the model selection variable mùëöm.\nThis insight gives rise to a novel class of model comparison algorithms, where the prior on the model selection variable is no longer constrained to be a categorical distribution, but where we now can straightforwardly introduce hierarchical and/or temporal dynamics.\nFurthermore, a consequence of the automatability of the message passing algorithms is that these model comparison algorithms can easily and efficiently be implemented, without the need of error-prone and time-consuming manual derivations. Although this paper has solely focused on message passing-based probabilistic inference, we envision interesting directions for alternative probabilistic programming packages, such as Stan , Pyro , Turing [ref]10, UltraNest , PyMC .\nCurrently only the PyMC framework allows for model comparison through their compare() function.\nHowever, often these packages allow for estimating the (log-)evidence through sampling, or for computing the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which resembles the negative VFE of (10), which gets optimized using stochastic variational inference .\nAn interesting direction of future research would be to use these estimates to construct the factor node f‚Äã(m)ùëìùëöf(m) in (14), with which novel model comparison algorithms can be designed, for example where the model selection variables becomes observation-dependent as in . The presented approach is especially convenient when the model allows for the use of scale factors [38, Ch.6], .\nIn this way we can efficiently compute the model evidence as shown in .\nThe introduced mixture node in Table¬†4.2 consecutively enables a simple model specification as illustrated in the source code of our experiments. A limitation of the scale factors is that they can only be efficiently computed when the model submits to exact inference .\nExtensions of the scale factors towards a variational setting would allow the use of the mixture node with a bigger variety of models.\nIf this limitation is resolved, then the introduced approach can be combined with more complicated models, such as for example Bayesian neural networks, whose performance is measured by the variational free energy, see e.g. [ref]53 .\nThis provides a novel solution to multi-task machine learning problems where the number of tasks is not known beforehand .\nEach Bayesian neural network can then be trained for a specific task and additional components or networks can be added if appropriate. The mixture nodes presented in this paper can also be nested on top of each other.\nAs a result, hierarchical mixture models can be realized, which can quickly increase the complexity of the nested model.\nThe question quickly arises where to stop.\nAn answer to this question is provided by Bayesian model reduction  .\nBayesian model reduction allows for the efficient computation of the model evidence when parts of the hierarchical model are pruned.\nThis approach allows for the pruning of hierarchical models in an effort to bound the complexity of the entire model.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: this paper has solely focused on message passing-based probabilistic inference, we envision interesting directions for alternative probabilistic programming packages, such as Stan , Pyro , Turing [ref]10, UltraNest , PyMC .\nCurrently only the PyMC framework allows for model comparison through their compare() function.\nHowever, often these packages allow for estimating the (log-)evidence\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
