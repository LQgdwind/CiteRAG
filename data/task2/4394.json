      "content": "Paper Title: DC-BENCH: Dataset Condensation Benchmark\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAnother dimension of evaluation is on how dataset condensation methods perform across different model architectures.\nConcretely, a neural network is required to extract statistics from the original and synthetic dataset, and the synthetic dataset is optimized by aligning the extracted information.\nTherefore, we expect the condensed dataset to perform equally well when it is used to train different architectures.\nSeveral previous works [ref]55  [ref]54 [ref]4 provide evaluations under this transfer setting; however the evaluations are mainly with on one dataset or under one IPC. Therefore the resulting conclusion might not generalize to different datasets or IPCs. To have a deeper understanding for the transferability of condensation methods, we propose a comprehensive protocol that evaluates the performance of condensed datasets under five model architectures, three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet), and three IPCs (1, 10, 50).\nThe architectures of choice are as follows: MLP:\nWe first consider a simple MLP architecture.\nThe network includes 3 fully connected layers and the width is set to 128. The number of trainable parameters is around 411K. ConvNet   :\nThis is the standard architecture used for both training and evaluating synthetic dataset in previous condensation works.\nThe default network contains three 3x3 convolution layers, each followed by 2x2 average pooling and instance normalization.\nThe hidden embedding size is set to 128. There are around 320K trainable parameters.\nFor TinyImageNet, we increase the number of layers to 4 for improved performance, as suggested in previous work [ref]54 [ref]4. ResNet18, ResNet152 :\nThey are commonly used ResNet architecture with 4/50 residual blocks respectively.\nEach block contains 2 convolution layers followed by ReLU activation and instance normalization (IN) . There are 11M/60M trainable parameters in ResNet18/ResNet152. ViT :  Vision Transformer is a new model architecture that’s completely different convolutional networks. It splits an image into fixed-size patches and applies a standard transformer  encoder on it. ViT achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks with far less computational resource. There are around 10M trainable parameters in our implementation of ViT.\nMetrics summary: Similar to real datasets, a high quality synthetic dataset should be able to be used for training models with various architectures.\n\nReference markers found: [55]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]55: is optimized by aligning the extracted information.\nTherefore, we expect the condensed dataset to perform equally well when it is used to train different architectures.\nSeveral previous works [ref]55  [ref]54 [ref]4 provide evaluations under this transfer setting; however the evaluations are mainly with on one dataset or under one IPC.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
