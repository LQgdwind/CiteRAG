      "content": "Paper Title: Model Checking Recursive Probabilistic Programs with Conditioning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur benchmark consists of nine POTLœáfsuperscriptsubscriptPOTLùúíùëì\\text{POTL}_{\\chi}^{f} formulas in Table¬†1\nand three programs described in the following.\nWe ran the experiments on a PC with a 4.5GHz AMD CPU and 64 GiB of RAM.\nTable¬†2 shows qualitative model checking results. Two properties are of general interest for probabilistic programs.\nConditioning on zero-measure events could gives rise to ill-defined queries¬†,\ni.e. queries without feasible runs not representing a valid probability distribution.\nLTL property Q.1 means that eventually no unsatisfied observation is met anymore,\nimplying that re-instantiated runs are sooner or later shrunk into feasible runs.\nHowever, a program may not satisfy it and still have only well-defined queries.\nConsider the case that it is non-ast and its queries indefinitely call each other.\nEach query has both terminating and non-terminating feasible runs,\nbut the latter ones may always hit an unsatisfied observation inside another nested query.\nTo deal with it, we verify POTLœáfsuperscriptsubscriptPOTLùúíùëì\\text{POTL}_{\\chi}^{f} formula¬†Q.2. It means that\nthe program does not contain a query such that the queried function is continuously reinstantiated by an observation,\nallowing it to nonterminate differently.111Note that the loop transformation √† la rejection sampling for observations is correct\nonly in the presence of at least one feasible run¬†,\nhence this kind of verification is preliminary to any consequent analysis. Schelling (Fig.¬†1). The original program bounds the recursion depth by a constant (see also¬†).\nConversely, we decided to use parameter p to control probabilistically whether recursing.\nHowever, we manipulated the distribution of p to make the overall program ast.\nFormula¬†Q.3 is described in the Motivating Example, where we have fixed Œª:=0.3assignùúÜ0.3\\lambda:=0.3. Tic-tac-toe¬†[ref]43.\nMulti-player games involving sequential decision-making¬†, such as tic-tac-toe, are\nanother application of recursive probabilistic programs with nested conditioning.\nPlayers seek a choice maximizing their expected reward in the future.\nTo achieve it, they need to meta-reason about the other players‚Äô beliefs and reasoning in subsequent turns,\nin reaction to the evolution of the game. In such games, we might ask what is the maximum (or minimum) amount of turns until termination\nthat the initial player can think of, in other words, the maximum (or minimum) recursion depth of the program.\nQ.4 means that there are at least two recursive calls‚Äîwhat we would expect from the initial state of Fig.¬†7,\nwhere no move can immediately terminate the game.\nWith POTLœáfsuperscriptsubscriptPOTLùúíùëì\\text{POTL}_{\\chi}^{f} we can inspect the metareasoning performed by the players:\nQ.5 excludes that a player ever thinks\nthat the other one will pick cell    in the subsequent turn. Virus.\npPDA and their subclasses are suitable formalisms for epidemiological models\nas well as general stochastic population dynamics in biology¬† .\nWe consider the recursive probabilistic program from [47, Fig.¬†1],\nmodeling the outbreak of a virus. We adapted it and added probabilistic sampling\nof whether to vaccinate against the disease,\nand conditioning on the fact that a vaccinated person transmits the infection at most once.\nThe resulting program has a higher probability of termination (i.e., virus extinction),\nbut remains non-ast. We consider the event of formula¬†Q.6,\ncorresponding to the CaRet formula of¬†[47, p.¬†3]:\na chain of infections of only young people leads to the casualty of an elder person.\nFormula¬†Q.7 means that eventually an elder person infects at least one elder person,\nbut none of the infected people passes away. Formulas¬†Q.8 and¬†Q.9 express generic inference\nquestions on Schelling and Tic-tac-toe:\nfor example, Q.9 means that player √ó\\times does not pick cell   . Discussion. The semi-algorithm is conclusive on all three programs.\nFor Virus, no past certificate is ever computed as all the non-trivial SCCs are not ast.\nOVI clearly outperforms Z3, and finds inductive upper bounds for all three programs in less than one second, whereas Z3 manages to solve only the easiest instance. While the execution times prove the qualitative model checking to be feasible,\nwe did not manage to solve the quantitative problem\nfor any experiment within the timeout (and hence we do not report it), despite using OVI.\nAs an insight, we checked without timeout the LTL formula ‚óá(ùê´ùêûùê≠‚àßùöñùöäùöíùöó()‚àßùöäùöïùöíùöåùöéùôªùöòùöå==1)\\mathop{\\Diamond}\\bigl{(}\\mathbf{ret}\\land\\mathtt{main()}\\land\\mathtt{aliceLoc}==1\\bigr{)} on Schelling.\nThe tool computes in almost eight hours the bounds [0.61034,0.61035]0.610340.61035[0.61034,0.61035].\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: we manipulated the distribution of p to make the overall program ast.\nFormula¬†Q.3 is described in the Motivating Example, where we have fixed Œª:=0.3assignùúÜ0.3\\lambda:=0.3.
