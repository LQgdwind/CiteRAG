In this section, we consider weighted (fuzzy) knowledge bases, where typicality inclusions are associated to weights,\nand develop a (semantic) closure construction to strengthen 𝒜​ℒ​𝒞𝐅​𝐓𝒜ℒsuperscript𝒞𝐅𝐓\\mathcal{ALC}^{{\\bf F}}{\\bf T} entailment,\nwhich leads to a generalization of the notion of fuzzy coherent multipreference model in [ref]24.\nThe construction is related to the definition of Kern-Isberner’s c-representations   which also include penalty points\nfor falsified conditionals.

For a penguin, flying is not plausible (inclusion (d5)subscript𝑑5(d_{5}) has negative weight -70), while being a bird and being black are plausible properties of prototypical penguins, and (d4)subscript𝑑4(d_{4}) and (d6)subscript𝑑6(d_{6}) have positive weights (100 and 50, respectively). Similar considerations can be done for concept 𝐶𝑎𝑛𝑎𝑟𝑦𝐶𝑎𝑛𝑎𝑟𝑦\\mathit{Canary}. Given Reddy who is red, has wings, has feather and flies (all with degree 1) and Opus who has wings and feather (with degree 1), is black with degree 0.8 and does not fly (𝐹𝑙𝑦I​(𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑠)=0superscript𝐹𝑙𝑦𝐼𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑠0\\mathit{Fly^{I}(opus)=0}), considering the weights of defeasible inclusions, we may expect Reddy to be more typical than Opus as a bird, but less typical than Opus as a penguin. We define the semantics of a weighted knowledge base trough a semantic closure construction, similar in spirit to Lehmann’s lexicographic closure , but more related to c-representations and, additionally, based on multiple preferences.\nThe construction allows a subset of the 𝒜​ℒ​𝒞𝐅​𝐓𝒜ℒsuperscript𝒞𝐅𝐓\\mathcal{ALC}^{{\\bf F}}{\\bf T} interpretations to be selected,\nthe interpretations whose induced preference relations <Cisubscriptsubscript𝐶𝑖<_{C_{i}}, for the distinguished concepts Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i}, faithfully represent the defeasible part of the knowledge base K𝐾K. Let 𝒯Ci={(dhi,whi)}subscript𝒯subscript𝐶𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑑𝑖ℎsubscriptsuperscript𝑤𝑖ℎ{\\cal T}_{C_{i}}=\\{(d^{i}_{h},w^{i}_{h})\\} be the set of weighted typicality inclusions dhi=𝐓​(Ci)⊑Di,hsubscriptsuperscript𝑑𝑖ℎ𝐓subscript𝐶𝑖square-image-of-or-equalssubscript𝐷𝑖ℎd^{i}_{h}={\\bf T}(C_{i})\\sqsubseteq D_{i,h} associated to the distinguished concept Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i}, and let I=⟨Δ,⋅I⟩𝐼Δsuperscript⋅𝐼I=\\langle\\Delta,\\cdot^{I}\\rangle be a fuzzy 𝒜​ℒ​𝒞𝐅​𝐓𝒜ℒsuperscript𝒞𝐅𝐓\\mathcal{ALC}^{{\\bf F}}{\\bf T} interpretation.\nIn the two-valued case, we would associate to each domain element x∈Δ𝑥Δx\\in\\Delta and each distinguished concept Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i}, a weight Wi​(x)subscript𝑊𝑖𝑥W_{i}(x) of x𝑥x wrt Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i} in I𝐼I, by summing the weights of the defeasible inclusions satisfied by x𝑥x.\nHowever, as I𝐼I is a fuzzy interpretation, we do not only distinguish between the typicality inclusions satisfied or\nfalsified by x𝑥x;\nwe also need to consider, for all inclusions 𝐓​(Ci)⊑Di,h∈𝒯Cisquare-image-of-or-equals𝐓subscript𝐶𝑖subscript𝐷𝑖ℎsubscript𝒯subscript𝐶𝑖{\\bf T}(C_{i})\\sqsubseteq D_{i,h}\\in{\\cal T}_{C_{i}},\nthe degree of membership of x𝑥x in Di,hsubscript𝐷𝑖ℎD_{i,h}.\nFurthermore, in comparing the weight of domain elements with respect to <Cisubscriptsubscript𝐶𝑖<_{C_{i}}, we give higher preference to the domain elements belonging to Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i} (with a degree\ngreater than 00), with respect to those\nnot belonging to Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i} (having membership degree 00). For each domain element x∈Δ𝑥Δx\\in\\Delta and distinguished concept Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i}, the weight Wi​(x)subscript𝑊𝑖𝑥W_{i}(x) of x𝑥x wrt Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i} in the 𝒜​ℒ​𝒞𝐅​𝐓𝒜ℒsuperscript𝒞𝐅𝐓\\mathcal{ALC}^{{\\bf F}}{\\bf T} interpretation I=⟨Δ,⋅I⟩𝐼Δsuperscript⋅𝐼I=\\langle\\Delta,\\cdot^{I}\\rangle is defined as follows: where −∞-\\infty is added at the bottom of all real values. The value of Wi​(x)subscript𝑊𝑖𝑥W_{i}(x) is −∞-\\infty when x𝑥x is not a C𝐶C-element (i.e., CiI​(x)=0superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑖𝐼𝑥0C_{i}^{I}(x)=0).\nOtherwise, CiI​(x)>0superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑖𝐼𝑥0C_{i}^{I}(x)>0 and the higher is the sum Wi​(x)subscript𝑊𝑖𝑥W_{i}(x), the more typical is the element x𝑥x relative to concept Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i}.\nHow much x𝑥x satisfies a typicality property 𝐓​(Ci)⊑Di,hsquare-image-of-or-equals𝐓subscript𝐶𝑖subscript𝐷𝑖ℎ{\\bf T}(C_{i})\\sqsubseteq D_{i,h} depends on the value of Di,hI​(x)∈ superscriptsubscript𝐷𝑖ℎ𝐼𝑥01D_{i,h}^{I}(x)\\in , which is weighted by whisuperscriptsubscript𝑤ℎ𝑖w_{h}^{i} in the sum.\nIn the two-valued case, Di,hI​(x)∈{0,1}superscriptsubscript𝐷𝑖ℎ𝐼𝑥01D_{i,h}^{I}(x)\\in\\{0,1\\}, and\nWi​(x)subscript𝑊𝑖𝑥W_{i}(x) is the sum of the weights of the typicality inclusions for C𝐶C satisfied by x𝑥x, if x𝑥x is a C𝐶C-element, and is −∞-\\infty, otherwise. Let us consider again Example 1.\nLet I𝐼I be an 𝒜​ℒ​𝒞𝐅​𝐓𝒜ℒsuperscript𝒞𝐅𝐓\\mathcal{ALC}^{{\\bf F}}{\\bf T} interpretation such that 𝐹𝑙𝑦I(𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦)=(∃ℎ𝑎𝑠_𝑊𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠.⊤)I(𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦)=(∃ℎ𝑎𝑠_𝐹𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟.⊤)I(𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦)=1\\mathit{Fly^{I}(reddy)=(\\exists has\\_Wings.\\top)^{I}(reddy)=(\\exists has\\_Feather.\\top)^{I}(reddy)=1} and\n\n𝑅𝑒𝑑I​(𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦)=1superscript𝑅𝑒𝑑𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦1\\mathit{Red^{I}(reddy)=1},\ni.e., Reddy flies, has wings and feather and is red (and 𝐵𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑘I​(𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦)superscript𝐵𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑘𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦\\mathit{Black^{I}(reddy)} =0absent0=0). Suppose further that 𝐹𝑙𝑦I​(𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑠)=0superscript𝐹𝑙𝑦𝐼𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑠0\\mathit{Fly^{I}(opus)=0} and (∃ℎ𝑎𝑠_𝑊𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠.⊤)I(𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑠)=(∃ℎ𝑎𝑠_\\mathit{(\\exists has\\_Wings.\\top)^{I}(opus)=(\\exists has\\_} 𝐹𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟.⊤)I(𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑠)=1\\mathit{Feather.\\top)^{I}(opus)=1} and 𝐵𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑘I​(𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑠)=0.8superscript𝐵𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑘𝐼𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑠0.8\\mathit{Black^{I}(opus)=0.8}, i.e., Opus does not fly, has wings and feather, and is black with degree 0.8.

We have seen in Section 3 that each fuzzy interpretation I𝐼I induces a preference relation for each concept and, in particular, it induces a preference <Cisubscriptsubscript𝐶𝑖<_{C_{i}} for each distinguished concept Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i}.\nWe further require that, if x<Ciysubscriptsubscript𝐶𝑖𝑥𝑦x<_{C_{i}}y,\nthen x𝑥x must be more typical than y𝑦y wrt Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i}, that is,\nthe weight Wi​(x)subscript𝑊𝑖𝑥W_{i}(x) of x𝑥x wrt Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i} should be higher than the weight Wi​(y)subscript𝑊𝑖𝑦W_{i}(y) of y𝑦y wrt Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i} (and x𝑥x should satisfy more properties or more plausible properties of typical Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i}-elements with respect to y𝑦y).\nThis leads to the following definition of a fuzzy multipreference model of a weighted a 𝒜​ℒ​𝒞𝐅​𝐓𝒜ℒsuperscript𝒞𝐅𝐓\\mathcal{ALC}^{{\\bf F}}{\\bf T} knowledge base. Let K=⟨𝒯f,K=\\langle{\\cal T}_{f}, 𝒯C1,…,subscript𝒯subscript𝐶1…{\\cal T}_{C_{1}},\\ldots, 𝒯Ck,𝒜f⟩{\\cal T}_{C_{k}},{\\cal A}_{f}\\rangle be a weighted 𝒜​ℒ​𝒞𝐅​𝐓𝒜ℒsuperscript𝒞𝐅𝐓\\mathcal{ALC}^{{\\bf F}}{\\bf T} knowledge base over 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C}. A faithful (fuzzy) multipreference model (fm-model) of K𝐾K is a fuzzy 𝒜​ℒ​𝒞𝐅​𝐓𝒜ℒsuperscript𝒞𝐅𝐓\\mathcal{ALC}^{{\\bf F}}{\\bf T} interpretation I=⟨Δ,⋅I⟩𝐼Δsuperscript⋅𝐼I=\\langle\\Delta,\\cdot^{I}\\rangle\ns.t.: I𝐼I satisfies the fuzzy inclusions in 𝒯fsubscript𝒯𝑓{\\cal T}_{f} and the fuzzy assertions in 𝒜fsubscript𝒜𝑓{\\cal A}_{f}; for all Ci∈𝒞subscript𝐶𝑖𝒞C_{i}\\in{\\cal C}, the preference <Cisubscriptsubscript𝐶𝑖<_{C_{i}} is faithful to 𝒯Cisubscript𝒯subscript𝐶𝑖{\\cal T}_{C_{i}}, that is: Let us consider again Example 2. Referring to Example 2 above,\nwhere 𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑I​(𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦)=1superscript𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦1\\mathit{Bird^{I}(reddy)=1}, 𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑I​(𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑠)superscript𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑𝐼𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑠\\mathit{Bird^{I}(opus)} =0.8absent0.8=0.8, let us further assume that 𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑛I​(𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦)=0.2superscript𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑛𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦0.2\\mathit{Penguin^{I}(reddy)=0.2} and 𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑛I​(𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑠)=0.8superscript𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑛𝐼𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑠0.8\\mathit{Penguin^{I}(opus)=0.8}.\nClearly, r​e​d​d​y<B​i​r​do​p​u​ssubscript𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑠reddy<_{Bird}opus and o​p​u​s<P​e​n​g​u​i​nr​e​d​d​ysubscript𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑠𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦opus<_{Penguin}reddy. For the interpretation I𝐼I to be faithful, it is necessary that the conditions W𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑​(𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦)>W𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑​(𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑠)subscript𝑊𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦subscript𝑊𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑠\\mathit{W_{Bird}(reddy)>W_{Bird}(opus)} and W𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑛subscript𝑊𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑛\\mathit{W_{Penguin}} (𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑠)>𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑠absent\\mathit{(opus)>} W𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑛​(𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦)subscript𝑊𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑛𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦\\mathit{W_{Penguin}(reddy)} hold; which is true, as seen in Example 2.\nOn the contrary, if it were 𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑛I​(𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦)=0.9superscript𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑛𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦0.9\\mathit{Penguin^{I}(reddy)=0.9}, the interpretation I𝐼I would not be faithful. Notice that, requiring that the converse of condition (9) also holds, gives the equivalence\nx<Ciysubscriptsubscript𝐶𝑖𝑥𝑦x<_{C_{i}}y iff Wi​(x)>Wi​(y)subscript𝑊𝑖𝑥subscript𝑊𝑖𝑦W_{i}(x)>W_{i}(y),\na stronger condition which would make the notion of faithful multipreference model of K𝐾K above coincide with the notion of coherent fuzzy multipreference model of K𝐾K introduced in [ref]24.\nHere, we have considered the weaker notion of faithfulness and a larger class of fuzzy multipreference models of a weighted knowledge base, compared to the class of coherent models.\nThis allows a larger class of monotone non-decreasing activation functions in neural network models to be captured\n(for space limitation, for this result, we refer to , Sec. 7). The notion of faithful multipreference entailment (fm-entailment) from a weighted 𝒜​ℒ​𝒞𝐅​𝐓𝒜ℒsuperscript𝒞𝐅𝐓\\mathcal{ALC}^{{\\bf F}}{\\bf T} knowledge base K𝐾K can be defined in the obvious way. A fuzzy axiom E𝐸E is fm-entailed from a fuzzy weighted knowledge base K𝐾K (K⊧f​mEsubscriptmodels𝑓𝑚𝐾𝐸K\\models_{fm}E) if, for all fm-models I=⟨Δ,⋅I⟩𝐼Δsuperscript⋅𝐼I=\\langle\\Delta,\\cdot^{I}\\rangle of K𝐾K, I𝐼I satisfies E𝐸E. From Proposition 2, the next corollary follows as a simple consequence. In Zadeh logic and in Gödel logic, fm-entailment from a given knowledge base K𝐾K satisfies postulates (REFL”), (LLE”), (RW”), (AND”), (OR”) and (CM∗). To conclude the paper let us\ninfomally describe how fuzzy multipreference entailment deals with irrelevance and avoids inheritance blocking, properties which have been considered as desiderata for preferential logics of defeasible reasoning  . For “irrelevance”, we have already considered an example: if typical birds fly, we would like to conclude that of typical yellow birds fly, as the property of being yellow is irrelevant with respect to flying. Observe, that in Example 2, we can conclude that Reddy is more typical than Opus as a bird (𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦<𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑𝑂𝑝𝑢𝑠subscript𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑦𝑂𝑝𝑢𝑠\\mathit{reddy<_{Bird}Opus}), as Opus does not fly, while Reddy flies. The relative typicality of Reddy and Opus wrt 𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑\\mathit{Bird} does not depend on their color, and we would obtain the same relative preferences if reddy were yellow rather than red. A formal proof of the irrelevance property would require the domain ΔΔ\\Delta to be large enough to contain some typical bird which is yellow, requiring, as usual in the two-valued case , a restriction to some canonical models. The fuzzy multipreference entailment is not subject to the problem called by Pearl the “blockage of property inheritance” problem ,\nand by Benferhat et al. the “drowning problem” . This problem affects rational closure and system Z , as well as rational closure refinements. Roughly speaking, the problem is that property inheritance from classes to subclasses is not guaranteed.\nIf a subclass is exceptional with respect to a superclass for a given property,\nit does not inherit from that superclass any other property.\nFor instance, referring to the typicality inclusions in Example 2, in the rational closure, typical penguins would not inherit the property of typical birds of having wings, being exceptional to birds concerning flying.\nOn the contrary,\nin fuzzy multipreference models,\nconsidering again Example 2, the degree of membership of a domain element x𝑥x in concept 𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑\\mathit{Bird}, i.e., 𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑I​(x)superscript𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑𝐼𝑥\\mathit{Bird^{I}(x)}, is used to determine the weight of x𝑥x wrt 𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑛𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑛\\mathit{Penguin} (as the weight of typicality inclusion (d4)subscript𝑑4(d_{4}) is positive. The higher is the value of 𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑I​(x)superscript𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑𝐼𝑥\\mathit{Bird^{I}(x)}, the higher the value of W𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑛​(x)subscript𝑊𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑛𝑥\\mathit{W_{Penguin}(x)}. Hence, provided the relevant properties of penguins (such as non-flying) remain unaltered, the more typical is x𝑥x as a bird,\nthe more typical is x𝑥x as a Penguin.\nNotice also that the weight W𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑​(x)subscript𝑊𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑𝑥\\mathit{W_{Bird}(x)} of a domain element x𝑥x wrt 𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑\\mathit{Bird} is related to the interpretation of B​i​r​d𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑑Bird in I𝐼I by the faithfulness condition.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: closure construction to strengthen 𝒜​ℒ​𝒞𝐅​𝐓𝒜ℒsuperscript𝒞𝐅𝐓\\mathcal{ALC}^{{\\bf F}}{\\bf T} entailment,\nwhich leads to a generalization of the notion of fuzzy coherent multipreference model in [ref]24.\nThe construction is related to the definition of Kern-Isberner’s c-representations   which also include penalty points\nfor falsified conditionals.
