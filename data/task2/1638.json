      "content": "Paper Title: Sample-Efficient Learning of Stackelberg Equilibria in General-Sum Games\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe computational complexity of finding Stackelberg equilibria in games with simultaneous play (“computing optimal strategy to commit to”) is studied in      . These results assume full observation of the payoff function, and show that several versions of matrix games and extensive-form (multi-step) games admit polynomial time algorithms. Vasal  designs computationally efficient algorithms for computing Stackelberg in certain “conditionally independent controlled” Markov games. Another line of work considers learning Stackelberg with a “best response oracle” [ref]27  , that returns the follower’s exact best response strategy when a leader’s strategy is queried. This oracle and the noisy reward oracle we assume are in general incomparable (cannot simulate each other regardless of the number of queries), and thus our sample complexity results do not imply each other. The recent work of Sessa et al.  proposes the StackelUCB algorithm to sample-efficiently learn a Stackelberg game where the opponent’s response function has a linear structure in a certain kernel space, and the observation noise is added in the action space instead of the reward (thus a different noisy feedback model from ours). Lastly, Fiez et al. 5 study the local convergence of first-order algorithms for finding Stackelberg equilibria in general-sum games. Their result also assumes exact feedback and do not allow sampling errors. The AI Economist  studies the optimal taxation problem by learning the Stackelberg equilibrium via a two-level reinforcement learning approach.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: efficient algorithms for computing Stackelberg in certain “conditionally independent controlled” Markov games.
