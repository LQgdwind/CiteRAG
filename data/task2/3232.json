      "content": "Paper Title: Class-aware Sounding Objects Localization via Audiovisual Correspondence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe realistic audio-visual scenario is usually composed of multiple sounding and silent objects, bringing great challenge to discriminative sounding objects localization.\nWe evaluated different methods on both synthetic and real data to validate models more reliably. Table I illustrated that our model is significantly superior to all other comparative methods in CIoU. Three main reasons can explain this phenomenon. First, the class information of sounding objects is taken into account through utilizing a category-based audiovisual alignment in our method, i.e., Eq. 11. However, other methods  [ref]7 just simply correlate the audiovisual features of the sounding area and cannot handle discriminatively localizing the sounding objects task. Second, our method benefits from the effective category-representation object dictionary learned in the first stage. Such an object dictionary can help our model locate potential objects in complex cocktail scenarios. The compared method, Sound-of-pixel [ref]14 cannot handle this scenario with a mix-then-separate learning strategy. Third, the silent objects can be filtered by our model, while DMC [ref]11 has to depend on the known number of sounding objects. In addition, the high-value of [ref]14 in NSA may be due to the channel activation being too low to detect objects, rather than successfully filtering out silent objects. We also show visualized localization results in realistic scenarios in Fig. 7, in addition to quantitative evaluation.\nBased on the shown results, the attention-based approach [ref]7 and Object-the-sound  can just simply localize the sounding area and is unable to discriminate the guitar or cello. DMC [ref]11 fails in such scenarios, mixing up different visual areas. Although sound-of-pixel [ref]14 provides comparable results, it is not able to localize the sounding object exactly and successfully filter out the silent saxophone, possibly because it relies highly on the quality of the mixed sounds. In contrast to these methods, our model localizes sounding guitar and cello and shows the low response for the silent saxophone and sound-unrelated area. The synthetic data yield similar results. In addition, to further evaluate both localization and recognition abilities of our model, we introduce the sounding mAP metric, which is similar to the mAP metric in object detection , while only taking the bounding box and category label of sounding objects as the ground truth. Since other methods cannot discriminatively localize sounding objects, we compare our model with one baseline method: Ours generates the bounding boxes for each category based on the localization results. The heatmap of each category is normalized, and the region larger than the threshold (0.5 in our experiment) is selected. Then, we extract boxes that can cover these regions with minimum size as the final bounding boxes. Random is simple baseline. The bounding boxes are the same as Ours while their category is randomly assigned. We evaluate these methods on the MUSIC-Duet and MUSIC-Synthetic, and the evaluation metric is Sounding mAP30subscriptSounding mAP30\\text{Sounding mAP}_{30}. For the MUSIC-Duet dataset, Random obtains 1.8 and Ours method achieves 11.5. In addition, Random and Ours respectively achieves 6.3 and 31.4 on the MUSIC-Synthetic dataset. Our method obtains reasonable performance, especially on the MUSIC-Synthetic dataset with more balanced instrument category distribution. In the experiment, we also find that some sound sources are out-of-screen in our experiment. For example, the instrument disappears from the screen sometimes. These out-of-screen clips were not excluded during the training. Based on the results on different dataset, this phenomenon does not have a huge impact on the model performance. However, for the sounding object localization results of such an out-of-screen scenario, the model would fail. Fig. 6 shows a failure case of out-of-screen sounding objects.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: this phenomenon.
