However, ensuring this one-to-one relationship has limited network structures.\nIn order for NFs to be efficiently trainable with the NLL (2), f𝜽subscript𝑓𝜽f_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} must not only be invertible, but also have a tractable Jacobian determinant. Although many successful deep learning networks in the image domain employ 3×\\times3 convolution, max-pooling and ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) layers, NFs cannot employ them since such layers are not invertible. A number of studies have found that only a few layers are appropriate for NFs in the image domain [ref]5 [ref]38  [ref]35  . The conditional coupling layers are what make the NF “conditional”; hence they are frequently used as the main layer.\nA conditional coupling transformation [ref]5  ϕ:Ω→Ω⊆ℝD:italic-ϕ→ΩΩsuperscriptℝ𝐷\\phi:\\Omega\\rightarrow\\Omega\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^{D} is defined as where 𝐡i=NN​(x1:d−1,g𝜽​(𝐲))subscript𝐡𝑖NNsubscript𝑥:1𝑑1subscript𝑔𝜽𝐲\\mathbf{h}_{i}=\\mathrm{NN}(x_{1:d-1},g_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{y})), NNNN\\mathrm{NN} is an arbitrary neural network, g𝜽subscript𝑔𝜽g_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} is an encoder for the conditional input 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y}, and c​(⋅;𝐡​(𝐲)):Ω′→Ω′⊆ℝ:𝑐⋅𝐡𝐲→superscriptΩ′superscriptΩ′ℝc(\\cdot;\\mathbf{h}(\\mathbf{y})):\\Omega^{\\prime}\\rightarrow\\Omega^{\\prime}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R} is an invertible function parameterized by a vector 𝐡𝐡\\mathbf{h}.\nThe Jacobian determinant of this transformation is easily obtained from the derivative of c𝑐c, expressed as det​(∂ϕ/∂𝐱)=Πi=dD​∂c​(xi;𝐡i)/∂xidetitalic-ϕ𝐱superscriptsubscriptΠ𝑖𝑑𝐷𝑐subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝐡𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖\\mathrm{det}\\left({\\partial\\phi}/{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}\\right)=\\Pi_{i=d}^{D}{\\partial c(x_{i};\\mathbf{h}_{i})}/{\\partial x_{i}}.\nThe inverse of ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi is obtained as Many works employ affine transformations as c𝑐c: where 𝐡i=(si,ti)subscript𝐡𝑖subscript𝑠𝑖subscript𝑡𝑖\\mathbf{h}_{i}=(s_{i},t_{i}) due to computational efficiency for their Jacobian and inverse as well as sufficient expressive power  .\nThus, affine coupling transformations are suitable for generating images     and speeches   with large dimensions D𝐷D. There are also other coupling transformations for conditional NFs such as splines      or sigmoids , which are more complex than affine coupling transformations. Splines are diffeomorphic piecewise polynomials or rational functions.\nEven though employing conditional spline-based coupling layers is possible, splines or sigmoids are computationally challenging over affine transformations. Thus, they were not as popular as affine coupling transformations for imaging applications, but rather prominent in modeling probability distributions of smaller dimensions such as molecular structures  .\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) layers, NFs cannot employ them since such layers are not invertible.
