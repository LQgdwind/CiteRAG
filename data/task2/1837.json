The two first authors have been supported by the Research Council of Norway via the project “MULTIVAL”. The third author has been supported by the ANR projects DEMOGRAPH (ANR-16-CE40-0028) and ESIGMA (ANR-17-CE23-0010) and the French-German Collaboration ANR/DFG Project UTMA ANR-20-CE92-0027.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe established a parameterized complexity dichotomy for the elimination problems whose aim is to satisfy a FOL formula φ𝜑\\varphi with respect to the quantification structure of the prefix. For this, we considered three variants of the elimination distance to the class of graphs modelling φ𝜑\\varphi and defined the Elimination Distance–(⋆⋆\\star) to φ𝜑\\varphi for ⋆∈{conn,prop,depth}\\star\\in\\{\\text{\\sf conn},\\text{\\sf prop},\\text{\\sf depth}\\} corresponding to the considered type of distance.\nIn Theorem 1, we proved that for every FOL formula φ∈Σ3𝜑subscriptΣ3\\varphi\\in\\Sigma_{3}, Elimination Distance–(⋆⋆\\star) to φ𝜑\\varphi is 𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖯𝖳\\operatorname{{\\sf FPT}} for ⋆∈{conn,prop,depth}\\star\\in\\{\\text{\\sf conn},\\text{\\sf prop},\\text{\\sf depth}\\}.\nIn Theorem 2, we showed that this result is tight in the sense that there are FOL formulas φ∈Π3𝜑subscriptΠ3\\varphi\\in\\Pi_{3} such that these problems are 𝖶⁡𝖶2\\operatorname{{\\sf W}}-hard. Notice that the above dichotomy is the same for all the considered variants of the elimination problems. Moreover, it coincides with the structural dichotomy obtained by\nfor Deletion to φ𝜑\\varphi by Fomin, Golovach, and Thilikos in . This leads to the following natural question: is there a FOL formula φ𝜑\\varphi such that the parameterized complexity of Elimination Distance–(⋆⋆\\star) to φ𝜑\\varphi for ⋆∈{conn,prop,depth}\\star\\in\\{\\text{\\sf conn},\\text{\\sf prop},\\text{\\sf depth}\\} and Deletion to φ𝜑\\varphi differs? In particular, is there a formula φ𝜑\\varphi such that Deletion to φ𝜑\\varphi is 𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖯𝖳\\operatorname{{\\sf FPT}} but one of the problem Elimination Distance–(⋆⋆\\star) to φ𝜑\\varphi for ⋆∈{conn,prop,depth}\\star\\in\\{\\text{\\sf conn},\\text{\\sf prop},\\text{\\sf depth}\\} turns to be, say 𝖶⁡𝖶1\\operatorname{{\\sf W}} or 𝖶⁡𝖶2\\operatorname{{\\sf W}}-hard? Note that Lemma 5 holds for every FOL formula φ𝜑\\varphi. Thus, solving Elimination Distance–(⋆⋆\\star) to φ𝜑\\varphi for ⋆∈{conn,prop,depth}\\star\\in\\{\\text{\\sf conn},\\text{\\sf prop},\\text{\\sf depth}\\} can be reduced to solving these problems on unbreakable graphs by Theorem 3. Since Elimination Distance–(⋆⋆\\star) to φ𝜑\\varphi for ⋆∈{conn,prop,depth}\\star\\in\\{\\text{\\sf conn},\\text{\\sf prop},\\text{\\sf depth}\\} is somehow similar to Deletion to φ𝜑\\varphi on unbreakable graphs, it may happen that Elimination Distance–(⋆⋆\\star) to φ𝜑\\varphi for ⋆∈{conn,prop,depth}\\star\\in\\{\\text{\\sf conn},\\text{\\sf prop},\\text{\\sf depth}\\} are 𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖯𝖳\\operatorname{{\\sf FPT}} whenever Deletion to φ𝜑\\varphi is 𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖯𝖳\\operatorname{{\\sf FPT}}. However proving this would demand applying different algorithmic tools as our techniques are tailored for φ∈Σ3𝜑subscriptΣ3\\varphi\\in\\Sigma_{3}. Also it would be interesting to know whether there are FOL formulas such that Elimination Distance–(⋆⋆\\star) to φ𝜑\\varphi for ⋆∈{conn,prop,depth}\\star\\in\\{\\text{\\sf conn},\\text{\\sf prop},\\text{\\sf depth}\\} differ from the parameterized complexity viewpoint. In contrast with the same behaviour of the elimination and deletion problems with respect to the inclusion in 𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖯𝖳\\operatorname{{\\sf FPT}}, we would like to point that they behave differently with respect to kernelization (we refer to the books 0 6 for the definition of the notion). It was shown in  that Deletion to φ𝜑\\varphi admits a polynomial kernel for φ∈Σ1∪Π1𝜑subscriptΣ1subscriptΠ1\\varphi\\in\\Sigma_{1}\\cup\\Pi_{1} (in fact, Deletion to φ𝜑\\varphi is polynomial for φ∈Σ1𝜑subscriptΣ1\\varphi\\in\\Sigma_{1}) and there are formulas φ∈Π2𝜑subscriptΠ2\\varphi\\in\\Pi_{2} and Σ2subscriptΣ2\\Sigma_{2} such that Deletion to φ𝜑\\varphi has no polynomial kernel unless 𝖭𝖯⊆𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖭𝖯𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒\\operatorname{{\\sf NP}}\\subseteq\\operatorname{{\\sf coNP}}/{\\sf poly}.\nFor the elimination problems, we can show the following lower bound. There are formulas φ∈Π1𝜑subscriptΠ1\\varphi\\in\\Pi_{1} such that Elimination Distance–(⋆⋆\\star) to φ𝜑\\varphi do not admit polynomial kernels unless 𝖭𝖯⊆𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖭𝖯𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒\\operatorname{{\\sf NP}}\\subseteq\\operatorname{{\\sf coNP}}/{\\sf poly} for ⋆∈{conn,prop,depth}\\star\\in\\{\\text{\\sf conn},\\text{\\sf prop},\\text{\\sf depth}\\}. We show the claim for the formula φ𝜑\\varphi expressing the property that a graph has no triangles, that is, cycles of length three: It is straightforward to see that G⊧φmodels𝐺𝜑G\\models\\varphi if and only if G𝐺G has no triangles. By the classical results of Lewis and Yannakakis 2, Deletion to φ𝜑\\varphi is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\operatorname{{\\sf NP}}-complete. Then it is easy to observe that the problem remains 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\operatorname{{\\sf NP}} on instances (G,k)𝐺𝑘(G,k), where G𝐺G is a (k+1)𝑘1(k+1)-connected graph. For example, we can reduce from Deletion to φ𝜑\\varphi on general graphs. Let G𝐺G be an n𝑛n-vertex graph. We assume that k<n−1𝑘𝑛1k<n-1 as otherwise the problem is trivial.\nWe construct the graph G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} from G𝐺G by adding k+1𝑘1k+1 copies of the complete bipartite graph Kn,nsubscript𝐾𝑛𝑛K_{n,n} and making each vertex of one part of the vertex partition to a unique vertex of G𝐺G. Clearly, G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} is (k+1)𝑘1(k+1)-connected and it is easy to see that G−X𝐺𝑋G-X is triangle-free if and only if G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} has no triangles for every X⊆V​(G′)𝑋𝑉superscript𝐺′X\\subseteq V(G^{\\prime}).\nThis proves the 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\operatorname{{\\sf NP}}-hardness for Deletion to φ𝜑\\varphi on (k+1)𝑘1(k+1)-connected graphs. Then Observation 4 implies that Elimination Distance–(⋆⋆\\star) to φ𝜑\\varphi is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\operatorname{{\\sf NP}}-complete for every ⋆∈{conn,prop,depth}\\star\\in\\{\\text{\\sf conn},\\text{\\sf prop},\\text{\\sf depth}\\}. Let (G1,k),…​(Gt,k)subscript𝐺1𝑘…subscript𝐺𝑡𝑘(G_{1},k),\\ldots(G_{t},k) be instances of Elimination Distance–(⋆⋆\\star) to φ𝜑\\varphi for some ⋆∈{conn,prop,depth}\\star\\in\\{\\text{\\sf conn},\\text{\\sf prop},\\text{\\sf depth}\\}.\nLet G𝐺G be the disjoint union of G1,…,Gtsubscript𝐺1…subscript𝐺𝑡G_{1},\\ldots,G_{t}. Then for ⋆∈{conn,prop}\\star\\in\\{\\text{\\sf conn},\\text{\\sf prop}\\}, we have that (G,k)𝐺𝑘(G,k) is a yes-instance of Elimination Distance–(⋆⋆\\star) to φ𝜑\\varphi if and only if (Gj,k)subscript𝐺𝑗𝑘(G_{j},k) is a yes-instance of Elimination Distance–(⋆⋆\\star) to φ𝜑\\varphi for every j∈{1,…,t}𝑗1…𝑡j\\in\\{1,\\ldots,t\\}.\nThen by the result of Bodlaender, Jansen, and Kratsch  (see also [16, Part III] for the introduction to the technique), Elimination Distance–(⋆⋆\\star) to φ𝜑\\varphi does not admit a polynomial kernel unless 𝖭𝖯⊆𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖭𝖯𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒\\operatorname{{\\sf NP}}\\subseteq\\operatorname{{\\sf coNP}}/{\\sf poly}. For Elimination Distance–(depth) to φ𝜑\\varphi, consider G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} that is the disjoint union of G𝐺G and Kk+3subscript𝐾𝑘3K_{k+3}. Clearly, 𝖾𝖽φdepth​(Kk+2)=k+1superscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑depthsubscript𝐾𝑘2𝑘1{\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\text{\\sf depth}}(K_{k+2})=k+1. Then by Lemma 2, (G′,k+1)superscript𝐺′𝑘1(G^{\\prime},k+1) is a yes-instance of Elimination Distance–(depth) to φ𝜑\\varphi if and only if (Gj,k)subscript𝐺𝑗𝑘(G_{j},k) is a yes-instance of Elimination Distance–(depth) to φ𝜑\\varphi for every j∈{1,…,t}𝑗1…𝑡j\\in\\{1,\\ldots,t\\}. This implies that Elimination Distance–(depth) to φ𝜑\\varphi has no polynomial kernel unless 𝖭𝖯⊆𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖭𝖯𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒\\operatorname{{\\sf NP}}\\subseteq\\operatorname{{\\sf coNP}}/{\\sf poly}.\n∎ Notice that Proposition 1 does no exclude existence of Turing kernels (we again refer to 0 6 for the definition of the notion). This makes it natural to ask whether Elimination Distance–(⋆⋆\\star) to φ𝜑\\varphi admit polynomial Turing kernels for φ∈Σ3𝜑subscriptΣ3\\varphi\\in\\Sigma_{3} for ⋆∈{conn,prop,depth}\\star\\in\\{\\text{\\sf conn},\\text{\\sf prop},\\text{\\sf depth}\\}. We defined the depth of a set X⊆V​(G)𝑋𝑉𝐺X\\subseteq V(G) using a representation. However, there is an equivalent definition that uses the notion of tree-depth (see, e.g., [ref]5 for the definition). Let G𝐺G be a graph and let X⊆V​(G)𝑋𝑉𝐺X\\subseteq V(G). We define the torso of X𝑋X as the graph H𝐻H obtained from G​[X]𝐺delimited-[]𝑋G[X] by making every two vertices u,v∈X𝑢𝑣𝑋u,v\\in X adjacent if three is a component C𝐶C of G−X𝐺𝑋G-X such that u,v∈NG​(V​(C))𝑢𝑣subscript𝑁𝐺𝑉𝐶u,v\\in N_{G}(V(C)). Then the following property can be shown by the definition of tree-depth. For a set X⊆V​(G)𝑋𝑉𝐺X\\subseteq V(G) and an integer k𝑘k, 𝖽𝖾𝗉𝗍𝗁​(X)≤k−1𝖽𝖾𝗉𝗍𝗁𝑋𝑘1{\\sf depth}(X)\\leq k-1 if and only if the tree-depth of the torso of X𝑋X is at most k𝑘k. Thus, Elimination Distance–(depth) to φ𝜑\\varphi can be stated as follows: given a graph G𝐺G and a nonnegative integer k𝑘k, is there X⊆V​(G)𝑋𝑉𝐺X\\subseteq V(G) whose torso has the tree-depth at most k𝑘k such that G−X⊧φmodels𝐺𝑋𝜑G-X\\models\\varphi? In other words, we ask whether there is a set of vertices whose torso has bounded tree-depth such that the graph obtained by the deletion of this set models our formula. Then we can consider the variants of Elimination Distance–(depth) to φ𝜑\\varphi for other “width-measures”. For example, what can be said about parameterized complexity of the variant of Elimination Distance–(depth) to φ𝜑\\varphi, where the tree-width (see, e.g, 0 for the defintion) of the torso of X𝑋X should be at most k−1𝑘1k-1? Finally, we believe that it could be interesting to consider yet another variant of the elimination distance. Recall that in the definitions of 𝖾𝖽φ⋆superscriptsubscript𝖾𝖽𝜑⋆{\\sf ed}_{\\varphi}^{\\star} for ⋆∈{conn,prop,depth}\\star\\in\\{\\text{\\sf conn},\\text{\\sf prop},\\text{\\sf depth}\\}, we considered properties of the components. In particular, However, we can consider unions of components instead. We say that graphs G1,…,Gssubscript𝐺1…subscript𝐺𝑠G_{1},\\ldots,G_{s} form a component-partition of G𝐺G if every component of G𝐺G is a component of Gisubscript𝐺𝑖G_{i} for some i∈{1,…,s}𝑖1…𝑠i\\in\\{1,\\ldots,s\\} and G𝐺G is the disjoint union of G1,…,Gssubscript𝐺1…subscript𝐺𝑠G_{1},\\ldots,G_{s}. Then, we can define Then we can define the respective Elimination Distance–(part) to φ𝜑\\varphi and investigate its parameterized complexity depending of φ𝜑\\varphi. Note that our approach for solving the elimination problems fails in this case. In particular, we cannot express the problem using MSOL.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: prop},\\text{\\sf depth}\\}. We defined the depth of a set X⊆V​(G)𝑋𝑉𝐺X\\subseteq V(G) using a representation. However, there is an equivalent definition that uses the notion of tree-depth (see, e.g., [ref]5 for the definition). Let G𝐺G be a graph and let X⊆V​(G)𝑋𝑉𝐺X\\subseteq V(G). We define the torso of X𝑋X as the graph H𝐻H obtained from G​[X]𝐺delimited-[]𝑋G[X] by making every two vertices\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
