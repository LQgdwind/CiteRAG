      "content": "Paper Title: GraphFM: Graph Factorization Machines for Feature Interaction Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModeling feature interactions is the key to success of predictive analytics and therefore extensively studied in the literature.\nFM  learns pairwise feature interactions from vector inner products.\nAfterwards, different variants of FM have been proposed.\nField-aware factorization machine (FFM)  considers the field information and introduces field-aware embedding.\nAFM [ref]49 considers the weight of different second-order feature interactions.\nHowever, these approaches can only model second-order interaction which is not sufficient. With the success of DNNs in various fields, researchers start to use it to learn high-order feature interactions due to its deeper structures and nonlinear activation functions.\nThe general paradigm is to concatenate the representations of feature fields together and feed them into DNNs to learn the high-order feature interactions.\nFactorisation-machine supported Neural Networks (FNNs) [ref]54 uses the pre-trained factorization machines for field embedding before applying DNN.\nProduct-based Neural Network (PNN)  models both second-order and high-order interactions by introducing a product layer between field embedding layer and DNN layer.\nSimilarly, Neural Factorization Machine (NFM) [ref]15 devises a Bi-Interaction Pooling layer between embedding layer and DNN layer to model second-order interactions, but the followed operation is summation instead of concatenation as in PNN.\nSome works on another line try to model the second-order and high-order interactions jointly via a hybrid architectures.\nThe Wide&Deep  and DeepFM  contain a wide part to model the low-order interaction and a deep part to model the high-order interaction.\nHowever, all these approaches leveraging DNN learn the high-order feature interactions in an implicit, bit-wise way.\nThere lacks explanation on the feature interaction modeling process and the model outcome.\nSome studies thus try to learn feature interactions in an explicit fashion via specifically designed networks.\nDeep&Cross  introduces a CrossNet which takes outer product of features at the bit level.\nxDeepFM  introduces a CIN to take outer product at the vector level.\nThen it compress the feature maps derived from the outer product to update feature representations.\nHowever, xDeepFM suffers from generalization, scalability issues and rather high complexity since it considers all pairwise bit-level interactions. Recently, some works try to utilize attention mechanism to model feature interactions in an interpretable way.\nHoAFM  updates feature’s representation by attentively aggregating the representations of co-occurred features.\nAutoInt  first tried to use multi-head self-attention mechanism to model explicitly model the feature interactions.\nInterHAt  also devise an attentional aggregation strategy with residual connection to learn feature representation and model feature interactions.\nHowever, although these methods utilize attention mechanism to account for the weight of each pair of feature interactions (low or high), aggregating these interactions altogether will still introduce noise and degrade prediction accuracy. To solve these issues, some recent works try to identify the beneficial feature interactions automatically.\nAutoFIS  introduces a two-stage algorithm to search and model beneficial feature interactions via gate operation. However, there is a loss of information between the stages. Moreover, the modeling process is still uninterpretable.\nAnother work SIGN  utilize a matrix factorization (MF) based model to detect the beneficial feature interaction and a simple linear aggregation strategy to update feature representation and model their interactions, which may not be expressive enough.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: vector inner products.\nAfterwards, different variants of FM have been proposed.\nField-aware factorization machine (FFM)  considers the field information and introduces field-aware embedding.\nAFM [ref]49 considers the weight of different second-order feature interactions.\nHowever, these approaches can only model second-order interaction which is not sufficient.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
