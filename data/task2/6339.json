      "content": "Paper Title: Temporalising Unique Characterisability and Learnability of Ontology-Mediated Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe begin by summarising the relevant results that will be used as a black box in our investigation of temporalised queries. Let 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O} be an FO-ontology (typically in some DL).\nGiven queries 𝒒1subscript𝒒1{\\bm{q}}_{1}, 𝒒2subscript𝒒2{\\bm{q}}_{2}, we write 𝒒1⊧𝒪𝒒2subscriptmodels𝒪subscript𝒒1subscript𝒒2{\\bm{q}}_{1}\\models_{\\mathcal{O}}{\\bm{q}}_{2} and say that 𝒒1subscript𝒒1{\\bm{q}}_{1} is contained in 𝒒2subscript𝒒2{\\bm{q}}_{2} wrt 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O} if 𝒪,𝒟⊧𝒒1​(a)models𝒪𝒟subscript𝒒1𝑎\\mathcal{O},\\mathcal{D}\\models{\\bm{q}}_{1}(a) implies 𝒪,𝒟⊧𝒒2​(a)models𝒪𝒟subscript𝒒2𝑎\\mathcal{O},\\mathcal{D}\\models{\\bm{q}}_{2}(a), for any pointed data instance 𝒟,a𝒟𝑎\\mathcal{D},a. We utilise a well-known reduction of containment to query entailment. An ontology 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O} admits containment reduction if, for any CQ 𝒒​(x)𝒒𝑥{\\bm{q}}(x), there is a pointed data instance (𝒒^,a)^𝒒𝑎(\\hat{{\\bm{q}}},a) such that 𝒒⊧𝒪𝒒′subscriptmodels𝒪𝒒superscript𝒒′{\\bm{q}}\\models_{\\mathcal{O}}{\\bm{q}}^{\\prime} iff 𝒪,𝒒^⊧𝒒′​(a)models𝒪^𝒒superscript𝒒′𝑎\\mathcal{O},\\hat{{\\bm{q}}}\\models{\\bm{q}}^{\\prime}(a), for any CQ 𝒒′​(x)superscript𝒒′𝑥{\\bm{q}}^{\\prime}(x) (we also demand a few minor technical conditions given in teh paper). An ontology language ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} admits containment reduction if every ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}-ontology does. It is easy to see that if ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} admits both (polysize) unique characterisations within 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} and containment reduction, then every 𝒒∈𝒬𝒒𝒬{\\bm{q}}\\in\\mathcal{Q} has a (polysize) singular+characterisation E𝐸E within 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} with E+={𝒒^}superscript𝐸^𝒒E^{+}=\\{\\hat{{\\bm{q}}}\\}. Containment reduction is a rather general condition (unfortunately not shared by temporalisations, see below): FO without equality including DLs such as 𝒜​ℒ​𝒞​ℋ​ℐ𝒜ℒ𝒞ℋℐ\\mathcal{ALCHI} and DL-LiteℋsubscriptDL-Liteℋ\\textsl{DL-Lite}_{\\mathcal{H}}  (aka DL-LitecoreℋsuperscriptsubscriptDL-Litecoreℋ\\textsl{DL-Lite}_{\\textit{core}}^{\\mathcal{H}} ) and also some DLs with limited counting such as DL-LiteℱsubscriptDL-Liteℱ\\textsl{DL-Lite}_{\\mathcal{F}}  (aka DL-LitecoreℱsubscriptsuperscriptDL-Liteℱcore\\textsl{DL-Lite}^{\\mathcal{F}}_{\\textit{core}} ) admit containment reduction but 𝒜​ℒ​𝒞​𝒬𝒜ℒ𝒞𝒬\\mathcal{ALCQ} does not. The two main approaches to compute E−superscript𝐸E^{-} and obtain singular+characterisations for languages with containment reduction are based on frontiers and splittings (aka dualities) .\nA frontier of 𝐪𝐪{\\bm{q}} wrt 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O} within 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} is any set ℱ𝒒⊆𝒬subscriptℱ𝒒𝒬\\mathcal{F}_{{\\bm{q}}}\\subseteq\\mathcal{Q} such that\n(a)𝑎(a) 𝒒⊧𝒪𝒒′subscriptmodels𝒪𝒒superscript𝒒′{\\bm{q}}\\models_{\\mathcal{O}}{\\bm{q}}^{\\prime} and 𝒒′⊧̸𝒪𝒒subscriptnot-models𝒪superscript𝒒′𝒒{\\bm{q}}^{\\prime}\\not\\models_{\\mathcal{O}}{\\bm{q}}, for all 𝒒′∈ℱ𝒒superscript𝒒′subscriptℱ𝒒{\\bm{q}}^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{F}_{{\\bm{q}}}; and (b)𝑏(b)\nif 𝒒⊧𝒪𝒒′′subscriptmodels𝒪𝒒superscript𝒒′′{\\bm{q}}\\models_{\\mathcal{O}}{\\bm{q}}^{\\prime\\prime} for 𝒒′′∈𝒬superscript𝒒′′𝒬{\\bm{q}}^{\\prime\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{Q},\nthen 𝒒′′⊧𝒪𝒒subscriptmodels𝒪superscript𝒒′′𝒒{\\bm{q}}^{\\prime\\prime}\\models_{\\mathcal{O}}{\\bm{q}} or there is 𝒒′∈ℱ𝒒superscript𝒒′subscriptℱ𝒒{\\bm{q}}^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{F}_{{\\bm{q}}} with 𝒒′⊧𝒪𝒒′′subscriptmodels𝒪superscript𝒒′superscript𝒒′′{\\bm{q}}^{\\prime}\\models_{\\mathcal{O}}{\\bm{q}}^{\\prime\\prime}.\nAn ontology language ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} admits (polysize) finite frontiers within 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} if every 𝒒∈𝒬𝒒𝒬{\\bm{q}}\\in\\mathcal{Q} has a (polysize) finite frontier wrt to any ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}-ontology within 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q}.\nThe following theorem summarises what is currently known about frontiers of ELIQs. While (i)𝑖(i) and (i​i)𝑖𝑖(ii) are shown in , we show (i​i​i)𝑖𝑖𝑖(iii) in this paper. (i)𝑖(i) DL-LiteℋsubscriptDL-Liteℋ\\textsl{DL-Lite}_{\\mathcal{H}} and the fragment DL-Liteℱ−superscriptsubscriptDL-Liteℱ\\textsl{DL-Lite}_{\\mathcal{F}}^{-} of DL-LiteℱsubscriptDL-Liteℱ\\textsl{DL-Lite}_{\\mathcal{F}}, in which R−superscript𝑅R^{-} is not functional for any B⊑∃Rsquare-image-of-or-equals𝐵𝑅B\\sqsubseteq\\exists R, admit polysize frontiers within ELIQ.\n(i​i)𝑖𝑖(ii) DL-LiteℱsubscriptDL-Liteℱ\\textsl{DL-Lite}_{\\mathcal{F}} does not admit finite frontiers within ELIQ.\n(i​i​i)𝑖𝑖𝑖(iii) ℰ​ℒℰℒ\\mathcal{EL} does not admit finite frontiers within ELIQ. The frontier of a query supplies the negative examples for a singular+unique characterisation. If ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} admits both (polysize) frontiers within 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} and containment reduction, then ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} admits (polysize) singular+characterisations within 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q}, with E−=ℱ𝐪superscript𝐸subscriptℱ𝐪E^{-}=\\mathcal{F}_{{\\bm{q}}}, for any 𝐪∈𝒬𝐪𝒬{\\bm{q}}\\in\\mathcal{Q}. The second path to singular+characterisations is via finite splittings, which only exist if a finite signature σ𝜎\\sigma of predicates is fixed. Let 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} be a class of queries and 𝒬σsuperscript𝒬𝜎\\mathcal{Q}^{\\sigma} its restriction to σ𝜎\\sigma, Q⊆𝒬σ𝑄superscript𝒬𝜎Q\\subseteq\\mathcal{Q}^{\\sigma} finite, and 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O} a σ𝜎\\sigma-ontology. A set 𝒮​(Q)𝒮𝑄\\mathcal{S}(Q) of pointed σ𝜎\\sigma-data instances (𝒜,a)𝒜𝑎(\\mathcal{A},a) is called a split-partner for Q𝑄Q wrt 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O} within 𝒬σsuperscript𝒬𝜎\\mathcal{Q}^{\\sigma} if, for all 𝒒′∈𝒬σsuperscript𝒒′superscript𝒬𝜎{\\bm{q}}^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{Q}^{\\sigma}, we have\n𝒪,𝒜⊧𝒒′​(a)models𝒪𝒜superscript𝒒′𝑎\\mathcal{O},\\mathcal{A}\\models{\\bm{q}}^{\\prime}(a) for some (𝒜,a)∈𝒮​(Q)𝒜𝑎𝒮𝑄(\\mathcal{A},a)\\in\\mathcal{S}(Q) iff 𝒒′⊧̸𝒪𝒒subscriptnot-models𝒪superscript𝒒′𝒒{\\bm{q}}^{\\prime}\\not\\models_{\\mathcal{O}}{\\bm{q}} for all 𝒒∈Q𝒒𝑄{\\bm{q}}\\in Q.\nAn ontology language ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} has general split-partners within 𝒬σsuperscript𝒬𝜎\\mathcal{Q}^{\\sigma} if all finite sets of 𝒬σsuperscript𝒬𝜎\\mathcal{Q}^{\\sigma}-queries have split partners wrt any σ𝜎\\sigma-ontology in ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}.\nWe show the following results.\n (i)𝑖(i) 𝒜​ℒ​𝒞​ℋ​ℐ𝒜ℒ𝒞ℋℐ\\mathcal{ALCHI} has exponential-size general split-partners within σ𝜎\\sigma-ELIQ,\n(i​i)𝑖𝑖(ii) even wrt to the empty ontology, no polysize split-partners exit\nwithin σ𝜎\\sigma-ELIQ [ref]22.\n Thus, ℰ​ℒℰℒ\\mathcal{EL} has finite general split-partners but no frontiers within ELIQ, and DL-Liteℱ−subscriptsuperscriptDL-Liteℱ\\textsl{DL-Lite}^{-}_{\\mathcal{F}} has finite frontiers but no finite general split-partners within ELIQ. This is in contrast to the ontology-free case where frontiers and splittings are more closely linked .\nOne can now show the following analogue of Theorem 2 for splittings: If ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} admits (polysize) general split-partners within 𝒬σsuperscript𝒬𝜎\\mathcal{Q}^{\\sigma} and containment reduction, then ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} admits (polysize) singular+characterisations within 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q}, with E−=𝒮​({𝐪})superscript𝐸𝒮𝐪E^{-}=\\mathcal{S}(\\{{\\bm{q}}\\}), for any 𝐪∈𝒬σ𝐪superscript𝒬𝜎{\\bm{q}}\\in\\mathcal{Q}^{\\sigma}.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: 𝒜​ℒ​𝒞​ℋ​ℐ𝒜ℒ𝒞ℋℐ\\mathcal{ALCHI} has exponential-size general split-partners within σ𝜎\\sigma-ELIQ,\n(i​i)𝑖𝑖(ii) even wrt to the empty ontology, no polysize split-partners exit\nwithin σ𝜎\\sigma-ELIQ [ref]22.\n Thus, ℰ​ℒℰℒ\\mathcal{EL} has finite general split-partners but no frontiers within ELIQ, and DL-Liteℱ−subscriptsuperscriptDL-Liteℱ\\textsl{DL-Lite}^{-}_{\\mathcal{F}} has finite frontiers but\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
