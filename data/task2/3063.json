      "content": "Paper Title: DiverGAN: An Efficient and Effective Single-Stage Framework for Diverse Text-to-Image Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMode collapse is a common but crucial obstacle existing in the GAN.\nThere are two major directions to mitigate the lack-of-diversity and mode-collapse issues in the generative adversarial network (GAN) .\nSome publications suggest adapting the objective strategy to optimize the discriminator and the training process, e.g., by employing a minibatch discriminator [ref]17, spectral regularization  or unrolled optimization [ref]19.\nMetz et al. [ref]19 proposed Unrolled GAN introducing a new objective to make the generator be updated through an unrolled optimization of the discriminator.\nSalimans et al. [ref]17 developed a minibatch discriminator to check multiple output samples in a minibatch and a novel generator objective to tackle the overtraining on the discriminator.\nLiu et al.  recently proposed the spectral regularization for handling mode collapse. They suggest that the optimization of the discriminator is associated with the spectral distributions of the weight matrix. Still other papers suggest the use of auxiliary structures into a GAN to encourage the generator to explore more modes of the true data distribution, including an autoencoder  [ref]21  , multiple generators  , a conditional augmentation technique , etc.\nChe et al.  presented a mode regularized GAN (ModeGAN)\nincorporating the autoencoder into the standard GAN to avoid the mode missing problem. Motivated by ModeGAN, VEEGAN  built a reconstruction net to map the true data distribution to the latent codes so that the generator network is able to synthesize all the data modes. EBGAN [ref]21, BEGAN  and VAEGAN  also made efforts towards combining the GAN with the autoencoder. To combat the mode-collapse issue, Ghosh et al.  provided a multi-agent GAN architecture (MAD-GAN), where multiple generators are employed to capture different modes and one discriminator is designed to identify generated samples. There are also several works for mitigating the lack-of-diversity problem in the CGAN. Mao et al.  presented a regularization term to encourage the generator to explore more minor modes and force the discriminator to concentrate on the instances from the minor modes.\nTo produce diverse instances from the textual description, Zhang et al  developed a conditional augmentation technique (CA) concatenating a latent code and a textual variable sampled from the conditional Gaussian distribution as the inputs of the generator. Nonetheless, these approaches either require exorbitant computational cost or are invalid for a single-stage architecture. Here, we take the multi-generator model  as the example. Assuming that various single-stage generators are exploited to learn all modes of the true data distribution to overcome mode collapse, we expect that different generators are able to fit diverse modes. However, in practice, the generators are still prone to falling into a singular mode for text-to-image synthesis, since each generator only pays attention to the same conditional context.\nWe would like to propose to distinguish three levels of performance for a GAN\n: Level 1: Traditional mode collapse [ref]17 [ref]19     [ref]21 - strange, inappropriate patterns become a point attractor in the non-linear cyclic process  between the generator and the discriminator (cf. Figure 6 in [ref]17); Level 2: Light mode collapse    0 1 - patterns from the training set become wholly or partially an attractor for the generator. This is akin to lookup-table behavior made possible by the high number of parameters in a GAN. This constitutes the lack-of-diversity problem (cf. Figure 1, left, this paper); Level 3: Desired functionality - generation of diverse patterns that are semantically consistent with the text probe as regards the foreground and that provide a believable, natural pattern in the background. This paper focuses on solving the lack-of-diversity issue, i.e., the light mode collapse, not the severe, traditional mode collapse.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: generative adversarial network (GAN) .\nSome publications suggest adapting the objective strategy to optimize the discriminator and the training process, e.g., by employing a minibatch discriminator [ref]17, spectral regularization  or unrolled optimization [ref]19.\nMetz et al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
