      "content": "Paper Title: Relating Implicit Bias and Adversarial Attacks through Intrinsic Dimension\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nArtificial Neural Networks are well known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks [ref]1.\nThese attacks involve manipulating an input data point in a way that deceives an otherwise well-performing classifier, by making small alterations to a correctly classified data point. Numerous techniques have been proposed to create such adversarial examples, beginning with the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) [ref]20, followed shortly by variants such as Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) , which is an iterative version of the original FGSM algorithm. Both these methods employ gradient information to generate an appropriate adversarial example while ensuring that the ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p} norm of the perturbation remains below a fixed threshold œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon.\nThese algorithms were primarily developed for effectiveness rather than optimality, which may limit their ability to generate input samples with minimal perturbations, resulting in them being classified as \"maximum confidence\" attacks. In contrast, \"minimum norm\" attacks prioritize the identification of adversarial examples with the least amount of perturbation by minimizing its norm.\nIn this regard, some of the most notable proposals are L-BFGS [ref]1, the Carlini and Wagner attack [ref]22, DeepFool  and the recent Fast Minimum Norm (FMN) attack¬†, which seeks to combine the efficiency of FGSM and PGD with optimality in terms of perturbation norm.\n\nThe robustness of neural networks against adversarial attacks remains an unresolved issue.\nAlthough adversarial training is currently the most effective technique for improving the resilience of neural classifiers, it often involves a trade-off between robustness and a reduction in performance on non-adversarial, clean data [ref]20. Moreover, it remains unclear why adversarial examples exist and whether they represent an inevitable byproduct of current neural architectures and training methods  . The goal of this work is not to propose a method for improving the adversarial robustness of neural networks. Rather, our aim is to provide valuable insights into the frequency content that is targeted by adversarial attacks and its relationship with the implicit spectral bias of the network.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Artificial Neural Networks are well known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks [ref]1.\nThese attacks involve manipulating an input data point in a way that deceives an otherwise well-performing classifier, by making small alterations to a correctly classified data point.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
