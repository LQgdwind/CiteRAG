With the advances in CNNs, Boroumand et al., Nam et al.5, and Yoon et al.6 demonstrated that placing an unpooled layer on the initial layer helps capture low-level signals (e.g., stego signals, local artifacts, and interpolation artifacts).\nWith the help of the preprocessing with a high-pass filter, He et al. and Nam et al. proposed CNNs to classify relocated I-frames and double-compressed I-frames, respectively.\nTo detect double JPEG compression accompanying an 8×8888\\times 8 unit quantization, such as intra coding in MPEG-4, Barni et al. used a CNN-based approach exploiting the DCT histogram of all DC and AC components .\nPark et al. improved upon the method  by providing a quantization table in the header to the CNN, which exhibited performance improvement .\nKwon et al. presented a JPEG artifact learning module (J-ALM) using the DCT volume representation and quantization matrix to learn the compression artifacts 7. Inspired by the previous works, we devise discriminant features to capture peculiar artifacts and design multi-stream architecture that effectively learns those features.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: based on handcrafted features and statistical characterization to explore fingerprints caused by the complicated processes of the target codec .\nTo capture fine artifacts, Sun et al. and He et al.[ref]4 employed the first digit distribution of quantized coefficients and block artifacts combined with the variation of prediction footprints, respectively.\nJiang et al. presented a linear\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
