The theory of computing the strong Stackelberg equilibrium starts from the seminal work by Conitzer and Sandholm  and has formed a celebrated sub-field of Stackelberg games   . These results assume that the player‚Äôs utility information is public and known to each other, and several computationally efficient algorithms are designed to compute the Stackelberg equilibrium. In addition, Goktas and Greenwald  study Stackelberg games with dependent strategy sets, based on the constrained maximin model¬†, and design first-order methods to efficiently solve the Stackelberg equilibrium under the condition of convex-concave utility and constraints. It turns out that the RSE problem is equivalent to solving a constrained maximin problem where the follower‚Äôs strategy set is determined by the leader‚Äôs strategy according to the Œ¥ùõø\\delta-best response set function. However, as the Œ¥ùõø\\delta-best response set function exhibits discontinuity without the convex-concave structure, computing RSEs is shown to be computationally intractable. The robust design problem of Stackelberg strategies has been studied in many recent works, in contexts with uncertain follower utilities\n   or follower‚Äôs uncertain perception of leader‚Äôs mixed strategies [ref]4 .\nThe solution concept of RSE is different from the previous robustness notion in that the RSE does not make any specific assumptions about the underlying cause of suboptimal follower behavior. Thus, it is applicable to a wider range of scenarios to address suboptimal follower behavior.\nTo our knowledge, [ref]38 is the only work that studied a very close RSE solution concept as us. Nevertheless, they focused mostly on experimentally verifying the performance of algorithms based on mixed-integer linear programming for computing robust solutions. The utility uncertainties have also been considered in machine learning contexts. These results take a learning-theoretic approach and show efficient algorithms to learn the strong Stackelberg equilibrium. One line of research considers the case where the leader is only able to observe follower‚Äôs responses but not the payoffs¬†   . All these works focused on a setting where the follower always optimally responds to the leader‚Äôs strategy, whereas the follower in our model may respond with any approximately optimal action.\nMeanwhile, Bai et¬†al. [ref]5 studied a setting where the learner can query any action profile and directly observe bandit feedback of the follower‚Äôs payoffs. We analyze the learnability of the RSE in the same learning setup and present strengthened results as a side product of our result for learning the RSE.\nOur work reveals the intrinsic connections between robust solution concept and learnability, which in some sense echoes the reduction result from online learning regret to robust mechanism design . More generally, our work subscribes to the rich literature on robust game theory¬†  2    6.\nIn simultaneous games,   studied the existence of Œ¥ùõø\\delta-equilibrium point as an extension of the Nash equilibrium, where each player‚Äôs strategy, given other players‚Äô strategy profile, has suboptimality at most Œ¥ùõø\\delta.\nMeanwhile, Aghassi and Bertsimas  proposed another equilibrium concept, known as the robust-optimization equilibrium, under which each player, given other players‚Äô strategy profile, takes the strategy that maximizes her worst-case utility under the uncertainty of her utility function. This concept is a distribution-free solution concept in contrast to the ex-post equilibrium¬†5 in Bayesian games¬†. Among others, Aghassi and Bertsimas , Crespi et¬†al. 6, Perchet  studied the existence and computation of robust-optimization equilibrium as well as its sensitivity to the robustness parameters, through its connection with the Nash equilibrium of a nominal game (based on worst case payoff function of the original game). Our paper also considers a robust solution concept based on the worst-case optimization in Stackelberg games and studies similar aspects of this solution concept. However, a critical difference between RSE and the robust-optimization equilibrium  is that the source of uncertainty in RSE primarily comes from the opponent‚Äôs (possibly sub-optimal) responses, instead of each player‚Äôs utility function ‚Äî as shown in Section¬†5, it is relatively straightforward to accommodate the latter type of uncertainty assuming the continuity of utility over the robustness parameters in our setup.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: design problem of Stackelberg strategies has been studied in many recent works, in contexts with uncertain follower utilities\n   or follower‚Äôs uncertain perception of leader‚Äôs mixed strategies [ref]4 .\nThe solution concept of RSE is different from the previous robustness notion in that the RSE does not make any specific assumptions about the underlying cause of suboptimal follower\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
