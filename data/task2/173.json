Fairness in machine learning models is a topic of increasing attention, spanning sex bias in occupation classifiers,[ref]16 racial bias in criminal defendant risk assessments algorithms, and intersectional sex-racial bias in automated facial analysis.[ref]18 Sources of bias arise in many different places along the classical machine learning pipeline. For example, input data may be biased, leaving supervised models vulnerable to labeling and cohort bias.[ref]18 Minority groups may also be under-sampled, or the features collected may not be indicative of their trends.[ref]19 There are several conflicting definitions of fairness, many of which are not simultaneously achievable. The appropriate choice of a disparity metric is generally task dependent, but balancing error rates between different subgroups is a common consideration,   with equal accuracy across subgroups being a popular choice in medical settings. In this work, we consider the equality of opportunity notion of fairness and evaluate the rate of correct diagnosis in patients across several protected attribute groups. Ethical Algorithms in Health. Using machine learning algorithms to make decisions raises serious ethical concerns about risk of patient harm. Notably, biases have already been demonstrated in several settings, including racial bias in the commercial risk score algorithms used in hospitals, or an increased risk of electronic health record (EHR) miss-classification in patients with low socioeconomic status. It is crucial that we actively consider fairness metrics when building models in systems that include human and structural biases. Chest X-Ray Classification.\nWith the releases of large public datasets like Chest-Xray8,  CheXpert,  and MIMIC-CXR,  many researchers have begun to train large deep neural network models for chest X-ray diagnosis.     Prior work demonstrates a diagnostic classifier trained on Chest-Xray8 can achieve radiologist-level performance. Other work on CheXpert  reports high performance for five of their diagnostic labels. To our knowledge, however, no works have yet been published which examined whether any of these algorithms display systematic bias over age, race and insurance type (as a proxy of socialeconomic status).\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: Fairness and Debiasing.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
