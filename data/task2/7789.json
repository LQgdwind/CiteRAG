      "content": "Paper Title: Combining Combination Properties: Minimal Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQ: So, I am assuming that your main theorem provides a complete characterization of the possible and impossible combinations of properties?\nA: Not exactly.\nAlready in ,\none combination was problematic:\nno theories that are stably infinite and strongly finitely witnessable but not smooth were found, nor proven\nnot to exist. Q: Aha. These are the famous unicorn theories, right?\nA: Yes. They were named that way because such theories were never seen, and were conjectured not to exist.\nWe are currently working on resolving this conjecture, using other techniques. Q: And in the current paper, are you able to determine all the remaining combinations?\nA: Almost, except for two, that we also conjecture to be impossible (and feel that a proof would also lie beyond the scope and techniques of the present analysis). Q: So I guess now you will be back to the paper and present the new conjectures, as well as the main result?\nA: Yes, if you do not mind.\n— We first make the following conjecture regarding two combinations: A unicorn 2.02.02.0 theory is\nstrongly finitely witnessable with no computable minimal model function.\nA unicorn 3.03.03.0\ntheory is\npolite (smooth, and finitely witnessable) and shiny (smooth, stably finite, and has a computable minimal model function), but is not strongly polite (smooth, and strongly finitely witnessable). There are no\nUnicorn 2.02.02.0 and Unicorn 3.03.03.0 theories. Notice that, according to  , unicorn 2.02.02.0 theories that are smooth cannot have a decidable quantifier-free satisfiability problem; the same, however, is not necessarily true for the non-smooth case, or for unicorn 3.03.03.0 theories. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne-sorted\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpty\n\n\n\n\nSI¯+FW¯¯SI¯FW\\color[rgb]{1,0,0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{1,0,0}\\overline{\\textbf{SI}}+\\overline{\\textbf{FW}}\n\n\n\n\nSI+CV¯SI¯CV\\color[rgb]{1,0,0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{1,0,0}\\textbf{SI}+\\overline{\\textbf{CV}}\n\n\n\n\nSI¯+SW¯+CV¯SI¯SWCV\\color[rgb]{1,0,0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{1,0,0}\\overline{\\textbf{SI}}+\\overline{\\textbf{SW}}+\\textbf{CV}\n\n\n\nSM+FW¯+FMSM¯FWFM\\color[rgb]{0,0,1}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,1}\\textbf{SM}+\\overline{\\textbf{FW}}+\\textbf{FM}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSM+SW¯+SFSM¯SWSF\\color[rgb]{0,0,1}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,1}\\textbf{SM}+\\overline{\\textbf{SW}}+\\textbf{SF}\n\n\n\n\nSI¯+CF¯¯SI¯CF\\overline{\\textbf{SI}}+\\overline{\\textbf{CF}} (Theorem 6)\n\n\n\nSI¯+CV+FM+SF¯+Σ_​2¯SICVFM¯SFsubscriptΣ_2\\color[rgb]{0,0,1}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,1}\\overline{\\textbf{SI}}+\\textbf{CV}+\\textbf{FM}+\\overline{\\textbf{SF}}+\\Sigma_{\\_}{2}\n\n\n\n\nFM¯+CF¯¯FM¯CF\\overline{\\textbf{FM}}+\\overline{\\textbf{CF}} (Theorem 7)\n\n\n\nSM+CF¯SM¯CF\\textbf{SM}+\\overline{\\textbf{CF}} (Theorem 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSI¯+CV+FM¯+CF¯+Σ_​2¯SICV¯FM¯CFsubscriptΣ_2\\overline{\\textbf{SI}}+\\textbf{CV}+\\overline{\\textbf{FM}}+\\overline{\\textbf{CF}}+\\Sigma_{\\_}{2} (Theorem 8)\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\n\nSM+FW+SW¯SMFW¯SW\\color[rgb]{1,0,0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{1,0,0}\\textbf{SM}+\\textbf{FW}+\\overline{\\textbf{SW}}\n\n\n\n\nSM+SI¯SM¯SI\\color[rgb]{1,0,0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{1,0,0}\\textbf{SM}+\\overline{\\textbf{SI}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFW+SW¯FW¯SW\\color[rgb]{1,0,0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{1,0,0}\\textbf{FW}+\\overline{\\textbf{SW}}\n\n\n\n\nSI+SM¯+SWSI¯SMSW\\color[rgb]{1,0,0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{1,0,0}\\textbf{SI}+\\overline{\\textbf{SM}}+\\textbf{SW}\n\n\n\nFM¯+SF¯FMSF\\color[rgb]{0,0,1}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,1}\\overline{\\textbf{FM}}+\\textbf{SF}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFW+FM¯FW¯FM\\color[rgb]{0,0,1}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,1}\\textbf{FW}+\\overline{\\textbf{FM}}\n\n\n\n\nFM+SF¯FM¯SF\\color[rgb]{0,0,1}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,1}\\textbf{FM}+\\overline{\\textbf{SF}}\n\n\n\nSW+SF¯SW¯SF\\color[rgb]{0,0,1}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,1}\\textbf{SW}+\\overline{\\textbf{SF}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFW¯+FM+CF¯FWFMCF\\overline{\\textbf{FW}}+\\textbf{FM}+\\textbf{CF} (Theorem 4)\n\n\n\n\n We may now state the following theorem, which refers to\nTable 2.\nWe use abbreviated names of the properties: SI for stably infinite, SM for smooth, FW for finitely witnessable, SW for strongly finitely witnessable, CV for convex, FM for finite model property, SF for stably finite, and CF for computability of a minimal model function.\nA line X¯¯𝑋\\overline{X} over a property X𝑋X indicates its negation.\nThe table lists all the impossible combination of properties\nfound in  (red), in [ref]25 (blue), and the current paper (black).\nA list of properties (or their negations) separated by plus signs indicates\nthat the combination is impossible.\nIt is partitioned according to the complexity of the signatures:\nin the first column appear combinations\nthat are impossible in one-sorted signatures, while\nthe results of the second column hold generally, regardless\nof the number of sorts.\nSimilarly, the combinations of the first row are only\nproved for empty signatures, while in the second row they are general.\nFor example, the first line in the top left square\nmeans that there are no theories over an empty one-sorted signature that are neither stably infinite\nnor finitely witnessable. This was proved in .\nTwo entries in the table include Σ_​2subscriptΣ_2\\Sigma_{\\_}{2},\nwhich means that the corresponding combination\nis only impossible in Σ_​2subscriptΣ_2\\Sigma_{\\_}{2}-theories. With Conjecture 1 and Table 2 in place, we can now state the following theorem, which summarizes the resutls from\n [ref]25 and the present paper. Disregarding unicorn, unicorn 2.02.02.0 and unicorn 3.03.03.0 theories, a combination of properties\nis impossible if, and only if, it occurs in Table 2. The “if\" part of Theorem 3 is proved\nby considering each combination that appears in the table separately.\nThe combinations that do not involve\nthe computability of a minimal model function were proven to be impossible\nin  [ref]25.\nIn Section 0.5, we\nconsider the combinations that include this property.\nIn particular,\nTheorems 4, 5, 6, 8 and 7\ninclude the precise formulations of these results.\nThe “only if\" part is proved by providing\nexamples for all combinations not mentioned in Table 2.\nExamples\nwithout conmputability of a minimal model function\nwere given in  [ref]25.\nIn Section 0.6, we determine this property\nfor each of the examples from  [ref]25, and also provide\nnew examples for the remaining combinations.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: CF for computability of a minimal model function.\nA line X¯¯𝑋\\overline{X} over a property X𝑋X indicates its negation.\nThe table lists all the impossible combination of properties\nfound in  (red), in [ref]25 (blue), and the current paper (black).\nA list of properties (or their negations) separated by plus signs indicates\nthat the combination is impossible.\nIt is partitioned according to the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
