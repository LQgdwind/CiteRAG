Sound Generation from Text and Video\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExisting video-to-audio (V2A) generation methods have focused on achieving two main characteristics: (i) audiovisual relevance and (ii) temporal synchronization.\nThe first stream aims to represent general sound by leveraging datasets such as VGGSound  and AudioSet .\nGiven a set of video features, SpecVQGAN  learns a transformer to sample quantized representations (i.e., codebook) based on visual features to decode spectrogram.\nIm2wav  utilizes rich semantic representations obtained from a pre-trained CLIP  as sequential visual conditioning for an audio language model, and applies classifier-free guidance  to steer the generation process.\nRecently, diffusion-based models have shown the stunning ability to generate high-quality audio 7 [ref]44.\nDiffFoley 7 is a diffusion-based video-to-audio generation model that learns temporal and semantic alignment features through contrastive learning.\nAlthough it achieves better alignment between visual and audio inputs with prior training, it necessitates tremendous training data, such as the utilization of both VGGSound and AudioSet for alignment training.\nSeeing-and-hearing [ref]44 is another diffusion-based model that optimizes the generation process using ImageBind  which learns joint embedding space for six modalities (image, text, audio, depth, thermal, and IMU).\nHowever, they often struggle to generate temporally aligned sounds at short times in the video (e.g., dog barking, people laughing). On the other hand, other research works [ref]4  have focused on creating simplistic SFX (e.g., stick hits) using datasets like CountixAV  and GreatestHits 8, which provide fewer classes but more precisely temporal aligned data.\nCondFoleyGen  trains a transformer model to autoregressively predict a sequence of audio codes for a spectrogram VQGAN, conditioned on the given audiovisual example.\nSyncfusion [ref]4 predicts a discrete onset label that denotes the beginning of a sound for repetitive actions.\nRecent SonicVisionLM  employs a large language model (LLM) to utilize text as an intermediate product that facilitates user interaction for personalized sound generation.\nThey freeze Tango  and train ControlNet with timestamp estimated by a video for 23 SFX categories exclusively, where a sound event timestamp detection module is trained on a dataset comprising videos and sound timing data.\nWhile these approaches are limited to generating only pre-defined training SFX categories, our method generates sounds for various categories from the visual context.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: for an audio language model, and applies classifier-free guidance  to steer the generation process.\nRecently, diffusion-based models have shown the stunning ability to generate high-quality audio 7 [ref]44.\nDiffFoley 7 is a diffusion-based video-to-audio generation model that learns temporal and semantic alignment features through contrastive learning.\nAlthough it achieves better alignment\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
