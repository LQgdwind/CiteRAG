      "content": "Paper Title: Optimization of the location and design of urban green spaces\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNext, we provide a literature review motivating the studied problem as well as the positioning of our contributions within the existent work. To this end, we start by referring works on UGSs accessibility and inequity, and on the use of spatial optimization to support their planning. Then, we discuss the literature on facility location, particularly focusing on the modeling of user behavior. One of the most popular approaches in assessing UGSs accessibility is to use Geographic Information Systems (GISs). In , the distribution of parks in the city of Seoul is addressed due to inefficient accessibility. The authors debate that standard statistical indices on the parks’ serviceability do not accurately convey whether a park location is in a central or outer area, neither how citizens benefit from them. For instance, many studies use the linear distance to parks, instead of accounting for the population real path choices and travel time, and thus, failing to quantify the population patronizing each park. In addressing this issue, the authors demonstrate the importance of considering factors such as land use and population density around a park. In ,  and , GISs were also used to assess inequalities of green space accessibility among diverse socioeconomic groups in Leicester, England, in Porto, Portugal, and in Berlin, Germany, respectively. In , using a GIS database of neighborhood and green spaces characteristics in Bristol, England, the authors show a greater use of UGSs with decreased distance and that UGSs classified as parks tend to increase the physical activity of those living nearby. In , the authors develop a GIS-based spatial analysis model for the city of Tainan, Taiwan, to examine in terms of equity the distribution of urban public facilities. In all of these studies, accessibility is deemed necessary when planning the location of UGSs. It should be underlined that in , the authors suggest that conclusions made in a specific location are geographically biased and should not be generalized to other cities. Alternative methods were suggested to assess equity in accessibility to UGSs. For example, Ngom et al.  focus in individuals’ access to UGSs and suggest refining distance metrics with the use of travel costs and Spatial Interaction Models (SIMs). An ANOVA regression model is developed to explain the distance to green spaces and their total coverage area using significant explanatory variables. Two case studies are used for this purpose, including databases from the cities of Quebec and Montreal, Canada. Regression models show Montreal access to green spaces is less favorable in poorer areas than in wealthier areas. Boone et al.  recommend a novel approach based on Thiessen polygons to define each park catchment area and on an asymmetric reapportioning of census data, allowing to measure the crowding of a park. They apply the methodology in Baltimore, Maryland, and conclude unfair park access for African Americans. In , we are introduced to a Gaussian-based two-step floating catchment area model to assess spatial accessibility, and to an ordinary least squares model to assess socioeconomic disparities in the distribution of UGSs in Atlanta, Georgia. Using geospatial analysis and equity mapping exercises, Wolch et al.  show inequalities between sociodemographic groups in Los Angeles, United States. Ibes  uses a multistep statistical analysis to classify urban parks according to their specific physical and geographic dimensions, as well as their features. This is then mapped to a base layer of social variables in the city of Shanghai, China. In , the two-step floating catchment area method is used to display changes of UGSs access between 2010 and 2015 in the city of Macau, China. Spatial optimization is known as a reliable approach in the field of geography and urban planning to help urban planners make decisions about the location of public facilities. For a detailed review of spatial optimization concepts, we refer the reader to . Neema and Ohgai  consider the siting of urban parks and open spaces through the case study of the city of Dhaka, Bangladesh. In this paper, the authors formulate a multi-objective model to account for population density, air and noise pollution, and areas with low accessibility to urban parks and open spaces. A genetic algorithm with dynamic weighting is used to solve the optimization problem. In , two heuristics are proposed to optimize the allocation of green spaces over time. In , the authors study the optimal location and type of green spaces in a planning model given their greening benefits. The problem defines a multi-objective formulation, maximizing cooling and connectivity, and minimizing costs. The problem is solved using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. Yu et al.  formulate a multi-objective function to maximize simultaneously the economic, ecological and social value of green spaces and solve the problem using a genetic algorithm. In this paper, the social value acts as the input to model users’ demand for UGSs. More recently, Li and Ma  aim to support the decision-making process of UGSs planning using an optimization method that minimizes the land conversion cost of newly added UGS parcels. This solution aims to lower construction costs and improve utility of UGSs. The authors highlight that previous spatial optimization solutions can hardly be used in real-life context, failing to meet the actual constraints of equity and costs. In all these works, the behavior of the population, i.e., their habits in terms of UGSs visits, is not modeled. Moreover, the structure of the decision making process is not included. The problem of location and design of UGSs inherits from concepts of multiple variants of the Facility Location Problem (FLP). In its simpler version, the goal is to determine the location and design of facilities maximizing the number (or, more broadly, revenue) of individuals who patronize them, subject to a given budget. Thus, in our particular context where facilities are UGSs, modeling the behavior of individuals is extremely relevant for a proper assessment of their accessibility. An extensive stream of studies has made use of the Random Utility Model (RUM)  and the proportional (probabilistic) choice rule with deterministic utilities . We remark that the term demand is frequently used in this context to mean the proportion of individuals expected to visit a facility. Many FLPs studies have made use of the RUM, and authors have provided numerous methods to overcome the non-linearity of the objective function introduced by the use of the RUM. We note the work by Aros-Vera et al. , in which a mixed-integer linear programming formulation is proposed to model the problem of optimizing the location of park and ride facilities to maximize commuters usage, given a demand that follows a logit model. Motivated by the problem of school network planing, Haase and Müller  propose a method for solving a discrete location model with endogenous demand, in which students’ preferences are modeled with a RUM. In , a firm’s objective is to maximize the frequency of visits, or alternatively, the probability that customers will choose their facility over their competitor’s. The objective function is formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP). In , the same authors stretch the importance of customers segmentation to create homogeneous subgroups with shared characteristics at each demand point. Ljubić and Moreno  and Mai and Lodi  propose effective exact algorithms for the maximum capture (competitive) FLP when customers demand is modeled through a multinomial logit model. The main alternative to RUMs in choice modeling within the framework of competitive FLPs is based on Luce’s choice axiom , in which the choice probability is defined as a constant ratio of deterministic utilities. Luce’s axiom leads to the proportional choice rule, in which customers’ probability of choosing a facility is proportional to deterministic utilities . The proportional choice rule we are interested in is the SIM, also referred to as the gravity model or Huff-model. As underlined in , the proportional choice rule is deemed more appropriate for real-life application than the alternative deterministic rule, also referred to as the all-or-nothing approach . For this reason together with their broad applicability (e.g., health-care facility location  and electric vehicle charging stations placement ), we focus on SIMs. A stream of studies using competitive FLPs focus on the maximization of market share generated from newly installed facilities. In , the authors introduce the competitive facility location and design problem, where each facility has specific design options in a competitive framework. Here, the goal is to simultaneously optimize a facility’s location and its design components. The customer’s utility is defined as proportional to the facility’s attractiveness and to the inverse of the distance. The problem is formulated as an integer non-linear program. In , the same authors introduce a more general model, including gravity type and all-or-nothing demand. Drezner et al.  extend the gravity model by assuming that facilities’ attractiveness is random, which is argued as a more realistic approach. Little attention has been given to inclusion of fairness (or equity) as a component of the FLP. Marsh and Schilling [ref]45 made the first detailed literature review of the use of distributive fairness or equity in FLPs, and introduced a unified notation for the measures recognized at the time. Jung et al.  underline the limitations of minimizing traditional measures to achieve a fair solution to the classical FLP. They introduce the α𝛼\\alpha-fairness measure. Here, the demand is not factored in the problem. Filippi et al.  study the fair single-source capacitated facility location problem, which presumes that customers will access the provided facilities at an incurred cost. In this paper, the demand is fixed. In the 2-stage model presented in the work, we adopt a SIM to reflect the users’ behavior and fairness based on available real-world data will be accounted when distributing the city-budget among neighborhoods.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: attractiveness is random, which is argued as a more realistic approach.
