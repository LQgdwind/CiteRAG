      "content": "Paper Title: Image-Guided Navigation of a Robotic Ultrasound Probe for Autonomous Spinal Sonography Using a Shadow-aware Dual-Agent Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA large number of robotic systems have been developed to automate the US imaging of different human tissues. The reader can refer to  for a literature review. Different methods have been proposed to plan the movement of the probe during robotic US acquisitions.\nIn , the researchers transfer a manually planned scanning path in pre-operative MRI data to the actual patient during the intra-operative stage by registering the patient skin surface extracted from the MRI data to real-time RGB-D data.\nOther researchers directly plan the scanning path on the patient skin surface to cover a region of interest extracted from the RGB-D data . Recently, an RL-based method is proposed to control 3 degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a US probe based on the observation of tissue surface by an RGB camera to realize US imaging of a soft target in the presence of occlusion and movement .\nWhile these surface-based methods have demonstrated the feasibility to keep the probe in contact with the patient and acquire meaningful images, it may not always be feasible to identify the anatomy based on surface landmarks (e.g., in obese subjects) , which may reduce the versatility of these methods. Also, the US images that contain rich information of the anatomy have not been fully utilized in the probe motion planning.\nSome researchers proposed US-based visual servoing methods , but they focus on stabilizing the view of an existing target in the image rather than automatically searching for an anatomy.\nIn [ref]26, an automatic scanning strategy is designed to search for the longitudinal plane of the carotid artery by detecting carotid landmarks using well-engineered features.\nIn order to develop more generic methods, a number of machine learning-based solutions have been proposed to learn US probe guidance in a data-driven manner.\nSome researchers used imitation learning (IL) algorithms to learn 3-DOF guidance of the probe orientation from expert demonstrations in fetal US imaging . However, the IL-based methods usually rely on complete and accurate demonstrations, which may be intractable or expensive to obtain [ref]28.\nOther groups applied RL to learn the navigation of a US probe based on self-generated experiences in simulation. Some researchers built the simulation environment with spatially tracked 2D US images acquired by a sonographer on a grid placed on the patient during cardiac [ref]29 and spinal US imaging , and used RL to learn probe control with 2 to 4 DOFs. However, these methods have limited state-action spaces due to the design of simulation environments, which would reduce the flexibility of the RL agent. In , we preliminarily developed a deep RL solution to the 6-DOF control of the probe in a simulation environment built with reconstructed 3D volumes that cover the anatomy of interest, which can improve the flexibility of the learned navigation policy. A distinction between our work and the above works is that we explicitly focus on a system that enables fully automatic 6-DOF control of the US probe based on real-time US images to search for multiple standard views in spinal sonography. Therefore, the system does not rely on manual planning of the scanning path, preoperative tomographic imaging, surface landmark detection or manual initialization of the probe position. Also, our method does not require expert demonstration data, and is not restricted by limited state-action pairs. Instead, we build a simulation environment for probe-patient interaction using real-world US data, and propose a framework based on RL and DL to automatically interpret US images and autonomously plan the movement of the probe.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: researchers proposed US-based visual servoing methods , but they focus on stabilizing the view of an existing target in the image rather than automatically searching for an anatomy.\nIn [ref]26, an automatic scanning strategy is designed to search for the longitudinal plane of the carotid artery by detecting carotid landmarks using well-engineered features.\nIn order to develop more\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
