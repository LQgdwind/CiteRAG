Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforced Causal Explainer for Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCompared to the extensive studies in CNNs, explainability in GNNs is less explored and remains a challenging open problem.\nInspired by the methods devised for CNNs, recent works explaining GNNs by:\n Gradient-like signals w.r.t. the graph structure  [ref]14 : For example, SA  adopts gradients of GNN’s loss w.r.t. adjacency matrix as edge scores, while Grad-CAM [ref]14 is extended on GNNs. Masks or attention scores of structural features [ref]16  : The basic idea is to maximize the mutual information between the fractional (attentive) graph and the target prediction.\nFor instance, GNNExplainer [ref]16 customizes masks on the adjacency matrix for each graph independently.\nLater, PGExplainer  trains a neural network to generate masks for multiple graphs collectively.\nMore recently, ReFine  first pre-trains an attention network over class-wise graphs to latch on the global explanation view, and then fine-tunes the local explanations for individual graphs. Prediction changes on structure perturbations  [ref]19  :\nTo get the node attributions, PGM-Explainer [ref]19 applies random perturbations on nodes and learns a Bayesian network upon the perturbation-prediction data to identify significant nodes.\nMore recently, SubgraphX  employs the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to explore different subgraphs and uses Shapley values to measure each subgraph’s importance. Note that XGNN  focuses on model-level explanations, rather than local explanations for individual predictions.\nMoreover, it fails to preserve the local fidelity of individual graphs, as its explanation may not be a substructure existing in the input graph.\nIn contrast, our RC-Explainer explains each graph with a global view of the GNN model, which can preserve the local fidelity. As suggested in the previous work [ref]19, most of these works assume that the features are attributed independently, but ignore their dependencies, especially the coalition effect.\nOur work differs from them — we reformulate the explanation generation as a sequential decision process, accounting for the edge relationships and causal effects at each step, towards more faithful and concise explanations.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: in GNNs is less explored and remains a challenging open problem.\nInspired by the methods devised for CNNs, recent works explaining GNNs by:\n Gradient-like signals w.r.t. the graph structure  [ref]14 : For example, SA  adopts gradients of GNN’s loss w.r.t. adjacency matrix as edge scores, while Grad-CAM [ref]14 is extended on GNNs.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
