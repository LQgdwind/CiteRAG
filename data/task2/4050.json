The network architecture is similar to the one used in Monodepth2 . To reduce the impact of strong visual distortions (e.g. lens distortion) that characterized OC videos, we adopt deformable convolution [ref]8 for the depth encoder, similar to [ref]39 . We train in the same manner as , using auto-masking (μ𝜇\\mu) and per-pixel minimum photometric loss (Lp​hsubscript𝐿𝑝ℎL_{ph}). Since the photometric loss is not sufficiently informative for low-texture regions, common in OC imagery, and to enforce structural coherence, we apply extra regularization in the form of depth consistency loss , and extra spatio-temporal consistency losses. Considering that the additional regularization implicitly imposes depth smoothness, we discard the smoothness term (Ld​ssubscript𝐿𝑑𝑠L_{ds}) used in . To deal with specular reflections and occlusions by haustral folds we: (1) mask and in-paint specular reflections as in  and (2) remove outlier pixels having a loss greater than the 80-th percentile for the photometric and depth consistency errors.\nWe compute the additional spatio-temporal consistency and depth consistency losses i.e., Lp​h−e​x​t​r​asubscript𝐿𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑟𝑎L_{ph-extra} and Ld​csubscript𝐿𝑑𝑐L_{dc} respectively, between all image pairs in S𝑆S. where p​e𝑝𝑒pe is the photometric error from  containing L1 and SSIM losses, Vμsubscript𝑉𝜇V_{\\mu} is a set comprises of all valid pixels in mask μ𝜇\\mu and the specular reflection mask based on image intensity threshold. Ij→isubscript𝐼→𝑗𝑖I_{j\\to i} is a warped view of Ijsubscript𝐼𝑗I_{j} to Iisubscript𝐼𝑖I_{i} pose, using the predicted depth D~jsubscript~𝐷𝑗\\tilde{D}_{j} and Ti​jsubscript𝑇𝑖𝑗T_{ij}. D~j→isubscript~𝐷→𝑗𝑖\\tilde{D}_{j\\to i} is the predicted depth map for image Ijsubscript𝐼𝑗I_{j} in the coordinate system of image Iisubscript𝐼𝑖I_{i}. D^isubscript^𝐷𝑖\\hat{D}_{i} is the interpolated depth map from the estimated depth map D~isubscript~𝐷𝑖\\tilde{D}_{i}.\nThe final loss for the network is given in Eq. 3, where λp​h−e​x​t​r​asubscript𝜆𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑟𝑎\\lambda_{ph-extra}, λd​csubscript𝜆𝑑𝑐\\lambda_{dc} are weights for the different loss components.
