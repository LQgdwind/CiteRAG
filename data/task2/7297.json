      "content": "Paper Title: Lessons on Datasets and Paradigms in Machine Learning for Symbolic Computation: A Case Study on CAD\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost of the examples in the literature of ML to optimise symbolic computation take the form of supervised learning with the classification paradigm. Supervised ML means that we start with a dataset of labelled instances that we use to train the ML models. For example, a dataset of images where each image is labelled as either a cat or a dog is used to train a binary classifier to make that distinction. It is important that the data structure has some fixed features across the instances in the dataset, e.g. images of the same resolution or a representation as a fixed feature vector. This paradigm was first used for symbolic computation by Huang et al. in 2014 . They trained a support vector machine to choose the variable ordering for three-variable CAD problems (meaning six possible variable orderings); and later the same authors used this methodology to decide when to precondition a CAD input with computation ofa Groebner basis [ref]23, a binary classification. Florescu and England built on this, experimenting with models 8 and features 9. There are further examples of supervised ML classification for computer algebra away from CAD in the literature. An early example was by Simpson et al. who used ML classifiers to pick from different algorithms to compute the resultant , substantially improving the runtimes in both Maple and Mathematica. ML classifiers to select the subalgorithm for a task have proved powerful in computational logic: where SATZilla was an early example to select a SAT-solver for a problem , and recently MachSMT did this for the far more diverse world of SMT . Other recent examples of ML classification in computer algebra include the use of classifiers to predict features of amoebae in algebraic geometry , and the number of real solutions to polynomial systems . However, we draw a distinction between these and the prior examples since here ML is directly predicting the output, and thus inaccuracy in the ML predictions does not just lead to inefficiencies, but to incorrect answers.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: three-variable CAD problems (meaning six possible variable orderings); and later the same authors used this methodology to decide when to precondition a CAD input with computation ofa Groebner basis [ref]23, a binary classification.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
