      "content": "Paper Title: Solving 3D Inverse Problems using Pre-trained 2D Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe conduct experiments on three most widely studied tasks in medical image reconstruction: 1) sparse view CT (SV-CT), 2) limited angle CT (LA-CT), and 3) compressed sensing MRI (CS-MRI). Specific details can be found in the supplementary section B. Dataset. \nFor both CT reconstruction tasks (i.e. SV-CT, LA-CT) we use the data from the AAPM 2016 CT low-dose grand challenge. All volumes except for one are used for training the 2D score function, and one volume is held-out for testing. For the task of CS-MRI, we take the data from the multimodal brain tumor image segmentation benchmark (BRATS)  2018 FLAIR volume for testing. Note that we use a pre-trained score function that was trained on fastMRI knee  images only, and hence we need not split the train/test data here. Network training, inference. \nFor CT tasks, we train the ncsnpp model  on the AAPM dataset which consists of about 3000 2D slices of training data.\nFor the CS-MRI task, we take the pre-trained model checkpoint from444https://github.com/HJ-harry/score-MRI [ref]7. For inference (i.e. generation; inverse problem solving), we base our sampler on the predictor-corrector (PC) sampling scheme of . We set N=2000𝑁2000N=2000, which amounts to 4000 iterations of neural function evaluation with 𝒔θ∗subscript𝒔superscript𝜃{\\bm{s}}_{\\theta^{*}}. Comparison methods and evaluation. \nFor CT tasks, we first compare our method with Chung et al. , which is another diffusion model approach for CT reconstruction, outperforming . As using the manifold constrained gradient (MCG) of  requires  10GB of VRAM for a single 2D slice (256×\\times256), it is infeasible for us to leverage such gradient step for our 3D reconstruction. Thus, we employ the projection onto convex sets (POCS) strategy of , which amounts to taking algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) in each data-consistency imposing step.\nWe also compare against some of the best-in-class fully supervised methods. Namely, we include Lahiri et al. , and FBPConvNet  (SV-CT) / Zhang et al. [ref]37 (LA-CT) as baselines. For the implementation of , we use 2 stages, but implement the De-streaking CNN as U-Nets rather than simpler CNNs. Finally, we include isotropic ADMM-TV, which uses the regularization function R​(𝒙)=‖𝑫​𝒙‖2,1𝑅𝒙subscriptnorm𝑫𝒙21R({\\bm{x}})=\\|{\\bm{D}}{\\bm{x}}\\|_{2,1}. In the CS-MRI experiments, we compare against score-MRI [ref]7 as a representative diffusion model-based solver. Moreover, we include comparisons with DuDoRNet , and U-Net . Note that all networks including ours, the training dataset (fastMRI knee) was set deliberately different from the testing data (BRATS Flair), as it was shown that diffusion model-based inverse problem solvers are fairly robust to out of distribution (OOD) data in CS-MRI settings [ref]7 [ref]10.\nQuantitative evaluation was performed with two standard metrics: peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity index (SSIM). We report on metrics that are averaged over each planar direction, as we expect different performance for x​y𝑥𝑦xy-slices as compared to x​z𝑥𝑧xz- and y​z𝑦𝑧yz-slices.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: ncsnpp model  on the AAPM dataset which consists of about 3000 2D slices of training data.\nFor the CS-MRI task, we take the pre-trained model checkpoint from444https://github.com/HJ-harry/score-MRI [ref]7.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
