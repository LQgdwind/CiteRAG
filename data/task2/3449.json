      "content": "Paper Title: Tight Approximation Algorithms for Two-dimensional Guillotine Strip Packing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we present our pseudo-polynomial time approximation scheme (PPTAS) for GSP. Let ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 and assume w.l.o.g. that 1/ε∈ℕ1𝜀ℕ1/\\varepsilon\\in\\mathbb{N}. We\ndenote by OPTOPT\\mathrm{OPT} the height of the optimal solution. We classify\nthe input items into a few groups according to their heights\nand widths similar to the classification in [ref]33. For two constants 1≥δ>μ>01𝛿𝜇01\\geq\\delta>\\mu>0 to be defined later,\nwe classify each item i∈I𝑖𝐼i\\in I as: tall if hi>OPT/2subscriptℎ𝑖OPT2h_{i}>{\\mathrm{OPT}}/{2}; large if 0​p​ti>δ​W0𝑝subscript𝑡𝑖𝛿𝑊0pt_{i}>\\delta W and OPT/2≥hi>δ​OPTOPT2subscriptℎ𝑖𝛿OPT{\\mathrm{OPT}}/{2}\\geq h_{i}>\\delta\\mathrm{OPT}; horizontal if 0​p​ti>δ​W0𝑝subscript𝑡𝑖𝛿𝑊0pt_{i}>\\delta W and hi≤μ​OPTsubscriptℎ𝑖𝜇OPTh_{i}\\leq\\mu\\mathrm{OPT}; vertical 0​p​ti≤δ​W0𝑝subscript𝑡𝑖𝛿𝑊0pt_{i}\\leq\\delta W and OPT/2≥hi>δ​OPTOPT2subscriptℎ𝑖𝛿OPT{\\mathrm{OPT}}/{2}\\geq h_{i}>\\delta\\mathrm{OPT}; medium if either δ​OPT≥hi>μ​OPT𝛿OPTsubscriptℎ𝑖𝜇OPT\\delta\\mathrm{OPT}\\geq h_{i}>\\mu\\mathrm{OPT}; or δ​W≥0​p​ti>μ​W𝛿𝑊0𝑝subscript𝑡𝑖𝜇𝑊\\delta W\\geq 0pt_{i}>\\mu W and hi≤μ​OPTsubscriptℎ𝑖𝜇OPTh_{i}\\leq\\mu\\mathrm{OPT}; small  if 0​p​ti≤μ​W0𝑝subscript𝑡𝑖𝜇𝑊0pt_{i}\\leq\\mu W and hi≤μ​OPTsubscriptℎ𝑖𝜇OPTh_{i}\\leq\\mu\\mathrm{OPT}; See Figure 3 for a picture of item classification.

Using the following lemma, one can appropriately choose μ,δ𝜇𝛿\\mu,\\delta such that the medium items\noccupy a marginal area. This effectively allows us to ignore them\nin our main argumentation. Let ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0\nand f(.)f(.) be any positive increasing function such that f​(x)<x𝑓𝑥𝑥f(x)<x\nfor all x∈(0,1]𝑥01x\\in(0,1]. Then we can efficiently find δ,μ∈Ωε​(1)𝛿𝜇subscriptΩ𝜀1\\delta,\\mu\\in\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}(1),\nwith ε≥f​(ε)≥δ≥f​(δ)≥μ𝜀𝑓𝜀𝛿𝑓𝛿𝜇\\varepsilon\\geq f(\\varepsilon)\\geq\\delta\\geq f(\\delta)\\geq\\mu so that the total\narea of medium rectangles is at most ε​(OPT⋅W)𝜀⋅OPT𝑊\\varepsilon(\\mathrm{OPT}\\cdot W). We will specify how we choose the function f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x) later.\nIn our PPTAS, we will use a packing, which is defined solely via boxes. A box B𝐵B is an axis-aligned open rectangle that satisfies\nB⊆[0,W]×[0,∞)𝐵0𝑊0B\\subseteq[0,W]\\times[0,\\infty). We denote by h​(B)ℎ𝐵h(B) and w​(B)𝑤𝐵w(B)\nthe height and the width of B𝐵B, respectively. Inside each box B𝐵B, we will place the items nicely, meaning\nthat they are either stacked horizontally or vertically,\nor B𝐵B contains a single large item, or only small items, or only medium items. This is useful since in the first\ntwo cases, it is trivial to place a given set of items into B𝐵B, and\nin the last two cases, it will turn out that it suffices to pack the items\ngreedily using the Next Fit Decreasing Height (NFDH) algorithm [ref]13\nand Steinberg’s algorithm , respectively.\nThere will be one box with height at most 2​ε​OPT2𝜀OPT2\\varepsilon\\mathrm{OPT}\nthat contains all medium items. Let B𝐵B be a box and\nlet IB⊆Isubscript𝐼𝐵𝐼I_{B}\\subseteq I be a set of items that are placed non-overlappingly\ninside B𝐵B. We say that the packing of IBsubscript𝐼𝐵I_{B} in B𝐵B is nice\nif the items in IBsubscript𝐼𝐵I_{B} are guillotine separable and additionally IBsubscript𝐼𝐵I_{B} contains only one item, or IB⊆Ih​o​rsubscript𝐼𝐵subscript𝐼ℎ𝑜𝑟I_{B}\\subseteq I_{hor} and the items in IBsubscript𝐼𝐵I_{B} are stacked on top\nof each other inside B𝐵B, or IB⊆It​a​l​l∪Iv​e​rsubscript𝐼𝐵subscript𝐼𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑙subscript𝐼𝑣𝑒𝑟I_{B}\\subseteq I_{tall}\\cup I_{ver} and the items in IBsubscript𝐼𝐵I_{B} are placed\nside by side inside B𝐵B, or IB⊆Im​e​d​i​u​msubscript𝐼𝐵subscript𝐼𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑢𝑚I_{B}\\subseteq I_{medium}, or IB⊆Is​m​a​l​lsubscript𝐼𝐵subscript𝐼𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑙I_{B}\\subseteq I_{small} and for each item i∈IB𝑖subscript𝐼𝐵i\\in I_{B} it holds that\nwi≤ε⋅w​(B)subscript𝑤𝑖⋅𝜀𝑤𝐵w_{i}\\leq\\varepsilon\\cdot w(B) and hi≤ε⋅h​(B)subscriptℎ𝑖⋅𝜀ℎ𝐵h_{i}\\leq\\varepsilon\\cdot h(B). We will use the term container to refer to a box B𝐵B that contains a nice packing of some set of items IBsubscript𝐼𝐵I_{B}.\nSee Figure 4 for nice packings in different types of containers.\nWe say that a set of boxes ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} is guillotine separable if\nthere exists a sequence of guillotine cuts that separates them and\nthat does not intersect any box in ℬℬ\\mathcal{B}. We now state the structural lemma for the PPTAS. Intuitively, it states\nthat there exists a (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximate solution in which\nthe input items are placed into Oε​(1)subscript𝑂𝜀1O_{\\varepsilon}(1) boxes\nsuch that within each box the packing is nice.\nWe remark that we will crucially use that in the optimal packing the\nitems in I𝐼I are guillotine separable. In fact, if one could prove\nthat there exists such a packing with Oε​(1)subscript𝑂𝜀1O_{\\varepsilon}(1) boxes and\na height of α​OPT𝛼OPT\\alpha\\mathrm{OPT} for some α<54𝛼54\\alpha<\\frac{5}{4} also in the\nnon-guillotine case (where neither the optimal solution nor the\ncomputed solution needs to be guillotine separable), then one would\nobtain a pseudo–polynomial time (α+ε)𝛼𝜀(\\alpha+\\varepsilon)-approximation\nalgorithm also in this case, by using\nstraightforward adaptations of the algorithms in, e.g.,\n [ref]21  or our algorithm in section A.1.\nHowever,\nthis is not possible for α<54𝛼54\\alpha<\\frac{5}{4}, unless 𝖯=𝖭𝖯𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{P=NP}\n. Assume that μ𝜇\\mu is sufficiently small compared to δ𝛿\\delta. Then\nthere exists a set ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} of Oε​(1)subscript𝑂𝜀1O_{\\varepsilon}(1)\npairwise non-overlapping and guillotine separable boxes all\nplaced inside [0,W]×[0,(1+16​ε)​OPT)0𝑊0116𝜀OPT[0,W]\\times[0,(1+16\\varepsilon)\\mathrm{OPT}) and a partition\nI=⋃B∈ℬIB𝐼subscript𝐵ℬsubscript𝐼𝐵I=\\bigcup_{B\\in\\mathcal{B}}I_{B} such that for each B∈ℬ𝐵ℬB\\in\\mathcal{B} the items\nin IBsubscript𝐼𝐵I_{B} can be placed nicely into B𝐵B. We choose our function f𝑓f due to Lemma 2.1 such that μ𝜇\\mu is sufficiently small compared to δ𝛿\\delta, as required by Lemma 2.4.\nWe will prove Lemma 2.4 in the next subsection. In its packing, let ℬh​o​r,ℬv​e​r,ℬt​a​l​l,ℬl​a​r​g​e,ℬs​m​a​l​lsubscriptℬℎ𝑜𝑟subscriptℬ𝑣𝑒𝑟subscriptℬ𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑙subscriptℬ𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒subscriptℬ𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑙\\mathcal{B}_{hor},\\mathcal{B}_{ver},\\mathcal{B}_{tall},\\mathcal{B}_{large},\\mathcal{B}_{small} and ℬm​e​dsubscriptℬ𝑚𝑒𝑑\\mathcal{B}_{med} denote the set of boxes for the horizontal, vertical, tall, large, small and medium items, respectively.
