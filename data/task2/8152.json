However, this approach was tackling the problem of reproducibility maximisation instead of trade-off enforcement (see Section¬†III) and only one final best solution was kept per cell. Additionally, it was based on MOME instead of MOME-X and showed less promising results than ours. We note that maintaining a range of solutions that present different trade-offs is a key advantage of a-posteriori approaches, as it affords the end user flexibility to change between preferences in different cells, or at different times.\nAdditionally, if a preference parameter becomes available, then we can sample one solution per cell by ‚Äúprojecting‚Äù the final grid into a standard ME grid.\nGiven some values Œ¥fsubscriptùõøùëì\\delta_{f}{} and Œ¥rsubscriptùõøùëü\\delta_{r}{}, we project the MOME archive by choosing the solution in each cell of the grid which has the maximum weighted sum objective as defined in Equation¬†4.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: the user can first examine the range of possible trade-offs that are possible and then select their preference a-posteriori.\nIn this work, we use the MOME algorithm¬† with crowding-based exploration¬†[ref]20, which we term MOME-X [ref]34.\nWe note that a similar approach was used as a baseline in Grillotti et al¬†[ref]17 (see Section¬†II-C3).

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
