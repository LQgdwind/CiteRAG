      "content": "Paper Title: Mitigating Manipulation in Peer Review via Randomized Reviewer Assignments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany paper assignment algorithms for conference peer review have been proposed in past work. The widely-used Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS)  computes a similarity score for each reviewer-paper pair based on analysis of the reviewers’ past work and bids, and then aims to maximize the total similarity of the resulting assignment. The framework of “compute similarities and maximize total similarity” (and similar variants) encompasses many paper assignment algorithms, where similarities can be computed in various ways from automated and manual analysis and reviewer bids     [ref]18  . We treat the bidding process and computation of similarities as given, and focus primarily on adjusting the optimization problem to address the three aforementioned challenges. Some work has considered other optimization objectives such as fairness  . We also consider a similar fairness objective in a variant of our algorithm. On a related front, there are also a number of recent works   [ref]25           which deal with various other aspects of peer review. Much prior work has studied the issue of preventing or mitigating strategic behavior in peer review. This work usually focuses on the incentives reviewers have to give poor reviews to other papers in the hopes of increasing their own paper’s chances of acceptance     . Unlike the issues we deal with in this paper, these works consider only reviewers’ incentives to get their own paper accepted and not other possible incentives. We instead consider arbitrary incentives for a reviewer to give an untruthful review, such as a personal dislike for a research area or misincentives brought about by author-reviewer collusion. Instead of aiming to remove reviewer incentives to write untruthful reviews, our work focuses on mitigating the effectiveness of manipulating the reviewer assignment process. A concurrent work [ref]41 considers a different set of problems in releasing data in peer review while preserving reviewer anonymity. The data to be released here are some function of the scores and the reviewer-assignment, whereas we look to release the similarities and the assignment code. Moreover, the approach and techniques in [ref]41 are markedly different—they consider post-processing the data for release using techniques such as differential privacy, whereas we consider randomizing the assignment for plausible deniability. Outside of peer review, there is a line of prior work focused on detecting and mitigating manipulation in online reviews (such as those on Yelp or Amazon). These works typically make assumptions that are not applicable or require data that is not available in our setting. Several of these works analyze the graph of user reviews in order to detect fraudulent reviewers . For example,  detects fraud from the review graph by assuming that products are trying to maximize the number of positive reviews they get, whereas in our setting it is important to mitigate the effectiveness of just a single author-paper collusion since the number of reviews per paper is fixed and small. Additionally, some of these works    are based on estimating the “true quality” of each item from the review graph, which is not possible in peer review since paper evaluations are subjective. Another direction of prior work uses machine learning to detect malicious behavior. Some research  detects fraud from reviewer statistics such as rating variance or number of ratings, but in the peer review setting, there is so little data for each reviewer that such features would be highly noisy or completely uninformative. Other works  attempt to detect malicious reviews from the review text, but in our setting, malicious reviews may not differ stylistically from genuine reviews. Finally, some work in recommender systems focuses on making product recommendations resistant to malicious reviews ; however, in peer review, the paper acceptance process must be done by hand since it must take into account reviewer opinions, arguments, and the reviewer discussion. Randomized assignments have been used to address the problem of fair division of indivisible goods such as jobs or courses  , as well as in the context of Stackelberg security games . The paper [ref]25 uses randomization to address the issue of miscalibration in ratings, such as those given to papers in peer review. To the best of our knowledge, the use of randomized reviewer-paper assignments to address the issues of malicious reviewers or reviewer de-anonymization in peer review has not been studied previously.\nWork on randomized assignments often references the well-known Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem   or a generalization in order to demonstrate how to implement a randomized assignment as a lottery over deterministic assignments. The paper  proposes a broad generalization of the Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem that we use in our work.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: total similarity” (and similar variants) encompasses many paper assignment algorithms, where similarities can be computed in various ways from automated and manual analysis and reviewer bids     [ref]18  .
