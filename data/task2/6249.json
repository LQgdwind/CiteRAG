      "content": "Paper Title: Latent Exploration for Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEffectively exploring the environment while learning the policy is key to the success of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Typically, exploration is attained by using a non-deterministic policy to collect experience, so that the random component of the action selection process allows the agent to visit states that would have not been reached with a deterministic policy. In on-policy algorithms, such as A3C  and PPO , the policy network parametrizes a probability distribution, usually an independent multivariate Gaussian, from which actions are sampled. In off-policy algorithms, such as DQN , DDPG [ref]4 and SAC [ref]5, the policy used to collect experience can be different from the one learned to maximize the cumulative reward, which leaves more freedom in the selection of an exploration strategy. The standard approach in off-policy RL consists in perturbing the policy by introducing randomness (e.g., ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-greedy exploration in environments with a discrete action space and Gaussian noise in environments with a continuous action space). In the past years, many notable successes of RL are based on independent noise   [ref]4  . However, previous work has challenged the inefficiency of unstructured exploration by focusing on introducing temporal correlations  [ref]4  0 1. Indeed, two opposite perturbations of subsequent actions might cancel out the deviation from the maximum probability trajectory defined by the policy, effectively hiding potentially better actions if followed by a more coherent policy. Here, we argue that not only correlation in time [ref]4  0 1 , but also correlation across actuators, can improve noise-driven exploration. In motor control, precise coordination between actuators is crucial for the execution of complex behaviors 2 3 4 5. Perturbing each actuator independently can disrupt such coordination, limiting the probability of discovering improvements to the current policy. In particular,\nmusculoskeletal systems 6 7 8 9 typically feature a larger number of actuators (muscles) than degrees of freedom (joints). Here, we demonstrate that in such systems the exploration achieved by uncorrelated actuator noise is suboptimal. To tackle this problem, we introduce an exploration strategy, named LATent TIme-Correlated Exploration (Lattice). Lattice takes advantage of the synergies between actuators learned by the policy network to perturb the different action components in a structured way. This is achieved by applying independent noise to the latent state of the policy network (Fig. 1 A). With extensive experiments, we show that Lattice can replace standard unstructured exploration  [ref]5 and time-only-correlated exploration (gSDE)  in off-policy (SAC) and on-policy (PPO) RL algorithms, and improve performance in complex motor control tasks. Importantly, we demonstrate that Lattice-SAC is competitive in standard benchmarks for continuous control, such as the locomotion environments of PyBullet 0. In the Humanoid locomotion task, Lattice improves training efficiency, final performance and energy consumption. In the complex object manipulation tasks of the MyoSuite library 8, involving the control of a realistic musculoskeletal model of the human hand, Lattice-PPO achieves higher reward, while also finding more energy-efficient policies than standard PPO. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to showcase the potential of modeling the action distribution of a policy network with a multivariate Gaussian distribution with full covariance matrix induced by the policy network weights, rather than a diagonal covariance matrix.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: A3C  and PPO , the policy network parametrizes a probability distribution, usually an independent multivariate Gaussian, from which actions are sampled.
