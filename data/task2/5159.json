      "content": "Paper Title: SGCE-Font: Skeleton Guided Channel Expansion for Chinese Font Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA. Datasets.\nWe considered ten datasets with different fonts including three standard printing fonts {Heiti (ht), Fangsong (fs), Zhengkai (zk)}, the handwriting (hw) font, three pseudo-handwriting fonts {Hupo (hp), Shuti (st), Lishu (ls)}, and three calligraphy fonts {Huangcao (hc), Zhuxi (zx), SuShi(ss)}. The specific sizes of datasets were presented in Table II and some samples were shown in the left part of Figure 3. The handwriting dataset was randomly collected from the CASIA-HWDB1.1 dataset, the other font datasets were collected by ourselves from the internet. The sizes of the last two calligraphy font datasets, i.e., Zhuxi and SuShi are very small. We use them mainly to show the performance of the proposed model over the few-shot font generation task. For each sample, we reset the image size of each character to 128×128×3. In all experiments, we used 80% and 20% samples as the training and test sets respectively. B. Baselines. In this paper, we considered the following six state-of-the-art models as baselines. CycleGAN : A typical model based on GAN and unpaired data. SQ-GAN [ref]24: An improved CycleGAN model equipped with a square-block geometric transformation based self-supervised learning scheme. StrokeGAN : A refined CycleGAN model incorporated with the one-bit stroke encoding for the Chinese font generation to mitigate the mode collapse. UGATIT : An effective GAN model using unsupervised generative attention network with adaptive layer instance normalization and unpaired data. FUNIT [ref]39: An effective GAN model based on the disentangled representation learning and unpaired data. AttentionGAN : An effective GAN model based on the attention mechanism and unpaired data. Besides the above baselines, we also suggested another model called SkeGAN as a baseline for better comparison with the proposed model. In the SkeGAN, we impose the skeleton information to the discriminator in the similar way of StrokeGAN . C. Network structures.\nThe network structure of the generator of SGCE-Font is almost the same as that of CycleGAN , including 2 convolutional layers in the down-sampling module, 9 residual modules with 2 convolutional layers of residual networks for each residual module, and 2 deconvolutional layers in the up-sampling module, except that the input of the generator was modified from 3 channels to 4 channels. The network structure of the discriminator of SGCE-Font is the same as CycleGAN , with 6 hidden convolutional layers and 2 convolutional layers in the output module. Moreover, batch normalization  was used in all layers. We used the popular Adam algorithm  as the optimizer with the associated parameters (0.5, 0.999) in both the generator and discriminator optimization subproblems. The hyperparameters of the cycle consistency loss and skeleton consistency loss were empirically set as 1 and 0.001, respectively. D. Evaluation metrics.\nWe used four important evaluation metrics to measure the performance. The first two evaluation metrics were the commonly used SSIM (Structural Similarity) [ref]43 and PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio), which were employed to measure how the pixel-level details are preserved. The third evaluation metric is the well-known MSE (Mean Square Error). The last evaluation metric is FID (Frechet Inception Distance) , which was used to measure how the generated results of the model match the distribution of real data. Larger SSIM and PSNR values, and smaller MSE and FID values generally imply better generation performance.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: and test sets respectively.
