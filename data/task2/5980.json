      "content": "Paper Title: What Makes a Good Dataset for Symbol Description Reading?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe task of mathematical identifier description reading (MIDR) involves\nextracting or generating descriptions of a formula’s identifiers from\nunstructured text like Wikipedia articles or scientific publications.\nPractical applications of the MIDR task include\nmath information retrieval  ,\naccessibility of mathematical content to the visually impaired ,\nautomated feature engineering [ref]4 and document understanding . As an example of the MIDR task consider the mass-energy equivalence equation\nand its textual context extracted from a Wikipedia article (Figure 1).\nThe formula E=m​c2𝐸𝑚superscript𝑐2E=m\\,c^{2} includes three identifiers: E𝐸E, m𝑚m, and c𝑐c. The text below the\nformula defines E𝐸E as the energy of a particle in its rest frame, m𝑚m\nas mass, and c𝑐c as the speed of light. The objective of the\nMIDR task is to (automatically) extract these definitions from the article. The MIDR task can be thought of as both a form of anaphoric resolution and\nreading comprehension. Mathematical identifiers, like pronouns acquire meaning from their context. Both identifiers and pronouns can\nhave several distinct meanings within a single\ndocument . Unlike pronouns, identifiers are often\nexplicitly defined. However, these descriptions do not always appear as well\ndefined contiguous excerpts in the source document; Figure\n1 is a straightforward example. Thus extractive techniques alone are not sufficient for tackling the MIDR task. Moreover, there are usually multiple occurrences of an\nidentifier, such as the constant π𝜋\\pi, in an article , but its description may only be provided once or even not at all [ref]7.\nRecognizing identifier descriptions that either occur implicitly or are missing, poses challenges for the MIDR task.\nFurther, most of today’s state of the art approaches for NLP tasks are based on the fine-tuning of pretrained large language models . However, the performance of language models\ntrained solely on natural language text degrades when used with a mixture of\nmathematical objects and natural language . We believe that the availability of a relevant high quality dataset can unlock further progress in the MIDR task.\nThe creation of quality datasets has played a significant role in machine learning progress across many fields such as computer vision 0 and natural language processing 1 2. Even in the era of foundation models and self-supervised training on a massive scale, high quality human supervision can dramatically improve model performance 3 With this paper, we aim to advance the state of the art for the MIDR task by contributing\na new dataset for validating performance on the task. We also provide a variation of the SOTA noun phrase ranking approach. In presenting this work, we\nfirst give our views on the important characteristics of a dataset for training MIDR models\n(Section 2).\nA review of existing datasets and approaches appears in (Section 3).\nNext, we describe the development of the Math Formula Question Answering Dataset (MFQuAD), consisting of over 750075007500 annotated identifier occurrences.\nWe then analyze MFQuAD on its own and in comparison to related data sets in Section 5. Benchmark experimental results appear in Section 6. Conclusions and a discussion of future research directions are provided in\nSection 7.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: scientific publications.\nPractical applications of the MIDR task include\nmath information retrieval  ,\naccessibility of mathematical content to the visually impaired ,\nautomated feature engineering [ref]4 and document understanding . As an example of the MIDR task consider the mass-energy equivalence equation\nand its textual context extracted from a Wikipedia article (Figure 1).\nThe formula\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
