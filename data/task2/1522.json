      "content": "Paper Title: mt5se: An Open Source Framework for Building Autonomous Trading Robots\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe financial environment is very challenging for autonomous software, however, there are also some promising technologies and some subtle advantages in autonomous traders. In fact, many financial institutions are using autonomous traders as part of the decision process and also trading real portfolios. Nevertheless, there is a long road ahead in the path to build autonomous traders that can beat the best human experts in a consistent way. One aspect that we believe may be a fundamental advantage for autonomous traders is accountability. Especially regarding eliciting possible conflict of interests. It is well known that there are possible conflicts of interest among analysts, managers and investors. One common conflict of interest may happen among managers and stockholders  (pg.12). The conflicts of interest among analysts and investors, may take place when analysts have investments on target assets themselves or are contracted by securities emitters. In fact, SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) has\na long history of examining potential conflicts of interests among such roles, for more information see  and . Due to the fact that machine can have controlled or at least formally verifiable interests through software verification and validation, possible conflict of interests can be avoided or at very least controlled in a more efficient way. On the other hand, the use of autonomous traders require that trust can be established in its development, deployment, and operation. It is a challenge faced by AI in many scenarios and it is not different in autonomous traders. The concept of trustworthy artificial intelligence has five foundational principles according to : (1) beneficence, (2) non-maleficence, (3) autonomy, (4) justice, and (5) explicability. One may argue that accountability is strongly related to the first two principles. Autonomy refers in large extent on the promotion of human oversight (e.g., Guidelines), others also consider the restriction of AI-based systems’ autonomy, where humans retaining the right to decide when to decide at any given time. The justice principle is not to be understood judicially, as in adhering to laws and regulations, but instead in an ethical way. For instance, the utilization of AI should to amend past inequities like discrimination of any kind. The last principle, explicability is without any doubt, critical and challenging for autonomous traders, because given the environment complexity mistakes will happen and the ability to explain and justify past decisions is crucial, in order to build and keep trust in the system. When reasoning about autonomous investments one may ask What would happen if autonomous investment analysts or managers become ubiquitous. We believe the scenario described by Fama in his Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) [ref]7 would take place. The EMH states that financial markets are efficient in pricing assets. Asset prices would reflect all information publicly available and the collective beliefs of all investors over the foreseeable future. Thus, it would not be possible to overcome the performance of the market, using information that is known by the market, except by simple chance. We have discussed the financial environment complexity in section II. In fact, it is a challenging environment not just for autonomous agents, but also for human experts. Some argue that it would be beyond the limits of algorithms. As stated by Marks, ”Valid approaches work some of the time but not all. And investing can’t be reduced to an algorithm and turned over to a computer. Even the best investors don’t get it right every time.” . In other words, Marks point to the fact that the environment is not stationary and circumstances rarely repeat exactly. Furthermore, Marks recognizes that psychology plays a major role in financial markets. We believe that true autonomous trader should some how try to model and reason about market psychological aspects. There are some initiatives aiming to walk towards software and hardware that can mimic processes that exist within the human brain, such as intuition and emotional memory concepts  and . However, there are more questions then answer about how to model and emotions in autonomous agents and certainly it is a topic that requires further research. Recent work point to some promising technologies, specially regarding the use of convolutional neural networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) ; reinforcement learning  [ref]54, specially when used deep learning architectures   and ensemble methods   . For a comprehensive review of recent work in autonomous analysts, we suggest . There are significant research work in autonomous agents focused on trading with cryptocurrencies, this paper  provides a good review about the theme.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: investments one may ask What would happen if autonomous investment analysts or managers become ubiquitous.
