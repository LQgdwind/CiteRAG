      "content": "Paper Title: Source-free Domain Adaptive Human Pose Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHuman Pose Estimation. The heatmap-based method   is currently a widely used technique in 2D HPE, which involves generating heatmaps by placing 2D Gaussian kernels on potential keypoints, followed by converting these heatmaps to coordinates. For instance, [ref]3 uses global- and refine-nets, while  simplifies the network structures through the Simple Baselines technique. Some approaches have focused on utilizing features at different scales , while others aim to improve the quality of heatmaps by extending Gaussians to second order  or using coupled embeddings for heatmap regression . In this study, we adopt the same heatmap-based HPE methods as other domain adaptive HPE works 2 . General Domain Adaptation. There are two main categories of methods for achieving general domain adaptation, which requires access to both the source and target data during adaptation. The first category is metric-based methods that explicitly measure the discrepancy between the source and target domains. For example,  uses maximum mean discrepancy, and  applies deep domain confusion. Recent work, such as , jointly performs clustering and discrimination for alignment using contrastive learning  . The second category is GAN-based  methods that build a min-max game for two players related to the source and target domains. For example,  8 adopts domain confusion to confuse the two players, while  7 shows that discriminative clustering on the target benefits adaptation. However, access to source data is required in the general domain adaptation setting, which raises concerns about data privacy and security.  Source-Free Domain Adaptation. Source-Free has become the mainstream paradigm for alleviating concerns about data privacy and security in domain adaptation, as shown in the work of 0 1 6. There are two technique routes under the source-free setting: self-supervision and virtual source transfer. For the self-supervised methods, 1 is the most representative, which introduces information maximization to assist adaptation. Other self-supervised methods include , which treats the problem from a discriminative perspective, and  6, which proposes online pseudo label refinement. In virtual source methods, most build GANs to generate virtual source data. Examples include conditional GANs used in 8, and collaborative GANs in 0, which achieve better generations. However, most source-free DA methods for classification are not applicable to HPE tasks due to the sparsity of keypointsâ€™ distributions. Domain Adaptive Human Pose Estimation. There are two main categories of methods used for domain-adaptive HPE. The first category involves a shared structure, where the weights of the networks from both the source pretrain and target adaptation are shared. CC-SSL 5 employs a single end-to-end trained network, RegDA 2 utilizes one shared feature extractor and two separate regressors, and TransPar  emphasizes transferable parameters using a similar structure. The second category is the unshared structure, where the pretrain and adaptation create a teacher-student paradigm. In this category, MDAM 9 addresses this structure alongside a novel pseudo-label strategy, UniFrame  modifies the classic Mean-Teacher  model by combining it with style transfer 0, and MarsDA 4 applies a teacher-student approach to edit RegDA.\nHowever, all these existing domain adaptive HPE approaches are not source-free, which raises concerns about data privacy and security. Therefore, it is necessary to consider source-free domain adaptive HPE. To our knowledge, we are the first work to study this challenging problem.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: a widely used technique in 2D HPE, which involves generating heatmaps by placing 2D Gaussian kernels on potential keypoints, followed by converting these heatmaps to coordinates.
