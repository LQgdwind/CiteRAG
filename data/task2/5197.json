      "content": "Paper Title: Optimizing Explanations by Network Canonization and Hyperparameter Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile various XAI methods have been developed, the quantitative evaluation thereof is often neglected and explanations of XAI methods are often only compared by visually inspecting heatmaps.\nTo address this issue, many XAI metrics have been introduced in recent years¬†7 .\nHowever, there is no consensus on which metric to use and moreover, each metric evaluates explanations from different viewpoints, partly with contradictory objectives.\nBroadly speaking, XAI metrics can be categorized into five classes: Faithfulness metrics measure whether an explanations truly represents features used by the model. For instance, Pixel Flipping¬† measures the difference in output scores of the correct class, when replacing pixels in descending order of their relevance scores with a baseline value (e.g., black pixel or mean pixel). If the score decreases quickly, i.e., after replacing only a few highly relevant pixels, the explanation is considered as highly faithful.\nRegion Perturbation¬† further generalizes Pixel Flipping by replacing input regions instead of single pixels. Faithfulness correlation¬†[ref]7 replaces a random subset of attribution with a baseline value and measures the correlation between the sum of attributions in the subset and the difference in model output.\nRobustness metrics measure the robustness of explanations towards small changes in the input. Prominent examples are Max-Sensitivity and Avg-Sensitivity¬†, which use Monte Carlo sampling to measure the maximum and average sensitivity of an explanation for a given XAI method.\nLocalization metrics measure how well an explanation localizes the object of interest for the underlying task.\nConsequently, in addition to the input sample and an explanation function, ground-truth localization annotations are required. Examples for localization metrics are Relevance Rank Accuracy (RRA) and Relevance Mass Accuracy (RMA)¬†.\nRRA measures the fraction of high-intensity relevances within the (binary) ground truth mask as RRA=|Ptop-K‚à©G‚ÄãT||G‚ÄãT|RRAsubscriptùëÉtop-Kùê∫ùëáùê∫ùëá\\text{RRA}=\\frac{|P_{\\text{top-K}}\\cap GT|}{|GT|}, where G‚ÄãTùê∫ùëáGT is the ground truth, KùêæK is the size of the ground truth mask and Ptop-KsubscriptùëÉtop-KP_{\\text{top-K}} is the set of pixels sorted by relevance in decreasing order.\nSimilarly, RMA measures the fraction of the total relevance mass within the ground truth mask and can be computed as RMA=RwithinRtotalRMAsubscriptùëÖwithinsubscriptùëÖtotal\\text{RMA}=\\frac{R_{\\text{within}}}{R_{\\text{total}}} where RwithinsubscriptùëÖwithinR_{\\text{within}} is the sum of relevance scores for pixels within the ground truth mask and RtotalsubscriptùëÖtotalR_{\\text{total}} is the sum of all relevance scores.\nComplexity metrics measure how concise explanations are. For example, the authors of¬†1 use the Gini Index of the total attribution vector to measure it‚Äôs sparseness, while¬†[ref]7 propose an entropy-derived measure.\nRandomization metrics measure by how much explanations change when randomizing model components.\nFor instance, the random logit test¬†0 measures the distance between the original explanation and the explanation with respect to a random other class.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: pixels, the explanation is considered as highly faithful.\nRegion Perturbation¬† further generalizes Pixel Flipping by replacing input regions instead of single pixels. Faithfulness correlation¬†[ref]7 replaces a random subset of attribution with a baseline value and measures the correlation between the sum of attributions in the subset and the difference in model output.\nRobustness metrics\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
