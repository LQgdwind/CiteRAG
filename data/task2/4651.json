Relevance: the conditional distribution ℙ​(x|z)ℙconditional𝑥𝑧\\mathbb{P}(x|z) of X𝑋X given Z=z𝑍𝑧Z=z is not constant in z𝑧z. Exclusion: Z𝑍Z does not play a role in the expectation of (1), i.e., Z⊥Y|(X,E)bottom𝑍conditional𝑌𝑋𝐸Z\\bot Y|(X,E). Unconfoundedness: Z𝑍Z is independent of the confounder E𝐸E, i.e., Z⊥Ebottom𝑍𝐸Z\\bot E. The causal graph (Figure 2) with instrumental variables illustrates these conditions clearly.\nThe relevance condition means Z𝑍Z should have a direct causal effect on X𝑋X.\nThe instrumental variables Z𝑍Z, also called proxy variables, should reflect some information of X𝑋X.\nThe exclusion condition requires that given X𝑋X and E𝐸E, Y𝑌Y and Z𝑍Z are independent.\nThis condition indicates that Z𝑍Z should not have a direct causal effect on Y𝑌Y; otherwise, Z𝑍Z would bring a new confounded factor into X𝑋X and Y𝑌Y.\nThe unconfoundedness condition demonstrates that Z𝑍Z is not affected by unobserved confounder E𝐸E,\nso we can utilize this property to elegantly eliminate the influences of E𝐸E on estimation bias.\nUnder the additive error assumption made in (1),\nunconfoundedness of the instrumental variables is unnecessary: we could replace this assumption with the weaker mean independence assumption 𝔼​[E|Z]=0𝔼delimited-[]conditional𝐸𝑍0\\mathbb{E}[E|Z]=0 without changing anything. As Figure 2 depicts,\na variation in X𝑋X comes from both E𝐸E and Z𝑍Z.\nIntuitively speaking, the external source of variation from Z𝑍Z can help improve an estimation by removing the effect of E𝐸E on X𝑋X.\nThe followings are two examples concerning instrumental variables in literature.\n(1) In an air-travel demand example in  [ref]46,\nX,Y𝑋𝑌X,Y are the price and the sales, respectively.\nThere is a big “conference” E𝐸E, unobserved to the decision-maker, which drives demand and price.\nThe instrumental variable Z𝑍Z is the cost of fuel which influences sales only by price.\n(2) In a demand design example in  [ref]46,\nX,Y𝑋𝑌X,Y are the price and the sales, respectively.\nThe price and the sales are confounded by the customer sentiment E𝐸E.\nThe customer sentiment is observable to some degree but very hard to quantify.\nThe instrumental variable Z𝑍Z is a supply cost shifter. After introducing the instrumental variables, we can correctly identify the true structural function.\nTaking expectation on both sides of (1) conditioning on Z𝑍Z yields the following equality: Under the relevance assumption, we can approximate this equation to obtain an unbiased estimator f^^𝑓\\hat{f} for f𝑓f,\nbecause X,Y,Z𝑋𝑌𝑍X,Y,Z are all observable.\nIn the bandit setting, we assume that the learner can observe an extra instrumental variable ztsubscript𝑧𝑡z_{t} at each round,\nand that the tuple (ct,zt)subscript𝑐𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡(c_{t},z_{t}) is i.i.d. generated according to Figure 2.\nAt round t𝑡t, the learner chooses an arm at∈𝒜subscript𝑎𝑡𝒜a_{t}\\in\\mathcal{A} based on historical information ℱt−1subscriptℱ𝑡1\\mathcal{F}_{t-1},\nand observe a reward ytsubscript𝑦𝑡y_{t}.\nWe extend the natural filtration to ℱt=σ​({ai,ci,yi,zi}i=1t)subscriptℱ𝑡𝜎superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑐𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖subscript𝑧𝑖𝑖1𝑡\\mathcal{F}_{t}=\\sigma(\\{a_{i},c_{i},y_{i},z_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{t})\nby adding the information generated by the instrumental variable Z𝑍Z. The consistent estimation of the structural functions involves two stages of nonparametric regressions.\nMany papers [ref]46   propose elegant and novel methods to perform nonparametric regression targeted at instrumental regressions.\nHowever, they make strong smoothness assumptions on the structural functions  1 and conditional probability 0,\nor require sufficiently large dataset as their algorithms suffer from the curse of dimensionality [ref]46 .\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: from Z𝑍Z can help improve an estimation by removing the effect of E𝐸E on X𝑋X.\nThe followings are two examples concerning instrumental variables in literature.\n(1) In an air-travel demand example in  [ref]46,\nX,Y𝑋𝑌X,Y are the price and the sales, respectively.\nThere is a big “conference” E𝐸E, unobserved to the decision-maker, which drives demand and price.\nThe instrumental variable Z𝑍Z is the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
