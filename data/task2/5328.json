All data is provided in full in the results section of this paper.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe last two decades have seen remarkable progress in the classification of subgraph counting problems: Given a small pattern graph H𝐻H and a large host graph G𝐺G, how often does H𝐻H occur as a subgraph if G𝐺G? Since it was discovered that subgraph counts from small patterns reveal global properties of complex networks  , subgraph counting has also found several applications in fields such as biology   genetics , phylogeny 5, and data mining [ref]36. Moreover, the theoretical study of subgraph counting and related problems has led to many deep structural insights, establishing both new algorithmic techniques and tight lower bounds under the lenses of fine-grained and parameterised complexity theory    4   [ref]4. Without any additional restrictions, the subgraph counting problem is infeasible.\nThe complexity class  #​𝖶​#𝖶delimited-[]1\\#\\mathsf{W} is the parameterised complexity class analogous to NP (see Section 2 for more detail). Under standard assumptions,\nproblems that are #​𝖶​#𝖶delimited-[]1\\#\\mathsf{W}-hard are not fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). The canonical complete problem for #​𝖶​#𝖶delimited-[]1\\#\\mathsf{W}, the problem of counting k𝑘k-cliques, corresponds to the\nspecial case of the subgraph counting problem where H𝐻H is a clique of size k𝑘k.\nThis problem cannot be solved in time f​(k)⋅no​(k)⋅𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛𝑜𝑘f(k)\\cdot n^{o(k)} for any function f𝑓f unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails  .\nDue to this hardness result, the research focus in this area shifted to the question: Under which restrictions on the patterns H𝐻H and the hosts G𝐺G is algorithmic progress possible? More precisely, under which restrictions can the problem be solved in time f​(|H|)⋅|G|O​(1)⋅𝑓𝐻superscript𝐺𝑂1f(|H|)\\cdot|G|^{O(1)}, for some computable function f𝑓f? Instances that can be solved within such a run time bound are called fixed-parameter tractable (FPT); allowing a potential super-polynomial overhead in the size of the pattern |H|𝐻|H| formalises the assumption that H𝐻H is assumed to be (significantly) smaller than G𝐺G. If only the patterns are restricted, then the situation is fully understood. Formally, given a class ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} of patterns, the problem #​Sub​(ℋ)#Subℋ\\#\\text{\\sc{Sub}}(\\mathcal{H}) asks, given as input a graph H∈ℋ𝐻ℋH\\in\\mathcal{H} and an arbitrary graph G𝐺G, to compute the number of subgraphs of G𝐺G that are isomorphic to H𝐻H. Following initial work by Flum and Grohe  and by Curticapean 1, Curticapean and Marx 4 proved that, under standard assumptions, #​Sub​(ℋ)#Subℋ\\#\\text{\\sc{Sub}}(\\mathcal{H}) is FPT if and only if ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} has bounded matching number, that is, if there is a positive integer B𝐵B such that the size of any matching in any graph in ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} is at most B𝐵B. They also proved that all FPT cases are polynomial-time solvable. In stark contrast, almost nothing is known for the decision version Sub​(ℋ)Subℋ\\text{\\sc{Sub}}(\\mathcal{H}). Here, the task is to correctly decide whether there is a copy of H∈ℋ𝐻ℋH\\in\\mathcal{H} in G𝐺G, rather than to count the copies. It is known that Sub​(ℋ)Subℋ\\text{\\sc{Sub}}(\\mathcal{H}) is FPT whenever ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} has bounded treewidth (see e.g. [20, Chapter 13]), and it is conjectured that those are all FPT cases. However, resolving this conjecture belongs to the “most infamous” open problems in parameterised complexity theory [18, Chapter 33.1].\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: counts from small patterns reveal global properties of complex networks  , subgraph counting has also found several applications in fields such as biology   genetics , phylogeny 5, and data mining [ref]36.
