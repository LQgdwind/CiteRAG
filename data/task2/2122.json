      "content": "Paper Title: When in Doubt: Neural Non-Parametric Uncertainty Quantification for Epidemic Forecasting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInfectious diseases like seasonal influenza and COVID-19 are major global health issues, affecting millions of people  . Forecasting disease time-series (such as infected cases) at various temporal and spatial resolutions is a non-trivial and important task . Estimating various indicators e.g. future incidence, peak time/intensity and onset, gives policy makers valuable lead time to plan interventions and optimize supply chain decisions, as evidenced by various Centers for Disease Control (CDC) prediction initiatives for diseases like dengue, influenza and COVID-19  [ref]16 0. Statistical approaches  for the forecasting problem are fairly new compared to more traditional mechanistic approaches  . While valuable\nfor ‘what-if’ scenario generation, mechanistic models have several issues in real-time forecasting. For example, they\ncannot easily leverage data from multiple indicators or predict composite signals. In contrast, deep learning approaches in this context\nare a novel direction and have become increasingly promising, as they can ingest numerous data signals without laborious feature\nengineering   [ref]1 . However, there are several\nchallenges in designing such methods, primarily with the need to handle uncertainty to give more reliable forecasts .\nDecision makers need to understand the inherent uncertainty in the forecasts so\nthat they can make robust decisions . Providing\nprobabilistic forecasts and interpreting what signals cause the model uncertain\nis also helpful to better communicate the situation to the public. Due to the\ninherent complexity of the prediction problem, just like weather forecasting,\nso-called ‘point’ forecasts without uncertainty are increasingly seen as not\nvery useful for planning for such high-stake\ndecisions  . Uncertainty quantification in purely statistical epidemic forecasting models is a little explored area. Most traditional methods optimize for accuracy of ‘point-estimates’ only.\nSome approaches that model the underlying generative distribution of the data\nnaturally provide a probability distribution of the outputs\n  4 ,\nbut they do not focus on producing calibrated\ndistributions   as well. Another\nline of research addresses this problem with the use of simple methods such as\nan ensemble of models to build a sample of forecasts/uncertainty\nbounds  . Recent\nattempts for deep learning forecasting models use ad-hoc methods such as\nbootstrap sampling ;\nwhile others disregard this aspect 2 . As a result these can produce wildly wrong\npredictions (especially in novel/atypical scenarios) and can be even confident\nin their mistakes. In time-series analysis, while a large number of deep\nlearning models [ref]1 have been proposed, little work has\nbeen done to quantify uncertainty in their predictions. Bayesian deep\nlearning    (and approximation\nmethods   3) and\ndeep ensembling  are two directions that may\nmitigate this issue, but their applicability and effectiveness are still largely\nlimited by factors such as intractable exact model\ninference  , difficulty of\nspecifying proper parameter priors , and\nuncertainty underestimation  . Neural Process (NP)  and Functional Neural Process\n(FNP)  are recent frameworks developed to\nincorporate stochastic processes with DNNs, but only for static data. Our work aims to close these crucial gaps from both viewpoints. We\npropose a non-parametric model for epi-forecasting by ‘marrying’ deep sequential\nmodels with recent development of neural stochastic processes. Our model,\ncalled EpiFNP, leverages the expressive power of deep sequential models, while\nquantifying uncertainty for epidemic forecasting directly in the functional\nspace. We extend the idea of learning dependencies between data points\n to sequential data, and introduce additional\nlatent representations for both local and global views of input sequences to\nimprove model calibration. We also find that the dependencies learned by\nEpiFNP enable reliable interpretation of the model’s forecasts. Figure 1 shows an example of a well-calibrated forecast due to\nEpiFNP in flu forecasting. CDC is interested in forecasting weighted\nInfluenza-like-illness (wILI) counts, where ILI is defined\nas “fever and a cough and/or a sore throat without a known cause other than\nflu. Figure 1 (a) shows the\nhistorical ILI data with abnormal seasons highlighted; Figure (b) shows how our\nmethod EpiFNP, in contrast to others, is able to react well to a particularly\nnovel event (in this case, introduction of a symptomatically similar COVID-19\ndisease), giving both accurate and well-calibrated forecasts. Our main contributions are:\n∙∙\\bullet Probabilistic Deep Generative Model: We design a neural Gaussian processes model for epidemic forecasting,\nwhich automatically learns stochastic correlations between query sequences and\nhistorical data sequences for non-parametic uncertainty quantification.\n∙∙\\bullet Calibration and Explainability: EpiFNP models the output forecast\ndistribution based on similarity between the current season and the historical seasons in a latent space. We introduce additional latent variables to capture global information of historical seasons and local views of sequences, and show that this leads to better-calibrated forecasts. Further, the\nrelations learned between the current season and similar patterns from\nprevious seasons enable explaining the\npredictions of EpiFNP.\n∙∙\\bullet Empirical analysis of accurate well-calibrated\nforecasting: We perform rigorous benchmarking on flu forecasting and show\nthat EpiFNP significantly outperforms strong baselines, providing up to\n2.5x more accurate and 2.4x better calibrated forecasts. We also\nuse outlier seasons to show the uncertainty in EpiFNP makes it adapt well to\nunseen patterns compared with baselines.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: time to plan interventions and optimize supply chain decisions, as evidenced by various Centers for Disease Control (CDC) prediction initiatives for diseases like dengue, influenza and COVID-19  [ref]16 0.
