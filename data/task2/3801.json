      "content": "Paper Title: Dress Code: High-Resolution Multi-Category Virtual Try-On\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe first popular image-based virtual try-on model  builds upon a coarse-to-fine network. First, it predicts a coarse image of the reference person wearing the try-on garment, then it refines the texture and shape of the previously obtained result. Wang et al.  overcame the lack of shape-context precision (i.e. bad alignment between clothes and body shape) and proposed a geometric transformation module to learn the parameters of a thin-plate spline transformation to warp the input garment. Following this work, many different solutions were proposed to enhance the geometric transformation of the try-on garment. For instance, Liu et al.  integrated a multi-scale patch adversarial loss to increase the realism in the warping phase. Minar et al.  and Yang et al. 2 proposed different regularization techniques to stabilize the warping process during training. Instead, other works  [ref]24 focused on the design of additional projections of the input garment to preserve details and textures of input clothing items. Another line of work focuses on the improvement of the generation phase of final try-on images   [ref]9   . Among them, Issenuth et al.  introduced a teacher-student approach: the teacher learns to generate the try-on results using image pairs (sampled from a paired dataset) and then teaches the student how to deal with unpaired data. This paradigm was further improved in  with a student-tutor-teacher architecture where the network is trained in a parser-free way, exploiting both the tutor guidance and the teacher supervision. On a different line, Ge et al. [ref]9 presented a self-supervised trainable network to reframe the virtual try-on task as clothes warping, skin synthesis, and image composition using a cycle-consistent framework. A third direction of research estimates the person semantic layout to improve the visual quality of generated images   2 5. In this context, Jandial et al.  proposed to generate a conditional segmentation mask to handle occlusions and complex body poses effectively. Very recently, Chen et al.  introduced a new scenario where the try-on results are synthesized in sequential poses with spatio-temporal smoothness. Using a recurrent approach, Cui et al.  designed a person generation framework for pose transfer, virtual try-on, and other fashion-related tasks.\nWhile almost all these methods generate low-resolution results, a limited subset of works focuses on the generation of higher-resolution images instead. Unfortunately, these works employ non-public datasets to train and test the proposed architectures [ref]24 3.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: to increase the realism in the warping phase.
