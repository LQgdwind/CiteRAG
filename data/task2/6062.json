      "content": "Paper Title: Evaluating the Stability of Semantic Concept Representations in CNNs for Robust Explainability\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are two primary paradigms in supervised CA methods: scalar-concept representation [ref]25   and vector-concept representation  [ref]10 [ref]23.\nScalar concept representations refer to disentangled deep neural network (DNN) layer representations with a one-to-one correspondence between neurons and distinct semantic concepts.\nA prominent example and base work are Concept Bottleneck Models [ref]25 (CBM). These introduce an interpretable bottleneck layer to DNNs by assigning each neuron to a specific concept, i.e., scalar-concepts. An extension CBM-AUC , enhances the model’s capability by automatically learning unsupervised concepts (AUC) that describe the residual variance of the feature space.\nIn contrast to the previous examples, Concept Whitening  is a post-hoc approach towards scalar-concepts. It transforms a feature space of a layer and reduces redundancy between neurons, making it more likely for each neuron to correspond to a single concept.\nIIN  is another post-hoc approach that trains an invertible neural network to map a layer output to a disentangled version, using pairwise labels.\nHowever, standard CNNs are typically highly entangled . Hence, such scalar-concept approaches have to enforce the disentangled structure during training or utilize potentially non-faithful proxies . Furthermore, they are limited to explaining a single layer. Vector-concepts, on the other hand, associate a concept with a vector in the latent space.\nThe base work in this direction still disregarded the distributed nature of CNN representations: The Network Dissection approach  aims to associate each convolutional filter in a CNN with a semantic concept. Its successor Net2Vec [ref]10 corrects this issue by associating a concept with a linear combination of filters, resulting in a concept being globally represented by a vector in the feature space, the concept activation vector (CAV) [ref]23. A sibling state-of-the-art method for associating concepts with latent space vectors is TCAV [ref]23, which also uses a linear model attached to a CNN layer to distinguish between neurons (in contrast to filters as in Net2Vec) relevant to a given concept and the rest. TCAV also proposes a gradient-based approach that allows for the evaluation of how sensitive a single prediction or complete class is to a concept. The concept sensitivity (attribution) for a model prediction is calculated by taking the dot product between the concept activation vector and the gradient vector backpropagated for the desired prediction.\nThese vector-concept baselines for classification (TCAV) and segmentation (Net2Vec) of concepts have been extended heavily over the years, amongst others towards regression concepts  , multi-class concepts , and locally linear   and non-linear  CAV retrieval. However, the core idea remained untouched. While the TCAV paper already identifies stability as a potential issue, they reside to significance tests for large series of experiments leaving a thorough analysis of stability (both for concept retrieval and concept attribution) open, as well as investigation of improvement measures. Successor works tried to stabilize the concept attribution measurement. For example, Pfau et al. 0 do not use the gradient directly, but the average change of the output when perturbing the intermediate output towards the CAV direction in latent space in different degrees. This gradient stabilization approach follows the idea of Integrated Gradients , but no other approaches like Smoothed Gradients  have been tried.\nOther approaches also suggest improved metrics for global concept attribution . However,\nto our knowledge,\nstability remained unexplored so far. We address this gap by utilizing TCAV as a baseline global concept vector representation for the stability estimation. Moreover, as gradient-based method, it be adapted to estimate concept attributions in other model types, such as ODs (see Sec. 3.2). It is important to note that our stability assessment method is not limited to TCAV and can potentially be applied to evaluate the stability of other global concept representations.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: There are two primary paradigms in supervised CA methods: scalar-concept representation [ref]25   and vector-concept representation  [ref]10 [ref]23.\nScalar concept representations refer to disentangled deep neural network (DNN) layer representations with a one-to-one correspondence\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
