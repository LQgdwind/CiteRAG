      "content": "Paper Title: VinVL: Revisiting Visual Representations in Vision-Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are two sub-tasks: image retrieval and text retrieval, depending on which modality is used as the retrieved target. Both tasks calculate a similarity score between an image and a sentence, which heavily relies on the cross-modal representations. Following Oscar¬†[ref]21, we formulate the retrieval as a binary classification problem, where given an aligned image-text pair, we randomly select a different image or a different sentence to form an unaligned pair. The final representation of [ùô≤ùôªùöÇ]delimited-[]ùô≤ùôªùöÇ\\mathtt{[CLS]} is used as the input to the classifier to predict whether the given pair is aligned or not.\nIn the testing stage, the probability score is used to rank the given image-text pairs of a query. Following¬†[ref]19, we report the top-KùêæK retrieval results on both the 111K and 555K COCO test sets.\nWe adopt the widely used Karpathy split¬† on the COCO caption dataset¬† to conduct our experiments. Specifically, the dataset consists of 113,287113287113,287 images for training, 5,00050005,000 images for validation, and 5,00050005,000 images for testing. Each image is associated with 555 human-generated captions. For the Oscar+BB{}_{\\text{B}} model, we fine-tune with a batch size of 256256256 for 404040 epochs. The initial learning rate is set to 2‚Äãe‚àí52superscriptùëí52e^{-5} and linearly decreases. For the Oscar+LL{}_{\\text{L}} model, we fine-tune with a batch size of 128128128 for 404040 epochs. The initial learning rate is set to 1‚Äãe‚àí51superscriptùëí51e^{-5} and linearly decreases. We use the validation set for parameter tuning.\nWe compare with several existing methods, including\nDVSA¬†,\nVSE++¬†,\nDPC¬†4,\nCAMP¬†,\nSCAN¬†,\nSCG¬†,\nPFAN¬†,\nUnicoder-VL¬†[ref]19,\n12-in-1¬†,\nUNITER¬†.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: on which modality is used as the retrieved target. Both tasks calculate a similarity score between an image and a sentence, which heavily relies on the cross-modal representations. Following Oscar¬†[ref]21, we formulate the retrieval as a binary classification problem, where given an aligned image-text pair, we randomly select a different image or a different sentence to form an unaligned pair.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. Generate exactly 40 titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning."
