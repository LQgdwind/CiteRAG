      "content": "Paper Title: WaveTransform: Crafting Adversarial Examples via Input Decomposition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFinally, we evaluate the transferability and resiliency of the proposed attack on multiple databases. Transferability: In the real-world settings, the attacker might not know the target CNN model, which he/she wants to fool. In such a scenario, to make the attack more practical, it is necessary to evaluate its effectiveness with an unseen testing network - the adversarial images generated using one model are used to fool another unseen model. The scenario refers to ‘black-box’ setting in adversarial attack literature [ref]4 where an attacker does not have access to the target model. The experiments are performed on the CIFAR-10 8 and Multi-PIE 3 databases. For CIFAR-10 8, two state-of-the-art CNN models are used, i.e., ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121, and the results are summarized in Fig. 6. The ResNet model yields 94.3894.3894.38% accuracy on clean images of CIFAR-10 8; on the other hand, DenseNet gives 94.7694.7694.76% classification accuracy. When the adversarial images generated using the ResNet model are used for classification, the performance of the DenseNet model reduces to 46.9446.9446.94%. Similar performance reduction can be observed on the performance of the ResNet model when the adversarial images generated using the DenseNet model are used. The adversarial images generated by perturbing all the high-frequency wavelet bands reduce the classification accuracy up to 51.3651.3651.36%. The sensitivity of the network against the unseen attack generated models shows the practicality of the proposed attack. Other than that, when adversarial examples are generated using the ResNet on Multi-PIE 3 and used for classification by InceptionNet , the performance of the network reduces by 26.7726.7726.77%. The perturbation of low-frequency components hurts the performance most in comparison to the modification of high-frequency components. The highest reduction in accuracy across the unseen testing network is observed when both low and high-frequency components are perturbed. WaveTransform works by corrupting low frequency and high frequency information contained in the image. It is well understood that the low frequency information corresponds to the high level features learned in the deeper layers of the network  . Moosavi-Dezfooli et al.  have shown that the high level features learned by different models tend to be similar. We assert that since the proposed method perturbs low frequency information that is used across models, it shows good transferability. Adversarial Resiliency: With the advancement in the adversarial attack domain, researchers have proposed several defense algorithms   6 7 8 . We next evaluate the resiliency of the attack images generated using the proposed WaveTransform against the recently proposed defense algorithm by Wang et al. Original codes provided by the authors are used to perform the experiment.. The concept of the defense algorithm is close to the proposed attack, thus making it a perfect fit for evaluation. The defense algorithm performs smoothing of the CNN neurons at earlier layers to reduce the effect of adversarial noise. Table 3 summarizes the results with the defense algorithm on CIFAR10 and F-MNIST databases. Interestingly, we observe that in the presence of the defense algorithm, the performance of the network is further reduced. We hypothesize that, while the proposed attack is perturbing the frequency components, the kernel smoothing further attenuates the noise and yields a higher fooling rate. This phenomenon can also be seen from the accuracy of clean images. For example, the ResNet model without defense yields 94.3894.3894.38% accuracy on CIFAR-10, which reduces to 91.9291.9291.92% after defense incorporation. The proposed attack can fool the defense algorithm on each database. For example, on the CIFAR-10 database, the proposed attack reduces the accuracy up to 0.160.160.16% and it further reduces to 0.110.110.11% after the defense. Similar resiliency is observed on the F-MNIST database as well. The PGD attack, which shows a similar reduction in the performance on the CIFAR-10 database, is found less resilient against the defense proposed by Wang et al. . The defense algorithm can successfully boost the recognition performance of ResNet-50 by 303030%; whereas, the proposed attack is found to be resilient against the defense. The robustness of the proposed attack is also evaluated against state-of-the-art defense methods such as Madry et al.  and Zhang et al.  on the CIFAR-10 database. The defense model presented by Madry et al.  utilizes the ResNet-50 model, which yields 87.0387.0387.03% accuracy on clean images of the database, but the accuracy significantly reduces to 60.8160.8160.81% when the proposed attack is applied. Similarly, the accuracy of the defended WideResNet  model by Zhang et al.  reduces to 62.7362.7362.73% from 84.9284.9284.92%.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: with an unseen testing network - the adversarial images generated using one model are used to fool another unseen model.
