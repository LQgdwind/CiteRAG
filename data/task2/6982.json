      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Comparable Knowledge Distillation in Semantic Image Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKD aims to increase the performance of a compact student model by leveraging guidance from a large teacher model during training. It is one of the most widely used model compression techniques due to its broad applicability . Unlike Model Pruning or Quantization, KD is model agnostic  as no requirements are imposed on the teacher or student model. Additionally, KD allows leveraging unlabelled data as the teacher can provide soft labels for student training . Generally, the teacher model weights are frozen during student training and the student is encouraged to mimic the teacher‚Äôs output logits by training on a weighted combination of standard cross entropy and KD loss [ref]4  (Eq. 1).\nThe cross entropy term (Eq. 2) ensures performance on the labeled training data while the distillation term (Eq. 3) penalizes deviations from the teacher output. The weight of the distillation loss, ŒªùúÜ\\lambda, is a hyperparameter of student training. Scaling output logits of both models by œÑ>1ùúè1\\tau>1 is crucial for a successfull distillation of knowledge in image classification  and extending the level of student teacher matching to intermediate feature layers can give a further boost [ref]23 . Despite the simplicity of the classical KD framework, the underlying mechanisms are still not well-understood.\nCommonly, the success of KD is associated with the information contained in teacher predictions for wrong classes, referred to as ‚Äùdark knowledge‚Äù 9. However, phenomena such as students outperforming teachers when trained solely on teacher output and high disagreement between student and teacher predictions suggest that there are other explanations for the success of KD .\nTwo alternative explanations are that teacher guidance has a regularizing effect similar to label smoothing 9 and that teacher output provides a sample-wise importance weighting, making the student focus on samples of low teacher confidence .\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: model weights are frozen during student training and the student is encouraged to mimic the teacher‚Äôs output logits by training on a weighted combination of standard cross entropy and KD loss [ref]4  (Eq. 1).\nThe cross entropy term (Eq. 2) ensures performance on the labeled training data while the distillation term (Eq. 3) penalizes deviations from the teacher output.
