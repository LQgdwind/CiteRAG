A large body of neurophysiological work has demonstrated that the hippocampus is sensitive to the geometry of the environment, suggesting that it may support the formation of cognitive maps . Two cell types are of particular interest in this: place cells which fire at unique locations in the environment  and grid cells which fire at multiple locations forming a regular, triangular lattice [ref]22. The former is suggested to enable topological navigation while the latter may provide a spatial metric supporting path integration and vector-based navigation . While there is strong evidence to suggest that the hippocampus is involved in spatial navigation, growing evidence suggests that the representation of location in itself may not be the sole purpose and that the hippocampal formation may instead also support other important functions, such as reward-guided learning [e.g. 4, 5]. Since success in reinforcement learning does not rely on Euclidean distance, but the distance along paths (e.g. around obstacles), efficient reinforcement learning should thus rely on a geodesic rather than a plain Euclidean metric . In a series of simulations,  provide theoretical support for the benefit and empirical evidence of this spatial coding and hypothesise that the firing of place and grid cells may be modulated accordingly. In line with this work, we here additionally speculate that it is not only a purely geodesic metric that is of importance to biological agents, but that additional cognitive costs, which we model by information-theoretical quantities, should also affect computations and hence be supported by the underlying metric. Since the hippocampus is also involved in the representation of information like value  and goals   , or even conceptual spaces [ref]10 7, it appears that activity of cells found in the hippocampal formation may reflect geometrical properties more generally. In this light, it appears not without reason to hypothesise that this brain area may also be a good candidate to probe for its sensitivity to the geometry that arises from a trade-off between value and information as demonstrated in this work.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: cell types are of particular interest in this: place cells which fire at unique locations in the environment  and grid cells which fire at multiple locations forming a regular, triangular lattice [ref]22.
