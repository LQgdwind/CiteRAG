ImagenetAug is a simple manually designed augmentation containing random crop , random horizontal flip and color jitters .\nIt is one of the most commonly used strategy for training ImageNet models  [ref]19. Differentiable Siamese Augmentation (DSA) is a set of augmentation policies designed for improving the data efficiency of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)  [ref]35  [ref]56.\nThe set includes six operations: crop, cutout , flip, scale, rotate, and color jitters.\nAt each iteration, one policy is sampled and applied to the input image.\nDSA is later extended to training synthesized images for dataset condensation . AutoAugment  is a strong and widely adopted augmentation strategy discovered using AutoML.\nThe searched polices contains a total 16 data augmentations from the popular PIL image library, plus two additional operations: cutout and sample pairing .\nAt each iteration, a pair of augmentations are sampled from the whole policy set and applied onto the search.\nIt achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN  and ImageNet (without additional data). RandAugment  is another popular method of automated policy search, with a different set of discovered policies than AutoAugment.\nIn practice, both RandAugment and AutoAugment are commonly used for training image classification models.\nTherefore, we also include RandAugment in our benchmark for a more comprehensive evaluation.\nMetrics summary: Similar to real datasets, synthesis datasets should support various augmentations that are tailored to end users’ tasks. We evaluate both average and best cases, which could fit different user needs.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: ImagenetAug is a simple manually designed augmentation containing random crop , random horizontal flip and color jitters .\nIt is one of the most commonly used strategy for training ImageNet models  [ref]19. Differentiable Siamese Augmentation (DSA) is a set of augmentation policies designed for improving the data efficiency of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)  [ref]35  [ref]56.\nThe set\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
