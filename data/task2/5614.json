This is because graph nodes are mutually dependent. Thus, they can not be arbitrarily divided into smaller subgraphs. Techniques such as neighborhood sampling [ref]39 may ease the problem to some extent. Still, even a sampled computational graph and the associated features may not fit in the memory of a single device [ref]40. Thus, centralized GNN operation faces a scalability limitation [ref]40 [ref]41. To mitigate the scalability limitation of centralized GNNs, decentralized (peer-to-peer) node inference\nhas been applied to a few GNN applications like robot path control   and resource optimization in wireless communication . Decentralization naturally promotes GNNs‚Äô scalability. Still, it requires excessive communication overhead between nodes [ref]40. In turn, this communication delay significantly slows down the operation of a GNN because the progression of calculations across GNN layers needs to wait for a 2-way message passing to deliver messages from LùêøL-hop neighbors. Another disadvantage of decentralized inference is the difficulty of coordinating and synchronizing the operation of all nodes. Another less significant disadvantage is the need for each node to maintain and operate a copy of the GNN model. While the literature considers either centralized or decentralized GNNs, it came to our knowledge while developing this work that there is another work [ref]41 on distributed GNN operation. [ref]41 proposes adaptive node to cloud server assignment minimizing a general cost function with the servers of different computational powers. However, this is done in a centralized manner; a solver needs to know the graphs of nodes and cloud servers to do the assignment. In our work, we optimize the assignment in a distributed manner at the cloudlet level. Also, according to [ref]41, any node may be assigned to any cloud server, while our work focuses on the boundary nodes at each CLN and assigns them to their CLN or an adjacent one taking the geometry into account. Also, while our work focuses on minimizing the communication delay, [ref]41 adopts a general cost function where the challenge is mapping nodes to cloud servers of varying computational capabilities while optimizing the other costs including the delay. It is also noted that [ref]41 does not compare centralized and decentralized GNN implementations or consider their trade-offs.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: huge memory and processing costs.
