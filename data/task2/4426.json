      "content": "Paper Title: The discriminating power of the generalized rank invariant\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnlike in the case of one-parameter persistence modules, there is no complete and discrete invariant for multiparameter persistence modules .\nAccordingly, many discrete and incomplete invariants have been studied, e.g.  [ref]8  8  .\nOne such invariant, is the rank invariant (RI), which captures the rank of all linear maps present in a persistence module  . Given a persistence module MùëÄM over a poset PP\\mathrm{P} (simply called a PP\\mathrm{P}-module), the RI of MùëÄM is the map sending each comparable pair p‚â§qùëùùëûp\\leq q in PP\\mathrm{P} to the rank of the linear map M‚Äã(p‚â§q)ùëÄùëùùëûM(p\\leq q). The recent notion of generalized rank invariant (GRI) acquires more discriminating power than the RI at the expense of enlarging the domain of the RI to the set Int‚Äã(P)IntP\\mathrm{Int}(\\mathrm{P}) of intervals of PP\\mathrm{P} or to the even larger set Con‚Äã(P)ConP\\mathrm{Con}(\\mathrm{P}) of connected subposets of PP\\mathrm{P}.\nFor instance, for persistence modules over ‚Ñ§2superscript‚Ñ§2\\mathbb{Z}^{2}, the RI is a complete invariant on the class of rectangle-decomposable persistence modules [ref]9, whereas the GRI over Int‚Äã(‚Ñ§2)Intsuperscript‚Ñ§2\\mathrm{Int}(\\mathbb{Z}^{2}) or Con‚Äã(‚Ñ§2)Consuperscript‚Ñ§2\\mathrm{Con}(\\mathbb{Z}^{2}) is a complete invariant on the larger class of interval-decomposable persistence modules  4 9. Nevertheless, the size of Int‚Äã(P)IntP\\mathrm{Int}(\\mathrm{P}) and Con‚Äã(P)ConP\\mathrm{Con}(\\mathrm{P}) is much larger than the domain of the RI in general (e.g. [1, Theorem 31]) and thus is a bottleneck to compute the GRI. Therefore, restricting the domain of the GRI to smaller, more manageable subcollections ‚Ñê‚äÇInt‚Äã(P)‚ÑêIntP\\mathcal{I}\\subset\\mathrm{Int}(\\mathrm{P}) is desirable in terms of the computational cost of the GRI. This work studies the tension which exists between computational efficiency and\nstrength when restricting the domain of the GRI to different choices of ‚Ñê‚Ñê\\mathcal{I}.\nAlong the way, several theorems and observations regarding the RI or GRI from the literature are contextualized within the framework of the M√∂bius inversion formula, which enables us to answer some open questions as well as to simplify proofs of known theorems. Lastly, we restrict our attention to ‚Ñ§2superscript‚Ñ§2\\mathbb{Z}^{2}-modules MùëÄM, motivated by a recent theorem that the GRI of MùëÄM can be determined by computing zigzag persistence that is obtained from the restrictions of MùëÄM over certain paths, possibly with repeated vertices\n4. This implies that clarifying the connection between the GRI and zigzag persistence over paths in ‚Ñ§2superscript‚Ñ§2\\mathbb{Z}^{2} is potentially important to understand to what extent zigzag persistence algorithms  3  can be exploited for computing the GRI.\nA priori, there is a possibility that we can restrict the class of zigzag paths in ‚Ñ§2superscript‚Ñ§2\\mathbb{Z}^{2} over which zigzag persistence must be computed to obtain the GRI of MùëÄM. One natural choice is the (sub)class of all simple paths, i.e. paths with no repeated vertices.\nMotivated by this, we elucidate the relationship between the Zigzag-path-Indexed Barcode (ZIB) over simple paths (Definition 6.1) and the GRI over Int‚Äã(‚Ñ§2)Intsuperscript‚Ñ§2\\mathrm{Int}(\\mathbb{Z}^{2}).\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: one-parameter persistence modules, there is no complete and discrete invariant for multiparameter persistence modules .\nAccordingly, many discrete and incomplete invariants have been studied, e.g.  [ref]8  8  .\nOne such invariant, is the rank invariant (RI), which captures the rank of all linear maps present in a persistence module  .
