      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting Test Time Adaptation under Online Evaluation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various tasks¬†[ref]12 thanks to their ability to learn from large datasets¬†.\nHowever, a significant limitation of DNNs is their low performance when tested on out-of-distribution data, which violates the i.i.d. assumption¬† [ref]14  (the training and testing data are from the same distribution).\nSuch failure cases are concerning, since distribution shifts are common in real-world applications, e.g. image corruptions¬†[ref]14, changing weather conditions¬†, or security breaches¬†. Test Time Adaptation (TTA) ¬†   has demonstrated promising results for solving the above problem.\nTTA leverages the unlabeled data that arrives at test time by adapting the forward pass of pre-trained DNNs according to some proxy task¬† .\nThough recent methods have made significant progress at improving accuracy under distribution shifts¬†  [ref]8, many of them incur high computational overhead.\nFor instance, some methods require self-supervised fine-tuning on the data¬†, while others perform a diffusion process per input¬†[ref]8. The computational overhead of TTA methods can decrease their inference speed, which is a critical property in many real-world applications that require the TTA method to produce predictions at the speed of the stream itself.\nThis property, however, is overlooked in the current evaluation protocols for TTA methods.\nIn particular, these protocols assume an offline setting, which neglects how\nevents constantly unfold regardless of the model‚Äôs speed, causing the model to miss incoming samples when it is busy processing previous ones.\nFor TTA methods that adapt using test data, missing samples has a direct effect on the method‚Äôs accuracy, as it will have fewer samples for adaptation.\nThat is, the slower the TTA method, the fewer samples it can leverage for adapting to the distribution shift.\nThus, the current offline protocol for evaluating TTA methods\nis not suitable for assessing their efficacy\nin\nreal-world deployment. In this work, we propose a novel online evaluation protocol that factors in inference speed to assess the real-world applicability of TTA methods.\nOur evaluation protocol is inspired by Online Learning settings¬†  and mimics real-world scenarios by exposing all TTA methods\nto a constant-speed stream of data.\nUnder this setup, the performance of slow TTA methods is intrinsically penalized, as the time spent adapting to a sample implies the method misses other samples that could have been useful for adaptation.\nSpecifically, our protocol dictates that if a method gslowsubscriptùëîslowg_{\\text{slow}} is kùëòk times slower than the stream, then\nit may only use every kthsuperscriptùëòthk^{\\text{th}} sample for adaptation.\nIn contrast, a method gfastsubscriptùëîfastg_{\\text{fast}} that is as fast as the stream is allowed to adapt to every sample.\nFigure 1 shows the effect of evaluating several methods under our online protocol, where slower methods (e.g. SAR¬†) are penalized and faster but simpler methods become better alternatives¬†(e.g. SHOT¬† and AdaBN¬†). We apply our proposed evaluation protocol to benchmark several TTA methods on multiple datasets, and provide a fair assessment of their performance subject to the realistic consequences of slower inference speeds.\nOur experimental results highlight the importance of developing TTA methods that adapt to distribution shifts with minimal impacts on inference speed.\nOur contributions are two-fold: We propose an online evaluation protocol for TTA methods that penalizes slower methods by providing them with fewer samples for adaptation. Our approach is\neffective at assessing\nTTA methods‚Äô efficacy in scenarios where data arrives as a constant-speed stream. Following our proposed protocol, we provide a comprehensive experimental analysis of 15 TTA methods evaluated on 3 large-scale datasets and under 3 different evaluation scenarios.\nThese scenarios consider adaptation to a single domain and continual adaptation to several domains.\nOur analysis shows that, when inference speed is accounted for, simple (but faster) approaches can benefit from adapting to more data, and thus outperform more sophisticated (but slower) methods.\nFigure¬†1 demonstrates this for four TTA methods.\nWe hope our evaluation scheme inspires future TTA methods to consider inference speed as a critical dimension that affects their real-world performance.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various tasks¬†[ref]12 thanks to their ability to learn from large datasets¬†.\nHowever, a significant limitation of DNNs is their low performance when tested on out-of-distribution data, which violates the i.i.d.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
