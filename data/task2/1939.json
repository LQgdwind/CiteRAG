      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Decoupling Attention Markov Networks for Semi-supervised Graph Node Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNode representation learning on graphs aims to extract high-level features from the node and its neighborhood. It has been proved useful for research areas, such as social influence  , knowledge graphs [ref]3 , chemistry and biology , and recommendation systems  .\nRecently, various Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)  [ref]9 0 emerge to solve the node classification problem and achieve state-of-the-art results. Most of them are formulated under the message passing framework 1.\nEach node passes and aggregates messages to/from its neighbors according to edges to achieve information gain and update its embedding 2 3 4. However, the information gain of message passing is not always beneficial in the node classification task, because edges of real-world graphs often connect nodes with different labels. According to 5, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) are regarded as Laplacian smoothers on features. Repeatedly applying the graph convolution operator may smooth the features of the same-label vertices if they are densely connected under the graph structure. Hence the difficulty of the subsequent classification task is significantly reduced.\nHowever, the graph structure can be noisy from many inter-class edges (which connect two nodes with different labels) 4 6.\nIn this case, the graph convolution operator may introduce negative disturbance which arises from neighbors with different labels 4 7 6. The reason is that it smooths the features with different labels and blurs the classification boundary.\nThus, for the node classification task, simply aggregating features\nunder the original graph structure\noften cannot achieve the optimal performance4.\nTaking account of different contributions from the nodes in a graph is important, as not all edges have equal impacts. A wiser solution is to learn the edge weights for message passing in the training stage. \nFurthermore, the labels’ information that influences the aggregation quality, should also be considered in the learning process. One approach to alleviate the negative disturbance is to leverage the attention mechanism 8 4. It learns the aggregation weights of edges\nbased on features\nto choose the critical message and guide the feature propagation [ref]9.\nHowever, current attention mechanisms on graphs suffer from the lack of supervision 9.\nFor example, for citation networks, the weights learned by attention are highly dataset-dependent and degenerated to near-uniform 0.\nBesides, the attention learned using those methods is usually proportional to feature similarity and omits label dependency.\nTo solve these issues, in this paper, we argue that the attention learning on graphs should be decoupled into the structure learning on labels and the edges’ weights learning on features, where more constraints should be applied to learn meaningful attention patterns.\n Based on the previous studies, by conducting validation experiments in Fig. 1, we demonstrate how the graph structure and edge weights affect message passing. We first investigate how the prediction performance varies with the ratio of inter-class edges in the graph structure.\nIn Fig. 1(a), we observe that with the increment of\nthe ratio of inter-class edges, the test accuracy decreases almost monotonically. It confirms that nodes will receive negative information from their inter-class neighbors (whose labels are different from these nodes) for classification tasks.\nHence, message passing between inter-class nodes should be avoided.\nNext, we examine how performance varies with different aggregation weights. Using vanilla GCN as a baseline, we compare two opposite attention mechanisms, i.e., positive relativity attention (PR) and negative relativity attention (NR). The\nPR\nis proportional to cos⁡(𝐱i,𝐱j)subscript𝐱𝑖subscript𝐱𝑗\\cos(\\mathbf{x}_{i},\\mathbf{x}_{j}) and the\nNR\nis proportional to −cos⁡(𝐱i,𝐱j)subscript𝐱𝑖subscript𝐱𝑗-\\cos(\\mathbf{x}_{i},\\mathbf{x}_{j}), where 𝐱i,𝐱jsubscript𝐱𝑖subscript𝐱𝑗\\mathbf{x}_{i},\\mathbf{x}_{j} are the features of nodes i𝑖i and j𝑗j, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1(b), for the results using the oracle adjacency matrix (all inter-class edges are manually removed), NR is evidently better than PR. While using the original adjacency matrix, the trend is reversed, and PR is obviously better than NR. It indicates that NR is more helpful for message passing under the oracle graph because it pays more attention to divergent intra-class neighbors to obtain more information gain. However, when the inter-class connection exists in the original graph, the negative disturbance is more involved for NR and surpasses its benefits due to the natural difference between different classes. Thereby, a more flexible attention model for graph node classification consists of two parts, i.e., a refined graph structure reflecting label similarity (which has fewer inter-class edges)\nand reasonable edge weights (which indicates the aggregation weights for message passing).\nFurthermore, the learning mechanisms of structures and weights are different. To obtain a refined graph structure, we need to use nodes’ label information to reduce the inter-class edges ratio of the graph. With a refined graph at hand, reasonable weights can be effectively learned by features to avoid negative disturbance and enhance the information gain of aggregation. In this work, we consider the label dependency and propose the Graph Decoupling Attention Markov Networks (GDAMNs) to decouple the attention learning on the graph for structure learning and weights learning.\nTo learn a better graph structure, we model the uncertainty of edges with variational inference and use the hard attention mechanism on node labels to encode the graph structure as a latent variable.\nAs in the aforementioned validation experiment, we observe that a better graph structure has fewer inter-class edges. Instead of directly using the pseudo-labels to identify inter-class edges, we treat the distribution of node labels as latent variables and evaluate the pseudo-labels iteratively under the expectation-maximization (EM) framework. Furthermore, we impose a novel graph structure prior based on labels and update it in each EM iteration to assist hard attention learning.\nTo learn better weights, we apply the soft attention mechanism on node features over the refined graph structure. We also propose a mutual information constraint as extra supervision on soft attention learning, in order to learn useful weights and enhance information gain. Moreover, the learned attention guides the label propagation in the M-step and the feature propagation in the E-step. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows: We decouple the attention learning procedure on the graph to a hard attention graph structure learning on labels and a soft attention graph weight learning on features. We propose to learn a better attention pattern with the constraints which assist to maximize information gain. We define a novel latent graph structure prior over the label distribution and utilize variational inference to obtain a better graph structure with fewer inter-class connections. We formulate the proposed method under the EM framework. The better graph structure and aggregation weights learned in M-step label propagation guide the feature propagation of E-step to learn the node representation and inference the pseudo-labels distribution. Extensive experiments are designed and performed to verify the efficiency and superiority of our model and the learned attention. The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly reviews the related methods. Section III introduces the notations and related graph networks. In Section IV, we present the proposed GDAMN method in detail. Evaluation results on six benchmark datasets and ablation studies are presented in Section V to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.
