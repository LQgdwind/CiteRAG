      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring Hierarchical Graph Representation for Large-Scale Zero-Shot Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComparison approaches.\nWe compare with the following approaches: – DeViSE [ref]7 linearly maps visual information to the semantic word-embedding space. The transformation is learned using a hinge ranking loss. – HZSL  learns similarity between the image representation and the class representations in the hyperbolic space. – SGCN 0 uses an asymmetrical normalized graph Laplacian to learn the class representations. – DGP 0 separates adjacency matrix into ancestors and descendants and propagates knowledge in two phases with one additional dense connection layer based on the same graph as in GCNZ [ref]32. – CNZSL  utilizes a simple but effective class normalization strategy to preserve variance during a forward pass. – FREE  incorporates semantic-visual mapping into a unified generative model to address cross-dataset bias. Evaluation Protocols.\nWe use the typical Top@K criterion, but we also introduce additional metrics. Since it could be more desirable to have a relatively general but correct prediction rather than a more specific but wrong prediction, the following three metrics evaluate a given model’s ability to learn the hierarchical relationship between the ground truth and its general classes. Top-Overlap Ratio (TOR). In this metric, we take a further step to also cover all the ancestor nodes of the ground truth class. More concretely, for an image xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j} from class cisubscript𝑐𝑖c_{i} of depth qcisubscript𝑞subscript𝑐𝑖q_{c_{i}}, TOR is defined as: where cisubscript𝑐𝑖c_{i} is the corresponding class to image xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j}. Acisubscript𝐴subscript𝑐𝑖A_{c_{i}} is the union of all the ancestors of class cisubscript𝑐𝑖c_{i} and pxjsubscript𝑝subscript𝑥𝑗p_{x_{j}} is the predicted class of xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j}. In other words, this metric consider the predicted class correct if it is an ancestor of the ground truth. Point-Overlap Ratio (POR).\nIn this setting, we let the model predict labels layer by layer. POR is defined as: where\nPci={ci1,ci2,ci3,⋯,ciqci−1,ci}subscript𝑃subscript𝑐𝑖subscript𝑐subscript𝑖1subscript𝑐subscript𝑖2subscript𝑐subscript𝑖3⋯subscript𝑐subscript𝑖subscript𝑞subscript𝑐𝑖1subscript𝑐𝑖P_{c_{i}}=\\{c_{i_{1}},c_{i_{2}},c_{i_{3}},\\cdots,c_{i_{q_{c_{i}}-1}},c_{i}\\}is the union of classes from the root to the ground truth through all the ancestors, and Pxjsubscript𝑃subscript𝑥𝑗P_{x_{j}} is the union of classes predicted by our model layer by layer.\nqcisubscript𝑞subscript𝑐𝑖q_{c_{i}} is count of all the ancestors including the ground truth label, which is tantamount to the depth of node cisubscript𝑐𝑖c_{i}. The intersection calculates the overlap between correct and predicted points for image xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j}. \n\n\n\n\nMethod\nHit@ 𝐤(%)\\mathbf{k}(\\%)\nTOR\nPOR\n\n1\n2\n5\n10\n20\n\nDevise [ref]7\n1.01.01.0\n1.81.81.8\n3.03.03.0\n151515\n23.823.823.8\n-\n-\n\nHZSL \n3.73.73.7\n5.95.95.9\n10.310.310.3\n13.013.013.0\n16.416.416.4\n-\n-\n\nSGCN(w2v) 0\n2.79\n4.49\n8.26\n13.05\n19.49\n4.97\n10.01\n\nSGCN(Tr) 0\n4.83\n8.17\n14.61\n21.23\n29.42\n8.33\n14.69\n\nDGP(w2v) 0\n3.003.003.00\n5.125.125.12\n9.499.499.49\n14.2814.2814.28\n20.5520.5520.55\n7.07\n11.71\n\nDGP(Tr) 0\n5.78\n9.57\n16.89\n24.09\n32.62\n12.39\n15.50\n\nCNZSL(w2v) \n1.94\n3.17\n5.88\n9.12\n13.73\n3.93\n4.03\n\nCNZSL(Tr) \n5.77\n9.48\n16.49\n23.25\n31.00\n8.32\n7.22\n\nFREE(w2v) \n2.87\n4.91\n9.54\n13.28\n20.36\n4.89\n5.37\n\nFREE(Tr) \n5.76\n9.54\n16.71\n23.65\n31.81\n8.59\n9.68\n\nCLIP \n15.2215.2215.22\n22.5422.5422.54\n33.4333.4333.43\n42.1342.1342.13\n50.9350.9350.93\n18.5518.5518.55\n14.68\n\nHGR-Net(Ours)\n16.3916.39\\mathbf{16.39}\n24.1924.19\\mathbf{24.19}\n35.6635.66\\mathbf{35.66}\n44.6844.68\\mathbf{44.68}\n53.7153.71\\mathbf{53.71}\n18.9018.90\\mathbf{18.90}\n16.1916.19\\mathbf{16.19}\n\n Results analysis.\nTab. 11 demonstrates the performance of different models on ImageNet-21K ZSL setting on Top@K and above-mentioned three hierarchical evaluation.\nOur proposed model outperforms SoTA methods in all metrics, including hierarchical measures, proving the ability to learn the hierarchical relationship between the ground truth and its ancestor classes.
