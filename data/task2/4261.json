Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Research supported by the European Research Council (ERC) consolidator grant No. 725978 SYSTEMATICGRAPH.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs the Metric Dimension problem is \\W-hard when parameterized by the solution size 9, the next natural step is to understand its parameterized complexity under structural parameterizations.\nWe continued this line of research, following the steps of  [ref]31 , and more recently  .\nOur most technical result is a proof that the Metric Dimension problem is \\W-hard when parameterized by the combined parameter feedback vertex set number plus pathwidth of the graph.\nWe thereby improved the result by Bonnet and Purohit  that states the problem is \\W-hard when parameterized by the pathwidth, and answered an open question in 9.\nIt is easy to see that the problem admits an \\FPT algorithm when parameterized by the larger parameter, the vertex cover number of the graph. Although this work advances the understanding of structural parameterizations of Metric Dimension, it falls short of completing the picture (see Figure 1).\nWe find it hard to extend the positive results to the parameters like distance to disjoint paths, feedback edge set, and bandwidth.\nIt would be interesting to find \\FPT algorithms or prove that such algorithms are highly unlikely to exist for these parameters.\nThe \\FPT algorithm parameterized by treedepth in  relies on a meta-result.\nIs it possible to get an \\FPT algorithm whose running time is a single or double exponent in the treedepth?\nIt would also be interesting to investigate the parameterized complexity of the problem when the parameter is the distance to cograph.\nRecall that the problem is polynomial-time solvable in cographs 4. Bonnet and Purohit  conjectured that the problem is \\W-hard even when parameterized by the treewidth plus the solution size.\nTowards resolving this conjecture, an interesting question would be to investigate whether the problem admits an \\FPT algorithm when parameterized by the feedback vertex set number plus the solution size.\nNote that even an \\XP algorithm parameterized by the feedback vertex set number is not apparent.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: by the solution size 9, the next natural step is to understand its parameterized complexity under structural parameterizations.\nWe continued this line of research, following the steps of  [ref]31 , and more recently  .\nOur most technical result is a proof that the Metric Dimension problem is \\W-hard when parameterized by the combined parameter feedback vertex set number plus pathwidth\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
