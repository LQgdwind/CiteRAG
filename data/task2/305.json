      "content": "Paper Title: Combining Geometric and Information-Theoretic Approaches for Multi-Robot Exploration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe study of geometric problems that are based on visibility is a well-established field within computational geometry. The classic problems are the art gallery problem , watchman route problem [ref]12, target search  and shortest path planning  in unknown environments. Using a fixed set of positions for guarding a known n𝑛n-sided polygonal region, i.e., a set of points from which the entire polygon is visible, is known as the classical art gallery problem. Chvatal  and Fisk  proved that ⌊n/3⌋𝑛3\\lfloor n/3\\rfloor guards are always sufficient and sometimes necessary to cover a polygon of n𝑛n sides. The minimum number of guards required for a specific polygon may be much smaller than this upper bound.\nHowever, Schuchardt and Hecker  showed that finding a minimum set of guards is NP-hard, even for the special case of an orthogonal polygon. Finding the shortest tour along which one mobile guard can see the polygon completely is the watchman route problem. Chin and Ntafos [ref]12 showed that the watchman route can be found in polynomial time in a simple orthogonal polygon. Wang et al.  showed that the watchman route problem is for general environments is NP-hard and presented a 𝒪​(polylog​n)𝒪polylog𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\text{polylog}n) approximation for the restricted case when each viewpoint is required to see a complete polygon side. Exploring an unknown polygon is the online watchman route problem. Bhattacharya et al.  and Ghosh et al.  approached the exploration problem with discrete vision, i.e., they assume that the robot does not have continuous visibility and has to stop at different scan points in order to sense the environment. They focus on the worst-case number of necessary scan points. Their algorithm results in a competitive ratio of (r+1)/2𝑟12(r+1)/2, where r𝑟r is the number of reflex vertices in the polygon. For limited range of visibility, they give an algorithm where the competitive ratio in a polygon P𝑃P can be limited by ⌊8​π3+π​R×P​e​r​i​m​e​t​e​r​(P)A​r​e​a​(P)+(r+h+1)​π​R2A​r​e​a​(P)⌋8𝜋3𝜋𝑅𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑃𝐴𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑃𝑟ℎ1𝜋superscript𝑅2𝐴𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑃\\lfloor\\frac{8\\pi}{3}+\\frac{\\pi R\\times Perimeter(P)}{Area(P)}+\\frac{(r+h+1)\\pi R^{2}}{Area(P)}\\rfloor, where hℎh is the number of holes and R𝑅R is the number of reflex vertices in the polygon. Albers et al.  assume that the environment is modeled by a directed, strongly connected graph and give a d𝒪​log⁡d​msuperscript𝑑𝒪𝑑𝑚d^{\\mathcal{O}\\log d}m competitive algorithm where m𝑚m is the number edges in the graph and d𝑑d is the minimum number of edges that have\nto be added to make the graph Eulerian. The robot’s task is to visit all nodes and edges of the graph using the minimum number R𝑅R of edge traversals. For a simple polygon, Hoffmann et al. 6 presented an algorithm which achieves a competitive ratio of 26.526.526.5. For the special case of an orthogonal polygon, Deng et al.  presented a 22\\sqrt{2} competitive exploration strategy with one robot. We show how to extend the single robot exploration algorithm by Deng et al.  to the case of p𝑝p robots. The resulting algorithm has a competitive ratio that is a function of p𝑝p.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: The study of geometric problems that are based on visibility is a well-established field within computational geometry.
