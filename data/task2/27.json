      "content": "Paper Title: A Common Semantic Space for Monolingual and Cross-Lingual Meta-Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWord embeddings successfully capture lexical semantic information about words based on co-occurrence patterns extracted from large corpora  4  or knowledge bases , with excellent results on several tasks, including word similarity   , Semantic Textual Similarity  or Sequence Labelling . Following the hypothesis that different knowledge sources may contain complementary semantic information , several authors have tried to enhance the quality of word representations by incorporating information from knowledge bases [ref]25   , other languages\n , or both\n . Meta-embeddings  aim to obtain an ensemble of distinct word embeddings each trained using different methods and resources, and possibly containing complementary information, to produce a word representation with an improved overall quality. Despite the potential benefits, learning a single meta-embedding from multiple source embeddings remains a challenging task mostly due to the fact that it is not obvious how to combine embeddings that are the result of using different algorithms, resources and languages. This paper explores the combination of multiple word embeddings (independently learned applying various techniques to different textual sources, knowledge bases and languages) by projecting them to a common semantic space using linear transformations, by generating appropriate representations for the out-of-vocabulary words, and by averaging. The main challenge when generating meta embeddings is preserving the information encoded in the source embeddings. Concatenation  has been used as a very strong baseline in all the previous works because the resulting meta-embedding preserves all the information from the source embeddings. However, concatenation generates meta-embeddings with a very high dimensionality. To avoid this, other methods have been proposed: dimensionality reduction 6, averaging  or complex linear methods and supervised neural models [ref]9  . However, we show that previous methods cause some information loss that results in worse performance compared to concatenation. Interestingly, Coates and Bollegala  mathematically proved that averaging is a good approximation to concatenation when the embeddings are placed in the same space. Following this, we use VecMap   to project the source word embeddings to the same semantic space. This allows us to minimize the lose of information when finally averaging the word embeddings. We also empirically demonstrate the benefits of treating the OOV words (when a word is missing in one of the source embeddings) problem. Simple strategies such as assigning a vector of zeros for OOV words have a large negative impact because these words are projected to very different positions than the ones expected. Thus, in this paper we propose a method to deal with the OOV problem which is suitable for mono- and cross-lingual meta-embedding generation. Previous proposed methods to generate meta-embeddings also face the problem of hyper-parameter tuning, namely, to the fact that hyper-parameters need to be tuned depending on the source embeddings [ref]9  . This means that the performance can vary significantly depending on the hyper-parameters used, which makes these methods difficult to use. As opposed to this, our approach does not rely on hyper-parameter tuning. In fact, we only use one hyperparameter which is kept constant for all our experiments. While making our method much robust, this also allows to successfully combine a large variety of word embeddings quickly and efficiently. The main contributions of this paper are the following. First, we present a new method to generate meta-embeddings that exploits existing vector space mapping techniques. Second, we extensively demonstrate that treating correctly the OOV words problem (when a word is missing in one of the source embeddings) improves performance on both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations. Third, our new approach to deal with the OOV problem works well for the generation of both mono- and cross-lingual meta-embeddings. Thus, while previous methods are only suitable for combining monolingual embeddings or require embeddings from the same source in order to achieve good results [ref]9  , our approach allows to effectively and efficiently ensemble any number of existing mono- and cross-lingual embeddings. Fourth, we evaluate our embeddings in both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, showing that our approach generates better static meta-embeddings than current state-of-the-art methods, including other linear methods and supervised neural models. In particular, we report new state-of-the-art results for Word Similarity and for POS tagging (UD 1.2) in English and Spanish. Moreover, the results show that the resulting cross-lingual meta-embeddings also exhibit excellent cross-lingual transfer learning capabilities. Finally, our code and meta-embeddings are publicly available111https://github.com/ikergarcia1996/MVM-Embeddings. The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents some alternative meta-embedding approaches. Section 3 describes our meta-embedding creation approach and in Section 4 we present the pre-trained word embeddings used in the experiments reported in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes and discusses future work.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: knowledge sources may contain complementary semantic information , several authors have tried to enhance the quality of word representations by incorporating information from knowledge bases [ref]25   , other languages\n , or both\n .
