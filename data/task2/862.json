      "content": "Paper Title: Federated Learning with Nesterov Accelerated Gradient\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the advancement of Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0, and Artificial Intelligence, machine learning applications such as image classification¬†, automatic driving¬†, and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)¬† are rapidly developed. Since the tremendous machine learning data are distributed in individual users, conventional centralized machine learning is insufficient when a large volume and sensitive data are required to be uploaded to remote data-centers. Moreover, in many situations, the individual users are not willing to share their sensitive raw data so it is infeasible to implement centralized machine learning. To address the issue, Federated Learning (FL) emerges [ref]4. It allows individual users to participate in the global model training without sharing their raw data. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), as shown in Fig.¬†1, is a perfect venue to implement FL¬†, where multiple edge devices are distributed and connected to an edge server. Workers can be any form of edge devices such as laptop, smartphone, tablet, IoT devices, etc. The edge server can aggregate the local models from edge workers and re-distribute the global model back to edge workers. Since edge workers have limited computation and communication capacities, we need to develop more efficient algorithms to accelerate the convergence and finally decrease the communication and computing workload and total training time. One commonly adopted FL algorithm is FedAvg [ref]4, which performs gradient descent  at each worker: Each worker locally updates its weights by gradient descent for a number of local iterations by its local dataset, and then the aggregator averages the weights from all workers and distribute them to the workers again. The above process is repeated for multiple rounds. (One round consists of a number of local iterations and one communication step between workers and the aggregator.) However, one disadvantage of gradient descent is its low efficiency for convergence and potential in oscillations  . The weight update at the specific iteration tùë°t is only governed by the current gradient at this iteration. It does not consider the past weight update steps. Momentum¬† is able to improve the situation by adding an additional momentum step to include the difference between past and current weights on the basis of gradient descent step. The advantage of momentum has been well studied in centralized setting[ref]9 0 1. It also motivates researchers to employ momentum in FL environment 2 3 4. Depending on where the momentum is adopted, these works can be categorized as aggregator momentum and worker momentum. The aggregator momentum applies momentum at the aggregator but it can only utilize the momentum acceleration every œÑùúè\\tau local iterations when global aggregation happens. (œÑùúè\\tau is the number of local iterations between two global aggregations.) Worker momentum utilizes the momentum acceleration at the worker but is influenced by out-of-date momentum since the momentum is only updated when global aggregation occurs and each worker does not update it in each local iteration. Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) 5 is known to be an advantageous form of momentum¬†. Existing works have demonstrated the advantage of momentum in both centralized and FL environment, but it is not clear how to quantify the benefits of NAG in FL in the literature. This motives us to propose an NAG style FL, namely FedNAG: (1) Each worker locally updates its weights and momenta using NAG for œÑùúè\\tau iterations on its local dataset; (2) the aggregator collects and averages the weights and momenta from all workers and distribute them to the workers again; (1) and (2) are repeated for multiple rounds until the training loss is sufficiently small. We theoretically provide a detailed convergence analysis for FedNAG. The progress mainly includes three steps: (1) We define virtual update as if centralized NAG is conducted between two global aggregations; (2) We bound the gap of weights ùê∞ùê∞\\mathbf{w} between FedNAG update and virtual update; and (3) We bound the values of global loss functions F‚Äã(ùê∞)ùêπùê∞F(\\mathbf{w}) between FedNAG and the optimal solution. Since the convergence analysis of FedAvg is provided in¬†6, we compare the convergence performance of FedNAG and FedAvg and derive the conditions that FedNAG outperforms FedAvg. Experimentally, we use different models such as linear regression, logistic regression, CNN, and DNN based on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, to test the performance of FedNAG. We analyze the impact of different factors such as number of workers, number of local updates between two global aggregataion œÑùúè\\tau, and momentum coefficient. We also conduct a trace-driven simulation to emulate a MEC environment to test the real-world total training time consisting of computation delay and communication delay. The experiment shows that FedNAG increases the learning accuracy by 3‚Äì24% and decreases the total training time by 11‚Äì70% compared with FedMom¬†2 and FedAvg under a wide range of settings.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: the individual users are not willing to share their sensitive raw data so it is infeasible to implement centralized machine learning.
