      "content": "Paper Title: Impact of Stop Sets on Stopping Active Learning for Text Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nActive learning (AL) is a widely used strategy for reducing data labeling costs. AL has been used for many semantic computing applications within natural language processing (NLP), such as text classification (TC)  [ref]2    [ref]6 [ref]7, named entity recognition (NER)  , and machine translation (MT)0 1 2. Problem settings and recent developments in AL are discussed further in 3. The essential concept behind AL is for the machine learning (ML) model to take an operational role in deciding which data instances should be labeled for learning. The active learning process begins with an unlabeled pool of data, an initially empty pool of labeled training data, and a batch size. In the first step of AL, the model queries an oracle (a human data labeler) for the labels of an initial batch of training data. Following this, the algorithm enters an iterative process: the model is trained on the existing set of labeled data; the model queries the oracle to label a new batch of training examples; and the labeled and unlabeled sets are adjusted accordingly. This process is shown in Algorithm¬†1, where bùëèb refers to the batch size, LùêøL the set of labeled examples, UùëàU the unlabeled pool of examples, and BùêµB the batch set of examples queried at each iteration of AL. An essential component to any active learning setup is an effective stopping method that halts the data labeling process. Without a stopping method, the model would request annotations for every training example, defeating the purpose of AL. Past work has used the term ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù to characterize stopping methods that tend to prioritize saving annotations and the term ‚Äúconservative‚Äù to characterize stopping methods that tend to maximize model performance . In general, it is desirable for stopping methods to be: capable of reducing the number of labels required without sacrificing final performance, capable of adjustment to be more or less aggressive, and applicable and consistent across many AL settings, base learners, tasks, and datasets. A simple stopping method would be to stop after an ad-hoc predetermined labeling budget has been exhausted. However, this runs a large risk of either obtaining a significantly lower-performing model or wasting large amounts of data labeling effort. Another simple approach would be to use a small set of labeled data to evaluate performance during learning and stop when performance levels off. However, previous work has found that not only does this method have the drawback of requiring additional labeled data, but also that this method doesn‚Äôt work as well as state-of-the-art stopping methods that base the stopping decision on the result of clever measurements made on a large set of unlabeled data 4. Such a large set of unlabeled data has been termed a ‚Äústop set‚Äù . Two of the most widely used classes of stopping methods are stabilizing predictions-based methods  5 6 and confidence-based methods 7. A well-known confidence-based stopping method stops AL when model confidence on a large, representative stop set begins to decline 7. We discuss confidence-based stopping methods in greater detail in section¬†III. Stabilizing Predictions (SP) stops AL when the agreement between successively trained models exceeds some threshold. SP computes the agreement between two models by comparing the predictions of each model on a large, representative, randomly selected set of examples that does not have to be labeled. We discuss the SP method in greater detail in section¬†III. Two new stopping methods were recently proposed in 8 and presented as having better performance than the leading existing stopping methods, however, the use of SP-stopping in those experiments did not use a proper stop set. Instead of a large unbiased representative stop set, the remaining unlabeled pool was used, which is a shrinking and systematically biased stop set. In this paper we investigate the impact of using the remaining unlabeled pool as a stop set and various randomly selected stop sets of different sizes. We show that the choice of stop set has a substantial impact on performance for both stability-based stopping and confidence-based stopping. Furthermore, the impact is different depending on whether the stopping method is a stability-based method or a confidence-based method. In extensive experiments with multiple freely and publicly available widely used benchmark datasets, which will allow for others to reproduce our experiments or run further experiments, we find that when SP is used with an unbiased representative stop set as originally proposed in , the performance of SP is stronger than that of the confidence-based methods, including those proposed in 8. The methods proposed in 8 are similar to the stopping criterion proposed in 7. We experimentally show the extent to which the method from 7 has more conservative performance than the methods proposed in 8. We find that the methods from 8 and 7 perform better compared with themselves when using an unbiased representative stop set as originally proposed in 7. Our findings are important for helping to illuminate the impact of stop set choice on stopping method performance. We show experimentally that stop set choice can have a large practical impact on the performance of stopping methods for important semantic computing applications such as technology assisted review, and text classification more broadly. Contributions in this paper include: Illuminate the impact of the choice of using the remaining unlabeled pool as a stop set for SP in the experiments of 8 and show how such a choice impacts SP stopping behavior. Compare several stopping methods, using multiple stop sets with each stopping method, on several publicly available datasets to experimentally show how performance is affected by stop set choice. Experimentally show the extent to which use of the biased remaining unlabeled pool as a stop set will tend to make stability-based methods stop more aggressively and make confidence-based methods stop more conservatively than when using an unbiased representative stop set. Section¬†II discusses related work, section¬†III provides detailed descriptions of the stopping methods, section¬†IV discusses our experimental setup, section¬†V presents our experimental results and analysis, and section¬†VI concludes.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: (AL) is a widely used strategy for reducing data labeling costs.
