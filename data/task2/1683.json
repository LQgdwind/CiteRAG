      "content": "Paper Title: LocalDrop: A Hybrid Regularization for Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRegularization aims to settle overfitting and improve the generalization ability of neural networks. Dropout  randomly drops units along with their connections from the neural network, preventing units from overly co-adapting. Then an exponential number of different thinned networks are sampled, in a fashion similar to bagging . Drawing on the concept of dropout, several studies have been carried out recently. Dropconnect  randomly drops the weights to achieve better performance. Adaptive dropout [ref]9 blends a binary belief network with a classic neural network to lower the classification error in practice though theoretically unwarranted. Fast dropout [ref]26 replaces actual sampling with an approximation of the Gaussian distribution to accelerate dropout training and to avoid training an additional exponential number of neural networks. Spatial dropout  randomly drops all the channels from feature maps in CNNs. Variational dropout [ref]10 learns dropout rates for better models, which can also be regarded as a generalization of Gaussian dropout. Based on variational dropout, sparse variational dropout  uses different dropout rates to obtain a high level sparsity in neural networks. Extending the idea of analyzing dropout from the Bayesian perspective , concrete dropout  demonstrates the Bayesian generalization of Bernoulli dropout. In the same vein, variational Bayesian dropout  provides the Bayesian generalization of Gaussian dropout. Adversarial dropout  integrates adversarial training and dropout to accomplish state-of-the-art performance in image classification. Information dropout  applies information theoretic principles (i.e., Bottleneck principles) to deep learning, including dropout and other strategies. DropBlock  is a variant of dropout on convolutional neural networks, randomly dropping units in a block region of the feature map. Zoneout  is a variant of dropout on RNNs, randomly preserving unitsâ€™ previous values instead of dropping them. Although these dropout strategies have achieved great success in practice, most of them suffer from the lack of rigorous theoretical support.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: similar to bagging .
