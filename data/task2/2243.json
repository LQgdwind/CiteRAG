Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Stable, Fast and Accurate: Kernelized Attention with Relative Positional Encoding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe use the BERT-base architecture [ref]9 in our experiments, which consists of 12 Transformer layers. For each layer, the hidden size is set to 768, and the number of attention heads is set to 12. We follow  to construct the data corpus and train the model using masked language modeling task. We use the GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) dataset [ref]47 as the downstream tasks to evaluate the performance of the pre-trained models. All codes are implemented based on fairseq  in PyTorch [ref]31. All models are run on 64 NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs with mixed-precision . To show the effectiveness of our proposed NPRF-Transformer with RPE, we choose several competitive baselines in literature, including : Linformer , Nyströmformer , SMYRF , and Fast Clustered Attention (FCA) . All the baselines use the same architecture as ours. The details about these baselines can be found in Appendix A.1. For all baselines, we report the number in their original papers. We also tried to train the PRF Transformer model from scratch or continue to train a PRF Transformer from the released RoBERTa checkpoint . But all the efforts failed due to the optimization instability issue. For our model, we directly modify the self-attention layer using normalized kernelized attention with RPE and train it from scratch. The overall comparison results are presented in Table 1 (“/” indicates the GLUE score of the corresponding downstream task is not reported). It can be easily seen that our NPRF-Transformer with RPE outperforms the previous works in terms of the average GLUE score, with a light computational overhead. Beyond the superior performance, it is also worth noting that our model can be stably pre-trained from scratch, which is particularly important in practice.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: We use the BERT-base architecture [ref]9 in our experiments, which consists of 12 Transformer layers.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
