      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable Causal Domain Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTransfer Component Analysis (TCA) is an unsupervised technique for domain adaptation proposed by Pan et al.  that discovers common latent features, called transfer components, that have the same marginal distribution across the source and target domains while maintaining the essential structure of the source domain data [ref]58. TCA learns these transfer components across domains in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space  using maximum mean miscrepancy . Once the transfer components are found, a traditional machine learning technique is used to train the final target classifier. In short, TCA is a two-step\ndomain adaptation technique where the first step reduces the marginal distributions between the source and target domains and the second step trains a classifier with the adapted domain data. Here, we compare SCTL¬†against TCA, which is a state-of-the-art\nalgorithm in unsupervised domain adaptation, and report the results. Note that, in TCA the focus is to identify substructures (i.e., transfer components)\nthat remains invariant across domains, which is different from the problem of identifying invariant features used\nfor training a predictive model, in which we do not need to have prior knowledge about the causal structure of the model that we are interested in. For implementation of the TCA we used, the rbf kernel, and the logistic classifier to predict on the extracted components. We also tune the hyperparameters of the algorithm by using Support Vector Classifier and increasing the number of components from 1 to 5, which lead to further decrease in the accuracy of the model. We hypothesize that TCA cannot learn the transfer components correctly in this setting.\nFurther investigation by comparing with semi-supervised versions  as well as strategies that also incorporate sample reweighing are left for future work. Assume that the ‚Äúlearning Markov\nblankets‚Äù phase (Step 1) uses the grow-shrink (GS) algorithm , and n=|V|ùëõùëân=|V|, m=|E|ùëöùê∏m=|E|, where\nG=(V,E)ùê∫ùëâùê∏G=(V,E) is the unknown true causal structure. Since the Markov blanket algorithm\ninvolves O‚Äã(n)ùëÇùëõO(n) conditional independence (CI) tests, if the cardinality of the Markov\nblanket of the target variable is kùëòk (in many real world cases k<<nmuch-less-thanùëòùëõk<<n, see for example real world datasets and their properties in ) then the total\nnumber of needed Cl tests for finding the best separating set is O(n+2k)ùëõsuperscript2ùëò(n+2^{k}), see  for more details. On the\nother hand, the brute force algorithm used in (Magliacane et al., 2018) needs O(2n)superscript2ùëõ(2^{n})\ntests in the worst case scenario, which is infeasible in practice as we have shown in our\nexperiments. The same argument is valid when we have multiple target variables, say cùëêc, where c<<nmuch-less-thanùëêùëõc<<n.\n\nReference markers found: [58]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]58: common latent features, called transfer components, that have the same marginal distribution across the source and target domains while maintaining the essential structure of the source domain data [ref]58.
