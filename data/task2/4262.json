A less constrained form of self-supervision is to use monocular videos, where consecutive temporal frames provide the training signal.\nIn one of the first monocular self-supervised approaches,  trains a depth estimation network along with a separate pose network. Inspired by , 4 proposes a more sophisticated motion model using multiple motion masks. 9 also decomposes motion into rigid and non-rigid components, using depth and optical flow to explain object motion. In the context of optical flow estimation,  shows that it helps to explicitly model occlusion.\nAdditional data such as pre-computed instance segmentation masks were used by  to help deal with moving objects. In another work,  shows that the inclusion of a local structure based appearance loss 6 significantly improves depth estimation performance compared to simple pairwise pixel differences 7  . Self-supervision was achieved by  by jointly training a depth and pose network using novel view synthesis. Nevertheless, all of these existing self-supervised approaches are formulated for after-the-fact setting depth estimation. In this paper, we for the first time develop a self-supervised monocular depth solution for our new forecasting setting.\n\n\nVideo Forecasting:\nThese approaches are useful in generating a future frame by learning past frame correspondence.\nRanzato et al. 0 introduces the first baseline in this domain by presenting a generative approach for the future frame prediction. Few works followed this 2 1 , which improves the learning of past context using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).\nDifferent from predicting frames, Jin et al.  directly predicts the semantic label of the future frame i.e semantic forecasting by observing the past frames. Several works 6  thereby followed that fused optical flow to model semantic forecast for longer durations. Along similar motivation to our work, semantic forecasting was addressed by forecasting intermediate latent representations of past observed frames using CNN  1 and ConvLSTMs 2. Depth forecasting was first addressed by 8 as a part of future frame synthesis that can only predict the depth of next time instant. Recently, Hu et al.  addressed this task using generative modelling of a probabilistic future. However, both of these approaches require expensive depth annotation during training or pre-training stage to generate the depth forecast. Our approach is thus the first work that attempts to solve the depth forecasting task in a completely self-supervised fashion without any label requirement.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Self-Supervised Depth Estimation:\nA more promising substitute for supervised depth models   9 5 [ref]2  [ref]27  is the self-supervised approach.
