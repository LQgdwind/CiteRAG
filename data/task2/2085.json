      "content": "Paper Title: NVC-Net: End-to-End Adversarial Voice Conversion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe describe the main components of NVC-Net. Some structures of NVC-Net are inherited from MelGAN  and WaveNet . More details on network configurations are given in Appendix A.2. Content encoder. The content encoder is a fully-convolutional neural network, which can be applied to any input sequence length. It maps the raw audio waveform to an encoded content representation. The content embedding is at 256x lower temporal resolution than its input. The network consists of 4 downsampling blocks, followed by two convolutional layers with the GELU  activations. A downsampling block consists of a stack of 4 residual blocks, followed by a strided convolution. A residual block contains dilated convolutions with gated-tanh nonlinearities and residual connections. This is similar to WaveNet , but here we simply use reflection padding and do not apply causal convolutions. For the content encoder, no conditional input is feed to the residual block. By increasing the dilation in each residual block, we aim to capture long-range temporal dependencies of audio signals as the receptive field increases exponentially with the number of blocks. Speaker encoder. The speaker encoder produces an encoded speaker representation from an utterance. We assume that p​(𝐳|𝐱)𝑝conditional𝐳𝐱p(\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{z}}|\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{x}}) is a conditionally independent Gaussian distribution. The network outputs a mean vector 𝝁𝝁\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{\\mu}} and a diagonal covariance 𝝈2​𝐈superscript𝝈2𝐈\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{\\sigma}}^{2}\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{I}}, where 𝐈𝐈\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{I}} is an identity matrix. Thus, a speaker embedding is given by sampling from the output distribution, i.e., 𝐳∼𝒩​(𝝁,𝝈2​𝐈)similar-to𝐳𝒩𝝁superscript𝝈2𝐈\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{z}}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{\\mu}},\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{\\sigma}}^{2}\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{I}}). Although the sampling operation is non-differentiable, it can be reparameterized as a differentiable operation using the reparameterization trick [ref]26, i.e., 𝐳=𝝁+𝝈⊙ϵ𝐳𝝁direct-product𝝈italic-ϵ\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{z}}=\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{\\mu}}+\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{\\sigma}}\\odot\\epsilon, where ϵ∼𝒩​(𝟎,𝐈)similar-toitalic-ϵ𝒩0𝐈\\epsilon\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{0}},\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{I}}). We extract mel-spectrograms from the audio signals and use them as inputs to the speaker encoder. The network consists of 5 residual blocks [ref]22 with dilated 1D convolutions. We use the Leaky ReLU nonlinarity with a negative slope of 0.2 for activation. Finally, an average pooling is used to remove temporal dimensions, followed by two dense layers, which output the mean and covariance. Generator. The generator maps the content and speaker embeddings back to raw audio. Our network architecture inherits from MelGAN , but instead of upsampling pre-computed mel-spectrograms, its input comes from the content encoder. More specifically, the network consists of 4 upsampling blocks. Each upsampling is performed by a transposed convolutional layer, followed by a stack of 4 residual blocks with the GELU  activations. To avoid artifacts, the kernel size is chosen to be a multiple of the stride . Different from MelGAN, our model uses gated-tanh nonlinearities  in the residual blocks. To perform the conditioning on the speaker identity, we feed a speaker embedding to the residual block as in  (see also Fig. 1). The speaker embedding first goes through a 1×1111\\times 1 convolutional layer to reduce the number of dimensions to match the number of feature maps used in the dilation layers. Then, its output is broadcast over the time dimension. Finally, we generate the output audio waveform by applying a convolutional layer with the tanh\\tanh activation at the end. Discriminator. The discriminator architecture is similar to that used in MelGAN . In particular, three discriminators with an identical network architecture are applied on different audio resolutions, i.e., downsampled versions of the input with different scales of 1, 2, and 4, respectively. We use strided average pooling with a kernel size of 4 to downsample the audio scales. Differently from MelGAN, our discriminator is a multi-task discriminator [ref]30, which contains multiple linear output branches. The number of output branches corresponds to the number of speakers. Each branch is a binary classification task determining whether an input is a real sample of the source speaker or a conversion output coming from the generator. Instead of classifying the entire audio sequences, we also leverage the idea of PatchGANs , which use a window-based discriminator network to classify whether local audio chunks are real or fake.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Although the sampling operation is non-differentiable, it can be reparameterized as a differentiable operation using the reparameterization trick [ref]26, i.e., 𝐳=𝝁+𝝈⊙ϵ𝐳𝝁direct-product𝝈italic-ϵ\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{z}}=\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{\\mu}}+\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{\\sigma}}\\odot\\epsilon, where\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
