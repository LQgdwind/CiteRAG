      "content": "Paper Title: FeatureNorm: L2 Feature Normalization for Dynamic Graph Embedding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDynamic graph embedding is an extension of static node embedding with an additional attention on the temporal-evolving information. Related works are generally carried out from two aspects: topological dependencies and temporal-evolving patterns.\n Topological dependencies learning. Early works for node embedding mainly center on factorization-based approaches, resorting to dimensionality reduction of graph Laplacian matrix , , [ref]11, . These methods suffer from time and memory efficiency. To improve scalability, the random walk-based methods transfer the embedding into a network mining task, which is inspired by the success in the natural language process .\nRecently, the generalizations of convolutions over graph-like data have achieved remarkable success. Defferrard et al.  first define graph convolutions using Chebyshev polynomial and reduce the computation significantly.\nKipf and Welling  simplify graph convolution using the first-order Chebyshev polynomial filters with an symmetric normalized adjacency matrix. Hamilton et al.  propose GraphSAGE for inductive learning.\nPeter et al.  further put forward a graph attention network (GAT) to explore the multiple attention mechanism in neighborhood message passing. Although these methods are proposed in a static graph, they are currently widely used in the structure learning of dynamic graph embedding [ref]17, [ref]18, , , , .\n Temporal-evolving patterns learning. To learn the temporal-varying patterns, most works adopt an temporal-smoothness or recurrent learning fashion (definitions see III-A), which is in line with the nature of the dynamism. In related literature, BCDG  utilizes matrix decomposition approach, which explores the smoothness across consecutive time steps to model the time-evolving patterns.\nNetWalk  takes a random walk method, using an autoencoder framework and minimizing the pairwise distance of vertex representation of each walk.\nDynGEM  also adopts the autoencoder framework that constrains the local and global structure proximity.\nWith the success of graph convolution, most recent works mainly leverage an integrated GCN model to capture the structure information. The main difference lies in the temporal regularities learning.\nDySAT [ref]17 brings self-attention mechanisms in both temporal and structural aspects.\nEvolveGCN [ref]18 models the dynamism of the dynamic graph by using an RNN to capture the GCN parameters.\n Oversmoothing in GNNs.\nOur work is also related to oversmoothing problem, and related works are as follows.\nLi et al.  first pay attention to the oversmoothing problem, and they prove that graph convolution is a special case of Laplacian smoothing. In other words, applying graph convolutional layers repeatedly will result in the embedding feature being indistinguishable. Xu et al.  propose a jumping knowledge network by utilizing skip connections for multi-hop message passing to overcome oversmoothing.\nKlicpera et al.  put forward a customized Pagerank to propagate messages.\nKlicpera et al.  consider adding residual connections like ResNet , using skip scheme to connect the cross-layer features.\nRong et al.  argue that randomly removing a certain fraction of edges can reduce the oversmoothing problem.\nZhao and Akoglu  use the total pairwise distance to avoid the feature being washed away.\nThe above methods mainly design for static graphs and do not consider the temporal condition. Our work is to tackle oversmoothing, more precisely i.e., serious feature shrink in dynamic graph settings with temporal information.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: patterns.\n Topological dependencies learning.
