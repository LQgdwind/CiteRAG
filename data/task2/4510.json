      "content": "Paper Title: Class-Incremental Learning with Cross-Space Clustering and Controlled Transfer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn an incremental setting, a model is required to consistently learn new tasks, without compromising performance on old tasks. Incremental learning methodologies can be split into five major categories, each of which we review below. Regularization-based methods focus on quantifying the importance of each parameter in the network, to prevent the network from excessively changing the important parameters pertaining to a task. These methods include EWC , SI , MAS  and RWalk . A recent method ELI , introduces an energy based implicit regularizer which helps to alleviate forgetting. Algorithm-based methods seek to avoid forgetting from the perspective of the network training algorithm. They modify gradients such that updates to weights do not not deteriorate performance on previously seen tasks. Methods such as GEM , A-GEM , OGD  and NSCL  fall under this category. Meta-learning based methods   are also useful while learning continually. Architecture-based methods modify the network architecture dynamically to fit more tasks, by expanding the model by adding more weights  , or masking and allocating subnetworks to specific tasks 5, or by gating the parameters dynamically using a task identifier . Exemplar-based methods (also called replay-based or rehearsal methods) assume that a small subset of every class can be stored in a memory at every phase. They replay the seen classes later along with the incoming new classes, directly preventing them from being forgetten. One set of works focus on reducing the recency bias due to the new classes being in majority at every phase   9 [ref]7. Another set of works focus on optimizing which samples to choose as exemplars to better represent the class distributions  . Distillation-based methods use the model learned until the previous task as a teacher and provide extra supervision to the model learning the current tasks (the student). Since the data of the previous tasks are inaccessible, these methods typically enforce distillation objectives on the current data  2, data from an exemplar memory 9 3 2 [ref]7  7 3, external data  or synthetic data 9. Since our method falls under this category, we extend our discussion on related methods below. Early works in this category distill logit scores  2 or attention maps 2 of the previous model. iCARL 2 proposes to enforce distillation on new tasks as well exemplars from old tasks, along with herding selection of exemplars and nearest-mean-of-exemplars (NME) based classification. GD  calibrates the confidence of the model’s outputs using external unlabelled data, and propose to distill the calibrated outputs instead. LUCIR 9 introduces a less-forget constraint that encourages the orientation of a sample in the current feature space to be similar to its orientation in the old feature space. Apart from that, LUCIR proposes to use cosine-similarity based classifiers and a margin ranking loss that mines hard negatives from the new classes to better separate the old class, additionally avoiding ambiguities between old and new classes. PODNet 3 preserves an example’s representation throughout the model with a spatial distillation loss.\nSS-IL  show that general KD preserves the recency bias in the distillation, and propose to use task-wise KD. Co2L  introduces a contrastive learning based self-supervised distillation loss that preserves the exact feature relations of a sample with its augmentations and other samples from the dataset.\nGeoDL 7 introduces a term that enhances knowledge distillation by performing KD across low-dimensions path between the subspaces of the two models, considering the gradual shift between models. The main difference of our cross-space clustering objective from these works is that we do not optimize to preserve the properties of individual examples, and instead preserve the previously learned semantics or properties of each class in a holistic manner.\nOur formulation takes into account the global position of a class in the feature space, and optimizes all samples of the class towards the same region, making the model indifferent to instance-level semantics.\nFurther, classes are supervised with specific “negative” regions all over the feature space, also intrinsically giving rise to better separation between class clusters. Our controlled transfer objective, on the other hand, attempts to regularize transfer between tasks. MER 3, an algorithm-based method is related to our high-level objective. MER works in the online continual learning setup, combining meta-learning 5  with replay. Their method optimizes such that the model receives weight updates are restricted to those directions that agree with the gradients of prior tasks.\nOur objective proposes to utilize the structure of the feature space of the previous model to align the current feature space, in order to maximize transfer.\nOur novelty here lies in how we explicitly approximate inter-class semantic similarities in a continual task stream, and utilize them to appropriately position new tasks representations, regularizing transfer.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: along with the incoming new classes, directly preventing them from being forgetten.
