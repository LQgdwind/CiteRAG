      "content": "Paper Title: Sparse Voxels Rasterization: Real-time High-fidelity Radiance Field Rendering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn Tab. 19, we show details per-scene comparison with 3DGS  using our base setup.\nOur method uses much more primitives (i.e., voxels or Gaussians) compared to 3DGS on all the scenes.\nHowever, our average rendering FPS is still comparable to 3DGS.\nWe find the FPS is scene-dependent, where we achieve much faster FPS on some of the scenes while slower on the others.\nOur method generally uses short training time.\nRegarding the quality metrics, our results are typically −0.20.2-0.2db PSNR and −0.010.01-0.01 SSIM behind 3DGS, while our LPIPS is better on average. As discussed in the main paper, not only the scene representation itself affects the results, but the optimization and adaptive procedure are also an important factor.\nThe strategy of adding more Gaussians progressively is not applicable to ours.\nWe also have not explored to use of the coarse geometry estimated from SfM, while 3DGS uses SfM sparse points for initialization.\nAs the first attempt of marrying rasterizer with fully explicit sparse voxels for scene reconstruction, there is still future potential for improvement from different aspects. The F-score and chamfer distance of each scene from the Tanks&Temples and DTU [ref]17 datasets are provided in Tab. 20.\nWe only list the two representative NeRF-based methods and two GS-based methods in the result breakdown comparison.\nMore methods with the average scores are in the main paper. The results on the Synthetic-NeRF [ref]27 dataset is provided in the last section of Tab. 19.\nWe achieve good quality, high FPS, and fast training on this dataset.\nHowever, our quality is slightly worse than 3DGS  with slower FPS.\nOur development mainly focuses on real-world datasets.\nFuture work may need more exploration to continue development on this dataset. We show qualitative comparison with 3DGS  on indoor and outdoor scenes in Fig. 14 and Fig. 15, respectively.\nOur visual quality is on par with 3DGS.\nWe provide the visualization of the raw reconstructed meshes in Fig. 16.\nFor quantitative evaluation, we follow previous works to apply mesh cleaning with the provided bounding box or masks.\nDespite the good quantitative results for meshes, some apparent artifacts can be observed from the visualization.\nIn particular, our method focuses more on the geometric details and sometimes over-explains the texture on a flat surface with complex geometry.\nFuture work may want to model a signed distance field instead of our current density field and introduce surface smoothness regularizers. We thank Min-Hung Chen and Yueh-Hua Wu for helpful paper flow suggestions and proofreading.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: explicit sparse voxels for scene reconstruction, there is still future potential for improvement from different aspects.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
