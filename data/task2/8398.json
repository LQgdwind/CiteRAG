      "content": "Paper Title: Practical Performative Policy Learning with Strategic Agents\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe interaction between machine learning models and society has become an important topic, particularly due to the data distribution shifts induced by human behavior. The canonical learning paradigm, which assumes a static data distribution, often fails in strategic environments. A growing body of work addresses data distribution shifts arising from the strategic behavior of agents, which differ fundamentally from classical exogenous distribution shifts in their cause‚Äîthese shifts are driven by the agents‚Äô organic strategic responses to deployed algorithms in pursuit of better outcomes. The first line of work is strategic classification with seminal papers  [ref]25, where the decision process of an agent is usually formulated as utility function maximization. An agent therein seeks to balance the impact of the predictive algorithm under the hypothetical manipulated feature value and the cost of feature manipulation. The strategic classification paradigm essentially characterizes the micro-level structure of distribution shift as the best response of every specific agent given their original features, knowledge of the predictive model, and manipulation cost. There has been some recent development in strategic classification relaxing such assumptions  [ref]38, while practical model optimization, still relies on parametric specification of micro-level utility [ref]39. Performative prediction  is a more general formulation, aiming to relax stringent agent utility modeling assumptions. From a causal perspective, performative prediction views the predictive model as a complex intervention on the data distribution. This perspective gives rise to a core concept, the distribution map ùíü‚Äã(Œ∏)\\mathcal{D}(\\theta), which directly links the parameter Œ∏\\theta of a predictive model and the shifted data distribution. There has been methods proposed to learn the performative optimal Œ∏\\theta and the map ùíü‚Äã(Œ∏)\\mathcal{D}(\\theta) such as bandit approach  and gradient-based optimization with parametric specifications on ùíü‚Äã(Œ∏)\\mathcal{D}(\\theta)  , such as ùí©‚Äã(Œº‚Äã(Œ∏),œÉ2)\\mathcal{N}(\\mu(\\theta),\\sigma^{2}). For high-dimensional Œ∏\\theta in practice, the former incurs bad sample efficiency and the latter incurs severe risk of macro-level data distribution misspecification. The primary objective of this paper is to make performative learning practical with mild structured assumptions. We first note that the model parameter Œ∏\\theta is commonly high-dimensional in practice, which makes distribution map ùíü‚Äã(Œ∏)\\mathcal{D}(\\theta) require a large number of algorithm deployments with different model parameters Œ∏\\theta to generate sufficient variation. This requirement severely restricts the efficiency of learning. Second, at the conceptual level, we argue that it is not only inefficient but also incorrect to take the model parameter Œ∏\\theta as the intervention instead of the predictive model fŒ∏f_{\\theta}. For a neural network fŒ∏f_{\\theta}, the parameter Œ∏\\theta could be meaningless when separate from architecture, which makes the mapping from model parameter to distribution parameter very vague and hard to learn. In fact, the deployed model fŒ∏f_{\\theta} is the object that agents interact with, which is also reflected in the micro-level mechanism often used in strategic classification, e.g. refer to Equation (4). These limitations hinder the practical implementation of existing performative prediction algorithms that rely on modeling ùíü‚Äã(Œ∏)\\mathcal{D}(\\theta). Instead, our work first acknowledges ùíü‚Äã(fŒ∏)\\mathcal{D}(f_{\\theta}) and endeavors to leverage agent behavior structure in typical strategic environments to achieve greater dimension reduction of ùíü‚Äã(fŒ∏)\\mathcal{D}(f_{\\theta}). To practically simplify the mapping ùíü‚Äã(fŒ∏)\\mathcal{D}(f_{\\theta}), we draw motivation from the concept of bounded rationality, rooted in the behavioral economics literature . Bounded rationality suggests that agents may be unable to fully utilize all available information due to cognitive limitations. In our context, this means that an agent may lack the capacity to execute optimization procedures involving a highly complex prediction function fŒ∏f_{\\theta}, even if the function is fully disclosed. Instead, the optimization they can realistically perform is selecting the alternative with the highest utility from a finite set of options. This perspective is particularly relevant in performative learning, which involves a principal interacting with a population of agents‚Äîfor instance, a bank handling numerous loan applicants or an e-commerce platform serving many consumers. This setting contrasts with the fully rational framework of classical game theory. For an agent with feature xx, it is neither tractable nor necessary to exploit the entirety of the information contained in fŒ∏f_{\\theta}. Instead, the influence of fŒ∏f_{\\theta} on the agent can be distilled into evaluations at specific feature values, e.g., (f‚Äã(xi))i=1m(f(x_{i}))_{i=1}^{m}. Correspondingly, the agent‚Äôs consideration set comprises points (xi)i=1m(x_{i})_{i=1}^{m}. We term this scenario limited manipulation and initially adopt it as an assumption for convenience. Nevertheless, in Section¬†5, we further demonstrate that this manipulation pattern can be incentivized by a partially personalized policy, which the principal can design.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: cause‚Äîthese shifts are driven by the agents‚Äô organic strategic responses to deployed algorithms in pursuit of better outcomes.
