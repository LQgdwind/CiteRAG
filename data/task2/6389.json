      "content": "Paper Title: Memory-Constrained Algorithms for Convex Optimization via Recursive Cutting-Planes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVaidya’s method     and the variant 5 that we use in our algorithms, belong to the family of cutting-plane methods. Perhaps the simplest example of an algorithm in this family is the center-of-mass method, which achieves the optimal 𝒪​(d​ln⁡1ϵ)𝒪𝑑1italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(d\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}) oracle-complexity but is computationally intractable, and the only known random walk-based implementation [ref]4 has computational complexity 𝒪​(d7​ln⁡1ϵ)𝒪superscript𝑑71italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(d^{7}\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}). Another example is the ellipsoid method, which has suboptimal 𝒪​(d2​ln⁡1ϵ)𝒪superscript𝑑21italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(d^{2}\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}) query complexity, but has an improved computational complexity 𝒪​(d4​ln⁡1ϵ)𝒪superscript𝑑41italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(d^{4}\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}). [ref]8 pointed out that Vaidya’s method achieves the best of both worlds by sharing the 𝒪​(d​ln⁡1ϵ)𝒪𝑑1italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(d\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}) optimal query complexity of the center-of-mass, and achieving a computational complexity of 𝒪​(d1+ω​ln⁡1ϵ)𝒪superscript𝑑1𝜔1italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(d^{1+\\omega}\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})111ω<2.373𝜔2.373\\omega<2.373 is the exponent of matrix multiplication. In a major breakthrough, this computational complexity was improved to 𝒪​(d3​ln3⁡1ϵ)𝒪superscript𝑑3superscript31italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(d^{3}\\ln^{3}\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}) in 5, then to 𝒪​(d3​ln⁡1ϵ)𝒪superscript𝑑31italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(d^{3}\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}) in 0. We refer to [ref]8 5 0 for more detailed comparisons of these algorithms. Another popular convex optimization algorithm that requires quadratic memory is the Broyden– Fletcher– Goldfarb– Shanno (BFGS) algorithm  [ref]7 8 9, which stores an approximated inverse Hessian matrix as gradient preconditioner. Several works aimed to reduce the memory usage of BFGS; in particular, the limited memory BFGS (L-BFGS) stores a few vectors instead of the entire approximated inverse Hessian matrix  8. However, it is still an open question whether even the original BFGS converges for non-smooth convex objectives 7. Lying at the other extreme of the oracle-complexity/memory trade-off is gradient descent, which achieves the optimal memory usage but requires significantly more queries than center-of-mass or Vaidya’s method in the regime ϵ≲1dless-than-or-similar-toitalic-ϵ1𝑑\\epsilon\\lesssim\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}. There is a rich literature of works aiming to speed up gradient descent, such as the optimized gradient method 5 4, Nesterov’s Acceleration , the triple momentum method , geometric descent , quadratic averaging 6, the information-theoretic exact method , or Big-Step-Little-Step method 1. Interested readers can find a comprehensive survey on acceleration methods in 0. However, these acceleration methods usually require additional smoothness or strong convexity assumptions (or both) on the objective function, due to the known Ω​(1ϵ2)Ω1superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\Omega(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^{2}}) query lower bound in the large-scale regime ϵ≳1dgreater-than-or-equivalent-toitalic-ϵ1𝑑\\epsilon\\gtrsim\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} for any first order method where the query points lie in the span of the subgradients of previous query points . Besides accelerating gradient descent, researchers have investigated more efficient ways to leverage subgradients obtained in previous iterations. Of interest are bundle methods  2 6, that have found a wide range of applications  4. In their simplest form, they minimize the sum of the maximum of linear lower bounds constructed using past oracle queries, and a regularization term penalizing the distance from the current iteration variable. Although the theoretical convergence rate of the bundle method is the same as that of gradient descent, in practice, bundle methods can benefit from previous information and substantially outperform gradient descent . The increasing size of optimization problems has also motivated the development of communication-efficient optimization algorithms in distributed settings such as 3 8   1   . Moreover, recent works have explored the trade-off between sample complexity and memory/communication complexity for learning problems under the streaming model, with notable contributions including  1 2 7  0.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: method, which achieves the optimal 𝒪​(d​ln⁡1ϵ)𝒪𝑑1italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(d\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}) oracle-complexity but is computationally intractable, and the only known random walk-based implementation [ref]4 has computational complexity 𝒪​(d7​ln⁡1ϵ)𝒪superscript𝑑71italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(d^{7}\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}).
