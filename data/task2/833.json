      "content": "Paper Title: Semantics-preserving Reinforcement Learning Attack Against Graph Neural Networks for Malware Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAdversarial malware generation contrasts with previous applications of adversarial sample generation in computer vision because most features in malware detection involve in discrete data, which means the gradients to train the generator are zero almost everywhere.\nThere are two constraints for adversarial malware generation: 1) large-scale manipulations on original features may change the program‚Äôs functionality; 2) generated samples should not remove original features.\nMultiple attacks are introduced to evade deep learning models. Some of them modify original malware, for example, add benign code to malware, to mimic benign program[ref]39  [ref]7.\nAnderson et al. modify PE header metadata, Section metadata, Import and Export Table metadata, etc. by reinforcement learning to evade static PE machine learning malware models.\nPark et al.[ref]8 generate the executable adversarial malware examples by inserting semantic Nops to evade CNN based detection models.\nOther attacks focus on the gradient of the detection model or the substitute model to tweak some features of the target model, e.g. adding new API calls .\nThe evolutionary computation techniques are used to develop new variants of mobile malware. Although researchers have been developing graph based neural network models for malware detection, no systematic study on whether such models can be attacked.\nUnlike to image data, it is harder to generate adversarial samples on graph-based data for two reasons: 1) the graph structure is discrete so we cannot use infinitesimal small perturbation, and 2) large graphs can not easily be verified visually.\nThe attacks on graph based model can be grouped into two categories: gradient-based attack and non-gradient-based attack. Gradient-based attacks retrieve or estimate the gradient information of the detection model to modify the original samples.\nChen et al. introduced a network embedding attack that uses the gradient information of the adjacency matrix to iteratively add or delete some key links.\nZ√ºgner et al. first proposed a method N‚Äãe‚Äãt‚Äãt‚Äãa‚Äãc‚ÄãkùëÅùëíùë°ùë°ùëéùëêùëòNettack to perturb the graph data to perform poisoning attack on GCN model.\nNon-gradient-based attacks solve the graph based optimization problem without using the gradient of the detection model.\nDai et al. proposed a reinforcement learning based attack method RL-S2V that learns to modify the graph structure by sequentially adding or dropping edges from the graph.\nWang et al. developed two algorithms, Greedy and Greedy-GAN, to attack GCN models by adding fake nodes into the original graph.\nWang et al. formulated a graph-based optimization problem to manipulate edges and solved the problem using projected gradient descent method.\nSun et al. extend the idea of RL-S2V to sequentially add fake nodes, introduce fake links, and modify the labels of fake nodes. Differently from some of the prior works, e.g. [ref]7 , our target models are graph based deep learning models from CFGs. The generated samples should not change the program‚Äôs functionality. So we can not arbitrarily add or remove the edges and nodes features of the CFGs.\nIn our paper, we focus on generate adversarial CFGs by iteratively insert semantic Nops into original graphs.\nPerhaps most closely related to our work on evading CFG based deep learning model. First, instead of using graph neural networks,\nthey extracted some indicators such as closeness centrality, density, and betweenness centrality, to represent the CFG and constructed a detection model. Because those features are continuous value, they can directly apply methods of white box attack to generate adversarial samples. However, those generated adversarial samples can not be reverted to CFG and might change the structure, features, and consequently, the programs‚Äô behaviors. The graph embedding and augmentation method they proposed reply on expert experience on modify the CFG and doesn‚Äôt consider the guidance of the malware detection.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: not remove original features.\nMultiple attacks are introduced to evade deep learning models. Some of them modify original malware, for example, add benign code to malware, to mimic benign program[ref]39  [ref]7.\nAnderson et al. modify PE header metadata, Section metadata, Import and Export Table metadata, etc. by reinforcement learning to evade static PE machine learning malware models.\nPark\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
