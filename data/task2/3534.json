      "content": "Paper Title: Engineering the Neural Automatic Passenger Counter\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe NAPC as introduced in  can be considered as a stationary method operating on non-stationary data since its counts are bounded (see Section III) but the labels can basically be arbitrary large. For time series, methods to change non-stationary to stationary data, two popular methods can be applied: The forward difference operator, which is defined by  as and the backward difference operator as analogously for the time scale h∈]0,1]ℎ01h\\in\\left]0,1\\right]. According to  it was first proposed by  in 1989. The cumulative sum over a sequence, the approach we use, can be considered the inverse operation of the backward difference operator. The differentiation and integration approach is applied, e.g. to make stock-market predictions . In economics, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models are used to make time-series forecast predictions on non-stationary data (for details, see Chapter 4 of ). The integration step is a cumulative sum over all previous predictions (i.e., an integration over a stationary process). Autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) properties help the model to predict future time-steps based on previous predictions (including the errors of previous predictions). Models with those features but no integration are categorized as ARMA. The integration step removes the trend of the time series. Another topic is the use of legacy computational platforms, which we use for inference: since some have limited floating-point capabilities, we have developed a universal post-training Monte Carlo quantization method, which can, in particular, be applied to LSTMs. The term quantization refers to the process of reducing the resolution from floating-point to fixed-point numbers while retaining an overall similarity of the values. [ref]21 [ref]21 investigated the effects of multilayer neural network quantization and concluded that 10 bits are necessary for their experiments. However, they used only weight quantization on linear-only connections. More than two decades later  propose their schematics to quantize recurrent neural networks down to 8-bit resolution . They leverage quantization-aware training procedures, allowing for reduced quantization errors post-training. They successfully report the quality of their method with wider LSTM layers (compared to ).  proposed a more recent solution to LSTM quantization with and without quantization-aware training in \\citeyearli2021quantization . The authors reduce the resolution for weights and activations to 8-bit fixed-point arithmetics and maintain a 16-bit fixed-point when necessary (e.g. cell states). Not only is quantization relevant to legacy platforms, but it can also be used to fully utilize specialized neural network ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) like the Google Edge TPU . Another aspect we cover is ensembles: To improve equivalence test success chances by reducing bias, we have combined multiple networks into NAPC ensembles. Ensemble methods are used to improve the quality of a prediction of a single expert model through the combination of multiple experts. Those members of an ensemble then vote, or their predictions are combined such that the resulting selected prediction is a collective solution. Multiple experiments   show that ensemble methods can improve the predictions. Keeping the ensemble size small is another objective. Since each member processes the input, the computations grow with each additional member.  mentions that using all available instances (neural networks in our case) could also result in a worse ensemble performance than choosing a subset of those . \nMultiple learners can be created by e.g. Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking, which have different properties and limitations. Bagging (bootstrap aggregating) averages through all predictions in regression, or uses plurality voting for classification tasks . All members are trained independently and can therefore be parallelized. On the other hand, Boosting optimizes recursively and is not parallel. The Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm emphasizes the wrongly predicted samples of one model to train another model with those. The collection of those repeatedly optimized models is weighted and then combined .  introduced stacking (or stacked generalization) in 1992 as a method to combine the output of one or more generalizers : Level 0 algorithms are optimized on input data and level 1 algorithms combine level 0 algorithm outputs to create its own outputs. More levels can be defined analogously. \nAnother aspect of ensemble building is the pruning method to limit the number of learners. Those methods can be categorized into Ranking, Clustering, Optimization and others [ref]31. Ranking-based methods use measurable quality criteria to rank all the available algorithms and take the k𝑘k best performing to build the ensemble (with size k𝑘k). Clustering-based methods do not need a labeled pruning set as the other methods do, as it clusters the models based on a distance measurement (could be done on artificial data) and prunes the clusters until k𝑘k members are left. Optimization-based ensemble pruning methods like Centralized Objection Maximization for Ensemble Pruning (COMEP) by  starts with a single ensemble member and optimizes an objective iteratively for each new member . Other methods like genetic algorithms  can be used as optimization-based ensemble pruners [ref]31 as well. During our work, another issue emerged: Non-determinism. To conduct research on and potentially exploit the impact of neural network initialization or the training order for the NAPC as in , determinism is required. This has been an issue with GPU accelerated training, which relies on modern research in the area. As stated by [ref]34 even with fixed seeds, a robust reproducibility of experiments used to be not achievable [ref]34. The non-determinism they measure (variance after training with the same seeds) is only traceable to the GPU floating-point operations, as the initialization of the ResNet  weights and the order of samples (mini-batches) is fixed. After training 50 models with the same and different seeds, they measure the proportion of variance in the metrics introduced by the GPUs. For the standard deviation of the model’s accuracy, the GPU non-determinism contributed around 74% of the overall variance on the test set, and for the loss, it is more than 87% of the standard deviation’s variance on the test set. However, we could utilize more recent developments that enable deterministic GPU accelerated training .\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: be applied to LSTMs. The term quantization refers to the process of reducing the resolution from floating-point to fixed-point numbers while retaining an overall similarity of the values.
