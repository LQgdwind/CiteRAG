      "content": "Paper Title: Style Transformer for Image Inversion and Editing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGAN inversion is first proposed in 4 and becomes important due to the wide applications of some recent generators. There are basically two ways, either encoder-free or encoder-based. The former does not have any training parameters, and the latent codes are directly optimized by the gradient mainly from reconstruction loss. To deal with the complex latent structure, Abdal et al. [ref]1 invert a real image in W+superscriptùëäW^{+} space, and use pixel-wise MSE and perceptual loss with Adam  to tune the code. Image2StyleGAN++  extends the code space to the layerwise additive noise vector to decrease the distortion. Although such a method can reliably find the code through multi-step iterations, it is inefficient and its code lacks the editability. In contrast, the encoder-based method intends to train a common model to achieve inversion for all images. It improves the editing ability and is efficient during inference. IDInvert  utilizes a CNN as encoder to output the code. Except the reconstruction and perceptual loss, it is trained by an extra adversarial loss. pSp  designs a two-pyramid encoder to provide multi-scale features, and maps them to the style vector through multiple convolution layers. Benefiting from strong features, pSp achieves less distortion. ReStyle  uses the encoder to give the residual style to refine the inversion in the iterative way. E4e  analyzes the distortion-editability trade off for inversion and editing tasks in W+superscriptùëäW^{+}. It sacrifices the inversion accuracy to improve the editablity, constraining the codes for different layers close with each other. Kim et al.  and Wang et al. 6 depart from W+superscriptùëäW^{+} space and enhance the code with spatial dimensions, so that more information are given to the generator to lower down the distortions. Compared to previous works, our method lies strictly in W+superscriptùëäW^{+}, and it is able to achieve minimal distortion and high quality editing at the same time. Latent code manipulation for pretrained StyleGAN is often used to edit the attribute and achieve I2I translation, either in the supervised or unsupervised manner. GANSpace  and Sefa  adopt PCA to find the principal directions in WùëäW space. They are responsible for controlling the pose, gender or background. Note that for a particular attribute, these works specify the same direction on all latent codes to realize editing. Voynov and Babenko  train a simple module to edit the input, and use a reconstructor in pixel domain to interpret the editing, finding noticeable directions. LatentCLR 0 builds a learnable direction model to edit the code and uses contrastive loss to train it. Hence, these two models give different images unique editing directions. All the above works are unsupervised, without requiring attribute label for editing. But only limited directions for some attributes can be found. The supervised methods can identify directions for more attributes, especially the local ones. InterfaceGAN  trains the linear binary SVM in latent space to obtain a separation plane, whose normal vector controls its corresponding attribute. StyleSpace  finds the control direction in a precise way guided by the semantic mask. Moreover, they propose to edit the code in SùëÜS space which is defined by the affine layer after WùëäW. Wang et al.  further extend SùëÜS space by tracing back the gradient flow to its previous stage, making the change more accurately. Note that these works still share the same editing direction for all images. Recently, StyleFlow  conditionally manipulates the images using Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNF). Yao et al. 8 propose a latent transformation module to generate adaptive directions for different images. Wang et al. 6 utilize a CNN encoder to provide multi-scale features to supplement the 1√ó1111\\times 1 style vector, which actually adapts directions at different locations. However, previous works only deal with the label-based editing. Collins et al.  apply k-means clustering on features to obtain channel-wise masks, determining which channels are locally semantic-aware. The cluster memberships of the reference further guide local attribute editing for the source. Different from above works, our work is strictly in W+superscriptùëäW^{+}, and we realize both the label- and the reference-based editing.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: The former does not have any training parameters, and the latent codes are directly optimized by the gradient mainly from reconstruction loss.
