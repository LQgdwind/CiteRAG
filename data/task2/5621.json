      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Intrinsic Embedding for Non-rigid Point Cloud Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNon-rigid point cloud matching\nThis is a challenging task due to the complexity of modeling non-rigid deformations. Extrinsic methods [ref]26 [ref]54 [ref]51      approximate a complex global non-rigid deformation with a set of local rigid and/or affine transformations. On the other hand, intrinsic approaches, especially the spectral-based techniques, leverage the geometric information encoded in the eigenbasis of Laplacian operators, which lift the matching problem into a high-dimension space, where a family of isometric non-rigid deformations is well characterized. The structural benefits are attained at the cost of significantly larger search space for the optimal transformation. We conclude some typical spectral embeddings in the following. Geometric Embeddings \nPioneered by the work , eigenbasis of the Laplace-Beltrami operator plays a dominant role in geometry processing for decades. Especially, several early approaches    attempt to establish connection between eigenbasis and surface geodesics, which encode essentially the intrinsic geometry. However, due to the computational burden and the noise-prone nature of high-frequency eigenfunctions, this line of works usually uses relatively low frequency eigenbasis, yielding only rough approximation in recovering geodesic distances. Related to this topic, there are also approaches directly optimizing for embeddings that best recover the underlying geodesics. For instance, MDS  is a classical dimension reduction method, which can achieve reasonably accurate embedding by minimizing certain stress. More recently, by exploiting the structural properties of the geodesics on the surface, GeodesicEmbedding  is proposed to build a hierarchical embedding, which in turn helps to reduce computing time of inferring geodesic distance on high-resolution meshes. While these approaches achieve relatively high recovery accuracy, we point out that they both require the ground-truth geodesic distances as input, thus not suitable for our target. (Deep) Functional Maps\nAnother line of works that closely related to ours is the functional maps framework . In the functional space, a correspondence can be represented by a small matrix encoded in a reduced eigenbasis and computed as the optimal transformation that aligns a given set of probe functions possibly with other regularization.\nEarly works along this line take mostly an axiomatic approach    , while in recent years a trend of integrating functional maps mechanism into a learning pipeline is attracting extensive attention    \nWhile most of the deep functional maps frameworks follow the utility of spectral embeddings and refine features upon some hand-crafted descriptors, e.g., HKS , WKS , SHOT . By leveraging full  or weak  supervision, networks are capable of extracting features directly from point clouds. Furthermore, exploration on how to establish embeddings to take over the spectral ones is also taken in 0, which again relies heavily on the supervision over shape correspondences.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Non-rigid point cloud matching\nThis is a challenging task due to the complexity of modeling non-rigid deformations.
