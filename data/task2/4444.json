A function μ:d​o​m​(𝒬)↦ℕ:𝜇maps-to𝑑𝑜𝑚𝒬ℕ\\mu:dom(\\mathcal{Q})\\mapsto\\mathbb{N} is called a parameter of 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q}. We say that 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} is fixed-parameter tractable w.r.t. μ𝜇\\mu if there exists an algorithm solving 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} on every instance x∈d​o​m​(𝒬)𝑥𝑑𝑜𝑚𝒬x\\in dom(\\mathcal{Q}) of size ‖x‖norm𝑥\\|x\\| in time O​(f​(μ​(x))×‖x‖O​(1))𝑂𝑓𝜇𝑥superscriptnorm𝑥𝑂1O(f(\\mu(x))\\times\\|x\\|^{O(1)}), where f𝑓f can be any computable function. For additional details, we refer to the textbook by Downey and Fellows .\nFor example, treewidth of graphs is a well-known parameter frequently resulting in fixed parameter tractability, including the (#)H𝐻H-COLORING problem .\nUnfortunately, computing treewidth is in general NP-hard, and the classes of graphs of bounded tree-width are rare. Hence, finding additional examples of (graph width) parameters can in practice be very useful.\nAnother frequently occurring parameter is clique-width. This parameter can be seen as a generalisation of tree-width, in the sense that any treewidth-bounded class of graphs is also clique-width bounded, even though the reverse is not true. The use of clique-width has led to many positive results in graph algorithms, e.g., Bodlaender et al.  designed an algorithm solving Min-DOMINATING-SET in time O∗​(3ω2​k)superscript𝑂superscript3𝜔2𝑘O^{*}(3^{\\frac{\\omega}{2}k}) on graphs of clique width ≤kabsent𝑘\\leq k (ω<2.376𝜔2.376\\omega<2.376). Kobler et al.  also solved a cost version of list-q𝑞q-COLORING in time O​(22​q​k​q​k3​n)𝑂superscript22𝑞𝑘𝑞superscript𝑘3𝑛O(2^{2qk}qk^{3}n) on graphs G𝐺G with n𝑛n vertices and clique-width k𝑘k, and more generally Wahlström proved  that (#)H𝐻H-COLORING is FPT when parameterized by the clique-width of the input graph.\nRecently, Bonnet et. al [ref]14 introduced contraction sequences in order to use dynamic programming on graphs. Contraction sequences allows one to derive a lot of additional parameters such as twin-width, oriented twin-width, total twin-width and component twin-width [ref]12.\nWe do not formally define these parameters here since we in Section 3 define these in a slightly more general context, but remark that component twin-width and clique-width (and thus rank-width) have been proven to be functionally equivalent, allowing one to translate FPT results between these parameters.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: graphs G𝐺G with n𝑛n vertices and clique-width k𝑘k, and more generally Wahlström proved  that (#)H𝐻H-COLORING is FPT when parameterized by the clique-width of the input graph.\nRecently, Bonnet et. al [ref]14 introduced contraction sequences in order to use dynamic programming on graphs.
