      "content": "Paper Title: General regularization in covariate shift adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the literature, various RKHS-based approaches are available for a Radon - Nikodým derivative estimation. Here we may refer to  and to references therein. Conceptually, under the assumption that β∈ℋK𝛽subscriptℋ𝐾\\beta\\in{\\mathcal{H}_{K}}, several of the above approaches can be derived from a regularization of an integral equation, which can be written in our terms as and is ill-pose similar to (LABEL:A.eq2.1.7). Here 𝟏1\\mathbf{1} is the constant function that takes the value 111 everywhere, and almost without loss of generality, we assume that 𝟏∈ℋK1subscriptℋ𝐾\\mathbf{1}\\in{\\mathcal{H}_{K}}, because otherwise the kernel K1​(x,x′)=1+K​(x,x′)subscript𝐾1𝑥superscript𝑥′1𝐾𝑥superscript𝑥′K_{1}(x,x^{\\prime})=1+K(x,x^{\\prime}) will, for example, be used to generate a suitable RKHS containing all constant functions. Just as the equation (LABEL:A.eq2.1.7) is inaccessible, so is the equation (LABEL:A.eq3.1.1). But in contrast to (LABEL:A.eq2.1.7), the reduction of (LABEL:A.eq3.1.1) to a finite-dimensional problem does not require any labels, such as 𝐲,𝐲{\\bf y}, that were necessary for dealing with the normal equation SSX∗​B​SSX​f=S𝐱∗​B​𝐲superscriptsubscript𝑆subscript𝑆𝑋𝐵subscript𝑆subscript𝑆𝑋𝑓subscriptsuperscript𝑆𝐱𝐵𝐲S_{S_{X}}^{*}BS_{S_{X}}f=S^{*}_{{{\\bf x}}}B{\\bf y}. Since in practice, the amount of unlabeled inputs is usually much greater than that of labeled ones, we assume that the sizes M𝑀M and N𝑁N of i.i.d. samples (x1′,x2′,…,xM′)superscriptsubscript𝑥1′superscriptsubscript𝑥2′…superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑀′(x_{1}^{\\prime},x_{2}^{\\prime},\\ldots,x_{M}^{\\prime}) and (x1,x2,…,xN)subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2…subscript𝑥𝑁(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{N}) drawn respectively from ρTsubscript𝜌𝑇\\rho_{T} and ρSsubscript𝜌𝑆\\rho_{S} are much larger than m𝑚m and n𝑛n appearing in Theorem LABEL:A.thm2.1. Then we consider two sample operators and the finite-dimensional problem which is an empirical version of the equation (LABEL:A.eq3.1.1), where, similar to the above notations the operators SN,S∗:RN→ℋK,:superscriptsubscript𝑆𝑁𝑆→superscript𝑅𝑁subscriptℋ𝐾S_{N,S}^{*}:\\mathbbm R^{N}\\rightarrow{\\mathcal{H}_{K}}, SM,T∗:RM→ℋK:superscriptsubscript𝑆𝑀𝑇→superscript𝑅𝑀subscriptℋ𝐾S_{M,T}^{*}:\\mathbbm R^{M}\\rightarrow{\\mathcal{H}_{K}} are given as A regularization of equations (LABEL:A.eq3.1.1), (LABEL:A.eq3.1.3) may serve as a starting point for several approaches of estimating the Radon - Nikodým derivative β𝛽\\beta. For example, as it has been observed in , the known kernel mean matching (KMM) method  can be viewed as the regularization of (LABEL:A.eq3.1.1), (LABEL:A.eq3.1.3) by the method of quasi (least-squares) solutions, originally proposed by Valentin Ivanov (1963) and also known as Ivanov regularization (see, e.g.,  and 8 for its use in the context of learning). In KMM\nan Ivanov-type regularization is applied to the empirical version (LABEL:A.eq3.1.3) and leads to a quadratic problem. At the same time, the kernelized unconstrained least-squares importance fitting (KuLSIF) proposed in  allows an analytic-form solution and can be reduced to solving a linear problem with respect to corresponding variables. From Theorem 1 of  it follows that in KuLSIF the approximation β~~𝛽\\tilde{\\beta} of the Radon - Nikodým derivative β=d​ρTd​ρS𝛽𝑑subscript𝜌𝑇𝑑subscript𝜌𝑆\\beta=\\frac{d\\rho_{T}}{d\\rho_{S}} is in fact constructed by application of the Tikhonov regularization scheme to the empirical version (LABEL:A.eq3.1.3) of the equation (LABEL:A.eq3.1.1), that is in KuLSIF we have where gλ​(t)=(λ+t)−1.subscript𝑔𝜆𝑡superscript𝜆𝑡1g_{\\lambda}(t)=(\\lambda+t)^{-1}. Though there are several studies devoted to KMM and KuLSIF, to the best of our knowledge there has been no study of pointwise approximation error β​(x)−β~​(x)𝛽𝑥~𝛽𝑥\\beta(x)-\\tilde{\\beta}(x), which is of interest in analysis of regularized domain adaptation methods, such as IWRLS. For example, in  and  (see Type I setting there) the statistical consistency and accuracy of KuLSIF have been analysed in the space L2,ρSsubscript𝐿2subscript𝜌𝑆L_{2,\\rho_{S}}, where pointwise evaluations are undefined. We can also mention the study , where KuLSIF represented as (LABEL:A.eq3.1.4) with gλ​(t)=(λ+t)−1subscript𝑔𝜆𝑡superscript𝜆𝑡1g_{\\lambda}(t)=(\\lambda+t)^{-1} was discussed in a RKHS, but only convergence of β~~𝛽\\tilde{\\beta} to β𝛽\\beta was proved, without quantifying its rate. At the same time, using the concept of source conditions naturally appearing because of equation (LABEL:A.eq3.1.1), we can obtain the following statement thm3.1\nAssume that β=d​ρTd​ρS𝛽𝑑subscript𝜌𝑇𝑑subscript𝜌𝑆\\beta=\\frac{d\\rho_{T}}{d\\rho_{S}} meets source condition β=ϕ​(JS∗​JS)​νβ𝛽italic-ϕsuperscriptsubscript𝐽𝑆subscript𝐽𝑆subscript𝜈𝛽\\beta=\\phi(J_{S}^{*}J_{S})\\nu_{\\beta}, where ϕ∈ℱ​(0,c),italic-ϕℱ0𝑐\\phi\\in\\mathcal{F}(0,c), and c𝑐c is large enough. Consider the approximant βM,Nλsuperscriptsubscript𝛽𝑀𝑁𝜆\\beta_{M,N}^{\\lambda} given by (LABEL:A.eq3.1.4), where the regularization scheme indexed by gλ​(t)subscript𝑔𝜆𝑡g_{\\lambda}(t) has the qualification ν𝜈\\nu that covers the index function ϕ​(t)italic-ϕ𝑡\\phi(t). Let λ=λM,N=θϕ−1​(M−12+N−12),𝜆subscript𝜆𝑀𝑁superscriptsubscript𝜃italic-ϕ1superscript𝑀12superscript𝑁12\\lambda=\\lambda_{M,N}=\\theta_{\\phi}^{-1}(M^{-\\frac{1}{2}}+N^{-\\frac{1}{2}}), where θϕ​(t)=ϕ​(t)​t.subscript𝜃italic-ϕ𝑡italic-ϕ𝑡𝑡\\theta_{\\phi}(t)=\\phi(t)t. Then for sufficiently large M𝑀M an N𝑁N with probability at least 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta it holds rem_new2\nAs we already mentioned, for gλ​(t)=(λ+t)−1subscript𝑔𝜆𝑡superscript𝜆𝑡1g_{\\lambda}(t)=(\\lambda+t)^{-1} the convergence in probability of the approximation (LABEL:A.eq3.1.4) to β𝛽\\beta in RKHS has been proven in . Such convergence has been established in  on the base of an error estimation (see Supplementary material A in ), which in our terms can be written as follows: where βλ=(λ​I+JS∗​JS)−1​JT∗​JT​𝟏,superscript𝛽𝜆superscript𝜆𝐼superscriptsubscript𝐽𝑆subscript𝐽𝑆1superscriptsubscript𝐽𝑇subscript𝐽𝑇1\\beta^{\\lambda}=(\\lambda I+J_{S}^{*}J_{S})^{-1}J_{T}^{*}J_{T}\\mathbf{1}, and 0<a<12,0<b<12.formulae-sequence0𝑎120𝑏120<a<\\frac{1}{2},0<b<\\frac{1}{2}.\nNote that in the regularization theory, the quantities ∥β−βλ∥delimited-∥∥𝛽superscript𝛽𝜆\\left\\lVert\\beta-\\beta^{\\lambda}\\right\\rVert are sometimes called the profile functions, and Corollary 2 of  estimates them in terms of the source condition β=ϕ​(JS∗​JS)​νβ𝛽italic-ϕsuperscriptsubscript𝐽𝑆subscript𝐽𝑆subscript𝜈𝛽\\beta=\\phi(J_{S}^{*}J_{S})\\nu_{\\beta} as follows Furthermore, the bound presented in Theorem LABEL:thm3.1 can be expressed in the following form Comparing (LABEL:new_eq2) - (LABEL:new_eq1) and keeping in mind that M−12+N−12λsuperscript𝑀12superscript𝑁12𝜆\\frac{M^{-\\frac{1}{2}}+N^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}{\\lambda} is smaller in the sense of the order than (N−aλ2+M−bλ)superscript𝑁𝑎superscript𝜆2superscript𝑀𝑏𝜆\\left(\\frac{N^{-a}}{\\lambda^{2}}+\\frac{M^{-b}}{\\lambda}\\right), one can conclude that the error bound (LABEL:new_eq1) obtained by our argument generalized and refines the results of . rem_new3\nRecall that for our purpose we restrict ourselves to the estimation of accuracy of (LABEL:A.eq3.1.4) in RKHS. At the same time, there are studies, where the accuracy of (LABEL:A.eq3.1.4) has been analysed in the space L2,ρSsubscript𝐿2subscript𝜌𝑆L_{2,\\rho_{S}}. For example, in  L2,ρSsubscript𝐿2subscript𝜌𝑆L_{2,\\rho_{S}} - convergence rate of KuLSIF estimator, which corresponds to (LABEL:A.eq3.1.4) with gλ​(t)=(λ+t)−1,subscript𝑔𝜆𝑡superscript𝜆𝑡1g_{\\lambda}(t)=(\\lambda+t)^{-1}, has been established in terms of the order γ𝛾\\gamma of the so-called bracketing entropy of the underlying space ℋKsubscriptℋ𝐾\\mathcal{H}_{K}. For a given space ℋKsubscriptℋ𝐾\\mathcal{H}_{K}, the γ𝛾\\gamma- value is fixed within the interval (0,2)02(0,2), i.e., 0<γ<2,0𝛾20<\\gamma<2, and Theorem 2 of  tells that if β∈ℋK,𝛽subscriptℋ𝐾\\beta\\in\\mathcal{H}_{K}, then for arbitrary ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon satisfying 1−2(2+γ)<ϵ<1,122𝛾italic-ϵ11-\\frac{2}{(2+\\gamma)}<\\epsilon<1, and λM,N,ϵ−1=O​((N∧M)1−ϵ)superscriptsubscript𝜆𝑀𝑁italic-ϵ1𝑂superscript𝑁𝑀1italic-ϵ\\lambda_{M,N,\\epsilon}^{-1}=O\\left((N\\wedge M)^{1-\\epsilon}\\right) with high probability it holds where N∧M=min⁡{N,M}𝑁𝑀𝑁𝑀N\\wedge M=\\min\\{N,M\\}. Note that the rate established by (LABEL:new_eq4) cannot be better than O​((N∧M)−12+γ)𝑂superscript𝑁𝑀12𝛾O\\left((N\\wedge M)^{-\\frac{1}{2+\\gamma}}\\right), and it does not take into account additional smoothness that any particular element β∈ℋK𝛽subscriptℋ𝐾\\beta\\in\\mathcal{H}_{K} has in the underlying space ℋKsubscriptℋ𝐾\\mathcal{H}_{K}. Such additional smoothness can be caught in the form of a source condition because as we already know from , there is always an index function ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi such that β=ϕ​(JS∗​JS)​νβ.𝛽italic-ϕsuperscriptsubscript𝐽𝑆subscript𝐽𝑆subscript𝜈𝛽\\beta=\\phi(J_{S}^{*}J_{S})\\nu_{\\beta}. Then assuming that ϕ​(t)​titalic-ϕ𝑡𝑡\\phi(t)\\sqrt{t} is covered by the qualification of the regularization used in (LABEL:A.eq3.1.4), and applying almost the same argument as in Theorem LABEL:thm3.1 we can obtain the bound To simplify a comparison of (LABEL:new_eq5) with the best possible rate O​((N∧M)−12+γ)𝑂superscript𝑁𝑀12𝛾O\\left((N\\wedge M)^{-\\frac{1}{2+\\gamma}}\\right) of (LABEL:new_eq4) we consider the same index functions ϕ​(t)=tr−12italic-ϕ𝑡superscript𝑡𝑟12\\phi(t)=t^{r-\\frac{1}{2}} as in Section LABEL:sec2.3. Then (LABEL:new_eq5) gives the rate of order O​((M−12+N−12)2​r2​r+1)𝑂superscriptsuperscript𝑀12superscript𝑁122𝑟2𝑟1O\\left((M^{-\\frac{1}{2}}+N^{-\\frac{1}{2}})^{\\frac{2r}{2r+1}}\\right), and for r>1γ𝑟1𝛾r>\\frac{1}{\\gamma} this rate is better than the one given by (LABEL:new_eq4), because This is one more example of how the study generalizes, specifies and refines previously known results. In, we highlight that the convergence of algorithms for Radon-Nikodým differentiation is impacted by both, the smoothness of the function being approximated and the capacity of the approximating space. However, the result in Theorem LABEL:thm3.1 only takes into consideration the smoothness of the approximated derivative β𝛽\\beta. Therefore, we follow  and employ the concept of the so-called regularized Christoffel function that allows direct incorporation of the regularization parameter λ𝜆\\lambda into the definition of a capacity measure.\nConsider the function Note that in  the reciprocal of Cλ​(x)subscript𝐶𝜆𝑥C_{\\lambda}(x), i.e. 1Cλ​(x)1subscript𝐶𝜆𝑥\\frac{1}{C_{\\lambda}(x)}, was called the regularized Christoffel function, but for the sake of simplicity, we will keep the same name also for (LABEL:def:Chris_func). Note also that in the context of supervised learning, where usually only one probability measure, say p𝑝p, is involved, the expected value of Cλ​(x)subscript𝐶𝜆𝑥C_{\\lambda}(x), called the effective dimension, has been proven to be useful . This function is also frequently used as a capacity measure of ℋKsubscriptℋ𝐾{\\mathcal{H}_{K}}. At the same time, if more than one measure appears in the supervised learning context, as is, for example, the case in the analysis of Nyström subsampling  , then the C𝐶C-norm of the regularized Christoffel function is used in parallel with the effective dimension 𝒩​(λ)𝒩𝜆\\mathcal{N}(\\lambda). This gives a hint that 𝒩∞​(λ)subscript𝒩𝜆\\mathcal{N}_{\\infty}(\\lambda) could also be a suitable capacity measure for analysing the accuracy of Radon-Nikodým numerical differentiation, since there more than one measure is also involved. To estimate the regularized Christoffel functions we slightly generalize a source condition for kernel sections K​(⋅,x)𝐾⋅𝑥K(\\cdot,x) that has been used in various contexts in  and [ref]6. assum:source_cond_kernel\n(Source condition for kernel) There is an operator concave index function ξ:[0,∥JS∗​JS∥]→[0,∞):𝜉→0delimited-∥∥subscriptsuperscript𝐽𝑆subscript𝐽𝑆0\\xi:[0,\\left\\lVert J^{*}_{S}J_{S}\\right\\rVert]\\to[0,\\infty) such that ξ2superscript𝜉2\\xi^{2} is covered by the qualification ν=1𝜈1\\nu=1, and for all x∈𝐗𝑥𝐗x\\in\\mathbf{X}, where c𝑐c does not depend on x𝑥x. We mention the following consequence of Assumption LABEL:assum:source_cond_kernel. lem:N_infty_bound\nUnder Assumption LABEL:assum:source_cond_kernel, By taking into account the smoothness properties of the Radon-Nikodým derivative β𝛽\\beta and the capacity of ℋKsubscriptℋ𝐾{\\mathcal{H}_{K}} expressed in terms of the regularized Christoffel functions, in, we establish a novel bound that relates βM,Nλsuperscriptsubscript𝛽𝑀𝑁𝜆\\beta_{M,N}^{\\lambda} to β𝛽\\beta in RKHS. thm4.5\nLet K𝐾K satisfies Assumption LABEL:assum:source_cond_kernel, and λ≥λ∗𝜆superscript𝜆\\lambda\\geq\\lambda^{*} with λ∗subscript𝜆\\lambda_{*} satisfying 𝒩​(λ∗)/λ∗=N𝒩subscript𝜆subscript𝜆𝑁\\mathcal{N}(\\lambda_{*})/\\lambda_{*}=N. If β=d​ρTd​ρS𝛽𝑑subscript𝜌𝑇𝑑subscript𝜌𝑆\\beta=\\frac{d\\rho_{T}}{d\\rho_{S}} meets source condition (LABEL:A.eq2.1.8) β=ϕ​(JS∗​JS)​νβ𝛽italic-ϕsuperscriptsubscript𝐽𝑆subscript𝐽𝑆subscript𝜈𝛽\\beta=\\phi(J_{S}^{*}J_{S})\\nu_{\\beta}, where ϕ=ϑ​ψ∈ℱ​(0,c)italic-ϕitalic-ϑ𝜓ℱ0𝑐\\phi=\\vartheta\\psi\\in\\mathcal{F}(0,c) with large enough c𝑐c, and the qualification gλsubscript𝑔𝜆g_{\\lambda} covers ϑ​(t)​t32italic-ϑ𝑡superscript𝑡32\\vartheta(t)t^{\\frac{3}{2}}, then with probability at least 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta, it holds Consider θϕ,ξ​(t)=ϕ​(t)​tξ​(t)subscript𝜃italic-ϕ𝜉𝑡italic-ϕ𝑡𝑡𝜉𝑡\\theta_{\\phi,\\xi}(t)=\\frac{\\phi(t)t}{\\xi(t)} and λ=λM,N=θϕ,ξ−1​(M−12+N−12)𝜆subscript𝜆𝑀𝑁superscriptsubscript𝜃italic-ϕ𝜉1superscript𝑀12superscript𝑁12\\lambda=\\lambda_{M,N}=\\theta_{\\phi,\\xi}^{-1}(M^{-\\frac{1}{2}}+N^{-\\frac{1}{2}}), then rem_sec4\nIn order to compare the bounds presented in Theorem LABEL:thm3.1 and Theorem LABEL:thm4.5, let us consider the case when β𝛽\\beta meets the source condition (LABEL:A.eq2.1.8) with ϕ​(t)=tηitalic-ϕ𝑡superscript𝑡𝜂\\phi(t)=t^{\\eta}.\nIn this case the bound (LABEL:1st_bound_beta) can be reduced to It is noteworthy that the error bound established in Theorem LABEL:thm3.1 does not take into consideration the capacity of ℋKsubscriptℋ𝐾{\\mathcal{H}_{K}}.
