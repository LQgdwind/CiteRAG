      "content": "Paper Title: Decomposing the Enigma: Subgoal-based Demonstration Learning for Formal Theorem Proving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSubgoal learning is a pivotal concept in reinforcement learning. It can enable AI systems to solve complex, long-horizon tasks more effectively. Crucially, theoretical analyses have shed light on key concepts including the computational benefits of rewarding subgoals [ref]48, the structure of Markov decision processes beneficial for hierarchical reinforcement learning [ref]45, the complexity of optimal option selection for planning , and the integration of temporal abstraction into RL . Empirical analyses in this field mainly focus on subgoal exploration, subgoal generation for planning, and curriculum learning for subgoals. Subgoal exploration aims to find the optimal or efficient exploration of subgoals, employing a variety of strategies. These include minimizing cover time [ref]18, learning dynamical distances , maximizing entropy , and utilizing asymmetric self-play . Subgoal planning research encompasses diverse algorithms for improved decision-making. For example, SoRB  uses RL to build a graph for subgoal sequences, DC-MCTS  applies learned sub-goal proposals to partition tasks, PAIR  combines online RL and offline supervised learning, and Moro et al.  extend MCTS with Hindsight Experience Replay for goal-oriented planning. The research centered on curriculum learning proposes various techniques to create a learning curriculum that gradually intensifies subgoal complexity, thereby optimizing learning efficiency and effectiveness  . While there have been preliminary efforts to apply similar principles in the construction of prompts for LLMs , the deployment of subgoal learning theories to manage intricate tasks, such as formal theorem proving, remains largely unexplored. Our work pioneers the use of subgoal learning in this domain, with a focus on format and organization.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: enable AI systems to solve complex, long-horizon tasks more effectively.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
