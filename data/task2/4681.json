      "content": "Paper Title: Gap-ETH-Tight Approximation Schemes for Red-Green-Blue Separation and Bicolored Noncrossing Euclidean Travelling Salesman Tours\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the Bicolored Noncrossing Traveling Salesman Tours problem, we are given n𝑛n terminal points on the plane. Each point is\ncolored either red or blue.\nThe task is to find two noncrossing\nround-trip tours of minimum total length such that all red points are visited by\none tour and all blue points are visited by the other one. The problem is\na generalization of the classical Euclidean traveling salesman\nproblem  and is therefore NP-hard.\nTo the best\nof our knowledge, this problem has not been considered before in the literature, although it nicely fits into the recent trend of finding noncrossing geometric\nstructures (see, e.g., the works of Polishchuk and Mitchell , Bereg et al. [ref]7 and Kostitsyna et al. ).\nBy using the same patching procedure as for Theorem 1.1, we obtain an EPTAS for this problem. Euclidean Bicolored Noncrossing Traveling Salesman Tours admits a randomized (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximation scheme with 2𝒪​(1/ε)​n​polylog​(n)superscript2𝒪1𝜀𝑛polylog𝑛2^{\\mathcal{O}(1/\\varepsilon)}n\\,\\textup{polylog}(n) running time.\nlinecolor=red,backgroundcolor=red!25,bordercolor=red,inline](Important Todo!)\nKF: near-optimal? Note that the aforementioned recent lower bound on Euclidean TSP  implies that our result for Bicolored Noncrossing Traveling Salesman Tours is Gap-ETH-tight: there is no 2o​(1/ε)​poly​(n)superscript2𝑜1𝜀poly𝑛2^{o(1/\\varepsilon)}\\mathrm{poly}(n)-time (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximation scheme unless Gap-ETH fails. We also consider the Bicolored Noncrossing Traveling Salesman Tours problem in plane graphs (that is, in planar graphs with a given planar embedding). There, the task is to draw the tours\nwithin a “thick” drawing of the given embedding without any crossings; see\nSection 3 for a formal definition.\nWe show that arguments for this problem in the\ngeometric setting seamlessly transfer to the combinatorial setting of planar graphs.\n\n\nThis fact allows us to obtain a PTAS also in plane graphs. Bicolored Noncrossing Traveling Salesman Tours in plane unweighted graphs admits an (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximation scheme with f​(ε)​n𝒪​(1/ε)𝑓𝜀superscript𝑛𝒪1𝜀f(\\varepsilon)n^{\\mathcal{O}(1/\\varepsilon)} running time for some function f𝑓f. At this point, we want to remark on the similarities and differences to the most related paper to our work:\nBereg et al. [ref]7\nconsider the problem of connecting same-colored terminals with noncrossing Steiner trees\nof total minimum length.\nApart from a min⁡(k​(1+ε),n​log⁡k)𝑘1𝜀𝑛𝑘\\min(k(1+\\varepsilon),\\sqrt{n}\\log k)-approximation algorithm for k𝑘k colors (based on ideas of previous papers   )\nand a (5/3+ε)53𝜀(5/3+\\varepsilon)-approximation algorithm for three colors, they\nobtain also a PTAS for the case of two colors.\nSimilarly, as we do in our approximation schemes for Red-Blue-Green Separation and Bicolored Noncrossing Traveling Salesman Tours, they use a plane dissection technique of Arora  to give their algorithmic\nresult.\nMoreover, they also design a patching procedure that allows them to\nlimit the number of times that the trees cross a boundary cell. Given the\nnature of Steiner tree problems, their patching procedure can place additional Steiner points in\nportals, which is not possible in our case of tours. As a consequence, their patching procedure is substantially simpler and\nless surprising.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: been considered before in the literature, although it nicely fits into the recent trend of finding noncrossing geometric\nstructures (see, e.g., the works of Polishchuk and Mitchell , Bereg et al. [ref]7 and Kostitsyna et al. ).\nBy using the same patching procedure as for Theorem 1.1, we obtain an EPTAS for this problem.
