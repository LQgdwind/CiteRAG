      "content": "Paper Title: One Parameter Defense - Defending against Data Inference Attacks via Differential Privacy\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDifferential privacy has been a prevalent tool to preserve the privacy of deep learning models  .\nA comprehensive survey regarding differential privacy in deep learning can be found in  .\nTo implement differentially private deep learning,\nnoise can be added to one of the five places in a deep neural network:\ninput datasets [ref]16, loss functions [ref]17, gradients  ,\nweights of neural networks  [ref]20, and output classes  . Heikkila et al. [ref]16 proposed a general approach for\na privacy-preserving learning schema for distributed settings.\nTheir approach combines secure multiparty communication\nwith differentially private Bayesian learning methods.\nIn their approach, each client adds a Gaussian noise to the data and divides the noised data into shares.\nThe shares are not divided independently.\nInstead, they are divided using a fixed-point representation of real numbers which allows exact cancellation of the noise in the sum.\nEach share is then sent to a server.\nThis way, the sum of the shares discloses the real value,\nbut separately they are just random noise.\n Zhao et al. [ref]17 proposed a privacy-preserving collaborative deep learning system.\nThe system allows users to collaboratively build a collective learning model\nwhile only sharing the parameters, not the data.\nTo preserve the private information embodied in the parameters,\nthey developed a functional mechanism, an extended version of the Laplace mechanism,\nto perturb the objective function of the neural network. Cheng et al.  developed a privacy-preserving algorithm for distributed learning\nbased on a leader-follower framework,\nwhere the leaders guide the followers in the right direction to improve their learning speed.\nFor efficiency, communication is limited to leader-follower pairs.\nTo preserve the privacy of the leaders,\nGaussian noise is added to the gradients of the leaders‚Äô learning models. Phan et al. [ref]20 proposed a heterogeneous Gaussian mechanism\nto preserve privacy in deep neural networks.\nUnlike a regular Gaussian mechanism,\nthis heterogeneous Gaussian mechanism can arbitrarily redistribute noise\nfrom the first hidden layer and the gradient of the model\nto achieve an ideal trade-off between model utility and privacy loss.\nTo obtain the property of arbitrary redistribution,\nthey introduce a noise redistribution vector that can be used\nto change the variance of the Gaussian distribution.\nFurther, it can be guaranteed that,\nby adapting the values of the scores in the noise redistribution vector,\nmore noise can be added to the more vulnerable components of the model to improve robustness and flexibility. Papernot et al.  developed a model called Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE)\nwhich has been successfully applied to generative adversarial nets (GANs) for a privacy guarantee .\nPATE consists an ensemble of nùëõn teacher models;\nan aggregation mechanism; and a student model.\nEach teacher model is trained independently on a subset of private data.\nTo protect the privacy of the data labels, Laplace noise is added to the output classes, i.e., the teacher votes.\nLast, the student model is trained through knowledge transfer from the teacher ensemble with the public data and privacy-preserving labels.\nLater, Papernot et al.  improved the PATE model to make it applicable to large-scale tasks and real-world datasets. In addition to the utilization of standard differential privacy, local differential privacy has also been adopted recently. For example, Kim et al.  adopted Gaussian mechanism to preserve local differential privacy of user data in federated learning models. They also analyzed the trade-offs between user privacy, global utility and transmission rate, where a larger noise variance guarantees a stronger privacy with a lower utility bound and a higher transmission rate bound.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: differential privacy in deep learning can be found in  .\nTo implement differentially private deep learning,\nnoise can be added to one of the five places in a deep neural network:\ninput datasets [ref]16, loss functions [ref]17, gradients  ,\nweights of neural networks  [ref]20, and output classes  .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
