      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterized Complexity of Streaming Diameter and Connectivity Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now show how our insights into parameterized, streaming graph exploration can aid in producing a new kernelization algorithm for Vertex Cover [k𝑘k].\nThe basis for our result is a well-known kernel for the Vertex Cover [k𝑘k] problem of Buss and Goldsmith , consisting of 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) edges. Constructing this kernel is simple: find all vertices with degree bigger than k𝑘k, and remove them from the graph, and decrease the parameter with the number of vertices removed, say to k′superscript𝑘′k^{\\prime}. Then, there is no solution if there are more than k⋅k′⋅𝑘superscript𝑘′k\\cdot k^{\\prime} edges. Therefore, we have a kernel consisting of 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) edges. We are able to achieve this same kernel in the AL model, as counting the degree of a vertex is possible in this model. Interestingly, we do not require 𝒪~​(k2)~𝒪superscript𝑘2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k^{2}) bits of memory to produce a stream corresponding to the kernel of 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) edges. This result is also possible in the EA model, by allowing vertices up to degree 2​k2𝑘2k. Given a graph G𝐺G as an AL stream, we can make an AL stream corresponding to an 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2})-edge kernel for the Vertex Cover [k𝑘k] problem using two passes and 𝒪~​(k)~𝒪𝑘\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k) bits of memory. When we work with an EA stream, we can make an EA stream corresponding to an 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2})-edge kernel using four passes and 𝒪~​(k)~𝒪𝑘\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k) bits of memory. Let G𝐺G be a graph, with n𝑛n vertices and m𝑚m edges, given as an AL stream, and let k𝑘k be the solution size parameter for the Vertex Cover [k𝑘k] problem. Note that we can count the degree of every vertex when it appears in the stream, as we are given all adjacencies of a vertex consecutively. Therefore, in one pass over the stream we can count the degree of every vertex, and save each vertex with a degree bigger than k𝑘k in a set S𝑆S, as long as |S|≤k𝑆𝑘|S|\\leq k. In this same pass, we keep track of two more counters: the total number of edges in the stream m′superscript𝑚′m^{\\prime} (which is 2​m2𝑚2m), and the number of unique edges we remove r𝑟r. The second can be done by keeping a local counter which we reset at every vertex and only increment for edges towards vertices not in S𝑆S, and adding this local counter to the number of edges removed when we decide to add the vertex to S𝑆S. If m′2−r>k⋅(k−|S|)superscript𝑚′2𝑟⋅𝑘𝑘𝑆\\frac{m^{\\prime}}{2}-r>k\\cdot(k-|S|), return NO. Otherwise, make a pass over the stream, and output only those edges between vertices not in S𝑆S. The output must be an AL stream, as we only remove edges from an AL stream to produce it. Let is also be clear that we use two passes over the stream. The set S𝑆S takes 𝒪~​(k)~𝒪𝑘\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k) bits of memory, as finding more than k𝑘k vertices will result in returning NO. Counting the total number of edges takes 𝒪​(log⁡m)=𝒪​(log⁡n)𝒪𝑚𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\log m)=\\mathcal{O}(\\log n) bits of space, and other counters are the same size or smaller, of which there are a constant amount. Therefore, the memory usage of this procedure is 𝒪~​(k)~𝒪𝑘\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k) bits. The behaviour of this procedure is equivalent of the kernelization algorithm of Buss and Goldsmith , as it finds exactly those vertices with degree higher than k𝑘k, and ‘removes’ them by adding them to S𝑆S and ignoring edges incident to them in the output. Checking the instance size is done correctly, as the new parameter k′superscript𝑘′k^{\\prime} is equivalent to k−|S|𝑘𝑆k-|S|, and the number of remaining edges is equal to m−r𝑚𝑟m-r, which is m′2−rsuperscript𝑚′2𝑟\\frac{m^{\\prime}}{2}-r. r𝑟r is counted correctly because we only count unique edges by ignoring those towards vertices already in S𝑆S. Therefore, this kernelization procedure is correct. For the case of the EA stream, we essentially do the same as in the AL model, but in this model we end up with a slightly larger kernel. In our first pass, we greedily construct a vertex cover X𝑋X of size 2​k2𝑘2k or conclude that there is no solution to Vertex Cover [k𝑘k]. Now, we know that all vertices not in X𝑋X must have degree at most 2​k2𝑘2k. So, in the second pass we count the degree of all vertices in X𝑋X, and if a degree exceeds 2​k2𝑘2k we the add vertex to S𝑆S. This takes only 𝒪~​(k)~𝒪𝑘\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k) bits of memory. If at some point |S|>k𝑆𝑘|S|>k we also stop and conclude there is no solution to Vertex Cover [k𝑘k], as all vertices of degree at least 2​k2𝑘2k must be in any solution. In a third pass, we count the total number m𝑚m of edges in the stream, and the number of unique edges we remove r𝑟r (this is not possible during the second pass because we might count edges double when it has both endpoints in S𝑆S). Now if m−r>2​k⋅(k−|S|)𝑚𝑟⋅2𝑘𝑘𝑆m-r>2k\\cdot(k-|S|), we can conclude there is no solution to Vertex Cover [k𝑘k], as each vertex has maximum degree 2​k2𝑘2k. Now to output the kernel as an EA stream, we make a fourth pass and only output those edges not incident to vertices in S𝑆S. In this procedure we only use 𝒪~​(k)~𝒪𝑘\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k) bits of memory for counting and X𝑋X. The resulting kernel has at most 2​k⋅(k−|S|)=𝒪​(k2)⋅2𝑘𝑘𝑆𝒪superscript𝑘22k\\cdot(k-|S|)=\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) edges. Next, we show how to use Theorem 6.1 to produce a kernel of even smaller size, using only 𝒪~​(k)~𝒪𝑘\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k) bits of memory. This requires Theorem 6.1 to convert the original graph stream into the kernel input for the next theorem, which only increases the number of passes by a factor 2 or 4 (we have to apply Theorem 6.1 every time the other procedure uses a pass). Interestingly, Chen et al.  show a way to convert the kernel of Buss and Goldsmith into a 2​k2𝑘2k-vertex kernel for Vertex Cover [k𝑘k], using a theorem by Nemhauser and Trotter . We will adapt this method in the streaming setting. The kernel conversion is done by converting the 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) edges kernel into a bipartite graph (two copies of all vertices V,V′𝑉superscript𝑉′V,V^{\\prime}, and an edge (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y) translates to the edges (x,y′)𝑥superscript𝑦′(x,y^{\\prime}), (x′,y)superscript𝑥′𝑦(x^{\\prime},y)), in which we find a minimum vertex cover using a maximum matching (see for example [13, Page 74, Theorem 5.3]). The minimum vertex cover we find gives us the sets stated in the theorem by Nemhauser and Trotter , as indicated by the constructive proof of the same theorem by Bar-Yehuda and Even . Lastly, we use these sets to give the 2​k2𝑘2k kernel in the streaming setting as indicated by Chen et al. . This also works for the EA model, because we only require the input kernel to consist of 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) edges, not that it specifically is the kernel by Buss and Goldsmith. Given a graph G𝐺G as a stream in model AL or EA, we can produce a stream in the same model corresponding to the Phase 1 bipartite graph of [8, Algorithm NT] using two passes and 𝒪~~𝒪\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1) bits of memory. Given a graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E), Phase 1 of [8, Algorithm NT] asks for the bipartite graph B𝐵B with vertex sets V,V′𝑉superscript𝑉′V,V^{\\prime} and edges EBsubscript𝐸𝐵E_{B} such that V′={v′∣v∈V}superscript𝑉′conditional-setsuperscript𝑣′𝑣𝑉V^{\\prime}=\\{v^{\\prime}\\mid v\\in V\\} and EB={(x,y′)∣(x,y)∈E}subscript𝐸𝐵conditional-set𝑥superscript𝑦′𝑥𝑦𝐸E_{B}=\\{(x,y^{\\prime})\\mid(x,y)\\in E\\}. This is essentially two copies of all vertices and each edge in the original graph makes two edges, between the corresponding (original,copy)-pairs. The process of creating a stream corresponding to B𝐵B is quite simple: first we use a pass and, for every edge (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y), we output (x,y′)𝑥superscript𝑦′(x,y^{\\prime}), and then we use another pass and, for every edge (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y), we output (x′,y)superscript𝑥′𝑦(x^{\\prime},y). If the input is an EA stream, then the output must be as well, as there are no requirements. If the input stream is an AL stream, the output must be an AL stream too, as we are consistent in which copy we address. That is, the output AL stream first reveals all vertices in V𝑉V and then all those in V′superscript𝑉′V^{\\prime}. All adjacencies of these vertices are present in the stream, as all the adjacencies were present in the input stream. We can see that this uses two passes and 𝒪~~𝒪\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1) bits of memory (to remember what pass we are in, and to read an edge). It is trivial that the bipartite graph B𝐵B is constructed correctly, as for every edge (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y) we output the edges (x,y′)𝑥superscript𝑦′(x,y^{\\prime}) and (x′,y)superscript𝑥′𝑦(x^{\\prime},y). Before we continue to find the maximum matching in such a graph B𝐵B produced by Lemma 6.3, we need a few observations to restrict the size of the matching we want to find. The output sets C0subscript𝐶0C_{0} and V0subscript𝑉0V_{0} of [8, Algorithm NT] are used by Chen et al.  to produce a 2​k2𝑘2k kernel. The sets C0subscript𝐶0C_{0} and V0subscript𝑉0V_{0} output by [8, Algorithm NT] are such that C0subscript𝐶0C_{0} together with a minimum vertex cover on G​[V0]𝐺delimited-[]subscript𝑉0G[V_{0}] forms a minimum vertex cover for G𝐺G, and any minimum vertex cover for G​[V0]𝐺delimited-[]subscript𝑉0G[V_{0}] includes at least |V0|/2subscript𝑉02|V_{0}|/2 vertices. From the conversion of these sets to a 2​k2𝑘2k kernel by Chen et al. , we can conclude that it must be that |V0|≤2​k−2​|C0|subscript𝑉02𝑘2subscript𝐶0|V_{0}|\\leq 2k-2|C_{0}| (as this shows the kernel size). But then it must also be that |V0|+|C0|≤2​ksubscript𝑉0subscript𝐶02𝑘|V_{0}|+|C_{0}|\\leq 2k, and, as V0subscript𝑉0V_{0} and C0subscript𝐶0C_{0} together include all vertices in the found minimum vertex cover in B𝐵B (which has the same size as the maximum matching in B𝐵B, see [13, Page 74, Theorem 5.3]). To find the maximum matching we execute a DFS procedure, which can be done with surprising efficiency in this restricted bipartite setting. Given a bipartite graph B𝐵B as an AL stream with 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k) vertices, we can find a maximum matching of size at most 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k) using 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) passes and 𝒪~​(k)~𝒪𝑘\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k) bits of memory. For the EA model this can be done in 𝒪​(k3)𝒪superscript𝑘3\\mathcal{O}(k^{3}) passes. We first use a pass to find a maximal matching M𝑀M in the graph. This can be done in a single pass because we can construct a maximal matching in a greedy manner, picking every edge that appears in the stream for which both vertices are unmatched. Then, we iteratively find an M𝑀M-augmenting path P𝑃P (a path starting and ending in a unmatched vertices, alternating between edges in and not in M𝑀M), and improve the matching by switching all edges on P𝑃P (i.e., remove from M𝑀M the edges on P𝑃P in M𝑀M, and add to M𝑀M the edges on P𝑃P not in M𝑀M). Note that any such P𝑃P has length 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k), as otherwise M𝑀M would exceed size 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k). It is known that a matching M𝑀M in a bipartite graph is maximum when there is no M𝑀M-augmenting path [ref]41. We can also find an M𝑀M-augmenting path only 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k) times, as the size of the matching increases by at least 1 for each M𝑀M-augmenting path. Let us now describe how we find an M𝑀M-augmenting path, given some matching M𝑀M of size 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k). We find M𝑀M-augmenting paths by executing a Depth First Search (DFS) from each unmatched vertex. Note that we alternate between traversing edges in M𝑀M and not in M𝑀M in this search. In contrary to a normal DFS, we do not save which vertices we visited, as this would cost too much memory. Instead, we mark edges in M𝑀M as visited, together with the vertex from which we started the search. If an edge e∈M𝑒𝑀e\\in M has been visited once in the search tree, there is no need to visit it again, as the search that visited e𝑒e would have found an M𝑀M-augmenting path containing e𝑒e if it exists. Let us discuss the exact details on the size of the search tree and recursion. As any M𝑀M-augmenting path has length at most 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k), the depth of the search tree is also 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k). Looking at any vertex, it might have 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) neighbours in the given bipartite graph. However, only 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k) of its neighbours can be in M𝑀M. As visiting an unmatched vertex must end the M𝑀M-augmenting path, the search tree size is only increased by visiting matched vertices. Therefore, the search comes down to the following process. From the initial unmatched vertex, we can explore to at most 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k) vertices (those in the matching) or any unmatched vertex which would end the search. If we explore to a matched vertex, the next step must traverse the edge in the matching to make an M𝑀M-augmenting path, which is deterministic. Then we again can explore to 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k) matched vertices, or any unmatched vertex which would end the search. This process continues. As we only visit each matched vertex at most once, we can see that the number of vertices the search visits is bounded by 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k). In each node along the currently active path of the search tree, we can keep a counter with value ≤𝒪​(k2)absent𝒪superscript𝑘2\\leq\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) (using 𝒪​(log⁡(k2))=𝒪​(log⁡k)𝒪superscript𝑘2𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(\\log(k^{2}))=\\mathcal{O}(\\log k) bits) to keep track of what edge we consider next. These counters take up 𝒪​(k⋅log⁡k)=𝒪~​(k)𝒪⋅𝑘𝑘~𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k\\cdot\\log k)=\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k) space. In any node, if we wish to consider the next edge incident to a vertex v𝑣v with a counter value x𝑥x, we inspect the x𝑥x-th edge incident to v𝑣v in the stream. If it turns out we cannot visit that vertex (have already visited it), we can increment the counter and find the next edge to consider in the same pass (as the (x+1)𝑥1(x+1)-th edge incident to v𝑣v must be later in the stream than the x𝑥x-th edge incident to v𝑣v). Therefore, finding the next edge to visit in the search only takes a single pass. Notice that we return to nodes in the search tree at most 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k) times in total, because only visiting matched vertices can result in a ‘failed’ search recursion. So, a search that visits all matched vertices uses 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k) passes, and this is the maximum number of passes for a single search. We start our search at most once from each unmatched vertex that has at least one edge (for which we can keep another counter to keep track), which means we do at most 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) searches. However, for each of these searches we start from different vertices, we still keep saved the set of visited matched vertices. If a search from a vertex visits a matched vertex and does not find an M𝑀M-augmenting path, then neither will a search from a different vertex by visiting that matched vertex again. In particular, this is because the graph is bipartite, because, when we start from an unmatched vertex on e.g. the ‘right’ side, we have to end on an unmatched vertex on the ‘left’ side, while all vertices we visit on the path are matched vertices. So, the current path does not interfere with the ability to successfully find an endpoint, which makes another search visiting the same matched edge have exactly the same result. Having to do 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) searches would indicate that we need to use 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) passes, at least one for every search. However, in the AL model, if we consider the x𝑥x-th vertex, and in the pass we use for it, we do no successful visit to a vertex (all adjacencies are matched and already visited), then in the same pass we can consider the (x+1)𝑥1(x+1)-th vertex, because all edges incident to the (x+1)𝑥1(x+1)-th vertex in the stream appear later than the edges incident to the x𝑥x-th vertex in the stream. Hence, in the AL model, over all 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) starting vertices, we only use 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k) passes, because only (partially) successful searches increase the number of passes, and we can only visit 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k) vertices in total. In the EA model, we require at least one pass for each vertex we want to start searching from, and so the total number of passes is 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}). We conclude that with 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k) passes in the AL model, and 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) passes in the EA model, and 𝒪~​(k)~𝒪𝑘\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k) bits of memory we can execute a DFS to find an M𝑀M-augmenting path (if it exists). As mentioned, we can search for an M𝑀M-augmenting path only 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k) times, as the existence of more M𝑀M-augmenting paths would result in returning NO. Therefore, we can find a maximum matching in B𝐵B using 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) passes and 𝒪~​(k)~𝒪𝑘\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k) bits of memory in the AL model. In the EA model, we require 𝒪​(k3)𝒪superscript𝑘3\\mathcal{O}(k^{3}) passes to accomplish this. Next, we show how to convert such a maximum matching as found by Theorem 6.5 into a minimum vertex cover for B𝐵B, as asked by [8, Algorithm NT], for which we can use a DFS procedure as in Theorem 6.5 as a subroutine. Given a bipartite graph B𝐵B as an AL stream and a maximum matching M𝑀M of size 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k), we can find a minimum vertex cover X𝑋X for B𝐵B with |X|=|M|𝑋𝑀|X|=|M|, using 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k) passes and 𝒪~​(k)~𝒪𝑘\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k) bits of memory. For the EA model, this takes 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) passes. We adapt a theorem by Bondy and Murty [13, Page 74, Theorem 5.3] to the streaming setting to achieve this lemma. Let us shortly go over what it entails. If our bipartite graph has vertex sets V,V′𝑉superscript𝑉′V,V^{\\prime} and a maximum matching M𝑀M, then we can find a minimum vertex cover X𝑋X with |X|=|M|𝑋𝑀|X|=|M| in the following manner. Denote all unmatched vertices in V𝑉V with U𝑈U, and let Z⊆V∪V′𝑍𝑉superscript𝑉′Z\\subseteq V\\cup V^{\\prime} be the set of vertices connected to U𝑈U with an M𝑀M-alternating path (a path such that edges in M𝑀M and not in M𝑀M alternate). If S=Z∩V𝑆𝑍𝑉S=Z\\cap V and T=Z∩V′𝑇𝑍superscript𝑉′T=Z\\cap V^{\\prime}, then X𝑋X is given by X=(V∖S)∪T𝑋𝑉𝑆𝑇X=(V\\setminus S)\\cup T. As T⊆X𝑇𝑋T\\subseteq X and |X|=|M|𝑋𝑀|X|=|M|, we can find and save T𝑇T by executing a DFS procedure just like in Theorem 6.5, without exceeding 𝒪~​(k)~𝒪𝑘\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k) bits of memory. This takes 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k) passes in the AL model and 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) passes in the EA model, and 𝒪~​(k)~𝒪𝑘\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k) bits of memory. Also, V∖S𝑉𝑆V\\setminus S must only contain matched vertices, as U⊆S𝑈𝑆U\\subseteq S. Therefore, in the same DFS procedure to find T𝑇T, we can also save for every matched vertex in V𝑉V if it is reachable through an M𝑀M-alternating path. Then V∖S𝑉𝑆V\\setminus S is simply given by all matched vertices in M𝑀M for which we did not save that they were reachable. We conclude that we can find X𝑋X, the minimum vertex cover such that |X|=|M|𝑋𝑀|X|=|M|, in 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k) passes (AL model) or 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) passes (EA model) and 𝒪~​(k)~𝒪𝑘\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k) bits of memory. The final result is as follows, which consists of putting the original stream through each step for every time we require a pass, i.e. the number of passes of each of the parts of this theorem combine in a multiplicative fashion. Given a graph G𝐺G as an AL stream, we can produce a kernel of size 2​k2𝑘2k for the Vertex Cover [k𝑘k] problem using 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) passes and 𝒪~​(k)~𝒪𝑘\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k) bits of memory. In the EA model, this procedure takes 𝒪​(k3)𝒪superscript𝑘3\\mathcal{O}(k^{3}) passes. We execute Theorem 6.5 on the stream produced by applying Theorem 6.1 and then Lemma 6.3 on the input stream (we have to apply these transformations every time that we require a pass). Notice that these applications increase the number of passes by a constant factor. On the result of Theorem 6.5 we apply Lemma 6.7 to obtain a minimum vertex cover for the specific bipartite graph B𝐵B. As described by Bar-Yehuda and Even [8, Algorithm NT], the sets C0subscript𝐶0C_{0} and V0subscript𝑉0V_{0} can be computed from this minimum vertex cover. This computation is a simple process, where C0subscript𝐶0C_{0} contains the vertices v𝑣v for which both v,v′∈B𝑣superscript𝑣′𝐵v,v^{\\prime}\\in B are contained in the minimum vertex cover of B𝐵B, and V0subscript𝑉0V_{0} contains the vertices v𝑣v where either v,v′∈B𝑣superscript𝑣′𝐵v,v^{\\prime}\\in B is contained in the minimum vertex cover of B𝐵B, but not both. Finding C0subscript𝐶0C_{0} and V0subscript𝑉0V_{0} from B𝐵B and its minimum vertex cover requires no passes over the stream, as they are simply given by analysing the minimum vertex cover of B𝐵B. These sets C0subscript𝐶0C_{0} and V0subscript𝑉0V_{0} are exactly the sets in the theorem by Nemhauser and Trotter , and, as described by Chen et al. , we can use them to obtain a 2​k2𝑘2k kernel for vertex cover. The kernel is given by G′=G​[V0]superscript𝐺′𝐺delimited-[]subscript𝑉0G^{\\prime}=G[V_{0}], which we can find with a pass (we can output the kernel as a stream), and parameter k′=k1−|C0|superscript𝑘′subscript𝑘1subscript𝐶0k^{\\prime}=k_{1}-|C_{0}|, where k1subscript𝑘1k_{1} is the parameter after application of Theorem 6.1. All in all, this process takes 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) (AL) or 𝒪​(k3)𝒪superscript𝑘3\\mathcal{O}(k^{3}) (EA) passes and 𝒪~​(k)~𝒪𝑘\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k) bits of memory.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: P𝑃P has length 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k), as otherwise M𝑀M would exceed size 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k). It is known that a matching M𝑀M in a bipartite graph is maximum when there is no M𝑀M-augmenting path [ref]41. We can also find an M𝑀M-augmenting path only 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k) times, as the size of the matching increases by at least 1 for each M𝑀M-augmenting path.
