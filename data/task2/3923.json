      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Representation via Dynamic Feature Aggregation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe adversarial attacks seriously threaten the application of CNN based models in security-critical scenarios. To address the problem, extensive studies have been proposed, which can be briefly categorized into training with or without the adversarial samples. In particular, Goodfellow et al. [ref]11 proposed the adversarial training, in which CNN based model is directly trained on adversarial samples. The adversarially trained model can withstand strong attacks, but leads to some new challenges, such as high computational cost 8 and over-fitting . Although recent studies 5 8   attempted to mitigate the issues, their performances are still unsatisfactory.\nTherefore, defensing without using adversarial samples is gradually considered as a more promising research line. For example, the deep ensemble approach  creates an ensemble by training multiple models of the same architecture with different initializations. Since the adversarial attacks cannot simultaneously spoof multiple models effectively, the ensemble model yielded by deep ensembles naturally gains the excellent robustness against adversarial attacks. However, the method, which needs to train multiple models, causes an extremely high computational cost.\nAnother research line for attack defensing focuses on editing the input data to alleviate the influence caused by adversarial perturbations. These methods are generally based on randomized smoothing , random transformation  and image compression . Under the white-box setting, these defense methods fail to achieve competitive performances, especially in the case that attack methods consider the combination of viewpoint shifts, noise, and other transformations .\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: scenarios.
