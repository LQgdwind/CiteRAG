      "content": "Paper Title: Online Budgeted Matching with General Bids\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOBM originates from the online bipartite matching problem defined by  30 years ago.\nIn 2007,  generalized the online b-matching problem to OBM (a.k.a. Adwords) . Under the special case of small bids,  proposes an algorithm that achieves the competitive ratio of 1‚àí1/e11ùëí1-1/e, which is also the optimal competitive ratio under the small-bid setting . In the same year,  provides the primal-dual algorithm and analysis for OBM under the small-bid assumption and achieves the competitive ratio of 1‚àí1e11ùëí1-\\frac{1}{e}. Subsequently,  gives a randomized primal-dual analysis for online bipartite matching and generalizes it to OBM.\nIn addition, OBM has also been studied under the stochastic settings    [ref]14 . It is known to be very challenging to go beyond the small-bid assumption and develop a non-trivial competitive ratio for OBM with general bids in an adversarial setting.\nRecently, [ref]30 points out the inherent difficulty of OBM with general bids and explains the necessity of the assumption of FLM is needed in easing up the challenges. With the FLM assumption, a greedy algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio of 1/2121/2. Additionally, a deterministic algorithm proposed in  achieves a competitive ratio of (1‚àíŒ∫‚àí1‚àíŒ∫(1+Œ∫)1/Œ∫)1ùúÖ1ùúÖsuperscript1ùúÖ1ùúÖ(1-\\kappa-\\frac{1-\\kappa}{(1+\\kappa)^{1/\\kappa}}), increasing the competitive ratio when the maximum bid-budget ratio Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa is no larger than 0.170.170.17.\nSome other works on OBM with FLM employ randomized algorithm designs. For example,\n proposes a semi-random algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio of 0.5016, which is known as the best competitive ratio achieved by randomized algorithms up to now.\nBesides, [ref]30 extends the random algorithm of Ranking to OBM and achieves a competitive ratio of 1‚àí1/e11ùëí1-1/e with a strong assumption of the ‚Äùfake‚Äù budget. Moreover,  proposes a randomized algorithm without the knowledge of budget for the FLM setting with competitive ratio 11+Œ∫‚Äã(1‚àí1e)11ùúÖ11ùëí\\frac{1}{1+\\kappa}(1-\\frac{1}{e}) parameterized by the maximum bid-budget ratios Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa, which relies on a strong assumption that the bids are decomposable (i.e. wu,t=wu‚ãÖwtsubscriptùë§ùë¢ùë°‚ãÖsubscriptùë§ùë¢subscriptùë§ùë°w_{u,t}=w_{u}\\cdot w_{t}). Despite the progress on the OBM settings with FLM, OBM without FLM has remained an open challenge except for under the small-bid assumption.\nThe recent study [ref]30 points out that OBM without FLM is difficult because when the offline node has less leftover budget than the bid value of an online arrival, the offline node is not allowed to be matched to the arrival, potentially causing a loss equivalent the leftover budget.\n considers multi-tier budget constraints with a laminar structure and provides a competitive ratio without FLM, but the result does not apply to the settings without the laminar structure.\nAdditionally,  proves an online randomized algorithm with the competitive ratio (in expectation) upper bound of 0.612, an upper bound for deterministic algorithms is still lacking to formally evaluate the difficulty of OBM without FLM.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: Subsequently,  gives a randomized primal-dual analysis for online bipartite matching and generalizes it to OBM.\nIn addition, OBM has also been studied under the stochastic settings    [ref]14 . It is known to be very challenging to go beyond the small-bid assumption and develop a non-trivial competitive ratio for OBM with general bids in an adversarial setting.\nRecently, [ref]30\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
