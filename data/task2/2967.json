      "content": "Paper Title: Policy Optimization for Constrained MDPs with Provable Fast Global Convergence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, there has been much study of the global convergence properties of policy gradient methods. It has been shown that PG and NPG methods can achieve 𝒪​(1/T)𝒪1𝑇\\mathcal{O}(1/T) convergence [ref]22  for unregularized MDPs. When entropy regularization is used, both PG and NPG methods can guarantee exp​(−T)exp𝑇\\text{exp}(-T) convergence [ref]22 [ref]10 to the optimal solution of the regularized problem. NPG methods can be interpreted as mirror descent  5, thereby enabling the adaptation of mirror descent techniques to analyze NPG-based methods. The global convergence analysis of the PG methods for MDPs has also been extended to CMDPs.  proposed the NPG-PD algorithm which uses a primal-dual approach with NPG and showed that it can achieve 𝒪​(1/T)𝒪1𝑇\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T}) global convergence for both the optimality gap and the constraint violation.  proposed a primal approach called constrained-rectified policy optimization (CRPO), which updates the policy alternatively between optimizing objective and decreasing constraint violation, and enjoys the same 𝒪​(1/T)𝒪1𝑇\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T}) global convergence. Our work focuses on achieving a faster convergence rate for the CMDP problem, motivated by the results for MDPs with a convergence rate faster than 𝒪​(1/T)𝒪1𝑇\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T}) (see Table 1). In the work conducted concurrently with ours, but with different results, Ying et al. 2 and Li et al. [ref]19 address the same question of developing PG-based algorithms for the CMDP problem. Ying et al. 2 propose an NPG-aided dual approach, where the dual function is smoothed by entropy regularization in the objective function. They show an 𝒪~​(1/T)~𝒪1𝑇\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/T) convergence rate to the optimal policy of the entropy-regularized CMDP, but not to the true optimal policy, for which with a slow 𝒪​(1/T)𝒪1𝑇\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T}) convergence rate. They also make an additional strong assumption that the initial state distribution covers the entire state space. While such an assumption was initially used in the analysis of the global convergence of PG methods for MDPs  [ref]22, it is not required when analyzing the global convergence of NPG methods  [ref]10. Moreover, this assumption does not necessarily hold for safe RL or CMDP, since the algorithm needs to avoid dangerous states even at initialization and the optimal policy will depend on the initial state distribution. Li et al. [ref]19 propose a primal-dual approach with an 𝒪​(log2⁡(T)/T)𝒪superscript2𝑇𝑇\\mathcal{O}(\\log^{2}(T)/T) convergence rate to the true optimal policy by smoothing the Lagrangian with suitable regularization on both primal and dual variables. However, they assume that the Markov chain induced by any stationary policy is ergodic in order to ensure the smoothness of the dual function. This assumption, though weaker than the assumption made by 2, will generally not hold in problems where one wants to avoid unsafe states altogether. In this work, we propose an algorithm with a faster 𝒪​(log⁡(T)/T)𝒪𝑇𝑇\\mathcal{O}(\\log(T)/T) convergence rate to the true optimal policy without such assumptions. Moreover, we also present two important extensions of our approach to the settings with zero constraint violation and sample-based estimation.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: Recently, there has been much study of the global convergence properties of policy gradient methods.
