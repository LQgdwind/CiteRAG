      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable Consensus Protocols for PoW based Blockchain and blockDAG\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA GHOST (Greedy Heaviest Observed Sub-tree) rule was proposed in , where, instead of the longest chain consensus rule, the path of the subtree with the combined hardest PoW is chosen. A variant of the GHOST protocol was used in the Ethereum blockchain 3. However, the TPS for this protocol is still relatively less  and susceptible to attacks described in . A SPECTRE protocol is proposed in , which builds with the concept of the blockDAG structure of the ledger. This protocol describes the ordering of the blocks in the DAG based on the pairwise voting procedure. The pairwise ordering relation is not transitive, and it does not always give the complete linear ordering of the blocks due to the Condorcet paradox 6. Smart contracts are the general computations on a particular task between two or more parties in the network. In order to achieve the consensus on the computations, smart contracts need linear ordering of the blocks/transactions.\nEven though the TPS is much higher than  and , SPECTRE is not suitable for smart contract applications. A PHANTOM protocol is proposed in 0 based on similar lines of SPECTRE, where, instead of pairwise ordering in SPECTRE, maximum k-cluster subDAG algorithm followed by ordering algorithm were proposed in PHANTOM. While, PHANTOM gives high transaction throughput and total ordering the blocks. However, there is a trade-off between the anti-cone size parameter k and confirmation times and also susceptible to liveness attack described in 7. A blockchain or DAG protocol based on delayed rewards proposed in 8 to address security against double-spend attacks. The protocol creates a staking mechanism similar to proof-of-stake by delaying the rewards and also punishes the attacker using fraud-proofs by slashing or eliminating the miner’s future rewards. A permissioned blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric, was proposed in 9 with Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) distributed consensus protocol for running distributed applications. PBFT achieves high transaction throughput but is limited to only a few nodes due to communication overhead. A cryptocurrency for the Internet of Things called IOTA, which is scalable, lightweight, and Quantum secure, was proposed in [ref]20 based on the DAG structure of transactions. However, the initial IOTA project [ref]20 does not design with a smart contract layer. The IOTA team has built the smart contracts on layer-2  as off-chain smart contracts.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: but is limited to only a few nodes due to communication overhead.
