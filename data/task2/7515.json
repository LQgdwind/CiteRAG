      "content": "Paper Title: Label Informed Contrastive Pretraining for Node Importance Estimation on Knowledge Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNode Importance Estimation (NIE) aims to infer the significance or popularity of nodes in a graph, which has been applied to many applications such as web searching and resource allocation  [ref]2  . One of well-known methods to the NIE problem might be PageRank , which has been used in Google to rank web pages. PageRank employs random walks to simulate surfing the World Wide Web until convergence, so that the stationary probability of visiting a page can be assigned as its importance score. Besides, many random walk-based   and centrality-based    [ref]2 NIE methods have been proposed in the literature. It is worth noting that these early NIE methods are designed for the graph where nodes and edges belong to the same type respectively. Due to the availability of richer structured data and knowledge 0 1 2 3, recent research interests of NIE have been dedicating to Knowledge Graphs (KG) for predicting future or missing importance scores of the interested nodes in a KG 4  5  6 in which nodes and edges belong to multiple types respectively, and the triplet (head node, relational edge, tail node) expresses real-world knowledge. 4 extends PageRank by incorporating multi-relational data to directly infer scores for both nodes and edges. More recently, the state-of-the-art performance has been achieved by the end-to-end training, which first builds a trainable model to include structure and/or knowledge in KG, and then optimizes the trainable model parameters using the labels of available node importance  5 . Despite the success of these trainable NIE methods on the real-world KG datasets, they treat every interested nodes equally before training. However, the potential real-world prior knowledge is that the nodes with higher importance often require or receive more attention, e.g., people may care more about the movies or webpages with higher importance. In other words, the correct importance estimation for higher importance nodes is usually more significant than that for lower importance nodes. As a result, this work tries to properly inject such prior knowledge into NIE methods. Inspired by the recent advances of pretraining paradigm 7 8 9, we introduce Label Informed ContrAstive Pretraining (LICAP) to inject the prior knowledge into NIE methods, so that the NIE methods can be better aware of the nodes with higher importance. As LICAP is introduced in pretraining stage, it can be easily collaborated with the existing NIE models that need the pretrained embeddings as the input features to the model. Specifically, LICAP employs a novel type of contrastive learning framework that intends to make fully use of the continuous labels of samples. It is worth mentioning that contrastive learning has been mainly applied to discrete labels and classification problems, rather than continuous labels and regression problems. To this end, we transform the NIE regression problem into a classification-like problem by dividing the continuous labels of samples into bins and meanwhile maintaining the order among bins. To help NIE methods better realize the nodes with higher importance, LICAP adopts a novel sampling strategy called top nodes preferred hierarchical sampling to generate contrastive training samples. It first groups all interested nodes into a top bin and a non-top bin based on the continuous node importance scores. Second, the nodes within the top bin are further grouped into several finer bins also based on the scores. The contrastive samples for the two hierarchical grouping are generated respectively from the top bin against non-top bin and the finer bins within top bin. After that, a newly proposed Predicate-aware Graph Attention Networks (PreGAT) for knowledge graphs is applied to pretrain node embeddings, so as to better separate the top nodes from non-top nodes, and distinguish the top nodes within top bin by keeping the relative order among the finer bins. The pretrained embeddings, carrying the desirable prior knowledge, can be finally fed to the downstream NIE model. The main contributions of this work are fivefold: (1) LICAP is introduced during pretraining stage for being better aware of higher important nodes, which can be easily collaborated with existing NIE methods. (2) To pretrain node embeddings via contrastive learning, a novel sampling strategy called top nodes preferred hierarchical sampling is proposed to utilize the continuous labels, so that the NIE regression problem is transformed into the classification-like problem in which the contrastive learning is applicable. (3) A new type of graph attention networks is developed to also include relational information, i.e., predicates, to better pretrain node embeddings on knowledge graphs. (4) Extensive experiments on three real-world knowledge graphs demonstrate that the LICAP pretrained embeddings can further boost the performance of existing NIE methods and achieve the new state-of-the-art performance regarding both regression and ranking metrics.
