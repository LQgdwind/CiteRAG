      "content": "Paper Title: Focus on Impact: Indoor Exploration with Intrinsic Motivation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExploration Results.\nAs a first step, we perform model selection using the results on the Gibson Val split (Table¬†I). Our agents have different hyperparameters that depend on the implementation for the pseudo-counts. When our model employs grid-based pseudo-counts, it is important to determine the dimension of a single cell in this grid-based structure. In our experiments, we test the effects of using G√óGùê∫ùê∫G\\times G squared cells, with G‚àà{2,4,5,10}ùê∫24510G\\in\\{2,4,5,10\\}. The best results are obtained with G=5ùê∫5G=5, with small differences among the various setups.\nWhen using pseudo-counts based on a density model, the most relevant hyperparameters depend on the particular model employed as density estimator. In our case, we need to determine the number of bins BùêµB for PixelCNN, with B‚àà{64,128,256}ùêµ64128256B\\in\\{64,128,256\\}. We find out that the best results are achieved with B=128ùêµ128B=128. Gibson Val MP3D Val MP3D Test In Table¬†II, we compare the Impact (Grid) and Impact (DME) agents with the baseline agents previously described on the considered datasets. For each model and each split, we test 5 different random seeds and report the mean result for each metric. For the sake of readability, we do not report the standard deviations for the different runs, which we quantify in around 1.2% of the mean value reported.\nAs it can be seen, results achieved by the two proposed impact-based agents are constantly better than those obtained by the competitors, both for T=500ùëá500T=500 and T=1000ùëá1000T=1000.\nIt is worth noting that our intrinsic impact-based reward outperforms strong extrinsic rewards that exploit information computed using the ground-truth layout of the environment.\nMoreover, the different implementations chosen for the pseudo-counts affect final performance, with Impact (DME) bringing the best results in terms of AS and Impact (Grid) in terms of IoU metrics.\nFrom the results it also emerges that, although the proposed implementations for the pseudo-count in Eq.¬†7 lead to comparable results in small environments as those contained in Gibson and MP3D Val, the advantage of using DME is more evident in large, complex environments as those in MP3D Test. In Fig.¬†3, we report some qualitative results displaying the trajectories and the area seen by different agents\nin the same episode. Also from a qualitative point of view, the benefit given by the proposed reward in terms of exploration trajectories and explored areas is easy to identify. PointGoal Navigation.\nOne of the main advantages of training deep modular agents for embodied exploration is that they easily adapt to perform downstream tasks, such as PointGoal navigation¬†[ref]3. Recent literature¬†[ref]7 [ref]9 has discovered that hierarchical agents trained for exploration are competitive with state-of-the-art architecture tailored for PointGoal navigation and trained with strong supervision for 2.52.52.5 billion frames¬†. Additionally, the training time and data required to learn the policy is much more limited (2 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller).\nIn Table¬†III, we report the results obtained using two different settings. The noise-free pose sensor setting is the standard benchmark for PointGoal navigation in Habitat¬†[ref]3. In the noisy pose sensor setting, instead, the pose sensor readings are noisy, and thus the agent position must be estimated as the episode progresses.\nWe consider four main metrics: the average distance to the goal achieved by the agent (D2G) and three success-related metrics. The success rate (SR) is the fraction of episodes terminated within 0.20.20.2 meters from the goal, while the SPL and SoftSPL (sSPL) weigh the distance from the goal with the length of the path taken by the agent in order to penalize inefficient navigation.\nAs it can be seen, the two proposed agents outperform the main competitors from the literature: Active Neural Slam (ANS)¬†[ref]7 and OccAnt¬†[ref]9 (for which we report both the results from the paper and the official code release). When comparing with our baselines in the noise-free setting, the overall architecture design allows for high-performance results, as the reward influences map estimation only marginally. In fact, in this setting, the global policy and the pose estimation module are not used, as the global goal coincides with the episode goal coordinates, and the agent receives oracle position information. Thus, good results mainly depend on the effectiveness of the mapping module.\nInstead, in the noisy setting, the effectiveness of the reward used during training influences navigation performance more significantly. In this case, better numerical results originate from a better ability to estimate the precise pose of the agent during the episode.\n\nFor completeness, we also compare with the results achieved by DD-PPO¬†, a method trained with reinforcement learning for the PointGoal task on 2.52.52.5 billion frames, 500500500 times more than the frames used to train our agents. Real-world Deployment.\nAs agents trained in realistic indoor environments using the Habitat simulator are adaptable to real-world deployment¬† , we also deploy the proposed approach on a LoCoBot robot333https://locobot-website.netlify.com. We employ the PyRobot interface¬† to deploy code and trained models on the robot.\nTo enable the adaptation to the real-world environment, there are some aspects that must be taken into account during training. As a first step, we adjust the simulation in order to reproduce realistic actuation and sensor noise. To that end, we adopt the noise model proposed in¬†[ref]7 based on Gaussian Mixture Models fitting real-world noise data acquired from a LoCoBot. Additionally, we modify the parameters of the RGB-D sensor used in simulation to match those of the RealSense camera mounted on the robot. Specifically, we change the camera resolution and field of view, the range of depth information, and the camera height. Finally, it is imperative to prevent the agent from learning simulation-specific shortcuts and tricks. For instance, the agent may learn to slide along the walls due to imperfect dynamics in simulation¬†. To prevent the learning of such dynamics, we employ the bump sensor provided by Habitat and block the agent whenever it is in contact with an obstacle.\nWhen deployed in the real world, our agent is able to explore the environment without getting stuck or bumping into obstacles.\nIn the video accompanying the submission, we report exploration samples taken from our real-world deployment.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: PointGoal Navigation.\nOne of the main advantages of training deep modular agents for embodied exploration is that they easily adapt to perform downstream tasks, such as PointGoal navigation¬†[ref]3.
