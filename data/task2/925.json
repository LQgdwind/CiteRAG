      "content": "Paper Title: RefVOS: A Closer Look at Referring Expressions for Video Object Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur model is assessed for LVOS on DAVIS-2017 and A2D. In both cases, each video frame is treated separately, so we use the same architecture as in the still image experiments from Section 5.1. Our experiments on the DAVIS-2017 validation set are reported in Table 3. All models are pre-trained on RefCOCO.\nResults are provided with the J&F metric adopted in the DAVIS-2017 challenge for the two different types of REs collected by Khoreva et al.  explained in Section 2. J&F is the average between a region-based evaluation measure (J) and a contour-based one (F).\nOur experiments indicate that our baseline model trained only with RefCOCO already outperforms the best model by Khoreva et al. , despite the latter being fine-tuned on the same DAVIS-2017 dataset (+Ft DAVIS segms.).\nThe difference increases when our model is fine-tuned with the segmentations provided in the training set, but freezing the language encoder.\nThis is the configuration comparable to Khoreva et al.  in terms of training data, and brings gains of 2.7 and 4.9 points for the first frame and full video REs, respectively.\nFinally, we also fine-tune the BERT language encoder, obtaining a significant extra gain in performance.\nWe want to highlight that our frame-based model does not rely on any post-processing to add temporal coherence, or optical flow, in contrast to Khoreva et al. , so our method may be more efficient computationally. We also compare our model to URVOS [ref]34, a concurrent work to ours. RefVOS performs slightly better when trained with the same amount of annotated data. Qualitative results for full video REs are shown in Figure 1. When the multiple objects belong to different categories, the model works produces accurate masks from the language query, whereas it is more challenging to properly segment the referent in cases where there are multiple instances of the same class in the sequence (3rd row). The fine-tuning is done with the full video REs, and the REs shown in Figure 1 are of the same kind. We note how the referred object is in general identified and properly segmented. The results for A2D are shown in Table 4, using the metrics that allow us a comparison with previous works  [ref]36.\nOur model trained only with A2D already outperforms Gavrilyuk et al.  in Precision at a high threshold and at the Overall and Mean Intersection Over Union (IoU).\nMoreover, our model significantly increases its performance when it is first trained on RefCOCO and later fine-tuned on A2D, both its visual and language branches. In this setup, it achieves state of the art results in all metrics by significant margins. Note that both Gavrilyuk et al.  and Wang et al. [ref]36 leverage an encoder pre-trained on the Kinetics dataset, which includes 650,000 video clips . Hence, these models see a large amount of annotated data for action recognition in videos.\nWe also want to stress our high Precision values at high thresholds, which indicates that our model is able to produce very accurate masks.\nVisualizations with our model are illustrated in Figure 6. In conclusion, RefVOS is state of the art for DAVIS-2017 and A2D on the LVOS task, although it is a frame-based model. This motivates the analysis of our model when tested with different types of REs, based on the categorization and difficulty analysis proposed in Section 4. REs Analysis: Firstly, we analyze the performance on trivial and non-trivial linguistic phrases for both the A2D test and DAVIS-2017 validation sets.\nThe mean IoU per referent obtained for trivial and non-trivial for DAVIS-2017 is 48.7 vs. 46.2, and for A2D is 53.9 vs. 33.2.\nWe observe that the performance is worse for the non-trivial cases for both datasets as expected, with a major drop on A2D. Secondly, we study the effect of RE categories in relation to the performance of RefVOS.\nThe A2Dre+ dataset described in Section 4.3 allows us to have the same number of referents for all major categories: appearance, location, motion and static.\nEach of our referents is annotated with highly similar REs (two for each category) and thus are directly comparable.\nIn contrast, Khoreva et al.  split the videos into two different subsets with non-comparable referents.\nTable 5 compares the performance of RefVOS depending whether each of the categories is present in the RE.\nThe results show that the presence of appearance and location categories yields significantly higher results compared to their absence.\nWe also observe a drop in performance when the static category is present, which indicates that the model struggles at identifying a referent based on static actions such as holding, sitting, eating.\nIn contrast, the presence or absence of the motion category does not affect the performance, which actually means that the model is unable to benefit from this type of REs. Finally, in Table 6 we study the effect of feeding the model with only the actor, the action, or the actor and action, without formulating any RE, for all the test set of A2D.\nThese actor and action terms are obtained from\nthe dataset collected by Gavrilyuk et al. .\nIn most cases these expressions are not REs as they do not unambiguously describe the referent in the video.\nAdditionally, we consider a generic phrase thing. We distinguish between the trivial and non-trivial cases.\nResults show that RefVOS works significantly better when the actor is provided than when the action is. Furthermore, performance improves when using both. Finally, having the full linguistic phrase is still the best model. Remarkably, our configuration with actor and action reaches higher Overall IoU than previous works that use complete linguistic phrases (see Table 4).\nNotice that using the full phrase improves performance especially for the non-trivial cases, as these require complete linguistic expressions to identify the referent. We also want to stress that the aggregated performance, i.e., considering all cases, is dominated by the performance of the trivial ones, as they represent most of the dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: not rely on any post-processing to add temporal coherence, or optical flow, in contrast to Khoreva et al. , so our method may be more efficient computationally. We also compare our model to URVOS [ref]34, a concurrent work to ours. RefVOS performs slightly better when trained with the same amount of annotated data.
