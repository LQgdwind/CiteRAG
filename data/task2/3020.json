      "content": "Paper Title: Survey of Deep Learning Methods for Inverse Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAn inverse problem    seeks to formulate the solution to estimating the unknown state underlying a measured system. Specifically, a forward function F​(⋅)𝐹⋅F(\\cdot) describes the relationship of the measured output as a function of the system state z¯¯𝑧\\underline{z}, subject to a measurement noise ν¯¯𝜈\\underline{\\nu}.\nThe objective of the inverse problem is to estimate z¯¯𝑧\\underline{z} as a function of given measurement m¯¯𝑚\\underline{m}, assuming a detailed knowledge of the system, F​(⋅)𝐹⋅F(\\cdot), where if F​(⋅)𝐹⋅F(\\cdot) is not known or is partially known the problem becomes blind or semi-blind . Different perspectives lead to different types of inverse problems. From the perspective of data type, two classes of inverse problems are restoration and reconstruction , where restoration problems have the same domain for measurement and state (e.g., signal or image denoising), while reconstruction has different domains (e.g., 3D shape inference). Next, from the perspective of modeling, inverse problems are classified into static and dynamic problems, where the static case seeks a single estimate z¯^¯^𝑧\\underline{\\hat{z}}, consistent with some prior model on z¯¯𝑧\\underline{z} and the forward model F​(z¯)𝐹¯𝑧F(\\underline{z}), whereas the dynamic case seeks estimates z¯^​(t)¯^𝑧𝑡\\underline{\\hat{z}}(t) over time, consistent with an initial prior and a dynamic model. In this paper we will examine each of these inverse problems. Existing analytical methods for solving inverse problems take advantage of domain knowledge to regularize and constrain the problem to obtain numerically-stable solutions. These methods are classified into four categories : Analytic inversion, having the objective of finding a closed form, possibly approximate, of F−1superscript𝐹1F^{-1}. This category of solutions will be highly problem dependent. Iterative methods, which optimize the data inconsistency term Because of the ill-posed nature of most inverse problems, the iteration tends to have a semi-convergent behaviour, with the reconstruction error decreasing until some point and then diverging, necessitating appropriate stopping criteria. Discretization as regularization, including projection methods searching for an approximate solution of an inverse problems in a predefined subspace. Choosing an appropriate subspace has high impact on finding stable solutions. Variational methods, with the idea of minimizing data consistency penalized using some regularizer R𝑅R parameterized by θ𝜃\\theta: This is a generic adaptable framework where F​(⋅),R​(⋅,⋅)𝐹⋅𝑅⋅⋅F(\\cdot),R(\\cdot,\\cdot) are chosen to fit a specific problem, of which well-known classical examples include Tikhonov  and total variation  regularization. These approaches have weaknesses in requiring explicitly identified prior knowledge, selected regularizers, some shortcomings in handling noise, computational complexity in inference due to the optimization-based mechanisms, and most significantly limited applicability, in the sense that each inverse problem needs to be solved one-off. As a result, we are highly motivated to consider the roles of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which have the advantages of being generic data driven methods, are adaptable to a wide variety of different problems, and can learn prior models implicitly through examples.\nDNNs are currently in widespread use to solve a vast range of problems in machine learning [ref]8, artificial intelligence , and computer vision 0. Strong advantages of using such structures include their near-universal applicability, their real-time inference 1 2, and their superiority in handling sensor and/or measurement noise 3. A variety of studies 4  have shown that planned, systematic DNNs will tend to have fewer parameters and better generalization power compared to generic architectures, which motivates us to consider systematic strategies in addressing complex inverse problems. In principle, every deep learning framework could be interpreted as solving some sort of inverse problem, in the sense that the network is trained to take measurements and to infer, from given ground truth, the desired unknown state. For example, for the common DNN application to image classification, the input is a (measured) image, and the network output is a (unknown state) label, describing the object or scene appearing in the image. The network parameters then implicitly learn the inverse of the forward model, which had been the generation of an image from a label. Using DNNs for solving inverse problems aims to approximate the inverse of the forward model . In some cases, the forward model may be explicitly defined 5 6 4, whereas in other cases it may be implicitly defined in the form of the training data 7 8 9 0 5 1 2. In this paper our focus is on solving non-blind inverse problems, with the forward model known. Analytical approaches to inverse problems, whether deterministic or stochastic, take advantage of the explicit forward model and prior knowledge in formulating the solution; in contrast, DNNs cannot take advantage of such information, and must instead learn implicitly from large datasets of training data in a black-box approach. Inspired by the above techniques, there are indeed a number of proposed deep frameworks in the literature with the aim of bringing regularization techniques or prior knowledge into the DNN learning process for solving inverse problems 4 6 3 4 5 6.\nIn this paper, we classify deep solutions for inverse problems into three categories based on their objective criteria, and compare them in solving different types of inverse problems.\nThe focus of this paper is comparing the robustness of different deep learning structures based on their optimization criterion associated with the training scheme; that is, the main objective of this research is to provide insight into the choice of appropriate framework, particularly with regards to performance robustness. It is worth noticing here that our goal is not to outperform the state-of-the-art performance in different problems, rather to examine different frameworks with fair parameter settings and performing at least as well as existing analytical approaches. Using these frameworks, we select a prototype inverse problem from each category and evaluate the performance and the robustness of the designed frameworks. We believe the results obtained in this way give insight into the strength of each solution category in addressing different categories of inverse problems. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 includes a review of the most recent deep approaches to solving inverse problems; Section 3 describes the problem definition, introducing three main categories for deep solutions for inverse problems; Section 4 explains the experimental results including robustness analysis; finally Section 6 concludes the paper, proposing the best approach based on our experiments.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: adaptable to a wide variety of different problems, and can learn prior models implicitly through examples.\nDNNs are currently in widespread use to solve a vast range of problems in machine learning [ref]8, artificial intelligence , and computer vision 0.
