      "content": "Paper Title: Characterization of Noise using variants of Unitarity Randomized Benchmarking\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe first of the randomized benchmarking protocols introduced was the Standard Randomized Benchmarking (SRB)          . In this protocol, the metric used to quantify the gate error is the infidelity of the noise channel. Infidelity is calculated from the fidelity measurement with respect to the identity channel of a quantum channel arising from the average noise associated with a given gate set (preferably a unitary 2-design ). The quantum channel is constructed by applying a sequence of noisy gates from the gate set with the final gate inverting all the random gates applied before it, so that ideally (i.e., without noise) the quantum channel should be ab identity channel. Several variants of the SRB protocol have been proposed that benchmark the same metric but in different contexts     . Interleaved randomized benchmarking (IRB)  protocol benchmarks the average error rate for a given computational gate as compared to the average error for a gate set. Other variants of IRB can be found in  . Real randomized benchmarking (RRB) measures the average gate infidelity for a restricted gate set that is not a unitary 2-design   . Direct randomized benchmarking (DRB) benchmarks the performance of a gate set made of native gates present in a given quantum computing platform, i.e., the gates which have specific default instructions for their physical implementation readily available in the platform and which together form a gate set capable to perform universal quantum computation. This gate set usually does not form a unitary 2-design (or its subgroup) , etc.   . In general SRB protocols are based on the assumption of gate-independent noise. However, methods for analyzing the noise of a gate set without this assumption is studied in  . SRB protocol for benchmarking noise in logical qubits, i.e., quantum processors with error correction schemes at the lowest level of its architecture has also been proposed in . However, none of the actual quantum processors employ error correction principles for reliable quantum computing. In SRB or its variants, infidelity quantifies the average error rate induced by the noisy gates. However, infidelity is unable to characterize the noise in terms of its coherence, i.e., the extent to which the noise acts as a unitary channel. Unitarity  is a metric to measure the coherence in an arbitrary noise channel. Unitarity randomized benchmarking (URB)      protocol benchmarks the quality of a noise channel based on this metric. For a unitary noise channel, the upper bound on the worst-case error rate with respect to diamond norm scales as the square root of the average gate infidelity, whereas for Pauli channels (which are non-unitary channels) it scales linearly [ref]34. Since, based on the coherence of the noise, the actual error per gate scales with average infidelity differently for different noise channels, to that extent the effectiveness of the average infidelity to quantify the ‘quality’ of gates applied in a quantum circuit is also limited. In particular, one can only qualitatively know whether the noise channel is unitary or not based on the scaling of the worst case error rate with the average infidelity, but the protocol does not provide a metric to ‘quantify’ the unitary nature of a noise channel. Unitarity is one such metric calculated via the URB protocol. Such a metric is useful in benchmarking the ‘quality’ of various physical implementations of a specific gate in a given processor (or across processors). It can also be useful for example, in quantitatively studying the effect of the connectivity between qubits in a processor, on the incoherence introduced in a multi-qubit gate by calculating the unitarity of the gate applied to different qubit subsystems. For these reasons, we are interested in the characterization of noise based on the coherence of the errors induced by different noise channels and therefore we hope that URB can aid in investigating the gate errors in practical quantum computation. Another interpretation of unitarity is that it is the variance of the gate fidelity with respect to a gate set drawn from a unitary 2-design . However, in this paper, we follow the definition by Wallman et al. , since we later propose two modifications to the URB protocol which does not require a gate set but still follows the general definition of unitarity as proposed in .\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: on the worst-case error rate with respect to diamond norm scales as the square root of the average gate infidelity, whereas for Pauli channels (which are non-unitary channels) it scales linearly [ref]34.
