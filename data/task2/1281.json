      "content": "Paper Title: Majority Opinion Diffusion in Social Networks: An Adversarial Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNumerous opinion diffusion models have been introduced to investigate how a group of agents modify their opinions under the influence of other agents. It is usually assumed that for a graph G𝐺G, which represents a social network, initially some nodes are colored black (positive) or white (negative). Then, nodes update their color based on some predefined rule. Among these models, the threshold and majority model are perhaps the closest to ours. In both of them, initially each node is black or white. In the majority model , in each round all nodes simultaneously update their color to the most frequent color in their neighborhood (and no update in case of a tie). In the threshold model [ref]32, each node v𝑣v has a threshold value tvsubscript𝑡𝑣t_{v} and it becomes black as soon as it has at least tvsubscript𝑡𝑣t_{v} black neighbors. We should emphasize that different variants of these models have been considered; for example, asynchronous updating rule , various tie-breaking rules 2, random threshold values [ref]32, and with a bias toward one of the colors . Even more complex models such as the ones considered in 0 and , which follow an averaging-based updating rule, or the models in , , , 9, and  can be seen as extensions of the majority model. Consider a marketer which advertises a new product. Assume that it can convince a subset of agents to adopt a positive opinion about its product, e.g., by giving them free samples of the product, and it aims to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions. Which agents should it target? A node set A𝐴A is a target set if black color eventually takes over all (or half) of nodes once A𝐴A is fully black. (This is sometimes also known as dynamic monopoly or percolating set.) For both the majority and threshold model, the minimum size of a target set has been extensively studied on various classes of graphs such as lattice 4, Erdős-Rényi random graph 4, random regular graphs 5, power-law random graphs , expander graphs , and bipartite graphs 8. Furthermore, Berger  proved that there exist arbitrarily large graphs which have target sets of constant size under the majority model and it was shown in  that every n𝑛n-node graph has a target set of size at most n/2𝑛2n/2 under the asynchronous variant. Furthermore, it is known that the problem of finding the minimum size of a target set for a given graph G𝐺G is NP-hard for different variants of these models. For the majority model, Mishra, Radhakrishnan, and Sivasubramanian  proved that this problem cannot be approximated within a factor of log⁡Δ​log⁡log⁡ΔΔΔ\\log\\Delta\\log\\log\\Delta, unless P=NP; however, there is a polynomial-time log⁡ΔΔ\\log\\Delta-approximation algorithm. For the threshold model, Chen 4 proved that the problem is NP-hard even when all thresholds tvsubscript𝑡𝑣t_{v} are 1 or 2 and G𝐺G is a bounded-degree bipartite graph. On the other hand, the problem is traceable for special classes of graphs such as trees. We study a similar optimization problem in our setting and provide inapproximability results. Many other adversarial scenarios where an attacker aims to engineer the output of an opinion diffusion process have been investigated. For example, assume that an attacker can manipulate almost half of initially colored nodes to choose black color in a random or deterministic manner, similar to our attacker models. Which graph structures are resilient to such attacks, i.e., at the end of the process the white color is still the dominant color? For the majority model, it was proven in  that a graph is resilient if it is a clique or very close to a clique. In  similar results were provided for the asynchronous setting. For our majority-based model, we prove that expansion, regularity, and maximum degree are chiefly responsible for resilience. Other kinds of attackers with various manipulation powers, such as adding/deleting edges or changing the order of updates, have been considered, cf. 2, 7, and 6. Moreover, the complexity of the problem of finding an optimal strategy for different types of attackers has been studied, cf. 8, 6, and 1. In the majority model, since the updating rule is deterministic, the process eventually reaches a cycle of colorings. The length of this cycle and the number of rounds the process needs to reach it are called the periodicity and stabilization time of the process, respectively. It was proven in 7 that periodicity is always one or two. Recently, it was shown in 5 and 2 that it is PSPACE-complete to decide whether the periodicity is one or not for a given coloring of a directed graph. Regarding the stabilization time, Fogelman, Goles, and Weisbuch 1 showed that it is bounded by 𝒪​(n2)𝒪superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2}\\right). It was proven in 3 that this bound is tight, up to some poly-logarithmic factor. It was shown in  that the problem of determining whether there exists a coloring for which the process takes at least t𝑡t rounds is NP-complete. As mentioned, we provide tight bounds and hardness results on the stabilization time of our diffusion process.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: or white. In the majority model , in each round all nodes simultaneously update their color to the most frequent color in their neighborhood (and no update in case of a tie). In the threshold model [ref]32, each node v𝑣v has a threshold value tvsubscript𝑡𝑣t_{v} and it becomes black as soon as it has at least tvsubscript𝑡𝑣t_{v} black neighbors.
