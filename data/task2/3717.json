      "content": "Paper Title: An Overview & Analysis of Sequence-to-Sequence Emotional Voice Conversion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeq2seq learning was initially proposed for machine translation by  and has since proved its competitiveness in several natural language processing tasks¬†  .\nSeq2seq models consist of two main modules: the encoder and the decoder.\nUnlike the decoder taking the output of the encoder like in a standard autoencoder model¬†, seq2seq models generate the prediction of the timestep tùë°t by using the prediction of the timestep t‚àí1ùë°1t-1 as the input of the decoder¬†.\nTherefore, seq2seq models are able to generate outputs with different, variable length.\nConventional EVC, from the basic neural network architecture¬† to the recent research with GANs¬†  , applied frame-to-frame conversion on the spectrum and prosody, which indicates that the converted speech has the same length with the source speech.\nHowever, one of the vital characteristic of emotion expression is speech rate¬†, which cannot be expressed within the fixed length obtained by using the frame-to-frame EVC¬†[ref]20.\nMeanwhile, the dependency between the spectrum and prosody leads to respective conversion mistakes, such as the mismatch when doing a separate study on them¬†[ref]21. Furthermore, the emotional expression in an utterance often shows only on part of the utterance (e.‚Äâg.‚Äâin only some, but not all, words).\nSeq2seq models can naturally handle this requirement by adding attention¬†, which makes it possible to focus on only those relevant parts¬†[ref]23.\nFor these reasons, seq2seq models show promising performance compared to conventional methods. To summarise, there are three main advantages of seq2seq EVC models: Seq2seq models are able to learn feature mapping, alignment, and duration prediction simultaneously; Seq2seq models avoid mistakes caused by the respective mapping of spectrum and prosody; The attention mechanism helps seq2seq models focus on the emotionally emphasised parts in the utterance. On the other hand, seq2seq training always requires a large-sized dataset¬†.\nMoreover, the training data should be parallel, which means the same content should be expressed in different emotion categories by the same speaker ‚Äì a requirement not necessary for other models, like GANs¬† .\nThis represents the major challenge for such models, which has so far prevented the seq2seq paradigm from becoming the dominant one in the field of EVC.\nAs a result, at the time of writing, only 6 papers exist which use seq2seq EVC¬†  [ref]21  [ref]20 [ref]23.\nThese works constitute the background material for this review, and will be comprehensively analysed in the following sections.\nTable¬†1 contains the important information in a condensed form.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: with the source speech.\nHowever, one of the vital characteristic of emotion expression is speech rate¬†, which cannot be expressed within the fixed length obtained by using the frame-to-frame EVC¬†[ref]20.\nMeanwhile, the dependency between the spectrum and prosody leads to respective conversion mistakes, such as the mismatch when doing a separate study on them¬†[ref]21. Furthermore, the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
