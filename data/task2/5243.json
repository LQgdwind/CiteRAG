      "content": "Paper Title: BKinD-3D: Self-Supervised 3D Keypoint Discovery from Multi-View Videos\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n3D Pose Estimation. There has been a large body of work studying 3D human pose estimation from images or videos, as reviewed in  , with recent works also focusing on 3D animal poses    [ref]26 .\nMost of these methods are fully supervised from visual data   , with some models perform lifting starting from 2D poses    .\nWe focus our discussion on multi-view 3D pose estimation methods, but all of these models require either 3D or 2D supervision during training.\nThis 2D supervision is typically in the form of pre-trained 2D detectors , or ground truth 2D poses 5.\nIn comparison, our method uses multi-view videos to discover 3D keypoints without 2D or 3D supervision. Methods more closely related to our work are those that also leverage multi-view structure to estimate 3D pose (Table 1).\n proposed a supervised method that uses learnable triangulation to aggregate 2D information across views to 3D.\nHere we study similar approaches for representing 3D information, but using self-supervision instead of supervised 3D annotations.\nOther methods in this space propose training methods such as enforcing consistency of predicted poses across views , regression to 3D pose estimated from epipolar geometry of multi-view 2D , constraining 3D poses to project to realistic 2D pose , or estimates camera parameters using detected and ground truth 2D poses 5.\nWhile we also leverage multi-view information, our goal is different from the work above, in that our approach aims to discover 3D poses without 2D or 3D supervision, given camera parameters. Self-supervised Keypoint Discovery.\n2D keypoint discovery has been studied from images [ref]21 9  and videos  3.\nOur approach focuses on behavioral videos, similar to 3, but we aim to use multi-view information to discover 3D keypoints, instead of 2D.\nMany approaches use an encoder-decoder setup to disentangle appearance and geometry information 9 [ref]21  3.\nOur setup also consists of encoders and decoders, but our encoder maps information across views to aggregate 2D information into a 3D geometry bottleneck.\nThe discovery model most similar to our approach is Keypoint3D , which discovers 3D keypoints for control from virtual agents, using a combination of image reconstruction and reinforcement learning.\nHowever, this setup is designed for simulated data and does not translate well to real videos, since updating the keypoints through a reinforcement learning policy requires videos generated through the simulated environment.\nKeypoint discovery models typically represent discovered parts as 2D Gaussian heatmaps [ref]21 3 or 2D edges .\nWhile we also use an edge-based representation, our edges are in 3D, which enables our training objective to enforce joint length consistency. Behavioral Video Analysis.\nPose estimation is a common intermediate step in automated behavior quantification; behavioral videos are commonly captured with stationary camera and background, with moving agents.\nTo date, supervised 2D pose estimators are most often used for analyzing behavior videos    2  0.\nHowever, 2D pose estimation is inadequate for many applications: it cannot reliably capture the angle of joints for kinematics, fails to generalize across views, is sensitive to occlusion, and cannot incorporate body plan constraints as skeleton length or range of motion of joints.\nThus, there has recently been an accelerating trend to study behavior in 3D [ref]26   .\nThese models typically require more expensive 3D training annotations compared to 2D poses.\nWhile 2D self-supervision has been studied for behavioral videos 3, 3D keypoint discovery in real-world behavioral videos have not been well-explored.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: 3D Pose Estimation.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
