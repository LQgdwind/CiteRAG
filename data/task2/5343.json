      "content": "Paper Title: Universal Detection of Backdoor Attacks via Density-based Clustering and Centroids Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost of the defence methods working at the training-data-set level rely on clustering and on the analysis of the feature representations or activation patterns.\nOne of the earliest and most popular approach\nis the Activation Clustering (AC) method\n.\nBy focusing on corrupted-label attacks, the AC method analyses the feature representation of the samples\nof each class of the training dataset, and clusters them, in a reduced dimensionality space, via the KùêæK-means (K=2ùêæ2K=2) algorithm¬†.\nUnder the hypothesis that a benign class tends to form a homogeneous cluster in the feature space, and by noticing that when KùêæK-means is forced to identify two clusters in the presence of only one homogeneous cluster, it tends to split it into two equally-sized clusters, the data samples of a class are judged to be poisoned on the basis of the relative size of the two clusters identified by KùêæK-means. If the size of the two clusters is similar, the class is considered to be benign, otherwise, the class is judged to be poisoned. Finally, AC labels the samples of the smallest cluster as poisoned samples. The method works under the assumption that the fraction of poisoned samples (hereafter referred to as the poisoning ratio) in a poisoned class is lower than the number of benign samples. On the other hand, given that KùêæK-means does not work well in the presence of clusters with very unbalanced sizes , AC does not perform well when the poisoning ratio is very small, as it often happens in practice with corrupted-label attacks, thus limiting the applicability of AC. Xiang et al.¬† presented the Cluster Impurity (CI) method, which works under the assumption that the triggering signal used by the attacker can be removed by an average filter.\nSpecifically, given the training samples of one class, CI analyses their feature representation and groups the samples into KùêæK clusters by exploiting the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithm¬†. The number of clusters KùêæK is determined by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)¬†[ref]15. To determine whether one cluster includes poisoned samples or not, CI average filters all the cluster samples and observes if the classification of these samples change. Thanks to this intuition, CI can still work when the number of poisoned samples in the poisoned class is larger than the number of benign samples.\nFor the same reason, CI only works against corrupted-label attacks, given that in a clean-label setting the prediction made by the network on the filtered samples would not change.\nMoreover, the applicability of CI is limited to specific kinds of triggering signals,\nthat is, triggers with high-frequency components, that can be removed via a low pass filter (like an average filter). In 2021, Tang et al.  proposed a so-called Statistical Contamination Analyser (SCAn),\nthat relies on the Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm\nto decompose the\nrepresentation of an image/object into an identity and a variation part. They argue that while the representations of samples from different (benign) classes have different identities, they share the same intra-variation distribution. Based on this intuition, SCAn estimates the intra-variation from a benign dataset, and uses it to define a statistical hypothesis test to judge whether a given class is contaminated (H1) or not (H0).\nIf H1 occurs, SCAn splits the representations into two groups via Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).\nA limitation of SCAn is that it fails to defend against sample-specific attacks,\nas shown in [ref]17, likely due to a different intra-variability for the poisoned class when sample-specific triggers are considered. To overcome the limitation of , [ref]17 proposed a system, named Beatrix, to detect poisoned samples via anomaly detection. Similarly to ,[ref]17 exploits the availability of a small amount of benign data. In particular, it computes the Gram matrix\nto derive class statistics from the benign samples. The deviation of the feature points of the input sample from the Gramian feature representation for the class is measured to detect the anomalies induced by the poisoned samples. However, since the entries of Gram matrix can be viewed as the inner product of two vectors, it suffers from the curse of dimensionality, and so when the feature dimensionality is large the performance of Beatrix drops111Our experiments reveal that Beatrix fails when the dimensionality of the feature representation is large, i.e., >9000absent9000>9000).. While there are other defences working at the training-dataset level,\nmost of them assume that the defender has some additional, often unrealistic, knowledge about the backdoor attack.\nFor instance, the method introduced in , and its strengthened version described in , exploit singular value decomposition (SVD) [ref]20 to reveal the anomalous samples contained in the training dataset, assuming that an upper-bound of the fraction of poisoned samples is known. Shan et al.¬† successfully developed a trackback tool to detect the poisoned data, but assume that the defender can successfully identify at least one poisoned sample at test time.\nMoreover, some defences only target a specific kind of backdoor attack. For instance,  aims at defending against clean-label backdoor attacks by exploiting feature collision.\nRecently,   proposed two methodologies to train a backdoor-free model from a poisoned dataset, exploiting randomised smoothing  and adversarial training . The same goal is accomplished in  where a training methodology is\nproposed to learn deconfounded representations for reliable classification, by relying on the minimization of the mutual information between the to-be-trained model and backdoored model (obtained by training for some epochs on the poisoned dataset).\nFinally,  utilises self-attention to purify the backdoored model, exploiting the relationship in the structural information between shallow and deep layers characterising benign models.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: and groups the samples into KùêæK clusters by exploiting the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithm¬†. The number of clusters KùêæK is determined by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)¬†[ref]15. To determine whether one cluster includes poisoned samples or not, CI average filters all the cluster samples and observes if the classification of these samples change.
