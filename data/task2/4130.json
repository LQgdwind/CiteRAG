      "content": "Paper Title: GraphMLP: A Graph MLP-Like Architecture for 3D Human Pose Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n3D Human Pose Estimation.\nThere are mainly two categories to estimate 3D human poses.\nThe first category of methods directly regresses 3D human joints from RGB images   .\nThe second category is the 2D-to-3D pose lifting method [ref]1  , which employs an off-the-shelf 2D pose detection as the front end and designs a 2D-to-3D lifting network using detected 2D poses as input.\nThis lifting method can achieve state-of-the-art performance and has become the mainstream method due to its efficiency and effectiveness.\nFor example, FCN [ref]1 shows that 3D poses can be regressed simply and effectively from 2D keypoints with fully-connected networks.\nTCN  extends the FCN to video by utilizing temporal convolutional networks to exploit temporal information from 2D pose sequences.\nLiu et al.  incorporate the attention mechanism into TCN to enhance the modeling of long-range temporal relationships across frames.\nSRNet  proposes a split-and-recombine network that splits the human body joints into multiple local groups and recombines them with a low-dimensional global context. Since the physical skeleton topology can form a graph structure, recent progress has focused on employing graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to address the 2D-to-3D lifting problem.\nLCN  introduces a locally connected network to improve\nthe representation capability of GCN.\nSemGCN  allows the model to learn the semantic relationships among the human joints.\nMGCN  improves SemGCN by introducing a weight modulation and an affinity modulation. Transformers in Vision.\nRecently, Transformer-based methods achieve excellent results on various computer vision tasks, such as image classification   , object detection   , and pose estimation [ref]36 [ref]19  .\nThe seminal work of ViT  divides an image into 16×16161616{\\times}16 patches and uses a pure Transformer encoder to extract visual features.\nStrided Transformer  incorporates strided convolutions into Transformers to aggregate information from local contexts for video-based 3D human pose estimation.\nPoseFormer [ref]19 utilizes a pure Transformer-based architecture to model spatial and temporal relationships from videos.\nMHFormer  proposes a Transformer-based framework with multiple plausible pose hypotheses.\nMesh Graphormer [ref]36 combines GCNs and attention layers in a serial order to capture local and global dependencies for human mesh reconstruction. Unlike [ref]36, we mainly investigate how to combine more efficient architectures (i.e., modern MLPs) and GCNs to construct a stronger architecture for 3D human pose estimation and adopt a parallel manner to make it possible to model local and global information at the same time.\nMoreover, different from previous video-based methods [ref]19   that treat each frame as a token for temporal modeling, we mix features across all frames and maintain each joint as a token, which makes the network to be economical and easy to train. MLPs in Vision.\nModern MLP models are proposed to reduce the inductive bias and computational cost by replacing the complex self-attentions of Transformers with spatial-wise linear layers    .\nMLP-Mixer  firstly proposes an MLP-Like model, which is a simple network architecture containing only pure MLP layers.\nCompared with FCN [ref]1 (i.e., conventional MLPs), this architecture introduces some modern designs, e.g., layer normalization (LN) , GELU , mixing spatial information.\nMoreover, ResMLP  proposes a purely MLP architecture with the Affine transformation.\nCycleMLP  proposes a cycle fully-connected layer to aggregate spatial context information and deal with variable\ninput image scales.\nHowever, these modern MLP models have not yet been applied to 3D human pose estimation. Inspired by their successes in vision, we first attempt to explore how MLP-Like architectures can be used for 3D human pose estimation in non-Euclidean skeleton data.\nThe difference between our approach and the existing MLPs is that we introduce the inductive bias of the physical skeleton topology by combining MLP models with GCNs, providing more physically plausible and accurate estimations.\nWe further investigate applying MLP-Like architecture in video and design an efficient video representation, which is seldom studied.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: are mainly two categories to estimate 3D human poses.\nThe first category of methods directly regresses 3D human joints from RGB images   .\nThe second category is the 2D-to-3D pose lifting method [ref]1  , which employs an off-the-shelf 2D pose detection as the front end and designs a 2D-to-3D lifting network using detected 2D poses as input.\nThis lifting method can achieve state-of-the-art\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
