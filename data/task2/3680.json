      "content": "Paper Title: Duality-Induced Regularizer for Semantic Matching Knowledge Graph Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPopular knowledge graph embeddings include distance-based, learning-based, and semantic matching models. Distance based models describe relations as relational maps between head and tail entities. Then, they use the Minkowski distance to measure the plausibility of a given triplet or quadruple. Lower distances correspond to higher plausibility of given triplets or quadruples.\nFor example, TransE  and its variants  [ref]9 represent relations as translations in vector spaces. They assume that a valid triplet (ui,rj,vk)subscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝑟𝑗subscript𝑣𝑘(u_{i},r_{j},v_{k}) satisfies ui,rj+rj≈vk,rjsubscriptu𝑖subscript𝑟𝑗subscriptr𝑗subscriptv𝑘subscript𝑟𝑗\\textbf{u}_{i,r_{j}}+\\textbf{r}_{j}\\approx\\textbf{v}_{k,r_{j}}, where ui,rjsubscriptu𝑖subscript𝑟𝑗\\textbf{u}_{i,r_{j}} and vk,rjsubscriptv𝑘subscript𝑟𝑗\\textbf{v}_{k,r_{j}} mean that entity embeddings may be relation-specific.\nStructured embedding (SE) [ref]13 uses linear maps to represent relations. Its score function is defined as s​(ui,rj,vk)=−‖Rj1​ui−Rj2​vk‖1𝑠subscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝑟𝑗subscript𝑣𝑘subscriptnormsuperscriptsubscriptR𝑗1subscriptu𝑖superscriptsubscriptR𝑗2subscriptv𝑘1s(u_{i},r_{j},v_{k})=-\\|\\textbf{R}_{j}^{1}\\textbf{u}_{i}-\\textbf{R}_{j}^{2}\\textbf{v}_{k}\\|_{1}. RotatE  defines each relation as a rotation in a complex vector space and the score function is defined as s​(ui,rj,vk)=−‖ui∘rj−vk‖1𝑠subscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝑟𝑗subscript𝑣𝑘subscriptnormsubscriptu𝑖subscriptr𝑗subscriptv𝑘1s(u_{i},r_{j},v_{k})=-\\|\\textbf{u}_{i}\\circ\\textbf{r}_{j}-\\textbf{v}_{k}\\|_{1}, where ui,rj,vk∈ℂksubscriptu𝑖subscriptr𝑗subscriptv𝑘superscriptℂ𝑘\\textbf{u}_{i},\\textbf{r}_{j},\\textbf{v}_{k}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{k} and |[r]i|=1subscriptdelimited-[]r𝑖1|[\\textbf{r}]_{i}|=1. ModE \nassumes that Rj1superscriptsubscriptR𝑗1\\textbf{R}_{j}^{1} is diagonal and Rj2superscriptsubscriptR𝑗2\\textbf{R}_{j}^{2} is an identity matrix. It shares a similar score function s​(ui,rj,vk)=−‖ui∘rj−vk‖1𝑠subscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝑟𝑗subscript𝑣𝑘subscriptnormsubscriptu𝑖subscriptr𝑗subscriptv𝑘1s(u_{i},r_{j},v_{k})=-\\|\\textbf{u}_{i}\\circ\\textbf{r}_{j}-\\textbf{v}_{k}\\|_{1} with RotatE but ui,rj,vk∈ℝksubscriptu𝑖subscriptr𝑗subscriptv𝑘superscriptℝ𝑘\\textbf{u}_{i},\\textbf{r}_{j},\\textbf{v}_{k}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{k}. Some works extend existing distance-based models to temporal KGs. For example, TTransE  extends TransE by learning timestamp embeddings. Inspired by TransH , HyTE [ref]17 projects entity and relation embeddings into the timestamp-specific hyperplanes. Learning-based models use neural networks—such as convolutional neural networks , capsule networks , and graph neural networks —to model the interaction among triplets or quadruples. Then, they use either inner products or distance functions to measure the plausibility of given triplets or quadruples. Semantic matching models usually formulate the KGC task as a third-order binary tensor completion problem.\nRESCAL  factorizes the j𝑗j-th frontal slice of 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} as 𝒳j≈ARj​A⊤subscript𝒳𝑗subscriptAR𝑗superscriptAtop\\mathcal{X}_{j}\\approx\\textbf{A}\\textbf{R}_{j}\\textbf{A}^{\\top}. That is, embeddings of head and tail entities are from the same space. As the relation specific matrices contain lots of parameters, RESCAL is prone to be overfitting. DistMult  simplifies the matrix RjsubscriptR𝑗\\textbf{R}_{j} in RESCAL to be diagonal, while it sacrifices the expressiveness of models and can only handle symmetric relations. In order to model asymmetric relations, ComplEx  extends DistMult to complex embeddings. Both DistMult and ComplEx can be regarded as variants of canonical decomposition (CP) , which are in real and complex vector spaces, respectively. Some works also extend semantic mathcing models to temporal KGs. For example, ConT  extends TuckER  by additionally learning timestamp embeddings. ASALSAN  use three-way DEDICOM  to express temporal relations, which shares similar ideas with RESCAL . Besides, TComplEx and TNTComplEx  reduce memory complexity by extending ComplEx to decomposition of the 4-order tensor. Compared with distance-based models, semantic matching knowledge graph embeddings are more time-efficient, as we can easily parallel the computation of linear transformations and inner products. Moreover, due to the property of inner products, semantic matching is good at modeling one-to-many/many-to-one/many-to-many relations. For example, given the entity embedding u and relation embedding r, we can find different entity embeddings visubscriptv𝑖\\textbf{v}_{i} such that (u,r,vi)𝑢𝑟subscript𝑣𝑖(u,r,v_{i}) have the same scores. In order to handle complex relations, distance-based models usually turn to relation-specific projection and further increase the computational burden.\nCompared with learning-based model, semantic matching knowledge graph embeddings are more time-efficient thanks to their simpler formulations. However, also due to the property of inner products, in semantic matching, entities with similar semantics may have dissimilar embeddings, which will degrade the knowledge graph completion performance. As introduced in Section 4.1, even if the embeddings of Laue and Schottky are orthogonal, the triples (Laue,StudiedIn,HU Berlin)LaueStudiedInHU Berlin({\\textbf{Laue}},{\\textbf{StudiedIn}},{\\textbf{HU Berlin}}) and (Schottky,StudiedIn,HU Berlin)SchottkyStudiedInHU Berlin({\\textbf{Schottky}},{\\textbf{StudiedIn}},{\\textbf{HU Berlin}}) are likely to have the same scores when the two entity embeddings have proper norms. Moreover, distance-based models are better at modeling properties of knowledge graphs than semantic matching. For example, RotatE  can handle composition of relations; HAKE  and MuRP  can model semantic hierarchies. It is worth noting that many general embedding learning methods are closely related to knowledge graph embeddings, all of which aim to optimize similarity between objects. For example, some graph embedding models    define similarity functions between nodes, and more generally, some feature embedding approaches    learn discriminative feature representations by optimizing similarity between samples. Different from these works, knowledge graph embeddings need to model complex relations between entities, leading to a more challenging problem.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: distance to measure the plausibility of a given triplet or quadruple.
