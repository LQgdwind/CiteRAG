      "content": "Paper Title: Tracking the Persistence of Harmonic Chains: Barcode and Stability\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHarmonic chains were first studied in the context of functions on graphs, where they were identified as the kernel of the Laplacian operator on graphs¬†.\nThe graph Laplacian and its kernel are important tools in studying graph properties, see¬† 0 for surveys.\nEckmann¬† introduced the higher-order Laplacian for simplicial complexes, and proved the isomorphism of harmonic chains and homology.\nGuglielmi et al.¬† studied the stability of higher-order Laplacians. Horak and Jost¬† defined a weighted Laplacian for simplicial complexes. Already their theoretical results on Laplacian¬† anticipated the possibility of applications, as the harmonic chains are thought to contain important geometric information.\nThis has been validated by recent results that use curves of eigenvalues of Laplacians in a filtration in data analysis¬† .\nThe Laplacian was applied to improve the mapper algorithm¬†, and for coarsening triangular meshes¬†.\nThe persistent Laplacian¬† and its stability¬†[ref]44 is an active research area.\nDue to the close relation of harmonic chains and Laplacians, harmonic chains could find applications in areas that Laplacians have been used.\nComputing reasonable representative cycles for persistent homology is also an active area of research.\nHere, usually an optimality criterion is imposed on cycles in a homology class to obtain a unique representative. For a single homology class, a number of works¬†  5       consider different criteria for optimality of cycles. Hardness of computing optimal representatives has been studied by¬†      5. For persistent homology, Dey et al.¬†5 studied the hardness of choosing optimal cycles for persistence bars.\nFurthermore, De Gregorio et al.¬† used harmonic cycles in a persistent homology setting to compute the persistence barcode. Lieutier¬† studied the harmonic chains in persistent homology classes, called persistent harmonic forms. Relation to the work of Basu and Cox.¬†¬†¬†The most relevant work to ours is the inspiring work of Basu and Cox¬†. Basu and Cox had a similar goal as ours, namely, to associate geometric information to each bar in order to obtain a more interpretable data feature. To that end, they introduced the notion of harmonic persistent barcode, by associating a subspace of harmonic chains to each bar in the ordinary persistence barcode. When the multiplicity of the bar is 1, the subspace is 1-dimensional. This is the space of harmonic chains that are born at sùë†s and die entering tùë°t. In general, this is a quotient subspace of harmonic chains at time sùë†s. Using orthogonality they can represent this subquotient as a subspace of the harmonic cycles at time sùë†s. As a result, they successfully assign a canonical harmonic cycle to a bar in the ordinary persistence diagram. We note that, in general, a bar in the persistence barcode cannot be represented using a single harmonic chain that remains harmonic during the lifetime of the bar. The harmonic cycle associated to a bar using the Basu-Cox approach is the initial harmonic representative of the bar, that is, the harmonic cycle that represents the bar at its birth. Basu and Cox also used the terminal harmonic cycle in some of their arguments, thus showing that the choice is not entirely canonical. However, Basu and Cox proved significant properties of the initial cycles in terms of what they call relative essential content. The novelty of our result is that, in contrast to¬†, we define a new barcode distinct from the ordinary persistence barcode, in which each bar has a harmonic cycle associated with it which is harmonic during the lifetime of the bar.\nBasu and Cox also proved stability for their harmonic persistent barcode, by considering subspaces as points of a Grassmannian manifold and measuring distances in the Grassmannian. Such a distance quantifies the angles between subspaces, whereas our notions of stability are stronger in the sense that they use the classical bottleneck distance analogous to the ordinary persistence homology.\nG√ºlen et al.¬† studied a method that permits the construction of stable persistence diagrams that are equipped with a canonical choice of representative cycles for filtrations over arbitrary finite posets. If the underlying poset is a finite subset of the real line, using persistent Laplacians, they obtained harmonic cycles connected (through a certain isomorphism) to those identified by Basu and Cox.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: of Laplacians in a filtration in data analysis¬† .\nThe Laplacian was applied to improve the mapper algorithm¬†, and for coarsening triangular meshes¬†.\nThe persistent Laplacian¬† and its stability¬†[ref]44 is an active research area.\nDue to the close relation of harmonic chains and Laplacians, harmonic chains could find applications in areas that Laplacians have been used.\nComputing reasonable\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
