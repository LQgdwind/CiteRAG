      "content": "Paper Title: TSEN: Transformer and Snowball Graph Convolution Learning for Brain Functional Network Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven a brain functional network, graph classification with GNNs typically learns a graph-level representation for graph classification. Graph-level representation learning with GNNs mainly includes graph pooling and coarsening method. The graph pooling methods usually use global pooling methods to read-out the graphs such as SAGPool [ref]6. The coarsening methods apply grouping nodes into similarity clusters to extract global representations, such as Diff-Pool  and Graclus multi-layer clustering . Recent works showed that more sophisticated layers for aggregating or read-out the graphs, such as clustering layers, may not bring any benefits on many real-world graph data . To capture better structure information for graph classification, GraphSAGE  used random edge sampling methods, Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN)  and subgraph isomorphism counting method  used graph isomorphism-based methods to achieve the ability as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Residual and dense connections   have demonstrated their great improvement in traditional neural networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the structures of residual and dense connection were also applied to GNN domain [ref]8  [ref]27 . Residual connections could mitigate the problem of over-smoothing and improve the performance of GNNs with deeper structure [ref]8 [ref]27. Dense connections use the structure of snowball connections and consiTSENtly up to more convolutional layers, and the snowball structure could concatenate multi-scale features incrementally . The multi-scale information of graphs could be helpful for enhancing the expressiveness of GNNs on graph classification   .\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Graph-level representation learning with GNNs mainly includes graph pooling and coarsening method.
