      "content": "Paper Title: Beyond Low-pass Filtering: Graph Convolutional Networks with Automatic Filtering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. We use six datasets: PUBMED, SBM-PATTERN, SBM-CLUSTER, Arxiv-year, YelpChi and Squirrel. PUBMED is a citation network consisting of 19,717 documents with 7 class labels. The feature of each document is a bag-of-words representation of dimension 500. We adopt the preprocessed version of PUBMED from DGL [ref]47. SBM-PATTERN and SBM-CLUSTER are synthesized graph datasets . They are generated by the stochastic block model with a probability pùëùp that two nodes are connected if they belong to the same community and a probability qùëûq that two nodes are linked if they fall into different communities. The node features of SBM-PATTERN and SBM-CLUSTER are uniformly generated from a vocabulary of {1,2,3}123\\{1,2,3\\}. The task of SBM-PATTERN is to predict whether a node belongs to a graph pattern. The task of SBM-CLUSTER is to classify nodes to their belonged clusters. For Arxiv-year, YelpChi and Squirrel, they are three non-homophilous graph datasets adopted from [ref]48. In a non-homophilous graph, connected nodes are not evidently more likely to share the same label. The summary statistics for these three datasets are provided in Table I. Experimental Settings.\nThe training loss for all three datasets is the cross-entropy loss. We report the averaged accuracy on test data over 5 runs with 5 different seeds. For PUBMED, in each run, the dataset is randomly split into train, valid, and test data by 60%, 20%, 20%. For SBM-PATTERN and SBM-CLUSTER, we follow the same data split as . For Arxiv-year, YelpChi, and Squirrel, we follow [ref]48 to split the datasets into train, valid, and test data with a ratio of 2:1:1. We utilize the validation set to select the best model among all epochs in each run. For PUBMED, the default hyperparameter setting is used for each baseline model. For SBM-PATTERN, we choose 4 layers for all methods with a fixed budget of around 100k parameters. For SBM-CLUSTER, we set 8 layers for all methods with a fixed budget of around 200k parameters. For Arxiv-year, YelpChi, and Squirrel, we set 2 layers for all methods with a fixed budget of around 100k parameters. Residual connections, batch normalizations, and graph size normalizations  are employed for all methods on SBM-PATTERN SBM-CLUSTER, Arxiv-year, Yelp-Chi, and Squirrel. This ensures all baseline methods do not face the over-smoothing problem when the model is deep. Other hyperparameter settings are provided in Appendix B. \nAll experiments are conducted using a single Titan XP GPU card. Baselines. We compare AutoGCN against nine methods: MLP, ChebNet , GCN [ref]21, SGC , DSGCN , APGCN , GIN , GraphSage , GAT , and MoNet . We use the DGL built-in implementations of graph convolutional layers for GCN, GraphSage, GAT and MoNet. For MLP and GIN, we adopt the implementations provided by Dwivedi et al. .\nFor ChebNet, we implement it with a second-order approximation and set Œªm‚Äãa‚Äãx=2subscriptùúÜùëöùëéùë•2\\lambda_{max}=2.\nFor DSGCN, we use its original TensorFlow implementation. Due to DSGCN does not provide a general rule to design customized graph convolutional filters for new datasets, we only test DSGCN on the PUBMED dataset with its default setting. Results & Discussion. Table II shows the experimental results for node classification tasks. On all datasets except SBM-PATTERN, AutoGCN significantly outperforms baseline methods that only work as a low-pass filter including GCN, SGC, GraphSage, and GAT. We observe that the experimental result of APGCN on SBM-PATTERN outperforms other baseline method. However, the performance of APGCN is not robust across all datasets. Besides, we observe that DSGCN does not perform well as expected on the PUBMED dataset. The same phenomenon also applies to GAT. In its original paper, GAT evidently outperforms GCN on PUBMED. However, our experiment shows a different conclusion. This is partly due to the original data split of PUBMED used by GAT and DSGCN is not big enough to evaluate graph neural network models. The original data split consists of 140 nodes for training, 500 nodes for validation, and 1000 nodes for testing [ref]21. Therefore, it may easily drive the design of graph neural networks to overfit the small dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: network consisting of 19,717 documents with 7 class labels.
