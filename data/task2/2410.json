      "content": "Paper Title: Visual Adversarial Imitation Learning using Variational Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent model-free imitation learning can be categorized as either adversarial or non-adversarial. Adversarial methods inspired by GANs  train an explicit classifier between expert and policy behaviour and optimize the agent in a two-player minimax game. GAIL  and AIRL  are two such algorithms; however they often have poor sample efficiency due to the requirement of on-policy rollouts in the environment. To address sample efficiency issues, off-policy variants such as DAC  and SAM  have been developed, however they suffer from an objective mismatch when using off-policy data [ref]35, often resulting in learning instability . An alternate line of research attempts to forego adversarial training: SQIL  frames the problem as regularized behaviour cloning and trains an off-policy algorithm with rewards of 1 for expert trajectories and 0 for policy ones. RCE  uses a very similar approach, but derives it through a different objective. ValueDICE [ref]35 uses the same key result for iterative distribution matching as RCE to obtain an off-policy distribution matching algorithm. In Swamy et al.  the authors derive distribution matching as a bound on policy under-performance, similar to our analysis in Section 3.1 and propose a practical non-adversarial algorithm AdVIL, however in reported experiments it does not outperform behaviour cloning. In Berseth et al.  the authors consider a variational encoder, which embeds expert video demonstrations in a latent space, and optimize a mis-match objective using on-policy model-free training. A few papers have considered model-based imitation learning as well: Baram et al.  is an adversarial algorithm conceptually similar to our approach, but only focuses on low-dimensional state-based tasks and train the discriminator using off-policy replay buffer, which does not allow it to generalize to new tasks. Related to our method is Finn et al.  which uses a similar reward learning in combination with a locally linear dynamics model, which leads to trajectory-centric algorithms that cannot transfer the model to new tasks. Das et al.  considers a similar setting for inverse RL using a simplified parameterization of the cost function. In this work we develop end-to-end model for adversarial imitation learning in high-dimensional POMDPs and generalization to novel tasks without hand-designed features.\nA related line of research is learning from observations alone (without access to expert actions). The BCO approach Torabi et al.  learns an inverse dynamics model to infer and copy expert actions, however it still suffers from the drawbacks of behaviour cloning. In a concurrent work  explore similar objective to  and VMAIL, using only states for training the discriminator objective, however they only focus on low dimensional domains. With a particular variational model specification VMAIL can be also be extended to work only with expert state observations, which we leave for further work. Finally, related to zero-shot imitation learning, concurrent work by Chang et al.  extends a model-based offline RL algorithm   to imitation learning. The focus in their work is primarily theoretical analysis, with empirical results in tasks with compact state representations. In contrast, our work aims to develop a stable and efficient imitation learning algorithm that can handle high-dimensional observation spaces (like visual inputs), in both online and offline learning settings. Reinforcement Learning From Images with Variational Models.\nReinforcement learning from images is an inherently difficult task, since the agent needs to learn meaningful visual representations to support policy learning. A recent line of research [ref]26  [ref]25   train a variational model of the image-based environment as an auxiliary task, either for representation learning only [ref]26 [ref]25 or for additionally generating on-policy data by rolling out the model . Our method builds upon these ideas, but unlike these prior works, considers the problem of learning from visual demonstrations without access to rewards.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: in the environment.
