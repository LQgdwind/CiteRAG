      "content": "Paper Title: How Powerful are 𝐾-hop Message Passing Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCurrently, most existing graph neural networks (GNNs) follow the message passing framework, which iteratively aggregates information from the neighbors and updates the representations of nodes. It has shown superior performance on graph-related tasks       [ref]7 comparing to traditional graph embedding techniques  . However, as the procedure of message passing is similar to the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test 0, the expressive power of message passing GNNs is also bounded by the 1-WL test [ref]7 1. Namely, GNNs cannot distinguish two non-isomorphic graph structures if the 1-WL test fails. In normal message passing GNNs, the node representation is updated by the direct neighbors of the node, which are called 1-hop neighbors. Recently, some works extend the notion of message passing into K𝐾K-hop message passing 2 3 4 5 6. K𝐾K-hop message passing is a type of message passing where the node representation is updated by aggregating information from not only 1st hop but all the neighbors within K𝐾K hops of the node. However, there is no work on theoretically characterizing the expressive power of GNNs with K𝐾K-hop message passing, e.g., whether it can improve the 1-hop message passing or not and to what extent it can. In this work, we theoretically characterize the expressive power of K𝐾K-hop message passing GNNs. Specifically, 1) we formally distinguish two different kernels of the K𝐾K-hop neighbors, which are often misused in previous works. The first kernel is based on whether the node can be reached within k𝑘k steps of the graph diffusion process, which is used in GPR-GNN 5 and MixHop 2. The second one is based on the shortest path distance of k𝑘k, which is used in GINE+ 6 and Graphormer 7. Further, we show that different kernels of K𝐾K-hop neighbors will result in different expressive power of K𝐾K-hop message passing. 2) We show that K𝐾K-hop message passing is strictly more powerful than 1-hop message passing and can distinguish almost all regular graphs. 3) However, it still failed in distinguishing some simple regular graphs, no matter which kernel is used, and its expressive power is bounded by 3-WL. This motivates us to improve K𝐾K-hop message passing further. Here, we introduce KP-GNN, a new GNN framework with K𝐾K-hop message passing, which significantly improves the expressive power of standard K𝐾K-hop message passing GNNs. In particular, during the aggregation of neighbors in each hop, KP-GNN not only aggregates neighboring nodes in that hop but also aggregates the peripheral subgraph (subgraph induced by the neighbors in that hop). This additional information helps the KP-GNN to learn more expressive local structural features around the node. We further show that KP-GNN can distinguish many distance regular graphs with a proper encoder for the peripheral subgraph. The proposed KP-GNN has several additional advantages. First, it can be applied to most existing K𝐾K-hop message-passing GNNs with only slight modification. Second, it only adds little computational complexity to standard K𝐾K-hop message passing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the KP-GNN framework through extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: the message passing framework, which iteratively aggregates information from the neighbors and updates the representations of nodes.
