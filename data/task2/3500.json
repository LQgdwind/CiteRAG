      "content": "Paper Title: Amodal Panoptic Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe introduce a total of six baselines for our proposed amodal panoptic segmentation task. We create the baselines by building upon the EfficientPS  model which is a state-of-the-art top-down panoptic segmentation network and replace its instance segmentation head with different existing amodal instance segmentation approaches. We choose the baseline’s amodal head based on two aspects: the relevance of existing architectures to our task and the complexity involved in adapting the approach for our purpose. Hence, we adopt the following five state-of-the-art amodal instance segmentation methods for the instance head of our baselines: ORCNN [ref]6, VQ-VAE [ref]12, Shape Prior [ref]36, ASN , and BCNet . We introduce an additional baseline called Amodal-EfficientPS in which we add an extra amodal mask prediction layer to the instance head of the EfficientPS architecture. We use the post-processing step described in  to compute the panoptic segmentation output. We first obtain the amodal mask for each instance in the panoptic segmentation output using the amodal mask logits channels associated with the corresponding instance ID. We then employ the sigmoid function on the selected amodal mask logits and threshold it at 0.50.50.5 to obtain the final amodal binary mask. The set of the amodal binary mask along with its class prediction and instance ID is concatenated with the panoptic segmentation output to yield the final amodal panoptic prediction. We describe each of the architectures of the baselines and the post-processing step in detail in the supplementary material.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: complexity involved in adapting the approach for our purpose.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
