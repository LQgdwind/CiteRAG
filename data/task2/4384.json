Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: RepBNN: towards a precise Binary Neural Network with Enhanced Feature Map via Repeating\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe impact of loss to weights is hard to be propagated backward through the partial derivative of the sign function that has an infinite gradient value at zero but a constant elsewhere\n. Thus the first BNN work [ref]4 estimated gradients of STE[ref]1 instead of the sign function during back-propagation. Bi-Real Net[ref]15 replaced STE with a piecewise linear function, which is a second-order approximation of the sign function. IR-Net employed Error Decay Estimator (EDE) to minimize information loss during the back propagation, thus ensured adequate updates at the beginning of training. RBNN proposed a training-aware approximation of the sign function \nfor gradient backpropagation. Real-to-Bindesigned a sequence of teacher-student pairs to bridge the architectural gap between real and binary networks. Lately ReActNet adopted a distribution loss that measures the distribution similarity between the binary and real-valued network. ReCU explored the effect of dead weights and introduced a rectified clamp unit (ReCU) to revive it. AdamBNN expounded the influence of Adam and weight decay when training BNNs and proposed a better training strategy. These recent work promoted the performance of BNNs to a significantly higher level than the first BNN [ref]4.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: loss to weights is hard to be propagated backward through the partial derivative of the sign function that has an infinite gradient value at zero but a constant elsewhere\n.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
