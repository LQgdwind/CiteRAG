      "content": "Paper Title: Sparse Approximate Multifrontal Factorization with Butterfly Compression for High Frequency Wave Equations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe hierarchically off-diagonal low-rank (HOD-LR) matrix representation is a special case of the more general class of ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} matrices. For HOD-LR every off-diagonal block is assumed to be low-rank, which corresponds to so-called ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}-matrix with weak admissibility condition . The hierarchically off-diagonal butterfly (HOD-BF) format, however, is a generalization of HOD-LR where low-rank approximation is replaced by butterfly decomposition . For dense linear systems arising from high-frequency wave equations, the HOD-BF format is a suitable matrix representation, since butterfly compression applied to the off-diagonal blocks reduces storage and solution complexity, as opposed to ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} or HOD-LR matrices which do not reduce complexity for such problems. The HOD-BF matrix format was first developed to solve 2D high-frequency Helmholtz equations with 𝒪​(n​log2⁡n)𝒪𝑛superscript2𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n\\log^{2}n) memory and 𝒪​(n3/2​log⁡n)𝒪superscript𝑛32𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2}\\log n) time . Recent work shows that the same complexity can also be obtained for 3D Helmholtz equations despite the non-constant butterfly rank due to the weak admissibility condition[ref]38. It is also worth mentioning that compared to butterfly-based ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} matrix compression with strong admissibility condition  , HOD-BF enjoys simpler butterfly arithmetic, smaller leading constants in complexity, and significantly better parallelization performance. In what follows, we briefly describe the HOD-BF format, which is used in Section 5 to construct the quasi-linear complexity multifrontal solver. As illustrated in Fig. 4, in the HOD-BF format diagonal blocks are recursively refined until a certain minimum size is reached. For a square matrix A∈ℝn×n𝐴superscriptℝ𝑛𝑛A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}, this partitioning defines a single binary tree 𝒯Hsubscript𝒯𝐻\\mathcal{T}_{H}, as shown on the right in Fig. 4. The root node is at level 00; its children are at level 111, etc. All the leaf nodes are at level L𝐿L. Each node τ𝜏\\tau at level l𝑙l in the HOD-BF tree has an index set Tτl⊂TH={1,…,n}subscriptsuperscript𝑇𝑙𝜏subscript𝑇𝐻1…𝑛T^{l}_{\\tau}\\subset T_{H}=\\{1,\\dots,n\\}, where THsubscript𝑇𝐻T_{H} is the index set corresponding to all rows and columns of the matrix. For an internal node τ𝜏\\tau at level l𝑙l with children τ1subscript𝜏1\\tau_{1} and τ2subscript𝜏2\\tau_{2}, Tτl=Tτ1l+1∪Tτ2l+1superscriptsubscript𝑇𝜏𝑙superscriptsubscript𝑇subscript𝜏1𝑙1superscriptsubscript𝑇subscript𝜏2𝑙1T_{\\tau}^{l}=T_{\\tau_{1}}^{l+1}\\cup T_{\\tau_{2}}^{l+1}. At the lowest level of the hierarchy, the leaves of the HOD-BF tree, the diagonal blocks Dτ=A​(TτL,TτL)subscript𝐷𝜏𝐴subscriptsuperscript𝑇𝐿𝜏subscriptsuperscript𝑇𝐿𝜏D_{\\tau}=A(T^{L}_{\\tau},T^{L}_{\\tau}) are stored as regular dense matrices, while off-diagonal blocks are approximated using butterfly decomposition. Let τ1subscript𝜏1\\tau_{1} and τ2subscript𝜏2\\tau_{2} be two siblings in 𝒯Hsubscript𝒯𝐻\\mathcal{T}_{H} on level l𝑙l with the two trees 𝒯τ1lsubscriptsuperscript𝒯𝑙subscript𝜏1\\mathcal{T}^{l}_{\\tau_{1}} and 𝒯τ2lsubscriptsuperscript𝒯𝑙subscript𝜏2\\mathcal{T}^{l}_{\\tau_{2}}, subtrees of 𝒯Hsubscript𝒯𝐻\\mathcal{T}_{H}, rooted at nodes τ1subscript𝜏1\\tau_{1} and τ2subscript𝜏2\\tau_{2} respectively. These two sibling nodes correspond to two off-diagonal blocks Bτ1=A​(Tτ1l,Tτ2l)subscript𝐵subscript𝜏1𝐴subscriptsuperscript𝑇𝑙subscript𝜏1subscriptsuperscript𝑇𝑙subscript𝜏2B_{\\tau_{1}}=A(T^{l}_{\\tau_{1}},T^{l}_{\\tau_{2}}) and Bτ2=A​(Tτ2l,Tτ1l)subscript𝐵subscript𝜏2𝐴subscriptsuperscript𝑇𝑙subscript𝜏2subscriptsuperscript𝑇𝑙subscript𝜏1B_{\\tau_{2}}=A(T^{l}_{\\tau_{2}},T^{l}_{\\tau_{1}}), approximated using butterfly decomposition. One of those butterfly blocks is defined by 𝒯O=𝒯τ1lsubscript𝒯𝑂subscriptsuperscript𝒯𝑙subscript𝜏1\\mathcal{T}_{O}=\\mathcal{T}^{l}_{\\tau_{1}} and 𝒯S=𝒯τ2lsubscript𝒯𝑆subscriptsuperscript𝒯𝑙subscript𝜏2\\mathcal{T}_{S}=\\mathcal{T}^{l}_{\\tau_{2}}, while the other is defined by 𝒯O=𝒯τ2lsubscript𝒯𝑂subscriptsuperscript𝒯𝑙subscript𝜏2\\mathcal{T}_{O}=\\mathcal{T}^{l}_{\\tau_{2}} and 𝒯S=𝒯τ1lsubscript𝒯𝑆subscriptsuperscript𝒯𝑙subscript𝜏1\\mathcal{T}_{S}=\\mathcal{T}^{l}_{\\tau_{1}}.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: n) time .
