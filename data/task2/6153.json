      "content": "Paper Title: DNN-Defender: An in-DRAM Deep Neural Network Defense Mechanism for Adversarial Weight Attack\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe far-reaching development of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) accuracy even with low-bit-width models has recently triggered various security-associated attacks in many applications [ref]1  . Recent studies show that an adversary can identify and manipulate a small number of vulnerable bits of off-the-shelf well-trained DNN weight parameters to significantly compromise the output accuracy  . Such Bit-Flip Attacks (BFAs) have been enabled mainly due to a manifestation of a DRAM cell-to-cell interference and failure mechanism called RowHammer (RH) [ref]5 [ref]6. RH attack is conducted when a malicious process activates and pre-charges a specific row (i.e., aggressor row) repeatedly to a certain threshold (TR‚ÄãHsubscriptùëáùëÖùêªT_{RH}) to induce bit-flips on immediate nearby rows (i.e., victim rows).\nUnfortunately, by scaling down the size of DRAM chips in the modern manufacturing process, DRAM becomes increasingly more vulnerable to RH bit-flips . Figure 1(a) shows that the RH threshold has had a significant downward trend in recent years, e.g., the attacker needs ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim4.5√ó\\times fewer hammer counts on LPDDR4 (new) as opposed to DDR3 (new) . Such a threshold will almost disappear at DDR5 . To prevent RH attacks, DRAM manufacturers and researchers have proposed hardware-based victim-focused defense mechanisms to proactively refresh the victim rows [ref]5 . However, such RH mitigation proposals have faced a huge overhead both from latency and power consumption perspectives . To mitigate this, recent aggressor-focused swap-based mechanisms   proactively swap and unswap aggressors with random rows before reaching the RH threshold. Such mechanisms can be immensely effective when the attacker does not have knowledge of the internal DRAM organization. Assuming the attacker‚Äôs access\nto this information, he/she will not track the aggressor row but the victim row and attacks its adjacent row, making it a new aggressor row. In this case, swapping the aggressor row with another random row is purposeless. On the other side, prior works have approached the problem of DNN weight noise mitigation from a software-training optimization perspective    and DNN architecture modification¬†  that impose expensive training overhead or performance/accuracy degradation. To address the above-mentioned challenges, we develop DNN-Defender as a pure DRAM-based victim-focused defense mechanism to effectively withstand the targeted RH bit-flip attacks on DNNs. The main contributions of this work are as follows.\n(1) We design the DNN-Defender mechanism with hardware-software support that utilizes in-DRAM swapping to protect the DNN weight parameters not requiring any software training or imposing additional hardware overhead;\n(2) We develop a partitioning method and parallelism to tailor the performance-accuracy trade-offs with respect to the system requirements; and\n(3) We extensively analyze the DNN-Defender‚Äôs applicability and efficiency in mitigating RH vulnerability compared to recent hardware/software techniques in the DNN domain over CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. On the CIFAR-10, the accuracy of the DNN-Defender-supported system is 91.71% while the baseline indicates only 10.9% under bit-flip attack.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: The far-reaching development of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) accuracy even with low-bit-width models has recently triggered various security-associated attacks in many applications [ref]1  .
