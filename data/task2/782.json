      "content": "Paper Title: Approximate Partition Selection for Big-Data Workloads using Summary Statistics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nApproximate Query Processing (AQP) systems allow users to trade off between accuracy and query execution speed. In applications such as data exploration and visualization, this trade-off is not only acceptable but often desirable. Sampling is a common approximation technique, wherein the query is evaluated on a subset of the data, and much of the literature focuses on row-level samples   . When data is stored in media that does not support random access (e.g., flat files in data lakes and columnar stores  ), constructing a row-level sample can be as expensive as scanning the entire dataset. For example, if data is split into partitions with 100100100 rows, a 111% uniform row sample would in expectation require fetching 646464% (1−0.991001superscript0.991001-0.99^{100}) of the partitions; a 101010% uniform row sample would touch almost all partitions. As a result, recent work from a production AQP system shows that row-level sampling only offers significant speedups for complex queries where substantial query processing remains after the sampling . In contrast to row-level sampling, the I/O cost of constructing a partition-level sample is proportional to the sampling fraction111In the paper, we use “partition” to refer to the finest granularity at which the storage layer maintains statistics.. In our example above, a 1% partition-level sample would only read 1% of the data. We are especially interested in big data clusters, where data is stored in chunks of tens to hundreds of megabytes, instead of disk blocks or pages which are typically a few kilobytes  . Partition-level sampling is already used in production due to its appealing performance: commercial databases create statistics using partition samples   and several Big Data stores allow sampling partitions of tables   . However, a key challenge remains in how to construct partition-level samples that can answer a given query accurately. Since all or none of the rows in a partition are included in the sample, the correlation between rows (e.g., due to layout) can lead to inaccurate answers. A uniformly random partition-level sample does not make a representative sample of the dataset unless the rows are randomly distributed among partitions 4, which happens rarely in practice 0. In addition, even a uniform random sample of rows can miss rare groups in the answer or miss the rows that contribute substantially to SUM-like aggregates. It is not known how to compute stratified  or measure-biased  samples over partitions, which helps with queries with group-by’s and complex aggregates. In this work, we introduce PS3 (Partition Selection with Summary Statistics), a system that supports AQP via weighted partition selection (Figure 1). Our primary use case is in large-scale production query processing systems such as Spark 5, F1 2, SCOPE 1 where queries only read and datasets are bulk appended. Our goal is to minimize the approximation error given a sampling budget, or fraction of data that can be read. Motivated by observations from production clusters at Microsoft and in the literature that many datasets remain in the order that they were ingested , PS3 does not require any specific layout or re-partitioning of data. Instead of storing precomputed samples 4  2, which requires significant storage budgets to offer good approximations for a wide range of queries 5 [ref]44, PS3 performs sampling exclusively during query optimization. Finally, similar to the query scope studied in prior work 4  4, PS3 supports single-table queries with SUM, COUNT(*), AVG aggregates, GROUP BY on columnsets with moderate distinctiveness, predicates that are conjunctions, disjunctions or negations over single-column clauses. To select partitions that are most relevant to a query, PS3 leverages the insight that partition-level summary statistics are relatively inexpensive to compute and store. The key question is which statistics to use. Systems such as Spark SQL and ZoneMaps already maintain statistics such as maximum and minimum values of a column to assist in query optimization . Following similar design considerations, we look for statistics with small space requirements that can be computed for each partition in one pass at ingest time. For functionality, we look for statistics that are discriminative enough to support decisions such as whether the partition contributes disproportionally large values of the aggregates. We propose such a set of statistics for partition sampling – measures, heavy hitters, distinct values, and histograms – which include but expand on conventional catalog-level statistics. The total storage overhead scales with the number of partitions instead of with the dataset size. We only maintain single-column statistics to keep the overhead low. The resulting storage overhead can be orders of magnitudes smaller than approaches using auxiliary indices to reduce the cost of random access . While the set of statistics is by no means complete, we show that each type of statistics contributes to the sampling performance, and, in aggregate, delivers effective AQP results. We illustrate three ways of using summary statistics to help with partition selection. First, if we knew which partitions contribute more to the query answer, we could sample these partitions more frequently. While it is challenging to manually design rules that relate summary statistics to partition contribution, a model can learn how much summary statistics matter through examples. Inspired by prior work which uses learning techniques to improve the sampling efficiency for counting queries on row-level samples 6, we propose a learned importance-style sampling algorithm that works on aggregate queries with GROUP BY clauses and on partitions. The summary statistics serve as a natural feature representation for partitions, from which we can train models offline to learn a mapping from summary statistics to the relative importance of a partition. During query optimization, we use the trained models to classify partitions into several importance groups, and allocate the sampling budget across groups such that the more important groups get a greater proportion of the budget. The training overhead is a one time cost for each dataset and workload, and for high-value datasets in clusters that are frequently queried, this overhead is amortized over time. In addition, we leverage the redundancy and skewness of the partitions for further optimization. For two partitions that output similar answers to an input query, it suffices to only include one of them in the sample. While directly comparing the contents of the two partitions is expensive, we can use the query-specific summary statistics as a proxy for the similarity between partitions. We also observe that datasets commonly exhibit significant skew in practice. For example, in a prototypical production service request log dataset at Microsoft, the most popular application version out of the 167 distinct versions accounts for almost half of the dataset. Inspired by prior works in AQP that recognize the importance of outliers  , we use summary statistics (e.g., the occurrences of heavy hitters in a partition) to identify a small number of partitions that are likely to contain rare groups, and dedicate a portion of the sampling budget to evaluate these partitions exactly. In summary, this paper makes the following contributions: We introduce PS3, a system that makes novel uses of summary statistics to perform weighted partition selection for many popular queries. Given the query semantics, summary statistics and a sampling budget, the system intelligently combines a few sampling techniques to produce a set of partitions to sample and the weight of each partition. We propose a set of lightweight sketches for data partitions that are not only practical to implement, but can also produce rich partition summary statistics. While the sketches are well known, this is the first time the statistics are used for weighted partition selection. We evaluate on a number of real-world datasets with real and synthetic workloads. Our evaluation shows that each component of PS3 contributes meaningfully to the final accuracy and together, the system outperforms alternatives across datasets and layouts, delivering from 2.7×\\times to 70×70\\times reduction in data read given the same error compared to uniform partition sampling.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: any specific layout or re-partitioning of data.
