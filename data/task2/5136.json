Active and passive strategies are both applied for the crash mitigation and avoidance [ref]20.\nPassive strategy is primarily concerned with improving automobile safety features such as seat belts, airbags, and body structures to mitigate the severity in the inevitable crashes.\nActive methods proactively detect and evaluate the driving risks  [ref]20  , recommend or take actions to control the vehicles to avoid and mitigate crashes    . Among them, driving risk prediction and analysis is the hottest topic and initial step in this direction because only the risk scenarios are detected can the further actions be taken to avoid the potential risks. Wang et al.  proposed a deep learning model to handle both spatial and temporal dependence in driving risk evaluation incorporating the driving patterns of the target vehicle, the driving patterns of surrounding vehicles, and the interactions between the target and surrounding vehicles to improve driving safety. Chen et al.  presented a deep autoencoder based method for driving safety risk prediction. By adaptively searching the optimal sliding window size and extracting the features on the original driving data, their method showed good prediction performance on the driving risk. After detecting the potential risks, various action-taking methods are proposed to avoid and mitigate the crashes.\nWang et al.  designed a\nmotion planner for generating an emergency path to mitigate the inevitable crash as much as possible.\nMorales et al.  proposed a model for velocity control by abstracting the maneuvers from expert driving data to avoid the potential crashes in the blind interactions.\nWang et al.  provided a learning-based method to understand the driving style and offer the warning to avoid the lane departure crashes.\nKaplan and Prato  applied the regret minimization as behavioral paradigm to choose the crash avoidance maneuvers. Some researches have studied the correlations between the performing of crash avoidance maneuvers and various factors, providing the evidences to choosing proper maneuvers under multiple precrash conditions.\nWang et al. \nexamined the correlations between various crash avoidance maneuvers and injury severity sustained by motorcyclists.\nAhmadreza et al.  discovered the effect of distraction-related factors on the performance of a crash avoidance avoidance maneuver, paving the way for help the drivers to react better. This paper focuses on the action-taking\nmethod to avoid and mitigate the crashes, a step further the risk situation being detected. Different from the existing studies, we propose an open evolving framework for crash avoidance by leveraging the wealthy of human driving experience from the steady stream of traffic cases, which is the first work in this direction to use the overall human knowledge for crash avoidance.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: 7200 fatal crashes, which validated the great potential of such systems to save human lives, time and money.
