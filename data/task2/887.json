Our approach follows a similar template to that of  for MAX CUT. Like¬†, we consider the max-min problem of finding an RPR2 rounding function fùëìf which achieves at least the optimal approximation ratio for any distribution ùíüùíü\\mathcal{D} of triples of unit vectors (pairs of unit vectors for MAX CUT). In the case of MAX CUT,  showed that the ‚Äúmost difficult‚Äù ùíüùíü\\mathcal{D} is a distribution over pairs of identical unit vectors, and pairs of unit vectors with dot product œÅ<0ùúå0\\rho<0. Likewise, we show (see Theorem 4.8) that the most difficult ùíüùíü\\mathcal{D} come from triples of vectors that are have pairwise dot products (œÅ,œÅ,1)ùúåùúå1(\\rho,\\rho,1) or (œÅ0,œÅ0,œÅ0)subscriptùúå0subscriptùúå0subscriptùúå0(\\rho_{0},\\rho_{0},\\rho_{0}), where œÅ‚àà(‚àí1,0]ùúå10\\rho\\in(-1,0] and œÅ0=max‚Å°(œÅ,‚àí1/3)subscriptùúå0ùúå13\\rho_{0}=\\max(\\rho,-1/3) or œÅ0=1subscriptùúå01\\rho_{0}=1. Once we fix a distribution ùíüùíü\\mathcal{D}, the performance of fùëìf can be expressed using a double integral. Using calculus of variations, we can then produce an integral equation that must be satisfied by the optimal fùëìf, known as a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind (c.f., [ref]27). If we discretize fùëìf as a step function, the integral equation becomes a system of linear equations (c.f., Section¬†6 of the full version of¬†). Thus, like in¬†, we can efficiently compute an arbitrarily close approximation of the optimal function for MAX NAE-{3}3\\{3\\}-SAT. We found that the optimal approximation ratio is approximately 0.90890.90890.9089. We also observed that the optimal function is very close to an sùë†s-linear function, that is of the form f‚Äã(x)=max‚Å°(‚àí1,min‚Å°(1,s‚Äãx))ùëìùë•11ùë†ùë•f(x)=\\max(-1,\\min(1,sx)), but there is a nontrivial error term on the order of O‚Äã(x3)ùëÇsuperscriptùë•3O(x^{3}).\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: a double integral.
