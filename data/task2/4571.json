      "content": "Paper Title: Learning in Audio-visual Context: A Review, Analysis, and New Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe purpose of audio-visual localization is to highlight the visual region or location of interest by referring to the input audio. These tasks build the cross-modal correlation and highlight the audio-visual components in the scenes. Sound Localization in Videos. In most cases, the sound can be related to its sounding source in visual as the audio and visual often occur simultaneously. The sound localization task aims to find and locate the sound-related regions in videos for the input audio. Early attempts on this task used shallow probabilistic models   or CCA-related methods [ref]219 to associate audio and visual signal.\nRecently, deep neural networks bring this task into a new stage.\nAVC framework is a typical training scheme. It learns to maximize the similarity between sound features and the visual embeddings of the same sounding object [ref]220  .\nThese methods mostly work well in simple single-source scenarios while are hard to handle the cocktail-party scenario with multiple sounding sources. Thus, Zhao et al.    combined the audio-visual source separation objective with localization task, and employed the mix-then-separate framework to generate correspondence between pixels and separated audio signals. Differently, Hu et al.  formulated the image and sound as graphs and adopted a cycle-consistent random walk strategy for separating as well as localizing mixed sounds. The above methods only locate the sounding area in videos but do not consider the semantics of objects. Hu et al.  employed the clustering method to establish a category-representation object dictionary and conducted class-aware sounding object localization in the cocktail-party scenario.\nConsidering the above methods often only capture the coarse object contour, Zhou et al.  released a segmentation dataset with pixel-level annotation of localization. They introduced the audio-visual segmentation task, whose goal is to conduct pixel-level sounding localization. Overall, the sound localization in video methods ground the sounding regions in visual, achieving fine-grained scene understanding. Audio-visual Saliency Detection. The saliency detection task aims to model the human attention mechanism. In daily life, our attention can be attracted by salient objects or things. Originally, saliency detection tasks only take visual information as the input, which aims to detect eye-attracting components in images or videos  . Although humans rely on the visual system to perceive the surroundings to a great extent, other senses, especially hearing, can also affect the perception results. To comprehensively explore the human attention mechanism, it is necessary to integrate audio and visual. The early studies in audio-visual saliency detection often utilized traditional hand-craft techniques to detect audio and visual saliency respectively then fused the uni-modal saliency map   . These methods lack the consideration of inter-modal correlation. Recently, a series of deep-based saliency detection methods have emerged [ref]231   . Tavakoli et al. [ref]231 designed a two-stream framework and used the concatenation fusion strategy, which is a relatively basic model. Further, STAViS model  is proposed to combine audio-visual information at multiple stages. However, the dependence on the human eye-fixation label hinders the development of this field, since it is laborious to collect and annotate massive videos. Therefore, Wang et al.  designed a strategy for converting audio-visual semantic category tags into pseudo eye-fixation labels. Then they trained the saliency detection model in a weakly-supervised manner.\nOverall, audio-visual saliency detection is a developing field and more in-depth exploration is expected. Audio-visual Navigation. Besides localizing objects in recorded videos, localizing and navigating in spatial space is natural for humans. In embodied artificial intelligence field, navigation is a vital topic and visual clues are the main information source  . However, for humans, hearing can also provide useful spatial information for our exploration of an unfamiliar environment. Thus, the audio-visual navigation task is introduced, aiming to search and locate the target sounding goal in a complex 3D environment  .\nChen et al.  adopted an end-to-end multi-modal deep reinforcement learning method to explore navigation policies with a stream of audio-visual observations. Concurrently, Gan et al.  designed a planner for the action sequence generation, based on the captured spatial memory and observed audio-visual information.\nTo further improve the efficiency of navigation, Chen et al.  proposed to set a series of waypoints in a hierarchical model, then a planner plays the path to each waypoint.\nThese prior works assume the sounding goal constantly produces a steady repeating sound.\nDifferently, Chen et al.  introduced the semantic audio-visual navigation task that the produced sound of the sounding goal is semantically consistent with the scene (e.g., water dripping in the bathroom).\nThe above works often navigate in the environment with a single static sounding goal. Thus, researchers attempted to navigate in more complex scenarios with moving and distracting sounds  .\nRelatively, Majumder et al.  proposed to train the agent for separating the target source in the 3D environment via moving around based on audio-visual observations. In general, existing audio-visual navigation studies have worked well in the simple simulation 3D environment, but are still a subset of human navigation scenarios, and more realistic cases are under-solved.\n\nReference markers found: [219]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]219: The sound localization task aims to find and locate the sound-related regions in videos for the input audio.
