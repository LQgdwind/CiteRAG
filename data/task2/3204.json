      "content": "Paper Title: Positional Encoding Augmented GAN for the Assessment of Wind Flow for Pedestrian Comfort in Urban Areas\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare three state-of-the-art models for image-to-image translation on CFD airflow prediction. Pix2Pix . For each iteration, we update both the generator and the discriminator. The generator used has a U-Net architecture , with 888 downsamplings in the U-Net, resulting in an output resolution of 256×256256256256\\times 256. For our problem, the input and output might differ in surface appearance, but both consist of the same underlying structure. Therefore, we may say that their structure is roughly aligned. The generator is designed around these considerations, having skip-connections between each down- and up-sampling layer. This way, we circumvent the bottom bottleneck layer; low-level information is passed with the aforementioned skip connections. Each skip connection concatenates all channels at layer i𝑖i with those at layer n​-​i𝑛-𝑖n\\mbox{-}i, having n𝑛n as the total number of layers. We use the leaky rectified linear unit (LeakyReLU) and instance norm and rectified linear unit (ReLU) in each upsample block in each U-Net downsample block. Using instance normalization has been demonstrated to be effective at image generation tasks 2. To reduce the chance of overfitting, the implementation also uses dropout 3. The generator itself has 54.4​M54.4𝑀54.4M parameters. The discriminator consists of a PatchGAN, which tries to classify each N×N𝑁𝑁N\\times N patch in the input-image as real or fake. It consists of 5 convolutional layers, interleaved by leaky ReLU activations and instance normalization. This discriminator is applied convolutionally across the image, averaging all responses to provide the final output of Disubscript𝐷𝑖D_{i}. The discriminator has 2.7​M2.7𝑀2.7M trainable parameters, giving us a total of 57,1​M571𝑀57,1M parameters for the proposed network architecture. CycleGAN [ref]2 consists of two generators with nine residual blocks and two deconvolutional layers, intertwined by ReLU, dropout, and instance normalization. The model has two discriminators, each with five convolutional layers with leaky ReLU and instance normalization. Each generator has a total of 11,4​M114𝑀11,4M parameters, and each discriminator has 2,8​M28𝑀2,8M parameters, which yields a total of 28,3​M283𝑀28,3M parameters. The model is optimized using subsubsection 2.2.3 and subsubsection 2.2.3. Details about architecture and optimization are detailed in subsubsection 2.2.3. U-Net : An autoencoder-like architecture for image translation. The architecture has the same specifications as described for the U-Net generator in model (1). The autoencoder has a total of 54.4​M54.4𝑀54.4M trainable parameters, as it is identical to the generator of the Pix2Pix model. It is optimized using L1 distance to the target simulation. The U-Net architecture used in models (1) and (3) is described in detail in subsubsection 2.2.2.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: the final output of Disubscript𝐷𝑖D_{i}.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
