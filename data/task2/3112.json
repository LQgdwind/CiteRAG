      "content": "Paper Title: Deformable ProtoPNet: An Interpretable Image Classifier Using Deformable Prototypes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSimilar to , the training of a Deformable ProtoPNet proceeds in three stages. Stage 1: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) of layers before last layer. We perform stochastic gradient descent over the features of f𝑓f and g𝑔g while keeping hℎh fixed. By doing so we aim to learn a useful feature space where the image features 𝐳^a,bΔsubscriptsuperscript^𝐳Δ𝑎𝑏\\mathbf{\\hat{z}}^{\\Delta}_{a,b} of inputs of class c𝑐c are clustered around prototypes 𝐩^(c,l)superscript^𝐩𝑐𝑙\\mathbf{\\hat{p}}^{(c,l)} of the same class, but separated from those of other classes on a hypersphere. To achieve this, we use the cluster and separation losses as in  and adapted for the angular space in 5. The cluster and separation losses are defined as: and respectively, where N𝑁N is the total number of inputs, 𝐳^(i)superscript^𝐳𝑖\\mathbf{\\hat{z}}^{(i)} is the image feature tensor normalized and scaled at each spatial location for input i𝑖i, y(i)superscript𝑦𝑖y^{(i)} is the label of 𝐱(i)superscript𝐱𝑖\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, and all other values are as defined previously. We were inspired by recent work in margin-based softmax losses 4 [ref]23  3  to further encourage this clustering structure by modifying traditional cross entropy loss. Specifically, we use a new form of cross entropy: subtractive margin cross entropy. This is defined as: where wh((c,l),c′)subscriptsuperscript𝑤𝑐𝑙superscript𝑐′ℎw^{((c,l),c^{\\prime})}_{h} denotes the last layer connection between the similarity of prototype 𝐩^(c,l)superscript^𝐩𝑐𝑙\\mathbf{\\hat{p}}^{(c,l)} and class c′superscript𝑐′c^{\\prime}, for a fixed margin ϕ=0.1italic-ϕ0.1\\phi=0.1, and ⌊⌋+subscript\\lfloor\\hskip 2.84526pt\\rfloor_{+} denotes the ReLU function. Subtractive margin cross entropy encourages a well separated feature space by artificially decreasing the angle between a deformable prototype 𝐩^(c,l)superscript^𝐩𝑐𝑙\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}^{(c,l)} of class c𝑐c and the collection of deformed image features 𝐳^a,bΔ,(i)subscriptsuperscript^𝐳Δ𝑖𝑎𝑏\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}^{\\Delta,(i)}_{a,b} from the i𝑖i-th training image with y(i)≠csuperscript𝑦𝑖𝑐y^{(i)}\\neq c, thereby inflating the cosine similarity between the two and increasing the class score of the incorrect class c𝑐c. In order to reduce the value of this loss, the network has to try harder to counter the introduced margin ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi by further increasing the angle between a deformable prototype 𝐩^(c,l)superscript^𝐩𝑐𝑙\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}^{(c,l)} and an image feature 𝐳^a,bΔ,(i)subscriptsuperscript^𝐳Δ𝑖𝑎𝑏\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}^{\\Delta,(i)}_{a,b} of an incorrect class, resulting in a stronger separation between classes on the latent hypersphere. While the subtractive margin encourages separation between classes, it does not encourage diversity between prototypes within a class and between prototypical parts within a prototype. In particular, we have observed that deformations without further regularization often result in duplications of prototypical parts within a prototype. Inspired by 5, we discourage this behavior by introducing orthogonality loss between prototypical parts. This is formulated as: where L𝐿L is the number of deformable prototypes in class c𝑐c, ρ​L𝜌𝐿\\rho L is the total number of prototypical parts from all prototypes of class c𝑐c, 𝐏(c)∈ℝρ​L×dsuperscript𝐏𝑐superscriptℝ𝜌𝐿𝑑\\mathbf{P}^{(c)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\rho L\\times d}\nis a matrix with every prototypical part of every prototype from class c𝑐c arranged as a row in the matrix, and 𝐈(ρ​L)superscript𝐈𝜌𝐿\\mathbf{I}^{(\\rho L)} is the ρ​L×ρ​L𝜌𝐿𝜌𝐿\\rho L\\times\\rho L identity matrix. The matrix multiplication 𝐏(c)​𝐏(c)⊤superscript𝐏𝑐superscript𝐏limit-from𝑐top\\mathbf{P}^{(c)}\\mathbf{P}^{(c)\\top} in equation (13) contains an inner product between every pair of prototypical parts in class c𝑐c; by encouraging this to be close to the scaled identity matrix r2​𝐈(ρ​L)superscript𝑟2superscript𝐈𝜌𝐿r^{2}\\mathbf{I}^{(\\rho L)}, we encourage the prototypical parts to be orthogonal to one another and thereby increase the diversity of semantic concepts represented by prototypical parts. This loss differs from 5 because it encourages orthogonality at both the prototype and the prototypical part level. Whereas the orthogonality loss in 5 encourages orthogonality between each pair of prototypes within a class, equation (13) encourages orthogonality between all prototypical parts within a class.\nA visualization of the space created by these terms can be seen in Figure 4. With these loss terms defined, our overall loss term during the first stage of training is: where λ1=0.01,λ2=0.1formulae-sequencesubscript𝜆10.01subscript𝜆20.1\\lambda_{1}=0.01,\\lambda_{2}=0.1 and λ3=0.1subscript𝜆30.1\\lambda_{3}=0.1 are hyperparameters chosen empirically. As in , the last layer connection between each deformable prototype and its class is set to 111; all other connections are set to −0.50.5-0.5. Stage 2: Projection of prototypes. We project each deformable prototype 𝐩^(c,l)superscript^𝐩𝑐𝑙\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}^{(c,l)} onto the most similar collection of interpolated image features 𝐳^a,b(Δ)subscriptsuperscript^𝐳Δ𝑎𝑏\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}^{(\\Delta)}_{a,b} from some training image 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}. Mathematically, this is formulated as: In this projection scheme, we allow projection onto fractional locations and we project all prototypical parts within each prototype onto the same training image, which promotes cohesion among parts of a single prototype. Stage 3: Optimization of the last layer. In this stage, we fix all other model parameters and optimize over the last layer connections hℎh. Let wh((c,l),c′)subscriptsuperscript𝑤𝑐𝑙superscript𝑐′ℎw^{((c,l),c^{\\prime})}_{h} be defined as previously described. For this stage, we use the loss function: where λ1=10−3subscript𝜆1superscript103\\lambda_{1}=10^{-3} and CE is standard cross entropy loss. The second term on the right-hand side of equation (16) discourages negative reasoning processes as explained in .\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: i𝑖i, y(i)superscript𝑦𝑖y^{(i)} is the label of 𝐱(i)superscript𝐱𝑖\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, and all other values are as defined previously.
