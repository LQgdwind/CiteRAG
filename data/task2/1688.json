      "content": "Paper Title: Distributional Formal Semantics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn DFS, the meaning of a proposition is captured by a meaning vector that\ndefines for each model M‚àà‚Ñ≥ùëÄ‚Ñ≥M\\in\\mathcal{M} that constitutes the meaning\nspace whether it satisfies the proposition or not. The quality of the\nmeaning representations therefore critically depends on finding a set of\nmodels ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} that truth-conditionally and probabilistically capture\nthe structure of the world. In Section¬†2 we described an\nalgorithm to induce the meaning space from a high-level description of\nthe structure of the world. An advantage of this approach is that it allows\nfor defining the meaning space in a controlled manner, which is especially\nimportant when modeling experimental data. From a computational perspective,\nhowever, it would be interesting to investigate whether the meaning\nspace‚Äîor the underlying world knowledge constraints‚Äîcould be empirically\nderived from existing resources, such as knowledge bases and/or\nlinguistic corpora. There exists a wide variety of large-scale corpora that are annotated with\nsentence-level semantic information (for an overview, see\n). For the purpose of generating a meaning space,\nthe annotations should minimally reflect predicate-argument structure (e.g.,\nbased on PropBank , or FrameNet\n). Crucially, however, a well-formed meaning space\ncaptures all co-occurrence probabilities between the propositions\nthat constitute the space. This means that the resource should not only\ncapture co-occurrence information between subsets of proposition-level\nmeanings (e.g, those that are part of a single discourse, as in the\nGroningen Meaning Bank [ref]49, or appear in a single textual\nentailment pair, as in the Stanford Natural Language Inference corpus\n), but rather across the entire set of\nproposition-level meanings; that is, individual models in the DFS meaning\nspace describe the truth-values of all propositions in ùí´ùí´\\mathcal{P}, which\nwould correspond to the union of the propositions occurring in all\ndiscourses, or across all textual entailment pairs in a corpus. Moreover, in\norder to maintain the distinction between probabilities deriving from the\nstructure of the world, and those deriving from linguistic experience (see\n), the co-occurrence probabilities\nrepresented in the meaning space should ideally derive from\n‚Äòworld-knowledge‚Äô-driven inferences that are not confounded by linguistic\nco-occurrence (although in many cases these will of course align). An example of a resource that captures such ‚Äòworld knowledge‚Äô-driven\nco-occurrences is the DeScript corpus , which\ncontains crowd-sourced event sequence descriptions (ESDs) that describe\ntypical, everyday activities (also called ‚Äòscripts‚Äô\n). In addition, the DeScript corpus contains a gold\nstandard alignment for a subset of the crowd-sourced ESDs. Although the ESDs\nare themselves linguistic, they contain ‚Äòworld-knowledge‚Äô-driven information\nregarding the events and that are typically associated with a particular\nscript (e.g., baking a cake or fixing a bicycle), as well as the order in\nwhich they typically occur. Sampling a meaning space from such a corpus\nentails identifying a set of propositions ùí´ùí´\\mathcal{P} (in this case, the\nevents associated with a set of scripts), and collecting a large enough set\nof models ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} that describe combinations between these\npropositions; whereas using individual ESDs may result in data sparseness,\nit is possible to sample models based on the co-occurrence information\nderived from the individual ESDs.¬†In future work, we plan to evaluate this\napproach, and experiment with data-driven meaning space induction from\ndifferent resources.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: that the resource should not only\ncapture co-occurrence information between subsets of proposition-level\nmeanings (e.g, those that are part of a single discourse, as in the\nGroningen Meaning Bank [ref]49, or appear in a single textual\nentailment pair, as in the Stanford Natural Language Inference corpus\n), but rather across the entire set of\nproposition-level meanings; that is, individual\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
