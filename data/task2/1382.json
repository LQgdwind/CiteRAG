Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Transductive Visual Verb Sense Disambiguation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare our method with two state-of-the-art algorithms: Gella et al. [ref]12 and Silberer et al. [ref]33. To the best of our knowledge [ref]12 and [ref]33 are the only literature works dealing with the research problem of VVSD and reported performances on the VerSe dataset.\nThe work of [ref]12 is based on a variant of Lesk algorithm  in which the sense is assigned based on the cosine similarity between the embedding of <<image, verb>> and the possible verb-senses in the dictionary. This procedure does not require labeled data since the final choice is based on the maximum score between <<image, verb >> and all the possible senses associated to the same verb as the image. For this reason, we tagged this method as unsupervised. [ref]12 proposed a supervised setting, in which a logistic regression is trained on each different embeddings. Similarly to [ref]12, in [ref]33 a logistic regression is trained, but it uses a frame-semantic image representation of the <<image, verb>> pairs rather than the embedding generated by [ref]12. Both methods are categorized as supervised and performances are reported only on the VerSe-19verb dataset. The performances of the first sense (FS) and most frequent sense (MFS) heuristics are shown in table 1 and 2. Both are widely used in the NLP literature  and considered respectively as baselines for unsupervised and supervised scenarios in [ref]12. The FS corresponds to the first sense of a verb in the dictionary representing the common sense in a language (not in a specific dataset), while MFS is the most frequent sense in a dataset. MFS is considered as a supervised heuristic since all labeled data are needed to compute it.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: We compare our method with two state-of-the-art algorithms: Gella et al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
