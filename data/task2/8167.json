      "content": "Paper Title: FusionANNS: An Efficient CPU/GPU Cooperative Processing Architecture for Billion-scale Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost ANNS algorithms exploit a distance metric such as Euclidean distance to find the top-k nearest neighbors for a given query vector. For high-dimensional and large-scale datasets, it is computationally costly due to the curse of dimensionality¬†. To address this issue, most ANNS algorithms¬†  [ref]30 [ref]17    exploit indexing techniques to prune data regions that are unlikely to contain the nearest neighbors. These indices can significantly improve the query performance by shrinking the search space, but significantly increases memory consumption, especially for large datasets. Among various indexing techniques, IVF¬†    and graph-based¬†[ref]17  indices are widely used due to their high efficiency. The graph-based index often organizes vectors in a proximity graph structure, in which vertices and edges represent vectors and distances between two vertices, respectively.\nUpon a query, the ANNS engine traverses the graph from a given vertex to find the top-kùëòk nearest neighbors. DiskANN¬†[ref]22 is a typical graph-based ANNS solution. It uses SSDs to store graph indices of billion-scale datasets while keeping some frequently-accessed vertices in main memory. Although DiskANN is a memory-efficient ANNS solution, it experiences high latency for queries due to rather long iteration paths for large-scale datasets. The IVF index is a popular indexing technique for large-scale datasets stored on SSDs. To create the IVF index, a dataset is often partitioned into many posting lists using a clustering algorithm¬†, and each posting list is represented by its centroid. Recent studies¬†  have demonstrated that the IVF index¬† is more efficient than the state-of-the-art graph-based index¬†[ref]22 for billion-scale datasets. SPANN¬† is a state-of-the-art billion-scale ANNS system using the IVF index. Unlike conventional IVF indices, SPANN builds an advanced IVF index by replicating boundary vectors of clusters into adjacent posting lists. This replication mechanism significantly expands the size of vector indices by 8√ó8\\times, but improves the query accuracy and efficiency. As shown in Figure¬†2, SPANN stores all posting lists on SSDs while maintaining the centroids of these posting lists in memory using a graph index. Upon a query, SPANN traverses the in-memory graph to identify top-mùëöm nearest posting lists and loads them to host main memory. Then, it finds the top-kùëòk (k<mùëòùëök<m) nearest neighbors within these mùëöm posting lists via distance calculations. Although SPANN achieves low latency comparable to in-memory ANNS approaches, we find that its throughput for concurrent queries is quite limited.\nAs shown in Figure¬†3a, SPANN achieves the peak QPS using only four CPU threads, and its throughput can not scale with more threads. We count the query latency in two stages: (i) graph traversal in memory, and (ii) processing posting lists from SSD. Figure¬†3b shows that the query latency increases almost linearly with the number of threads. However, the latency of graph traversal almost remains stable, whereas the latency of processing posting lists increases significantly with the number of threads. The reason is that multiple queries concurrently read many and large-size posting lists from SSDs, resulting in severe I/O contention and high latency.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: neighbors for a given query vector.
