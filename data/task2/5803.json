Note that among the baseline methods, VL-PLM , ViLD [ref]14 and OV-DETR [ref]35 use novel class names during training in order to recognize the potential novel objects and assign pseudo labels for them. Consequently, a new detector needs to be trained whenever there is a new set of categories to be detected.\nCORA can generalize to any combination of novel categories once trained without tedious re-training.\nOther compared methods relying on CLIP require image tag annotations extracted from language descriptions    or image labels  during training.\nWe argue that the extra annotations do not provide additional information over CLIP.\nInstead, they serve as a media to transfer the knowledge from CLIP to the detector.\nOur method directly adapts the CLIP model to obtain region classifier, thus no extra image-text data is needed. In this work, both region prompting and anchor pre-matching aim to generalize the knowledge learned from base classes to novel classes.\nConsequently, the performance gap between novel and base classes is significantly lowered than the compared methods.\nNote that in OVD, the performance is evaluated by the generalization capability towards novel classes, rather than the bases classes on which they are trained.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: pre-trained model, our method improves the previous state-of-the-art RegionCLIP  by 2.4 AP50.\nWhen extra data is available, the performance can be further boosted to 43.1 AP50.\nThe results on LVIS [ref]16 OVD benchmark is shown in Tab. 2.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
