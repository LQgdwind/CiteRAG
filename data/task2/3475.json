      "content": "Paper Title: Shaping Advice in Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTechniques to improve credit assignment using feedback signals provided by a human operator have been studied in single-agent RL.\nDemonstrations provided by a human operator were used to synthesize a ‘baseline policy’ that was used to guide learning in  [ref]22. When expert demonstrations were available, imitation learning was used to guide exploration of the RL agent in  [ref]24.\nFeedback provided by a human operator was converted to a shaping reward to aid training a deep RL agent in environments with delayed rewards in .\nThese techniques, however, presume the availability of a human operator, which might limit their applicability. In the multi-agent setting, decentralized and distributed control techniques is a popular area of research.\nA widely studied problem in such systems is the development of algorithms to specify methods by which information can be exchanged among agents so that they can jointly complete tasks.\nA technique to ensure fixed-time consensus for multi-agent systems whose interactions were specified by a directed graph was studied in  .\nThe authors of  proposed an adaptive distributed event-triggering protocol to guarantee consensus for multi-agent systems specified by linear dynamics and interactions specified by an undirected graph.\nWe direct the reader to  for a survey of recent developments in consensus of multi-agent systems.\nThese works, however, assumed the availability of models of individual agent’s dynamics, and of the interactions between agents. Data-driven techniques are being increasingly adopted to solve problems in multi-agent systems.\nThese methods do not require complete knowledge of the system model; rather, they use information about the state, input, and output of each agent to establish feasibility of solutions and guarantees on convergence of reinforcement learning-based algorithms.\nInput and state data were used in an online manner to design a distributed control algorithm to solve a cooperative optimal output regulation problem in leader-follower systems in .\nInformation obtained from trajectories of each player were used in [ref]31 to develop real-time solutions to multi-player games through the design of an actor-critic-based adaptive learning algorithm.\nThe authors of  identified a class of networked MARL problems where enforcing specific local interactions among players permitted the exploiting an exponential decay property which enabled the development of scalable, distributed algorithms for optimization and control.\nA comprehensive overview of algorithms in cooperative and competitive MARL with a focus on theoretical analyses of their convergence and complexity was presented in . Cooperative MARL tasks are one instance of the setup described above, wherein all agents share the same global reward.\nThe authors of  introduced value decomposition networks that decomposed a centralized value into a\nsum of individual agent values to assess contributions of individual agents to a shared global reward. An additional assumption on monotonicity of the centralized value function was imposed in QMIX  to assign credit to an agent by enumerating a value for each valid action at a state.\nThe action spaces of agents in the above-mentioned works were discrete and finite, and these techniques cannot be easily adapted to settings with continuous action spaces.\nIn comparison, we study reward shaping in MARL tasks in environments with continuous action spaces.\n An alternative approach to improve credit assignment is potential-based reward shaping.\nAlthough this requires prior knowledge of the problem domain, potential-based techniques have been shown to offer guarantees on optimality and convergence of policies in both single  and multi-agent    cases.\nThe aforementioned works had focused on the use of potential-based methods in environments with discrete action spaces.\nA preliminary version of this paper  introduced potential-based techniques to learn stochastic policies in single-agent RL with continuous states and actions.\nIn this paper, we adapt and extend methods from  to develop a comprehensive framework for providing potential-based shaping advice in both single- and multi-agent RL. The authors of  developed a method called iterative relative credit refinement (IRCR), which used a ‘surrogate objective’ to uniformly redistribute a sparse reward along the length of a trajectory in single and multi-agent RL.\nWe empirically compare SAM with IRCR, and explain why SAM is able to guide agents to learn policies that result in higher average rewards than IRCR.\n Methods to learn a potential-based reward shaping function have been investigated in recent research.\nWhen domain knowledge was available, the authors of  proposed a temporal-difference learning method to transform a given reward function to potential-based advice.\nIn the absence of domain knowledge, graph convolutional networks were used in  to generate potential functions ‘automatically’ by performing message passing between states at which the agent received a reward.\nDifferent from the above works, an approach to perform credit assignment by conditioning the value function on future events from a trajectory was examined by the authors of .\nWe note that these works have focused on the single-agent case.\nAn analogous approach for the multi-agent case, while interesting, is beyond the scope of the present paper, and remains a promising direction for future research.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: signals provided by a human operator have been studied in single-agent RL.\nDemonstrations provided by a human operator were used to synthesize a ‘baseline policy’ that was used to guide learning in  [ref]22.
