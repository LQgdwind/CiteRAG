      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Play Two-Player Perfect-Information Games without Knowledge\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the most difficult tasks in artificial intelligence is the\nsequential decision making problem ,\nwhose applications include robotics and games. As for games, the successes\nare numerous. Machine surpasses man for several games, such as backgammon,\ncheckers, chess, and go . A major class\nof games is the set of two-player games in which players play in turn,\nwithout any chance or hidden information. This class is sometimes\ncalled two-player perfect information111With some definitions, perfect information games include games with\nchance. It depends on whether one includes information about the future\nin perfect knowledge. games Mycielski [ref]3 or also two-player combinatorial\ngames. There are still many challenges for these games. For example,\nfor the game of Hex, computers have only been able to beat\nstrong humans since 2020¬†. For general\ngame playing  (even restricted to games\nwith perfect information): man is always superior to machine on an\nunknown complex game (when man and machine have a relatively short\nlearning time to master the rules of the game). In this article, we\nfocus on two-player zero-sum games with perfect information, although\nmost of the contributions in this article should be applicable or\neasily adaptable to a more general framework222All the proposed techniques are directly applicable to the framework\nof perfect information single-agent sequential decision-making problems\nand in particular to solitaire games with perfect information. Tree\nlearning, ordinal distribution, and reinforcement heuristics are applicable\nin the generalized cases (in case of mùëöm agents, reinforcement heuristics\ncan be valued in real mùëöm-space). Minimax variants are applicable\nin multi-player perfect-information games as variants of the paranoid\nalgorithm . Descent can be applied to\nlearn value functions for stochastic perfect-information games by\napplying it to a large set of determinist games corresponding to the\nstochastic game where the chance was fixed and known before the start\nof the game. To use the corresponding learned heuristic, either a\nminimax at depth 111 or an algorithm such as expectiminimax¬†\nmust be used. However, for stochastic games and multiplayer games\ngeneralizations of the minimax variants should give better results\nin general.. The first approaches used to design a game-playing program are based\non a game tree search algorithm, such as minimax, combined\nwith a handcrafted game state evaluation function based on expert\nknowledge. A notable use of this technique is the Deep Blue chess\nprogram . However, the success of Deep Blue\nis largely due to the raw power of the computer, which could analyze\ntwo hundred million game states per second. In addition, this approach\nis limited by having to design an evaluation function manually (at\nleast partially). This design is a very complex task, which must,\nin addition, be carried out for each different game. Several works\nhave thus focused on the automatic learning of evaluation functions\n. One of the first successes of learning\nevaluation functions is on the Backgammon game 0.\nHowever, for many games, such as Hex or Go, minimax-based approaches,\nwith or without machine learning, have failed to overcome human. Two\ncauses have been identified 1. Firstly, the\nvery large number of possible actions at each game state prevents\nan exhaustive search at a significant depth (the game can only be\nanticipated a few turns in advance). Secondly, for these games, no\nsufficiently powerful evaluation function could be identified. An\nalternative approach to solve these two problems has been proposed,\ngiving notably good results to Hex and Go, called Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch and denoted MCTS 2 3. This\nalgorithm explores the game tree non-uniformly, which is a solution\nto the problem of the very large number of actions. In addition, it\nevaluates the game states from victory statistics of a large number\nof random end-game simulations. It does not need an evaluation function.\nThis was not enough, however, to go beyond the level of human players.\nSeveral variants of Monte Carlo tree search were then proposed, using\nin particular knowledge to guide the exploration of the game tree\nand/or random end-game simulations 3. Recent\nimprovements in Monte Carlo tree research have focused on the automatic\nlearning of MCTS knowledge and their uses. This knowledge was first\ngenerated by supervised learning 4 5 6 7 8\nthen by supervised learning followed by reinforcement learning\n9, and finally by only reinforcement learning\n 0 1.\nThis allowed programs to reach and surpass the level of world champion\nat the game of Go with the latest versions of the program AlphaGo\n9 . In particular, AlphaGo\nzero , which only uses reinforcement learning,\ndid not need any knowledge to reach its level of play. This last success,\nhowever, required 29 million games of self-play (with 1,600 state\nevaluations per move). This approach has also been applied to chess\n2. The resulting program broke the best\nchess program (which is based on minimax). AlphaZero was subsequently\nreimplemented in Polygames , an open-source\nand multi-game program, which was notably applied to Hex and Havannah.\nIn particular, at the 2020 Computer Olympiad, the gold medals for\nthese games were won by Polygames. It is therefore questionable whether minimax is totally out of date\nor whether the spectacular successes of recent programs are more based\non reinforcement learning than Monte Carlo tree search. In particular,\nit is interesting to ask whether reinforcement learning would enhance\nminimax enough to make it competitive with Monte Carlo tree search\non games where it dominates minimax so far, such as Go or Hex. In this article333Note that this paper is an extended, improved, and english version\nof¬†3., we therefore focus on reinforcement learning within the minimax\nframework. We propose and asses new techniques for reinforcement learning\nof evaluation functions. Then, we apply them to design new program-players\nto the game of Hex (without using other knowledge than the rules of\nthe game). We compare this program-player to Mohex 3HNN 6,\nthe best Hex program, champion at Hex (size 11 and 13) of the 201820182018\nComputer Olympiad 4. In the next section, we briefly present the game algorithms and in\nparticular minimax with unbounded depth on which we base several of\nour experiments. We also present reinforcement learning in games,\nthe game of Hex, the state of the art of game programs on this game,\nas well as other games on which experiments are performed. In the\nfollowing sections, we propose different techniques aimed at improving\nlearning performances and we expose the experiments carried out using\nthese techniques. In particular, in Section¬†3,\nwe extends the tree bootstrapping (tree learning) technique to the\ncontext of reinforcement learning without knowledge based on non-linear\nfunctions. In Section¬†4,\nwe present a new search algorithm, a variant of unbounded minimax\ncalled descent, intended to be used during the learning process.\nIn Section¬†5, we introduce reinforcement\nheuristics. Their usage is a simple way to use general or dedicated\nknowledge in reinforcement learning processes. We study several reinforcement\nheuristics in the context of different games. In Section¬†6,\nwe propose another variant of unbounded minimax, which plays the safest\naction instead of playing the best action. This modified search is\nintended to be used after the learning process. In Section¬†7,\nwe introduce a new action selection distribution and we apply it with\nall the previous techniques to design program-players to the game\nof Hex (size 11 and 13) and compare them to Mohex 3HNN. Finally,\nin the last section, we conclude and expose the different research\nperspectives.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: information111With some definitions, perfect information games include games with\nchance.
