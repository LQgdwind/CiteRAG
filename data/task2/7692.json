      "content": "Paper Title: UPSS: a User-centric Private Storage System with its applications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe CFS , Coda ,Ivy , and FARSITE  filesystems provide availability for user data stored on dedicated servers in a distributed environment along with other features such as disconnected operations, content-addressable storage and log-structured systems. Coda introduced an automatic conflict resolution that can detect most but not all the classes of conflicts. Ivy also introduced a conflict detector called lc that notifies users about conflicts. Similar to UPSS-FUSE, FARSITE, which is a decentralized network filesystem, uses convergent encryption    to protect user data. As CFS, Coda and Ivy are non-cryptographic filesystems, they cannot rely on untrusted storage servers. On the other hand, the access control lists in FARSITE, which is a cryptographic fileystem, is not completely decoupled from user data; therefore, higher level applications cannot define their own policies, as it is possible in UPSS. Several filesystems have been designed for untrusted cloud settings, such as\nNCryptFS , EncFS , OutFS [ref]28 and CryFS\n.\nNCryptFS and EncFS are cryptographic filesystems, which protect content by\nencrypting files, but leave filesystem metadata such as the directory structure\nunprotected.\nCryFS and OutFS solve this problem by splitting all filesystem data into fixed-size\nblocks and encrypting each block individually. CryFs uses one key for all\nencryptions, but OutFS generates separate keys per file.\nThe creators of EncFS expanded their work to make it a multi-user filesystem by\napplying Unix local permissions to the encrypted files before being stored on\nremote servers .\nHowever, EncFS and OutFS are not practical for multi-user environments with\nnon-local users. CageCoach  is another distributed and cryptographic\nfilesystem that builds on features of UPSS that were introduced\nin [ref]17. CageCoach makes the first step\ntowards partial sharing via redaction over encrypted read-only data.\nCageCoach is, as yet, a pre-publication prototype\nunder development. Ori , IPFS  and Perkeep\n (formerly known as Camlistore) connect multiple devices with a\nfilesystem that users can access anywhere.\nIPFS synthesizes key ideas from DHTs ,\nBitTorrent , Git \nand self-certifying pathnames \nto create a peer-to-peer version-controlled filesystem.\nBoth Ori and IPFS reduce the data inconsistency problem to a\nversion control problem by storing new versions of files upon modification;\nOri handles updates with the CoW technique.\nSynchronization, failures handling, data recovery and sharing/grafting\nare key Ori features.\nPerkeep uses open protocols to create a unified store for user data from\ndifferent sources such as Twitter or a local hard drive.\nSimilar to UPSS-FUSE, Perkeep can be backed by a memory store, a local store\nor a cloud account.\nHowever, none of Ori, IPFS or Perkeep provide a mechanism for\nsharing redacted file and directory hierarchies. Moreover, Perkeep leaves the directory structure unprotected on the backing service. MetaSync  and DepSky  are\nsynchronization services that store confidential data on untrusted cloud storage\nproviders.\nMetaSync synchronizes multiple cloud storage providers using pPaxos and a\ndeterministic replication algorithm to maintain a globally consistent view of\nthe synchronized files.\nDepSky provides availability, integrity and confidentiality of data stored on\nfour different cloud storage servers, replicated by quorum techniques.\nIt uses symmetric-key encryption and distributes the key between clouds using a\nsecret sharing scheme, so no individual cloud service can recover the key alone. However, these two systems cannot be used as a platform for novel applications that UPSS can support and they just synchronize multiple cloud services. Tahoe  and UtahFS  are cryptographic filesystems with the goal of storing user data on untrusted storage servers.\nAs in UPSS, Tahoe and UtahFS store content encrypted in Merkle DAGs and provide access control by cryptographic capabilities.\nUnlike UPSS, however, Tahoe’s replica-oriented design lends itself more readily to storage of shared immutable data than to the use cases of a general-purpose filesystem.\nIn Tahoe, files are encrypted with a symmetric key, the ciphertext is erasure-coded using Reed-Solomon codes 1 and split into N𝑁N shares to be written to N𝑁N servers.\nMutable files are signed and verified with a public/private key pair, which is stored alongside the file.\nMutation of the file requires knowledge of this private key, and mutation by multiple collaborators can cause data inconsistency.\nFurthermore, mutation requires copying and encrypting entire files, which does\nnot lend itself to the frequent mutation that is found in practical filesystems.\nBy contrast, UPSS’s blocks, block pointers and Version structure allow arbitrarily-small ranges of files to be mutated frequently without overly-zealous copying or re-encryption.\nUtahFS encrypts files with one symmetric key; files larger than a predefined size are broken into fixed-size blocks.\nUtahFS supports hiding access patterns by Path ORAM 7, but this feature is disabled by default as it degrades performance significantly .\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: higher level applications cannot define their own policies, as it is possible in UPSS. Several filesystems have been designed for untrusted cloud settings, such as\nNCryptFS , EncFS , OutFS [ref]28 and CryFS\n.\nNCryptFS and EncFS are cryptographic filesystems, which protect content by\nencrypting files, but leave filesystem metadata such as the directory structure\nunprotected.\nCryFS and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
