      "content": "Paper Title: Going Beyond Linear Mode Connectivity: The Layerwise Linear Feature Connectivity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDespite the successes of modern deep neural networks, theoretical understanding of them still lags behind. Efforts to understand the mechanisms behind deep learning have led to significant interest in exploring the loss landscapes and training dynamics. While the loss functions used in deep learning are often regarded as complex black-box functions in high dimensions, it is believed that these functions, particularly the parts encountered in practical training trajectories, contain intricate benign structures that play a role in facilitating the effectiveness of gradient-based training  [ref]4 . Just like in many other scientific disciplines, a crucial step toward formulating a comprehensive theory of deep learning lies in meticulous empirical investigations of the learning pipeline, intending to uncover quantitative and reproducible nontrivial phenomena that shed light on the underlying mechanisms. One intriguing phenomenon discovered in recent work is Mode Connectivity 0  : Different optima found by independent runs of gradient-based optimization are connected by a simple path in the parameter space, on which the loss or accuracy is nearly constant. This is surprising as different optima of a non-convex function can very well reside in different and isolated “valleys” and yet this does not happen for optima found in practice. More recently, an even stronger form of mode connectivity called Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) was discovered  [ref]9. It depicts that different optima can be connected by a linear path of constant loss/accuracy. Although LMC typically does not happen for two independently trained networks, it has been consistently observed in the following scenarios: Spawning [ref]9 : A network is randomly initialized, trained for a small number of epochs (e.g. 5 epochs for both ResNet-20 and VGG-16 on the CIFAR-10 dataset), and then spawned into two copies which continue to be independently trained using different SGD randomnesses (i.e., for mini-batch order and data augmentation). Permutation  : Two networks are independently trained, and the neurons of one model are permuted to match the neurons of the other model while maintaining a functionally equivalent network. The study of LMC is highly motivated due to its ability to unveil nontrivial structural properties of loss landscapes and training dynamics. Furthermore, LMC has significant relevance to various practical applications, such as pruning and weight-averaging methods. On the other hand, the success of deep neural networks is related to their ability to learn useful features, or representations, of the data , and recent work has highlighted the importance of analyzing not only the final outputs of a network but also its intermediate features . However, this crucial perspective is absent in the existing literature on LMC and weight averaging. These studies typically focus on interpolating the weights of different models and examining the final loss and accuracy, without delving into the internal layers of the network. In this work, we take a feature-learning perspective on LMC and pose the question: what happens to the internal features when we linearly interpolate the weights of two trained networks? Our main discovery, referred to as Layerwise Linear Feature Connectivity (LLFC), is that the features in almost all the layers also satisfy a strong form of linear connectivity: the feature map in the weight-interpolated network is approximately the same as the linear interpolation of the feature maps in the two original networks. More precisely, let 𝜽Asubscript𝜽𝐴\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{A} and 𝜽Bsubscript𝜽𝐵\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{B} be the weights of two trained networks, and let f(ℓ)​(𝜽)superscript𝑓ℓ𝜽f^{(\\ell)}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) be the feature map in the ℓℓ\\ell-th layer of the network with weights 𝜽𝜽\\boldsymbol{\\theta}. Then we say that 𝜽Asubscript𝜽𝐴\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{A} and 𝜽Bsubscript𝜽𝐵\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{B} satisfy LLFC if See Figure 1 for an illustration.\nWhile LLFC certainly cannot hold for two arbitrary 𝜽Asubscript𝜽𝐴\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{A} and 𝜽Bsubscript𝜽𝐵\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{B}, we find that it is satisfied whenever 𝜽Asubscript𝜽𝐴\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{A} and 𝜽Bsubscript𝜽𝐵\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{B} satisfy LMC. We confirm this across a wide range of settings, as well as for both spawning and permutation methods that give rise to LMC. LLFC is a much finer-grained characterization of linearity than LMC. While LMC only concerns loss or accuracy, which is a single scalar value, LLFC (1) establishes a relation for all intermediate feature maps, which are high-dimensional objects. Furthermore, it is not difficult to see that LLFC applied to the output layer implies LMC when the two networks have small errors (see Lemma 1); hence, LLFC can be viewed as a strictly stronger property than LMC. The consistent co-occurrence of LLFC and LMC suggests that studying LLFC may play a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of LMC. Subsequently, we delve deeper into the underlying factors contributing to LLFC. We identify two critical conditions, weak additivity for ReLU function and a commutativity property between two trained networks. We prove that these two conditions collectively imply LLFC in ReLU networks, and provide empirical verification of these conditions. Furthermore, our investigation yields novel insights into the permutation approaches: we interpret both the activation matching and weight matching objectives in Git Re-Basin  as ways to ensure the satisfaction of commutativity property. In summary, our work unveils a richer set of phenomena that go significantly beyond the scope of LMC, and our further investigation provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanism behind LMC. Our results demonstrate the value of opening the black box of neural networks and taking a feature-centric viewpoint in studying questions related to loss landscapes and training dynamics.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: functions, particularly the parts encountered in practical training trajectories, contain intricate benign structures that play a role in facilitating the effectiveness of gradient-based training  [ref]4 .
