      "content": "Paper Title: Retentive Neural Quantum States: Efficient Ans√§tze for Ab Initio Quantum Chemistry\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVariational Monte Carlo (VMC) with neural network quantum states (NQS) is a generative deep learning framework [ref]4 that utilizes a classical neural network to efficiently encode the state vector of a quantum many-body system. This neural network ansatz learns a state vector approximating the ground state eigenvector of a given quantum Hamiltonian HùêªH, via a VMC training algorithm analogous to policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning. More specifically, for state vectors formulated in the Hilbert space ‚ÑÇ2nsuperscript‚ÑÇsuperscript2ùëõ\\mathbb{C}^{2^{n}}, binary strings of length nùëõn are sampled from the Born probability distribution associated with the approximate state vector. These samples are used to efficiently estimate both the expectation value of HùêªH and the associated network parameter gradients. Thus NQS bypasses the need to explicitly store the full ansatz state vector or Hamiltonian matrix, whose dimensions grow exponentially with respect to nùëõn. So long as HùêªH is sufficiently row sparse with easily retrievable entries‚Äîa loose restriction for Hamiltonians relevant to many practical applications‚Äîthe entire algorithm will execute in polynomial time with respect to nùëõn. Direct conceptual relationships have been drawn between NQS, as a high-level numerical black box solver, and both natural evolution strategies  and variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs). In latter case, NQS may be viewed not only as an analogous method but also as a direct pipeline for de-quantization of existing VQEs , which rely on parameterized quantum circuits to prepare physical trial wavefunctions. As NQS is fundamentally problem-agnostic, a property it shares with VQEs, it is unsurprising that NQS has been successfully demonstrated on a variety of problems: Ising models [ref]4, combinatorial optimization  , and high-dimensional linear algebra . While some of the existing demonstrations of these use cases are proofs of concept, they all depict a significant greater potential for NQS to perform accurately and efficiently on practically-motivated problems. An exciting area of application of significant recent interest is to use NQS for ab initio quantum chemistry, specifically to solve electronic structure problems   [ref]36 6 [ref]33. In this application, the second quantized electronic structure Hamiltonian corresponding to some molecule, which encodes the energy of the joint wavefunction describing all of that molecule‚Äôs electrons, is mapped to a qubit-based Hamiltonian that can be targeted by NQS. This line of research parallels similar recent efforts to address these problems using VQEs   , and has positioned NQS as a potentially viable alternative to more established methods like coupled cluster  and tensor network methods like DMRG 4. The first applications of NQS to electronic structure calculations utilized restricted Boltzmann machines‚Äîwhich model unnormalized wave functions that necessitate approximate Monte Carlo sampling methods‚Äîas ansatz networks . Although there is promising research being conducted with unnormalized wave functions 6, much of NQS research in this area now relies on autoregressive wavefunction ansatze , which are normalized by construction and furthermore allow for exact sampling from their Born probability distribution. This paradigm has resulted in scalable quantum chemistry solvers, performing with accuracies comparable to CCSD, using the masked feedforward network MADE [ref]36, and‚Äîmore recently‚Äîtransformers [ref]33. Transformers constitute a compelling alternative to MADE since they are more parameter-efficient and do not explicitly grow in size with respect to the number of qubits nùëõn, but they do possess one inherent computational drawback: the cost of performing a forward pass grows quadratically with the qubit number both during training and inference. When employed in large language model (LLM) applications, it is understood that this quadratic scaling does not contribute significantly to the compute requirements for training transformer-based models, as reflected in standard floating point operation (FLOP) count estimates 3. For NQS, however, each optimization step necessitates multiple forward passes of the ansatz in order to generate Monte Carlo samples, so quadratic cost poses a nonneglible computational bottleneck at scale. In this work, we introduce a novel NQS ansatz based on retentive networks (RetNets) 8, a recurrent model designed as an alternative to transformers for LLM applications. Unlike transformers, RetNets process inputs in parallel during training, and recurrently during inference, allowing for a linear inference cost with respect to nùëõn. Since RetNets can alleviate the inference cost of transformers and have been shown to exhibit baseline performance comparable to transformers for natural language processing tasks, they serve as a promising candidate for NQS-based electronic structure calculations.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) with neural network quantum states (NQS) is a generative deep learning framework [ref]4 that utilizes a classical neural network to efficiently encode the state vector of a quantum many-body system.
