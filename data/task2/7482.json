Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

In the comparison studies, we selected nine state-of-the-art CMOEAs for comparison, including methods using different operators. They are c-DPEA 2, ToP 0, CMOEA-MS , BiCo 3, MFOSPEA2 , ShiP-A 4, DSPCMDE 5, NSGA-II-ToR [ref]8, and CCEA 6.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: we selected nine state-of-the-art CMOEAs for comparison, including methods using different operators.
