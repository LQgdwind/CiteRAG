Various systems\nattempt to achieve atomic durability, transform general objects to\npersistent objects and provide a secure interface of persistent\nmemory. The above goals usually require the use of logging which can\nbe software or hardware based. Raad et al have proposed a notion of\ndurable serialisability under relaxed memory\n, but this model does not handle\naborted transactions. ATLAS  is a software system that provides\ndurability semantics for NVRAM with lock-base multithreaded code. The system ensures that the outermost critical sections, which are\nprotected by one or more mutexes, are failure-atomic by identifying\nFailure Atomic Sections (FASEs). These sections ensure that, if at\nleast one update that occurs to a persistent location inside a FASE is\ndurable, then all the updates inside the session are\ndurable. Furthermore, like dTML, ATLAS keeps an persistent undo\nlog, that tracks the synchronisation operations and persistent stores,\nand allows the recovery of rollback FASEs that were interrupted by\ncrashes. Koburn et al.  integrate persistent objects into\nconventional programs, and furthermore seek to prevent safety bugs\nthat occur in predominantly persistent memory models, such as multiple\nfrees, pointer errors, and locking errors. This is done by\nimplementing NV-heaps, an interface to the NVRAM based on ACID transactions that guarantees safety and provides\nreasoning about the order in which changes to the data structures should become\npermanent. NV-heaps only handle updates to persistent memory inside transactions\nand critical sections. Other systems based on persistent ACID\ntransactions include Mnemosyne , Stasis\n and BerkeleyDB . Ben-David et al. [ref]4 developed a system that can\ntransform programs that consist of read, write and CAS operations in\nshared memory, to persistent memory. The system aims to create\nconcurrent algorithms that guarantee consistency after a fault. This\nis done by introducing checkpoints, which record the current state of the\nexecution and from which the execution can be continued after a\ncrash. Two consecutive checkpoints form a capsule, and if a\ncrash occurs inside a capsule, program execution is continued from the\nprevious capsule boundary. We have not applied this technique to\ndevelop dTML, but it would be interesting to develop and optimise\ncapsules in an STM context. Mnemosyne  provides a low-level interface to\npersistent memory with high-level transactions based on TinySTM  and a redo log that is\npurposely chosen to reduce ordering constraints. The log is flushed at the commit of each transaction. As a result, the memory locations\nthat are written to by the transaction remain unmodified until\ncommit. Each read operation checks whether data has been modified and\nif so, returns the buffered value instead of the value from the\nmemory. The size of the log increases proportionally to the size of\nthe transaction, potentially making the checking time consuming.\n Hardware based durable transactional memory has also been\nproposed  with hardware support for redo\nlogging . Other indicative hardware systems help implement atomic durability\neither by performing accelerated ordering or by performing the logging\noperation are\n .\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: only handle updates to persistent memory inside transactions\nand critical sections.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
