      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Quantum Voting with Information-Theoretic Security\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVoting protocols have been studied extensively in classical cryptography  and numerous classical voting protocols have been developed    . To have a fair and secure voting outcome, an ideal protocol should meet the following requirements: Correctness: With no adversary interference, the protocol correctly counts all voters. Accountability: Only eligible voters are allowed to vote with only one vote per voter. Verifiability: Voters should be able to verify their vote and the outcome of the election. Anonymity: The identity of the voter cannot be compromised. At present, the security of advanced voting protocols relies on assumptions about the computational complexity of certain mathematical problems , such as integer factorization . However, some of these problems can be potentially solved efficiently on future large-scale quantum computers . At the same time, quantum systems may allow the sharing of quantum information between voters that can, in principle, avoid computational assumptions in favor of information-theoretic security [ref]9. Even if the encrypted information is stored, no future advances in computational power will enable its decoding. This observation has spurred active development of quantum voting protocols, see, e.g., 0 for a recent review. However, existing approaches are either inefficient or do not satisfy all desirable security criteria. While early contributions 1 2 explored the use of distributed entangled states to compute the voting function, their security is not rigorously established, especially in practical settings. For instance, quantum communication that is exponential in the number of voters is required to prevent double-voting 3 0. In this Article, we describe a novel approach to this problem that exploits an exponential separation between quantum and classical communication complexity to authenticate voters and prevent forgery. Our scheme (Figure 1) features a (generally untrusted) tallyman, who distributes ballots encoded in quantum states to the voters. We make use of a special encoding that has been shown to provide an exponential reduction in communication complexity 4 compared to classical encodings for solving a specific matching problem 5. This feature is related to a threshold 6 for locally decodable codes 7 and serves as the basis for unforgeable quantum money 8. We use the communication advantage to ensure efficient scaling of resources for a large number of voters. Specifically, the total number of qubits communicated in our scheme scales polynomially with the number of voters and the size of local qubit memories scales only logarithmically with the number of voters. Importantly, we prove that this specific encoding also prevents forgery of votes. More precisely, we show that the voter can only learn enough information to output one vote, via projective measurement that collapses the quantum state encoding ballot information. This ballot state is distributed to voters via quantum teleportation using preshared entanglement. In the case of an untrusted tallyman, anonymous state teleportation schemes 9 0 can be employed to ensure voter anonymity 1. Distributed computation of the voting function is enabled by anonymous broadcast of the voters’ ballots and votes 2. To enable secure collision detection for both of these subroutines, we generalize a previous single-bit scheme 2 to allow computation of a distributed sum efficiently and prove its information security. It improves the efficiency of the anonymous state transfer and broadcast by queuing the senders in advance. In contrast, commonly used classical collision detection 3 relies on pairwise authenticated channels (consuming more resources) and has not been proven secure against quantum adversaries 4. Note that compared to prior quantum secure summation protocols 5, our approach shares the output with all parties while retaining efficiency. In our approach, the tallyman is required to create and teleport the ballot state to each voter using photonic channels. The voters should be able to do permutations of the computational basis states allowing them to measure the ballot state in different bases. We outline below how this can be achieved using one quantum node per voter containing a number of memory qubits that only scales logarithmically with the total number of voters. Consequently, quantum nodes with only tens of qubits are required for thousands of voters. Our main result can be summarized as (formalized later in Theorem 5): \n\nThe desirable cryptographic properties (Item 1 – Item 4) of a voting scheme can be satisfied for N𝑁N voters with information-theoretic security with efficient scaling involving total quantum communication of O​(N4​log⁡N)𝑂superscript𝑁4𝑁O(N^{4}\\log N) qubits and O​(log⁡N)𝑂𝑁O(\\log N) memory qubits per voter.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: At the same time, quantum systems may allow the sharing of quantum information between voters that can, in principle, avoid computational assumptions in favor of information-theoretic security [ref]9.
