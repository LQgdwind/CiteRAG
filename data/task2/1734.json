      "content": "Paper Title: Boosting ship detection in SAR images with complementary pretraining techniques\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active microwave remote sensing imaging radar with the capability of targeting objects in all-day and all-weather conditions, and has been widely applied in many military and civil fields. Ship detection in high-resolution SAR images has drawn considerable attention for its broad application prospects, such as marine surveillance , military intelligence acquisition  and so on. Many traditional SAR ship detection methods have been proposed    to detect multi-scale ships in complex surroundings. As one of the most commonly used techniques, the constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) method , adaptively adjusts the threshold given a false-alarm rate and leverages the estimated statistical distributions to distinguish objects from the background with the calculated threshold. However, traditional detection methods suffer from tremendous difficulties in accurate detection due to weak feature extraction capabilities. Recently, benefited from the rapid development of deep learning, remarkable breakthroughs have been made in deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) -based detection methods. Generally, CNN-based detection methods can be divided into two categories: two-stage detection methods, such as Faster R-CNN [ref]7, Mask R-CNN , Cascade R-CNN ; and one-stage detection methods, such as SSD 0, RetinaNet 1, YOLO 2. Specifically, two-stage detection methods adopt the feature maps generated from backbone networks, e.g. Residual Network (ResNet) 3, to preliminarily extract class-agnostic region proposals of the potential objects with negative locations filtered out, and then further refine these proposals and classify them into different categories. Different from two-stage detection methods, one-stage detection methods omit the region proposals generation process and consider object detection as a regression problem to directly predict location coordinates and class probabilities for improving the detection speed, but with the precision reduced in general. However, with bags of efficient and effective tricks well used, one-stage detection methods, such as YOLOv4 4 can also achieve comparable or even better performance to two-stage detection methods. Because of the powerful feature extraction and representation ability, these CNN-based detection methods have been successfully applied to ship detection in SAR images. Based on two kinds of detection frameworks, effective network structures, training strategies and tricks are carefully designed to deal with multi-scale ship detection, leading to significant performance improvement. As for the two-stage SAR ship detectors, Jiao et al. 5 fused different feature maps by a densely connected multi-scale neural network to solve multi-scale ship detection. Lin et al. 6 proposed a squeeze and excitation rank architecture to suppress redundant information of feature maps for representative ability improvement based on VGG network 7 pre-trained on ImageNet 8. Cui et al. 9 adopted feature pyramid network (FPN) 0 with convolutional block attention module (CBAM) densely connected to each feature map to integrate resolution and semantic information effectively. Wei et al. 1 introduced high-resolution ship detection network (HR-SDNet) to maintain high-resolution features, expecting to improve detection performance. Yan et al. 2 proposed attention receptive pyramid network (ARPN) with receptive fields block (RFB) and convolutional block attention module (CBAM) combined reasonably. RFB can enhance local features with global dependency, while CBAM can boost useful information and suppress the influence of surroundings. As for the one-stage SAR ship detectors, Du et al. 3 effectively leverages saliency information to improve the representation capability of original SSD network 0 and enhance target detection results by focusing more on informative regions. Zhang et al. 4 proposed a depth-wise separable convolution neural network that leverages multi-scale mechanism, concatenation mechanism and anchor box mechanism to improve ship detection speed dramatically. Inspired by the real-time idea of the YOLO algorithm, Zhang et al. 5 introduced a grid convolutional neural network equipped with depth-wise separable convolution to speed up the ship detection with little performance loss. Fu et al. 6 introduced a feature balancing module for the small-scale ship detection and a feature-refinement module to tackle feature misalignment for better localization accuracies. Instead of horizontal bounding boxes, Chen et al. 7 and An et al. 8 used the oriented bounding boxes to perform more suitable ship detection for the geospatially arranged objects. On the one hand, the improvements brought by these detectors are attributed to effective network structures. On the other hand, the ImageNet 8 pretraining technique, a normal practice, is adopted to support all of these SAR ship detectors due to the scarcity of labeled SAR images. However, directly using ImageNet pretraining is hardly to obtain a good SAR ship detector, which is also a significant issue but with less attention paid. Specifically, one significant problem is the different imaging perspective. The ships in ImageNet are taken under natural scenes, while ships in SAR images are obtained from earth observations. The inconsistency across different ships’ viewing perspective results in annotation information from ImageNet not applicable for SAR ship detectors. Thus, based on a large-scale aerial image dataset 9, we propose an optical ship detector (OSD) pretraining technique to improve feature learning ability of ships in SAR images. The OSD pretraining technique can transfer the characteristics of ships in earth observations to SAR images by fully taking advantage of a large amount of ships’ annotation information from aerial images. Another critical problem of directly applying ImageNet pretraining to SAR ship detection is the different imaging geometry between optical and SAR images, making ship detectors unable to obtain a powerful SAR feature embedding. Hence, we propose an Optical-SAR matching (OSM) pretraining technique to enhance the general feature embedding of SAR images. Specifically, the OSM pretraining technique transfers plentiful texture features from optical images to SAR images by common representation learning via bridge neural network (BNN) 0 on the optical-SAR matching task. As depicted in Fig 1, BNN employs a couple of convolution neural networks (CNN) named left-CNN and right-CNN which project SAR images and optical images into a common feature space, respectively (see Section II-C for a more detailed discussion). The optical-SAR matching task forces BNN to learn useful fusion features. Then, the left-CNN can be further used as the backbone of the SAR detection framework to perform ship detection. Based on the two pretraining techniques, we obtained the OSD pretraining based SAR ship detector (OSD-SSD) and the OSM pretraining based SAR ship detector (OSM-SSD), to solve the inconsistency across different imaging perspective and different imaging geometry, respectively. Furthermore, we propose to combine the two detectors to get a more comprehensively better detector based on the observation of their different advantages. Specifically, since the optical-SAR matching task mainly focuses on land area, the plentiful texture features from the optical images can help distinguish the building structures, resulting in fewer false alarms on land area using OSM-SSD. In contrast, the OSD-SSD can help identify and locate ships on sea area because of more ships’ annotation information from the aerial image dataset. Considering these complementary advantages, we employ the weighted boxes fusion (WBF) strategy 1 to fuse the predictions of OSD-SSD and OSM-SSD. The WBF strategy utilizes confidence scores of all predicted bounding boxes to construct the averaged boxes including confidence scores and coordinate locations, leading to a SAR ship detector with better generalization ability. According to the above analysis, instead of designing sophisticated network structures and using specific tricks, we consider the incompatibility between the ImageNet pretraining technique and SAR images, and propose two complementary pretraining techniques to boost SAR ship detection. The overall process is depicted in Fig. 2. Particularly, we utilize the OSD pretraining technique and OSM pretraining technique to obtain two complementary backbones, and then further train OSD-SSD and OSM-SSD, respectively. Finally, we leverage the WBF strategy to fuse the predictions of the two detectors. The main contributions of our work can be summarized into the following four aspects: Improve the feature learning ability of ships in SAR images by proposing the OSD pretraining technique, which transfers the characteristics of ships in earth observations to SAR images by fully taking advantage of ships’ annotation information from a large-scale aerial image dataset 9; Enhance the general feature embedding of SAR images by proposing the OSM pretraining technique, which transfers plentiful texture features from optical images to SAR images by common representation learning via bridge neural networks (BNN) 0 on the optical-SAR matching task; Explore the complementary characteristics of the OSD pretraining based SAR ship detector (OSD-SSD) and OSM pretraining based SAR ship detector (OSM-SSD) and thus propose to employ the WBF strategy 1 to fuse the predictions of the two detectors for further improving detection results; Conduct various experiments on four SAR ship detection datasets 2 3 4 5 and two representative CNN-based detection benchmarks [ref]7 6 to verify the effectiveness and complementarity of the OSD-SSD and OSM-SSD detectors, and the state-of-the-art performance of the combination of the two detectors. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces our methods in details. Section III provides the experimental settings and results analysis.
