      "content": "Paper Title: Minimum Weight Euclidean (1+\"ERROR \\eps\")-SpannersA preliminary version of this paper appears in the Proceedings of the 48th International Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science (WG), LNCS, Springer, 2022.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor a set S𝑆S of n𝑛n points in a metric space and a parameter t≥1𝑡1t\\geq 1, a graph G=(S,E)𝐺𝑆𝐸G=(S,E) is a t𝑡t-spanner if G𝐺G contains, between every two points p,q∈S𝑝𝑞𝑆p,q\\in S, a p​q𝑝𝑞pq-path of weight at most t⋅‖p​q‖⋅𝑡norm𝑝𝑞t\\cdot\\|pq\\|, where ‖p​q‖norm𝑝𝑞\\|pq\\| denotes the distance between p𝑝p and q𝑞q. In other words, a t𝑡t-spanner distorts the true distances between any pair of points up to a factor t𝑡t; the parameter t𝑡t is the stretch factor of the spanner. Several optimization criteria have been considered for t𝑡t-spanners, such as the size (number of edges), the weight (sum of edge weights), the maximum degree, and the hop-diameter. Specifically, the sparsity of a spanner is the ratio |E|/|S|𝐸𝑆|E|/|S| between the number of edges and vertices; and the lightness is the ratio between the weight of a spanner and the weight of a minimum spanning tree (MST) on S𝑆S. In this paper, we focus on the Euclidean d𝑑d-space in constant dimension d∈ℕ𝑑ℕd\\in\\mathbb{N}. In this case, for every constant \\eps>0\\eps0\\eps>0, there exist (1+\\eps)1\\eps(1+\\eps)-spanners with sparsity and lightness that depends only on \\eps\\eps\\eps and d𝑑d.\nThe precise dependence on \\eps\\eps\\eps (assuming constant dimension d𝑑d) has almost completely been determined:\nEvery finite point set in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} admits a Euclidean (1+\\eps)1\\eps(1+\\eps)-spanner with Od​(\\eps1−d)subscript𝑂𝑑superscript\\eps1𝑑O_{d}(\\eps^{1-d}) sparsity and Od​(\\eps−d​log⁡\\eps−1)subscript𝑂𝑑superscript\\eps𝑑superscript\\eps1O_{d}(\\eps^{-d}\\log\\eps^{-1}) lightness. The sparsity bound is the best possible, and the lightness bound is tight up to the log⁡\\eps−1superscript\\eps1\\log\\eps^{-1} factor [ref]40. Several classical spanner constructions achieve sparsity Od​(\\eps1−d)subscript𝑂𝑑superscript\\eps1𝑑O_{d}(\\eps^{1-d}) in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} such as Yao-graphs    , ΘΘ\\Theta-graphs  , gap-greedy spanners  and path-greedy spanners ; see the book by Narasimhan and Smid  and the more recent surveys\nsurveys  .\nFor lightness, Das et al.    were the first to construct (1+\\eps)1\\eps(1+\\eps)-spanners of lightness \\eps−O​(d)superscript\\eps𝑂𝑑\\eps^{-O(d)} in Euclidean d𝑑d-space. This bound has been generalized to metric spaces with doubling dimension d𝑑d, see   . Recently, Le and Solomon [ref]40 showed that the path-greedy (1+\\eps)1\\eps(1+\\eps)-spanner in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} has lightness O​(\\eps−d​log⁡\\eps−1)𝑂superscript\\eps𝑑superscript\\eps1O(\\eps^{-d}\\log\\eps^{-1}); and so the same spanner achieves a tight bound for sparsity and an almost tight bound for lightness.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: lightness. The sparsity bound is the best possible, and the lightness bound is tight up to the log⁡\\eps−1superscript\\eps1\\log\\eps^{-1} factor [ref]40. Several classical spanner constructions achieve sparsity Od​(\\eps1−d)subscript𝑂𝑑superscript\\eps1𝑑O_{d}(\\eps^{1-d}) in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} such as Yao-graphs    , ΘΘ\\Theta-graphs  ,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
