Please, use the VLDBJ version, when it becomes available, if you need to cite the paper.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAssuming that we have a deterministic automaton,\nthe next question is how we can build a probabilistic model that captures the statistical properties of the streams to be processed by this automaton.\nWith such a model,\nwe could then make inferences about the automaton’s expected behavior as it reads event streams.\nOne approach would be to map each state of the automaton to a state of a Markov chain,\nthen apply the automaton on a training stream of symbols,\ncount the number of transitions from each state to every other target state and use these counts to calculate the transition probabilities.\nThis is the approach followed in . However, there is an important issue with the way in which this approach models transition probabilities.\nNamely, a probability is attached to the transition between two states,\nsay state 1 and state 2,\nignoring the way in which state 1 has been reached, i.e.,\nfailing to capture the sequence of symbols.\nFor example, in Figure 3,\nstate 00 can be reached after observing symbol b𝑏b or symbol c𝑐c.\nThe outgoing transition probabilities do not distinguish between the two cases.\nInstead, they just capture the probability of a𝑎a given that the previous symbol was b𝑏b or c𝑐c.\nThis introduces ambiguity and if there are many such states in the automaton,\nwe may end up with a Markov chain that is first-order (with respect to its states),\nbut nevertheless provides no memory of the stream itself.\nIt may be unable to capture first-order (or higher order) dependencies in the stream of events. In the worst case (if every state can be reached with any symbol), such a Markov chain may essentially assume that the stream is composed of i.i.d. events. An alternative approach,\nfollowed in [ref]7 ,\nis to first set a maximum order m𝑚m that we need to capture\nand then iteratively split each state of the original automaton into as many states as required so that each new state can remember the past m𝑚m symbols that have led to it.\nThe new automaton that results from this splitting process is equivalent to the original,\nin the sense that they recognize the same language,\nbut can always remember the last m𝑚m symbols of the stream.\nWith this approach,\nit is indeed possible to guarantee that m𝑚m-order dependencies can be captured.\nAs expected though, higher values of m𝑚m can quickly lead to an exponential growth of the number of states and the approach may be practical only for low values of m𝑚m. We propose the use of a variable-order Markov model (VMM) to mitigate the high cost of increasing the order m𝑚m\n     .\nThis allows us to increase m𝑚m to values not possible with the previous approaches and thus capture longer-term dependencies,\nwhich can lead to a better accuracy.\nAn alternative would be to use hidden Markov models (HMMs) ,\nwhich are generally more expressive than bounded-order (either full or variable) Markov models.\nHowever, HMMs often require large training datasets  .\nAnother problem is that it is not always obvious how a domain can be modeled through HMMs and a deep understanding of the domain may be required .\nThe relation between an automaton and the observed state of a HMM is not straightforward\nand it is not evident how a HMM would capture an automaton’s behavior. Different Markov models of variable order have been proposed in the literature\n(see  for a nice comparative study).\nThe general approach of such models is as follows:\nlet ΣΣ\\Sigma denote an alphabet,\nσ∈Σ𝜎Σ\\sigma\\in\\Sigma a symbol from that alphabet and s∈Σm𝑠superscriptΣ𝑚s\\in\\Sigma^{m} a string of length m𝑚m of symbols from that alphabet.\nThe aim is to derive a predictor P^^𝑃\\hat{P} from the training data such that the average log-loss on a test sequence S1..kS_{1..k} is minimized.\nThe loss is\ngiven by\nl​(P^,S1..k)=−1T​∑i=1kl​o​g​P^​(ti∣t1​⋯​ti−1)l(\\hat{P},S_{1..k})=-\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{i=1}^{k}log\\hat{P}(t_{i}\\mid t_{1}\\cdots t_{i-1}).\nMinimizing the log-loss is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood P^​(S1..k)=∏i=1kP^​(ti∣t1​…​ti−1)\\hat{P}(S_{1..k})=\\prod_{i=1}^{k}\\hat{P}(t_{i}\\mid t_{1}\\dots t_{i-1}).\nThe average log-loss may also be viewed as a measure of the average compression rate achieved on the test sequence .\nThe mean (or expected) log-loss (−𝑬P​{l​o​g​P^​(S1..k)}-\\boldsymbol{E}_{P}\\{log\\hat{P}(S_{1..k})\\}) is minimized if the derived predictor P^^𝑃\\hat{P} is indeed the actual distribution P𝑃P of the source emitting sequences. For full-order Markov models,\nthe predictor P^^𝑃\\hat{P} is derived through the estimation of conditional distributions P^​(σ∣s)^𝑃conditional𝜎𝑠\\hat{P}(\\sigma\\mid s),\nwith m𝑚m constant and equal to the assumed order of the Markov model.\nVariable-order Markov Models (VMMs), on the other hand, relax the assumption of m𝑚m being fixed.\nThe length of the “context” s𝑠s (as is usually called) may vary,\nup to a maximum order m𝑚m,\naccording to the statistics of the training dataset.\nBy looking deeper into the past only when it is statistically meaningful,\nVMMs can capture both short- and long-term dependencies.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: In the worst case (if every state can be reached with any symbol), such a Markov chain may essentially assume that the stream is composed of i.i.d. events.
