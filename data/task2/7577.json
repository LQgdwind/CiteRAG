      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Algorithm Selection: A Proof-of-Principle Study on Differential Evolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile adaptive and ensemble DE algorithms have shown significant progress, the dependence on manual mechanisms and expert knowledge could potentially hinder their further development. Consequently, some researchers have turned to machine learning methods, particularly Reinforcement Learning techniques, in search of breakthroughs¬†. Research in this field primarily concentrates on DE configuration, including the selection of mutation and crossover operators, as well as the values of FùêπF and C‚Äãrùê∂ùëüCr.\nFor operator selection, TSRL-DE¬†,\nRLDMDE¬†,\nDEDQN¬† and DEDDQN¬† employed Q-Learning¬† and Deep Q-Learning agents¬† [ref]36 to select mutation operators for each individual in every generation\nand promote the backbone algorithm performance on several CEC benchmark problems.\nRegarding parameter tuning, LDE¬†[ref]37 utilized LSTM¬† to determine the FùêπF and C‚Äãrùê∂ùëüCr values for each individual, based on the states consisting of fitness values and statistics.\nFurthermore, some researchers sought more comprehensive control by combining both operator and parameter control, such as the RLHPSDE¬†. Current RL-Assisted DE algorithms primarily concentrate on adapting configurations within individual DE algorithms. Given there are plenty of well-performed DE algorithms for different problems, it would be appealing to adopt the RL agents for dynamic algorithm selection, which is, however, a research gap so far. Additionally, the current RL-assisted works arise from the small size of training and testing sets¬†  [ref]37, which could adversely impact their generalization ability.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: of mutation and crossover operators, as well as the values of FùêπF and C‚Äãrùê∂ùëüCr.\nFor operator selection, TSRL-DE¬†,\nRLDMDE¬†,\nDEDQN¬† and DEDDQN¬† employed Q-Learning¬† and Deep Q-Learning agents¬† [ref]36 to select mutation operators for each individual in every generation\nand promote the backbone algorithm performance on several CEC benchmark problems.\nRegarding parameter tuning, LDE¬†[ref]37\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
