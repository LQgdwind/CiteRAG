      "content": "Paper Title: Lane Detection with Versatile AtrousFormer and Local Semantic Guidance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we will demonstrate the performance of our network on CULane, TuSimple, and BDD100K, respectively. For CULane, the quantitative and visualization results under nine scenarios are showed in Tab.1 and Fig.5, respectively.\nThe quantitative results for TuSimple and BDD100K are listed in Tab.2 and Tab.3. Algorithms to compare include FastDraw , SpinNet , UFAST [ref]37, R18-E2E [ref]38, R34-E2E [ref]38, ERFNet-E2E [ref]38, SCNN [ref]14, ENet-SAD , ERFNet-IntRA-KD , PINet , Curvelanes-NAS , RESA , LaneATT , and SIM-CycleGan . All of the results are borrowed from their official publishings. CULane Results Analysis. In Tab.1, the XR18-Ours and XR34-Ours are used to represent implementations based on enhanced ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, respectively. The R18-Light represents the one of ResNet18+Local AtrousFormer (slice size (18, 20))+LSGD. It can be seen that overall our network achieves 70.03, 77.63, and 78.08 scores in terms of F1F1\\rm{F1} metric. Our encoder-enhanced network (XR18-Ours and XR34-Ours) surpasses the current state of the art LaneATT by 2.54 and 1.4 points on ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, respectively. As for those adopting temporally-recurrent based segmentation methods on ResNet34, SCNN and RESA, XR34-Ours tops them by 3.58 and 6.48 points, respectively. For different environments of Normal, Crowded, Dazzle, Shadow, NoLine, Arrow, Curve, Cross and Night,\nXR34-Ours achieves (1) 0.69, 0.93, 3.01, -0.29, 0.76, 0.28, 3.42, 276 and 3.02 gains more than LaneATT, (2) 2.23, 6.26, 10.98, 10.96, 6.75, 4.56, 6.74,936, and 7.64 gains more than SCNN, and (3) 0.93, 6.62, 2.98, 5.86, 3.85, 0.56, 2.54, 842, and 3.94 gains more than RESA on ResNet34. Coupled with the visualization results of R34-Ours in Fig.5, we can safely say that our network has a strong inference ability. It is able to complete the lane instance according to the environment, even in the dark situation (see the ninth image).\nIn terms of running time, R18-Light tops SCNN and RESA by 96 ms and 2 ms, respectively, while keeping satisfying performance. The XR34-Ours is approximately 3×3\\times faster than our predecessor SCNN on ResNet34. TuSimple Results Analysis. The quantitative results on TuSimple in Tab.2 to validate the performance of our network. It can be seen that our network obtains an accuracy of 96.59 and 96.71 on ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, respectively. The results are very approximate to the highest scores achieved by RESA. Under metric FP, our method gets the best performance of 2.82. BDD100K Results Analysis. On BDD100k, only some of the semantic segmentation methods can be reported due to the constraints of complex lane forms in Tab.3. This is also one of the most important merits of our AtrousFormer, able to model more complex lanes. The results are showed in Tab3. It can be seen that XR18-Ours surpasses ERFNet-SAD by 22.53 points and 6.79 points in terms of accuracy and IOU metrics, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: nine scenarios are showed in Tab.1 and Fig.5, respectively.\nThe quantitative results for TuSimple and BDD100K are listed in Tab.2 and Tab.3.
