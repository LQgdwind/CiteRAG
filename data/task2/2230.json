These works focus on adapting to the geometric transformations of a camera but do little to combat other shifts, like changes in environment such as indoor or outdoor. Works utilise supervisory signals such as skeleton or pose  and corresponding frames from multiple viewpoints [ref]30 . Recent works have used GRLs to create a view-invariant representation . Though several modalities (RGB, flow and depth) have been investigated, these were aligned and evaluated independently. On the other hand, before deep-learning, heterogenous domain adaptation (HDA) for action recognition used shallow models to align source and target distributions of handcrafted features   . Three recent works attempted deep HDA  [ref]42 . These apply GRL adversarial training to C3D , TRN  or both  architectures. Jamal et al.’s approach [ref]42 outperforms shallow methods that use subspace alignment. Chen et al.  show that attending to the temporal dynamics of videos can improve alignment. Pan et al.  use a crossdomain attention module, to avoid uninformative frames. Two of these works use RGB only  [ref]42 while  reports results on RGB and Flow, however, modalities are aligned independently and only fused during inference. The approaches  [ref]42  are evaluated on 5-7 pairs of domains from subsets of coarse-grained action recognition and gesture datasets, for example aligning UCF  to Olympics . We evaluate on 6 pairs of domains. Compared to [ref]42, we use 3.8x more training and 2x more testing videos. The EPIC-Kitchens  dataset for fine-grained action recognition released two distinct test sets—one with seen and another with unseen/novel kitchens. In the 2019 challenges report, all participating entries exhibit a drop in action recognition accuracy of 12-20% when testing their models on novel environments compared to seen environments.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Among all of the domain adaptation techniques in activity recognition in computer vision, the most successful one is is the problem of cross-viewpoint (or viewpoint-invariant) action recognition [ref]30   [ref]36 .
