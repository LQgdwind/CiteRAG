      "content": "Paper Title: End-to-End Deep Learning of Lane Detection and Path Prediction for Real-Time Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLane detection is an essential task of advanced driver assistance systems\n(ADAS) in modern vehicles and autonomous driving systems in self-driving\ncars for lane keeping assistance, departure warning, and centering     [ref]5     0. There are two major paradigms,\nnamely, classic computer vision and deep learning, for lane detection . The classic computer vision paradigm requires intensive feature\nengineering, road modeling, and special case handling and is thus not robust\nenough to deal with seemingly infinite driving situations, environments, and\nunexpected obstacles . The deep learning paradigm has\nshown considerable progress to alleviate these difficulties in recent years . Path prediction (lane following) is also a crucial task of ADAS and\nself-driving vehicles for active driving assistance and lateral and\nlongitudinal controls  [ref]5  . It depends on various factors of\nvehicles and road and traffic environment such as ego vehicle’s speed and\nsteering angle, road geometry, and the other closest in-path vehicle  [ref]5  . It also involves perception, sensory, and control systems in\nthe ego vehicle [ref]5 . UNet 1 is an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN)\n2 for semantic segmentation. It achieved remarkable success in many\ncompetitions 3 due to its elegant architecture of symmetrical contracting\n(encoding) and expanding (decoding) sub-networks with skip connections that combine\nsemantic (global) and appearance (local) information from both sub-networks 4. The accuracy and efficiency of CNNs are equally important in a variety of applications such as robotics, mobile devices, and self-driving cars 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4. The concept of depthwise separable convolutions 5 (a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution 6) has been used to construct many efficient CNNs 5 6 7 8 9 1 2. We apply this concept to UNet 1 (DSUNet) for semantic road segmentation and lane detection and integrate DSUNet (or other CNNs) with path prediction (PP) algorithm to form a simulation model (CNN-PP) that can be used to assess CNN’s performance qualitatively, quantitatively, and dynamically in a host agent car driving along with other agents all in a real-time autonomous manner 4 6. The small segmantation network DSUNet not only has real-time performance with merits on energy and memory consumption but also attains sufficient accuracy in dynamic traffic. We show that DSUNet is 5.16x lighter and 1.61x faster than UNet with comparable accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: essential task of advanced driver assistance systems\n(ADAS) in modern vehicles and autonomous driving systems in self-driving\ncars for lane keeping assistance, departure warning, and centering     [ref]5     0.
