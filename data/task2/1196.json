      "content": "Paper Title: ROME: Robustifying Memory-Efficient NAS via Topology Disentanglement and Gradient Accumulation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDifferentiable Neural Architecture Search.\nSimilar to   that uses a directed acyclic graph to represent a cell, DARTS [ref]24 constructs a cell-based supernet and further introduces architectural weights to represent the importance of each operation.\nDARTS proposes two types (first-order and second-order) of approximation that alternatively update operation parameters and architectural weights with stochastic gradient descent. However, since the supernet subsumes all connections and operations within the search space, DARTS risks exhausting GPU memory.\nA possible attempt to resolve this issue is done by progressively pruning operations\n[ref]5, which is still an indirect approach and requires strong regularization tricks. Apart from that, recent works   also point out an instability phenomenon of DARTS. These issues significantly restrict its application. Memory-efficient NAS.\nTo reduce GPU memory cost, several prior works have revised the forward procedure of the supernet. PC-DARTS 0 makes use of partial connections instead of the full-fledged supernet. Some works    proposes to merge all parametric operations into one convolution, a similar super-kernel strategy is also used in single-path NAS .\nProxylessNAS  samples two operations on each edge during the search process, which enables proxyless searching on large datasets. Single-path supernets like SPOS  and FairNAS  sample only a single path at each iteration, however, both require an additional searching stage to choose the final models. Single-path differentiable methods like GDAS  sample a subgraph of the DAG at each iteration, which is by far the most efficient. However, we observe that a severe instability issue occurs, which has been previously neglected. Performance collapse of DARTS. The collapse issue is one of the most critical problems in differentiable architecture search [ref]20 0   . It has been shown that DARTS [ref]24 prefers to choose parameterless operations, leading to its performance collapse [ref]20 . Recent works   utilize the eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix as an indicator of collapse and design various techniques to regularize high eigenvalues. Instead, other works [ref]20 [ref]5 directly constrain the number of skip connections as 2 to avoid collapse. Nonetheless, the previous methods are specifically designed for the full-path training scheme. Whereas the collapse problem in single-path has been rarely studied.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Differentiable Neural Architecture Search.\nSimilar to   that uses a directed acyclic graph to represent a cell, DARTS [ref]24 constructs a cell-based supernet and further introduces architectural weights to represent the importance of each operation.\nDARTS proposes two types (first-order and second-order) of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
