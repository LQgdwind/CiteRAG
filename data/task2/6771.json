      "content": "Paper Title: Towards a Comprehensive Human-Centred Evaluation Framework for Explainable AI\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExplainable AI (XAI) is advancing fast: between 2017 and 2021 alone, the number of XAI papers increased eight-fold  and researchers have proposed XAI methods for virtually all existing media types and families of AI models.\nHowever, it is still unclear to what extent explanations are effective in practice [ref]34 because full-fledged standardised evaluation procedures are missing. This is partly due to lacking consensus on which explanation properties should be assessed and which measurements should be used [ref]35    [ref]34. To better assess XAI methods, researchers have tried to disentangle explanation’s characteristics into simple measurable properties such as completeness   [ref]5, novelty    , and interactivity   . However, there is little evidence on how these properties relate to explanations being appropriate in real scenarios . In addition, while many researchers stress the importance of context, we are unaware of XAI evaluation methods that treat explanations’ effects on humans as a complex user experience involving factors such as user perception and system interaction. To evaluate explanations holistically, we are working towards a human-centred evaluation framework for XAI, which extends pioneering work on developing and evaluating user experience  and explanations  for recommender systems. We categorise explanation properties according to this framework and indicate their relations reported in the literature. Additionally, we present the explanation elements that help to classify metrics to simplify the choice of measurements. This adapted user-centric framework will allow researchers and practitioners to evaluate explanations of AI-based systems and potentially increase deployment of such systems in their respective domains  [ref]34. The contributions of this paper are three-fold: first, we present an extensive analysis of existing definitions of explanation properties and methods, as well as their interrelationships. Our analysis aligns different properties and methods as defined by different research communities. Second, based on this analysis, we define a human-centred evaluation framework for XAI that presents an integrative approach and combines user-centric evaluation and functional metrics. Third, we present an example of the use of this framework.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: and researchers have proposed XAI methods for virtually all existing media types and families of AI models.\nHowever, it is still unclear to what extent explanations are effective in practice [ref]34 because full-fledged standardised evaluation procedures are missing.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
