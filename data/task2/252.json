      "content": "Paper Title: No-Regret Learning Dynamics for Extensive-Form Correlated Equilibrium\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe problem of computing an optimal EFCE in extensive-form games with more than two players and/or chance moves is known to be NP-hard [ref]50.\nHowever, Huang and von Stengel  show that the problem of finding one EFCE can be solved in polynomial time via a variation of the Ellipsoid Against Hope algorithm  .\nThis holds for arbitrary EFGs with multiple players and/or chance moves.\nUnfortunately, that algorithm is mainly a theoretical tool, and it is known to have limited scalability beyond toy problems.\nDudík and Gordon [ref]15 provide an alternative sampling-based algorithm to compute EFCEs.\nHowever, their algorithm is centralized and based on MCMC sampling which may limit its practical appeal.\nOur framework is arguably simpler and based on the classical counterfactual regret minimization algorithm  .\nMoreover, our framework is fully decentralized since each player, at every decision point, plays so as to minimize her internal/external regret. If we restrict our attention to two-player perfect-recall games without chance moves, than the problem of determining an optimal EFCE can be characterized through a succint linear program with polynomial size in the game description [ref]50.\nIn this setting, Farina et al.  show that the problem of computing an EFCE can be formulated as the solution to a bilinear saddle-point problem, which they solve via a subgradient descent method.\nMoreover, Farina et al. [ref]21 design a regret minimization algorithm suitable for this specific scenario.\nIn a recent paper, Farina and Sandholm  showed that that an optimal EFCE,\nEFCCE and NFCCE can be computed in polynomial time in the game size in\ntwo-player general-sum games that satisfy a condition known as triangle-freeness. The triangle-freeness condition holds, for example, when all chance moves are public, that is, both players observe all chance moves.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: The problem of computing an optimal EFCE in extensive-form games with more than two players and/or chance moves is known to be NP-hard [ref]50.\nHowever, Huang and von Stengel  show that the problem of finding one EFCE can be solved in polynomial time via a variation of the Ellipsoid Against Hope algorithm  .\nThis holds for arbitrary\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
