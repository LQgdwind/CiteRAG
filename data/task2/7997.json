      "content": "Paper Title: Circuits and Backdoors: Five Shades of the SETH\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs mentioned, SETH-based lower bounds are an area of very active research in\nparameterized complexity. Beyond the results following ,\nwhich establish running time lower bounds of the form (c−ε)k​nO​(1)superscript𝑐𝜀𝑘superscript𝑛𝑂1(c-\\varepsilon)^{k}n^{O(1)}, for\nsome parameter k𝑘k and fixed constant c𝑐c, the SETH has also been used to\nobtain lower bounds for non-FPT problems. The most famous example is perhaps\nthe result of Patrascu and Williams that k𝑘k-Dominating Set cannot be\nsolved in time nk−εsuperscript𝑛𝑘𝜀n^{k-\\varepsilon}, under the SETH . The question of whether the SETH is the “right” assumption has appeared\nbefore in the literature. In general fine-grained complexity this manifests\nitself via works which attempt to replace the SETH with more plausible\nassumptions, such as the ones mentioned above, or which attempt to prove the\nsame lower bound based on several hypotheses which have no known relation\n . Furthermore, the question of which problems are\nexactly equivalent to the SETH has already been posed, though few such\nproblems are known . We also note that the connection\nbetween the NC-SETH and Barrington’s theorem was already used in\n. In the area of parameterized complexity, investigations on whether the SETH is the right complexity assumption have mostly focused on whether, assuming the\nSETH we can obtain the same lower bounds but for more restricted cases than\nfor treewidth ( 7). However, a strongly related recent\nwork [ref]31 investigated the so-called pw-SETH, that is, the\nhypothesis that SAT cannot be solved in time\n(2−ε)pw​|ϕ|O​(1)superscript2𝜀pwsuperscriptitalic-ϕ𝑂1(2-\\varepsilon)^{\\textrm{pw}}|\\phi|^{O(1)}. Even though this is closely related to our\nmotivation, the pw-SETH turns out to cover a completely different algorithmic\nparadigm, as it essentially speaks about the optimality of dynamic programming\nalgorithms, while the hypotheses we consider here refer to the optimality of\nbranching algorithms under different regimes. As a result, most of the\nhypotheses we consider here imply the pw-SETH, with the exception of Circuit-SETH,\nfor which this remains an interesting open problem.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: assumption have mostly focused on whether, assuming the\nSETH we can obtain the same lower bounds but for more restricted cases than\nfor treewidth ( 7).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
