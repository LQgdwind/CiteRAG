      "content": "Paper Title: RepVGG: Making VGG-style ConvNets Great Again\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA classic Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet), VGG , achieved huge success in image recognition with a simple architecture composed of a stack of conv, ReLU, and pooling. With Inception    , ResNet [ref]12 and DenseNet , a lot of research interests were shifted to well-designed architectures, making the models more and more complicated. Some recent architectures are based on automatic    or manual [ref]28 architecture search, or a searched compound scaling strategy 5. Though many complicated ConvNets deliver higher accuracy than the simple ones, the drawbacks are significant. 1) The complicated multi-branch designs (e.g., residual-addition in ResNet and branch-concatenation in Inception) make the model difficult to implement and customize, slow down the inference and reduce the memory utilization. 2) Some components (e.g., depthwise conv in Xception  and MobileNets  0 and channel shuffle in ShuffleNets  ) increase the memory access cost and lack supports of various devices. With so many factors affecting the inference speed, the amount of floating-point operations (FLOPs) does not precisely reflect the actual speed. Though some novel models have lower FLOPs than the old-fashioned ones like VGG and ResNet-18/34/50 [ref]12, they may not run faster (Table. 4). Consequently, VGG and the original versions of ResNets are still heavily used for real-world applications in both academia and industry. In this paper, we propose RepVGG, a VGG-style architecture which outperforms many complicated models (Fig. 1). RepVGG has the following advantages. The model has a VGG-like plain (a.k.a. feed-forward) topology 111In this paper, a network topology only focuses on how the components connect to others, an architecture refers to the topology together with the specification of components like depth and width, and a structure may refer to any component or part of the architecture. without any branches, which means every layer takes the output of its only preceding layer as input and feeds the output into its only following layer. The model’s body uses only 3×3333\\times 3 conv and ReLU. The concrete architecture (including the specific depth and layer widths) is instantiated with no automatic search , manual refinement [ref]28, compound scaling 5, nor other heavy designs. It is challenging for a plain model to reach a comparable level of performance as the multi-branch architectures. An explanation is that a multi-branch topology, e.g., ResNet, makes the model an implicit ensemble of numerous shallower models 6, so that training a multi-branch model avoids the gradient vanishing problem. Since the benefits of multi-branch architecture are all for training and the drawbacks are undesired for inference, we propose to decouple the training-time multi-branch and inference-time plain architecture via structural re-parameterization, which means converting the architecture from one to another via transforming its parameters. To be specific, a network structure is coupled with a set of parameters, e.g., a conv layer is represented by a 4th-order kernel tensor. If the parameters of a certain structure can be converted into another set of parameters coupled by another structure, we can equivalently replace the former with the latter, so that the overall network architecture is changed. Specifically, we construct the training-time RepVGG using identity and 1×1111\\times 1 branches, which is inspired by ResNet but in a different way that the branches can be removed by structural re-parameterization (Fig. 2,4). After training, we perform the transformation with simple algebra, as an identity branch can be regarded as a degraded 1×1111\\times 1 conv, and the latter can be further regarded as a degraded 3×3333\\times 3 conv, so that we can construct a single 3×3333\\times 3 kernel with the trained parameters of the original 3×3333\\times 3 kernel, identity and 1×1111\\times 1 branches and batch normalization (BN)  layers. Consequently, the transformed model has a stack of 3×3333\\times 3 conv layers, which is saved for test and deployment. Notably, the body of an inference-time RepVGG only has one single type of operator: 3×3333\\times 3 conv followed by ReLU, which makes RepVGG fast on generic computing devices like GPUs. Even better, RepVGG allows for specialized hardware to achieve even higher speed because given the chip size and power consumption, the fewer types of operators we require, the more computing units we can integrate onto the chip. Consequently, an inference chip specialized for RepVGG can have an enormous number of 3×3333\\times 3-ReLU units and fewer memory units (because the plain topology is memory-economical, as shown in Fig. 3). Our contributions are summarized as follows. We propose RepVGG, a simple architecture with favorable speed-accuracy trade-off compared to the state-of-the-arts. We propose to use structural re-parameterization to decouple a training-time multi-branch topology with an inference-time plain architecture. We show the effectiveness of RepVGG in image classification and semantic segmentation, and the efficiency and ease of implementation.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: classic Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet), VGG , achieved huge success in image recognition with a simple architecture composed of a stack of conv, ReLU, and pooling.
