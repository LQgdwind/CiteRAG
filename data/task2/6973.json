With respect to particular graph classes, as we already mentioned, VCD⁡(ℬ⁡(G))≤4VCDℬ𝐺4\\operatorname{VCD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}(G))\\leq 4 for the class of planar graphs, and, in this case, it is unclear how to even obtain an NCTMNCTM\\operatorname{NCTM} for ℬ⁡(G)ℬ𝐺\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}(G) whose size is at most a relatively small constant, i.e., much smaller than 615615615 (see the introduction). Further, for trees of cycles, which are planar, we were only able to obtain an NCTMNCTM\\operatorname{NCTM} of size 444, while VCD⁡(ℬ⁡(G))≤3VCDℬ𝐺3\\operatorname{VCD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}(G))\\leq 3 in this case. Hence, in regards to the open question mentioned in   , for the class of planar graphs, ℬ⁡(G)ℬ𝐺\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}(G) is a good candidate for a concept class whose NCTDNCTD\\operatorname{NCTD} exceeds its VC-dimension, and trees of cycles may be a good starting point. The NCTMNCTM\\operatorname{NCTM}s for particular graph classes obtained in this paper are simpler than the labeled SCSs obtained in 0. Therefore, it seems reasonable to investigate NCTMNCTM\\operatorname{NCTM}s for two important classes of graphs in metric graph theory: median graphs and Helly graphs. Do median graphs admit NCTMNCTM\\operatorname{NCTM}s bounded by their cube-dimension (which is a lower bound for VCD⁡(ℬ⁡(G))VCDℬ𝐺\\operatorname{VCD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}(G)) for this class) or do Helly graphs admit NCTMNCTM\\operatorname{NCTM}s bounded by their clique number?\nMedian graphs are discrete analogs and far-reaching generalizations of hypercubes and ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-spaces, while Helly graphs are discrete analogs of injective spaces and ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}-spaces. Note that, for the balls in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑{\\mathbb{R}}^{d} endowed with the\nℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}- or ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}-metrics (as well as with the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-metric), it is easy to construct NCTMNCTM\\operatorname{NCTM}s of size bounded by their VC-dimension (since such balls are octahedra, axis-parallel cubes, and Euclidean balls, respectively).\nLastly, it would be interesting to investigate NCTMNCTM\\operatorname{NCTM}s for shortest-path-closed concept classes (i.e., concept classes 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}} on V𝑉V whose 1-inclusion graph is an isometric subgraph of the hypercube {−1,+1}Vsuperscript11𝑉\\{-1,+1\\}^{V}).\nWhile deciding if NCTD⁡(𝒞)=1NCTD𝒞1\\operatorname{NCTD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}})=1 is NP-complete for general concept classes , the same decision problem is polynomial-time solvable if 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}} is shortest-path-closed [20, Theorem 37]. Note that maximum classes, ample (a.k.a. extremal) classes, and, more generally,\nComplexes of Oriented Matroids, are all shortest-path-closed, and unlabeled or labeled SCSs of size VCD⁡(𝒞)VCD𝒞\\operatorname{VCD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}) are known for them 1 [ref]35 5. Further, it is open whether ample classes admit RMs of size VCD⁡(𝒞)VCD𝒞\\operatorname{VCD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}) 1. Hence, one can ask whether NCTD⁡(𝒞)≤VCD⁡(𝒞)NCTD𝒞VCD𝒞\\operatorname{NCTD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}})\\leq\\operatorname{VCD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}) for ample classes. Finally, one may ask whether other classes of graphs admit approximate NCTMNCTM\\operatorname{NCTM}s.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: more generally,\nComplexes of Oriented Matroids, are all shortest-path-closed, and unlabeled or labeled SCSs of size VCD⁡(𝒞)VCD𝒞\\operatorname{VCD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}) are known for them 1 [ref]35 5.
