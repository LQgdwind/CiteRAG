      "content": "Paper Title: Sketching Merge Trees for Scientific Data Visualization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe begin by reviewing the notion of a merge tree that arises from a scalar field.\nWe then introduce the technical background needed to map a merge tree to a column vector in the data matrix.\nOur framework utilizes the probabilistic matching from the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) framework of Chowdhury and Needham , with a few ingredients from Peyre et al. . Merge trees.  Let f:𝕄→ℝ:𝑓→𝕄ℝf:{\\mathbb{M}}\\to{\\mathbb{R}} be a scalar field defined on the domain of interest 𝕄𝕄{\\mathbb{M}}, where 𝕄𝕄{\\mathbb{M}} can be a manifold or a subset of ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑{\\mathbb{R}}^{d}.\nFor our experiments in section 5, 𝕄⊂ℝ2𝕄superscriptℝ2{\\mathbb{M}}\\subset{\\mathbb{R}}^{2}.\nMerge trees capture the connectivity among the sublevel sets of f𝑓f, i.e., 𝕄a=f−1​(−∞,a]subscript𝕄𝑎superscript𝑓1𝑎{\\mathbb{M}}_{a}=f^{-1}(-\\infty,a].\nFormally, two points x,y∈𝕄𝑥𝑦𝕄x,y\\in{\\mathbb{M}} are equivalent, denoted by x∼ysimilar-to𝑥𝑦x\\sim y, if f​(x)=f​(y)=a𝑓𝑥𝑓𝑦𝑎f(x)=f(y)=a, and x𝑥x and y𝑦y belong to the same connected component of a sublevel set 𝕄asubscript𝕄𝑎{\\mathbb{M}}_{a}.\nThe merge tree, T(𝕄,f)=𝕄/∼T({\\mathbb{M}},f)={\\mathbb{M}}/{\\sim}, is the quotient space obtained by gluing together points in 𝕄𝕄{\\mathbb{M}} that are equivalent under the relation ∼similar-to\\sim.\nTo describe a merge tree procedurally, as we sweep the function value a𝑎a from −∞-\\infty to ∞\\infty, we create a new branch originating at a leaf node for each local minimum of f𝑓f.\nAs a𝑎a increases, such a branch is extended as its corresponding component in 𝕄asubscript𝕄𝑎{\\mathbb{M}}_{a} grows until it merges with another branch at a saddle point.\nIf 𝕄𝕄{\\mathbb{M}} is connected, all branches eventually merge into a single component at the global maximum of f𝑓f, which corresponds to the root of the tree.\nFor a given merge tree, leaves, internal nodes, and root node represent the minima, merging saddles, and global maximum of f𝑓f, respectively.\nFigure 2 displays a scalar field with its corresponding merge tree embedded in the graph of the scalar field.\nAbstractly, a merge tree T𝑇T is a rooted tree equipped with a scalar function defined on its node set, f:V→ℝ:𝑓→𝑉ℝf:V\\to{\\mathbb{R}}. Gromov-Wasserstein distance for measure networks.  The GW distance was proposed by Memoli   for metric measure spaces.\nPeyre et al.  introduced the notion of a measure network and defined the GW distance between such networks.\nThe key idea is to find a probabilistic matching between a pair of networks by searching over the convex set of couplings of the probability measures defined on the networks. A finite, weighted graph G𝐺G can be represented as a measure network using a triple (V,W,p)𝑉𝑊𝑝(V,W,p), where V𝑉V is the set of n𝑛n nodes, W𝑊W is a weighted adjacency matrix, and p𝑝p is a probability measure supported on the nodes of G𝐺G.\nFor our experiments, p𝑝p is taken to be uniform, that is, p=1n​𝟏n𝑝1𝑛subscript1𝑛p=\\frac{1}{n}{\\mathbf{1}_{n}}, where 𝟏n=(1,1,…,1)T∈ℝnsubscript1𝑛superscript11…1𝑇superscriptℝ𝑛{\\mathbf{1}_{n}}=(1,1,\\dots,1)^{T}\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^{n}. Let G1​(V1,W1,p1)subscript𝐺1subscript𝑉1subscript𝑊1subscript𝑝1G_{1}(V_{1},W_{1},p_{1}) and G2​(V2,W2,p2)subscript𝐺2subscript𝑉2subscript𝑊2subscript𝑝2G_{2}(V_{2},W_{2},p_{2}) be a pair of graphs with n1subscript𝑛1n_{1} and n2subscript𝑛2n_{2} nodes, respectively.\nLet [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n] denote the set {1,2,…,n}12…𝑛\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}.\nV1={xi}i∈[n1]subscript𝑉1subscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑖delimited-[]subscript𝑛1V_{1}=\\{x_{i}\\}_{i\\in[n_{1}]} and V2={yj}j∈[n2]subscript𝑉2subscriptsubscript𝑦𝑗𝑗delimited-[]subscript𝑛2V_{2}=\\{y_{j}\\}_{j\\in[n_{2}]}.\nA coupling between probability measures p1subscript𝑝1p_{1} and p2subscript𝑝2p_{2} is a joint probability measure on V1×V2subscript𝑉1subscript𝑉2V_{1}\\times V_{2} whose marginals agree with p1subscript𝑝1p_{1} and p2subscript𝑝2p_{2}.\nThat is, a coupling is represented as an n1×n2subscript𝑛1subscript𝑛2n_{1}\\times n_{2} non-negative matrix C𝐶C such that C​𝟏n2=p1𝐶subscript1subscript𝑛2subscript𝑝1C{\\mathbf{1}_{n_{2}}}=p_{1} and CT​𝟏n1=p2superscript𝐶𝑇subscript1subscript𝑛1subscript𝑝2C^{T}{\\mathbf{1}_{n_{1}}}=p_{2}.\nGiven matrix C𝐶C, its binarization is an n1×n2subscript𝑛1subscript𝑛2n_{1}\\times n_{2} binary matrix, denoted as 𝟏C>0subscript1𝐶0{\\mathbf{1}_{C>0}}: this matrix has 111 where C>0𝐶0C>0, and 00 elsewhere. The distortion of a coupling C𝐶C with an arbitrary loss function L𝐿L is defined as  Let 𝒞=𝒞​(p1,p2)𝒞𝒞subscript𝑝1subscript𝑝2{\\mathcal{C}}={\\mathcal{C}}(p_{1},p_{2}) denote the collection of all couplings between p1subscript𝑝1p_{1} and p2subscript𝑝2p_{2}.\nThe Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancy  is defined as In this paper, we consider the quadratic loss function L​(a,b)=12​|a−b|2𝐿𝑎𝑏12superscript𝑎𝑏2L(a,b)=\\frac{1}{2}|a-b|^{2}.\nThe Gromov-Wasserstein distance    dG​Wsubscript𝑑𝐺𝑊d_{GW} between G1subscript𝐺1G_{1} and G2subscript𝐺2G_{2} is defined as It follows from the work of Sturm [ref]55 that such minimizers always exist and are referred to as optimal couplings. Alignment and blowup.  Given a pair of graphs G1=(V1,W1,p1)subscript𝐺1subscript𝑉1subscript𝑊1subscript𝑝1G_{1}=(V_{1},W_{1},p_{1}) and G2=(V2,W2,p2)subscript𝐺2subscript𝑉2subscript𝑊2subscript𝑝2G_{2}=(V_{2},W_{2},p_{2}) with n1subscript𝑛1n_{1} and n2subscript𝑛2n_{2} nodes respectively, a coupling C∈𝒞​(p1,p2)𝐶𝒞subscript𝑝1subscript𝑝2C\\in{\\mathcal{C}}(p_{1},p_{2}) can be used to align their nodes.\nIn order to do this, we will need to increase the size of G1subscript𝐺1G_{1} and G2subscript𝐺2G_{2} appropriately into their respective blowup graphs G1′subscriptsuperscript𝐺′1G^{\\prime}_{1} and G2′subscriptsuperscript𝐺′2G^{\\prime}_{2}, such that G1′subscriptsuperscript𝐺′1G^{\\prime}_{1} and G2′subscriptsuperscript𝐺′2G^{\\prime}_{2} contain the same n𝑛n number of nodes (where n1,n2≤nsubscript𝑛1subscript𝑛2𝑛n_{1},n_{2}\\leq n).\nRoughly speaking, let x𝑥x be a node in G1subscript𝐺1G_{1}, and let nxsubscript𝑛𝑥n_{x} be the number of nodes in G2subscript𝐺2G_{2} that have a nonzero coupling probability with x𝑥x.\nThe blowup graph G1′=(V1′,W1′,p1′)subscriptsuperscript𝐺′1subscriptsuperscript𝑉′1subscriptsuperscript𝑊′1subscriptsuperscript𝑝′1G^{\\prime}_{1}=(V^{\\prime}_{1},W^{\\prime}_{1},p^{\\prime}_{1}) is created by making nxsubscript𝑛𝑥n_{x} copies of node x𝑥x for each node in G1subscript𝐺1G_{1}, generating a new node set V1′subscriptsuperscript𝑉′1V^{\\prime}_{1}. The probability distribution p1′subscriptsuperscript𝑝′1p^{\\prime}_{1} and the weight matrix W1′subscriptsuperscript𝑊′1W^{\\prime}_{1} are updated from p1subscript𝑝1p_{1} and W1subscript𝑊1W_{1} accordingly.\nSimilarly, we can construct the blowup G2′=(V2′,W2′,p2′)subscriptsuperscript𝐺′2subscriptsuperscript𝑉′2subscriptsuperscript𝑊′2subscriptsuperscript𝑝′2G^{\\prime}_{2}=(V^{\\prime}_{2},W^{\\prime}_{2},p^{\\prime}_{2}) of G2subscript𝐺2G_{2}. An optimal coupling C𝐶C expands naturally to a coupling C′superscript𝐶′C^{\\prime} between p1′subscriptsuperscript𝑝′1p^{\\prime}_{1} and p2′subscriptsuperscript𝑝′2p^{\\prime}_{2}.\nAfter taking appropriate blowups, C′superscript𝐶′C^{\\prime} can be binarized to be an n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n permutation matrix, and used to align the nodes of the two blown-up graphs.\nThe GW distance is given by a formulation equivalent to Equation 3 based on an optimal coupling, Fréchet mean.  Given a collection of graphs 𝒢={G1,G2,…,GN}𝒢subscript𝐺1subscript𝐺2…subscript𝐺𝑁{\\mathcal{G}}=\\{G_{1},G_{2},\\dots,G_{N}\\}, a Fréchet mean  G¯¯𝐺\\overline{G} of 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}} is a minimizer of the functional F​(H,𝒢)=1N​∑i=1NdG​W​(Gi,H)𝐹𝐻𝒢1𝑁superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑁subscript𝑑𝐺𝑊subscript𝐺𝑖𝐻F(H,{\\mathcal{G}})=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}d_{GW}(G_{i},H) over the space 𝒩𝒩{\\mathcal{N}} of measure networks, Chowdhury and Needham  defined the directional derivative and the gradient of the functional F​(H,𝒢)𝐹𝐻𝒢F(H,{\\mathcal{G}}) at H𝐻H and provided a gradient descent algorithm to compute the Fréchet mean.\nTheir iterative optimization begins with an initial guess H0subscript𝐻0H_{0} of the Fréchet mean.\nAt the kt​hsuperscript𝑘𝑡ℎk^{th} iteration, there is a two-step process: each Gisubscript𝐺𝑖G_{i} is first blown-up and aligned to the current Fréchet mean, Hksubscript𝐻𝑘H_{k}; then Hksubscript𝐻𝑘H_{k} is updated using the gradient of the functional F​(Hk,𝒢)𝐹subscript𝐻𝑘𝒢F(H_{k},{\\mathcal{G}}) at Hksubscript𝐻𝑘H_{k}.\nSuch a two-step process is repeated until convergence where the gradient vanishes.\nFor the complete algorithmic and implementational details, see .\nIf G¯=(V¯,W¯,p¯)¯𝐺¯𝑉¯𝑊¯𝑝\\overline{G}=(\\overline{V},\\overline{W},\\overline{p}) is the Fréchet mean, then we have where Wk′subscriptsuperscript𝑊′𝑘W^{\\prime}_{k} is the weight matrix obtained by blowing-up and aligning Gk∈𝒢subscript𝐺𝑘𝒢G_{k}\\in{\\mathcal{G}} to G¯¯𝐺\\overline{G}.\nThat is, when all the graphs in 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}} are blown-up and aligned to G¯¯𝐺\\overline{G}, the weight matrix of G¯¯𝐺\\overline{G} is given by a simple element-wise average of the weight matrices of the graphs. A simple example.  We give a simple example involving a pair of merge trees in Figure 3.\nT1subscript𝑇1T_{1} and T2subscript𝑇2T_{2} contain 8 and 6 nodes, respectively (nodes are labeled starting with a 00 index).\nThe optimal coupling C𝐶C obtained by the gradient descent algorithm is visualized in Figure 3(A).\nC𝐶C is an 8×6868\\times 6 matrix, and it shows that node 0 in T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} is matched to node 5 in T2subscript𝑇2T_{2} with the highest probability (0.120.120.12, red stars).\nNode 4 in T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} is coupled with both node 0 (with a probability 0.080.080.08) and node 1 (with a probability 0.040.040.04) in T2subscript𝑇2T_{2} (green stars). Now, we compute the Fréchet mean T¯¯𝑇\\overline{T} of T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} and T2subscript𝑇2T_{2}, which has 12 nodes.\nWe align both T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} and T2subscript𝑇2T_{2} to T¯¯𝑇\\overline{T} via their blowup graphs.\nThis gives rise to a coupling matrix between T¯¯𝑇\\overline{T} and T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} (of size 12×812812\\times 8) in Figure 3(B), and a coupling matrix between T¯¯𝑇\\overline{T} and T2subscript𝑇2T_{2} (of size 12×612612\\times 6) in Figure 3(C), respectively.\nAs shown in Figure 3, root node 10 of T¯¯𝑇\\overline{T} is matched with root node 0 of T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} and root node 5 of T2subscript𝑇2T_{2} (red stars).\nNode 0 of T¯¯𝑇\\overline{T} is matched probabilistically with node 4 in T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} and nodes 00 and 111 in T2subscript𝑇2T_{2} (green stars).\nNow both trees T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} and T2subscript𝑇2T_{2} are blown-up to be T1′subscriptsuperscript𝑇′1T^{\\prime}_{1} and T2′subscriptsuperscript𝑇′2T^{\\prime}_{2}, each with 12 nodes, and can be vectorized into column vectors of the same size.\n\nReference markers found: [55]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]55: Gromov-Wasserstein distance    dG​Wsubscript𝑑𝐺𝑊d_{GW} between G1subscript𝐺1G_{1} and G2subscript𝐺2G_{2} is defined as It follows from the work of Sturm [ref]55 that such minimizers always exist and are referred to as optimal couplings.
