      "content": "Paper Title: BundleTrack: 6D Pose Tracking for Novel Objects without Instance or Category-Level 3D Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n6D Object Pose Tracking - For setups where object CAD\nmodels are available, significant progress has been made in 6D pose tracking. This includes techniques based on hand-crafted probabilistic filtering [ref]27  , optimization [ref]12   , and machine learning  . The requirements, however, of such instance-level 3D models, either for training offline or model-frame registration during tracking, complicate generalization to novel instances. More recently, a 6D pose tracking approach  relaxed the assumption to category-level 3D models using 3D object CAD model databases for training . During testing, the target object category needs to be identified and the corresponding network for that category is utilized for tracking. Instead of being limited to the number of categories such database is able to include, this work employs deep features that in principle can be trained on arbitrary 2D images. It allows generalization to diverse novel objects, as shown in the accompanying experiments. Dynamic Object-aware SLAM - In order to track dynamic objects’ pose and decouple them from static background, frame-model Iterative Closest Point (ICP) combined with color    , probabilistic data association , or 3D level-set likelihood maximization  has been applied. Object models are simultaneously reconstructed on-the-fly by aggregating the observed RGB-D data with the newly tracked pose. Nevertheless, frame-model tracking can be challenging for object reconstruction, since errors in pose estimation transfer to the reconstructed model and adversely affect the subsequent tracking . This work does not fuse observed frames but instead maintains them as nodes in a pose graph, allowing to correct previously erroneous estimates, and reduces drift in long-term tracking. The aforementioned SLAM-family approaches may also face challenges in robot manipulation setups that involve small, textureless, flat or shiny objects due to the dearth of sufficient correspondences between the pair of consecutive frames. To ameliorate this issue, BundleTrack searches correspondences among current and multiple historical frames, consisting of both feature and geometric terms, as the edges in the pose graph. Its effectiveness has been shown in extensive experiments including for such challenging manipulation scenarios. 3D Hand-held Object Scanning - Promising results have been demonstrated in scanning dynamic hand-held objects     [ref]39, where the object’s motion needs to be taken into account similar to the current setup. In particular, a framework for robot manipulation  performs simultaneous object reconstruction and tracking, which leads to similar issues as the aforementioned dynamic SLAM methods. In addition, forward kinematics is required in its Kalman Filtering framework, preventing generalization in scenarios when objects are not held by the robotic manipulator. While estimating object poses is part of the scanning process, there are key differences from online 6D pose tracking. For the scanning application, external assistance including human interaction or deliberate motion is acceptable   [ref]39 but it is not assumed in the current work. Furthermore, time consuming global-optimization steps are often adopted at the end of scanning to polish the models and their poses while intermediate erroneous pose estimations and associated frames can be discarded and not fused into the global model   [ref]39. In contrast, this work aims to provide fast and accurate pose tracking output online.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: Pose Tracking - For setups where object CAD\nmodels are available, significant progress has been made in 6D pose tracking.
