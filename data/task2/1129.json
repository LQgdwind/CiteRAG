      "content": "Paper Title: The Complexity of Finding Fair Independent Sets in Cycles\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo obtain our results we present a chain of reductions, as described in Figure 1.\nOur starting point is the Consensus Halving problem with precision parameter ε𝜀\\varepsilon, in which given a collection of m𝑚m probability measures on the interval    the goal is to partition the interval into two pieces using relatively few cuts, so that each of the measures has the same mass on the two pieces up to an error of ε𝜀\\varepsilon (see Definition 2.1).\nIt is known that every instance of this problem has a solution with at most m𝑚m cuts even for ε=0𝜀0\\varepsilon=0  (see also  [ref]7) and that the problem of finding such a solution is 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}-hard for some constant ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 7. In Section 2, we reduce the Consensus Halving problem to an intermediate variant of the ε​-Fair-Split-Cycle𝜀-Fair-Split-Cycle\\varepsilon\\textsf{-}\\textsc{Fair-Split-Cycle} problem, which we call ε​-Fair-Split-Path′𝜀superscript-Fair-Split-Path′\\varepsilon\\textsf{-}\\textsc{Fair-Split-Path}^{\\prime} (see Definition 2.4). Then, we use this reduction to obtain our hardness results for the Fair-IS-Cycle and Fair-Split-Cycle problems.\nThe reduction borrows a discretization argument that was used in [ref]24 to reduce the Consensus Halving problem to the Splitting Necklace problem with two thieves.\nThis argument enables us to transform a Consensus Halving instance into a path and a partition of its vertex set, for which the goal is to partition the path using relatively few cuts into two parts, each of which contains roughly half of the vertices of every set in the partition. In order to relate this problem to independent sets that fairly represent the partition, we need an additional simple trick. Between every two consecutive vertices of the path we add a new vertex and put all the new vertices in a new set added to the partition of the vertex set.\nWe then argue, roughly speaking, that two disjoint independent sets in the obtained path, which fairly represent the partition and cover almost all of the vertices, can be used to obtain a solution to the original instance. The high-level idea is that those few vertices that are uncovered by the two independent sets can be viewed as cuts, and every path between two such vertices alternates between the two given independent sets. By construction, it means that only one of the two independent sets contains in such a path original vertices (that is, vertices that were not added in the last phase of the reduction), hence every such path can be naturally assigned to one of the two pieces required by the Consensus Halving problem.\nCombining our reduction with the known hardness results of Consensus Halving, we derive the 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}-hardness of Fair-IS-Cycle and of ε​-Fair-Split-Cycle𝜀-Fair-Split-Cycle\\varepsilon\\textsf{-}\\textsc{Fair-Split-Cycle} for a constant ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, as needed for Theorems 1.3, 1.5, and 1.6. In Section 3, we introduce and study the Schrijver problem.\nWe reduce the Fair-IS-Cycle problem to the Schrijver problem, implying that the latter is 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}-hard.\nThe reduction follows an argument of Aharoni et al.  who used the chromatic number of the Schrijver graph  to prove the existence of the independent set required in Fair-IS-Cycle.\nFinally, employing arguments of Meunier  and Alishahi and Meunier , we reduce the Schrijver and Fair-Split-Cycle problems to the search problem associated with the Octahedral Tucker lemma (see Definition 3.3). Since it is known, already from , that this problem lies in 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}, we get that Fair-IS-Cycle, Fair-Split-Cycle, and Schrijver are all members of 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}, completing the proofs of Theorems 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7. We remark that one could consider analogues of the Fair-IS-Cycle and Fair-Split-Cycle problems for paths rather than for cycles and obtain similar results.\nWe have chosen to focus here on the cycle setting, motivated by the computational aspects of the ‘cycle plus triangles’ problem   .\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: on the two pieces up to an error of ε𝜀\\varepsilon (see Definition 2.1).\nIt is known that every instance of this problem has a solution with at most m𝑚m cuts even for ε=0𝜀0\\varepsilon=0  (see also  [ref]7) and that the problem of finding such a solution is 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}-hard for some constant ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 7.
