      "content": "Paper Title: Quasi-Framelets: Another Improvement to Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor a self-explained paper, in this section, the basic definitions of heterogeneous graphs, meta-paths used for heterogeneous graphs as well as relative concepts are reviewed. A heterogeneous graph is defined as a directed graph HG = (𝒱,ℰ,𝒮,ℛ)𝒱ℰ𝒮ℛ(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E},\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{R}) where each node v𝑣v and each edge e𝑒e are associated with their type mapping function τ​(υ)𝜏𝜐\\tau(\\upsilon): V→𝒮→𝑉𝒮V\\rightarrow\\mathcal{S} and ϕ​(e):E→ℛ:italic-ϕ𝑒→𝐸ℛ\\phi(e):E\\rightarrow\\mathcal{R}, respectively. A meta-path ΦΦ\\Phi is defined as a path in the form of S1→R1S2→R2…→RlSlsubscript𝑅1→subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2subscript𝑅2→…subscript𝑅𝑙→subscript𝑆𝑙S_{1}\\xrightarrow{R_{1}}S_{2}\\xrightarrow{R_{2}}...\\xrightarrow{R_{l}}S_{l}, which describes a composite relation R=R1∘R2∘…∘Rl𝑅subscript𝑅1subscript𝑅2…subscript𝑅𝑙R=R_{1}\\circ R_{2}\\circ...\\circ R_{l} between objects S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} and Sl+1subscript𝑆𝑙1S_{l+1}, where ∘\\circ denotes the composition operator on relations. Clearly a meta-path ΦΦ\\Phi defines a relation R𝑅R between two nodes v𝑣v and u𝑢u of types S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} and SLsubscript𝑆𝐿S_{L}. In this case, we call u𝑢u is a meta-path ΦΦ\\Phi neighbor of node v𝑣v. Also we say that there is a relation R𝑅R between node v𝑣v and u𝑢u. Denote by NvΦsuperscriptsubscript𝑁𝑣ΦN_{v}^{\\Phi} the set of all such neighbors of a node v𝑣v. Given a meta-path ΦΦ\\Phi whose starting vertices are of type S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} and ending vertices are of type Slsubscript𝑆𝑙S_{l}, the meta-path based graph 𝒢Φsuperscript𝒢Φ\\mathcal{G}^{\\Phi} is a graph constructed from all node pairs v∈S1𝑣subscript𝑆1v\\in S_{1} and u∈Sl𝑢subscript𝑆𝑙u\\in S_{l} that connect via meta-path P𝑃P. A meta-path based adjacency matrix AΦsuperscript𝐴ΦA^{\\Phi} can be constructed. Meta-path based graphs can exploit different aspects of structure information in heterogeneous graph. Majority of heterogeneous graph embeddings can be categorized into random walk-based and neural network-based methods. However, both of these methods mainly consider meta-paths or meta-graphs to incorporate heterogeneous structural information. For example, metapath2vec  designs a meta-path based random walk and utilizes skip-gram to perform heterogeneous graph embedding. The random walk-based model only considers metapath-based semantic information but loses enough information about graph structures. Meanwhile, this type of “shallow” models is limited to be applied for transductive tasks which means they cannot deal with nodes that do not appear in the training process. On the other hand, Meta-path Aggregated Graph Neural Network (MAGNN) [ref]8 defines meta-path-based neighbor nodes and propagates feature and structural information along meta-paths to generate the embedding of the target type node. Heterogeneous attention networks [ref]27 consider attention of nodes and semantics and learn node embeddings from meta-path-based neighbors. Similar to MAGNN [ref]8, HAN [ref]27 adopts the message passing framework to apply a spatial-based graph convolution for node representation learning, while this paper focus on spectral-based methods. Besides, Heterogeneous graph neural networks [ref]31 set up a unified framework to jointly introduce heterogeneity in node feature information and graph structures, without considering the semantics in heterogeneous graphs. Heterogeneous graphs are a type of information network, containing either multiple types of objects or multiple types of relations. In heterogeneous graphs, objects can be connected via edges of various types. The employment of meta-paths can capture the relation types between two node types. Besides, based on meta-paths, a heterogeneous graph can be broken into a set of per-meta-path subgraphs and further, be represented as a set of meta-path-based adjacency matrices. In this paper, we are only concerned with the meta-path based graphs in which the two ending nodes of the meta-path are in a same given type S𝑆S (i.e. S1=SL=Ssubscript𝑆1subscript𝑆𝐿𝑆S_{1}=S_{L}=S). This type of meta-aoth based graph is indeed a homogeneous graph in which all the nodes are in the unique type and edges (paths) are in the same type too. In a number of applications represented in such as HAN [ref]27, HGT  and HGCN , the heterogeneous graph neural networks are built on their homogeneous meta-path based subgraphs. In our experiments, when we adopt the framelet analysis for heterogeneous graphs, we break down the heterogeneous graphs into such homogeneous subgraphs and learns filters based on framelet domain to multiscale structure information hidden in a heterogeneous graph.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: limited to be applied for transductive tasks which means they cannot deal with nodes that do not appear in the training process.
