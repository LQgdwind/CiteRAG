      "content": "Paper Title: Elastic Composition of Crowdsourced IoT Energy Services\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe concept of Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a result of the advancement of multiple technologies such as wireless communication, low-power sensors, and embedded systems . In IoT environment, devices (aka, things) capabilities are augmented with sensors, computing resources, and network connectivity . The service paradigm is congruent with the concept of IoT . In this regard, we leverage the service paradigm to abstract the functional and non-functional properties, i.e., Quality of Service (QoS) of IoT devices capabilities as IoT services . The proliferation of IoT services has the potential to develop a self-sustained crowdsourced IoT ecosystem . People may exchange IoT services such as computing offloading, communication proxies, energy sharing, etc. These services are key building blocks to develop novel peer-to-peer sharing applications in a smart city. For example, a set of co-located smartphones in a coffee shop may provide computing power or storage space for any resource-constrained IoT user [ref]5. A smartphone with depleting battery may get energy from nearby wearables wirelessly . This crowdsourced IoT ecosystem is similar to Uber where people share their cars for ridesharing. In this paper, we focus on IoT energy crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing energy as a service is the process of delivering outsourced wireless energy from IoT service providers to IoT users (i.e., consumers) . Energy services have the potential of creating a green service exchange environment. Energy could be harvested using renewable energy sources. For example, a smart shoe may harvest energy from the physical activity of its userÂ 0. This energy may be used to charge nearby IoT devices wirelessly 1. There exist several wireless energy transfer technologies which can deliver up to 3 Watts power within 5-meter distance to multiple receivers111https://www.energous.com/222https://wi-charge.com/. Wireless charging may provide a convenient alternative as users do not need to look for power banks or sockets. The composition of IoT services is paramount in the crowdsourced IoT environment . A single crowdsourced IoT service may not fulfill the requirement of a consumer 2. Multiple services need to be combined. Composing crowdsourced IoT services requires the real-time selection and discovery of nearby IoT devices to accommodate an IoT service request . Therefore, space and time attributes are crucial to model and select crowdsourced IoT services. We focus on composing crowdsourced IoT energy services. Existing service composition techniques in multiple domains such as Web services, cloud computing and mobile computing mainly focus on the deterministic properties of a service 3 4. However, they did not address issues arising from resource constrained IoT devices 5 6. We identify the intrinsic characteristics of crowdsourced IoT energy services which are fundamentally different from traditional services as follows. Flexibility: The temporal and spatial attributes of energy services and requests might be subject to different levels of flexibility 7. An energy service provider might leave the confined area at any time. Consumers may stay longer than their predefined time interval to acquire more energy. Fluctuation: IoT energy service providers may advertise their surplus energy as an IoT energy service. However, they may use their IoT devices and provide energy at the same time. Energy services may fail due to the extreme usage of the IoT device by their owners. Providers might also cease provisioning services due to limited battery capacity 5. Mobility: Energy service providers and consumers must be available at the same time and location, i.e., within a predefined wireless transmission range, to ensure a successful wireless energy transfer. It is not always guaranteed to find nearby energy services which satisfy the required energy during a specified time interval. IoT energy providers may move and may not maintain the wireless transmission range with the consumer. Crowdsourced energy services may exhibit an intermittent provision behavior 8. Among above characteristics, fluctuation and mobility may impact the reliability of crowdsourced energy services 29. The usage and the movement of IoT users may violate the advertised properties of energy services. Therefore, we need to select the most reliable services to satisfy an energy request. We propose a composition framework of crowdsourced IoT energy services to fulfill userâs energy requirements within a specified time interval in confined areas e.g., coffee shop and restaurant. We focus on only the fluctuation of services and the flexibility of consumers which may cause failures for the energy services. In the future work, we will include the mobility of IoT energy providers and consumers in a crowdsourced IoT environment. We propose an elastic composition of crowdsourced energy services considering the fluctuation of energy services and the flexibility of IoT users. The elastic composition algorithm extends our previous temporal knapsack-based composition algorithm . Similar to\ntraditional service composition techniques, the temporal knapsack-based composition algorithm relies on the initial description of services i.e., advertisement to generate the composition plans 3 4. In a crowdsourced IoT environment, these composition techniques may not be applied. In real-time, IoT energy services may differ from their advertisement due to the fluctuation of service providers behaviors. A service provider may not be able to provide the advertised energy services due to various reasons, e.g., failures and incorrect assessment of available energy capacity 0. Service composition plans need to be recomputed whenever a participating service fails. The real-time re-composition may require an undetermined waiting time for available IoT energy services which may extend the initial specified time interval of the energy request. It is not always guaranteed to find nearby energy services during the time interval of the energy request to replace the failed services. Available services may be already reserved for other consumers. The elastic composition ensures the minimum waiting time by selecting and reserving an optimal set of services among the fluctuating crowdsourced IoT energy services ahead of time. We consider the reliability to assess the performance of the services based on the fluctuating behavior of the device owners. The reliability assessment is used to select the optimal services. The proposed composition framework leverages the  flexibility of IoT energy consumers to find a composition with the highest reliability. The charging time interval of consumers is defined based on their daily activity model for their convenience 7 1 e.g., the time and the duration spent by IoT user in a coffee shop. Usually, the pattern of time spent in regularly visited places e.g., coffee shops or food courts can be defined by a range between the  minimum and the maximum time spent 2. We incorporate the flexibility of IoT energy consumers based on the range of their usual stay in a confined area. We define two deadlines for the energy query time interval. a) soft deadline, and b) hard deadline. The significance of the elastic composition is to complete the IoT usersâ energy requirements in the dynamic crowdsourced IoT environment by preventing failure-prone services within a flexible predefined time interval. If a satisfactory amount of energy could not be accumulated by composing reliable services during the soft deadline, the elastic composition may extend the composition interval up to the hard deadline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to design the elastic composition for crowdsourced IoT energy services. The main contributions of this paper are: A temporal composition algorithm of crowdsourced energy services in a predefined time interval. A multi-objective heuristic-based composition algorithm to maximize the reliability and minimize the time extensions between the soft and hard deadlines. Experimental evaluation and analysis are conducted based on real-world datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed elastic composition framework.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: peer-to-peer sharing applications in a smart city.
