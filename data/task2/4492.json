      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable computational algorithms for geo-spatial COVID-19 spread in high performance computing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne-level methods only communicate and exchange information with adjacent subdomains. This strategy is effective to reduce the high frequency component of error. When the number of subdomains is large, one-level methods converge slowly due to significant low-frequency components of error. The efficient global exchange of information among subdomains can be used to reduce the low-frequency component of error which enhance scalability. This is achieved using two-grid methods through coarse corrections . A coarse space correction is constructed to remove the low-frequency component of the error due to small eigenvalues in the preconditioned one-level matrix. Intuitively, these components represent constant functions for a Poisson problem or rigid body modes for elasticity . For a complex problem, where simple representation of the coarse space components is not available, a simple solution is to use a coarser triangulation from which the fine grid is constructed by refinement leading to a grid coarse space. In what follows, we will explain how the coarse correction matrix is built for a grid coarse space. Fig. 3 shows a square domain with overlapping subdomains and underlying finite element mesh. We construct a rectangular matrix 𝐙𝐙\\mathbf{Z} of size n×nc𝑛subscript𝑛𝑐n\\times n_{c} which is an interpolation operator from coarse to fine grid, where n𝑛n is the total number of degrees of freedom and ncsubscript𝑛𝑐n_{c} is the number of coarse degrees of freedom. A coarse matrix 𝐀c=𝐑0​𝐀𝐑0Tsubscript𝐀𝑐subscript𝐑0superscriptsubscript𝐀𝐑0𝑇\\mathbf{A}_{c}=\\mathbf{R}_{0}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{R}_{0}^{T}, is constructed using the Galerkin projection where 𝐑0=𝐙Tsubscript𝐑0superscript𝐙𝑇\\mathbf{R}_{0}=\\mathbf{Z}^{T} or by directly assembling the given PDE in the coarse grid. An additive coarse correction constructed from this coarse grid is applied to the one-level preconditioner in Eq. 16 as , where 𝐐=𝐑0T​𝐀c−1​𝐑0𝐐superscriptsubscript𝐑0𝑇superscriptsubscript𝐀𝑐1subscript𝐑0\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{R}_{0}^{T}\\mathbf{A}_{c}^{-1}\\mathbf{R}_{0} is the global coarse correction. Other variants such as deflated and hybrid forms of corrections can also be applied to obtain favourable properties . Multiplicative corrections update the residual in between various levels providing better convergence rate than additive corrections . We utilize the multilevel parallel implementational architechture from PETSc [ref]6 (more implementational details in Section 3.2) to construct a two-grid preconditioner with multiplicative corrections. A three-step correction is applied with a one-level RAS preconditioner as pre-smoother, post-smoother, and a coarse grid correction in between them. A combination of these three corrections applied at different levels (fine-coarse-fine) can be combined to construct the two-grid preconditioner as below. Consider three preconditioners 𝐏𝟏,𝐏𝟐,𝐏𝟑subscript𝐏1subscript𝐏2subscript𝐏3\\bf{P_{1},P_{2},P_{3}} applied to the system as pre-smoother, coarse correction, and post-smoother respectively as , Substituting Eq. 18 into Eq. 19 and further Eq. 19 into Eq. 20 gives us, where 𝐏𝟓subscript𝐏5\\mathbf{P_{5}} is our desired preconditioner expanded as, Using 𝐏𝟏=𝐏𝟑=𝐌RAS−1subscript𝐏1subscript𝐏3superscriptsubscript𝐌RAS1\\mathbf{P_{1}}=\\mathbf{P_{3}}=\\mathbf{M}_{\\rm{RAS}}^{-1} and 𝐏𝟐=𝐐subscript𝐏2𝐐\\mathbf{P_{2}}=\\mathbf{Q}, the final two-grid preconditioner can be written as, where 𝐏=(𝐈−𝐀𝐐)𝐏𝐈𝐀𝐐\\mathbf{P}=(\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{AQ}) is the projection matrix.\nThe residual is recalculated at each level using an updated solution which results in multiplicative corrections. Resriction and interpolation operators are 𝐑0subscript𝐑0\\mathbf{R}_{0} and 𝐑0Tsuperscriptsubscript𝐑0𝑇\\mathbf{R}_{0}^{T} respectively as defined earlier. For the two-grid preconditioner above, it is evident that the coarse problem has the same structure as the original problem and hence it can be constructed just by using an interpolation operator from the original system matrix. It also couples all the subdomains enabling global error propagation. However, for very large meshes, the system size grows rendering the solution of the coarse problem computationally expensive using a direct solver. In these cases, it is useful to adopt a preconditioner to iteratively solve the coarse problem 𝐀c−1superscriptsubscript𝐀𝑐1\\mathbf{A}_{c}^{-1} in the coarse correction 𝐐𝐐\\mathbf{Q} effectively to reduce the execution time and memory requirement.\nTo this end, we adopt two choices: (i)𝑖(i) a one-level RAS preconditioner as in Eq. 16, (i​i)𝑖𝑖(ii) an algebraic multigrid (AMG) V-cycle preconditioner . Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the AMG preconditioner is more effective than the one-level RAS preconditioner. Next, we briefly explain the multigrid method relevant to the problem. Multigrid methods offer hierarchy of grids (geometric or algebraic) on which errors are iteratively reduced  [ref]45  . The error in the iterative solution is decomposed into geometrically oscillatory and non-oscillatory parts. By utilizing a simple and cheap solver/smoother, highly oscillatory components of the errors are removed through a smoothing/relaxation step. The remaining non-oscillatory errors in the fine grid are corrected using a coarse grid. The advantage lies in the fact that geometrically smooth errors in fine grid become oscillatory in coarse grid which are then removed easily. After solving for the error in coarse grid they are interpolated back to fine grid to correct the solution . Following the same steps repeatedly in cycles on these grids reduces the errors to required precision. Algebraic multigrid works on the same principle but does not depend on geometric information on the grid for error reduction . This is useful for complex domains with unstructured meshes where construction of coarse grid is difficult. In AMG, each entries in the system matrix are analyzed to find the strength of dependence/strength of influence among elements which allows construction of coarse levels  . Using such multi-level preconditioner for coarse grid solvers improves the scalability of the two-grid RAS solver of the original system.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: corrections update the residual in between various levels providing better convergence rate than additive corrections .
