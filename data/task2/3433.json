      "content": "Paper Title: A Novel Plug-in Module for Fine-Grained Visual Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual classification can be divided into coarse-grained and fine-grained classification. Coarse-grained classification represents the classification of categories with a large degree of dissimilarity, such as the classification of cats and dogs, while fine-grained classification represents classifications with a large degree of similarity, such as bird species, dog species, and the makes or models of vehicles[ref]4. ”Fine-grained” refers to more fine-grained divisions under common species classification. The challenges of fine-grained visual classification task is threefold. First, there is a lot of variation in the same category. Taking birds as an example, photos of the same bird from different angles can vary greatly in color and shape, as shown in Fig.1. The second point is that objects of different subcategories may be very similar. As shown in Fig.1, the textures of the three birds are very similar. The third point is that unlike coarse grained classification, fine-grained classification often requires professional experts to label data, which makes data more expensive. For the above reasons, frameworks that perform very well on coarse-grained classification tasks such as ResNet[ref]5, EfficientNet[ref]6, Vision Transformer (ViT)  will be very limited for fine-grained classification. To find strong discriminative regions to enhance the fine-grained visual classification, the proposed approaches can be classified into three categories. The first type of method finds regions through Region Proposal Network (RPN), such as NTS-Net, FDL0, and StackedLSTM1. The second type of method strengthens the feature map through the attention mechanism, such as CAL2, MA-CNN3, MAMC4, API-Net5, and WS-DAN6. The third type of method uses the strength of the attention-map in the self-attention mechanism as the judgment of discriminative regions, such as TransFG7 and FFVT8. The first two approaches are mainly based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), such as ResNet[ref]5, DenseNet9, and EfficientNet[ref]6, while the third is based on ViT to implement fine-grained visual classification. After finding these regions, the above approaches re-input the original image and feature maps to the network by cropping and resizing, or use an attention mechanism to strengthen the relationship between feature maps. The disadvantage of these approaches is that most of them require two-stage or multi-stage complex architectures and cannot be trained end-to-end. Furthermore, these localization methods tend to generate large prediction regions and are less able to focus on subtle local features. On the other hand, the Vit-based method directly uses the attention-map in the self-attention mechanism as the basis for selecting regions, avoiding the feedback-based architecture and achieving efficient end-to-end training. But this method is difficult to generalize to convolutional neural networks or other architectures, which means that its scalability is limited. In order to better understand the relationship between feature maps and object positions, we explore the relationship between the object detection models and the FGVC methods. From Faster-RCNN, YOLO01, and RetinaNet2, we can find that feature maps can be rich in location and category information. Segmentation methods such as Mask-RCNN3 give pixel-level predictions, i.e. fine-grained predictions. Although these methods demonstrate that feature maps are rich in semantics, they are learned by relying on human-annotated region information, unlike the FGVC task, which only uses image-level annotation for training. Therefore, we discuss Weakly Supervised Object Detection(WSOD) methods, such as WSDDN4, OICR5, and WCCN6, etc. The concept of the WSOD method is that the response of feature maps reflects the location of objects, and we can use these feature maps to complete bounding box prediction through an weakly supervised multi-stage architecture and loss function design. Based on the above analysis, we propose a plug-in module that can be added to many common backbones, which can be implemented on CNN-based or Transformer-based architectures. In addition, the plugin module outputs pixel-level feature maps and fuses the filtered features. To better detect key features of various sizes, we add the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)7 to the backbone network to mix spatial features of different scales. This architecture is very common in object detection tasks, and this approach can improve the quality of local representation. The idea of the plugin module is composed of three operations, including division, competition, and combination. Consider the example in Fig.2, the patches obtained by dividing the background are almost solid colours. This kind of patch will appear widely in different categories of data. If we use these patches for training, we can expect that the predicted distribution of the test images will be very flat. On the contrary, if we use the patches which contain discriminative objects for training, the predicted results would be more distinguishable. The reason is that nearly identical training data but labeled as different classes can lead to difficulty in converging on the sample space during the backward propagation. This phenomenon gives us the idea that the predicted class score can be used to divide the feature map into object candidate regions and background candidate regions. Divided object features of different scales will be fused for classification prediction, while the correction of the background area is aimed at a flat probability distribution. In this way, we can remove background noise and focus on important regions. This paper has the following two main contributions. We propose a novel plug-in network that can be applied to various models. This network integrates novel background segmentation and feature fusion techniques, which can effectively improve the accuracy of fine-grained visual classification. The proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art networks and improves the accuracy to 92.77% (+0.97%) and 92.83% (+1.83%) on CUB200-2011 and NABirds, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: classification of cats and dogs, while fine-grained classification represents classifications with a large degree of similarity, such as bird species, dog species, and the makes or models of vehicles[ref]4. ”Fine-grained” refers to more fine-grained divisions under common species classification.
