      "content": "Paper Title: Can deepfakes be created by novice users?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeepfakes have gained attention both in technical literature as well as media. The concept of Deepfakes combines emerging techniques in deep learning to create fake multimedia content. It is a form of manipulated image, video, or audio data which can potentially be created with malicious intent.\nDeepfake content is typically created with the following two objectives i) to superimpose a target personâ€™s video onto a video of a source person and mimic its actions and ii) to make the target person emulate audio from the source person. Pre-existing methods for generating artificial videos, use visual effects or computer graphics animation tools and require significant domain expertise to implement . On the other hand, Deepfake creation tools have become easily accessible and require limited technical knowledge of the creation of fake multi-media content. The most popular platforms used are FaceSwap , ZAO  and Reface [ref]4 among several others.\nDeepFakesLab, another Deepfake open-source software, provides a comprehensive package [ref]5 for implementing several video manipulations such as face swaps, face aging, superimposing fake audio alongside lip syncing. FaceForensics [ref]6  provides an open-source Deepfake image dataset. Deepfakes are typically created using generative neural\nnetworks like Variational Autoencoders (VAE) ,\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GAN)  or flow-based generative models 0. The model is trained to explicitly learn the probability distribution of the image (or audio) training dataset. This allows the network to generate unseen images (or audio) which have characteristics similar to the images (or audio) in the training set. Due to the abundance of image and audio data available online these days, particularly for images of popular actors, politicians and entrepreneurs, it has become increasingly easier to train Deepfake generation models and produce realistic fake audio as well as videos.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: creation tools have become easily accessible and require limited technical knowledge of the creation of fake multi-media content. The most popular platforms used are FaceSwap , ZAO  and Reface [ref]4 among several others.\nDeepFakesLab, another Deepfake open-source software, provides a comprehensive package [ref]5 for implementing several video manipulations such as face swaps, face aging,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. Generate exactly 40 titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning."
