One representative early effort is, [ref]40 embed the MoE layer into a recurrent language model.\nDue to the scalability of Transformer architecture, GShard [ref]25 integrates MoE into Transformer layer and uses expert parallelism to train MoE-based Transformer at scale.\nSwitch Transformer  is the earliest open-source MoE-based LM to our best knowledge, which used encoder-decoder architecture and trained with C4  dataset.\nDue to the success of Switch Transformer on large-scale pre-training, MoE got more attention, and more advanced routing algorithms were invented.\nFor instance, BASE Layers  formulates token-to-expert allocation as a linear assignment problem, allowing an optimal assignment in which each expert receives an equal number of tokens.\n7 simply modifies the feedforward layer to hash to different sets of weights depending on the current token and achieves promising results compared to learning-based routing.\nDifferent Token-based routing above,  propose to let experts select their favorite tokens, i.e., Expert-Choice Routing. Expert-choice Routing achieves more balanced token assignment and better cost-effectiveness trade-off. Beyond the routing algorithm, there is also some work focusing on scaling MoE efficiently.  trained their MoE models mainly on the datasets used in RoBERTa  and CC100  (112B tokens in total).\nGaLM  further scale decoder-only MoE model with an in-house high-quality dataset with 1.6T tokens.\nBrainformer  proposes an evolutionary search to discover MoE attributes, e.g., the best way to interleave layers and layer capacities, when to fuse layers, and when to specialize layers with MoE modules and show its effectiveness at different scales. In addition to language modeling, Vision Transformer (ViT)  can also be enhanced by MoE architecture. ViT-MoE 6 verifies the scalability of MoE on ViT models. WideNet  shares MoE-based Transformer blocks with individual layer normalization to achieve better parameter efficiency. SoftMoE 3 further improves the routing algorithm by applying soft token selection, which not only keeps the efficiency but also stabilizes the routing gradient. There are also some efforts devoted to include MoE into non-Transformer architecture, e.g., Sparse-MLP 0 for computer vision and s-MoE for language modeling .\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: MoE is not new. One representative early effort is, [ref]40 embed the MoE layer into a recurrent language model.\nDue to the scalability of Transformer architecture, GShard [ref]25 integrates MoE into Transformer layer and uses expert parallelism to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
