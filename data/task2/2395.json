      "content": "Paper Title: Intersectional Bias in Causal Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGender bias has been studied across language models involving word embeddings  and contextual embeddings [ref]35, as well as in neural machine translation (NMT)  and other natural language processing systems . Racial and religion-based bias is also increasingly studied in algorithmic systems [ref]18, and in language models specifically [ref]50 . Word embeddings, based on word2vec  and GLoVE , establish, for each unique term found in a text corpus, a set of weights that confer a sense of proximity to adjacent terms. For semantically related terms, such as ‘woman’, ‘man’ and other gender labels, their vectors within a d-dimensional space are likely to be similar (as measured by cosine similarity or other metrics), and together form a subspace that describes that similarity and represents a governing concept such as ‘gender’  . Differences between that subspace and other model tokens, such as occupational terms, form the basis for identifying bias. Transformer-based languages models such as BERT , ELMO  and GPT    add positional- and sentence-level to word- or token-level embeddings. These enable decoders responsible for translation, auto-completion or other tasks to attend to the context in which words or tokens appear. Such contextual embeddings make bias detection via cosine similarity of individual tokens more challenging, though [ref]50 shows one method for doing so. Other approaches generate sentences from pre-defined prompts or templates for analysis [ref]35  . Following , [ref]35  then use gender-swapping and compare the embeddings of suggested generated terms with principal component analysis. The resulting one or two components identify systematic bias in the association of occupation or other social roles with gender.    instead employ sentiment analysis to examine respectively, gendered, religious and racial bias. This provides less direct and systematic evaluation, but nonetheless generates a measure of bias encountered during language model use. Sentiment also provides a more generalisable measure for biases that may not relate to social roles such as occupation, but manifest in other forms. This is especially true for the kinds of bias we find below generated by label combinations that denote the intersection of multiple social categories.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: Gender bias has been studied across language models involving word embeddings  and contextual embeddings [ref]35, as well as in neural machine translation (NMT)  and other natural language processing systems .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
