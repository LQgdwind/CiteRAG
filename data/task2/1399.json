      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring Data Augmentation for Multi-Modality 3D Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThree-dimensional (3D) object detection is an essential vision task with wide applications. In the context of autonomous driving, encouraging results    have been obtained with point cloud data from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) devices.\nNonetheless, these single-modality LiDAR-based methods also have limitations: a typical LiDAR system can only perceive objects in a limited range [ref]1, and cannot distinguish semantic categories of similar structures, e.g., pedestrians and trees. Meanwhile, imagery features, by nature, play a complementary role. It is believed that imagery features can facilitate more accurate detection by providing richer semantic information.\nMuch effort has geared towards adding RGB camera images to complement point cloud data   [ref]25 [ref]43 .\nHowever, top methods on the popular benchmarks[ref]1  are mainly using single-modality.\nMulti-modality approaches, despite having more information, seem to attain only marginal improvement.\nThe reason of this counter-intuitive phenomenon remains obscure. This paper sets out to investigate why this is the case and finds it is the relatively insufficient data augmentation that make the performance of multi-modality algorithms under expectation.\nCompared to recent point cloud methods, multi-modality methods typically use fewer kinds of augmentations, which is mainly due to the difficulties in maintaining the consistency between point cloud and images.\nIn other words, multi-modality augmentations should ensure exact correspondence between a point in one modality and that of another modality after a series of transformations.\nWith such a constraint, previous methods [ref]25 [ref]43 find difficulties in applying random flipping or rotations.\nAn alternative way for finding the correspondence is to use the inputs before augmentation.\nHowever, it is not applicable to those points generated during model inference, e.g., box coordinates or votes  . To tackle this problem, we contribute a pipeline, named multi-modality transformation flow, to ensure multi-modality consistency to cope with rich set of augmentations.\nMulti-modality consistency can be maintained if and only if the augmentation can be reversed and replayed.\nThus, transformation flow records the parameters and orders of transformations used by each augmentation.\nThen in the multi-modality fusion process, any point in the LiDAR coordinates could find its corresponding image pixel coordinates by reversing the point cloud transformations and replaying the image transformation.\nIn this pipeline, any transformation can be applied as long as it is invertible;\nthus, one can now apply augmentations commonly found in single-modality detectors with equal effectiveness for multi-modality detectors (Fig. 1). Based on multi-modality transformation flow,\nwe further propose a new augmentation approach, multi-modality cut and paste (MoCa).\nState-of-the-art LiDAR-based detectors    benefit significantly from cut and paste augmentation .\nHowever, such an effective augmentation scheme is absent from multi-modality methods [ref]43 , which severely limits their performance.\nSingle-modality cut and paste methods do not need to consider occlusions and physical plausibility in other modalities.\nConsequently, they may construct scenes containing objects completely occluded in 2D images  or paste an object at implausible locations.\nThese cases hinder the learning of multi-modality fusion modules as it makes the point from one modality fusing features from different objects in another modality.\nMoCa constrains paste operations to avoid occlusion between objects in both the bird’s eye view (BEV) and the 2D imagery domain.\nTo further improve the detector’s generalizability, we use randomly selected intersection over foreground (IoF) to determine the occlusion in imagery domain.\nMoCa improves object detection performance by a large margin and it is readily applicable to many existing multi-modality detectors [ref]43  [ref]25 . The transformation flow, MoCa, together with some beneficial practices, improve the mAP of MVX-Net [ref]43, a strong and generic multi-modality detector, by 11.3% moderate mAP on KITTI dataset (Fig.1) and 5.8% mAP on nuScenes dataset.\nWithout using an ensemble of class-specialized detectors, the enhanced MVX-Net achieves new state-of-the-art results on nuScenes dataset [ref]1 and obtains competitive results on KITTI 3D benchmark .\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) devices.\nNonetheless, these single-modality LiDAR-based methods also have limitations: a typical LiDAR system can only perceive objects in a limited range [ref]1, and cannot distinguish semantic categories of similar structures, e.g., pedestrians and trees.
