      "content": "Paper Title: Label Shift Quantification with Robustness Guarantees via Distribution Feature Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe research area of quantification learning has a somewhat fragmented nature.\nQuantifying the target label distribution and learning a classifier are\nactually very closely related objectives. The most classical approach for the construction of efficient classifiers on the target domain is based on weighted empirical risk minimisation, which itself requires the estimation of the shift between the source and target distributions. Thus, while we are here interested in estimating the target proportions αi∗superscriptsubscript𝛼𝑖\\alpha_{i}^{*}, many related works are interested in estimating the weights wi=αi∗/βi∗subscript𝑤𝑖superscriptsubscript𝛼𝑖superscriptsubscript𝛽𝑖w_{i}=\\alpha_{i}^{*}/\\beta_{i}^{*}. Obtaining an estimator of those weights from an estimator of the target proportions αi∗superscriptsubscript𝛼𝑖\\alpha_{i}^{*} is straightforward: simply use the labels in the source data to form a direct estimate of the source proportions and then consider the ratio. Conversely, starting from the weights estimator, it is possible to obtain an estimate of the weights αi∗/βi∗superscriptsubscript𝛼𝑖superscriptsubscript𝛽𝑖\\alpha_{i}^{*}/\\beta_{i}^{*} by multiplying it by an estimate of the source proportions. For this reason, there have been two different literature threads that address closely related problems but apparently grew independently: the Quantification Learning literature   and the Label Shift literature . Most methods dealing with label shift are expressed as variants of the so-called Classify & Count (CC) technique proposed in the seminal works of Forman   . The idea is to fit a classifier on the source dataset, e.g. a random forest 0 , an SVM , or a Nearest-Neighbour , and to estimate the target class distribution using the distribution of predictions. To account for the misclassification that the underlying classifier suffers on the target set due to the label shift, Forman  proposed the Adjusted Classify & Count (ACC) method, a modification to the standard Classify & Count which simply adjusts the estimate after computing the quantifier. This approach is also popular in the label shift correction literature. Based on the same principle, more\nrecently the Black-Box Shift Estimation (BBSE) algorithm introduced by  used the confusion matrix of the classifier to adjust the predicted label distribution, while Azizzadenesheli et al.  proposed to regularise the re-weighting vector in BBSE in order to make the final estimated target distribution less sensitive to the quality of the estimated confusion matrix. Another technique, using an off-the-shelf classifier, is based on the maximum likelihood principle. The most popular version of this approach is probably the Maximum Likelihood Label Shift (MLLS) [ref]2 strategy which is widely used in the label shift correction community. This technique is actually a variation of the original work of Saerens et al. 8 that uses an Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm to efficiently correct for the shift in class proportions between source and target distributions given estimates from a predictive model, alternately updating the target class-prior and class-posterior probabilities from some initial estimates until convergence. In fact,  argues that only the choice of the calibration method differs between MLLS and BBSE and that both procedures actually solve the same optimisation objective, thus explaining that the empirical advantage of MLLS over BBSE is only due to coarse calibration of the latter. Another completely different approach consists in viewing quantification as a statistical mixture problem. Since both source and target covariates marginal distributions can be written as mixtures ℙ=∑i=1cβi∗​ℙiℙsuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑐superscriptsubscript𝛽𝑖subscriptℙ𝑖\\mathbb{P}=\\sum_{i=1}^{c}\\beta_{i}^{*}\\mathbb{P}_{i} and ℚ=∑i=1cαi∗​ℚiℚsuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑐superscriptsubscript𝛼𝑖subscriptℚ𝑖\\mathbb{Q}=\\sum_{i=1}^{c}\\alpha_{i}^{*}\\mathbb{Q}_{i} respectively. Under the label shift assumption, the conditional distribution of the covariates given the label is the same for both source and target data (ℙi=ℚisubscriptℙ𝑖subscriptℚ𝑖\\mathbb{P}_{i}=\\mathbb{Q}_{i}), and can be estimated using the empirical conditional distribution ℙ^i:=∑j/yj=iδxj​(⋅)/niassignsubscript^ℙ𝑖subscript𝑗subscript𝑦𝑗𝑖subscript𝛿subscript𝑥𝑗⋅subscript𝑛𝑖\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}_{i}:=\\sum_{j/y_{j}=i}\\delta_{x_{j}}(\\cdot)/n_{i} based on the labeled source sample. Thus, the marginal covariates distribution ℚℚ\\mathbb{Q} can be approximated by ∑i=1cαi∗​ℙ^isuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑐superscriptsubscript𝛼𝑖subscript^ℙ𝑖\\sum_{i=1}^{c}\\alpha_{i}^{*}\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}_{i}, and the goal of quantification can be seen as finding the mixture weights (αi)i=1csuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝛼𝑖𝑖1𝑐(\\alpha_{i})_{i=1}^{c} such that the mixture ∑i=1cαi​ℙ^isuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑐subscript𝛼𝑖subscript^ℙ𝑖\\sum_{i=1}^{c}\\alpha_{i}\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}_{i} resembles the most the empirical target covariates marginal distribution ℚ^:=∑j=1mδxj+n​(⋅)/massign^ℚsuperscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑚subscript𝛿subscript𝑥𝑗𝑛⋅𝑚\\hat{\\mathbb{Q}}:=\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\delta_{x_{j+n}}(\\cdot)/m based on the target dataset, with respect to some metric. Many different statistical divergences have been considered in the literature, such as the Hellinger distance , the Wasserstein distance , the Pearson divergence ,\nthe Energy distance [ref]26 or the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)  2. The last two distances operate in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and adapt to the label shift problem the Kernel Mean Matching (KMM) approach , that minimises the RKHS distance between the kernel mean embeddings of the distributions. The use of kernel methods enables here to operate in an implicit high-dimensional space without requiring computing the coordinates of the data in that space, but rather by simply computing the inner products between the images of all pairs of data in the space. However, the applicability of these methods on a larger scale still remains an important limitation due to the computation of the kernel matrix. Consequently, distribution matching has sometimes been performed on a low-dimensional function of the covariates instead of a high-dimensional kernel embedding. For instance, the Distribution y-Similarity framework (DyS)  exploits the histogram of a decision function obtained by a trained binary classifier and then minimises the Topsøe distance between the two histograms, while the HDx algorithm  uses the Hellinger distance between histograms of the Source and Target directly. The general formulation we will adopt in this paper is in line with this approach of minimising some distance in a feature space between feature mappings of the distributions.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Another technique, using an off-the-shelf classifier, is based on the maximum likelihood principle.
