      "content": "Paper Title: Nominal Tree Automata With Name Allocation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLetters from infinite alphabets generally serve as an\nabstraction of data values in formalisms for the specification and\nverification of structured data such as data words or data trees\n(e.g.¬†). They have variously been used to represent\ndata values in XML documents¬†, object\nidentities¬†, parameters of method\ncalls¬†, or nonces in cryptographic\nprotocols¬†. There are, by now, quite a number of\nautomata models for data languages, including register\nautomata¬†, data walking\nautomata¬†[ref]27, and data automata¬†. A\ntypical phenomenon in such models is that expressiveness increases\nstrictly with the power of control (ranging from deterministic to\nalternating models). In such models, the key reasoning problem of\ninclusion checking tends to be either undecidable or computationally\nvery hard unless stringent restrictions are imposed on either the\npower of control or on key parameters such as the number of\nregisters. For instance, inclusion checking of nondeterministic\nregister automata is undecidable unless one restricts either to\nunambiguous automata¬† [ref]7 or to automata\nwith at most two registers¬† (no complexity\nbound being given in the latter case); inclusion checking for\nalternating register automata is undecidable unless one restricts to only\none register, and even then fails to be primitive\nrecursive¬†; the inclusion problem of data walking\nautomata is decidable but at least as hard as Petri net\nreachability¬†, which by recent results\nis\nAckermann-complete¬†[ref]25  ;\nnon-emptiness of data automata¬† is decidable but,\nagain, at least as hard as Petri net reachability; and emptiness of\nvariable automata¬† is undecidable unless one\nrestricts to the (less expressive) deterministic fragment. Register-based automata models are often essentially equivalent to\nautomata models in nominal sets¬†1; for instance, register\nautomata with nondeterministic reassignment¬†\nare equivalent to nondeterministic orbit-finite\nautomata¬†. In the nominal setting, one way to\nameliorate the mentioned degree of computational hardness while\nretaining a reasonable level of expressiveness is provided by the\nparadigm of explicit name allocation in nominal automata, which\nfirst appeared in regular nondeterministic nominal automata\n(RNNA)¬†3 and has subsequently been used in B√ºchi\nRNNA¬†9 and in a linear-time nominal\nŒºùúá\\mu-calculus¬†. In this paradigm, notions of\nfreshness are based on Œ±ùõº\\alpha-equivalence, i.e.¬†renaming of bound\nnames as in ŒªùúÜ\\lambda-calculus, which blocks renaming of bound names\ninto names that have free occurrences later in the word; in terms of\nthe equivalent register-based setting, this amounts to a lossiness\ncondition saying that at every point, register contents may\nnondeterministically be erased (thus freeing the register). At the\nsame time, name-allocating models impose finite branching. Inclusion\nchecking in these models is typically elementary, and in fact has low\nparametrized complexities with the parameter being the degree,\nwhich in the register-based setting corresponds to the number of\nregisters. Our present contribution is a nominal non-deterministic top-down tree\nautomaton model that follows the name allocation paradigm. As our main\nresult, we show that our model of regular nominal tree automata\n(RNTA) admits inclusion checking in doubly exponential time, more\nprecisely in parametrized singly exponential time with the degree as\nthe parameter (recall that the problem is already ExpTime-complete\nfor finite-alphabet non-deterministic top-down tree automata). We thus\nobtain an efficiently decidable formalism for the specification data\nwords that admits full non-determinism and unboundedly many registers. Proofs omitted in the main body of the paper can be found in the\nappendix. We have already mentioned work on\nregister word automata. Kaminski and Tan¬†\nintroduce top-down and bottom-up register tree automata with or\nwithout non-deterministic reassignment; computational hardness of\ninclusion and universality is inherited from register word automata\n(while membership and emptiness are decidable in elementary complexity\nNP and ExpTime,\nrespectively¬†5). Without non-deterministic\nreassignment, the top-down model and the bottom-up model have\nincomparable expressiveness. Our model of regular nominal tree\nautomata (RNTA) relates, along the usual\ncorrespondence¬†, to non-deterministic top-down\nregister tree automata without non-deterministic reassignment. Van\nHeerdt et al.¬†0 treat bottom-up nominal tree automata\nwith name allocation in a general algebraic setting, describing\nminimization and determinization constructions (without considering\ninclusion checking; determinization produces orbit-infinite\nautomata). Since the finite-branching condition for the bottom-up\nvariant differs from top-down finite branching as imposed in RNTAs, we\nexpect similar incomparability as in the register-based setting; we\nleave the investigation of this point to future work. A register\nautomata model for data trees with a different navigation pattern has\nbeen introduced by Jurdzi≈Ñski and\nLaziƒá¬†  and extended by\nFigueira¬†; in this model, the automaton moves\ndownwards or rightwards on the tree instead of passing copies of\nitself to child nodes. The emptiness problem of the alternating model\nis decidable but not primitive recursive when the number of registers\nis restricted to¬†111; expressiveness is incomparable to Kaminski and\nTan‚Äôs model¬†. One formalism for data trees\nthat does allow inclusion checking in elementary complexity is the\nlogic F‚ÄãO2‚Äã(+1,‚àº)ùêπsuperscriptùëÇ21similar-toFO^{2}(+1,\\sim)¬†, whose satisfiablity\nproblem is in 3NexpTime. Register tree automata have been\nextended to cover an ordering on the data\nvalues¬†6 7.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: parameters of method\ncalls¬†, or nonces in cryptographic\nprotocols¬†.
