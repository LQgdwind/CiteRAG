      "content": "Paper Title: Securing Recommender System via Cooperative Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany issues about security and privacy have been studied in recommender systems. These researches have revealed vulnerabilities in recommender systems  , prompting the development of a dedicated toolkit for assessing their robustness [ref]22.\nEarlier attacks injected malicious profiles manually generated with little knowledge about the recommender system,\nso it could not achieve satisfactory attack performance, e.g., random\nattack and average attack .\nTo overcome this limitation, recent attacks have been optimized for specific classes of RSs, such as matrix-factorization-based[ref]6, neighborhood-based, graph-based[ref]17, deep-learning-based, and visual-awareness-based RSs.\nThe training of these model-based recommendation algorithms usually\nused backpropagation  , so perturbations were added along\nthe gradient direction to perform the attack  [ref]17 [ref]6 . For example, Nguyen et al. studied poisoning attacks on GNN-based recommenders and proposed a solution involving surrogating a recommendation model and generating fake users and user-item interactions while preserving correlations. Inspired\nby the GAN’s application  in the recommendation, some works  used GAN to generate real-like fake ratings to bypass the detection. To address traditional GAN’s inability to evaluate attacking damage, Wu et al.  drew inspiration from TripleGAN  and introduced an attack module that conducts triple adversarial learning to generate malicious users. Advancements in deep learning have led Huang et al.  to propose a poison attack on DL-based RSs. The attack involves injecting fake users with carefully crafted ratings into the targeted model and can be defined as an optimization problem that can be efficiently resolved by incorporating heuristic rules. The attack model remains practical even when attackers have limited access to only a small portion of user-item interactions. With\nthe development of optimization algorithms, many works focused on attacking specific types of recommender systems and turned attacks into optimization problems of deciding appropriate rating scores for users  [ref]6  [ref]17 . Moreover, some works treated the items’ ratings as actions and used reinforcement learning to generate real-like fake ratings. Such optimization-based methods have strong attack performance, so defense is needed to mitigate the harm of attack.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: have been studied in recommender systems. These researches have revealed vulnerabilities in recommender systems  , prompting the development of a dedicated toolkit for assessing their robustness [ref]22.\nEarlier attacks injected malicious profiles manually generated with little knowledge about the recommender system,\nso it could not achieve satisfactory attack performance, e.g.,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
