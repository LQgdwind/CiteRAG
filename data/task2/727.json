      "content": "Paper Title: The Argument against Quantum Computers, the Quantum Laws of Nature, and Google’s Supremacy Claims Laws, Rigidity and Dynamics, Proceedings of the ICA workshops 2018 & 2019 Singapore and Birmingham\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe first assertion in my argument is related to a mathematical theory of\nnoise stability and noise sensitivity that goes back to\nBenjamini, Kalai, and Schramm (1999)  (and can be traced back to ).\nIn my lecture in Singapore\nI described this theory in the context of voting methods. How likely is\nit that the outcome of an election will be\nreversed because of noise in counting the votes? Let ΩnsubscriptΩ𝑛\\Omega_{n} be the set of 0-1 vectors of length n𝑛n.\nWe start with a real function f​(x1,x2,…,xn)𝑓subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2…subscript𝑥𝑛f(x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{n}), and for a real\nnumber t𝑡t, we define the noise version of f𝑓f as Here y=(y1,y2,…,yn)𝑦subscript𝑦1subscript𝑦2…subscript𝑦𝑛y=(y_{1},y_{2},\\dots,y_{n}) is also a 0-1 vector and yi=1subscript𝑦𝑖1y_{i}=1 indicates “error in the i𝑖ith coordinate.”\nThe sum x+y𝑥𝑦x+y should be considered as a\nsum modulo 2: xi+0=xisubscript𝑥𝑖0subscript𝑥𝑖x_{i}+0=x_{i} and xi+1=1−xisubscript𝑥𝑖11subscript𝑥𝑖x_{i}+1=1-x_{i}, and |y|=x1+x2+⋯+xn𝑦subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2⋯subscript𝑥𝑛|y|=x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{n}. It turns out () that the behavior of noise for functions on ΩnsubscriptΩ𝑛\\Omega_{n} is closely related to\nthe Fourier–Walsh expansion of the function. Here is a quick description.\nRecall that for S⊂[n]={1,2,…,n}𝑆delimited-[]𝑛12…𝑛S\\subset[n]=\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\},\nthe Walsh function WSsubscript𝑊𝑆W_{S} is defined\nas If the Fourier–Walsh expansion of f𝑓f is then If the value of f𝑓f is always 0 and 1 we call f𝑓f a Boolean function, then\nwe can regard f𝑓f as a voting rule\nfor a two-candidate election. A deep finding from  is that for a wide class of voting rules,\nonly those voting rules that are close enough to the “majority” voting\nrule (or a weighted version of the majority rule)\nare noise-stable. We note that the majority voting rule is related to the very basic methods for\nachieving robust classical information and computation. We can now describe\nthe “very low-level” computational complexity class LDP\nof probability distributions described by NISQ systems. The class LDP consists of\nprobability distributions that\ncan be approximated by polynomials of bounded degree.\nIndeed, when t>0𝑡0t>0 is fixed and we apply the noise Ntsubscript𝑁𝑡N_{t} (defined by Equation (2))\nto an arbitrary probability distribution D𝐷D, the resulting distribution Nt​(D)subscript𝑁𝑡𝐷N_{t}(D) can be\nwell approximated by polynomials of bounded degree (roughly 1/t1𝑡1/t). (This easily follows\nfrom Equation (5).)\nDistributions that can be (approximately) described by bounded-degree polynomials\ncan also be approximately described by bounded-depth (classical) circuits. (Bounded depth circuits\ndefine a well-known low-level complexity class 𝐀𝐂𝟎superscript𝐀𝐂0{\\bf AC^{0}}.) Approximate sampling for LDP-distributions\nis also efficiently learnable, which also describes a low level complexity class for approximate sampling. (See Figure\n1). When D𝐷D is a probability distribution proposed for “quantum advantage” (or arising from\nquantum error-correcting codes),\nthen, even when the level of noise is subconstant but (well) above 1/n1𝑛1/n, the\ncorrelation between the two distributions D𝐷D and Nt​(D)subscript𝑁𝑡𝐷N_{t}(D) tends to zero. This suggests\nthat for realistic forms of noise the noisy probability distribution will strongly\ndepend on fine parameters of the noise itself, leading to a “chaotic” behavior. We note that the analysis of noise sensitivity of NISQ systems was initially carried out\non another model called “boson sampling” in .\nFor further discussion of boson sampling see [ref]1    , and Section 9.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: behavior. We note that the analysis of noise sensitivity of NISQ systems was initially carried out\non another model called “boson sampling” in .\nFor further discussion of boson sampling see [ref]1    , and Section 9.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
