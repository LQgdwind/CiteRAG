      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Feature Learning with Emergent Data-Driven Prototypicality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNot all instances are created equal. Some instances are more representative of the class and some instances are outliers or anomalies. Representative examples can be viewed as prototypes and used for interpretable machine learning , curriculum learning , and learning better decision boundaries [ref]5. With prototypical examples, we can also conduct classification with few or even one example 1. Given an image dataset, thus it is desirable to organize the examples based on prototypicality. If the features of the images are given, it is relatively easy to find the prototypes by examining the density peaks of the feature distribution. If the features are not given, discovering prototypical examples without supervision is difficult: There is no universal definition or simple metric to assess the prototypicality of the examples. A naive method to address this problem is to examine the gradient magnitude [ref]5. However, this approach is shown to have a high variance which is resulted from different training setups [ref]5. Some methods address this problem from the perspective of adversarial robustness 9 [ref]5: prototypical examples should be more adversarially robust. However, the selection of the prototypical examples highly depends on the adversarial method and the metric used in the adversarial attack. Several other methods exist for this problem but they are either based on heuristics or lack a proper justification [ref]5. Naturally, given a feature space, prototypical examples can be identified as density peaks. However, prototypicality undergoes changes as the feature space undergoes changes. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised feature learning algorithm, called HACK, for learning features that reflect prototypicality.\nDifferent from existing unsupervised learning methods, HACK naturally leverages the geometry of hyperbolic space for unsupervised learning. Hyperbolic space is non-Euclidean space with constant non-negative curvature . Different from Euclidean space, hyperbolic space can represent hierarchical relations with low distortion. Poincaré ball model is one of the most commonly used models for hyperbolic space 5. One notable property of Poincaré ball model is that the distance to the origin grows exponentially as we move towards the boundary. Thus, the points located in the center of the ball are close to all the other points while the points located close to the boundary are infinitely far away from other points. With unsupervised learning in hyperbolic space, HACK can learn features which capture both visual similarity and prototypicality (Figure 1). HACK optimizes the organization of the dataset by assigning the images to a set of uniformly distributed particles in hyperbolic space. The assignment is done by minimizing the total hyperbolic distance between the features and the particles via the Hungarian algorithm. The prototypicality arises naturally based on the distance of the example to the others. Prototypical examples tend to locate in the center of the Poincaré ball and atypical examples tend to locate close to the boundary. Hyperbolic space readily facilitates such an organization due to the property of the hyperbolic distance. Our paper makes the following contributions. We propose the first unsupervised feature learning method to learn features which capture both visual similarity and prototypicality. The positions of the features reflect prototypicality of the examples. The proposed method HACK assigns images to particles that are uniformly packed in hyperbolic space. HACK fully exploits the property of hyperbolic space and prototypicality arises naturally. We ground the concept of prototypicality based on congealing which conforms to human visual perception. The congealed examples can be used to replace the original examples for constructing datasets with known prototypicality. We validate the effectiveness of the method by using synthetic data with natural and congealed images. We further apply the proposed method to commonly used image datasets to reveal prototypicality. The discovered prototypical and atypical examples are shown to reduce sample complexity and increase the robustness of the model.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: instances are outliers or anomalies.
