      "content": "Paper Title: FFConv: Fast Factorized Convolutional Neural Network Inference on Encrypted Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHomomorphic Encryption (HE)    is one of the promising cryptographic systems that enable secure Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) inference for privacy-preserving applications in clouds while at the cost of high inference latency. At the client, the plaintext data is encrypted in the form of ciphertext, then transmitted to the cloud server. At the cloud, CNN inference is evaluated homomorphically on the ciphertexts to generate an encrypted prediction. The encrypted prediction is returned to the client for decryption. Since the cloud cannot encrypt or decrypt the data, the data privacy is protected. Despite the high level of security, the HE-enabled Convolutional Neural Network (HECNN) inference is prohibitively slow, mainly due to a large number of ciphertexts generated and the expensive Homomorphic Multiply-Accumulate (HMA) operations on the ciphertexts. For instance, the inference latency of a shallow CNN (1 convolution layer and 2 fully-connected layers) on one encrypted 28x28 MNIST image  is more than 200 seconds on multi-core CPUs . Modern HE cryptographic systems    used packed encryption to accelerate the HECNN inference, in which the ciphertext structure is configured as a vector of slots, and each slot encrypts a different message (e.g., a pixel). Therefore, packing can significantly reduce the number of ciphertexts required to encrypt a given amount of data messages. In addition, packing also enables massive parallel execution of the HMA operations between ciphertexts, as per the Single-Instruction Multiple-Data (SIMD) execution model [ref]8. When multiplying (resp. adding) two packed ciphertexts, it is equivalent to concurrent slot-wise multiplications (resp. additions) of the underlying vectors of the two ciphertexts. HE ciphertext packing has been employed in multiple previous works [ref]9 0 1 to accelerate the CNN computation and reduce resource consumption with encrypted data. In particular, LoLa 2 introduced several ciphertext packing schemes, which reduced the inference latency to around 2 seconds for the shallow CNN inference on encrypted MNIST . Despite the faster HECNN inference, ciphertext packing schemes introduce expensive overhead, which prolong the inference latency of HECNN for deeper and wider CNN architectures. As summarized in LoLa 2, Dense Packing (DensePack) and Convolution Packing (ConvPack) are the two major packed representations to parallelize the HMA operations. DensePack packs 3D input tensor into a ciphertext. To execute a HMA, the Rotation operation is required to rotate and align the slots inside the ciphertext before each accumulation operation (see Fig. 1 (b)). On the other side, by converting convolution operation to 2D matrix multiplication using the image-to-column (Im2Col) technique (see Fig. 3 (top)), ConvPack packs each column of the 2D input matrix into a ciphertext, followed by the HMA operations performed over the ciphertexts without the need of any rotation operations (see Fig. 2 (a)). Nevertheless, the homomorphic Im2Col operation requires a considerable number of rotation operations to reorganize the order of the slots in the input (or output) ciphertexts for the subsequent packing scheme. Compared to HMA operations, the rotations are 10x more expensive 3. For instance, LoLa 2 reported a 3-layer CNN inference (2 convolution layers and 1 fully-connected layer) on one encrypted 32x32x3 CIFAR-10 image 4 takes over 700 seconds, in which the rotations account for over 90% of the time. Prior work attempted to further accelerate the HECNN inference by reducing the rotation overhead. Falcon  3 replaced the convolution in spatial domain with element-wise products in frequency domain, which in turn reduced the number of rotation operations. As a result, Falcon reported 7x faster inference speed than LoLa for the 3-layer CNN inference on encrypted CIFAR-10. However, Falcon has several limitations. First, similar to LoLa, Falcon used ConvPack for the first convolution layer and DensePack for the intermediate convolution layers. There are no studies to show whether the other packing patterns (e.g. DensePack followed by ConvPack) can be integrated with CNN architectures more efficiently. Second, the frequency-domain convolution in Falcon is only applicable for reducing the rotation overhead in DensePack. How to reduce the rotation overhead introduced by homomorphic Im2Col in ConvPack remains unexplored. Third, Falcon introduced additional special blocks Homomorphic Discrete Fourier Transform (HDFT) and Homomorphic Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (HIDFT) into HECNN, leading to more homomorphic multiplication operations. In this paper, we propose a low-rank factorized convolution called FFConv dedicated to efficient ciphertext packing for fast inference on encrypted data.\nOur contributions are three-fold. First, to our knowledge, this is the first work shows that the rotation overhead introduced by the homomorphic Im2Col operation can be significantly reduced under certain conditions. As shown in Table III, for a convolution layer with kernel size equals 1 (d=1𝑑1d=1), the homomorphic Im2Col operation attached to this layer has significantly fewer number of rotations or even zero rotations, depending on the type of packing scheme of the preceding convolution layer. To take advantage of this property, one should design network architecture with 1×1111\\times 1 convolution layers for efficient integration with ConvPack representations, which in turn speed up the inference on encrypted data. Second, we propose FFConv to approximate a d×d𝑑𝑑d\\times d convolution layer with low-rank factorized convolutions, in which a d×d𝑑𝑑d\\times d low-rank convolution with fewer channels is followed by a 1×1111\\times 1 convolution to restore the channels. Accordingly, we introduce FFConv packing which packs the factorized convolutions with either DensePack or ConvPack. The d×d𝑑𝑑d\\times d low-rank convolution with DensePack leads to significantly reduced rotation operations, while the 1×1111\\times 1 convolution with ConvPack introduces little or zero rotation overhead for homomorphic Im2Col. To the best of our knowledge, FFConv is the first work that is able to reduce the rotation overhead incurred by DensePack and ConvPack simultaneously, without introducing additional special blocks into the HECNN inference pipeline. Lastly, compared to 8 state-of-the-art HECNNs including the most recent works LoLa and Falcon, FFConv enables efficient ciphertext packing and reduces the inference latency by up to 88% (vs. LoLa) and 21% (vs. Falcon), with comparable accuracy on MNIST and CIFAR-10. In addition, our method introduces significantly less noise budget than the best performing baseline Falcon. We also performed ablation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed packing pattern (versus other patterns) and the factorization method (versus training from scratch and filter pruning).\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: amount of data messages.
