      "content": "Paper Title: FNAS: Uncertainty-Aware Fast Neural Architecture Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe architecture of a convolutional neural network (CNN) is crucial for many deep learning tasks such as image classification [ref]31 and object detection . The widespread use of neural architecture search (NAS) methods such as differentiable, one-shot,\nevolutional, and RL-based approaches have effectively dealt with architecture design problems.\nDespite having high performance due to its sampling-based mechanism [ref]30  [ref]31, RL-based NAS tends to require unbearable computing resources which discourages the research community from exploring it further. The main obstacles to the propagation of RL-based NAS algorithm come from the following two aspects: a) it’s necessary to sample a large number of architectures from the search space to ensure the convergence of the RL agent, b) the inevitable training and evaluation cost of these  architecture samples on proxy tasks. For example, the seminal RL-based NAS 0 approach requires 12,800 generations of architectures. The state-of-the-art MNAS [ref]30 and MobileNet-V3  require 8000 or more generations to  find the optimal architecture.\nCoupled with ∼similar-to\\sim5 epochs training for each generation, the whole search process costs nearly 64 TPUv2 devices for 96 hours or 20,000 GPU hours on V100 for just one single searching process. With no access to reduce the unbearable computational cost, RL-based NAS is hard to make more widespread influence than differential  , and one-shot based   methods. On the contrary, the high efficiency of one-shot NAS family brings it continuous research attention. Instead of sampling a huge number of sub-networks, one-shot NAS assembles them into a single super-network. The parameters are shared between different sub-networks during the training of the super-network. In this way, the training process is condensed from training thousands of sub-networks into training a super-network. However, this  weight sharing strategy may  cause problems  of inaccurate performance estimation of sub-networks. For example, two sub-networks may propagate conflicting gradients to their shared components,  which may converge to favor one of the sub-networks and repel the other  one randomly. This conflicting phenomenon may result in instability of the search process and inferior final architectures, compared with RL-based methods. In this work, we  aim at combining advantages of both RL-based methods and one-shot methods.\nThe proposed method is based on two  important key observations:\nFirst, the optimal architectures for different tasks have  certain common architecture knowledge (similar sub-architectures in different search processes’ optimal architectures).\nSecond, the parameter knowledge (weights at samples’ training checkpoints) can also be transferred across different searching settings and even tasks. Based on the two observations, to transfer architecture knowledge, we develop Uncertainty-Aware Critic (UAC) to learn the architecture-performance joint distribution from previous search processes in an unbiased manner, utilizing the transferability of the architecture knowledge, which reduces the needed samples in RL optimization process by 50%.\nFor the transferable parameter knowledge, we propose an Architecture Knowledge Pool (AKP) to restore the block-level [ref]30 parameters and fairly share them as new sample architectures’ initialization, which speed up each sample’s convergence for ∼similar-to\\sim2 times.\nFinally, we also develop an Architecture Experience Buffer (AEB) with an off-policy correctness factor to store the previously trained models for reusing in RL optimization, with half of the search time saved. Under the same environment as MNAS [ref]30 with MobileNet-v3 , FNAS speeds up the search process by 10×\\times and the searched architecture performs even better. To summarize, our main contributions are as follows: We propose FNAS, which introduces three acceleration modules, uncertainty-aware critic, architecture knowledge pool, and architecture experience buffer, to speed up reinforcement-learning-based neural architecture search by ∼similar-to\\sim10×\\times. We show that the knowledge of neural architecture search processes can be transferred, which is utilized to improve sample efficiency of reinforcement learning agent process and training efficiency of each sampled architecture. We demonstrate new state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification, face recognition, and COCO object detection with comparable computational constraints.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: The architecture of a convolutional neural network (CNN) is crucial for many deep learning tasks such as image classification [ref]31 and object detection .
