Our work focuses on one of the outcomes of the function approximation error, namely, the underestimation bias on the action value estimates. Several approaches reduce the effects of overestimation bias resulting from the function approximation and policy optimization in deep Q-learning. One of the successor works to the deep Q-learning [ref]1, Double Q-learning , proposed by  and , employs two independent action value estimators to obtain unbiased estimates of Q-values.  modified the Double Q-learning  by utilizing multiple value estimators. This approach, Maxmin Q-learning , considers randomly selected value estimates of multiple critics, and a minimum of which is used in learning the Q-value target. Furthermore, methods that employ multi-step returns offer a trade-off between the variance build-up and accumulated estimation bias. Such methods are proven to be effective through distributed methods [ref]22, [ref]23, approximate lower and upper bounds , and importance sampling , . Another trade-off in these approaches is using a longer horizon rather than finding a direct solution to the accumulated error. , on the other hand, offers a solution to diminish the discount factor for reducing the contribution of each erroneous estimate. The concern with the direct solution to the accumulated approximation error has been overcome by  for actor-critic settings. Their study shows the existence of overestimation bias and accumulated variance induced by the deep function approximation of Q-values. An extension of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm , Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient  which our method is built on, introduces a direct solution to the problems of the function approximation error through the utilization of two critics, delayed actor updates and target policy smoothing regularization. TD3  is shown to produce state-of-the-art results by a large margin with a sufficient number of training iterations. Although the improvements introduced by  can tame the accumulated error, the usage of two critics induces an underestimation bias on Q-value estimates. To overcome the underestimation error,  approaches the problem with a modification on the update rule for the critics in the TD3 . In their approach, the target for the temporal difference learning  is computed through the weighted linear combination of the minimum and average of the two critics, Weighted Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (WD3) .  extends the WD3  by increasing the number of Q-networks to three. Both studies have shown that the weighted linear combinations of Q-networks can obtain more accurate action value estimates and higher evaluation returns.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Several approaches reduce the effects of overestimation bias resulting from the function approximation and policy optimization in deep Q-learning.
