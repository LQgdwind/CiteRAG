Many studies [ref]1 [ref]2    tried to explain an AI model at the concept level. For example, [ref]1 [ref]2 examined how each convolutional filter related to its encoded fuzzy concept.\n grouped image segments with similar activations as examples of the same concept.\n tried to find a certain feature direction in the intermediate layer corresponding to a specific manually-defined concept.\nThese methods all tried to explain the feature representation of DNNs as the encoding of different concepts with clear meanings.\nThus, if many features in a DNN cannot be explained as symbolic concepts, then any attempt to explain DNNs based on concepts will lose its support in mathematics. ∙∙\\bullet A clear definition of concepts and the proof of the emergence of symbolic concepts may enable us to use the concepts encoded by an AI model to analyze the generalization and the robustness of the model, which serves as a new perspective for explaining AI models. In fact, game-theoretic interactions have been used to explain the overfitting [ref]35, adversarial robustness  and adversarial transferability , although these studies used multi-order interactions [ref]35 for analysis222Harsanyi interactions are proved to be compositional interaction elements of the multi-order interaction, other than the Harsanyi interaction. ∙∙\\bullet Proving the emergence of symbolic concepts provides an alternative methodology of deep learning beyond the end-to-end training, i.e., the communicative learning. In contrast to end-to-end learning from the data, in communicative learning, people may directly communicate with the middle-level concepts encoded by the DNN, so as to examine and fix the representation flaws of the DNN. Communicative learning may include but is not limited to (1) the extraction and visualization of symbolic concepts, (2) the alignment of such implicitly encoded concepts and the explicitly annotated human knowledge, (3) the diagnosis of representation flaws of a DNN, (4) the discovery of new concepts from DNNs to enrich human knowledge, and (5) interactively fixing/debugging incorrect concepts in a DNN.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: encoded by an AI model is of significant value in both theory and practice: ∙∙\\bullet The emergence of symbolic concepts is a theoretic foundation of the field of explainable AI.
