      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Domain Invariant Representations in Goal-conditioned Block MDPs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in solving high-dimensional Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) problems, e.g., Alpha Zero  for Go, DQN [ref]2 for Atari games and SAC [ref]3 for locomotion control. However, current RL algorithms requires massive amounts of trial and error to learn  [ref]2 [ref]3. They also tend to overfit to specific environments and often fail to generalize beyond the environment they were trained on . Unfortunately, this characteristic limits the applicability of RL algorithms for many real world applications. Deployed RL agents, e.g. robots in the field, will often face environment changes in their input such as different backgrounds, lighting conditions or object shapes [ref]5. Many of these changes are often spurious and unrelated to the underlying task, e.g. control. However, RL agents trained without experiencing these changes are sensitive to the changes and often perform poorly in practice [ref]5  . In our work, we seek to tackle changing, diverse problems with goal-conditioned RL agents. Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning is a popular research topic as its formulation and method is practical for many robot learning problems  . In goal-conditioned MDPs, the agent has to achieve a desired goal state gùëîg which is sampled from a prior distribution. The agent should be able to achieve not only the training goals but also new test-time goals. Moreover, in practice, goal-conditioned RL agents often receive high-dimensional inputs for both observations and goals 0 1. Thus, it is important to ensure that the behaviour of goal-conditioned RL agents is invariant to any irrelevant environmental changes in the input at test time.\nPrevious work  tries to address these problems via model bisimulation metric 2.\nThese methods aim to acquire a minimal representation which is invariant to irrelevant environment factors. However, as goal-conditioned MDPs are a family of MDPs indexed by the goals, it is inefficient for these methods to acquire the model bisimulation representation for every possible goal, especially in high-dimensional continuous goal spaces (such as images). In our work, we instead choose to optimize a surrogate objective to learn the invariant policy. Our main contributions are: We formulate the Goal-conditioned Block MDPs (GBMDPs) to study domain generalization in the goal-conditioned reinforcement learning setting (Section 2), and propose a general theory characterizing how well a policy generalizes to unseen environments (Section 3.1). We propose a theoretically-motivated algorithm based on optimizing a surrogate objective, perfect alignment, with aligned data (Section 3.2). We then describe a practical implementation based on Skew-Fit 3 to achieve the objective (Section 3.3). Empirically, our experiments for a sawyer arm robot simulation with visual observations and goals demonstrates that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to data augmentation and bisimulation baselines at generalizing to unseen test environments in goal-conditioned tasks (Section 4).\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in solving high-dimensional Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) problems, e.g., Alpha Zero  for Go, DQN [ref]2 for Atari games and SAC [ref]3 for locomotion control.
