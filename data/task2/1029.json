      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we take a significant step towards addressing these questions.\nOur main result is the first unconditional lower bound on the communication complexity of distributed optimisation in the setting discussed above, showing that it is impossible to obtain a significant improvement in communication cost even if only one node (the “coordinator”) learns the final output.\nSpecifically, even if the input functions fisubscript𝑓𝑖f_{i} at the nodes are promised to be quadratic functions x↦β0​∥x−x∗∥22maps-to𝑥subscript𝛽0subscriptsuperscriptdelimited-∥∥𝑥superscript𝑥22x\\mapsto\\beta_{0}\\lVert x-x^{*}\\rVert^{2}_{2} for some constant β0>0subscript𝛽00\\beta_{0}>0, then any deterministic or randomised algorithm where at least one node learns a solution to (1) requires for β=β0​N𝛽subscript𝛽0𝑁\\beta=\\beta_{0}N, as long as parameters satisfy β​d/N2​ε=Ω​(1)𝛽𝑑superscript𝑁2𝜀Ω1\\beta d/N^{2}\\varepsilon=\\Omega(1). We emphasise that the lower bound requires no assumptions on the structure of the algorithm or amount of local computation. We also note that in most practical settings, the parameter dependency requirement is satisfied, as the number of parameters d𝑑d is significantly larger than the number of machines N𝑁N multiplied by the error tolerance ε𝜀\\varepsilon – moreover, a non-trivial dependence between β𝛽\\beta, d𝑑d, N𝑁N and ε𝜀\\varepsilon is required for the lower bound to hold. We discuss this in detail below. Our results start from the classic idea of linking communication complexity with the number of quadratic functions with distinct minima in the domain . To extend this approach to randomised (stochastic) algorithms and to the multi-node case N>2𝑁2N>2, we build new connections to results and techniques from communication complexity . Such connections have not to our knowledge been explored in the context of (real-valued) optimisation tasks.\nOur work thus provides a template and a basic toolkit for applying communication complexity results to distributed optimisation.\nAs further applications, we improve the main lower bound to Ω​(N​d​log⁡(β​d/ε))Ω𝑁𝑑𝛽𝑑𝜀\\Omega(Nd\\log(\\beta d/\\varepsilon)) for the deterministic case if some node is required to output both the approximate minimiser z𝑧z and the value of the sum ∑i=1Nfi​(z)superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑁subscript𝑓𝑖𝑧\\sum_{i=1}^{N}f_{i}(z), as well as prove stronger lower bounds in the more challenging non-convex case (see Section 5 and Appendix A.) To complement this lower bound, we show that for strongly convex and strongly smooth functions, distributed optimisation can be done using deterministic quantised gradient descent with where ∑i=1Nfisuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑁subscript𝑓𝑖\\sum_{i=1}^{N}f_{i} is α𝛼\\alpha-strongly convex and β𝛽\\beta-strongly smooth, and κ=β/α𝜅𝛽𝛼\\kappa=\\beta/\\alpha is the condition number. This is, to our knowledge, the first tight upper bound for communication cost of quantised gradient descent on quadratic functions, as well as the first upper bound that does not require all-to-all broadcast. In particular, for constant condition number κ𝜅\\kappa, this matches our main lower bound when d≫Nmuch-greater-than𝑑𝑁d\\gg N, e.g. d=Ω​(N2+δ)𝑑Ωsuperscript𝑁2𝛿d=\\Omega(N^{2+\\delta}) for constant δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0. Our algorithm builds on prior quantised gradient descent implementations  [ref]2, however, to achieve a tight bound, we need to (a) ensure that our gradient quantisation is sufficiently parsimonious, using O​(d​log⁡κ)𝑂𝑑𝜅O(d\\log\\kappa) bits per gradient, and (b) avoid all-to-all exchange of gradients. For (a), we specialise a recent lattice-based quantisation scheme which allows arbitrary centring of iterates , and for (b), we use two-stage quantisation approach, where the nodes first send their quantised gradients to the coordinator, and the coordinator then broadcasts the carefully quantised sum back to nodes. In Appendix B, we further show that this running time can be improved using randomisation when β​d/N​ε𝛽𝑑𝑁𝜀\\beta d/N\\varepsilon is small, using a simple sub-sampling approach.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: bound when d≫Nmuch-greater-than𝑑𝑁d\\gg N, e.g. d=Ω​(N2+δ)𝑑Ωsuperscript𝑁2𝛿d=\\Omega(N^{2+\\delta}) for constant δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0.
