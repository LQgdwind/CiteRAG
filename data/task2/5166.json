      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Label Continual Learning using Augmented Graph Convolutional Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMACHINE learning approaches have been reported to exhibit human-level performance on some tasks, such as Atari games  or object recognition [ref]2.\nHowever, they always assume that no novel knowledge will be input into models, which is impractical in the real world.\nTo meet the scenario, continual learning develops intelligent systems that can continuously learn new tasks from sequential datasets while preserving learned knowledge of old tasks .\nRecently, class-incremental continual learning  builds an adaptively evolvable classifier for the seen classes at any time, where the learner has no access to the task-ID at inference time  just like the real-life applications. Compared to traditional continual learning, a class-incremental model has to distinguish between all seen classes from all tasks. Therefore is more challenging. \nFor privacy and storage reasons, the training data for old tasks is unavailable when new tasks arrive.\nAs the model incrementally learns new knowledge, old knowledge is overwritten and gets a drop in performance, known as catastrophic forgetting [ref]6. Thus, the major challenge of MLCL is to learn new tasks without catastrophically forgetting previous tasks over time. Due to many researchers’ efforts, many methods for class-incremental continual learning have been proposed.\nThe rehearsal-based methods    0 1 stores samples from raw datasets or generates pseudo-samples with a generative model 2 3, these samples are replayed while learning a new task to prevent forgetting.\nThe regularization-based methods 4 5 [ref]6 6 7 have an additional regularization term introduced in the loss function, consolidating previous knowledge when learning on new tasks.\nAnd the parameter isolation methods 8 9  dedicates different model parameters to each task to alleviate any possible forgetting. Moreover, some recent transformer-based methods     have also achieved good performance. However, most existing methods for class-incremental continual learning only consider the input images are single-labelled, and we call them Single-Label Continual Learning (SLCL).\nSLCL is limited in practical applications such as movie categorization and scene classification, where multi-label data is widely used.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, an image contains multiple labels, including “sky”, “grass”, “person” and “dog”, etc., which shows the multi-label space is much larger than the single-label space via label combination.\nBecause of the co-occurrence of multiple labels, the label space of the multi-label dataset is much larger than that of the single-label one.\nIn the recent, using a neural network to tackle Multi-Label (ML) image classification problems has achieved impressive results  , which consider constructing label relationships to improve the classification by using recurrent neural network   and graph convolutional network  0 1. This paper puts the multi-task classification into an incremental scenario, i.e., class-incremental classification, and studies how to sequentially learn new classes for Multi-label Continual Learning (MLCL).\nThe inference process of MLCL is in Fig. 1.\nGiven testing images, the model can incrementally recognize multiple labels as new classes are learned continuously.\nBecause of the unavailability of data with future and past classes in continual learning, the partial label problem poses a significant challenge in building multi-label relationships and reducing catastrophic forgetting in MLCL than SLCL.\nThe partial label problem means that each task in MLCL cannot be trained independently since the label spaces for different tasks are overlapped.\nFor example, as shown in Fig. 1, the label “sky” is present in all three tasks. It is one of the overlapped labels for three tasks.\nFor task 111, “sky” is the future latent label, and for task 333, ”sky” is the past latent label. If the past latent label is not annotated in the current training, the past-missing partial label problem will occur, and similarly, the future-missing partial label problem will occur.\nAn MLCL model should incrementally recognize multiple labels as new classes are learned continuously.\n Practically, we solve the MLCL problems in two real-world labelling scenarios, i.e., the current training dataset has past and current labels (Continuous Labelling MLCL, CL-MLCL) or only current labels (Independent Labelling MLCL, IL-MLCL).\nThe IL-MLCL has past-missing and future-missing partial label problems, while CL-MLCL has only the future-missing partial label problem.\nAs for both scenarios, the partial label problem poses a significant challenge in building multi-label relationships and keeping them from catastrophic forgetting.\nIt is crucial to study a feasible solution to solve the partial label problem in MLCL.\nThis motivates us to design a unified MLCL solution to the sequential multi-label classification problem by considering the label relationships across tasks in both IL-MLCL and CL-MLCL scenarios. This paper is an extension of our previous work, Augmented Graph Convolutional Network (AGCN) 2, and we complete the real-world scenario of MLCL (IL-MLCL and CL-MLCL) and propose an improved version, AGCN++.\nOur AGCN++ has three major parts.\nFirst, to relate partial labels across tasks, we propose to construct an Augmented Correlation Matrix (ACM) sequentially in MLCL. We design a unified ACM constructor.\nFor CL-MLCL, ACM is updated by the hard label statistics from new training data at each task.\nFor IL-MLCL, an auto-updated expert network is designed to generate predictions of the old tasks. These predictions are used as soft labels to represent the old classes in constructing ACM.\nSecond, due to partial label problems, effective class representation is difficult to build. In our early conference work, the AGCN model utilized pre-given semantic information (i.e. word embedding) as class representation.\nThe fixed class representation will lead to the accumulation of errors in constructing label relationships due to partial label problems. Then, this will skew predictions and lead to more serious forgetting.\nSo in this work, AGCN++ utilizes a partial label encoder (PLE) to decompose each partial image’s feature into dynamic class representations. These class-specific representations will vary from image to image and are input as graph nodes into AGCN++. Moreover, unlike AGCN, which directly adds graph nodes manually, PLE can automatically generate graph nodes for each partial label image. Utilizing PLE to get the graph nodes can also reduce the impact of the low quality of word embeddings. So AGCN++ can generate a more convincing ACM and suppress forgetting.\nThird, we propose to encode the dynamically constructed ACM and graph nodes. The AGCN++ model correlates the label spaces of both the old and new tasks in a convolutional architecture and mines the latent correlation for every two classes. This information will be combined with the visual features for prediction.\nMoreover, to further mitigate the forgetting, a distillation loss function and a relationship-preserving graph loss function are designed for class-level forgetting and relationship-level forgetting, respectively.\n In this paper, we construct two multi-label image classification datasets, Split-COCO and Split-WIDE, based on widely-used multi-label datasets MS-COCO and NUS-WIDE.\nThe results on Split-COCO and Split-WIDE show that the proposed AGCN++ effectively reduces catastrophic forgetting for MLCL image recognition and can build convincing correlation across tasks whenever the labels of previous tasks are missing (IL-MLCL) or not (CL-MLCL).\nMoreover, our methods can effectively reduce catastrophic forgetting in two scenarios. This paper extends our AGCN 2 with the following new contents: We complete the real-world scenario of MLCL from IL-MLCL to CL-MLCL scenarios, and a unified AGCN++ model is redesigned to capture label dependencies to improve multi-label recognition in the data stream; We propose a novel partial label encoder (PLE) to decompose the global image features into dynamic graph nodes for each partial label image, which reduces the accumulation of errors in the construction of label relationships and suppresses forgetting; We propose a unified ACM constructor. The ACM is dynamically constructed using soft or hard labels to build label relationships across sequential tasks of MLCL to solve the partial label problem for IL-MLCL and CL-MLCL. The distillation loss and relationship-preserving loss readjust to IL-MLCL and CL-MLCL to mitigate the class- and relationship-level catastrophic forgetting; More experimental results are provided, including extensive comparisons on two different scenarios settings and more ablation studies, etc. More ablation studies and new SOTA MLCL results are provided.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: MACHINE learning approaches have been reported to exhibit human-level performance on some tasks, such as Atari games  or object recognition [ref]2.\nHowever, they always assume that no novel knowledge will be input into models, which is impractical in the real world.\nTo meet the scenario, continual learning develops intelligent systems\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
