      "content": "Paper Title: Zero-shot Natural Language Video Localization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough any fully supervised NLVL model can be used for our framework, as the pseudo-supervision has less structured sentences, we further propose an NLVL model to be better suited to the simplified sentence input.\nIn particular, we propose a simple attentive cross-modal neural network that learns the sentence structure less but focus more on word-frame attentions as illustrated in Fig. 5.\nWe empirically show that the proposed model slightly outperforms the state of the art NLVL model for fully supervised data, especially in high recall regime (R@0.5 and R@0.7) with less computational cost, in Sec. 4.1.3. Specifically, the model consists of three parts; 1) contextualized feature encoding to globally encode embedding features of video and simplified sentence input data, 2) multi-modal cross attention network and 3) temporal attentive regression to regress the temporal event region corresponding to the input simplified sentence.\nFor the multi-modal cross attention network, we use query-guided attention dynamic filter  [ref]44 that fuses the multi-modal information between video and language (Words-aware Video Attention or WVA), and a video-guided attention filter to learn the video-aware query embedding (Video-aware Words Attention or VWA) followed by a multi-modal cross attention mechanism to fuse all information (Multi-modal Cross Attention or MCA).\nThen, we apply Non-Local block (NL-Block) [ref]51 to encode the global contextual information obtained from the cross-attention module [ref]39.\nAfter the global context features are encoded with each other, we attend on the target temporal segments by temporal attention mechanism [ref]44 [ref]39.\nFinally, we predict the temporal boundary regions by a multi-layer perceptron. It consists of two terms; 1) temporal boundary regression loss (ℒr​e​gsubscriptℒ𝑟𝑒𝑔\\mathcal{L}_{reg}) and 2) temporal attention guided loss (ℒg​u​i​d​esubscriptℒ𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑑𝑒\\mathcal{L}_{guide}) as: where λ𝜆\\lambda is a balancing parameter.\nFollowing [ref]39, we use the Huber loss function  between the predicted and ground-truth timestamps for ℒr​e​gsubscriptℒ𝑟𝑒𝑔\\mathcal{L}_{reg} and use a temporal attention guidance loss (ℒg​u​i​d​esubscriptℒ𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑑𝑒\\mathcal{L}_{guide}) proposed in [ref]44 [ref]39.\nMore details of the model and the objective are in the supplement.\n As our model is trained with simplified sentence, inference requires translating natural language query into a simplified one. We use an off-the-shelf part-of-speech tagger  to convert a sentence to the simplified one.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: attentive regression to regress the temporal event region corresponding to the input simplified sentence.\nFor the multi-modal cross attention network, we use query-guided attention dynamic filter  [ref]44 that fuses the multi-modal information between video and language (Words-aware Video Attention or WVA), and a video-guided attention filter to learn the video-aware query embedding\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
