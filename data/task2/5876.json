Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Moment Retrieval.\nWe experiment with two CLIP-based heuristics methods and the event proposal module of BMT [ref]13, a dense video captioning model pretrained on ActivityNet Captions .\nWith CLIP, we compute the cosine similarity between all frames and the text query and find the frame with the highest score.\nThen we determine the start/end boundary of a moment with two different heuristics:\n1) picking the frames where the similarity score drops from the highest scoring frame by a certain threshold (e.g., 0.10);\n2) picking the 8 frames to the left and right, totaling up to 17 (= 8+1+8) frames\n(see appendix for details).\nFurthermore, we experiment with the BMT [ref]13 event proposal module, which predicts video event proposals with center/length/confidence values.\nWe allow BMT to generate various events and then take the minimum start time and maximum end time across the events as the retrieved moment.\nFor BMT, we give the model the I3D  RGB+Flow features and VGGish  audio features of the entire video, extracted at 1fps. Moment Segmentation.\nWe experiment with 1) framewise difference with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) , and\n2) the event proposal module of BMT [ref]13.\nFor SSIM, if two adjacent frames have an SSIM below a certain threshold (e.g., 0.85), we mark that as a step boundary.\nFor BMT, we feed the model I3D and VGGish features (extracted at 1fps) of the entire video and directly use the video event proposal prediction. Step Captioning.\nWe experiment with BMT and SwinBERT 0, a pretrained video captioning model.\nFor BMT, we use I3D and VGGish features of each step, extracted at 1fps.\nWe do not use its event proposal module for this task, as we give the features within the ground-truth step boundaries.\nFor SwinBERT, we use YouCook2  checkpoint and 32 video frames from each step as input to the model.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: the original setup, we use 4 frames for Frozen-in-Time and 32 frames for MIL-NCE.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
