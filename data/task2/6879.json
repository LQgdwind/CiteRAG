Most similar to our work is that of , which proposed an iterative layer-wise optimization strategy to select mixed-precision bit widths to avoid overflow using computationally expensive heuristics.\nTheir derived bounds on accumulator bit width do not guarantee overflow avoidance for all edge cases and assume only signed bit widths for all data types.\nOur proposed quantization method adds negligible training overhead and constrains QNNs to guarantee overflow avoidance while accounting for both signed and unsigned input data types. Prior research has also sought to leverage weight normalization for quantization, but as a means of regularizing long-tail weight distributions during QAT  .\nCai et al.  replace the standard ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-norm with an ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}-norm and derive a projection operator to map real values into the quantized domain.\nLi et al.  normalize the weights to have zero mean and unit variance and observe increased stability.\nIn our work, we replace the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-norm with an ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-norm to use the weight normalization parameterization as a means of constraining learned weights during training to use a user-defined accumulator bit width during inference. Tangential to our work,  and  study the impact of reducing the precision of floating-point accumulators for the purpose of accelerating training.\nSuch methods do not directly translate to integer quantization and fixed-point arithmetic, which is the focus of this work.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: Another approach to training QNNs to use lower precision accumulators is to mitigate the impact of overflow on model accuracy.\nXie et al.  and Li et al. [ref]25 sought use adaptive scaling factors to reduce the expected overflow rate as empirically estimated over the training data.\nTheir formulation is unable to guarantee overflow avoidance as it is\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
