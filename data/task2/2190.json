      "content": "Paper Title: QFCNN: Quantum Fourier Convolutional Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExisting works   have attempted to incorporate the classical machine learning algorithms and quantum computation techniques, which yields quantum machine learning frameworks.\nIt is also promising for deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to be leveraged with quantum methods towards achieving quantum convolutional models, thanks to the following reasons.\nFirst, CNNs manipulate data in the manner of performing matrix operations in high dimensional vector space, while quantum computation also conducts matrix operations in high dimensional vector space . Second, most of the deep CNN models require large datasets for parameter optimization, and often need heavy computation for both the training and testing. Meanwhile, based on special quantum information properties named entanglement and superposition, quantum computers can make exponential number of calculations in parallel. This mechanism, known as quantum speedup, can accelerate some learning algorithms to surpass their classical counterparts based on mathematical proofs [ref]3   . Two decades ago, scientists began to implement quantum algorithms on real quantum machines. With the continuous development of quantum hardware, scientists suggest that human beings will live in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era in the future, and everyone is expected to have a quantum computer with 50-100 qubits, which could be used to perform some special tasks that surpass the capabilities of today’s classical computers  . Recently, deep neural networks become quite popular and have been widely applied in computer vision, natural language processing, and many other areas, thanks to the advancement of deep learning techniques [ref]9 0 1. As one of the most important deep learning techniques, the convolution module has been used in many network architectures, and many state-of-art models for handling different types of tasks contain convolutional layers 2 3 4 5. Given the aforementioned background of quantum computation and flourish CNN fields, it becomes natural that we get interested in integrating the potentials and advantages of these two kinds of techniques, i.e., quantum computing and CNNs, to handle specific convolution-based learning tasks that need continuously increasing computation capabilities. However, the direct convolution of quantum state has been shown to be inaccessible by previous studies  6. In this paper, we propose a hybrid circuit with quantum Fourier transform to achieve deep convolutional models with quantum. The major blocks in CNNs are the convolutional operations, i.e., the product of the kernel and the input data that can have various dimensions. This process often accounts for a large proportion of the computation cost and time consumption in the whole network. Another approach that can be used to efficiently implement the convolutional operation is transforming the kernel and data to Fourier basis and then performing inverse transform based on their product. Some of the classical networks like graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have used the approximation of this method to implement convolution 7 8 9.\nInspired by this, to achieve quantum convolution, here we propose a novel quantum Fourier convolutional network (QFCN) to speedup the CNN with quantum Fourier transform (QFT), which could be exponentially faster than the classical Fourier transform for convolutions. We circumvent the inaccessibility issue 6 by adopting part quantum circuit of windowed Fourier transform 0. We also propose a hybrid quantum-classical circuit to avoid some of the quantum noise and also to take advantage of classical computers that are able to perform rapid iterations for model optimization.\nWe demonstrate the potential of our network on the traffic prediction task with spatio-temporal graph convolutional models and the image classification task with 2D convolutional networks. Motivations and contributions.\nWe all know the importance of convolution to the deep learning field. If we want to speed up the training of nowadays’ networks which mostly build upon a bunch of convolutional layers, the quantum convolutional layer and its optimization will be inevitable problems. There are only two architectures of convolutional layer being proposed1 2 . However, due to the horrific time assumption of quantum stimulation, the results of these two papers are based on toy experiments and their network only contain two quantum convolutional layers. Unfortunately, with the increase of the layer number, the gradient of these two structures may lead to Barren plateaus 3 in training. So, it is essential to proposed another quantum convolution method rather than simply transferring conventional multiply accumulation (MAC) to quantum mechanism like previous works. The contributions of this paper are summarized below. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a hybrid quantum-classical circuit to speed up CNN with a parametric quantum circuit (PQC), and exploit quantum Fourier transform for the trainable convolution models. Specifically, our PQC can be inserted into different deep networks to replace the convolutional layers.\nBesides,\nwe also introduce the quantum optimization algorithm (back-propagation) for our designed network.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: exponential number of calculations in parallel.
