      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Android Malware Detection System against Adversarial Attacks using Q-Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMalware analysis and detection is a rat race between malware designers and the anti-malware community. Currently, anti-viruses mostly works on signature-based detection engines  4 . A signature is a unique value which indicates the presence of malicious code in the test application  . These signatures are stored in the anti-virus database and compared with the test application during anti-virus scanning. If any signature from the database matches the test application, then it is declared as malicious otherwise not . The signature-based mechanism is vastly human-driven, time-consuming and does not provide security against zero-day attacks . Heuristic and behaviour-based detection mechanisms often complement the signature engines  4. In heuristic-based detection, rules are developed to separate malicious and benign applications. Typically domain experts draft these rules which can also detect zero-day attacks. Developing generic rules to detect malware samples is again human-driven, error-prone and often hard to achieve without increasing the false positive rate . Behaviour-based detection mechanism check for run-time triggers that can capture properties of the malware applications. These signature, heuristic, and behaviour based mechanisms are vastly human dependent, time-consuming and not scalable and thus cannot detect next-generation polymorphic/metamorphic malware . During the past few years, the anti-malware research community has investigated the development of Android malware detection systems based on machine learning and deep learning which has shown promising results. Developing these solutions is a two-step process: 1) Feature Engineering, and 2) Classification/Clustering. In the first phase of feature engineering, extraction of features are performed using static, dynamic or hybrid analysis  4. If the features are extracted without executing an Android application, then it is known as static analysis. In this, Arp et al. in 2014 extracted roughly 545,000545000545,000 features by static analysis from the Android applications and constructed Android malware detection model using support vector machine . On the other hand, when features are extracted by executing an Android application inside a sandbox or controlled environment, then it is called dynamic analysis. Dash et al. in DroidScribe extracted features like network addresses, file access, binder methods etc. and proposed a malware detection model using support vector machine . In the hybrid analysis, features extracted using both static and dynamic analysis are combined to develop the malware detection models. SAMADroid proposed by Arshad et al. used six static features (permission, intent etc.), one dynamic feature (system call) and four classification algorithms (support vector machine, decision tree, etc.) to construct the malware detection system . In the second phase of Classification/Clustering, various machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be used to construct the classification models. Wu et al. proposed Droidmat which extracted permissions, intents, API calls etc. from Android applications. They performed feature reduction using single value decomposition followed by building Android malware detection model based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm and achieved an accuracy of 97.87%percent97.8797.87\\% 7. Droid-Sec by Yuan et al. extracted more than 200200200 features from Android apps and constructed malware detection models using SVM, LR, DNN etc. They achieved the highest detection accuracy of 96.5%percent96.596.5\\% with DNN based model 0. Yerima et al. constructed a malware detection model based on the Bayesian approach and attained an accuracy of 92.1%percent92.192.1\\% 9. Lindorfer et al. in ANDRUBIS downloaded more than 1,000,00010000001,000,000 apps and found that malicious applications tend to request more permissions than benign applications [ref]19. Sewak et al. used deep learning based autoencoders and deep neural network for developing malware detection models and achieved an accuracy of 99.21%percent99.2199.21\\% . Rathore et al. proposed Android malware models based on clustering and classification and achieved the highest accuracy of 95.82%percent95.8295.82\\% with random forest . Appice et al. proposed MuViDA, which collected features like permission, intent, API calls from Android applications. They developed additional features with clustering and classification algorithms and achieved the highest AUC of 96.6%percent96.696.6\\% . With the rise of machine learning models, evasion attacks have gained popularity. One such attack is the mimicry attack that had successfully reduced the detection model accuracy by injecting beingness into malware samples to misclassify them. DNN models are also susceptible to such attacks, Grosse et al., Kolosnjaji et al. and others demonstrated this by successfully misleading a neural network using carefully crafted samples 4  . Their idea involved using a genetic algorithm to add perturbations in the malware file to evade the detection system. AL can also be used to perform grey-box attacks. Battista Biggio showed that even with limited knowledge of the target system, classification algorithms can be evaded with very high probability . With the rise of adversarial attacks, adversarial learning has also gained popularity among different machine learning domains like computer vision, spam detection etc. Ian J. Goodfellow , Florian Tramer 5, and Aleksander Madry 1 have shown the advantage of using adversarial learning to improve the robustness of neural network models. Adversarial learning also improves resilience against a single step attack as shown by Alexey Kurakin . Based on above discussions, it can be inferred that using AL can improve the robustness of existing models.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: 9.
