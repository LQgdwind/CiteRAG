      "content": "Paper Title: Geometry-Complete Diffusion for 3D Molecule Generation and Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNoise parametrization. We now need to define our learned generative reverse process that denoises pure noise into realistic examples from the original data distribution. Towards this end, we can directly use the noise posteriors q​(𝐳s|𝐳t,𝐳0)𝑞conditionalsubscript𝐳𝑠subscript𝐳𝑡subscript𝐳0q(\\mathbf{z}_{s}|\\mathbf{z}_{t},\\mathbf{z}_{0}) of Eq. 4 of our supplementary materials with 𝐳0∼(ℳ=[𝐱,𝐡])similar-tosubscript𝐳0ℳ𝐱𝐡\\mathbf{z}_{0}\\sim(\\mathcal{M}=[\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{h}]). However, to do so, we must replace the input variables 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} and 𝐡𝐡\\mathbf{h} with the approximations 𝐱^^𝐱\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} and 𝐡^^𝐡\\hat{\\mathbf{h}} predicted by our denoising neural network 𝚽𝚽\\bm{\\Phi}: where the values for 𝐳~0=[𝐱^,𝐡^]subscript~𝐳0^𝐱^𝐡\\mathbf{\\tilde{z}}_{0}=[\\hat{\\mathbf{x}},\\hat{\\mathbf{h}}] depend on 𝐳tsubscript𝐳𝑡\\mathbf{z}_{t}, t𝑡t, and our denoising neural network 𝚽𝚽\\bm{\\Phi}. In the context of diffusion models, many different parametrizations of 𝝁𝚽t→s​(𝐳t,𝐳~0)subscript𝝁subscript𝚽→𝑡𝑠subscript𝐳𝑡subscript~𝐳0\\bm{\\mu}_{\\bm{\\Phi}_{t\\rightarrow s}}(\\mathbf{z}_{t},\\mathbf{\\tilde{z}}_{0}) are possible. Prior works have found that it is often easier to optimize a diffusion model using a noise parametrization to predict the noise ϵ^^bold-italic-ϵ\\hat{\\bm{\\epsilon}}. In this work, we use such a parametrization to predict ϵ^=[ϵ^(x),ϵ^(h)]^bold-italic-ϵsuperscript^bold-italic-ϵ𝑥superscript^bold-italic-ϵℎ\\hat{\\bm{\\epsilon}}=[\\hat{\\bm{\\epsilon}}^{(x)},\\hat{\\bm{\\epsilon}}^{(h)}], which represents the noise individually added to 𝐱^^𝐱\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} and 𝐡^^𝐡\\hat{\\mathbf{h}}. We can then use the predicted ϵ^^bold-italic-ϵ\\hat{\\bm{\\epsilon}} to derive: Invariant likelihood. Ideally, we desire for a 3D molecular diffusion model to assign the same likelihood to a generated molecule even after arbitrarily rotating or translating it in 3D space. To ensure our model achieves this desirable property for p𝚽​(𝐳0)subscript𝑝𝚽subscript𝐳0p_{\\bm{\\Phi}}(\\mathbf{z}_{0}), we can leverage the insight that an invariant distribution composed of an equivariant transition function yields an invariant distribution (Satorras et al. 7, Xu et al. [ref]6, Hoogeboom\net al. ). Moreover, to address the translation invariance issue raised by Satorras et al. 7 in the context of handling a distribution over 3D coordinates, we adopt the zero center of gravity trick proposed by Xu et al. [ref]6 to define 𝒩xsubscript𝒩𝑥\\mathcal{N}_{x} as a normal distribution on the subspace defined by ∑i𝐱i=𝟎subscript𝑖subscript𝐱𝑖0\\sum_{i}\\mathbf{x}_{i}=\\mathbf{0}. In contrast, to handle node features 𝐡isubscript𝐡𝑖\\mathbf{h}_{i} that are rotation and translation-invariant, we can instead use a conventional normal distribution 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N}. As such, if we parametrize our transition function p𝚽subscript𝑝𝚽p_{\\bm{\\Phi}} using an SE(3)-equivariant neural network after using the zero center of gravity trick of Xu et al. [ref]6, our model will have achieved the desired likelihood invariance property. Geometry-completeness. Furthermore, in this work, we postulate that certain types of geometric neural networks serve as more effective 3D graph denoising functions for molecular DDPMs. We describe this notion as follows. (Geometry-Complete Denoising).\n\nGeometric neural networks that achieve geometry-completeness are more robust in denoising 3D molecular network inputs compared to models that are not geometry-complete, in that geometry-complete methods unambiguously define direction-robust local geometric reference frames. This hypothesis comes as an extension of the definition of geometry-completeness from Du et al.  and Morehead and\nCheng : (Geometric Completeness).\n\nGiven a pair of node positions (xit,xjt)superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑗𝑡(x_{i}^{t},x_{j}^{t}) in a 3D graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G},\nwith vectors ai​jt∈ℝ1×3superscriptsubscript𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑡superscriptℝ13a_{ij}^{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{1\\times 3}, bi​jt∈ℝ1×3superscriptsubscript𝑏𝑖𝑗𝑡superscriptℝ13b_{ij}^{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{1\\times 3}, and ci​jt∈ℝ1×3superscriptsubscript𝑐𝑖𝑗𝑡superscriptℝ13c_{ij}^{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{1\\times 3} derived from (xit,xjt)superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑗𝑡(x_{i}^{t},x_{j}^{t}), \na local geometric representation 𝓕i​jt=(ai​jt,bi​jt,ci​jt)∈ℝ3×3superscriptsubscript𝓕𝑖𝑗𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑏𝑖𝑗𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑐𝑖𝑗𝑡superscriptℝ33\\bm{\\mathcal{F}}_{ij}^{t}=(a_{ij}^{t},b_{ij}^{t},c_{ij}^{t})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3\\times 3} is considered\ngeometrically complete if 𝓕i​jtsuperscriptsubscript𝓕𝑖𝑗𝑡\\bm{\\mathcal{F}}_{ij}^{t} is non-degenerate, hence forming \na\nlocal orthonormal basis located at the tangent space of xitsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑡x_{i}^{t}. An intuition for the implications of Hypothesis 3.2 and Definition 3.3 on molecular diffusion models is that geometry-complete networks should be able to more effectively learn the gradients of data distributions (Ho et al. ) in which a global force field is present, as is typically the case with 3D molecules (Du et al. ). This is because, broadly speaking, geometry-complete methods encode local reference frames for each node (or edge) under which the directions of arbitrary global force vectors can be mapped. In addition to describing the theoretical benefits offered to geometry-complete denoising networks, we support this hypothesis through specific ablation studies in Sections 2.1 and 2.3 where we ablate our geometric frame encodings from GCDM and find that such frames are particularly useful in improving GCDM’s ability to generate stable 3D molecules. GCPNet++. Inspired by its recent success in modeling 3D molecular structures with geometry-complete message-passing, we will parametrize p𝚽subscript𝑝𝚽p_{\\bm{\\Phi}} using an enhanced version of Geometry-Complete Perceptron Networks (GCPNets) that were originally introduced by Morehead and\nCheng . To summarize, GCPNet is a geometry-complete graph neural network that is equivariant to SE(3) transformations of its graph inputs and, as such, satisfies our SE(3) equivariance constraint (3.1) and maps nicely to the context of Hypothesis 3.2. In this setting, with (hi∈𝐇subscriptℎ𝑖𝐇h_{i}\\in\\mathbf{H}, χi∈𝝌subscript𝜒𝑖𝝌\\chi_{i}\\in\\bm{\\chi}, ei​j∈𝐄,ξi​j∈𝝃formulae-sequencesubscript𝑒𝑖𝑗𝐄subscript𝜉𝑖𝑗𝝃e_{ij}\\in\\mathbf{E},\\xi_{ij}\\in\\bm{\\xi}), GCPNet++, our enhanced version of GCPNet, consists of a composition of Geometry-Complete Graph Convolution (𝐆𝐂𝐏𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐆𝐂𝐏𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯\\mathbf{GCPConv}) layers (hil,χil),xil=𝐆𝐂𝐏𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯​[(hil−1,χil−1),(ei​jl−1,ξi​jl−1),xil−1,ℱi​j]superscriptsubscriptℎ𝑖𝑙superscriptsubscript𝜒𝑖𝑙superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑙𝐆𝐂𝐏𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯superscriptsubscriptℎ𝑖𝑙1superscriptsubscript𝜒𝑖𝑙1superscriptsubscript𝑒𝑖𝑗𝑙1superscriptsubscript𝜉𝑖𝑗𝑙1superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑙1subscriptℱ𝑖𝑗(h_{i}^{l},\\chi_{i}^{l}),x_{i}^{l}=\\mathbf{GCPConv}[(h_{i}^{l-1},\\chi_{i}^{l-1}),(e_{ij}^{l-1},\\xi_{ij}^{l-1}),x_{i}^{l-1},\\mathcal{F}_{ij}] which are defined as: where nil=(hil,χil)superscriptsubscript𝑛𝑖𝑙superscriptsubscriptℎ𝑖𝑙superscriptsubscript𝜒𝑖𝑙n_{i}^{l}=(h_{i}^{l},\\chi_{i}^{l}); ϕlsuperscriptbold-italic-ϕ𝑙\\bm{\\phi}^{l} is a trainable function; l𝑙l signifies the representation depth of the network; 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is a permutation-invariant aggregation function; 𝛀ωsubscript𝛀𝜔\\bm{\\Omega}_{\\omega} represents a message-passing function corresponding to the ω𝜔\\omega-th 𝐆𝐂𝐏𝐆𝐂𝐏\\mathbf{GCP} message-passing layer (Morehead and\nCheng ); and node i𝑖i’s geometry-complete local frames are ℱi​jt=(ai​jt,bi​jt,ci​jt)superscriptsubscriptℱ𝑖𝑗𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑏𝑖𝑗𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑐𝑖𝑗𝑡\\mathcal{F}_{ij}^{t}=(a_{ij}^{t},b_{ij}^{t},c_{ij}^{t}), with ai​jt=xit−xjt∥xit−xjt∥,bi​jt=xit×xjt∥xit×xjt∥,formulae-sequencesuperscriptsubscript𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑗𝑡delimited-∥∥superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑗𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑏𝑖𝑗𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑗𝑡delimited-∥∥superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑗𝑡a_{ij}^{t}=\\frac{x_{i}^{t}-x_{j}^{t}}{\\lVert x_{i}^{t}-x_{j}^{t}\\rVert},b_{ij}^{t}=\\frac{x_{i}^{t}\\times x_{j}^{t}}{\\lVert x_{i}^{t}\\times x_{j}^{t}\\rVert}, and ci​jt=ai​jt×bi​jtsuperscriptsubscript𝑐𝑖𝑗𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑏𝑖𝑗𝑡c_{ij}^{t}=a_{ij}^{t}\\times b_{ij}^{t}, respectively. Importantly, GCPNet++ restructures the network flow of 𝐆𝐂𝐏𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐆𝐂𝐏𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯\\mathbf{GCPConv} (Morehead and\nCheng ) for each iteration of node feature updates to simplify and enhance information flow, concretely from the form of to and from to Note that here f𝑓f represents a summation or a mean function that is invariant to node order permutations; ∪\\cup denotes the concatenation operation; geω,vilsubscriptsuperscript𝑔𝑙superscript𝑒𝜔subscript𝑣𝑖g^{l}_{e^{\\omega},v_{i}} represents the binary-valued (i.e., [ref]0 ) output of a scalar message attention (gating) function, expressed as with ϕi​n​f:ℝe→[ref]0 1:subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖𝑛𝑓→superscriptℝ𝑒superscript011\\phi_{inf}:\\mathbb{R}^{e}\\rightarrow[ref]0 ^{1} mapping from high-dimensional scalar edge feature space to a single dimension and σ𝜎\\sigma denoting a sigmoid activation function; r𝑟r is the node feature update module index; ResGCP is a version of the GCP module with added residual connections; and Ωω,vil=(Ωeω,vil,Ωξω,vil)superscriptsubscriptΩ𝜔subscript𝑣𝑖𝑙superscriptsubscriptΩsuperscript𝑒𝜔subscript𝑣𝑖𝑙superscriptsubscriptΩsuperscript𝜉𝜔subscript𝑣𝑖𝑙\\Omega_{\\omega,v_{i}}^{l}=(\\Omega_{e^{\\omega},v_{i}}^{l},\\Omega_{\\xi^{\\omega},v_{i}}^{l}) represents the scalar (e𝑒e) and vector-valued (ξ𝜉\\xi) messages derived with respect to node visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} using up to ω𝜔\\omega message-passing iterations within each GCPNet++ layer. We found these adaptations to provide state-of-the-art molecule generation results compared to the original node feature updating scheme, which we found yielded sub-optimal results in the context of generative modeling. This highlights the importance of customizing representation learning algorithms for the generative modeling task at hand, since reasonable performance may not always be achievable with them without careful adaptations. It is worth noting that, since GCPNet++ performs message-passing directly on 3D vector features, GCDM is thereby the first diffusion generative model that is in principle capable of generating 3D molecules with specific vector-valued properties. We leave a full exploration of this idea for future work. Properties of GCDM. Lastly, if one desires to update the coordinate representations of each node in 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}, as we do in the context of 3D molecule generation, the 𝐆𝐂𝐏𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐆𝐂𝐏𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯\\mathbf{GCPConv} module of GCPNet++ provides a simple, SE(3)-equivariant method to do so using a dedicated 𝐆𝐂𝐏𝐆𝐂𝐏\\mathbf{GCP} module as follows: where 𝐆𝐂𝐏⋅l​(⋅,ℱi​j)superscriptsubscript𝐆𝐂𝐏⋅𝑙⋅subscriptℱ𝑖𝑗\\mathbf{GCP}_{\\cdot}^{l}(\\cdot,\\mathcal{F}_{ij}) is defined to provide chirality-aware rotation and translation-invariant updates to hisubscriptℎ𝑖h_{i} and rotation-equivariant updates to χisubscript𝜒𝑖\\chi_{i} following centralization of the input point cloud’s coordinates 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} (Du et al. ). The effect of using positional feature updates χpisubscript𝜒subscript𝑝𝑖\\chi_{p_{i}} to update xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} is, after decentralizing 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} following the final 𝐆𝐂𝐏𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐆𝐂𝐏𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯\\mathbf{GCPConv} layer, that updates to xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} then become SE(3)-equivariant. As such, all transformations described above satisfy the required equivariance constraint in Def. 3.1. Therefore, in integrating GCPNet++ as its 3D graph denoiser, GCDM achieves SE(3) equivariance, geometry-completeness, and likelihood invariance altogether. Important to note is that GCDM subsequently performs message-passing with vector features to denoise its geometric inputs, whereas previous methods denoise their inputs solely using geometrically-insufficient scalar message-passing  as we demonstrate through our experiments in our Section 2.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: we can leverage the insight that an invariant distribution composed of an equivariant transition function yields an invariant distribution (Satorras et al. 7, Xu et al.
