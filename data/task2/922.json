      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-grained Semantics-aware Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph neural networks.\nThe existing GNN models can be generally categorised into spectral and spatial approaches.\nThe spectral approach utilises the Fourier transformation to define convolution operation in the graph domain¬†[ref]3.\nHowever, its incurred heavy computation cost hinders it from being applied to large-scale graphs.\nLater on, a series of spatial models drawn remarkable attention due to their effectiveness and efficiency in node-wise tasks¬†[ref]15        , such as link prediction, node classification and node clustering.\nThey mainly rely on the flat message-passing mechanism\nthat defines convolution by iteratively aggregating messages from the neighbouring nodes.\nRecent studies have proved that the spatial approach is a special form of Laplacian smoothing and is limited to summarising each node‚Äôs local information¬† .\nBesides, they are either unable to capture global information\nor incapable of aggregating messages in a multi-grained manner to support graph classification tasks. Graph pooling.\nPooling operation overcomes GNN‚Äôs weakness in generating graph-level representation by recursively merge sets of nodes to form super nodes in the pooled graph.\nDiffPool¬† is a differentiable pooling operator, which learns a soft assign matrix that maps each node to a set of clusters, treated as super nodes.\nSince this assignment is rather dense that incurs high computation cost, it is not scalable for large graphs¬†.\nFollowing this direction, a Top-kùëòk selection based pooling layer (g-U-Net) is proposed to select important nodes from the original graph to build a pooled graph¬†[ref]9.\nSagPool¬† and ASAP¬† further use attention and self-attention for cluster assignment, GXN¬† uses mutual information estimation for super node selection.\nThey address the problem of sparsity in DiffPool, however, such a manual-defined hyper-parameter kùëòk is quite sensitive to the final performance¬†[ref]9, thus limits the adaptivity of these models on graphs of different sizes.\nIn addition, as shown in Figure¬†1, different kùëòk values will significantly affect the number of covered nodes in the graph, which means the important node features could get lost during the trivial pooling operation.\nNote that nodes covered by a super node refer to nodes involved in the super node‚Äôs aggregation tree. Recently, EigenPool¬† proposes a pooling operator based on graph Fourier which does not rely on the Top-kùëòk selection strategy, StructPool¬† designs strategies to involve both node and graph structures, and includes conditional random fields technique to ameliorate the cluster assignment.\nHowever, StructPool treats the graph assignment as a dense clustering problem, which gives rise to a high computation complexity as in DiffPool. Discussion.\nTable¬†I summarises the key advantages of the proposed AdamGNN and compares it with a number of state-of-the-art methods.\nAmong the existing GNN models, g-U-Net, GXN and AdamGNN support both node- and graph-level tasks.\nHowever, (i) the Top-k selection strategy of g-U-Net and GXN introduces a new hyper-parameter and may lose important node features or graph structure;\n(ii) g-U-Net and GXN generate super graph only with kùëòk selected super nodes, which ruins multi-grained semantics of the original graph;\n(iii) g-U-Net does not support mini-batch because it needs to compute scores of all nodes in one big batch to select super nodes;\n(iv) GXN requires positive and negative node sets sampling which introduces additional operation and the random sampling strategy brings unmanageable uncertainty on model performance¬†.\nOn the contrary, AdamGNN is a unified framework that adaptively integrates multi-grained semantics into node representations, and achieves a mutual optimisation between node- and graph-wise tasks.\nBesides, AdamGNN supports efficient mini-batch pooling and unpooling, and also provides model explanation via the multi-grained semantics.\nTherefore, we believe AdamGNN‚Äôs framework is more general, effective and scalable than G-U-Net.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: existing GNN models can be generally categorised into spectral and spatial approaches.\nThe spectral approach utilises the Fourier transformation to define convolution operation in the graph domain¬†[ref]3.\nHowever, its incurred heavy computation cost hinders it from being applied to large-scale graphs.\nLater on, a series of spatial models drawn remarkable attention due to their effectiveness\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
