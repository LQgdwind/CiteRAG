      "content": "Paper Title: The Universal Law of Generalization Holds for Naturalistic Stimuli\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe average similarity matrices over the different domains and tasks are summarized in Figure 2. The first thing to observe is that the generalization and similarity judgment tasks yield results that are significantly correlated across domains, with a Pearson correlation of r=.71𝑟.71r=.71 (95% CI [.69,.74].69.74[.69,.74]) for animals, r=.55𝑟.55r=.55 (95% CI [.52,.58].52.58[.52,.58]) for fruits, and r=.36𝑟.36r=.36 (95% CI [.33,.40].33.40[.33,.40]) for vegetables (CIs bootstrapped over participants with 100 repetitions). This is consistent with the expectation that generalization over blank properties and similarity judgments capture shared variance . Next, to get a better sense of the psychological content of those spaces, we visualized their two-dimensional MDS solutions in Figure 3. All three domains revealed a semantically structured organization of the stimuli. In the case of animal images, distinct and interpretable organization schemes emerged, corresponding to animal categories such as herbivores, carnivores, amphibians, reptiles, and birds. In the case of fruits and vegetables the distribution is more continuous, with color serving as a clear semantic axis, with interpretable subclasses occupying different areas of the space such as citrus fruits and berries in the case of fruits, and whether the vegetable grows above or below the ground in the case of vegetables. These results are consistent with the findings of  in the case of similarity and extend them to generalization, implying again that both tasks are capturing shared semantic content. We are now ready to analyze the generalization gradients for each of the conditions and test to what extent they can be explained by the different models. The average binned gradients along with their optimal fit for all models are shown in Figure 4 (see Methods; raw gradients are shown in Supplementary Figure 6; explicit fitted parameter values and their CIs are provided in Supplementary Tables 3-5 and 8-10 for the raw and binned analyses, respectively). As can be seen, the scatter points appear to follow a concave trend, with the similarity data in particular tightly tracking the exponential curve, which also overlaps substantially with the quadratic and GAM models. The linear model, on the other hand, appears to find some intermediate compromise due to its limited flexibility. To quantify this, we provide the full list of evaluation metrics on the raw gradients in Tables 1-2 (see Supplementary Tables 6-7 for additional metrics; see also Tables 11-12 and 13-14 for the binned equivalent). The exponential function provides an excellent model for the data with an average model-data Pearson correlation of rc=.96subscript𝑟𝑐.96r_{c}=.96 (corrected for attenuation, see Methods). To see where the exponential model stands with respect to the different models in each condition, we bootstrapped the difference in variance explained Δ​R2=Rexponential2−Rmodel2Δsuperscript𝑅2subscriptsuperscript𝑅2exponentialsubscriptsuperscript𝑅2model\\Delta R^{2}=R^{2}_{\\text{exponential}}-R^{2}_{\\text{model}}, and the Bayesian Information Criterion Δ​BICΔBIC\\Delta\\text{BIC} (see Methods) between the exponential model and the other models. \nStarting from the domain of similarity, we found that the exponential model outperformed the linear model in all three domains, with Δ​R2Δsuperscript𝑅2\\Delta R^{2} 95% CIs given by [.04,.10].04.10[.04,.10], [.13,.14].13.14[.13,.14], [.13,.14].13.14[.13,.14] for animals, fruits, and vegetables, respectively. The same pattern holds for the corresponding Δ​BICΔBIC\\Delta\\text{BIC} CIs (i.e., when penalizing for complexity),   ,   ,    (positive values favor exponential in our definition of Δ​BICΔBIC\\Delta\\text{BIC}). As for the quadratic solution, the models performed practically the same (with a slight boost for the exponential) with Δ​R2Δsuperscript𝑅2\\Delta R^{2} CIs given by [−.001,.001].001.001[-.001,.001], [.009,.017].009.017[.009,.017], and [.010,.014].010.014[.010,.014] for animals, fruits and vegetables, respectively (and likewise for the corresponding Δ​BICΔBIC\\Delta\\text{BIC}, [−40,31]4031[-40,31],   , and   ). Crucially, however, all quadratic solutions converged on concave curvature with strictly positive second derivatives g′′​(x)=2​a>0superscript𝑔′′𝑥2𝑎0g^{\\prime\\prime}(x)=2a>0 with CIs [1.77,1.85]1.771.85[1.77,1.85], [2.36,2.24]2.362.24[2.36,2.24], and [2.22,2.31]2.222.31[2.22,2.31] (see Table 5) consistent with the universal law hypothesis. Finally, for the flexible GAM model, we found that it was unable to meaningfully improve on the exponential model despite its flexibility, with Δ​R2Δsuperscript𝑅2\\Delta R^{2} CIs given by [−.006,−.002].006.002[-.006,-.002], [−.008,−.004].008.004[-.008,-.004], [−.006,−.002].006.002[-.006,-.002], and Δ​BICΔBIC\\Delta\\text{BIC} CIs given by [−123,84]12384[-123,84], [ref]19 [ref]19 ,   , for animals, fruits and vegetables, respectively. \nAs for the generalization data, we observed a similar pattern, namely, the exponential model outpeformed the linear (Δ​R2Δsuperscript𝑅2\\Delta R^{2} CIs, [.019,.025].019.025[.019,.025], [.014,.024].014.024[.014,.024], [.012,.024].012.024[.012,.024], and Δ​BICΔBIC\\Delta\\text{BIC} CIs,   ,   ,   , for animals, fruits and vegetables, respectively). Likewise, the quadratic model performed on par with the exponential model (Δ​R2Δsuperscript𝑅2\\Delta R^{2} CIs, [.001,.001].001.001[.001,.001], [.002,.004].002.004[.002,.004], [.008,.012].008.012[.008,.012], and Δ​BICΔBIC\\Delta\\text{BIC} CIs,   ,  52845 5,   ), and was strictly concave on all domains (g′′​(x)=2​a>0superscript𝑔′′𝑥2𝑎0g^{\\prime\\prime}(x)=2a>0 with CIs [0.82,0.93]0.820.93[0.82,0.93], [0.90,1.05]0.901.05[0.90,1.05], and [0.99,1.13]0.991.13[0.99,1.13]). Finally, the GAM model did not improve on the exponential model despite the additional degrees of freedom Δ​R2Δsuperscript𝑅2\\Delta R^{2} CIs, [.002,.000].002.000[.002,.000], [−.004,.000].004.000[-.004,.000], [−.009,.003].009.003[-.009,.003], and Δ​BICΔBIC\\Delta\\text{BIC} CIs,   , 0 1201510 ,  875128 8). Viewed together, these results provide direct evidence for the universal law of generalization. Note: The measures are: R2superscript𝑅2R^{2} coefficient of determination, rm​dsubscript𝑟𝑚𝑑r_{md} model-data Pearson correlation, rcsubscript𝑟𝑐r_{c} model-data correlation corrected for attenuation, and Δ​BICΔBIC\\Delta\\text{BIC} the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) relative to the exponential model in each category. δ𝛿\\delta indicates 95% confidence error (i.e., δ​X=1.96⋅σX𝛿𝑋⋅1.96subscript𝜎𝑋\\delta X=1.96\\cdot\\sigma_{X} where σXsubscript𝜎𝑋\\sigma_{X} is the standard deviation of X𝑋X).
