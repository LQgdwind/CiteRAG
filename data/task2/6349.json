      "content": "Paper Title: \"A\"²⁢\"CiD\"²: Accelerating Asynchronous Communication in Decentralized Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and their training datasets become larger and more complex, the computational demands and the need for efficient training schemes continues to escalate. Distributed training methods offer a solution by enabling the parallel optimization of model parameters across multiple workers. Yet, many of the current distributed methods in use are synchronous, and have significantly influenced the design of cluster computing environments. Thus, both the environments and algorithms rely heavily on high synchronicity in machine computations and near-instantaneous communication in high-bandwidth networks, favoring the adoption of centralized algorithms [ref]7. However, several studies 7 [ref]44  8 are challenging this paradigm, proposing decentralized asynchronous algorithms that leverage minor time-delays fluctuations between workers to enhance the parallelization of computations and communications. Unlike centralized algorithms, decentralized approaches allow each node to contribute proportionally to its available resources, eliminating the necessity for a global central worker to aggregate results. Combined with asynchronous peer-to-peer (p2p) communications, these methods can streamline the overall training process, mitigating common bottlenecks. This includes the Straggler Problem , the synchronization between computations and communications , or bandwidth limitations , potentially due to particular network topologies like a ring graph . However, due to the large number of parameters which are optimized, training DNNs with these methods still critically requires a considerable amount of communication 2, presenting an additional challenge . This work aims to address these challenges by introducing a principled acceleration method for pair-wise communications in peer-to-peer training of DNNs, in particular for cluster computing. While conventional synchronous settings accelerate communications by integrating a Chebychev acceleration followed by Gradient Descent steps , the potential of accelerated asynchronous pair-wise gossip for Deep Learning (DL) remains largely unexplored. Notably, the sophisticated theory of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) offers an analytical framework for the design and study of the convergence of these algorithms . We introduce a novel algorithm A2​CiD2superscriptA2superscriptCiD2\\textbf{A}^{2}\\textbf{CiD}^{2} (standing for Accelerating Asynchronous Communication in Decentralized Deep Learning) that requires minimal overhead and effectively decouples communications and computations, accelerating pair-wise communications via a provable, accelerated, randomized gossip procedure based on continuous momentum (i.e., a mixing ODE) and time  . We emphasize that beyond the aforementioned hardware superiority, stochastic algorithms also allows us to theoretically reach sublinear rates in convex settings , which opens the possibility to further principled accelerations. In practice, our method enables a virtual doubling of the communication rate in challenging network topologies without any additional cost, simply by maintaining a local momentum variable in each worker (see Fig. 1). Our key contributions are as follows: (1) We extend the continuized framework  to the non-convex setting, in order to obtain a neat framework to describe asynchronous decentralized DL training. (2) This framework allows us to refine the analysis of a baseline asynchronous decentralized optimization algorithm. (3) We propose a novel and simple continuized momentum which allows to significantly improve communication efficiency in challenging settings, which we name A2​CiD2superscriptA2superscriptCiD2\\textbf{A}^{2}\\textbf{CiD}^{2}. (4) We demonstrate that our method effectively minimizes the gap between centralized settings in environments hosting up to 64 asynchronous GPUs. (5) Our code is implemented in Pytorch , remove locks put on previous asynchronous implementations by circumventing their deadlocks, and can be found in an open-source repository: https://github.com/AdelNabli/ACiD. This paper is structured as follows: Sec. 3.1 outlines our model for asynchronous decentralized learning, while Sec. 3.2 discusses the training dynamic used to optimize our Deep models. Sec. 3.4 offers a comprehensive theoretical analysis of our method, which is validated empirically in Sec. 4.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: and algorithms rely heavily on high synchronicity in machine computations and near-instantaneous communication in high-bandwidth networks, favoring the adoption of centralized algorithms [ref]7.
