      "content": "Paper Title: Eigenstripping, Spectral Decay, and Edge-Expansion on Posets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHigher order random walks were first introduced in 2016 by Kaufman and Mass . Their spectral structure was later elucidated in a series of works by Kaufman and Oppenheim , DDFH [ref]3, Alev, Jeronimo, and Tulsiani 4, Alev and Lau [ref]4, and finally BHKL 5. With the exception of DDFH (who only worked with approximate eigenvectors without analyzing the true spectrum), all of these works focused on hypergraphs rather than general posets. Our spectral stripping theorem for eposets essentially follows from combining eposet machinery developed by DDFH with our improved variant of BHKL‚Äôs general spectral stripping theorem. Higher order random walks have also seen an impressive number of applications in recent years, frequently closely tied to analysis of their spectral structure. This has included breakthrough works on approximate sampling  [ref]4     0 1 2 3, CSP-approximation 4 5, error-correcting codes 6 7, and agreement testing 8 9 0. In this vein, our work is most closely related to that of Bafna, Barak, Kothari, Schramm, and Steurer , and BHKL 5, who used the spectral and combinatorial structure of HD-walks to build new algorithms for unique games. As previously discussed, the generalized analysis in this paper also lends itself to the algorithmic techniques developed in those works, but we do not know of any interesting examples beyond those covered in BHKL. Most works listed above (and indeed in the high dimensional expansion literature in general) focus only on the setting of hypergraphs. However, recent years have also seen the nascent development and application of expansion beyond this setting  2 3 4 , including the seminal work of DDFH [ref]3 on expanding posets as well as more recent breakthroughs on locally testable and quantum codes 1 2. While DDFH largely viewed eposets as having similar structure (with the exception of the Grassmann), we strengthen the case that different underlying poset architectures exhibit different properties. This complements the recent result of Kaufman and Tessler , who showed that expanding posets with strong regularity conditions such as the Grassmann exhibit more favorable properties with respect to the second eigenvalue. Our results provide a statement of the same flavor looking at the entire spectrum, along with additional separations in more combinatorial settings. We note that a related connection between poset regularity and the approximate spectrum of walks on eposets was independently developed by DDFH in a recent update of their seminal work [ref]3. One of the major motivations behind this work is towards building a more general framework for understanding the structure underlying the Unique Games Conjecture , a major open problem in complexity theory that implies optimal hardness of approximation results for a large swath of combinatorial optimization problems (see e.g.¬†Khot‚Äôs survey ). In 2018, Khot, Minzer, and Safra 5 made a major breakthrough towards the UGC in proving a weaker variant known as the 2-2 Games Conjecture, completing a long line of work in this direction 6 7 8 9  5. The key to the proof lay in a result known as the ‚ÄúGrassmann expansion hypothesis,‚Äù which stated that any non-expanding set in the Grassmann graph Jq‚Äã(d,k,k‚àí1)subscriptùêΩùëûùëëùëòùëò1J_{q}(d,k,k-1) had to be non-trivially concentrated inside a local-structure called ‚Äúzoom-in zoom-outs.‚Äù As noted in the previous section, this result differs from our analysis in two key ways: it lies in the ‚Ñì‚àûsubscript‚Ñì\\ell_{\\infty}-regime, and must be totally independent of dimension. Unfortunately, very little progress has been made towards the UGC since this result. This is in part because KMS‚Äô proof of the Grassmann expansion hypothesis, while a tour de force, is complicated and highly tailored to the exact structure of the Grassmann. To our knowledge, the same proof cannot be used, for instance, to resolve the related ‚Äúshortcode expansion hypotheses‚Äù beyond degree-2, similar conjectures offered by Barak, Kothari, and Steurer 9 in an effort to push beyond hardness of 2-2 Games. Just as the ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2}-regime analysis of DDFH and BHKL recently lead to a dimension independent bound in the ‚Ñì‚àûsubscript‚Ñì\\ell_{\\infty}-regime for standard HDX  , we expect the groundwork laid in this paper will be important for proving generalized dimension independent expansion hypotheses in the ‚Ñì‚àûsubscript‚Ñì\\ell_{\\infty}-regime beyond the special case of the Grassmann graphs.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Higher order random walks were first introduced in 2016 by Kaufman and Mass .
