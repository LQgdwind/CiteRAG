Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Pose-driven Attention-guided Image Generation for Person Re-Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA qualitative comparison of state-of-the-art person pose transfer approaches is shown in\nFigure 10 for the Market-1501 dataset. The condition images, target pose maps, and pose-transferred images for PATN , XingGAN [ref]28, BiGraphGAN [ref]27, SelectionGAN  and our proposed method are shown from left to right in Figure 10. In PATN , a pose-transfer method is proposed to update the appearance and pose of a person during encoding. XingGAN [ref]28 followed  and introduced a cross-conditioning GAN consisting of shape-guided\nappearance-based generation and appearance-guided shape-based generation branches to generate more appearance and shape consistent person images. A co-attention fusion module is also proposed to combine the final appearance and shape features. [ref]27 also extends the approach of [ref]28 and proposed a bipartite graph reasoning GAN to capture the relations between the condition and target pose through an integration and aggregation module. They also introduce an image fusion module to selectively generate the final result as in [ref]28. A multi-channel selection GAN is proposed in  to improve the quality of the final transferred images by attentively selecting the interested intermediate generations. None of the above-mentioned methods progressively recombine the image in the decoding stage and all these methods are limited to the image generation task. In contrast, we progressively learn and extract the appearance of the condition image during the encoding stage and at the same time progressively transfer the target pose map into the condition image at the decoding stage, thus the local details and the global shape are preserved and combined progressively. From the qualitative evaluation as shown in Figure 10, our method generates better quality images which are sharper and contain finer details than the pose-transferred images from other state-of-the-art methods.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: of state-of-the-art person pose transfer approaches is shown in\nFigure 10 for the Market-1501 dataset.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
