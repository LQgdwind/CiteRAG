Single Image Dehazing.\nApproaches proposed for single image dehazing are divided into two categories: prior-based methods and learning-based methods.\nTo guarantee the performance, prior-based methods require reasonable assumptions and knowledge on hazy images to obtain accurate estimations about the transmission map and atmospheric light intensity in ASM modeling .\nRepresentative works in this category include     .\nSpecifically,  observed that clear images have higher contrast comparing to the hazy counterparts, and proposed a local contrast maximization method.\nBased on the assumption that image pixels in no-haze patches have intensity values close to zero in at least one color channel,  introduced Dark Channel Prior (DCP).\n presented a linear model adapting color attenuation prior (CAP) to estimate the depth according to the knowledge about the difference between the brightness and the saturation of hazy images.\nPrior-based methods left a permanent mark in single image dehazing but their vulnerability when adapted in variable scenes pivoted the researchers to another direction, the learning-based methods.\nWith the advances in neural networks,       have proposed progressively more powerful models that are capable of directly recovering the clean image from hazy image without estimating the transmission map and depth.\nThe superiority of these methods in removing homogeneous haze is attributed to the availability of large training datasets.\nWhen applied on non-homogeneous haze, they fail to yield comparable results.\nThe limited quantity of existing non-homogeneous haze datasets prevents researchers from adopting simple end-to-end training methods. Learning with Limited Data.\nData is indispensable for all the AI models.\nMany of the models demand a huge dataset for training, but large dataset is not always available.\nTherefore, it urges the researchers to find solutions to accomplish training with limited data.\nIn terms of dehazing, a seemingly straightforward solution to address the issues caused by small non-homogeneous training datasets is composing a relatively large dataset by combining several small datasets all together.\nIn terms of NTIRE2023 challenge , it can be done by augmenting the NH-HAZE datasets (augmented dataset)   with this yearâ€™s data (target dataset).\nSurprisingly, against the common believe that larger dataset is always better in deep learning,  observed that the models perform better when training and testing are conducted on a single dataset (as opposed to the union of all datasets).\nThis observation indicates that the augmented dataset locates in a different domain comparing to the target data.\nDirect aggregation introduces domain shift problem within the dataset.\nThereby,  proposed a testing time training strategy to mitigate the problems, while [ref]37 5 [ref]31 chose to adjust the domains of training data before sending them into the dehazing modules.\nInterestingly, the idea of focusing on improving the dataset rather than the model was introduced by the Data-Centric AI competition .\nData-Centric AI is anticipated to deliver a set of approaches for dataset optimization, thereby enabling deep neural networks to be effectively trained using smaller datasets .\nThe set of proposed techniques ranges widely from simple ones to complex combinations .\nThrough our experiments and qualitative analysis, we find that a too simple approach, such as the gamma correction adopted by [ref]37 5 fails to recover the color accurately.\nNevertheless, a complicated method, like [ref]31 applying domain adaptation to learn a separate neural network to translate the data, is infeasible due to the scarcity and lacking of depth information of the available data.\nIn the next section, we introduce our innovative solution standing out in the NTIRE challenge settings.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: domain comparing to the target data.\nDirect aggregation introduces domain shift problem within the dataset.\nThereby,  proposed a testing time training strategy to mitigate the problems, while [ref]37 5 [ref]31 chose to adjust the domains of training data before sending them into the dehazing modules.\nInterestingly, the idea of focusing on improving the dataset rather than the model was\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
