      "content": "Paper Title: Memory Capacity of Recurrent Neural Networks with Matrix Representation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral successful attempts have been made to explain learning and knowledge representation from the perspective of kernel methods  to dynamical systems viewpoint of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)  [ref]3 . A crucial element in knowledge representation studies of RNNs is that they deal only with finite dimensional vector representations. Thus implementing such neural networks in any architecture would eventually lead to flattening of the input data along any mode, given the input is multi-modal to begin with. It can thus be argued that such a flattening layer can cause loss of structural and spatial information in the input, especially in data arising in natural settings like tri-modal images/sequence of images in longitudinal analysis and higher modal datasets arising in the study of human behavior  . The introduction of richer inductive biases  in the past decade can be seen through recent deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [ref]8, graph-structured representations [ref]9 0, and hierarchy of constituents 1.\nThese methods try to preserve the spatial information by providing fewer constraints on the structure of the representation that the model learns in comparison to a traditional neural network 2. A parallel branch of study, which aims to provide more generalized representations has been introduced by learning higher-order tensors (‚â•2absent2\\geq 2) for multi-modal data to preserve the number of dimensions and the modes at the output 3 4 5. This avoids the potential loss of the spatial coherence 6 in the input data, which can be incurred due to the flattening operation of the higher order tensors and instead processes the multi-modal higher-order tensor input data as it is. A particularly simple use of learning higher-order tensors as representations is in the field of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix (an order 2 tensor) learning, which arises largely in covariance estimation tasks like heteroscedastic multivariate regression 7. In this task, one wishes to learn fundamentally a matrix representation from the input data, thus several extensions of conventional neural networks with vector representations have been introduced to accept matrix inputs as well, such as learning the SPD representations throughout the layers via Mercer‚Äôs kernel 8 to incorporating Riemannian structure of the SPD matrices directly into the layers itself 9. The matrix representation in such proposals is generated through the bilinear map of the form, where ùëºùëº{\\bm{U}}, ùëΩùëΩ{\\bm{V}} and ùë©ùë©{\\bm{B}} are the parameters to be learned of appropriate shapes 0. Do et al.¬† 1, with the help of an aforementioned bilinear map, developed the notion of recurrent matrix networks (RMNs). One of the other benefits of RMNs is the reduction of the number of trainable parameters of the model, as the total parameters depend now linearly on any of the input dimensions. This is in contrast to vector-based conventional neural networks, where the number of parameters grows quadratically with the dimensions of the input vector.\nMatrix neural networks have been successfully used in the past for seemingly difficult real-life tasks like cyclone track prediction 2 and in high-frequency time series analysis 3, where the preservation of spatial data amongst the modes of input proved to be beneficiary as these networks gave better accuracy than their vector counterparts. Neural Turing machines (NTMs)4 are RNN models that combine the fuzzy pattern-matching capabilities of neural networks with the notion of programmable computers. NTMs feature a neural network controller coupled to external memory that interacts with attention mechanisms. NTMs that feature long short-term memory (LSTM) 5 for network controllers can infer simple algorithms that have copying, sorting, and associative recall tasks 4. With their potential benefits, it‚Äôs natural to investigate properties of the matrix representation as generated by the bilinear mapping (Equation 1). Out of the various possible ways in which this can be checked (such as convergence guarantee and training behavior etc.), we particularly focus on the asymptotic memory capacity of the matrix representation by introducing the dynamical systems viewpoint of generic matrix RNNs 1, where we study the evolution of state matrix over time and how much the state at a given time holds information about all previous states. In this paper, we study memory capacity using matrix representation as used by matrix RNNs and extend the notion to NTMs. We investigate if the matrix (second-order tensor) representation of data has a better memory capacity than the vector representation in conventional neural networks. Intuitively, one might argue that such matrix representations might always be better than vector representations in terms of memory capacity. However, we show theoretically that it isn‚Äôt the case under some constraints, even though in general, the capacity might be better than vector representations with a bound that is analogous to the one found for vector representations 6. Hence, it is vital to discover ways to increase the memory capacity, especially given the memory architectures that have been proposed in the past 4 7 8. In order to provide theoretical evaluation, we take into consideration a generic memory-augmented RNN which simply stores a finite amount of past states. We then use theoretical and simulation study to show that it has greater capacity than a simple matrix recurrent architecture without memory; hence, practically showing the increase in memory capacity that is to be expected by addition of a simple memory architecture. However, for more practical purposes, we extend the idea of memory networks 9 to also include the second order tensors, thus introducing the matrix representation stored neural memory for matrix NTM (MatNTM). We report the results of the simulation of the governing equations of memory capacity of matrix RNNs both with and without external memory and also show results of synthetic algorithmic experiments using MatNTMs. We present the rest of the paper as follows. In Section 2, we present various definitions for memory capacity in neural networks. In Section 3, the overarching goal is to capture the effect of external state memory dynamics. Motivated by previous discussions, Section 4 presents the MatNTM with the procedure of memory lookup. Section 5 presents a simulation study in order to quantitatively observe the theoretical properties obtained by the theorems in the prior sections. Section 6 presents experiments and results, which is followed by a discussion in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Several successful attempts have been made to explain learning and knowledge representation from the perspective of kernel methods  to dynamical systems viewpoint of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)  [ref]3 .
