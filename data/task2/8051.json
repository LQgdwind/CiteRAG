      "content": "Paper Title: Style-Preserving Lip Sync via Audio-Aware Style Reference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the increasing application in multimedia, audio-driven lip sync has attracted widespread attention in recent years.\nAccording to the training paradigm, methods for audio-driven lip sync can be categorized into subject-specific and subject-generic.\nSubject-specific methods      need to collect data of the target subject for subject-specific training.\nAlthough they can achieve lip sync conforming to the individual’s speaking style, they can not be generalized to unseen subjects without further training, thus having limited application in the real world.\nRelated to ours, AE-NeRF  observes that similar pronunciations have similar lip shapes. However, instead of aggregating the reference lip shapes to model the speaking style, it aggregates the reference image features to build a robust prior for Neural radiance field (NeRF)  and can not generalize across different subjects without further training. In contrast, subject-generic approaches for lip sync, such as    [ref]7 [ref]8 [ref]9    , have garnered more attention for their ability to infer lip sync for unseen subjects without further training. However, most subject-generic methods [ref]7 [ref]8 [ref]9     neglect to model the speaking styles of individuals in the absence of reference information regarding individual speaking style.\nFor example, Wav2Lip [ref]7 pre-trains a lip synchronization discriminator on a large-scale audio-visual dataset to guide the training of a lip sync generator.\nYet, it can only achieve lip sync matching the general speaking styles learned from the audio-visual dataset.\nSimilarly, IP-LAP [ref]8 proposes a two-stage talking face generation method based on landmark representation, using a transformer-based model to predict lip landmarks from input audio. However, due to the lack of reference information on individual speaking style, it can not generate lip motions that preserve the speaking style well. In this paper, we propose a method that further improves subject-generic methods, achieving more accurate lip sync that better preserves the individual’s speaking style.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: to build a robust prior for Neural radiance field (NeRF)  and can not generalize across different subjects without further training. In contrast, subject-generic approaches for lip sync, such as    [ref]7 [ref]8 [ref]9    , have garnered more attention for their ability to infer lip sync for unseen subjects without further training. However, most subject-generic methods [ref]7 [ref]8 [ref]9\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
