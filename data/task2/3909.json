In the policy evaluation setting, given a deterministic policy π𝜋\\pi, the state-action distribution Zπsuperscript𝑍𝜋Z^{\\pi} and the Bellman operator 𝒯πsuperscript𝒯𝜋\\mathcal{T}^{\\pi} are defined as [ref]17 [ref]21: where 𝒔∈S𝒔𝑆\\bm{s}\\in S, 𝒂∈A𝒂𝐴\\bm{a}\\in A, 𝒑∈P:S×A×S:𝒑𝑃𝑆𝐴𝑆\\bm{p}\\in P:S\\times A\\times S, R𝑅R and 𝜸∈ [ref]1𝜸01\\bm{\\gamma}\\in [ref]1 are the state vector, action vector, transition probability, immediate reward function and discount rate, respectively, in a tuple Markov Decision Process : M​D​P:=⟨S,A,P,R,γ⟩assign𝑀𝐷𝑃𝑆𝐴𝑃𝑅𝛾MDP:=\\left\\langle S,A,P,R,\\gamma\\right\\rangle. π𝜋\\pi is a stationary policy mapping one state s∈S𝑠𝑆s\\in S to one action a∈A𝑎𝐴a\\in A. In the control setting, a distributional Bellman optimality operator 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} with quantile approximation is also proposed in [ref]21: where Zθ∈ZQsubscript𝑍𝜃subscript𝑍𝑄Z_{\\theta}\\in Z_{Q} is a quantile distribution mapping one state-action pair (s,a)𝑠𝑎(s,a) to a uniform probability distribution supported on qisubscript𝑞𝑖q_{i}. ZQsubscript𝑍𝑄Z_{Q} is the space of quantile distribution within N𝑁N supporting quantiles. δzsubscript𝛿𝑧\\delta_{z} denotes a Dirac with z∈ℝ𝑧ℝz\\in\\mathbb{R}. The state-action value Q𝑄Q is then approximated by Qj|K​:=𝐷​1K​∑k=(j−1)​K+1(j−1)​K+Kqk​(s,a)subscript𝑄conditional𝑗𝐾𝐷assign1𝐾superscriptsubscript𝑘𝑗1𝐾1𝑗1𝐾𝐾subscript𝑞𝑘𝑠𝑎Q_{j|K}\\overset{D}{:=}\\frac{1}{K}\\sum\\limits_{k=(j-1)K+1}^{(j-1)K+K}q_{k}(s,a). These quantile approximations -i.e., {qi}subscript𝑞𝑖\\left\\{q_{i}\\right\\} - are operated based on Quantile Huber Loss. The Wasserstein Metric, also known as the Mallows metric, is a true probability metric with no disjoint support issues, and therefore suitable to calculate the metric distance between the target 𝒯π​Zsuperscript𝒯𝜋𝑍\\mathcal{T}^{\\pi}Z and the prediction Z𝑍Z. A contraction is proved in [ref]21 over the Wasserstein Metric: where Wpsubscript𝑊𝑝W_{p}, p∈[1,∞]𝑝1p\\in[1,\\infty] denotes the p𝑝p-Wasserstein distance. d-p:=sup​Wp​(Z1,Z2)assignsubscript𝑑𝑝supsubscript𝑊𝑝subscript𝑍1subscript𝑍2\\overset{-}{d}_{p}:={\\rm{sup}}W_{p}(Z_{1},Z_{2}) denotes the maximal form of the p𝑝p-Wasserstein metrics. ΠW1subscriptΠsubscript𝑊1\\Pi_{W_{1}} is a quantile approximation under the minimal 1-Wasserstein distance W1subscript𝑊1W_{1}. The aim of our proposed QuaDRED is to track the trajectory reference 𝒙m,tsubscript𝒙𝑚𝑡\\bm{x}_{m,t} generated from Kino-JSS  accurately, therefore the immediate reward rt+1subscript𝑟𝑡1r_{t+1} is defined as: where H1subscript𝐻1H_{1} and H2subscript𝐻2H_{2} are positive definite matrices. Then we use DDPG architecture  for the continuous and high-dimensional disturbance estimation.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: We consider a distributional Bellman equation [ref]17, the aim of which is different from traditional RL, i.e., maximizing the expectation of value-action function Q𝑄Q.
