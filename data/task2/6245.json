Much literature has also devoted to improving the efficiency of the attention computation through different approximation techniques.\nIn the related works addressing the attention mechanism,\nReformer [ref]34 uses locally-sensitive hashing for sparse approximation.\nPerformer  approximates self-attention matrix with random features. Linformer  considers low-rank approximation with the help of random projections.\nNyströmformer  utilizes the Nyström method by down sampling the queries and keys in the attention matrix.  incorporates sparsity prior on attention.\nThese works pose the focus on reducing the computation of the attention kernel matrix from the canonical self-attention.\nHence, these works all address how to solve the problem in the dual form involving the kernel matrix, while we work in a significantly different way, that is, in the primal form.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: the kernel interpretation on the attention matrix has been shed light on.\nFourierFormer  treats the canonical self-attention as non-parametric regression with methodologies for symmetric kernels.\n[ref]18 considers relative positional embedding with conditional positive definite kernel.\n treats self-attention operation as support vector regression without considering the asymmetry in the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
