      "content": "Paper Title: UniLog: Deploy One Model and Specialize it for All Log Analysis Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImplementation Details\nWe follow the model design in Section 4. Specifically, we use 3 blocks for both in encoder and decoder. Each block consists of a multi-head self-attention layer, optional encoder-decoder attention layer, and a feed-forward network. We use 4 heads for self-attention, 32 inner dimensions for metrics in the attention layer, a hidden size of 128 for transformer blocks, and an output dimension of 512 for FFN. We apply Dropout with 0.3 probability in the model for regularization. Unlike This result modern network designed for NLP tasks, our model‚Äôs size is four numbers of magnitude smaller since the scale of the public dataset for log analysis is much smaller than those for NLP tasks. This enables us to achieve good performance for log analysis tasks without the overwhelming number of parameters. All experiments are done on NVIDIA V100 GPUs 32 GB memory with Python 3.5 and Pytorch 1.3. We use NVIDIA Apex framework for distributed training. We use a batch size of 128, and trained with AdamW . We use 180 as the maximum length of log sequence and pretrained with 21‚Äã6=65,536superscript216655362^{1}6=65,536 step. We set the initial learning rate as 5e-4 without learning rate warm-up stage and use exponential learning rate decays. We fine-tuned all tasks for 211=2048superscript21120482^{11}=2048 steps to prevent over-fitting.\n\n\nDatasets. We use the BGL , HDFS , HPC , ZooKeeper , Proxifier , Hadoop  and Switch [ref]4 to conduct our experiments. We use the dataset split strategy from the prior works for fair comparison. For anomaly detection, failure prediction, summarization and compression we follows the Loganomaly¬†, PreFix¬†[ref]4, LogSummary¬†[ref]6, and LogParse¬†[ref]5, respectively. For the pretrained dataset, We utilize all log datasets mentioned above to pretrain UniLog, except test data which we used for evaluation.\n\n\nEvaluation Metrics. For anomaly detection, summarization, and failure prediction, A method‚Äôs capability is usually assessed by four metrics that have intuitive interpretation, i.e., precision, recall, and F1 score, and thus we use these metrics to evaluate each method. For log compression, we use compression rate C=size of compressed logssize of original logsùê∂size of compressed logssize of original logsC=\\frac{\\textit{size of compressed logs}}{\\textit{size of original logs}}, which indicates the model‚Äôs ability to store the same amount of logs with the number of storage space.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: rate decays.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
