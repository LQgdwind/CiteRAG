      "content": "Paper Title: Correspondence and Inverse Correspondence for Input/Output Logic and Region-Based Theories of Space\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInput/output logic  has been introduced as a formal framework for studying the interaction between logical inferences and other agency-related relations between formulas, encoding e.g. conditional obligations, goals, ideals, preferences, actions, and beliefs, and has been applied not only in the context of the formalization of normative systems in philosophical logic and AI , but also in connection and combination with a very diverse range of issues, also relevant to present-day AI, spanning from formal argumentation  [ref]15 to causal reasoning , and non-monotonic reasoning . In most of these research lines, and in fact, since its inception, the issue of establishing connections between the various forms of outputs associated with normative systems and modal logic formalisms, and especially with deontic logic, has been deemed worth being pursued, since the existence of this connection would grant access to a number of techniques and results, both model-theoretic  and proof-theoretic (e.g. tableaux, decidability results, proof-search ), which can shed light on the computational behaviour and performances of input/output logic. In particular, modal characterizations of input/output logic would allow for the powerful and flexible LogiKEy methodology  to be available for the development and experimentation with ethical reasoners and normative theories, based on a semantic embedding of deontic logic within (decidable fragments of) higher-order logic (HOL). Modal characterizations of two of the four original types of outputs have been achieved by syntactic means since the inception of the input/output framework [45, Sections 4.3 and 5.5], and were used to obtain a faithful semantic embedding of the corresponding input/output logics into classical higher order logic, which allowed for their implementation into Isabelle/HOL . More recently, the modal embeddings of the original outputs, together with those obtained via semantic interpretation in the context of the neighbouring setting of causal reasoning , have been used to design proof-search oriented proof-calculi for various input/output logics and causal reasoning [ref]17. The present paper is the prosecution of a line of investigation, initiated in 7 and continued in 9 8, aimed at establishing systematic translations and algorithmically generating modal characterization of classes of outputs on classes of propositional logic settings. The methodology adopted in this line of research pivots on the recent introduction of subordination algebras and related structures as a semantic environment for input/output logic 7. Subordination algebras  and related structures such as pre-contact algebras 2 and quasi-modal algebras   have been introduced in the context of a point-free approach to the region-based theories of discrete spaces, and have mainly been investigated with algebraic and duality-theoretic methods: for instance, the link established between subordination algebras and certain Boolean algebras with operators 1 has made it possible to endow various modal languages with a semantics based on subordination algebras, and use these languages to modally characterize their properties. In particular, Sahlqvist-type canonicity for modal axioms on subordination algebras has been studied in 0 using topological techniques. Very similar structures to subordination algebras have been introduced by Lindahl and Odelstadt 4 in the context of an algebraic approach for the representation of normative systems; however, the explicit connection with subordination algebras allows access to a systematic link between topological and algebraic insights in establishing general and uniform modal characterization results for classes of input/output logics. Specifically relevant to the present paper, in 1, using algebraic techniques, the canonicity result of 0 was strengthened and captured within the more general notion of canonicity in the context of slanted algebras, which was established using the tools of unified correspondence theory 0 3 4. Slanted algebras are based on general lattices, and encompass variations and generalizations of subordination algebras such as those very recently introduced by Celani in , which are based on distributive lattices, and for which Celani develops duality-theoretic and correspondence-theoretic results for finitely many axioms. In the present paper, we directly build on 8, and generalize the modal characterizations of finitely many conditions on normative and permission systems, as well as on subordination algebras and related structures developed in 8, to those corresponding to the infinite class of clopen-analytic inequalities (cf. Definition 2.11). Conversely, we introduce Kracht formulas (cf. Definition 5.24) as the class of those first order conditions on algebras with subordination, precontact, and dual precontact relations which correspond to clopen-analytic axioms; finally, as an application of these results, we generalize Celani’s dual characterization results between subordination lattices and subordination spaces (cf. [14, Theorem 5.7]) to the environment of spd-algebras based on distributive lattices and the infinite class of inductive Kracht formulas (cf. Definition 7.48). The modal characterizations established in the present paper pave the way to establishing faithful embeddings for infinite classes of input/output logics, and hence to their implementation in LogiKEy, Isabelle/HOL, Lean, or other interactive systems. Moreover, these characterizations modularly apply to a wide class of algebraic settings, corresponding to varieties of normal lattice expansions 6 and their associated logics 3. Hence, the present contributions further develop and strengthen the principled generalization, initiated in 9, of the theory of normative and permission systems from its original setting (namely, classical propositional logic) to the very wide class of selfextensional logics. This class is well known and very well studied in abstract algebraic logic 5 0 9, and includes all the best known and most used logics for computer science and AI, such as modal, intuitionistic, bi-intuitionistic and substructural logics, and logics with weaker form of negation, or no negation althogether, such as those pertaining to the family of equilibrium logic  .\nRelated to this observation, the logical signatures considered in the present paper account both for obligations and various forms of permissions considered as primitive notions, as well as their interaction;111Likewise, in neighbouring settings such as Bochmann’s framework for causal reasoning  , Kracht’s formulas and analytic axioms of suitable signatures can be used to represent relevant forms of interaction between the ‘is the cause of’ and the ‘not prevents’ relationships.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: of normative systems in philosophical logic and AI , but also in connection and combination with a very diverse range of issues, also relevant to present-day AI, spanning from formal argumentation  [ref]15 to causal reasoning , and non-monotonic reasoning .
