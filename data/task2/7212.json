      "content": "Paper Title: Exact Thresholds for Noisy Non-Adaptive Group Testing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLet p𝑝p denote the number of items, k𝑘k the number of defective items, and n𝑛n the number of tests. We consider the standard probabilistic group testing setup in which the defective set S𝑆S is uniform over the (pk)binomial𝑝𝑘p\\choose k subsets of [p]delimited-[]𝑝[p] of cardinality k𝑘k, where [p]:={1,…,p}assigndelimited-[]𝑝1…𝑝[p]:=\\{1,\\dotsc,p\\}. Each test is represented by a length-p𝑝p binary vector X=(X1,…,Xp)𝑋subscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑝X=(X_{1},\\dotsc,X_{p}), with Xj=1subscript𝑋𝑗1X_{j}=1 if item j𝑗j is included in the test, and Xj=0subscript𝑋𝑗0X_{j}=0 otherwise. We adopt the standard symmetric noise model (e.g., see  9), in which the resulting test outcome is given by where Z∼Bernoulli​(ρ)similar-to𝑍Bernoulli𝜌Z\\sim\\mathrm{Bernoulli}(\\rho) for some ρ∈(0,12)𝜌012\\rho\\in\\big{(}0,\\frac{1}{2}\\big{)}, and ⊕direct-sum\\oplus denotes modulo-2 addition.\nWith n𝑛n tests, there are n𝑛n such test vectors X(1),…,X(n)superscript𝑋1…superscript𝑋𝑛X^{(1)},\\dotsc,X^{(n)}, and we represent these via an n×p𝑛𝑝n\\times p matrix 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}. We only consider non-adaptive testing, in which the entire matrix 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} must be specified prior to observing any test results; such designs are often preferred due to allowing the implementation of the tests in parallel. The test outcomes Y(1),…,Y(n)superscript𝑌1…superscript𝑌𝑛Y^{(1)},\\dotsc,Y^{(n)} are represented via a length−n𝑛-n vector 𝐘𝐘\\mathbf{Y}, and we will sometimes use 𝐙𝐙\\mathbf{Z} to denote the corresponding vector of noise variables. We assume independent noise across tests, i.e., Y(1),…,Y(n)superscript𝑌1…superscript𝑌𝑛Y^{(1)},\\dotsc,Y^{(n)} are conditionally independent given 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}. Given the test matrix 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} and the corresponding outcomes 𝐘𝐘\\mathbf{Y}, a decoder forms an estimate S^^𝑆\\widehat{S}, and the error probability is given by Here the probability is taken with respect to the uniformly random defective set, the possibly-randomized tests, and the noise. As was done in prior works such as 9 [ref]17, we consider the goal of attaining Pe→0→subscript𝑃e0P_{\\mathrm{e}}\\to 0 (with as few tests as possible), without seeking a precise convergence rate. We will state our theorems in terms of bounds on n𝑛n, but in our discussions and figures, we will instead use the notion of rate : where k𝑘k and n𝑛n implicitly depend on p𝑝p.\nThus, a higher rate amounts to fewer tests, and the rate is in   [ref]1 since the tests are binary-valued. We focus on the sublinear sparsity regime, in which k=Θ​(pθ)𝑘Θsuperscript𝑝𝜃k=\\Theta(p^{\\theta}) for some sparsity parameter θ∈(0,1)𝜃01\\theta\\in(0,1). While the linear regime k=Θ​(p)𝑘Θ𝑝k=\\Theta(p) is also of interest, there are strong hardness results in this regime showing that even in the noiseless setting, (almost) every item must be tested individually to attain Pe→0→subscript𝑃e0P_{\\mathrm{e}}\\to 0 , or similarly even to attain Pe↛1↛subscript𝑃e1P_{\\mathrm{e}}\\not\\to 1 . Thus, exact recovery is overly stringent for this regime, and one needs to move to other recovery criteria (e.g., approximate recovery ). Finally, we describe the two randomized test designs that we will consider in this paper: Under the Bernoulli design (e..g, see   ), each item is independently placed in each test with probability νk𝜈𝑘\\frac{\\nu}{k} for some ν>0𝜈0\\nu>0. Under the near-constant weight design (e.g., see 9 ), each item is independently placed in Δ=ν​nkΔ𝜈𝑛𝑘\\Delta=\\frac{\\nu n}{k} tests chosen uniformly at random with replacement, for some ν>0𝜈0\\nu>0. (We leave integer rounding implicit, as it does not affect our results.) Since the same test may be chosen multiple times, the weight of each column in 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} may be (slightly) below ΔΔ\\Delta. Below we will outline the existing results regarding these designs, and then state and discuss our new results. Note on notation. In most cases, capital letters (e.g., S𝑆S and 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}) are used for random variables (or random vectors/matrices), and lower-case letters (e.g., s𝑠s and 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}) are used for specific realizations. We use bold/non-bold symbols to distinguish multi-test/single-test quantities; for instance, even though X(i)superscript𝑋𝑖X^{(i)} is a vector, is non-bold because it corresponds to a single test. Asymptotic notation such as O​(⋅)𝑂⋅O(\\cdot) and o​(⋅)𝑜⋅o(\\cdot) is with respect to p→∞→𝑝p\\to\\infty, with quantities such as k𝑘k and n𝑛n implicitly depending on p𝑝p. We will often use the binary entropy function H2​(ρ)=ρ​log⁡1ρ+(1−ρ)​log⁡11−ρsubscript𝐻2𝜌𝜌1𝜌1𝜌11𝜌H_{2}(\\rho)=\\rho\\log\\frac{1}{\\rho}+(1-\\rho)\\log\\frac{1}{1-\\rho}, the binary KL divergence D​(a∥b)=a​log⁡ab+(1−a)​log⁡1−a1−b𝐷conditional𝑎𝑏𝑎𝑎𝑏1𝑎1𝑎1𝑏D(a\\|b)=a\\log\\frac{a}{b}+(1-a)\\log\\frac{1-a}{1-b}, and the shorthand a⋆b=a​b+(1−a)​(1−b)⋆𝑎𝑏𝑎𝑏1𝑎1𝑏a\\star b=ab+(1-a)(1-b). The function log⁡(⋅)⋅\\log(\\cdot) has base e𝑒e, and information quantities are measured in nats (except in our plots, where we convert to bits).\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: the error probability is given by Here the probability is taken with respect to the uniformly random defective set, the possibly-randomized tests, and the noise.
