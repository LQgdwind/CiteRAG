      "content": "Paper Title: MixSyn: Learning Composition and Style for Multi-Source Image Synthesis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImage-based synthesis has been an interesting topic for decades in both computer vision and graphics. Recent generative approaches set this task forth as conditional generation  2 1  [ref]16  , image-to-image translation   6   [ref]11  , or style encoding 7  [ref]20 . The corner stone of these approaches has been learning the mapping between a source and a target image, for modeling specific styles, segments, or domains. Most of those approaches utilize semantic masks to conditionally generate realistic images , to represent diverse inter-domain images [ref]11, and to replace the content or style of specific parts seamlessly . However, all of them operate on given masks of source and target pairs. Some enable sequentially modifying regions with multiple targets, but they need aligned segments with a constant mask. Being able to incorporate style information through normalization parameters accelerated conditional image generation research, which yields higher quality results [ref]20 as the details are retained deeper in the network. However this constraint also increased the dependency on the input semantic masks (sometimes also called maps or compositions). Observing the state of the art in semantic image synthesis, three main limitations restrain the expressive power: (1) generation is restricted to source-target (pairwise) transfer of styles and regions, (2) semantic masks are mostly manually modified and they are neither novel, nor flexible, (3) uncorrelated and unaligned regions are compositionally not coherent. For (1),  intakes per region style images, however they pursue pairwise processing per region. This is a serious limitation amongst most of the semantic image synthesis approaches as the interactions and contributions from multiple sources are dismissed. For (2),  provides a UI for drawing semantic masks. However, the generation is based on the label encoding, and it is not possible to guide the generation with a specific image, sweeping the mask dependency under the hood. For (3), [ref]16 learns mapping and interpolation between masks, however our motivation to transcend pairwise manipulation to multi-source images synthesis poses a different challenge. Moreover, this source-target coupling enables impersonation by deepfakes, which raises serious ethical debates. To overcome these limitations, we jointly learn semantic compositions and styles from multiple images. We tackle this problem by learning to generate fuzzy semantic compositions from input masks and by learning to synthesize novel photorealistic images from these compositions, preserving the style of each input region. Although humans are comfortable editing existing semantic masks, manual assembly of novel masks from scratch is challenging due to (i) non-exact region boundaries, (ii) unassigned pixels, (iii) overlapping regions, and (iv) misalignment. MixSyn takes as input multiple unaligned segments from several source images (i.e., eyes of A, mouth of B, and nose of C), and creates a new coherent image (i.e., a new face) based on the learned semantic maps (Fig. MixSyn: Learning Composition and Style for Multi-Source Image Synthesis1). Our approach learns to generate coherent novel compositions, reducing the dependency on semantic regions and increasing the quality; couples structure and style generation for image synthesis, flexing spatial constraints on the style generation by learned fuzzy masks; and allows combining multiple sources into a photorealistic image, enabling style and structure blending, and disabling impersonation for face generation. We employ two architectures for generating the composition (semantic) and the image (visual), encoding structures and styles of images separately per region. The structure generator (Fig. 2) learns feasible compositions from as-is, random, and real samples. The style generator (Fig. 4) learns to generate realistic images using region-adaptive normalization layers with generated masks. The two generators are trained jointly in order to couple structure and style creation. We also introduce MS block (Fig. 4e) with optional normalization and resampling layers per module. We demonstrate and compare our results to single-source sequential editing and collage-based synthesis approaches in terms of similarity, reconstruction, visual, and generative quality. We train and test MixSyn on several datasets in two domains: faces and buildings, with promising results for extension to others. We conduct ablation studies on our region classes and loss functions. Moreover, we implement several applications of MixSyn, such as edit propagation and combinatorial generative space exploration. The multi-source nature of MixSyn also prevents one-to-one impersonations in face domain, which is a positive step towards privacy concerns 3, causing the shift to synthetic datasets 4.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: Image-based synthesis has been an interesting topic for decades in both computer vision and graphics.
