By default, ACTION is built on the BYOL pipeline [ref]7 which is originally designed for image classification tasks, and for a fair comparison, we also follow the setting in  such as using 2D U-Net [ref]22 as the backbone and non-linear projection heads H𝐻H. The main differences between our proposed ACTION and  [ref]9 are as follows: (1) the addition of a predictor g​(⋅)𝑔⋅g(\\cdot) to the student network to avoid collapsed solutions; (2) the utilization of a slow-moving average of the student network as the teacher network for more semantically compact representations; (3) the use of the output probability rather than logits effectively and semantically constrains the distance between the anatomical features from the imbalanced data (i.e., multi-class label imbalance cases); (4) we propose to contrast the query image features with other random image features at the global and local level, rather than only two augmented versions of the same image features; and (5) we design a novel unsupervised anatomical contrastive loss to provide additional supervision on hard pixels. Let (X,Y)𝑋𝑌(X,Y) be a training dataset including N𝑁N labeled image slices and M𝑀M unlabeled image slices, with training images X={xi}i=1N+M𝑋superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑖1𝑁𝑀X\\!=\\!\\{x_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N+M} and the C𝐶C-class segmentation labels Y={yi}i=1N𝑌superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑖1𝑁Y\\!=\\!\\{y_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}. Our backbone F​(⋅)𝐹⋅F(\\cdot) (2D U-Net) consists of an encoder network E​(⋅)𝐸⋅E(\\cdot) and a decoder network D​(⋅)𝐷⋅D(\\cdot). The training procedure of ACTION includes three stages: (i𝑖i) global contrastive distillation pre-training, (i​i𝑖𝑖ii) local contrastive distillation pre-training, and (i​i​i𝑖𝑖𝑖iii) anatomical contrast fine-tuning. In the first two stages, we use global contrastive distillation to train E𝐸E on unlabeled data to learn global-level features, and use local contrastive distillation to train E𝐸E and D𝐷D on labeled and unlabeled data to learn local-level features . Global Contrastive Distillation Pre-Training  \nWe follow a similar setting in . Given an input query image q∈{xi}i=N+1N+M𝑞superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑁1𝑁𝑀q\\in\\{x_{i}\\}_{i=N+1}^{N+M} with the spatial size h×wℎ𝑤h\\times w, we first apply two different augmentations to obtain qtsubscript𝑞𝑡q_{t} and qssubscript𝑞𝑠q_{s}, and randomly sample a set of augmented images {xj}j=1nsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑥𝑗𝑗1𝑛\\{x_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{n} from a set of unlabeled image slices {xi}i=N+1N+Msuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑁1𝑁𝑀\\{x_{i}\\}_{i=N+1}^{N+M}. We believe that such relaxation enables the model to capture more rich semantic relationships and anatomical features from its neighboring images instead of only learning from the different version of the same query image. We then feed {xj}j=1nsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑥𝑗𝑗1𝑛\\{x_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{n} to the teacher encoder Etsubscript𝐸𝑡E_{t}, and followed by the nonlinear projection head Htgsuperscriptsubscript𝐻𝑡𝑔H_{t}^{g} to generate their projection embeddings {Htg​(Et​(xj))}j=1nsuperscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝐻𝑡𝑔subscript𝐸𝑡subscript𝑥𝑗𝑗1𝑛\\{H_{t}^{g}(E_{t}(x_{j}))\\}_{j=1}^{n} as anchor points, and also feed qtsubscript𝑞𝑡q_{t} and qssubscript𝑞𝑠q_{s} to the teacher and student (i.e., E𝐸E and H𝐻H), creating zt=Htg​(Et​(qt))subscript𝑧𝑡superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑡𝑔subscript𝐸𝑡subscript𝑞𝑡z_{t}=H_{t}^{g}(E_{t}(q_{t})) and zs=Hsg​(Es​(qs))subscript𝑧𝑠superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑠𝑔subscript𝐸𝑠subscript𝑞𝑠z_{s}=H_{s}^{g}(E_{s}(q_{s})). Here we utilize the probabilities after SoftMax instead of the feature embedding: where τtsubscript𝜏𝑡\\tau_{t} is a temperature hyperparameter of the teacher, and sim​(⋅,⋅)sim⋅⋅\\text{sim}(\\cdot,\\cdot) is the cosine similarity. Then inspired by [ref]7, in order to avoid collapsed solutions in an unsupervised scenario, we use a shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) predictor Hpg​(⋅)superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑝𝑔⋅H_{p}^{g}(\\cdot) to obtain the prediction zs∗=Hpg​(zs)superscriptsubscript𝑧𝑠∗superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑝𝑔subscript𝑧𝑠z_{s}^{\\ast}=H_{p}^{g}(z_{s}). Of note, {ai}i=1nsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑎𝑖𝑖1𝑛\\{a_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{n}, ztsubscript𝑧𝑡z_{t}, zssubscript𝑧𝑠z_{s}, zs∗superscriptsubscript𝑧𝑠∗z_{s}^{\\ast} can be generated embedding from a set of randomly chosen augmented images, teacher’s projection embeddings, student’s projection embeddings, and student’s prediction embeddings in either Stage-i𝑖i or i​i𝑖𝑖ii. Therefore, we can calculate the similarity distance between the student’s prediction and the anchor embeddings by converting them to probability distribution. where τssubscript𝜏𝑠\\tau_{s} refers to a temperature hyperparameter of the student. The unsupervised contrastive loss is computed as follows: Local Contrastive Distillation Pre-Training  \nAfter training the teacher’s and student’s encoder to learn global-level image features, we attach the decoders and tune the entire models to perform pixel-level contrastive learning in a semi-supervised manner. The distinction in the training strategy between ours and [ref]9 lies in Stage-i​i𝑖𝑖ii and i​i​i𝑖𝑖𝑖iii: [ref]9 only use labeled data in training, while we use both labeled and unlabeled data in training. Considering the training procedure of Stage-i​i𝑖𝑖ii is similar to Stage-i​i​i𝑖𝑖𝑖iii, we briefly describe it here as illustrated in Figure 2. For the labeled data, we train our model by minimizing the supervised loss (the linear combination of cross-entropy loss and dice loss) in Stage-i​i𝑖𝑖ii and Stage-i​i​i𝑖𝑖𝑖iii. As for the unlabeled input images q𝑞q and {xj}j=1nsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑥𝑗𝑗1𝑛\\{x_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{n}, we first apply two different augmentations to q𝑞q, creating two different versions [qtl,qsl]superscriptsubscript𝑞𝑡𝑙superscriptsubscript𝑞𝑠𝑙[q_{t}^{l},q_{s}^{l}], and then feed them to Ftsubscript𝐹𝑡F_{t} and Fssubscript𝐹𝑠F_{s}, and their output features [ft,fs]subscript𝑓𝑡subscript𝑓𝑠[f_{t},f_{s}] are fed into Htlsuperscriptsubscript𝐻𝑡𝑙H_{t}^{l} and Htlsuperscriptsubscript𝐻𝑡𝑙H_{t}^{l}. The student’s projection embedding is subsequently fed into Hplsuperscriptsubscript𝐻𝑝𝑙H_{p}^{l} to obtain the student’s prediction embedding to enforce the similarity between the teacher and the student under the same loss as Equation 3. We also include the randomly selected images to enforce such similarity because intuitively, it may be beneficial to ensure diversity in the set of sampled examples. It is important to note that ACTION will re-use the well-trained weight of the models Ftsubscript𝐹𝑡F_{t} and Fssubscript𝐹𝑠F_{s} as initialization for Stage-i​i​i𝑖𝑖𝑖iii. Anatomical Contrast Fine-Tuning   Broadly speaking, in medical images, the same tissue types may share similar anatomical information in different patients, but different tissue types often show different class, appearance, and spatial distributions, which can be described as a complicated form of imbalance and uncertainty in real clinical data, as shown in Figure 1. This motivates us to efficiently incorporate more useful features so the representations can be more balanced and better discriminated in such multi-class label imbalanced scenarios. Inspired by , we propose AnCo, a new unsupervised contrastive loss designed at the anatomical level. Specifically, we additionally attach a representation decoder head Hrsubscript𝐻𝑟H_{r} to the student network, parallel to the segmentation head, to decode the multi-layer hidden features by first using multiple up-sampling layers for outputting dense features with the same spatial resolution as the query image and then mapping them into high m𝑚m-dimensional query, positive key, and negative key embeddings: rq,rk+,rk−subscript𝑟𝑞superscriptsubscript𝑟𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑟𝑘r_{q},r_{k}^{+},r_{k}^{-}. The AnCo loss is then defined as: where 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is a set of all available classes in a mini-batch, and τa​nsubscript𝜏𝑎𝑛\\tau_{an} denotes a temperature hyperparameter for AnCo loss. ℛqcsuperscriptsubscriptℛ𝑞𝑐\\mathcal{R}_{q}^{c} and rkc,+superscriptsubscript𝑟𝑘𝑐r_{k}^{c,+} are a set of query embeddings in class c𝑐c and the positive key embedding, which is the mean representation of class c𝑐c, respectively. ℛkcsuperscriptsubscriptℛ𝑘𝑐\\mathcal{R}_{k}^{c} is a set of negative key embeddings which are not in class c𝑐c. Suppose 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} is a set including all pixel coordinates with the same resolution with xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i}, these queries and keys are then defined as: In addition, we note that contrastive learning usually benefits from a large collection of positive and negative pairs, but it is usually bounded by the size of GPU memory. Therefore, we introduce two novel active hard sampling methods. To address the uncertainty on the most challenging pixels among all available classes (i.e., close anatomical or semantic relationship), we non-uniformly sample negative keys based on relative similarity distance between the query class and each negative key class. For each mini-batch, we build a graph G𝐺G to measure the pair-wise class relationship to dynamically update G𝐺G. where G∈ℝ|𝒞|×|𝒞|𝐺superscriptℝ𝒞𝒞G\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{C}|\\times|\\mathcal{C}|}. Note that this process may be hard to allocate more samples. Thus, to learn a more accurate decision boundary, we first apply SoftMax function by normalizing the pair-wise relationships among all negative classes n𝑛n from each query class c𝑐c, yielding a distribution: exp⁡(G​[c,v])/∑n∈𝒞,n≠cexp⁡(G​[c,n])𝐺𝑐𝑣subscriptformulae-sequence𝑛𝒞𝑛𝑐𝐺𝑐𝑛\\exp(G[c,v])/\\sum_{n\\in\\mathcal{C},n\\neq c}\\exp(G[c,n]). Then we adaptively sample negative keys from each class v𝑣v to help learn the corresponding query class c𝑐c. To alleviate the imbalance issue, we sample hard queries based on a defined threshold, to better discriminate the rare classes. The easy and hard queries are computed as follows: where y^qsubscript^𝑦𝑞\\hat{y}_{q} is the predicted confidence of label c𝑐c corresponding to rqsubscript𝑟𝑞r_{q} after SoftMax function, and θssubscript𝜃𝑠\\theta_{s} is the user-defined confidence threshold.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Framework Overview  \nThe workflow of our proposed ACTION is illustrated in Figure 2.
