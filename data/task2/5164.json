Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Game Theoretic Mixed Experts for Combinational Adversarial Machine Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn addition to adversarial machine learning defenses, we also include several novel architectures that have recently achieved state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance in image recognition tasks. These include the Vision Transformer (ViT) [ref]8 and Big Transfer models (BiT) . Both of these types of models utilize pre-training on larger datasets and fine tuning on smaller datasets to achieve high fidelity results. We also test Spiking Neural Network (SNNs) architectures. SNNs are a competitor to artificial neural networks that can be described as a linear time invariant system with a network structure that employs non-differentiable activation functions [ref]37. A major challenge in SNNs has been matching the depth and model complexity of traditional deep learning models. Two approaches have been used to overcome this challenge, the Spiking Element Wise (SEW) ResNet  and transferring weights from existing CNN architectures to SNNs . We experiment with both approaches in our paper. Why we selected it: The set of adversarial examples used to attack one type of architecture (e.g. a ViT) have shown to not be misclassified by other architecture types (e.g. a BiT or SNN)  [ref]37. While certain white-box attacks have been used to break multiple undefended models, it remains an open question if different architectures combined with different defenses can yield better performance.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: we also include several novel architectures that have recently achieved state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance in image recognition tasks.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
