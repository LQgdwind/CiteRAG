      "content": "Paper Title: Eliminating Intermediate Measurements in Space-Bounded Quantum Computation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe briefly recall the definitions of several needed space-bounded quantum complexity classes. We begin by noting that, in many of the previous papers that considered space-bounded quantum computation       [ref]36 , quantum Turing machines were used to define the various complexity classes of interest. Arguably, this is the “natural” model to be used to define these classes. However, as the (equivalent) model of uniformly generated quantum circuits are more familiar to quantum complexity theorists and physicists, we state these definitions using quantum circuits. We emphasize that all of the results in this paper apply to both quantum circuits and quantum TMs. A (unitary) quantum circuit is a sequence of quantum gates, each of which is a member of some fixed set of gates that is universal for quantum computation (e.g., {H,CNOT,T}H,CNOT,T\\{\\text{H,CNOT,T}\\}). We say that a family of quantum circuits {Qw:w∈𝒫}conditional-setsubscript𝑄𝑤𝑤𝒫\\{Q_{w}:w\\in\\mathcal{P}\\} is 𝖣𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤​(s)𝖣𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤𝑠\\mathsf{DSPACE}(s)-uniform if there is a deterministic TM that, on any input w∈𝒫𝑤𝒫w\\in\\mathcal{P}, runs in space O​(s​(|w|))𝑂𝑠𝑤O(s(\\lvert w\\rvert)) (and hence time 2O​(s​(|w|))superscript2𝑂𝑠𝑤2^{O(s(\\lvert w\\rvert))}), and outputs a description of Qwsubscript𝑄𝑤Q_{w}. Consider functions c,k:ℕ→ :𝑐𝑘→ℕ01c,k:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow  and s:ℕ→ℕ:𝑠→ℕℕs:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}, with s​(n)=Ω​(log⁡n)𝑠𝑛Ω𝑛s(n)=\\Omega(\\log n), all of which are computable in 𝖣𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤​(s)𝖣𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤𝑠\\mathsf{DSPACE}(s).

The circuit Qwsubscript𝑄𝑤Q_{w} is applied to hwsubscriptℎ𝑤h_{w} qubits that were initialized in the all-zeros state |0hw⟩delimited-|⟩superscript0subscriptℎ𝑤\\lvert 0^{h_{w}}\\rangle, after which the first qubit is measured in the standard basis. If the result is 111, then we say Qwsubscript𝑄𝑤Q_{w} accepts w𝑤w; if, instead, the result is 00, then we say Qwsubscript𝑄𝑤Q_{w} rejects w𝑤w. We require that the following conditions hold: w∈𝒫1⇒Pr⁡[Qw​ accepts ​w]≥c​(|w|)𝑤subscript𝒫1⇒Prsubscript𝑄𝑤 accepts 𝑤𝑐𝑤w\\in\\mathcal{P}_{1}\\Rightarrow\\Pr[Q_{w}\\text{ accepts }w]\\geq c(\\lvert w\\rvert). w∈𝒫0⇒Pr⁡[Qw​ accepts ​w]≤k​(|w|)𝑤subscript𝒫0⇒Prsubscript𝑄𝑤 accepts 𝑤𝑘𝑤w\\in\\mathcal{P}_{0}\\Rightarrow\\Pr[Q_{w}\\text{ accepts }w]\\leq k(\\lvert w\\rvert).

Note that, in the preceding definitions, Qwsubscript𝑄𝑤Q_{w} has 2O​(s​(|w|))superscript2𝑂𝑠𝑤2^{O(s(\\lvert w\\rvert))} gates (this requirement is forced by the uniformity condition). That is to say, in our definition of quantum space s​(n)𝑠𝑛s(n), we require that the computation also runs in time 2O​(s​(|w|))superscript2𝑂𝑠𝑤2^{O(s(\\lvert w\\rvert))}; see the excellent survey paper by Saks  for a thorough discussion of the desirability of requiring that space-bounded probabilistic computations run in time at most exponential in their space bound, as well as, e.g.,    for discussions of the analogous issue for quantum computations. Note that the particular choice of universal gate set does not affect the definition of 𝖡𝖰𝖴​𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤​(s)subscript𝖡𝖰𝖴𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤𝑠\\mathsf{BQ_{U}SPACE}(s) due to the space-efficient version  of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. Furthermore, the class 𝖡𝖰𝖴​𝖫subscript𝖡𝖰𝖴𝖫\\mathsf{BQ_{U}L} would remain the same if defined as 𝖰𝖴​𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤​(log⁡n)c,ksubscript𝖰𝖴𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤subscript𝑛𝑐𝑘\\mathsf{Q_{U}SPACE}(\\log n)_{c,k} for any c,k𝑐𝑘c,k for which c​(n)=1−1p​o​l​y​(n)𝑐𝑛11𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑛c(n)=1-\\frac{1}{poly(n)}, k​(n)=1p​o​l​y​(n)𝑘𝑛1𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑛k(n)=\\frac{1}{poly(n)}, and ∃q:ℕ→ℕ>0:𝑞→ℕsubscriptℕabsent0\\exists q:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}_{>0}, where q​(n)=p​o​l​y​(n)𝑞𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑛q(n)=poly(n), such that c​(n)−k​(n)≥1q​(n)𝑐𝑛𝑘𝑛1𝑞𝑛c(n)-k(n)\\geq\\frac{1}{q(n)}, ∀nfor-all𝑛\\forall n 7. We next consider general space-bounded quantum computation. Most fundamentally, we wish to define a model of quantum computation that allows intermediate quantum measurements. That is to say, rather than considering a purely unitary quantum computation in which a single measurement is performed at the end of the computation, we now allow measurements to be performed throughout the computation, and for the results of those measurements to be used to control the computation. As we wish for our main result (the fact that unitary and general space-bounded quantum computation are equivalent in power) to be as strong as possible, we wish to define a model of general space-bounded quantum computation that is as powerful as possible. To that end, we will define a space-bounded variant of the general quantum circuit model considered in the classic paper of Aharonov, Kitaev, and Nisan , in which gates are now arbitrary quantum channels. A general quantum circuit on hℎh qubits is a sequence Φ=(Φ1,…,Φt)ΦsubscriptΦ1…subscriptΦ𝑡\\Phi=(\\Phi_{1},\\ldots,\\Phi_{t}) of quantum channels, where each Φj∈Chan⁡(2h)subscriptΦ𝑗Chansuperscript2ℎ\\Phi_{j}\\in\\operatorname{Chan}(2^{h}). By slight abuse of notation, we use ΦΦ\\Phi to denote the element Φt∘⋯∘Φ1∈Chan⁡(2h)subscriptΦ𝑡⋯subscriptΦ1Chansuperscript2ℎ\\Phi_{t}\\circ\\cdots\\circ\\Phi_{1}\\in\\operatorname{Chan}(2^{h}) obtained by composing the individual gates of the circuit in order. We say that a family of general quantum circuits {Φw=(Φw,1,…,Φw,tw):w∈𝒫}conditional-setsubscriptΦ𝑤subscriptΦ𝑤1…subscriptΦ𝑤subscript𝑡𝑤𝑤𝒫\\{\\Phi_{w}=(\\Phi_{w,1},\\ldots,\\Phi_{w,t_{w}}):w\\in\\mathcal{P}\\} is 𝖣𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤​(s)𝖣𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤𝑠\\mathsf{DSPACE}(s)-uniform if there is a deterministic Turing machine that, on any input w∈𝒫𝑤𝒫w\\in\\mathcal{P}, runs in space O​(s​(|w|))𝑂𝑠𝑤O(s(\\lvert w\\rvert)) (and hence time 2O​(s​(|w|))superscript2𝑂𝑠𝑤2^{O(s(\\lvert w\\rvert))}), and outputs a description of ΦwsubscriptΦ𝑤\\Phi_{w}; to be precise, a description of ΦwsubscriptΦ𝑤\\Phi_{w} consists of the entries of each K​(Φw,j)𝐾subscriptΦ𝑤𝑗K(\\Phi_{w,j}), where we require that K​(Φw,j)∈Mat^​(22​h)𝐾subscriptΦ𝑤𝑗^Matsuperscript22ℎK(\\Phi_{w,j})\\in\\widehat{\\operatorname{Mat}}(2^{2h}). The operation of applying a unitary transformation is a special case of a quantum channel, and so the general quantum circuit model extends the unitary quantum circuit model. Moreover, the process of performing any (partial or full) quantum measurement is described by a quantum channel, and the preceding definition allows the results of intermediate measurements to be used to control which operations are applied at later stages of the computation (this can be accomplished by using a subset of the qubits as classical bits to store the results of earlier measurements, thereby making these results available to gates that appear later in the computation). It is necessary to establish some reasonable restriction on the complexity of computing a description of each gate of the circuit, as we do not wish to unreasonably increase the power of the model by allowing, for example, non-computable numbers to be used in defining each gate (see, e.g.,    [ref]37 for further discussion of this issue). We note that this general quantum circuit model is equivalent to the space-bounded (general) quantum Turing machine model of Watrous . We also note that the results of this paper would apply to any “reasonable” variant of space-bounded quantum computation that is classically controlled, which includes all of the “standard” variants that have been considered (e.g.,    [ref]36). We refer the reader to [32, Section 2] for a thorough discussion of the various models of space-bounded quantum computation, and, in particular, of the reasonableness of requiring classical control. Consider functions c,k:ℕ→ :𝑐𝑘→ℕ01c,k:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow  and s:ℕ→ℕ:𝑠→ℕℕs:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}, with s​(n)=Ω​(log⁡n)𝑠𝑛Ω𝑛s(n)=\\Omega(\\log n), all of which are computable in 𝖣𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤​(s)𝖣𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤𝑠\\mathsf{DSPACE}(s).

Arguably, this is the “natural” model to be used to define these classes. However, as the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. Generate exactly 40 titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning."
