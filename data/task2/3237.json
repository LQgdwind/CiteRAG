      "content": "Paper Title: Evaluating the Robustness of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Policies in a Multi-agent Urban Driving Environment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO): PPO  is a DRL algorithm, which also serves as one of the extensions to the policy gradient (PG) algorithms. Vanilla PG faces the problem of high gradient variance, and therefore PPO solves it by adding constraints like clipped surrogate objective and the KL penalty coefficient. Such improvements made PPO a very easy choice in the domain of DRL over the past few years. In terms of vision-based AD, the authors in [ref]6 use PPO as an RL algorithm to train a driving policy using synthetic simulated RGB images. The trained policy is transferred to real-world testing experiments for analyzing the perception and control perspective of the AC. Another authors in  uses PPO for proposing a road detecting algorithm in an urban driving environment. They carry out experiments in a Udacity racing game simulator  as well as in a small OpenAI gym carracing-v0 environment . Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C): A3C [ref]26 is a well-known gradient descent-based RL algorithm. Following the on-policy technique, it focuses on using two neural networks - actor and critic. An actor is responsible for making actions while the critic aims for learning a value function. A3C takes this approach by keeping a global critic model while making multiple actor models for parallel training. A3C has been used in  for training an AC policy in a virtual environment that can work in a real-world situation as well. By using synthetic images as an input, the policy learns to drive in an urban scenario using the proposed DRL method. Another work by the authors in [ref]7 also uses A3C by combining RL with image semantic segmentation to train an AC driving policy. Using the TORCS  racing simulator, their goal is to lower the gap between virtual and real models while training an RL agent. A3C is also used in  where the authors created an end-to-end driving approach without detailed perception tasks on input images. Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architecture (IMPALA): IMPALA  uses an actor-critic technique, but with the twist of decoupling actors. Following a V-trace off-policy approach, IMPALA’s main objective is to scale up the DRL training capability by adding multiple independent actors. The actors, in this case, are meant to generate experience trajectories for the policy to learn, while the learner tries to optimize not only the policy but also the value function. An author in  proposes a multi-agent urban driving framework in which one can train more than one AC. Using IMPALA, the author performs training on connected AC policy within the CARLA simulator. Deep Q Networks (DQN): DQN  falls into the category of value-based methods, where the goal is to learn the policy function by going through the optimal action-value function. DQN uses off-policy and temporal differences (TD) to learn state-action pairs by collecting episodes as experience replay. Using the episodic data, samples from the replay memory are used in order to learn Q-values, as a neural network function approximation. DQN is one of the foundation models in the upbringing of DRL and there are many improved versions of DQN implemented by overcoming the existing flaws. DQN is used in  for training an AC in a Unity-based urban driving simulator. The authors use cameras and lasers as their input sensors for training the driving policies. Another work in  uses DQN for first training a driving agent in simulation to test its navigation capabilities in both simulated and real-world driving situations. DQN is also utilized in  for learning to steer a vehicle within a realistic physics simulator. Given the camera input feeds, their DQN-based agent is aiming for following lanes with minimal offroad steering errors.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: clipped surrogate objective and the KL penalty coefficient.
