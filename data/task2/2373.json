Let 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} be an instance with domain I𝐼I,\nlet 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} be a constraint language with domain S𝑆S, and let k𝑘k be a\npositive integer. A mapping f:X→S:𝑓→𝑋𝑆f:X\\rightarrow S with X⊆I𝑋𝐼X\\subseteq I is\na partial homomorphism from 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} to 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} if it is an homomorphism from 𝐈|Xevaluated-at𝐈𝑋\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}{|_{X}}\nto 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}. A  k𝑘k-strategy on 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} and 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}\n is any nonempty collection ℋℋ\\mathscr{H} of partial\nhomomorphisms from 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} to 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} such that: the family ℋℋ\\mathscr{H} it is closed under restrictions, i.e.,\nfor every hℎh in ℋℋ\\mathscr{H} and every X⊆dom⁡(h)𝑋domℎX\\subseteq\\operatorname{dom}(h), the\nrestriction h|Xevaluated-atℎ𝑋h|_{X} of hℎh to X𝑋X is in ℋℋ\\mathscr{H}, the family ℋℋ\\mathscr{H} has the extension property up to k𝑘k,\ni.e., for every hℎh in ℋℋ\\mathscr{H} with |dom⁡(h)|<kdomℎ𝑘|\\operatorname{dom}(h)|<k and\nevery x∈I∖dom⁡(h)𝑥𝐼domℎx\\in I\\setminus\\operatorname{dom}(h), there exists f𝑓f in ℋℋ\\mathscr{H}\nsuch that h⊆fℎ𝑓h\\subseteq f and dom⁡(f)=dom⁡(h)∪{x}dom𝑓domℎ𝑥\\operatorname{dom}(f)=\\operatorname{dom}(h)\\cup\\{x\\}. We write 𝐈≤k𝐒subscript𝑘𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\\leq_{k}\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} to denote the statement that there exists\na k𝑘k-strategy on 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} and 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}. It follows directly from\nthe definitions that, if 𝐈→𝐒→𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\\to\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}, then 𝐈≤k𝐒subscript𝑘𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\\leq_{k}\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}. Indeed,\nif hℎh is a homomorphism from 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} to 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}, then the\ncollection ℋ={h|X∣X⊆I,|X|≤k}ℋformulae-sequenceconditionalevaluated-atℎ𝑋𝑋𝐼𝑋𝑘\\mathscr{H}=\\{h|_{X}\\mid X\\subseteq I,|X|\\leq k\\} is\na k𝑘k-strategy on 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} and 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}. There is an algorithm that, given (𝐈,𝐒,k)𝐈𝐒𝑘(\\operatorname{{\\bf I}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},k) as input, decides\nwhether there exists a k𝑘k-strategy and does so in time polynomial\nin (|I|+|S|)ksuperscript𝐼𝑆𝑘(|I|+|S|)^{k}. This algorithm, usually called\nthe (k−1)𝑘1(k-1)-consistency algorithm, starts by placing in ℋℋ\\mathscr{H}\nall partial homomorphisms from 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} to 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} with domain size at\nmost k𝑘k and repeatedly removes from ℋℋ\\mathscr{H} those hℎh that\nfalsify any one of the two conditions in the definition\nof k𝑘k-strategy. The algorithm stops when it reaches a fixed-point. If\nthe fixed-point obtained is non-empty, then it necessarily is\na k𝑘k-strategy. Otherwise, it can be safely concluded that\nno k𝑘k-strategy exists. Since, as seen above, 𝐈→𝐒→𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\\to\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}\nimplies 𝐈≤k𝐒subscript𝑘𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\\leq_{k}\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}, one could use the consistency algorithm as a\npartial-check to decide whether 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} is homomorphic to 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}. This\nis the basis of the width heuristic for CSP which, following\n, we now extend to PCSPs. Let (𝐒,𝐓)𝐒𝐓(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) be a PCSP template of signature σ𝜎\\sigma; i.e., 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}\nand 𝐓𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf T}} are σ𝜎\\sigma-structures such that 𝐒→𝐓→𝐒𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}\\to\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}.\nLet k=k​(n)𝑘𝑘𝑛k=k(n) be an integer function. We say that PCSP⁡(𝐒,𝐓)PCSP𝐒𝐓\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}})\nis solvable in width k​(n)𝑘𝑛k(n), or that the template (𝐒,𝐓)𝐒𝐓(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}})\nhas width k​(n)𝑘𝑛k(n), if for every σ𝜎\\sigma-structure instance 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\nwith n𝑛n elements it holds that 𝐈≤k​(n)𝐒subscript𝑘𝑛𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\\leq_{k(n)}\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}\nimplies 𝐈→𝐓→𝐈𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\\to\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}. Note that this generalizes the definition of\nwidth for CSPs since, whenever PCSP⁡(𝐒,𝐒)=CSP⁡(𝐒)PCSP𝐒𝐒CSP𝐒\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}})=\\operatorname{CSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}) is\nsolvable in width k​(n)𝑘𝑛k(n), the condition 𝐈≤k​(n)𝐒subscript𝑘𝑛𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\\leq_{k(n)}\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} is\nnecessary and sufficient for 𝐈→𝐒→𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\\to\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}. We note that\nevery PCSP⁡(𝐒,𝐓)PCSP𝐒𝐓\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) is solvable in width at most k​(n)𝑘𝑛k(n)\nfor k​(n)=n𝑘𝑛𝑛k(n)=n. Whenever it is solvable in width k​(n)𝑘𝑛k(n) for\nsome k​(n)=O​(1)𝑘𝑛𝑂1k(n)=O(1), we say that PCSP⁡(𝐒,𝐓)PCSP𝐒𝐓\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) is solvable in\nbounded width, or that (𝐒,𝐓)𝐒𝐓(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) has bounded\nwidth. Whenever it is solvable in width k​(n)𝑘𝑛k(n) for some k​(n)=o​(n)𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑛k(n)=o(n),\nwe say that PCSP⁡(𝐒,𝐓)PCSP𝐒𝐓\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) is solvable in sublinear width, or\nthat (𝐒,𝐓)𝐒𝐓(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) has sublinear width. In the particular case of CSPs, the strength of bounded width is well\nunderstood. The breakthrough of Barto and Kozik , in\ncombination with , yields the following\ncharacterization of CSP templates of bounded width:  \nFor every structure 𝐓𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf T}} the following are equivalent: 𝐓𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf T}} has bounded width, 𝐓𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf T}} has width max⁡(r,3)𝑟3\\max(r,3) where r𝑟r is the maximum arity in 𝐓𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}, Pol⁡(𝐓)Pol𝐓\\operatorname{Pol}(\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) contains an m𝑚m-ary WNU for every integer m≥3𝑚3m\\geq 3. We illustrate Theorem 1 with an example that will\nbecome useful in Section 6. Consider the problem of deciding whether a graph 𝐆𝐆\\operatorname{\\mathbf{G}}\nis 222-colorable, i.e, CSP⁡(𝐊2)CSPsubscript𝐊2\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{K}_{2}). If 𝐆𝐆\\operatorname{\\mathbf{G}} contains a\ncycle a0,a1,…,an=a0subscript𝑎0subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛subscript𝑎0a_{0},a_{1},\\dots,a_{n}=a_{0} of odd length n𝑛n,\nthen there is no k𝑘k-strategy on 𝐆𝐆\\operatorname{\\mathbf{G}} and 𝐊2subscript𝐊2\\operatorname{{\\bf K}}_{2}: an easy\ninductive argument shows that every such strategy would need to\ncontain for every j≥1𝑗1j\\geq 1 a partial homomorphism f𝑓f\nwith domain {a0,aj}subscript𝑎0subscript𝑎𝑗\\{a_{0},a_{j}\\} satisfying f​(a0)=f​(aj)𝑓subscript𝑎0𝑓subscript𝑎𝑗f(a_{0})=f(a_{j})\nif j𝑗j is even and f​(a0)≠f​(aj)𝑓subscript𝑎0𝑓subscript𝑎𝑗f(a_{0})\\neq f(a_{j}) if j𝑗j is odd, which is not\npossible because n𝑛n is odd and an=a0subscript𝑎𝑛subscript𝑎0a_{n}=a_{0}.\nConsequently, 𝐊2subscript𝐊2\\mathbf{K}_{2} has width 333. One can alternatively look at this algebraically and note that, for\nevery integer m≥3𝑚3m\\geq 3, the set Pol⁡(𝐊2)Polsubscript𝐊2\\operatorname{Pol}(\\mathbf{K}_{2}) of polymorphisms\nof 𝐊2subscript𝐊2\\mathbf{K}_{2} contains the function φ:[ref]2m→[ref]2:𝜑→superscriptdelimited-[]2𝑚delimited-[]2\\varphi:[ref]2^{m}\\rightarrow[ref]2\nthat returns the majority of its arguments. These are WNUs and,\ntherefore, by virtue of Theorem 1, it follows also\nthat 𝐊2subscript𝐊2\\mathbf{K}_{2} has width 333. Indeed, it was already observed\nin  that a structure 𝐓𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf T}} has bounded width\nwhenever Pol⁡(𝐓)Pol𝐓\\operatorname{Pol}(\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) contains a majority operation f𝑓f, i.e, an\noperation f:S3→S:𝑓→superscript𝑆3𝑆f:S^{3}\\rightarrow S satisfying Note that the first two identities in (7) alone are the\nWNU identities in (5) for arity 333. Let us now include sublinear width into the picture. It has been known\nthat Theorem 1 can be strengthened to also include\nsublinear width in the characterization. Concretely,\nitems 1–3 are also equivalent to item 0 below: 𝐓𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf T}} has sublinear width. On one hand, clearly 1 implies 0. On the other hand, it\nis known that, if 3 fails, then 𝐓𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf T}} is able to\nsimulate the constraint language corresponding to systems of\nequations over a non-trivial finite Abelian group, for which linear\nwidth lower bounds are known (see,\ne.g., [ref]3). Thus, 0 implies\n3. As it turns out, this implication will also follow from our\nmain result in Section 4. As in the CSP world, whether a fixed-template PCSP is solvable in\nbounded width is controlled by the polymorphisms of the\ntemplate . \nLet (𝐒1,𝐓1)subscript𝐒1subscript𝐓1(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}_{1},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}_{1}) and (𝐒2,𝐓2)subscript𝐒2subscript𝐓2(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}_{2},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}_{2}) be two PCSP templates such\nthat there exists a minor homomorphism from Pol⁡(𝐒1,𝐓1)Polsubscript𝐒1subscript𝐓1\\operatorname{Pol}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}_{1},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}_{1})\nto Pol⁡(𝐒2,𝐓2)Polsubscript𝐒2subscript𝐓2\\operatorname{Pol}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}_{2},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}_{2}). Then, the following statements hold: If (𝐒1,𝐓1)subscript𝐒1subscript𝐓1(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}_{1},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}_{1}) has bounded width, then so does (𝐒2,𝐓2)subscript𝐒2subscript𝐓2(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}_{2},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}_{2}). If (𝐒1,𝐓1)subscript𝐒1subscript𝐓1(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}_{1},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}_{1}) has sublinear width, then so does (𝐒2,𝐓2)subscript𝐒2subscript𝐓2(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}_{2},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}_{2}). We note here that, although not explicitly addressed in ,\nthe proof for the bounded width statement in\nTheorem 2 works also for sublinear width; i.e., the\nproof of Item 1 in Theorem 2 also proves\nItem 2.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: algebraically and note that, for\nevery integer m≥3𝑚3m\\geq 3, the set Pol⁡(𝐊2)Polsubscript𝐊2\\operatorname{Pol}(\\mathbf{K}_{2}) of polymorphisms\nof 𝐊2subscript𝐊2\\mathbf{K}_{2} contains the function φ:[ref]2m→[ref]2:𝜑→superscriptdelimited-[]2𝑚delimited-[]2\\varphi:[ref]2^{m}\\rightarrow[ref]2\nthat returns the majority of its arguments.
