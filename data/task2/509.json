      "content": "Paper Title: SAMBA: Safe Model-Based & Active Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn active learning  , an agent chooses points to sample/query that best improve learning or model updates. This is often performed by optimising an acquisition function, which gives some quantification of how much a model would improve if a given data point were queried, e.g., points where the model has high entropy or where variance can be most reduced. Active learning with GPs has been studied in the static case, where points can be selected at will (see, e.g.,  ). In the context of dynamical systems, however, added complications arise as one is not always able to directly drive the system into a desired state. Recent work has attempted to resolve this problem, e.g., in [ref]10 and [ref]44, receding horizon optimisation is used to iteratively update a model, and in [ref]10, actions are favoured that maximise the sum of differential entropy terms at each point in the mean trajectory predicted to occur by those actions. Moreover, in [ref]44, a sum of variance terms is optimised to improve Bayesian linear regression. Again, for computational tractability, the predicted mean of states is used as propagating state distributions in the model is difficult. Different to our paper, neither of these works deal with safety, nor do they have additional objectives to maximise/minimise avoiding a bi-objective formulation. In  a GP model that is used for MPC is updated by greedily selecting points which maximise information gain, i.e., reduction in entropy, as is done in . Only very recently, the authors in [ref]6 proposed an active learning approach coupled with MBRL. Similar to SAMBA, they use an adaptive convex combination of objectives, however their exploration metric is based on reward variance computed from a (finite) collection of models increasing the burden on practitioners who now need to predefine the collection of dynamics. They do not use GPs as we do, and do not consider safety. Compared to [ref]6, we believe SAMBA is more flexible supporting model-learning from scratch and enabling principled exploration coupled with safety consideration. Further afield from our work, active learning has been recently studied in the context of GP time-series in , and for pure exploration in , which uses a finite collection of models. Our (semi-)metrics generalise the above to consider safe-regions and future information trade-off as we detail in Section 3.2.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: of dynamical systems, however, added complications arise as one is not always able to directly drive the system into a desired state.
