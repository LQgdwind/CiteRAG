      "content": "Paper Title: Hybrid Pooling and Convolutional Network for Improving Accuracy and Training Convergence Speed in Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject detection based on deep learning. The field of object detection has been developing for over 20 years. As a crucial aspect of computer vision, it significantly impacts various domains, such as pedestrian detection, facial recognition, video analysis, and medical diagnosis. With the advancements in deep learning, object detection algorithms have greatly improved. Currently, deep-learning-based object detection algorithms can be categorized into one-stage   and two-stage object detection algorithms [ref]10 [ref]24. Moreover, there have been recent developments in object detection algorithms based on deep learning, including transformer-based methods   and voxel-based methods 6 .\nOur HPC-Net effectively enhances object detection accuracy, generalization, and robustness by increasing model depth and incorporating reasonable pooling steps as transitions between layers and modules. Object detection based on R-CNN. R-CNN follows the principle of first generating region proposals from the original image, then resizing these proposals to a fixed size, classifying and scoring them, and finally applying NMS  and other techniques to filter out high-scoring bounding boxes for each category. Earlier methods, such as Fast R-CNN [ref]10, significantly reduced computational complexity by utilizing the spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) principle . Faster R-CNN [ref]24 further improved efficiency by introducing the region proposal network (RPN). PV-RCNN  combines point clouds with voxels to enhance accuracy. Recently, R-CNN-based methods have gained increasing attention in object detection. Our HPC-Net is currently a leading approach in R-CNN-based object detection. Voxel-based object detection. Voxel-based methods, starting with Apple’s VoxelNet 6, organize unordered point cloud data into ordered high-dimensional feature data by converting point clouds into 3D voxel representations with consistent specifications. SECOND  and PV-RCNN  build upon this idea. Voxel R-CNN  proposes a two-stage detection framework consisting of a 3D backbone network, a 2D bird’s-eye view proposal network, and detection heads, which has become a new mainstream approach, including methods like SFD , TED , and VirConv . Our method is also based on the Voxel R-CNN  framework and surpasses previous models. Incorporating pooling methods for object detection. Earlier approaches, such as PV-RCNN , introduced ROI grid pooling, followed by Voxel R-CNN  incorporating Voxel RoI Pooling, and more recently, TED  introduced Transformation-Equivariant BEV Pooling based on maximum pooling and bilinear interpolation. However, these pooling methods are still based on maximum or average pooling and lack flexibility, leading to issues such as limited generalizability and accuracy. Therefore, we propose a novel pooling method called replaceable pooling. Multimodal 3D object detection. Most state-of-the-art high-precision 3D object detection methods are multimodal, combining information from multiple sensors. Earlier methods, such as MV3D , integrate LiDAR BV (Bird’s Eye View), LiDAR FV (Front View), and RGB Image through a Region-based Fusion Network. 3D-CVF 0 divides multimodal data fusion into two stages, generating stronger Camera-LiDAR joint features in the first stage and aggregating encoded features and Camera-LiDAR joint features in the second stage. SFD  utilizes pseudo point clouds generated by depth completion to address fusion sparsity. 3D Grid-wise Attention Fusion (3D-GAF) is employed to mesh and fuse 3D RoI features in point cloud pairs. Recent methods like TED  and VirConv  utilize PENet  to integrate multimodal information. HPC-Net integrates 3D voxels and 2D BEV images, leveraging a novel feature extraction module called MEFEM. This module increases the receptive field and integrates multi-scale features. Our approach achieves significantly improved accuracy across all modes of the KITTI dataset and effectively addresses the challenge of detecting highly occluded objects with high accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: learning, object detection algorithms have greatly improved.
