These techniques aim to leverage the inherent connections within diverse urban data streams. To better understand the differences in the underlying concepts of data fusion in these studies, we categorize them into four distinct categories, as illustrated in Figure 7.

The core idea is to consolidate raw or processed data features from various sources, forming comprehensive characteristics of studied urban objects. This integration is crucial for enhancing the predictive capabilities of urban models, facilitating complex analyses such as traffic projections and socioeconomic pattern recognition. The distinctive feature of this category lies in directly merging features using methods such as addition, multiplication, concatenation, or graph-based operations. Alignment-based Data Fusion aims to identify a shared feature space or structure among diverse data representations, enabling their alignment or integration. This involves the model learning to transform information from one source to another for semantic consistency. For instance, in tasks merging images and text, the model must align visual features with textual descriptions, often achieved through a multi-modal embedding space  . The widely used attention mechanism  exemplifies alignment-based data fusion, assigning weights to different input parts to prioritize them. In tasks like image captioning, cross-modal attention aligns and weights specific image regions with the textual description   0. Contrast-based Data Fusion employs the contrastive learning framework to enhance feature discriminability at the sample level, contrasting with alignment-based data fusion that focuses on feature-level alignment   2. By training the model to differentiate categories or samples, it identifies key distinguishing features. In urban computing, this involves comparing traffic patterns or environmental variables across different areas, time points, and modalities. The pairing of positive and negative samples enables the model to learn and excel in distinguishing complex urban situations, refining the acuity of computational tools   . Generation-based Data Fusion utilizes deep learning’s creative capacity to generate one urban modality under the condition of other modalities   . In urban computing, this approach proves beneficial for simulating diverse scenarios, such as crafting traffic patterns under various circumstances and assessing urban planning outcomes  . The generative methods involved in urban multi-modal fusion encompass mask modeling, diffusion, and LLM-enhanced techniques.\n\nReference markers found: [308]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]308: width=16em]\n]\n]\n]\n[Alignment-based Data \nFusion (Sec.4.3)\n[Attention-based Alignment \n(Sec.4.3.1)\n[Yin et al. , Zhang et al. , GSNet , \nERNIE-GeoL , Xi et al. , RankETPA , \nYuan et al. , Yan et al.
