      "content": "Paper Title: Multiscale Nonlocal Elasticity: A Distributed Order Fractional Formulation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the past few decades, several theoretical and computational approaches have been proposed to model the multiscale response of complex systems. Based on the underlying physical model, the most established multiscale approaches can be broadly classified into three categories: molecular approaches, local continuum approaches, and nonlocal continuum approaches. The following section is not meant to provide a comprehensive overview of such a broad and complex topic as multiscale mechanics, but it is intended to highlight some key aspects that limit the applications of established computational mechanics methodologies to the present problem of multiscale nonlocal elasticity. The key highlights of the different approaches and the challenges faced by them are summarized in the following: Molecular approaches: resolve the structure at the molecular level which, in turns, allows capturing fine level interactions either at the molecular or higher scales. Typical examples in this category include density functional theory  and molecular dynamics . By simultaneously accounting for the finest material scales and for all molecular interactions, molecular approaches can accurately capture multiscale nonlocal behavior. However, this class of techniques involves a number of degrees of freedom that scales proportionally to the number of particles, hence not making the approach suitable for simulations at the macro scales. Local continuum approaches: leverage the classical (local) elastodynamic theory to simulate and predict the response of complex structures. Typical examples include discrete methods  and asymptotic methods  . Discrete approaches such as, for example, finite element method, finite difference method, and model-order reduction techniques have found good success but are subject to an implicit trade-off between accuracy (directly related to the resolution of the specific discrete method) and computational time. In fact, for media with multiscale inhomogeneities (e.g. porous and fractal media) the discretization process requires fine spatial and temporal resolutions that lead rapidly to unattainable computational resources  . On the other hand, asymptotic methods, that use multiscale expansions of bulk (homogenized) material properties to capture information across scales, are often associated with lower computational costs. However, a major limitation of asymptotic methods follows from their rather complex analytical derivations that are only possible for limited types of structural analysis (and under specific loading conditions) . Finally, note that, irrespective of the nature of the method, the underlying classical continuum mechanics assumptions do not allow the resulting formulation to capture nonlocal effects at any given scale. Nonlocal continuum approaches: extend the previous continuum formulations by introducing the contributions of long-range nonlocal interactions via differ-integral or integral constitutive equations. Depending on whether the nonlocal contributions are modeled using the strain field, the stress field, or the displacement field, the differ-integral approaches can be classified as strain-driven  , stress-driven [ref]25, or displacement-driven  , respectively. Based on the nature of the kernels used to capture the nonlocal interactions, these approaches can be identified as integer-order   [ref]25 (use exponential kernels) or fractional-order     (use power-law kernels typical of fractional calculus) approaches. Another rapidly growing approach to nonlocal mechanics is known as peridynamics ; this is a purely integral method in nature. Discussions on the impact of differ-integral operators compared with purely integral operators are beyond the scope of this study. For more details, the interested reader is referred to  . While existing classes of nonlocal approaches have been able to address a multitude of aspects typical of the response of size-dependent nonlocal structures, the nonlocal effects in these approaches are assumed to be restricted to a specific scale, typically the continuum scale. Consequently, based on the underlying formulation, they can capture only softening or stiffening response but not both simultaneously (a key feature of multiscale effects). Very recently, a few studies   have expanded existing nonlocal approaches to model multiscale effects. However, these latter methods accounted for effects across only two scales and did not provide a general framework to be extended to multiple scales. From the above discussion, it emerges that existing approaches are not theoretically and computationally equipped to provide a comprehensive account of the physical phenomena involved in multiscale nonlocal elasticity. The present study attempts to address this technical gap by leveraging the nonlocal properties and intrinsic multiscale capabilities of distributed order (DO) operators. Distributed order operators are a natural multiscale generalization of the concept of constant order (CO) fractional operators. While a CO fractional operator is a differ-integral operator with a power-law kernel defined at a specific constant order, DO operators integrate the fundamental power-law kernel (typical of CO operators) over an extend range of orders . Given that the fundamental kernel of a CO operator is retained, DO operators automatically inherit their nonlocal properties. It follows that DO operators can naturally capture nonlocal behavior defined at multiple scales. The inherent multiscale and nonlocal (in time and/or space) nature of DO operators has found applications in the modeling of several complex systems such as, for example, viscoelastic systems with multiple relaxation times , anomalous transport processes marked by the presence of multiple temporal and spatial scales , and materials with complex microstructure that evolve with externally applied thermal and/or mechanical loads . A detailed review of the applications of DO fractional calculus (DO-FC) to the analysis of real-world multiscale systems can be found in .\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: whether the nonlocal contributions are modeled using the strain field, the stress field, or the displacement field, the differ-integral approaches can be classified as strain-driven  , stress-driven [ref]25, or displacement-driven  , respectively.
