      "content": "Paper Title: The Seeker’s Dilemma: Realistic Formulation and Benchmarking for Hardware Trojan Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHardware Trojans (HTs) are a serious threat to digital electronics in general and the design and manufacturing of Integrated Circuits (ICs) in particular. An HT is an unwanted modification in the design or manufacturing of an IC such that the chip’s expected behavior is altered. Such modifications mostly follow malicious goals such as denial-of-service or information stealing . Potential impacts of security breaches through HTs have pushed many researchers to look into the methods and algorithms to detect HTs in ICs in the early stages of the design and manufacturing process . The two main approaches are test-time (deploy time) HT detection (the detection of the existence of an HT on an IC) with several methods  and design-time detection (the detection of the presence and location of an HT in a circuit netlist) with a range of methods    [ref]7  . Although many HT detection methods have been proposed in the literature, the field still needs a formal definition of the problem that mirrors the real-world problem of HT detection. In this paper, our goal is to advance the state-of-the-art in HT detection by formally defining the problem of HT insertion/detection in digital ICs as a game between two players. Our comprehensive problem statement is rooted in the Hide&Seek problem on a graph. We call this new formulation “The Seeker’s Dilemma” as it more closely resembles the problem of HT detection from the perspective of real-world manufacturers and distributors of ICs. We take “The Seeker’s Dilemma” approach in creating realistic HT benchmarks to address the shortcomings of existing HT benchmarks. The HT location and size are known to the security researcher in current benchmarks such as  0 1. This enables the defense side to fine-tune their HT detectors to showcase strong HT detection rates. On the contrary, we believe that a standard benchmark should contain several HT-infected and HT-free instances to provide better dataset balance for researchers. Figure 1 shows the difference between existing benchmark approaches and our proposed method.\nNext, we define a generic evaluation methodology for HT detection with “The Seeker’s Dilemma” to help the community fairly evaluate existing and future HT detection methods. To facilitate this, we provide a new benchmark and use it to evaluate three state-of-the-art detectors: HW2VEC  trained with two different training sets, RL_HT_DETECT 2, and DETERRENT [ref]7. Our released HT benchmark, called Seeker1, is available at 3 so researchers can test their tools. We anticipate our realistic problem presentation (“The Seeker’s Dilemma”) will help boost IC security by diversifying HT detection methods. The key here is that it is unlikely that a single holy grail for HT detection will find HTs with a whole range of insertion criteria. Instead, the research community needs to generate diverse approaches to broaden HT detection. Each approach and detection idea (detection strategy) covers a portion of the problem space. The contributions of this work are as follows: We introduce The Seeker’s Dilemma, a formal definition of HT detection similar to finding HTs in real-world scenarios. We propose a comparison flow for HT detection that is an update from legacy HT detection. We introduce Seeker1 which is a benchmark with potentially hidden HTs, to help improve HT detection. We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze the significance of Seeker1 from a Machine Learning (ML) training perspective. The paper is organized as follows. Section II explains the threat model in our flow. Section III describes the existing state-of-the-art HT benchmarks and detection strategies. Section IV introduces the notion of Hide&Seek on a graph and how that problem is related to HT. Section V modifies the above problem to the new problem of “The Seeker’s Dilemma”. Next, Section VI describes the benchmark we have created, a version of “The Seeker’s Dilemma”. Section VII provides results and analysis of our new benchmark with respect to the performance of three state-of-the-art HT detectors. Finally, Section VIII discusses some caveats and constraints of our approach, and Section IX concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: detection of the existence of an HT on an IC) with several methods  and design-time detection (the detection of the presence and location of an HT in a circuit netlist) with a range of methods    [ref]7  .
