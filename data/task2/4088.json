      "content": "Paper Title: Texture Extraction Methods Based Ensembling Framework for Improved Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImage texture analysis plays a vital role in multiple use cases. It has been used in medical imaging , remote sensing , industrial inspection of materials , autonomous vehicles , explosive hazard detection  and other industries. Image texture has numerous definitions which defines unique ways to calculate discrete qualities of texture like smoothness, roughness, uniformity, homogeneity, etc. These methods are based on the concept of repeating patterns in an image [ref]17 . One use of texture analysis is that the Image’s texture classification enables better Image classification. The spatial distribution of pixels from an image is an integral part of texture classification . Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been very successful in capturing the local and global spatial features, which play a key role in texture classification. CNN preserves the relative spatial information with the help of convolution layers and aggregates the spatial information using the pooling layers . Local spatial features assist in recognizing the patterns of a texture. In an image, while classifying the texture, some local patterns are repeated throughout the image . These local features exhibit almost the same characteristics as one another and they are extremely critical in differentiating the textures. The traditional CNN architectures do not exhibit phenomenal results for classifying the textures merely based on the spatial features. The CNN can separate the local features with the aid of convolution layers although these spatial features are aggregated by employing the pooling layer. They make decisions primarily based on the global features rather than focusing on the local features. CNN tends to lose the locally rich features and that’s the major reason behind the under-performance of CNN while identifying textures . To overcome this problem, numerous techniques have been introduced where texture extraction (TE) layers are applied before the fully connected (FC) layers, using which local features are extracted. They are used along with global features. Several techniques such as DEPNet , DeepTEN [ref]32, CLASSNet , FENet [ref]28, etc., have been built based on this strategy. Each of these methodologies focuses on some crucial aspects of texture and is specialized for specific use-cases. Using a Histogram layer  along with CNN produces adequate results, whereas FENet [ref]28 produces the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for some benchmark texture datasets. In this paper, inspired by DEPNet  where the the novelty is an ensemble of GAP and DeepTEN [ref]32 techniques with bi-linear pooling delivering superior results, we propose a method where focused on combining several techniques rather than developing a new one. When various TE processes are combined, we can effortlessly capture the divergent characteristics of a texture in a better manner as each of these processes emphasizes unique aspects of texture. We achieved SOTA results on the major texture datasets by integrating distinct existing approaches i.e., DeepTEN, Histogram, and FAP [ref]32  [ref]28. These three techniques have been used with Global Average Pooling (GAP) in their original papers respectively. In our work, we have ensembled these techniques while removing GAP from each technique and tuning the size of their activation and hyper-parameter values to produce an optimized network with better generalization. By the implementation of this strategy, we achieve superiority over each method individually, since we enable classification of texture with distinct characteristics rather than an architecture focusing on any one major trait of texture.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: defines unique ways to calculate discrete qualities of texture like smoothness, roughness, uniformity, homogeneity, etc. These methods are based on the concept of repeating patterns in an image [ref]17 .
