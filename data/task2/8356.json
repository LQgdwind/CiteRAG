      "content": "Paper Title: Expansion Laws for Forward-Reverse, Forward, and Reverse Bisimilarities via Proved Encodings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA reversible system features two directions of computation. The forward one coincides with the normal way of\ncomputing. The backward one undoes the effects of the forward one so as to return to a consistent state,\ni.e., a state that can be encountered while moving in the forward direction. Reversible computing has\nattracted an increasing interest due to its applications in many areas, including low-power\ncomputing  , program debugging  , robotics , wireless\ncommunications , fault-tolerant systems    , biochemical\nmodeling  , and parallel discrete-event simulation  . Returning to a consistent state is not an easy task to accomplish in a concurrent system, because the undo\nprocedure necessarily starts from the last performed action and this may not be uniquely identifiable due to\nconcurrency. The usually adopted strategy is that an action can be undone provided that all the actions it\nsubsequently caused, if any, have been undone beforehand . In this paper we focus on reversible\nprocess calculi, for which there are two approaches – later shown to be equivalent in  –\nto keep track of executed actions and revert computations in a causality-consistent way. The dynamic approach of   yielded RCCS (R for reversible) and its mobile\nvariants  . RCCS is an extension of CCS  that uses stack-based memories\nattached to processes so as to record executed actions and subprocesses discarded upon choices. A single\ntransition relation is defined, while actions are divided into forward and backward thereby resulting in\nforward and backward transitions. This approach is adequate in the case of very expressive calculi as well\nas programming languages. The static approach of  proposed a general method to reverse calculi, of which CCSK (K for keys)\nand its quantitative variants     are a result. The idea is to retain within the\nprocess syntax all executed actions, which are suitably decorated, and all dynamic operators, which are thus\nmade static. A forward transition relation and a backward transition relation are defined separately. Their\nlabels are actions extended with communication keys so as to know, upon generating backward transitions,\nwhich actions synchronized with each other. This approach is very handy to deal with basic process calculi. A systematic study of compositionality and axiomatization of strong bisimilarity in reversible process\ncalculi has started in , both for nondeterministic processes and for Markovian processes. Then\ncompositionality and axiomatization of weak bisimilarity as well as modal logic characterizations for strong\nand weak bisimilarities have been investigated in [ref]9  for the nondeterministic case. That\nstudy compares the properties of forward-reverse bisimilarity ∼FRBsubscriptsimilar-toFRB\\sim_{\\rm FRB}  with those of\nits two components, i.e., forward bisimilarity ∼FBsubscriptsimilar-toFB\\sim_{\\rm FB}   and reverse bisimilarity\n∼RBsubscriptsimilar-toRB\\sim_{\\rm RB}. The reversible process calculus used in that study is minimal. Similar to , its\nsemantics relies on a single transition relation, where the distinction between going forward or backward in\nthe bisimulation game is made by matching outgoing or incoming transitions respectively. As a consequence,\nsimilar to  executed actions can be decorated uniformly, without having to resort to external\nstack-based memories  or communication keys associated with those actions . A substantial limitation of  [ref]9  is the absence of the parallel composition operator in\nthe calculus, motivated by the need of remaining neutral with respect to interleaving view vs. true\nconcurrency. Unlike forward bisimilarity, as noted in  forward-reverse bisimilarity – and also\nreverse bisimilarity – does not satisfy the expansion law of parallel composition into a nondeterministic\nchoice among all possible action sequencings. In Figure 1 we depict two labeled\ntransition systems respectively representing a process that can perform action a𝑎a in parallel with action\nb𝑏b (a.0¯​∥∅b.0¯a\\,.\\,\\underline{0}\\mathop{\\|_{\\emptyset}}b\\,.\\,\\underline{0} using a CSP-like parallel composition ) and\na process that can perform either a𝑎a followed by b𝑏b or b𝑏b followed by a𝑎a (a.b.0¯+b.a.0¯formulae-sequence𝑎𝑏¯0𝑏𝑎¯0a\\,.\\,b\\,.\\,\\underline{0}+b\\,.\\,a\\,.\\,\\underline{0} with ++ denoting a CCS-like choice ), where a≠b𝑎𝑏a\\neq b and ††{\\dagger}\ndecorates executed actions. The forward bisimulation game yields the usual interleaving setting in which the two top states are related,\nthe two pairs of corresponding intermediate states are related, and the three bottom states are related.\nHowever, the three bottom states are no longer related if we play the reverse bisimulation game, as the\nstate on the left has two differently labeled incoming transitions while either state on the right has only\none. The remaining pairs of states are related by reverse bisimilarity as they have identically labeled\nincoming transitions, whereas they are told apart by forward-reverse bisimilarity due to the failure of the\ninterplay between outgoing and incoming transitions matching. More precisely, any two corresponding\nintermediate states are not forward-reverse bisimilar because their identically labeled outgoing transitions\nreach the aforementioned inequivalent bottom states. In turn, the two initial states are not forward-reverse\nbisimilar because their identically labeled outgoing transitions reach the aforementioned inequivalent\nintermediate states. A new level of complexity thus arises from the introduction of parallel composition. For the sake of completeness, we recall that an interleaving view can be restored by considering computation\npaths (instead of states) like in the back-and-forth bisimilarity of . Besides causality, this\nchoice additionally preserves history, in the sense that backward moves are constrained to take place along\nthe path followed in the forward direction even in the presence of concurrency. For instance, in the labeled\ntransition system on the left, after performing a𝑎a and then b𝑏b it is not possible to undo a𝑎a before b𝑏b\nalthough there are no causality constraints between those two actions. In this paper we add parallel composition and then extend the axiomatizations of the three strong\nbisimilarities examined in  via expansion laws. The usual technique consists of introducing\nnormal forms, in which only action prefix and alternative composition occur, along with expansion laws,\nthrough which occurrences of parallel composition are progressively eliminated. Although this originated in\nthe interleaving setting for forward-only calculi  to identify processes such as a.0¯​∥∅b.0¯a\\,.\\,\\underline{0}\\mathop{\\|_{\\emptyset}}b\\,.\\,\\underline{0} and a.b.0¯+b.a.0¯formulae-sequence𝑎𝑏¯0𝑏𝑎¯0a\\,.\\,b\\,.\\,\\underline{0}+b\\,.\\,a\\,.\\,\\underline{0}, it was\nlater exploited also in the truly concurrent spectrum   to distinguish processes like\nthe aforementioned two. This requires an extension of the syntax that adds suitable discriminating\ninformation within action prefixes. For example: Causal bisimilarity   (corresponding to history-preserving bisimilarity [ref]52):\nevery action is enriched with the set of its causing actions, each of which is expressed as a numeric\nbackward pointer, so that the former process is expanded to <a,∅>.<b,∅>.0¯+<b,∅>.<a,∅>.0¯\\mbox{$<$}a,\\emptyset\\mbox{$>$}\\,.\\,\\mbox{$<$}b,\\emptyset\\mbox{$>$}\\,.\\,\\underline{0}+\\mbox{$<$}b,\\emptyset\\mbox{$>$}\\,.\\,\\mbox{$<$}a,\\emptyset\\mbox{$>$}\\,.\\,\\underline{0} while the latter process becomes <a,∅>.<b,{1}>.0¯+<b,∅>.<a,{1}>.0¯\\mbox{$<$}a,\\emptyset\\mbox{$>$}\\,.\\,\\mbox{$<$}b,\\{1\\}\\mbox{$>$}\\,.\\,\\underline{0}+\\mbox{$<$}b,\\emptyset\\mbox{$>$}\\,.\\,\\mbox{$<$}a,\\{1\\}\\mbox{$>$}\\,.\\,\\underline{0}. Location bisimilarity  (corresponding to local history-preserving\nbisimilarity ): every action is enriched with the name of the location in which it is executed,\nso that the former process is expanded to <a,la>.<b,lb>.0¯+<b,lb>.<a,la>.0¯\\mbox{$<$}a,l_{a}\\mbox{$>$}\\,.\\,\\mbox{$<$}b,l_{b}\\mbox{$>$}\\,.\\,\\underline{0}+\\mbox{$<$}b,l_{b}\\mbox{$>$}\\,.\\,\\mbox{$<$}a,l_{a}\\mbox{$>$}\\,.\\,\\underline{0} while the latter process becomes <a,la>.<b,lalb>.0¯+<b,lb>.<a,lbla>.0¯\\mbox{$<$}a,l_{a}\\mbox{$>$}\\,.\\,\\mbox{$<$}b,l_{a}l_{b}\\mbox{$>$}\\,.\\,\\underline{0}+\\mbox{$<$}b,l_{b}\\mbox{$>$}\\,.\\,\\mbox{$<$}a,l_{b}l_{a}\\mbox{$>$}\\,.\\,\\underline{0}. Pomset bisimilarity : instead of a single action, a prefix may contain the combination of\nseveral independent actions that are executed simultaneously, so that the former process is expanded to a.b.0¯+b.a.0¯+(a​∥b).0¯formulae-sequence𝑎𝑏¯0𝑏𝑎¯0𝑎∥𝑏¯0a\\,.\\,b\\,.\\,\\underline{0}+b\\,.\\,a\\,.\\,\\underline{0}+(a\\mathop{\\|}b)\\,.\\,\\underline{0} while the latter process is\nunchanged. A unifying framework for addressing both interleaving and truly concurrent semantics along with their\nexpansion laws was developed in . The idea is to label every transition with a proof\nterm  , which is an action preceded by the operators in the scope of which the action\noccurs. The semantics of interest then drives an observation function that maps proof terms to the required\nobservations. In the interleaving case proof terms are reduced to the actions they contain, while in the\ntruly concurrent case they are transformed into actions extended with discriminating information as\nexemplified above. In this paper we apply the proved trees approach of  to develop expansion laws for forward,\nreverse, and forward-reverse bisimilarities. This requires understanding which additional discriminating\ninformation is needed inside prefixes for the last two equivalences. While this is rather straightforward\nfor the truly concurrent semantics recalled above – the considered information is already present in the\noriginal transition labels – it is not obvious in our case because original transitions are labeled just\nwith actions. However, by looking at the three bottom states in Figure 1, one can\nrealize that they have different backward ready sets, i.e., sets of actions labeling incoming\ntransitions: {b,a},{b},{a}𝑏𝑎𝑏𝑎\\{b,a\\},\\{b\\},\\{a\\}. We show that backward ready sets indeed constitute the information that is necessary to add within action\nprefixes for reverse and forward-reverse bisimilarities, by means of a suitable process encoding. Moreover,\nwe provide an adequate treatment of concurrent processes in which independent actions have been executed on\nboth sides of the parallel composition because, e.g., a†.0¯​∥∅b†.0¯a^{{\\dagger}}.\\,\\underline{0}\\mathop{\\|_{\\emptyset}}b^{{\\dagger}}.\\,\\underline{0} cannot be expanded to something like a†.b†.0¯+b†.a†.0¯formulae-sequencesuperscript𝑎†superscript𝑏†¯0superscript𝑏†superscript𝑎†¯0a^{{\\dagger}}.\\,b^{{\\dagger}}.\\,\\underline{0}+b^{{\\dagger}}.\\,a^{{\\dagger}}.\\,\\underline{0} in that only one branch of an alternative composition can be executed. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we extend the syntax of the\nreversible process calculus of  by adding a parallel composition operator, we reformulate its\noperational semantics by following the proved trees approach of , and we rephrase the definitions\nof forward, reverse, and forward-reverse bisimilarities of . In\nSection 3 we illustrate the next steps of the proved trees approach, i.e., the\ndefinition of observation functions and process encodings. In Sections 4\nand 5 we respectively develop axioms for forward bisimilarity, including\nan interleaving-style expansion law, and for reverse and forward-reverse bisimilarities, including expansion\nlaws based on extending action prefixes with backward ready sets. In Section 6 we provide some\nconcluding remarks.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: and for Markovian processes.
