      "content": "Paper Title: Potential Impacts of Smart Homes on Human Behavior: A Reinforcement Learning Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we review some of the key papers in three main areas related to this paper. First, we review papers that use AI in smart environments. Next, we explore prior works in the area of human-RL interaction. These two surveys are necessary as our study integrates AI in the form of RL in a simulated smart home environment and aims to analyse the interaction between RL-based SHS and simulated human agents. Lastly, we review past works that have used RL to model human behaviour as we aim to simulate humans in the smart home using RL. It is therefore critical to base our human models on accepted approaches that have used RL for modeling human agents. AI in Smart Environments. Recent advances in machine learning have enabled smart devices to learn user behaviors and preferences for enhanced user experience and comfort. For instance, in  smart thermostats were capable of learning user thermal preferences in real-time using Bayesian networks. In , neural networks were used to predict user behaviors in smart homes to adjust the ambient thermal conditions. RL algorithms have also begun to make their way into SHS. In 4, value iteration, a reward-based algorithm, was used to learn user preferences about lighting, conditional on the number of occupants, time of day, and surrounding illumination. Multi-agent deep Q-Networks have been used in  to learn the energy cost of smart home appliances. Deep RL was employed in [ref]16 for energy minimization along with a neural network that predicted user thermal comfort. This was further extended in  where air quality for a particular temperature was controlled using the Double Deep Q-Network (Double DQN) algorithm while also minimizing the energy consumption. Similarly in  Q-Learning was used to control the indoor ventilation to maintain air quality by learning the rate of CO2 generation from individuals. An autonomous ventilation system was designed in  that learned to maintain the indoor air quality using DQN in a simulated environment, managing to reduce the energy consumption as well. Similarly in [ref]21, an air quality sensing system was developed where robots sensed the air quality via sensors and optimized their navigation path using Partial Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and Double DQN. Human-RL Interaction.\nA number of studies have explored the interaction between humans and RL systems. For instance, 5 discusses the notion of placing humans in the loop to provide feedback while an agent plays Atari games. With this approach, the learning stability of the agent increased as the number of iterations required for convergence was reduced. Similarly in , bots learned to converse through feedback from humans using the Reinforce algorithm, resulting in an improved learning curve. Based on studies such as the above, it can be observed that including humans in RL loops generally results in better AI learning. Nonetheless, some studies have interestingly discovered potential negative or unintended consequences of human-RL interactions. For instance, it was shown in 5 that in complex environments where the human is unsure about the nature of feedback it has to provide to the agents, AI learning frequently fails. Moreover, in some other studies, it has been shown that RL agents can exploit certain rules in the environment to maximize their reward regardless of its implications on the overall system. For example in  the agent exploited the environment to obtain indefinite rewards, while in , the agent exploited the physics engine of the environment to win the game. RL for Modeling Humans. Modeling human behavior as an artificial agent is a challenging task due to the existence of a large number of factors that govern our behaviors. As a result, its underlying learning mechanisms and associated reward systems are still open research problems. However, since the discovery of links between dopamine and the reward prediction error signal in RL 7, RL models have become key in studying multiple facets of human behaviours including learning, motivation, addiction, decision making, and numerous diseases 0. RL models of learning, behaviours, and dopamine are now well established and used in a large number of publications . Authors in  showed hierarchical RL to be more accurate in contextualizing and generalizing tasks, and measuring variations in performance between the users when compared with flat RL. In 3, hierarchical RL showed high accuracy in sentiment classification, noise reduction, and prioritizing certain sentiments in a given text document. Authors in   6 showed that humans in general divide a given task into sub-tasks and solve them in a hierarchical order that would return the highest reward at the end. Similarly, authors in 2 talked about the presence of hierarchical structures in the brain while making decisions, suggesting that we possess a cognitive control of sub-tasks based on their positions in the hierarchy order. These studies, among others, back the plausibility of using HRL-based models for simulating human decision making and behaviour in interaction with smart agents or environments.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: on the number of occupants, time of day, and surrounding illumination.
