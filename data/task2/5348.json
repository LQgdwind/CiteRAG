      "content": "Paper Title: Local consistency as a reduction between constraint satisfaction problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this subsection we shall explore the role of group CSPs as ‘obstacles’ for k𝑘k-consistency reductions. A seminal example is the fact that k𝑘k-consistency does not solve CSP⁡(𝔾)CSP𝔾\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{G}) for any non-trivial finite Abelian group 𝔾𝔾\\mathbb{G} [26, Theorem 30], or equivalently, that CSP⁡(𝔾)​≤Datalog​CSP⁡(⊥)CSP𝔾subscriptDatalogCSPbottom\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{G})\\not\\mathrel{\\leq_{\\text{Datalog}}}\\operatorname{CSP}(\\bot). It then follows that, e.g., CSP⁡(𝐊3)​≤Datalog​CSP⁡(⊥)CSPsubscript𝐊3subscriptDatalogCSPbottom\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{K}_{3})\\not\\mathrel{\\leq_{\\text{Datalog}}}\\operatorname{CSP}(\\bot) since, say, CSP⁡(ℤ3)CSPsubscriptℤ3\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{Z}_{3}) reduces to CSP⁡(𝐊3)CSPsubscript𝐊3\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{K}_{3}) by a gadget reduction and Datalog∪ reductions are transitive by Theorem 3.13.\nThe following proposition allows us to push this approach a bit further. CSP⁡(ℤp)​≤Datalog​CSP⁡(ℤq)CSPsubscriptℤ𝑝subscriptDatalogCSPsubscriptℤ𝑞\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{Z}_{p})\\not\\mathrel{\\leq_{\\text{Datalog}}}\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{Z}_{q}) for any distinct primes p𝑝p and q𝑞q. We start with a k𝑘k-consistent but unsolvable instance 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} of CSP⁡(ℤp)CSPsubscriptℤ𝑝\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{Z}_{p}), i.e., with a system of equations modulo p𝑝p which is not solvable, but is accepted by the k𝑘k-consistency test. Such a system is known to exist (see, e.g., [26; 3]). Observe that, after each step in the k𝑘k-consistency procedure, the sets ℱKsubscriptℱ𝐾\\mathcal{F}_{K} are always affine subspaces of ℤpKsuperscriptsubscriptℤ𝑝𝐾\\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{K} — since to begin with they are defined by linear equations, and in each step, we intersect with a projection of another affine subspace. Since the system is consistent, the subspaces are non-empty. Further observe that the maps π:ℱK→ℱL:𝜋→subscriptℱ𝐾subscriptℱ𝐿\\pi\\colon\\mathcal{F}_{K}\\to\\mathcal{F}_{L} defined by restriction to L𝐿L are affine, and hence the size of the preimage of an element f∈ℱL𝑓subscriptℱ𝐿f\\in\\mathcal{F}_{L} under π𝜋\\pi does not depend on f𝑓f — it only depends on the dimension of the kernel of π𝜋\\pi. Hence the uniform probability on ℱKsubscriptℱ𝐾\\mathcal{F}_{K}, i.e., λ:ℱK→ℚ:𝜆→subscriptℱ𝐾ℚ\\lambda\\colon\\mathcal{F}_{K}\\to\\mathbb{Q} defined as λ​(f)=1/pd𝜆𝑓1superscript𝑝𝑑\\lambda(f)=1/p^{d} where d𝑑d is the dimension of ℱKsubscriptℱ𝐾\\mathcal{F}_{K}, solves the corresponding Sherali-Adams linear program. Since p𝑝p and q𝑞q are coprime, we can interpret the expression 1/pd1superscript𝑝𝑑1/p^{d} as an element of ℤqsubscriptℤ𝑞\\mathbb{Z}_{q}. Consequently, this assignment is a feasible solution of the ℤqsubscriptℤ𝑞\\mathbb{Z}_{q}-affine k𝑘k-consistency relaxation with input 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}. We note that the above proposition could be also proved by using the fact that CSP⁡(ℤp)CSPsubscriptℤ𝑝\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{Z}_{p}) is not expressible in fixed-point logic with modulo q𝑞q rank operators (see, e.g., ) — though this proof requires either a refinement of [3, Theorem 3], or our Theorem 3.12. This alternative approach has been communicated to us by Anuj Dawar  and precedes the proof given here. It follows from the previous proposition that CSP⁡(𝐊3)​≤Datalog​CSP⁡(ℤ2)CSPsubscript𝐊3subscriptDatalogCSPsubscriptℤ2\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{K}_{3})\\not\\mathrel{\\leq_{\\text{Datalog}}}\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{Z}_{2}). More generally, it was shown by Ciardo and Živný  that\nCSP⁡(𝐊3)​≤Datalog​CSP⁡(ℤ)CSPsubscript𝐊3subscriptDatalogCSPℤ\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{K}_{3})\\not\\mathrel{\\leq_{\\text{Datalog}}}\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{Z}).777In fact, Ciardo and Živný  proved that PCSP⁡(𝐊3,𝐊c)PCSPsubscript𝐊3subscript𝐊𝑐\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{K}_{3},\\mathbf{K}_{c}) is not solved by the k𝑘k-th level of LP and AIP hierarchy, for any c≥3𝑐3c\\geq 3 and k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2, which is a stronger statement.\nSince CSP⁡(𝐊3)CSPsubscript𝐊3\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{K}_{3}) allows a gadget reduction from any CSP with a finite template, we can view this lack of a reduction as witnessed by CSP⁡(𝔾)CSP𝔾\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{G}) where 𝔾𝔾\\mathbb{G} is a non-Abelian finite group. This suggests the following intriguing question: Could it be that group CSPs constitute a complete set of obstructions for consistency reductions between finite-template CSPs? More concretely, is it true that for every finite structures 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B}, CSP⁡(𝐀)≤DatalogCSP⁡(𝐁)subscriptDatalogCSP𝐀CSP𝐁\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{A})\\mathrel{\\leq_{\\text{Datalog}}}\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{B}) if and only if, for every finite group 𝔾𝔾\\mathbb{G}, CSP⁡(𝔾)≤DatalogCSP⁡(𝐀)subscriptDatalogCSP𝔾CSP𝐀\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{G})\\mathrel{\\leq_{\\text{Datalog}}}\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{A}) implies CSP⁡(𝔾)≤DatalogCSP⁡(𝐁)subscriptDatalogCSP𝔾CSP𝐁\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{G})\\mathrel{\\leq_{\\text{Datalog}}}\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{B}) or, alternatively,\ndoes every equivalence class of finite-template CSPs up to consistency reductions contain a group CSP?\nThe positive verification in the particular case 𝐁=⊥𝐁bottom\\mathbf{B}=\\bot is essentially the notorious bounded width conjecture of Larose and Zádori  confirmed by Barto and Kozik [ref]8.\nAlthough extending this proof to all 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} is currently out of reach, we believe that the answer will be affirmative. In particular, we conjecture the following. For every finite structure 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}, either CSP⁡(𝕊3)≤DatalogCSP⁡(𝐀)subscriptDatalogCSPsubscript𝕊3CSP𝐀\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{S}_{3})\\mathrel{\\leq_{\\text{Datalog}}}\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{A}), where 𝕊3subscript𝕊3\\mathbb{S}_{3} denotes the symmetric group on 3 elements, or CSP⁡(𝐀)≤DatalogCSP⁡(ℤ)subscriptDatalogCSP𝐀CSPℤ\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{A})\\mathrel{\\leq_{\\text{Datalog}}}\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{Z}). The conjecture has an important consequence. If true, it would show that all CSPs tractable by the algorithms of Bulatov ; Zhuk  are solved by the ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}-affine k𝑘k-consistency relaxation for some k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1.\nCombining results of Section 3 and known results it follows that this algorithm solves correctly all CSPs solvable by the k𝑘k-consistency algorithm as well as systems of linear equations over a finite Abelian group, i.e., it solves the two prime examples of tractable CSPs. Let us note that another polynomial-time CSP algorithm coming from the algebraic approach, few subpowers, does not compare well with consistency reductions. In particular, the class of CSPs having few subpowers (i.e., the class of CSPs that are solved by this algorithm) contains all CSPs of Abelian groups, and hence infinitely many problems that are incomparable by consistency reductions. We believe that confirming (or disproving) the conjecture even in the case of CSPs with a Mal’cev polymorphism, which form a small subclass of few subpowers, would likely lead us close to a complete resolution. We conclude by observing that several relaxation variants previously defined are at least as powerful as the ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}-affine k𝑘k-consistency relaxation introduced here: the hierarchy of LP+AIP introduced by Brakensiek, Guruswami, Wrochna, and Živný , the hierarchy of CLAP introduced by Ciardo and Živný , and cohomological k𝑘k-consistency introduced by Ó Conghaile .\nThe power of these relaxations is not yet well understood even in the case of CSPs. For example, the comparison of the power of cohomological k𝑘k-consistency with respect to the hierarchy of LP+AIP is not clear.\nNote that our conjecture implies that all variants solve exactly the same CSPs, namely, all tractable ones (assuming P≠NPPNP\\text{P}\\neq\\text{NP}).\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: a group CSP?\nThe positive verification in the particular case 𝐁=⊥𝐁bottom\\mathbf{B}=\\bot is essentially the notorious bounded width conjecture of Larose and Zádori  confirmed by Barto and Kozik [ref]8.\nAlthough extending this proof to all 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} is currently out of reach, we believe that the answer will be affirmative.
