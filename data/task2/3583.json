      "content": "Paper Title: One Parameter Defense - Defending against Data Inference Attacks via Differential Privacy\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOn the back of the massive amounts of data we humans generate every day,\nmachine learning (ML) has become a key part of many real-world applications,\nranging from image classification to speech recognition [ref]1.\nHowever, these data often contain sensitive personal information\nthat is vulnerable to a range of adversarial activities, including\nmembership inference attacks [ref]2  and model inversion attacks  .\nBoth fall into the category of data inference attacks,\nwhich are launched by exploiting redundant information contained in confidence score vectors.\nFor example, a machine learning model will usually be more confident in its prediction about\na data record that is in its training dataset,\nover another data record that is not.\nAttackers can exploit this difference in confidence to determine\nwhether a given data record is or not a member of the target model‚Äôs training dataset.\nHere, a confidence score vector is a probability distribution over the possible classes predicted by an ML model.\nEach score in the vector indicates the model‚Äôs confidence in a prediction of the corresponding class.\nThe class with the largest confidence is predicted as the label of the input data record. Data inference attacks can result in severe privacy violations.\nFor example, consider a model that has been trained on data\ncollected from people with a certain disease.\nIf a particular individual‚Äôs data are known to be in the training dataset,\nthe adversary can immediately infer that person‚Äôs health status.\nAnother example is model inversion attack.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, an adversary can train an attack model to accurately reconstruct\nan input data record using only the confidence score vector,\neven if the data record is never seen by the attack model.\nHence, defending against data inference attacks has been\nthe focus of much attention in the privacy community. The methods proposed to date can be roughly classified into four categories\nbased on the defense techniques employed.\nThose in the first category use regularization techniques to reduce overfitting,\nsuch as L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} regularizer [ref]2, dropout [ref]1,\nmodel-stacking [ref]1 and min-max regularization .\nThis is because overfitting is one of the major factors leading to the distinguishability\nbetween member and non-member data records [ref]2.\nThe shortcoming of these methods, however, is that distinguishability,\ni.e., a model‚Äôs vulnerability, is not reduced directly.\nMoreover, they require retraining the target model\nwhich may not be very efficient for complex neural networks. The second category of the methods is based on adversarial examples .\nThese methods add a carefully crafted noise vector to a confidence score vector\nturning it into an adversarial example to mislead the attacker‚Äôs classifier.\nThese methods have formal utility loss guarantees of confidence score vectors.\nHowever, their effectiveness depends on the transferability of adversarial examples ,\nwhich might not generally reduce the distinguishability of prediction scores [ref]9. The third category of the methods is based on deep neural networks [ref]9.\nThese methods interpret defense goals as loss functions\nand train the deep neural networks as defense models to defend against attacks.\nThese methods can minimize the content of information\nattackers can use to infer membership or reconstruct the data records.\nHowever, this strategy requires training new models\nwhich may not be very time-efficient. The fourth category describes the differential privacy methods .\nThese methods carry a theoretical guarantee of privacy.\nHowever, as differential privacy is usually used during the training process,\ne.g., adding noise to gradients,\nthere is always a large classification accuracy loss .\nAs shown by Jayaraman and Evans ,\nexisting differentially private machine learning methods\nrarely offer acceptable privacy-utility tradeoffs for complex models.\nMoreover, since existing methods have to be integrated into the training of target models,\nthey are not applicable to those target models which have already been deployed. A common limitation shared by the existing defense methods is that all but one only protect against membership inference attacks.\nThe only method to handle both membership inference and model inversion attacks was proposed by Yang et al. [ref]9.\nTheir method, however, requires training new models which may not be very time-efficient.\nIn this paper, we develop a time-efficient defense method against both membership inference and model inversion attacks.\nOur solution is a differential privacy mechanism that modifies and normalizes the confidence score vectors to confuse the attacker‚Äôs classifier.\nAs such, the only parameter that needs to be tuned is the privacy budget,\nwhich controls the amount of perturbation added to the vector.\nFor example, when a learning model is very confident in predicting a given data record,\nthe output confidence score vector will have a very high probability of predicting one class\nand very low probabilities of predicting the others.\nBy using our method to modify the confidence score vector,\nthe probability distribution can be reshaped so that\none class has a slightly higher probability for prediction than other classes.\nThis new confidence score vector appears less confident than the original one\nand can be used to confuse the attacker‚Äôs classifier.\n The idea of modifying confidence score vectors to defend against data inference attacks is not new.\nHowever, the methods based on this premise, such as those in [ref]2 , do not provide a privacy guarantee\nplus they can only defend against membership inference attacks.\nBy comparison, our method has a privacy guarantee, and offers protection against\nboth membership inference and model inversion attacks.\nFurther, our method preserves the order of scores in confidence score vectors,\nwhich guarantees zero classification accuracy loss.\nMoreover, as our method does not require training any new models,\ntime-efficiency can be achieved.\nIn summary, this paper makes the following contributions.\n We are the first to propose a one-parameter defense method that requires only one parameter to be tuned, the privacy budget.\nThis method guarantees both differential privacy and time-efficiency against both membership inference and model inversion attacks. We theoretically demonstrate how to tune the privacy budget\nto defend against both types of attacks, while\ncontrolling the utility loss of confidence score vectors. We empirically show that\nthe presented method effectively mitigates both types of attacks\nwith no loss of classification accuracy, zero training time, and very low test time. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.\nSection II reviews the existing defense methods.\nSection III presents the preliminaries regarding\ndata inference attacks and differential privacy.\nOur method is presented in detail in Section IV.\nSection V theoretically analyzes the properties of our method and demonstrates how to use the method to defend against data inference attacks.\nThe experimental results are provided in Section VI.\nFinally, the paper concludes in Section VII.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: back of the massive amounts of data we humans generate every day,\nmachine learning (ML) has become a key part of many real-world applications,\nranging from image classification to speech recognition [ref]1.\nHowever, these data often contain sensitive personal information\nthat is vulnerable to a range of adversarial activities, including\nmembership inference attacks [ref]2  and model inversion\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
