      "content": "Paper Title: Duality-Induced Regularizer for Semantic Matching Knowledge Graph Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe demonstrate the performance of DURA on several semantic matching KGE models, including CP [ref]24, RESCAL , and ComplEx .\nNote that we reimplement CP, ComplEx, and RESCAL under the ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù setting  , and obtain better results than the reported performance in the original papers. Sun et al.  demonstrate that many existing learning-based models use inappropriate evaluation protocols and suffer from inflating performance. Therefore, for ConvE, ConvKB, and KB-GAT, we take their results from  for a fair comparison. The baseline models include distance-based models (TransE , TransH , TransD , RotatE , MuRP [ref]30, HAKE ), learning-based models (ConvE [ref]18, ConvKB , KB-GAT , InteractE , and StAR ), and semantic matching models (CP [ref]24, RESCAL , ComplEx ).\n\nTransE is the most representative translational distance model, while failing to deal with 1-to-N, N-to-1, and N-to-N relations. TransH introduces relation-specific hyperplanes to overcome these disadvantages. TransD shares a similar idea with TransH. It introduces relation-specific spaces rather than hyperplanes. TransD also decomposes the projection matrix into a product of two vectors for further simplification. RotatE defines each relation as a rotation from the source entity to the target entity in the complex vector space and naturally, it is able to model and infer various relation patterns. MuRP embeds multi-relational graph in the Poincar√© ball model of hyperbolic space to capture multiple simultaneous hierarchies. HAKE maps entities into the polar coordinate system to model semantic hierarchies, which are common in real-world applications. ConvE introduces a multi-layer convolutional network model to learn more expressive features with less parameters. ConvKB represents triples as 3-column matrixs, and employs a convolutional neural network to capture global relationships and transitional characteristics between entities and relations. KB-GAT proposes an attention-based feature embedding that captures both entity and relation features to cover the complex and hidden information in the local neighborhood surrounding a triple. InteractE improves ConvE by increasing feature interactions. StAR follows the textual encoding paradigm and augments it with graph embedding techniques.\n Table II shows the evaluation results.\nOverall, DURA significantly improves the performance of all considered SM models. The results demonstrate that without regularization, semantic matching models perform worse than state-of-the-art distance-based models on WN18RR, e.g., RotatE, MuRP, and HAKE. When incorporating with DURA, these semantic matching models achieve competitive performance with distance-based models. Moreover, DURA further improve the performance gain of semantic matching models on FB15k-237 and YAGO3-10. Compared with learning-based models, semantic matching models with DURA outperforms all of them without using external textual information. Notably,\nsemantic matching models with DURA even outperform StAR (Self-Adp) on FB15k-237, which use external textual information to enhance the expressiveness of KGE.\nGenerally, models with more parameters and datasets with smaller sizes imply a larger risk of overfitting. Among the three datasets, WN18RR has the smallest size of only 111111 kinds of relations and around 80‚Äãk80ùëò80k training samples. Therefore, the improvements brought by DURA on WN18RR are expected to be larger compared with other datasets, which is consistent with the experiments.\nAs stated in , RESCAL is a more expressive model, but it is prone to overfit on small- and medium-sized datasets because it represents relations with much more parameters. For example, on WN18RR dataset, RESCAL gets an H@10 score of 0.493, which is lower than ComplEx (0.522). The advantage of its expressiveness does not show up at all. Incorporated with DURA, RESCAL gets an 8.4% improvement on H@10 and finally attains 0.577, outperforming all compared models. On larger datasets such as YAGO3-10, overfitting also exists but will be insignificant. Nonetheless, DURA still leads to consistent improvement, showing the ability of DURA to prevent models from overfitting.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: We demonstrate the performance of DURA on several semantic matching KGE models, including CP [ref]24, RESCAL , and ComplEx .\nNote that we reimplement CP, ComplEx, and RESCAL under the ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù setting  , and obtain better results than the reported performance in the original papers.
