      "content": "Paper Title: Low-Resource Court Judgment Summarization for Common Law Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCommon law systems rely on case precedents (prior cases), which encompass not only judgments within a particular jurisdiction but also judgments from all jurisdictions throughout the common law world .111A jurisdiction is an area with a set of laws governed by a court system or government entity .\nJudges in common law jurisdictions need to find similar precedents and refer to the rationale employed in previous judgments . Court judgment documents typically contain long text that comprehensively discusses each case and provides detailed explanations of judges’ decisions. Reading previous cases’ judgments is crucial for legal practitioners in common law jurisdictions.\nThere exist massive reported cases, and the number of cases is still increasing . It is difficult for legal practitioners to read through abundant cases’ judgment documents. The high-quality summary of judgment document can facilitate readers to quickly browse key information of each case. It not only helps legal practitioners effectively review past cases, but also makes it easier for the general public to read judgments and understand how the courts operate and how the law is applied.\nHowever, employing legal experts to write summaries costs a lot and has limited coverage of new or atypical cases’ judgments .\nAlternatively, we can leverage automatic text summarization technology to generate summaries for court judgments.\nConsidering judges need to compare similar precedents across all common law jurisdictions , summaries of court judgments from multiple common law jurisdictions are helpful for comparing and analyzing similar precedents efficiently. Our research focuses on empowering computers to produce high-quality summaries of multi-jurisdictional judgments even when lacking data and computational resources.\nTo accomplish this goal, we must address several challenging issues: 1) the lack of datasets, 2) training supervised summarization models with very limited labeled data, 3) efficiently process long documents and summaries with limited computing resources, 4) accurately and comprehensively assess the quality of generated summaries. We propose a solution for low-resource court judgment summarization to address the above challenging issues.\nFigure 1 depicts six key steps in our solution, including data collection, data cleaning, data augmentation, content selection, summary generation, and evaluation. There are very few court judgment summarization datasets. Some focus on civil law jurisdictions  [ref]6, while others concentrate on judgments from specific common law jurisdictions  [ref]8.\nThey are insufficient to satisfy the demands of summarizing court judgment documents across multiple common law jurisdictions and comprehensively evaluating judgment summarization methods.\nIn order to address the lack of datasets, we build CLSum, the first large-scale dataset for summarizing multi-jurisdictional common law court judgment documents. 222The CLSum dataset is available for download online at: github.com/StevenLau6/CLSum.\nCLSum has four subsets for court judgments from Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong SAR. Similar to other domain-specific tasks, court judgment summarization usually suffers from a shortage of labeled data. Most judgments do not have summaries due to the high cost of hiring experts to write summaries. In most jurisdictions, court websites do not publish or only publish a small number of judgment summaries of typical cases.\nUnder this low data resource condition, summarization models’ few-shot and zero-shot performance becomes crucial.\nWe carry out extensive comparative experiments to analyze the effect of the training set size on different summarization models’ performance.\nIn addition to selecting models with good few-shot and zero-shot performance, expanding the dataset is another way to improve summarization performance.\nTo expand our CLSum’s training sets and reduce overfitting, we adopt the large language model (LLM) for data augmentation. Meanwhile, we introduce legal knowledge into the prompts to constrain the LLM to properly use legal concepts when synthesizing sample text in the data augmentation process.\n In addition to insufficient data resources, deploying artificial intelligence models in domain applications is often hindered by limited computing resources. Processing long documents and summaries usually requires more computing resources.\nWhen computing resources are limited, it is crucial to reduce the complexity of the summarization models and improve the efficiency of model training and inference.\nTo reduce the complexity of the summarization models, our solution has a two-stage summarization framework, which first compresses long inputs in the content selection stage and then feeds the compressed inputs into the abstractive summarization models for fine-grained content selection and integration. Besides, we also substitute the original self-attention mechanism with sparse attention mechanisms  0 and adopt a divide-and-conquer-based training strategy for models pre-trained on the shorter input sequences.\nTo further reduce the consumption of GPU memory and conduct model fine-tuning and inference on off-the-shelf GPUs, we adopt some memory-efficient training techniques 1 2 3 4 5 6. It is also crucial to accurately and comprehensively evaluate the quality of the generated summaries.\nWe adopt various summarization methods as baselines and evaluate them on our CLSum dataset. For performance comparison, we carry out automatic evaluation and human evaluation.\nApart from the widely used evaluation metrics, we design a legal knowledge enhanced evaluation metric named LTScore. It is based on foundation models fine-tuned on the legal corpus. Legal texts usually contain more legal terms compared to texts in the general domain. These terms should be used accurately in court judgments and their summaries.\nTherefore, LTScore assigns greater weights to legal terms in judgment summaries to better assess the accurate usage of such legal terms. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We list our objectives and contribution in Section 2. Section 3 briefly introduces related works. We present our CLSum dataset in Section 4, our summarization method in Section 5, and our experimental settings in Section 6. Our experimental results are reported and analyzed in Section 7. Finally, Section 8 concludes this paper and discusses our future work.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: collection, data cleaning, data augmentation, content selection, summary generation, and evaluation.
