      "content": "Paper Title: Brain Inspired Probabilistic Occupancy Grid Mapping with Hyperdimensional Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince the introduction of Unimate  in 1954,\nthe field of robotics has experienced exponential growth, leading to the development of numerous specialized fields   .\nA major area known as probabilistic robotics, focuses on understanding how autonomous systems perform despite uncertainty in multiple tasks such as occupancy grid mapping (OGM), perception, and control, with each having their own unique challenges .\nAn essential capability for real-time robotic systems is the accurate and computationally efficient probabilistic mapping of dynamic environments.\nEfficient probabilistic mapping is the central idea within OGM where environments are discretized into individual cells, also known as voxels [ref]6.\nEach cell is then assigned labels or properties such as occupancy, traversability, or other relevant attributes based on specific application requirements .DISTRIBUTION A. Approved for public release; distribution unlimited. OPSEC #8540. OGM methods are broadly categorized into two main areas: traditional and neural methods.\nTraditional methods    0 1 adopt a dense approach where each voxel is assigned a fully defined probability distribution.\nIn contrast, neural methods, such as 2 3 4 5 6, utilize deep learning to create a black-box solution, which mitigates many of the computational challenges associated with traditional methods but introduces fragility to domain adaptation and model stochasticity 7.\nAlthough neural methods represent significant computational advantages over traditional approaches, their intrinsic stochasticity and lack of interpretability within deep latent spaces, pose significant validation challenges, particularly in safety-critical applications 8. Recent advances in cognitive science 9 and computational neuroscience 0 highlight the unique computational properties in hyperdimensional spaces.\nAlso known as vector symbolic architectures (VSA), these methods are actively being explored as mathematical analogs to the higher-order computational capabilities of spiking neurons 1.\nFurthermore, VSA approaches posses unique computational properties allowing them to statistically, and deterministically, encode semantic and spatial information 2. In this work, we introduce a Fourier-based VSA framework, known as VSA-OGM, leveraging the unique probabilistic properties of bio-inspired hyperdimensional vectors to efficiently and accurately perform OGM. Our approach draws inspiration from both theoretical  and neural 2 methods aiming to strike a balance between the accuracy, interpretability, stability, and domain flexibility of traditional methods with the computational efficiency of neural methods. Moreover, VSA-OGM employs a novel application of Shannon entropy 3 to extract feature rich information from the internal holographically reduced representations. As such, this work stands as a foundational work at the intersection of traditional and neural methods known as quasi-neural methods. Existing works on VSAs for real-time robotic systems focus on robotic path integration 4 and simplified mapping scenarios 2, rather than large scale and real world mapping applications. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first large scale application and development of a VSA framework for real time occupancy grid mapping. Throughout the remainder of this work, we provide further background information on the fields of OGM and VSAs. We discuss the specifics of VSA-OGM and highlight the performance of our framework on three synthetic datasets 0 5 and one real dataset 5 compared to traditional 0 , and neural methods 2. We also conduct an in-depth ablation study providing further insight into the capabilities and unique aspects of VSA-OGM.\nWe conclude with a detailed discussion of our results and potential avenues for future research. In summary, the major contributions of our paper are: We introduce a quasi-neural VSA framework for OGM, VSA-OGM, with a novel application of Shannon entropy. Compared to covariant traditional methods 0 across two simulated 0 and one real-word 5 dataset, our VSA framework provides approximately 1000x and 200x memory and latency reductions while maintaining comparable accuracy. We demonstrate the single-agent and multi-agent mapping capabilities of VSA-OGM compared to an invariant traditional method  where we reduce latency by approximately 4x. We highlight the capabilities of our framework compared to neural methods 2 where we reduce latency by approximately 1.5x without model pretraining despite maintaining comparable accuracy. We conduct a detailed ablation study highlighting the performance implications of VSA-OGM across a range of hyperparameter combinations.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: efficient probabilistic mapping of dynamic environments.\nEfficient probabilistic mapping is the central idea within OGM where environments are discretized into individual cells, also known as voxels [ref]6.\nEach cell is then assigned labels or properties such as occupancy, traversability, or other relevant attributes based on specific application requirements .DISTRIBUTION A.
