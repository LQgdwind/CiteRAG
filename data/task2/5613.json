      "content": "Paper Title: Semi-decentralized Inference in Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Demand Forecasting: An Edge-Computing Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIntelligent transportation system (ITS) is an essential item in modern city planning. A key component of an ITS is the means of public transportation such as taxis, buses, and ride-hailing vehicles. As the importance of these services grows, there is a corresponding need for accurately and efficiently forecasting the travel needs of passengers and the corresponding available supplies by vacant taxis ready to serve them. This forecasting enables efficient management of transportation resources and allows for dynamic allocation of taxis such that customer waiting time is minimized and the taxi occupancy times are maximized. It can also help optimizing routes, urban development, traffic flow, and public transportation planning. Taxi demand forecasting has been receiving increasing amounts of attention in the recent transportation engineering literature [ref]1        . Similar to other prediction problems, approaches to taxi demand and supply forecasting can be broadly categorized into two main categories; first is model-based approaches where a statistical model for traffic patterns is employed. Examples along this line include integrated auto-regressive moving average (ARIMA)  and linear regression  models. Despite their simplicity, these methods focus only on temporal dependencies and overlook exploiting spatial dependencies for the prediction. The other category is deep learning (DL)-based methods where data-driven techniques are shown to well exploit spatiotemporal correlations for improved prediction. Along the DL line, recurrent neural networks (RNN) such as long short-term memory (LSTM) are especially important for taxi demand and supply forecasting as they can well address time dependency. Accordingly, there is a series of works on using RNN for taxi demand and supply forecasting  [ref]12  . Recently, there has been a growing interest in the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) for taxi demand and supply prediction. This approach models city regions as nodes in a graph and their relations as the edges linking these nodes. Along this line, several works have shown the advantage of GNNs in utilizing local region information and the relationships across non-Euclidean regions in improving the forecasting performance [ref]14       . Despite the promising success of GNNs for taxi demand and supply forecasting, there are still outstanding challenges hindering their potential. First, as for graph representation, it is advantageous to simultaneously expose several node and relation types in the representation learning of transportation graphs . Specifically, the existence of multiple types of nodes and edges in current transportation graphs calls for adopting a heterogeneous information network (HIN) approach to seamlessly exploit them. This requires the development of corresponding heterogeneous GNNs (hetGNNs) to handle their representation learning. Second, inferring taxi demand and supply predictions at the level of the whole transportation system incurs a huge amount of computation as it is necessary to utilize the existing salient relationships. This calls for developing solutions to improve the scalability of the GNN approach to cope with city-wide or even larger graphs . Based on the above discussion, in this paper, we propose a hetGNN-LSTM-based algorithm for taxi demand and supply prediction. Compared to the existing GNN-based approaches, our algorithm defines taxis as nodes in a graph. This allows taxi graphs to be dynamic as opposed to existing approaches assuming nodes as fixed geographical regions. On the other hand, this allows for predicting the demands and supplies for each taxi. Operating this algorithm in a centralized way is computationally intensive. Therefore, we develop a decentralized GNN inference approach. However, we show theoretically and through experiments that this decentralized approach has a huge amount of message passing delay which grows quadratically with the number of communication hops.\nTo reduce this delay, we propose a semi-decentralized approach. This approach uses multiple cloudlet devices each handling a subgraph of the transportation graph. A cloudlet is a moderate computing capability device placed at a base station (BS) and able to communicate with the taxis in its coverage area. From now on, we refer to the cloudlet with its network as a cloudlet network (CLN). As for the BS, we assume a 5G small cell such as the architecture of eNodeB BS detailed in . The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. We consider taxi demand and supply forecasting at a taxi level. Predicting on a taxi-node level provides drivers with immediate information on the availability of pick-ups and supply of other taxis in a region surrounding them. We propose a novel heterogeneous graph-based algorithm for taxi demand and supply prediction utilizing hetGNNs. We model the transportation system as a heterogeneous graph of taxis as nodes linked with three relationship types derived from road connectivity, location proximity, and target destination proximity. The proposed algorithm exploits these relationships to improve the prediction. We propose a semi-decentralized approach to GNN-based traffic prediction. This approach is proposed to mitigate the scalability of centralized GNN inference and the huge message-passing delay in decentralized GNN inference. We propose an adaptive node-CLN assignment to minimize inter-CLN communication. We develop a heuristic protocol for this assignment in a distributed manner across cloudlet devices. Experiments on real-world taxi data show a high-accuracy prediction of the proposed taxi demand and supply forecasting algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art, represented by DCRNN [ref]14, Graph WaveNet , and CCRNN  being leading GNN-based approaches. Experiments also show that the inference time delay in decentralized GNN operation grows quadratically with the number of message-passing hops. Also, the proposed semi-decentralized GNN approach is shown to reduce the overall inference time by about 10 times compared to centralized and decentralized inference. The source code and datasets used in this paper are available on https://github.com/mahmoudkanazzal/SemidecentralizedhetGNNLSTM. The rest of this work is organized as follows. Section II revises related works. The proposed taxi demand and supply algorithm and semi-decentralized GNN approach are detailed in Section Section III.
