      "content": "Paper Title: Age of Semantics in Cooperative Communications: To Expedite Simulation Towards Real via Offline Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMaintaining fresh information of the process of interest at the destination requires the SN to send the time-stamped status updates, which motivates the introduction of age of information (AoI)  .\nAt the destination, AoI quantifies the time lag since the generation of the most recently received update.\nIn the literature, most efforts have been focused on exploring AoI in single-hop communication systems [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and the references therein].\nIt remains daunting to minimize AoI in cooperative relay communication systems, where the path selection and the resource constraint noticeably expand the dimensionality.\nIn , Talak et al. studied simple stationary policies to minimize AoI for multi-hop networks under general interference constraints.\nIn , Farazi et al. derived the lower bounds on peak and average AoI in multi-hop wireless networks with explicit channel contention.\nIn , He et al. proposed to minimize the maximum average AoI in a multi-hop Internet-of-Things network, which was formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem jointly optimizing beamforming vector and routing.\nIn , Lou et al. developed a linearized approximate algorithm and a polynomial time algorithm to optimize AoI in a multi-hop wireless network.\nIn [ref]19, Liu et al. proved that the peak/average AoI minimization in multi-path communications turned out to be roughly equivalent to minimizing the maximum delay, which was leveraged to design a general approximation solution.\nHowever, the neglect of the tight coupling between decision-makings and uncertainties leads to suboptimal AoI in dynamic relay communication systems. In a cooperative relay communication system, the uncertainties originate from not only the variations during status update transmissions (e.g., the temporally changing channel gain and system topology), but also the randomness in resource availabilities (e.g., the transmit power and computation capability) .\nMarkov decision process (MDP) provides a mathematical framework for controlling actions (i.e., decision-makings) under uncertainties over the time horizon .\nUsing a constrained MDP, Gu et al. investigated the problem of age minimization for a two-hop relay system under a resource budget [ref]22.\nIn , Tripathi et al. converted the AoI optimization into network stability problems, for which the Lyapunov drift was used to find the scheduling and routing policies.\nThe Lyapunov technique does not rely on the MDP statistics but only constructs an approximately optimal policy.\nReinforcement learning (RL) has been successful in solving an MDP without a priori statistical information   .\nTo our best knowledge, there is yet no comprehensive attempt to unleash the power of RL for AoI optimization in cooperative relay communication systems.\nAs we shall illustrate, this work will go even further and concentrate on the following two aspects. AoI versus Semantics Freshness: We note that the majority of the prior research has been directed at optimizing the information freshness.\nThere is a huge potential for the SN to boost the resource efficiency of status update transmissions if the intrinsic semantics of the process of interest can be extracted  .\nIn a cooperative relay communication system, the ultimate goal of the destination is to promptly grasp the inference (e.g., the inference result from each recovered image for traffic accident surveillance as in the illustrative example above) from the status updates.\nIn line with the definition, even when the destination has the perfect inference of the current process status, AoI keeps increasing until a new update is received from the SN.\nIn , Sun et al. validated that the expected estimation performance from the mean squared error (MSE)-minimum sampling is much better than the AoI-optimal sampling for the Wiener process with random delay.\nTo address such a shortcoming of AoI, Maatouk et al. introduced the age of incorrect information (AoII), which incorporated the content of the status updates into the design of a transmission policy within the MDP framework .\nHowever, we still lack a metric that reveals the relationship between the semantics of the process of interest at the SN and the timely inference from a status update at the destination. Online versus Offline RL: In a simulated system, an RL agent utilizes the newly collected interaction experiences to update the control policy parameters.\nMeanwhile, the experiences come from implementing the control policy to be optimized.\nThe repeated alternate between updating the control policy parameters and collecting the interaction experiences over the time horizon is considered as the online RL training.\nThis falls into the “chicken and egg” paradox, which restricts the application of online RL to a real system.\nOn one hand, the continuous online collection of interaction experiences is extremely challenging.\nOn the other hand, the random actions from the RL agent during the trial-and-error exploration are dangerous for operating a system [ref]26.\nAccordingly, in a real cooperative relay communication system, the control policy of the SN has to be pre-trained offline.\nThe offline RL training leverages a static dataset, which is composed of a number of interaction experiences (e.g., from the historical system operations) .\nWe refer to each interaction experience as a tuple of current system state, action, immediate utility and subsequent system state.\nTowards this direction, one theme of work was centered on learning the control policy by constraining the feasible action space to the support of the dataset [ref]26   .\nAnother recent theme is aimed at preventing the extrapolation errors attributed to the out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, which are those that do not appear under the same current system state of an interaction experience in the dataset   .\nHowever, the state-of-the-art results on offline RL are either not applicable to discrete action settings or are highly sensitive to the dataset quality.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: jointly optimizing beamforming vector and routing.\nIn , Lou et al. developed a linearized approximate algorithm and a polynomial time algorithm to optimize AoI in a multi-hop wireless network.\nIn [ref]19, Liu et al. proved that the peak/average AoI minimization in multi-path communications turned out to be roughly equivalent to minimizing the maximum delay, which was leveraged to design a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
