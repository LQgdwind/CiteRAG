      "content": "Paper Title: Harnessing the Power of Ego Network Layers for Link Prediction in Online Social Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn early 2021, the number of social media users worldwide has reached 4.2 billion, up 13% from the previous year [ref]1. Social media are now large ecosystems, where we gather to interact with people we already know or to join communities of people that share our interests.\nClearly, being able to pair together people with similar interests is crucial for social-driven and content-driven platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, etc. This spurred intense research on link prediction, whereby algorithms suggest potential new links with users that are similar to each other. Solving this problem is equivalent to finding a needle in a haystack: online social networks (OSN) feature millions of users, the number of potential links between them grows with the square of the number of users, but the actually existing links are quite sparse. Link prediction algorithms can be broadly divided into feature extraction methods and feature learning methods . The former are based on predefined similarity metrics/heuristics, typically computed using topological information about the network, be it local information (such as the number of common neighbors) or global one (such as the length of paths connecting two nodes). Despite their apparent simplicity, local similarity-based prediction algorithms perform generally well, even when compared to more complex approaches [ref]3, and are also computationally efficient.\nThe latter are new link prediction methods (leveraging graph neural networks [ref]4     and network embeddings  ) that automatically learn latent features (i.e., not previously hand-engineered) that reflect the relevant structure of the graph, and, for this reason, are denoted as feature learning methods. These new methods have been shown to perform extremely well on the link prediction task  . One of the well-known mechanisms that drive link formation is the homophily principle, which states that individuals tend to bond with those that are more similar to them . Common-neighbors-based algorithms leverage this principle for predicting new links. However, findings from anthropology show that not all bonds are equal: some relationships are just acquaintances and do not imply a significant cognitive engagement. With respect to the meaningful relationships, each individual organises them into concentric social circles where the intimacy progressively decreases from the innermost to the outermost circle  . This model of how humans organise their relationships stems from the social brain hypothesis, which links our social life to cognitive constraints related to the size of our neocortex . This hierarchical social structure is known to impact significantly on who we trust , on the way information spreads in online social networks , on the diversity of information that can be acquired by users , and on academic performance . This layered social structure is typically represented using an ego network graph  0 1 , in which the individual, referred to as ego, is at the center of the graph, and the edges connect her to the peers (called alters) with which she interacts. Figure 1 illustrates the classical ego network structure. Please note that the second layer includes all the alters in the first layer, the third layer includes all the alters in the first and second layers, and so on. The ego-alter tie strength is typically computed as a function of the frequency of interactions between the ego and the alter. The ego network structure is characterised by a striking regularity: the typical sizes of the layers are 1.5, 5, 15, 50, 150, with an approximately constant ratio of 3 between the size of consecutive layers.\nOnline relationships have been shown to exhibit similar regularities 2 3, thus proving that friendship links (which can be in the thousands for online social networks) not associated with online interactions do not change the innate social structure of humans. Motivation. Since social links are not all the same, simply considering the set of common neighbors (or analogous topological metrics), disregarding the importance of each social link, might not give a precise estimate of the homophily between two individuals. In fact, a common best friend is intuitively much more important than a common acquaintance when predicting the formation of new links. Thus, in this paper, we set out to improve feature-extraction link prediction algorithms with information about the different importance of social relationships. To this end, we exploit well-established models in the anthropology literature that describe the relative importance of our social bonds by grouping them into different social circles. Please note that the social circles we refer to are very loosely related to the concept of communities in social networks. In fact, social circles are (local) groupings entirely from the perspective of the ego, they include only nodes with which the ego is directly connected, and the links between the alters (which are crucial for regular communities) do not play a role at all here. Note also that our goal is not to propose a new prediction algorithm, but to add social-awareness to popular prediction solutions.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the only other work in the literature that investigates ego networks in relation to link prediction is 4. However, in the context of that work, an ego network is a different structure from the one studied here (only the links between the alters are considered), social cognitive models are not leveraged, and the effect of using information on the different social circles for link prediction is not investigated. While the general problem of link prediction entails recommending any of the useful links that a user may want to create with other users, in certain applications we may want to recommend links between users that share a specific common interest together. Predicting links in such contextualised communities might be much more relevant (and valuable) than predicting links between generic users. This could be the case, for example, of a third party service that wants to connect users interested in a specific topic. In this paper, we showcase one application of this concept by focusing on a set of gamers on Twitter, and we investigate how to make new link recommendations leveraging key properties of the way users allocate their cognitive capacity to social relationships. As discussed in Section III, we believe that focusing on such a target set of users, characterised by a specific type of online engagement, is particularly significant for link recommendation in online social networks. Then, we apply the same method to generic Twitter users, in order to assess the efficacy of the proposed solution also beyond the contextualised communities settings. Key findings. The key findings presented in the paper are the following: In the vast majority of cases, regardless of the prediction approach (unsupervised or supervised), the specific heuristic or learning algorithm, and the metric (precision, AUC, F1 score) considered, leveraging social circles information outperforms the corresponding baseline in which circles are ignored. The contribution of the different social circles to the achieved precision varies with the recommendation algorithm considered. In unsupervised similarity-based approaches, innermost circles help policies with little or no penalization of high degree nodes, while outermost circles boost the performance of algorithms relying on high-degree nodes penalization. The precision of supervised strategies is generally considerably increased when only the innermost circle, corresponding to the small set (composed of 3-5 people typically) of the most intimate relationships, is considered. Supervised link prediction that uses circle-aware explicit features is able to beat feature-learning link prediction algorithms like node2vec and SEAL, which exploit node embedding and graph neural networks, respectively. This happens when the most intimate circle is leveraged, which comprises only the two or three strongest relationships of the ego. Thus, using knowledge on a few common strong ties is more effective than complex black box approaches. Leveraging social circles information provides the same performance as using additional classifiers on nodes, which might be impractical or costly to use. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. We review the related work in Section II. In Section III we present the two datasets that we leverage in our analysis. The ego-aware unsupervised and supervised link prediction approaches based on feature extraction methods that we study, and the feature learning methods that we use as benchmarks are presented Section IV. Their prediction performance is then evaluated in Section V.\nFinally, in Section VI we conclude the paper.
