      "content": "Paper Title: Training Debiased Subnetworks with Contrastive Weight Pruning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets To show the effectiveness of the proposed pruning algorithms, we evaluate the generalization performance of several debiasing approaches on Colored MNIST (CMNIST), Corrupted CIFAR-10 (CIFAR10-C), Biased FFHQ (BFFHQ) with varying ratio of bias-conflicting samples, i.e., bias ratio. We report unbiased accuracy   on the test set, which includes a balanced number of samples from each data group. We also report bias-conflict accuracy for some experiments, which is the average accuracy on bias-conflicting samples included in an unbiased test set. Specifically, we report the bias-conflict accuracy on BFFHQ in which half of the unbiased test samples are bias-aligned, while the model with the best-unbiased accuracy is selected (Unbiased accuracy in Table 4). For CelebA (blonde) [ref]29 4, we report worst-group and average accuracy following [ref]29 considering that abundant samples are included in (Blonde Hair=0, Male=0) bias-conflicting group. We use the same data splits from 4. Baselines We compare DCWP with vanilla network trained by ERM, and the following state-of-the-art debiasing approaches: EnD [ref]33, Rebias , MRM , LfF , JTT  and DisEnt . EnD relies on the annotations on the spurious attribute of training samples, i.e., bias labels. Rebias relies on prior knowledge about the type of dataset bias (e.g., texture). MRM, LfF, JTT and DisEnt do not presume such bias labels or prior knowledge about dataset bias. Notably, MRM is closely related to DCWP where it probes the unbiased functional subnetwork with standard cross entropy. Details about other simulation settings are provided in Supplementary Material.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: accuracy on BFFHQ in which half of the unbiased test samples are bias-aligned, while the model with the best-unbiased accuracy is selected (Unbiased accuracy in Table 4). For CelebA (blonde) [ref]29 4, we report worst-group and average accuracy following [ref]29 considering that abundant samples are included in (Blonde Hair=0, Male=0) bias-conflicting group. We use the same data splits\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
