      "content": "Paper Title: Motion-based Camera Localization System in Colonoscopy Videos\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOptical colonoscopy is a medical procedure to inspect the mucosal surface to detect abnormalities in the colon. It is an indispensable tool for evaluating many gastrointestinal diseases. During the procedure, a flexible probe with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and a fiber optic light source at the tip are inserted into the rectum and advanced through the colon. After reaching the proximal portion of the intestine (typically the cecum or ileum), the physician withdraws the colonoscope and visually inspects the tissue surface for abnormalities. Colono-scopy is the primary tool used to screen for colorectal cancer and precancerous lesions and is recommended for all adults over age 50, with repeated exams every 3-10 years based on risk stratification  2. Additionally, colonoscopy is commonly used to locate and treat sources of lower gastrointestinal bleeding.\n . Colonoscopy is also used to investigate causes of diarrhea, in particular inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) 1. Inspection of the mucosal surface by colonoscopy is particularly important in IBD, where disease severity assessment and monitoring of treatment effectiveness are heavily dependent on the findings of repeated colonoscopies [ref]27  . However, the interpretation of medical images and video are subject to inter-observer variation, limiting the reliability, quantification, and tracking of the evolution of findings from colonoscopy over time. Thus, there is a need to automate the analysis of colonoscopies in order to standardize reporting so that disease assessments are uniform regardless of colonoscope operator experience. Though image classification has been the focus of efforts in automated colonoscopy video analysis, camera localization is an important component for interpreting findings. Localizing lesions can help generate contextual information by providing anatomical awareness. The localization of the camera can help improve the accuracy in diagnosis and prognosis of multiple diseases identified by colonoscopy, including cancer position and burden, bleeding source, and IBD distribution    . Existing methods for endoscopic object localization fall into two categories: sensor-based localization methods 8 and computer vision-based camera motion estimation methods . While sensor-based methods can provide the absolute position, a relative position of the camera with respect to the end and start of the colon may be sufficient for contextual understanding of colon features. Sensor-free methods of camera location estimation using computer-vision methods are likely to sacrifice marginally relevant accuracy in exchange for improved feasibility. Sensor-free camera localization methods are attractive as there is no additional equipment needed, allowing for rapid integration into clinical workflows, wide availability, and low financial cost. In this work, we propose a vision-based sensor-free localization system using deep learning techniques. Deep learning architectures have been successfully applied to estimating camera pose in driving videos  9 . In 7, a new view can be synthesized given the current view coupled with predicted depth and camera motion under the assumption of a rigid scene. In , a self-supervised convolutional nerual network (CNN) architecture was proposed for camera motion estimation with the model trained using the photometric error between the synthesized view and the real frame. From their results, the model can achieve performance comparable with state-of-the-art methods without knowing the ground truth for camera motion. In this study, we adapted the self-supervised framework and proposed several modifications to improve the performance of pose estimation in colonoscopy videos. Based on the camera motion estimation, a localization system was developed that can identify the location index of each frame as well as which anatomical colon segment it belongs to. An overview of the system is shown in Figure 1. The proposed localization system starts with the detection and removal of non-informative frames and frames with biopsy forceps. The non-informative frames are removed as they contain no motion information and may hamper optical flow calculation and pose estimation. The calculation of photometric error for self-supervision relies on the assumption of a rigid scene, which is not true during a biopsy. As a result, frames with biopsy forceps are removed. After that, a self-training end-to-end CNN framework estimates the camera motion within colonoscopy videos. After camera motion estimation, the camera trajectory is derived, from which the location index estimation and anatomical colon segment classification are estimated. The output from the proposed motion-based localization system can further facilitate contextual understanding, such as determining the distribution of biopsy sites and disease severity. The main contributions of our work are as follows: A novel camera localization system was designed that overcomes challenges of motion tracking in colonoscopy videos. Three major modifications were made over previous methods to improve the performance of pose estimation in endoscopic videos. First, optical flow between two consecutive frames was added as input, which provides explicit information regarding the camera’s motion and reduces the impact of video noise. Secondly, a mask for specular regions was estimated to filter out regions not compatible with the Lambertian surface assumption. In colonoscopy videos, moisture on the colon wall will lead to a number of specular regions, which may disrupt photometric error calculation. Filtering out those regions focuses the network on the photometric error calculated from the Lambertian surface. Thirdly, a movement consistency term was added to improve the robustness of the network. The EndoSLAM dataset , an external dataset with ground truth for camera pose, was used to validate the proposed modifications. The proposed camera pose estimation network achieved the best results on endoscopic videos compared with other published methods. A novel anatomical colon segment classification algorithm was devised. Utilizing the estimated location index, a colon segment template that represents the relative length of each anatomical colon segment over the entire colon is constructed. With a new colonoscopy video, anatomical colon segment classification can be performed by estimating the location index and referencing the constructed colon template. The colon segment can not only be used to provide anatomical contextual information but also to evaluate the accuracy of the localization system. The proposed localization system was applied to colon-oscopy videos collected from routine practice and validated using colon segments manually annotated by experienced gastroenterologists. The performance of the colon segment classification was compared with other methods. An additional metric was calculated using data from ScopeGuide®®{}^{\\textrm{\\textregistered}} (Olympus Corporation, https://www.olympus-global.com/), which can provide approximate length information of the inserted scope into the colon. The location index derived from ScopeGuide length was compared with the location index estimated from the proposed localization system. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first time that a localization system has been proposed and evaluated on colonoscopy videos from routine practice.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: surface by colonoscopy is particularly important in IBD, where disease severity assessment and monitoring of treatment effectiveness are heavily dependent on the findings of repeated colonoscopies [ref]27  .
