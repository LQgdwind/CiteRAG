      "content": "Paper Title: 3D Receiver for Molecular Communications in Internet of Organoids\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA BioFET consists of a recognition unit, a transducer, and a processing unit, as illustrated in Figure 1(a). Information molecules propagate in the MC channel and approach the recognition unit. When ligands reach the gate area, receptors identify and bind with the appropriate ligands. The transducer then converts this signal, originally encoded in the concentration of information molecules, into an electrical potential[ref]17. The potential generated at the gate is proportional to the accumulated ligands. Upon applying a potential difference to the drain and source, a current flows through them. This gate potential modulates the channel’s conductance, resulting in varying current levels. Figure 1(b) depicts the conceptual 3D FinFET MC receiver we propose, where all three sides of the SiNW channel are covered with receptors. For the FinFET-based receiver, due to its unique 3D structure, using the original MOSFET (2D) based current equation and transconductance equation will no longer be an accurate estimation. FinFET improves the control of the gates over the MOSFET channel as the gate voltage is applied from the top and sides. To better understand the structure, Figure 2(a) shows a cross-sectional view of the proposed device along the channel length. To more accurately quantify the location within the channel, we define the source and the drain that are at y=0𝑦0y=0 and y=ye​f​f𝑦subscript𝑦𝑒𝑓𝑓y=y_{eff}, respectively, where ye​f​fsubscript𝑦𝑒𝑓𝑓y_{eff} is the effective channel length. The front and back interfaces between S​i​N​W−S​i​O2𝑆𝑖𝑁𝑊𝑆𝑖subscript𝑂2SiNW-SiO_{2} are defined as x=0𝑥0x=0 and x=ts𝑥subscript𝑡𝑠x=t_{s} where tssubscript𝑡𝑠t_{s} represents the thickness of SiNW. The front and back oxide thicknesses are to​x​fsubscript𝑡𝑜𝑥𝑓t_{oxf} and to​x​bsubscript𝑡𝑜𝑥𝑏t_{oxb}. The cross-sectional view along the channel width is shown in Figure 2(b). Two S​i−S​i​O2𝑆𝑖𝑆𝑖subscript𝑂2Si-SiO_{2} interfaces are located in z=0𝑧0z=0 and z=W𝑧𝑊z=W. to​x​wsubscript𝑡𝑜𝑥𝑤t_{oxw} is the side wall oxide thickness. In our model, we assume the source and the body are perfectly grounded. For simplicity, we assume to​x​f=to​x​w=to​xsubscript𝑡𝑜𝑥𝑓subscript𝑡𝑜𝑥𝑤subscript𝑡𝑜𝑥t_{oxf}=t_{oxw}=t_{ox}. Therefore, the area of functionalized surface, i.e., Arsubscript𝐴𝑟A_{r} can be approximated as where Le​f​fsubscript𝐿𝑒𝑓𝑓L_{eff} is the effective length of the channel in y direction. Assume the width of oxide layer is negligible compared to the height of the channel. The threshold voltage, Vtsubscript𝑉𝑡V_{t}, is a key parameter for FET-based transistors. In many previous works on modeling FET-based receivers, the threshold voltage has not been taken into account[ref]17, . The threshold voltage of a long-channel n-type FinFET is expressed as where Vf​bsubscript𝑉𝑓𝑏V_{fb} is the flat-band voltage, k𝑘k is the Boltzmann constant, T𝑇T is the temperature in Kelvin. nisubscript𝑛𝑖n_{i} is the intrinsic carrier concentration and NAsubscript𝑁𝐴N_{A} is the doping concentration. q is the charge of an electron, εS​i​N​Wsubscript𝜀𝑆𝑖𝑁𝑊\\varepsilon_{SiNW} and εo​xsubscript𝜀𝑜𝑥\\varepsilon_{ox} are the permittivity of SiNW and oxide, respectively. For most tri-gate FinFET (similar structure as in Figure 1(b)), ts>Wsubscript𝑡𝑠𝑊t_{s}>W. With this simplification, most of the current flows along the side gates. Therefore, the effective width of the device becomes We​f​f=W+ts×2subscript𝑊𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑊subscript𝑡𝑠2W_{eff}=W+t_{s}\\times 2, and hence, the drain current Idsubscript𝐼𝑑I_{d}, in FinFET can be found by where μ𝜇\\mu is the carrier mobility, qi​ssubscript𝑞𝑖𝑠q_{is} and qi​dsubscript𝑞𝑖𝑑q_{id} are the inversion sheet charge density at source and drain, respectively , which can be obtained by where Vgsubscript𝑉𝑔V_{g} is the gate voltage, Vssubscript𝑉𝑠V_{s} and Vdsubscript𝑉𝑑V_{d} are the source and drain potential, respectively\n.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: receptors identify and bind with the appropriate ligands.
