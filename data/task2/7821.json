      "content": "Paper Title: Noise-tolerant learnability of shallow quantum circuits from statistics and the cost of quantum pseudorandomness\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuantum Statistical Query oracles: Quantum statistical query (QSQ) oracles have previously been studied for the task of learning quantum states¬† [ref]14  and quantum processes¬†  . Recently, a new multi-copy QSQ oracle was introduced in¬†. Expanding on these definitions, we propose two new quantum statistical query oracles. First, we define a multi-copy quantum statistical query oracle for the task of learning a quantum process. With this oracle, we allow the learner to query a kùëòk-register state, to which kùëòk-copies of the process are applied in parallel, followed by a simultaneous measurement over the kùëòk registers. The learner is allowed to query states that are entangled across the kùëòk registers and perform entangled measurements across the registers. This oracle allows us to model learners that have stronger capabilities compared to the single-copy setting for processes but are still restricted compared to general black-box learners. An interesting feature of this oracle is that one can use it to model learners with bounded memory. Next, we introduce a QSQ oracle for learning an observable. Here, one queries the unknown observable with a state and receives an approximation of the expectation value. This oracle can be viewed as modelling the behaviour of an unknown quantum apparatus that takes copies of a state, performs some measurements and returns a classical expectation value. In this context, the task of learning the unknown observable is equivalent to identifying the physical quantity the apparatus measures and can be used for benchmarking its behaviour.\n\n\nNoise-tolerance of QPSQ learners: The main motivation behind statistical query learning in the classical learning theory setting has been to provide a framework to study learnability robust to classification noise. The need for developing robust learners is even more crucial in the quantum setting, particularly in the near-term. In this direction, the robustness of QSQ learners for quantum states to various kinds of noise was shown in¬†. We extend this argument to the QSQ oracle for processes (QPSQ), by showing that learners with access to this oracle are robust to general noise models, as long as the noise is within an acceptable threshold. Further, we show that for many physically relevant types of noise, there is an efficient method to estimate the deviation of the noisy channel from the noiseless one. This method only uses a single 2-copy QPSQ query. Building upon existing no-go results, we argue that one cannot perform such an estimation using a single-copy oracle, making the use of the 2-copy oracle optimal. Our results on the natural noise tolerance and our noise-estimation method together provide a framework for developing and studying robust learning algorithms.\n\n\nQPSQ learner for shallow quantum circuits: Due to their importance in the near term, we focus on learning shallow quantum circuits. We study the learning algorithm for constant-depth quantum circuits proposed in¬†[ref]5, and show that with a slight overhead and some modifications, this algorithm can be carried out using only access to the ùñ∞ùñØùñ≤ùóçùñ∫ùóçùñ∞ùñØùñ≤ùóçùñ∫ùóç\\mathsf{QPStat} oracle. Along with our framework for developing robust algorithms, this implies a way of ensuring that the algorithm from¬†[ref]5 can be implemented in a robust manner, by using a higher number of samples to simulate the statistical queries.\n\n\nLower bounds for learning logarithmic-to-linear depth random quantum circuits: Here, we show an average-case query-complexity lower bound for learning quantum circuits with depth in the logarithmic to linear regime. In comparison to the lower bound in¬†[ref]5, which showed worst-case hardness for log-depth circuits, our result shows that on average, one might be able to develop efficient learning algorithms at this depth. Our lower bound scales exponentially with the depth, providing a nice characterization of the learnability of shallow quantum circuits with respect to their depth. At higher depths, such random quantum circuits form approximate unitary 222-designs, for which query complexity lower bounds were shown in¬†. Thus, our learning algorithm for constant depth, lower bound for log-to-linear depths, and the previous lower bound for higher depths provide a complete characterization of the learnability of random quantum circuits from statistical queries.\n\n\nHardness of threshold search and implications for learnability of shallow circuits: Arunachalam et al.¬†[ref]14 showed the hardness of shadow tomography of quantum states with statistical queries in the worst-case. The best-known algorithm for shadow tomography with access to copies of the unknown state from¬† solves the problem of threshold search as a subroutine. Given a QSQ algorithm for threshold search, we show that one can solve shadow tomography with an efficient overhead in the queries. As a result, we obtain the worst-case hardness of threshold search with quantum statistical queries. We remark on the implications of this result on the algorithm for learning bounded-gate unitaries from¬†[ref]4. While this algorithm from¬†[ref]4 is computationally inefficient, it has the best-known sample complexity for learning constant-depth circuits in the black-box access setting. The algorithm works by carrying out quantum hypothesis selection over the elements of a covering-net. The known algorithms for quantum hypothesis selection due to¬†[ref]4  solve either threshold search or shadow tomography as a subroutine. Thus, using the hardness results for shadow tomography and threshold search, we conjecture that the algorithm of¬†[ref]4 does not admit an efficient statistical query analogue in the worst case.\n\n\nCost of quantum pseudorandomness:\nAlongside a learning algorithm for constant-depth circuits, Huang et al.¬†[ref]5 show an algorithm for verifying the output of their learning algorithm within an average distance da‚Äãv‚Äãgsubscriptùëëùëéùë£ùëîd_{avg}. By extending the quantum no-free lunch theorem from¬†, we show the average-case hardness of learning unitaries over the Haar measure with black-box access within bounded da‚Äãv‚Äãgsubscriptùëëùëéùë£ùëîd_{avg}. Thus, we use the learner and verifier from¬†[ref]5 in a black-box manner to construct a distinguisher between Haar random unitaries and unitaries implementable by constant-depth circuits. As a result, we prove that constant-depth circuits cannot form pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs).\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: Quantum Statistical Query oracles: Quantum statistical query (QSQ) oracles have previously been studied for the task of learning quantum states¬† [ref]14  and quantum processes¬†  .
