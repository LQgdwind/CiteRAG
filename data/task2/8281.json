Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

We do not go into detail here, as these approaches work differently from our algorithm; for an overview, we refer to the related work section in¬†[ref]44. A recent complete algorithm is the QSMA algorithm¬† implemented in yicesQS. It maintains for every quantified subformula Q‚Äãy.œÜ‚Äã(x1,‚Ä¶,xn,y)formulae-sequenceùëÑùë¶ùúësubscriptùë•1‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùëõùë¶Qy.\\varphi(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n},y) (where Q‚àà{‚àÉ,‚àÄ}ùëÑfor-allQ\\in\\{\\exists,\\forall\\}) an over- and under-approximation (encoded as formulas in the free variables x1,‚Ä¶,xn,ysubscriptùë•1‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùëõùë¶x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n},y of œÜùúë\\varphi) which are refined iteratively in a breadth-first search manner. This refinement continues until these approximations are fine-grained enough to conclude satisfiability or unsatisfiability. The required approximations can be generated by NLSAT-based solvers. For quantifier elimination, mentionable tools implementing CAD that are readily available include QEPCAD¬†B¬†   and Redlog¬†. In particular, the former applies various techniques to reduce the number of projection polynomials in the CAD used to construct the solution formulas, which is often coarser than the result of naive CAD algorithms.\nFurthermore, the commercial tools Maple¬† and Mathematica¬† implement the CAD for quantifier elimination. We refer to the respective sources for more details.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: To decide sentences including quantifiers, the z3 and cvc5 solvers implement approaches based on quantifier instantiation¬† [ref]44  [ref]27 which are incomplete for non-linear real arithmetic.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
