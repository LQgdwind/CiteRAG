      "content": "Paper Title: Benchmarking Parallelism in FaaS Platforms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the path to make the cloud more accessible, new services appear to abstract application developers from the underlying infrastructure.\nServerless architectures are the newest development in this line with the objective to eliminate servers from the developer concerns.\nServerless computing is mainly represented by Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms.\nThis “cloud functions” model has clear benefits: users do not manage servers or resources and only provide their code to the cloud, where it is automatically handled and executed on demand.\nTo peak simplicity, user code is provided as code snippets or functions, with a focused purpose, that can run anywhere.\nEven better, users only pay for individual invocations of those functions, with execution time accounted for at millisecond level. FaaS has picked the interest of many applications due to its simplicity.\nOne of such applications is highly-parallel computing jobs.\nElastic scale and on-demand resource availability look like a good substrate to run embarrassingly parallel tasks at scale.\nConsequently, it motivated the appearance of several research and industry projects that adopt FaaS to run highly-parallel jobs.\nOn a first take, the “Occupy the cloud”  and ExCamera papers  demonstrated inspiring results from using FaaS for data analytics applications.\nOn their basis, several works  [ref]4    evolved on the idea of running compute-intensive parallel workloads on cloud functions and showed interesting results against traditional IaaS cluster computation.\nSome papers [ref]8 [ref]9 0 analyze these efforts and focus on the challenges and viability to run data analytics workloads on FaaS platforms.\nTheir conclusions show enticing results despite some issues (e.g., they discuss open challenges such as cost efficiency and statefulness).\nIn sum, they convey that FaaS platforms are a good fit for data-processing parallel applications . In parallel computing, many compute-intensive tasks or processes are executed simultaneously.\nSimultaneity is important since these tasks usually collaborate.\nData analytics jobs, linear algebra, and iterative machine learning training algorithms are some examples.\nThis requires a set of very specific properties in terms of resources, scale, and latency that allow to run all tasks at the same time without interleaving for compelling performance.\nIndeed, the information presented on the above papers shows that parallel applications on FaaS only make sense when the platform provides the necessary properties to enable their parallelism.\nHowever, they do not investigate them. Simple function concurrency is not enough if each function invocation does not get its full isolated resources (we refer to each unit of resources as function instance).\nOtherwise, computation faces throttling and resource interference and becomes too slow and expensive compared to traditional clusters.\nIn fact, most works on parallel computing atop FaaS presuppose that function invocations will run simultaneously, each on isolated resources    .\nConsequently, the FaaS service must be able to provide enough resources at low enough latency to run all invocations in parallel. However, all the aforementioned works base their arguments exclusively on the performance of AWS Lambda.\nWhile AWS seems to provide compelling values for the discussed properties  1, they are not included in the simple FaaS definition of cloud functions that we presented above (e.g. 2).\nThe properties are, in fact, particular of each implementation of the FaaS model and usually detailed on each platform’s documentation.\nStill, cloud-offered FaaS platforms do not guarantee any of them: there are no service-level agreements (SLA) for these properties.\nMore so, while function resources, timeouts, or even concurrency are clearly described by every platform, parallelism is not carefully addressed by any of them. This raises an important question: do current FaaS platforms fit parallel computations?\nAnd also: what makes some FaaS platform a better fit for parallel applications than the others?\nSeveral benchmarking papers 3 1 4 5 compare different FaaS platforms.\nThese papers indicate that indeed not all services provide the same properties.\nUnfortunately, existing literature approaches FaaS platforms from a high-level user perspective.\nThey tackle use cases that resemble the IO-bound, reactive applications FaaS is prepared for, and focus on properties such as latency, cold start, cost, and configuration capabilities.\nSome go beyond and explore elasticity with extra detail.\nHowever, they tackle elasticity as the ability to quickly handle dynamic workloads and disregard actual parallelism and the implications of the FaaS platform architecture.\nWhile this methodology is logical due to the black-box nature of the platforms, it does not allow to evaluate their suitability for highly-parallel, compute-intensive applications.\nIndeed, understanding why each platform behaves as it does when dealing with parallelism requires a deeper knowledge on their architecture.\nAnd existing literature does not provide a detailed view of the architectures and management approaches of each platform, neither none of them tackle parallel computations in detail. To address this, in this paper we carefully investigate the parallel performance of the four major cloud FaaS platforms.\nNamely, we analyze the architecture and performance of AWS Lambda (AWS), Azure Functions (Azure), Google Cloud Functions (GCP), and IBM Cloud Functions (IBM).\nWe especially focus on details that would affect the ability of the services to provide a good substrate for highly-parallel computations.\nFirst, we describe and analyze the design of each service based on available information.\nWe are interested in how functions are managed, the virtualization technology used, how invocations are scheduled and their approach to scale, the management of resources, and other components that directly affect parallelism.\nTo organize all these traits, we build a comparative framework that helps the description and posterior discussion on the differences between platforms.\nSecond, we perform an experiment that allows to clearly visualize the parallelism of executions in a FaaS platform.111\nThe experiment code and results are accessible at https://github.com/danielBCN/faas-parallelism-benchmark, including extra plots.\n\nThe experiment runs a job split into several function invocations (tasks) and produces plots with their execution timeline, drawing a complete view of the parallelism achieved.\nCombined with the information from their architectures, this visualization allows us to understand when new resources (function instances) are allocated to process function invocations, and whether resources are used simultaneously to handle different invocations in parallel.\nWe can also see if this scheduling and resource management affects the performance of parallel tasks, such as by throttling invocations or by sharing resources across invocations (interleaving them). Our objective is hence to understand their performance, and be able to spot bottlenecks, limitations, and other issues that can severely influence applications.\nIn sum, we want to categorize characteristics of each service that must be considered and may help users understand the different platforms to choose the one that better fits their needs. This paper makes the following contributions: We present a detailed architectural analysis of the four major FaaS platforms: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, and IBM Cloud Functions.\nWe categorize their design through a comparative framework with special focus on parallelism.\nTwo traits importantly influence parallelism of the platforms: virtualization technology and scheduling approach. We perform a detailed experiment to reveal invocation scheduling and parallelism on each platform.\nThe experiment consists in running several function invocations concurrently and gather as much information as possible to draw a comprehensive timeline of the execution.\nThis visualizes the parallelism achieved and reveals issues. We analyze the information gathered for the different platforms and their affinity to parallel computations.\nGenerally, lighter virtualization technologies and proactive scheduling improve parallelism thanks to faster elasticity and finer resource allocation.\nThus, platforms like AWS and IBM resolve parallel computations more satisfactorily than Azure, where our experiment only reaches a parallel degree of 11%percent1111\\%. Section 2 summarizes the related work on benchmarking FaaS platforms.\nSection 3 details the architectures of the analyzed FaaS platforms.\nSection 4 describes our experimentation and Sections 5 through 8 present its results.\nFinally, we discuss the overall results in Section 10 and close in Section 11.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: run highly-parallel jobs.\nOn a first take, the “Occupy the cloud”  and ExCamera papers  demonstrated inspiring results from using FaaS for data analytics applications.\nOn their basis, several works  [ref]4    evolved on the idea of running compute-intensive parallel workloads on cloud functions and showed interesting results against traditional IaaS cluster computation.\nSome papers [ref]8 [ref]9\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
