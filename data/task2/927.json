      "content": "Paper Title: Bongard-LOGO: A New Benchmark for Human-Level Concept Learning and Reasoning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHuman visual cognition, a key feature of human intelligence, reflects\nthe ability to learn new concepts from a few examples and use the acquired concepts in diverse ways. In recent years, deep learning approaches have achieved tremendous success on standard visual recognition benchmarks  . In contrast to human concept learning, data-driven approaches to machine perception have to be trained on massive datasets and their abilities to reuse acquired concepts in new situations are bounded by the training data . For this reason, researchers in cognitive science and artificial intelligence (AI) have attempted\nto bridge the chasm between human-level visual cognition and machine-based pattern recognition. The hope is to develop the next generation of computing paradigms that capture innate abilities of humans in visual concept learning and reasoning, such as few-shot learning [ref]4 [ref]5, compositional reasoning  [ref]7, and symbolic abstraction  . The deficiency of standard pattern recognition techniques has been pinpointed by interdisciplinary scientists in the past several decades  0. Over fifty years ago, M. M. Bongard, a Russian computer scientist, invented a collection of one hundred human-designed visual recognition tasks, now named the Bongard Problems (BPs) 1, to demonstrate the gap between high-level human cognition and computerized pattern recognition.\nSeveral attempts have been made in tackling the BPs with classic AI tools 2 3, but to date we have yet to see a method capable of solving a substantial portion of the problem set.\nBPs demand a high-level of concept learning and reasoning that is goal-oriented, context-dependent, and analogical 4, challenging the objectivism (e.g., image classification by hyperplanes) embraced by traditional pattern recognition approaches 4 5.\nTherefore, they\nhave been long known in the AI research community as an inspirational challenge for visual cognition. However, the original BPs are not amenable to today’s data-driven visual recognition techniques, as this problem set is too small to train the state-of-the-art machine learning methods.\n In this work, we introduce Bongard-LOGO, a new benchmark for human-level visual concept learning and reasoning, directly inspired by the design principles behind the BPs. This new benchmark consists of 12,000 problem instances. The large scale of the benchmark makes it digestible by advanced machine learning methods in modern AI. To enable the scalable generation of Bongard-style problems, we develop a program-guided shape generation technique to produce human-interpretable visual pattern recognition problems in action-oriented LOGO language 6, where each visual pattern is generated by executing a sequence of program instructions.\nThese problems are designed to capture the key properties of human cognition exhibited in original BPs, including\n1) context-dependent perception, in which the same object may have fundamentally different interpretations given different contexts; 2) analogy-making perception, in which some meaningful concepts are traded off for other meaningful concepts; and 3) perception with a few samples but infinite vocabulary.\nThese three properties together distinguish our benchmark from previous concept learning datasets that centered around standard recognition tasks  [ref]7 7 8. In our experiments,\nwe formulate this task as a few-shot concept learning problem [ref]4 [ref]5 and tackle it with the state-of-the-art\nmeta-learning 9 0 1 2 3 and abstract reasoning 7 algorithms. We find that all the models have significantly fallen short of human-level performances. This large performance gap between machine and human implies a failure of today’s pattern recognition systems in capturing the core properties of human cognition. We perform both ablation studies and systematic analysis of the failure modes in different learning-based approaches. For example, the ability of learning to learn might be crucial for generalizing well to new concepts, as meta-learning methods largely outperform other approaches in our benchmark. Besides, each type of meta-learning methods has its preferred generalization tasks, according to their different performances on our test sets.\nFinally, we discuss potential research frontiers of building computational architectures for high-level visual cognition, driven by tackling the Bongard-LOGO challenge.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: pattern recognition.
