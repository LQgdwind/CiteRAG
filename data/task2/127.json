Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

For each data set, we built and evaluated one\ndeep learning model.\nThe MNIST data set consists of 28‚Äãx‚Äã2828ùë•2828x28 pixel\ngray-scale images of handwritten numerical digits with a training and test set\nof 60K and 10K images, respectively. We trained the six\nlayer neural network depicted in Figure¬†2. This model\nis a based on LeNet-5¬†[ref]30 for classifying MNIST data set with added batch-normalization after every layer. Galaxy Zoo2¬† is a public catalog of\n‚àº240,000similar-toabsent240000\\sim 240,000 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey¬† with classifications\nfrom citizen scientists. The Galaxy Zoo decision tree¬†[ref]11 lists the questions answered by citizen\nscientists. We took a subset of this data set to classify images that appear edge-on vs face-on (question T01 in¬†[ref]11).\nThe training and test data sets consist of 54,3335433354,333 and 211821182118 images, respectively,\neach a 69‚Äãx‚Äã6969ùë•6969x69 color image. We trained a model depicted in Figure¬†3, which is a\nvariation of the model from¬†. In our variation of this model, we reduced the number of dropout layers\nand added batch normalization after every convolutional layer. We achieved 99%percent9999\\% accuracy on\nthe test set and an overall weighted F1 score of 0.990.990.99. We trained the models and extract activations from them using the\nTensorFlow¬† library. For both models, we used the representation from the last hidden\nlayer to drive our sampling technique, and\nthe last hidden layer was a fully connected (FC) layer. The MNIST data representation\nis from layer FC-2 (Figure¬†2) with 84 neurons. The\nGalaxy Zoo2 data representation is from layer FC-1\n(Figure¬†3) with 64 neurons.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: We evaluated our sampling techniques on\ntwo data sets, Galaxy Zoo2¬† and MNIST¬†[ref]36.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
