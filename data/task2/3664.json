Another common problem is determining the number of PEs for a CNN accelerator (be it spiking or non-spiking). Most implementations like SIES  or ASIE [ref]19 deploy a PE array where its ideal size is the size of the 2D fmap that has to be processed. However, the fmap sizes in CNNs change from model to model and from layer to layer. This fact makes maximizing the efficiency of such PE arrays very difficult. This problem of diminishing dimensions is discussed in more detail by Chen et al. . We argue that one dimension is fixed for the most parts of established CNN architectures: the kernel size. Szegedy et al. argue that convolutions with filters sizes larger than 3×3333\\times 3 “might not be generally useful as they can always be reduced into a sequence of 3×3333\\times 3 filters” [ref]33. Simonyan and Zisserman [ref]34 argue that, for example, two 3×3333\\times 3 convolutional layer have more discriminative power than a single 5×5555\\times 5 layer as the former incorporates two non-linearities while the latter only includes one.\nThus, it comes with no surprise that established, well performing architectures like ResNet , Inception-V3 [ref]33 or MobileNet  all deploy 3×3333\\times 3 kernels for the vast majority of their architecture. For this reason, the proposed architecture is optimized for 3×3333\\times 3 kernels while 1×1111\\times 1 kernels for pointwise layers are also possible. Nevertheless, the techniques discussed here can also be generalized to other kernel sizes.\nThe core idea of this architecture is to employ less PEs but to constantly keep them busy. To ensure that the PEs run at maximum capacity, spikes are represented as address events that are compressed into queues. As soon as all spikes of a queue are processed, the next queue is selected. This allows the processing time to scale with the number of spike events and results in self-timed execution of the SNN. We start by providing a top-level overview of the hardware architecture and then proceed to show how it can be implemented efficiently on either FPGAs or ASICs.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: then highly underutilized due to spike sparsity.
