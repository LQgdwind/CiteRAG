      "content": "Paper Title: Sampling from exponential distributions in the time domain with superparamagnetic tunnel junctions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProbabilistic computing   is a modern computing paradigm inspired by the statistical physics of interacting bodies, such as gas molecules in a box , metal atoms during an annealing process , or magnetic moments in a ferromagnetic material . Various combinatorial optimization problems with real-world utility can be solved by formulating the constraints of the problem into an objective function, which is analogous to the energy landscape of a physical system . The objective function mathematically describes the interactions between participating bodies in configuration space. The configuration that minimizes this objective function corresponds to the solution . Probabilistic computing encodes the configuration space of such problems in probabilistic bits, also known as pp-bits, each of which can take one of two binary values, 0 or 1, but do so stochastically. Probabilistic bits interact through carefully engineered electrical interactions, which implement the objective function to be minimized. The generality of being able to write objective functions for a wide variety of problems such as prime factorization , reversible Boolean gates [ref]7, circuit satisfiability , probabilistic inference [ref]9, machine learning with Boltzmann machines 0, traveling salesman problems 1, optimal control 2, and many others 3 indicates the broad scope and the potential usefulness of probabilistic computers. The performance of such systems depends on the performance of its two constituent functional blocks, one that allows sampling of pp-bits from application-constrained distributions and one that mediates the interaction between them. Though modern computing systems possess both of these functional units, such as on-chip physical random number generators 4 5 and Boolean computing units, they cannot be efficiently implemented at the scale and granularity required to perform meaningful probabilistic computations for real-world applications. Some of these applications require upwards of 101210^{12} random bits per second 0. To address these challenges, recent work in the field has relied on novel device technologies to sample large quantities of random bits from device-specific distributions while using the reconfigurability and granularity of modern field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to implement the interaction circuits 0 [ref]9 . Though this approach is suitable for exploring application space, the ultimate goal of orders of magnitude increases in computing performance will require integrated implementations. Integrated hardware accelerators of this kind require careful co-design between various levels of the computing stack such as integration of novel device technologies in the back-end-of-the-line, efficient circuits for sampling random bits, and mapping of problems onto scalable architectures 6. Fortunately, one novel device technology, superparamagnetic magnetic tunnel junctions,\n(SMTJs) 7, which has been widely\nused for probabilistic computing 8 [ref]7 , consists of a low-barrier version of a mature, scalable, and integrable memory technology and has the potential to meet all of the aforementioned needs. A simplified description of the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) device stack consists of two ferromagnetic layers separated by an insulating tunneling barrier. The resistance of the stack depends on the relative orientations of the ferromagnetic layer magnetizations: parallel magnetizations (P) have lower resistance, and antiparallel magnetizations (AP) have higher resistance 9. The resistance state can be measured with a small read-current and can be switched via an applied magnetic field or a larger write-current. For long-term storage (≈10\\approx 10 years), the energy barrier between states needs to be ≥40​k​T\\geq 40~kT, where kk is the Boltzmann constant and T=300T=300 K is room temperature 0 1. If the barrier is reduced, the retention time drops exponentially, until the device begins to exhibit random telegraph fluctuations at the millisecond or smaller time scales at room temperature 7 2 3 4. In this regime, the device is said to be in a superparamagnetic state. Small currents applied across a superparamagnetic tunnel junction (SMTJ) can both probe the stochastic device state as a voltage and also tune the mean time the device spends in each state. Both of these properties are exploited in implementations of pp-bit circuits 2  1. Previous proposals and demonstrations of probabilistic computing systems employ the aforementioned instantaneous measurement of the SMTJ state as a source of random bits. Even though the measured voltage itself is an analog quantity that exhibits a bimodal distribution 5, the thresholded digital output voltages are very good approximations of samples from a Bernoulli distribution with probability pp of getting a true outcome. By changing the current flowing through the SMTJ, the value of pp can be varied. Most commonly, SMTJs are biased to their balanced state, where the probability p≈0.5p\\approx 0.5 7. Most recent FPGA 0 [ref]9  and microprocessor-based 1 implementations use digitized versions of such SMTJs as entropy sources to seed probabilistic computations. The dwell time statistics 5 of the random telegraph fluctuations observed in SMTJ devices reveal a computationally relevant  0 yet underutilized stochastic distribution, i.e., the exponential distribution. The exponential distribution, characterized by a rate parameter, is ubiquitous in physical systems and central to any Markovian description of evolution through state space. The memoryless nature of Markovian state transitions means that the additional time spent in the current state is independent of time already spent in it. Exponential distributions are also central to any energy-based objective function description since the Boltzmann distribution that describes the occupancy of the states at equilibrium is an exponential function of their energies 6. This property is exploited in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, by accepting transitions to higher energy states with a probability proportional to an exponential function of the difference in energies . Exponential distributions can also be used to generate weighted random samples by selecting the argument of the smallest drawn sample from a set of exponential variates, a technique known as the “exponential clocks method” 7. This can be used to generate arbitrarily weighted random samples, akin to rolling an arbitrarily biased nn-sided die. In spite of their usefulness for probabilistic computations, sampling techniques based on the Bernoulli distribution of instantaneous states cannot extract exponential distributions from SMTJ dynamics without significant memory and computational overhead, since the exponential distributions reside in the temporal characteristics, not state distributions, of SMTJ switching events. In this work, we leverage the memoryless property of MTJ switching and design a circuit aimed at drawing samples from an exponential distribution by measuring the temporal statistics of the first switching event of an MTJ when exposed to a current step. As shown in Fig. 1(a,b), the MTJ is first biased to be in the parallel state just outside the superparamagnetic regime (on experimentally relevant time scales). Subsequently, a current step is applied, putting the MTJ in a superparamagnetic regime where there is eventually a transition to the antiparallel state after a probabilistic delay that depends on the magnitude of the current step. The time elapsed before this switching event occurs (shown in Fig. 1(c)) is measured with embedded electronics and is then used to demonstrate the exponential switching characteristics of this probabilistic delay cell (PDC). The experiment is repeated approximately 10,000 times for each current step to ensure good statistical evaluation of the mean dwell time. By creating switching events that are temporally encoded and drawn from an exponential distribution, we can utilize this delay cell alongside other temporal computing primitives to make Boolean decisions based on the arrival times of both deterministic and stochastic temporal signals. We extend this approach to the “exponential clocks method” and propose a circuit to draw weighted random samples from arbitrary distributions. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the circuit and the experimental setup used to interrogate the device and collect data. Section III describes the statistical properties of the first switching event and its tunability with current. Section IV describes how these circuits can be used in applications such as a Metropolis-Hastings stepper and a weighted random sampler, followed by a discussion in Sec. V.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: implement the objective function to be minimized.
