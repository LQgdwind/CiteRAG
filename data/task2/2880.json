      "content": "Paper Title: Path Regularization: A Convexity and Sparsity Inducing Regularization for Parallel ReLU Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nParallel neural networks were previously investigated by  [ref]23. Although these studies provided insights into the solutions, they require impractical assumptions, e.g., sparsity among sub-networks in Theorem 1 of [ref]23) and linear activations and hinge loss assumptions in . Recently,  studied weight decay regularized two-layer ReLU network training problems and introduced polynomial-time trainable convex formulations. However, their analysis is restricted to standard two-layer ReLU networks, i.e., in the form of fθ​(𝐗)=(𝐗𝐖1)+​𝐰2subscript𝑓𝜃𝐗subscriptsubscript𝐗𝐖1subscript𝐰2f_{\\theta}({\\bf X})=\\left({\\bf X}\\mathbf{W}_{1}\\right)_{+}\\mathbf{w}_{2}. The reasons for this restriction is that handling more than one ReLU layer is a substantially more challenging optimization problem. As an example, a direct extension of  to three-layer NNs will yield doubly exponential complexity, i.e., 𝒪​(nr​nr)𝒪superscript𝑛𝑟superscript𝑛𝑟\\mathcal{O}(n^{rn^{r}}) for a rank-r𝑟r data matrix, due to the combinatorial behavior of multiple ReLU layers. Thus, they only examined the case with a single ReLU layer (see Table 1 for details and references in ). Additionally, since they only considered standard two-layer ReLU networks, their analysis is not valid for a broader range of NN-based architectures as detailed in Remark 1. Later on,  extended this approach to three-layer ReLU networks. However, since they analyzed ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-norm regularized training problem, they had to put unit Frobenius norm constraints on the first layer weights, which does not reflect the settings in practice. In addition, their analysis is restricted to the networks with a single neuron in the second layer (i.e. m2=1subscript𝑚21m_{2}=1) that is in the form of fθ​(𝐗)=∑k((𝐗𝐖1​k)+​𝐰2​k)+​w3​ksubscript𝑓𝜃𝐗subscript𝑘subscriptsubscriptsubscript𝐗𝐖1𝑘subscript𝐰2𝑘subscript𝑤3𝑘f_{\\theta}({\\bf X})=\\sum_{k}\\left(\\left({\\bf X}\\mathbf{W}_{1k}\\right)_{+}\\mathbf{w}_{2k}\\right)_{+}w_{3k}. Since this architecture only allows a single neuron in the second layer, each sub-network k𝑘k has an expressive power that is equivalent to a standard two-layer network rather than three-layer. This can also be realized from the definition of the constraint set 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} in Theorem 1. Specifically, the convex set 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} in  has decoupled constraints across the hidden layer index j1subscript𝑗1j_{1} whereas our formulation sums the responses over hidden neurons before feeding through the next layer as standard deep networks do. Therefore, this analysis does not reflect the true power of deep networks with L>2𝐿2L>2. Moreover, the approach in  has exponential complexity when the data matrix has full rank, which is unavoidable. However, we analyze deep neural networks in (1) without any assumption on the weights. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm which has fully polynomial-time complexity in data dimensions and prove strong global optimality guarantees for this algorithm in Theorem 2.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: Parallel neural networks were previously investigated by  [ref]23.
