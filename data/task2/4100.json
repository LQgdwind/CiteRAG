      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Attention-based Representations from Multiple Patterns for Relation Prediction in Knowledge Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost current distributional methods for learning KGs induce entity embeddings based only on their direct neighbors¬†[ref]13  , neglecting that the triples where entities appear are part of a much richer structure (the KG itself). In the following, we revisit methods with similar motivation as ours: entities are likely to be better represented when contextual information is incorporated into the learning process; hence, one may reach better predictive results to complete the KGs. We also review some recent approaches that rely on attention mechanisms over knowledge graphs representation. Finally, as √ÜMP incorporates the message-passing mechanism, commonly used in graph neural networks, we also bring attention to some of those methods in this section. Entities Context.\nLuo¬†et al.¬† pioneered the generation of context-dependent entity embeddings by learning contextual connectivity patterns from 1-hop neighborhood of entities. Later, Oh¬†et al.¬† proposed context-aware embeddings by jointly learning from an entity and its multi-hop neighborhood. Both approaches only adopt the entities‚Äô neighbors‚Äô representations as context, neglecting the semantics of the relationships between neighbors. In contrast, we build √ÜMP upon Wang¬†et al.¬†[ref]26, which addressed entities‚Äô local context from a message-passing scheme to learn entities kùëòk-hop neighborhood based on the aggregation of graph‚Äôs edges. However, although the message-passing scheme holds the potential to acquire entities‚Äô local structures, [ref]26 equally weights the neighbors within the aggregation process. Thus, in this paper, we also benefit from the message-passing scheme, yet we adopt an attention mechanism to focus on different aspects of the passed messages. With that, we weight the importance of each fact in the neighborhood for the final entity representation. Relational Paths.\nSeveral of previous works count with semantic composition among entities to add contextual information to KG‚Äôs embeddings, either in the form of constraints or as sequence of relations¬†[ref]27     . PTransE¬†[ref]27 extends the use of translation-based embeddings mechanisms¬†[ref]13 by including multiple-step relation paths between two entities. Gu¬†et al.¬† proposes additive and multiplicative compositions over relations while¬† leverages recurrent neural networks to consider relational paths of entities. Aiming at complex reasoning to populate KBs from texts, ¬† and  incorporate multiple paths built not only upon relations but also with other entities. More recently, Guo¬†et al.¬† also targeted at learning from relational paths by using a recurrent neural network with residual connections. √ÜMP also builds paths motivated by the semantic enrichment that one entity may provide to the others. However, we focus on message-passing schemas leveraged by different attention patterns to let the model find out during the learning which elements are more relevant to the embeddings and, consequently, the relation prediction task. Attention-based Embeddings.\nGAT¬† employs the concept of attention to learn representations from graph-based data. It computes attention weights over every other node (in the most general formulation) while not considering possible labeled relations between them. Here, besides allowing different views of attention over the nodes and edges, we aim at predicting relations in knowledge graphs. The first attempt to use attention-based mechanisms to predict missing entities in KGs was presented in . To capture distant entities‚Äô contributions, they relied on a relation composition mechanism that introduces auxiliary edges between neighbors in hops. Also, attention mechanisms are used to encode additional information within the learned representation¬† . √ÜMP, on the other hand, allows for local and global attention mechanisms to potentially focus on close and distant neighbors during the message-passing mechanism. Moreover, we include a random attention mechanism that potentially learns when to attend near and distant neighbors to predict missing relations. Selecting neighbors at random to proceed with the message passing introduces an indiscriminate bias once it bases itself on the sparse aspects of the node‚Äôs neighborhood. Graph Neural Networks.\nCommonly, Graph Neural Networks (GNN) methods follow the propagation-aggregation node-based message-passing paradigm over multi-hop neighbors¬†   . √ÜMP also follows the message-passing schema, yet the messages are passed along the edges to capture semantic relationships expressed on them. The entities‚Äô messages are aggregated from the relation representations that connect them. Previous approaches have also explored GNN to complete knowledge graphs, primarily focusing on link/entity prediction tasks. Several of them leverage on the local neighborhood context of entities only¬†    while here we explore global and random contexts besides the local neighborhood. There are many ways to explore local information. For instance,¬†Zhang et¬†al.  assume there is a hierarchical structure in the local neighborhood of an entity while ¬†Schlichtkrull et¬†al.  and ¬† extend Convolutional Neural Network to knowledge base completion by addressing the local context of nodes. ¬†Teru et¬†al.  also take advantage of a GNN framework yet assuming an entity-independent semantics to learn to predict relations to handle inductive reasoning problems. They built the learning framework upon several other approaches and offered a set of inductive relation prediction benchmarks to the community. Evolving √ÜMP to the inductive setting, particularly regarding the semantic paths component, is an appealing direction for the future.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Most current distributional methods for learning KGs induce entity embeddings based only on their direct neighbors¬†[ref]13  , neglecting that the triples where entities appear are part of a much richer structure (the KG itself).
