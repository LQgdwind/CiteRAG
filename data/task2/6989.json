      "content": "Paper Title: Create Your World: Lifelong Text-to-Image Diffusion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe conduct lifelong generation experiments on our proposed L2DM method and three representative baselines in personalized text-to-image generation, i.e., DreamBooth¬†[ref]29, Custom Diffusion¬†[ref]31 (termed as Custom in this paper) and SVDiff¬†[ref]32. Since there are currently no available methods that consider never-ending learning issues in text-to-image generation, we apply Fine-tuning (FT), LWF¬† and EWC¬† for each baseline in the lifelong learning setting. Both LWF¬† and EWC¬† are the representative lifelong learning methods. Meanwhile, it is unrealistic to employ the representative lifelong learning methods in DreamBooth¬†[ref]29 to achieve lifelong generation task, since catastrophic forgetting issue will destroy the whole diffusion model. We then apply LoRA, as the compared method instead in this paper. Specifically, we train 300 steps for Custom¬†[ref]31 in each task, 500 steps for SVDiff¬†[ref]32 and Ours, and 800 steps for DreamBooth¬†[ref]29. Futhermore, we apply a learning rate 1√ó10‚àí51superscript1051\\times 10^{-5} for Custom, 1√ó10‚àí41superscript1041\\times 10^{-4} for DreamBooth, 1√ó10‚àí31superscript1031\\times 10^{-3} for SVDiff and 1.5√ó10‚àí31.5superscript1031.5\\times 10^{-3} for Ours. Both DreamBooth and SVDiff methods are trained using a batch size of 1, whereas Custom and Ours utilize a batch size of 2. The text encoders of all methods are trained during the optimization process, where Custom method expands additional token as a personalized token (i.e., V‚àósuperscriptV\\mathrm{V}^{*}), and other methods use a rarely occurring token (e.g., sks). As for the prior preservation loss in Eq.¬†2, 200 images for each new concept are generated by Stable Diffusion. To reduce computational cost, we randomly choose 50 images for each learned concept to compute ‚ÑíPRksubscriptsuperscript‚ÑíùëòPR\\mathcal{L}^{k}_{\\mathrm{PR}} in Eq.¬†3. As for the inference stage, we apply a DDPM sampler with 200 steps and a classifier-free guidance scale of 7 for all the methods. To be fair, we employ the sate-of-the-art method Attend-and-Excite¬† to all competing methods to generate multi-concept images, e.g., SVDiff+FT*.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: We conduct lifelong generation experiments on our proposed L2DM method and three representative baselines in personalized text-to-image generation, i.e., DreamBooth¬†[ref]29, Custom Diffusion¬†[ref]31 (termed as Custom in this paper) and SVDiff¬†[ref]32.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
