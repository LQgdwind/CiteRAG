      "content": "Paper Title: Arbitrariness and Prediction: The Confounding Role of Variance in Fair Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo begin, we restate the definitions from Domingos   concerning the expected model (called the main predictor). We change the notation from Domingos to align with our own, as we believe these changes provide greater clarity concerning meaning, significance, and consequent takeaways. Nevertheless, these definitions for quantifying error are equivalent to those in Domingos , and they fundamentally depend on human decisions for setting up the learning process. Domingos   define predictive variance in relation to this single point of reference. This reference point captures the general, expected behavior of models that could be produced by the chosen learning process. We can think of each prediction of this point of reference as the “central tendency” of the predictions made by all possible models in μ𝜇\\mu for (𝒙,𝒈)𝒙𝒈({\\bm{x}},{\\bm{g}}). Formally, The main prediction y^^𝑦\\hat{y} is the prediction value y′∈𝕐superscript𝑦′𝕐y^{\\prime}\\in{\\mathbb{Y}} that generates the minimum average loss with respect to all of the predictions y^∈𝕐^^𝑦^𝕐\\hat{y}\\in\\hat{{\\mathbb{Y}}} generated by the different possible models in μ𝜇\\mu. It is defined as the expectation over training sets 𝔻𝔻{\\mathbb{D}} for a loss function f𝑓f, given an example instance (𝒙,𝒈)𝒙𝒈({\\bm{x}},{\\bm{g}}). That is, The main predictor h¯:𝕏→𝕐:¯ℎ→𝕏𝕐\\overline{h}:{\\mathbb{X}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{Y}} produces the main prediction y¯¯𝑦\\overline{y} for each (𝒙,𝒈)𝒙𝒈({\\bm{x}},{\\bm{g}}). What (10) evaluates to in practice of course depends on the loss function f𝑓f. For squared loss, the main prediction is defined as the mean prediction of all the h𝑫ksubscriptℎsubscript𝑫𝑘h_{{\\bm{D}}_{k}}  . Following Kong and Dietterich , for 0-1 loss Domingos  defines the main prediction as the mode/majority vote — the most frequent prediction for an example instance (𝒙,𝒈)𝒙𝒈({\\bm{x}},{\\bm{g}}). We provide a more formal discussion of why this is the case when we discuss problems with the main prediction for cost-sensitive loss (Appendix C.2). Domingos   then define variance in relation to specific models h𝑫ksubscriptℎsubscript𝑫𝑘h_{{\\bm{D}}_{k}} and the main predictor h¯¯ℎ\\overline{h}: The variance-induced error for fresh example instance (𝒙,𝒈)𝒙𝒈({\\bm{x}},{\\bm{g}}) is where y¯=h¯​(𝒙)¯𝑦¯ℎ𝒙\\overline{y}=\\overline{h}({\\bm{x}}) is the main prediction and the y^^𝑦\\hat{y} are the predictions for the different h𝑫k∼μsimilar-tosubscriptℎsubscript𝑫𝑘𝜇h_{{\\bm{D}}_{k}}\\sim\\mu. That is, for a specific (𝒙,𝒈)𝒙𝒈({\\bm{x}},{\\bm{g}}), it is possible to compare the individual predictions y^=h𝑫k​(𝒙)^𝑦subscriptℎsubscript𝑫𝑘𝒙\\hat{y}=h_{{\\bm{D}}_{k}}({\\bm{x}}) to the main prediction y¯=h¯​(𝒙)¯𝑦¯ℎ𝒙\\overline{y}=\\overline{h}({\\bm{x}}). Using the main prediction as a reference point, one can compute the extent of disagreement of individual predictions with the main prediction as a source of error. It is this definition (Definition 5) that prior work on fair classification tends to reference when discussing variance [ref]11 . However, as we discuss in more detail below (Appendix C.2), many of the theoretical results in Chen et al. [ref]11 follow directly from the definitions in Domingos , and the experiments do not actually use those results in practice. Black et al. , in contrast, presents results that rely heavily on the main prediction in Domingos .\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: of individual predictions with the main prediction as a source of error.
