Even though they can successfully reduce temporal redundancy of video data, those compression algorithms are limited in compression performance as they cannot be jointly optimized. With the success of deep learning based motion estimation and image compression approaches, some attempts have been made to use neural networks for video compression  [ref]33  , in which the neural networks are used to replace the modules from the conventional approach.\nThe work in  proposed a block based approach, while\nTsai et al.  utilized an auto-encoder approach to compress residual information from H.264.\nWu et al. [ref]33 predicted and reconstructed video frames by using interpolation.\nWhile the above works have achieved remarkable performance, they cannot be trained in an end-to-end fashion, which limits their performance. Recently, more deep video compression methods     [ref]9 have been proposed.\nLu et al.  proposed the first end-to-end deep learning video compression (DVC) framework, which replaces all the key components of the traditional video compression codec with deep neural networks.\nRippel et al.  proposed to maintain a state, which contains the past information, compressed motion information and residual information for video compression.\nDjelouah et al. [ref]9 proposed an interpolation based video compression approach, which combines motion compression and image synthesis in a single network.\nIn these works, optical flow information plays an essential role.\nIn order to achieve reasonable compression performance, the state-of-the-art optical flow estimation networks   have been adopted\nto provide accurate motion estimation.\nHowever, as these optical flow estimation networks were designed for generating accurate full-resolution motion maps, they are not optimal for the video compression task.\nRecently, Habibian et al.  proposed a 3D auto-encoder approach without requiring optical flow for motion compensation.\nHowever,\ntheir algorithm is still limited for capturing fine scale motions. In contrast to these works, we propose a new framework RaFC to effectively compress optical flow maps, and\nit can be trained in an end-to-end fashion.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: Traditional video compression algorithms, such as H.264 [ref]32 and H.265 , adopted the hand-crafted operations for motion estimation and motion compensation for inter-frame prediction.
