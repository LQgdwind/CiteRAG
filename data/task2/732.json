      "content": "Paper Title: Predicting Visual Overlap of Images Through Interpretable Non-Metric Box Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven two images of the same scene, which one is the close-up? This question is relevant for many tasks, such as image-based rendering and navigation¬†, because the close-up has higher resolution details¬†0 for texturing a generated 3D model, while the other image has the context view of the scene.\nRelated tasks include 3D scene reconstruction¬†[ref]48, robot navigation¬†[ref]5 and relocalization¬†   , which all need to reason in 3D about visually overlapping images. For these applications, exhaustive searches are extremely expensive, so efficiency is needed in two related sub-tasks. First, it is attractive to cheaply identify which image(s) from a corpus have substantial overlap with a query image. Most images are irrelevant¬†, so progress on whole-image descriptors like¬† narrows that search.\nSecond, for every two images that are expected to have matchable content, the geometric verification of relative pose involves two-view feature matching and pose estimation¬†, which can range from being moderately to very expensive¬†, depending on design choices. RANSAC-type routines are more accurate and faster if the two images have matching scales¬†  , and if the detector and descriptor work well with that scene to yield low outlier-ratios. For scenes where training data is available, we efficiently address both sub-tasks, relevant image-finding and scale estimation, with our new embedding. Our proposed model projects whole images to our custom asymmetric feature space. There, we can compare the non-Euclidean measure between image encoding ùê±ùê±\\mathbf{x} to image encoding ùê≤ùê≤\\mathbf{y}, which is different from comparing ùê≤ùê≤\\mathbf{y} to ùê±ùê±\\mathbf{x} ‚Äì see Figure¬†1. Ours is distinct from previous methods which proposed a) learning image similarity with metric learning, e.g.¬†  , and b) estimation of relative scale or image overlap using geometric validation of matched image features, e.g.¬† 0.\nOverall, we advocate that normalized surface overlap (NSO) serves as an interpretable real-world measure of how the same geometry is pictured in two images, propose a new box embedding for images, that approximates the surface overlap measure while preserving interpretability, and show that the predicted surface overlap allows us to pre-scale images for same-or-better feature matching and pose estimation in a localization task. The new representation borrows from box embeddings¬†  , that were designed to represent hierarchical relations in words. We are the first to adapt them for computer vision tasks, and hereby propose image box embeddings. We qualitatively validate their ability to yield interpretable image relationships that don‚Äôt impede localization, and quantitatively demonstrate that they help with scale estimation.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: because the close-up has higher resolution details¬†0 for texturing a generated 3D model, while the other image has the context view of the scene.\nRelated tasks include 3D scene reconstruction¬†[ref]48, robot navigation¬†[ref]5 and relocalization¬†   , which all need to reason in 3D about visually overlapping images.
