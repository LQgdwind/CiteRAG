      "content": "Paper Title: HAQJSK: Hierarchical-Aligned Quantum Jensen-Shannon Kernels for Graph Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerally speaking, graph kernels are defined as the positive definite similarity measures between pairs of graphs   . Perhaps the most successful and widely used way to define a graph kernel is the principle of R-convolution developed by Haussler . It is a generic principle to define graph kernels between pairs of graphs by decomposing graph structures into substructures and measuring the isomorphism between the substructures, i.e., counting the pairs of isomorphic substructure between graphs. More specifically, one can employ any available graph decomposing algorithm to develop a graph kernel, e.g., the graph kernel based on comparing pairs of\ndecomposed a) paths , b) walks , c) subtrees [ref]12, d) subgraphs , etc. Within the scenario of R-convolution, Kashima et al. \nhave defined a Random Walk-based Kernel by decomposing graph structures into random walks of different restricted lengths. The kernel is defined by calculating the number of the random walk pairs with different same lengths. Borgwardt et al.  have developed a Shortest Path Kernel by counting the number of the shortest paths with different same lengths. Aziz et al.  have developed a non-Backtrack Path Kernel through cycle-based structures that are abstracted from the Ihara zeta function . The resulting kernel is computed by counting the numbers of cycle pairs with different same lengths. Costa and Grave  have proposed a Neighborhood Subgraph\nPairwise Distance Kernel by decomposing graphs into layer-wise expansion neighborhood subgraphs rooted at a pair of vertices with specified distance and measuring the isomorphism between the subgraphs. Gaidon et al.  have proposed a Subtree-based Kernel for video classification problems. They commence by representing complicated actions as spatio-temporal parts and transforming them into binary tree patterns. The proposed kernel is defined by comparing the pairs of isomorphic subtrees. Shervashidze et al.  have developed a Weisfeiler-Lehman Subtree Kernel by counting the pairs of isomorphic subtree patterns corresponded by the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph invariant. Other alternative R-convolution based graph kernels also include a) the Segmentation-based Graph Kernel , b) the Pyramid Quantized Shortest Path Kernel , c) the Pyramid Quantized Weisfeiler-Lehman Subtree Kernel , d) the Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernel [ref]20, e) the Isolation Graph Kernel , f) the Graph Filtration Kernels [ref]22, g) the Attributed Subgraph Matching Kernel , etc. One common shortcoming arising in most of the aforementioned R-convolution based kernels is that of ignoring the structural correspondence information between the graph structures. This problem is due to the fact that the R-convolution kernels only augment an unit kernel value if a pair of isomorphic substructures are detected, and the procedures of the isomorphism identification do not consider whether the isomorphic substructures are structurally aligned within the whole graph structures. For an instance of a computer vision problem in Fig. 1, there are a pair of graph structures extracted from two images, that contain the same house based on different viewpoints. The R-convolution kernels will directly augment an unit kernel value when they identify the isomorphic triangle-based substructures, no matter whether they are structurally aligned to each other through the vision background. Thus, the R-convolution kernels will not reflect the precise similarity measure between a pair of graphs, and may in turn influence the graph classification performance. To address the above issues, Bai and Xu et al.    have developed a family of Depth-based Alignment Kernels that encapsulate the vertex correspondence information. For a pair of graphs, they first compute the Depth-based Complexity Trace rooted at each vertex as the vectorial vertex representations , the resulting alignment kernels are attained by counting the pairs of aligned vertices that are identified by evaluating the distance between the vectorial vertex representations in a Euclidean space. More specifically, these vertex alignment kernels are theoretically equivalent to aligned subgraph kernels that encapsulate structural correspondence information between substructures, addressing the shortcoming of neglecting structural correspondence information between graphs arising in existing R-convolution kernels. Unfortunately, both the aforementioned R-convolution kernels and vertex alignment kernels fail to reflect characteristics of global graph structures. The reasons for this problem are twofold. First, the definition of the R-convolution kernels relies on the graph decomposition, that may cause the notorious computational inefficiency. Thus, the R-convolution kernels usually compromise to use substructures of small sizes, and it is hard to represent the global graph characteristics with such substructures. Second, the vertex alignment kernels only focus on identifying the correspondence information between local vertices, which only reflect local topological information. Moreover, on the other hand, the above alignment kernels are not positive definite. This is due to the fact that the aligned vertices identified by the alignment kernels are not transitive, i.e., if vertices a𝑎a and b𝑏b are both aligned to vertex c𝑐c, we cannot guarantee that vertices a𝑎a and b𝑏b are also aligned to each other. The transitivity is a necessary condition to ensure the positive definiteness for an alignment or matching kernel . To overcome the drawback of neglecting global graph characteristics arising in the above R-convolution kernels and vertex alignment kernels, many graph kernels have been developed through the adjacency matrices that are natural representations of global graph structures. For example, Johansson et al.,  have proposed a Global Graph Kernel based on the celebrated Lovász numbers as well as their orthonormal representations computed through the adjacency matrices. Xu et al.,  have developed a Hybrid Reproducing Kernel using the global entropy measures of the adjacency matrices. Another alternative way of analyzing global graph structures is to employ the Continuous-time Quantum Walks (CTQW) . In quantum mechanics and quantum information theory , the CTQW represents a quantum analogue of the classical Continuous-time Random Walk (CTRW), it is controlled by an unitary matrix and is not dominated by the low Laplacian spectrum frequencies. By contrast, the classical CTRW is controlled by a doubly stochastic matrix. Hence, the CTQW can better distinguish different global graphs. More specifically, there have been a family of Quantum Jensen-Shannon Kernels (QJSK) defined based on the CTQW. For example, Bai et al.  have defined a quantum walk kernel by measuring the Quantum Jensen-Shannon Divergence (QJSD) between the density matrices of the CTQW evolved on graph structures. Rossi et al. , on the other hand, have proposed a quantum walk kernel by exploring the relationship between the interferences and symmetries of the CTQW evolved on graphs, in terms of the QJSD. Both the quantum walk kernels adopt the Laplacian matrix as the Hamiltonian operator, that can naturally reflect global graph characteristics. Unfortunately, computing the QJSD between a pair of graphs requires a composite graph structure that needs the vertex alignment information between the graphs, both the quantum kernels cannot guarantee the transitivity between the aligned vertices or even compute the composite structure by randomly arranging the vertex orders. Thus, these quantum kernels are not positive definite, and can not reflect the precise similarity between graphs. Broadly speaking, developing effective graph kernels is always a theoretical challenge problem.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: More specifically, one can employ any available graph decomposing algorithm to develop a graph kernel, e.g., the graph kernel based on comparing pairs of\ndecomposed a) paths , b) walks , c) subtrees [ref]12, d) subgraphs , etc. Within the scenario of R-convolution, Kashima et al. \nhave defined a Random Walk-based Kernel by decomposing graph structures into random walks of different restricted\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
