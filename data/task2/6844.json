      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial Illusions in Multi-Modal Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRobustness to perturbations. \nAnother plausible defense is to somehow train aligned multi-modal encoders so that they are robust in the following sense: if two inputs are within δ𝛿\\delta of each other, their respective embeddings should be within γ𝛾\\gamma (using some suitable metrics for δ𝛿\\delta and γ𝛾\\gamma over the input space and embedding space, respectively). Certified robustness [ref]33  ensures that any input perturbation within a certain bound has only a limited impact on the output of the model. It is defined for classification tasks and cannot be directly applied to multi-modal encoders in a downstream task-agnostic way. Given a specific downstream task, it may be possible to perform interval-bound propagation  over multi-modal encoders. Unfortunately, there is a fundamental tradeoff between robustness and invariance [ref]45. Intuitively, there is no “right” value for the robustness bound, i.e., distance δ𝛿\\delta such that all inputs within δ𝛿\\delta are encoded into similar embeddings. If δ𝛿\\delta is too small, the adversary can use perturbations bigger than δ𝛿\\delta to evade the defense (i.e., the model is insufficiently robust). If δ𝛿\\delta is too big, semantically unrelated inputs will be mistakenly aligned (i.e., the model is too invariant). This observation was made for lpsubscript𝑙𝑝l_{p} bounds and image classifiers in [ref]45. Figure 10 illustrates it for l∞subscript𝑙l_{\\infty} bounds, showing that it is impossible to pick δ𝛿\\delta that is sufficiently robust and yet does not mistakenly align semantically different inputs.\nFigure 10 shows that δ𝛿\\delta must be greater than 0.30.30.3 because there exist perturbations bigger than 0.30.30.3 that produce a visually similar image, which should be aligned with the original. This figure also shows that δ𝛿\\delta must be less than 0.30.30.3 because there exist perturbations smaller than 0.30.30.3 that produce a visually different image, which should not be aligned with the original. Thus, there is no “right” value for δ𝛿\\delta. Robustness to semantics-preserving transformations. \nUltimately, embeddings should be trained so that semantically close inputs, within and across modalities, are encoded into similar vectors in the embedding space. There is prior work on adversarially robust perceptual similarity metrics , but perceptual similarity is insufficient for aligned embeddings. It is based on the features of a specific image classifier and only captures semantic similarity insofar as images belong to the same class, i.e., it only aligns images with the labels of that classifier. Alignment in multi-modal embeddings is supposed to cover much broader semantic similarity. For text, there exist broad classes of semantics-preserving transformations (e.g., substituting words with synonyms), and models can be trained to be robust with respect to word substitutions  [ref]29 . Our attacks exploit perturbations in images and audio, where semantic similarity is not as well defined as in text. In the image domain, robustness under different distance metrics results in vastly different performance . To ensure that the embeddings of semantically similar inputs are close to each other, the range of encoders for different modalities should overlap with very fine-grained control over changes in the embedding given a change in the input. With such control, it is not clear how to prevent an adversary from crafting inputs that are closer to the target than organically aligned inputs, considering that organic alignment in the existing embeddings is relatively weak (see Section 5.2).\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: each other, their respective embeddings should be within γ𝛾\\gamma (using some suitable metrics for δ𝛿\\delta and γ𝛾\\gamma over the input space and embedding space, respectively).
