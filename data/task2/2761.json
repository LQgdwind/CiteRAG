      "content": "Paper Title: Road Network Guided Fine-Grained Urban Traffic Flow Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraffic flow analysis is crucial for intelligent transportation systems, since the analysis results can provide important information for various downstream applications. Over the past decades, massive efforts    [ref]18   have been made to address the traffic analysis problem. For instance, Han et al.  developed a Filter-Discovery-Match framework to learn incident patterns from vehicle trajectories for traffic incident detection, while Sun et al.  employed spatial graph convolution to build a multi-view graph convolutional network for crowd flow prediction. Recently, fine-grained traffic flow inference has become an emerging problem, due to its huge potential for device cost savings. In the literature, some deep learning-based methods have been proposed for this task. For instance, Zong et al. [ref]4 utilized a super-resolution convolutional neural network to learn the spatial mapping between coarse-grained and fine-grained traffic flow maps. Liang et al.  incorporated a deep residual network and a distributional upsampling module to generate fine-grained flow distributions. Ouyang et al. [ref]6 employed a cascade pyramid network called UrbanPy to upsample the coarse-grained inputs progressively. Zhou et al.  proposed a deep neural network called UrbanODE, which incorporated Neural Ordinary Differential Equations  and pyramid attention to learn spatial correlations of urban traffic flow in surrounding regions. Yu et al.  extracted spatial features from both local and global levels, and combined temporal features to generate the fine-gained maps using time-specific convolutional layers. The most relevant work to ours is UrbanPy [ref]6, which also uses road network structures. However, there are two key differences between our RATFM and UrbanPy in terms of road network usage. Firstly, UrbanPy only uses the statistic road density/number for each region, missing a lot of crucial information of road network structures, e.g., road direction and connectivity. By contrast, our RATFM learns the road distribution patterns effectively from high-resolution road network maps using a tailor-designed multi-directional 1D convolutional layer. Secondly, UrbanPy directly takes the concatenation of road density features and traffic flow features for representation learning, which can’t well model the correlation between road network and traffic flow. By contrast, our RATFM introduces two short and long-range road-aware inference modules to effectively generate fine-grained traffic flow maps. Thanks to these tailor-designed modules, our method can fully exploit the prior knowledge of urban road networks to facilitate the problem of fine-grained traffic flow inference.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: is crucial for intelligent transportation systems, since the analysis results can provide important information for various downstream applications.
