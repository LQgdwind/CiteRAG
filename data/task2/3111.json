      "content": "Paper Title: Deformable ProtoPNet: An Interpretable Image Classifier Using Deformable Prototypes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe conducted a case study of our Deformable ProtoPNet on the full (uncropped) CUB-200-2011 bird species classification dataset 7. We trained Deformable ProtoPNets with 6 3√ó3333\\times 3 deformable prototypes per class, and Deformable ProtoPNets with 10 2√ó2222\\times 2 deformable prototypes per class, unless otherwise specified. We ran experiments using VGG [ref]37, ResNet , and DenseNet [ref]14 as CNN backbones fùëìf. The ResNet-50 backbone was pretrained on iNaturalist , and all other backbones were pretrained using ImageNet . See the supplement for more details regarding our experimental setup. We find that Deformable ProtoPNet can achieve competitive accuracy across multiple backbone architectures. As shown in Table 1, our Deformable ProtoPNet achieves higher accuracy than ProtoPNet  and the non-interpretable baseline model in all cases. For all backbone architectures except VGG-16 and VGG-19 [ref]37, a Deformable ProtoPNet with deformations and 2√ó2222\\times 2 deformable prototypes has the best performance across the models with the same backbone. We ran additional experiments on Stanford Dogs  and found that our Deformable ProtoPNet also performs well across multiple backbone architectures on that dataset. See the supplement for details. We find that using deformations, orthogonality loss, and subtractive margin generally improves (or maintains) accuracy. As shown in Table 1, introducing deformations improves (or maintains) accuracy for most backbone architectures. We performed additional ablation studies on ResNet-50-based Deformable ProtoPNets with and without deformations ‚Äì these models were trained using various settings of the subtractive margin and orthogonality loss. As shown in Table 2 (top), introducing deformations improves (or maintains) accuracy under the same settings of margin and orthogonality loss. As shown in Table 2 (bottom), introducing subtractive margin generally improves accuracy under the same settings of orthogonality loss and deformations. As shown in both Table 2 (top) and Table 2 (bottom), introducing orthogonality loss maintains accuracy in most cases. We find that Deformable ProtoPNet can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. As Table 3 (top) shows, a single Deformable ProtoPNet can achieve high accuracy (86.1%percent86.186.1\\% with 6 3√ó3333\\times 3 prototypes per class, 86.4%percent86.486.4\\% with 10 2√ó2222\\times 2 prototypes per class) on full test images from CUB-200-2011 7, outperforming a single ProtoTree  (82.2%percent82.282.2\\%) and 3 ensembled TesNets 5 (83.5%percent83.583.5\\%). Additionally, 5 ensembled Deformable ProtoPNets using 2√ó2222\\times 2 prototypes outperform all competing models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy (87.8%percent87.887.8\\%). Table 3 (bottom) shows that Deformable ProtoPNet also performs well on Stanford Dogs , achieving accuracy (86.5%percent86.586.5\\%) competitive with the state-of-the-art.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: with 6 3√ó3333\\times 3 deformable prototypes per class, and Deformable ProtoPNets with 10 2√ó2222\\times 2 deformable prototypes per class, unless otherwise specified.
