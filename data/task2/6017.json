      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-multigraph Search: Rethinking Meta-structure on Heterogeneous Information Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHeterogeneous information networks (HINs) consist of multiple types of nodes and/or edges.\nWhen simulating real-world systems, HINs can represent a wide range of entities and complex relationships, which is extremely useful in applications. For example, the citation network called ACM contains multiple node types, i.e., Author (A), Paper (P), and Subject (S), as well as multiple edge types, such as Author→writeswrites→\\xrightarrow{\\rm writes}Paper, Paper→citescites→\\xrightarrow{\\rm cites}Paper, Paper→belongs​tobelongsto→\\xrightarrow{\\rm belongs~{}to}Subject. To fully utilize the heterogeneity, various heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have been proposed by combining graph neural networks (GNNs) with meta-structures [ref]1     , including meta-paths  [ref]1 and meta-graph   . Within this framework, each node generates its representation by aggregating features of its neighbors defined by meta-structures. For example, the meta-path Author-Paper-Author (APA) represents the co-author relationship, which corresponds to multiple APA instances in the HIN.\nThen, one Author node can aggregate features from its meta-path-based neighbors (co-authors). One category of HGNNs employs hand-designed meta-structures to define neighbors, e.g., HAN [ref]1 and MAGNN [ref]11. However, hand-designed meta-structures require rich domain knowledge that is extremely difficult to obtain in schema-rich or large-scale HINs.\nThe second category of HGNNs implicitly learns meta-structures by attention to eliminate the need for hand-designed meta-structures,\ne.g., GTN [ref]12 and HGT . However, these works typically suffer from high time or memory costs.\nMore recently, in light of the achievement of neural architecture search (NAS) in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)   , the third category of HGNNs employs NAS to automate the customization of meta-structures for specific datasets and tasks, including GEMS  and DiffMG . NAS-based HGNNs have accelerated the automation process in heterogeneous graph representation learning. However, there exists some weakness in these NAS methods for heterogeneous GNNs.\nGEMS  uses an evolutionary algorithm as the search strategy, making its search cost dozens of times as training a single GNN.\nInspired by the simplicity and computational efficiency of differentiable architecture search  in CNNs, DiffMG  proposes to search a meta-graph in a differentiable fashion, making the search cost on a par with training a single GNN once. Yet, it suffers from performance instability and often finds architectures worse than hand-designed models. This weakness motivates us to propose more stable search algorithms on HINs. Besides, existing works have a common issue of inflexibility in meta-structures. For HGNNs with hand-designed meta-structures, the meta-structures are predefined with fixed patterns, so they have limited capacity to encode various rich semantic information on diverse HINs and tasks. HGNNs employing attention or NAS can learn dataset-dependent meta-structures but only considers meta-paths or meta-graphs to guide the GNNs to propagate messages. However, meta-paths and meta-graphs are initially applied for hand-designed heterogeneous GNNs. They\nwould restrict the searched meta-structures to inflexible topology, which further limits the performance of HGNNs. Therefore, it is still an open problem on\nwhether better meta-structures exist for HGNNs (see Table 1 for a summary).

In this paper, we make a more comprehensive exploration of different meta-structures and observe that the performance of HGNNs improves along with the complexity of the searched meta-structures (see Fig. 1). We further propose a new algorithm called the Progressive Complex-to-concise Meta-Multigraph search (PCMM), containing a more expressive complex-to-concise (C2C) meta-multigraph, and a progressive search algorithm to overcome both the inconsistency and instability in existing NAS-based HGNNs. Specifically, to stabilize the differentiable search, PMMM randomly selects partial candidate message-passing types to update per iteration to ensure all candidate paths be equally and fully trained and decouple the joint optimization of paths. To derive flexible topology, PMMM searches for a novel meta-multigraph by selecting the top-k𝑘k most promising candidate message-passing types for aggregation. Searching for a meta-multigraph is a free performance-enhancing strategy, as it can encode more flexible and sophisticated semantic information in HINs compared with a meta-path or meta-graph. To bridge the gap between the meta-structures in the search and evaluation stages of the differentiable framework 0 1, PCMM employs a progressive search algorithm to implicitly narrow the search space by progressively reducing the number of activated paths. Then, the collection of the activated paths at the end of the search directly makes up our target-net. Consequently, a high-performance super-net corresponds to an effective target-net. Due to the progressive strategy, the whole search stage is stable.\nAdditionally, because meta-multigraphs’ flexibility may result in the propagation of redundant messages,\nPCMM searches for a more expressive C2C meta-multigraph by selecting the top-n𝑛n instead of the top-1 most promising candidate message-passing types related to the depth of meta-multigraph. Experiments on seven widely used and diverse datasets demonstrate that PMMM and PCMM outperform state-of-the-art HGNNs on node classification and recommendation tasks.\n Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We propose a novel meta-structure, termed meta-multigraph,\nthat is more expressive and flexible than existing meta-structures. We propose the first stable differentiable search algorithm on HINs, called PMMM, which can consistently discover promising meta-multigraphs that outperform hand-designed meta-structures. We further propose PCMM, consisting of a more expressive complex-to-concise meta-multigraph to avoid propagating redundant messages, and a progressive differentiable search algorithm to bridge the gap between the meta-structures in search and evaluation. Thorough experiments demonstrate that our PMMM and PCMM can find effective meta-structures and achieve state-of-the-art performance on medium-scale and large-scale datasets. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces necessary definitions, including meta-path, meta-graph, and the new conception, meta-multigraph and C2C meta-multigraph. Secion 3 presents the related works of heterogeneous graph neural networks and heterogeneous graph neural architecture search.\nSection 4 describes the details of our proposed PMMM and PCMM algorithms, and how they improve stability and consistency, respectively. Section 5 presents experimental results and analyses. Section 6 contains the concluding remarks.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: belongs~{}to}Subject.
