The ACRIMA  and LAG  datasets are publicly available, while the OHTS   and DIGS/ADAGES [ref]23 datasets are available upon request after appropriate data use agreements are initiated. Their details are as follows: The OHTS   is the only multi-center longitudinal study that has precise information on the dates/timing of the development of glaucoma (the enrolled subjects did not have glaucoma at study entry) using standardized assessment criteria by an independent Optic Disc Reading Center and confirmed by three glaucoma specialist endpoint committee members. In our experiments, a square region centered on the optic nerve head was first extracted from each raw fundus image using a well-trained DeepLabv3+ [ref]63 model. A small part of the raw data are stereoscopic fundus images, each of which was split to produce two individual fundus images. Through this image pre-processing approach, a total of 74,678 fundus images were obtained. Moreover, ENPOAGDISC (endpoint committee attributable to primary open angle glaucoma based on optic disc changes from photographs)  labels are used as the classification ground truth. The fundus images are divided into a training set (50,208 healthy images and 2,416 GON images), a validation set (7,188 healthy images and 426 GON images), and a test set (13,780 healthy images and 660 GON images) by participant. Splitting by participant (instead of by image) ensured that the validation and test sets did not contain images from any eyes or individuals used to train the model. More details on dataset preparation and baseline supervised learning experiments are provided in our recent publications  . Additionally, we select one image (from only one eye) from each patient in the training set to create the low-shot training set (995 healthy images and 152 GON images). If both eyes of a patient do not convert to glaucoma in the study, the first captured fundus photograph is selected. If either eye of a patient converts to glaucoma in the study, the first glaucoma fundus photograph is selected. The ACRIMA  dataset consists of 309 healthy images and 396 GON images. It was collected as part of an initiative by the government of Spain. Classification was based on the review by a single experienced glaucoma expert. Images were excluded if they did not provide a clear view of the optic nerve head region . The LAG  dataset contains 3,143 healthy images and 1,711 GON images333The number of fundus images being published is fewer than what was reported in publication . , collected by Beijing Tongren Hospital. Similar to the OHTS dataset, we also use the well-trained DeepLabv3+ [ref]63 model to extract a square region centered on the optic nerve head from each fundus image. The DIGS and ADAGES [ref]23 are longitudinal studies designed to detect and monitor glaucoma based on optical imaging and visual function testing that, when combined, have generated tens of thousands of test results from over 4,000 healthy, glaucoma suspect, or glaucoma eyes. In our experiments, we utilize the DIGS/ADAGES test set (5,184 healthy images and 4,289 GON images) to evaluate the generalizability of our proposed methods. Visualizations of the four test sets using t-SNE  are provided in Fig. 4. Since healthy and GON images are distributed similarly between the OHTS and LAG datasets, we expect models to perform similarly on these datasets. Dissimilar distributions in the ACRIMA and DIGS/ADAGES datasets led us to believe the performance of models on these datasets would be somewhat worse. Using these four datasets, we conduct three experiments: Supervised learning experiment: We employ transfer learning  to train ResNet-50 8, MobileNet-v2 [ref]46, DenseNet , and EfficientNet  (pre-trained on the ImageNet database 7), on the entire OHTS training set (including âˆ¼similar-to\\sim53K fundus images). The best-performing models are selected using the OHTS validation set. Their performance is subsequently evaluated on the OHTS test set, the ACRIMA dataset, the LAG dataset, and the DIGS/ADAGES test set. Low-shot learning experiment: The four pre-trained models mentioned above are used as the MTSN backbones and trained on the OHTS low-shot training set (containing 1,147 images) to validate the effectiveness of our proposed low-shot glaucoma diagnosis algorithm. The validation and testing procedures are identical to those in the supervised learning experiment. Semi-supervised learning experiment: The MTSNs trained on the low-shot training set are fine-tuned on the entire OHTS training set without using additional ground-truth labels. The fine-tuned MTSNs are referred to as MTSN+OVV. The validation and testing procedures are identical to those in the supervised learning experiment. The fundus images are resized to 224Ã—224224224224\\times 224 pixels. The initial learning rate is set to 0.001, which decays gradually after the 100th epoch. Due to the dataset imbalance problem, F1-score is utilized to select the best-performing models during the validation stage. Moreover, we adopt an early stopping mechanism during the validation stage to reduce over-fitting (the training will be terminated if the achieved F1-score has not increased for 10 epochs). We use three metrics: (1) accuracy, (2) F1-score, and (3) AUROC to quantify the performances of the trained models. While accuracy is generally reported in image classification papers, F1-score and AUROC are more comprehensive and reasonable evaluation metrics when the dataset is severely imbalanced.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: in our experiments were collected by various clinicians in different countries using distinct fundus cameras.
