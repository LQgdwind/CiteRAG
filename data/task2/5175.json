Machine Learning (ML) technologies have been increasingly used in MCPS, often deployed in the estimation and prediction components, to make data-driven decisions based on sensor or patient input and guide control actions [ref]1. Ensuring the successful deployment of ML within MCPS can be challenging, as the ML components must be able to handle the intricacies of patient physiology, time lags between the impact of a control action and sensor measurements, uncertainties in the operational environment that may affect the patient’s physiology, and variability in patient profiles which may result in differing impacts of the control actions. Moreover, due to physiological complexities and the limited availability of realistic patient profiles or datasets, ML techniques may use synthetic data or virtual patient models for training. The mismatch between the training data and the real-world data seen in deployment may result in erroneous, biased, or incomplete output predictions .\nFailure of the ML component due to any of the challenges noted above could result in irreparable harm to patients. As such, the use of ML within MCPS should be assured by evidence that these components are safe and reliable . Assurance cases (AC) are structured arguments, supported by evidence, to justify claims for an application in a given environment . Recent efforts in safety analysis and assurance have confirmed that AC are valuable for assessing and demonstrating trust . For example, AC have been deployed for unmanned aircraft systems  and medical devices . The U.S. FDA has also issued a guideline  suggesting medical manufacturers provide AC with pre-market submissions. Among the standards published by various organizations (e.g., ISO 26262 , ISO/PAS 21448 , ANSI/UL 4600 , and the FDA guideline for Artificial Pancreas Systems (APS) ), ANSI/UL 4600 is the only one offering evaluations of ML technology for the safety of autonomous vehicles. Among more AC-centric studies, Hawkins et al.  provide a guideline on the assurance of ML in autonomous systems, including a safety case pattern for each stage of the ML life cycle. Kaur et al.  proposed a modular assurance case pattern based on assume/guarantee reasoning for ML-enabled CPS, where the safety of the ML component and the rest of the system are assessed separately. However, the ML lifecycle is not dealt with in this pattern. A few studies have also developed AC for concrete learning-enabled use cases in the automotive domain   . Within the healthcare domain,  is the only work that presents an assurance case pattern to justify the use of ML. Even so, none of - instantiate the process activities and generate evidence for a concrete application in the medical domain. This paper tackles this gap by presenting detailed AC to assure the safety and effectiveness of a general framework of APS , suitable for all types of APS. We select APS as a representative of learning-enabled MCPS as it contains a collection of typical components of many ML-enabled MCPS, including data-driven estimation algorithms and embedded controllers for insulin dosage calculation. Expanding on the patterns proposed in  , we develop a safety assurance case for the ML-enabled controller of MCPS, consisting of a controller algorithm and an ML prediction algorithm, where our emphasis is greatly on the ML-based prediction. By proving trust in ML prediction, the safety of the controller algorithm can be assessed in isolation. Considering the patient as an essential element of the control loop, we discuss the AC elements that should be instantiated based on an individual patient profile or a population of patients. The instantiation is due to different physiologies of different patients, which may affect control actions, the ML controller’s expected behavior, and the claims satisfaction. This is the first time that the patient profiles are included in AC for ML controllers and MCPS.\nIn support of claims in AC for APS, we implement a deep neural network for blood glucose prediction in APS. We then present an analysis characterizing the sufficiency of the training data for the ML controller and the ML development process.\nWe also utilize APS domain knowledge to specify a set of properties based on a patient’s metabolism (e.g., insulin senstivity, carbohydrate absorption profile) and use formal verification to check them against the ML prediction component. We are unaware of any work verifying the ML components in APS except , which unlike us, compares the output ranges of two identical networks given a slight change in their input ranges. Contributions. The major contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: We present preliminary results on developing a safety assurance case template for ML controllers in MCPS, which includes patient profiles in its element descriptions. We present a detailed safety assurance case for APS that is supported by a thorough analysis of ML-based glucose prediction module. We define properties based on the body’s metabolism and check them against the ML prediction component using formal verification. In the end, we discuss open research problems in developing safety assurance cases for learning-enabled MCPS.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: technologies have been increasingly used in MCPS, often deployed in the estimation and prediction components, to make data-driven decisions based on sensor or patient input and guide control actions [ref]1.
