      "content": "Paper Title: AKF-SR: Adaptive Kalman Filtering-based Successor Representation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs explained in the previous sections, the proposed AKF-SR framework consists of four main modules: (i) RBF-based Feature Vector Construction, which maps each state 𝒔ksubscript𝒔𝑘\\bm{s}_{k} to NRBFsubscript𝑁RBFN_{\\text{RBF}}-dimensional state feature vector ϕ​(𝒔k)bold-italic-ϕsubscript𝒔𝑘\\bm{\\phi}(\\bm{s}_{k}) consisting of basis functions achieved from Eq. (14). The state-action feature vector 𝝍​(𝒔k,ak)𝝍subscript𝒔𝑘subscript𝑎𝑘\\bm{\\psi}(\\bm{s}_{k},a_{k}) is then generated by assigning ϕ​(𝒔k)bold-italic-ϕsubscript𝒔𝑘\\bm{\\phi}(\\bm{s}_{k}) to the corresponding spot for action aksubscript𝑎𝑘a_{k} while the feature vector values for the remainder of the actions are set to zero. The whole construction process of state-action feature vector 𝝍​(𝒔k,ak)𝝍subscript𝒔𝑘subscript𝑎𝑘\\bm{\\psi}(\\bm{s}_{k},a_{k}) has a computational complexity of O​(NRBF×D3)𝑂subscript𝑁RBFsuperscript𝐷3O(N_{\\text{RBF}}\\times D^{3}) per iteration, (ii) Reward Learning, which first, estimates the reward weight vector 𝜽ksubscript𝜽𝑘\\bm{\\theta}_{k} via implementation of NRBFsubscript𝑁RBFN_{\\text{RBF}} parallel KFs. The global computational complexity (per iteration) of MMAE is O​(NKF×L3)𝑂subscript𝑁KFsuperscript𝐿3O(N_{\\text{KF}}\\times L^{3}). The measurement mapping function of the reward weight vector is then adapted by updating the means and covariances of basis functions through Eqs. (38) and  (39). Since at each time step, only the mean or covariance is updated, this process results in memory complexity of O​(L+D32)𝑂𝐿superscript𝐷32O(\\frac{L+D^{3}}{2}), (iii) KTD-based SR Learning, which estimates the SR weight matrix 𝑾ksubscript𝑾𝑘\\bm{W}_{k} via KTD algorithm. This estimation procedure can be computed in O​(L4)𝑂superscript𝐿4O(L^{4})  per iteration, and; (iv) Active Learning Scheme, which selects the action leading to the largest\ndecrease in uncertainty of the state-action value function in O​(L×Nactions)𝑂𝐿subscript𝑁actionsO(L\\times N_{\\text{actions}}). The global computational complexity (per iteration) of the proposed AKF-SR scheme is, therefore, in O​(NRBF×D3+NKF×L3+L4)𝑂subscript𝑁RBFsuperscript𝐷3subscript𝑁KFsuperscript𝐿3superscript𝐿4O(N_{\\text{RBF}}\\times D^{3}+N_{\\text{KF}}\\times L^{3}+L^{4}). It should be noted that the main focus of this paper is on the improvement of the performance of RL agents by considering their uncertainties/beliefs for choosing different actions. As it has been shown in the manuscript, this uncertainty can be achieved by using KF for the reward function learning and KTD for the SR learning. The proposed MMAE and RGD improve the performances of the used KF by adaptation of its two most important parameters: measurement noise covariance and measurement mapping function. The computational complexities of DQN [ref]37, USR  and SSR  are not specified; however, based on our experiments and since the proposed AKF-SR has much less trainable parameters than the DQN [ref]37, USR , and SSR  frameworks, which all use DNNs with large number of parameters for the learning process, AKF-SR has less computational cost compared to its DNN-based counterparts. As an example, DQN with only one hidden layer of size 646464 has 111401114011140 parameters resulting in high computational complexity and memory requirement. Training with a mini-batch of 323232 on a typical performance GPU shows that it needs over 3.53.53.5 GB of local DRAM.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: RGD improve the performances of the used KF by adaptation of its two most important parameters: measurement noise covariance and measurement mapping function.
