A recent exception to this\nis the work of Zhang et al.¬†, who propose the\nnotion of Kinodynamic Networks, geometric graphs (section¬†2.2) where ŒõŒõ\\Lambda are Cubic B√©zier curves.\nA curve\nis admitted into the definition of ŒõŒõ\\Lambda whenever its endpoints are vertices in the network and the convex hull of its control points does not\noverlap any OisubscriptùëÇùëñO_{i}.\nAt the time of writing this we are not aware of published analysis showing this approach\nto be AO or PC. The Lazy PRM algorithm in Figure¬†3 is both AO and PC, and this follows directly from the\ntheory developed for probabilistic roadmaps¬† [ref]11 [ref]22. Conceptually close but methodologically distant to this paper is the recent work\nof Ortiz-Haro et al.¬†[ref]49 based on the Logic Geometric Programming (LGP) framework\nof M. Toussaint¬†0. Ortiz-Haro et al. propose to compile\nvia polynomial-time reduction instances of Problem¬†(7) into a discrete deterministic\nplanning problem¬†[19, Section 2.4].\nTheir\napproach relies on very scalable methods for the latter class of optimal discrete control problems.\nOrtiz-Haro et al. do not provide near-optimality guarantees, and the\noverheads of representing the constraints of Problem¬†(7)\nas STRIPS operators\nare substantial Lastly, the recent results showing Branch-and-Cut and other advanced techniques for Integer programming to\nbe a highly performing approach to Multi-Agent Path Planning problems¬†1\nwere a direct inspiration to us.\nAs it has long been recognized in the literature¬†2 , the gap between\nso-called ‚Äúgrid-based‚Äù and sampling-based motion planning ‚Äújust‚Äù lies in the provenance\nand properties of the underlying geometric graphs both methodologies use.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: of published analysis showing this approach\nto be AO or PC.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
