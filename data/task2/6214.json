      "content": "Paper Title: AD-NEv: A Scalable Multi-Level Neuroevolution Framework for Multivariate Anomaly Detection This work has been submitted to the IEEE TNNLS for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModern cyberphysical and failure prediction systems involve sophisticated equipment that records multivariate time-series data from several up to thousands of features. Such systems need to be continuously monitored to prevent expensive failures. In anomaly detection, it is common to have abundant availability of normal data deriving from sensor monitoring, and scarcity of labeled anomalies. For this reason, most anomaly detection works focus on semi-supervised learning settings, where model training is conducted exclusively using normal data , , as well as unsupervised learning settings, where training data is mostly normal but may contain a small number of unknown anomalies . Amongst recent works on semi-supervised and unsupervised multivariate time-series anomaly detection, deep learning-based methods achieve the best results on well known benchmarks       [ref]9 0. Within deep learning methods, a wide spectrum of autoencoder-based approaches were designed to deal with the anomaly detection problem. The most efficient are those based on convolutional, fully connected, and LSTM layers, or a combination of them in single model. Alternative methods are based on adversarial techniques  as well as variational autoencoders 1\nOther recent and very promising trends include autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks 2, GAN-based architectures , supervised classification models 3 and ensemble autoencoders 4. In this context, one important problem is the identification of a suitable and optimized architecture for a given dataset, in a fully automated way.\nNeuroevolution is a form of artificial intelligence that uses evolutionary approaches to find optimal neural networks. The most popular forms of neuroevolution algorithms include NEAT 5, HyperNEAT 6 and coDeepNEAT 7, which aim to optimize parameters, model architectures, or both.\nHowever, despite its potential, neuroevolution approaches have been focused on the optimization of model architectures without taking into account the joint optimization of model architectures with feature subspaces and model weights. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap proposing AD-NEv, a multi-level neuroevolution approach that aims to identify robust and optimized autoencoder architectures for anomaly detection. Inspired by the framework formulated in 8, which is loosely based on the coDeepNEAT algorithm, we consider two populations: models and subspaces. The former contains neural network architectures that evolve during the neuroevolution process. The latter consists of subspaces, which define subsets of input features. After the neuroevolution process, the framework sets up a bagging technique-based ensemble model from single optimised architectures. Moreover, our approach optimizes a single model for each subspace, overcoming the limitation of a single sub-optimal solution for all subspaces.\nSubsequently, a fully scalable non-gradient fine-tuning process is performed to iteratively select the best solutions and generate model populations. Additionally, fine-tuning is performed on the evolved ensemble model. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that our proposed multi-level neuroevolution approach yields deep ensembles of auto-encoder models that outperform state-of-the-art methods without requiring any predefined scoring function. The main contributions of our work can be summarized in the following: A novel multi-level neuroevolution approach with a separate population of models for each subspace of features, which can be evolved independently, leading to a a better adaptation of specific models to each subspace. A novel selection process for models evolution based on an adapted distance measure for deep autoencoders that promotes model diversity.\n A fast non gradient-based fine-tuning approach for the evolved model architecture, leveraging adaptations of neural network weights in the evolution process, which improves results achieved by the previous levels. Automatic induction of a regularized ensemble model with a low number of sub-models, which further improves anomaly detection performance. An extensive evaluation with benchmark datasets that are widely adopted for multivariate anomaly detection. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes related works. Section 3 presents the proposed neuroevolution approach in detail. Section 4 describes and discusses our experiments. Section 5 summarizes the key results obtained in our study. Section 6 focuses on our ablation study. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper and outlines directions for future work.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: anomalies .
