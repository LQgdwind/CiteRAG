Informally, one\nis given a set of variables and a set of constraints, each depending only on\nconstantly many variables. Given a CSP instance, the goal is to find an assignment\nof values to all the variables so that all constraints are satisfied. For\nexample, if the domain is {r,g,b}𝑟𝑔𝑏\\{r,g,b\\} and the constraints are of the form\nR​(x,y)𝑅𝑥𝑦R(x,y), where R={(r,g),(g,r),(g,b),(b,g),(r,b),(b,r)}𝑅𝑟𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑔𝑏𝑏𝑔𝑟𝑏𝑏𝑟R=\\{(r,g),(g,r),(g,b),(b,g),(r,b),(b,r)\\} is the binary disequality relation on {r,g,b}𝑟𝑔𝑏\\{r,g,b\\}, we obtain\nthe classic graph 3-Colorability\nproblem. If the domain is {r,g,b,o}𝑟𝑔𝑏𝑜\\{r,g,b,o\\} and the\nconstraints are of the form R​(x,y)𝑅𝑥𝑦R(x,y), where\nR={(r,g),(g,r),(g,b),(b,g),(b,o),(o,b),(o,r),(r,o)}𝑅𝑟𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑔𝑏𝑏𝑔𝑏𝑜𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑜R=\\{(r,g),(g,r),(g,b),(b,g),(b,o),(o,b),(o,r),(r,o)\\},\nwe obtain a variant of\nthe graph 4-Colorability problem in which adjacent vertices must be\nassigned different colors and, additionally, red and blue vertices must not be adjacent\nand green and orange vertices must not be adjacent. Back in 1978, Schaefer famously classified all Boolean CSPs as solvable in\npolynomial time or NP-hard .111We call a CSP\nBoolean if the domain of all variables is of size two. Some papers call\nsuch CSPs binary. We use the term binary for a relation of arity two and\nfor CSPs whose constraints involve binary relations. The\ntractable cases are the standard textbook problems, namely\n2-SAT, Horn-SAT, dual\nHorn-SAT, and system of linear equations on a two-element set.222There\nare also two trivial, uninteresting cases called 0-valid and 1-valid.\nHell and Nešetřil studied a special case of CSPs known\nas graph homomorphisms . These are CSPs in which all constraints\ninvolve the same binary symmetric relation, i.e., a graph. The above-mentioned\n3-Colorability problem is the homomorphism problem to K3subscript𝐾3K_{3},\nthe undirected clique on three vertices, say {r,g,b}𝑟𝑔𝑏\\{r,g,b\\}. The above-mentioned\nvariant of 4-Colorability is the homomorphism problem to C4subscript𝐶4C_{4}, the\nundirected cycle on four vertices, say {r,g,b,o}𝑟𝑔𝑏𝑜\\{r,g,b,o\\}. Generalizing greatly\nthe classic result of Karp that k𝑘k-Colorability is solvable in polynomial time for k≤2𝑘2k\\leq 2 and NP-hard\nfor k≥3𝑘3k\\geq 3 and other concrete problems such as the (tractable) variant of\n4-Colorability above, Hell and Nešetřil obtained in\n1990 a complete classification of such CSPs .\nMotivated by these two results and the quest to identify the largest subclass of\nNP that could exhibit a dichotomy and thus avoid NP-intermediate cases, Feder\nand Vardi famously conjectured that all CSPs on finite domains admit a\ndichotomy; i.e., are either solvable in polynomial time or are\nNP-hard . Following the so-called algebraic approach to CSPs, pioneered by Jeavons, Cohen\nan Gyssens  and Bulatov, Jeavons, and\nKrokhin , the conjecture was resolved in the\naffirmative in 2017 by Bulatov  and, independently,\nby Zhuk [ref]56 . The algebraic approach allows for a very clean and\nprecise characterization of what makes certain CSPs computationally tractable\n— this is captured by the notion of polymorphisms, which can be thought of as\nmultivariate symmetries of solutions spaces of CSPs.\nAlong the way to the resolution of the Feder-Vardi dichotomy conjecture, the\nalgebraic approach has been successfully used to\nestablish other results about CSPs,\ne.g., characterizing the power of local consistency\nalgorithms for CSPs  , characterizing robustly solvable\nCSPs   , classifying the\ncomplexity of exact optimization CSPs  7, the\ntremendous progress on classifying the complexity of CSPs on infinite\ndomains [ref]7, and very recently using SDPs for robustly\nsolving certain promise CSPs [ref]9.\n\nReference markers found: [56]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]56: algebraic approach to CSPs, pioneered by Jeavons, Cohen\nan Gyssens  and Bulatov, Jeavons, and\nKrokhin , the conjecture was resolved in the\naffirmative in 2017 by Bulatov  and, independently,\nby Zhuk [ref]56 .
