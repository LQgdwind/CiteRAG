      "content": "Paper Title: Development of Human Motion Prediction Strategy using Inception Residual Block\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHuman motion prediction is a crucial task where the machine needs to predict human pose. Recognizing human pose tells human behaviour to machine. It involves human tracking ,  , motion generation [ref]4, human action recognition and prediction, online gaming . Generally it is used where machines need to interact with humans and useful in computer vision and robotics. In human-robot interaction,  if a human is walking and a robot have to approach a human the robot must predict human motion. In Autonomous car driving , car must have to predict pedestrian motion  to prevent accident. Our task in this paper is to predict human motion and achieving higher accuracy. We have given past human pose and need to forecast next human pose. To achieve higher accuracy key point is to detect temporal features. Authors in 0, 1 2 use RNNs to detect temporal features. There are two problems with the RNN based models. First problem 0 1 is, in RNN, errors adds up to every step of sequences. It leads to illogical prediction at testing time. Second, as it is found in 0 and 1, there is an inconsistency between the last observed and first forecasted frames. This inconsistency exists because of the frame by frame regression that does not encourage global smoothness. Mao et. al 3 considers this task as feed forward network. They have used Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT) to encode temporal features and graph convolution network 4 as feed-forward network for prediction. Tim et. al 5 follows 3 research and instead of DCT uses inception module 6. In line with 5, for our specific problem for predicting human poses based on past actions, we hypothesise that using residual block with inception module can provide better continuity between previously observed pose and the next predicted pose. In the inception module, we are proposing to use 1D CNN since 1D CNN plays a crucial role to detect temporal features. CNN 7 considers three architectural idea: local receptive field, shared weights and spatial sub-sampling. Receptive field slides over data by the predefined value that is called stride. While sliding they overlap with each other and cover the whole series of data and detects features of input data. CNN shares weight and bias for a layer which makes it computational cost-efficient than artificial neural network. Weights and bias learn by training. By doing one convolution operation one feature is detected. When kernel strides in 1-dimensional time series data it detects temporal features of input data. In our work to detect temporal features, we applied the inception module and the residual block. In the inception module 6 we apply different size of kernels to get different receptive fields so that salient features can be detected. By considering multiple sizes of kernels we have two advantages. First, we donâ€™t have to choose perfect kernel size for input and makes worry free. Second, model gets a better look at input data. It detects smaller to bigger key features. Adding residual block makes it easier to learn residual mapping than original mapping 8. It adds continuity between previously observed pose and temporal encoding of pose. Using the Inception residual module we encode human poses to temporal encoding. Now the question is how to detect spatial features of a human pose. In our work spatial features means learning dependencies between human joints of pose. It is important that our approach should not depend on fixed convolution filter size which is similar to detecting temporal features. We are using GCN 9 to learn graph connectivity and detecting spatial features. GCNs are powerful feed forward neural network that learns human pose joint dependencies 3. As an input they take temporal encoding and predict human motion. The major contributions of the paper: We have proposed a residual connection between input and inception block. We have done parametric analyses of number of temporal features. We perform end-to-end learning with Inception Residual Block and GCN. This paper has divided into five parts. In the First Part, we have discussed about human motion prediction and talked about its application, problem analysis as well as gave a little overview of 1D CNN. In the second part, we have discussed related work. In the third part, we have shared our methodology where we formulate a problem statement, discuss preliminaries, and explained our architecture and training details. In the Fourth part, we have shown our implementation details, discussed parametric analysis and compared our result with baseline methods . In the final part, we have written our conclusion and future possibilities.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Human motion prediction is a crucial task where the machine needs to predict human pose.
