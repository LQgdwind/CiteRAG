      "content": "Paper Title: Lightweight Monocular Depth Estimation via Token-Sharing Transformer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDepth information plays a fundamental and crucial role in various robotics systems and applications such as visual odometry, autonomous driving, robot localization, and visual perception.\nSeveral dedicated sensors such as light detection and ranging, time-of-flight, and structured light are widely used for capturing a depth map.\nHowever, such sensors are costly and bulky, thus making them unsuitable for mobile robotics platforms and edge devices.\nIn contrast, monocular depth estimation, which estimates the depth map using a single RGB image, can be easily deployed at a low cost and compact size.\nThus, lightweight deep networks for monocular depth estimation have been widely studied. Recently, state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation methods [ref]1 [ref]2 [ref]3 focus on utilizing the Vision Transformer (ViT) , which enables the model to learn the global information.\nHowever, the Transformers are usually slower than convolutional neural networks (CNN) due to their massive parameters and quadratic complexity of attention computation.\nThis characteristic of the Transformer makes it not applicable directly in real-time tasks.\nTherefore, lightweight deep networks for monocular depth estimation are usually based on CNN   , especially for mobile robotics and embedded devices. To increase the throughput of the Transformer, various methods have been proposed, including redesigning the self-attention    or adopting a CNN-Transformer hybrid architecture     .x\nThe CNN-Transformer hybrid architecture can be categorized into two groups: hierarchy-focused and bottleneck-focused architectures.\nThese architectures focused on the resolution of tokens111For the readers who are not familiar to the Transformer, tokens referred to as features, especially for the feature used as the Transformer input. to reduce the complexity of self-attention.\nThe hierarchy-focused architecture gradually decreased the resolution of tokens using the CNN between Transformer, while the bottleneck-focused architecture used only a low-resolution token by placing the Transformer at the end of CNN blocks.\nIn view of performance, hierarchy-focused architecture shows better accuracy since they can learn the multi-level features containing the global information. However, bottleneck-focused architecture shows better throughput since they apply self-attention only in low-resolution tokens. In this paper, we combine the design concepts of hierarchy-focused and bottleneck-focused architectures.\nThe main idea in the proposed architecture is global token sharing.\nThe hierarchy-focused architecture can learn the multi-level features containing global information. However, repetitive self-attention brings significant computational overhead.\nTo overcome this limitation, the proposed architecture injects the global information into the multi-level features via the shared global token. Specifically, the global tokens and the multi-level features are extracted from a single lightweight CNN and fed to a cross-attention Transformer. Furthermore, like bottleneck-focused architecture, attention is applied to the low-resolution tokens by downsampling the multi-level features.\nThus, via global token sharing, the model can learn rich global information like the hierarchy-focused architecture, with a high throughput like bottleneck-focused architecture. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we experiment with NYU Depth V2  and KITTI datasets , and further examine embedded systems, i.e., NVIDIA Jetson Nano and Jetson TX2, as well as Titan XP.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the proposed model achieves better results than the existing methods with high throughput.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: easily deployed at a low cost and compact size.\nThus, lightweight deep networks for monocular depth estimation have been widely studied.
