[ref]22 proposed a cross-cluster FL based on blockchain for the Internet of medical things.\nTo promote participant engagement and incentivize correct behavior, DeepChain  and Refiner  have introduced incentive mechanisms into their respective blockchain-based FL systems.\nHowever, these works have not considered the limitation of blockchain throughput, which is a critical factor in determining the efficiency of the training process. On the other hand, several studies have implemented blockchain protocols on devices with constrained computational and storage capacities, such as mobile phones and vehicles .\nThese devices are tasked with updating their local models, as well as collecting other updated models and solving computationally intensive puzzles to generate blocks.\nSuch requirements pose significant challenges for edge devices [ref]23.\nFurthermore, the necessity to maintain an ever-expanding local distributed ledger can compound these difficulties, potentially diminishing the efficiency of FL.\nA partial solution involves nodes retaining only a segment of the ledger to reduce storage demands.\nHowever, this approach necessitates frequent interactions with other entities to access information not stored locally, subsequently increasing communication overhead.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: the capacity and concurrency of the centralized master server handling massive participants are usually the bottlenecks to performing the distributed learning.\nRecently, some works such as        [ref]22  have achieved decentralized learning by using blockchain to tackle the bottlenecks, and the typical architecture is shown in Fig. 1 where the training process is orchestrated by distributed\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
