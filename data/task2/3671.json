      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Scene Flow in 3D Point Clouds with Noisy Pseudo Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOptical Flow.\nOptical flow estimation is to capture 2D motions from monocular video frames. As a fundamental tool for 2D scene understanding, many works have extensively studied optical flow estimation. Early approaches       estimate optical flow via energy minimization. Inspired by the success of neural networks, many data-driven approaches  8 8 5 4 0  are proposed to estimate optical flow by training neural networks. Scene Flow from Stereo and RGB-D Videos.\nMany methods  6 9 9 0 2 3 are proposed to estimate scene flow from stereo videos or RGB-D frames. These works formulate scene flow estimation as a problem jointly estimating disparity map and optical flow from stereo frames . Recent works 9 7  propose neural-network-based models to estimate scene flow from stereo video. Some works   focus on estimating scene flow from RGB-D videos. Methods 7 5 6 design self-supervised loss such as photometric consistency loss to train networks in a self-supervised manner. Supervised Scene Flow From Point Clouds.\nEstimating scene flow for point cloud has attracted increasing attention. Most works 6  7  1 3 address the problem of point-cloud-based scene flow estimation through fully supervised learning.\nDifferent from traditional methods  5,\nFlowNet3D 6 proposed a network to learn 3D scene flow from point clouds in an end-to-end manner, where a flow embedding layer was introduced.\nBased on FlowNet3D 6, FlowNet3D++ 8 incorporated geometric constraints to improve FlowNet3D. HPLFlowNet 1 introduced Bilateral Convolutional Layers for estimating scene flow by projecting point clouds into permutohedral lattices.\nFLOT  treated scene flow estimation as a correspondence matching problem, and employ optimal transport to find correspondences between the point clouds. FESTA 7 addressed the issue of farthest point sampling for FlowNet3D 6 by introducing spatial attention layers and temporal attention layers.\nLi et al. 3 enforced point-level and\nregion-level consistency by deploying CRFs based relation modules.\nGojcic et al. 0 proposed a weakly-supervised method for scene flow estimation, by using ground-truth ego motions and foreground and background annotations.\nDifferent from these methods, we focus on learning scene flow without ground-truth scene flow. Self-Supervised Scene Flow From Point Clouds.\nSome works  1 [ref]31 have explored unsupervised or self-supervised learning for estimating scene flow from point clouds. To train the scene flow network without ground-truth annotation, Mittal et al. [ref]31 approximated pseudo scene flow labels based on the coordinate differences.\nSimilarly, Wu et al. [ref]31 chose the Chamfer loss as the proxy loss of self-supervised learning. Besides Chamfer loss, Wu et al. [ref]31 used smoothness constraint and laplacian regularization to enforce the local consistency of predicted scene flow.\nIn addition, PointPWC  proposed a new scene flow network by introducing cost volume, upsampling and warping modules, inspired by optical flow method PWC-Net 0.\nFlowStep3D1 took the inspiration of RAFT  and recurrent architecture to iteratively refine estimate scene flow.\nBesides point coordinates, SelfPF 4 adopted additional measures such as surface normal of point cloud to generate pseudo labels, where optimal transport and random walk were employed to find pseudo correspondences. Different from all these self-supervised methods, our method explores how to generate pseudo scene flow labels from multi-modality data, i.e. monocular RGB images and point clouds. This is also inspired by multi-sensor-based methods on object tracking  , object detection   and point cloud segmentation2 . In addition, we detect noisy labels and propose a noisy-label-aware training scheme to reduce the negative effect of noisy labels on the training, different from existing methods.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: and foreground and background annotations.\nDifferent from these methods, we focus on learning scene flow without ground-truth scene flow. Self-Supervised Scene Flow From Point Clouds.\nSome works  1 [ref]31 have explored unsupervised or self-supervised learning for estimating scene flow from point clouds. To train the scene flow network without ground-truth annotation, Mittal et al. [ref]31\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
