Both computational resources and data are ubiquitous and inherently distributed. All public and private sectors, from scientific research to companies, take benefit from a vast amount of diverse data to support the growth of their business and to develop more accurate Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Data is often spread and segregated in silos across different institutions and even different business units of the same organization. It is essential to make data accessible to all the partners to train high-quality models and exploit the entire data’s value . Many recent open science works have encouraged data sharing between institutions in order to improve research possibilities, create collaborations and publish reproducible results. For example, data sharing across countries has been a crucial information tool during the CoViD-19 pandemic . However, data is often not shareable due to issues like privacy, security, ownership, trust and economic reasons. For instance, the European regulation GDPR  places stringent constraints on the possibility of sharing sensitive data between parties; industrial companies do not share their data because leveraging it is seen as a competitive advantage. Also, exposing data to other institutions can raise concerns like lack of ownership and lack of trust. To address these problems, model-sharing strategies (MSS) have emerged as an alternative to data sharing. In MSS, the idea is to share AI models between the involved parties in order to achieve collaboration without sharing raw data. In these approaches, the AI model can range from simpler Machine Learning (ML) algorithms like linear regression to more complex models such as those learned by Deep Learning techniques using Neural Networks (NNs). Recent years have seen the growth of different model-sharing approaches ranging from the ”model-to-data remote access” approaches to Federated Learning . In ”model-to-data remote access” approaches, AI models are run remotely directly on the machines that hold the data and security is enforced by leveraging secure remote connections and Trusted Execution Enviroments (TEEs) enclaves. Federated Learning has also emerged as a popular approach. In FL, the involved parties collaborate by aggregating locally trained models into a globally shared one. The process is usually iterative and based on NNs (FedAvg) , even if recently methods based on non-NN distributed boosting algorithms have been proposed  . These algorithms allow parties to aggregate any kind of model without making assumptions about the kind of model being aggregated or assuming a training procedure based on gradient descent [ref]6. FL is a distributed ML technique originally proposed by Google in 2016 to deal with sensitive data of mobile devices .\nFL is an iterative version of model-sharing: clients (the data owners) create a federation (hence the name) together with the server and build a shared model based on the following steps: 1) clients send their metadata, like the number of classes, training set size, test set size and shape of the input features, to the server, that initializes a model based on the received metadata characteristics; 2) the server sends the initialized model to all the participants of the federation; 3) after performing one or more steps of gradient descent, clients send the trained model back to the server; 4) server acts as an aggregator performing a combination (a function like average, sum, maximum, minimum and so on) of the received models. The aggregated model is now sent to the clients, and steps 3) and 4) are repeated until a specified number of rounds are performed, or a convergence criterion is met. The first proposed FL algorithm is the FedAvg  algorithm, where the aggregation function used to combine models is the average. In this way, all datasets are kept within the proprietary organizations, and the only information that gets exchanged is the model parameters, that in the case of NN, are matrices of floating point numbers representing the weights and the biases associated with the neurons. Federated Learning performs well when the data is independently and identically distributed (IID) among the involved institutions. Unfortunately, real-world data is often non-IID, and it is well known that this scenario poses critical issues to FL . In a non-IID setting, the data statistics of a single client may be unrepresentative of the global statistics and make the model diverge from the intended solution. Interestingly, Huang at al. show that if the loss surface of the optimization problem is both smooth and convex (which is hardly true in a real scenario), then FedAvg will also converge when the data is non-IID . Recent works have proposed several FL algorithms to cope with non-IIDness problems, such as FedProx [ref]8, FedNova , SCAFFOLD 0, and FedCurv 1, which has been tested in 2 3. Notice that all these algorithms are modified versions of FedAvg and they preserve the principle underneat FedAvg: to average the weights in all the layers of the NN. Most of the common NN architectures employ Batch Normalization (BN) 4, a technique for improving the training of NNs to make them converge faster and to a more stable solution. BN works by standardizing the layers’ input for each mini-batch. In this work, we investigate two aspects of the training FL models which, differently from cenytralized case, they happen to be hyper-parameters that can be optimized: the normalization layers and the frequency of models aggregation (epochs per round). We show that the most popular normalization layer (BN) does not couple well with FL for non-IID data and that substituting BN with alternative normalization FL a better model can be produced for both the non-IID and IID case. We also show that building a global model aggregating local models at each epoch is not a good strategy, neither for quality of the model nor for the execution time. We experiment with two network architectures and five different normalization layers on two public image datasets: MNIST 5 and CIFAR-10 6.\nResults show that the performance of the networks is strictly related to the type of normalization layer adopted. The main contributions of this work are: We provide benchmarks for five different normalization layers: BN, GN, LN, IN, BRN; We provide results of experiments on FedAvg on two non-IID settings considering a feature distribution skew and a labels distribution skew (in addition to the IID case). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work providing empirical evidence on the behaviour of these normalization layers in common non-IID cases; for the most promising normalization layers, we ran extensive tests to discuss how performances are affected by the following factors: Batch size. Number of epochs per round (E). Number of clients. We show that choosing the right normalization layer and a suitable number of local gradient descent steps is crucial for obtaining good performances. This work extends the typical search for optimization of machine learning parameters to federated learning. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce and discuss recent related works. In Section III, the most used normalization layers are reviewed. In Section IV, the most typical non-IID scenarios are described. Section V shows and discusses experimental results. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: .
