      "content": "Paper Title: HYPER2: Hyperbolic Poincaré Embedding for Hyper-Relational Link Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere has been a growing number of work in embedding graph data in non-Euclidean spaces. Hyperbolic embedding was brought into link prediction in the lexical database WordNet on the Poincaré ball in by Nickel and Kiela, who show that hyperbolic embedding with low dimension is capable of significantly outperforming their higher-dimensional Euclidean counterparts in terms of both generalization ability and representation capability. Subsequently, the same team embeds hierarchical data in the Lorentz model of hyperbolic geometry[ref]23. Combining hyperbolic geometry with deep learning, Hyperbolic Neural Networks, Hyperbolic Attention Networks and Hyperbolic Graph Convolution NetWork are proposed. More recently, it is noted that non-uniform hierarchy[ref]27 like circular structrue can be found in data so that graph starts to be embedded on a product manifold with components of different curvature(spherical, hyperbolic and Euclidean). Following Poincaré GloVe[ref]28, another multi-relational Poincaré based method Murp, employing bilinear scoring function and bias for head and tail entity, shows strong expressive power in modelling hierarhy. In , hyperbolic Poincaré embedding is combined with RotatE. To the best of our knowledge, embedding hyper-relational KGs on a hyperbolic poincaré ball is unexplored.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: Euclidean counterparts in terms of both generalization ability and representation capability.
