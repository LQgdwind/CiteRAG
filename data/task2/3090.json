      "content": "Paper Title: MixSyn: Learning Composition and Style for Multi-Source Image Synthesis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs MixSyn is the first of its kind, we compare our results to single-source [ref]34 [ref]11, sequential multi-source [ref]16 , and collage-based  approaches. These approaches (i) cannot generate from multiple sources simultaneously, (ii) depend on given/modified mask, (iii) cannot compose novel masks, (iv) do not learn BOTH structure and style end-to-end, and (v) cannot generate from partial or fuzzy masks. We start with justifying these claims. As per (i-ii), we feed four combinations of (copy-paste/our) x (mask/image) pairs in Fig. 5 as alternative inputs to SPADE [ref]34, SEAN  and Mask Guided CGAN [ref]16. Although results improve from copy-paste masks (Fig 6, col. 1 & 3) to our generated masks (2 & 4), quality of their results are not close to ours (Fig 5), supporting (ii-iii). We also investigate how others reconstruct our result image with our mask (col. 4). Because (iv-v) above, they simply cannot. In Fig. 7, we select a base mask (top left in Fig. 5) because of (ii-iii), and swap segments following the sequential (hence (i)) component transfer applications of  [ref]16, shown in the first two columns. Despite looking better than col. 1-4 in Fig. 6, it is akin to a blended copy-paste, which creates the zoomed-in artifacts (e.g., different neck and nose colors, and shadow mustache), because they are not jointly composing new masks and generating new images as MixSyn does (iv-v). For the third column, we use the copy-paste image as the collage for  input. Although there are less visual artifacts compared to the other two, there are empty areas and inconsistent hair style within the segment. The difference in similarity scores also proves that styles per regions are not as-well preserved as ours, questioning the realism over fidelity of . Quantitative comparison of MixSyn also supports and generalizes these claims. In Table 1, we list SSIM, RMSE, PSNR, and FID scores of Pix2PixHD , SPADE [ref]34, SEAN ,\nour structure generator, and overall MixSyn architecture on CelebAMask-HQ dataset . Although our reconstruction is not as exact (worse RMSE), our generator network is better (better FID). We note that from our compositions to our images, similarity decreases (better SSIM and PSNR for MixSyn Str) as expected, but our style generator exploits novel compositions and achieves a better FID. We list same metrics for the example in Fig. 7, which are also better than SOTA. Please also check detailed reconstruction scores (Supp. C.), region similarity scores for random images (Supp. D), and rest of Fig. 6 scores in Supp. F.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: As MixSyn is the first of its kind, we compare our results to single-source [ref]34 [ref]11, sequential multi-source [ref]16 , and collage-based  approaches.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
