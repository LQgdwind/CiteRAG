      "content": "Paper Title: Topology optimization for acoustic structures considering viscous and thermal boundary layers using a sequential linearized Navier–Stokes model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nControlling the propagation behavior of acoustic waves is important to achieve a comfortable environment, and various types of acoustic devices are used to obtain desired acoustic performance.\nFor example, unwanted sounds can be reduced using sound barrier walls or sound-absorbing materials.\nAcoustic metamaterials , artificial composite structures exhibiting extraordinary properties that cannot be attained in homogeneous acoustic media that naturally exist,\n have expanded the possibilities in acoustic wave control. In particular, negative refraction is achieved by a metamaterial that simultaneously possesses negative mass density and negative bulk modulus . Novel acoustic devices with acoustic cloaking structure  and acoustic hyperlenses  have been realized owing to the unusual properties of metamaterials. As represented by the abovementioned example, acoustic structures, i.e., composite structures that efficiently control acoustic wave propagation behavior, have been widely used. The performance of acoustic structures, such as transmission coefficients, reflection coefficients, and effective material parameters, is heavily influenced by structural design. Therefore, topology optimization is a powerful tool for designing acoustic structures with exceptional features. Its design offers the highest degree of freedom of any structural optimization method and has been used to solve acoustic problems after Bendsøe and Kikuchi  developed it for linear elasticity problems. Many optimization examples for designing acoustic devices are available. Wadbro and Berggren optimized an acoustic horn . Du and Olhoff  optimized a bi-material structure design to minimize sound radiation. Topology optimization has also been used to optimize acoustic metamaterials. Lu et al.  reported an optimized unit cell configuration with negative bulk modulus. Dong et al. [ref]9 used genetic algorithm-based topology optimization to develop a double-negative acoustic metamaterial that induced negative refraction. A topology optimization method for a planar type of acoustic metamaterials was proposed based on the estimation using a two-scale homogenization method 0. This method has been extended for metamaterials composed of multiple unit cells 1. Moreover, topology optimization can address acoustic-elastic coupled problems. A comparative review of topology optimization for acoustic-elastic coupled systems has been previously reported 2. Acoustic devices that produce audible sound frequently have narrow channels via which acoustic waves propagate. A typical hearing aid device has compact microphones and speakers that can be worn in the ear. Wind musical instruments have pipes that generate standing waves, and the sound is produced by blowing into them. Almost all of the acoustic metamaterials discussed above, including topology-optimized ones, are composed of a periodic array of microstructures, with tiny channels and cavities included in each unit cell to induce local resonances. The behavior of acoustic waves propagating in these narrow channels differs from that in bulk, and thermal and viscous boundary layers influence acoustic waves. Airborne sound is impacted by viscous forces that are proportional to the velocity gradient owing to the viscosity of air. When the nonslip boundary condition is imposed on the channel’s surface, the velocity is driven to zero. Then, using a thin boundary layer, a significant velocity gradient is formed. Moreover, acoustic pressure perturbation generates temperature perturbation in the bulk region. Owing to the difference in thermal conductivities between air and solid, this perturbation becomes zero at the channel’s surface, and the transition in the temperature field from the surface to the bulk yields a substantial temperature gradient, thus resulting in the thermal boundary layer. These boundary layers dampen the acoustic pressure, and the damping increases as the surface-to-volume ratio increases. Acoustic metamaterials are no exception when it comes to viscous and thermal boundary layer phenomena. Moleron et al. 3 theoretically and experimentally investigated these effects on rigid slab-based metamaterials’ transmission and reflection characteristics. They reported that losses induced by boundary layers affect resonances in metamaterials and they are substantially dependent on geometrical parameters. Christiansen and Sigmund 4 established the experimental validation of a topology-optimized acoustic metamaterial. The sample used in the experiment was 3D printed based on an optimized design developed using a density-based topology optimization algorithm 5 without considering the viscothermal losses with the aim of achieving a negative refractive wave propagation behavior. In addition to the desired negative refraction behavior, they detected unexpected sound attenuation, which was considered to be produced by the boundary layer effects. Henríquez et al. 6 observed that an acoustic metamaterial intended to demonstrate double-negative behavior did not perform as anticipated owing to sound absorption and the existence of viscous and thermal boundary layers. Furthermore, Huang et al. 7 proposed a broadband sound-absorbing metamaterial composed of multiple numbers of neck-embedded Helmholtz resonators, which are designed to generate coherent coupling of resonances while accounting for viscous and thermal losses. These examples show that considering the viscous and thermal boundary layer effects is critical when designing acoustic structures. Although the abovementioned studies of topology optimization for acoustics did not consider these effects, an optimization approach with viscothermal losses could explore more realistic designs that demonstrate desirable functions. An adequate numerical analysis model is necessary to conduct such an optimization. There are numerous acoustic analysis models available that account for boundary layer effects. A set of linearized Navier–Stokes equations is used in a full linearized Navier–Stokes (FLNS) model. This linearization is based on small fluctuations in the still air equilibrium condition. The finite element method (FEM) can be used to generate numerical solutions; however, the computational cost is high because the equations are strongly coupled with state fields. Kirchhoff 8 studied analytical solutions to the linearized Navier–Stokes equations defined in an infinite cylinder with a rigid isothermal wall as its surface. Tijdeman 9 validates Zwikker and Kosten’s 0 simplified Kirchhoff solution, and the low reduced frequency (LRF) model was proposed. This model can efficiently obtain the acoustic pressure by deriving the pressure field from 1D or 2D problems and analytically accounting for viscothermal effects. However, it is only valid if acoustic waves propagate in layers or tubes with cross-sections smaller than the acoustic wavelength. Bossart et al. 1 proposed the boundary layer impedance model based on the isentropic Helmholtz equation, which is extensively used to characterize undamped acoustic waves in bulk with a boundary condition equivalent to the viscothermal effects. This boundary condition depends on the estimation of the tangential wavenumber defined on the channel surface, which necessitates iterative acoustic pressure computation. Furthermore, the boundary layer impedance model is only valid if the thickness of the boundary layer is substantially thinner than all of the geometry’s characteristic lengths. Recently, Berggren et al. 2 proposed a similar method that requires only one solution of the isentropic Helmholtz equation with a Wentzell boundary condition; however, their model does not apply to surfaces with large curvatures because the boundary condition is derived based on the assumption that the surfaces are flat. A sequential linearized Navier–Stokes (SLNS) model suggested by Kampinga et al. 3 is another model for viscothermal acoustics. The governing equation of this model is derived from the set of equations used in the FLNS model. They considered a case in which the acoustic wavelength is much larger than the viscous and thermal boundary layer thicknesses for airborne sound in the audible frequency range. This assumption simplifies the equations in the FLNS model and weakly coupled Helmholtz equations are derived corresponding to the viscous and thermal fields, in addition to the acoustic pressure. This model does not impose any assumptions about the geometry as opposed to the previously discussed models, except for the FLNS model. Because three types of weakly coupled systems must be solved without dimension reduction, it requires additional computational effort compared to the LRF model and models proposed by Bossart et al. 1 and Berggren et al. 2. However, its computational cost is lower than that of the FLNS model owing to the simplification of the FLNS equations. Furthermore, the acoustic-elastic coupled analysis can be conducted with the SLNS model in which the deformation of the solid medium is considered, as found in 3. Structural optimization methods have recently been combined with these analysis models for viscothermal acoustics. Christensen 4 conducted topology optimization for a hearing aid application example using the LRF model. Tissot et al. 5 proposed a shape optimization method in which the viscothermal acoustic model proposed by Berggren et al. 2 was used, and XFEM cut elements were used to impose the abovementioned boundary conditions. However, these optimization methods have restrictions on the structure’s geometry because of their analysis models, as previously mentioned. Andersen et al. 6 proposed a shape optimization method for acoustic structures by considering viscothermal losses estimated using a dissipative boundary element method (BEM). Although this method has no geometry limitation, it was emphasized in 6 that the adjoint system cannot be solved in the BEM’s framework. Rather than using the sensitivity based on the adjoint variable method, the finite difference method was introduced in 6; however, it costs considerable computational time when a large number of design variables is considered. Generally, the design variables in topology optimization are larger than that of shape optimization; the direct use of this approach to topology optimization seems difficult. As explained, the SLNS model can be applied to any geometry for audible sounds. A topology optimization method incorporated with the SLNS model and associated adjoint variable-based sensitivity analysis enables optimal design of acoustic structures, including metamaterials, considering the viscous and thermal boundary layer effects without restricting the optimized structure design.\nIn this study, we propose a level set-based topology optimization method, which was proposed by Yamada et al. 7, combined with the SLNS model for a viscothermal acoustics system.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of the SLNS model and its derivation from the FLNS model. In Section 3, we explain the design settings and formulate the optimization problem. As the viscous and thermal boundary layers play an important role in optimization, we target a sound-absorbing structure comprising air and an isothermal rigid medium, and its sound absorption coefficients over a specific frequency range are set as an objective function. In addition, the design sensitivity is approximately derived based on the adjoint variable method and the topological derivative concept 8, and its explicit formula is obtained. Subsequently, a level set-based topology optimization method is introduced in Section 4. Numerical implementation, including the FEM-based discretization for state and adjoint variables and the optimization algorithm, is discussed in Section 5. Two 2D numerical examples are provided in Section 6, corresponding to the maximization of the absorption coefficients in closed and open tubes, respectively. Optimized designs are demonstrated, and their performances are examined using the SLNS and FLNS models. Furthermore, we discuss the cause of the high absorption coefficients of these designs using the FLNS model.\nWe demonstrate the importance of considering boundary layers in the optimization in Appendices A and B by offering optimized designs with and without boundary layers.\nFinally, conclusions are summarized in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: sound radiation.
