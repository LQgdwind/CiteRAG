      "content": "Paper Title: Identification of Driver Phone Usage Violations via State-of-the-Art Object Detection with Tracking\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 1.3 million people die each year as a result of road traffic accidents . A contributing factor towards this is the use of a handheld mobile devices while operating a motor vehicle. Drivers using a mobile phone are approximately four times more likely to be involved in a crash than drivers not using their phone . In 2017, the UK Government doubled the penalty for using a mobile phone while driving to 6 points and a £200 fine (up from 3 points and £100) . A study carried out in 2015 suggests that there is a negative correlation between a higher fine and the likelihood of a person using their phone . Typically, catching drivers using their phones involves road-side police performing the laborious task of capturing the violation as it happens. Unless there are significant resources dedicated to this task, there is a strong probability that many of these violations will go undetected. This opens the door for a more automated process of capturing these violations. Recent years have seen the development of object detection in video surveillance [ref]4. Object detection frameworks such as Faster Region Based Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R-CNN) [ref]5 and Single Shot Detector (SSD)  have made it possible to take video images and detect objects with both high accuracy and speed . In this work, we propose a fully-automated system that will take live video from roadside surveillance cameras and detect if a driver is using a mobile phone whilst the vehicle is in operation. We will explore different quality cameras (high-end and low-end) whilst addressing challenges such as windscreen glare, tinted windows and low-light scenarios. In order for the system to be fully automated, it will need to have the ability to log each unique violation as well as to save the images corresponding to each violation. We propose two methods for achieving this task; first, a single-step method focusing on efficiency and speed, using a single trained model to detect violations. This method will suffer a trade-off with accuracy due to potential issues caused by having to find an extremely small object (phone) within a large image. The second method (two-step) focuses on achieving high accuracy by running two individually trained models simultaneously. The single-step system is trained to detect two classes, namely mobile phone and licence plate with the plate only used as a method of counting the total number of vehicles. The two-step system (Figure 1) first detects the windscreen and then uses the cropped image of the driver’s side of the windscreen as the input to the second step to detect the mobile phone. Similar to the licence plate in the first (single-step) method, the windscreen is used to count the number of vehicles so the number of detections can be worked out as a proportion to the total number of vehicles. Models are trained using a number of different state-of-the art object detector frameworks. These include YOLO (You Only Look Once) v3 [ref]8 and v4 , SSD 0 1, Faster R-CNN [ref]5 and Centernet 1. Model performance is measured via Average Precision (AP) 2, and using both the PASCAL VOC evaluation metric where the Intersection Over Union (IoU) score is >>0.5 3, whilst also testing IoU>>0.1 due to the nature of objects being detected in this particular application. The proposed solution will be designed to work with a live video; therefore, we also evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method by calculating the frame rate of the output - i.e. frames per second (FPS). The images that are used to train our model on the phone class will predominantly be obtained and created especially for this project. In order for the model to detect mobile phone use violations with a reasonable level of accuracy, the training images will be replications of the real-world scenario of a person using their phone whilst driving (examples of training images can be seen in Figure 8). Once the final model is chosen, we integrate a tracking algorithm 4 into our model to avoid the issue of logging multiple detections for the same violation. This will allow the system to keep track of the total number of violations for a given duration. This data can then be analysed using a purposely designed user interface. This work aims to successfully develop a system that can work with a roadside camera 24 hours a day to automatically detect whether a person is using their mobile phone when in operation of a motor vehicle. In short, the primary contributions of this paper are as follows: Train and evaluate multiple object detection methods [ref]8  0 1 [ref]5 to detect mobile phone use violations with a reasonable degree of accuracy and speed by establishing an appropriate trade-off between predictive performance and efficiency. Test the trained models on both full images and cropped windscreens to determine if a single-step or two-step approach is more appropriate. The single-step method operates on the full image only, while the two-step system first finds windscreen and then uses this cropped image to detect the phone (Section III). Establish what can be achieved with on a low-cost budget using a low-end consumer camera solution as well as providing insights on what can be achieved with a reasonable budget using high-end cameras. Ensure issues such as windscreen glare and poorly-lit environments are addressed so the system can work at any time of the day. Integrate a tracking algorithm 4 to identify unique detections in order to log useful data whilst providing snapshots of the violations. Collected data can be accessed through a purposely designed user interface. To better enable reproducibility, the source code for the project is publicly available111https://github.com/carrell-ncl/Windscreen2. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Related work on mobile phone usage detection within the existing literature is presented in Section II. The proposed approach is described in Section III. Experimental results are examined and discussed in Section IV. We address limitations and future work in Section V, before finally concluding the paper in Section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: these violations will go undetected.
