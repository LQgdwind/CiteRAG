We follow the similar evaluation protocol as for human motion synthesis/prediction [ref]17 [ref]43 [ref]57 and employ the following metrics to evaluate our method. (1) To measure the distribution similarity between the generated sequences and the ground-truth motions, we adopt the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)  where μ⋅∈ℝFsubscript𝜇⋅superscriptℝ𝐹\\mu_{\\cdot}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{F} and Σ⋅∈ℝF×FsubscriptΣ⋅superscriptℝ𝐹𝐹\\Sigma_{\\cdot}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{F\\times F} are the mean and covariance matrix of perception features obtained from a pretrained action recognition model, with F𝐹F the dimension of the perception features. The detail of the action recognition model is included in the supplementary material. T​r​(⋅)𝑇𝑟⋅Tr(\\cdot) computes the trace of a matrix. (2) To evaluate motion realism, we report the action recognition accuracy of the generated motions using the same pretrained action recognition model as above. (3) To evaluate per-action diversity, we measure the pairwise distance between the multiple future motions generated from the same historical motion and action label111Note that we only report diversity per action because motions of different actions are inherently diverse.. Specifically, given a set of future motions {𝐘^i}i=1Ssuperscriptsubscriptsuperscript^𝐘𝑖𝑖1𝑆\\{\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}^{i}\\}_{i=1}^{S} predicted by our model, the diversity is computed as where Tmaxsubscript𝑇maxT_{\\text{max}} is the maximum number of frames our model can predict, and 𝐲^kisubscriptsuperscript^𝐲𝑖𝑘\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}^{i}_{k} represents the k𝑘k-th frame of motion 𝐘^isuperscript^𝐘𝑖\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}^{i}. To calculate above mentioned diversity, we assume that the model generates the maximum number of future frames in all cases. To further evaluate the diversity across variable length future motions, we compute the average per-action diversity after performing Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) \nWith a minor abuse of notation, let {𝐘^i}i=1Ssuperscriptsubscriptsuperscript^𝐘𝑖𝑖1𝑆\\{\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}^{i}\\}_{i=1}^{S} denote the set of variable length predictions. DTW then temporally aligns any pair of motions as 𝐘~i,𝐘~j=D​T​W​(𝐘^i,𝐘^j),superscript~𝐘𝑖superscript~𝐘𝑗𝐷𝑇𝑊superscript^𝐘𝑖superscript^𝐘𝑗\\tilde{\\mathbf{Y}}^{i},\\tilde{\\mathbf{Y}}^{j}=DTW(\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}^{i},\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}^{j})\\;,\nwhere 𝐘~isuperscript~𝐘𝑖\\tilde{\\mathbf{Y}}^{i} and 𝐘~j∈ℝK×Ti,jsuperscript~𝐘𝑗superscriptℝ𝐾subscript𝑇𝑖𝑗\\tilde{\\mathbf{Y}}^{j}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times T_{i,j}} have the same number of frames (Ti,jsubscript𝑇𝑖𝑗T_{i,j}). We then compute the diversity after DTW as (4) To measure the prediction accuracy, we adopt the Average Displacement Error (ADE) computed as where T𝑇T is the length of the ground-truth future motion, 𝐲^kisubscriptsuperscript^𝐲𝑖𝑘\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}^{i}_{k} is the k𝑘k-th frame of the i𝑖i-th sample generated by the model with the ground-truth action label222Since we only have the ground-truth future motion for the ground-truth action label. and 𝐲ksubscript𝐲𝑘\\mathbf{y}_{k} the corresponding ground truth. Similarly to the diversity, we report the ADE after DTW (A​D​Ew𝐴𝐷subscript𝐸wADE_{\\text{w}}). Baselines. Since there is no prior work that tackles the task we\nintroduce, we adapt the state-of-the-art action-specific human motion\nsynthesis methods, Action2Motion [ref]17,\nACTOR [ref]43, and stochastic human motion prediction method, DLow [ref]57, to our task. Action2Motion [ref]17 relies on a frame-wise motion VAE with GRUs to encode the temporal information. We adapt their VAE so as to take the temporal feature of historical poses as an additional input for both encoding and decoding. This temporal feature is extracted from a GRU-based temporal data encoding module. Similarly, we modify the transformer decoder of ACTOR [ref]43 to condition it on the historical motion. Furthermore, we adapt the VAE in DLow [ref]57 to take the action label as input. Implementation details.\nWe implement our models in Pytorch  and train them using the ADAM  optimizer for 500 epochs.\nWe use different hyperparameters for different models. In particular, for RNN-based model, the initial learning rate is 0.001 on BABEL and 0.002 on all the other datasets. We set the loss weights (λrecsubscript𝜆rec\\lambda_{\\text{rec}}, λsmoothsubscript𝜆smooth\\lambda_{\\text{smooth}}) to (50.0, 10.0) for BABEL dataset and (100.0,100.0) for all the other ones. For Transformer-based model, the initial learning rate is 0.0001 on BABEL and 0.0005 on all the other datasets. The loss weights (λrecsubscript𝜆rec\\lambda_{\\text{rec}}, λsmoothsubscript𝜆smooth\\lambda_{\\text{smooth}}) are set to (100.0, 10.0) for BABEL dataset and (1000.0,100.0) for all the other ones.
