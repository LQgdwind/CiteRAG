      "content": "Paper Title: Contrastive Representation Disentanglement for Clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. We perform the experimental evaluation on CIFAR10¬†, CIFAR100-20¬†, STL10¬† and ImageNet¬†. Some prior works¬†[ref]4 [ref]1  use the full dataset for both training and evaluation. Here, we follow the experimental settings in SCAN¬†, which trains and evaluates the model using train and val split respectively. This helps us to understand the generalizability of our method on unseen samples. All datasets are processed using the same augmentations in MoCo v2¬†[ref]20. We report the results with the mean and standard deviation from 5 different runs. Implementation details. We apply the standard ResNet¬† backbones (ResNet-18 and ResNet-50) each with a MLP projection head. The dimensionality of ùê≥csuperscriptùê≥ùëê\\mathbf{z}^{c} is determined by the number of clusters, and the dimensionality of ùê≥nsuperscriptùê≥ùëõ\\mathbf{z}^{n} is set to 256 on the ImageNet and 128 on the other datasets. On the smaller datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100-20 and STL10), our implementation is based on the Lightly library¬†. The parameters are trained through the SGD optimizer with a learning rate of 6e-2, a momentum of 0.9, and a weight decay of 5e-4. The loss term is set to Œ±=5.0ùõº5.0\\alpha=5.0, and two temperature values are set to œÑ=0.15ùúè0.15\\tau=0.15 and t=0.10ùë°0.10t=0.10. We adopt the same data augmentation in SimCLR¬† but disable the blur like MoCo v2¬†[ref]20. We train the models from scratch for 1200 epochs using batches of size 512. For the linear classification in the ablation studies,\nwe train the linear classifier via the SGD optimizer with a learning rate of 30 and the cosine scheduler for 100 epochs. For ImageNet subsets (100 classes and 200 classes), we adopt the implementation from MoCo v2 and follow the same data augmentation settings in MoCo v2. To speed up training, we directly initialize the backbone with the released pretrained weights (800 epochs pretrained) like SCAN, and only train the MLP head. The weights are updated through SGD optimizer with a learning rate of 0.03, a momentum of 0.9, and a weight decay of 1e-4. The three hyperparameters are set to Œ±=1.0ùõº1.0\\alpha=1.0, œÑ=0.40ùúè0.40\\tau=0.40 and t=0.20ùë°0.20t=0.20. We train the network weights for 400 epochs using a batch size of 256. Although there are advanced data augmentation and training strategies, we adopt the same settings in MoCo v2 for a fair comparison. Equipartition constraint. Most of the Sinkhorn-Knopp implementation are directly from SwAV work¬†. The regularization parameter is set to œµ=0.05italic-œµ0.05\\epsilon=0.05 and the number of Sinkhorn iterations is set to 3 for all experiments.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Datasets. We perform the experimental evaluation on CIFAR10¬†, CIFAR100-20¬†, STL10¬† and ImageNet¬†. Some prior works¬†[ref]4 [ref]1  use the full dataset for both training and evaluation. Here, we follow the experimental settings in SCAN¬†, which trains and evaluates the model using train and val split respectively.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
