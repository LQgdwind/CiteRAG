      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-learning for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation with closed-form solvers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA large number of studies have been dedicated to overcoming the sample selection bias induced\nby the so-called fundamental problem of causal inference 4,\nnamely, that we can never jointly observe the two potential outcomes for each individual\n(see e.g.,  for a literature review).\nA major classical strategy for dealing with this sample selection bias\nis matching  ,\nwhich aims to estimate the unobserved potential outcome\nby employing the information about the neighbor individual\nwho is nearest to the target individual in terms of feature attributes.\nAlthough seeking the nearest neighbor is difficult especially in a high-dimensional setting,\nthe traditional methods tackle this difficulty\nby seeking the neighbors in the space of propensity score,\nwhich is the probability that an individual receives a treatment  . The recent methods have achieved successful CATE estimation performance\nusing complex machine learning models, such as\ntree-based models  ,\nGaussian processes ,\nand neural networks 7 [ref]32 .\nAmong these methods,\nCounterfactual regression (CFR) [ref]32\nis a well-known neural-network-based method,\nwhich learns a shared representation that is used\nto predict two potential outcomes.\nIn contrast to these model-specific methods,\nthe model-agnostic methods,\nsuch as T-Learner, X-Learner, and DR-Learner 2 0,\ncan use any arbitrary machine learning model\nand hence have attracted a growing attention\nas a flexible tool for investigating heterogeneous treatment effects.\nNote that although these methods are called meta-learners,\nthey are not related to meta-learning (i.e., learning to learn)\nin the field of machine learning.\nIn this article, we use “meta-learning” to denote learning to learn,\nwhich uses the data from various tasks 1. The weakness of these machine-learning-based methods is that\nthey require a lot of observational data for model fitting.\nTo resolve this weakness,\nmany methods aim to improve the data efficiency\nby employing the techniques from\ntransfer learning 3 8  \nand multi-task learning   4 .\nA common disadvantage of these methods is that\nthey require data about target tasks in the training phase,\nwhich limits the scope of the CATE estimation applications.\nMoreover,\ntransfer-learning-based methods assume that there are only two tasks (i.e., source and target),\nand multi-task-learning-based methods train the models without consideration of the few-shot setting.\nDue to these disadvantages, none of these methods\ncan be applied to the real-world scenarios\nwhere we have access to only a few instances of observational data.\nTo overcome these weaknesses,\nthe proposed meta-learning-based method trains the models\nsuch that the test performance given a small number of observational data is improved.\nTo perform such a training procedure,\nit aims to simulate the few-shot setting in meta-training steps\nbased on an episodic training framework . Although there are several causal inference methods founded on meta-learning,\ntheir problem setup is different;\nmost of these methods focus on causal discovery\n(i.e., the inference of the causal directions among random variables)  9 ,\nnot on the CATE estimation.\nA notable exception is the Meta-CI method ,\nwhich borrows the idea of the CFR method [ref]32 and\nlearns a shared representation for each task to estimate the two potential outcomes.\nCompared with Meta-CI, our proposed method has two advantages.\nFirst, it performs meta-learning such that the expected CATE estimation\nperformance is improved\nusing the CATE values estimated with large data as supervision.\nUtilizing such CATE values, which we call pseudo CATEs, is important\nfor achieving high performance in CATE estimation,\nwhere we have no access to the true labels.\nThe second advantage is that it offers closed-form task adaptation for CATE estimation.\nThis advantage is crucial in meta-learning\nbecause\nthe recent studies\nshow that the closed-form solvers for task adaptation\ncan greatly improve the classification and\nregression performances  [ref]5.\nWhereas there are several closed-form solvers\nin the field of meta-learning  [ref]5 6 6,\nnone of them can be directly applied to training the models in meta-learners,\nwhich are founded on the two-stage-based estimation,\nwhere the outputs of one regression model are used for training another regression model.\nAlthough developing closed-form solvers in such a setting is challenging,\nit makes a significant contrast to the meta-CI method,\nwhich, as with CFR, is founded on a nonconvex regularizer on distributional discrepancy,\nmaking impossible to analytically solve the optimization problem.\nIn Section 4,\nwe experimentally show that each of these advantages yields a considerable estimation performance gain.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: a treatment  . The recent methods have achieved successful CATE estimation performance\nusing complex machine learning models, such as\ntree-based models  ,\nGaussian processes ,\nand neural networks 7 [ref]32 .\nAmong these methods,\nCounterfactual regression (CFR) [ref]32\nis a well-known neural-network-based method,\nwhich learns a shared representation that is used\nto predict two potential\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
