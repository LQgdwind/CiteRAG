Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: SUNY: A Visual Interpretation Framework for Convolutional Neural Networks from a Necessary and Sufficient Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBaseline Methods.\nWe compare SUNY with seven popular class-discriminative visual explanation methods proposed between 2017 and 2021: Grad-CAM¬†[ref]31, Grad-CAM++¬†[ref]4, SmoothGrad¬†, RISE¬†[ref]28, Score-CAM¬†, CexCNN¬†, and Group-CAM¬†. Datasets and CNN Models.\nThe experiments involve two commonly-used public image datasets, ILSVRC2012 (ILSVRC)¬† with 100010001000 classes and 50‚Äãk50ùëò50k images in the validation set and CUB-200-2011 (CUB)¬† with 200200200 classes and 579457945794 images in the validation set.\nWe use the baseline methods and SUNY to explain two CNN models with different architectures, including VGG16¬† and Inception-v3¬†.\nFor ILSVRC, trained models are from TorchVision¬†.\nFor CUB, we apply transfer-learning with a training batch size of 128128128 and standard data augmentations, including the random resized crop and random horizontal flip. Implementation Details.\nWe implement SUNY and the seven aforementioned visual explanation methods in Python using PyTorch framework¬†.\nSpecifically, we run the official or publicly available code of other methods as the results at the same data scale are unavailable.\nThe platform is equipped with two NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs.\nUnless explicitly stated, the comparisons discussed in this section are conducted following the same settings, including ‚Äì (1) Images are converted to the RGB format, resized to 224√ó224224224224\\times 224 (VGG16) or 299√ó299299299299\\times 299 (Inception-v3), transformed to tensors, and normalized to the range of   . (2) All visual explanation methods‚Äô results are generated for both models in the validation sets of both datasets, where we use all images predicted correctly by the models. (3) Explanations are applied to the last convolutional layer for explaining the predicted class. We bilinearly interpolate the results to the required size of each experiment.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: Baseline Methods.\nWe compare SUNY with seven popular class-discriminative visual explanation methods proposed between 2017 and 2021: Grad-CAM¬†[ref]31, Grad-CAM++¬†[ref]4, SmoothGrad¬†, RISE¬†[ref]28, Score-CAM¬†, CexCNN¬†, and Group-CAM¬†.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
