The study of this problem dates back to at least 35 years ago .\nA linear space and O​(n1−1/D+o​(1))𝑂superscript𝑛11𝐷𝑜1O(n^{1-1/D+o(1)}) query time structure\nis given by Agarwal, Matoušek, and Sharir ,\ndue to the recent “polynomial method” breakthrough .\nHowever, it is not entirely clear what happens to the “fast-query” case:\nif we insist on polylogarithmic query time,\nwhat is the smallest possible space usage?\nEarly on, some believed that the number of parameters\nplays an important role and thus O~​(nβ)~𝑂superscript𝑛𝛽\\tilde{O}(n^{\\beta}) space\ncould be a reasonable conjecture , but\nsuch a data structure was not found until 2019 .\nHowever, after the “polynomial method” revolution, and specifically\nafter the breakthrough result of Agarwal, Matoušek and Sharir ,\nit could also be reasonably conjectured that O~​(nD)~𝑂superscript𝑛𝐷\\tilde{O}(n^{D}) could also be the right bound.\nHowever, this was refuted recently by\nAfshani and Cheng [ref]3 who\nshowed that in 2D, and for polynomials for the form y−∑i=0Δxi≤0𝑦superscriptsubscript𝑖0Δsuperscript𝑥𝑖0y-\\sum_{i=0}^{\\Delta}x^{i}\\leq 0, there exists\nan Ω𝑜​(nΔ+1)𝑜Ωsuperscript𝑛Δ1\\overset{\\scriptscriptstyle o}{\\Omega}(n^{\\Delta+1}) space lower bound for data structures with query time O𝑜​(1)𝑜𝑂1\\overset{\\scriptscriptstyle o}{O}(1).\nHowever, this lower bound does not go far enough, even in 2D,\nwhere a semialgebraic range can be specified by\nbivariate monic polynomial inequalities222\nWe define that a D𝐷D-variate polynomial P​(X1,X2,⋯,XD)𝑃subscript𝑋1subscript𝑋2⋯subscript𝑋𝐷P(X_{1},X_{2},\\cdots,X_{D})\nis monic if the coefficient of X2Δsuperscriptsubscript𝑋2ΔX_{2}^{\\Delta} is −11-1.\n\nof form ∑i,j:i+j≤Δai​j​xi​yj≤0subscript:𝑖𝑗𝑖𝑗Δsubscript𝑎𝑖𝑗superscript𝑥𝑖superscript𝑦𝑗0\\sum_{i,j:i+j\\leq\\Delta}a_{ij}x^{i}y^{j}\\leq 0 with aΔ​0=−1subscript𝑎Δ01a_{\\Delta 0}=-1.\nIn this case, β𝛽\\beta can be as large as 𝒎2,Δ=(Δ+22)−1=Θ​(Δ2)subscript𝒎2ΔbinomialΔ221ΘsuperscriptΔ2\\boldsymbol{m}_{2,\\Delta}=\\binom{\\Delta+2}{2}-1=\\Theta(\\Delta^{2}),\nand much larger than Δ+1Δ1\\Delta+1 even for moderate ΔΔ\\Delta (e.g., for Δ=4Δ4\\Delta=4, “5” versus “14”, for\nΔ=5Δ5\\Delta=5, “6” versus “20” and so on).\nAnother main weakness is that their lower bound is only in 2D,\nbut the upper bound  works in arbitrary dimensions. The correct upper bound tradeoff seems to be even more mysterious.\nTypically, the tradeoff is obtained by combining the linear space and the polylogarithmic query time solutions.\nFor simplex range searching (i.e., when Δ=1Δ1\\Delta=1), the tradeoff is\nS​(n)=O~​(nD/Q​(n)D)𝑆𝑛~𝑂superscript𝑛𝐷𝑄superscript𝑛𝐷S(n)=\\tilde{O}(n^{D}/Q(n)^{D}) , which is a natural looking bound and it is also known to be optimal.\nThe tradeoff bound becomes very mysterious for semialgebraic range searching.\nFor example, for D=2𝐷2D=2 and when restricted to queries of the form y−∑i=0Δxi≤0𝑦superscriptsubscript𝑖0Δsuperscript𝑥𝑖0y-\\sum_{i=0}^{\\Delta}x^{i}\\leq 0,\ncombining the existing solutions yields the bound S​(n)=O~​(nΔ+1/Q​(n)2​Δ)𝑆𝑛~𝑂superscript𝑛Δ1𝑄superscript𝑛2ΔS(n)=\\tilde{O}(n^{\\Delta+1}/Q(n)^{2\\Delta})\nwhereas the known lower bound [ref]3 is S​(n)=Ω𝑜​(nΔ+1/Q​(n)(Δ+3)​Δ/2)𝑆𝑛𝑜Ωsuperscript𝑛Δ1𝑄superscript𝑛Δ3Δ2S(n)=\\overset{\\scriptscriptstyle o}{\\Omega}(n^{\\Delta+1}/Q(n)^{(\\Delta+3)\\Delta/2}).\nOne possible reason for this gap\nis that the lower bound construction is based on a uniform random point set,\nwhile in practice, the input can be pathological.\nBut in general the uniform random point set assumption is not too restrictive for range searching problems.\nAlmost all known lower bounds rely on this assumption:\ne.g., half-space range searching   ,\northogonal range searching   [ref]2,\nsimplex range searching   .\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Matoušek and Sharir ,\nit could also be reasonably conjectured that O~​(nD)~𝑂superscript𝑛𝐷\\tilde{O}(n^{D}) could also be the right bound.\nHowever, this was refuted recently by\nAfshani and Cheng [ref]3 who\nshowed that in 2D, and for polynomials for the form y−∑i=0Δxi≤0𝑦superscriptsubscript𝑖0Δsuperscript𝑥𝑖0y-\\sum_{i=0}^{\\Delta}x^{i}\\leq 0, there exists\nan\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
