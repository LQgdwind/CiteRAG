      "content": "Paper Title: IQ-Learn: Inverse soft-Q Learning for Imitation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClassical IL:\nImitation learning has a long history, with early works using supervised learning to match a policy‚Äôs actions to those of the expert  .\nA significant advance was made with the formulation of IL as the composition of RL and IRL¬† [ref]1 ,\nrecovering the expert‚Äôs policy by inferring the expert‚Äôs reward function, then finding the policy which maximizes reward under this reward function.\nThese early approaches required a hand-designed featurization of the MDP, limiting their applicability to complex MDPs.\nIn this setting, early approaches ¬†  noted a formal equivalence between IRL and IL using an inverse Bellman operator similar to our own. Online IL: More recent work aims to leverage the power of modern machine learning approaches to learn good featurizations and extend IL to complex settings. Recent work generally falls into one of two settings: online or offline.\nIn the online setting, the IL algorithm is able to interact with the environment to obtain dynamics information. GAIL¬† takes the nested RL/IRL formulation of earlier work\n, optimizing over all reward functions with a convex regularizer. This results in the objective in Eq.¬†(3), with a max-min adversarial problem similar to a GAN¬†. A variety of further work has built on this adversarial approach¬†1  . A separate line of work aims to simplify the problem in Eq.¬†(3) by using a fixed rùëür or œÄùúã\\pi. In SQIL¬†3, rùëür is chosen to be the 1-0 indicator on the expert demonstrations, while ASAF¬† takes the GAN approach and uses a discriminator (with role similar to rùëür) of fixed form, consisting of a ratio of expert and learner densities. AdRIL¬†8 is a recent extension of SQIL, additionally assigning decaying negative reward to previous policy rollouts. Offline IL: In the offline setting, the learner has no access to the environment.\nThe simple behavioural cloning (BC)¬†4 approach is offline, but doesn‚Äôt use any dynamics information. ValueDICE¬†2 is a dynamics-aware offline approach with an objective somewhat similar to ours, motivated from minimization of a variational representation of the KL-divergence between expert and learner policies. ValueDICE requires adversarial optimization to learn the policy and Q-functions, with a biased gradient estimator for training. We show a way to recover a unbiased gradient estimate for the KL-divergence in Appendix\n¬†C.\nThe O-NAIL algorithm¬† builds on ValueDICE and combines with a SAC update to obtain a method that is similar to our algorithm described in section 4.4, with the specific choice of reverse KL-divergence as the relevant statistical distance.\nThe EDM method¬† incorporates dynamics via learning an explicit energy based model for the expert state occupancy, although some theoretical details have been called into question (see¬†7 for details). The recent AVRIL approach¬† uses a variational method to solve a probabilistic formulation of IL, finding a posterior distribution over rùëür and œÄùúã\\pi. Illustrating the potential benefits of alternative distances for IL, the PWIL¬† algorithm gives a non-adversarial procedure to minimize the Wasserstein distance between expert and learned occupancies. The approach is specific to the primal form of the ùí≤1subscriptùí≤1{\\cal W}_{1}-distance, while our method (when used with the Wasserstein distance) targets the dual form.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: history, with early works using supervised learning to match a policy‚Äôs actions to those of the expert  .\nA significant advance was made with the formulation of IL as the composition of RL and IRL¬† [ref]1 ,\nrecovering the expert‚Äôs policy by inferring the expert‚Äôs reward function, then finding the policy which maximizes reward under this reward function.\nThese early approaches required a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
