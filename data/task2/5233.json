      "content": "Paper Title: Implicit Convolutional Kernels for Steerable CNNs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEquivariant deep learning is a powerful tool for high-dimensional problems with known data domain symmetry. By incorporating this knowledge as inductive biases into neural networks, the hypothesis class of functions can be significantly restricted, leading to improved data efficiency and generalization performance . Convolutional neural networks  (CNNs) are a prominent example as they are equivariant to translations. Group-equivariant CNNs [ref]9 (G-CNNs) generalize CNNs to exploit a larger number of symmetries via group convolutions, making them equivariant to the desired symmetry group, such as the Euclidean group E‚Äã(n)ùê∏ùëõE(n) that encompasses translations, rotations, and reflections in nùëõn-dimensional Euclidean space. In physics and chemistry, many important problems, such as molecular modelling or point clouds, rely on the Euclidean group. Objects defined in physical space have properties that are invariant or equivariant to Euclidean transformations, and respecting this underlying symmetry is often desired for the model to perform as expected. Neural networks can be parameterized in various ways to incorporate equivariance to the Euclidean group. One option is to use a message-passing neural network as a backbone and compute/update messages equivariantly via convolutions. This approach generalizes well to point clouds and graphs and offers the high expressivity of graph neural networks. Equivariant convolutional operators can be further categorized as regular [ref]9 [ref]26 [ref]3  or steerable group convolutions   . The latter recently proved to be especially suitable for incorporating physical and geometric quantities into a model . The key idea behind Steerable CNNs is using standard convolution - which guarantees translation equivariance - with Gùê∫G-steerable kernels that ensure commutativity with the transformations of another group Gùê∫G, such as rotations.\nThe commutation requirement imposes a constraint onto the kernel space that must be solved analytically for each group Gùê∫G. This, in turn, does not allow generalizing a convolution operator tailored to a specific group to other symmetry transformations. In the case of the Euclidean group, Cesa et¬†al. proposed a generally applicable way of parameterizing steerable convolutions for sub-groups of E‚Äã(n)ùê∏ùëõE(n). The method relies on adapting a pre-defined kernel basis explicitly developed for the group E‚Äã(n)ùê∏ùëõE(n) to an arbitrary sub-group by using group restriction. However, because only a finite basis can be chosen, a basis tailored for E‚Äã(n)ùê∏ùëõE(n) can be sub-optimal in terms of expressiveness for its sub-groups; see Section¬†3.6\nmore details. Hence, we propose an alternative way of building steerable convolutions based on implicit neural kernels, i.e. convolutional kernels implemented as continuous functions parameterized by MLPs  . We demonstrate how Gùê∫G-steerable convolutions with implicit neural kernels can be implemented from scratch for any sub-group Gùê∫G of the orthogonal group O‚Äã(n)ùëÇùëõO(n).\nThe method allows us to ultimately minimize requirements to implement equivariance to new groups; see Section¬†3.3.\nThe flexibility of neural functions also permits the injection of geometric and physical quantities in point convolutions, increasing their expressiveness ; see Section¬†3.2. We validate our framework on synthetic N-body simulation problem, point-cloud data (ModelNet-40 6) and molecular data (QM9 5) and demonstrate key benefits of our approach such as flexibility and generalizability. Besides, we demonstrate that implicit kernels allow Steerable CNNs to achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art models and surpass them with the correct choice of the task-specific symmetry group.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: leading to improved data efficiency and generalization performance .
