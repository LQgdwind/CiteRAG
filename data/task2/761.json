      "content": "Paper Title: Data-Independent Structured Pruning of Neural Networks via Coresets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSparsification, also known as weight pruning, was considered as far back as 1990¬†[ref]32, but has recently seen more study¬†   . One of the most popular approaches is pruning via sparsity. Sparsity can be enforced by L1subscriptùêø1L_{1} regularization to push weights towards zero during training¬†[ref]24. However, it was observed¬† that after fine-tuning of the pruned network, L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} regularized network outperformed L1subscriptùêø1L_{1}, as there is no benefit to pushing values towards zero compared to pruning unimportant (small weight) connections. The approach in¬† exploits the linearity of the neural network by finding a low-rank approximation of the weights and keeping the accuracy within 1% of the uncompressed model. Quantization of the neural network‚Äôs weights are done recently for saving memory. One example of such an approach, proposed in , performs quantization of the neural network‚Äôs weights and suggests a new training procedure to preserve the model accuracy after the quantization. Sparification methods showed high reduction in non-zero weights, e.g., the compression rate of AlexNet can reach 35x with the combination of pruning, quantization, and Huffman coding . The main drawback in weight pruning is that it leads to an irregular network structure, which needs a special treatment to deal with sparse representations, making it hard to achieve actual computational savings. Structured Pruning (e.g.,¬†[ref]24   [ref]36  ) simply reduces the size of the tensors. In the case of CNNs it reduces the number of filters in a layer. These methods are preferable over sparsification, as the resulting models are very easy to use and they save an actual inference time. The method in¬† measures the importance of channels by calculating the sum of absolute values of weights. Other channel pruning methods either impose channel-wise sparsity in training, followed by pruning channels with small scaling factors, and fine-tuning (e.g,¬†[ref]36)\nor perform channel pruning by minimizing the reconstruction error of feature maps between the pruned and pre-trained model (e.g.,¬†.) The method in  computes the impact of filter removal using Taylor expansion. Our method belongs to structured pruning, and thus the resulting pruned networks provide large savings in computations and are easy to implement.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: Sparsification, also known as weight pruning, was considered as far back as 1990¬†[ref]32, but has recently seen more study¬†   .
