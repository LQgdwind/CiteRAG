      "content": "Paper Title: TurboKV: Scaling Up the Performance of Distributed Key-value Stores with In-Switch Coordination\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDistributed Key-value Stores. Key-value storage is widely used to support lots of large-scale applications. Some key-value stores, e.g., Redis , RAMCloud , and memcached , manage data in DRAM for faster data access. Other key-value stores, e.g., Dynamo , Cassendra , LevelDB  and RocksDB  are presistent key-value stores which save data on presistent storage devices, while other key-value stores, e.g., AeroSpike  use hybrid storage(DRAM and SSD).\nDistributing data over several key-value store instances has been widely studied. Some systems use hash functions to distribute the data among storage nodes. Dynamo  and Cassandra  use consistent hashing, while Redis  and Aerospike  use a hash function to distribute data into several hashing slots. Other key-value stores, e.g., LevelDB  and RocksDB , use alternate approach to distribute the data, they use the key range partitioning where keys are on Sorted String Tables. TurboKV supports hash partitioning of the data and range partitioning. Applications can decide the way to partition the data and the corresponding directory information will be stored in switches’ data plane. To achieve durability and high availability, data partitions are replicated over several storage nodes. Dynamo, Cassendra, Aerospike, and Redis replicate the data partitions over several storage nodes and save this information on a mapping table which is replicated also on all storage nodes. TurboKV also replicates the data partitions over several storage nodes and follows the chain replication model to guarantee strong consistency. It stores the chain of each partition on the switch data plane. All existing key-value stores use either client-based coordination   , server-based coordination    or a single elected node coordination  to deliver requests from clients to storage nodes. TurboKV uses in-switch coordination with the key-based routing protocol to route requests from clients to storage nodes directly. Hardware Acceleration. Lots of work used hardware to speed up the performance of the distributed systems. NetPaxos   implements Paxos on switches. NetCache  implements a rack-scale on-switch cache, while DistCache  scales up the NetCache design to multiple racks inside the data center network. NetChain  uses the network switches to implement in-network key-value store, but it is bounded by the limited storage in the network switches. There is also SwitchKV  which is a cluster scale system to balance the key value stores via caching. SwitchKV uses the OpenFlow switches to save a forwarding rule for each cached key-value pair to route the request to the right caching node. TurboKV uses the switches to act as the request coordination nodes that save the partition management information along with the key-based-routing protocol to route the request to the target storage nodes. In TurboKV, the actual key-value pairs are saved on storage servers which makes it not limited to applications of small data sizes.\nOther examples that use the hardware to increase the perfromance include, but not limited to, JoiNS  which uses the OpenFlow switches to prioritize I/O packets to meet their latency SLO, KVDirect , a high performance KVS that leverages programmable NIC to extend RDMA primitives and enable remote direct key-value access to the main host memory, iSwitch [ref]24 which uses the network switches to improve the performance of the distributed reinforcement learning, and Ibex  which supports advanced SQL offloading using FPGA.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: to meet their latency SLO, KVDirect , a high performance KVS that leverages programmable NIC to extend RDMA primitives and enable remote direct key-value access to the main host memory, iSwitch [ref]24 which uses the network switches to improve the performance of the distributed reinforcement learning, and Ibex  which supports advanced SQL offloading using FPGA.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
