      "content": "Paper Title: LawSum: A weakly supervised approach for Indian Legal Document Summarization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA lot of progress has been made in legal text processing in past few years. This includes rhetorical role labelling, argument mining, legal text summarization, contract analysis, fact search/identification, etc. These works also generate several benchmark datasets, a few of which are publicly available. However, majority of the publicly available datasets are of small size. For example, the text summarization system for canadian case documents0 uses 10 document-summary pairs for evaluation. Likewise  uses 50 annotated judgements for evaluating graphical models of text summarization. While these datasets are not limited to English and several others like TEMIS in Italian1 and Lexia in German2 are available, most works are focused on legal documents from developed countries such as the UK, USA, AustraliaÂ and Canada03. Few such corpora related to the Indian legal domain exist. In contrast to the existing datasets where the case documents are quite structured, the Indian case documents are a lot more noisy and not well structured. Indian case law reports do not usually contain any section headings and do not follow a certain structure, as compared to judgement from other countries like Austrilia, Canada, USA, making the summarization task more challenging.. Despite this, there are several works that look at different aspects of legal text analysis in India like rhetorical role labelling, semantic search4,5 or legal document summarization  6. But the datasets used in these works again are either not public or relatively much smaller in size. The shared task on Artificial Intelligence for Legal Assistance7 8 provides a publicly available dataset for searching precedence and statutes. It consists of about 3000 precedent cases, about 200 statutes and 50 queries (hypothetical scenarios). The task is to find the precedents and statutes relevant to the scenario. Another recent dataset related to rhetorical role labelling is provided by . They provide 50 judgements tagged with 7 different rhetorical roles. A text summarization dataset used in  is somewhat similar to what is proposed in the current work. The dataset consists of around 20,000 judgement and summary pairs from the supreme court of India, but it is not publicly available. Moreover, as mentioned in the paper, that dataset is not structured or annotated. In contrast, the proposed collection is both, much larger than most previous collections and is annotated with a lot of meta-information. Text summarization is a technique which refers to selecting the most important portions of original text and generating coherent summary out of it. The motivation for text summarization in legal domain is to help in navigating the enormous amount of legal documents produced across the world by the numerous legal institutions. In India itself, there are 25 High Courts and 672 District Courts which publish the legal reports publicly. Such a system will also help in speeding up several cases that are pending in Indian courts [as of 2019, 87.5 percent, District and Subordinate courts] 333https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/budget2019-20/economicsurvey/doc/echapter.pdf. Since legal notes are long documents, legal institutions engage legal experts to produce headnotes which is known as summary. But such a task is labour-intensive, time-intensive as well as quite expensive. Therefore, Automatic summarization of legal documents can significantly help legal practitioners. Many summarization algorithms have been proposed till date, both for general text documents and a few specifically targeted to summarizing legal documents of various countries. For summarising Canadian case judgments, a method was proposed Letsum0 which determines the thematic structure of a judgment into four themes namely, introduction, context, juridical analysis, and conclusion. Relevant sentences are identified for each of the themes, and according to predefined percentages for each theme, the sentences are concatenated to form the summary. A similar approach was used in 6 for summarizing Indian court judgements. In the case of Australian case judgments, the CaseSummarizer tool9 was proposed which takes into account word frequencies and domain-specific information in the form of abbreviations, legal entities, etc. The legal entities like involved parties are recognized from section headings and also by identifying part of speech tags. Using these features, scores are determined for sentences, and depending on the threshold set by the user, summaries are generated. Another approach for summarization of Australian Case Judgements, HAUSS 0 which combines various methods into one approach. Along with that many structural attributes are acquired at term and sentence levels. Based on which rules are created for the extraction of relevant sentences. For UK case judgments 1 uses structural information along with manually annotated rhetorical roles for extractive summarization. Salomon 2 is a legal summarization tool which was developed for Belgian criminal cases. It also takes into account structure of the judgement. Whole document is divided into segments, each having specific information and property. For example, alleged offences and opinions of court, both having irrelevant info, while verdict of court is to the point. The segments having irrelevant information are summarized by using clustering algorithms. All the legal tools mentioned are designed considering the format of the judgements published in respective countries. Therefore, these methods will not show good results for legal documents of another country as shown in . One of the first works in text summarization for Indian judgments was by  where conditional random field (CRF) based automatic text summarization is proposed. The authors have segmented the document into seven rhetorical roles. Then, various features are used for identification of labels. They presented their results on 200 Kerela High Court Judgements of which 50 were hand-annotated. In 3 each sentence of the judgement is ranked based on by optimizing fitness function which has sentence length, sentence position, degree of similarity, TFâISF, legal keywords, etc. as their parameters. The proposed approach outperforms classical unsupervised algorithms. The dataset consisted of 1000 supreme court judgements. In , a systematic comparative study is performed on 17000+ Indian supreme court judgements, using algorithms such as LexRank4, LSA5, DSDR6, LetSum0, Casesummarizer9, Graphical Model, Neural Extractive Summarizer etc. All the approaches discussed above are extractive in nature, where most important sentences are identified and concatenated to form a summary. For, single-document extractive summarization, sentence representations of the documents are created and ranks sentences using machine learning algorithms. For example, SVM and Naive Bayes7 and Hidden Markov Model8. As the amount of labeled dataset increased, deep learning models started being used. In 9, CNN and LSTM are were used for creating sentence representations. In , both CNN and LSTM are used for ranking the sentences. In , LSTM and GRU were used in a hierarchical manner for generating sentence representations. With onset state-of-the-art pre-trained language models several systems that used transformer like BERT[ref]32, Roberta etc, were proposed for summarization  . Recently, Google has also released  for summarization of Long Documents. In case Unsupervised Extractive Summarisation, TextRank and LexRank were the prominent works. But, lately due increase in amount of text data published daily, and less labelled data many new approaches are coming up. The work by  proposes a novel approach for unsupervised sentence summarization by mapping the Information Bottleneck principle to a conditional language modelling objective. In , two language models are used, and shows that by using a product-of-experts criteria is enough for maintaining continuous contextual matching while maintaining output fluency. In , graph-based ranking algorithm is modified by computing node centrality in two ways, employing BERT[ref]32 and graphs with directed edges arguing that the contribution of any two nodes to their respective centrality is influenced by their relative position in a document.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: In , LSTM and GRU were used in a hierarchical manner for generating sentence representations.
