Model-based Action-Gradient-Estimator Policy Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPolicy gradient methods improve the policy π𝜽subscript𝜋𝜽\\pi_{\\bm{\\theta}} by ascending the direction of the gradient of its performance function J​(𝜽)𝐽𝜽J({\\bm{\\theta}}).\nThe Deterministic Policy Gradient Theorem [ref]47 provides a practical way to calculate this gradient. It shows that, under some mild regularity conditions on the MDP, the gradient of the performance of a deterministic policy π𝜽subscript𝜋𝜽\\pi_{{\\bm{\\theta}}} is given by: This result can be interpreted through the lens of the chain rule applied to the action-value gradient ∇𝜽Qπsubscript∇𝜽superscript𝑄𝜋\\nabla_{{\\bm{\\theta}}}Q^{\\pi}: the policy gradient does not directly depend on the gradient of dμπsuperscriptsubscript𝑑𝜇𝜋d_{\\mu}^{\\pi}, and can be obtained by just chaining the actor’s Jacobian ∇𝜽π𝜽subscript∇𝜽subscript𝜋𝜽\\nabla_{{\\bm{\\theta}}}\\pi_{{\\bm{\\theta}}} with the action-gradient of the value function ∇aQπsubscript∇𝑎superscript𝑄𝜋\\nabla_{a}Q^{\\pi}. The theorem motivates a family of policy gradient actor-critic algorithms, such as DDPG [ref]28 and TD3 [ref]18.\nSimilarly to the classical policy iteration , the evaluation of a policy π∈Π𝜋Π\\pi\\in\\Pi (called actor in this context) is interleaved with its improvement w.r.t the approximate action-value function Q^∈𝒬^𝑄𝒬\\widehat{Q}\\in\\mathcal{Q} (called critic).\nSpecifically, the typical desideratum consists in finding a critic Q^^𝑄\\widehat{Q} which minimizes the policy evaluation error: where δπ,Q~​(s,a)=Qπ​(s,a)−Q~​(s,a)superscript𝛿𝜋~𝑄𝑠𝑎superscript𝑄𝜋𝑠𝑎~𝑄𝑠𝑎\\delta^{\\pi,\\widetilde{Q}}(s,a)=Q^{\\pi}(s,a)-\\widetilde{Q}(s,a) is a deviation w.r.t the true state-action value.\nGiven the lack of knowledge about the transition model, Qπsuperscript𝑄𝜋Q^{\\pi} needs to be approximated.\nA common approximation technique consists in employing the temporal difference (TD) error , defined as δ^π,Q~​(s,a,s′)=r​(s,a)+γ​Q~​(s′,π​(s′))−Q~​(s,a)superscript^𝛿𝜋~𝑄𝑠𝑎superscript𝑠′𝑟𝑠𝑎𝛾~𝑄superscript𝑠′𝜋superscript𝑠′~𝑄𝑠𝑎{\\widehat{\\delta}^{\\pi,\\widetilde{Q}}(s,a,s^{\\prime})=r(s,a)+\\gamma\\widetilde{Q}(s^{\\prime},\\pi(s^{\\prime}))-\\widetilde{Q}(s,a)}, giving rise to a bootstrapped optimization criterion for Q^^𝑄\\widehat{Q}: Minimizing the TD-error, albeit under rather strong assumptions, enjoys convergence guarantees  .\nOnce a critic is learned, the actor π𝜽subscript𝜋𝜽\\pi_{{\\bm{\\theta}}} can be improved by maximizing the action-value function for actions produced by the policy: The above can be seen as a generalization of the policy improvement step in classical policy iteration, which relies on maximization over a discrete action space that cannot be easily carried out in continuous spaces.\nIn practice, to reduce the computational burden, the problems in Equation 3 and Equation 4 are solved only partially (e.g., by using a single optimization step) at each iteration, similarly to generalized policy iteration .\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: methods improve the policy π𝜽subscript𝜋𝜽\\pi_{\\bm{\\theta}} by ascending the direction of the gradient of its performance function J​(𝜽)𝐽𝜽J({\\bm{\\theta}}).\nThe Deterministic Policy Gradient Theorem [ref]47 provides a practical way to calculate this gradient.
