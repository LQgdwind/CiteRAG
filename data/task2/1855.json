      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Attributed Network Representation Learning via Attribute Enhanced Neighborhood\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNetworks are generally utilized to explore and model complex systems, such as online social networks and citation networks, where an entity is represented as a node and the interaction between two entities is represented as an edge. Network analysis is an effective way to gain insight into different aspects of complex systems, which derives many machine learning applications, such as the online advertisement targeting  and anomaly detection [ref]2. Hence, identifying effective features of nodes (or edges) in a network is essential. However, traditional methods tend to manually mine the specific domain features depending on the expert experience, which not only require the high cost of labor and time, but also limit the scalability of models on different prediction tasks [ref]3. Network representation learning (NRL)  as an alternative of automatic feature mining has been proved to be beneficial to various network analysis tasks, such as the node classification , link prediction , clustering [ref]8 and visualization. Early NRL methods are mostly based on the matrix factorization0. To reduce the computational complexity on large-scale networks, inspired by word modeling, Perozzi et al. propose DeepWalk.\nNotably, the above-mentioned shallow model design cannot well capture the highly non-linearity that is universal in the networks, which would lead to the sub-optimal network representation 1. Then, many deep models, such as structural deep network embedding (SDNE)1, have emerged. Considering only the network structure is not enough to learn the informative and accurate node representations, especially when the network structure is sparse. Social science theories like the homophily 2 3 and social influence theory 4 suggest that there is a strong correlation between the structure and the attributes. Therefore, many studies focus on attributed NRL5 6 7, which mainly learn the consistent node representations from the network structure and node attributes. Nevertheless, the above models are likely susceptible to the sparsity of one of the\nheterogeneous information sources. Afterwards, the deep coupling paradigm is introduced to enhance the robustness of the representations. Attributed network representation learning (ANRL)8 is one of the representative examples. However, the ANRL model could be affected by the characteristics of the local network structure. In addition, the previous attributed NRL methods rarely preserve all the microscopic structural information, i.e., the first-order, second-order, and high-order proximity9, together, where these proximities indicate the one-step, two-step, and multi-step relationship between two nodes. Nevertheless, explicitly taking full advantage of the microscopic structure tends to be essential for learning the network representation . To utilize the microscopic structural information as well as the node attributes, we propose a novel deep coupling attributed NRL model, namely, the deep attributed network representation learning via attribute enhanced neighborhood (DANRL-ANE) model. The proposed model consists of three coupled modules, i.e., the self-built first-order proximity preserved, attribute enhanced neighborhood autoencoder and community-aware skip-gram module, which preserve the first-order, second-order, and high-order proximity, respectively. The three modules share connections to the encoder. Especially, we model the attributes based on the social homophily, and incorporate the attribute semantics into the adjacency matrix to enhance the direct neighborhood of each node. To summarize, our main contributions are as follows: (i) We propose a deep three-part coupling model, DANRL-ANE, which learns the robust and effective node representations by jointly mining the microscopic structure and node attributes. The attributes are preprocessed to be used as the input of our model together with the adjacency matrix, which is advantageous to obtain the accurate second-order proximity. (ii) We construct the self-built first-order proximity preserved module, which innovatively extends the sigmoid cross-entropy loss function for capturing the local pairwise relationship between node pairs on undirected and unweighted networks. (iii) Our proposed model is not only good for the machine learning tasks that benefit from the pairwise properties between nodes, i.e., the link prediction and node classification, but also not susceptible to the sparsity and neighborhood distribution of either the structure or the attributes. Moreover, our model even can deal with the networks with isolated nodes when we obtain the sufficient node attributes. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We discuss the related work in Section II, and introduce the preliminaries involved in the paper in Section III. We give the detailed description of our model in Section IV, and then show the experimental settings and results in Section V. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: is an effective way to gain insight into different aspects of complex systems, which derives many machine learning applications, such as the online advertisement targeting  and anomaly detection [ref]2.
