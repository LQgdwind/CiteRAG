      "content": "Paper Title: Computable Artificial General Intelligence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhat AGI entails is debatable, but there does exist a mathematically precise definition – an agent proven to maximise intelligence To clarify, maximising intelligence means first that intelligent behaviour is formally defined in measurable terms, and second that an agent behaves optimally according to that measure.. Allowing for disagreement over what constitutes intelligence, AIXI is perhaps the only mathematical formalism proven to satisfy this criterion. It maximises “the ability to satisfy goals in a wide range of environments”  . It is pareto optimal, meaning there is no agent which outperforms AIXI in one environment which can equal its performance in all others.\nAIXI is better able to learn and adapt, because the universal prior   it employs allows it to make accurate inferences from minimal data.\nUnfortunately that universal prior is incomputable, ensuring AIXI can only ever be approximated. Nevertheless AIXI is a useful theoretical tool for understanding how an AGI may behave, for example in AI safety research [ref]6. Yet even claims regarding AIXI’s behaviour were later shown to be subjective, because behaviour depends upon the Universal Turing Machine (UTM) on which AIXI runs .\nTo address these problems, we propose an alternative.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: prior is incomputable, ensuring AIXI can only ever be approximated.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
