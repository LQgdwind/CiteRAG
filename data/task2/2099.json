      "content": "Paper Title: On Classifying Continuous Constraint Satisfaction Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe class of the existential theory of the reals ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R} (pronounced as ‘ER’) is a complexity class that has gained a lot of interest, especially within the computational geometry community.\nTo define this class, we first consider the problem ETR, which also stands for Existential Theory of the Reals.\nIn an instance of this problem, we are given a sentence of the form where ΦΦ\\Phi is a well-formed quantifier-free formula consisting of the symbols {0,1,x1,…,xn,+,⋅,≥,>,∧,∨,¬}01subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛⋅\\{0,1,x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n},+,\\cdot,\\geq,>,\\wedge,\\vee,\\neg\\}, the goal is to check whether this sentence is true.\nWe will refer to the formula ΦΦ\\Phi which might appear in an ETR-instance as an ETR-formula.\nAs an example of an ETR-instance, we could take Φ=(x⋅y2+x≥0)∧¬(y<2​x)Φ⋅𝑥superscript𝑦2𝑥0𝑦2𝑥\\Phi=(x\\cdot y^{2}+x\\geq 0)\\wedge\\neg(y<2x).\nThe goal of this instance would be to determine whether there exist real numbers x𝑥x and y𝑦y satisfying this formula.\nNow the class ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R} is the family of all problems that admit a polynomial-time many-one reduction to ETR.\nWith the notation above, it can be shown that the CSP of the structure 𝐑=⟨ℝ,⋅,+,𝟏⟩𝐑ℝ⋅1\\mathbf{R}=\\langle\\mathbb{R},\\cdot,+,\\mathbf{1}\\rangle is ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R}-complete , see also Lemma 22. It is known that The first inclusion follows from the definition of ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R} as follows.\nGiven any Boolean satisfiability formula, we can replace each positive occurrence of a variable x𝑥x by x=1𝑥1x=1. For example (x∨¬y)∧(¬x∨z)𝑥𝑦𝑥𝑧(x\\lor\\lnot y)\\land(\\lnot x\\lor z) becomes\n(x=1∨¬(y=1))∧(¬(x=1)∨z=1)𝑥1𝑦1𝑥1𝑧1(x=1\\lor\\lnot(y=1))\\land(\\lnot(x=1)\\lor z=1). Showing the second inclusion was first done by Canny in his seminal paper [ref]21.\nThe reason that ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R} is an important complexity class is that a number of common problems in computational geometry, game theory, machine learning, and other areas have been shown to be complete for this class. We\nuse |Φ|Φ|\\Phi| to denote the length of ΦΦ\\Phi, that is, the number of bits necessary to write down\nΦΦ\\Phi. We want to point out that there are some subtleties in the definition of the formula length.\nNaively, to encode a natural number n𝑛n requires Θ​(n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(n) bits, i.e., n=1+1+…+1𝑛11…1n=1+1+\\ldots+1.\nHowever, it is possible to encode it in O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) bits, using Horner’s rule applied to the binary expansion of n𝑛n.\nFor example, 27=1+2​(1+2​(0+2​(1+2)))=1+(1+1)​(1+(1+1)​(0+(1+1)​(1+(1+1))))271212021211111101111127=1+2(1+2(0+2(1+2)))=1+(1+1)(1+(1+1)(0+(1+1)(1+(1+1)))).\nFurthermore, we want to emphasize that the reductions used for defining ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R} are performed in the word RAM model (or equivalently on a Turing machine), and not on a real Random Access Machine (real RAM) or in the Blum-Shub-Smale model. The definition of a formula naturally leads to the definition of semi-algebraic sets.\nWe say a set S⊆ℝn𝑆superscriptℝ𝑛S\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^{n} is semi-algebraic, if there exists a formula φ𝜑\\varphi such that\nS={x∈ℝn|φ​(x)}𝑆conditional-set𝑥superscriptℝ𝑛𝜑𝑥S=\\left\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\,\\middle|\\,\\varphi(x)\\right\\}.\nConsequently, the (bit)-complexity of a semi-algebraic set is the shortest length of any formula\ndefining the set.\nNote that our definition of a semi-algebraic set is more common in a computer science context .\nIn the context of algebraic geometry, semi-algebraic sets would usually allow polynomials with real coefficients.\nFor example, consider the set S={x∈ℝ|x−e=0}𝑆conditional-set𝑥ℝ𝑥𝑒0S=\\left\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,\\middle|\\,x-e=0\\right\\}, containing Euler number e𝑒e.\nNote that S𝑆S is typically semi-algebraic for an algebraic geometer , but typically not for a computer scientist .\nGiven a point x∈ℝn𝑥superscriptℝ𝑛x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n} and a semi-algebraic set S⊂ℝn𝑆superscriptℝ𝑛S\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n}, we can decide on the real RAM if x∈S𝑥𝑆x\\in S.\n(We refer the reader to the work by Erickson, Hoog, and Miltzow for a detailed definition of the real RAM and decidability .)\nThis is easy to see as we only need to evaluate the defining formula of S𝑆S.\nInterestingly the reverse direction also holds.\nIf we can decide x∈S𝑥𝑆x\\in S for any x∈ℝn𝑥superscriptℝ𝑛x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n} then S𝑆S needs to be semi-algebraic .\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: y)\\land(\\lnot x\\lor z) becomes\n(x=1∨¬(y=1))∧(¬(x=1)∨z=1)𝑥1𝑦1𝑥1𝑧1(x=1\\lor\\lnot(y=1))\\land(\\lnot(x=1)\\lor z=1).
