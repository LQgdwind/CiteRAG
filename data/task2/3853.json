      "content": "Paper Title: Chromatic 𝑘-Nearest Neighbor Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the most popular approaches for classification problems is to\nuse a k𝑘k-Nearest Neighbor (k​-NN𝑘-NNk\\text{-NN})\nclassifier    . In\na k​-NN𝑘-NNk\\text{-NN} classifier the predicted class of a query item q𝑞q is taken to\nbe the most frequently appearing class among the k𝑘k items most\nsimilar to q𝑞q. One can model this as a geometric problem in which the\ninput items are represented by a set P𝑃P of n𝑛n colored points in\nℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}: the color of the points represents their class, and the\ndistance between points measures their similarity. The goal is then to\nstore P𝑃P so that one can efficiently find the color (class) c∗superscript𝑐c^{*}\nmost frequently occurring among the k𝑘k points in P𝑃P closest to a\nquery point q𝑞q. See Figure 1(left). We refer to such\nqueries as chromatic k​-NN𝑘-NNk\\text{-NN} queries. To answer such queries, k​-NN𝑘-NNk\\text{-NN} classifiers often store P𝑃P in, e.g., a kd-tree and answer queries by\nexplicitly reporting the k𝑘k points closest to q𝑞q, scanning through\nthis set to compute the most frequently occurring\ncolor . Unfortunately, for many distance\nmeasures (including the Euclidean distance) such an approach has no\nguarantees on the query time other than the trivial O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) time\nbound. See Figure 2 for an\nillustration. Even assuming that the dependency on n𝑛n during the\nquery time is small (e.g. when the points are nicely\ndistributed ), the approach\nrequires Θ​(k)Θ𝑘\\Theta(k) time to explicitly process all k𝑘k points closest\nto q𝑞q, whereas the desired output is only a single value: the most\nfrequently appearing color. Hence, our main goal is to design a data\nstructure to store P𝑃P that has sublinear query time in terms of both\nn𝑛n and k𝑘k, while still using only small space. We focus our\nattention on the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} (Euclidean) distance, and the L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty} distance\nmetrics. Most of our ideas extend to more general distance measures and\nhigher dimensions as well. However, already in the restricted settings\npresented here, designing data structures that provide guarantees on\nthe space and query time turns out to be a challenging task. If the value k𝑘k is fixed in advance, one possible solution is to build the\nkthsuperscript𝑘thk^{\\mathrm{th}}-order Voronoi diagram 𝑉𝑜𝑟k​(P)subscript𝑉𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑃\\mathit{Vor}_{k}(P) of P𝑃P, and\npreprocess it for point location queries. The\nkthsuperscript𝑘thk^{\\mathrm{th}}-order Voronoi diagram is a partition of ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}\ninto maximal cells for which all points in a cell (a Voronoi\nregion) Vk,P​(S)subscript𝑉𝑘𝑃𝑆V_{k,P}(S) have the same set S𝑆S of k𝑘k closest points\nfrom P𝑃P. Hence, in each Voronoi region there is a fixed color that\noccurs most frequently among S𝑆S. See Figure 1(right) for an\nillustration. By storing 𝑉𝑜𝑟k​(P)subscript𝑉𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑃\\mathit{Vor}_{k}(P) in a data structure for efficient\n(i.e. O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) time) point location queries we can also answer\nchromatic k​-NN𝑘-NNk\\text{-NN} queries efficiently. However, unfortunately 𝑉𝑜𝑟k​(P)subscript𝑉𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑃\\mathit{Vor}_{k}(P)\nmay have size Θ​(k​(n−k))Θ𝑘𝑛𝑘\\Theta(k(n-k)) 2 (for points in\nℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} and the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}\ndistance). For other Lmsubscript𝐿𝑚L_{m} distances the diagram\nis similarly\nlarge  . Hence,\nwe are interested in solutions that use less, preferably near-linear, space. The only result on the theory of chromatic k​-NN𝑘-NNk\\text{-NN} queries that we are\naware of is that of Mount\net al. . They study the problem\nin the case that we measure distance using the Euclidean metric and\nthat the number of colors c𝑐c, as well as the parameter k𝑘k, are small\nconstants. Mount et al.state that it is unclear how to obtain a query\ntime independent of k𝑘k, and instead analyze the query times in terms\nof the chromatic density ρ𝜌\\rho of a query q𝑞q. The chromatic\ndensity is a term depending on the distance from the query point q𝑞q\nto the kthsuperscript𝑘thk^{\\mathrm{th}} nearest neighbor of q𝑞q, and the distance from\nq𝑞q to the first point at which the answer of the query would change\n(e.g. the (k+t)thsuperscript𝑘𝑡th(k+t)^{\\mathrm{th}} nearest neighbor of q𝑞q for some\nt>0𝑡0t>0). The intuition is that if many points near q𝑞q have the same\ncolor, queries should be easier to answer than when there are multiple\ncolors with roughly the same number of points. The chromatic\ndensity term models this. Their main result is a linear space data\nstructure for points in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} that supports\nO​(log2⁡n+(1/ρ)d​log⁡(1/ρ))𝑂superscript2𝑛superscript1𝜌𝑑1𝜌O(\\log^{2}n+(1/\\rho)^{d}\\log(1/\\rho)) time queries. We aim for\nbounds only in terms of combinatorial properties (i.e. n𝑛n, c𝑐c, and\nk𝑘k) and allow the number of colors, as well as the parameter k𝑘k, to\ndepend on n𝑛n. Our results are particularly relevant when k𝑘k and c𝑐c\nare large compared to n𝑛n. Our main idea is to answer a query in two\nsteps. (1) We identify a region 𝒟mk​(q)subscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑘𝑚𝑞\\mathcal{D}^{k}_{m}(q) that contains exactly the\nset k​-NNm​(q)𝑘subscript-NN𝑚𝑞k\\text{-NN}_{m}(q) of the k𝑘k sites closest to q𝑞q according to distance\nmetric Lmsubscript𝐿𝑚L_{m}. (2) We then find the mode color c∗superscript𝑐c^{*}; that is,\nthe most frequently occurring color among the points in the region\n𝒟mk​(q)subscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑘𝑚𝑞\\mathcal{D}^{k}_{m}(q). This way, we never have to explicitly enumerate the set\nk​-NNm​(q)𝑘subscript-NN𝑚𝑞k\\text{-NN}_{m}(q). We will design separate data structures for these two\nsteps. Our data structure for step (1) will find the smallest metric\ndisk 𝒟mk​(q)subscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑘𝑚𝑞\\mathcal{D}^{k}_{m}(q) containing k​-NNm​(q)𝑘subscript-NN𝑚𝑞k\\text{-NN}_{m}(q) centered at q𝑞q. We refer to\nsuch a query as an range finding query. If the distance used is\nclear from the context we may write k​-NN​(q)𝑘-NN𝑞k\\text{-NN}(q) and 𝒟k​(q)superscript𝒟𝑘𝑞\\mathcal{D}^{k}(q) instead. The data structure in step (2) answers\nso-called range mode queries. For these data structures we exploit and extend the result of Chan\net al. [ref]12. They show an array\nA𝐴A with n𝑛n entries can be stored in a linear space data structure\nthat allows reporting the mode of a query range (interval) A[i..j]A[i..j]\nin O​(n1/2)𝑂superscript𝑛12O(n^{1/2}) time. Furthermore, points in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} can be stored in\nO​(n​polylog⁡n+r2​d)𝑂𝑛polylog𝑛superscript𝑟2𝑑O(n\\operatorname{polylog}n+r^{2d}) space so that range mode queries with axis-aligned\northogonal ranges can be answered in O​((n/r)​polylog⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑟polylog𝑛O((n/r)\\operatorname{polylog}n)\ntime. Here, r∈[1,n]𝑟1𝑛r\\in[1,n] is a user-choosable parameter. In\nparticular, setting r=⌈n1/2​d⌉𝑟superscript𝑛12𝑑r=\\lceil n^{1/2d}\\rceil yields an\nO​(n​polylog⁡n)𝑂𝑛polylog𝑛O(n\\operatorname{polylog}n) space solution with O​(n1−1/2​d​polylog⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛112𝑑polylog𝑛O(n^{1-1/2d}\\operatorname{polylog}n) query\ntime. Range mode queries with halfspaces can be answered in\nO​((n/r)1−1/d2+polylog⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛𝑟11superscript𝑑2polylog𝑛O((n/r)^{1-1/d^{2}}+\\operatorname{polylog}n) time using O​(n​rd−1)𝑂𝑛superscript𝑟𝑑1O(nr^{d-1})\nspace [ref]12. Range mode queries\nin arrays have also been considered in an approximate\nsetting . The goal is then to report\nan element that appears sufficiently often in the range. Refer to Table 1 for an overview of our exact solutions.\nWe first consider the problem\nfor n𝑛n points in ℝ1superscriptℝ1\\mathbb{R}^{1}. In this setting, we develop an optimal linear space\ndata structure that can find 𝒟mk​(q)subscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑘𝑚𝑞\\mathcal{D}^{k}_{m}(q) in O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) time, for any\nm≥1𝑚1m\\geq 1 (Section 2.1). We then use Chan\net al. [ref]12’s data structure to\nreport the mode color in 𝒟mk​(q)subscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑘𝑚𝑞\\mathcal{D}^{k}_{m}(q). Since we present all of our data\nstructures in the pointer machine model augmented with real-valued\narithmetic, this yields an O​(n1/2​log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛12𝑛O(n^{1/2}\\log n) time query\nalgorithm.\nThere is a conditional Ω​(n1/2−δ)Ωsuperscript𝑛12𝛿\\Omega(n^{1/2-\\delta}) lowerbound for\nchromatic k​-NN𝑘-NNk\\text{-NN} queries using linear space and O​(n3/2)𝑂superscript𝑛32O(n^{3/2})\npreprocessing time (refer to Section 5) so this\nresult is likely near-optimal. In\nSection 3 we present our data structure\nfor finding 𝒟mk​(q)subscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑘𝑚𝑞\\mathcal{D}^{k}_{m}(q) in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2}. For the L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty} metric\nwe show that we can essentially find 𝒟mk​(q)subscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑘𝑚𝑞\\mathcal{D}^{k}_{m}(q) using a binary search\non the radius of the disk, and thus there is a simple O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n)\nsize data structure that allows us to find the range 𝒟k​(q)superscript𝒟𝑘𝑞\\mathcal{D}^{k}(q) in\nO​(log2⁡n)𝑂superscript2𝑛O(\\log^{2}n) time (or O​(nδ)𝑂superscript𝑛𝛿O(n^{\\delta}) time, for an arbitrarily small\nδ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, in case of a linear space structure). For the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}\nmetric, we can no longer easily access a discrete set of candidate\nradii. It is tempting to therefore replace the binary search by a\nparametric\nsearch  . However,\nthe basic such approach squares the O~​(n1/2)~𝑂superscript𝑛12\\tilde{O}(n^{1/2}) time required\nto solve the decision problem and is thus not applicable. The full\nstrategy requires a way to generate independent comparisons; typically\nby designing a parallel decision\nalgorithm . Neither task is\nstraightforward to achieve. Instead, we show that we can directly\nadapt the query algorithm for answering semi-algebraic range\nqueries  (essentially the decision\nalgorithm in the approach sketched above) to find 𝒟2k​(q)subscriptsuperscript𝒟𝑘2𝑞\\mathcal{D}^{k}_{2}(q) in\nO​(n1/2​polylog⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛12polylog𝑛O(n^{1/2}\\operatorname{polylog}n) time. Unfortunately, the final query time for\nchromatic k​-NN𝑘-NNk\\text{-NN} queries is dominated by the O​(n5/6​polylog⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛56polylog𝑛O(n^{5/6}\\operatorname{polylog}n) time\nrange mode queries, for which we use a slight variation of the data\nstructure of Chan et al. [ref]12. We\nbriefly discuss these results in Section 4, We\ndo show that the data structure can be constructed in O​(n5/3)𝑂superscript𝑛53O(n^{5/3})\nexpected time, rather than the straightforward O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}) time\nimplementation that directly follows from the description of Chan\net al.. For the L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty} metric we can answer range mode\nqueries in O​(n3/4​polylog⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛34polylog𝑛O(n^{3/4}\\operatorname{polylog}n) time using Chan et al.’s data\nstructure for orthogonal ranges. However, we show that we can exploit\nthat the ranges are squares and use a cutting-based approach (similar\nto the one used for the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} distance) to answer queries in\nO​(n2/3​log2/3⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛23superscript23𝑛O(n^{2/3}\\log^{2/3}n) time instead. If we wish to reduce the space\nfrom O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) to linear the query time becomes\nO​(n2/3+δ)𝑂superscript𝑛23𝛿O(n^{2/3+\\delta}). Since the query times are still rather large, we then turn our\nattention to approximations; refer to\nTable 2 for an overview. If f∗superscript𝑓f^{*} is the\nfrequency of the mode color among k​-NN​(q)𝑘-NN𝑞k\\text{-NN}(q) then our data structures\nmay return a color that appears at least (1−ε)​f∗1𝜀superscript𝑓(1-\\varepsilon)f^{*} times. In case\nof the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} distance our data structure presented in\nSection 6 now achieves roughly\nO~​(n1/2​ε−3/2)~𝑂superscript𝑛12superscript𝜀32\\tilde{O}(n^{1/2}\\varepsilon^{-3/2}) query time, where the O~~𝑂\\tilde{O} notation\nhides polylogarithmic factors of n𝑛n and ε𝜀\\varepsilon. The main idea is that\napproximate levels in the arrangement of distance functions have\nrelatively low complexity, and thus we can store them to efficiently\nanswer approximate range mode queries.\nWe show how to generalize our\nresults to higher dimensions and other distance metrics in\nSection 7.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: and 𝒟k​(q)superscript𝒟𝑘𝑞\\mathcal{D}^{k}(q) instead. The data structure in step (2) answers\nso-called range mode queries. For these data structures we exploit and extend the result of Chan\net al. [ref]12.
