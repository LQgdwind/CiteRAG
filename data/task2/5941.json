      "content": "Paper Title: Optimal Testing of Generalized Reed-Muller Codes in Fewer Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we focus on a much stronger notion of testing known as optimal testing. Clearly, if a tester makes Q𝑄Q queries and the proximity parameter is δ𝛿\\delta, then\nthe rejection probability can be at most min⁡(1,Q​δ)1𝑄𝛿\\min(1,Q\\delta); indeed, this is a bound on the probability to distinguish between a Reed-Muller codeword and\na Reed-Muller codeword that has been perturbed on a randomly chosen δ𝛿\\delta-fraction of inputs.\nA tester is called optimal if the query-to-rejection probability tradeoff it achieves\nis roughly that. Oftentimes, one settles for rejection probability which is a bit worse and has the form c​(q)​min⁡(1,Q​δ)𝑐𝑞1𝑄𝛿c(q)\\min(1,Q\\delta) for some function c​(q)>0𝑐𝑞0c(q)>0 depending only on the field size\nq𝑞q. We will refer to such results also as optimal testing results. Thus, one would ideally like a tester which both achieves as small as possible query complexity, while\nsimultaneously being optimal. Optimal testers are known for Reed-Muller codes. Such results were first proved over 𝔽2subscript𝔽2\\mathbb{F}_{2} by . Later on,\noptimal testing results were\nestablished for Reed-Muller codes\nover general fields  as\nwell as more broadly for the class of\naffine lifted codes . In all of these results, the t𝑡t-flat test is analyzed (for t𝑡t chosen as above), and is shown to be an optimal tester.\nWe remark that additionally,\nthe analyses\nof    led to improved query complexity for testing Reed-Muller codes. These results have important applications, most notably to the construction of small-set\nexpander graphs with many eigenvalues close to 111 [ref]8, which have later been used for improved PCP constructions and constructions of integrality\ngaps   [ref]11 . Quantitatively, these results have two drawbacks. First, due to their application of the density Hales-Jewett theorem, the dependency of c​(q)𝑐𝑞c(q) on the field size q𝑞q is tower type, hence making\nthe result primarily effective for small fields. Secondly, while the query complexity achieved by their tester is the best possible for prime fields (as a lower bound on the query complexity\nneeded is given by the distance of the dual code of RM⁡[n,q,d]RM𝑛𝑞𝑑\\operatorname{RM}[n,q,d], which is qtsuperscript𝑞𝑡q^{t} if q𝑞q is prime),\nit is not known to be optimal for prime power size\nfields. This raises two natural questions:\ndoes the flat tester actually perform worse on large fields (in comparison to small fields)? Is there a tester with smaller query complexity over non-prime fields\n(i.e. extension fields)? In  a new local tester for the Reed-Muller code was designed.\nThe query complexity of the tester is Q=𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(q)​(3​q)⌈d+1q⌉𝑄𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑞superscript3𝑞𝑑1𝑞Q={\\sf poly}(q)(3q)^{\\lceil\\frac{d+1}{q}\\rceil}, which is polynomially smaller than qtsuperscript𝑞𝑡q^{t} above (by a power of\npp−1𝑝𝑝1\\frac{p}{p-1}). This tester, which will be referred to as the sparse t𝑡t-flat tester, plays a crucial role in the current work and will be presented in subsequent sections. Unfortunately, the rejection probability proved in  for the sparse t𝑡t-flat tester is an ε𝜀\\varepsilon which is sub-constant, and after repeating the tester Θ​(1/ε)Θ1𝜀\\Theta(1/\\varepsilon) times its query complexity\nturns out to be roughly the same as that of the t𝑡t-flat tester above. This leaves the Reed Muller code over extension fields in a rather precarious situation: a local characterization for the code — namely a basic tester that rejects far from Reed-Muller codewords with some non-negligible probability — is known, but amplifying\nthe soundness to be constant sets us back to the same query complexity as of the t𝑡t-flat tester.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: improved query complexity for testing Reed-Muller codes.
