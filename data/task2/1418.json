      "content": "Paper Title: FLTrust: Byzantine-robust Federated Learning via Trust Bootstrapping\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider both data poisoning attacks and local model poisoning attacks. For data poisoning attack, we consider the popular label flipping attack. For local model poisoning attacks, we evaluate Krum attack, Trim attack, and our adaptive attack (untargeted attacks) [ref]15, as well as Scaling attack (targeted attack) . Label flipping (LF) attack:  We use the same label flipping attack setting as [ref]15. In particular, for each training example on the malicious clients, we flip its label l𝑙l to M−l−1𝑀𝑙1M-l-1, where M𝑀M is the total number of labels and l∈{0,1,⋯,M−1}𝑙01⋯𝑀1l\\in\\{0,1,\\cdots,M-1\\}. Krum attack:  Krum attack is an untargeted local model poisoning attack optimized for the Krum aggregation rule. We use the default parameter settings in [ref]15 for the Krum attack. Trim attack:  Trim attack is an untargeted local model poisoning attack optimized for the Trim-mean and Median aggregation rules. We use the default parameter settings in [ref]15 for the Trim attack. Scaling attack:  Scaling attack is a targeted local model poisoning attack. Specifically, we consider the attacker-chosen target testing examples are normal testing examples with a predefined feature-pattern trigger embedded. Following , we use the data augmentation scheme in [ref]18 to implement the Scaling attack. Specifically, each malicious client copies p𝑝p fraction of its local training examples, embeds the trigger to them, changes their labels to the attacker-chosen target label, and uses them to augment its local training data. Then, in each iteration of FL, each malicious client computes its local model update based on the augmented local training data and scales it by a factor λ≫1much-greater-than𝜆1\\lambda\\gg 1 before sending it to the server. Specifically, we use the same pattern trigger in [ref]18 as our trigger for MNIST-0.1, MNIST-0.5, Fashion-MNIST, and CH-MNIST, and we set the attacker-chosen target label as 0; for CIFAR-10, we consider the same pattern trigger and target label (i.e., “bird”) in ;\nand for HAR, we create a feature-pattern trigger by setting every 20th feature to 0 and we set the target label as “WALKING_UPSTAIRS”. Following previous work , we set the scaling factor λ=n𝜆𝑛\\lambda=n, where n𝑛n is the number of clients. In each dataset, the attacker-chosen target testing examples consist of the trigger-embedded normal testing examples whose true labels are not the target label. Adaptive attack: \nWe evaluate the adaptive attack proposed in Section V. Our adaptive attack leverages an zeroth-order optimization method. Following the suggestions by previous work [ref]13 , we set σ2=0.5superscript𝜎20.5\\sigma^{2}=0.5 and γ=0.005𝛾0.005\\gamma=0.005 in the zeroth-order method. Moreover, we set η=0.01𝜂0.01\\eta=0.01 and V=Q=10𝑉𝑄10V=Q=10 so that the adaptive attack converges.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: For data poisoning attack, we consider the popular label flipping attack.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
