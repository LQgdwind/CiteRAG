      "content": "Paper Title: Towards a Simultaneous and Granular Identity-Expression Control in Personalized Face Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConditional Face Generation.\nEarly methods usually use a single modality as conditioning. For example, there has been a surge of text-to-face researches that utilize the pre-trained StyleGAN    and the text encoder, such as TediGAN , StyleCLIP  and StyleT2I . Using images as conditioning [ref]5  [ref]46 [ref]27 is also popular in the research community. This kind of methods is also known as face swapping and face reenactment, where the generated face has the same identity or expression with the input face image. The most recent methods begin to use multiple modalities, due to the fact that different modalities are complementary to each other. For example, the tuple of texts and segmentation masks   is very popular to control face generation. Our proposed face generation framework also takes as input multiple modalities, text and image. Our work is also closely related to face swapping and expression reenactment.\nThe mainstream way to improve visual quality is using GANs [ref]5      [ref]46     , which inject the identity or expression features extracted from the source into the face swapping or expression reenactment network, and use multiple losses to ensure semantic consistency and image fidelity. The most recent method  employs a diffusion model, and reformulates the face swapping as a conditional inpainting task. There exist methods 0 [ref]27   that combine the two tasks, swapping and reenactment, in a single framework. In their pipeline, a switch operator is usually placed in the facial features transfer stage to switch between swapping and reenactment tasks. The main difference in functionality between these methods and our DiffSFSR is that, either identity or expression, but not both of them, is transferred to the result. Preliminary on Diffusion Models. The diffusion model (DDPM)  has been well documented. It contains diffusion and denoising processes. Given a data distribution 𝐱0∼q​(𝐱0)similar-tosubscript𝐱0𝑞subscript𝐱0\\mathbf{x}_{0}\\sim q(\\mathbf{x}_{0}),\nthe diffusion process produces a series of intermediate noisy samples {𝐱t}subscript𝐱𝑡\\{\\mathbf{x}_{t}\\} by continuously adding Gaussian noise 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N} with variance βt∈(0,1)subscript𝛽𝑡01\\beta_{t}\\in(0,1) at timestep t𝑡t: q​(𝐱1:T|𝐱0)=∏t=1Tq​(𝐱t|𝐱t−1)𝑞conditionalsubscript𝐱:1𝑇subscript𝐱0superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑡1𝑇𝑞conditionalsubscript𝐱𝑡subscript𝐱𝑡1q(\\mathbf{x}_{1:T}|\\mathbf{x}_{0})=\\prod_{t=1}^{T}q(\\mathbf{x}_{t}|\\mathbf{x}_{t-1}) where q​(𝐱t|𝐱t−1)=𝒩​(𝐱t;1−βt​𝐱t−1,βt​𝐈)𝑞conditionalsubscript𝐱𝑡subscript𝐱𝑡1𝒩subscript𝐱𝑡1subscript𝛽𝑡subscript𝐱𝑡1subscript𝛽𝑡𝐈q(\\mathbf{x}_{t}|\\mathbf{x}_{t-1})=\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{x}_{t};\\sqrt{1-\\beta_{t}}\\mathbf{x}_{t-1},\\beta_{t}\\mathbf{I}). xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t} can be sampled directly from x0subscript𝑥0x_{0}, without generating intermediate steps: where αt=1−βtsubscript𝛼𝑡1subscript𝛽𝑡\\alpha_{t}=1-\\beta_{t} and α¯t=∏s=1tαssubscript¯𝛼𝑡superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑠1𝑡subscript𝛼𝑠\\bar{\\alpha}_{t}=\\prod_{s=1}^{t}\\alpha_{s}.\nWhen a long increasing sequence β1:Tsubscript𝛽:1𝑇\\beta_{1:T} is set such that α¯≈0¯𝛼0\\bar{\\alpha}\\approx 0, the distribution of 𝐱Tsubscript𝐱𝑇\\mathbf{x}_{T} will converge to a standard Gaussian. The denoising process starts from a Gaussian noise sample 𝐱T∼𝒩​(0,I)similar-tosubscript𝐱𝑇𝒩0𝐼\\mathbf{x}_{T}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,I), and denoises 𝐱Tsubscript𝐱𝑇\\mathbf{x}_{T} to 𝐱0subscript𝐱0\\mathbf{x}_{0} by sequentially sampling the posteriors q​(𝐱t−1|𝐱t)𝑞conditionalsubscript𝐱𝑡1subscript𝐱𝑡q(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1}|\\mathbf{x}_{t}). Based on Bayesian rules, q​(𝐱t−1|𝐱t,𝐱0)𝑞conditionalsubscript𝐱𝑡1subscript𝐱𝑡subscript𝐱0q(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1}|\\mathbf{x}_{t},\\mathbf{x}_{0}) can be derived to: Hence, q​(𝐱t−1|𝐱t,𝐱0)𝑞conditionalsubscript𝐱𝑡1subscript𝐱𝑡subscript𝐱0q(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1}|\\mathbf{x}_{t},\\mathbf{x}_{0}) has no closed-form, and a deep neutral network pθsubscript𝑝𝜃p_{\\theta} is trained to approximate it.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: For example, there has been a surge of text-to-face researches that utilize the pre-trained StyleGAN    and the text encoder, such as TediGAN , StyleCLIP  and StyleT2I .
