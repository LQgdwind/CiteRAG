Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: Quasi-Framelets: Another Improvement to Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo evaluate the performances on homogeneous graphs and heterogeneous graphs separately, our model is compared with several baselines. 1) spectral GNN methods: SPECTRAL CNN [ref]2, CHEBYSHEV , GWNN [ref]28, LANCZOSNET , UFGCONV [ref]32; 2) spatial GNN methods: GCN , GAT , GraphSAGE ; 3) Heterogeneous GNN methods: DeepWalk , ESim , Metapath2 , HAN, UFGCONV on heterogeneous graphs.\n For each experiment, we report the average results of 10 runs. Except for some default hyper-parameters, hyper-parameters, such as learning rates, number of hidden units, of all models are tuned based on the result on the validation set. Through the parameter tunning, for Cora and Citeseer datasets the number of hidden units is 32, learning rate is 0.01 and the number of iterations is 200 with early stopping on the validation set. For PubMed dataset, experiments are conducted with 64 hidden units , 0.005 learning rate and 250 iterations. For experiments on heterogeneous graphs, on IMDB and ACM datasets, the number of hidden units is 16, number of layers is 3, learning rate is 0.005 and number of epochs is 200. Besides, a similar set of parameters are used on DBLP dataset except for the number of hidden units which is 64.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: To evaluate the performances on homogeneous graphs and heterogeneous graphs separately, our model is compared with several baselines. 1) spectral GNN methods: SPECTRAL CNN [ref]2, CHEBYSHEV , GWNN [ref]28, LANCZOSNET , UFGCONV [ref]32; 2) spatial GNN methods: GCN , GAT , GraphSAGE ; 3) Heterogeneous GNN methods: DeepWalk , ESim , Metapath2 , HAN, UFGCONV on\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
