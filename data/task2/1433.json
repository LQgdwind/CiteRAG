      "content": "Paper Title: VinVL: Revisiting Visual Representations in Vision-Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAn image captioning model generates a natural language description for a given image. To enable sentence generation, we fine-tune Oscar+ using the seq2seq objective. The input samples are processed to triples consisting of image region features, captions, and object tags, in the same way as that during the pre-training. We randomly mask out 15%percent1515\\% of the caption tokens and use the corresponding output representations to perform classification to predict the token ids. Similar to previous works [ref]21 , the self-attention mask is constrained such that a caption token can only attend to the tokens before its position to simulate a uni-directional generation process.\nNote that all caption tokens will have full attentions to image regions and object tags but not the other way around. During inference, we first encode the image regions, object tags, and a special token [𝙲𝙻𝚂]delimited-[]𝙲𝙻𝚂\\mathtt{[CLS]} as input. Then the model starts the generation by feeding in a [𝙼𝙰𝚂𝙺]delimited-[]𝙼𝙰𝚂𝙺\\mathtt{[MASK]} token and\nselecting\na token from the vocabulary based on the likelihood output. Next, the [𝙼𝙰𝚂𝙺]delimited-[]𝙼𝙰𝚂𝙺\\mathtt{[MASK]} token in the previous input sequence is replaced with the selected token and a new [𝙼𝙰𝚂𝙺]delimited-[]𝙼𝙰𝚂𝙺\\mathtt{[MASK]} is appended for the next word prediction. The generation process terminates when the model outputs the [𝚂𝙴𝙿]delimited-[]𝚂𝙴𝙿\\mathtt{[SEP]} token. We use beam search (i.e., beam size = 5) [ref]2 in our experiments and report our results on the COCO image captioning dataset. Though the training objective (i.e., seq2seq) for image captioning is different from that used in pre-training (i.e., bidirectional attention-based masked token loss), we directly fine-tune Oscar+ for image captioning on COCO without additional pre-training on Conceptual Captions . This is to validate the generalization ability of the Oscar+ models for generation tasks. We use the same Karpathy split .\nFor the Oscar+BB{}_{\\text{B}} model, we fine-tune with cross-entropy loss for 303030 epochs with a batch size of 256256256 and an initial learning rate of 1​e−51superscript𝑒51e^{-5} and then with CIDEr optimization  for 101010 epochs with a batch size of 128128128 and initial learning rate of 2​e−62superscript𝑒62e^{-6}.\nWe compare with several existing methods, including\nBUTD [ref]2,\nVLP ,\nAoANet [ref]10,\nOSCAR [ref]21.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: We randomly mask out 15%percent1515\\% of the caption tokens and use the corresponding output representations to perform classification to predict the token ids.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
