      "content": "Paper Title: DORY: Automatic End-to-End Deployment of Real-World DNNs on Low-Cost IoT MCUs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) envisions billions of wireless-connected end-nodes , which can sense, process and transmit data for a wide range of applications such as surveillance , health monitoring , agriculture [ref]4, robotics , and others.\nHowever, major challenges are linked to this new computation paradigm, including reliability, security, capacity, together with the production of high-bandwidth data.\nIn this scenario, edge-based Deep Learning (DL) is an attractive approach thanks to its capability to extract high-level features from raw sensor data, reducing off-node transmissions, and improving security by doing most processing in-place. Modern Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference tasks run on cloud servers, personal computers, or smartphones. Even in the most constrained scenario of mobile devices, their execution can count on GB of memory and significant processing power available, under a power envelope of a few watts.\nConversely, deploying DNNs on a microcontroller-based IoT end-node has to deliver similar performance while dealing with i) strict constraints in terms of memory (a few MB off-chip, and typically 1 MB on-chip at most), ii) limited computational capabilities, and iii) battery constraints and a peak power envelope of 100-200 mW.\nThe deployment of DL-based algorithms on the IoT demands aggressive hardware, software, and algorithmic co-optimization to exploit the scarce resources on these systems to the maximum degree .\nIn particular, the scarce availability of memory constitutes a real Deep Learning Memory Wall [ref]7: a fundamental limitation to the maximum performance of an embedded DNN compute system. Recently introduced algorithmic improvements such as quantized DNN inference  aim at matching a DNN’s full-precision accuracy while using exclusively 8-bit (or smaller) integer data to reduce memory occupation and execution complexity. On the hardware side, accelerators  0 1 and instruction set architecture (ISA) extensions 2 that exploit quantization have been introduced to speed up the computation, lessen the impact of memory constraints and minimize energy consumption. In essence, 8-bit networks are now supported by most of the frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.\nRecently proposed architectural paradigms aim at maximizing DNN performance and efficiency on IoT end-nodes while safeguarding the flexibility of typical Microcontroller Unit (MCUs), so that common control-oriented MCU tasks can be mixed with DNNs and non-DL-based data processing tasks.\nThese architectures often couple a conventional MCU with an accelerator 3 4.\nParallel Ultra-Low-Power computing (PULP), for example, is an architectural paradigm based on flexible software-oriented acceleration for DNNs and other data processing tasks in multi-core end-nodes.\nThe core idea of PULP is to couple an I/O-dedicated core with a multi-core cluster of processors optimized for data-parallel processing, sharing a high-bandwidth multi-banked L1 memory 5. Accelerated IoT end-nodes employ multi-level hierarchies of on- and off-chip memories. In some cases, they\ndo away entirely with energy-expensive coherent data caches, exploiting manually managed scratchpad memories instead to maximize area and energy efficiency.\nFor example, PULP architectures complement a small (<< 128 kB) L1 with a bigger-but-slower (∼similar-to\\sim1 GB/s) on-chip L2 memory, and by an off-chip L3 low-power IoT DRAM 6 that provides high capacity, but at a slower speed (∼similar-to\\sim100 MB/s) and with relatively high energy penalty (>> 50 pJ/B).\nThese composite memory hierarchies are becoming necessary even in low-power systems to cope with the memory footprint of DNN inference, without paying the cost of huge on-chip caches.\nHowever, to “unlock” such a system’s theoretical performance often requires carefully managed data movement by means of cache locking or explicit DMA transfers.\nTo reduce the related development overhead, software caches 7 and data tiling strategies 8 have been proposed: however, most DL-based applications can improve upon general-purpose solutions by exploiting the regular structure of DNNs, with ad-hoc memory management flows to minimize inference time  9, exploit data reuse, and optimize scheduling 0.\nConversely, automatic solutions for end-to-end deployment of real-world DNNs on MCUs so-far rely either on slow and inefficient interpretation (e.g., TF-Lite Micro 1), or on proprietary code generation frameworks (e.g., ST XCUBE-AI 2, GWT111GreenWaves Technologies. AutoTiler 222https://greenwaves-technologies.com/manuals/BUILD/AUTOTILER/html/index.html). In this paper, we introduce a novel lightweight framework called DORY, Development Oriented to memoRY, which aims at the deployment of end-to-end DNNs on memory-starved end-nodes, and particularly tuned to the class of end-nodes based on the PULP paradigm.\nAs our main case study, we target GWT GAP-8 3 – one of the most advanced low-power edge nodes available in the market, embodying the PULP architectural paradigm with DSP-enhanced RISC-V cores. We introduce several novel contributions: A tool for multi-level memory tiling aiming at the deployment of realistically sized DNNs on memory-starved MCUs. Relying on Constraint Programming (CP) optimization, our tool matches on- and off-chip memory hierarchy constraints with DNN geometrical requirements, such as the relationships between input, weight, and output tensor dimensions. A set of heuristics to maximize the performance of the CP solution on PULP platforms using the dedicated backend library PULP-NN 4, to maximize throughput and energy efficiency in the RISC-V based GAP-8 target. A code generator using tiling solutions to produce ANSI C code for the target platform, with all data L3-L2-L1 orchestration implemented as fully pipelined, triple-buffered DMA transfers and integrated calls to the computational backend (PULP-NN). Tailored optimizations for common architectural features of modern DNNs: i) for residual connections, a bidirectional stack avoiding memory fragmentation; ii) for depthwise layers, a new optimized backend not present in PULP-NN. We evaluate the performance and energy efficiency of the deployed networks produced by DORY on GWT GAP-8, considering both single layers and end-to-end networks.\nDORY achieves up to 18.1×\\times better MAC/cycle than the state-of-the-art result on a conventional cache-based microcontroller, the STM32-H743 MCU, in single layer execution.\nUsing DORY, end-to-end deployment of 8-bit quantized networks such as 0.5-MobileNet-v1-192, achieve up to 8.00 MACs/cycle, with a 13.2×\\times improvement compared to the same networks running on the STM32-H743 using the state-of-the-art ST X-CUBE-AI. Furthermore, on a layer by layer basis, DORY can achieve up to 2.5×\\times better throughput than the proprietary GWT AutoTiler, on the same GAP-8 platform, and up to 27% better performance on full network execution.\nOur results show that image recognition on an extreme edge-node can run in as little as 11.9 mJ/classification @ 4.3 fps. To put our results into context, we compare the efficacy of DORY on GAP-8 with that obtainable in a state-of-the-art single-core ARM M7 core, the off-the-shelf ST32-H743 MCU with 16 kB of L1 data cache (D$) and 128 kB of L1 scratchpad memory.\nFor a set of 44 DNN layers of different size, we compare i) single-core execution on GAP-8 with DORY-based memory management, ii) M7 execution with active D$, iii) M7 execution with DORY-managed DMA transfers on the scratchpad memory.\nOur results show that on the M7, DORY automatic memory management is up to 9% faster than the 16 kB hardware cache, and never slower.\nWe also show that single-core execution on GAP-8 is, on average, 2.5×\\times faster than on the M7 in cycles/cycles thanks to the full exploitation of the DSP-enhanced RISC-V cores.\n To foster research on real-world deeply embedded DNN applications, we release the DORY framework, the optimized backend kernels, and the PULP heuristics discussed in this paper as open-source 333https://github.com/pulp-platform/dory.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Things (IoT) envisions billions of wireless-connected end-nodes , which can sense, process and transmit data for a wide range of applications such as surveillance , health monitoring , agriculture [ref]4, robotics , and others.\nHowever, major challenges are linked to this new computation paradigm, including reliability, security, capacity, together with the production of high-bandwidth\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
