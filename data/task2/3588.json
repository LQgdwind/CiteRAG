Here, we make progress in both lower and upper bound directions.\nWe give a general lower bound in D𝐷D dimensions\nthat is tight for all possible values of β𝛽\\beta.\nOur lower bound attains the maximum possible β𝛽\\beta value 𝒎D,Δ=(D+ΔD)−1subscript𝒎𝐷Δbinomial𝐷Δ𝐷1\\boldsymbol{m}_{D,\\Delta}=\\binom{D+\\Delta}{D}-1,\ne.g., Ω𝑜​(n14)𝑜Ωsuperscript𝑛14\\overset{\\scriptscriptstyle o}{\\Omega}(n^{14}) for D=2,Δ=4formulae-sequence𝐷2Δ4D=2,\\Delta=4.\nThus, our lower bounds almost completely settle the general case of the problem for the fast-query case,\nas far as the exponent of n𝑛n is concerned.\nThis improvement is quite non-trivial and requires significant new insights that are not avaiable in [ref]3.\nFor the upper bound, we present a matching space-time tradeoff\nfor the two problems studied in [ref]3\nfor uniform random point sets.\nThis shows their lower bound analysis is tight.\nSince for most range searching problems,\na uniform random input instance is the hardest one,\nour results show that current upper bound based on the classical method\nmight not be optimal.\nWe develop a set of new ideas for our results\nwhich we believe are important for further investigation\nof this problem.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: to O~​(nD)~𝑂superscript𝑛𝐷\\tilde{O}(n^{D})\n(e.g., for Δ=4Δ4\\Delta=4, from O~​(n14)~𝑂superscript𝑛14\\tilde{O}(n^{14})\nto O~​(n2)~𝑂superscript𝑛2\\tilde{O}(n^{2})).\nVery recently, Afshani and Cheng [ref]3\nrefuted this conjecture by showing a Ω𝑜​(nΔ+1)𝑜Ωsuperscript𝑛Δ1\\overset{\\scriptscriptstyle o}{\\Omega}(n^{\\Delta+1}) lower bound.\nHowever, there are two major limitations of their lower\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
