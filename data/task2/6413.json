      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge Transfer-Driven Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClass-incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable continuous learning of new classes while retaining knowledge of previously learned classes.\nHowever, due to the limitation of using old data, the model’s parameters are overwritten by the data of new classes in incremental sessions, leading to the notorious catastrophic forgetting problem.\nTo address this issue, current CIL methods can be roughly categorized into four groups: regularization-based, rehearsal-based, isolation-based, and rehearsal-free approaches.\nThe regularization-based methods [ref]24  distill the knowledge from previous tasks when training the new task to prevent the model from forgetting old, such as Li et al.  propose to distill the outputs of classification model while Douillard et al. [ref]24 distill the features of each stage in the feature extraction process.\nThe rehearsal-based methods   [ref]6 adopt different strategies, such as reservoir sampling , to restore samples of the previous task and then use them either as inputs or constrain to alleviate catastrophic forgetting when train the new task.\nTo store more old samples with limited memory, Wang et al. [ref]6 propose to reduce the image’s quality.\nThe isolation-based methods [ref]29  introduce extra parameters for each new task, such as Yan et al. [ref]29 train new feature encoder for each new task.\nWith the emerging of foundation models , the rehearsal-free methods design various prompt-based strategies to learn corresponding knowledge for different incremental tasks  .\nDespite the advance of current CIL methods, these methods often assume there are sufficient training samples for new class learning, which are not suitable for some incremental scenarios where training samples for new classes are limited.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: this issue, current CIL methods can be roughly categorized into four groups: regularization-based, rehearsal-based, isolation-based, and rehearsal-free approaches.\nThe regularization-based methods [ref]24  distill the knowledge from previous tasks when training the new task to prevent the model from forgetting old, such as Li et al.  propose to distill the outputs of classification model while\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
