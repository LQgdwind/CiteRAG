      "content": "Paper Title: Interpretability of Machine Learning Methods Applied to Neuroimaging\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEitel and Ritter¬†[ref]37 tested the robustness of four methods: standard perturbation, gradient‚äôdirect-product\\odotinput, guided back-propagation and LRP. To evaluate these methods, the authors trained ten times the same model with a random initialization and generated attribution maps for each of the ten runs. For each method, they exhibited significant differences between the averaged true positives/negatives attribution maps of the ten runs. To quantify this variance, they computed the ‚Ñì‚Ñì\\ell2-norm between the attribution maps, and determined for each model the brain regions with the highest attribution. They concluded that LRP and guided back-propagation were the most consistent methods, both in terms of distance between attribution maps and most relevant brain regions. However this study makes a strong assumption: to draw these conclusions, the network should provide stable interpretations across retrainings. Unfortunately, Thibeau-Sutre et al.¬†[ref]51 showed that the study of the robustness of the interpretability method and of the network should be done separately, as their network retraining was not robust. Indeed, they first showed that the interpretability method they chose (optimized perturbation) was robust according to different criteria, then they observed that network retraining led to different attribution maps. The robustness of an interpretability method thus cannot be assessed from the protocol described in¬†[ref]37. Moreover, the fact that guided back-propagation is one of the most stable method meets the results of , who observed that guided back-propagation always gave the same result independently from the weights learned by a network (see Section¬†4.1). B√∂hle et al.¬† measured the benefit of LRP with Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta-rule compared to guided back-propagation by comparing the intensities of the mean attribution map of demented patients and the one of cognitively normal controls. They concluded that LRP allowed a stronger distinction between these two classes than guided back-propagation, as there was a greater difference between the mean maps for LRP. Moreover, they found a stronger correlation between the intensities of the LRP attribution map in the hippocampus and the hippocampal volume than for guided back-propagation. But as  demonstrated that guided back-propagation has serious flaws, it does not allow drawing strong conclusions. Nigri et al.¬† compared the standard perturbation method to a swap test (see Section¬†3.4) using two properties: the continuity and the sensitivity. The continuity property is verified if two similar input images have similar explanations. The sensitivity property affirms that the most salient areas in an explanation map should have the greater impact in the prediction when removed. The authors carried out experiments with several types of models, and both properties were consistently verified for the swap test, while the standard perturbation method showed a significant absence of continuity and no conclusive fidelity values¬†. Finally Rieke et al.¬† compared four visualization methods: standard back-propagation, guided back-propagation, standard perturbation and brain area perturbation. They computed the Euclidean distance between the mean attribution maps of the same class for two different methods and observed that both gradient methods were close, whereas brain area perturbation was different from all others. They concluded that as interpretability methods lead to different attribution maps, one should compare the results of available methods and not trust only one attribution map.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: Eitel and Ritter¬†[ref]37 tested the robustness of four methods: standard perturbation, gradient‚äôdirect-product\\odotinput, guided back-propagation and LRP.
