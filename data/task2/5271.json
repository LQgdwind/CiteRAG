PETAL also offers a probabilistic perspective and justification to CoTTA which arises a special case of PETAL. Bayesian Adaptation for Covariate Shift (BACS)  proposes a Bayesian perspective for TENT, which naturally gives rise to the entropy term along with a regularizer that captures knowledge from posterior density obtained from training data. However, BACS only addresses standard TTA setting, and regularized entropy minimization lacks the ability to handle error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting encountered in lifelong TTA.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Some works also refer to TTA as source-free domain adaptation.\nRecent works explore source-free domain [ref]24  [ref]21 setting in which training data is unavailable and only unlabeled data is available during adaptation.
