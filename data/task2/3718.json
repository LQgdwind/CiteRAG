Specifically, seq2seq EVC training requires a large-sized, parallel, one-speaker, emotional dataset. For instance,  utilised a Korean emotional dataset (mKETTS) including 3 000 utterances per emotional category pronounced by one male speaker, and there are 7 different emotions in total (neutral, anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise). In , the dataset used contains only 200 emotional utterances (10 sentences ×\\times 4 emotional category ×\\times 5 levels of intensity, anger, joy, fear, and sadness) recorded by one French actress. However, the researched conversion in this work was on the syllable-level. Thus, the model was trained by using around 1 100 syllable pairs after forced alignment . A speaker encoder allows the use of a multi-speaker dataset – a method utilised by both [ref]27 and [ref]20.\n[ref]27 used a Chinese emotional dataset including three speakers, three emotional categories (anger, happiness, and sadness) and 6 hours of recording to fine-tune their pre-trained VC model. Similarly, the dataset in [ref]20 includes 100 sentences in 4 different emotional categories (neutral, anger, happiness, and sadness) pronounced by 5 Korean actors and 5 Korean actresses, for a total of 4 000 utterances. Instead of using a speaker encoder to expand the range of usable emotional datasets,   utilised two-stage training on the model to reduce its dependency on the size of the emotional dataset. At the first stage, about 30 hours of recordings recorded by 99 speakers from a multi-speaker corpus called VCTK  were applied to pre-train the model. Then, only 350 pairs of emotional speeches from ESD  were used to fine-tune, enabling them to improve their performance.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: To achieve a decent performance by using seq2seq training, a large-sized dataset is very essential [ref]24.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
