      "content": "Paper Title: Dissecting Distribution Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate our attacks on twelve task-property pairs across five datasets, summarized in Table I. These were selected to directly compare results with previous works (RSNA Bone Age, ogbn-arxiv, CelebA), to study the impact of task-property correlation on inference risk (various property-task pairs for CelebA), and to include datasets representing real-world use-cases, like Census19 and Texas-100X. Census19 [ref]30 is an updated and expanded version of the Adult Census dataset [ref]5 based on data from the US Census Bureau. It contains a mixture of numerical and categorical features, and the same prediction task. We focus on the ratio of whites (race) and females (sex) as properties, and use a two-layer feed-forward neural-network as the architecture. Texas-100X [ref]15 contains demographic and medical information for patients across hospitals. The original dataset uses 100 possible classes for surgical procedure prediction. We slightly modify the task and focus only on data from the top 20 classes, reducing it to a 20-class classification task. We focus on the ratio of whites (race), females (sex), and Hispanics (ethnicity) as properties, and use a two-layer feed-forward neural-network. CelebA  contains collections of face images of celebrities. Each image is annotated with attributes. We use three different tasks: smile detection, gender prediction, and mouth-open prediction. We conduct experiments with a convolutional neural network trained from scratch for this dataset, with five convolutional layers and pooling layers followed by three linear layers, which is the smallest network we could find with reasonable task accuracy. For our experiments with feature extractors, we also conduct experiments where the adversary uses a pre-trained FaceNet  model trained on the CASIA-WebFace  dataset, with a two-layer network. It leads to a drop in performance (from ∼92%similar-toabsentpercent92\\sim 92\\% to ∼82%similar-toabsentpercent82\\sim 82\\%), but the point of such an experiment is indeed to assess inference risk in more practical settings. For the attack inference properties, we use the proportion of females (smile-detection task), old people (gender-prediction task), people with wavy hair (mouth-open-prediction task), and people with high cheekbones (mouth-open prediction task). These pairs are useful in comparing results with previous works, and also help cover a spectrum of different correlations between the task and property attributes. RSNA Bone Age  contains x-ray images of hands, and the standard task is to predict the patient’s age in months. We convert the task to binary classification based on an age threshold (>132absent132>132 months), and focus on the ratios of the females (available as metadata) as properties. We also consider a flipped scenario, where the task is to predict females, with the ratios of people below the age threshold as properties. We use a pre-trained DenseNet  model for feature extraction, followed by a two-layer network for classification.\nSimilar to CelebA, we consider a setting where the adversary uses pre-trained feature extractor, while the victim trains models from scratch. Additionally, we also consider a setting where both the victim and adversary use the same feature extractor, but use different model architectures on top of the feature extractor ogbn-arxiv  is a directed graph of citations between computer science arXiv papers, with the task as predicted subject area categories (out of 40) using features extracted from paper documents. We infer the mean node-degree property of the graph, and use Graph Convolutional Networks .\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: the impact of task-property correlation on inference risk (various property-task pairs for CelebA), and to include datasets representing real-world use-cases, like Census19 and Texas-100X.
