      "content": "Paper Title: An Improved Transfer Model: Randomized Transferable Machine\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTransfer learning  aims to build a transfer model using the data from a source domain while generalizing good performance on the prediction task of another different but related target domain.\nSuch a knowledge transfer avoids the expensive process of collecting target labelled data, but faces the challenge of domain divergence, i.e., the data distribution usually differs dramatically across domains.\nFeature-based transfer method is one of the most effective methodologies to handle the distribution discrepancy, where subspace learning  [ref]3  and deep feature learning [ref]5   are two popular research lines.\nThe underlying rationale is that, although two domains may differ considerably in the original feature space, there exists a domain-invariant feature representation with which the data distribution discrepancy can be eliminated.\nBoth subspace learning and deep feature learning methods aim to learn such a ‘good’ feature representation. To yield better and better feature representation, researchers are exploring more and more complex data properties, including geometric structure , sparsity [ref]9, second-order moments 0, low-rankness 1, multiple manifolds 2, and disentanglement 3, etc.\nWith the recent advancement in deep learning, research efforts are gradually confined to the improvements on the network structure.\nWith the learned new feature representation, existing works directly train a transfer model on the source domain.\nSituation differs slightly between subspace learning and deep feature learning, where the former usually decouples feature learning with model training as two separate stages while the latter jointly learns new feature representation and transfer model together.\nAdmittedly, such a conventional way of training transfer model is straightforward considering that only the source domain has sufficient labelled data.\nHowever, an important question remains: Is the learned new feature representation sufficiently good enough to guarantee that the transfer model trained on the source domain can generalize well to the target domain?\nIn other words, is the new feature representation truly domain-invariant? The continuing emergence of new feature-based transfer methods with their incremental improvements on transfer performance implicitly indicates that the truly domain-invariant feature representation may have not been achieved yet.\nAlthough existing efforts claim the success of learning the domain-invariant feature representation, their results are usually quickly “defeated” by newer works.\nNew feature-based transfer methods are flourishing, and such a ‘defeat-to-improve’ situation seems to be endless as it stands now.\nOne may naturally doubt whether the truly domain-invariant feature representation is achievable.\nUnfortunately, no existing works can answer this question, and we can only get some clues from the development of feature-based transfer studies. The distance metric, used to measure the feature distribution discrepancy of domains, is diversified including Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) 4, A-distance 5, and Wasserstein distance (W-distance) 6, etc.\nThere is no a clear winner that is significantly superior over the others among these metrics.\nIn practice, it is difficult to decide which metric is the best for transfer learning, and infeasible to predict whether more advanced metrics would be proposed in the future.\nMoreover, for a specific metric, it usually cannot achieve the ideal zero-divergence due to various reasons, e.g., the finite number of data samples, the consideration of other data properties, the hyper-parameters initialized for learning, and optimization related matters.\nWith these observations, we deduce that it is extremely hard to achieve the truly domain-invariant feature representation.\nCurrent works may only yield some suboptimal alternatives. Consequently, there is still space to further boost the transfer performance, although the data with the new feature representation (called the new data in the following sections) have enhanced domain similarities.\nSince distribution discrepancy still exists in the new data of the domains, probably very small, the conventional transfer model directly trained on the new source data is problematic.\nWe thus focus on the problem of how to train an improved transfer model that further boosts the transfer performance of the conventional one.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying such a problem, while existing works assume the new data are truly domain-invariant, and directly adopts the conventional transfer model. Considering that the new data of the source and target domains are already similar in many extents, we should pay more attention to the nuances of the domains in the learning of the improved transfer model.\nTo do so, we propose randomized transferable machine (RTM).\nInstead of training a model that fits the new source data only, we propose to train an RTM that is capable of generalizing good performance on numerous noisy data populations that are generated from the new source data.\nThe underlying intuition is that the noisy data populations are diversified enough to cover the characteristics of the new target data.\nThis is reasonable as the new source and target data are already very similar.\nThe small discrepancies can be easily captured by the rich noisy source data populations.\nFigure 1 shows the idea of RTM.\nFrom Figure 1(a) to 1(b), we can see that the two domains represented by the new data are well aligned.\nOnly a small region of the new target data is wrongly classified by the transfer model trained on the source.\nTo further make correctness on this small region, a large number of noisy data are generated by randomly corrupting the new source data as shown in Figure 1(c).\nA hyperplane ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} is then learned on these noisy source data populations.\nFigure 1(d) shows that the constructed noisy source data populations successfully cover the new target data, and ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} performs well. In principle, the more random corruptions are constructed, the higher the probability of the new target data can be covered by the noisy source data populations, and thus the better transfer performance is achieved by RTM.\nThe ideal case is training RTM with an infinite number of random corruptions.\nHowever, it is infeasible in practice.\nTo make it happen, we provide a marginalized solution to simulate infinite random corruptions without really conducting any corruption.\nBy training RTM with this marginalization trick, it is expected to boost transfer performance on the target task.\nNote that different types of noise can be used to corrupt the new source data.\nIn this paper, we present the general form of RTM, and then propose two instantiations of RTM with a dropout noise.\nBy using the linear regression model and the kernel ridge regression model as the base model, we develop an RTMdl​rsuperscriptsubscriptabsent𝑙𝑟𝑑{}_{lr}^{d} and an RTMdk​rsuperscriptsubscriptabsent𝑘𝑟𝑑{}_{kr}^{d}.\nThe learning objectives of the two instantiations have closed-form solutions, which makes the training of them fast and efficient.\nSince RTMdl​rsuperscriptsubscriptabsent𝑙𝑟𝑑{}_{lr}^{d} and RTMdk​rsuperscriptsubscriptabsent𝑘𝑟𝑑{}_{kr}^{d} have the similar mathematical form, we only focus on the easier one, i.e., RTMdl​rsuperscriptsubscriptabsent𝑙𝑟𝑑{}_{lr}^{d}, to show the effectiveness of the idea of RTM.\nWe test RTMdl​rsuperscriptsubscriptabsent𝑙𝑟𝑑{}_{lr}^{d} using the new data learned from various state-of-the-art feature-based transfer methods.\nThe empirical results show that RTMdl​rsuperscriptsubscriptabsent𝑙𝑟𝑑{}_{lr}^{d} further improves the transfer performance compared with the conventional transfer model.\nWe also test RTMdl​rsuperscriptsubscriptabsent𝑙𝑟𝑑{}_{lr}^{d} by directly training it using the original source data, and surprisingly, we observe that RTMdl​rsuperscriptsubscriptabsent𝑙𝑟𝑑{}_{lr}^{d} is capable of achieving considerable good performance.\nIn some tasks, RTMdl​rsuperscriptsubscriptabsent𝑙𝑟𝑑{}_{lr}^{d} even outperforms deep learning based transfer methods.\nFurther considering the fast training speed, we believe RTMdl​rsuperscriptsubscriptabsent𝑙𝑟𝑑{}_{lr}^{d} is a promising transfer model. This paper is an extension of 7. Compared with 7, we make the following new contributions in this paper. Firstly, we rewrote the introduction and related work sections to make them more comprehensive. We added more discussions on the state-of-the-art studies and highlighted the motivation of our method. Secondly, we proposed a new general framework of Randomized Transferable Machine (RTM) that allows diversified instantiations. The paper 7 is one of the instantiations with a linear regression function and a dropout noise.\nWe further proposed a new instantiation with a kernel ridge function and the dropout noise. Thirdly, we gave more theoretical analyses on the underlying rationale why the instantiated RTM is superior to the conventional transfer model on the transfer performance from the perspective of adaptive regularization. Fourthly, we presented a comprehensive discussion on the proposed RTM including the relatedness to other research topics, the generality to different instantiations, the training computational complexity, the technical significance compared with the existing works, the scalability to different feature-based transfer methods, and the applicability to the original data. Lastly, we conducted extensive experimental studies to verify the transfer performance of RTM. The new experiments include a set of synthetic experiments, experiments on new feature representation learned from deep learning based methods, model similarity analysis, and data augmentation analysis. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.\nWe discuss related work in Section II.\nIn Section III, we elaborate the problem setting and the motivation of our RTM.\nWe then introduce the technical details of RTM in Section IV and V.\nThe experimental study is described in Section VI.\nWe conclude the paper in Section VII.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: distribution usually differs dramatically across domains.\nFeature-based transfer method is one of the most effective methodologies to handle the distribution discrepancy, where subspace learning  [ref]3  and deep feature learning [ref]5   are two popular research lines.\nThe underlying rationale is that, although two domains may differ considerably in the original feature space, there exists a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
