      "content": "Paper Title: Size Should not Matter: Scale-invariant Stress Metrics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBackground: An undirected graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) is a mathematical object made up of a set of objects called vertices, V𝑉V, and a set of connections between them called edges, E⊆V×V𝐸𝑉𝑉E\\subseteq V\\times V.\nThe graph layout (embedding) problem involves assigning positions to the vertices, typically in the 2D Euclidean space, subject to predefined optimization goals, such as maintaining graph-theoretic distances or showing clusters .\nWe restrict ourselves to two-dimensional, straight-line layouts, and refer to them as graph drawings. A large corpus of algorithms to produce such drawings exist; see  for a recent survey. stress metric     , defined formally in Section 3. All vector norms ||..||||..|| that appear in this paper refer to the Euclidean 2-norm. Different graph drawing algorithms are designed to optimize different aesthetic criteria 4 3    and different evaluation metrics have been proposed 8 1.\nPurchase 8 proposed seven metrics for aesthetic criteria, including symmetry. It is not obvious how to compute a measure of symmetry, for example Klapaukh 1 suggests an edge-based metric that explicitly calculates reflection, rotation and translation symmetries, whereas the metric defined by Purchase 8 considers only reflective symmetry, ignoring rotational symmetry. A later study shows that the values of these metrics respond erratically to the scale of the drawing while stress behaves predictably . In many settings it is desirable to evaluate a drawing based on how well the graph structure is captured in the layout. Such quality metrics 8 capture how well a particular drawing represents the structure present in the abstract graph data.\nThe most popular family of metrics\nof this type is stress.\nMany variants of stress exist, and we describe several of them in Section 3.\nA drawing with low stress implies that the Euclidean distance between any two vertices in the drawing is close to the corresponding graph-theoretic distance between them.\nHuman-subject experiments investigating the geometric properties of graph drawings show that people prefer graph drawings with lower stress 2. The notion of stress originates from the field of statistical analysis, where it is used as a dimension reduction (DR) technique. The class of dimension reduction algorithms that directly optimize stress are known as Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), of which there are dozens of variants; see  [ref]6 . Confusingly, there are three main classes of distance-based DR techniques known as MDS sometimes used interchangeably. We use the following definitions: Classical MDS  was proposed by Torgerson and is the earliest method. It makes assumptions that the distances are obtained from a Euclidean vector space which allows a closed-form solution to be derived. Given the similarity matrix B𝐵B, the closed-form solution of X𝑋X where X=Λ1/2​V′𝑋superscriptΛ12superscript𝑉′X=\\Lambda^{1/2}V^{\\prime} can be found from the eigenvalue decomposition of B𝐵B such that B=V​Λ​V′𝐵𝑉Λsuperscript𝑉′B=V\\Lambda V^{\\prime}. While very consistent, the visual quality of Classical MDS for graph drawing is generally quite poor, but its closed form solution makes it a nice initialization for other drawing methods  2. Metric MDS 9 was later proposed by Shepard as a generalization of Classical MDS. Here, Equation 1 is modeled as a differentiable equation in the coordinates and gradient-based approaches can be applied to optimize it. This variant is the most widely used in graph drawing, starting with Kamada and Kawai 0, followed by Gansner et al. 4 and Zheng et al. [ref]49. Non-Metric MDS 4 is interested in both finding an embedding of the points in low dimensional space, and a non-parametric relationship between them. At each step of the algorithm, a monotonic curve of best fit must be found in the drawing’s Shepard diagram, a plot with embedded distances on the x-axis and high dimensional distances on the y-axis. The smaller the horizontal distances between the curve and points of the diagram are, the better the quality of the embedding is.\nInstead of exact distances, this variant only attempts to preserve the ranks between points. To the best of our knowledge, this variant has not yet been applied to graph layouts. Graph Drawing by Minimizing Stress: In 1989, Kamada and Kawai 0 proposed an algorithm that attempts to match the Euclidean distances in the layout to the abstract graph-theoretic distances.\nCohen 3 built on Kamada and Kawai’s work by creating an incremental approach where successively larger portions of the graph are arranged based on KK stress.\nGansner et al. 4 adapted stress majorization, a technique already known in the MDS community, to improve the optimization process.\nStress computation can be expensive for large graphs since it relies on an all-pairs-shortest-path algorithm  7. Hence Gansner et al.  adapted the stress definition to emphasize only adjacent vertices and introduced an entropy component.\nLater, Gansner et al.  reformulated stress using the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian to provide a scalable sparse representation. Optimizing stress has also been useful when optimizing other aesthetic criteria.\nHuang et al.  show that the inclusion of multiple aesthetic criteria can lead to increased effectiveness and understanding of the resulting visualizations.\nDevkota et al.  use stress optimization for better optimization of edge crossings and crossing angles in their Stress-Plus-X (SPX) algorithm. Wang et al.  reformulate the stress function to impose constraints on both the edge vectors and lengths, which enables them to model many layout constraints.\nSimultaneous, multi-criteria optimization, has been generalized to a broader set of aesthetic criteria, including neighborhood preservation, ideal edge lengths, vertex resolution, angular resolution, and aspect ratio in (G​D)2superscript𝐺𝐷2(GD)^{2} (Graph Drawing via Gradient Descent) . Zheng et al. [ref]49 showed that stochastic gradient descent is effective for stress optimization and\nBörsig et al.   confirm these results, showing that it produces high-quality results and is indifferent to initialization conditions.\nMulticriteria Scalable Graph Drawing via Stochastic Gradient Descent, (S​G​D)2superscript𝑆𝐺𝐷2(SGD)^{2}, builds on these results . Stress-based evaluations: Stress is widely used to measure the quality of a network layout.\nXue et al.  and Hong et al.  use normalized stress as an evaluation metric.\nStress is also used to evaluate dynamic graph layouts  .\nRecently, Di Bartolomeo et al.  reviewed the graph drawing literature and provided a list of standard approaches to evaluate graph layout algorithms. According to their study of 100+ articles, stress is the third most frequently used evaluation metric after running time and number of crossings. Initially, raw stress was defined to measure the quality of the embedding [ref]6. It was observed that raw stress score varies if the layout is resized [ref]6. Normalized stress   4 6 3 was proposed to address this issue, but as we will show, it also suffers from problems with a change in scale.\nSeveral other variants of stress are also proposed including resizing multiple layouts to the same window 3, scaling the graph distances so that the layout distance is proportional to graph distance 0, etc. With this in mind, we describe several such variants in the following sections and show the impact of scale.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: reduction (DR) technique.
