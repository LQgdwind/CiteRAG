      "content": "Paper Title: Artificial Intelligence for Complex Network: Potential, Methodology and Application\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAccording to the classification of AI tasks, we classify applications into three categories, including prediction, simulation, and decision-making & control. Prediction. Prediction is one of the most important applications in complex society networks. Current studies have designed various prediction targets, e.g., fake news and accounts , information propagation , critical link prediction  [ref]130 and friendship prediction , etc. Specifically, the task of information propagation aims to predict the number of users who have known an information item from the macroscopic perspective or to predict the next user who will know the item in the microscopic view . Therefore, how to utilize multi-scale information, at both macroscopic and microscopic levels, is the core of this long-standing problem in the current stage. For example, Yang et al.  propose a full-scale diffusion prediction model with RL modeling the macroscopic diffusion size information and RNN capturing microscopic diffusion target. Ji et al.  develop a community-based graph learning method, which explicitly captures information propagation. Friendship prediction, also known as social recommendations, is to predict whether two users share a social relation between them . Currently, Zhang et al.  also attend to co-evolving community dynamics and propose an attention-based GNN model to achieve better performance in the task of friendship prediction. Researchers also mine social network structures to boost tasks that are traditionally believed to be unrelated to networks . For example, Wu et al.  consider the degrees of news article nodes and propose a graph-learning method for fake news detection. Besides social networks, researchers also frame various prediction tasks on scientific collaboration networks  and supply chain networks [ref]130. For exmample, Zhang et al.  predict the links between entities from different sources in the Microsoft Academic Graph. Li et al. [ref]130 utilize spatial-temporal knowledge graphs of the supply chain to predict links among Small and Medium-sized Enterprises. Overall, prediction is the most fundamental task in complex society networks. Recent studies on prediction mainly focus on (i) how to utilize multi-scale information    and (ii) how to model evolving relationship  [ref]130. Further work should consider how to model both of them in a unified framework. Simulation. Simulation on complex society networks has become an emerging field in recent years. Prior studies mainly adopt mechanistic models as the basis and perform agent-based simulations on them . Currently, researchers adopt a data-driven approach to better capture social dynamics . For example, Okawa et al.  leverage the power of sociologically-informed neural networks and neural ordinary differential equations for modeling opinion dynamics. On the other hand, the recent development of large language models (LLM) has also largely empowered the simulation on social networks  . By encoding social mechanisms in natural languages instead of parameters and functions, these LLM-based simulations can reproduce human social behaviors in a more fine-grained manner  . To sum up, the recent development of AI empowers simulation methods with (i) the capability to learn real-world dynamics from data and (ii) the capability to make agents more similar to human beings. Future work should consider combining these two directions together, that is, adopting real-world dynamics to generate reliable dynamical trajectories and using LLM to enrich these trajectories. Decision-making and control. Decision-making and controlling is also one ultimate target for studying complex society networks [ref]55 [ref]28 . Recent work mainly focuses on two tasks: (i) Network dismantling, removing certain nodes or edges to destroy social functionalities of complex networks [ref]55 and (ii) influence maximization, selecting certain nodes or edges as the seed and maximizing the final information [ref]28 . For example, Fan et al. [ref]55 introduce an RL-based framework for finding key nodes in the 9/11 terrorist networks. Chen et al. [ref]28 also leverage the power of RL to find a subset of seed nodes to maximize the information spread. Focusing on the influence maximization task, Ling et al.  point out the difficulties of diffusion pattern modeling and objective function solving. They propose a framework with autoencoders for modeling seed node sets, a diffusion model for capturing information spread patterns, and an objective function for handling node-centrality-constrained scenarios . Due to the heterogeneity of populations and the complexity of human behaviors, decision-making and controlling in complex society networks is a non-trivial task. Though few studies consider these aspects , future work should modeld them in a more fine-grained manner.\n\nReference markers found: [130]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]130: most important applications in complex society networks.
