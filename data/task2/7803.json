      "content": "Paper Title: Finite-valued Streaming String Transducers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFinite-state word transducers are simple devices that allow to reason about data\ntransformations in an effective, and even efficient way. In their most\nbasic form they transform words using finite\ncontrol. Unlike automata, their power heavily depends on various\nparameters, like non-determinism, the capability of scanning the input\nseveral times, or the kind of storage they may use. The oldest\ntransducer model, known as generalized sequential machine,\nextends finite automata by outputs. Inspired by an\napproach that applies to arbitrary relational structures ,\nlogic-based transductions\nwere considered by Engelfriet and\nHoogeboom  and shown to be ”equivalent” to\n”functional” (a.k.a. ”single-valued”) two-way transducers.\nTen years later Alur and Cerný  proposed\n”streaming string transducers” (”SST”), a one-way model that uses\nwrite-only registers as additional storage. Registers can be updated\nby appending or prepending strings, or concatenated, but not\nduplicated (they are copyless).\nThey showed that ”SSTs” are ”equivalent” to the model studied\nby  in the ”functional” case.\nThese ”equivalences” support\nthus the notion of “regular” word functions, in the spirit of\nclassical results on regular word languages from automata theory\nand logics due to Büchi, Elgot,\nTrakhtenbrot, Rabin, and others. In the non-”functional” case the picture is less satisfactory,\nas ”equivalence” only holds between ”SSTs”\nand non-deterministic MSO transductions [ref]5,\nwhich extend the original MSO transductions\nby existentially quantified monadic\nparameters.\nOn the other hand, two-way transducers and\n”SSTs” become incomparable.\nMoreover, the ”equivalence problem” for the\nnon-deterministic models is undecidable, even for\none-way transducers 2 8.\nThere is however a class of relations that is almost\nas nice as (regular) word functions: this is\nthe class of ”finite-valued” relations,\nnamely, relations that associate a uniformly bounded\nnumber of ”outputs” with each ”input”. Let n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N} and consider the relation E.g. (001011,00),(001011,10),(001011,11)∈R2001011000010111000101111subscript𝑅2(001011,00),(001011,10),(001011,11)\\in R_{2}. For all n𝑛n, the relation Rnsubscript𝑅𝑛R_{n} is\n2nsuperscript2𝑛2^{n}-valued and realizable by a (one-way) finite transducer\nTnsubscript𝑇𝑛T_{n}, which uses non-determinism to guess an index\ni∈{1,…,k}𝑖1…𝑘i\\in\\{1,\\dots,k\\}. It keeps on reading its ”input”\n(in successive rounds of length n𝑛n to read the\nbit-vectors v¯1,…,v¯i−1subscript¯𝑣1…subscript¯𝑣𝑖1\\bar{v}_{1},\\dots,\\bar{v}_{i-1}) while\noutputting nothing, until it non-deterministically\ndecides to output v¯isubscript¯𝑣𝑖\\bar{v}_{i} in n𝑛n\nsuccessive steps, and then keeps on reading the\nremaining v¯i+1,…,v¯ksubscript¯𝑣𝑖1…subscript¯𝑣𝑘\\bar{v}_{i+1},\\dots,\\bar{v}_{k} while\noutputting nothing, and accepts. The transducer Tnsubscript𝑇𝑛T_{n} has O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n)\nstates and the number of ”accepting” ”runs” per ”input” is unbounded\nbecause k𝑘k is arbitrary and if v¯x=v¯ysubscript¯𝑣𝑥subscript¯𝑣𝑦\\bar{v}_{x}=\\bar{v}_{y}\nfor some x<y𝑥𝑦x<y, then this accounts for two ”accepting” ”runs”\nand a single ”output”. The\n”ambiguity” can be bounded, but at the cost of an exponential\nblow-up, for instance by making the transducer initially guess a word\nv¯∈{0,1}n¯𝑣superscript01𝑛\\overline{v}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n} (stored in memory), output it, and then verify\nv¯=vi¯¯𝑣¯subscript𝑣𝑖\\overline{v}=\\overline{v_{i}} for some 1≤i≤k1𝑖𝑘1\\leq i\\leq k.\n ”Finite-valued” transductions were intensively studied in the setting of\none-way transducers. In addition to the fact that finite-valued\none-way transducers are exponentially more succinct than\ntheir ”finitely-ambiguous” counterpart, as illustrated by\nExample 1, one of the main advantages of this class is the decidability of the\n”equivalence problem” .111 states that\ntheir proof works for two-way transducers as well.\nInspired by  the ”equivalence problem” for ”k𝑘k-valued” ”SSTs”\nwas shown to be decidable\nin .\nHowever both results rely on the Ehrenfeucht\nconjecture  3 and therefore provide no elementary\nupper bounds. For one-way transducers and for a fixed k𝑘k,\nbeing ”k𝑘k-valued” can be checked in PTime 6.\nIt is also known that\nevery ”k𝑘k-valued” one-way transducer can be effectively decomposed into\na union of k𝑘k ”unambiguous” one-way transducers of exponential\nsize   . For both two-way transducers and ”SSTs”,\nchecking ”k𝑘k-valuedness” for fixed k𝑘k is a PSpace problem (see\ne.g. [ref]5 for ”SSTs”).\nDecomposing ”finite-valued” ”SSTs” and deciding\nfinite-valuedness for ”SSTs” were listed as open problems\nin [ref]5, more than 10 years back.\nCompared to one-way finite transducers, new challenges arise with\nSSTs, due to the extra power they enjoy to produce\n”outputs”. For example over the alphabet Σ={0,1}Σ01\\Sigma=\\{0,1\\}, consider the set of pairs\n(w,0n0​1n1)𝑤superscript0subscript𝑛0superscript1subscript𝑛1(w,0^{n_{0}}1^{n_{1}}) and (w,1n1​0n0)𝑤superscript1subscript𝑛1superscript0subscript𝑛0(w,1^{n_{1}}0^{n_{0}}), where w∈Σ∗𝑤superscriptΣw\\in\\Sigma^{*} and\nnbsubscript𝑛𝑏n_{b} is the number of\nbits b∈{0,1}𝑏01b\\in\\{0,1\\} in w𝑤w.\nThe ”outputs” are essentially the\nconcatenated numbers of 00\nand 111, in unary, and in any order. This transduction is ”222-valued”,\nbut not realizable by any one-way finite transducer.\nHowever, the following single-state ”SST” T𝑇T with 2\nregisters X0,X1subscript𝑋0subscript𝑋1X_{0},X_{1} (both initially empty) realizes it: whenever it reads b∈{0,1}𝑏01b\\in\\{0,1\\},\nit non-deterministically does the ”update” Xb:=b​Xbassignsubscript𝑋𝑏𝑏subscript𝑋𝑏X_{b}:=bX_{b} or Xb:=Xb​bassignsubscript𝑋𝑏subscript𝑋𝑏𝑏X_{b}:=X_{b}b (while X1−bsubscript𝑋1𝑏X_{1-b} is unchanged), and eventually ”outputs” either\nX0​X1subscript𝑋0subscript𝑋1X_{0}X_{1} or X1​X0subscript𝑋1subscript𝑋0X_{1}X_{0}. The ability of ”SSTs” to generate ”outputs” non-linearly makes their study challenging. To\nillustrate this, consider the following slight modification of T𝑇T: X0subscript𝑋0X_{0} is\ninitialized with 111 instead of the empty word. The resulting SST is not finite-valued anymore, because\non reading 0nsuperscript0𝑛0^{n}, it would output\n0ℓ​10msuperscript0ℓsuperscript10𝑚0^{\\ell}10^{m} for all ℓ,mℓ𝑚\\ell,m such that ℓ+m=nℓ𝑚𝑛\\ell+m=n. Another open problem was the relationship between ”SSTs” and two-way\ntransducers in the finite-valued case.\nIt is not hard to see that the standard translation from deterministic\ntwo-way transducers to ”deterministic” ”SSTs” also applies to the\n”finite-valued” case, see the proof of Theorem 2 below.\nThe converse translation however is far more complicated and relies on\na decomposition theorem for ”SSTs”, which we establish here. The results presented in this paper draw a\nrather complete picture about\n”finite-valued” ”SSTs”, answering several open problems from [ref]5.\nFirst, we show that ”k𝑘k-valued” ”SSTs” enjoy the same decomposition property as\none-way transducers: For all k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N},\nevery k𝑘k-valued ”SST” can be decomposed into a union of\nk𝑘k ”single-valued” (or even ”deterministic”) ”SSTs”.\nThe complexity of the construction is elementary. An important consequence of the above theorem is the ”equivalence” of\n”SSTs” and two-way transducers in the ”finite-valued” setting: Let R⊆Σ∗×Σ∗𝑅superscriptΣsuperscriptΣR\\subseteq\\Sigma^{*}\\times\\Sigma^{*} be a ”finite-valued” relation.\nIf R𝑅R can be realized by an ”SST”, then an ”equivalent” two-way\ntransducer can be effectively constructed, and vice-versa. A second consequence of Theorem 1\nis an elementary upper bound for the\n”equivalence problem” of ”finite-valued”\n”SSTs” : The ”equivalence problem” for ”k𝑘k-valued” ”SSTs” can be solved with\nelementary complexity. Given two ”k𝑘k-valued” ”SSTs” T,T′𝑇superscript𝑇′T,T^{\\prime}, we first decompose them into\nunions of k𝑘k\n”single-valued” ”SSTs” T1,…,Tksubscript𝑇1…subscript𝑇𝑘T_{1},\\dots,T_{k} and T1′,…,Tk′subscriptsuperscript𝑇′1…subscriptsuperscript𝑇′𝑘T^{\\prime}_{1},\\dots,T^{\\prime}_{k},\nrespectively.\nBy  we can even assume that every\nTisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} and Tj′subscriptsuperscript𝑇′𝑗T^{\\prime}_{j} is a ”deterministic” ”SST”.\nFinally, [5, Theorem 4.4] shows how to check the\n”equivalence” of ⋃i=1kTisuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑘subscript𝑇𝑖\\bigcup_{i=1}^{k}T_{i} and ⋃i=1kTi′superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝑇′𝑖\\bigcup_{i=1}^{k}T^{\\prime}_{i} in PSpace.\n∎ Our last, and main, contribution is to establish the decidability\nof ”finite valuedness” for ”SSTs”: Given any ”SST” T𝑇T, we can decide in PSpace if T𝑇T is\n”finite-valued”, and in PTime if the number of variables\nis fixed. Moreover, this problem is at least as hard as the\n”equivalence problem” for ”deterministic” ”SSTs”. This last result is the most technical one, and requires to reason\non particular substructures (”W-patterns”) of ”SSTs”.\nSuch substructures have been already used for one-way transducers, but for ”SSTs” genuine challenges\narise.\nThe starting point of our proof is a\nrecent result allowing to determine if two runs of\nan ”SST” are\nfar apart 0.\nThe proof then relies on identifying suitable patterns and\nextending techniques from word combinatorics to more involved\nword inequalities. Based on the ”equivalence” between ”SSTs” and two-way transducers in the\n”finite-valued” setting (Theorem 2), and the\ndecidability of ”finite valuedness” for ”SST”\n(Theorem 4), we exhibit\nan alternative proof for the following (known)\nresult: Finite-valuedness of two-way transducers is decidable in PSpace. Observe also that without the results in this paper, the result\nof  could not help to show\nTheorem 4, because\nonly the\nconversion of ”finite-valued” two-way transducers into ”finite-valued” ”SSTs” was\nknown (under the assumption that any input positions is visited a\nbounded number of times), but not the other way around. Finally note that Theorem 1\n(and Theorem 2)\nalso provides a\ndecomposition result for ”finite-valued” two-way transducers. We also observe that since ”SSTs” and non-deterministic MSO\ntransductions are equivalent [ref]5,\nTheorem 4 entails decidability of\n”finite valuedness” for non-deterministic MSO\ntransductions as well. Moreover, since in the ”single-valued” case,\n”deterministic” ”SSTs”\nand MSO transductions are also equivalent ,\nTheorem 1 implies a decomposition result for MSO\ntransductions: any ”k𝑘k-valued” non-deterministic MSO transduction\ncan be decomposed as a union of k𝑘k (deterministic) MSO\ntransductions. Finally, from Theorem 2, we\nalso get that under the assumption of ”finite valuedness”,\nnon-deterministic MSO transductions, two-way\ntransducers and ”SST” are equally expressive.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: to Büchi, Elgot,\nTrakhtenbrot, Rabin, and others.
