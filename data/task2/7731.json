      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum algorithms to simulate quadratic classical Hamiltonians and optimal control\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhen implementing quantum algorithms to solve linear ODEs of the form It was shown in [ref]25 that the gate complexity depends on the norm of the exponential of the matrix A𝐴A i.e., it depends on where T𝑇T is the time to which we need to simulate the dynamics. Here, we prove some bounds on this norm when A𝐴A is a block 2×2222\\times 2 matrix as is the case in all our applications here. We first consider the case when F0=0subscript𝐹00F_{0}=0. Suppose Then we have where Split the matrix A𝐴A as follows where A1subscript𝐴1A_{1} contains the dissipative part of the evolution and A2subscript𝐴2A_{2} contains the nonlinear term. From the definition in (3.21) above, we see that C​(A1)=Cd𝐶subscript𝐴1subscript𝐶𝑑C(A_{1})=C_{d}. Now using Dyson’s formula ( or ), we have We can define a recursive version of this by using the formula to define exp⁡(A​s)𝐴𝑠\\exp(As). We get (see ) where and U0​(t)=exp⁡(A1​t)subscript𝑈0𝑡subscript𝐴1𝑡U_{0}(t)=\\exp(A_{1}t). It turns out that in our case, Un=0subscript𝑈𝑛0U_{n}=0 for n≥2𝑛2n\\geq 2. To see this, note that since A1subscript𝐴1A_{1} is a block diagonal matrix and A2subscript𝐴2A_{2} is a strictly lower triangular block matrix. Therefore, we have Taking norms, we get where we have used (3.21) and the fact that ‖A2‖≤‖F2‖normsubscript𝐴2normsubscript𝐹2\\|A_{2}\\|\\leq\\|F_{2}\\|.\n∎ Note that we get a similar result when F2=0subscript𝐹20F_{2}=0 instead of F0subscript𝐹0F_{0}. We now show a weaker result when both F2subscript𝐹2F_{2} and F0subscript𝐹0F_{0} are non-zero. Assume that F0≠0subscript𝐹00F_{0}\\neq 0 and F2≠0subscript𝐹20F_{2}\\neq 0. Also assume that Then we have As before, split A𝐴A as follows we have that A1subscript𝐴1A_{1} contains the dissipative part of the evolution and A2subscript𝐴2A_{2} contains the nonlinear and constant terms. From , for any two matrices B𝐵B and E𝐸E if ‖exp⁡(B​s)‖≤exp⁡(β​s)norm𝐵𝑠𝛽𝑠\\|\\exp(Bs)\\|\\leq\\exp(\\beta s), then We now use the fact that ‖exp⁡(A1​t)‖≤exp⁡(μ​t)normsubscript𝐴1𝑡𝜇𝑡\\|\\exp(A_{1}t)\\|\\leq\\exp(\\mu t), where μ𝜇\\mu is the log norm of A1subscript𝐴1A_{1}. Using this, we see that ∎ In order to have C​(A)𝐶𝐴C(A) be polynomially bounded i.e., C​(A)=poly⁡(n)𝐶𝐴poly𝑛C(A)=\\operatorname{poly}(n), we need for some k𝑘k for all t∈[0,T]𝑡0𝑇t\\in[0,T]. If μ+‖F0‖+‖F2‖>0𝜇normsubscript𝐹0normsubscript𝐹20\\mu+\\|F_{0}\\|+\\|F_{2}\\|>0, then we need If μ+‖F0‖+‖F2‖<0𝜇normsubscript𝐹0normsubscript𝐹20\\mu+\\|F_{0}\\|+\\|F_{2}\\|<0, then the condition in (3.34) is satisfied already. We compare the above quantity to R𝑅R, which was defined in [ref]34 (see also [ref]25 for a generalized version) as follows. where μ𝜇\\mu is the log norm of F1subscript𝐹1F_{1}, which is assumed to be negative and ‖ui​n‖normsubscript𝑢𝑖𝑛\\|u_{in}\\| is the norm of the initial state. This means we need to re-define F0subscript𝐹0F_{0} and F2subscript𝐹2F_{2} as F0¯=F0/‖ui​n‖¯subscript𝐹0subscript𝐹0normsubscript𝑢𝑖𝑛\\bar{F_{0}}=F_{0}/\\|u_{in}\\| and F2¯=‖ui​n‖​F2¯subscript𝐹2normsubscript𝑢𝑖𝑛subscript𝐹2\\bar{F_{2}}=\\|u_{in}\\|F_{2}. The requirement that R<1𝑅1R<1 (by Carleman linearization) is equivalent to In contrast, here we need (from (3.35)) which grows logarithmically in n𝑛n, which is the number of bits needed to encode the problem i.e., n=log⁡N𝑛𝑁n=\\log N. The condition (3.38) is more general than (and includes) (3.37). In many cases, it can lead to more nonlinearity and even positive log-norm μ𝜇\\mu. When μ​(A1)<0𝜇subscript𝐴10\\mu(A_{1})<0 and F0=0subscript𝐹00F_{0}=0, we have an even weaker constraint on the nonlinearity. From (3.28), we have since Cd≤1subscript𝐶𝑑1C_{d}\\leq 1. This means that the strength of the nonlinear term can be as large as poly⁡(n)/Tpoly𝑛𝑇\\operatorname{poly}(n)/T.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: When implementing quantum algorithms to solve linear ODEs of the form It was shown in [ref]25 that the gate complexity depends on the norm of the exponential of the matrix A𝐴A i.e., it depends on where T𝑇T is the time to which we need to simulate the dynamics.
