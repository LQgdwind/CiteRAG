      "content": "Paper Title: G-TADOC: Enabling Efficient GPU-Based Text Analytics without Decompression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe show our experimental setup in this part. Methodology.\nThe baseline in our evaluation is TADOC ,\nwhich is the state-of-the-art data analytics directly on compression, denoted as “TADOC”.\nOur method that enables TADOC on GPUs is denoted as “G-TADOC”.\nIn our evaluation,\nwe measure TADOC  performance and G-TADOC performance for comparison.\n\nMoreover, we assume that small datasets can be stored and processed in GPU memory directly without PCIe data transmission; large datasets are stored on disk with PCIe data transmission required to be involved in time measurement. Platforms.\nWe use three GPU platforms and a 10-node Amazon EC2 cluster in our evaluation, as shown in Table I.\nWe evaluate G-TADOC on\nthree generations of Nvidia GPUs (Pascal, Volta, and Turing micro-architectures),\nwhich are used to prove the adaptability of G-TADOC.\n\nSince GPU architectures are constantly changing,\nif we can achieve high performance on all these platforms,\nthen it is very likely that G-TADOC can achieve promising results for future GPU products.\n\nThe 10-node cluster is a Spark cluster on Amazon EC2  for large datasets of TADOC. Datasets.\nThe datasets used in our evaluation are shown in Table II,\nwhich include various real-world workloads.\n\nDatasets A, B, and C are used in   [ref]3 .\n\nDataset A is NSF Research Award Abstracts (NSFRAA) downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository 7, and is composed of a large number of small files.\nDataset B is a collection of four web documents downloaded from Wikipedia 5.\nDataset C is a large Wikipedia dataset 5.\n\nTo increase the diversity of test data,\nwe add datasets D and E compared to previous works   [ref]3 .\nDataset D is COVID-19 data from Yelp 8,\nand dataset E is a collection of DBLP web documents 9.\n\n\nNote that only dataset C is evaluated on the 10-node cluster.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: on Amazon EC2  for large datasets of TADOC. Datasets.\nThe datasets used in our evaluation are shown in Table II,\nwhich include various real-world workloads.\n\nDatasets A, B, and C are used in   [ref]3 .\n\nDataset A is NSF Research Award Abstracts (NSFRAA) downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository 7, and is composed of a large number of small files.\nDataset B is a collection of four web\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
