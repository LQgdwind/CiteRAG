I. For the DVS128 dataset, we utilize the same network structure and hyper-parameters as the  and add the TCJA module before the last two pooling layers. Dropout (DP)  rate is set to 0.5 in accordance with the original network. We add a 1-D average pooling voting layer in the last layer, which yielded a 10-dimensional vector as the vote outcome. This is because the preprocess of DVS128 Gesture simulates a longer timestep (TùëáT=20), through such a voting layer the robustness of the network can be improved [ref]11. For the CIFAR10-DVS dataset, we adopt the VGG11-like architecture introduced in TET . Due to the significant overfitting, we adopt the data augmentation as [ref]32 and . To maintain the same training settings as  for TCJA-TET-SNN, we use the triangle surrogate function, eliminate the last LIF layer, and replace the SMSE loss with TET loss. For TCJA-SNN, the TCJA module is added before the last two pooling layers, and for TCJA-TET-SNN, the TCJA module is included before the first pooling layer as the replacement of surrogate function and loss. For N-Caltech 101 dataset, we combine two architectures together and add the TCJA module before the last two pooling layers. We first reserve a pooling for each layer; then, with the network going deeper, spatial resolution is reduced with the increasing channel number. To relieve the evident overfitting, the ratio of the first dropout layer is increased to 0.8. For the Fashion-MNIST dataset, we follow the network structure from . Note that the first convolutional layer is a static encoding layer, transforming the static image into spikes.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: vector as the vote outcome.
