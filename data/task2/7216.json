      "content": "Paper Title: Fully Spiking Actor Network with Intra-layer Connections for Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, guided by the brain, neuromorphic computing has emerged as one of the most promising types of computing architecture, which could realize energy-efficient AI through spike-driven communication   . The research efforts of neuromorphic computing not only facilitate the emergence of large-scale neuromorphic chips   , but also promote the development of SNNs [ref]7 [ref]8 . In this context, the field of neuromorphic computing is a close cooperation organic whole between hardware and algorithm. An accumulating body of research studies shows that SNNs can be used as energy-efficient solutions for robot control tasks with limited on-board energy resources 0 1 2. To overcome the limitations of SNNs in solving high-dimensional control problems, it would be natural to combine the energy-efficiency of SNNs with the optimality of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which has been proven effective in extensive control tasks 3 4. Since rewards are regarded as the training guidance in reinforcement learning (RL), several works 5 6 employ reward-based learning using three-factor learning rules. However, these methods only apply to shallow SNNs and low-dimensional control tasks, or require manual tuning of the network architecture and numerous hyper-parameters related to neurons and synapses for each scenario 7. Besides, the surrogate gradient method 8 provides a promising way to train deep SNNs. In a typical control task, the agent needs to learn multi-dimensional deterministic policies. In the deterministic policy learning, the RL methods 9 0 1 often utilize the actor-critic framework, where the actor network maps the state to the continuous action space and the critic network is used to represent state-action value (i.e., Q-value). Note that the critic network is just used for training, and only the actor network is deployed on the hardware of the application, hence it is necessary to develop a spiking actor network (SAN) as the energy-efficient solution for control tasks. Such network structure includes a deep critic network and a SAN, also known as the hybrid framework. However, the existing methods based on hybrid framework 2 3 take the firing rate111 It should be noted that the firing rate mentioned here and later refers to the ratio of the number of spikes to the discrete simulation time. as the output of SNNs, and convert it to represent continuous action space (i.e., the deterministic policy) through a fully-connected (FC) layer, which bring the floating-point matrix operations to the FC layer, making the whole SNN unable to deploy on the neuromorphic hardware directly. To develop a fully spiking actor network which could be deployed on neuromorphic chips without any floating-point matrix operations, the key issue is to design a novel neural coding method to decode the spike-train into the continuous value in RL algorithms, such as value estimate or continuous action space, realizing end-to-end spike-based RL. In nature, sensory neurons receive information from the external environment and transmit it to non-spiking interneurons through action potentials 4, and then change the membrane voltage of motor neurons through graded signals to achieve effective locomotion. As a translational unit, non-spiking interneurons could affect the motor output according to the sensory input. Inspired by biological research on sensorimotor neuron path, we propose a novel neural coding method to train SNNs for continuous control, where the membrane voltage of non-spiking neurons is used to represent the continuous value in RL algorithms. As shown in Fig. 1, the SNN receives the state from the environment and encodes them as spike-train by spiking neurons. Then, the non-spiking neurons are subsequently introduced to calculate the membrane voltage from the spike-train, which is further used to select the specific action to be performed. Finally, the agent controls the motor to adjust the motion according to the action. In addition to the membrane voltage coding method, we also integrate the intra-layer connections into the output populations to learn better action representation. The intra-layer connections mainly contain self connections and lateral connections, which widely exist in various brain areas 5. This mechanism can cause generalization across actions 5 and retain the information in the neuron population 6, which is applied to the neuron population encoding the same action dimension. Therefore, we propose a fully spiking actor network with intra-layer connections, named ILC-SAN, which is a novel method based on hybrid framework. The experiment results show that our method achieves the start-of-the-art performance on OpenAI gym tasks. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: A novel coding method to decode the spike-train for RL algorithms is proposed, which could represent the continuous value by the membrane voltage of non-spiking neurons. The method could be integrated into any RL algorithms, realizing end-to-end spike-based RL. The results of the experiment show that optimal performance could be achieved using the last membrane voltage of non-leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. A novel intra-layer connection mechanism is proposed, which has been proved by experiments that it can effectively improve the representation capacity of the output populations. A novel spiking actor network (ILC-SAN) is proposed. To our best knowledge, our ILC-SAN is the first fully spiking neural network to achieve the same level of performance as the mainstream DRL algorithms, which ensures that all matrix operations can be completed on the neuromorphic hardware after deploying the trained actor network. The evaluation of continuous control tasks from OpenAI gym demonstrates the effectiveness of ILC-SAN in performance and energy efficiency. Under the same experimental configurations, our ILC-SAN achieves the start-of-the-art performance.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: through spike-driven communication   .
