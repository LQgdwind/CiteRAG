      "content": "Paper Title: kTrans: Knowledge-Aware Transformer for Binary Code Embedding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis type of approaches automates the process of generating embeddings for binary code via representation learning, which learn features automatically from data, avoiding biases introduced by manual feature engineering. This type of approaches can be divided into several categories based on the underlying learning algorithms they employ: RNN-based: Methods like SAFE¬†[ref]35 uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model binary code sequences. RNN-based methods, such as LSTMs¬†[ref]20 and GRUs¬†[ref]9, can capture sequential dependencies in the data and are well-suited for modeling variable-length binary code sequences. However, RNNs may suffer from vanishing gradient issues when processing long sequences, limiting their ability to model long-range dependencies. CNN-based: Methods such as Œ±ùõº\\alphadiff¬† use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to model local patterns and relationships in the binary code. CNNs can capture spatial and hierarchical information using convolutional layers and pooling operations. However, CNNs may not be as effective in modeling sequential dependencies and long-range relationships in the binary code as RNNs or Transformers. GNN-based: Graph neural network (GNN) based methods, such as Gemini¬† and VulSeeker¬†, model binary code using graph representations, such as control flow graphs (CFGs) and data flow graphs (DFGs). GNNs can capture complex relationships and dependencies between different parts of the binary code by processing graph-structured data. However, GNNs may require additional preprocessing steps to extract graph representations from binary code and can be computationally expensive for large graphs. Transformer-based binary code embedding methods leverage the powerful self-attention mechanism present in Transformers, which allows them to capture long-range dependencies and complex patterns in the binary code. Examples of Transformer-based methods include PalmTree¬†, jTrans¬†, and COMBO¬†. These methods often employ pretraining-finetuning paradigms, which enable them to learn general-purpose binary code representations from large-scale, unlabeled data and then fine-tune these representations for specific binary code analysis tasks. Some of the key advantages of Transformer-based methods over non-Transformer-based methods include: Improved modeling of long-range dependencies: Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to model relationships between all pairs of tokens in the input sequence, allowing them to capture long-range dependencies more effectively than RNNs or CNNs. Scalability: Transformers can process input sequences in parallel, making them more computationally efficient and scalable compared to RNNs, which require sequential processing. Transfer learning: Transformer-based methods often employ transfer-learning paradigms such as pretraining-finetuning, which enable them to leverage large-scale, unlabeled data to learn general-purpose binary code representations and improve performance on specific binary code analysis tasks. However, Transformer-based binary code embedding methods also face some challenges: Computational complexity: Although Transformers can process input sequences in parallel, their self-attention mechanism has quadratic complexity with respect to the sequence length, making them computationally expensive for long sequences. This can be mitigated to some extent using techniques like sparse attention or local attention. Prior knowledge incorporation: Most Transformer-based approaches treat binary code as natural language and directly apply language models to assembly language. This may overlook the prior knowledge inherent in binary code, such as opcode types, operand types, etc. Comprehending instructions: Many Transformer-based approaches lack a clear understanding of instruction boundaries, which may hinder their ability to model program execution behavior. Some methods, like PalmTree, require users to provide instruction boundaries, while others, like BinBert¬†, lack information about instruction boundaries altogether. In summary, binary code embedding plays a crucial role in improving the performance of various binary code analysis tasks. While manual binary code embedding methods have certain limitations, learning-based binary code embedding methods, both non-Transformer-based and Transformer-based, have shown great promise in better capturing the structure and semantics of binary code. Continued research and development in this area can lead to more effective and comprehensive binary code embedding methods that can address the challenges and limitations of existing approaches. In this work, to address these challenges and develop comprehensive embedding methods, we focus on incorporating prior knowledge of binary code, improving instruction understanding, and modeling implicit dependencies.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: biases introduced by manual feature engineering.
