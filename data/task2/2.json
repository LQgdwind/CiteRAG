      "content": "Paper Title: Learning and Memorizing Representative Prototypes for 3D Point Cloud Semantic and Instance Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe recent development of rapid and practical 3D sensors has provided easier ways to acquire 3D point cloud data, one of the widely used types of geometric data due to its simplicity .\n3D scene understanding is critically important and fundamental for various applications, such as robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual reality. The core tasks include semantic segmentation and instance segmentation on point clouds, i.e. assigning semantic labels and instance indication label for each point, respectively. Comparing to the studies on 2D images   , semantic and instance on 3D point clouds lags far behind and have just started recently 5 6  [ref]40  . Based on the pioneering works PointNet  and PointNet++ 5, directly processing point sets becomes simpler, more memory-efficient and flexible than handling the volumetric grids with 3D convolution   .\nSome following approaches 5 6 [ref]40  propose to handle semantic and instance segmentation in an end-to-end network jointly for fine-grained description of the scene.\nSpecifically, discriminative instance embeddings are learned to measure the instance-level clustering patterns of the points 6 2. Although existing methods have achieved some impressive results, we still can observe performance bottlenecks on different benchmark datasets  , especially on the non-dominant classes with less samples (see Figure 5).\nSuffering from the catastrophic forgetting issue 0 2, deep networks can forget the non-dominant rare cases easily while learning on a dataset distributed off balance and diversely.\nOn point cloud data, imbalance issue usually appears as the category imbalance and pattern imbalance, which is severer than that on 2D images [ref]40.\nFirstly, discrepancy among the proportions of different categories are significant. In an indoor scene (see Figure 1 and 6), most points belong to the background (e.g. ground, ceiling, and wall), whereas the proportions of the objects (e.g. chairs, desks and monitors) are much smaller. For example, in S3DIS , the total amount of ceiling points is 50 times larger than chair.\nSecondly, the patterns of the points are imbalanced and distributed diversely, which are often caused by the complex geometric informations, such as positions, shapes and relative relationships among instances. Some rare instance cases only have limited examples across the whole dataset.\nFor example, chairs are usually placed neatly in a conference room, while can also be placed in arbitrary positions (e.g., stacking and back-to-back) in an office room, as is shown in Figure 1.\nConventional methods [ref]40 ignore this issue or simply resort to the focal loss 7, by down weighing the well learned samples during training.\nHowever, they cannot directly handle the non-dominant patterns, which can be easily overwhelmed and forgotten. To address the above issues, we propose to learn and memorize the discriminative and representative prototypes covering all the samples, which is implemented as a memory-augmented network, referred to as MPNet.\nThe proposed MPNet includes two branches for predicting point-level semantic labels and obtaining per-point embedding for instance grouping, respectively.\nAs shown in Figure 2, the two branches access a shared compact memory via two separate memory readers, which dynamically calibrate the per-point features with the memory items and associate the two tasks via the shared memory.\nGiven an input, MPNet retrieves the most relevant items in the memory for the extracted per-point features and feeds only retrieved features to the following segmentation tasks.\nThus, driven by the task-specific training objectives, the compact memory is pushed to record the representative prototypes seen in mini-batches and associate them with newly seen patterns, alleviating the forgetting issues and strengthening the generalization. In the proposed MPNet, the memory is maintained as a dictionary of the representative features and a semantic summarization, as shown in Figure 2. Since the memory is trained to represent all the instances compactly, the learned prototypes can express a shared understanding of various instances. We observe that the learned memory items (i.e. dictionary bases) can reflect interpretable and meaningful informations, such as position and structure (see Figure 3).\nBenefiting from the associative memory, the rare cases and distorted observations can be augmented by retrieving the stored prototypes, leading to better robustness and generalization.\nAdditionally, different from previous methods relying on either pairwise relations computing 5 or KNN based feature aggregation 6, the proposed MPNet is free from complex and time-consuming operations, which is more efficient. The main contributions are summarized as: We propose a memory-augmented network for point cloud instance segmentation (i.e. MPNet), which is trained to explicitly record the prototypes of the per-point features in a compact memory. The proposed MPNet is more effective and efficient than previous methods. The learned prototypes can consistently represent interpretable and meaningful concepts of various instances, including dominant and non-dominant cases. Our proposed MPNet can boost the performance by a large margin with limited consumptions on computation and memory. State-of-the-art performance is achieved, showing the superiority on both effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: and instance indication label for each point, respectively.
