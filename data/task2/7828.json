      "content": "Paper Title: Practical 0.385-Approximation for Submodular Maximization Subject to a Cardinality Constraint\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the last few years, the ability to effectively summarize data has gained importance due to the advent of massive datasets in many fields. Such summarization often consists of selecting a small representative subset from a large corpus of images, text, movies, etc. Without a specific structure, this task can be as challenging as finding a global minimum of a non-convex function. Fortunately, many practical machine learning problems exhibit some structure, making them suitable for optimization techniques (either exact or approximate). A key structure present in many such problems is submodularity, also known as the principle of diminishing returns. This principle suggests that the incremental value of an element decreases as the set it is added to grows. Submodularity enables the creation of algorithms that can provide near-optimal solutions, making it fundamental in machine learning. It has been successfully applied to various tasks, such as social graph analysis , adversarial attacks  , dictionary learning , data summarization   , interpreting neural networks , robotics  , and many more. To exemplify the notion of submodularity, consider the following task. Given a large dataset, our goal is to identify a subset that effectively summarizes (or covers) the data, with a good representative set being one that covers the majority of the data. Note that adding an element s𝑠s to a set A𝐴A is less beneficial to this goal than adding it to a subset B⊂A𝐵𝐴B\\subset A due to the higher likelihood of overlapping coverage. Formally, if 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N} is the set of elements in the dataset, and we define a function f:2𝒩→ℝ:𝑓→superscript2𝒩ℝf\\colon 2^{\\mathcal{N}}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} mapping every set of elements to its coverage, then, the above discussion implies that, for every two sets A⊆B⊆𝒩𝐴𝐵𝒩A\\subseteq B\\subseteq\\mathcal{N} and element s∈𝒩∖B𝑠𝒩𝐵s\\in\\mathcal{N}\\setminus B, it must hold that f​(s∣A)≥f​(s∣B)𝑓conditional𝑠𝐴𝑓conditional𝑠𝐵f(s\\mid A)\\geq f(s\\mid B), where f​(s∣A)≜f​({s}∪A)−f​(A)≜𝑓conditional𝑠𝐴𝑓𝑠𝐴𝑓𝐴f(s\\mid A)\\triangleq f(\\{s\\}\\cup A)-f(A) denotes the marginal gain of the element s𝑠s to the set A𝐴A. We say that a set function is submodular if it obeys this property. Unfortunately, maximizing submodular functions is NP-hard even without a constraint [ref]14, and therefore, works on maximization of such functions aim for approximations. Many of these works make the extra assumption that the submodular function f:2𝒩→ℝ:𝑓→superscript2𝒩ℝf\\colon 2^{\\mathcal{N}}\\to\\mathbb{R} is monotone, i.e., that for every two sets A⊆B⊆𝒩𝐴𝐵𝒩A\\subseteq B\\subseteq\\mathcal{N}, it holds that f​(B)≥f​(A)𝑓𝐵𝑓𝐴f(B)\\geq f(A). Two of the first works of this kind, by Nemhauser and Wolsey  and Nemhauser et al. , showed that a greedy algorithm achieves a tight 1−1/e11𝑒1-\\nicefrac{{1}}{{e}} approximation for the problem of maximizing a non-negative monotone submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint using O​(n​k)𝑂𝑛𝑘O(nk) function evaluations, where n𝑛n is the size of the ground set 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N} and k𝑘k is the maximum cardinality allowed for the output set. An important line of work aimed to improve over the time complexity of the last algorithm, culminating with various deterministic and randomized algorithms that have managed to reduce the time complexity to linear at the cost of an approximation guarantee that is worse only by a 1−ε1𝜀1-\\varepsilon factor [ref]5    . Unfortunately, the submodular functions that arise in machine learning applications are often non-monotone, either because they are naturally non-monotone, or because a diversity-promoting non-monotone regularizer is added to them.\nMaximizing a non-monotone submodular function is challenging. The only tight approximation known for such functions is for the case of unconstrained maximization, which enjoys a tight approximation ratio of 1/212\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}} [ref]14. A slightly more involved case is the problem of maximizing a non-negative (not necessarily monotone) submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint. This problem has been studied extensively, first, Lee et al.  suggested an algorithm guaranteeing (1/4−ε)14𝜀(1/4-\\varepsilon)-approximation for this problem. This approximation ratio was improved in a long series of works [ref]4   , leading to the very recent 0.4010.4010.401-approximation algorithm of Buchbinder and Feldman , which improved over a previous 0.3850.3850.385-approximation algorithm due to Buchbinder and Feldman . On the inapproximability side, it has been shown that no algorithm can guarantee a better approximation ratio than 0.4780.4780.478 in polynomial time 7. Most of the results in the above-mentioned line of work are only of theoretical interest due to a very high time complexity. The two exceptions are the Random Greedy algorithm of Buchbinder et al. [ref]4 that guarantees 1/e1𝑒\\nicefrac{{1}}{{e}}-approximation using O​(n​k)𝑂𝑛𝑘O(nk) queries to the objective function, and the Sample Greedy algorithm of Buchbinder et al. [ref]5 that reduces the query complexity to Oε​(n)subscript𝑂𝜀𝑛O_{\\varepsilon}(n) at the cost of a slightly worse approximation ratio of 1/e−ε1𝑒𝜀\\nicefrac{{1}}{{e}}-\\varepsilon.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: gain of the element s𝑠s to the set A𝐴A.
