      "content": "Paper Title: P-time Algorithms for Typical #EO Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we study the counting weighted Eulerian orientation problems, denoted as #‚ÄãEO#EO\\#\\textsf{EO}, under the framework of Holant. The variables in Holant and other counting problems are restricted to Boolean domain by default. The framework of Holant is capable of expressing counting weighted graph homomorphisms (#GH), counting constraint satisfaction problems (#‚ÄãCSP#CSP\\#\\textsf{CSP}). Real number weighted Holant is capable of expressing #‚ÄãEO#EO\\#\\textsf{EO} problems defined by signatures with ARS [ref]15 after a holographic transformation by Z=12‚Äã(11ùî¶‚àíùî¶)ùëç12matrix11ùî¶ùî¶Z=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\begin{matrix}1&1\\\\\n\\mathfrak{i}&-\\mathfrak{i}\\end{matrix}\\right), while complex number weighted Holant can express complex weighted #‚ÄãEO#EO\\#\\textsf{EO} problems. Consequently, Holant is widely regarded as one of the most general frameworks in counting complexity and of great significance. All results in this paper aim at and hold for complex #‚ÄãEO#EO\\#\\textsf{EO} problems, that is all signatures have complex range by default. Significant progress has been made in #GH , , , , , , , , #‚ÄãCSP#CSP\\#\\textsf{CSP} , , , , , , , , , 8, , , , #‚ÄãEO#EO\\#\\textsf{EO} , [ref]15 and Holant , , , , , 4, [ref]1, , , . Besides, the computational complexity of #GH and #‚ÄãCSP#CSP\\#\\textsf{CSP} has been completely established as two dichotomies , . On the other hand, the dichotomy for Holant is not settled yet, and we notice that even the study of #‚ÄãEO#EO\\#\\textsf{EO} is not sufficient. Consequently, we seek for a more generalized characterization of the complexity of #‚ÄãEO#EO\\#\\textsf{EO} in this article. We generalize the dichotomy for six-vertex model  to the dichotomy for #‚ÄãEO#EO\\#\\textsf{EO} problems defined by a set of binary or quaternary signatures in Section 4. We also establish a dichotomy for #‚ÄãEO#EO\\#\\textsf{EO} defined by pure signatures in Section 5. These settings are considered to be important cases in the study of #‚ÄãEO#EO\\#\\textsf{EO}, as new tractable cases are found under these settings. Furthermore, in Section 6 we present a polynomial time algorithm for #‚ÄãEO#EO\\#\\textsf{EO} problems defined by specific rebalancing signatures. This algorithm also generalizes the tractable cases in the aforementioned dichotomies and extends the known algorithms to a wider range.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: (#GH), counting constraint satisfaction problems (#‚ÄãCSP#CSP\\#\\textsf{CSP}).
