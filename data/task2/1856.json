      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Attributed Network Representation Learning via Attribute Enhanced Neighborhood\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe network representation is first proposed as the part of dimensionality reduction technologies  in the early 20th century. However, the early methods suffers from both computational and statistical performance drawbacks [ref]3. Afterwards, Perozzi et al. generalize the advancements in language modeling to large-scale networks. A large number of related excellent algorithms have been proposed. For example, DeepWalk uses the uniform sampling to collect the node sequences[ref]20. Node2vec [ref]3 extends the DeepWalk model, which captures the diversity of connectivity patterns in a network. Intuitively, the skip-gram-based methods capture the high-order proximity. LINE utilizes different carefully designed objective functions to preserve the first-order and second-order proximity. However, all of the above methods cannot preserve the different k‚Äã(k‚â•3)ùëòùëò3k(k\\geq 3)-step relationships in distinct subspaces[ref]20. Therefore, Cao et al. propose GraRep[ref]20, which concatenates all the local k‚Äã(k‚â•3)ùëòùëò3k(k\\geq 3)-step representations as the representations of nodes. The mentioned methods all utilize the network structure only to learn network representation. Besides the structure, nodes in the real world are usually affiliated with various attributes. Then, researchers begin to focus on mining the network features from attributed networks, such as GAT2VEC  and SANE . To further capture the highly non-linearity, some algorithms, such as DANE[ref]15, ASNE and MDNE, have been recently designed based on the deep learning technologies, which all model the network structure, encode the attribute information, and then depend on the strong correlation between the structure and the attributes to obtain the consistent network embedding. Giving an example, DANE[ref]15 utilizes the autoencoder to preserve the high-order structural proximity and attribute semantics, the joint probability to capture the first-order proximity from the structure and attributes, and the likelihood estimation to learn the node embeddings by jointly the structure and attributes. The above methods might be susceptible to the sparsity of either the structure or the attributes. For learning the robust representations, Zhang et al  propose a deep coupling model ANRL, which preserves the second-order and high-order proximity from the topological structure. On the basis of the encoder part, ANRL constructs a neighbor enhancement autoencoder module, and designs an attribute-aware skip-gram module. Nevertheless, the design of the autoencoder makes ANRL limited by the choice of datasets. In summary, attributed NRL is still an open problem in at least two aspects as follows: (1) the network structure and node attributes are two heterogeneous information sources, we need to consider how to preserve their characteristics in a vector space; (2) the first-order, second-order and high-order proximity define different neighborhood relations among directly or indirectly connected nodes. To capture local closeness proximities could help preserve the entire microscopic structure features of original networks, yet how to design a proper model is a challenge. Here, we propose the DANRL-ANE model under the paradigm of deep coupling, in which three coupled modules are designed to capture the different order proximity. Especially, the attribute information is mined as the supplement of the adjacency matrix.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: is first proposed as the part of dimensionality reduction technologies  in the early 20th century.
