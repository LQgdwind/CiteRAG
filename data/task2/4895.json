      "content": "Paper Title: Improving GANs with a Feature Cycling Generator\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerative adversarial networks (GANs) , which consist of a generator and a discriminator, have significantly advanced in various research fields such as image generation [ref]13  2 , text-to-image translation  , image-to-image translation   , and image inpainting   . In general, the generator and discriminator compete against each other during training:\nthe generator aims at emulating the observed image as much as possible in order to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish fake samples from real ones. Despite the great effort of training GANs stably from the discriminator side  2          , such as objective functions and regularization techniques, it has been relatively less explored on the generator architecture. In fact, the competition between the generator and the discriminator is not quite fair . Specifically, in adversarial learning, the discriminator directly accesses the real image, examines how close the real and generated images are, and computes a probability to train itself and affect the generator . Conversely, the generator only can receive the learning signal, i.e. gradients, derived from the discriminator. Thus, this unfair competition allows the discriminator to easily win the game, and massive experimental results support evidence for this analysis. Therefore, designing an appropriate generator architecture for fair competition is essential for GANs. The generator in a GAN is typically built by stacking up multiple residual blocks 2 3    [ref]13 4 6 since the shortcut in the residual block well assists the flow of information from the latent space (initial stage) to the image (last stage). However, some recent papers 4 8 5 7 drew attention to the limitations of the residual block and introduced novel modules that are more suitable for building the generator. In detail, Wang et al. 7 proposed an altered residual block that has different convolution kernel sizes from the traditional one and demonstrated that their block shows better performance than the traditional one. However, a recent paper 4 pointed out that the performance improvement in 7 is caused by the activation function (gated linear unit) rather than the module architecture. Park et al. 4 redesigned the residual block by adding a side residual path that effectively emphasizes the informative feature while suppressing the less useful one. In addition, Park et al. 5 introduced novel generator architecture, called ABGAN, which contains an auxiliary branch controlling the information flow between residual blocks. These approaches show impressive performance and imply the possibility of performance improvement via newly designing the generator architecture. Based on these observations, this work investigates a different generator architecture to improve the GAN performance. In particular, this paper offers a novel module used for the generator, called feature cycling block (FCB), where the concept diagram is depicted in Fig. 1. The FCB contains two branches: the image branch aims to produce features used for producing high-quality images, whereas the memory branch gives selected information to the image branch as well as memorizes meaningful features in the image branch. More specifically, in the FCB, the image branch first takes some useful features from the memory branch through the feature fusion module and then produces features using multiple convolution layers. After that, the memory branch updates its feature using the newly produced features in the image branch. That means the features in both branches are jointly updated by interchanging their information. In order to prove the superiority of the proposed method, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study by evaluating the GAN performance on various datasets including CIFAR-10 , CFIAR-100 , FFHQ [ref]13, AFHQ , and subsets of LSUN . Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed method can improve the image generation performance, in terms of Frechet inception distance (FID)  and Precision/Recall  4. In the remainder of this paper, we explain the preliminaries in Section 2 and introduce the proposed method in Section 3. In Section 4, extensive experimental results are presented to show the superior performance of the proposed method compared to conventional ones, and Section 5 concludes the paper. We summarize the contributions of this work as follows: This paper presents a novel module for the generator called feature cycling block (FCB), which achieves superior performance over conventional methods. We newly design a feature fusion module that successfully blends features from two different sources. To demonstrate that the FCB benefits the GANs performance, we conduct extensive experiments on various datasets and reveal that the proposed method achieves remarkable performance with various quantitative evaluation metrics.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) , which consist of a generator and a discriminator, have significantly advanced in various research fields such as image generation [ref]13  2 , text-to-image translation  , image-to-image translation   , and image inpainting   .
