      "content": "Paper Title: Low-Resource Court Judgment Summarization for Common Law Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDocument summarization methods can be generally categorized into two types: extractive    and abstractive   summarization methods. We summarize and compare previous court judgment summarization methods in Table 1. Extractive summarization methods are widely utilized in legal document summarization. They select the most salient input sentences to comprise summaries.\nLetSum  aims to produce structured summaries comprising four pre-defined themes. It uses heuristic rules to score and rank relevant sentences, and then select the sentences with the highest scores for each theme to comprise the structured summary.\nSimilarly, Saravanan et al.  employ the Conditional Random Field (CRF) to divide a legal document into seven labeled components.\nThen, they use the k-mixture model to select sentences for each component in the structured summary.\nCaseSummarizer  ranks input documents’ sentences based on their tf-idf scores  coupled with some customized features.\nFeijó and Moreira  compare some commonly used unsupervised extractive summarization methods (Gensim , LexRank , and TextRank ).\nGlaser et al. [ref]6 employ convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) based extractive summarization methods.\nDespite the notable development of extractive summarization methods over the last few decades, the extracted summaries still face difficulties in terms of coherence and readability  [ref]38. Consequently, abstractive summarization methods have received more attention in recent years. Abstractive summarization methods identify the salient content in input text and generate novel sentences as summaries .\nUnlike extractive summarization methods, there are relatively few abstractive summarization methods for court judgment documents.\nLegalSumm  divides the legal document into chunks and employs a transformer model [ref]39 to generate these chunks’ summaries.\nThen, it uses a BERT model  to assess these chunk summaries’ faithfulness and select the one with the highest score as the final summary.\nIts output summaries are much shorter than the target summaries in our CLSum dataset.\nShukla et al.  employ some pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models to summarize court judgments.\nBajaj et al.  fine-tune the BART model  on public health judgments in the United States. There is a lack of research on comprehensively assessing summarization models’ performance on multi-jurisdictional judgments.\nMost jurisdictions lack labeled data, which makes it difficult to train supervised summarization models.\nPrevious legal document summarization work usually neglects abstractive summarization models’ few-shot and zero-shot performance.\nIn addition to the scarcity of labeled data resources, deploying artificial intelligence models in domain applications is often constrained by limited computing resources.\nThere is a research gap in court judgment summarization under the constraints of low data and computing resources.\nAdditionally, more research is needed to utilize legal knowledge in the abstractive summarization of court judgments.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: tf-idf scores  coupled with some customized features.\nFeijó and Moreira  compare some commonly used unsupervised extractive summarization methods (Gensim , LexRank , and TextRank ).\nGlaser et al. [ref]6 employ convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) based extractive summarization methods.\nDespite the notable development of extractive summarization methods over\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
