      "content": "Paper Title: MindDiffuser: Controlled Image Reconstruction from Human Brain Activity with Semantic and Structural Diffusion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCLIP[ref]32 utilizes image-text contrastive learning to endow its representation space with rich semantic information, which has been widely utilized to guide downstream image generation tasks. Here, We describe the following works according to the different roles that CLIP plays in downstream tasks. Feed-forward image generation based on CLIP representations:\nOpenAI presents GLIDE[ref]34 for generating images guided by textual descriptions. GLIDE accomplishes this by incorporating text embeddings into the U-net for noise prediction, and employs CLIP-based guidance during the sampling process. DALL-E2[ref]35 employs a prior model to transform CLIP text embeddings into corresponding image features, which are subsequently utilized by a diffusion model to generate images that are semantically coherent and visually realistic. Stable Diffusion utilizes CLIP text embeddings in VQ-VAE’s latent space to guide the diffusion model in image generation, thereby enhancing model training and inference speed while ensuring high quality output. Besides its direct application in guiding image generation, the features extracted by CLIP can also serve as supervisory signals for continuously refining the latent vectors of the image generator via backpropagation. This technique enables fine-grained and personalized image generation and editing. Backward image optimization supervised by CLIP: \nStyleCLIP begins by obtaining the latent variable for a given face image through GAN Inversion. It then optimizes the latent variable under the supervision of the input text’s CLIP feature, resulting in an image that aligns with the text in the CLIP representation space. This optimization process enables the generation of images that match the desired style and content specified by the input text. StyleGAN-nada further excavates the semantic information in the CLIP representation space and enables cross-domain image generation. CLIP-GLaSS calculates the similarity of CLIP embeddings between the input text and the generated image, and uses a genetic algorithm to generate a image that most closely matches the input. Through the visual branch of CLIP, CLIPasso extracts the structure and semantic information of the original image and the generated stick figure image, whose L2 distance is used as a loss function, and then optimizes the stroke parameters until convergence through backpropagation. Similar to CLIPasso, our MindDiffuser uses the low-level image features extracted from CLIP to constrain the structural information of the reconstructed images. The prior works leveraging the CLIP representation space mentioned in 2.1 (Lin, Takagi) utilize the decoded CLIP features to guide the image reconstruction process directly. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed MindDiffuser is the first approach to leverage CLIP features as supervisory information for achieving fine-grained and controllable image reconstruction.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: CLIP[ref]32 utilizes image-text contrastive learning to endow its representation space with rich semantic information, which has been widely utilized to guide downstream image generation tasks.
