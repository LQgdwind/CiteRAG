Note that it is not difficult to extend our setting to a priori unknown f𝑓f by referring to Biyik et al., .\nAt every time step t∈ℕ𝑡ℕt\\in\\mathbb{N}, the agent must be in a safe state.\nSpecifically, for a state 𝒔tsubscript𝒔𝑡\\bm{s}_{t}, the safety function value g​(𝒔t)𝑔subscript𝒔𝑡g(\\bm{s}_{t}) must be above a threshold h∈(0,1]ℎ01h\\in(0,1]; that is, the safety constraint is represented as g​(𝒔t)≥h𝑔subscript𝒔𝑡ℎg(\\bm{s}_{t})\\geq h. In real applications, a robot is equipped with sensors and can infer the values of reward or safety functions by using such measurements as “hints.”\nTo formulate this mechanism, ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} contains two additional functions.\nFirst, ϕ:𝒮→𝔹d:bold-italic-ϕ→𝒮superscript𝔹𝑑\\bm{\\phi}:\\mathcal{S}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{B}^{d} is an a priori unknown function for mapping a state 𝒔𝒔\\bm{s} to a d𝑑d-dimensional feature vector, where 𝔹d:={𝒙∈ℝd∣‖𝒙‖≤1}assignsuperscript𝔹𝑑conditional-set𝒙superscriptℝ𝑑norm𝒙1\\mathbb{B}^{d}:=\\{\\bm{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\mid\\|\\bm{x}\\|\\leq 1\\}.\nFor convenience, let ϕ𝒔:=ϕ​(𝒔)assignsubscriptbold-italic-ϕ𝒔bold-italic-ϕ𝒔\\bm{\\phi}_{\\bm{s}}:=\\bm{\\phi}(\\bm{s}) denote the feature vector for a state 𝒔𝒔\\bm{s}.\nSecond, we define a function 𝝍:𝒮→𝒮:𝝍→𝒮𝒮\\bm{\\psi}:\\mathcal{S}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{S} for returning a set of states within the sensor range from a certain state.\nNote that, while conventional methods for solving MDPs with linear function approximation assume the prior availability of the feature map for a whole state space, we consider the problem where features are locally obtained upon observation. Near-sighted and far-sighted observations. \nOn the basis of the two functions ϕbold-italic-ϕ\\bm{\\phi} and 𝝍𝝍\\bm{\\psi}, we model two types of observation: near-sighted observation and far-sighted observation.\nNear-sighted observation is associated with direct observations of reward and safety, which is commonly used in typical RL settings including previous GP-based safe exploration studies.\nUsing near-sighted observations, the agent obtains a set of environmental information that contains noisy observations of the reward and safety function values along with the feature vector for the current state.\nThat is, the agent obtains (𝒔t,ϕ𝒔t,yr,yg)subscript𝒔𝑡subscriptbold-italic-ϕsubscript𝒔𝑡subscript𝑦𝑟subscript𝑦𝑔(\\,\\bm{s}_{t},\\bm{\\phi}_{\\bm{s}_{t}},y_{r},y_{g}\\,),\nwhere yrsubscript𝑦𝑟y_{r} and ygsubscript𝑦𝑔y_{g} are noisy observations of reward and safety, which are represented as yr=r​(𝒔)+ntrsubscript𝑦𝑟𝑟𝒔superscriptsubscript𝑛𝑡𝑟y_{r}=r(\\bm{s})+n_{t}^{r} and yg=g​(𝒔)+ntgsubscript𝑦𝑔𝑔𝒔superscriptsubscript𝑛𝑡𝑔y_{g}=g(\\bm{s})+n_{t}^{g},\nwith independent zero-mean noises ntrsuperscriptsubscript𝑛𝑡𝑟n_{t}^{r} and ntgsuperscriptsubscript𝑛𝑡𝑔n_{t}^{g}.\nFar-sighted observation is more related to feature vectors.\nIn this observation scheme, an agent obtains features for 𝝍​(𝒔)𝝍𝒔\\bm{\\psi}(\\bm{s}).\nFor convenience, let Ψt⊆𝒮subscriptΨ𝑡𝒮\\Psi_{t}\\subseteq\\mathcal{S} denote the set of states that have been observed at least once until time t𝑡t; that is,\nΨt:=𝝍​(𝒔0)∪𝝍​(𝒔1)∪…∪𝝍​(𝒔t)assignsubscriptΨ𝑡𝝍subscript𝒔0𝝍subscript𝒔1…𝝍subscript𝒔𝑡\\Psi_{t}:=\\bm{\\psi}(\\bm{s}_{0})\\cup\\bm{\\psi}(\\bm{s}_{1})\\cup\\ldots\\cup\\bm{\\psi}(\\bm{s}_{t}).\nIntuitively, the agent needs to predict the reward and safety function values by improving the internal GLMs on the basis of near-sighted observations and applying them to the features obtained by far-sighted observations. Goal. \nThe quality of a policy π:𝒮→𝒜:𝜋→𝒮𝒜\\pi:\\mathcal{S}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{A} is evaluated in terms of the cumulative reward achieved by the agent under the safety constraint.\nThe problem is formally written as There are a number of previous studies on solutions to CMDPs, but most of them violate safety constraints during training (e.g., [ref]2).\nIn contrast, we require the agent to learn a policy in ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} without even a single constraint violation.\nWithout assumptions, it is intractable to solve the problem mentioned above.\nIn the following, we list assumptions in this paper. Generalized linear function approximation. \nThe first assumption is on the structure of the reward and safety functions.\nIn this paper, we are concerned with generalized linear models (GLMs) regarding the reward and safety functions that are characterized by a feature vector. The reward and safety functions are respectively represented using GLMs that are characterized by unknown coefficient vectors 𝛉r∗,𝛉g∗∈ℝdsuperscriptsubscript𝛉𝑟superscriptsubscript𝛉𝑔superscriptℝ𝑑\\bm{\\theta}_{r}^{*},\\bm{\\theta}_{g}^{*}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} and fixed, strictly increasing link functions μr,μg:ℝ→ [ref]1:subscript𝜇𝑟subscript𝜇𝑔→ℝ01\\mu_{r},\\mu_{g}:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow [ref]1 such that Note that linear and logistic models are the special cases of GLM with μ​(x)=x𝜇𝑥𝑥\\mu(x)=x and μ​(x)=11+e−x𝜇𝑥11superscript𝑒𝑥\\mu(x)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}, respectively.\nTo predict the coefficients, we obtain maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) for reward and safety functions as in Filippi et al., .\nLet θ~rsubscript~𝜃𝑟\\tilde{\\theta}_{r} and θ~gsubscript~𝜃𝑔\\tilde{\\theta}_{g} be the MLEs for reward and safety, respectively.\nHere, θ~rsubscript~𝜃𝑟\\tilde{\\theta}_{r} and θ~gsubscript~𝜃𝑔\\tilde{\\theta}_{g} are the unique solutions of the following equations. The optimal solutions of the above equations can be found efficiently using such standard algorithms as Newton’s method.\nWe additionally make an assumption on the properties of the link functions. Let ⋄⋄\\diamond denote either r𝑟r or g𝑔g.\nThe link function μ⋄subscript𝜇⋄\\mu_{\\diamond} is twice differentiable, and the first and second order derivatives are respectively bounded by L⋄subscript𝐿⋄L_{\\diamond} and M⋄subscript𝑀⋄M_{\\diamond}.\nAlso, the link function μ⋄subscript𝜇⋄\\mu_{\\diamond} satisfies ξ⋄=inf‖θ⋄−θ⋄∗‖≤1,‖ϕ𝐬‖≤1μ˙⋄​(ϕ𝐬⊤​θ⋄)>0subscript𝜉⋄subscriptinfimumformulae-sequencenormsubscript𝜃⋄subscriptsuperscript𝜃⋄1normsubscriptbold-ϕ𝐬1subscript˙𝜇⋄superscriptsubscriptbold-ϕ𝐬topsubscript𝜃⋄0\\xi_{\\diamond}=\\inf_{\\|\\theta_{\\diamond}-\\theta^{*}_{\\diamond}\\|\\leq 1,\\|\\bm{\\phi}_{\\bm{s}}\\|\\leq 1}\\dot{\\mu}_{\\diamond}(\\bm{\\phi}_{\\bm{s}}^{\\top}\\theta_{\\diamond})>0. Prior knowledge on safety. \nWithout prior information on the states known to be safe, an agent cannot guarantee safety at the first step.\nHence, we make the following assumption. The agent is initially in a set of states, S0⊆𝒮subscript𝑆0𝒮S_{0}\\subseteq\\mathcal{S}, that is known to be safe a priori. Sub-Gaussian noise. \nThe final assumption is on the properties of the observation noise, which has been commonly made in previous work (e.g., Abbasi-yadkori et al., [ref]1). Let ⋄⋄\\diamond be either r𝑟r or g𝑔g.\nThe noise nt⋄subscriptsuperscript𝑛⋄𝑡n^{\\diamond}_{t} is sub-Gaussian with fixed (positive) parameters σ⋄subscript𝜎⋄\\sigma_{\\diamond}; that is, for all t𝑡t, we have 𝔼​[eω⋄​nt⋄∣ℱt−1⋄]≤eω⋄2​σ⋄2/2𝔼delimited-[]conditionalsuperscript𝑒subscript𝜔⋄subscriptsuperscript𝑛⋄𝑡subscriptsuperscriptℱ⋄𝑡1superscript𝑒superscriptsubscript𝜔⋄2superscriptsubscript𝜎⋄22\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\,e^{\\omega_{\\diamond}n^{\\diamond}_{t}}\\mid\\mathcal{F}^{\\diamond}_{t-1}\\,\\right]\\leq e^{\\omega_{\\diamond}^{2}\\sigma_{\\diamond}^{2}/2},\nwhere {ℱn⋄}subscriptsuperscriptℱ⋄𝑛\\{\\mathcal{F}^{\\diamond}_{n}\\} is increasing sequences of sigma fields such that nt⋄subscriptsuperscript𝑛⋄𝑡n^{\\diamond}_{t} is ℱt⋄subscriptsuperscriptℱ⋄𝑡\\mathcal{F}^{\\diamond}_{t}-measurable with 𝔼​[nt⋄∣ℱt−1⋄]=0𝔼delimited-[]conditionalsubscriptsuperscript𝑛⋄𝑡subscriptsuperscriptℱ⋄𝑡10\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\,n^{\\diamond}_{t}\\mid\\mathcal{F}^{\\diamond}_{t-1}\\,\\right]=0.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: set of actions {𝒂}𝒂\\{\\bm{a}\\}, f:𝒮×𝒜→𝒮:𝑓→𝒮𝒜𝒮f:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{S} is the deterministic state transition, and H∈ℕ𝐻ℕH\\in\\mathbb{N} is the finite horizon.\nAlso, r:𝒮→ [ref]1:𝑟→𝒮01r:\\mathcal{S}\\rightarrow [ref]1 and g:𝒮→ [ref]1:𝑔→𝒮01g:\\mathcal{S}\\rightarrow [ref]1 are bounded reward and safety functions.\nWe assume that both r𝑟r and g𝑔g are not known a priori.111For\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
