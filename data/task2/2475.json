Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

It is crucial to develop models that are robust to biases. Along with VQA-CP dataset [ref]1, Agrawal et al. propose GVQA model that disentangles the visual concept recognition from the answer space prediction. LDP  and GVQE  exploit different information in questions for better question representation.\nThese models require a pre-defined question parser, making them hard to implement. Another line of work starts from visual grounding. Early works   directly apply human grounding   as supervision to attention maps, but the improvement is limited. HINT [ref]44 and SCR [ref]47 change supervised attention maps to Grad-CAM, which directly encourages the contribution of each object to be consistent with human annotations. Recent work  experimentally challenges the effectiveness of visual grounding in [ref]44 [ref]47, but does not find a good way to test if systems are actually visually grounded. The most effective solution so far is ensemble-based, which formulates a question-only branch as explicit modelling for language bias.\nRamakrishnan et al.  introduce an adversarial regularization to remove answer discriminative feature from the questions. RUBi , LMH  and PoE  re-weight samples based on the question-only prediction. Niu et al.  further improve ensemble strategies from a causal-effect perspective. CSS  combines grounding-based and ensemble-based methods with counterfactual samples synthesizing.\nGat et al.  introduce a regularization by maximizing functional entropies (MFE), which forces the model to use multiple sources of information in multi-modal tasks. Nam et al.  propose a general framework LfF, which trains the de-biased classifier from a biased classifier. Compared to our work, they mainly focus on single-modality classification problems and their General Cross-Entropy (GCE) re-weighting strategy is less flexible, which relies on hyper-parameter in GCE and can only handle one pair of attributes in de-bias learning.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Collecting new large-scale datasets is costly.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
