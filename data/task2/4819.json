      "content": "Paper Title: GAN you hear me? Reclaiming unconditional speech synthesis from diffusion models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe train two variants of our model: a log mel-spectrogram based model and a HuBERT feature based model .\nThe former\nis shown in Fig. 1, where\nthe model outputs\n128 mel-frequency bins at\na hop and window size of\n10 ms and 64 ms, respectively.\nThe HuBERT\nmodel is identical\nexcept\nthat it only uses\nhalf the sequence length\n(since HuBERT features are 20 ms instead of the 10 ms spectrogram frames)\nand\nhas\na different number\nof output channels in the four groups of Style Blocks:    1024768512512    convolution channels instead of       . The HiFi-GAN vocoder for both the HuBERT and mel-spectrogram\nmodel is\nbased on the original\nimplementation [ref]27.\nThe HuBERT HiFi-GAN is trained on the Librispeech train-clean-100 subset \nto vocode activations from layer 6 of the\nHuBERT Base model .\nThe mel-spectrogram HiFi-GAN is trained on the Google Speech Commands dataset. Both\nASGAN variants are trained with Adam  (β1=0,β2=0.99formulae-sequencesubscript𝛽10subscript𝛽20.99\\beta_{1}=0,\\beta_{2}=0.99), clipping gradient norms at 10, and a learning rate of 3⋅10−3⋅3superscript1033\\cdot 10^{-3} for 520k iterations with a batch size of 32.\nSeveral\ntricks are\nused to stabilize GAN training:\n(i) equalized learning rate\n[ref]24, (ii) leaky ReLU activations with α=0.1𝛼0.1\\alpha=0.1, (iii) exponential moving averaging\nfor the generator weights [ref]24, (iv) R1subscript𝑅1R_{1} regularization , and (v)\na 0.01-times smaller learning rate for\nthe mapping network W𝑊W\n. We also introduce a new technique for updating the discriminator.\nConcretely, we first scale D𝐷D’s learning rate by 0.1 compared to the generator as otherwise we find it overwhelms\nG𝐺G\nearly on in training.\nAdditionally we employ a dynamic method for updating D𝐷D, inspired by adaptive discriminator augmentation [ref]14:\nduring each iteration, we skip D𝐷D’s update with probability p𝑝p.\nThe probability p𝑝p is initialized at 0.1 and is updated every 16th generator step or whenever the discriminator is updated.\nWe keep a running average rtsubscript𝑟𝑡r_{t} of the proportion of D𝐷D’s outputs on real data D​(X)𝐷𝑋D(X) that are positive (i.e. that D𝐷D can confidently identify as real).\nThen, if rtsubscript𝑟𝑡r_{t} is greater than 0.6 we increment p𝑝p by 0.05 (capped at 1.0), and if rtsubscript𝑟𝑡r_{t} is less than 0.6 we decrease p𝑝p by 0.05 (capped at 0.0).\nIn this way we adaptively skip discriminator updates. When D𝐷D becomes too strong, rtsubscript𝑟𝑡r_{t} and p𝑝p rise, and so D𝐷D is updated less frequently. When D𝐷D becomes too weak (i.e. fails to distinguish between real and fake inputs), then the opposite happens.\nWe found this new modification to be critical for ensuring that the D𝐷D does not overwhelm G𝐺G\nduring training. We also use the traditional adaptive discriminator augmentation [ref]14\nwhere we apply the following transforms with the same probability p𝑝p:\n(i) adding Gaussian noise with σ=0.05𝜎0.05\\sigma=0.05, (ii) random scaling by a factor of 1±0.05plus-or-minus10.051\\pm 0.05, and (iii) randomly replacing a subsequence of frames from the generated speech features with a subsequence of frames taken from a real speech feature sequence.\nThis last augmentation is based on the fake-as-real GAN method  and is important to prevent gradient explosion later in training. For the anti-aliasing LPF filters we use\nwindowed sinc filters with a width-9 Kaiser window .\nFor the generator, the first Style Block has a cutoff\nat\nfc=0.125​cycles/samplesubscript𝑓𝑐0.125cycles/samplef_{c}=0.125\\ \\text{cycles/sample} which is increased in an even logarithmic scale to fc=0.45​cycles/samplesubscript𝑓𝑐0.45cycles/samplef_{c}=0.45\\ \\text{cycles/sample} in the second-to-last layer, keeping this value for the last two layers to fill in the last high frequency detail.\nEven in these last layers we use a cutoff below the Nyquist frequency.\nFor the discriminator we are less concerned about aliasing as\nit does not generate a sequence, so we\nuse a\nfc=0.5​cycles/samplesubscript𝑓𝑐0.5cycles/samplef_{c}=0.5\\ \\text{cycles/sample}\ncutoff\nfor all ConvD Blocks. All models are trained on a single NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 using PyTorch 1.11.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: four groups of Style Blocks:    1024768512512    convolution channels instead of       .
