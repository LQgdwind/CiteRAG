Here, the first is called hyperprior and captures spatial correlation within the image, while the second one models the latent representation, which is supposed to follow a zero-mean Gaussian distribution. [ref]10  combined previous architecture with a context-based auto-regressive entropy model to capture more local spatial correlation by exploiting already decoded parts of images. Similarly,  improved context modeling through a 3D zigzag scanning order, and improved parallelism entropy decoding with a 3D code dividing technique by partitioning the latent representation in multiple independent groups. In  a special non-local operation is proposed to consider global similarity within the context, by introducing U-net-like blocks, while  introduced non-local network operations as non-linear transforms in both latent representations.\nIn more recent works other techniques have been exploited to improve RD performance;  replaced simple Gaussian distribution with a mixture of Gaussians and introduced some attention module to enhance entropy estimation, while  introduced a more flexible discretized Gaussian-Laplacian-Logistic mixture model for the latent representation.\nIn  local attention is exploited to combine the local-aware attention with the global-related feature learning and to the present date is among the best-performing architectures.\nIn the following, we chose this architecture to exemplify how we integrated our quantization method into a typical image compression architecture.\nYet, we will demonstrate the versatility of our method by applying it to other two architectures in the experimental section.\n\nTang et al.  proposed a self-attention mechanism based on graphs to improve entropy estimation, and other threads of works tried to enhance some aspects of previous models:  for example extracted better transformation between image and latent features space by exploiting invertible networks, while 0 1 replaced convolutional modules with the Swin transformer to achieve better compression efficiency with fewer parameters.\nOn the other hand, 2 focused on the optimization of the image decoding through a learned block-based framework, 3 tried to adapt the entire structure to single images with an additional model stream to generate the transform parameters at the decoder side, and 4 introduced a checkerboard context model to improve efficiency during the decoding stage.\nIn 5 hierarchical VAE architecture, originally designed for generative image modeling, is exploited for LIC, redefining their probabilistic model to allow easy quantization and practical entropy coding.\nIn addition to the aforementioned variational autoencoder-based approaches, other approaches have been explored for compressing images using neural networks: 6 7 exploited GAN-based architecture to reduce image compression artifacts, especially at extremely low bitrates.\n\nThe common feature shared by all the mentioned works is that a single model targets a single rate, meaning that multiple models must be trained and stored to cover the range of rates required in practical image or video compression scenarios.\nThis issue is critical since each model includes tens of millions of learnable parameters.\nThe issue with variable rate image compression can be also related to the way quantization takes place, as discussed in the following.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Learnable Image Compression models have shown the potential to match or even outperform standardized codecs such as the recent H.266/VVC  in RD terms.\nEarly seminal works such as [ref]4  exploited a simple convolutional autoencoder structure with a unique latent representation modeled with a fully factorized distribution among channels modeled either analytically  or through\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
