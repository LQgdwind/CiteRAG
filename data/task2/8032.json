      "content": "Paper Title: Combining Neural Architecture Search and Automatic Code Optimization: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the quest for achieving state-of-the-art performance, DL researchers have been designing highly complex Neural Networks (NNs) that have revolutionized our lives.\nHowever, these progressive improvements come with significant increases in NNs’ size, complexity, energy consumption, and inference latency, making their deployment on resource-constrained devices challenging.\nGiven the plethora of available hardware platforms, ranging from powerful clusters to tiny IoT devices, it is essential to design efficient and hardware-friendly NNs.\nThis can be achieved by intervening at three levels: model design, software stack, and hardware stack [ref]1: Methods for improving model design include compression techniques like Quantization [ref]2, learning techniques like Distillation [ref]3 and optimization techniques, such as Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS). The latter is a multi-objective optimization process automating the design of NNs through maximization of accuracy and hardware efficiency metrics. At the software stack level, we can either optimize the implementation provided by DL frameworks such as PyTorch , or the code optimization strategies employed by the compiler on the low-level code of NNs  . The hardware level mainly includes designing specialized hardware and tuning accelerator configurations for training and running NN models inference . Each of these techniques contributes in optimizing NNs.\nHowever, independent execution of these techniques leads to sub-optimal results. For example, designing a network using HW-NAS, and then applying quantization on top of it may lead to a drop in accuracy [ref]2. Therefore, combining techniques within and across the three design levels has been explored. For instance, at the model design level, NAS has been combined with Quantization . Also, between the model design level and the hardware level, HW-NAS has been combined with the exploration of hardware accelerator designs on FPGA . Finally, between the model design level and the software stack level, compression has been combined with compiler optimizations , illustrating the potential of synergies. Figure 1 summarizes some cross-level works that have been published. A promising yet under-explored design methodology is to jointly explore HW-NAS and Automatic Code Optimization (ACO).\nFor the sake of brevity, we give it the name of NACOS (Neural Architecture and Compiler Optimizations co-Search). In their hardware efficiency evaluation, HW-NAS techniques consider the implementation provided by the DL framework as it is. This gives a rough approximation of the latency and energy consumption before applying code optimizations, resulting in the risk of overlooking optimal architectures during the search. On the other hand, ACO usually works on a given network with a fixed architecture, regardless of its performance and optimality. Combining HW-NAS and ACO would allow an accurate approximation of the hardware efficiency metrics in HW-NAS and an ACO that is adapted to the best network. This survey aims to explore NACOS methods and provide insights into the state-of-the-art methodologies by highlighting the following attributes: We first cover the fundamental principles of Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) and Automatic Code Optimization (ACO) in Section 2. In Section 3, we highlight the drawbacks of performing each technique independently and motivate their joint optimization. We propose a taxonomy to classify NACOS methods based on their key components in Section 4. In addition, we provide a detailed overview of existing works with a focus on their search space design. We then discuss the exploration algorithms and the candidate evaluation strategies employed in existing methods in Section 5. In the last section, we address the challenges and limitations of the existing works and propose some research directions to advance this area further.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: clusters to tiny IoT devices, it is essential to design efficient and hardware-friendly NNs.\nThis can be achieved by intervening at three levels: model design, software stack, and hardware stack [ref]1: Methods for improving model design include compression techniques like Quantization [ref]2, learning techniques like Distillation [ref]3 and optimization techniques, such as Hardware-aware\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
