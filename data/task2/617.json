      "content": "Paper Title: Deep or Simple Models for Semantic Tagging? It Depends on your Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe curate a collection of 21 textual datasets to evaluate the quality of different models on the semantic tagging task. To the best of our knowledge, our datasets have the best coverage of the real-world datasets for semantic tagging. We focus on three characteristics of the datasets that are crucial to a model’s performance: size, label ratio, and label cleanliness. Datasets in our collection have 1,700 to 17,000,000 examples.\nThe ratio of positive instances in our datasets ranges from 1.6% to 71.4%.\n4 of the 21 datasets use labels generated based on incomplete metadata, while the rest use either human-annotated labels or labels which are derived from complete metadata.\n Source. We collected our datasets from various semantic tagging applications that are surveyed in Section 2. We describe the collection process for each dataset below. Tip: We use the SUGG dataset from the 9th task of SEMEVAL competition 2019 . The labels are based on whether a user comment can help improve windows software. The HOTEL  dataset is based on hotel reviews. The labels are derived based on whether a review sentence provides suggestions for future customers. The SENT  and PARA  datasets also contain tip sentences (customers’ recommendations for software updates) and non-tip sentences (e.g., customers’ experience of using the software). Humor:\nWe use the FUNNY  dataset from the YELP Dataset Challenge , in which a review received votes from readers if they think this review is funny. Reviews with more than 5 votes are annotated as positive and reviews with 0 votes are annotated as negative . We use the HOMO and HETER datasets from the 7th task of SEMEVAL competition 2019 [ref]34. A sentence is labeled positive or negative depending on the occurrence of pun words. Spoiler: The TV  and BOOK [ref]52 datasets are obtained from TV show comments and book comments, respectively. Each sentence is labeled depending on whether the sentence contains a spoiler. Having more than 17 million examples, BOOK is the largest among all the datasets. Argument: We have 8 datasets for Argument application namely, EVAL, REQ, FACT, REF, QUOTE, ARGUMENT, SUPPORT, and AGAINST. Each dataset has been derived from two multi-class tagging tasks. EVAL, REQ, FACT, REF, and QUOTE [ref]20 include examples of different types of sentences that make up a paper review. ARGUMENT, SUPPORT, and AGAINST 9 are obtained from online discussions of controversial topics and contain sentences corresponding to argument opinion, supportive opinion, and opposed opinion, respectively. Sentiment: AMAZON 1 and YELP 1 are two Sentiment datasets that are obtained from AMAZON and YELP reviews, respectively. A review is annotated as positive if the writer gives a rating of 3 or 4 and as negative if the rating is 1 or 2. FUNNY* and BOOK* are 2 additional large datasets that we obtained from FUNNY and BOOK by balancing the positive and negative labels. We randomly drop a number of negative labels to make the label ratio balanced. Overall, the datasets we collected offer a good representation of real-world datasets and enable us to understand the strengths and limitations of different models.\n Dataset preparation. Since dataset preparation can directly influence tagging performance and model selection, it is a critical component of the tagging pipeline. Our datasets come from different papers and public competitions, and therefore, must be transformed into the same format.\nA data record is in the format of (text, label), with label 1 representing the text we wish to tag and 0 otherwise. We calculate crucial information about these datasets in Table 3, such as the application that a dataset belongs to, the number of records, and the percentage of positive labels. \n Dataset Characteristics. We next describe the characteristics of the various datasets we collected/generated. Size: The scales of the datasets skew towards two ends. 15 out of 21 datasets have a small number of records at the scale of 1,000 to 99,999 (small datasets), while the remaining 6 datasets contain 100,000 to 20,000,000 records (large datasets). Small datasets are more common than large datasets in actual cases. This is because every record of a dataset requires human annotation. The high price of recruiting human annotators limits the scale of datasets. However, accompanying the emergence of experience-sharing websites such as Amazon and YELP, more and more large datasets appear. Following this, numerous customers share their opinions on these websites through sentence annotation. For example, YELP users share their opinions on YELP about whether a review is funny  or not. Given the polarization of real-word datasets in scale, a practical tagging model should be able to tag both small and large datasets accurately. Label Ratio: Label imbalance is a common phenomenon in our datasets. We observed 14 out of 21 datasets having fewer positive labels than negative labels. More specifically, 10 of the 14 datasets exhibit a ratio of positive labels smaller than 25% (considered as imbalance). For the remaining 7 datasets, 5 datasets exhibit a balanced ratio of around 50% and 2 datasets exhibit a ratio of positive labels larger than 70%. A higher percentage of positive labels is favorable due to two main reasons. First, more positive instances can increase the size of effective training data, leading to better training quality. Second, more positive instances can minimize the misleading effects of negative instances, increasing the accuracy of tagging results. Cleanliness: There are two common ways to obtain data labels: rule generation and human annotation. Relying on rules can potentially introduce dirty labels due to missing annotations.\nFor example, relying on number of votes to generate label FUNNY can introduce dirty labels for new records which do not have enough votes.\nSimilarly, relying on spoiler alters to generate label BOOK can be dirty if writers do not leave any alert on their reviews.\nConsequently, we consider FUNNY, BOOK, and their derivatives (FUNNY* and BOOK*), based on rule generation, as dirty datasets. The rest of the datasets, which are based on human annotation, are categorized as clean datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: funny. Reviews with more than 5 votes are annotated as positive and reviews with 0 votes are annotated as negative . We use the HOMO and HETER datasets from the 7th task of SEMEVAL competition 2019 [ref]34. A sentence is labeled positive or negative depending on the occurrence of pun words. Spoiler: The TV  and BOOK [ref]52 datasets are obtained from TV show comments and book comments,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
