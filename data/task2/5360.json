      "content": "Paper Title: Boosting Synthetic Data Generation with Effective Nonlinear Causal Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn many real-world applications, it is fundamental to rely on synthetic data, especially when real data can be difficult to obtain due to privacy issues, temporal or budget constraints, or the unavailability of large quantities.\nSynthetic data are used for validating data discovery applications and for testing software in a controlled environment that satisfies specific conditions  .\nIn machine learning, synthetic data are increasingly being used for addressing imbalanced learning , for training a model with the intention of transfer learning to real data [ref]4, or, in the last days, for providing explanations of obscure decision systems .\nIndeed, various studies show the benefits of using synthetic data located in the neighborhood of available real instances for learning predictive models  [ref]7, or for explaining the reasons for the prediction . In these scenarios, the methods used for synthetic data generation are either simple but efficient random approaches assuming uniform distribution for all the variables , or complex and time expensive methods such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) [ref]9.\nHowever, typically, only a few of them rely on explicit knowledge about possible linear and/or nonlinear dependencies among the variables.\nIn particular, common generative approaches work on the assumption that the variables of the dataset to generate are independent.\nSuch an assumption does not guarantee a reliable synthetic generation of the dataset under analysis.\nOn the other hand, GAN-like approaches can theoretically learn possible dependencies, but these are not explicitly represented, and there is no guarantee that they are followed in the data generation process. Therefore, a crucial problem in synthetic data generation is that dependencies among variables are not used because they are typically unknown.\nOur idea is to design a technique for synthetic data generation that accounts for dependencies among variables by exploiting a causal discovery algorithm.\nCausal discovery algorithms take as input a set of variables belonging to a dataset and determine which are the causal relationships among them 0 1.\nIn particular, we focus on nonlinear causal discovery 2.\nIf the dataset under analysis is continuous-valued, methods based on linear causal models are commonly applied 3.\nThis typically happens because linear models are well understood and not necessarily because the true causal relationships are believed to be linear 2.\nHowever, in reality, many causal relationships are nonlinear, raising doubts on the reliability and usability of linear methods.\nIn addition, in 2 it is shown that considering nonlinear causal relationships plays a primary role in the identification of causal directions.\nFor these reasons, we start from the nonlinear causal discovery method described in 2 (ncd) to design our synthetic data generator exploiting causal relationships.\nBesides non-linearity, the ncd is able to consider and discover not only binary relationships but also multivariate ones.\nUnfortunately, the ncd approach is inefficient and can only be employed to reveal the causal relationships of datasets with a very small number of variables.\nThus, it is not practically usable for applications on real datasets.\nOur proposal is to boost ncd by restricting the search of causalities among the features appearing in the patterns returned by a pattern mining algorithm executed on the same dataset. Our contribution is twofold.\nFirst, we design an efficient method for nonlinear causal discovery based on pattern mining named ncda (nonlinear causal discovery with Apriori).\nSecond, we implement gencda, a generative method based on ncda.\nMoreover, to validate our proposal, we realized a framework for generating synthetic datasets with known causalities.\nWe report wide experimentation on synthetic datasets and real datasets with known causalities highlighting the effectiveness of our proposals both in terms of time and accuracy for causal discovery and data generation. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.\nSection II discusses related works.\nSection III recalls the notions needed to understand the proposed methods which are illustrated in Section IV.\nSection V presents the experimental results.\nFinally, Section VI concludes the paper by discussing known limitations and proposing future research directions.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: specific conditions  .\nIn machine learning, synthetic data are increasingly being used for addressing imbalanced learning , for training a model with the intention of transfer learning to real data [ref]4, or, in the last days, for providing explanations of obscure decision systems .\nIndeed, various studies show the benefits of using synthetic data located in the neighborhood of available real\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
