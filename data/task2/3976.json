      "content": "Paper Title: Mutual Information Divergence: A Unified Metric for Multimodal Generative Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA multimodal generative model, including text-to-image generation  and image captioning [ref]2 models, is an emerging research topic showing interpretative multimodal understanding, text or image retrieval, machine creativity, etc.\nThe gist of learning multimodal generative models is to understand how to connect one modality to the other and generate the corresponding representations following the desired data distribution.\nHowever, measuring the distance or divergence between the model and data distributions is generally intractable due to the finite data and generation cost. Therefore, the proposed metrics attempt to approximate it with polynomial-sized data and generated samples [ref]3. For text-to-image generation, the widely-used metrics are Inception Score (IS) [ref]4 and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) . These metrics are originally proposed for non-conditional generative models, which are repurposed to measure the distance between the data and model conditional distributions using a validation split. This idea was supported by the effectiveness of deep features as a perceptual metric , although these metrics use the Inception V3 . Not surprisingly, there are the attempts to develop the more robust metrics using multimodal pre-trained models, such as object detectors , image captioning models , and vision-and-language pre-trained models 0 1.\nSignificantly, the image captioning method transforms text-to-image measurement into image-to-text measurement, providing a different viewpoint with cyclic consistency. For image-to-text generation, or image captioning, the COCO Caption Evaluation toolkit seems to be the standard to measure the divergence from ground-truth captions having BLEU 2, METEOR 3, ROUGE 4, CIDEr 5, and SPICE 6. Similar to the IS and FID of text-to-image generation metrics, these metrics are merely n-gram-based statistical methods neglecting conditional images.\nThe breakthrough in improving the correlation with human judgment comes from the utilization of the pre-trained vision-and-language models, e.g., TIGEr 7, ViLBERTScore-F 8, and RefCLIP-S 9.\nWe speculate that these two directional metrics are getting closer to measuring the generative divergence of text-image alignment. This paper proposes a unified metric for multimodal generative models.\nIn probability theory and information theory, mutual information (MI) measures how much one random variable tells us about the other.\nIn multimodal generation, the MI of two modalities quantitatively measures how much the generated is well-aligned with the condition.\nFrom this motive, we propose to use the Gaussian mutual information where the probability distributions are defined by the means and covariances of visual and textual features and borrow the idea of cross-mutual information  to measure the MI divergence from the real data distribution, which is the expectation of point-wise mutual information with respect to evaluating samples.\nSurprisingly, the proposed method outperforms previous works with significant margins on the assorted benchmarks of text-to-image generation and image captioning, including standard human judgment correlation benchmarks. Section 2 introduces the previous works on text-to-image generation and image captioning metrics, and a previous work on cross-mutual information. Section 3 describes the proposed method defining the continuous mutual information using multivariate Gaussian distributions and the negative cross-mutual information, which is the Mutual Information Divergence (MID) what we term.\nSection 4 consists of two parts, evaluation on text-to-image generation and image captioning evaluation, including related discussions.\nSection 5 concludes the work with remarks. We summarize our contributions as follows: To the best of our knowledge, we firstly propose the negative cross-mutual information under the Gaussian assumption as a unified metric for multimodal generative models. We provide three theoretical analyses on the proposed method MID, out-of-distribution detecting by the squared Mahalanobis distances, bias and variance decomposition, and its relation to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We achieve the state-of-the-art on text-to-image generation and image captioning benchmarks including the generated and human Likert-scale judgment correlations, visual reasoning accuracy, Flickr8K-Expert, Flickr8K-CF, Pascal-50S, and FOIL hallucination detection.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: A multimodal generative model, including text-to-image generation  and image captioning [ref]2 models, is an emerging research topic showing interpretative multimodal understanding, text or image retrieval, machine creativity, etc.\nThe gist of learning multimodal generative models is to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
