Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: TASM: A Tile-Based Storage Manager for Video Analytics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs mentioned in Section I, many systems optimize extracting semantic content from videos.\nBlazeIt  and NoScope [ref]7 apply specialized NNs that run faster than general models.\nOther systems filter frames before applying expensive models: probabilistic predicates 2 and ExSample  use statistical techniques, MIRIS  uses sampling, and SVQ [ref]44 and IC and OD filters  use deep learning filters.\nThese systems and techniques can use TASM to run models on specific ROIs to reduce their preprocessing overhead.\nFocus  shifts some processing to ingest-time.\nSystems such as LightDB , Optasia , and Scanner  accelerate queries through parallelization and deduplication of work, while VideoEdge  distributes processing over clusters. These general VDBMSs could incorporate TASM to further accelerate performance.\nPanorama  and Rekall  expand the set of queries that can be executed over videos, which is orthogonal to video storage. Other systems also target storage-level optimizations.\nVStore 0 modifies encoding parameters to accelerate processing while maintaining accuracy.\nSmol 3 jointly optimizes video resolution and NN architectures to achieve high accuracy while accelerating preprocessing, but, like VStore, only considers reducing the resolution of videos while TASM maintains video quality.\nVignette  uses tiles for perception-based compression but only considers uniform layouts. TASM’s incremental tiling approach is inspired by database cracking 6 7, which incrementally reorganizes the data processed by each query, and online indexing 8 which creates and modifies indices as queries are processed. Regret has also been used to design an economic model for self-tuning indices in a shared cloud database 9. TASM extends these relational storage techniques to provide efficient access to video data. Other application domains have observed the usefulness of retrieving spatial subsets of videos.\nThe MPEG DASH SRD standard  is motivated by a similar observation that video streaming clients occasionally request a spatial subset of videos. While it specifies a model to support streaming spatial subsets, it does not specify how to efficiently partition videos into tiles.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: As mentioned in Section I, many systems optimize extracting semantic content from videos.\nBlazeIt  and NoScope [ref]7 apply specialized NNs that run faster than general models.\nOther systems filter frames before applying expensive models: probabilistic predicates 2 and ExSample  use statistical techniques,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
