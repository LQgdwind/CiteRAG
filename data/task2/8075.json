Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Event Stream based Sign Language Translation: A High-Definition Benchmark Dataset and A New Algorithm\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n∙∙\\bullet Results on Event-CSL Dataset. \nAs shown in Table 2, the comparison between our method and multiple state-of-the-art methods of sign language translation on the Event-CSL dataset is provided. Our approach achieves better performance, with the scores of ROUGE-L and BLEU-4 being 68.02 and 48.70 respectively. In previous works, some gloss-based methods such as Chen et al. , Sign-XmDA [ref]40, GASLT [ref]41, and Joint-SLT  obtain excellent results. Compared with the GASLT method, which performs better among them, our approach improves by +36.33 and +36.06 in ROUGE-L and BLEU-4 respectively. At the same time, some methods have been chosen to translate sign language videos into sentences without gloss. GFSLT shows excellent performance among the Gloss-free methods, which include GFSLT [ref]43 and TSPNet . Our method is compared with GFSLT, which has no pre-training stage, and we achieve improvements of +0.79 and +0.50 in ROUGE-L and BLEU4 respectively. These experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the Event-CSL dataset. ∙∙\\bullet Results on EvSign Dataset. \nAs shown in Table 3, a comparison is made between our method and the previous methods     for sign language translation. Among these gloss-based methods, Zhang et al.  achieve excellent performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, our method is compared with that of Zhang et al. Our method improves by +18.89 and +17.04 in ROUGE-L and BLEU-4 respectively without any gloss annotations. These experimental results demonstrate the significant effectiveness of our method on the EvSign dataset. ∙∙\\bullet Results on PHOENIX-2014T-Event Dataset. These methods such as TSPNet , Joint-SLT , Sign-XmDA [ref]40, GASLT [ref]41 and GFSLT [ref]43 exhibit excellent performance on the PHOENIX-2014T dataset. We make comparisons with them on the PHOENIX-2014T-Event dataset, as shown in Table 4. Among the gloss-based methods, like Joint-SLT, Sign-XmDA, and GASLT, GASLT performs more prominently. Our method exceeds it by +12.61 and +7.71 respectively in ROUGE-L and BLEU-4 even without the guidance of any sign language gloss. GFSLT achieves better results than the gloss-free methods. Compared to it, our method improves by +0.87 and +0.08 in the ROUGE-L and BLEU-4 respectively. ∙∙\\bullet Results on CSL-Daily-Event Dataset. \nCSL-Daily-Event is an event simulation dataset, which originates from the CSL-Daily sign language dataset. As shown in Table 5, we report multiple SOTA methods of SLT on the CSL-Daily-Event dataset. For the gloss-based methods, our method improves by +9.64 and +4.88 respectively on ROUGE-L and BLEU-4 compared to GASLT. For the gloss-free methods, our method improves by +2.27 and +0.92 respectively on ROUGE-L and BLEU-4 compared to GFSLT. The results of these experiments demonstrate that our method can also achieve good performance on the event simulation dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: Our approach achieves better performance, with the scores of ROUGE-L and BLEU-4 being 68.02 and 48.70 respectively.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
