      "content": "Paper Title: Coresets for (𝑘,ℓ)-Median Clustering under the Fréchet Distance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n(k,ℓ)𝑘ℓ(k,\\ell)-clustering of polygonal curves was introduced by Driemel et al. [ref]12. They developed the first approximation schemes for (k,ℓ)𝑘ℓ(k,\\ell)-center and (k,ℓ)𝑘ℓ(k,\\ell)-median clustering of polygonal curves in ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}, which run in near-linear time. They proved that both problems are NP-hard, when k𝑘k is part of the input. Further, they showed that the doubling dimension of the space of polygonal curves under the Fréchet distance is unbounded, even when the curves are of bounded complexity. Subsequently, Buchin et al.  presented a constant factor approximation algorithm for (k,ℓ)𝑘ℓ(k,\\ell)-center clustering of polygonal curves in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, with running time linear in the number of given curves and polynomial in their maximum complexity. Also they showed that (k,ℓ)𝑘ℓ(k,\\ell)-center clustering is NP-hard and NP-hard to approximate within a factor of (1.5−ε)1.5𝜀(1.5-\\varepsilon) for curves in ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}, respectively (2.25−ε)2.25𝜀(2.25-\\varepsilon) for curves in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} with d≥2𝑑2d\\geq 2, even for k=1𝑘1k=1. Buchin et al. [ref]6 provided practical algorithms for (k,ℓ)𝑘ℓ(k,\\ell) clustering under the Fréchet distance and thereby introduce a new technique, the so called Fréchet centering, for computing better cluster centers. Also, Meintrup et al.  provided a practical (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximation algorithm for discrete (k,ℓ)𝑘ℓ(k,\\ell)-median clustering under the presence of a certain number of outliers.\nBuchin et al.  proved that (k,ℓ)𝑘ℓ(k,\\ell)-median clustering is also NP-hard, even for k=1𝑘1k=1. Furthermore, they presented polynomial-time approximation schemes for (k,ℓ)𝑘ℓ(k,\\ell)-center and (k,ℓ)𝑘ℓ(k,\\ell)-median clustering of polygonal curves under the discrete Fréchet distance. Nath and Taylor  gave a near-linear time approximation scheme for (k,ℓ)𝑘ℓ(k,\\ell)-median clustering of polygonal curves in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} under the discrete Fréchet distance and a polynomial-time approximation scheme for k𝑘k-median clustering of sets of points from ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} under the Hausdorff distance. Furthermore, they showed that k𝑘k-median clustering of point sets under the Hausdorff distance is NP-hard (for constant k𝑘k).\nRecently, Buchin et al.  developed an approximation scheme for (k,ℓ)𝑘ℓ(k,\\ell)-median clustering under the Fréchet distance with running time linear in the number of curves and polynomial in their complexity, where the computed centers have complexity up to 2​ℓ−22ℓ22\\ell-2. Langberg and Schulman [ref]25 developed a framework for computing relative error approximations of integrals over any function from a given family of unbounded and non-negative real functions. In particular, this framework can be used to compute ε𝜀\\varepsilon-coresets for k𝑘k-clustering of points in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} with objective functions based on sums of distances among the points and their closest center. The idea of their framework is to sub-sample the input with respect to a certain non-uniform probability distribution, which is computed using an approximate solution to the problem. More precisely, the approximate solution is used to compute an upper bound on the sensitivity of each data element. The sensitivity is the maximum fraction of cost that the element may cause for any possible solution. It is a notion of the data elements importance for the problem and the probability distribution is set up such that each element has probability proportional to its importance. A sample of a certain size drawn from this distribution and properly weighted, is an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-coreset for the underlying clustering problem with high probability. Feldman and Langberg  developed a unified framework for approximate clustering, which is largely based on ε𝜀\\varepsilon-coresets. They combine the techniques by Langberg and Schulman [ref]25 with ε𝜀\\varepsilon-approximations, which stem from the framework of range spaces and VC dimension developed in statistical learning theory. As a result, they address a spectrum of clustering problems, such as k𝑘k-median clustering, k𝑘k-line median clustering, projective clustering and also other problems like subspace approximation. Braverman et al.  improved the aforementioned framework by switching to (ε,η)𝜀𝜂(\\varepsilon,\\eta)-approximations, which leads to substantially smaller sample sizes in many cases. Also, they simplified and further generalized the framework and applied it to k𝑘k-means clustering of points in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}. Following, Feldman et al.  improved this framework by switching to another range space, thereby obtaining smaller coresets for k𝑘k-means, k𝑘k-line means and affine subspace clustering.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: (k,ℓ)𝑘ℓ(k,\\ell)-clustering of polygonal curves was introduced by Driemel et al. [ref]12.
