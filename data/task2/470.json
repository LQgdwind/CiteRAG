      "content": "Paper Title: Parametric Representation for Singing Voice Synthesis: a Comparative Evaluation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA careful listening and inspection of the signals revealed that high-pitched singing voices are more prone to artifacts. More precisely, we could identify three main possible sources of degradation for such voices, illustrated with the help of Figure 2: Some harmonics below the actual Fmsubscript𝐹𝑚F_{m} are almost inexistent which could lead to an underestimation of the maximum voiced frequency. Considering the example of Fig. 2 (see the top panel), the 4t​hsuperscript4𝑡ℎ4^{th} and 5t​hsuperscript5𝑡ℎ5^{th} harmonics have a very low amplitude while spectral peaks in the 6t​hsuperscript6𝑡ℎ6^{th} and 7t​hsuperscript7𝑡ℎ7^{th} harmonics (and even further) clearly emerge. This is likely to result in an underestimated Fmsubscript𝐹𝑚F_{m} using the algorithms described in [ref]37 or . As a consequence, any vocoder based on a dynamic maximum voiced frequency will sound artificially too noisy in such segments where Fmsubscript𝐹𝑚F_{m} is underestimated. The MGC spectral envelope captures F​0𝐹0F0-related information for high-pitched voices. This can be observed in the dashed line in the top plot of Fig. 2, which exhibits clear resonances for the first three harmonics. Although this effect is not critical in a copy-synthesis scheme (as achieved in this paper), this will undoubtedly become problematic when applying pitch transposition, or when having HMM-based speech synthesis in view. Indeed, the passage of a periodic excitation signal at a different F​0𝐹0F0 value through such a filter will cause auditory artifacts: the synthesized signal will contain a double pitch, since the filter contains residual pitch information. The spectrum may exhibit relatively strong interharmonics. This can be for example noticed by spectral peaks in 7/2⋅F​0⋅72𝐹07/2\\cdot F0 and 13/2⋅F​0⋅132𝐹013/2\\cdot F0 in the top plot of Fig. 2. These peaks have an amplitude comparable to their neighbouring harmonics. The implication of these interharmonics might be threefold: i) vocoders considered in this work are only able to reproduce harmonics and will fail in modeling such interharmonics; ii) it might affect the Fmsubscript𝐹𝑚F_{m} estimation process; iii) although not taken into account in this study (as we consider the F​0𝐹0F0 ground truth from EGG recordings), this will have an impact on the performance of pitch tracking methods, such as the Summation of Residual Harmonics (SRH, ) algorithm. The spectrum of the residual signal is displayed for information in the bottom plot of Fig 2. Strong peaks in interharmonics can be observed; these are notably due to the inappropriate spectral envelope. Note that the physiological origin of these interharmonic peaks would require further investigation. These issues should be alleviated in order to have a high-quality parametric representation of singing voice. First, the spectral weighting of the noisy component should either be based on appropriate aperiodicity measurements , HNR  or bandpass voicing strengths  in different spectral subbands, or involve the use of a dynamic Fmsubscript𝐹𝑚F_{m} whose values are estimated by a new algorithm specifically designed to overcome the first and third aforementioned problems. Secondly, conventional MGC extraction turns out to be inappropriate unless the cepstral order is dynamically adjusted according to F​0𝐹0F0, which is not practical when signals exhibit large F​0𝐹0F0 variations. Even considering spectral analysis techniques where the effect of harmonicity is eliminated before cepstral fitting    , the assumption of a harmonic or quasi-harmonic spectral structure may be insufficient for two main factors: (i) the low spectral resolution when F​0𝐹0F0 is high, which could result in poor spectral envelope estimation and inconsistent measurements between adjacent frames; (ii) the presence of the aforementioned interharmonic tones. The latter problem is ignored by current speech parameterization systems. However, its perceptual importance should be assessed in the context of singing voices. If this is revealed to be crucial, a vocoder offering the possibility to generate interharmonics and to deal with them during analysis should be developed.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: 6t​hsuperscript6𝑡ℎ6^{th} and 7t​hsuperscript7𝑡ℎ7^{th} harmonics (and even further) clearly emerge.
