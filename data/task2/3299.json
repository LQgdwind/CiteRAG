      "content": "Paper Title: Benchmarking of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Vision-based Robotics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVision-based Robots use visual feedback to guide their motion. The\nunderlying problem, also known as hand-eye coordination\n or visual servoing ,\nis considered to be difficult due to factors such as\nnon-linearity and uncertainty of camera and robot models, sensor\nnoise, mathematical complexity of extracting geometrical features from\nimages and difficulty in deriving closed-form analytical control\nequations in terms of these image features etc. Traditional model-based\nmethods addressed some of these concerns by adopting soft computing\napproaches  \n. The recent success of deep learning methods in\ncomputer vision has greatly enhanced the capabilities of these\nmodel-based methods \n \n. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a\nmodel-free alternative to solve this problem directly from\ninput-output data, thereby overcoming many of the above problems. It\nhas the potential to create truly autonomous agents that can learn\nskills on its own without needing human intervention. An RL agent learns the\ndesired behaviour, over time, through trial and error while repeatedly\ninteracting with its environment . The\nagent achieves this by taking actions to maximize the cumulative\ndiscounted future reward for a given task\nwhile balancing exploration (of new possibilities) and\nexploitation (of past experiences). This cumulative discounted\nreward function, represented as Q or value function, is used to\nevaluate a given action, and is not known a priori. Depending on how\nthis function is estimated and desirable actions are derived from it,\nthe RL-based methods can be broadly classified into two categories:\nvalue-based methods and policy-based methods.\nValue-based methods aim at estimating the Q-function and then derive\naction from this by using a greedy policy. On the other hand,\npolicy-based methods directly estimate the policy function by\nmaximizing a given objective function. The traditional Q-learning\nalgorithm estimates the Q function iteratively by using an\napproximate dynamic programming formulation based on Bellmanâ€™s\nequation starting from an initial estimate\n. The original Q-learning algorithm could\nbe applied to problems with discrete state (observation) and action\nspaces, and suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality problem\nwith higher dimensions and range of values. This limitation can be\novercome by using a deep network to estimate Q function from arbitrary\nobservation inputs, thereby, greatly enhancing the capabilities of RL\nalgorithms. The resulting approach is known as Deep Q Networks (DQN)\n8 5 which has been applied\nsuccessfully to a wide range of problems while achieving superhuman\nlevel performances in a few cases, such as ATARI video games\n, Go  etc. The\nsuccess of DQN has spawned a new research field known as deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) attracting a large following of\nresearchers. Readers are referred to  for a\nsurvey of this field. The DQN models were subsequently extended to\ncontinuous action spaces by using policy gradient methods that used a\nparameterized policy function to maximize DQN output using gradient\nascent methods 8\n. This has opened the doors for solving\nvarious robotics problems that use continuous values such as joint\nangle, joint velocities or motor torques as input. Since then, a\nnumber of methods have been proposed to improve the performance of RL\nalgorithms and have been applied successfully to different robotic\nproblems - manipulation  ,\ngrasping [ref]38 0, navigation\n0 etc. Since RL algorithms vary greatly in terms of model complexity, choice\nof hyper-parameters and architectures, it becomes necessary to\nbenchmark them against standard problems to assess their performances.\nOne such effort was made for a robotic grasp problem in\n[ref]38 where authors compared the performance of three\noff-policy methods including DDPG 8 on a\nsimulated Kuka environment created using PyBullet [ref]37. A\nsimilar benchmarking was done for continuous control problems in\n where authors compared the performance of\nseveral off-policy and on-policy methods on several simulated\nenvironments created using MuJoCo . A benchmarking of\nreinforcement learning algorithms on real-world robots was carried out\nin  that included algorithms such as\nTRPO 1 and PPO 3. The focus of this paper is to benchmark some of the newer deep\nreinforcement learning algorithms such as Soft Actor Critic (SAC)\n, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\n3 and Interpolated Policy Gradients (IPG)\n for solving vision-based robotic\nproblems in an end-to-end fashion. The problems used for this study\ninclude two PyBullet [ref]37 simulation environment, namely,\nKukaDiverseObject and RacecarZEDGym. Both\nenvironments provide observations in the form of RGB images and take\ncontinuous action inputs which makes these two problems more difficult\ncompared to the versions where observations are available as floating\npoint vectors. We then demonstrate that the performance of these\nalgorithms can be further improved by using Hindsight experience\nreplay (HER)  where the problem of\nsparse rewards is partially addressed by providing intermediate goals.\nHER is shown to be more effective for multi-goal problems such as\nMuJoCoâ€™s Fetch environment  or PyBulletâ€™s\nPanda robot 2. Both of these two environments\ndo not provide image observations making them unsuitable for this\nstudy. A number of strategies are proposed to provide intermediate\ngoals for the above two environments to facilitate implementation of\nHER algorithm and show improvement in performance achieved. Finally,\na number of architectures are presented to incorporate spatial and\ntemporal attention into the learning process. Attention mechanisms\n9 have been shown to improve the inference\ncapability of a model by focussing on relevant parts and ignoring the\nirrelevant parts of the input observation. While the application of\nattention in reinforcement learning is not new, it has not been\napplied to the context of vision-based robotics problems considered in\nthis paper. The performance improvement achieved by\nincorporating these concepts are demonstrated through rigorous\nsimulation experiments which will be discussed later in this paper. In short, the novel contributions made in this paper are as follows: A benchmarking of three RL algorithms, namely, SAC, PPO, IPG\nand their corresponding HER-variants have been carried out for two\nsimulated vision-based robotics problem. This is the first-time\nsuch an effort has been made for these two simulated PyBullet\nenvironments. Several strategies are proposed to implement HER algorithm on these two environments which are\nessentially single-goal problems and do not provide intermediate\ngoals. These ideas could be easily applied to other single-goal\nenvironments thereby extending the applicability of HER\nalgorithms. Several architectures are proposed for incorporating spatial\nand temporal attention during the feature extraction process\nleading to improved learning performance. Through experiments, it\nis established that stacked frames along with attention and LSTM\nlayers can provide superior learning performance. The application\nof attention in the present context of vision-based robotics is\nnew and has not been reported so far. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The details of RL model\narchitectures, algorithms and methods are discussed in Section\nIII. The details of experiments and analysis of results are\npresented in Section IV. The conclusion and direction of\nfuture research is provided in Section V.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: as input.
