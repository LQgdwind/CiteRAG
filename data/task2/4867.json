      "content": "Paper Title: Censored Deep Reinforcement Patrolling with Information Criterion for Monitoring Large Water Resources using Autonomous Surface Vehicles\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWater resources are fundamental to both human life and the economic development of communities. Large water bodies, such as rivers, reservoirs, and also lakes, are not only important for direct consumption but are the core of agriculture. Therefore, the conservation of these is vital for subsistence in many parts of the world. However, despite their importance, 80% of wastewater from cities and industries is discharged untreated into sea and rivers 111https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/water. This situation has dramatic consequences for ecosystems. A very frequent problem in situations of uncontrolled discharges of nutrients is the accelerated eutrophication of waters and the appearance of blue-green bacteria colonies. Whenever the water is nourished with ammonium and nitrites from agricultural fertilizers or human and animal fecal remains, large colonies of cyanobacteria emerge and populate the surface with a greenish mantle. The thick blooms prevent the sun from hitting the underwater flora, which is responsible for oxygenating the waters. As a result, the fish die of anoxia. Thus, the waters become muddy, with pestilential odors and a very poor quality for bathing, fishing, or human consumption. This is the situation in Lake Ypacaraí, Paraguay’s largest water resource. The lake, once a tourist enclave, is now populated by colonies of blue-green algae with all its consequences. The situation is similar in places like Mar Menor (Spain)  or Lake Erie (USA) . All these places have in common that they are very large extensions of water, and that it is difficult to obtain their updated contamination status, in terms of the relevant physico-chemical and water quality (WQ) variables (pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrites or ammonia concentration, etc.). Any solution to this contamination problem requires a comprehensive monitoring process. Monitoring is defined here as the sufficient and homogeneous collection of biological WQ data with which to form a physico-chemical model to serve as an early warning system for pollution peaks. However, this task is difficult due to the large extension size of the ecosystems under monitoring. Consequently, manual missions to measure the WQ are tedious and costly. Moreover, installing a fixed sensor grid is a suboptimal solution as sampling locations cannot be varied and multiple battery replacements could be even more expensive than human-conducted missions. The use of Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) equipped with WQ sensor modules has been gaining momentum lately for some similar applications (see Fig. 1) . These low-cost electric vehicles allow continuous sampling with routes that can be adapted according to various optimality criteria [ref]4. However, these robotic systems require intelligent perception and decision modules to perform monitoring tasks efficiently. When using these robots, aspects beyond information gathering have to be considered, such as physical battery limitations and nonnavigable terrain constraints. This transforms the monitoring problem into an Informative Path Planning (IPP) problem , which combines the challenge of obtaining the most informative path, and the compliance of ground restrictions and obstacle avoidance. This problem has been previously addressed for an wide set of applications: agricultural characterization , for the generation of water quality models , the search for gas leaks , or the location of contamination sources in radiological environments . Thus, it is presented as a current problem treated from multiple perspectives within engineering. Our approach can used without loss of generalization to these particular objectives, as the algorithm is model-free and the information formulation can be applied to the reality of these parameters under surveillance apart from the WQ measurement context. This paper addresses two cases: the static IPP, in which the variables are assumed to not change throughout a mission, and a temporal case, in which the variables to be measured can change during the mission. The latter case, which can be seen as an Informative Patrolling Path Planning (IPPP), gains importance when we want to measure eventual risks such as spills, new blooms or the time trend of certain pollution variables. This constitutes the base problem of detection and early warning of contamination hazards on long term missions. To deal with the aforementioned monitoring scenarios, a stochastic framework is defined as it models the information collected at each physical point by the ASV. Assuming that each possible point eligible to be sampled behaves as a Gaussian random variable p∈X∼𝒩​(μ,σ)𝑝𝑋similar-to𝒩𝜇𝜎p\\in X\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma), a spatial correlation matrix Σ​[X,Xm​e​a​s]Σ𝑋subscript𝑋𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠\\Sigma[X,X_{meas}] can be defined to model the statistic relationship between samples. This matrix indicates the level of uncertainty of each point, considering the locations where Xm​e​a​ssubscript𝑋𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠X_{meas} has been sampled. This approach makes use of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) to spatially correlate samples as a function of their adjacency, under the acceptable assumption that physically close samples will be more closely related. Given that, the IPP will consist of sequentially deciding the next physical point at which to take a sample, following the information gain maximization criterion. Following the Information Theory definition of information gain, Σ​[X,Xm​e​a​s]Σ𝑋subscript𝑋𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠\\Sigma[X,X_{meas}] defines how informative a point is according to the entropy decrease of the model formed by the set of points of the lake X𝑋X and the sample points Xm​e​a​ssubscript𝑋𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠X_{meas} [ref]9. Finally, the IPP problem to be solved here consists of minimizing the total entropy of the scenario H​[X|Xm​e​a​s]𝐻delimited-[]conditional𝑋subscript𝑋𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠H\\left[X|X_{meas}\\right]. The dimension of this sequential problem explodes when the routes are large and movement restrictions are included. In the case of Lake Ypacaraí, large distances must be covered for the routes to decrease optimally the entropy, so the possibilities of movement are almost infinite. In addition, it is necessary for the vehicle to have a reactive policy, capable of adapting to different boundary conditions, i.e., arbitrary route starting points and temporal dependencies. This work proposes the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to find an optimal policy, based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This convolutional network is able to interpret a graphical state of the problem and choose the next sample point according to a tailored reward function. This reward function should be designed to evaluate every action in terms of the information gathered. DRL techniques are useful because they do not require a prior model of the system and are able to adapt to a scenario with arbitrary boundary features through model-free interpretation of the state and reward function. These characteristics make DRL a suitable approach to solve the IPP and IPPP. Specifically, Deep Q-Learning (DQL) are applied here because of their ability to estimate the future reward given a state for each possible action in the possible set. To enhance the capability of the classical DQL algorithm, this paper further elaborates on the application of some useful techniques for this IPP problem, that have been proven effective in previous works of the DRL literature 0, but none in a path planning application: the use of a Prioritized Experienced Replay 1, a Dueling architecture in the Q neural network 2 and, finally, the use of noisy neural networks 3 to intrinsically motivate the exploration of the state-action domain. These publications revealed the high learning capacity of algorithms such as DQL. However, in the application of them to complex problems, there are hard constraints that are known a priori or can be computed in a deterministic way. A difference between the proposed approach and the previous ones is in using the deterministic knowledge of the navigation map to increase the sampling efficiency. This is effectively a slight departure from the initial model-free paradigm of DQL. However, we propose the use of a censoring mechanism that increases the sample efficiency because it provides accurate information on illegal actions that would otherwise have to be inferred by trial and error. This algorithm, the Censoring-DQL, takes the deterministic information of the environment related to the obstacle avoidance task, and provides a way to neglect those actions that incurs in violations of the hard-constraints in navigation. As far as we understand, there is no apparent compromise on learning convergence when this mechanism is used and, moreover, it results in improved training efficiency. The novelty of this work also lies in the formulation of the monitoring problem as a sequential entropy minimization process, using the principles of DRL: The problem is defined as a discrete Markov decision process (MDP) in which the objective is to maximize information acquisition with a finite planning horizon. Thus, it is proposed to use the information gain as the reward that reduces the total uncertainty under the assumption that the water quality parameters behave smoothly and as Gaussian random variables. As explained in 4, it is usually challenging to design the reward function to solve a real problem with as it must reflect the desires of the resulting behavior. In the particular IPP/IPPP case, this tailored reward function serves as a surrogate signal for a general objective: information acquisition, translated into model error reduction, maximal search, etc. This reward-engineering process contributes, to improve data collection systems and to obtain deep policies for decision making in the face of information uncertainty. With an appropriate definition of these learning parameters, the DRL is able to outperform previously proposed algorithms and heuristics, with more efficient and robust informative paths. In previous works, like in 5, the patrolling follows a criterion based on the area covered and not on the information, making the paths longer and more redundant. In addition, other similar algorithms, such as [ref]4, use paths from side to side of the edges, without considering interior paths that do not intersect. Another disadvantage of these heuristics is the inability to act online, since they base the optimization on a static criterion and, therefore, a single solution rather than a policy is obtained. In summary, the contributions of this work are: I) A model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning framework to solve the IPP and the IPPP in water monitoring scenarios using an entropy minimization criterion in stationary and nonstationary scenarios. II) The definition of a tailored reward function, a graphical state formulation, and a noisy CNN architecture for policy optimization that is effective in both the IPP and the IPPP scenario. This article is organized as follows: in Section 2, there is a brief survey of previous works and other techniques that address similar problems. In Section 3, Materials and Method, the IPP and IPPP problem is formally stated, the algorithm is presented, and the Deep Reinforcement Learning framework described. In Section 4, the results of the training are analyzed and discussed. Finally, Section 5 closes with the conclusions of this work and future lines of work.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: momentum lately for some similar applications (see Fig. 1) .
