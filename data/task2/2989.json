      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-Forecasting by combining Global Deep Representations with Local Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMeta-learning has received considerable attention in recent years and several models have been developed primarily for few-shot image classification. Notable examples are [ref]34 [ref]11  [ref]29  .\nThese methods work by adapting to the task at hand before making predictions. Differently from fine-tuning, this adaptation is performed also during a (meta) training procedure over a large set of tasks to learn the (meta) parameters of the model.\nHowever, realistic datasets with the high number of tasks needed by meta-learning methods are rare, hence in commonly used benchmarks like mini-imagenet , each classification task is constructed by randomly selecting a small set of classes and related images from a large single-task dataset. This construction is artificial and departs from real-world scenarios. Recently, the work by Tian et al.  showed that training a neural network on the original single-task dataset and fine-tuning only the last layer on new tasks outperforms many modern meta-learning methods for few-shot image classification.\nBy contrast, popular TS forecasting datasets like M4 fit more naturally into the meta-learning framework, since they already contain a large number of TS/tasks (up to 105superscript10510^{5} for M4). Our method relies on a differentiable closed-form solver to perform the local (or TS-specific) adaptation. Meta-learning is achieved by solving a task-specific ridge regression problem that maps a deep representation to the target TS in closed-form, while the parameters of the representation are learned by backpropagation through the solver.\nAside from the original application in few-shot image classification , differentiable closed-form solvers have been used for other few-shot problems like visual tracking , video object segmentation , spoken intent recognition  and spatial regression , while we are not aware of any application in forecasting. Meta-learning in the context of TS forecasting has originally been synonym with model selection or combination of experts (see e.g. Collopy and Armstrong , Lemke and Gabrys , Talagala et al. ). This class of methods builds a meta-model which uses TS features to select the best performing model or the best combination of models to apply to a target TS. One drawback of these methods is that the features are usually manually designed from the data at hand and that the same set of features does not transfer well to other applications. Laptev et al.  train an LSTM neural network  on the source TS dataset and then its last layers are fine-tuned separately on each target TS. This approach overcomes the problems related to human designed features since the input of the network are just the previous TS observations. However, retraining the last layers of the network for each TS can be expensive, especially when dealing with a large number of TS. Additionally, their fine-tuning procedure requires the selection of hyperparameters like learning rate and number of steps of the optimizer. By contrast, our approach adapts only the last linear layer in closed-form, requiring a small increase in compute and no additional hyperparameters compared to a standard neural forecasting model, while outperforming the simple fine tuning approach. More recently, the NBEATS model has shown strong performance\nboth in the standard  and in the meta-learning  setting. This multi-step ahead method uses a residual architecture  which takes past observations of a single TS as input and outputs point predictions over the whole forecast horizon. Thanks to the residual connections, a forward pass of the network allows it to implicitly adapt to the input out-of-sample TS. However, the final performance is achieved using a large ensemble and the number of parameters of the model is quite large even when the residual blocks share the same parameters.\nOur method, although also using ensembles, achieves good accuracy on out-of-sample TS forecasting with significantly less parameters. Finally, Iwata and Kumagai  consider the few-shot TS forecasting setting where each task is formed by a small group of closely related TS. Their method, which combines LSTMs and attention, uses the TS in the support set of the task to compute the one-step ahead forecasts for each TS in the query set. This is different from our approach, where we do not exploit the other TS in the target dataset to compute predictions and we view each TS as a separate task. Our method can be extended to the case considered by Iwata and Kumagai  by performing the closed-form adaptation on all the TS in the task instead of just on one. We leave this for future work.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: Meta-learning has received considerable attention in recent years and several models have been developed primarily for few-shot image classification.
