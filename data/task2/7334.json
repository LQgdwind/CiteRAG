      "content": "Paper Title: Deciding Subtyping for Asynchronous Multiparty Sessions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSession types were first introduced in binary form by Honda in 1993¬†.\nBinary session types describe interactions between two participants, and communication safety of binary sessions amounts to channel duality.\nBinary session types were generalized to multiparty session types ‚Äì describing interactions between more than two participants ‚Äì by Honda, Yoshida and Carbone in 2008¬†, and the corresponding notion of safety was generalized from duality to multiparty consistency.\nBinary session types were inspired by and enjoy a close connection to linear logic¬† [ref]49 .\nHorne generalizes this connection to multiparty session types and non-commutative extensions of linear logic¬†. The connection between multiparty session types and logic is also explored in   .\nMSTs have since been extensively studied and widely adopted in practical programming languages; we refer the reader to 9 for a comprehensive survey. Session type syntax.\nSession type frameworks have enjoyed various extensions since their inception.\nIn particular, the choice operator for both global and local types has received considerable attention over the years.\nMSTs were originally introduced as global types, with a directed choice operator that restricted a sender to sending different messages to the same recipient.  and  relax this restriction to sender-driven choice, which allows a sender to send different messages to different recipients, and increases the expressivity of global types. Our paper targets global types with sender-driven choice.\nFor local types, a direct comparison can be drawn to the œÄùúã\\pi-calculus, for which mixed choice was shown to be strictly more expressive than separate choice¬†.\nMixed choices allow both send and receive actions, whereas separate choices consist purely of either sends or receives.\n showed that any global type with sender-driven choice can be implemented by a CSM with only separate choice.\nMixed choice for binary local types was investigated in¬†, although¬† later showed that this variant falls short of the full expressive power of mixed choice œÄùúã\\pi-calculus, and instead can only express separate choice œÄùúã\\pi-calculus.\nOther communication primitives have also been studied, such as channel delegation¬†  , dependent predicates¬† , parametrization¬†  and data refinement¬†. Session type semantics.\nMSTs were introduced in¬† with a process algebra semantics. The connection to CSMs was established in¬†, which defines a class of CSMs whose state machines can be represented as local types, called Communicating Session Automata (CSA). CSAs inherit from the local types they represent restrictions on choice discussed above, ‚Äútree-like‚Äù restrictions on the structure (see¬† for a characterization), and restrictions on outgoing transitions from final states. The CSM implementation model in our work assumes none of the above restrictions, and is thus true to its name. Session subtyping.\nSession subtyping was first introduced by¬† in the context of the œÄùúã\\pi-calculus, which was in turn inspired by Pierce and Sangiorgi‚Äôs work on subtyping for channel endpoints¬†.\nThe session types literature distinguishes between two notions of subtyping based on the network assumptions of the framework: synchronous and asynchronous subtyping.\nBoth notions respect Liskov and Wing‚Äôs substitution principle¬†, but differ in the guarantees provided.\nWe discuss each in turn. Synchronous subtyping follows the notions of covariance and contravariance introduced by , and checks that a subtype contains fewer sends and more receives than its supertype.\nFor binary synchronous session types, Lange and Yoshida¬† show that subtyping can be decided in quadratic time via model checking of a characteristic formulae in the modal Œºùúá\\mu-calculus.\nFor multiparty synchronous session types, Ghilezan et al.¬† present a precise subtyping relation that is universally quantified over all contexts, and restricts the local type syntax to directed choice.\nAs mentioned in Section¬†1, , their subtyping relation is incomplete when generalized to asynchronous multiparty sessions with directed choice.\nAs discussed in Section¬†2, their subtyping relation is further incomplete when generalized to asynchronous multiparty sessions with mixed choice, due to the ‚Äúpeculiarity [‚Ä¶] that, apart from a pair of inactive session types, only inputs and outputs from/to a same participant can be related‚Äù¬†.\nThe complexity of the subtyping relation in¬† is not mentioned. Unlike subtyping relations for synchronous sessions which preserve language inclusion, subtyping relations for asynchronous sessions instead focus on deadlock-free optimizations that permute roles‚Äô local order of send and receive actions, also called asynchronous message reordering, or AMR¬†.\nFirst proposed for binary sessions by Mostrous and Yoshida¬†, and for multiparty sessions by Mostrous et al.¬†, this notion of subtyping does not satisfy subprotocol fidelity in general; indeed, in some cases, the set of behaviors recognized by a supertype is entirely disjoint from that of its subtype¬†.\nAsynchronous subtyping was shown to be undecidable for both binary and multiparty session types¬†[ref]35 .\nExisting works are thus either restricted to binary protocols [ref]35   , prohibit non-deterministic choice involving multiple receivers  , or make strong fairness assumptions on the network . The connection between session subtyping and behavioral contract refinement has been studied only in the context of binary session types, and is thus out of scope of our work. We refer the reader to¬† for a survey.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: Carbone in 2008¬†, and the corresponding notion of safety was generalized from duality to multiparty consistency.\nBinary session types were inspired by and enjoy a close connection to linear logic¬† [ref]49 .\nHorne generalizes this connection to multiparty session types and non-commutative extensions of linear logic¬†.
