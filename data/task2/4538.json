      "content": "Paper Title: Fairness Based Energy-Efficient 3D Path Planning of a Portable Access Point: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe works in - propose UAV trajectory design algorithms that either maximize communication-related parameters such as the coverage area and sum or average throughput or minimize the transmit power. The works mainly design a 2D trajectory or represent the 3D optimal UAV(s) positioning problems as two subproblems that optimize the vertical and horizontal positioning of the UAV(s) recurrently. Even though the problem formulations to maximize the energy-efficiency in -[ref]21 consider the aerial vehicle’s power consumption, the solutions are again 2D flight trajectories. \nPlease note that for an energy-limited system such as a PAP, maximizing the number of bits transmitted per Joule of energy consumed while ensuring user fairness is paramount. Maximizing the throughput for a given energy budget is different from maximizing the energy efficiency since each movement of the UAV should maximize the throughput and minimizes the energy consumption simultaneously. Moreover, a UAV consumes different power during its axial climb and forward flight modes. Neglecting this, as in [ref]15, [ref]19, and , falsely overestimates the air-time of a UAV resulting in the initiation of the early-landing procedure before completing the planned trajectory. Furthermore, [ref]15 and  propose trajectory planning and resource allocation schemes for high-mobility users in which the trajectory parameters and the resources are allocated to guarantee high instantaneous throughput fairness between all users. Even though the proposed fairness metric is ideal for analyzing the performance of the considered scenario, it might be sub-optimal for an IoT application such as data collection from an IoT network. For such applications, long-term fairness metrics are more suitable. For instance, consider a scenario in which the PAP is deployed to deliver a file of a given size to all the users by the end of the trajectory. In this case, the service fairness could be measured at the end of the trajectory; if all the users are delivered with an equal amount of bits on an average by the end of the trajectory, the fairness between the users will be high. Suppose the PAP flies near to a user in a given time instant. In that case, it is more efficient to allocate more resources to that user since the communication channel to the user, as well as the throughput, will improve. However, to guarantee a high long-term user fairness, the later segments of the trajectory should be closer to the remaining users. Finally, none of the above works consider the Peukert effect seen in Li-ion batteries that are typically used in UAVs. Neglecting the Peukert effect overestimates the air-time of the PAP, resulting in initiating the early-landing procedure before completing the planned trajectory. In practise, the PAP will be flying at different velocities resulting in different power consumption; hence the remaining air-time of the PAP varies after each action as a non-linear function of the power consumption. This affects the system’s energy efficiency since the number of trajectory segments varies as a non-linear function of the power consumption profile.\n\nIn essence, the 3D trajectory design of a PAP that maximizes the fairness-based energy efficiency while factoring in the UAV power consumption and the Peukert effect has, to the best of our knowledge, not yet been considered in the literature. The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows: We propose a method to model the non-linear Peukert effect of the PAP battery using the data points from a data sheet; We additionally propose an algorithm to estimate the air-time of a PAP by considering the Peukert effect and the PAP power consumption profile; We introduce a user fairness-based energy efficiency metric called the fair energy efficiency that considers user fairness, sum throughput, and the PAP propulsion power consumption; Finally, we implement a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3)- based 3D path planning algorithm to design a 3D trajectory for the PAP that maximizes the FEE value of the system. This paper is structured as follows: Section II explains the system setup, propagation environment, the 3D power consumption model of the PAP, and the FEE metric. In the section, we also detail the Peukert effect of the PAP battery and propose an algorithm to estimate the air-time of the PAP. Section III includes the problem formulation to maximize the FEE of the system and the solving methodology. Section IV presents the main findings through numerical evaluations, and elaborates the significance of the results. Finally, Section V summarizes the main findings of this work. All the quantities are in SI units unless otherwise specified.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: positioning problems as two subproblems that optimize the vertical and horizontal positioning of the UAV(s) recurrently.
