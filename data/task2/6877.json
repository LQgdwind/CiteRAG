      "content": "Paper Title: A2Q: Accumulator-Aware Quantization with Guaranteed Overflow Avoidance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuantization is the process of reducing the range and precision of the numerical representation of data.\nWhen applied to the weights and activations of neural networks, integer quantization reduces compute and memory requirements, usually in exchange for minor reductions in model accuracy 4 9  .\nDuring inference, most of the compute workload is concentrated in operators such as convolutions and matrix multiplications, whose products are typically accumulated into 32-bit registers that we refer to as accumulators.\nIt has been shown that reducing accumulators to 16 bits on CPUs and ASICs can increase inference throughput and bandwidth efficiency by up to 2x  , and reducing to 8 bits can improve energy efficiency by over 4x .\nHowever, exploiting such an optimization is highly non-trivial as doing so incurs a high risk of overflow.\nDue to wraparound two’s complement arithmetic, this can introduce numerical errors that degrade model accuracy . Previous works have sought to either reduce the risk of overflow [ref]25   or mitigate its impact on model accuracy .\nHowever, such approaches struggle to maintain accuracy when overflow occurs too frequently , and are unable to support applications that require guaranteed arithmetic correctness, such as finite-precision fully homomorphic encryption computations  .\nThus, we are motivated to avoid overflow altogether.\nAs the first principled approach to guarantee overflow avoidance, we provide theoretical motivation in Section 3, where we derive comprehensive accumulator bit width bounds with finer granularity than existing literature.\nIn Section 4, we present accumulator-aware quantization (A2Q); a novel method designed to train quantized neural networks (QNNs) to use low-precision accumulators during inference without any risk of overflow.\nIn Section 5, we show that our method not only prepares QNNs for low-precision accumulation, but also inherently increases the sparsity of the weights. While our results have implications for general-purpose platforms such as CPUs and GPUs, we primarily target model deployment on custom FPGA-based inference accelerators.\nFPGAs allow bit-level control over every part of a low-precision inference accelerator and can therefore take advantage of custom data types to a greater extent than general-purpose platforms, which are often restricted to power-of-2 bit widths.\nIn doing so, we show in Section 5 that reducing the bit width of the accumulator can in turn improve the overall trade-off between resource utilization and model accuracy for custom low-precision accelerators. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the use of low-precision accumulators to improve the design efficiency of FPGA-based QNN inference accelerators.\nAs such, we integrate A2Q into the open-source Brevitas quantization library  and FINN compiler  to demonstrate an end-to-end flow for training QNNs for low-precision accumulation and generating custom streaming architectures targeted for AMD-Xilinx FPGAs.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: risk of overflow.\nDue to wraparound two’s complement arithmetic, this can introduce numerical errors that degrade model accuracy .

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
