      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Scene Flow in 3D Point Clouds with Noisy Pseudo Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince our method does not use ground-truth scene flow, we mainly compare our method with state-of-the-art self-supervised methods including PointPWC, SelfPF  and FlowStep3D [ref]21. Tab. 1 also demonstrates the performance of recent representative supervised methods, which shows that our method even outperforms some state-of-art\nsupervised approaches e.g. [ref]26. Results on FT3D.\nThe FT3D dataset contains monocular images and point clouds.\nWe use monocular images and point clouds from the training data of FT3D dataset to generate pseudo scene flow labels for the point clouds. With those pseudo labels, we train our scene flow network on point clouds. We then evaluate the trained scene flow network on the testing point clouds of FT3D, following the same setting of existing methods  [ref]21. Tab. 1 shows our method outperforms all self-supervised methods in all evaluation metrics on the FT3D dataset. Compared with most recent self-supervised methods SelfPF and FlowStep3D, our method outperforms these methods on EPE3D by 49% and 32%.\nMoreover, the EPE3D value of our\nmethod is around 5cm, which is a large improvement over the self-supervised methods. Results on S-KITTI without Fine-tune.\nWe test our method on S-KITTI to evaluate the generalization ability of our method.\nFollowing existing methods  [ref]21 [ref]35, we train our scene flow model on FT3D, and then directly evaluate the model on S-KITTI without fine-tuning.\nAs shown in Tab. 1, our method achieves the highest performance in all metrics, compared with all self-supervised method, demonstrating that our method well generalizes to the S-KITTI dataset.\nOur method outperforms these state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. For example, the EPE3D of our method is below 0.06m.\nCompared with supervised methods, our method also achieves competitive performance, which are even on par with some supervised approaches [ref]26[ref]35. Results on real-world LiDAR dataset. L-KITTI is a real-world LiDAR dataset. We evaluate our method on L-KITTI to show the effectiveness of our method on real-world data. The ground-truth annotations of training data are unavailable on L-KITTI.\nThanks to the proposed pseudo label generation module, we can train our scene flow model on L-KITTI without ground-truth scene flows.\nIn contrast, since FLOT [ref]35 is a supervised method and cannot be trained without ground truth. We test the performance of FLOT by using its model trained on FT3D. Tab. 2 shows that our method achieves the best performance on L-KITTI. Due to large domain gap between FT3D and L-KITTI, the performance of FLOT [ref]35 is degraded.\nIn contrast, our method allows us to train on L-KITTI, achieving better performance.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Since our method does not use ground-truth scene flow, we mainly compare our method with state-of-the-art self-supervised methods including PointPWC, SelfPF  and FlowStep3D [ref]21. Tab. 1 also demonstrates the performance of recent representative supervised methods, which shows that our method even outperforms some state-of-art\nsupervised approaches e.g. [ref]26.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
