Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: LEIA: Linguistic Embeddings for the Identification of Affect\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA number of existing works learn representations for affective tasks.\nDeepMoji  is a neural network trained for predicting emoji in tweets using a large distant-labeled dataset considering 64 emojis as labels.\nSentiment-specific word embeddings [ref]26 encode sentiment information into the vector representation of words for sentiment analysis.\nSentiment-aware language representation learning (SentiLARE) [ref]27 incorporates part-of-speech and word polarity to enhance representation learning of a contextual language model for sentiment analysis tasks.\nAnother effective strategy in several natural language processing tasks is to pre-train transformer models on a large collection of text and then fine-tune the model for other downstream tasks [ref]28, including tasks in the social media domain  . In this strategy, the adaptation step often relies on the masked language modeling objective where random tokens are masked and the model is trained to predict the masked tokens. Alternative masking strategies have been proposed to improve the pre-training task either by masking important words  or masking words relevant for a given downstream task.\nRecently, emotion masked language modeling (eMLM) was proposed in  to preferentially mask emotion words for contextual language representation learning. Similar to SentiLARE, eMLM also relied on existing lexical resources by masking emotional words more frequently when training a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model from scratch, yielding improvements in downstream affect-related tasks. Motivated by these results, we employ eMLM in the design of LEIA as we explain below.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: for affective tasks.\nDeepMoji  is a neural network trained for predicting emoji in tweets using a large distant-labeled dataset considering 64 emojis as labels.\nSentiment-specific word embeddings [ref]26 encode sentiment information into the vector representation of words for sentiment analysis.\nSentiment-aware language representation learning (SentiLARE) [ref]27 incorporates part-of-speech\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
