Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Mask Guided Matting via Progressive Refinement Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare the results with state-of-the-art trimap-based methods DIM [ref]41, GCA [ref]24, IndexNet , Context-Aware Matting , and trimap-free method Late Fusion Matting  which is trained on Composition-1k training set and an additional portrait dataset. The results of baselines are obtained through either the open-source inference demos or the provided pre-trained weights. We summarize the results in Table 5 under two settings: Whole Image, where the errors are calculated across the whole image, which can measure the overall quality; Details, where the errors are calculated only in manual-labeled regions containing hair details or other soft areas. Compared to other methods, our model achieves a superior performance, especially regarding to the detail part, which illustrates its ability to capture the boundary details. We also note that the trimap-free method LFM performs badly, which could be caused by the fact that their portrait training data is not diverse enough and thus limits the the generalizability of their model (see Fig. 5 for examples). We compare our results with another trimap-free method BSHM [ref]27. We contacted the authors and obtained the test results on a 100 images subset of our portrait dataset. Since [ref]27 can only deal with low-resolution images, we downsample images to longer-side 720720720, and the metrics are also computed on this scale. [ref]27 achieves MSE 0.01550.01550.0155 and SAD 10.6610.6610.66 for whole image and MSE 0.09100.09100.0910 and SAD 7.607.607.60 for detail regions, while our MG Matting obtains a superior performance with MSE 0.00950.00950.0095 and SAD 8.018.018.01 for whole image and MSE 0.06370.06370.0637 and SAD 5.945.945.94 for details. Robustness to Guidance. To verify how robust our model is to the external guidance mask, we conduct an experiments to feed the network with perturbed external guidance mask. Particularly, we erode/dilate the mask with kernel size 101010, 202020, 303030 respectively. We note that the model predict consistently given differently perturbed external guidance. The SAD error increases from 26.826.826.8 to 27.127.127.1, 27.227.227.2, 27.427.427.4 with mask eroded by 101010, 202020, and 303030 respectively. For dilation, the SAD error goes to 27.027.027.0, 27.427.427.4, 28.128.128.1 with kernel 101010, 202020, 303030 respectively. A visual example is provided in Fig. 6.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: We compare the results with state-of-the-art trimap-based methods DIM [ref]41, GCA [ref]24, IndexNet , Context-Aware Matting , and trimap-free method Late Fusion Matting  which is trained on Composition-1k training set and an additional portrait dataset.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
