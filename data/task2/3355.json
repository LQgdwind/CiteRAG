      "content": "Paper Title: Communication-Efficient Stochastic Zeroth-Order Optimization for Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe study of FL started from the seminal work , where the authors proposed a communication-efficient federated optimization algorithm known as FedAvg. Subsequently, various articles established convergence guarantees for the FedAvg algorithm 1 2 3.\nFollowing the FedAvg algorithm, many other first-order methods have been proposed, e.g., FedPD , FedNova , FedProx 4, SCAFFOLD 5, and FedSplit 6.\nTo further reduce the communication overhead, several second-order optimization algorithms were proposed, such as FedDANE  and GIANT 7. Although the aforementioned first- and second-order algorithms have broad applications, there are still many FL tasks where the gradient and Hessian information are unavailable and thus require zeroth-order optimization. Recently, several works [ref]10 8 9     focused on studying distributed zeroth-order optimization.\nSpecifically, the authors in 8 developed a so-called ZONE-S algorithm based on the primal-dual technique.\nIn 9, the authors employed the gradient tracking technique to develop a fast distributed zeroth-order algorithm.\nHowever, ZONE-S requires 𝒪​(T)𝒪𝑇\\mathcal{O}\\left(T\\right) (T𝑇T denotes the number of total iterations) sampling complexity per iteration while the algorithm proposed in 9 considered the deterministic setting.\nMore recently, the authors in [ref]10 proposed an algorithm with 𝒪​(1)𝒪1\\mathcal{O}\\left(1\\right) sampling complexity per iteration, which attains linear speedup in the number of edge devices.\n proposed a decentralized zeroth-order algorithm that allows multiple local updates. However, the theoretic analysis in  focused on the strongly convex scenario and relied on the Lipschitzness of local functions, which is relatively restrictive .\nThe authors in  proposed and analyzed a distributed zeroth-order Frank-Wolfe algorithm for constrained optimization. Based on single-point and Kiefer-Wolfowitz type gradient estimators, the authors in   proposed two distributed zeroth-order algorithms over time-varying graphs.\nIt is worth noting that the aforementioned works mainly consider the peer-to-peer architecture while the studies on the central-server-based architecture are very limited.\nMoreover, most of the existing distributed zeroth-order algorithms focused on full device participation, which may not be practical for FL systems with limited radio resources and a large number of edge devices 2. AirComp has recently been adopted to support the implementation of FL over wireless networks     [ref]38 , where channel fading and receiver noise inevitably distort the model aggregation, and in turn introduce a detrimental impact on the learning performance .\nThe convergence behavior of various FL algorithms, e.g., vanilla gradient method  and stochastic gradient method , showed that the channel fading and noise perturbation typically introduce a non-diminishing optimality gap, which can be mitigated by transmit power control , beamforming design , and device scheduling .\nIn [ref]38, the authors proposed a joint learning and transmission scheme to ensure global convergence for strongly convex problems. By utilizing the communication strategy in [ref]38, the authors in  developed an AirComp-assisted accelerated gradient descent algorithm.\nDespite the above progress, the existing works focused on the first-order method, while there is no relevant literature studying the AirComp-assisted zeroth-order optimization algorithm.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: algorithms have broad applications, there are still many FL tasks where the gradient and Hessian information are unavailable and thus require zeroth-order optimization.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
