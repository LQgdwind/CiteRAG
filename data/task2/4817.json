      "content": "Paper Title: GAN you hear me? Reclaiming unconditional speech synthesis from diffusion models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe start by distinguishing what we call unconditional speech synthesis to the related but different task of generative spoken language modeling (GSLM).\nIn GSLM, a large autoregressive language model is typically trained on some discrete units\n(e.g.¬†HuBERT¬† clusters or clustered spectrogram features),\nsimilar to how a language model is trained on text¬†[ref]19 .\nWhile this also enables the generation of speech without any conditioning input, GSLM implies a\nmodel structure consisting of an encoder to discretize speech,\na language model, and a decoder .\nThis means that during generation, you are bound by the discrete units in the model.\nE.g.,\nit is not possible to interpolate between two utterances in a latent space\nor to directly\ncontrol speaker characteristics during generation.\nIf this is desired, additional components must be explicitly built into the model¬†. In contrast, in unconditional speech synthesis we\ndo not assume any knowledge of particular aspects of speech beforehand.\nInstead of using some intermediate discretization step, such models typically\nuse noise to directly generate speech,\noften via some latent representation.\nThe latent space should ideally be disentangled,\nallowing for modelling and control of the generated speech.\nIn contrast to GSLM, the synthesis model should learn to disentangle without being explicitly designed\nto control specific speech characteristics.\nIn some sense this is a more challenging task than GSLM, which is why most unconditional speech synthesis models are still evaluated on short utterances of isolated spoken words¬†[ref]1 (as we also do here). Within\nunconditional speech synthesis,\na substantial body of work focuses on either autoregressive  models ‚Äì generating a current sample based on previous outputs ‚Äì\nor diffusion models¬†.\nDiffusion models iteratively de-noise a\nsampled signal into a\nwaveform through a Markov chain with a constant number of steps¬†.\nAt each inference step, the original noise signal is slightly de-noised until ‚Äì in the last step ‚Äì it resembles coherent speech.\nAutoregressive and diffusion\nmodels\nare\nrelatively slow\nbecause they require\nrepeated forward passes through the\nmodel during inference. Earlier studies¬†[ref]1 [ref]10\nattempted\nto use\nGANs  for unconditional speech synthesis, which has the advantage of requiring only a single pass through the model.\nWhile\nresults showed some initial promise, performance was poor\nin terms of speech quality and\ndiversity, with the more recent diffusion models performing much better¬†.\nHowever, there have been substantial improvements in GAN-based modelling for image synthesis\nin the intervening years¬†  .\nOur goal is to\nimprove the performance of the earlier GAN-based unconditional speech synthesis models by adapting\nlessons from these recent image synthesis studies. Some of these\ninnovations in GANs\nare\nmodality-agnostic:\nR1subscriptùëÖ1R_{1} regularization  and\nexponential moving\naveraging\nof generator weights  can be directly transferred from the vision domain to speech.\nOther techniques, such as the\ncarefully designed anti-aliasing filters between layers in StyleGAN3 \nrequire specific adaptation;\nin contrast to images, there is little meaningful information in speech below 300¬†Hz,\nnecessitating a redesign of the anti-aliasing filters. In a very related research direction, Begu≈°¬† [ref]10 has been studying how GAN-based unconditional speech synthesis models internally perform lexical and phonological learning, and how this relates to human learning.\nThese studies, however, have been relying on the older GAN synthesis models.\nWe hope that by developing better performing GANs for unconditional speech synthesis, such investigations\nwill also be improved.\nRecently,  attempted to directly use StyleGAN2 for conditional and\nunconditional synthesis of emotional vocal bursts.\nThis further motivates a reinvestigation of GANs, but here we look specifically at the generation of speech rather than paralinguistic sounds.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: GSLM, a large autoregressive language model is typically trained on some discrete units\n(e.g.¬†HuBERT¬† clusters or clustered spectrogram features),\nsimilar to how a language model is trained on text¬†[ref]19 .\nWhile this also enables the generation of speech without any conditioning input, GSLM implies a\nmodel structure consisting of an encoder to discretize speech,\na language model, and a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
