      "content": "Paper Title: An Interpretive Constrained Linear Model for ResNet and MgNet\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis paper focuses on providing mathematical insight into deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) models that have been successfully\napplied in many machine learning and artificial intelligence areas\nsuch as computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement\nlearning¬†.\nExamples of CNN models include the LeNet-5 model presented by LeCun et al. in\n1998¬†[ref]31, the AlexNet model by Hinton et al. in 2012\n, the residual network (ResNet) by He et\nal. in 2015¬†, pre-act ResNet in\n2016¬†, MgNet in 2019¬†, and other variants of CNN   [ref]22.\nAmong these CNN models, ResNet and pre-act ResNet are of\nspecial theoretical and practical interest.\nIn fact, researchers have taken many steps to advance the field‚Äôs theoretical understanding of ResNet, to explain how and why it works well, and to design better residual-type architecture based on empirical observations and informal\ninterpretation       [ref]22.\nMost of the works mentioned here focus on the interpretation of the basic block in ResNet. However, some fine structures of ResNet and MgNet remain unclear. For example, how do we interpret the convolutional kernels, what is the role of the activation function, and how do we explain the pooling operations? For the explanation of pooling operations in particular, as far as we are aware, almost no literature provides deep insights from a mathematical viewpoint. Given the natural multi-scale (multi-resolution) structure and the residual correction iterative scheme in multigrid methods¬†  [ref]53, we were inspired and motivated to interpret MgNet and ResNet architecture (the whole feature extraction process including pooling layers) from the multigrid and iterative methods perspectives. We propose a generic mathematical model underlying the\nbasic blocks of ResNet and MgNet to demonstrate their dual relation and\nunderstand how they function.\nAt the core of our model is the following assumption: there is a data-feature\nmapping where Aùê¥A is understood as the underlying data-feature mapping to be learned and in practice is implemented as a conversational kernel with multi-channel. In addition, fùëìf is the data such as images and\nuùë¢u is the feature tensor such that Feature extraction is then viewed as an iterative procedure\n(c.f. ) to solve (1.1): This is a typical residual correction iterative scheme for solving (1.1), where BisuperscriptùêµùëñB^{i} is called the smoother which is also implemented as a conversational kernel with multi-channel in this work.\nUsing, for example, the special activation function œÉ‚Äã(x)=ReLU‚Äã(x):=max‚Å°{0,x}‚â•0ùúéùë•ReLUùë•assign0ùë•0\\sigma(x)={\\rm ReLU}(x):=\\max\\{0,x\\}\\geq 0, the above iterative process can be naturally modified to\npreserve the constraint\n(1.2): This forms the basic block of MgNet, precisely as in¬†.\npartial differential equations (PDEs)¬† [ref]53,\nwe introduce this residual Now, the iterative process (1.4) can be written, in terms of the residual risuperscriptùëüùëñr^{i} as: The iterative scheme¬†(1.6) shares an almost identical structure with the basic block architecture of pre-act ResNet. Then, the analysis process shown above will be used to understand pre-act ResNet and to develop modified ResNet and pre-act ResNet models in this paper. Furthermore, by drawing on the multigrid¬†  idea to restrict the residuals, we have a natural explanation for pooling operations in pre-act ResNet, which provides a basis for establishing a complete connection between pre-act ResNet and MgNet.\nFinally, we present numerical evidence to demonstrate that our constrained linear models (1.1) and (1.2) with the nonlinear iterative solver (1.4) or (1.6) provide a second interpretation and improvement on ResNet- and MgNet-type models. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: A constrained linear data-feature mapping is proposed and developed as an interpretable model to demonstrate the dual relation between ResNet- and MgNet-type models. Some natural modifications of ResNet-type models based on the constrained linear data-feature mapping are proposed. A general data-feature iterative scheme based on constrained linear data-feature mapping is proposed to show the rationality of MgNet. A systematic numerical study of MgNet is proposed to show its success in image classification problems and demonstrate its advantages over established networks in this context. This paper is organized as follows. In Section¬†2,\nwe review some related works. In Section¬†3, we introduce\nprecise mathematical formulas to define ResNet-type and MgNet models.\nIn Section¬†4, we propose the constrained linear data-feature mapping model to understand ResNet and MgNet architecture from the perspective of solving the constrained linear system based on theoretical observations and analysis. Then, we develop some modified ResNet models based on the constrained linear data-feature mapping presented. Finally, we propose a general data-feature iterative model to further demonstrate the rationality of MgNet.\nIn Section¬†5, we demonstrate the validity of\nthe constrained linear data-feature mapping assumption by comparing our modified ResNet-type models with the established ResNet-type models. In addition, we provide a systematic numerical study on MgNet. In Section¬†6, we offer some concluding remarks, including a brief discussion of the implications of the results reported herein and the investigative directions that can advance this research.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: artificial intelligence areas\nsuch as computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement\nlearning¬†.\nExamples of CNN models include the LeNet-5 model presented by LeCun et al. in\n1998¬†[ref]31, the AlexNet model by Hinton et al. in 2012\n, the residual network (ResNet) by He et\nal. in 2015¬†, pre-act ResNet in\n2016¬†, MgNet in 2019¬†, and other variants of CNN   [ref]22.\nAmong these\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
