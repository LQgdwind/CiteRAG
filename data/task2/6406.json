Interventional SHAP seems the method of choice when a loan applicant wants to see what features directly increase their likelihood of being granted a loan. If we want to know more about the natural mechanism of gene expression in a patient with a type of blood cancer, the conditional SHAP value is preferred and identified more of the true underlying variables. They call this approach ‘true to the data’. In contrast with this paper, no attempt to unify both types of SHAP values was undertaken. Similar to our contribution, [ref]8 decomposes the causal Shapley value into a direct and indirect effect and applies the decomposition to a theoretical example to show how different causal graphs result in different Shapley values. They do not provide a possible implementation and neither do they motivate using the decomposition in practice. Here we interpret this decomposition as a unification of conditional and interventional SHAP, and provide an implementation and illustrations to increase the understanding of the method. Furthermore we compare it with other state-of-the art Shapley implementations. Shapley residuals  can capture limitations of regular Shapley value implementations. They are represented by residual vectors risubscript𝑟𝑖r_{i} measuring how distant all contributions for specific S𝑆S (ϕi,Ssubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖𝑆\\phi_{i,S}) are from the contributions of the nearest inessential game. In an inessential game every player (in case of machine learning a feature value) contributes a fixed amount to the objective regardless of S𝑆S. As shown in  the contributions of the nearest inessential game are the actual Shapley values (ϕi,S=ϕisubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖𝑆subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖\\phi_{i,S}=\\phi_{i}). In case of conditional SHAP value, Shapley residuals quantify the effect of dependent features. Specifically, it is argued that the norm of risubscript𝑟𝑖r_{i} relates to the effect of dependencies between feature i𝑖i and other features on the SHAP value. For interventional SHAP values, the residuals capture effects of feature interactions in the model (e.g. of the term X1​X2subscript𝑋1subscript𝑋2X_{1}X_{2} in model f​(X1,X2)=X1+X2+X1​X2𝑓subscript𝑋1subscript𝑋2subscript𝑋1subscript𝑋2subscript𝑋1subscript𝑋2f(X_{1},X_{2})=X_{1}+X_{2}+X_{1}X_{2}). Explaining such feature interaction (also see Shapley-Interaction interaction indices [ref]21) is not the interest of this paper.  also design a Shapley value implementation that provides a more involved explanation when dependencies between input features exist. In fact, they assign a contribution to every causal link (or edge in causal graph) while still adhering to the fundamental axioms described in Section 2.1. A connection with conditional SHAP is made but interventional SHAP values are not discussed. Similarly to causal Shapley values [ref]8 a causal graph over the features is required. Another important difference between interventional and conditional SHAP values is that the former evaluates the machine learning model on out of distribution samples. Intervening on feature values results in samples which do not represent the underlying data distribution (also called off-manifold). It is shown that this allows for adversarial attacks that can manipulate explanations to hide unwanted model biases . While we acknowledge this issue, interventions still provide important insight into model as motivated in our introduction (e.g. for bias detection) and in [ref]4. For more information on the off-manifold problem we direct the reader to  . In this paper, the focus will be on the meaningful usage and desired theoretic properties of SHAP values, and not on their robustness or efficiency.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Recently [ref]4 also suggested the same distinction as described in our introduction and motivate each of the approaches with a use case.
