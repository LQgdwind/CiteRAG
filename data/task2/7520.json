      "content": "Paper Title: The Seeker’s Dilemma: Realistic Formulation and Benchmarking for Hardware Trojan Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHT detection methods can be categorized based on their dependence on a golden model. If security engineers have access to a golden model or its specification, they will look for any deviations in the functionality of the devices from the expected standard behavior. Chakraborty et al.  introduced MERO, a test vector generator for detecting HTs by stimulating rare-active nets multiple times. While it performs well against small circuits with rare triggers, its detection rate diminishes significantly as the circuit size increases. Lyu and Mishra introduced TARMAC , which maps the trigger activation problem to the clique cover problem and uses a SAT-solver to generate test vectors for each maximal satisfiable clique. Though it performs well, it lacks scalability and stability, and the implementation is not readily available for researchers  1. TGRL  is a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for hardware Trojan detection that uses a reward function to encourage activating as many rare nets as possible. Despite showing higher detection rates than MERO and TARMAC, it was not tested on any HT benchmarks. Sarihi et al.  proposed an RL-based multi-criteria HT detector that employs a tunable rewarding function. The authors generate test vectors utilizing three different rewarding functions and combine these detectors to enhance the ultimate detection accuracy . DETERRENT [ref]7 is another RL-based detection method that efficiently finds the smallest set of test vectors to activate multiple combinations of trigger nets. However, it focuses solely on signal-switching activities. It uses a SAT-solver to check compatibility, and its target detection domain is limited. Machine learning (ML) approaches have also been used extensively towards HT detection    9 when golden models are not available. Hasegawa et al.  proposed a random forest classifier trained on 51 circuit features extracted from Trusthub benchmarks to detect HTs. However, the method suffers from bias due to limited training data. HW2VEC  is a tool that converts hardware designs into other structures (i.e., dataflow graphs and abstract syntax trees) to extract structural features. The extracted features train a GNN (Graph Neural Network) for HT detection with a set of HT-free and HT-infected Trusthub circuits. COTD  uses unsupervised clustering analysis to detect HTs. The tool extracts “Sandia Controllability/Observability Analysis Program” SCOAP  parameters for each net and clusters circuits into HT-free and HT-infected. Notably, the mentioned tools depend on a single HT benchmark known as Trusthub, which limits the confidence about the performance of the methods on other datasets 1 0.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: a tunable rewarding function. The authors generate test vectors utilizing three different rewarding functions and combine these detectors to enhance the ultimate detection accuracy . DETERRENT [ref]7 is another RL-based detection method that efficiently finds the smallest set of test vectors to activate multiple combinations of trigger nets. However, it focuses solely on signal-switching\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
