      "content": "Paper Title: Communication-Efficient Stochastic Zeroth-Order Optimization for Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe first characterize the convergence of the FedZO algorithm with full device participation in Theorem 1.\nWe take the squared gradient ‖∇f​(𝒙t)‖2superscriptnorm∇𝑓superscript𝒙𝑡2\\|\\nabla f(\\bm{x}^{t})\\|^{2} to evaluate the suboptimality of the iterates.\nThe speed of approaching a stationary point is an important metric to evaluate the algorithmic effectiveness for non-convex problems .

Please refer to Appendix -A. ∎ According to Theorem 1, the upper bound of the minimum squared gradient among the global model sequence is composed of four terms. The first term shows that the optimality gap relies on the initial optimality.\nThe second term shows that the optimality gap depends on the the non-i.i.d. extent of the local data distribution.\nThe rest of the terms are related to step size μ𝜇\\mu for computing the gradient estimator that is unique in zeroth-order optimization. As pointed out in , we can select an appropriate step size to attain the desired accuracy.\nThe following corollary follows by substituting a suitable learning rate η𝜂\\eta and step size μ𝜇\\mu into Theorem 1. Suppose Assumptions 1-4 hold and let b1​b2≤dsubscript𝑏1subscript𝑏2𝑑b_{1}b_{2}\\leq d,\nμ=(d​b1​b2​N​H​T)−14𝜇superscript𝑑subscript𝑏1subscript𝑏2𝑁𝐻𝑇14\\mu=(db_{1}b_{2}NHT)^{-\\frac{1}{4}},\nand η=(N​b1​b2)12​(d​H​T)−12𝜂superscript𝑁subscript𝑏1subscript𝑏212superscript𝑑𝐻𝑇12\\eta=(Nb_{1}b_{2})^{\\frac{1}{2}}(dHT)^{-\\frac{1}{2}},\nwhich holds for (7) if T𝑇T is large enough.\nThe FedZO algorithm with full device participation satisfies where the right hand side of (1) is dominated by 𝒪​(d12​(N​H​T​b1​b2)−12)𝒪superscript𝑑12superscript𝑁𝐻𝑇subscript𝑏1subscript𝑏212\\mathcal{O}\\left(d^{\\frac{1}{2}}{(NHTb_{1}b_{2})}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right). We consider the case of b1​b2≤dsubscript𝑏1subscript𝑏2𝑑b_{1}b_{2}\\leq d in Corollary 1 since the dimension d𝑑d is generally very large in many ML tasks. Besides, when b1​b2≤dsubscript𝑏1subscript𝑏2𝑑b_{1}b_{2}\\leq d, the computational consumption of (5) is lower than that of the Kiefer-Wolfowitz type scheme .\nOn the other hand, if b1​b2>dsubscript𝑏1subscript𝑏2𝑑b_{1}b_{2}>d, η=N12​(H​T)−12𝜂superscript𝑁12superscript𝐻𝑇12\\eta=N^{\\frac{1}{2}}(HT)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}, and μ=d−12​(N​H​T)−14𝜇superscript𝑑12superscript𝑁𝐻𝑇14\\mu=d^{-\\frac{1}{2}}(NHT)^{-\\frac{1}{4}}, according to Theorem 1, we obtain a convergence rate 𝒪​((N​H​T)−12)𝒪superscript𝑁𝐻𝑇12\\mathcal{O}\\left({(NHT)}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right) for the FedZO algorithm which is independent of dimension d𝑑d. Such a convergence rate is the same as that of the FedAvg algorithm.\nThe learning rate of the zeroth-order methods is generally d−limit-from𝑑\\sqrt{d}-times smaller than that of their first-order counterparts [ref]21  , as the two-point gradient estimator is less accurate than the gradient. In our work, by adopting the mini-batch-type gradient estimator, we can increase the mini-batch sizes b1subscript𝑏1b_{1} and b2subscript𝑏2b_{2} to enhance the accuracy of the gradient estimator and also balance the effects of d𝑑d and T𝑇T on the learning rate. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm\n\nConvergence rate\nMaximum value of H𝐻H\n\n\n\nFL setting\n\n\n\nFedZO\n\nO​(d/N​H​T​b1​b2)𝑂𝑑𝑁𝐻𝑇subscript𝑏1subscript𝑏2\\quad O\\!\\left(\\sqrt{d/NHTb_{1}b_{2}}\\right)\nmin⁡{𝒪​((d​T)13​(b1​b2)−13​N−1),𝒪​(T​N−1)}𝒪superscript𝑑𝑇13superscriptsubscript𝑏1subscript𝑏213superscript𝑁1𝒪𝑇superscript𝑁1\\min\\left\\{\\mathcal{O}\\left((dT)^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\left(b_{1}b_{2}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{3}}N^{-1}\\right),\\mathcal{O}\\left(TN^{-1}\\right)\\right\\}\n\n\n\n\nFedAvg [ref]21\n\nO​(1/N​H​T)𝑂1𝑁𝐻𝑇O\\!\\left(\\sqrt{1/NHT}\\right)\nO​(T13​N−1)𝑂superscript𝑇13superscript𝑁1O\\!\\left(T^{\\frac{1}{3}}N^{-1}\\right)\n\n\n\nDistributed zeroth-order\n\n\n\nZONE-S \n\nO​(d3/T)𝑂superscript𝑑3𝑇O\\!\\left(d^{3}/T\\right)\n—\n\n\n\n\nDZOPA [ref]10\n\nO​(d/N​T)𝑂𝑑𝑁𝑇O\\!\\left(\\sqrt{d/NT}\\right)\n—\n\n\n\nCentralized zeroth-order\n\n\n\nZO-SGD \n\nO​(d/T)𝑂𝑑𝑇O\\!\\left(\\sqrt{d/T}\\right)\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: T𝑇T denotes the number of total communication rounds for FedZO and FedAvg, and\n\nthe number of total iterations for others.\n\n\n In Corollary 1, we set the learning rate η=(N​b1​b2)12​(d​H​T)−12𝜂superscript𝑁subscript𝑏1subscript𝑏212superscript𝑑𝐻𝑇12\\eta=(Nb_{1}b_{2})^{\\frac{1}{2}}(dHT)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}, which decreases as the number of local updates (i.e., H𝐻H) increases. In particular, the progress of one local update shrinks by 1/H1𝐻1/\\sqrt{H}. However, by performing H𝐻H steps of local updates, we obtain a H𝐻\\sqrt{H}-times speedup per communication round. This accords with the derived convergence rate 𝒪​(d12​(N​H​T​b1​b2)−12)𝒪superscript𝑑12superscript𝑁𝐻𝑇subscript𝑏1subscript𝑏212\\mathcal{O}\\left(d^{\\frac{1}{2}}{(NHTb_{1}b_{2})}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right). According to Corollary 1, to reach an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-stationary solution, the FedZO algorithm takes 𝒪​(d​(N​b1​b2)−1​ϵ−2)𝒪𝑑superscript𝑁subscript𝑏1subscript𝑏21superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\mathcal{O}\\left(d(Nb_{1}b_{2})^{-1}\\epsilon^{-2}\\right) iterations (i.e., H​T=𝒪​(d​(N​b1​b2)−1​ϵ−2)𝐻𝑇𝒪𝑑superscript𝑁subscript𝑏1subscript𝑏21superscriptitalic-ϵ2HT=\\mathcal{O}\\left(d(Nb_{1}b_{2})^{-1}\\epsilon^{-2}\\right)) with learning rate η=(N​b1​b2)12​(d​H​T)−12𝜂superscript𝑁subscript𝑏1subscript𝑏212superscript𝑑𝐻𝑇12\\eta=(Nb_{1}b_{2})^{\\frac{1}{2}}(dHT)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}. If we increase H𝐻H, then the learning rate (i.e., η𝜂\\eta) decreases, and we can attain a higher-accuracy solution with the same number of communication rounds (i.e., T𝑇T).\nBesides, when the total iteration number (i.e., H​T𝐻𝑇HT) and the learning rate (i.e., η𝜂\\eta) are fixed, we can increase the number of local iterations (i.e., H𝐻H) and reduce the number of communication rounds (i.e., T𝑇T) to reach the same accuracy, which enhances the communication efficiency. It is worth noting that the number of local iterations cannot be arbitrarily large.\nAccording to (7), to achieve the largest reduction in communication overhead while preserving convergence, the optimal value of H𝐻H is min⁡{𝒪​((d​T)13​(b1​b2)−13​N−1),𝒪​(T​N−1)}𝒪superscript𝑑𝑇13superscriptsubscript𝑏1subscript𝑏213superscript𝑁1𝒪𝑇superscript𝑁1\\min\\left\\{\\mathcal{O}\\left((dT)^{\\frac{1}{3}}(b_{1}b_{2})^{-\\frac{1}{3}}N^{-1}\\right),\\mathcal{O}\\left(TN^{-1}\\right)\\right\\}. From Corollary 1, we notice that the proposed FedZO algorithm can attain convergence rate 𝒪​(d12​(N​H​T​b1​b2)−12)𝒪superscript𝑑12superscript𝑁𝐻𝑇subscript𝑏1subscript𝑏212\\mathcal{O}\\left(d^{\\frac{1}{2}}{(NHTb_{1}b_{2})}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right). In particular, FedZO achieves linear speedup in terms of the number of local iterates and the number of participating edge devices compared with the centralized zeroth-order algorithm (i.e., ZO-SGD) that achieves convergence rate 𝒪​(d12​T−12)𝒪superscript𝑑12superscript𝑇12\\mathcal{O}\\left(d^{\\frac{1}{2}}T^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right) . For fair comparison, we consider b1=b2=1subscript𝑏1subscript𝑏21b_{1}=b_{2}=1.\nTo attain the same accuracy, compared to DZOPA with convergence rate 𝒪​(d12​(N​T)−12)𝒪superscript𝑑12superscript𝑁𝑇12\\mathcal{O}\\left(d^{\\frac{1}{2}}{(NT)}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right) [ref]10, the number of communication rounds required by the FedZO algorithm can be reduced by a factor of H𝐻H. Besides, it is worth noting that the convergence rate of the FedZO algorithm depends on the dimension of the model parameter. In particular, the convergence speed of FedZO is d𝑑\\sqrt{d} times slower than that of its first-order counterpart, i.e., FedAvg. Such a degeneration is the same as its centralized counterpart . In addition, for FedAvg, the maximum value of H𝐻H is O​(T13​N−1)𝑂superscript𝑇13superscript𝑁1O\\!\\left(T^{\\frac{1}{3}}N^{-1}\\right) [ref]21, which is smaller than that of FedZO mentioned in Remark 2. This is because the learning rate of FedZO is lower than that of FedAvg, which allows more local updates while preserving convergence.\nThe detailed comparison between the proposed algorithm and the related algorithms is summarized in Table I.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: rate is the same as that of the FedAvg algorithm.\nThe learning rate of the zeroth-order methods is generally d−limit-from𝑑\\sqrt{d}-times smaller than that of their first-order counterparts [ref]21  , as the two-point gradient estimator is less accurate than the gradient. In our work, by adopting the mini-batch-type gradient estimator, we can increase the mini-batch sizes\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
