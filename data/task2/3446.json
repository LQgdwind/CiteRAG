      "content": "Paper Title: AA-TransUNet: Attention Augmented TransUNet For Nowcasting Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe present study builds upon and extends the work of [ref]23, who introduced TransUNet. The original TransUNet is an encoder-decoder architecture where CNN-Transformer is used as the encoder, while the original UNet decoder is utilized as the decoder. This model has been successfully applied in medical image segmentation tasks.\nHere, we propose a new encoder-decoder architecture called AA-TransUNet which equips the classical TransUNet with two key elements: Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM) and Depthwise-separable Convolutions (DSC). The model is shown in Fig. 1 and is used for precipitation forecasting tasks. We integrate CBAM, which consists of a Channel Attention Module (CAM) and a Spatial Attention Module (SAM), to both encoder and decoder path of the TransUNet model. In particular, in the encoder path, CBAM is incorporated into the CNN part of the hybrid CNN-Transformer layer, and in the decoder path it is placed after all convolution layers (see Fig. 1). This allows the model to perform both channel-wise and spatial-wise attention and therefore can better explore the inter-channel as well as inter-spatial relationship of the features.\nIn addition, the original convolutions of the decoder of the TransUNet is replaced by DSC aiming to reduce their parameter size.\nIn Table I, we compare the number of parameters of the decoder of TransUNet and AA-TransUNet models. Despite the added CBAM layers, the number of parameters of AA-TransUNet decoder are still 68.94% lower than that of TransUNet.\nIt should be noted that here we only compare the number of parameters of the decoder. As CBAM, which is a lightweight and general module [ref]24, is only added to the encoder, therefore the number of parameters of the encoder path of the AA-TransUNet is relatively the same as that of TransUNet. Despite [ref]5, here the input to the encoders is the image feature with the attention mechanism applied. In addition, as oppose to [ref]5, CBAM is used in each decoder level (see purple arrows in the decode path of Fig. 1) to identify important features across channels and spatial dimensions of an image [ref]5 [ref]24. Similar to TransUNet [ref]23, the encoder of the AA-TransUNet model is a Transformer based model, which is typically used to process sequence data. Therefore, when using it as an encoder, the image sequentialization step needs to be taken first to covert 3D images to 2D patches [ref]23. The obtained patches are then fed into the Transformer layer, which consists of Multihead Self-Attention (MSA) layers  and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) blocks (each MSA and MLP pass through the layer normalization gate). At the same time, following [ref]23, instead of using a pure Transformer as an encoder, we employ CNN-Transformer to make use of the intermediate high-resolution CNN feature maps in the decoding path and improve the model performance. An architecture similar to UNet decoder is used for the proposed AA-TransUNet decoder. As shown in Fig. 1, four operations are used in the AA-TransUNet decoder: upsampling (green arrows), feature concatenation (dotted rectangles),\ndouble convolution (cyan arrows) and finally the CBAM (purple arrows). The last layer of the model is a 1 x 1 convolution (orange arrow), which produces a single feature map that represents the prediction results.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: The present study builds upon and extends the work of [ref]23, who introduced TransUNet.
