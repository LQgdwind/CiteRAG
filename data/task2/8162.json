Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, with between 60%-80% of dementia being of AD type [ref]2. Early detection and intervention are crucial for slowing progression, enhancing the quality of life, and planning care . However, accurately predicting cognitive deterioration in AD remains a formidable challenge, limited by the sensitivity and specificity of traditional biomarkers and cognitive assessments . Furthermore, the collection of these biomarkers is often costly and invasive for patients. Recent advances in blood metabolomics have opened new avenues for understanding the complex biological underpinnings of dementia. This approach offers a comprehensive snapshot of metabolic alterations, providing insights into disease onset and progression, whilst also reducing the need for invasive procedures such as lumbar punctures and neuroimaging . Nevertheless, the complexity and high-dimensionality of metabolomics data necessitate sophisticated analytical tools to identify potential metabolomic candidates for the creation of models for AD prediction  . Machine learning and deep learning (hereafter collectively referred to as ML) have been proposed as such analytical tools. However, one of the challenges that prevent the successful integration of ML models into clinical practice concerns the information that can be gleaned from these methods. The techniques often deliver a binary or multinomial prediction indicating the likelihood of the development of disease. However, in prognostic modelling, it is usually more valuable to model the risk of developing the disease as a function of time. This limitation of traditional ML techniques restricts clinicians’ ability to accurately track and communicate the risk of disease occurrence over time with the patient . As a result, an emerging field of exploration seeks to build on classical time-dependent models, such as survival analysis, to develop machine learning models which can predict the time-dependent risk of developing AD and thus move beyond simple classification . Recently, a number of survival-based neural network models have been proposed. These models can estimate the patient-specific survival probabilities over time, by using either fully connected or recurrent neural networks . However, recent work has found that they do not perform as well as tree-based survival models . Neural networks require a high degree of computational power in order to train what are often complex models and thus the models must be shown to be superior to simpler alternatives in order to justify the additional computational cost. In the last few years the transformer model [ref]31 has risen to prominence in the domain of Natural Language Processing as a tool for the handling sequential data, with the model using an attention mechanism that can observe more important aspects of the sequence, which are retained to help the model make sense of the whole sequence. Although, the most common application of these transformer models has been in algorithms that underpin chatbots such as ChatGPT, because of the high degree of accuracy handling sequential data, a small number of papers have now developed transformer models for use in survival prediction in disease [ref]32. To that end, this paper introduces a novel application of one survival transformer model to predict the risk of cognitive deterioration in AD using blood metabolomics data. By leveraging this approach, we aim to uncover the subtle metabolic shifts that precede cognitive decline, offering a more accurate and timely prediction of risk in AD. To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to assess the performance of survival transformers in predicting deterioration in AD using metabolomics data.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: worldwide with profound impacts on individuals, families, and healthcare systems .
