      "content": "Paper Title: Federated Fairness Analytics: Quantifying Fairness in Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA number of existing works propose novel approaches to address aspects of the fairness problem in FL. Most commonly, they target uniformity of the accuracy achieved by the clients in classification tasks. Approaches such as AgnosticFair, Ditto, FedFA, FedFV, FedMGDA+, PropFair[ref]41 and q-FedAvg[ref]23 all offer alternatives to FedAvg that seek greater uniformity. In these works, uniformity is attributed to fairness, however, uniformity of performance measures are ignorant of the extent to which the client has contributed to the model training. Other approaches addressing notions of individual fairness across clients whilst requiring proportionality of the performance to the contribution include FOCUS[ref]42, CFFL and the CGSV reward mechanism. As the reward for clients participating in FL is typically the performance gain obtained from the global model, such schemes that consider the contributions incentivise participation as well as encouraging fairness. \n Most other existing approaches focus on notions of group fairness, attempting to mitigate discrimination against protected groups in FL. FairFed, FairFL, FMDA-M, FPFL, PrivFairFL and the work using Variational AutoEncoders for FL, all appreciate the effect that heterogeneity can have on group fairness across the federation and use unique techniques to optimise group fairness. It is important to note, similarly to the fundamental assumptions of this paper, all of these approaches rely on the clients and server knowing the sensitive characteristics from the start of the training. In these existing attempts to mitigate individual or group unfairness mentioned above, each only address one facet of the fairness problem and are hence cannot claim to be entirely fair.\n Finally, there exist a number of approaches that attempt to address notions of both individual and group fairness. FairFB is based on the centralised fair learning algorithm, FairBatch - it targets group fairness and can be modified for uniformity based individual fairness as well. FedMinMax tackles group fairness as a classical minimax optimisation problem and shows that this also encourages individual fairness. GIFAIR-FL uses a dynamic reweighing strategy to encourage uniformity across clients and groups in global and personalised settings. All of these are still limited as they are uniformity based and fail to consider the levels of client contributions. To summarise, although there are a number of existing approaches for fair FL, none attempt to either quantify or solve the full spectrum of fairness concerns.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: fairness problem in FL.
