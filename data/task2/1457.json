      "content": "Paper Title: Unifying Relational Sentence Generation and Retrieval for Medical Image Report Composition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual Captioning is a challenging cognitive task that requires a simultaneous understanding of both natural language and visual information. Early pioneering methods based on deep learning  have employed CNN   and RNN   to generate syntactical sentences for images or videos. For example, Karpathy et al.  proposed an alignment model to generate descriptions of image regions by incorporating R-CNN  features into RNN.\nVinyals et al.  devised an end-to-end captioning system by utilizing LSTM to maintain information in memory, which is improved via a spatial attention mechanism to automatically localize related regions in . Based on the above prevailing frameworks, recent approaches        towards different ambitions have been proposed. Xu et al.  designed a dual-stream RNN architecture to exploit both visual and semantic features jointly.\nTo address the issue that the image is segmented by CNN to the fixed resolution grid at a coarse level, Zhang et al.  equipped the image captioning model with fine-grained and semantic-guided visual attention. Yao et al.  introduced a hierarchy from instance level and region level to delve into a thorough image understanding. Then a HIerarchy Parsing architecture is used to integrate the hierarchical structure into image encoder.\nFurthermore, to learn structured semantic knowledge in scene graphs,\nLi et al.  first extracted triples from scene graphs and encoded them into semantic vectors, then devised a hierarchical-attention-based module to focus on salient visual and semantic features.\nSince the capacity of a single-LSTM network is limited for image captioning,\nXiao et al.  developed a deep hierarchical structure to fuse multi-level semantics of vision and language by increasing the vertical depth of the encoder-decoder. Medical Report Composition is one of the challenging research topics in machine learning for healthcare [ref]1  . Different from image captioning, this task requires generating multiple sentences and puts forward higher requirements on content selection, relation generation, and content fluency.\nJing et al.  proposed a co-attention mechanism to focus on abnormal regions and a hierarchical LSTM (Sentence LSTM and Word LSTM) like 7 to generate long paragraphs.\nTo incorporate patient background information, Huang et al. 8 proposed a hierarchical model with multi-attention mechanism. The patient’s background information is encoded and then added to the pretrained vanilla word embedding.\nDue to relatively rare and remarkably diverse abnormal findings,  fails to detect abnormalities and tends to generate trivial descriptions. Li et al. 9 directly selected sentences from the template database via Graph Transformer 0.\nRecently, there are some approaches combining traditional template-based and newest generation-based methods for sequence generation1  2. Cao et al. 1 used existing summaries as soft templates to guide the generative model, jointly applying template retrieval, template re-ranking and template-aware summary generation.\nDiffering from above methods failing to incorporate semantic consistency with medical abnormalities for sequence generation, our method unifies template retrieval and sentence generation to handle both common and rare abnormality while ensuring the semantic-coherency among the detected medical terms.\nSimilar to us, Li et al. [ref]1 combined retrieval-based and generation-based methods via reinforcement learning, whereas our generated descriptions are more consistent with detected abnormalities. Furthermore, Nie et al. 3 proposed a novel scheme that combines local mining and global learning approaches to bridge the vocabulary gap between health seekers and providers. Attention Mechanism tries to learn different attention weights for input text or image and focus on informative region automatically 4 5, which can be also applied to visual captioning   6 7 8 and report composition 9. For instance, Anderson et al.  combined bottom-up and top-down attention mechanism in which the latter mechanism can calculate attention at the level of objects extracted by the former mechanism. Hori et al. 6 introduced a multimodal attention model that selectively focus on specific information across different modalities for video description. Gao et al.  developed an attention-based framework to exploit the correlations between sentence semantics and visual content by mapping the features of them into a joint space. And Pan et al. 9 devised an X-Linear attention block to capture the 2n​dsuperscript2𝑛𝑑2^{nd} order feature interaction in between, and measures both spatial and channel-wise attention distributions. To make the decoder determine the relevance between the attended vector and the given attention query, Huang et al.  proposed an Attention on Attention module from which the useful knowledge was produced. Multi-label Classification\nMulti-label classification is a challenging task that attracts increasing attention     . Recent approaches, which are optimized with the ranking loss  or the cross-entropy loss  incorporate deep convolutional neural network into multi-label classification and achieve superior performance. However, this task exposes strong label co-occurrence dependencies according to . Thus Wang et al.  proposed CNN-RNN framework learns a joint image-label embedding to exploit label dependencies in an image. Furthermore, Feature Attention Network(FAN) , which builds the top-down feature fusion mechanism and learn the correlations among convolutional features, is designed to tackle object scale inconsistent and label dependencies. Chen et al.  introduced a two-stage method that trained the network to predict conditional probability directly and then refined it with unconditional probabilities which formulated from a numerically stable and principled loss function. Different from the above methods, we construct a relationship constraint loss function to learn label co-occurrence dependencies directly.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: semantics of vision and language by increasing the vertical depth of the encoder-decoder.
