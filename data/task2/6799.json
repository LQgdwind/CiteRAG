      "content": "Paper Title: Explainable AI for clinical risk prediction: a survey of concepts, methods, and modalities\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExplainability in the context of AI refers to the ability to understand and not just interpret the decisions or predictions made by an AI system. A key terminological difference exists that must be made now between ’interpreting’ and ’explaining’ an AI model. To interpret a decision is to understand what it represents in the interpretable domain ie. in terms of the input features. Explaining a decision is not just functional but can also be deeper and more mechanistic in as far as it can concern the algorithmic underpinnings of the learning process of the model within [ref]23. As such, explainability relates to the deeper inner working of the model while also concerning the broader social and human interactions of the model in ways that none of the individual concepts within do. As  states, \"explanations are social and involve conversations.\" From this philosophical perspective, interpretation is a subjective action, while explanation involves interactions . These interactions do not just include functional interpretations of results but the meaning of the results and how they impact humans (bias and fairness) as well as the comprehensibility of the model predictions to relevant stakeholders (transparency and trustworthiness). An important terminology note for the review is on the concept of clinical risk prediction versus diagnosis or classification. What we mean by AI for diagnosis or classification is in cases when the disease is usually already present and AI is used to help with faster, more accurate, or more insightful detection of the condition whereas risk prediction as we define it is more similar to prognostic clinical prediction, or predicting the risk of having the disease in the near- or long-term future. As such, prediction is then taken as a longitudinal instead of being a cross-sectional task and the patient population and associated data is more general with the first clinical starting point taken usually as inclusion criteria and the outcome occasionally being censored due to the existence of a prognostic time window and loss to follow-up . This invites the use of survival analysis methods some of which are included in this review. Why that is important for explainability is that this allows for a greater focus on temporal trends and recurrent models for which some explainability methods have been developed but which under past systematic reviews have not received sufficient attention. For some modalities, however, like in the case of imaging, the boundary between clinical risk prediction and diagnosis is blurred especially since major explainability applications have been made on data rarely used for prognostic analysis. Inclusion of these research papers will be decided on a case-by-case basis even when explicit usage of clinical risk prediction is not specified so that a broader overview of explainability for medical imaging can be reliably ascertained. In other cases like for text data, clinical risk prediction is so rare that we decided to include applications to medical coding considering how sometimes medical coding applications can also be seen as examples of machine learning for phenotyping  [ref]28. These cases will be kept to a minimum and they will not impact the overall analyses and conclusions of the literature review but rather are included for the sake of methodological completion of XAI applications. In common practice across a myriad of machine learning research applications, the terms interpretability and explainability are often used interchangeably. And while interpretability is a key concept underpinning explainability, it is not fully equivalent to it, in fact, \"there is no clear existing definition or evaluation criteria for interpretability\" itself . More recent work has attempted to use metrics such as similarity, bias detection, execution time, and trust for measuring different interpretability methods’ performance but the criteria are often subject to bias and might be measuring other aspects of the learning process not related to interpretability itself . One way to attempt to define the concept is by describing its practical usefulness. For example, we can define interpretability as the degree to which humans can understand and comprehend the predictions made by machine learning models . Here we go further and state that interpretability of an AI system relates to how well the output predictions whether it be in clinical risk modelling or elsewhere can be interpreted by behaviour in the input features. This can include concepts like feature importance and visualisations of learning . Following this line of thought, the \"more interpretable a machine learning system is, the easier it is to identify cause-and-effect relationships within the system’s inputs and outputs\" . An example could include a model learning to predict clinical risk of acute conditions like heart attack from time-series data and be able to highlight specific trends in time for measurement of heart rate important to making those predictions. Explainability, as we have mentioned earlier and will elucidate more ahead, is a wider concept which includes interpretability as it satisfies understanding internal learning logic and pattern recognition but is concerned also with the user experience of the system, data integration, problem motivation and definition, and bias and fairness. The concept of bias has been increasingly mentioned in clinical risk prediction with AI influenced by similar challenges in other fields like law and insurance policy automation. Not all bias is necessarily problematic, as (machine) learning is often dependent on it, but certain patterns can be representative of underlying inequities and, in fact, propagate them further.  defines bias as a kind of unfair systematic error that causes models to consistently wrongly predict for a certain subgroup of patients and when those groups are vulnerable then bias can lead to unfair outcomes. Addressing bias is often done in a multi-faceted approach but it first requires detecting it.  state that bias can be detected and corrected through explainability thereby implying that an explainable model would necessarily reduce bias or at the least expose it. Therefore, an explainable model whose every aspect, including data collection and integration, is understandable to human users such as clinicians, would be vulnerable to bias exposure and would be understandable to a level which would allow accounting for the bias in the system itself. Fairness is related to bias which is often used interchangeably but which [ref]33 note is more concerned with creating just usage of the systems rather than simply identifying bias in the data itself. Bias is thus an aspect of the data or model learning whereas fairness or the lack of it comes as a result of machine decision-making under the influence of bias on vulnerable communities . What this means in clinical risk modelling in practice is that both data need to be recognised for their potential biases as well as the feature processing and model inference stages, and the results need to be validated on various subpopulations either through counterfactual analysis by switching category groupings or stratified analysis etc. These interpretations and applications are up to clinicians and other users to make but they can only make them if the models are explainable enough to be able to understand the potential presence of unfairness. Another example of fairness building up on bias rather than being equivalent terms are ensemble systems that check for bias as well as address its understanding, measurement, diagnosis and poential steps for mitigation  . Rather, it is not enough to state there is bias for a system to be evaluated for fairness, more steps need to be done to address it and communicate it. Several tools have been proposed to address these needs which consist of using several possible metrics for evaluating bias on the individual and global levels using distance, separation, and distortions in the feature and sample space. Feature correlations and perturbation analysis for sensitive clinical attributes can help identify measured biases. Mitigation can involve a range of steps including at the pre-, during, and post-processing stages. Machine learning models can be evaluated for fairness during learning with approaches like using counterfactual probabilities of two samples chosen from different groups being the same with respect to a given (non-sensitive) feature  . The end outcome of such tools are visualisations which reveal group skewing either through heatmaps or clusters and the impact what-if style prodding questions have on the machine learning model as part of the fairness framework. Of course, these methods rely on the assumption that the vulnerable or sensitive groups of samples and features are known a priori which is easier to specify in clinical scenarios due to extensive literature on bias and discrimination across clinical care. Another limitation is implied dichotomy in sensitive groups which might not always hold in cases of hierarchical systems of discrimination. A system is considered transparent, as defined by , if it is \"human-understandable.\" Transparency does not necessarily pertain to any internal methodology of the model, per se, but rather refers to the broader system encompassing the model, its design, motivation, development, distribution, and validation as well. Critical in the clinical realm, the end users are patients and/or clinicians whose trust must be depended on if these AI systems are to revolutionise healthcare practice . Transparency, as a requirement, thus, cannot just be achieved through the use of computational methods, rather, it relies on involving humans in the model creation pipeline end-to-end as they, and their experience, is what defined the system as transparent or not. Transparency, when satisfied, would allow patients, developers, and clinicians, as well as other stakeholders, to evaluate potential conflicts of interest and other negative consequences by opening up the system creation process outside of just developers’ oversight   . A common difference between transparency and interpretability, most of all, is that transparency pertains to parts outside the machine learning system itself. Interpretability concerns itself with interpreting the model prediction outputs as a function of the inputs. Transparency is focused on the user experience with the system as a whole . Per , a transparent AI system for healthcare needs to have its objective and clinical scenario elucidated and verified with clinicians and other stakeholders, including end users, before any system design has taken place. In other words, transparency is characteristic of an AI system to have its motivation, design, and implementation elucidated to stakeholders whether it be through documentation or user-level testing or some other means. Without explicitly stating how their published research has attempted to address the transparency requirements, researchers risk their proposals being inadequate for real-world implementations with clinical end users. Trust or trustworthiness is closely intertwined with the concept of transparency, as users tend to be more willing to rely on systems that have been developed end-to-end and applied in a transparent manner . Out of all of the concepts underpinning explainability, trustworthiness is the most difficult to separate, mostly because it is usually explained through a system already being fair, accountable, and transparent . Sometimes, trustworthiness is also defined as satisfying certain confidence levels in prediction results and the methods being interpretable . For clinical risk prediction, a model must be sensitive, well-calibrated, and achieve good prediction results to achieve better trustworthiness, factors which are not accounted for in the other explainability sub-concepts. Therefore, to achieve integrated explainability, trustworthiness is the most linked concept with predictive performance, necessary for advancing change and implementing models in real-world clinical care . In the case of clinical risk prediction, here we propose the first-of-its-kind comprehensive evaluation review for peer-reviewed and published clinical risk prediction research which will comment on attempts or lack thereof of addressing the needs for explainability and what methods, validations, and open-access practices followed in achieving the same specifically focussed on clinical applications. To help aid the evaluation of this research we define some guiding questions in reviewing the papers: Interpretability: Is there any attempt to comment on the most important features identified by the model during learning? Did the authors provide any analysis of the model learning so as to make the system more interpretable? What interpretability methods were applied and to what extent were they clinically validated? Fairness: Has bias been evaluated, diagnosed, visualised, communicated, or addressed? Bias: Did the authors comment on potential sources of bias for their system (including the data)? Are there any reflections on future risks of bias in the deployment or applications of the proposed model and its envisioned work scenarios? Transparency: Have the authors consulted clinicians or other experts as well as patients at any stage of the project process? Have they commented on their needs, motivations, and limitations as well as constraints regarding the model and its applications? Do the authors document and communicate these findings in their work? Trust: Have the model results been checked for random perturbations and noise (including the interpretability results)? What statistical or power tests were completed and do the authors indicate confidence intervals or standard errors in their results? While each paper might not be evaluated for these questions, we will show how a simple check for clinical, statistical, and reproducibility tests show the current culture of explainable AI research for clinical risk prediction. In the review, different modalities for clinical usage will be considered, and each section will correspond to a separate modality under which a table will be included containing the summary information for each reference. Each row of the table will correspond to a specific reference and the underlying model, interpretability approach, dataset size, topic, and the existence of a clinical validation or open access check. quantitative evaluation will correspond either to simple statistical tests done on interpretability results and checking for noise as well as using several interpretability methods to confirm consistency of explanations. Clinical relevance is highly important in explainable AI for clinical risk prediction precisely because the ultimate goal of utilizing AI in healthcare is to improve patient outcomes and enhance clinical decision-making. Explainable AI models should not only be accurate and reliable but also provide insights and explanations that are meaningful and actionable for healthcare professionals. By emphasizing clinical relevance, explainable AI ensures that the generated explanations align with medical knowledge, guidelines, and the specific needs of healthcare practitioners. It enables clinicians to understand how the AI system arrives at its predictions or recommendations, thus building trust and confidence in the technology. This understanding allows clinicians to integrate AI outputs into their existing knowledge and expertise, resulting in more informed decision-making. Moreover, clinical relevance in explainable AI helps in the adoption and acceptance of AI systems within the healthcare domain. Healthcare professionals are more likely to trust and embrace AI technologies when the explanations provided by these systems are relevant and align with their clinical intuition. If the explanations are not clinically meaningful or comprehensible, clinicians may disregard or be skeptical of the AI system’s recommendations, potentially leading to a lack of adoption and underutilization of valuable AI tools. Additionally, clinical relevance in explainable AI is crucial for patient-centered care. Patients and their families rely on healthcare professionals to make informed decisions about their health. When AI models provide explanations that are clinically relevant, it becomes easier for healthcare providers to communicate the reasoning behind their recommendations to patients. This transparency and shared decision-making process can enhance patient understanding, trust, and engagement in their own care. Explanations have no performance guarantees and, as such, the fidelity and value of their explanations is often insufficiently investigated, but in few cases of external human validation . Presenting a limitation in explainability work, inadequate external testing of explainability methods makes proposed explainable AI models for clinical risk prediction merely approximations of the model’s decision protocol and does not truly describe its underlying reasoning. Relying solely on using post-hoc explanations, as such, to assess the quality of model decisions could be just another source of error . It is, thus, of high importance that while presenting an application or development of explainability methods to different modalities in clinical risk prediction, we also highlight their (non-)existent evaluations whether they be human in the form of clinical validation or algorithmic as the implementation of some quantitative metric. A relatively more common strategy that some could pursue is applying several different methods and comparing the explanations of each to guarantee either consistency or, under certain noise constraints, robustness.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: Explaining a decision is not just functional but can also be deeper and more mechanistic in as far as it can concern the algorithmic underpinnings of the learning process of the model within [ref]23.
