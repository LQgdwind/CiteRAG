Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Fast and Accurate Image-Text Retrieval with Self-Supervised Fine-Grained Alignment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets in image-text retrieval: Flickr30K  and MS-COCO [ref]24. Flickr30K consists of 31,783 images collected from the Flickr website and each image is associated with 5 sentences. Following the settings in  , we utilized 1,000 images for validation, 1,000 images for testing, and the rest for training. MS-COCO contains 123,287 images with 5 captions for each image. Following  , we take 113,287 images for training, 5,000 images for validation, and 5,000 images for testing, and the results are reported by both averaging over 5 folds of 1K test set images and testing on the full 5K test images as in  . Evaluation Metrics. To compare with the state-of-the-art models, we adopt the commonly used evaluation metrics in all datasets as   [ref]23. Namely, we adopt Recall at K denoted as R@K to evaluate the performance on both text retrieval (retrieve the most related text given an image query) and image retrieval (retrieve the most related image given a text query) tasks. R@K means the percentage of queries that are correctly matched in the top-K ranking list. We report R@1, R@5, R@10 for all datasets as in [ref]23. Besides, to comprehensively reveal the overall retrieval performance, we also report another metric R@sum as in [ref]5, defined as the summation of all R@K values in both retrieval tasks. Implementation Details. To perform a fair comparison, for VSRN and CAMERA, we completely preserve their network structures and model settings such as training batch size and other model-related hyper-parameter settings as stated in their original work. We only inject our module into the two baselines as introduced in Section III-D. For both baseline models, the softmax temperature œÑ1subscriptùúè1\\tau_{1} in the LCA sub-module is set to 0.1 as in . The number of concept classes KùêæK is set to 1024, and the number of negative samples N and the softmax temperature œÑ2subscriptùúè2\\tau_{2} in CRA sub-module are set to 512 and 0.7. All of our experiments are conducted on a single NVIDIA Tesla GPU with 24GB memory and implemented in PyTorch.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Datasets.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
