      "content": "Paper Title: PrEditor3D: Fast and Precise 3D Shape Editing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent 3D diffusion models can generate high-quality assets that closely align with the text prompts in the form of neural fields  , meshes  , or Gaussian point clouds . Although these methods generate impressive results, they lack the essential capability for precise and controllable editing of the generated outputs, a critical requirement for iterative artistic workflows.\nEffective 3D editing demands: (1) it should be fast enough to provide quick feedback, ideally comparable to fast 3D generation algorithms, and (2) it must allow for precise local control, enabling users to keep specific parts of the model unchanged. Enabling precise and controllable editing is still an open challenge. Several initial approaches have been proposed to tackle the challenge of 3D editing [ref]36 [ref]16 [ref]9   , providing promising results but suffering from slow runtime, lack of precise control, and/or lack of 3D consistency and quality.\nOptimization-based techniques like SDS [ref]36 [ref]9  or multiview training dataset updates [ref]16 are computationally expensive, making interactive editing out of reach. Additionally, they offer limited control over specific parts of the shape, as text prompts alone cannot precisely localize regions to be edited [ref]36 [ref]16 [ref]9  .\nWhile Vox-E [ref]36 and Shap-Editor  [ref]9 propose a mechanism to prevent original parts of the shape from being altered during editing, they do not enable precise editing due to having only text as input.\nFinally, one can observe various visual quality problems, such as the Janus problem, blurring, over-saturation, and overemphasizing texture changes while leaving the geometry intact or degrading. To address these challenges, we propose a novel editing pipeline for 3D assets that is faster, more precise, and delivers high-quality results (See Fig. 1).\nAs our primary goal is faster editing, we propose an editing framework leveraging a pipeline that consists of two components: a multi-view diffusion algorithm and a feed-forward mesh reconstruction.\nMulti-view diffusion models can leverage superior 2D editing techniques, and the feed-forward mesh reconstruction bridges the gap between 2D and 3D.\nFor better controllability, we extend multi-view image generation to multi-view image editing using 2D masks to constrain the edits to user-specified regions.\nThe 2D masks can take various forms, including manually selected regions, hand-brushed areas, or automatically generated segmentations.\nWe adopt DDPM inversion 0 to extract initial noise vectors from input multi-view images and execute Prompt-to-Prompt  on a multi-view diffusion model .\nWe use 2D user-provided masks to blend edited and original views during the denoising.\nHowever, due to the inherent ambiguity caused by projection from 3D to 2D, we cannot obtain ideal intended regions in 2D regardless of the granularity of the masks, as shown in Fig. 2.\nHowever, the masks are often too rough to precisely capture the intended semantic editing regions.\nThe masks are either too coarse so the unintended regions will be changed, or too fine-grained to allow reasonable editing.\nWithout additional spatial information in 3D, multi-view editing approaches cannot fully address this challenge.\nTherefore, simply adopting a feed-forward reconstruction method  to convert edited multi-views into a 3D mesh often leads to undesirable results. To tackle this issue, we propose using the original 3D input and 3D segmentation. We first detect the intended editing region using Grounding DINO 3 and SAM 2  with the user mask and prompts. This gives an initial 2D segmentation that we subsequently lift to 3D. For this purpose, we use color coding in a multi-view to 3D reconstruction pipeline, named GTR , to end up with a 3D segmentation that we can use during merging. Specifically, we paint 2D segmentations in a specific color, (e.g., green) and after reconstruction, we can detect which regions are edited by querying the color in the 3D field. Then, we perform merging to maintain the original parts of the shape.\nWe use 3D masks to detect edited/replaced parts in GTR’s  voxel-feature space. We extract the edited part from the new shape and replace it with the old part from the original shape. That way, we guarantee that the remaining shape will remain identical. We apply a final average blending operation so that new parts and the original shape blend smoothly. In summary, we make the following contributions: We propose a novel method for diffusion-based 3D object editing that is faster than previous work and enables precise, interactive editing. The proposed method consists of user-guided and multi-view-synchronized editing and a feed-forward 3D reconstruction, enabling fast editing in a feed-forward manner. To enable precise editing only to intended regions, we propose a voxel-based 3D segmentation method that utilizes multi-view segmentation information and propagates it to 3D, followed by an average blending operation to merge the edited and original objects. Our editing method has superior quality to previous work. We show significant improvements in GPTEval3D , directional CLIP metrics, and extensive user studies.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: keep specific parts of the model unchanged.
