      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptable Butterfly Accelerator for Attention-based NNs via Hardware and Algorithm Co-design\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEfficient Approaches for Attention.\nAs the algorithmic complexity of the self-attention mechanism scales quadratically with respect to the input sequence length,\nmany sparse variants have been introduced to approximate the attention-based NNs¬†.\nThe sparsity patterns in these approaches are determined either dynamically¬†[ref]8 [ref]12 [ref]7  or statically¬†  .\nAlthough these methods achieve high compression rate on the number of operations and parameters,\nthe hardware cost and efficiency of their mappings on real hardware designs are not considered in these works. Domain-Specific Accelerators for Attention-based NNs.\nTo better utilize existing efficient attention-based algorithmic approaches on hardware, various domain-specific hardware designs have been introduced.\nHam et al.¬† propose a hardware architecture called A3superscriptùê¥3A^{3}, which dynamically prunes entries based on their softmax importance.\nBy leveraging the sparsity in both head and token levels,\nWang¬†et al.¬† propose SpAtten that dynamically prunes entire rows and columns from the attention matrix.\nEdgeBERT¬† explores the layer sparsity via an entropy-based early-exit approach, which significantly reduces the computation and memory footprint.\nTo detect the weak relationship in attention, DOTA¬† uses low-rank linear transformations to detect and omit the weak connections.\nELSA¬† approximates the attention mechanism using a sign random projection approach.\nTo further exploit the sparsity in attention-based NNs,\nEnergon¬† adopts a low-precision NN to predict the sparsity in the attention matrix.\nHowever, the generated sparsity patterns from these approaches are always unstructured, which may lead to hardware inefficiency.\nSanger¬† propose pack-and-split modules to distribute the non-zero computation to each computation engine, achieving a load-balanced execution.\nAlthough these accelerators achieve notable speedup over GPUs and CPUs when executing the attention mechanism,\ntheir end-to-end hardware performance is limited as\nthe approximation and acceleration of the FFN part are not considered in their design. Comparison to Previous Work.\nAs spatial-domain convolution corresponds to frequency-domain multiplication,\nvarious FFT-based hardware accelerators have been introduced to accelerate CNNs¬† , LSTMs¬†  and attention-based NNs¬†.\nHowever, these designs only use FFT as a domain transfer approach, while the main computation is still performed in another processing engine.\nIn contrast,\nthis paper adopts the butterfly sparsity, a generalized pattern of FFT, for the main computation of the network.\nBased on the proposed method, all the computations are performed in a single unified butterfly accelerator, resulting in a higher hardware efficiency over previous designs. Although butterfly sparsity has been explored in recent literature,\nmost approaches only focus on algorithm-level optimizations.\nDao¬†et al.¬† demonstrate the potential of the butterfly matrix in approximating linear transformations, but its efficiency on attention matrices is not explored in their work.\nOn the other hand, Pixelated Butterfly¬† and Sparse Transformer¬† focus on adopting the butterfly pattern for attention matrices, neglecting the linear layers.\nMoreover, their designs require the use of multiple sparsity patterns to compensate for the accuracy loss, which significantly complicates the hardware design.\nLee-Thorp¬†et al.¬† show the effectiveness of Fourier transforms in accelerating attention layers, but did not consider the linear layers, leading to scalability issues¬†(Section¬†II-C).\nDifferent from all these efforts,\nthis paper exploits the use of butterfly sparsity for both attention and linear layers via an algorithm-hardware co-design approach.\nA novel butterfly-based algorithm and an adaptable hardware accelerator are jointly designed to overcome existing limitations to push the performance limit.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: respect to the input sequence length,\nmany sparse variants have been introduced to approximate the attention-based NNs¬†.\nThe sparsity patterns in these approaches are determined either dynamically¬†[ref]8 [ref]12 [ref]7  or statically¬†  .\nAlthough these methods achieve high compression rate on the number of operations and parameters,\nthe hardware cost and efficiency of their mappings on real\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
