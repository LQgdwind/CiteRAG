      "content": "Paper Title: Enhanced Performance of Pre-Trained Networks by Matched Augmentation Distributions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSqueezing the best performance out of established network architectures for image recognition is an active research area with supreme practical importance of real-world deployment especially of smaller networks like ResNet-18, and MobileNet etc. Latest attempts have been focused on training, re-training or fine-tuning the core networks with custom strategies using default or additional data. In popular FixRes [ref]2, authors emphasized the existence of train-test object size discrepancy and argued for using smaller resolutions during training. Through extensive experiments they demonstrated that training on smaller resolutions not only compensates for the distributional shift but also reduces the training time. They further showed that fine-tuning pre-trained networks for higher test-time resolution results in enhanced performance. Using ResNet-50 as the core architecture they explored various train-test resolution combinations and demonstrated that even higher performance can be achieved by employing bigger networks like ResNeXt-101 6 and leveraging Billion-scale training data [ref]3. In an extended version  of their work, authors explored FixRes to train EfficientNet architectures  where they further integrated label smoothing. They focused on two best performing EfficientNet versions trained with adversarial examples  and noisy student in weakly-supervised fashion using 300 million unlabeled images . The resultant FixEfficientNet models are demonstrated to outperform these two versions on ImageNet , ImageNet-V2 , and ImageNet-Real . CutMix  belongs to the category of regional dropout augmentation methods where random regions in images are removed to enhance the generalization performance of deep networks. However unlike other regional dropout approaches  , CutMix fills the removed regions with patches from other training examples, effectively achieving not only better generalization but also better detection and localization performance. Mixup  is another augmentation strategy where training images and ground truth labels are linearly interpolated to synthesize samples to enhance the generalization capability of the underlying network. Mixing features instead of the images  and other mixup variants   have also been explored. In , authors explored knowledge distillation  and adversarial learning  to train a student network using the predictions from an ensemble of teacher networks. Instead of using one-hot ground truth labels, the predicted probability vectors out of the teacher networks are used to distill the knowledge where L1, L2, and KL-divergence losses are explored. Additionally discriminator networks are incorporated at several levels to distinguish between the feature representations generated by student and the teacher. At each iteration a teacher is randomly selected out of the teacher zoo and its predicted probability vector provides the supervisory signal. For ImageNet, they used ResNet-50 as the student network and (i) VGG-19 w/BN and ResNet-50, or (ii) ResNet-101 and ResNet-152 as the two teacher ensemble variants. In extended version of their work i.e., MEAL-V2  they trained a student network using an ensemble of teachers where average of the softmax scores of the ensemble is used as soft supervisory signal instead of one-hot hard labels or selecting one teacher at random for every iteration. In this variant, the student network is trained using KL-divergence loss to match the probability distribution of the averaged ensemble. Like , a discriminator is further employed to distinguish whether the input features are generated from teacher ensemble or student network. Authors used their framework to train ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B0, and three size variants of MobileNet-V3 where they used senet154 and resnet152_v1s as teachers. For training the student on a larger resolution e.g., 380×380380380380\\times 380, larger teachers like efficientnet_b4_ns and efficientnet_b4 are employed. As evidenced by summarized research above, an enhanced performance can be achieved by smartly training the existing networks and/or leveraging the additional billion-scale data. However, training a network may not be a preferred or viable solution for vendors deploying deep models for real-world applications. To this end, in this paper we focus on squeezing best achievable performance for several popular pre-trained deep networks without any training or fine-tuning. We demonstrate that for several larger networks, averaging of random crops results in comparable or better performance than employing custom training strategies and billion-scale data rendering such strategies questionable.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: ResNet-18, and MobileNet etc. Latest attempts have been focused on training, re-training or fine-tuning the core networks with custom strategies using default or additional data.
