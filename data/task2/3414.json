For the post-hoc approach, Goyal et al.  used a variational autoencoder to measure the causal concept effect of a trained model. Zhou et al. [ref]11 decomposed saliency maps generated by CAM [ref]12 or grad-CAM  to each concept, and Kim et al.  and Ghorbani et al.  computed concept sensitivity using directional derivatives. Also, Bau et al.  used pixel-wise segmentation to estimate the concepts. These methods focused on the concept visualization of state-of-the-art models. However, there are no guarantees that these models use the desired concepts. For ante-hoc approaches, Koh et al.  proposed a CBM that predicted target tasks through the concept layer. Bahadori and Heckerman  extended this model to denoise the concepts, and Belém et al.  applied a CBM to perform weakly supervised learning. Alvarez and Jakkola  proposed a SENN to generalize the interpretable linear model and combines the encoder-decoder architectures as in [ref]19, and Marcinkevics and Vogt 0 extended SENN for sequential data. Aside from these models, Losch et al. 1 added a concept bottleneck layer to the trained segmentation network, and Kim et al. 2 proposed a network architecture for visual concepts to capture the global context. Chen et al. 3 proposed concept whitening as a normalization technique, and Li et al. [ref]19 and Chen et al. 4 introduced an intermediate layer, which was not easy to train 5 but which was designed to describe prototypes. Similarly, Cao et al. 6 proposed a meta-learning method that learned a mapping of concepts into semi-structured metric spaces and combined the outputs of each concept learner. These concept whitening and prototyping approaches require one additional patch image per concept. Multi-task or auxiliary learning methods also use concepts to improve the target performance 7 . However, in these methods, the concepts may not affect the targets tasks .\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: can be mainly divided into post-hoc and ante-hoc methods.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
