DOI:000000/11111. * Corresponding author: sbelhaouari@hbku.edu.qa\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSpiking Neural Networks (SNNs)  represent a brain-inspired computational model that utilizes binary spike-based communication, allowing for efficient information processing through event-driven and spatio-temporal mechanisms. These properties make SNNs particularly effective in handling temporal data and enable energy-efficient computations, aligning with biological neural networks’ sparse firing behavior. However, the discontinuous nature of spike-based information transmission introduces challenges for training deep SNNs, as conventional gradient-based optimization methods cannot be directly applied due to the non-differentiable spiking mechanism. One approach to overcome this challenge is Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) , a biologically inspired mechanism for weight updates in SNNs. Despite its grounding in biology, STDP alone is not sufficient for training large-scale networks, limiting its applicability in practical, complex tasks. Two prevalent methods have been developed to achieve more effective training of deep SNNs: ANN-to-SNN Conversion: This method involves training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with standard continuous activation functions (such as ReLU) and subsequently converting it into an SNN by replacing the activations with spike-based mechanisms [ref]17. This process retains the original network’s learned representations and is straightforward to implement. However, it is typically constrained to rate-coding, ignoring the potential for more dynamic temporal behaviors within SNNs. Surrogate Gradient (SG) Approach: The SG approach introduces a differentiable surrogate function that approximates the spiking neuron’s non-differentiable firing activity, enabling backpropagation in SNNs . This technique has shown significant promise in handling temporal data and achieving competitive performance with few time steps on large-scale datasets. The SG method allows SNNs to utilize the spatio-temporal dynamics of spikes effectively, thereby enhancing the network’s ability to process temporal information while maintaining efficiency. In recent studies, including Wu et al. , various enhancements to direct learning-based SNNs are discussed, categorized broadly into accuracy improvement methods, efficiency improvement methods, and methods that exploit temporal dynamics. These categories are further divided based on specific objectives: Accuracy Improvement: Focused on increasing representational capacity and alleviating training challenges . Efficiency Improvement: Involves techniques such as network compression and sparse connectivity to reduce computational costs . Temporal Dynamics Utilization: Exploits sequential learning and integration with neuromorphic sensors to harness SNNs’ unique temporal characteristics . Adaptive SNNs (AdSNNs) further advance SNNs  by incorporating spike frequency adaptation, a phenomenon observed in biological neurons that dynamically modulates firing rates to encode input intensity effectively. The adaptation can be modeled through the dynamic threshold mechanism, where the threshold ϑ​(t)\\vartheta(t) for spike generation adapts based on previous spiking activity. This adaptation can be expressed as: where ϑ0\\vartheta_{0} is the resting threshold, mfm_{f} controls adaptation speed, and γ​(t)\\gamma(t) is an adaptation kernel. This adaptive mechanism allows for spike-based coding precision to be adjusted according to the input’s dynamic range. By modulating firing rates, AdSNNs achieve efficient encoding while remaining energy-conscious, paralleling biological neural behavior. The flexibility in adjusting neural coding precision offers advantages in tasks that require varying levels of attentional focus, making AdSNNs suitable for temporally continuous, asynchronous applications.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with standard continuous activation functions (such as ReLU) and subsequently converting it into an SNN by replacing the activations with spike-based mechanisms [ref]17.
