      "content": "Paper Title: LFGCF: Light Folksonomy Graph Collaborative Filtering for Tag-Aware Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent years have witnessed rapid development in graph neural networks, which perform excellently in node classifications and edges predictions. Berg et al. [ref]20 brought up GCMC, in which autoencoder was used in a user-item bipartite graph to generate expressive embeddings. Ying et al. [ref]21 focused on web-scale recommendation systems and came up with a GCN-based algorithm: PinSage. Results showed that Pinsage had excellent robustness and could generate high-quality recommendations. Wang et al. [ref]22 incorporated GCN and came up with NGCF. Benefited by the multi-hop neighborhood connectivities, NGCF achieved good recommendations performance. Later in the research of He et al. , it is proven that some designs in NGCF are burdensome and compromising recommendation performance. So LightGCN was brought up to simplify the model design, achieving better recommendations. Focusing on click-through rate (CTR) predictions, Li et al.  came up with Fi-GNN, in which the gated recurrent units (GRU) was used for information aggregation. DG-ENN was brought up by Guo et al.  for the same task. By incorporating the attribute graph and the collaborative graph, DG-ENN was able to alleviate the feature and behavior sparsity problem. For certain factors in CTR tasks, Zheng et al.  taken price into account when coming up with a GCN-based model. Furthermore, Su et al.  used L0 regularization via GNN approach to distinguish valuable factors automatically. Focusing on the re-ranking task in recommendations, Liu et al.  developed IRGPR, which introduced an intent embedding network to embed user intents, and it is proven effective for re-ranking. Lately, several researchers have focused on applying graph neural networks to collaborative tagging systems. Chen et al.  used graph convolutional networks for tag-aware recommendations, and their TGCN model outperformed other state-of-the-art models. Huang et al.  used two graph attention networks for embeddings aggregation and achieved high-quality recommendations as well. Few researchers use graph neural networks on tag-aware recommendations, while the model structure is quite complicated, making the training rather tricky. Our proposed method uses a relatively light and straightforward graph structure which suppose lowers the training cost and improves the performance.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: Recent years have witnessed rapid development in graph neural networks, which perform excellently in node classifications and edges predictions.
