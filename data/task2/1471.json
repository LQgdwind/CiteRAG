      "content": "Paper Title: CAnet: Uplink-aided Downlink Channel Acquisition in FDD Massive MIMO using Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn most downlink CSI acquisition frameworks, including conventional algorithms and DL-based methods, the UE first estimates the downlink channel and then feeds it back to the BS.\nThat is, the feedback and joint pilot transmission and channel estimation are separately designed.\nIn these works, no extra gains can be obtained if the entire CSI acquisition framework is jointly designed and optimized.\nFor example, in [ref]28, CEFnet, which estimates and feeds back the downlink channel at the UE subsequently, outperforms PFnet, which directly feeds back the received pilot signal to the BS.\nHowever, some papers suggest directly quantizing and feeding back the pilot signal .\nIn these works, extra expert knowledge, such as the correlation among nearby UE, is introduced to estimate the downlink channel at the BS.\nFor instance, in , the BS transmits pilots in the downlink, which are subsequently quantized at each UE and fed back to the BS via an uplink channel.\nThen, the BS utilizes these feedback pilots to estimate each UE’s downlink channel by exploiting the channel’s hidden joint sparsity for channel estimation by using distributed CS algorithms.\nCompared with the former CSI acquisition framework, this method can further reduce the feedback overhead. Similar to that work , in our considered scenario, additional side information, i.e., the correlation among the bidirectional channels, is introduced into the CSI acquisition.\nTherefore, different from that in [ref]28, additional performance gains may be achieved if the channel estimation and the feedback are jointly designed and trained as an entire task by using an end-to-end approach.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: transmission and channel estimation are separately designed.\nIn these works, no extra gains can be obtained if the entire CSI acquisition framework is jointly designed and optimized.\nFor example, in [ref]28, CEFnet, which estimates and feeds back the downlink channel at the UE subsequently, outperforms PFnet, which directly feeds back the received pilot signal to the BS.\nHowever, some papers\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
