      "content": "Paper Title: LiDAR SLAMMOT based on Confidence-guided Data Association\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the field of LiDAR-based SLAM, many solutions have been proposed. One of the most popular methods is LOAM [ref]12, which is a low-drift and real-time LiDAR odometry and mapping method. However, the performance of LOAM is limited when resources are scarce or when operating in noisy environments. To address these limitations, LeGO-LOAM [ref]1 has been proposed, which is a lightweight and ground-optimized LOAM method and offers improved performance with limited resources. Additionally, auxiliary sensors like IMU can be closely integrated with LiDAR to improve SLAM performance. Researchers presents LIOM [ref]13, which uses graph-based optimization to refine the extrinsic parameters of LiDAR and IMU, as well as IMU bias and robot pose. Following this, the LIO-SAM method  was introduced, estimating IMU bias within a factor graph framework and providing better real-time performance and more accurate state estimation compared to LIOM. To simplify computations, FAST-LIO  was developed, employing a tightly-coupled LiDAR-inertial odometry method based on an iterated Kalman filter with a new Kalman gain. Researchers then enhanced FAST-LIO with FAST-LIO2 , which directly matches raw point clouds without feature extraction and boosts mapping velocity and odometry accuracy using iKD-Tree. Nevertheless, all of these LiDAR-based methods rely on the static environment assumption and are easily affected by dynamic objects. For LiDAR-based SLAM in dynamic environments, researchers have also made some efforts. In  and , the researchers use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect moving objects from LiDAR point clouds, and simply filter all points belonging to dynamic objects for reliable SLAM in dynamic environments. In , a two-stream CNN method was applied to segment potential dynamic objects from point clouds. After removing the points associated with the potential dynamic objects, the point clouds were used to perform SLAM. In , researchers present the RF-LIO, which detects moving points in a LiDAR scan using adaptive multi-resolution range images and removes them, then realizes a tightly-coupled LiDAR inertial odometry in high dynamic environments. However, these methods may overlook valuable information, like points from stationary objects (e.g., parked vehicles), or face tracking errors due to the absence of a relationship between the ego-vehicle state and object state.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: In the field of LiDAR-based SLAM, many solutions have been proposed.
