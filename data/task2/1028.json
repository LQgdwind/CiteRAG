One exception is , who present a series of quantisation methods for mean estimation on real-valued input vectors. Recently,  studied the same problem, focusing on replacing the dependence on input norm with a variance dependence. We adapt their quantisation scheme for our upper bound. Tsitsiklis and Luo  gave a deterministic upper bound in a two-node setting, with O​(κ​d​log⁡(κ​d)​log⁡(β​d/ε))𝑂𝜅𝑑𝜅𝑑𝛽𝑑𝜀O\\bigl{(}\\kappa d\\log(\\kappa d)\\log(\\beta d/\\varepsilon)\\bigr{)} total communication cost. Recently, Magnússon et al.  extended this to N𝑁N-node case in the broadcast model, with O​(N​κ​d​log⁡(κ​d)​log⁡(β​d/ε))𝑂𝑁𝜅𝑑𝜅𝑑𝛽𝑑𝜀O\\bigl{(}N\\kappa d\\log(\\kappa d)\\log(\\beta d/\\varepsilon)\\bigr{)} total communication cost.\nFor randomised algorithms and constant condition number, better upper bound of O​(N​d​log⁡(β​d/ε))𝑂𝑁𝑑𝛽𝑑𝜀O(Nd\\log(\\beta d/\\varepsilon)) total communication cost in the broadcast model follows by using QSGD stochastic quantisation [ref]2 plugged into stochastic variance-reduced gradient descent (SVRG) . See Künstner  for a detailed treatment. While these algorithms are for the broadcast model, they can likely be implemented in the message-passing model without overhead by using two-stage quantisation; however, our algorithm also obtains optimal dependence on d𝑑d deterministically.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: optimisation algorithms in the distributed setting.\nDue to space constraints, we focus on a small selection of closely-related work.\nOne critical difference relative to practical references, e.g. [ref]2, is that they usually assume gradients are provided as 32-bit inputs, and focus on reducing the amount of communication by constant factors, which is reasonable in practice.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
