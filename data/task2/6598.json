      "content": "Paper Title: Faster Rectangular Matrix Multiplication by Combination Loss Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMatrix multiplication is one of the most fundamental computational tasks. The exponent of square matrix multiplication (denoted ω𝜔\\omega), in particular, is a central and ubiquitous quantity in theoretical computer science. The exponent of (square) matrix multiplication represents the exponent of the asymptotic complexity of the best possible matrix multiplication algorithm: it can be defined as the smallest ω𝜔\\omega such that two n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n matrices can be multiplied in O​(nω+ϵ)𝑂superscript𝑛𝜔italic-ϵO(n^{\\omega+\\epsilon}) time for any ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0.\nIt is easy to show that ω∈[ref]2 [ref]3𝜔23\\omega\\in[ref]2 [ref]3, but the precise value of ω𝜔\\omega is still unknown. The first non-trivial upper bound ω<2.81𝜔2.81\\omega<2.81 was obtained in 1969 by Strassen , and later improved several times       . In particular, Strassen obtained in 1986 the upper bound ω<2.48𝜔2.48\\omega<2.48 by developing a new technique called the laser method . Since 1987, all new upper bounds on ω𝜔\\omega have been obtained by applying the laser method to a mathematical construction called the Coppersmith-Winograd tensor , which we denote T𝖢​Wsubscript𝑇𝖢𝑊T_{\\mathsf{C}W} in this paper. First, Coppersmith and Winograd  analyzed T𝖢​Wsubscript𝑇𝖢𝑊T_{\\mathsf{C}W} and its second power T𝖢​W⊗2superscriptsubscript𝑇𝖢𝑊tensor-productabsent2T_{\\mathsf{C}W}^{\\otimes 2} using the laser method and obtained the bound ω<2.3754770𝜔2.3754770\\omega<2.3754770. More than twenty years later, Stothers  and Vassilevska Williams  were able to analyze the fourth power T𝖢​W⊗4superscriptsubscript𝑇𝖢𝑊tensor-productabsent4T_{\\mathsf{C}W}^{\\otimes 4} and obtained the new upper bound ω<2.3729269𝜔2.3729269\\omega<2.3729269 (see also  [ref]23). The approach by Vassilevska Williams was especially powerful since it made possible to analyze recursively powers of the Coppersmith-Winograd tensor for m=2ℓ𝑚superscript2ℓm=2^{\\ell} with any ℓ≥1ℓ1\\ell\\geq 1. Analyzing the eighth power using this approach, Vassilevska Williams  obtained the improved bound ω<2.3728642𝜔2.3728642\\omega<2.3728642. Deriving upper bounds on ω𝜔\\omega using this approach nevertheless requires solving a complicated (in particular, non-convex) optimization problem, which becomes extremely challenging for ℓ>3ℓ3\\ell>3. Le Gall [ref]23 showed that this optimization problem can be relaxed into a convex optimization problem, which made possible to completely analyze T𝖢​W⊗msuperscriptsubscript𝑇𝖢𝑊tensor-productabsent𝑚T_{\\mathsf{C}W}^{\\otimes m} for m=16𝑚16m=16 and m=32𝑚32m=32, and consequently obtained the upper bound ω<2.3728639𝜔2.3728639\\omega<2.3728639. Recently, Alman and Vassilevska Williams  showed how to refine the analysis of one key steps of the laser method, and consequently obtained an improved bound ω<2.3728596𝜔2.3728596\\omega<2.3728596. All these bounds are reported in Table 1. We also mention a series of works  [ref]2 [ref]3  0 1 showing the limits of these approaches (in particular, the impossibility to prove ω=2𝜔2\\omega=2 from the Coppersmith-Winograd tensor). Very recently, Duan, Wu and Zhou 9 obtained the improved upper bound ω<2.371866𝜔2.371866\\omega<2.371866. Their key discovery is that prior analyses of powers of the Coppersmith-Winograd tensor suffer from a “combination loss”. Duan, Wu and Zhou 9 gave a quantitative analysis of this combination loss, showed how to compensate it, and applied this methodology to the fourth power and the eighth power of the Coppersmith-Winograd tensor. This new approach crucially requires an asymmetric analysis of the powers of the Coppersmith-Winograd tensor (prior works on square matrix multiplication only needed a symmetric analysis).\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: the smallest ω𝜔\\omega such that two n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n matrices can be multiplied in O​(nω+ϵ)𝑂superscript𝑛𝜔italic-ϵO(n^{\\omega+\\epsilon}) time for any ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0.\nIt is easy to show that ω∈[ref]2 [ref]3𝜔23\\omega\\in[ref]2 [ref]3, but the precise value of ω𝜔\\omega is still unknown.
