      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Learning-Based Multiband Signal Fusion for 3-D SAR Super-Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe k​R𝑘𝑅kR-Block is composed of a cascade of complex-valued residual blocks (CV-RBs) followed by a single CV-Conv layer, as shown in Fig. 4b.\nEach k​R𝑘𝑅kR-Block operates on the signal in either the k𝑘k-domain or R𝑅R-domain, as the signal alternates between the two domains throughout the k​R𝑘𝑅kR-Net.\nFurthermore, because the domain transformation blocks (FFT and IFFT) are fully differentiable, they can be treated as conventional layers in the network, and gradient backpropagation can be easily implemented [ref]15.\nThe Fourier operations are performed across each activation map and normalized to make the FFT and IFFT orthonormal.\nBased on the convolution properties of the Fourier transform, convolution in one domain can be viewed as multiplication in the other domain.\nIn this sense, applying a CV-Conv layer in the k𝑘k-domain can be considered a fully connected layer in the R𝑅R-domain.\nHowever, as illustrated later in Section 5.2.1, our hybrid, dual-domain approach outperforms a network operating exclusively in the k𝑘k-domain or R𝑅R-domain in terms of convergence and numerical performance.\nHence, compared with conventional CNN models, the addition of domain transformation blocks throughout the network is key to improving multiband fusion performance. The CV-RB architecture is shown in Fig. 4c.\nInspired by [ref]30, the residual block consists of two convolution layers separated by an activation function: the complex parametric rectified linear unit (CPReLU) [ref]15.\nCompared with the original ResNet residual block , the proposed residual block removes batch normalization and empirically outperforms a bottleneck residual architecture  for multiband signal fusion. The CPReLU activation function is selected over alternatives, such as the complex ReLU (CReLU) , which computes the sum of the ReLU operation on the real and imaginary values separately, as the CPReLU has an improved activation over the complex domain.\nUsing the notation employed in (6), the CPReLU can be expressed as where the parameters ηRsubscript𝜂𝑅\\eta_{R} and ηIsubscript𝜂𝐼\\eta_{I} are learned during the training stage of the network for each CPReLU instance [ref]15.\nBecause ηRsubscript𝜂𝑅\\eta_{R} and ηIsubscript𝜂𝐼\\eta_{I} are learned independently, different layers of the network may learn different representations of the signal in amplitude and phase, aiding network robustness.\nThe CPReLU can be understood as a complex domain parametric rectified linear unit (PReLU), which extends the traditional ReLU into the negative input domain to overcome gradient saturation for negative activation values.\nIn the CPReLU, the real and imaginary parts of 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} are independently processed by a PReLU and the output is complex-valued.\nIn the complex domain, this corresponds to retaining information in all four quadrants, corresponding to all combinations of positive and negative real and imaginary activation values, as detailed in [ref]15. After the first four k​R𝑘𝑅kR-Blocks, the residual connection is made in the k𝑘k-domain followed by another k​R𝑘𝑅kR-Block and CV-Conv layer before being output, as shown in Fig. 4a.\nThe number of k​R𝑘𝑅kR-Blocks and domain transformations was investigated empirically, and the proposed configuration yielded the optimal numerical performance.\nHowever, further investigation of alternate architectures and deeper neural networks is a promising route for future research.\nIn the spirit of , multiple values for the convolution kernel size K𝐾K were investigated, and the optimal value was determined empirically to be K=5𝐾5K=5.\nThe number of feature maps throughout the network is chosen as F=32𝐹32F=32, and the number of CV-RBs for each k​R𝑘𝑅kR-block is set as B=8𝐵8B=8.\nk​R𝑘𝑅kR-Net comprises 86 CV-Conv layers and 866324 learnable parameters.\nMultiband signal fusion is performed by k​R𝑘𝑅kR-Net on a signal of length N𝑁N, yielding a fused signal in the k𝑘k-domain of equivalent size.\nAs discussed in Section 5.2.2, a network is trained for a specific multiband signal fusion scenario and must be retrained for application to alternate subband configurations (placement and range of subbands, sampling conditions, length N𝑁N of full-band signal, etc.).\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: because the domain transformation blocks (FFT and IFFT) are fully differentiable, they can be treated as conventional layers in the network, and gradient backpropagation can be easily implemented [ref]15.\nThe Fourier operations are performed across each activation map and normalized to make the FFT and IFFT orthonormal.\nBased on the convolution properties of the Fourier transform, convolution\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
