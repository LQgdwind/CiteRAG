      "content": "Paper Title: Faithful Edge Federated Learning: Scalability and Privacy\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine learning applications often rely on cloud-based datacenters to collect and process the vast amount of needed training data.\nDue to the proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, much of this data is generated by devices\nin wireless edge networks.\nIn addition, relatively slow growth in network bandwidth, high latency, and data privacy concerns may make it infeasible or undesirable to upload all the data to a remote cloud, leading some to project that 90%percent9090\\% of the global data will be stored and processed locally .\nFederated learning is a nascent solution to retain data in wireless edge networks and perform machine learning training distributively across end-user devices and edge servers (also called edge clouds) (e.g., [ref]3 [ref]4 [ref]5               0 1 2 3 4 5). Federated learning algorithms aim to fit models to data generated by multiple distributed devices. The large-scale deployment of federated learning relies on overcoming the following two main technical challenges: the statistical challenge and the communication challenge [ref]3 [ref]4 [ref]5. Specifically, each agent (the owner of each device) generates data in a non-independently and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) manner, with the dataset on each device being generated by a distinct distribution and the local dataset size varying greatly.\nSecond, communication is often a significant bottleneck in a federated learning framework, motivating the design of communication-efficient federated learning algorithms. These have been motivating extensive studies on improving efficiency by designing new training models, fast algorithms and quantization techniques (e.g.,  ).\nOther studies have been designing algorithms for resource allocation, mobile user selection, energy efficient, scheduling, and new communication techniques in wireless edge networks (e.g.,    0 1 2 3 4 5). Nevertheless, whereas many existing federated learning algorithms assume that agents are obedient, i.e., they are willing to follow the algorithms (e.g., [ref]3 [ref]4 [ref]5             0 1 2 3 4 5), edge devices in practice may be strategic and may tamper with or opt out of federated learning algorithms to their own advantages. Such strategic edge devices would be more likely to arise in a wireless setting, where different devices may connect and participate in federated learning at different times.\nTherefore, the success of deploying federated learning relies on strategic agents’ voluntary participation (into the federation) and faithful execution of distributed federated learning algorithms.\nGenerally speaking, there are two key factors\nthat may incentivize agents to strategically manipulate federated learning: federated learning may incur significant resource consumption (e.g., energy, bandwidth, and time) for mobile devices; agents have different preferences over prediction outcomes (due to, e.g., non-i.i.d and unbalanced data). The above issues reflect an agent’s dual role as a contributor and a client in a federated learning setting, respectively. That is, agents demand for both rewards for contributing and preferred prediction outcomes.\nThis work focuses on the latter issue that has been overlooked in the literature, whereas existing studies mainly have been attempting to solve the former one (see the survey in 6 and references 7 8 9          ) by designing incentive mechanisms to reward agents according to agents’ data quality, quantity, and reputation.\nSpecifically,\nnon-i.i.d. and unbalanced data may render different prediction objectives for different individual agents and hence may incentivize strategic manipulation. In this case,\neach strategic agent can choose either to opt out of or to tamper with the federated learning algorithms to its own advantage.\nSuch a behavior may result in the failure of large-scale deployments of edge federated learning. To this end,\nthis paper will first answer the following question: How do unbalanced data and non-i.i.d. data distributions disincentivize agents to obediently follow and voluntarily participate into federated learning algorithms? To overcome this issue of manipulation, one approach for the server is to leverage (economic) mechanism design, by anticipating agents’ strategic behaviors. As a seminal example, the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) mechanism \nis a generic truthful mechanism for achieving a socially-optimal solution, while ensuring agents’ voluntary participation and incentive compatibility, i.e., truthful reports of their local information. However, many such mechanisms use a central authority that computes the optimal solution, which is not applicable in the framework of federated learning.\nTo achieve distributed implementation of\nmechanisms, existing studies have developed faithful mechanisms (e.g.    ), which prevent agents from deviating from the intended algorithms (e.g., by manipulating computation or information reporting). We note that existing studies on centralized and distributed mechanisms, however, have not addressed\nthe problem of federated learning due to the following important considerations: Scalability:\nMobile devices are expected to be massively distributed (i.e., the number of agents may be much larger than the average samples per agent) and have limited communication capability [ref]3 [ref]4 [ref]5.\nHowever, existing VCG-based approaches  involve solving K+1𝐾1K+1 optimization problems (where K𝐾K is the number of agents), which makes them impractical for large-scale systems. Unknown data distributions: Existing mechanisms assume that agents know their exact objectives, whereas in federated learning agents’ expected objectives are unknown to themselves, since their underlying data distributions are unknown. Privacy: Federated learning often involves training predictive models based on individuals’ private local datasets that contain highly sensitive information (e.g., medical records and web browsing history). For instance, multiple hospitals forecast cancer risks by performing federated learning over the whole patient population, while privacy laws prohibit sharing private patient data . However, existing economic mechanisms require strategic agents to reveal their objective values, which may violate such privacy requirements.111Specifically, Roberts’ theorem states that, under mild conditions, the only incentive compatible mechanisms are VCG variants, which requires the revelation of agents’ private information of their loss functions .  These motivate the following key question: How should one design a faithful federated learning mechanism that also achieves voluntary participation, scalability, and privacy preservation?\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: learning is a nascent solution to retain data in wireless edge networks and perform machine learning training distributively across end-user devices and edge servers (also called edge clouds) (e.g., [ref]3 [ref]4 [ref]5               0 1 2 3 4 5).
