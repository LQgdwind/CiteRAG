      "content": "Paper Title: Application-aware Congestion Mitigation for High-Performance Computing Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of our application behavior inference engine and demonstrate the performance gain obtained using our application-aware congestion mitigation.\nWe performed the evaluation across four Cray Aries  HPC systems of varying scales: Voltrino consists of a chassis with 16 switches and 240 network links. Mutrino consists of an electrical group888384 compute nodes and 96 switches are combined to create an electrical group that acts as a single high-radix switch. with 96 switches and 2,880 network links. Neutrino consists of two electrical groups with 192 switches and 6,720 network links. Cori is a production-scale supercomputer located at NERSC comprising 34 electrical groups and 130,560 network links. We used these systems to evaluate our models in testbed and production settings.\nFor example, Voltrino and Mutrino are testbed systems that we used to conduct multiple application runs and rigorously validate our models.\nWe used to Cori to validate our methodology in production settings.\n Neutrino is a customized HPE/Cray system with an over-provisioned network (i.e., it has higher inter-group connectivity than a typical Aries system).\nNeutrino is not available to users; however, HPE/Cray was able to provide us with benchmark traces designed to understand network congestion. Our application set consists of both representative benchmarks (a–c) and real applications (d–g), as described below: DSA is a synthetic delay sensitive application that implements a sorting algorithm. BIA is a synthetic bandwidth intensive application that uses the Cray SHMEM library to stress the network. GPCNeT is a congestion-creation benchmark suite that captures four congestion patterns (all-to-all, RMA999RMA stands for remote memory access. incast, point-to-point incast, and RMA broadcast) commonly found in HPC workloads . MILC is used to study quantum chromodynamics, the theory of strong interactions of subatomic physics. It performs four-dimensional lattice communication, and its performance limiters include network latency . LAMMPS is a molecular dynamics program focused on materials modeling . Performance limiters include compute, memory bandwidth, network bandwidth, and network latency . Quantum Espresso is an integrated application suite for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling . Performance limiters include compute and network latency.  AMG is a parallel algebraic multigrid solver for linear systems . Performance limiters include memory-access and network latency . Applications (a–b) were provided to us by HPE/Cray to help us understand network congestion mitigation capabilities. Application c is an open-source congestion benchmark suite. We chose applications (d–g) because\n\n\n(i) they are among the top 10 most commonly used applications on NERSC production systems101010MILC and Quantum Espresso are the top two open-source applications on NERSC systems, accounting for 12% of total node hours. [ref]10, and\n\n(ii) previous work has shown that these applications are very susceptible to congestion-induced performance degradation .\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: top 10 most commonly used applications on NERSC production systems101010MILC and Quantum Espresso are the top two open-source applications on NERSC systems, accounting for 12% of total node hours. [ref]10, and\n\n(ii) previous work has shown that these applications are very susceptible to congestion-induced performance degradation .\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
