      "content": "Paper Title: Towards On-Device Federated Learning: A Direct Acyclic Graph-based Blockchain Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIt is noted that FL and blockchain technology are both deployed in a distributed network, many researchers attempt to combine the advantages of them and have proposed some influential blockchained FL systems [ref]6  . Combining blockchain and FL, the authors in  propose a DeepChain architecture. This work focuses on solving the problems of privacy and auditability by storing the local machine learning model in blockchain and regarding these models as transactions, which uses the security and immunity of blockchain to prevent nodes without permission from accessing information stored in transactions. Similarly, in order to store sensitive and personal data in a diskless environment, research like [ref]36 adopts blockchain to form a data sharing platform which is beneficial for data privacy and security. On this basis, the authors in  utilize a sharding-based blockchain protocol to well protect the convergence of FL when large-scale nodes are involved. Furthermore, researchers in  also propose a sharding-based FL system by applying a two-layer blockchain framework. In recent works [ref]3 , researchers are interested in a deep combination of blockchain and FL and get more suitable models for on-device scenarios or other. Both of the works use the miner in blockchain to complete the task of the central server in traditional FL. The authors in [ref]3 design a Block FL with multiple miners to coordinate FL tasks and maintain the global model, and the procedure can be described as follows: 1) The node downloads the global model from its associated miner and get a trained local model. 2) The trained local model will be uploaded to the associated miner as a transaction. 3) The miner will confirm the validity of the uploaded transaction, and the confirmed transactions will be stored in the candidate block of the miner. Once candidate blocks collect enough transactions or wait for a certain time, all miners enter the consensus stage together and run PoW to compete for a winner to publish its own candidate block on the blockchain. Besides, miners are capable of allocating rewards when publishing their blocks on blockchain to motivate mobile devices to participate in FL. Followed up the work [ref]3, the authors in  propose a FLchain architecture that considers MEC servers as miners to solve problems brought by central servers in traditional FLs. The FL systems in these two works are more like the pseudo-asynchronous ones, in which nodes are freed after uploading local trained models to miners. Compared with only using blockchain to store and transmit information, works like [ref]3  provide a feasible way to achieve efficient fusion of blockchain and FL in terms of data security and privacy. However, these previous works still remain issues to be addressed on both blockchain and FL. On the one hand, these works insist on the PoX consensus mechanism, which naturally leads to the pseudo-asynchronous framework that cannot meet the device asynchrony in on-device FL. Besides, the introduced miners would generate extra delay and resource consumption on consensus but not for FL at all. On the other hand, these works rely on miners to validate uploaded local models stored in transactions, which might cause minerâ€™s dilemma due to the conflict of interest between blockchain and FL. As the transaction validation is executed on miners, the target model might be trained towards the expected direction of miners instead of nodes, resulting in the problem of local optima. To this end, for asynchronous bookkeeping and low resource consumption of DAG ledger technology, this paper proposes DAG-FL introducing DAG empowers asynchronous FL framework. Through the workload assign of consensus and model validation on each node in a decentralized manner, miners and mining are not needed anymore. By combining the voting mechanism of DAG ledger technology with the process of local model validation in FL, DAG-FL can detect abnormal nodes and mitigate their impact autonomously to guarantee security. Meanwhile, as the model validation is operated on each node without professional miners, the target model of FL would be trained under the observation of all nodes avoiding the training deviation for any reason.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: that FL and blockchain technology are both deployed in a distributed network, many researchers attempt to combine the advantages of them and have proposed some influential blockchained FL systems [ref]6  .
