      "content": "Paper Title: SIM2E: Benchmarking the Group Equivariant Capability of Correspondence Matching Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs shown in Table. 1, the existing datasets for correspondence matching algorithm evaluation can be grouped into two types: 3D scenes [ref]39  [ref]41 [ref]42   and planar scenes  . Aachen Day-Night [ref]39 is a public dataset designed to evaluate the performance of outdoor visual localization algorithms in changing illumination conditions (day-time and night-time). The dataset contains a scenario where images were taken with a hand-held camera at different times of the day. It is widely used to evaluate the performance of correspondence matching algorithms, especially when the illumination change is significant. ScanNet [ref]41 is a large-scale real-world dataset containing 2.5M RGB-D images (1513 scans acquired in 707 different places, such as offices, apartments, and bathrooms). All the scans are annotated with estimated calibration parameters, camera poses, reconstructed 3D surfaces, textured meshes, dense object-level semantic segmentations, and aligned computer-aided design (CAD) models. MegaDepth [ref]42 is a large-scale dataset for the evaluation of depth estimation and/or correspondence matching algorithms. It uses SfM and multi-view stereo (MVS) techniques to acquire 3D point clouds, which can then be used to train and evaluate single-view depth estimation and/or correspondence matching networks. However, the 3D point clouds generated using SfM/MVS in the MegaDepth dataset are not sufficiently accurate and dense. Compared to the Aachen Day-Night [ref]39 and MegaDepth [ref]42 datasets which were created in outdoor scenarios, the Inloc  dataset focuses on indoor localization problems. The Inloc dataset consists of a database of RGB-D images, geometrically registered to the floor maps and augmented with a separate set of RGB target images (annotated with manually verified ground-truth 6DoF camera poses in the global coordinate system of the 3D map). Unlike the aforementioned datasets that are relatively ideal in terms of either motion or illumination conditions, TartanAir , a synthetic dataset used to evaluate visual SLAM algorithms, is collected using a photo-realistic simulator (with the presence of moving objects, changing illumination and weather conditions). Such a more challenging dataset fills the gap between synthetic and real-world datasets. Hpatches  are created using other public datasets. It can be split into two subsets: illumination and viewpoint, which are two crucial aspects of correspondence matching. It can also be split into three subsets: EASY, HARD, and TOUGH, according to the sizes of the overlapping areas between reference and target images. Randomly rotating the target images in the Hpatches  dataset produces a new dataset, referred to as Rotated-HPatches . Similar to the Hpatches and Rotated-HPatches datasets, our SIM2E dataset provides accurate subpixel correspondence matching ground truth. On the other hand, the illumination, rotation, and scaling changes are significant in our dataset. Therefore, compared to other existing public datasets, our SIM2E dataset can be used to evaluate the sim(2)-equivariant capability of correspondence matching algorithms more comprehensively. However, the size of the current version of our SIM2E dataset is small. We will therefore increase its size in our future work. The rotation distributions of Rotated-HPatches and our SIM2E subsets are shown in Fig. 3. It can be observed that in the Rotated-HPatches dataset, slight rotations (≤60∘absentsuperscript60\\leq 60^{\\circ}) account for a large proportion. In contrast, the three subsets of our SIM2E dataset are uniformly distributed. Most existing learning-based correspondence matching approaches have poor rotation-equivariant capabilities, and their performances are satisfactory only when there are slight rotations. Therefore, our SIM2E dataset can provide more acceptable results when evaluating the rotation-equivariant capability of a given correspondence matching algorithm.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: As shown in Table. 1, the existing datasets for correspondence matching algorithm evaluation can be grouped into two types: 3D scenes [ref]39  [ref]41 [ref]42   and planar scenes  .
