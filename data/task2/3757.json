While Bi-LSTM models outfits as a sequence of items, SiameseNet, Type-Aware, CSA-Net and SCE-Net\nlearn pairwise compatibility of items and aggregates the pairwise compatibility scores for all possible pairs in an outfit to learn the compatibility.\nOn the contrary, we use self-attention to learn high-order compatibility relationships between outfit items.\nWe report the performance of [ref]6 from the paper [ref]14\nas the authors report performance on Maryland Polyvore  but not on Polyvore Outfits dataset [ref]25.\n[ref]6 requires information from a large number of neighbors in a catalog for best performance, which is impractical for our setting because we do not have prior knowledge about connections between each new item to the existing items, as mentioned in . So, we use k=0 (no neighbors) for a fair comparison.\nWe observe that using just image features; we outperform other methods that use both image and text features on the compatibility prediction task.\nUsing text features boosts performance further. The methods [ref]25   employ a pairwise model where they require careful selection of negatives and data augmentation. Our approach uses the outfit compatibility data provided without using any additional strategies and still outperforms the state of the art methods. From Table 1, we observe that transformers can learn better compatibility relationships than other methods [ref]6  that learn compatibility at an outfit-level.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: all possible pairs in an outfit to learn the compatibility.\nOn the contrary, we use self-attention to learn high-order compatibility relationships between outfit items.\nWe report the performance of [ref]6 from the paper [ref]14\nas the authors report performance on Maryland Polyvore  but not on Polyvore Outfits dataset [ref]25.\n[ref]6 requires information from a large number of neighbors in a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
