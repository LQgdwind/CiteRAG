      "content": "Paper Title: Ultra-low Precision Multiplication-free Training for Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compute the energy consumption of existing methods, including INQ [ref]38, LogNN [ref]24, ShiftCNN [ref]15, AdderNet , DeepShift , ShiftAddNet , S2FP8 , and LUQ . First, we give which operations are used in MACs for forward and backward propagation. Then, we compute the energy consumption of MACs for training ResNet50 on ImageNet with the data in Table 1. There are 12.36​G12.36𝐺12.36G MACs for training ResNet50 on ImageNet at one iteration. We compute the total energy consumption by multiplying the energy consumption of operations in a MAC with the MAC numbers. INQ [ref]38 and ShiftCNN [ref]15 convert W𝑊W to 5-bit or 4-bit PoT by fine-tuning the pre-trained models. Thus, the MACs during forward and backward propagation consist of FP32 multiplications and FP32 additions for training, while the FP32 multiplications in MACs during forward for inference are replaced with INT32-4 bitwise shift (shifting up to 4-bit on INT32 numbers).\nLogNN [ref]24 converts W𝑊W and A𝐴A to 4-bit PoT by fine-tuning the pre-trained models, which is similar or INQ. In addition, it also try to train from scratch, however, it does not conduct experiments on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet.\nAdderNet  replaces the FP32 multiplications in MACs with FP32 additions, so there are two FP32 additions in a MAC operation.\nDeepShift  converts W𝑊W to 5-bit PoT numbers and trains the models from scratch. Thus, the multiplications during forward propagation are replaced with INT32-4 bitwise Shift, and half of the multiplications (W​G𝑊𝐺WG) during backward propagation can be replaced with INT8 additions on the exponent part of FP32 G𝐺G.\nShiftAddNet  combines the bitwise shift operations in DeepShift and the additions in AdderNet, so it replaces the multiplications during forward propagation to INT32-4 bitwise shifts and FP32 additions, and replaces half of the multiplications during backward propagation to INT32-4 bitwise shifts. Moreover, S2FP8  quantizes W𝑊W, A𝐴A, and G𝐺G to FP8 numbers, and the multiplications in MAC for forward and backward propagation are replaced with FP8 multiplications. Ultra-low  uses radix-4 float point numbers, which are not supported by the radix-2 hardware, so we do not compute its energy consumption here. LUQ  quantizes W𝑊W and A𝐴A to INT4 numbers, and converts G𝐺G to 4-bit PoT numbers. Thus, it replaces the multiplications during forward propagation to INT4 multiplications and the multiplications during backward propagation to INT4-3 bitwise shifts. In addition, these three quantization training works introduce extra FP32 multiplications in their methods.\nTo avoid ambiguity, we do not compute the energy consumption of these extra multiplications and ignore these multiplications when computing their energy consumption. In total, we compute the MAC energy consumption in these works based on the energy consumption data in Table 1 and the analyses of operations.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: We compute the energy consumption of existing methods, including INQ [ref]38, LogNN [ref]24, ShiftCNN [ref]15, AdderNet , DeepShift , ShiftAddNet , S2FP8 , and LUQ .
