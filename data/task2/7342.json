Early models such as VisualGPT  provided foundational work in image captioning, while the BLIP series  [ref]26 extended capabilities to include visual question answering. Flamingo [ref]46 and Kosmos-1 [ref]47 demonstrated effective multi-modal understanding within image-text frameworks. LLaMA adaptations like LLaVA  and MiniGPT-4  utilize projection layers for connecting vision encoders and LLMs.\nCoGVLM  replicated close to double the parameters to build visual experts specializing in visual tokens, while similar to our exploration of positional encoding, they used share-by-one rather than the original approach.\nQwen-VL and BLIP series   use the Q-Former network to bridge text and image. The success of vision language models pivots upon adept visual encoding; hence, a curated selection of vision encoders, each with its own domain expertise, is crucial for holistic visual understanding.\nThe CLIP model by  employs contrastive learning to align images and text, effectively facilitating semantic image understanding.\nDinov2  from Meta advances self-supervised learning through a student-teacher network paradigm, developing spatial understanding with a robust ViT framework.\nMicrosoft’s LayoutLMv3 , on the other hand, presents a multimodal Transformer adept in document AI by bolstering word-patch alignment in a ViT model.\nConvnext  reintroduces the efficacy of ConvNets with its FCMAE framework and GRN layer, finetuned with ImageNet-22K data.\nThe Segment Anything Model (SAM) by  showcases exceptional segmentation prowess, trained on a vast dataset to champion zero-shot generalization in its ViT infrastructure.\nThe MAE  demonstrated remarkable denoising self-supervised capabilities, reconstructing images with a high degree of fidelity.\nYet these encoders, notably CLIP, possess limitations as evidenced by  highlighted its struggles with spatial orientation and ’s findings on object hallucination. Moreover,  recognized a division of competencies, noting more semantics in fully/weakly supervised encoders like CLIP, while others excel in fine-grained perception. have been evolving rapidly, with models like ImageBind-LLM  and PandaGPT  incorporating richer modality inputs, including audio and video. There is also a growing focus on region-level parsing , text-to-image generation , and 3D understanding . These models show that MLLMs can achieve meaningful performance across a range of tasks.\nMouSi, as a poly-visual-expert VLM, is easily adapted to multi-modal-expert models, which will be our future work.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: and visual processing, and they have shown promising results in various applications.
