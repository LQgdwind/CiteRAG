      "content": "Paper Title: DisCo-CLIP: A Distributed Contrastive Loss for Memory Efficient CLIP Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe idea behind CLIP  is to learn two representations via two encoders, an image encoder      and a text encoder [ref]8  . Its target is to encourage positive image-text pairs to have higher similarities, and enforce negative image-text pairs to have lower similarities.\nThe training is supervised by two contrastive losses, an image-to-text loss and a text-to-image loss.\nSuppose we have B𝐵B text-image pairs as a batch sending to two encoders and the model is trained using N𝑁N GPUs, with each GPU assigned b=BN𝑏𝐵𝑁b=\\frac{B}{N} pairs. Here, we use TA,IAsubscriptT𝐴subscriptI𝐴\\mathrm{T}_{A},\\mathrm{I}_{A} to denote all text and image features obtained from two encoders. Suppose the hidden dimension is D𝐷D, then the shapes of TA,IAsubscriptT𝐴subscriptI𝐴\\mathrm{T}_{A},\\mathrm{I}_{A} are both B×D𝐵𝐷B\\times D. In this way, our contrastive losses can be written as, where ℒ1​(IA,TA)subscriptℒ1subscriptI𝐴subscriptT𝐴\\mathcal{L}_{1}(\\mathrm{I}_{A},\\mathrm{T}_{A}) denotes the image-to-text loss, and ℒ2​(TA,IA)subscriptℒ2subscriptT𝐴subscriptI𝐴\\mathcal{L}_{2}(\\mathrm{T}_{A},\\mathrm{I}_{A}) represents the text-to-image loss. The image-to-text loss means that the loss is to encourage a given image to find\nits paired text from tens of thousands of texts, and similarly for the text-to-image loss. Motivated by the success of CLIP, many new methods have been proposed, such as FILIP , LiT , ALIGN , BASIC 6, BLIP 1, GIT , and K-LITE . FILIP attempts to obtain a fine-grained alignment between image patches and text words. In contrast, CLIP only obtains an image-level alignment between an image and a text sentence. FILIP achieves this goal by a modified contrastive loss. Instead of training both image and text models from scratch, LiT  shows that employing a pre-trained image model and locking it would greatly benefit zero-shot classification. Under the contrastive framework, ALIGN  and BASIC 6 investigate how the scaling up of model, data, and batch size benefits contrastive learning. Instead of only leveraging contrastive learning framework, BLIP 1 introduces a mixed contrastive learning and generative learning for vision-language model. Further, GIT  employs a pure generative learning framework and demonstrates its superior performance. The success of CLIP and the above methods highly depends on large-scale paired image-text data set  8 7  5 4. Compared with classification data sets, such as ImageNet 1K  and ImageNet 21K 3, which require careful human annotation, there are abundant paired image-text data on the Web and can be more easily collected 4. Large batch size is a prerequisite for vision-language contrastive learning.\nData Parallelism (DP) and Model Parallelism (MP) are two widely used methods in deep learning for distributed training   9 [ref]8  . There are many related works on this topic, such as DeepSpeed 9 0 1 and Colossal-AI . We recommend interested readers to refer to these papers for some common distributed learning techniques. In the following, we will describe several methods that trade computation for memory in the backbone part.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: The idea behind CLIP  is to learn two representations via two encoders, an image encoder      and a text encoder [ref]8  .
