      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Deep Probabilistic Approach for Partial Point Cloud Registration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets and Metrics. ModelNet40  contains 12,311 meshed CAD models from 40 categories. Following the data setup in¬† 1, each point cloud is sampled from ModelNet40 with 1,024 points followed by cropping and sub-sampling into two partial overlap settings: ModelNet has 73.5% pairwise overlap on average, and ModelLoNet contains a lower 53.6% average overlap. We train only on ModelNet and generalize to ModelLoNet. We follow¬†1 and measure the performance using Relative Rotation Error (RRE) and Relative Translation Error (RTE) on all point clouds and as Chamfer distance (CD) between scans. Baselines. We chose recent supervised SOTA methods: DCP-v2¬†[ref]44, OMNet¬†, RPM-Net¬†, Predator , REGTR¬†1, CoFiNet , and GeoTransformer[ref]38, as well as unsupervised method RIENet¬† and UGMM¬† as our baselines.\nFor traditional methods, we choose point-level methods ICP¬† and FGR¬†7, as well as probabilistic methods CPD¬†, GMMReg¬†, SVR¬†, and FilterReg¬† as baselines.\nFor Predator, RPM-Net, OMNet, and REGTR, we use the results provided in REGTR. In REGTR, Predator samples 450 points in the experiment, and OMNet obtained a slightly improved result in all categories.\nWe utilize the codes provided by the authors for probabilistic methods. To improve the results for partial registration, we replace PointNet with DGCNN in DeepGMR. Additionally, we use Open3D for ICP and FGR. Registration Results.\nTable¬†2 reports registration results on ModelNet40, in which the best results for each criterion are labeled in bold, and the best results by unsupervised methods are underlined.\nWe compare against the recent unsupervised¬† and supervised¬†[ref]44   1  [ref]38 methods. When compared with unsupervised methods, our UDPReg outperforms the correspondence-based CEMNet, RIENet and GMM-based UGMM¬† in all metrics under both normal overlap (ModelNet) and low overlap (ModelLoNet) regimes.\nCompared with supervised methods, our approach also achieves competitive results.\nSpecifically, our UDPReg outperforms all previous methods regarding rotation and translation criteria. It is worth noting that RPM-Net¬† additionally uses surface normals and is trained with transformation information. Despite this, the UDPReg still performs better. In addition to the quantitative results, Fig.¬†4 shows results on ModelNet with more than 70.0% partial overlap. We also offer registration results for ModelLoNet with more than 50.0% partial overlap in Fig.¬†5.\nCompared with the recent SOTA unsupervised method RIENet, our UDPReg recovers the transformation more accurately on the challenging dataset ModelLoNet. Loss Functions. We trained our model with different combinations of the local contrastive loss (LC), cross consistency loss (CC), and self-consistency loss (SC), where the experiments were conducted on both ModelNet and ModelLoNet. Table¬†3 shows that the cross-consistency, self-consistency, and local contrastive losses can boost registration precision. Specifically, for a single loss, self-consistency loss archives the best results, and local contrastive loss performs worse on all metrics on both datasets. Influence of the Number of Clusters.\nWe assess the effect of the number of clusters LùêøL for ModelNet and ModelLoNet.\nWe trained UDPReg with different values of LùêøL, from 4 to 160, and report the results in Table¬†4.\nUDPReg achieves the best results with L=64ùêø64L{=}64 on both benchmarks.\nThe results are stable for 16‚â§L‚â§9616ùêø9616{\\leq}L{\\leq}96. This suggests that the number of clusters has little influence as long as there are ‚Äúenough‚Äù. Importance of Individual Modules.\nIn the registration process, UDPReg extracts hierarchical correspondences from clusters to points. Therefore, we further explore the efficiency of the hierarchical registration strategy. Table¬†5 reports the results on ModelNet and ModelLoNet, where Cluster, Point, and Cluster-point indicate distribution-level, point-level, and distribution-based point-level correspondences, respectively. In the first experiment, we only used distribution-level correspondences for point cloud registration. Unsurprisingly, it performs worse on all metrics, indicating UDPReg benefits from point-level matching. In the second experiment, we directly predict the point-level correspondences to estimate transformation by performing feature matching. Its performance is still worse than that of the hierarchical registration strategy, further showing the effectiveness of our correspondence prediction strategy.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: using Relative Rotation Error (RRE) and Relative Translation Error (RTE) on all point clouds and as Chamfer distance (CD) between scans.
