      "content": "Paper Title: Interpretability of Machine Learning Methods Applied to Neuroimaging\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nContrary to the limited application of weight visualization, there is an extensive literature about leveraging individual feature maps and latent spaces to better understand how models work. This goes from the visualization of these maps or their projections  [ref]28 , to the analysis of neuron behavior [ref]30 , through sampling in latent spaces . Oh et al.  displayed the feature maps associated with the convolutional layers of CNNs trained for various Alzheimer’s disease status classification tasks (Figure 16). In the first two layers, the extracted features were similar to white matter, cerebrospinal fluid and skull segmentations, while the last layer showcased sparse, global and nearly binary patterns. They used this example to emphasize the advantage of using CNNs to extract very abstract and complex features rather than using custom algorithms for features extraction  . Another way to visualize a feature map is to project it in a two or three-dimensional space to understand how it is positioned with respect to other feature maps. Abrol et al. [ref]28 projected the features obtained after the first dense layer of a ResNet architecture onto a two-dimensional space using the classical t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) dimensionality reduction technique. For the classification task of Alzheimer’s disease statuses, they observed that the projections were correctly ordered according to the disease severity, supporting the correctness of the model [ref]28. They partitioned these projections into three groups: Far-AD (more extreme Alzheimer’s Disease patients), Far-CN (more extreme Cognitively Normal participants) and Fused (a set of images at the intersection of AD and CN groups). Using a t-test, they were able to detect and highlight voxels presenting significant differences between groups. Biffi et al.  not only used feature map visualization, but also sampled the feature space. Indeed, they trained a ladder variational autoencoder framework to learn hierarchical latent representations of 3D hippocampal segmentations of control subjects and Alzheimer’s disease patients. A multi-layer perceptron was jointly trained on top of the highest two-dimensional latent space to classify anatomical shapes. While lower spaces needed a dimensionality reduction technique (i.e. t-SNE), the highest latent space could directly be visualized, as well as the anatomical variability it captured in the initial input space, by leveraging the generative process of the model. This sampling enabled an easy visualization and quantification of the anatomical differences between each class. Finally, it may be very informative to better understand the behavior of neurons and what they are encoding. After training deep convolutional autoencoders to reconstruct MR images, segmented gray matter maps and white matter maps, Martinez-Murcia et al. [ref]30 computed correlations between each individual hidden neuron value and clinical information (e.g. age, mini-mental state examination) which allowed them to determine to which extent this information was encoded in the latent space. This way they determined which clinical data was the most strongly associated.\nUsing a collection of nine different MRI data sets, Leming et al.  trained CNNs for various classification tasks (autism vs typically developing, male vs female and task vs rest). They computed a diversity coefficient for each filter of the second layer based on its output feature map. They counted how many different data sets maximally activated each value of this feature map: if they were mainly activated by one source of data the coefficient would be close to 0, whereas if they were activated by all data sets it would be close to 1. This allows assessing the layer stratification, i.e. to understand if a given filter was mostly maximally activated by one phenotype or by a diverse population. They found out that a few filters were only maximally activated by images from a single MRI data set, and that the diversity coefficient was not normally distributed across filters, having generally two peaks at the beginning and at the end of the spectrum, respectively exhibiting the stratification and strongly diverse distribution of the filters.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: there is an extensive literature about leveraging individual feature maps and latent spaces to better understand how models work.
