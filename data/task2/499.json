      "content": "Paper Title: Vietnamese Word Segmentation with SVM: Ambiguity Reduction and Suffix Capture\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWord segmentation is an essential task in Vietnamese natural language processing, which has a significant impact on higher processing levels   . Unlike English, white spaces in Vietnamese written text can function as a syllable separator or a word separator. For example, the Vietnamese string “hiện đại hóa đất nước” (modernizehiện_đại_hoásubscriptmodernizehiện_đại_hoá\\text{modernize}_{\\text{hi\\@text@daccent{\\ecircumflex}n\\_\\dj\\@text@daccent{a}i\\_hoá}} countryđất_nướcsubscriptcountryđất_nước\\text{country}_{\\text{\\dj\\'{\\acircumflex}t\\_n\\uhorn\\'{\\ohorn}c}}), which consists of five syllables, is segmented into “hiện_đại_hoá đất_nước”. Underscores denote the white spaces which function as syllable separator, and white spaces are used for word separation. Vietnamese word segmentation can be considered as a binary classification problem with two classes: underscore and white-space 2. Vietnamese is an isolated language and every Vietnamese word has exactly one form . Vietnamese words are constituted by one or more syllables. According to the statistics reported in , and 4, about 16% of Vietnamese words are single-syllable words and 71% are two-syllable words. Single-syllable words account for about 81% of Vietnamese syllables, which means 19% syllables are not meaningful when standing alone. The string “loại hình phạt” (3 syllables) can be segmented as “loại_hình phạt” (typeloại_hìnhsubscripttypeloại_hình\\text{type}_{\\text{lo\\@text@daccent{a}i\\_hình}} penalizephạtsubscriptpenalizephạt\\text{penalize}_{\\text{ph\\@text@daccent{a}t}}) or “loại hình_phạt” (typeloạisubscripttypeloại\\text{type}_{\\text{lo\\@text@daccent{a}i}} penaltyhình_phạtsubscriptpenaltyhình_phạt\\text{penalty}_{\\text{hình\\_ph\\@text@daccent{a}t}}). This phenomenon is called “overlap ambiguity involving three consecutive syllables” by the authors in . All of the above have created challenges in Vietnamese word segmentation 3. We have an observation that solving overlap ambiguity is essential for the Vietnamese word segmentation task. The authors in  proposed the ambiguity resolver, which uses a bi-gram language model. Their proposal has slightly improved the Vietnamese word segmentation result. Additionally, the binary classifier for the Vietnamese word segmentation trained by the authors in 4 still causes overlap ambiguity cases. They used rules based on the dictionary and threshold for the classifier in the post-processing phase to handle overlap ambiguities. Experimental results on the benchmark Vietnamese treebank show that the approach of the authors in 4 outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method of the authors in . Therefore, we decided to inspire the idea from the authors in 4 in handling overlap ambiguities. However, we have assumed how the performance of our method changes when using feature templates to reduce overlap ambiguity cases without post-processing. From a different point of view, the authors in  proposed affixes features as a part of the rich feature set in their Vietnamese POS tagging method. Additionally, the authors in  utilized potential affixes to improve the performance of unknown words (accuracy of 80.69% on Vietnamese POS tagging task of Vietnamese treebank 2). In practice, we can not perform part-of-speech (POS) tagging for unknown words if these unknown words can not be constituted by machine annotated word segmentation. Therefore, we decide to study the impact of affixes on the performance of word segmentation. We approach Vietnamese word segmentation with a uni-directional model in which labels are predicted from left to right of a sentence based on a syllable window. Because those labels from the left hand have been predicted, we can utilize information of suffixes to improve Vietnamese word segmentation. In this paper, we propose a feature-based method using SVM classifier to solve the Vietnamese word segmentation task. Our method considers Vietnamese word segmentation as a binary classification with two classes: underscore and white-space 4, in which a majority of feature templates are inherited from the research of the authors in  4. Two novel feature templates in our method are to reduce ambiguity cases and capture unknown words containing suffixes. Our proposed method obtained better F1​-scoresubscriptF1-score\\text{F}_{\\text{1}}\\text{-score} than the previous state-of-the-art methods JVnSegmenter , vnTokenizer , DongDu , UETsegmenter 4, and RDRsegmenter [ref]9 measured on the Vietnamese treebank 2 for Vietnamese word segmentation task. Additionally, we used VnMarMoT 0 on the result of our word segmentation method. On the benchmark Vietnamese treebank 2, we achieved result better F1​-scoresubscriptF1-score\\text{F}_{\\text{1}}\\text{-score} than previous state-of-the-art result 0 on Vietnamese POS Tagging task when using predicted segmentation instead of gold segmentation.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: method obtained better F1​-scoresubscriptF1-score\\text{F}_{\\text{1}}\\text{-score} than the previous state-of-the-art methods JVnSegmenter , vnTokenizer , DongDu , UETsegmenter 4, and RDRsegmenter [ref]9 measured on the Vietnamese treebank 2 for Vietnamese word segmentation task.
