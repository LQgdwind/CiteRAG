      "content": "Paper Title: CPLIP: Zero-Shot Learning for Histopathology with Comprehensive Vision-Language Alignment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the field of histopathology, publicly accessible image-text paired datasets are scarce.\nThe only publicly available image-text histology dataset is the ARCH dataset , which consists of 8,617 image-text pairs derived from 12,676 journal articles on clinical and research pathology.\nWe fine-tuned our proposed CPLIP algorithm using the ARCH dataset, which contains histology images without using their corresponding textual descriptions.\nWe expanded each image into approximately 21 images and 17 different textual descriptions, resulting in a total of 180,000 images and 146,000 textual descriptions.\nWhile the ARCH dataset was also used by MI-Zero [ref]29 during training, they employed image-text paired data, whereas our algorithm requires unpaired many-to-many image-text alignment. We fine-tuned our proposed CPLIP model by initializing weights using different image encoders and text encoders.\nFor a performance comparison of our CPLIP model under different settings, refer to Table 7.\nThe following different image-text encoders were employed during fine-tuning our CPLIP model: Similar to the other SOTA methods [ref]17  [ref]29, we fine-tuned the baseline CLIP 2 with a ViT-B/16-224  as image encoder and a GPT-2/77  as text encoder (Table 7). Given that the baseline CLIP is trained on out-of-domain paired data, we also fine-tuned our CPLIP model using a pathology domain-specific pre-trained PLIP [ref]17 with a PLIP-ViT-B/32-224 as image encoder and a GPT-2/347 as text encoder (Table 7). Additionally, we fine-tuned the CPLIP model using BioClinicalBert/512  and PubMedBERT/256  as the text encoders and CTransPath/224 9 as the image encoder, similar to MI-zero and BiomedCLIP  (Table 7).\nBioClinicalBert and PubMedBERT are medical-specific non-pathology text encoders trained on biomedical and clinical corpora such as PubMed abstracts and MIMIC , while CTransPath is trained using self-supervised representation learning on a total of 15.5 million unlabeled histology patches.\nBoth of these encoders utilized ViT-B/16. We fine-tuned our CPLIP algorithm using BioClinicalBert/512 as the text encoder and PLIP-ViT-B/32-224 as the in-domain image encoder (Table 7). We also fine-tuned our CPLIP algorithm using CTransPath/224 as the in-domain image encoder and PLIP-GPT/347 as the in-domain text encoder (Table 7). Across all visual-language pre-training variants, we trained our models using a temperature parameter of 0.02, the AdamW optimizer  with an initial learning rate of 5√ó10‚àí65superscript1065\\times 10^{-6}, and a cosine decay scheduler.\nWe trained our models with a\nbatch size of 256 for 50 epochs.\nWe set the filtering thresholds Œ¥tsubscriptùõøùë°\\delta_{t} and Œ¥vsubscriptùõøùë£\\delta_{v} to discard 10% of the data from each bag.\nAfter filtering, the bag of textual descriptions was reduced to 15 items and the bag of visual concepts was reduced to 19 items.\nExperiments are conducted using both single and merged prompts at inference time similar to  for fair comparison.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: image into approximately 21 images and 17 different textual descriptions, resulting in a total of 180,000 images and 146,000 textual descriptions.\nWhile the ARCH dataset was also used by MI-Zero [ref]29 during training, they employed image-text paired data, whereas our algorithm requires unpaired many-to-many image-text alignment.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
