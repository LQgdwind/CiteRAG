      "content": "Paper Title: Landscape Surrogate: Learning Decision Losses for Mathematical Optimization Under Partial Information\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMathematical optimization problems in various settings have been widely studied, and numerous methods exist to solve them¬† 2. Although the literature on this topic is immense, real-world applications consider settings that are nontrivial or extremely costly to solve. The issue often stems from uncertainty in the objective or in the problem definition. For example, combinatorial problems involving nonlinear objectives are generally hard to address, even if there are efficient methods that can handle special cases (e.g., kùëòk-means). One possible approach could be learning so-called linear surrogate costs¬†[ref]16 that guide an efficient linear solver towards high quality solutions for the original hard nonlinear problem. This automatically finds a surrogate mixed integer linear program (MILP), for which relatively efficient solvers exist¬†. Another example is the smart predict+optimize framework (a.k.a. decision-focused learning)¬† [ref]41 where some problem parameters are unknown at test time and must be inferred from the observed input using a model (e.g., neural nets). Despite having completely different settings and purposes, what is common among learning surrogate costs, smart predict+optimize, and other integrations of learning and optimization, is the need to learn a certain target mapping to estimate the parameters of a latent optimization problem. This makes the optimization problem well-defined, easy to address, or both. In this work, we draw general connections between different problem families and combine them into a unified framework. The core idea (section¬†3) is to formulate the learning problem via constructing a compound function f‚àòùê†ùëìùê†f\\circ\\mathbf{g} that includes a parametric solver ùê†ùê†\\mathbf{g} and the original objective fùëìf. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to propose a generic optimization formulation (section¬†3) for these types of problems. Minimizing this new compound function f‚àòùê†ùëìùê†f\\circ\\mathbf{g} via gradient descent is a nontrivial task as it requires differentiation through the argmin operator. Although various methods have been proposed to tackle this issue¬† , they have several limitations. First, they are not directly applicable to combinatorial optimization problems, which have 0 gradient almost everywhere, and thus require various computationally expensive approximations¬†4 [ref]41  9. Second, even if the decision variables are continuous, the solution space (i.e., argmin) may be discontinuous. Some papers¬†  discuss the fully continuous domain but typically involve computing the Jacobian matrix, which leads to scalability issues. Furthermore, in some cases, an explicit expression for the objective may not be given, and we may only have black-box access to the objective function, preventing straightforward end-to-end backpropagation. These limitations motivate Landscape Surrogate losses (LANCER), a unified model for solving coupled learning and optimization problems. LANCER¬†accurately approximates the behavior of the compound function f‚àòùê†ùëìùê†f\\circ\\mathbf{g}, allowing us to use it to learn our target parametric mapping (see fig.¬†1). Intuitively, LANCER¬†must be differentiable and smooth (e.g., neural nets) to enable exact and efficient gradient computation. Furthermore, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm that jointly trains LANCER¬†and the parameters of the target mapping. Our motivation is that training LANCER¬†in this manner better distills task-specific knowledge, resulting in improved overall performance. Experimental evaluations (section¬†5) confirm this hypothesis and demonstrate the scalability of our proposed method. The implementation of LANCER can be found at https://github.com/facebookresearch/LANCER.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: are generally hard to address, even if there are efficient methods that can handle special cases (e.g., kùëòk-means).
