Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Diversity is Definitely Needed: Improving Model-Agnostic Zero-shot Classification via Stable Diffusion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince our research’s inception, several papers have investigated utilizing diffusion models to extend real datasets for domain adaptation , semi-supervised learning , or generating data augmentations [ref]34 . In our work, we concentrate solely on training downstream models on entirely synthetic generated datasets. This differs from the two closest works to ours [ref]8 [ref]2, as He et al. [ref]8 studies if synthetic images from a diffusion model, GLIDE 9, can be used to fine-tune CLIPs zero-shot and few-shot performance. With respect to training downstream models on synthetic data they conclude synthetic images are 5×5\\times less data efficient than real images. Additionally, He et al. [ref]8 show synthetic images can effectively pre-train a classifier, on par with ImageNet pre-training. While Besnier et al. [ref]2 use a GAN pre-trained on ImageNet  and propose strategies for improving the training quality of the generated images. With their improvements they were able to achieve 88.8% accuracy on ImageNet-10 when training on synthetic images, compared to 88.4% on real images. In our work, we generate training images using a diffusion model trained on a much larger dataset and distribution of images.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: Since our research’s inception, several papers have investigated utilizing diffusion models to extend real datasets for domain adaptation , semi-supervised learning , or generating data augmentations [ref]34 .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
