Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Socio-Technical Imaginaries of an EdTech Revolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAIEd has been under active research for several decades now  [ref]7 and has made significant advances in different fronts, specially in areas such as intelligent tutoring (ITS) , educational recommendations [ref]27, MOOC management   and taxonomy/prerequisite detection , among others.\nRecent work has also shown that AI could be used to accumulate learning resources at scale , as well as enrich these to break language barriers by creating cross-lingual translations/transcriptions , domain/language-agnostic topic annotations  and visual and interactive content summaries that support the learner [ref]5 8.\nThe ultimate ambition of AIEd would be a lifelong learning companion\n, that understands the strengths and weaknesses of individual learners to present materials and exercises to increase their learning gains, while providing prompt feedback when needed. Being able to cooperatively operate across languages, cultures and special needs of individuals would make this companion humane. Above all, this companion should interplay with political and operational constraints, respecting privacy, safety and prioritising the learner autonomy and agency, moving away from prescriptive AI. Such technology should also allow teachers to use their training and experience to fulfil less mundane tasks such as personal attention, advance pedagogy, pastoral care and other complex support tasks that preserve equity in the classroom. These systems can also enable teachers, educators and researchers to carry out valuable research and hypothesis testing that will lead to a better understanding of pedagogy itself. While being an ambitious and impactful destination (dreamed since 1972 2), achieving such a technology may be further down the line than we think.\nWe believe that by shifting the paradigm to augmenting teacher/stakeholder capabilities, rather than replacing them, AIEd can bear more fruits in the short-term, while journeying at the same time towards a sustainable large-scale lifelong educational practice enhanced by AI.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: AIEd has been under active research for several decades now  [ref]7 and has made significant advances in different fronts, specially in areas such as intelligent tutoring (ITS) , educational recommendations [ref]27, MOOC management   and taxonomy/prerequisite\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
