      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Vision-and-Language Pre-training via Retrieval-based Multi-Granular Alignment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInspired by the success of natural language processing  , there is a recent surge of interest in pre-training for vision and language.\nFor example, there are different architectures (e.g. two-stream models    4  7 vs. single-stream models    [ref]8 ), features (e.g. regions  vs. grids 6), backbones (e.g. ConvNets 6 vs. Transformers 8) etc.\nAll these works aim to exploit the large-scale aligned image-text corpora     7 to pre-train a powerful multi-modal model, which is then adapted to various downstream V+L tasks, such as VQA , NLVR2 , Visual Entailment (VE) 2, Referring Expression Comprehension 5, and Image-Text Retrieval. Various pre-training tasks have been introduced to achieve this, including the most notable Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Region Modeling (MRM), and Image-Text Matching (ITM).\nSeveral other variants have also been explored, such as predicting the object tags 8 4, sequence generation 9 1, word-region alignment [ref]8.\nIn this paper, we propose learning a multi-granular alignment between word and region, phrase and region, and image and sentence to better bridge the gap between vision and language. Inspired by the works on multi-lingual contextual language modeling  2 1 0, U-VisualBERT 6 first propose the unsupervised vision-and-language pre-training without parallel data (UVLP).\nU-VisualBERT 6 conducts the masked prediction on the text-only and image-only corpora and introduce the object tags as anchor points to bridge the two modalities.\nThe authors treat the tags as a sentence when performing MLM, where tags provide alignment with the regions in a picture and implicitly learn a tag-region-level alignment.\nHowever, the anchor tags are still quite different from the text input, missing the sentence completeness and naturalness.\nBesides, the latent cross-modal alignment is shown to be important in our analysis (from Fig. 1).\nAs comparison, our pre-training involves a retrieval-based weakly aligned V+L data construction and learns a more comprehensive multi-granular cross-modal alignment.\nWith same data as U-VisualBERT, our approach achieves a clear and consistent gain across all the downstream tasks in our experiments.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: processing  , there is a recent surge of interest in pre-training for vision and language.\nFor example, there are different architectures (e.g. two-stream models    4  7 vs. single-stream models    [ref]8 ), features (e.g. regions  vs. grids 6), backbones (e.g. ConvNets 6 vs. Transformers 8) etc.\nAll these works aim to exploit the large-scale aligned image-text corpora     7 to pre-train a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
