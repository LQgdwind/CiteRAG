Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

We conducted experiments on three\ncross-view panorama datasets, i.e., CVUSA ¬† [ref]46, CVACT ¬†[ref]22, and VIGOR ¬†[ref]53. CVUSA and CVACT consist of various images captured in rural and urban areas, each with 35,532 ground-satellite pairs for training and 8,884 pairs for evaluation. Besides, CVACT has an additional test dataset including 92802 image pairs. In the two datasets, each satellite-view image has one corresponding street-view image, and all pairs are aligned with the similar spatial localization¬† and orientation¬†. We evaluate the results of our un- and semi-supervised settings in the two datasets. VIGOR has 105,214 panoramas and 90,618 aerial images from four cities. Due to the complex city scenes, the projection between ground and satellite images is hard on VIGOR, even in supervised settings¬†. So it is difficult for us to solve the cold-start problem by simple homography projection¬† in unsupervised settings. We provide a semi-supervised method for it. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to remove GPS labels and ground-satellite pair annotations in CVGL. Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate the retrieval performance by top-kùëòk recall accuracy (R@kùëòk)¬†. Specifically, for each query ground image, we retrieve the kùëòk nearest reference neighbors in the embedding spaces based on cosine similarity. A retrieval is considered correct if the ground-truth satellite image appears among the top kùëòk retrieved images.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: Datasets.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
