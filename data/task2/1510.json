      "content": "Paper Title: Studying Catastrophic Forgetting in Neural Ranking Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven a neural model M𝑀M designed for an ad-hoc ranking task, the primary objectives of our experiments are twofold: O1) measuring the catastrophic forgetting of model M𝑀M while applying a domain adaptation method 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}, in line of RQ1 and RQ2; and O2) evaluating the effect of a lifelong learning method ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in model M𝑀M, in line of RQ3. We assume that model M𝑀M learns a ranking task across a stream of n𝑛n domain datasets {D1,…,Dn}subscript𝐷1…subscript𝐷𝑛\\{D_{1},\\dots,D_{n}\\} coming in a sequential manner one by one. At a high level, our experimental set up is: \n\n\n1.\n\nSet up an ordered dataset stream setting D1→…​Dn−1→Dn→subscript𝐷1…subscript𝐷𝑛1→subscript𝐷𝑛D_{1}\\rightarrow\\dots D_{n-1}\\rightarrow D_{n}\n\n2.\n\nLearn oracle models Mi∗,i=1​…​nsuperscriptsubscript𝑀𝑖𝑖1…𝑛M_{i}^{*},i=1\\dots n, with parameters θ^i⁣∗superscript^𝜃𝑖\\hat{\\theta}^{i*} by training the neural ranking model M𝑀M on training instances of dataset Di,i=1​…​nsubscript𝐷𝑖𝑖1…𝑛D_{i},i=1\\dots n.\n\n3.\n\nMeasure the retrieval performance Ri,i∗superscriptsubscript𝑅𝑖𝑖R_{i,i}^{*} of each oracle model Mi∗superscriptsubscript𝑀𝑖M_{i}^{*} on testing instances of the same dataset Disubscript𝐷𝑖D_{i}.\n\n4.\n\nLaunch a domain adaptation method 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} w.r.t. to objective O1 (resp. a lifelong learning method ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} w.r.t. to objective O2) along the considered setting as follows:\n\n•\n\nInitialize (k=1𝑘1k=1) model Mksubscript𝑀𝑘M_{k}, with θ^1⁣∗superscript^𝜃1\\hat{\\theta}^{1*}, parameters of model M1∗superscriptsubscript𝑀1M_{1}^{*} (trained on the dataset base D1subscript𝐷1D_{1}).\n\n•\n\nRepeat\n\n–\n\nApply to model Mksubscript𝑀𝑘M_{k} a method 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} w.r.t to objective O1 (resp. method ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} w.r.t. to objective O2) to transfer knowledge to the right dataset Dk+1subscript𝐷𝑘1D_{k+1} (forward transfer). The resulting model is noted Mk+1subscript𝑀𝑘1M_{k+1} with parameters θ^k+1superscript^𝜃𝑘1\\hat{\\theta}^{k+1}. Its performance on dataset Dk+1subscript𝐷𝑘1D_{k+1} is noted Rk+1,k+1subscript𝑅𝑘1𝑘1R_{k+1,k+1}.\n\n–\n\nMeasure the retrieval performance Rk+1,ksubscript𝑅𝑘1𝑘R_{k+1,k} of model Mk+1subscript𝑀𝑘1M_{k+1} obtained on the testing instances of left dataset Dksubscript𝐷𝑘D_{k} (backward transfer)\n\n–\n\nMove to the next right dataset : k=k+1𝑘𝑘1k=k+1\n\n\n\n•\n\nUntil the end of the dataset stream setting (k=n𝑘𝑛k=n).\n\n\n\n5.\n\nMeasure catastrophic forgetting in model M𝑀M.\n\n\n\n This experimental pipeline, illustrated in Figure 1, follows general guidelines adopted in previous work  0 6. We detail below the main underlying components highlighted in bold. We evaluate catastrophic forgetting in five (5) state-of-the-art models selected from a list of models criticallly evaluated in Yang et al. [ref]52: 1) interaction-based models: DRMM 4 and PACRR  and KNRM ; 2) BERT-based models: Vanilla BERT  and CEDR-KNRM . We use the OpenNIR framework  that provides a complete neural ad-hoc document ranking pipeline. Note that in this framework, the neural models are trained by linearly combining their own score (SN​Nsubscript𝑆𝑁𝑁S_{NN}) with a BM25 score (SB​M​25subscript𝑆𝐵𝑀25S_{BM25}). We use the three following datasets: 1) MS MARCO (ms)  a passage ranking dataset which includes more than 864 K question-alike queries sampled from the Bing search log and a large-scale web document set including 8841823 documents; 2) TREC Microblog (mb) 7, a real-time ad-hoc search dataset from TREC Microblog 2013 and 2014, which contains a public Twitter sample stream between February 1 and March 31, 2013 including 124969835 tweets and 115 queries submitted at a specific point in time; 3) TREC CORD19 (c19)  an ad-hoc document search dataset which contains 50 question-alike queries and a corpora of 191175 published research articles dealing with SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 topics. It is worth mentioning that these datasets fit with the requirement of cross-domain adaptation  since they have significant differences in both their content and sources. Besides, we consider four settings (See Table LABEL:tab:omega_results_map, column ”Setting”) among which three 2-dataset (n=2𝑛2n=2) and one 3-dataset (n=3𝑛3n=3) settings. As done in previous work  6, these settings follow the patterns (D1→D2→subscript𝐷1subscript𝐷2D_{1}\\rightarrow D_{2}) or (D1→D2→D3→subscript𝐷1subscript𝐷2→subscript𝐷3D_{1}\\rightarrow D_{2}\\rightarrow D_{3}) where dataset orders are based on the decreasing sizes of the training sets assuming that larger datasets allow starting with well-trained networks. We adopt fine-tuning (training on one domain and fine-tuning on the other) as the representative domain adaptation task 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} since it suffers from the catastrophic forgetting problem  2. Additionally, we adopt the Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) 2 as the lifelong learning method ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}. The EWC constrains the loss function with an additional forget cost term that we add to the objective function of each of the five neural models studied in this work. Basically speaking, EWC constrains the neural network-based model to remember knowledge acquired on left datasets by reducing the overwriting of its most important parameters as: where ℒ​(θ^k)ℒsuperscript^𝜃𝑘\\mathcal{L}(\\hat{\\theta}^{k}) is the loss of the neural ranking model with parameters θksuperscript𝜃𝑘\\theta^{k} obtained right after learning on (Dksubscript𝐷𝑘D_{k}), λ𝜆\\lambda is the importance weight of the models parameters trained on left datasets (Di,i<ksubscript𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑘D_{i},i<k) with the current one (Dksubscript𝐷𝑘D_{k}), ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} is the Fisher information matrix. Given the setting (D1→…→Dn→subscript𝐷1…→subscript𝐷𝑛D_{1}\\rightarrow\\dots\\rightarrow D_{n}), we use the remembering measure (REM) derived from the backward transfer measure (BWT) proposed by Rodriguez et al.  as follows: ∙∙\\bullet BWT: measures the intrinsic effect (either positive or negative) that learning a model M𝑀M on a new dataset (right in the setting) has on the model performance obtained on an old dataset (left in the setting), referred as backward transfer. Practically, in line with a lifelong learning perspective, this measure averages along the setting the differences between the performances of the model obtained right after learning on the left dataset and the performances of the oracle model trained and tested on the same left dataset. Thus, while positive values handle positive backward transfer, negative values handle catastrophic forgetting. Formally, the BWT measure is computed as: Ri,jsubscript𝑅𝑖𝑗R_{i,j} is the performance measure of model Misubscript𝑀𝑖M_{i} obtained right after learning on on dataset Djsubscript𝐷𝑗D_{j}. Rj,j∗superscriptsubscript𝑅𝑗𝑗R_{j,j}^{*} is the performance of the oracle model Mj∗superscriptsubscript𝑀𝑗M_{j}^{*} trained on dataset Djsubscript𝐷𝑗D_{j} and tested on the same dataset. To make fair comparisons between the different studied neural models, we normalize the differences in performance (Ri,j−Rj,j∗subscript𝑅𝑖𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑅𝑗𝑗R_{i,j}-R_{j,j}^{*}) on model agnostic performances obtained using B​M​25𝐵𝑀25BM25 model on each left dataset Djsubscript𝐷𝑗D_{j}. In our work, we use the standard IR performance measures MAP, NDCG@20 and P@20 to measure Ri,jsubscript𝑅𝑖𝑗R_{i,j} but we only report the REM values computed using the MAP measure, as they all follow the same general trends. ∙∙\\bullet REM: because the BWT measure assumes either positive values for positive backward transfer and negative values for catastrophic forgetting, it allows to map with a positive remembering value in the range  1  as follows: A REM value equals to 1 means that the model does not catastrophically forget. To better measure the intrinsic ability of the neural ranking models to remember previously acquired knowledge, we deploy in the OpenNIR framework two runs for each neural model based on the score combination (s​c​o​r​eG=α×SN​N+(1−α)×SB​M​25𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟subscript𝑒𝐺𝛼subscript𝑆𝑁𝑁1𝛼subscript𝑆𝐵𝑀25score_{G}=\\alpha\\times S_{NN}+(1-\\alpha)\\times S_{BM25}). The first one by considering the neural model after a re-ranking setup (0<α<10𝛼10<\\alpha<1) leading to compute an overall R​E​M𝑅𝐸𝑀REM measure on the ranking model. The second one by only considering the neural ranking based on the SN​Nsubscript𝑆𝑁𝑁S_{NN} score by totally disregarding the BM25 scores (α=1𝛼1\\alpha=1). R​E​M​N𝑅𝐸𝑀𝑁REMN denotes the remembering measure computed in this second run.\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: below the main underlying components highlighted in bold.
