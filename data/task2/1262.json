Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

In, , they combine mid-level features from the neural network using a residual prediction task to tackle the CDFSL problem when transferring from ImageNet to medical malaria images. In , simple learned Feature-Wise Transformations (FWT) are combined with meta-learning methods to aid domain adaptation. In [ref]12, all previous meta-learning methods, inclusive of the use of feature-wise transformations, under-perform by 12.8% even when compared to simple fine-tuning methods. In contrast, transfer-learning methods such as Transductive Fine-tuning (TransFT) [ref]6 and Incremental Multi-Model Selection (IMS-f) perform significantly better. IMS-f, however, transfers from multiple models trained on a range of source datasets by using a linear classifier on feature vectors from each layer of different models. In our work, we restrict our pre-trained models to be trained on the miniImageNet dataset. We also differ in that we aim to train the network to learn a good initialization to fine-tune the last residual block.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Most previous work on CD-FSL has domains only belonging to natural images [ref]3  , with two notable exceptions: [ref]12 and .
