Neither the European Union nor the granting authority can be held responsible for them.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur first main result is that extensional ESO and the complement of Her−FOHerFO\\operatorname{Her-FO} have the same computational power,\nin the sense that for every sentence ΦΦ\\Phi in extensional ESO there exists a first-order formula ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi such that\nHer⁡(ϕ)Heritalic-ϕ\\operatorname{Her}(\\phi) is polynomial-time (in fact, log-space) equivalent to the problem described by the negation of ΦΦ\\Phi,\nand vice versa. In particular, this implies that for every CSP of a finitely bounded structure 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B}, there exists a\nfirst-order sentence ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi such that CSP⁡(𝔹)CSP𝔹\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{B}) and the complement of Her⁡(ϕ)Heritalic-ϕ\\operatorname{Her}(\\phi) are polynomial-time equivalent.\nNote that we wrote ‘a finitely bounded structure’ rather than ‘a reduct of a finitely bounded structure’, so our result\ndoes not imply that Her−FOHerFO\\operatorname{Her-FO} is NP-rich. In fact, our next result implies that Her−FOHerFO\\operatorname{Her-FO} cannot be NP-rich (actually,\nnot even disjunctive NP-rich), unless E = NE (exponential time equals non-deterministic exponential time). The assumption\nthat E ≠\\neq NE is stronger than the usual assumption that P ≠\\neq NP, but still a common assumption in complexity\ntheory   [ref]50. To prove this result, we show that every problem in extensional ESO is\ndisjunctively self-reducible; we also show that the class of disjunctively self-reducible sets does not exhibit a complexity dichotomy (Theorem 6.3). The question whether a given ESO sentence describes a polynomial-time solvable problem is easily seen to be undecidable (see, e.g., Theorem 1.4.2 in ).\nThis motivates\nquantifier-prefix dichotomy results for existential second-order\nlogic  . For instance, the classification for monadic ESO is as follows (see Figure 1 (a) in \nfor the full classification). For every quantifier-prefix Q∈{∃,∀}∗𝑄superscriptfor-all∗Q\\in\\{\\exists,\\forall\\}^{\\ast} the following holds: either Q𝑄Q is of the form ∃∗∀superscript∗for-all\\exists^{\\ast}\\forall, and in this case every monadic ESO sentence ΦΦ\\Phi whose first-order part has\na quantifier-free prefix Q𝑄Q\nis polynomial-time decidable, or Q𝑄Q contains ∀∀for-allfor-all\\forall\\forall or ∀∃for-all\\forall\\exists as subwords, and in this case there is an ESO sentence ΦΦ\\Phi whose\nfirst-order part has quantifier-prefix Q𝑄Q and deciding ΦΦ\\Phi is NP-complete. Another main contribution of the present paper is the following classification of the computational complexity of problems in\nHer−FOHerFO\\operatorname{Her-FO} based on the quantifier prefix Q∈{∃,∀}∗𝑄superscriptfor-allQ\\in\\{\\exists,\\forall\\}^{*} of the fixed first-order formula: either Q𝑄Q is of the form ∀∗∃∗superscriptfor-allsuperscript\\forall^{*}\\exists^{*} or the form ∀∗∃∀∗superscriptfor-allsuperscriptfor-all\\forall^{*}\\exists\\forall^{*}, and in this case Her⁡(ϕ)Heritalic-ϕ\\operatorname{Her}(\\phi) is\npolynomial-time decidable for every first-order formula ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi with quantifier-prefix Q𝑄Q, or Q𝑄Q contains ∃∃∀for-all\\exists\\exists\\forall or some subword of the form ∃∀∀∗∃for-allsuperscriptfor-all\\exists\\forall\\forall^{*}\\exists, and in this case\nthere are first-order formulas with quantifier prefix Q𝑄Q such that Her⁡(ϕ)Heritalic-ϕ\\operatorname{Her}(\\phi) is coNPcoNP\\operatorname{coNP}-complete. The prefix classes that appear in our result turn out to be the duals of\nthe prefix classes that are relevant for the famous decision problem (the classical ‘Enscheidungsproblem’); we refer to the monographs  .\nThe satisfiability problem is decidable for first-order formulas whose quantifier prefix is in ∃∗∀∗superscriptsuperscriptfor-all\\exists^{*}\\forall^{*} (due to Bernays and Schönfinkel ; they prove that if a model exists, then we may even find a finite model), in ∃∗∀∃∗superscriptfor-allsuperscript\\exists^{*}\\forall\\exists^{*} (Ackermann ; again, satisfiability in the finite and the infinite is equivalent), and undecidable otherwise .\nWe are not aware of a deeper reason of this curious coincidence.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: time equals non-deterministic exponential time).
