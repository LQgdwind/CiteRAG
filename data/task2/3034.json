      "content": "Paper Title: LUMINOUS: Indoor Scene Generation for Embodied AI Challenges\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEmbodied artificial intelligence (EAI) has attracted significant attention, both in advanced deep learning models and algorithms     and\nthe rapid development of simulated platforms [ref]5    .\nMany open challenges 0 1 2 3 have been proposed to facilitate EAI research.\nA critical bottleneck in existing simulated platforms 0 2  [ref]5 4 is the limited number of indoor scenes that support vision-and-language navigation, object interaction, and complex household tasks. This limitation makes\nit difficult to verify whether state-of-the-art methods generalize well to unseen scenarios or whether they are specialized to a small number of room structures.\nLow cost, automatic creation of large numbers of high-quality simulated environments is essential to resolve this question. Here, we leverage advances in\nindoor scene synthesis to achieve the large-scale automatic creation of simulated environments.\nIndoor scene synthesis has been a long-standing challenge\nfor both computer graphics and machine learning communities resulting in considerable recent progress 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3.\nTo effectively utilize\nindoor scene synthesis for EAI, three key challenges remain. First, for synthesized scenes to be useful in EAI, they must directly support household tasks requiring object pick and place, state changes, and articulation. Second, the generated scenes with randomized layouts must be natural—layouts that “make sense” according to human judgement—and functional—layouts that match human use given the room type, such as Bedroom or Living Room.\nFinally, any scene generation method must provide efficient access to massive, multimodal embodied agent trajectory data, including low-level action sequences for task completion, egocentric image frames during action execution, and language instructions. We present Luminous, a scalable, indoor scene generation framework to facilitate EAI\ntasks such as vision-and-language navigation and language-guided task\ncompletion (Figure 1). We introduce the Challenge Definition Format (CDF),\nwhich provides a user-friendly task specification of the required objects, their relative spatial\nrelationships, and high-level descriptions of downstream EAI\ntasks to facilitate. We introduce Constrained Stochastic Scene Generation (CSSG)\nto generate an arbitrary number of indoor scenes from the CDF specification. Luminous produces scenes that are well-aligned with human common sense and\nsatisfy the CDF conditions, thereby ensuring that the generated scenes are readily applicable to EAI tasks. In addition, we develop a task solver to plan sequences of low-level actions for\ncorresponding task completion. We also implement a task instruction generation module to annotate trajectories with language instructions.\nLuminous generates large-scale multimodal trajectories for the training and evaluation of embodied agents. Luminous also contributes to indoor scene\nsynthesis.\nGenerally, scene generation lacks ground truth for\nquantitative evaluation.\nMetrics like bounding box and angle prediction 0 and synthetic\nclassification 9 are not always correlated\nwith the quality of a generated scene. By connecting indoor scene synthesis to EAI, we propose measuring planner-based task success rate as an automatic evaluation metric of the synthesized scene quality.\nBesides CSSG, Luminous is compatible with state-of-the-art learning-based indoor scene synthesis algorithms 4 0.\nWe demonstrate that CSSG with Luminous qualitatively outperforms other learning-based synthesis methods (Section 4.1). The main contributions of our work are threefold.\nFirst, we introduce a framework (Luminous) which serves as a standard and unified benchmark for indoor scene synthesis algorithms.\nSecond, Luminous generates a large number of randomized scenes that achieve competitive quality compared to human-designed scenes in AI2Thor . Third, the rendered scenes, along with the multimodal\ntrajectories, directly support typical EAI task completion to facilitate generalization research.\nExtensive evaluation on ALFRED 0, a language-guided task completion challenge,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of Luminous.\nFurther, our evaluation with Luminous scenes suggests that existing, state of the art models for ALFRED may overfit to the hand-created scenes in AI2Thor.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Embodied artificial intelligence (EAI) has attracted significant attention, both in advanced deep learning models and algorithms     and\nthe rapid development of simulated platforms [ref]5    .\nMany open challenges 0 1 2 3 have been proposed to facilitate EAI research.\nA critical bottleneck in existing simulated platforms 0 2  [ref]5 4 is the limited number of indoor scenes that\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
