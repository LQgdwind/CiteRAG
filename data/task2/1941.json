      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Decoupling Attention Markov Networks for Semi-supervised Graph Node Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere is past literature recognizing the negative disturbance in message passing. Li et al.[ref]15 proved that the graph convolution operator is actually a special form of Laplacian smoothing. To overcome the negative disturbance, they proposed to combine co-training and self-learning methods to train GCN.\nMoreover, Hou et al.[ref]14 discovered that the neighborhood will provide both positive information and negative disturbance for a given task during propagation.\nThey proposed smoothness metrics to selectively aggregate neighborhood information to amplify useful information and reduce negative disturbance over the original graph.\nBesides, Xie et al.[ref]17 found that neighborhood aggregation may be harmful or unnecessary in some cases. If a node’s neighbors have high entropy, the further aggregation will jeopardize model performance, and any more aggregation is unnecessary if a node is nearly identical to its neighbors.\nHowever, these methods do not study that the graph structure and weights may have different influences on message passing. Unlike them, we decouple the graph structure and influence of weights on message passing and utilize different learning mechanisms to overcome the negative disturbance and enhance the information gain. To improve the effectiveness of message passing, there are attempts combining learnable attention functions to assign an importance weight to every neighboring node according to the node feature similarity.\nGraph Attention Networks (GATs)  apply multi-head self-attention mechanisms to learn the aggregation weight distribution on edges among nodes and update node features, and achieve remarkable performance.\nBecause of such a successful application of attention mechanisms on GNNs, an in-depth critical study of it becomes a new trend.\nLi et al. showed that attentions learned by GATs are highly dataset-dependent and the distributions across heads and layers are nearly uniform for all citation networks.\nIt is difficult to truly capture the effective weights that are helpful to the tasks.\nWang et al. indicated that GATs suffer from over-fitting due to the increasing number of parameters and the lack of direct supervision on attention weights. They proposed margin-based constraints to reduce information propagation between nodes belonging to different classes.\nHowever, in most current attention-based approaches, the learned aggregation weights are based on node features, and they fail to capture the useful information provided by label dependency. Hence we instead take both feature and label information to learn better attention patterns and propose an extra mutual information constraint to enhance the supervision. There are other methods that consider label dependency on graphs. Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) assumes that two nodes linked by an edge are more likely to have the same label, and encourages the prediction distribution to be equal to a weighted sum of its neighbor distributions  .\nBesides, Wang et al. \n analyzed the theoretical relationship between LPA and GCN in terms of feature/label smoothness and influence. They proposed a GCN-LPA model by applying the LPA as regularization on training set labels to learn aggregation weights.\nHuang et al.  used a post-process mechanism called C&S to learn the residual between the ground truth labels and the basic model’s prediction. Specifically, they proposed the Autoscale and FDiff-scale strategies to enhance the label propagation to correct and smooth the prediction of basic models.\nHowever, since these methods only consider the label dependency under the original graph structure, they are limited by the number of few known labels under the setting of semi-supervised learning.\nThere are other works explicitly using GNNs to propagate labels.\nRossi et al.  present an inductive–transductive learning scheme based on GNNs and enrich the node features with the target label in the diffusion process.\n\nGraph Markov Neural Networks (GMNN)  used another GCN to update each node label with the labels of its neighbors non-linearly.\nThe key idea of GMNN is to regard the unlabeled nodes as latent variables and utilize the EM framework to infer better pseudo-labels iteratively.\nHowever, they neglect the fact that a better graph structure is helpful for the propagation process. To best of our knowledge, the proposed GDAMNs are the first work to simultaneously consider the label influence for structures and the feature influence for weights.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: There is past literature recognizing the negative disturbance in message passing.
