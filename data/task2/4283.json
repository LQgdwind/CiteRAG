Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5.

      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Contrastive Distillation for Image-Text Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we compare the two datasets of Flickr30K and MSCOCO to verify the effectiveness of our framework. Table I shows the experimental results of Flickr30K and MSCOCO 1K test sets.\nFor a comprehensive comparison, we list not only the retrieval results (“R@K”) of the existing image-text retrieval methods, including SCAN [ref]16, CAMP [ref]28, VSRN , SAEM , ViLBERT , and UNITER , but also their corresponding model sizes (“Param”) and inference latency (“Time”).\nAs shown in Table I, the inference speed of our compressed model (“Ours”) is significantly faster than that of the existing models, where the speedup is at least 129×\\times (7ms vs. 900ms).\nAlso, our approach has the smallest model size among them, achieving up to 4.1×\\times parameter compression (comparing to ViLBERT-Base).\nRegarding retrieval performance, our compressed model achieves competitive, if not better, performance compared to the existing state-of-the-art in image-text retrieval.\nSpecifically, compared with similar-sized method SCAN [ref]16, we achieve 8.2% and 5.1% improvements in R@1 text and image retrieval, respectively, in the Flickr30k dataset. In the MS-COCO 1K dataset, our method also obtains 3.8% and 0.9% improvement in text and image retrieval, respectively.\nMeanwhile, our compressed model gains consistent improvement compared to those larger non-pretrained modal interaction models, i.e. CAMP [ref]28, VSRN , and SAEM .\nAnd encouragingly, compared to the state-of-the-art pretrained models, i.e. ViLBERT  and UNITER , our compressed model achieves better performance with significantly fewer parameters, such as TR@1, TR@10, and IR@10 on MS-COCO.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: experimental results of Flickr30K and MSCOCO 1K test sets.\nFor a comprehensive comparison, we list not only the retrieval results (“R@K”) of the existing image-text retrieval methods, including SCAN [ref]16, CAMP [ref]28, VSRN , SAEM , ViLBERT , and UNITER , but also their corresponding model sizes (“Param”) and inference latency (“Time”).\nAs shown in Table I, the inference speed of our\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
