      "content": "Paper Title: Composing Codensity Bisimulations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBisimilarity and its many variants are fundamental notions of behavioral equivalence on state-based systems. A classical question is whether a given notion of equivalence is compositional w.r.t.¬†algebraic operations on these systems, such as parallel composition of concurrent systems, product constructions on automata, or other language constructs. The problem can become particularly challenging when moving from bisimilarity to quantitative notions such as behavioral metrics on probabilistic systems, where it is already non-trivial to even define what the right notion of compositionality is (see, e.g.¬† ). To formulate and address the problem of compositionality of algebraic operations on state-based systems at a high level of generality, a natural formalism is that of coalgebra¬†, which is parametric in the type of system, as modeled by a ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù endofunctor FùêπF. A key idea, originating in the seminal work of Turi and Plotkin¬†, is that composition operations and in fact whole languages specifying state-based systems arise as distributive laws between FùêπF and a functor (or monad) TùëáT which models the syntax of a bigger programming language. In fact, Turi and Plotkin‚Äôs abstract GSOS laws are forms of such distributive laws which guarantee compositionality of strong bisimilarity, generalizing the analogous result for specifications in the GSOS format for labeled transition systems¬†[ref]4. Distributive laws here precisely capture algebra-coalgebra interaction needed for compositionality. The results of Turi and Plotkin specifically apply to strong bisimilarity, and not directly to other notions such as similarity or behavioral metrics. To prove compositionality in these cases, the key observation is that the task is to define the composition operation at hand not only on state-based systems but also on relations (or, e.g., pseudometrics). This idea has been formalized in the theory of coalgebras by requiring a lifting of the distributive law that models the composition operator to a category of relations. The lifting of the behavior functor FùêπF then specifies the notion of bisimilarity at hand, and the lifting of the syntax functor TùëáT the way that relations on components can be combined into bisimulations on the composite system. It has been shown in¬† at a high level of generality that the existence of such liftings, referred to in this paper as liftability, ensures compositionality in this way. The generality there is offered by the use of liftings of the behavior functor in fibrations which goes back to¬†, and which allows us to study not only relations but also, for instance, coinductively defined metrics or unary predicates (e.g.,¬†   ).\nBut the main challenge here is to prove liftability; this is what we address in the current paper\n(Question¬†3.11.2). We focus on the codensity lifting of behavior functors¬†,\nwhich allows to model a wide variety of coinductive relations and predicates including (bi)similarity but also, for instance,\nbehavioral metrics; these are commonly referred to as codensity bisimilarity. In fact, the codensity lifting directly generalizes the celebrated Kantorovich distance between probability\ndistributions used to define, for instance, metrics between probabilistic systems¬†. The codensity lifting is parametric\nin a collection of modal operators, which makes it on the one hand very flexible and on the other hand much more structured than arbitrary liftings.\nMoreover, the codensity lifting allows to characterize codensity games¬†, a generalization of classical bisimilarity games¬† \nfrom transition systems to coalgebras, and from strong bisimilarity to a wide variety of coinductively defined relations, metrics and even topologies. In this paper we study compositionality of codensity bisimulations with respect to composition operators on the underlying state-based systems,\nmodeled as coalgebras. We model these composition operators as distributive laws between an nùëõn-ary product functor and the behavior functor FùêπF, referred to as one-step composition operators.\n\nWe mainly tackle two problems (Question¬†3.11) in this paper:\n1) How do we lift the nùëõn-ary product functor\nin order to capture non-trivial combination of relations,\npseudometrics etc?\n2) When is a one-step composition operator liftable? A key idea for the first problem is to use codensity liftings not only to lift the behavior functor FùêπF and get our desired notion of equivalence, but to use another codensity lifting of the product functor, to explain syntactically how relations (or pseudometrics, etc) should be combined from components to the composite system. This combination can be a simple product between relations, but in many cases, such as for behavioral metrics, it needs to be more sophisticated; the flexibility offered by the codensity lifting helps to define the appropriate constructions on relations. The second problem about liftability\nthen becomes that of proving the existence of a distributive law between codensity liftings. To this end, we exhibit a sufficient condition that ensure the existence of this distributive laws, defined in terms of two properties: 1) commutation between the underlying modalities that define codensity liftings, and 2) an approximation property, which resembles the one used to prove expressiveness of modal logics in¬†[ref]24. Underlying our approach is a combination of a new generalization of the codensity lifting beyond endofunctors, to allow to lift product functors, and the adjunction-based decomposition of codensity liftings proposed in¬†. The adjunction-based approach precisely allows us to arrive at our sufficient condition. We instantiate our approach to pseudometrics on deterministic automata. We also revisit the compositionality of parallel composition w.r.t.¬†behavioral metrics studied in¬†. In this case it is not clear whether our sufficient condition holds; but the framework nevertheless helps to prove liftability and thereby compositionality. We further study a composition of codensity games. A key\nobservation is that our composite codensity games consist\nof positions that are tuples of positions of codensity games for\ncomponent systems. This design of the composite game directly leads to the\ncompositionality of game invariants, which characterize winning\npositions. Assuming our sufficient condition of the liftability\nof distributive laws, we present an alternative proof of the\npreservation of bisimilarities along compositions (the inequality\nin Corollary¬†3.10). In summary, the contributions of this paper are a generalization of the codensity lifting beyond endofunctors\n(Section¬†4), which can be used in a special case to\nlift products in various ways (Section¬†5); a sufficient condition for proving the existence of a\ndistributive law between codensity liftings\n(Section¬†6), with several detailed examples\n(Section¬†7); a composition of codensity games, which also composes game\ninvariants, and an alternative proof of the preservation of\ncodensity bisimilarities under our sufficient condition\n(Section¬†8); After the preliminaries (Section¬†2), we start\nthe paper with a more detailed overview of our approach\n(Section¬†3). There is a wide range of results in the\nprocess algebra on compositionality and rule formats to prove it,\nwhich are usually focused on specific models (see,\ne.g.,¬† for an overview). A full\naccount is beyond the scope of this paper, which focuses instead on\ngenerality in the type of models and the type of coinductive\npredicates. Concerning general frameworks for compositionality in the\ntheory of coalgebras, we have already mentioned Turi and Plotkin‚Äôs\nabstract GSOS format; the main innovation in the current paper is that\nwe go beyond bisimilarity by employing the codensity lifting. In¬†, it is shown that liftings of\ndistributive laws to fibrations yield so-called compatibility,\na property that ensures soundness of up-to techniques, and which\nimplies compositionality. On the one hand, if one uses the so-called\ncanonical relation lifting then all distributive laws lift, but this\nonly concerns strong bisimilarity; on the other hand,\nin¬† examples beyond bisimilarity\nare studied but liftability there is proven on an ad-hoc basis. In the\ncurrent paper we identify the codensity lifting as a sweet spot\nbetween the (restricted) canonical relation lifting and abstract,\nunrestricted lifting of functors, and focus instead on conditions that\nallow to prove liftability. Many bisimilarity notions are known to be characterized by winning\npositions of certain safety games, including bisimilarity on Kripke\nframes¬†, probabilistic\nbisimulation¬†1 ,\nand bisimulation metric¬†. There are\nseveral coalgebraic\nframeworks¬† \nthat captures such a relationship between games and bisimilarities.\nIn this paper, we focus on codensity\ngames¬† that are naturally\nobtained by codensity liftings and coalgebras. Codensity lifting is first introduced to lift monads across fibrations\n. Its instances include the\nKantorivich metric on Giry monad. Later, in\n, it is extended to lift\nendofunctors across fibrations, and is shown to be a generalization of\nBaldan et al.‚Äôs Kantorovich lifting\n.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: are forms of such distributive laws which guarantee compositionality of strong bisimilarity, generalizing the analogous result for specifications in the GSOS format for labeled transition systems¬†[ref]4.
