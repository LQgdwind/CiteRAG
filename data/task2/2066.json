Q1: Is the language in AVQA biased?\nStarting from VQA-CP [ref]2, concerns have been raised about the propensity of models to pick up on spurious artifacts that are present just in the co-occurrence of question-answer pairs, without actually paying attention to the image content. We compare full models trained with both images and questions to models trained only on questions by zeroing out image features in Table 4(a). The results show that language-only models perform poorly on AVQA, and similarly on VQA v2. Language-only model performance decreases over rounds for AVQA. However, UNITER-B is not much better than language-only on AVQA. Obviously, without manual intervention, some bias remains in how annotators phrase questions. For example, there might be more counting questions with answers other than 2, which is the majority answer in VQA v2. Therefore, models trained on AVQA only performs slightly higher for both UNITER-B and Language-only model. However, we also observe the significant drop in VQA v2 performance is out of proportion to the slight performance improvement on AVQA. We further investigate if the low performance is due to the difference in answer distribution between training and testing split. Due to the large number of answer candidates (more than 3000 for VQA v2), it is impossible to evenly balance the possibility of each answer. Therefore, we test out this hypothesis by adopting a simple yet effective baseline method on VQA-CP : adding a regularization term by replacing the image with a randomly sampled one. The intuition is that the answer to a question corresponding to a given image is very unlikely to be correct for a randomly sampled image. As reported in Table 4(b), although effective on VQA-CP, adding such regularization hurts the performance on AVQA for both BUTD and UNITER-B. In addition, when applied to a stronger model on VQA-CP, i.e., UNITER-B, the regularization term is less effective. Q2: Is AVQA transferrable to different visual features?\nThe AVQA dataset is collected with the assistance of models trained on Faster R-CNN  region features .\nTo investigate whether these collected adversarial examples are transferrable to different image features, we conduct experiments using another type of feature, i.e., grid features [ref]18 from CNNs, which have shown to be effective for VQA tasks [ref]18  3 [ref]25.\nSpecifically, we consider ClipBERT [ref]25,\nan end-to-end pre-trained model that directly takes in raw images and questions, and the images are represented by grid features as in [ref]18.\nMeanwhile, ClipBERT’s end-to-end training strategy may also help to defend potential attacks to fixed feature representations widely used in previous work   .\nTable 5 compares ClipBERT against UNITER-B. The poor performance of ClipBERT on AVQA suggests that adversarial examples in AVQA are transferrable to different image representations. However, ClipBERT performs comparably to UNITER-B on AVQA, although it significantly under-performs UNITER-B on VQA v2, which suggests that VQA v2 may not be reliable for evaluating model robustness. Q3: How effective is adversarial training on AVQA? We examine the effectiveness of adversarial training by adopting PGD-based adversarial training method VILLA in  . VILLA-B is both adversarially pre-trained on large-scale image-text data and adversarially finetuned on the respective dataset. We compare its performance against UNITER-B on both AVQA and VQA v2 in Table 5. Adversarial training brings slight performance improvement. However, the performance gap between AVQA and VQA v2 is still very significant. Note that VILLA-B crafts adversarial examples during training by adding adversarial perturbations to the embedding space. These adversarial perturbations can hardly change the intrinsic statistics of training data, such as the distribution of question types and relevant objects in the image. Our analysis of question types and visual recognition concepts in Sec. 4.4 will show that AVQA is hard because it requires the model to have the ability to reason, count and recognize different visual concepts.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: We dive deeper into the key factors behind the low performance of state-of-the-art models on AVQA, and try to answer the following questions.
