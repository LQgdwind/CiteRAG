      "content": "Paper Title: Uncertainty Estimation for Language Reward Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe objective for many natural language tasks is subtle, and difficult or impossible to procedurally specify.\nFor example, what makes a summary of an article “good”?\nIt should be truthful, but must also omit some information to stay succinct.\nThis requires a value judgement: what part of the article is most important to the reader?\nIt is even more challenging to specify the objective for open-ended tasks such as conversational agents interacting with users. A common approach is to use supervised learning to mimic some reference text written by a human   [ref]22.\nHowever, writing reference examples is slow and expensive.\nIt is possible to reuse existing data sources, but they are often low quality or an imperfect match for the task. An alternative approach is to learn a reward model from human feedback that evaluates the quality of textual output.\nOne can then use reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune a language model to generate output that scores highly under this reward model.\nThis method has been applied to perform stylistic continuation  and summarize documents . There are usually multiple settings of the model parameters that make similar predictions on the (finite) training dataset, but may disagree on novel inputs.\nPrior work has ignored this and learned a single point-estimate for the parameters.\nBut capturing this model uncertainty could improve sample efficiency via active learning, increase robustness of the RL training procedure, and aid in quality control.\nIn this paper, we explore some initial approaches to estimate model uncertainty. A key application of uncertainty estimation is active learning: choosing what textual output to elicit human preference comparisons or other feedback on.\nThis is important as it is expensive to collect the large quantities of high-quality labeled data needed by current approaches.\nFor example,  collected 60,000 comparisons between summaries of articles, but found the resulting model simply learned to copy the initial sentences. They attribute this to labellers under time pressure preferring copies as a fast heuristic for accuracy.\nImproved sample efficiency will enable us to collect smaller but higher quality datasets, decreasing the cost of data collection and improving reliability. Another commonly encountered problem is that RL fine-tuning learns to exploit the learned reward model.\nThis results in a language model that generates gibberish (but high-reward) outputs [53, Table 10].\nPrior work has avoided this by adding a KL penalty relative to the pre-trained language model as an auxiliary reward.\nHowever, this regularization may limit task performance, especially for tasks that are very different from that seen during pre-training.\nEstimating reward model uncertainty allow us to instead perform risk-averse  [ref]42 or risk-constrained [ref]8 reinforcement learning. In this paper, we investigate whether an ensemble of fine-tuned language models can provide accurate estimates of uncertainty.\nSpecifically, we randomly reinitialize the final layer of each ensemble member, and then fine-tune the entire network based on human preference comparisons.\nAlthough ensembles are not always the best performing method, they have worked reasonably well in a wide range of applications     0 .\nDespite this prior track record, we find that ensembles perform poorly in our settings.\nIn particular, we find no benefit from active learning using ensembles compared to randomly sampling data.\nMoreover, on a synthetic dataset the ensemble is only slightly more accurate on points with higher confidence (lower variance between ensemble members). We speculate this negative result is due to limited diversity between ensemble members when fine-tuning from a single pre-trained model.\nBy contrast, most prior work on uncertainty estimation has focused on training a model from scratch, where this issue does not arise.\nBut in our setting, it is both more computationally and sample efficient to fine-tune a pre-trained language model, leveraging the natural language representations it has already learned 2  3.\nUnfortunately, pre-trained language models’ notion of uncertainty is for next-token prediction.\nMoreover, language models’ uncertainty is unreliable out-of-domain  , and is poorly calibrated even in-domain for some tasks such as Q&A . Both active learning and fine-tuning a pre-trained model share the goal of improving sample efficiency.\nHowever, we conjecture there is a crucial tradeoff between them: we must stay close to the pre-trained model to benefit from fine-tuning, but this lack of diversity will hurt uncertainty estimation.\nThis casts doubt on the dominant paradigm of developing a single large pre-trained model.\nWe expect that, for the purpose of uncertainty estimation, it may be better to learn multiple distinct smaller pre-trained models, or otherwise introduce uncertainty into the pre-trained model (e.g. via dropout ).\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: to specify the objective for open-ended tasks such as conversational agents interacting with users.
