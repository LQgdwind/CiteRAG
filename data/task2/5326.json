      "content": "Paper Title: Detecting Severity of Diabetic Retinopathy from Fundus Images using Ensembled Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDiabetes Mellitus, also known as diabetes, is a disorder where the patient experiences increased blood sugar levels over a long period. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a microvascular complication of diabetes where the retina's blood vessels get damaged, which can lead to poor vision and even blindness if untreated [ref]1 .\nStudies estimated that by twenty years after diabetes onset, about 99% (or 60%) of patients having type-I (or type-II) diabetes might have DR [ref]1.\nWith a worldwide presence of DR patients of about 126.6 million in 2010, the current estimate is roughly around 191 million by 2030  .\nHowever, about 56% of new DR cases can be reduced by timely treatment and monitoring of the severity [ref]5.\nThe ophthalmologist analyzes fundus images for lesion-based symptoms like microaneurysms, hard/ soft exudates, and hemorrhages to understand the severity stages of DR [ref]1 .\nThe positive DR is divided into the following stages [ref]5:\n(111) mild: the earliest stage that can contain microaneurysms,\n(222) moderate: here, the blood vessels lose the ability to blood transportation,\n(333) severe: here, blockages in blood vessels can occur and gives a signal to grow new blood vessels,\n(444) proliferative: the advanced stage where new blood vessels start growing.\nFig. 1 shows some fundus images representing the DR severity stages.\nManual examining fundus images for DR severity stage grading may bring inconsistencies due to a high number of patients, less number of well-trained clinicians, long diagnosing time, unclear lesions, etc. Moreover, there may be disagreement among ophthalmologists in choosing the correct severity grade .\nTherefore, computer-aided techniques have come into the scenario for better diagnosis and broadening the prospects of early-stage detection . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnegative\nmild\nmoderate\nsevere\nproliferative\n\n Automated DR severity stage detection from fundus photographs has been performed for the last two and half decades. Earlier, some image processing tools were used  , but the machine learning-based DR became popular in the early 2000s.\nThe machine learning-based techniques mostly relied on hand-engineered features that were carefully extracted from the fundus images and then fed to a classifier, e.g.,\nRandom Forest (RF) ,\nKNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) ,\nSVM (Support Vector Machine) , and\nANN (Artificial Neural Network) .\nAlthough SVM and ANN-based models were admired in the DR community, the hand-engineered feature-based machine learning models require efficient prior feature extraction, which may introduce errors for complex fundus images  [ref]1.\nOn the other hand, deep learning-based models extract features automatically through convolution operations  .\nBesides, from 2012, deep learning architectures rose to prominence in the computer vision community, which also influenced the DR severity analysis from fundus images [ref]1.\nThe past deep learning-based techniques mostly employed CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)  [ref]1.\nHowever, the ability to give attention to certain regions/features and fade the remaining portions hardly exists in classical CNNs.\nFor this reason, some contemporary methods incorporated attention mechanism  .\nAlthough multiple research works are present in the literature  [ref]1 and efforts were made to detect the existence of DR in the initial stages of its development, still there is a room for improving the performance by incorporating higher degrees of automated feature extraction using better deep learning models. In this paper, we employ the transformer model for leveraging its MSA (Multi-head Self-Attention)  to focus on the DR revealing region of the fundus image for understanding the severity.\nMoreover, the transformer model has shown high performance in recent days 0 .\nInitially, we adopted ViT (Visual Transformer)  for detecting DR severity due to its outperformance on image classification tasks.\nViT divides the input image into a sequence of patches and applies global attention .\nMoreover, since standard ViT requires hefty amounts of data, we also adopted some other image transformer models, such as\nCaiT (Class-attention in image Transformers) 1,\nDeiT (Data-efficient image Transformer) 2, and\nBEiT (Bidirectional Encoder representation for image Transformer) 3.\nCaiT is a modified version of ViT and employs specific class-attention 1.\nDeiT uses knowledge distillation, which transfers the knowledge from one network to another and builds a teacher-student hierarchical network 2.\nBEiT is inspired by BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) 4 to implement masking of image patches and to model the same for pre-training the ViT 3.\nFor experiments, we used the publicly available APTOS-2019 blindness detection dataset , where the individual image transformers did not perform well.\nTherefore, we ensembled the image transformers to seek better predictive performance. The ensembled image transformer obtained quite encouraging results for DR severity stage detection.\nThis is one of the earliest attempts to adopt and ensemble image transformers for DR severity stage detection, which is the main contribution of this paper. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.\n§§\\mathsection 2 discusses the relevant literature about DR and §§\\mathsection 3 presents the proposed methodology.\nThen §§\\mathsection 4 analyzes and discusses the experimental results.\nFinally, §§\\mathsection 5 concludes this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: over a long period.
