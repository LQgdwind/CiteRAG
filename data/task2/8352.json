      "content": "Paper Title: A Hierarchical Poisson Generator for Universal Graphs under Limited Resources 1 Yanlong Wen is the corresponding author.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph generation task, widely used for scenarios like social analysis  [ref]2 [ref]3, molecule generation   , and structure modeling   , is one of the hottest researches in recent years.\nMaintaining the distribution similarity between the generated and ground truth graphs is the core and one of the challenges of this task.\nDeep Generative Models (DGM) are the mainstream solutions nowadays 0  9 0 1.\nDGM learns the latent distribution features hiding in the training data, generating graphs closer to the requirements. However, training data may not be available due to security concerns or high data acquisition costs 3, striking learning models severely, especially DGM.\nFigure 1 illustrates this limitation.\nOnly plain graph property data, such as the number of nodes and edges, are available when we limit the training data.\nThe learnable distribution space of DGM switches from the training set to the search space of node permutations, resulting in the generation of mess graphs out of distribution (in red).\nSome studies have proposed solutions to this problem, such as graph transfer learning 1 2 3, which realizes graph generation in restricted scenarios by learning invariant features in other training data that can be easily obtained.\nNevertheless, the quality of such solutions depends heavily on the quality of the training data before transfer.\nThere is heterogeneity in the data distribution of different scenarios 4.\nThe model performance is unsatisfactory if there are considerable differences in the invariant features.\nFor example, social networks have many clusters, while molecules rely on functional groups with unique semantics.\nModels can not learn sufficient invariant features transferring one scene above to another.\nImproving the quality of training data further increases the acquisition cost, returning to the previous limitations. This dilemma urges us to rethink non-learned generation methods based on graph invariant features.\nThroughout the history of graph generation tasks, traditional methods have been designed on universal observations maintained in real-world scenarios, such as randomness 4, small world 6, scale-free 5 0 , etc.\nThese observations are equal to invariant features independent of the training data, satisfying the properties of graphs under most scenarios.\nAmong them, we pay attention to the scale-free property of graphs.\nScale-free, also known as power-law, heavy-tailed, etc., refers to a phenomenon in which a small number of nodes in networks have a large number of connections, while most nodes have only a few.\nMany systems in the real world have this property [ref]34 5, reflected in the distribution of various aspects, such as degree, label, resources, etc.\nIt will serve as a significant invariant feature observation that effectively organizes the basic graph information to direct the generation. But, instead of DGM learning the real-world distribution accurately, a selected invariant feature often orients to a class of graph sets with its hand-crafted characteristics.\nFor example, Chung-Lu (CL) 0 generates strictly scale-free networks and does not perform well in generating other graphs that do not follow this degree distribution.\nR-MAT , a scale-free graph generator based on an iterative strategy, creates graphs primarily depending on the initial graph.\nSome more methods   7 serve the corresponding set of graphs depending on the user-defined feature constraints, while others 7 5 6 define particular scenarios, leaving the decision to randomness.\nWhen learning approaches are limited as a resource, the unapproachable power of predefined features kills the generalization ability of non-learned methods [ref]34.\nTherefore, whether enhancing the generality of invariant features or weakening selected features by noises, restrictions, etc., can improve the support of non-learned methods for rich graph categories. We further reinforce the limited resources problem setting with real-world scenarios.\nOn the one hand, the training data may be constrained.\nFor example, users’ relationships have semantics  (e.g., motifs 8).\nIn this case, it is not enough to provide basic data anonymization.\nThe implicit distribution patterns are leaked if the training data is available, causing severe security problems.\nOn the other hand, learning approaches may be limited.\nFor example, there is insufficient data and resources with quantity and quality assurance in some marginal application scenarios to support model learning.\nIn addition, due to the black-box nature of the learning model, the learned invariant features do not have good interpretability. Admittedly, generating graphs relying entirely on basic information such as the number of nodes and edges is tantamount to randomly selecting from the search space.\nDGM mainly obtains real-world distribution through feature matrix 9   , node sequence  , etc., while some extend the sampling space by mixup through the semantic information of specific scenes   .\nThese models are training data available, and the ground truth distribution is known.\nHow to use as little additional information as possible without breaking the limited resources is also a vital consideration in designing a generation strategy for universal graphs.\nFor example, Erdős-Rényi (ER) 4, the most typical random graph model, only employs the number of nodes and a uniform probability of edge generation.\nBarabási-Albert (BA) 5 gradually generates the edges in the graph based on the preferential attachment, including three parameters: the initial graph, the number of nodes, and the number of coming edges for new nodes. Overall, to devise graph generation methods under limited resources scenarios, we have the following challenges:\n(1) Capture powerful invariant features.\nThe ground truth distribution cannot be learned directly due to the difficulty of obtaining training data.\nWe need a generation strategy based on a powerful invariant feature covering the majority of scenes.\n(2) Weaken the influence of manual design.\nTraditional methods are engineered for a family of graphs with selected features, leading to poor scalability [ref]34.\nWe need to weaken the influence of particular features to support the generation of diverse structures.\n(3) Generate graphs that fit the ground truth distribution.\nThe effect of invariant feature selection will eventually be reflected in the distance evaluation between the generated and real-world graphs.\nWe need to generate graphs closer to the ground truth. To solve the above problems, we propose a hierarchical Poisson graph generation algorithm, which generates universal graphs under the observation of the scale-free property.\nSpecifically, we design a two-stage generation strategy.\nIn the first stage, we sample a set of anchor nodes based on the Poisson distribution to further guide the formation of substructures, splitting the node set into multiple ones.\nIt corresponds to challenge 1, where we strictly follow scale-free invariant features for graph generation.\nIn the second stage, we employ preferential attachment to weight the Poisson distribution to alleviate the feature limitations mentioned in challenge 2.\nWe progressively generate the remaining edges by sampling node pairs through a degree mixing distribution.\nFinally, facing challenge 3, we leverage two basic graph information as thresholds to adjust the algorithm tolerance for generating exotic structures and further enrich the search space well-fitted to ground truth distribution.\nWe provide theoretical underpinning that guarantees that the generative process is interpretable. In summary, our contributions are as follows: We explore the possibility of generating graphs in the setting of limited resources and rethink the generation strategy only through basic graph properties. We design a hierarchical Poisson generator based on the scale-free property for universal graphs under limited resources, which creates graphs closer to the real-world distribution. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method and design a fast version in a pairwise perspective, achieving a balance between performance and efficiency. Experiments on 12 datasets in three categories give a thorough perspective to evaluate our work. Results show that our method can cover most scenarios when the ground truth distribution is unknown.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Graph generation task, widely used for scenarios like social analysis  [ref]2 [ref]3, molecule generation   , and structure modeling   , is one of the hottest researches in recent years.\nMaintaining the distribution similarity between the generated and ground truth\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
