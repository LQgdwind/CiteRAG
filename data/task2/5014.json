      "content": "Paper Title: Selective compression learning of latent representations for variable-rate image compression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral studies [ref]1     [ref]21  [ref]23   have been conducted for enabling a single NN-based image compression model to support variable-rate compression. The first learning-based variable-rate image compression model [ref]1 progressively performs image compression in a low-to-high quality manner by accumulating additional binary representations as the number of compression iterations increases. For the entropy model-based approaches, Choi et al.  proposed a conditional convolution that adaptively operates according to different target quality levels. Scale and shift factors are derived from a one-hot vector representing a quality level, and are then applied to each output of convolutional layers. Cai et al.  stacks representations to form a multiscale structure, and then determine point-wise scales, representing the importance levels of representations to be compressed. This method also uses additional modules named a multi-scale decomposition transform layer (MSD) and an inverse multi-scale decomposition transform layer (IMSD), both of which consist of multiple convolutional layers. Cui et al.  utilizes two types of vectors for the adaptive quantization and inverse quantization, and Chen et al. [ref]23 similarly utilizes scaling and shifting vectors. These methods  [ref]23 support variable-rate compression with negligible overhead on top of the existing compression models (  for Cui et al.  and    for Chen et al. [ref]23). However, as described in our experimental results and Rippel’s work , the adaptive quantization alone does not provide sufficient coding efficiency compared to those of the separately trained models. Lu et al. [ref]21 use an adaptive quantization layer (AQL) and an inverse adaptive quantization layer (IAQL) to obtain quantization and inverse quantization factors for each representation. Here, the AQL and IAQL layers are separately trained for each target quality level. Rippel et al.  additionally feed the information of a target quality level into each convolutional layer in the form of a \"level map\" where a one-hot vector of 8 quality levels is assigned for all spatial positions. The input level map can make each convolutional layer adaptively work according to a given target quality level. Lu et al.  firstly presented an NN-based quality scalable coding scheme, named PLONQ, using nested quantization and latent ordering. However, it could not achieve comparable results to its separately trained base compression model . Song et al.  supports the image compression of spatially different qualities using a spatial quality map. Although this method provides a new functionality, the additional module, named spatially-adaptive feature transform, that transforms the spatial quality map into an input for each convolutional layer may increase the overall complexity. From the perspective of partial encoding for representations, Li et al.  and Mentzer et al.  utilize 2D importance maps to represent spatial importance of representations, which allows for spatially different bit allocation in different regions. Their models mainly focus on the fixed-rate compression, although Mentzer et al.  presented a few decoded images at multiple-rates using the shared en/decoder networks. It should be also noted that their 2D importance maps convey the information about how many representation elements at each spatial location should be taken forward along the channel (See Figure 15 in Appendix A.6). On the other hand, our component-wise 3D importance map represents the essence of individual representations, which is adaptively adjusted according to given target qualities in an R-D optimization sense. This brings a good generalization with higher-coding efficiency and more stability in training, as further discussed in Appendix A.6.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Several studies [ref]1     [ref]21  [ref]23   have been conducted for enabling a single NN-based image compression model to support variable-rate compression.
