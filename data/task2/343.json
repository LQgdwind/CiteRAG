      "content": "Paper Title: Self-Paced Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObjective (3) can be motivated by taking an inference perspective on RL [ref]14. In this inference perspective, we introduce an ‘optimality’ event 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O}, whose probability of occurring is defined via a monotonic transformation f:ℝ↦ℝ≥0:𝑓maps-toℝsubscriptℝabsent0f:\\mathbb{R}\\mapsto\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0} of the cumulative reward R​(τ,𝒄)=∑t≥0r𝒄​(𝒔t,𝒂t)𝑅𝜏𝒄subscript𝑡0subscript𝑟𝒄subscript𝒔𝑡subscript𝒂𝑡R(\\tau,\\boldsymbol{c})=\\sum_{t\\geq 0}r_{\\boldsymbol{c}}(\\boldsymbol{s}_{t},\\boldsymbol{a}_{t}), yielding the following latent variable model (LVM) Under appropriate choice of f​(⋅)𝑓⋅f(\\cdot) and minor modification of the transition dynamics to account for the discounting factor γ𝛾\\gamma [ref]15 [ref]14, maximizing LVM (4) w.r.t. 𝝎𝝎\\boldsymbol{\\omega} is equal to the maximization of J​(p𝝂,π𝝎)𝐽subscript𝑝𝝂subscript𝜋𝝎J(p_{\\boldsymbol{\\nu}},\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}) w.r.t. π𝝎subscript𝜋𝝎\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}. This setting is well explored and allowed to identify various RL algorithms as approximate applications of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to LVM (4) to maximize p𝝂,𝝎​(𝒪)subscript𝑝𝝂𝝎𝒪p_{\\boldsymbol{\\nu},\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}(\\mathcal{O}) w.r.t 𝝎𝝎\\boldsymbol{\\omega} [ref]40. Our idea of maximizing Objective (3) in a block-coordinate ascent manner is readily supported by the EM algorithm, since its steps can be executed alternatingly w.r.t. 𝝂𝝂\\boldsymbol{\\nu} and 𝝎𝝎\\boldsymbol{\\omega}. Consequently, we now investigate the case when maximizing p𝝂,𝝎​(𝒪)subscript𝑝𝝂𝝎𝒪p_{\\boldsymbol{\\nu},\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}(\\mathcal{O}) w.r.t. 𝝂𝝂\\boldsymbol{\\nu}, showing that known regularization techniques for approximate inference motivate Objective (3). For brevity, we only state the main results here and refer to Appendix A for detailed proofs and explanations of EM. When maximizing p𝝂,𝝎​(𝒪)subscript𝑝𝝂𝝎𝒪p_{\\boldsymbol{\\nu},\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}(\\mathcal{O}) w.r.t. 𝝂𝝂\\boldsymbol{\\nu} using EM, we introduce a variational distribution q​(𝒄)𝑞𝒄q(\\boldsymbol{c}) and alternate between the so called E-Step, in which q​(𝒄)𝑞𝒄q(\\boldsymbol{c}) is found by minimizing DKL(q(𝒄)∥p𝝂,𝝎(𝒄|𝒪))D_{\\text{KL}}\\left(q(\\boldsymbol{c})\\middle\\|p_{\\boldsymbol{\\nu},\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}(\\boldsymbol{c}|\\mathcal{O})\\right), and the M-Step, in which 𝝂𝝂\\boldsymbol{\\nu} is found by minimizing the KL divergence to the previously obtained variational distribution DKL(q(𝒄)∥p𝝂(𝒄))D_{\\text{KL}}\\left(q(\\boldsymbol{c})\\middle\\|p_{\\boldsymbol{\\nu}}(\\boldsymbol{c})\\right). Typically q​(𝒄)𝑞𝒄q(\\boldsymbol{c}) is not restricted to a parametric form and hence matches p𝝂,𝝎​(𝒄|𝒪)subscript𝑝𝝂𝝎conditional𝒄𝒪p_{\\boldsymbol{\\nu},\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}(\\boldsymbol{c}|\\mathcal{O}) after the E-Step. We now state our main theoretical insight, showing exactly what approximations and modifications to the regular EM algorithm are required to retrieve Objective 3. Choosing f​(⋅)=exp⁡(⋅)𝑓⋅⋅f(\\cdot){=}\\exp\\left(\\cdot\\right), maximizing Objective (3) minus a KL divergence term DKL(p𝛎(𝐜)∥p𝛎~(𝐜))D_{\\text{KL}}\\left(p_{\\boldsymbol{\\nu}}(\\boldsymbol{c})\\middle\\|p_{\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\nu}}}(\\boldsymbol{c})\\right) is equal to executing E- and M-Step while restricting q​(𝐜)𝑞𝐜q(\\boldsymbol{c}) to be of the same parametric form as p𝛎​(𝐜)subscript𝑝𝛎𝐜p_{\\boldsymbol{\\nu}}(\\boldsymbol{c}) and introducing a regularized E-Step DKL(q(𝐜)∥1Zp𝛎~,𝛚(𝐜|𝒪)11+αμ(𝐜)α1+α)D_{\\text{KL}}\\left(q(\\boldsymbol{c})\\middle\\|\\frac{1}{Z}p_{\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\nu}},\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}(\\boldsymbol{c}|\\mathcal{O})^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}\\mu(\\boldsymbol{c})^{\\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}}\\right). Theorem 1 is interesting for many reasons. Firstly, the extra term in Objective (3) can be identified as a regularization term, which penalizes a large deviation of p𝝂​(𝒄)subscript𝑝𝝂𝒄p_{\\boldsymbol{\\nu}}(\\boldsymbol{c}) from p𝝂~​(𝒄)subscript𝑝~𝝂𝒄p_{\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\nu}}}(\\boldsymbol{c}). In the algorithm we propose, we replace this penalty term by a constraint on the KL divergence between successive context distributions, granting explicit control over their dissimilarity. This is beneficial when estimating expectations in Objective (3) by a finite amount of samples. Next, restricting the variational distribution to a parametric form is a known concept in RL. Abdolmaleki et al. [ref]40 have shown that it yields an explanation for the well-known on-policy algorithms TRPO and PPO  . Finally, the regularized E-Step fits q​(𝒄)𝑞𝒄q(\\boldsymbol{c}) to a distribution that is referred to as a tempered posterior. Tempering, or deterministic annealing, is used in variational inference to improve the approximation of posterior distributions by gradually moving from the prior (in our case μ​(𝒄)𝜇𝒄\\mu(\\boldsymbol{c})) to the true posterior (here p𝝂,𝝎​(𝒄|𝒪)subscript𝑝𝝂𝝎conditional𝒄𝒪p_{\\boldsymbol{\\nu},\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}(\\boldsymbol{c}|\\mathcal{O}))   , which in above equation corresponds to gradually decreasing α𝛼\\alpha to zero. We, however, increasingly enforce p𝝂​(𝒄)subscript𝑝𝝂𝒄p_{\\boldsymbol{\\nu}}(\\boldsymbol{c}) to match μ​(𝒄)𝜇𝒄\\mu(\\boldsymbol{c}) by gradually increasing α𝛼\\alpha. To understand this “inverse” behavior, we need to remember that the maximization w.r.t. 𝝂𝝂\\boldsymbol{\\nu} solely aims to generate context distributions p𝝂​(𝒄)subscript𝑝𝝂𝒄p_{\\boldsymbol{\\nu}}(\\boldsymbol{c}) that facilitate the maximization of J​(μ,π𝝎)𝐽𝜇subscript𝜋𝝎J(\\mu,\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}) w.r.t. 𝝎𝝎\\boldsymbol{\\omega}. This means to initially encode contexts in which the event 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O} is most likely, i.e. p𝝎​(𝒪|𝒄)subscript𝑝𝝎conditional𝒪𝒄p_{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}(\\mathcal{O}|\\boldsymbol{c}) is highest, and only gradually match μ​(𝒄)𝜇𝒄\\mu(\\boldsymbol{c}). To conclude this theoretical section, we note that the update rule proposed by Klink et al.  can be recovered from our formulation. Choosing f(⋅)=exp(⋅/η)f(\\cdot){=}\\exp\\left(\\cdot/\\eta\\right), the (unrestricted) variational distribution after the regularized E-Step is given by q​(𝐜)∝p𝛎​(𝐜)​exp⁡(V𝛚​(𝐜)+η​α​(log⁡(μ​(𝐜))−log⁡(p𝛎​(𝐜)))η+η​α)proportional-to𝑞𝐜subscript𝑝𝛎𝐜subscript𝑉𝛚𝐜𝜂𝛼𝜇𝐜subscript𝑝𝛎𝐜𝜂𝜂𝛼q(\\boldsymbol{c}){\\propto}p_{\\boldsymbol{\\nu}}(\\boldsymbol{c})\\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}(\\boldsymbol{c})+\\eta\\alpha\\left(\\log(\\mu(\\boldsymbol{c}))-\\log(p_{\\boldsymbol{\\nu}}(\\boldsymbol{c}))\\right)}{\\eta+\\eta\\alpha}\\right), where V𝛚​(𝐜)subscript𝑉𝛚𝐜V_{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}(\\boldsymbol{c}) is the ‘episodic value function’ as defined in . The variational distribution in Theorem 2 resembles the results in  with the only difference that α𝛼\\alpha is scaled by η𝜂\\eta. Hence, for a given schedule of α𝛼\\alpha, we simply need to scale every value in this schedule by 1/η1𝜂1/\\eta to match the results from Klink et al. .\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: Objective (3) can be motivated by taking an inference perspective on RL [ref]14.
