      "content": "Paper Title: Proximity Forest 2.0: A new effective and scalable similarity-based classifier for time series\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section provides a brief background overview of time series classification and key related work.\nWe refer interested readers to the paper  for a more detailed survey and discussion on TSC. A time series is a sequence of data points measuring a phenomenon over time.\nIn addition to signals ordered in time (such as a sensor signal), time series techniques are often applied to other numeric series such as spectra. The¬†UCR time series benchmark includes a number of such series.\nTSC learns a function from time series S={s1,s2,‚Ä¶‚ÄãsL}ùëÜsubscriptùë†1subscriptùë†2‚Ä¶subscriptùë†ùêøS=\\{s_{1},s_{2},...s_{L}\\} of length LùêøL to a discrete class label cùëêc .\nWe will focus our attention on univariate time series, where si‚ààSsubscriptùë†ùëñùëÜs_{i}\\in S is a 1-dimensional point, with equal length, as this is where most of the research in TSC has been focused.\nWe note that there is also work on multivariate time series  , where si‚ààSsubscriptùë†ùëñùëÜs_{i}\\in S is a dùëëd-dimensional point, and time series of variable length [ref]41 and will consider these as future work. TSC algorithms are usually categorised by the core data representation used.\nSimilarity-based algorithms (Section 2.1) work on the raw time series, i.e. time series that are not transformed to any other domains or representations   0.\nThey rely on elastic similarity measures to match the shape and calculates the similarity between two series. Shapelets-based approaches are similar to similarity-based approaches.\nThey calculate the similarity between a series and a phase discriminatory subsequence called shapelets.\nOne of the most accurate shapelets-based approaches ‚Äì the Shapelets Transform (ST) algorithm transforms a time series using its similarity to all shapelets and trains a Rotation Forest for classification  9.\nInstead of finding a single phase discriminatory pattern in the series, dictionary-based methods such as HYDRA  and Temporal Dictionary Ensemble (TDE) 8 transform the series into ‚Äòwords‚Äô, which are commonly interpreted as recurring patterns in the series.\nThey work by comparing the frequency of each word between two series. Features and interval-based algorithms extract features from intervals of the series and train a machine learning (ML) algorithm for the classification task.\nThey are more effective than algorithms that extract features from the whole series due to their ability to find relevant temporal features.\nThe most accurate interval-based algorithm, DrCIF is a forest of time series trees.\nIt¬†works with multiple representations and extracts random set of features from random intervals per tree 7 8. The majority of traditional TSC algorithms only work with a single representation.\nHowever, a number of more recent TSC algorithms work with multiple representations.\nThey exploit the fact that different problems require different representations and leverage on the relationship between the different representations to achieve high classification performance.\nConvolution and transformation approaches, such as the Rocket approaches    and MrSQM 1, have become popular due to their scalability and accuracy.\nThey map the time series into a high-dimensional space by creating massive features using large number of convolutions and transformation operations.\nThis massive feature space captures multiple representations of the series, allowing them to achieve superior classification accuracy.\nThe most accurate TSC algorithm HIVE-COTE 2.0 is a meta-ensemble that consists of 4 main ensemble classifiers, each of them being one of the best classifiers in their respective representation.\nTS-CHIEF  is a tree-based homogeneous ensemble where the different representations are embedded within the nodes of the tree.\nDeep learning algorithms learn the best representations for the time series problem through a neural network 5.\nDeep learning approaches such as InceptionTime 6, are powerful because they have the capabilities to learn latent representations of the series that generalise well to new time series.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: the research in TSC has been focused.\nWe note that there is also work on multivariate time series  , where si‚ààSsubscriptùë†ùëñùëÜs_{i}\\in S is a dùëëd-dimensional point, and time series of variable length [ref]41 and will consider these as future work. TSC algorithms are usually categorised by the core data representation used.\nSimilarity-based algorithms (Section 2.1) work on the raw time series,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
