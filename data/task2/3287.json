      "content": "Paper Title: An Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy System with Integrated Feature Selection and Rule Extraction for High-Dimensional Classification Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConsider a classification problem involving C𝐶C classes. Let an instance or data point be represented by a D𝐷D-dimensional feature vector, i.e., 𝐱=(x1,x2,⋯,xD)T∈ℝD𝐱superscriptsubscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2⋯subscript𝑥𝐷𝑇superscriptℝ𝐷\\mathbf{x}=(x_{1},x_{2},\\cdots,x_{D})^{T}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D}. We assume that each feature is associated with S𝑆S fuzzy sets. For a CoCo-FRB based TSK Fuzzy System, the number of fuzzy rules, R𝑅R, is equal to S𝑆S   . Generally, the rt​h​(r=1,2,⋯,R)subscript𝑟𝑡ℎ𝑟12⋯𝑅r_{th}~{}(r=1,2,\\cdots,R) fuzzy rule of the first-order TSK model for classification problems is described as below: where Ar,d​(d=1,2,⋯,D)subscript𝐴𝑟𝑑𝑑12⋯𝐷A_{r,d}~{}(d=1,2,\\cdots,D) is the fuzzy set associated with dt​hsubscript𝑑𝑡ℎd_{th} feature in the rt​hsubscript𝑟𝑡ℎr_{th} rule, yrc​(𝐱)​(c=1,2,⋯,C)superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑟𝑐𝐱𝑐12⋯𝐶y_{r}^{c}(\\mathbf{x})~{}(c=1,2,\\cdots,C) means the output of the rt​hsubscript𝑟𝑡ℎr_{th} rule for the ct​hsubscript𝑐𝑡ℎc_{th} class computed from 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} and pr,dcsubscriptsuperscript𝑝𝑐𝑟𝑑p^{c}_{r,d} represents the consequent parameter of the rt​hsubscript𝑟𝑡ℎr_{th} rule associated with the dt​hsubscript𝑑𝑡ℎd_{th} feature for the ct​hsubscript𝑐𝑡ℎc_{th} class. There are plenty of choices of membership functions (MFs) that can be used for Ar,dsubscript𝐴𝑟𝑑A_{r,d}, such as triangular, trapezoidal, and Gaussian functions  . We note that the Gaussian MF is frequently employed due to its smooth and infinitely differentiable properties. Specifically, the membership value of xdsubscript𝑥𝑑x_{d} on Ar,dsubscript𝐴𝑟𝑑A_{r,d} is: where mr,dsubscript𝑚𝑟𝑑m_{r,d} and σr,dsubscript𝜎𝑟𝑑\\sigma_{r,d} represent respectively the center and spread of the rt​hsubscript𝑟𝑡ℎr_{th} Gaussian membership function defined on the dt​hsubscript𝑑𝑡ℎd_{th} input variable. Note that, although in equation (2) the argument of μr,dsubscript𝜇𝑟𝑑\\mu_{r,d} is shown as 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}, the function only uses the dt​hsubscript𝑑𝑡ℎd_{th} component of 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}. In , the authors used μ=e−(x−m)2σ2𝜇superscript𝑒superscript𝑥𝑚2superscript𝜎2\\mu=e^{-\\frac{(x-m)^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}}} as membership function but set σ=1𝜎1\\sigma=1 for all fuzzy subsystems which means (2) is simplified as: Following , the membership values are evaluated by (3) in this paper. Clearly, these values are all between 00 and 111, i.e., 0<μr,d​(𝐱)≤10subscript𝜇𝑟𝑑𝐱10<\\mu_{r,d}(\\mathbf{x})\\leq 1. Since minimum is not differentiable, the product is often used to compute the firing strength     [ref]9  : where fr​(𝐱)subscript𝑓𝑟𝐱f_{r}(\\mathbf{x}) is the firing strength of the rt​hsubscript𝑟𝑡ℎr_{th} rule for the input 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}. Note that the product T-norm often leads to a fatal flaw when the dimension, D𝐷D, is pretty large. It easily makes fr​(𝐱)subscript𝑓𝑟𝐱f_{r}(\\mathbf{x}) very close to 00 even beyond the scope that machines can identify, that is, “numeric underflow” . The output of the rt​hsubscript𝑟𝑡ℎr_{th} rule associated the ct​hsubscript𝑐𝑡ℎc_{th} class computed from 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} is: If the normalized firing strength is defined as: then the ct​hsubscript𝑐𝑡ℎc_{th} component of the system output on 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} is: For the sake of clarity, the neural network structure implementing CoCo-FRB based TSK fuzzy system described above is shown in Fig. 1. By contrast, FuCo-FRB considers all possible valid combinations of fuzzy sets defined on each feature, in which the number of rules exponentially increases with the dimension of the feature space. The details of these two fuzzy rule bases will be illustrated and compared in Subsection III-B. Assume that there are N𝑁N training samples. There are several choices of error functions  [ref]9  that can be used to update system parameters based on back-propagation procedure or gradient descent (GD) algorithm   . The typical mean square error function is used in this paper: where yc​(𝐱n)superscript𝑦𝑐subscript𝐱𝑛y^{c}(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) and yc​(𝐱n)subscript𝑦𝑐subscript𝐱𝑛y_{c}(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) respectively correspond to the ct​hsubscript𝑐𝑡ℎc_{th} component of the system output and the true label vector for the nt​hsubscript𝑛𝑡ℎn_{th} input instance, 𝐱n​(n=1,2,⋯,N)subscript𝐱𝑛𝑛12⋯𝑁\\mathbf{x}_{n}~{}(n=1,2,\\cdots,N). The gradients of the error function (8) with respect to the antecedent and consequent parameters are presented as: where xn,dsubscript𝑥𝑛𝑑x_{n,d} is the dt​hsubscript𝑑𝑡ℎd_{th} component of sample 𝐱nsubscript𝐱𝑛\\mathbf{x}_{n}. Then, the update formula of system parameters in the kt​hsubscript𝑘𝑡ℎk_{th} iteration is as follows: where ω𝜔\\omega indicates the general parameters of antecedent and consequent parts, η>0𝜂0\\eta>0 is the learning rate.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: values are all between 00 and 111, i.e., 0<μr,d​(𝐱)≤10subscript𝜇𝑟𝑑𝐱10<\\mu_{r,d}(\\mathbf{x})\\leq 1.
