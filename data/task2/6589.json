      "content": "Paper Title: TIAM - A Metric for Evaluating Alignment in Text-to-Image Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe evaluation of generated images often relies on metrics such as Inception Score (IS) [ref]42 and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [ref]17, which are commonly used to assess their quality and fidelity. However, these metrics do not capture the alignment between the provided condition(s) and the generated images. To address this issue, several methods have been proposed to measure whether the content of the generated images reflects the given conditions. One approach involves utilizing classification models [ref]39 and object detection models (Semantic Object Accuracy, abbreviated as SOA)  to determine whether the generated images contain the specified objects or adhere to certain criteria. SOA uses actual prompts from COCO while our approach relies on prompt templates that allow a finer analysis of the influence of each element in the prompt. Another method specific to text-image alignment involves employing visual score similarity measures. It leverages contrastive models such as CLIP, which compute a similarity score between representations of images and text. Although CLIP has a great average semantic representation, it has poor compositional understanding , limiting a fine evaluation of text-image alignment. Our metric addresses this issue by leveraging a high-performance detector and by controlling the requested attributes in an explainable manner and aligning with human perception. Recent efforts have introduced innovative methodologies to assess skills and measure biases of T2I models. Notably, Drawbench  presents a limited set of text prompts covering 11 skills to evaluate the models. Similarly, DALL-EVAL  proposes to evaluate three visual reasoning skills: the capacity to generate one object (object recognition), the capacity to generate the exact quantity number of the asked object (counting), and the capacity to place two objects (spatial reasoning). Additionally, they probe gender and skin bias in the model representation. Another contribution by Zhang et al.  delves into the gender depiction disparities enabling the study of potential stereotypes. Our methods focus on catastrophic neglect and attribute binding. We can see the catastrophic neglect approach as object recognition but by testing one or more different objects in the conditioning prompt. Moreover, to overcome results that are very sensitive to asked objects in prompt and evaluate the model’s performance accurately systematically, we explore all various object and attribute combinations and we generate multiple images per prompt to enhance result robustness. Recognizing the impact of initial noises, we advocate for multiple seed testing. This approach offers a comprehensive evaluation, free from the limitations of specific labels, resulting in a more precise and less biased assessment. A closely related work  conducted concurrently with ours shares some conclusions, though it does not delve into the aspect of the starting noises.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: The evaluation of generated images often relies on metrics such as Inception Score (IS) [ref]42 and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [ref]17, which are commonly used to assess their quality and fidelity.
