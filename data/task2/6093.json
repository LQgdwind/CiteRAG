      "content": "Paper Title: New Adversarial Image Detection Based on Sentiment Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated their excellent performance in image classification, voice recognition, and text categorization. However, recent studies indicate that adversarial instances can undermine DNNs. Specifically, intentionally perturbed inputs, also known as adversarial examples, can mislead DNNs to make highly confident erroneous predictions¬†. The perturbation required is typically imperceptible to human eyes, making the perturbation hard to detect¬†. This undesirable property of DNNs has developed into a significant security concern in real-world applications, such as self-driving cars¬† and identity recognition¬†. A recent and effective approach to detecting adversarial attacks takes the feature maps produced by the hidden layers of a DNN (e.g., a DNN-based image classifier) as input, and detects adversarial input examples by measuring the difference between benign and adversarial feature maps¬†[ref]5 [ref]6 [ref]7   0.\nFor instance, a detection method named Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID)¬†[ref]5 uses the difference of dimension between the subspaces surrounding adversarial examples and clean examples. Another detection method, known as Deep kùëòk-Nearest Neighbors (DkùëòkNN)¬†[ref]6, applies the kùëòk-nearest neighbors (kùëòk-NN) technique on feature maps to assess the difference between the feature maps of the input example‚Äôs kùëòk-nearest neighbors and those of benign examples in the predicted class against a predefined threshold. Nearest Neighbor Influence Functions (NNIF)¬†[ref]7 is another popular adversarial example detector, which detects adversarial examples by assessing the correlation between the input example‚Äôs kùëòk-nearest neighbors and the most influential benign examples identified during training. A Mahalanobis distance-based algorithm developed in¬† fits the feature maps to a class-conditional Gaussian distribution and then detects adversarial examples by measuring the Mahalanobis distances of the feature maps.  Besides the hidden-layer feature maps of a DNN, Be Your Own Neighborhood (BEYOND)¬† utilizes the output of the DNN to detect adversarial examples. It uses the hidden-layer representations provided by self-supervised learning (SSL) and the DNN‚Äôs predicted label to examine the relation between adversarial examples and their augmented versions. Moreover, Positive‚ÄìNegative Detector (PNDetector)¬†0 trains a positive-negative classifier against both benign examples (positive representations) and their negative representations that complement the benign examples in each pixel to identify adversarial examples. The above existing adversarial example detectors¬†[ref]5 [ref]6 [ref]7  0  depend primarily on machine learning techniques or hand-crafted measures. Despite performing reasonably well against some mild types of attacks (e.g., FGSM¬†1 and Jacobian-based salience map attack (JSMA)¬†2), the existing adversarial example detectors are less effective in detecting mighty attacks, such as DeepFool¬†3 and Elastic-Net Attacks on DNNs (EAD)¬†4. In this paper, we propose a new and effective adversarial example detector for DNN-based image classification. The new detector is a shallow neural network with only a few layers and a small number of parameters, and outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors in identifying the latest attacks, including DeepFool and EAD, on widely used image datasets. The key idea is that we propose to detect adversarial examples by extracting the progressively and increasingly manifesting impact of adversarial perturbations on the hidden-layer feature maps of the DNN (as opposed to the feature maps only). In light of the progressive manifest of sentiment in a sentence, we propose to embed the hidden-layer feature maps into word vectors (i.e., a sentence) and detect adversarial examples using sentiment analysis. Another important aspect is a new and efficient embedding layer that embeds the differently-sized, three-dimensional (3D), hidden-layer feature maps to word vectors with consistent lengths and assembles sentences ready for sentiment analysis.\nSpecifically, a modular design is taken to create a trainable module to match the dimensions between the feature maps of successively selected hidden layers. Then, each feature map can be embedded into a word vector via a cascade of modules, thereby minimizing the number of trainable modules and learnable parameters. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. New sentiment analysis-based interpretation of adversarial example detection and meticulous selection of TextCNN for sentiment analysis, through rigorous experimental comparisons with other candidate neural network structures; New modular design of an embedding layer, which reshapes and embeds the differently-sized, 3D hidden-layer feature maps of a DNN to word vectors with equal length (and assembles sentences for sentiment analysis) using the minimum number of trainable parameters; Extensive experiments that corroborate the superior effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed adversarial example detector under the latest adversarial example attacks compared to the state-of-the-art adversarial example detectors. The experiments demonstrate that the new adversarial example detector consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art detection algorithms, such as LID¬†[ref]5, DkùëòkNN¬†[ref]6, NNIF¬†[ref]7, BEYOND¬†, PNDetector¬†0 and Mahalanobis algorithm¬†, in identifying the latest attacks, including AutoAttack¬†5, DeepFool¬†3 and EAD¬†4, on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets. We use Bhattacharyya distance¬†6, hidden layer visualization, and ablation study to shed insight on the gain of the new detector. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section¬†II reviews the state-of-the-art attacks and detectors. Section¬†III provides the system and threat models. In Section¬†IV, we elaborate on the design of the new sentiment analysis-based adversarial example detector. The new detector is experimentally examined against cutting-edge attack models and compared with state-of-art detection algorithms in Section¬†V, followed by concluding remarks in Section¬†VI.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: produced by the hidden layers of a DNN (e.g., a DNN-based image classifier) as input, and detects adversarial input examples by measuring the difference between benign and adversarial feature maps¬†[ref]5 [ref]6 [ref]7   0.\nFor instance, a detection method named Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID)¬†[ref]5 uses the difference of dimension between the subspaces surrounding adversarial examples\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
