      "content": "Paper Title: Non-linear Motion Estimation for Video Frame Interpolation using Space-time Convolutions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBased on the type of motion cues used, VFI methods can be mainly classified into three categories: 1) Optical flow based approaches: In this class of methods, optical flow [ref]21   is predominantly used as a motion cue for interpolating frames. Recent state-of-the-art methods use fully convolutional networks (FCN) , 2D UNets [ref]24 , multi-scale architectures  4, or bilateral cost volume  to predict backward optical flows to warp the neighboring frames and estimate the interpolated frame. In some methods, forward optical flow is also utilized  .\nHowever, these class of methods rely on estimating the optical flow based on 2D CNNs at the frame-level that might not capture motion features well. Our work belongs to this category with a key difference in that we use a 3D CNN to capture a large spatiotemporal stride to better estimate per-pixel non-linear motion. 2) Phase-based approaches: Estimating accurate optical flow is a hard problem, especially when it involves large motion, illumination variations and motion blur. An alternative cue to optical flow is to use phase-based modification of pixels. These methods estimate low-level features such as per-pixel phase , fourier decomposition of images using steerable pyramids , phase and amplitude features using one-dimensional separable Gabor filters  to estimate the interpolated frame. 3) Kernel-based approaches: Different from optical flow and phase-based methods, kernel-based methods strive to estimate per-pixel kernels to blend patches from neighborhood frames. Some of these methods employ adaptive convolution , adaptive separable convolution  or adaptive deformable convolutions . Apart from these categories, some methods proposed a hybrid approach to utilize the advantage from multiple cues. For instance, a combination of interpolation kernels and optical flow  or optical flow and depth  are employed to obtain complementary features.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Based on the type of motion cues used, VFI methods can be mainly classified into three categories: 1) Optical flow based approaches: In this class of methods, optical flow [ref]21   is predominantly used as a motion cue for interpolating frames.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
