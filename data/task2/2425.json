Human correlation capability in perceiving these two modalities simultaneously lead them to act accordingly in their real life events. Taking inspiration of this fact,    [ref]21  utilizes these audio-video correspondence properties for training their neural networks with unlabeled video data. The audio-visual relationship is employed to develop deep neural network in various fields of applications e.g. for the material recognition task , sound source localization task in video       [ref]28 , audio source separation tasks [ref]29, audio event identification task for video analysis , video action recognition to automatic foley generation task . Likewise, advanced research approaches are proposed in   [ref]28 has provided on localizing a sound source against visual data in 3D space utilizing human adaptation ability to observe audio-visual events. In [ref]21, an automatic video sound recognition and visualization framework is proposed, where nonverbal sounds in a video are automatically converted into animated sound words and are placed close to the sound source of that video for visualization. In addition, attention mechanism learning network for the sound source proposed in , semantic guided modules (SGMs) performed in  for action recognition to extract spatial-temporal features from videos show promising applicability in audio-visual association properties. We are highly motivated by these researches on audio-visual relevance, hence in this work we aim for improved mapping of audio-video features by expanding our AutoFoley deep neural network with an efficient generative adversarial model.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: the event status.
