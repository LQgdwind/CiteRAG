      "content": "Paper Title: PaST-NoC: A Packet-Switched Superconducting Temporal NoC\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSuperconductivity is the property of certain metals to have zero resistance below a critical temperature that is usually a few Kelvins¬†. The fundamental superconducting switching device is the JJ¬†. The JJ allows current to pass through its two terminals with no resistance until a critical current IcsubscriptùêºùëêI_{c} is reached. Reaching IcsubscriptùêºùëêI_{c} causes the JJ to switch to a resistive state, causing a magnetic quantum flux transfer. This transfer is observable at the JJ terminal as a voltage pulse that lasts only a few picoseconds and has an amplitude of a few mVs¬†.\nBecause JJs can switch in just a few picoseconds, they enable clock frequencies of several tens of GHz¬†  . Moreover, superconducting digital computing promises energy-efficient computation even after\naccounting for cooling, due to the low JJ energy consumption which is several orders of magnitude lower than CMOS¬†.\nCooling is already present in cryo-cooled systems such as quantum computers¬†4 and outer space electronics¬†.\nHowever, there is currently an approximate 1000√ó\\times area density gap compared to CMOS¬† [ref]6.\nThis limits superconducting digital circuits to small scales and memory sizes. The most mature superconducting digital logic family is RSFQ and its variants¬†. In\nRSFQ, a logical 1 is encoded by the presence of a pulse and a logical 0 by the absence of a pulse. Because pulses (or their absence) are short-lived and travel at the speed of light, they are unlikely to arrive at logic gates at the same time. Therefore, RSFQ typically requires almost each gate in the design to be clocked, resulting in deeply-pipelined architectures;\nthis increases the cost overhead associated with clock tree generation and distribution as well as makes timing closure challenging¬†. Importantly, fanout in RSFQ requires splitter cells that use three JJs each and have one input and two outputs.\nFor instance, clocking 1024 synchronous gates requires 3072 JJs for 1024 splitters¬†1, a significant percentage of the overall design.\nRSFQ offers a rich set of traditional gates, such as ANDs, ORs, and data flip flops.\nMost gates are based on a superconducting loop that includes at least one JJ, called a  superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). SQUIDs preserve current where the intensity and direction of flow can be used to store state.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: is already present in cryo-cooled systems such as quantum computers¬†4 and outer space electronics¬†.\nHowever, there is currently an approximate 1000√ó\\times area density gap compared to CMOS¬† [ref]6.\nThis limits superconducting digital circuits to small scales and memory sizes. The most mature superconducting digital logic family is RSFQ and its variants¬†.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
