      "content": "Paper Title: Static Analysis of Logic Programs via Boolean Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAnswer Set Programming (ASP) has emerged as a powerful declarative programming paradigm for solving complex combinatorial problems under the umbrella of logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning¬†.\nIts basic idea is to describe the specifications of a problem by means of a logic program: solutions of this problem will be represented by the stable models of the logic program¬†.\nThen the logic program can be fed into a software system called an ASP solver such as DLV, Cmodels, Smodels, or clasp¬†, which can compute some or all stable models of this program.\nWith the constant improvements in both theory (e.g., expressive powers) and practice (e.g., efficient ASP solvers), ASP has been successfully applied to a wide range of areas in AI (e.g., planning, knowledge representation and reasoning, semantic web, natural language processing, and argumentation) and beyond (e.g., systems biology, computational biology, bounded model checking, software engineering, robotics, and manufacturing)¬†. In general, the problem of deciding if a given ground normal logic program has some stable model is NP-complete¬†.\nIt is thus natural to consider the static analysis of ASP, i.e., answering the question: What can be said about stable models of a logic program from its static information?\nHerein, a Logic Program (LP) is considered as a ground normal logic program¬† and its static information is mostly considered as graph representations of the LP such as (positive) dependence graphs¬†[ref]14, cycle and extended dependence graphs¬† , rule graphs¬†, and block graphs¬†.\nHistorically, the first studies of this research direction focused on the existence of a unique stable model in dependence graph-based classes of LPs including positive LPs¬†, acyclic LPs¬†, and locally stratified LPs¬†.\nIn 1994, Fages proved the most important result about the coincidence between stable models and models of the Clark‚Äôs completion (equivalently supported models) in tight LPs¬†[ref]14.\nBeing finer-represented than dependence graphs, cycle and extended dependence graphs were introduced and several improved results were obtained¬† .\nHowever, there is quite limited progress regarding this direction.\nMoreover, it is noted that the cycle graph or the extended dependence graph of an LP can have exponentially many vertices as the LP can have an exponential number of cycles¬† or rules¬†, respectively.\nRecently, we have been only aware of the work¬†, which presents new understanding of the positive dependence graph to possibly strengthen some existing theoretical results.\nIn summary, while the static analysis of ASP is important and has a wide range of useful applications in both theory and practice of ASP¬†[ref]14  , there is quite limited progress on this research topic. Boolean Networks (BNs) are a simple yet efficient mathematical formalism that has been widely applied to many areas from science to engineering¬† 9: mathematics, systems biology, computer science, theoretical physics, robotics, social modeling, neural networks, etc.\nA BN includes nùëõn Boolean variables associated with nùëõn corresponding Boolean functions that determine the value update of a variable over time.\nIn this sense, a BN can be seen as a discrete dynamical system¬† .\nOriginated by the early work¬†, the static analysis of BNs (i.e., studying relations between the dynamics of a BN and its influence graph) has a rich history of research¬†[ref]33.\nIn particular, most results focus on exploring relations between fixed points and the influence graph of a BN, where a fixed point is a state once entered, the BN‚Äôs dynamics cannot escape from it¬†[ref]4.\nTo date, this research direction is still growing with many prominent and deep results¬†[ref]33  . ASP has found widespread applications in both the modeling and analysis of BNs.\nIt has been notably used for important tasks on BNs (all are computational ones) such as fixed point enumeration¬†9, enumeration and approximation of attractors¬†9 4, inference of BNs from biological data¬†, model repair¬†, and reprogramming¬†3.\nIn the opposite direction, there is however no significant work trying to use BNs for studying the static analysis of ASP.\nIndeed, the initial connection between ASP and BNs can be traced back to the theoretical work by¬†0.\nIn this work, the authors used LPs to model BNs, and vice versa.\nHowever, their investigations were limited to the conceptual level, and no subsequent studies have delved deeper into this connection so far. In this work, we try to explore in depth the static analysis of ASP.\nHerein, static information of an LP is considered as its Dependence Graph (DG)¬†[ref]14.\nThe DG can be efficiently (syntactically) computed from the LP itself and might be in general more compact than other graph representations (e.g., cycle or extended dependence graphs¬† ), but can tell many significant insights about stable models of the LP as we shall show in this paper.\nOur main contribution is to consolidate the initial connection between LPs and BNs proposed in¬†0, and in particular to use this connection for the first time to explore and prove several relations between stable models of an LP and its DG.\nMore specifically, we obtain several new theoretical results on how positive and negative cycles on the DG affect the number of stable models of the LP.\nFurthermore, we also demonstrate several potential applications of the newly obtained results to other important problems in the field of ASP.\nAll the above elements show that the approach proposed in the present paper can bring the plenty of results in the field of BNs (and the field of discrete dynamical systems in general) to the field of ASP as well as provide a unified framework for exploring and proving more new theoretical results in ASP. In the rest of this paper, Section¬†2 recalls preliminaries on logic programs and Boolean networks.\nSection¬†3 presents the connection between logic programs and Boolean networks along with the relations between stable models and positive and/or negative cycles.\nSection¬†4 presents discussions on potential applications and extensions of the new theoretical results.\nSection¬†5 concludes the paper and draws future work.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: a Logic Program (LP) is considered as a ground normal logic program¬† and its static information is mostly considered as graph representations of the LP such as (positive) dependence graphs¬†[ref]14, cycle and extended dependence graphs¬† , rule graphs¬†, and block graphs¬†.\nHistorically, the first studies of this research direction focused on the existence of a unique stable model in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
