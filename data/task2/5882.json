Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Questions of science: chatting with ChatGPT about complex systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nChatGPT and other transformers-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities to perform tasks such as completion tasks, question answering, reading comprehension and translation that were once thought to be exclusive to humans [ref]1  [ref]3     [ref]8. We are currently in a great era for researchers and scientists studying and developing in the field of complex systems. Half of the physics Nobel prize of 2021 was awarded to the physicist Giorgio Parisi for his contributions to the theory of complex systems  and the other half to two meteorologists Syukuro Manabe and Klaus Hasselmann to the modeling of the Earth’s climate . Parisi has made significant contributions to the literature on complex systems, including areas such as spin glass   , stochastic resonance , surface growth , multifractality , and bird flocking . Manabe showed that there is a relation between the increase in global temperature and the level of CO2 in the atmosphere . Hasselmann developed a model that establishes a connection between weather and climate, implying that climate models can be reliable despite the unpredictability and complexity of weather patterns  0. The diversity of research topics among the award recipients highlights the multidisciplinary nature of the field. In addition, the applied dimension of the contributions stresses the importance of applied contributions to the field. In particular, it is worth mentioning that the research of field of complex systems has developed multiple frameworks, such as chaos theory 1, fractal theory 2, complex networks 3 4, and agent-based models 5, to model and solve important practical problems in diverse fields. OpenAI has just now introduced the ChatGPT, a large language model tool trained, to aid humans in a variate of human tasks including question answering, text edition and has been used as a great information provider [ref]8 6. ChatGPT has been trained on a large dataset of internet texts, which means that it has learned to mimic the patterns and styles of language used by many different people online. When you talk to ChatGPT, it responds based on what it has learned from that dataset, so its answers can be thought of as representing the average opinions, ideas, and language patterns that are commonly found on the internet. In this paper, we overview different aspects of the field of complex systems by means of chats with ChatGPT. We split this paper into two parts. The first part explores issues related to teaching and learning, where ChatGPT may work as a teacher assistant. The second part explores issues related to research, where, in this case, ChatGPT works like a research assistant. Besides exploring different concepts from different points of view in the field of complex systems, we also recognize that ChatGPT can be a valuable resource for teachers and scientists.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities to perform tasks such as completion tasks, question answering, reading comprehension and translation that were once thought to be exclusive to humans [ref]1  [ref]3     [ref]8.
