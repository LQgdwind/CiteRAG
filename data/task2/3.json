Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Without special notation, all experiments are conducted using vanilla PointNet++ [ref]25 as backbone (without introducing any multi-scale grouping operation). We use ADAM optimizer with initial learning rate of 1e-2, momentum of 0.9 and batch size of 16. The learning rate is divided by 2 for every 3√ó1053superscript1053\\times 10^{5} iterations.\nThe hyper-parameters for metric learning are selected to be the same with [ref]36, namely, œÉv=0.5subscriptùúéùë£0.5\\sigma_{v}=0.5, œÉd=1.5subscriptùúéùëë1.5\\sigma_{d}=1.5. The number for memory slots is set to 150 per-category. The loss weight for LùêøL is set to 0.01, which has a significant influence to the final performance.\nThe whole network is trained end-to-end for 100 epochs in total. During inference time, blocks within each room are merged in a snack pattern by utilizing the segmentation and instance results of the overlapped region.
