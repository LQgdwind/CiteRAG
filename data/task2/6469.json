Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

For all attack methods, we set the perturbation budget ϵ=8/255italic-ϵ8255\\epsilon=8/255. We generate adversarial perturbation with 20 iterations with the step size ϵ/10italic-ϵ10\\epsilon/10 for the PGD attack. In the case of CW  attack, we use L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty}-norm bounded attacks with 200 iterations. In the case of Auto Attack (AA) , it includes four attack methods (APGD-CE, APGD-DLR , FAB [ref]43, and Square Attack ) and generates adversarial perturbation by ensembling them. For FAB attack hyper-parameters, we optimize the perturbation with 100 iterations and 5 random restarts. In the case of Square attack, we fed 5000 queries for the black-box attack.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: To evaluate the defensive performance of the proposed method, we conduct four adversarial attack methods used as benchmarks for evaluating adversarial robustness (FGSM [ref]4, PGD [ref]6, CW , and AutoAttack ).
