Transfer learning approaches have been popular in the sentiment analysis and shown to be successful especially in datasets with small number of instances [ref]9. Through transfer learning, an extensive amount of unlabeled data in the social media have been incorporated to increase the performance of the target sentiment analysis task, e.g., [ref]9 employs 1.7 billion tweets with emojis to pretrain the network. However,  demonstrates that the transfer learning approach does not improve the performance on the SemEval emotion classification competition datasets, which is our target due to the richness of its labels, which has significantly more number of instances compared to the number of instances used in [ref]9.  emulates a multi-label classifier through a binary classifier for each of the four opposite emotions that are on the opposite sides of the Plutchik’s wheel of emotions as shown in Fig. 1 such as joy and sadness. However, their approach does not include the correlations to the rest of the labels since they train each of the four classifiers with the objective of binary classification of the opposite sides. To remedy those issues, we introduce a multi-label deep learning model for the emoji prediction task that directly predicts the active set of labels simultaneously, i.e., in the multi-task setting. Moreover, the multi-label classification is a generalization of binary and multi-class classification tasks as we describe through remarks, thus, our method is also applicable to these tasks. The multi-label classification also requires a prediction method that converts scores into the predictions, for which we derive a class specific thresholding by macro-f1 maximization in linear time complexity. Multi-label classification has an inherent issue of data imbalance . Although significant research has been performed in the literature, the class imbalance problem remains a challenge for multi-label classification . Consider the multi-label classification task with 161616 distinct labels. There are 216superscript2162^{16} possible combinations in the superset of the labels. Accordingly, it is not feasible to obtain balanced data for each combination of the labels. Many studies in multi-output classification either try to balance the data by resampling or ignore the imbalance . Yet, the over-sampling and under-sampling methods are not designed for the multi-label classification, thus, their adaptation to the multi-label setting is not straightforward . One heuristic that is widely adapted is using inverse class frequency per class as a weighting factor . However, this heuristic results in suboptimal performance as shown by  and in Section IV-E.  replaces the inverse number of instances with the expected volume of instances and a controlling hyperparameter.  proposes to use class prior probabilities as weights for the cross-entropy loss. Commonly, these methods propose static weights for each class. To remedy the label imbalance in the multi-label setting, we introduce a novel dynamic weighting method, which equalizes the contribution of each class to the loss. We use focal loss  to incorporate the hardness of the instances and our dynamic weighting method can readily be adapted to other losses as we show through a remark. Recent language models such as BERT 6 have been dominating the areas in the NLP literature, however, they contain an excessive amount of parameters. Accordingly, training or fine-tuning these models require an excessive amount of resources 6. We employ RoBERTa-XLM , which is a robustly trained BERT on 100 languages, as feature extractor to benefit from BERT as well as reducing the amount of required resources. SemEval emotion classification competition  has paved the way for many multi-label sentiment analysis models. EMA, PARTNA are among the models that opt for the more traditional support vector machine approaches and still achieve the best results in the Arabic language 8. On the other hand, more recent long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNNs) and attention models are also adopted to obtain the highest ranked results in English and Spanish 9 . It is important to note that most of these models are language specific, and use special embeddings such as AraVec  or special lexicons paired with language specific preprocessing steps. Tw-StAR attempts to create a generic model to apply multiple languages, yet, is ranked behind the language-specific models . We introduce a framework that uses bidirectional LSTM with attention and multi-label focal loss, which achieves the best score only using a single model on 7 of the 9 metrics on three different languages of the SemEval emotion classification competition .\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Deep learning based methods have been shown to be successful in various classification tasks [ref]8.
