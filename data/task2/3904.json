      "content": "Paper Title: CSI-fingerprinting Indoor Localization via Attention-Augmented Residual Convolutional Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCSI-fingerprinting indoor positioning systems have achieved wide attentions in recent years. In 2012, Xiao et al.  proposed FIFS using the summation of power across frequency bands in CSI as fingerprints and achieved higher accuracy than traditional received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based approach. In , channel responses on multiple antennas were aggregated for CSI-based fingerprinting indoor positioning. Afterwards, exploring channel information in both frequency and spatial domain becomes the mainstream. With the development of machine learning, many learning-based approaches have been proposed to improve localization accuracy using CSI fingerprints    [ref]5,9. For example, in , restricted Bolzmann machines (RBMs) were used to store the CSI-fingerprints as trainable weights for following matching algorithms. Long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) was adopted in [ref]5 to explore the correlation of CSI features over time. X. Wang et al. in  constructed a set of CSI images from received packets and used deep CNN\nfor feature extraction and location estimation. In 9, a Broad Learning System is introduced to reduce the training time of positioning systems. The methods mentioned above all collect multiple received packets for one position to suppress channel fluctuation and noise. However, it is hard to collect multiple packets in a short time when tracking a moving target. Therefore, positioning with a single CSI sample is required. Several CNN-based methods that take a single CSI sample as input have been proposed  [ref]7   0. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN\narchitecture that leads to better positioning accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: and spatial domain becomes the mainstream.
