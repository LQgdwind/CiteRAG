Specifically,\nthe paper reports a Gaussian boson sampling experiment representing a quantum state\nin ∼1030similar-toabsentsuperscript1030\\sim 10^{30}-dimensional Hilbert space\nand a sampling rate that is ∼1014similar-toabsentsuperscript1014\\sim 10^{14} faster than that of using digital supercomputers.\nThis paper was described as the first independent verification of the Google’s quantum advantage claims. In fact, the\nclaimed advantage is several orders of magnitude higher than Google’s claims. This huge computational advantage claim is based on\ncertain statistical tests measuring the proximity of the empirical samples to\nthe outcomes of noiseless\nsimulations of the quantum experiment. (The simulations were run on a digital supercomputer.)\nThe statistical reasoning of ) is\nbased on comparing the empirical samples\nto a few other distributions.\nHowever, in view of the 2014 results of Kalai and Kindler  this statistical reasoning is incorrect and therefore\nthe conclusion of achieving huge quantum computational advantage is unfounded.\nMoreover, a polynomial-time\nalgorithm from Kalai and Kindler  may achieve similar or better\nsampling quality for the statistical methods of . See also  and Renema [ref]37 (and papers cited there).\nKalai and Kindler’s analysis   is based on taking a truncated\nFourier–Hermite expansion on the boson sampling distribution. Renema’s paper proposes another method of “spoofing,” namely,\nanother efficient algorithm for achieving similar sampling quality based on an algorithm of Clifford and Clifford .\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: advantage is unfounded.\nMoreover, a polynomial-time\nalgorithm from Kalai and Kindler  may achieve similar or better\nsampling quality for the statistical methods of .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
