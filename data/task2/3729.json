      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Local Displacements for Point Cloud Completion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnderstanding the entire 3D space is essential for both humans and machines to understand how to safely navigate an environment or how to interact with the objects around them.\nHowever, when we capture the 3D structure of an object or scene from a certain viewpoint, a large portion of the whole geometry is typically missing due to self-occlusion and/or occlusion from its surrounding.\nTo solve this problem, geometric completion of scenes  7  and objects [ref]45    0 has emerged as a task that takes on a 2.5D/3D observation and fills out the occluded regions, as illustrated in Fig. 1. There are multiple ways to represent 3D shapes.\nPoint cloud  , volumetric grid 7 , mesh  and implicit surfaces 1   are among the most common data formats.\nThese representations are used for most 3D-related computer vision tasks such as segmentation, classification and completion.\nFor what concerns geometric completion, most works are focused on either point cloud or volumetric data. Among them, the characteristic of having an explicitly defined local neighbourhood makes volumetric data easier to process with 3D convolutions   .\nOne drawback introduced by the predefined local neighborhood is the inaccuracy due to the constant resolution of the voxels, meaning that one voxel can represent several small structures. On the other hand,\npoint clouds have the advantage of not limiting the local resolution, although they come with their own sets of drawbacks.\nMainly, there are two problems in processing point clouds: the undefined local neighborhood and unorganized feature map.\nAiming at solving these issues,\nPointNet++ 3, PMP-Net 5, PointConv 7 and PointCNN \nemploy k𝑘k-nearest neighbor search to define a local neighborhood, while PointNet 2 and SoftPoolNet 3 adopt the pooling operation to achieve permutation invariant features.\nNotably, point cloud segmentation and classification were further improved by involving k𝑘k-nearest neighbor search to form local features in PointNet++3 compared to global features in PointNet 2.\nSeveral variations of PointNet 2 also succeeded in improving point cloud completion as demonstrated in FoldingNet , PCN [ref]45, MSN .\nOther methods such as SoftPoolNet 3 and GRNet  explicitly present local neighbourhood in sorted feature map and voxel space, respectively. This paper investigates grouping local features to improve the point cloud completion of objects and scenes.\nWe apply these operation in encoder-decoder architectures which iteratively uses a feature extraction operation with the help of a set of displacement vectors as part of our parametric model.\nIn addition, we also introduce a new pooling mechanism called neighbor-pooling, aimed at down-sampling the data in the encoder while, at the same time, preserving individual feature descriptors.\nFinally, we propose a new loss function that gradually reconstructs the target from the observable to the occluded regions.\nThe proposed approach is evaluated on both object completion dataset with ShapeNet , and semantic scene completion on NYU 5 and CompleteScanNet 6, attaining significant improvements producing high resolutions reconstruction with fine-grained details.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: a large portion of the whole geometry is typically missing due to self-occlusion and/or occlusion from its surrounding.\nTo solve this problem, geometric completion of scenes  7  and objects [ref]45    0 has emerged as a task that takes on a 2.5D/3D observation and fills out the occluded regions, as illustrated in Fig. 1.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
