      "content": "Paper Title: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning for LEO Constellations Integrated with HAPs Using Hybrid NOMA-OFDM\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile research in FL-SatCom is still in a nascent stage, a decent number of interesting studies have recently appeared  [ref]7    [ref]11 [ref]12         and have made appealing progress. Synchronous FL. In synchronous FL, the 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS} (e.g., GS) has to wait until all LEO satellites complete training and send their local models to 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS} when they sequentially come into its visible zone. Only after that, the 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS} will proceed to aggregate those received models into a global model and then start the next communication round by sending the global model back to all the satellites for retraining. In such synchronous FL, slow satellites or “stragglers”, who have limited visibility to the 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS}, will become the bottleneck of the training process, where fast satellites have to idly wait. Despite this, synchronous FL as a simple (and hence desirable) approach has been applied to LEO constellations in several studies. For instance,  adopted the traditional synchronous FL approach (i.e, FedAvg ) without any tailoring for LEO constellations and demonstrated that FL is more advantageous than a direct download of raw data to a centralized server for training. The study, however, did not take into account the satellite-GS visibility challenge which slows down the FL training processes significantly. To deal with this challenge, [ref]7 proposed an intra-orbit routing technique called FedISL specifically designed for FL-SatCom. It performs well when the 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS} is a GS situated either at the North Pole (NP) or a medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellite flying above the Equator (at an altitude of 20,000 km). In these cases, each satellite visits the 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS} at regular intervals, resulting in more frequent communication and hence faster convergence. However, when the 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS} is located at a different position, the convergence time increases significantly, taking several days instead of just a few hours.\nMoreover, NP is an ideal location which is often unavailable in practice, and MEO would incur considerable Doppler shifts. To address this limitation, FedHAP  introduces HAPs as a proxy of GS to LEO constellations without restriction on locations. However, the FL model still requires more than a day to converge due to the non-ideal 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS} locations. Lin et al.  proposed an approach to dynamically aggregate satellite models based on connection density, excluding stragglers in cases of sparse connections, and involving the collaboration of multiple GSs at distributed locations. However, ensuring model consistency at multiple GSs is nontrivial and incurs more overhead, and excluding straggler satellites can introduce bias in the global model towards frequently visible satellites. In , a clustering and edge selection approach is proposed, where a GS selects an LEO server, clusters neighboring LEO clients with good channel quality, and then selects satellites within each cluster to participate in the training process. However, this may result in a biased model toward satellites with good channel quality. The authors of [ref]11 proposed a decentralized learning paradigm, eliminating the need for a 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS}. They utilize intra- and inter-orbit ISLs with a traditional communication scheme like OFDM , attempting to address convergence speed; however, this approach still requires a higher data rate due to the Doppler shift among different orbits.\nMoreover, all the above studies evaluate their models on non-SatCom-related datasets, and the convergence time still takes long hours and days. Most recently, FedLEO [ref]12 enhances the FL convergence through the use of intra-plane model propagation and scheduling of sink satellites, and uses a real satellite dataset to test their model. On the other hand, it requires each satellite to run a scheduler to determine a sink satellite, leading to delays during model exchanges with the GS. Asynchronous FL. Unlike synchronous FL, asynchronous FL allows the 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS} to receive only a subset of the satellites’ (typically fast ones’) model updates to proceed to the next communication round. This mitigates the idleness problem in synchronous FL, but faces another problem called model staleness, where outdated models from straggler satellites will arrive in later communication rounds, potentially affecting the model convergence and performance adversely (e.g., FedAsync ). Razmi et al.  proposed FedSat, an asynchronous FL approach tailored for SatCom. FedSat adapts FedAvg  to an asynchronous setting, where it averages the received satellite models based on their visibility order, assuming regular satellite visits to the GS. In response to this ideal consideration, they proposed another work , FedSatSchedule, that considers the location of the GS can be anywhere. FedSatSchedule is developed to reduce model staleness by determining whether each satellite has sufficient visible time for downloading the global model, training a local model, and uploading it. Otherwise, the satellite will schedule uploading its local model for the next communication round, allowing it to train its local model during its “long” invisible period. However, FedSatSchedule has only limited improvement in efficiency, still requiring several days for an FL model to converge. The authors of  proposed another asynchronous FL approach, FedSpace, which stores satellite models into a buffer with a predicted size and reduces the weighting of stale models. On the other hand, this method requires each satellite to upload a small amount of its raw data to the GS in order to be used for scheduling the model aggregation, which is contrary to the FL principle of maintaining privacy by not sharing raw data. Wang et al.  proposed a graph-based routing and resource reservation algorithm aimed at optimizing the delay in FL model parameter transfer. The algorithm enhances a storage time-aggregated graph, enabling a joint representation of the satellite networks’ transmission, storage, and computing resources. AsyncFLEO  is a more recent asynchronous FL approach that offers a solution to the staleness challenge, where it first groups satellites from different orbits based on the similarity of their models, and then selects only fresh models from each group to include in the model aggregation. Outdated satellite models are only selected when it is the only model in a group and will be down-weighted during aggregation. Finally, Wu et al.  proposed FedGSM, which implements a compensation mechanism to mitigate gradient staleness. FedGSM utilizes the deterministic and time-varying topology of the orbits to counteract the negative impact of staleness. However, their approach still requires a long time for convergence. While considerable efforts have been made to accelerate the convergence of the FL-SatCom model and address the challenge of satellite-GS sporadic connectivity, no work has been proposed to formally address the issue of uploading large satellite ML models to the 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS} (e.g., GS, MEO, HAPs) within the satellite link budget limit and the sporadic short satellite visibility periods. In addition, most of the existing works rely on direct communication between the server (often a GS) and LEO satellites, not leveraging the potential benefits of utilizing HAPs in space to improve FL training. Moreover, balancing among orbits to mitigate bias was overlooked too. This work aims to fill these gaps.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: While research in FL-SatCom is still in a nascent stage, a decent number of interesting studies have recently appeared  [ref]7    [ref]11 [ref]12         and have made appealing progress.
