Reward-free exploration has been formalized by  for the tabular setting. Furthermore,  proposed a algorithm which has sample complexity 𝒪~​(poly​(H)​S2​A/ϵ2)~𝒪poly𝐻superscript𝑆2𝐴superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\mathrm{poly}(H)S^{2}A/\\epsilon^{2}) outputting ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-optimal policy for arbitrary number of reward functions. More recently,   proposes algorithm VI-Zero with sharp sample complexity of 𝒪~​(poly​(H)​log⁡(N)​S​A/ϵ2)~𝒪poly𝐻𝑁𝑆𝐴superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\mathrm{poly}(H)\\log(N)SA/\\epsilon^{2}) capable of handling N𝑁N fixed reward functions.   further provide reward-free learning results in the setting of linear function approximation, in particular,  guarantees to find the near-optimal policies for an arbitrary number of (linear) reward functions within a sample complexity of 𝒪~​(poly​(H)​dlin3/ϵ2)~𝒪poly𝐻superscriptsubscript𝑑lin3superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\mathrm{poly}(H)d_{\\mathrm{lin}}^{3}/\\epsilon^{2}). All results mentioned above are for scalar-valued MDPs. For the vector-valued MDPs (VMDPs), very recent work [ref]31 designs a reward-free algorithm with sample complexity guarantee 𝒪~​(poly​(H)​min⁡{d,S}​S​A/ϵ2)~𝒪poly𝐻𝑑𝑆𝑆𝐴superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\mathrm{poly}(H)\\min\\{d,S\\}SA/\\epsilon^{2}) in the tabular setting. Compared to [ref]31, our reward-free algorithms for VMDP is adapted from the VI-Zero algorithm presented in . Our algorithm achieves the same sample complexity as [ref]31 but allows arbitrary planning algorithms in the planning phase. Approachability and Constrained RL are two related tasks involving constraints. Inspired by Blackwell approachability , recent work of  introduces approachability task for VMDPs. However, the proposed algorithm does not have polynomial sample complexity guarantees. More recently,  gave a new algorithm for approachability for both VMDPs and vector-valued Markov games (VMGs).  provides regret bounds for the proposed algorithm resulting in sample complexity guarantees of 𝒪~​(poly​(H)​min⁡{d,S}​S​A/ϵ2)~𝒪poly𝐻𝑑𝑆𝑆𝐴superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\mathrm{poly}(H)\\min\\{d,S\\}SA/\\epsilon^{2}) for approachability in VMDPs and 𝒪~​(poly​(H)​min⁡{d,S}​S​A​B/ϵ2)~𝒪poly𝐻𝑑𝑆𝑆𝐴𝐵superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\mathrm{poly}(H)\\min\\{d,S\\}SAB/\\epsilon^{2}) for approachability in VMGs. Sample-efficient exploration in constrained reinforcement learning has been recently studied in a recent line of work by [ref]7   [ref]8 .\nAll these works are also limited to linear constraints except [ref]7 which extends their approach to general convex constraints achieving sample complexity of 𝒪~​(poly​(H)​d2​S2​A/ϵ2)~𝒪poly𝐻superscript𝑑2superscript𝑆2𝐴superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\mathrm{poly}(H)d^{2}S^{2}A/\\epsilon^{2}) . However, [ref]7 requires solving a large-scale convex optimization sub-problem. The best result for constrained RL with general convex constraints can be achieved by the approachability-based algorithm in  obtaining sample complexity of 𝒪~​(poly​(H)​min⁡{d,S}​S​A/ϵ2)~𝒪poly𝐻𝑑𝑆𝑆𝐴superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\mathrm{poly}(H)\\min\\{d,S\\}SA/\\epsilon^{2}). Technically, our meta-algorithm is based on the Fenchel’s duality, which is similar to . In contrast,  does not use reward-free RL, and is thus different from our results in terms of algorithmic approaches. Consequently,  does not reveal the deep connections between reward-free RL and constrained RL, which is one of the main contribution of this paper. In addition,  does not address the function approximation setting. Finally, we note that among all results mentioned above, only [ref]8 has considered models beyond tabular setting in the context of constrained RL. The model studied in [ref]8 is known as linear mixture MDPs which is different and incomparable to the linear MDP models considered in this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: Algorithm\nReward-free\nApproachability\nCMDP\n\nTabular\nWu et al.
