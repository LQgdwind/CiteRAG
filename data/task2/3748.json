      "content": "Paper Title: Explicit and Implicit Pattern Relation Analysis for Discovering Actionable Negative Sequences\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince each pattern Yi∈𝒴subscript𝑌𝑖𝒴Y_{i}\\in\\mathcal{Y} represents an ordered structure of NSP elements, the occurrence probability (also called explicit probability) of an NSP subset Y𝑌Y can be computed by a fixed k-size structured determinatal point process (k-SDPP) model , which captures the co-occurrence-based relationships between NSP elements and their formation into NSP patterns. The k-SDPP model captures the distribution of pattern subset Y⊆𝒴𝑌𝒴Y\\subseteq\\mathcal{Y} conditional on the event that subset Y𝑌Y has cardinality k𝑘k as follows. Here, Lesuperscript𝐿𝑒L^{e} is a positive semidefinite kernel, LYesubscriptsuperscript𝐿𝑒𝑌L^{e}_{Y} represents the restriction on Lesuperscript𝐿𝑒L^{e} to entries indexed by NSP subset Y𝑌Y , i.e., LYe≡[Li​je]𝒀𝒊,𝒀𝒋∈𝒴subscriptsuperscript𝐿𝑒𝑌subscriptdelimited-[]subscriptsuperscript𝐿𝑒𝑖𝑗subscript𝒀𝒊subscript𝒀𝒋𝒴L^{e}_{Y}\\equiv[L^{e}_{ij}]_{\\bm{Y_{i}},\\bm{Y_{j}}\\in\\mathcal{Y}}, and d​e​t​(LYe)𝑑𝑒𝑡subscriptsuperscript𝐿𝑒𝑌det(L^{e}_{Y}) denotes the determinant of LYesubscriptsuperscript𝐿𝑒𝑌L^{e}_{Y}. Following the design in , kernel Lesuperscript𝐿𝑒L^{e} can be rewritten as a Gram matrix: Le=BeT​Besuperscript𝐿𝑒superscriptsuperscript𝐵𝑒𝑇superscript𝐵𝑒L^{e}={B^{e}}^{T}B^{e}. Be∈R|E|×|𝒴|superscript𝐵𝑒superscript𝑅𝐸𝒴B^{e}\\in R^{|E|\\times|\\mathcal{Y}|} is the matrix where each column is a feature vector , describing the corresponding pattern in the NSP collection 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y}. Column Biesubscriptsuperscript𝐵𝑒𝑖B^{e}_{i} can be factorized as the production of an explicit pattern quality score qe​(𝒀𝒊)∈R+subscript𝑞𝑒subscript𝒀𝒊superscript𝑅q_{e}(\\bm{Y_{i}})\\in R^{+} and a normalized explicit pattern diversity feature vector ϕe​(𝒀𝒊)subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑒subscript𝒀𝒊\\phi_{e}(\\bm{Y_{i}}), ∥ϕe​(𝒀𝒊)∥=1delimited-∥∥subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑒subscript𝒀𝒊1\\lVert\\phi_{e}(\\bm{Y_{i}})\\rVert=1. Here, qe​(𝒀𝒊)∈R+subscript𝑞𝑒subscript𝒀𝒊superscript𝑅q_{e}(\\bm{Y_{i}})\\in R^{+} can be viewed as a non-negative measure of the explicit significance of pattern Yisubscript𝑌𝑖Y_{i}, and ϕe​(𝒀𝒊)T​ϕe​(𝒀𝒌)∈[−1,1]subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑒superscriptsubscript𝒀𝒊𝑇subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑒subscript𝒀𝒌11\\phi_{e}(\\bm{Y_{i}})^{T}\\phi_{e}(\\bm{Y_{k}})\\in[-1,1] as a signed measure of explicit similarity (diversity) between patterns Yisubscript𝑌𝑖Y_{i} and Yksubscript𝑌𝑘Y_{k}. Accordingly, the entries of kernel Lesuperscript𝐿𝑒L^{e} can be further decomposed as follows: Eq. (2) gives rise to a distribution , which places a higher weight on the NSP subsets that are composed of higher quality and more diverse NSP patterns. To efficiently define a DPP over the sequential NSP patterns, the explicit pattern quality score qe​(𝒀𝒊)subscript𝑞𝑒subscript𝒀𝒊q_{e}(\\bm{Y_{i}}) is multiplicatively decomposed as follows. We use a log-linear model to decompose it, which depends on the explicit quality of each element qe​(yij)subscript𝑞𝑒superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗q_{e}(y_{i}^{j}) and its element pair qe​(yij,yij+1)subscript𝑞𝑒superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗1q_{e}(y_{i}^{j},y_{i}^{j+1}) for two elements yijsuperscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗y_{i}^{j} and yij+1superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗1y_{i}^{j+1}. As NSP discovery is built on frequentist statistics, we specify the explicit quality of a pattern feature d𝑑d (corresponding to the element and element pair in the feature set) in terms of element and element pair frequencies in NSPs, i.e., qe​(∙)≡|{sd|sd∈D∧<∙>⊆sd}||D|q_{e}(\\centerdot)\\equiv\\frac{|\\{s_{d}|s_{d}\\in D\\wedge<\\centerdot>\\subseteq s_{d}\\}|}{|D|}. D𝐷D denotes the pattern set and sdsubscript𝑠𝑑s_{d} is an NSP sequence from dataset D𝐷D. Similarly, the normalized explicit pattern diversity feature vector ϕe​(𝒀𝒊)subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑒subscript𝒀𝒊\\phi_{e}(\\bm{Y_{i}}) of an NSP pattern Yisubscript𝑌𝑖Y_{i} is decomposed additively over the elements yijsuperscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗y_{i}^{j}: Here, N​o​r​m​(∙)𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚∙Norm(\\centerdot) guarantees that, for any pair of NSP patterns 𝒀𝒊subscript𝒀𝒊\\bm{Y_{i}} and 𝒀𝒌subscript𝒀𝒌\\bm{Y_{k}}, ϕe​(𝒀𝒊)T​ϕe​(𝒀𝒌)∈[−1,1]subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑒superscriptsubscript𝒀𝒊𝑇subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑒subscript𝒀𝒌11\\phi_{e}(\\bm{Y_{i}})^{T}\\phi_{e}(\\bm{Y_{k}})\\in[-1,1] is a signed measure of the similarity between these patterns. The diversity feature dke​(yij)∈ϕe​(yij)subscriptsuperscript𝑑𝑒𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑒superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗d^{e}_{k}(y_{i}^{j})\\in\\phi_{e}(y_{i}^{j}) is the k𝑘k-th component of vector ϕe​(yij)subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑒superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗\\phi_{e}(y_{i}^{j}). The k𝑘k-th component is identified by the explicit normalized element-wise mutual information (eNEMI) between NSP element yijsuperscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗y_{i}^{j} and other NSP elements Ek∈Esubscript𝐸𝑘𝐸E_{k}\\in E. eNEMI is adapted from the normalized point-wise mutual information (NPMI) . The explicit normalized element-wise mutual information (eNEMI) N​E​M​I​(yij,Ek)𝑁𝐸𝑀𝐼superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗subscript𝐸𝑘NEMI(y_{i}^{j},E_{k}) measures the ability to capture both linear and non-linear dependencies between element yijsuperscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗y_{i}^{j} and other NSP elements Ek∈Esubscript𝐸𝑘𝐸E_{k}\\in E, which is defined as follows:\n where h​(∙)=−l​o​g​p​(∙)ℎ∙𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑝∙h(\\centerdot)=-logp(\\centerdot), p​(yij)𝑝superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗p(y_{i}^{j}) and p​(Ek)𝑝subscript𝐸𝑘p(E_{k}) are the marginal probabilities of NSP elements yijsuperscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗y_{i}^{j} and Eksubscript𝐸𝑘E_{k} in graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}. p​(yij,Ek)𝑝superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗subscript𝐸𝑘p(y_{i}^{j},E_{k}) is the joint probability. Note that dke​(yij)∈[−1,1]subscriptsuperscript𝑑𝑒𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗11d^{e}_{k}(y_{i}^{j})\\in[-1,1], and some orientation values  are as follows: (1) when NSP elements yijsuperscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗y_{i}^{j} and Eksubscript𝐸𝑘E_{k} occur separately but never co-occur, they hold a negative dependence corresponding to non-co-occurrences between NSP elements, dke​(yij)=−1subscriptsuperscript𝑑𝑒𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗1d^{e}_{k}(y_{i}^{j})=-1; (2) when they are distributed under independence, dke​(yij)=0subscriptsuperscript𝑑𝑒𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗0d^{e}_{k}(y_{i}^{j})=0 as the numerator is 0; and (3) when they completely co-occur, they hold positive dependence corresponding to the full co-occurrences between NSP elements, dke​(yij)=+1subscriptsuperscript𝑑𝑒𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗1d^{e}_{k}(y_{i}^{j})=+1. Hence, ϕe​(yij)subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑒superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗\\phi_{e}(y_{i}^{j}) serves as an element dependence measure of yijsuperscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗y_{i}^{j} w.r.t. all other elements. Discovering NSP involves a huge search space and a high computational cost. The size of the NSP collection 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y} is always enormous   , which makes kernel Lesuperscript𝐿𝑒L^{e} too large and the inference on Lesuperscript𝐿𝑒L^{e} intractable. Accordingly, a dual representation of Lesuperscript𝐿𝑒L^{e}, i.e., Ce=Be​BeTsuperscript𝐶𝑒superscript𝐵𝑒superscriptsuperscript𝐵𝑒𝑇C^{e}={B^{e}}{{B^{e}}^{T}}, is constructed to represent the properties carried by kernel Lesuperscript𝐿𝑒L^{e} to enable efficient inference . Note that Ce∈R|E|×|E|superscript𝐶𝑒superscript𝑅𝐸𝐸C^{e}\\in R^{|E|\\times|E|} is a symmetric and positive semidefinite matrix, where typically |E|≪|𝒴|much-less-than𝐸𝒴|E|\\ll|\\mathcal{Y}|. Hence, Cesuperscript𝐶𝑒C^{e} is always much smaller in scale and less sensitive to a threshold than kernel Lesuperscript𝐿𝑒L^{e}. Accordingly, the dual representation Cesuperscript𝐶𝑒C^{e} of NSP Yisubscript𝑌𝑖Y_{i} in the NSP set 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y} can be factorized as follows through the DPP-based representations: The representation Cesuperscript𝐶𝑒C^{e} can be calculated by a second-order message passing algorithm 3 [ref]29. Once Cesuperscript𝐶𝑒C^{e} is computed, it can further be eigen-decomposed in the form of Ce=∑nλne​vne​vneTsuperscript𝐶𝑒subscript𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝜆𝑒𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝑣𝑒𝑛superscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑇C^{e}=\\sum\\nolimits_{n}\\lambda^{e}_{n}v^{e}_{n}{v^{e}_{n}}^{T} in time O​(|E|3)𝑂superscript𝐸3O({|E|}^{3}). We then obtain the eigenvalue/eigenvector pairs (λn,vn)Nvsubscriptsubscript𝜆𝑛subscript𝑣𝑛subscript𝑁𝑣{(\\lambda_{n},v_{n})}_{N_{v}} of representation Cesuperscript𝐶𝑒C^{e}, where Nvsubscript𝑁𝑣N_{v} is the number of eigenvalue/eigenvector pairs. As proved in , the non-zero eigenvalues of Cesuperscript𝐶𝑒C^{e} and Lesuperscript𝐿𝑒L^{e} are identical. If vnsubscript𝑣𝑛v_{n} is the n𝑛n-th eigenvector of Cesuperscript𝐶𝑒C^{e} then BeT​vnsuperscriptsuperscript𝐵𝑒𝑇subscript𝑣𝑛{B^{e}}^{T}v_{n} is the n𝑛n-th eigenvector of Lesuperscript𝐿𝑒L^{e}, which share the same eigenvalue λnesubscriptsuperscript𝜆𝑒𝑛\\lambda^{e}_{n}. That is, (λne,BeT​vne)Nvsubscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝜆𝑒𝑛superscriptsuperscript𝐵𝑒𝑇subscriptsuperscript𝑣𝑒𝑛subscript𝑁𝑣{(\\lambda^{e}_{n},{B^{e}}^{T}v^{e}_{n})}_{N_{v}} are the corresponding pairs of kernel Lesuperscript𝐿𝑒L^{e}, making Le=∑nλne​(BeT​vne)​(BeT​vne)Tsuperscript𝐿𝑒subscript𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝜆𝑒𝑛superscriptsuperscript𝐵𝑒𝑇subscriptsuperscript𝑣𝑒𝑛superscriptsuperscriptsuperscript𝐵𝑒𝑇subscriptsuperscript𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑇L^{e}=\\sum\\nolimits_{n}\\lambda^{e}_{n}{({B^{e}}^{T}v^{e}_{n})}{({B^{e}}^{T}{v^{e}_{n}})}^{T}. To efficiently select a subset of k𝑘k patterns, inspired by the mechanism of k-DPP , we formalize Pek​(Y)subscriptsuperscript𝑃𝑘𝑒𝑌P^{k}_{e}(Y) as follows: Here, J𝐽J is the index subset of (λne,BeT​vne)Nvsubscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝜆𝑒𝑛superscriptsuperscript𝐵𝑒𝑇subscriptsuperscript𝑣𝑒𝑛subscript𝑁𝑣{(\\lambda^{e}_{n},{B^{e}}^{T}v^{e}_{n})}_{N_{v}}.
