      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Homogeneous Modality Learning and Multi-Granularity Information Exploration for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisible-infrared person Re-ID task is proposed to achieve 24-hour continuous surveillance. In addition to conventional appearance discrepancy, it also suffers from the modality discrepancy originating from different wavelength ranges of spectrum cameras . To handle such cross-modality discrepancies, early works try to learn a modality-sharable feature representation using feature-level constraints     . They design novel classification and/or triplet losses for pointing at optimizing cross-modality samples. Specifically,  uses modality-sharable and modality-specific classifiers to learn identity information in the classifier level and introduce a collaborative ensemble\nlearning scheme to collaboratively optimize the feature learning with multiple classifiers.  propose a bi-directional top-ranking loss, which samples positive and negative pairs from different modalities and optimizes such cross-modality triplets with a bi-directional interactive iteration manner. More recently, some other works adopt adversarial training strategies to reduce the cross-modality distribution divergence in image-level [ref]30     [ref]46. For a instance, they transfer stylistic properties of visible images to their infrared counterpart, with an identity-preserving constraint  [ref]30 or cycle consistency  . However, due to the lack of paired cross-modality training data, GAN-based methods always involve much randomness, which may lead to identity inconsistency during the complicated adversarial training proces  . In contrast, our method proposes to exploit aligned grayscale modality space (AGM) to reduce the cross-modality distribution divergence in image-level. It is no longer the pattern of transfering A to B or B to A, but projecting A and B to C, where the space of C treats the different modality information equally.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: triplets with a bi-directional interactive iteration manner. More recently, some other works adopt adversarial training strategies to reduce the cross-modality distribution divergence in image-level [ref]30     [ref]46.
