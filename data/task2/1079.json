Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Metapath and Entity-Aware Graph Neural Network for Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare PEAGNN with several kinds of competitive baselines.\n\n1. NFM [ref]14 utilizes\nneural networks to enhance high-order feature\ninteractions with non-linearity. As suggested by\nHe et al. [ref]14, we apply one\nhidden layer neural network on input features.\n2. CFKG [ref]1 applies\nTransE  to learn\nheterogeneous node embedding and converts\nrecommendation to a link prediction problem.\n3. HeRec  extends the matrix factorization model with the joint learning of a set of embedding fusion functions.\n4. Metapath2Vec  utilizes a skip-gram model to update the node embeddings generataed by metapath-guided random walks. We then use a MLP to predict the matching score with the learned embeddings.\n5. NGCF [ref]37 integrates the user-item bipartite graph structure into the embedding process for\ncollaborative filtering.\n6. KGCN  exploits multi-hop proximity information with a receptive field to learn user preference.\n7. KGAT  incorporates high-order information by performing attentive embedding propagation with the learned entity attention on knowledge graph.\n8. Multi-GCCF  explicitly incorporates multiple\ngraphs in the embedding learning process. Multi-GCCF not\nonly models the high-order information but also integrates the\nproximal information of item-item and user-user paris.\n9. LGC  simplifies the design of GCN by maintaining only the neighborhood aggregation for\ncollaborative filtering.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: We compare PEAGNN with several kinds of competitive baselines.\n\n1.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
