      "content": "Paper Title: Temporal Difference Learning with Compressed Updates: Error-Feedback meets Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStochastic gradient descent (SGD) is at the heart of large-scale distributed machine learning paradigms such as federated learning (FL)¬†. In these settings, the task of training is distributed among several workers that exchange information over networks of limited bandwidth. While parallelization at such an immense scale helps to reduce the computational burden, it creates several other challenges: delays, asynchrony, and most importantly, a significant communication bottleneck. The popularity and success of SGD can be attributed in no small part to the fact that it is extremely robust to such deviations from ideal operating conditions. In fact, by now, there is a rich literature that analyzes the robustness of SGD to a host of structured perturbations that include lossy gradient-quantization¬†[ref]2 [ref]3 and sparsification¬†[ref]4 . For instance, SignSGD - a variant of SGD where each coordinate of the gradient is replaced by its sign - is extensively used to train deep neural networks¬† . Inspired by these findings, in this paper, we ask a different question: Are common reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms also robust to similar perturbations? Perhaps surprisingly, despite the recent surge of interest in multi-agent/federated RL, almost nothing is known about the above question. To fill this void, we initiate the study of a robustness theory for iterative RL algorithms with compressed update directions. We primarily focus on the problem of evaluating the value function associated with a fixed policy Œºùúá\\mu in a Markov decision process (MDP). Just as SGD is the workhorse of stochastic optimization, the classical temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm¬† for policy evaluation forms the core subroutine in a variety of decision-making problems for RL. In fact, in their book¬†, Sutton and Barto mention: ‚ÄúIf one had to identify one idea as central and novel to reinforcement learning, it would undoubtedly be temporal-difference (TD) learning.‚Äù Thus, it stands to reason that we center our investigation around a variant of the TD(0) learning algorithm with linear function approximation, where the TD(0) update direction is replaced by a compressed version of it. Moreover, to account for general biased compression operators (e.g., sign and Top-kùëòk), we couple this scheme with an error-compensation mechanism that retains memory of the past TD(0) update directions. Other than the robustness angle, our study of the above scheme is practically motivated by the need to design communication-efficient algorithms for the emerging paradigms of multi-agent RL (MARL) and federated RL (FRL). In existing works on these topics¬†0 1 2 3, agents either exchange models (parameters) or model-differentials, i.e., the gradient-like update directions, keeping their personal data (i.e., rewards, states, and actions) private. The algorithms we analyze are naturally compatible with these works. From a theoretical standpoint, the authors in¬†4 recently made some very interesting connections between the dynamics of SGD and TD learning algorithms. Building on these connections, the main message we convey with our work is: compressed TD learning algorithms are just as robust as their SGD counterparts, and exhibit similar convergence guarantees. Our specific contributions in this regard are as follows.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: from ideal operating conditions.
