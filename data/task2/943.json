Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Class-Wise Difficulty-Balanced Loss for Solving Class-Imbalance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMetric learning aims to learn an embedding function that can embed data to a\nfeature space where the inter-data relationships are preserved. Contrastive\nembedding [ref]26 is learned using paired data samples to minimize\nthe distance between the features of same class samples while maximizing the\ndistance between different class samples. Song et al. \nproposed a structured feature embedding based on positive and negative samples\npairs in the dataset. Triplet loss , on the other hand, uses\ntriplets instead of pairs, where one sample is considered the anchor. Metric\nlearning still faces the risk of learning embedding functions biased towards the\nmajority classes. Some recent works (e.g., OLTR ) have also tried to\ntransfer knowledge from the majority classes to the minority classes either by\nmeta learning [ref]13 or by adding an external memory module\n. Even though OLTR  performs well for long-tailed\nclassification, as pointed out by [ref]28, their design of external\nmemory modules might be a non-trivial and expensive task.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Metric learning aims to learn an embedding function that can embed data to a\nfeature space where the inter-data relationships are preserved.
