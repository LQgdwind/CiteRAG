      "content": "Paper Title: On the eigenvector bias of Fourier feature networks: From regression to solving multi-scale PDEs with physics-informed neural networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFollowing the original formulation of Tancik et al. , a random Fourier mapping γ𝛾\\gamma is defined as where each entry in 𝑩∈ℝm×d𝑩superscriptℝ𝑚𝑑\\bm{B}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times d}\nis sampled from a Gaussian distribution 𝒩​(0,σ2)𝒩0superscript𝜎2\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2}) and σ>0𝜎0\\sigma>0 is a user-specified hyper-parameter.\nThen, a Fourier features network  can be simply constructed using a random Fourier features mapping γ𝛾\\gamma as a coordinate embedding of the inputs,\nfollowed by a conventional fully-connected neural network . As shown in , such a simple method can mitigate the pathology of spectral bias and enable networks to learn high frequencies more effectively, which can significantly improve the effectiveness of neural networks across many tasks including image regression, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), etc. In order to explore the deeper reasoning and understand the inner mechanisms behind this simple technique, we consider a two-layer bias-free neural network with Fourier features, i.e. where x∈ℝd𝑥superscriptℝ𝑑x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} is the input, W∈ℝ1×2​m𝑊superscriptℝ12𝑚W\\in\\mathbb{R}^{1\\times 2m} is the weight matrix and 𝑩=[𝒃1,𝒃2,…,𝒃m]T∈ℝm×d𝑩superscriptsubscript𝒃1subscript𝒃2…subscript𝒃𝑚𝑇superscriptℝ𝑚𝑑\\bm{B}=[\\bm{b}_{1},\\bm{b}_{2},\\dots,\\bm{b}_{m}]^{T}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times d} are sampled from Gaussian 𝒩​(0,σ2)𝒩0superscript𝜎2\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2}). Let {𝒙i}i=1Nsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝒙𝑖𝑖1𝑁\\{\\bm{x}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N} be input points in a compact domain C𝐶C . Then, according to equation 3.1, the neural tangent kernel 𝑲𝑲\\bm{K} is given as To study the eigen-system of the kernel 𝑲𝑲\\bm{K}, we consider the limit of 𝑲𝑲\\bm{K} as the number of points goes to infinity. In this limit the eigensystem of 𝑲𝑲\\bm{K} approaches the eigen-system of the kernel function K​(𝒙,𝒙′)𝐾𝒙superscript𝒙′K(\\bm{x},\\bm{x}^{\\prime}) which satisfies the following equation  where K​(𝒙,𝒙′)=1m​∑k=1mcos⁡(𝒃kT​(𝒙−𝒙′))𝐾𝒙superscript𝒙′1𝑚superscriptsubscript𝑘1𝑚superscriptsubscript𝒃𝑘𝑇𝒙superscript𝒙′K({\\bm{x}},{\\bm{x}}^{\\prime})=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{k=1}^{m}\\cos(\\bm{b}_{k}^{T}(\\bm{x}-\\bm{x}^{\\prime})).\nNote that the kernel K𝐾K induces an Hilbert-Schdmit integral operator TK:L2​(C)→L2​(C):subscript𝑇𝐾→superscript𝐿2𝐶superscript𝐿2𝐶T_{K}:L^{2}(C)\\rightarrow L^{2}(C) Also note that TKsubscript𝑇𝐾T_{K}\nis a compact and self-adjoint operator, which implies that the eigenfunctions exist and all eigenvalues are real.\nThe following lemma reveals that eigenfunctions are indeed solutions to a eigenvalue problem. For the kernel 𝐊​(𝐱,𝐱′)=1m​∑k=1mcos⁡(𝐛kT​(𝐱−𝐱′))𝐊𝐱superscript𝐱′1𝑚superscriptsubscript𝑘1𝑚superscriptsubscript𝐛𝑘𝑇𝐱superscript𝐱′\\bm{K}(\\bm{x},\\bm{x}^{\\prime})=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{k=1}^{m}\\cos(\\bm{b}_{k}^{T}(\\bm{x}-\\bm{x}^{\\prime})), the eigenfunction g​(𝐱)𝑔𝐱g(\\bm{x}) corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues satisfying the the following equation The proof can be found in Appendix B.\n∎ If we consider the Laplacian on the sphere Sd−1superscript𝑆𝑑1S^{d-1} and assume that 1m​‖𝑩‖22=l​(l+d−2)1𝑚superscriptsubscriptnorm𝑩22𝑙𝑙𝑑2\\frac{1}{m}\\|\\bm{B}\\|_{2}^{2}=l(l+d-2) for some positive integer l𝑙l, then g​(𝒙)𝑔𝒙g(\\bm{x}) are corresponding homogeneous harmonic polynomials of degree l𝑙l . However, in general, directly solving this eigenvalue problem on a complex domain is intractable. To obtain a better understanding of the behavior of the eigenfunctions and the corresponding eigenvalues,\nlet us consider a much simper case by setting d=1𝑑1d=1 and m=1𝑚1m=1. Specifically, we take the input x∈ℝ𝑥ℝx\\in\\mathbb{R}, the compact domain C=[ref]0 𝐶01C=[ref]0  and the Fourier features\n𝑩=b∈ℝ𝑩𝑏ℝ\\bm{B}=b\\in\\mathbb{R} are sampled from a Gaussian distribution ℕ​(0,σ2)ℕ0superscript𝜎2\\mathbb{N}(0,\\sigma^{2}). Then\nthe kernel function is given by In this case, we can compute the exact expression of the eigenfunctions and their eigenvalues, as summarized in the Proposition 3.2 below. For the kernel function K​(x,x′)=cos⁡(b​(x−x′))𝐾𝑥superscript𝑥′𝑏𝑥superscript𝑥′K(x,x^{\\prime})=\\cos(b(x-x^{\\prime})), the non-zero eigenvalues are given by The corresponding eigenfunctions g​(x)𝑔𝑥g(x) must have the form of where C1subscript𝐶1C_{1} and C2subscript𝐶2C_{2} are some constants. The proof can be found in Appendix C.\n∎ From this Proposition, we immediately observe that\nthe frequency of the eigenfunctions is determined by b𝑏b and the gap between the eigenvalues is sin⁡bb𝑏𝑏\\frac{\\sin b}{b}. Besides, recall that b𝑏b is sampled from a Gaussian distribution 𝒩​(0,σ2)𝒩0superscript𝜎2\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2}), which implies that the larger the σ𝜎\\sigma we choose, the higher the probability that b𝑏b takes greater magnitude. Therefore, we may conclude that, for this toy model, large σ𝜎\\sigma would lead to high frequency eigenfunctions, as well as narrow eigenvalues gaps. As a result, Fourier features may resolve the issue of spectral bias and enable faster\nconvergence to high-frequency components of a target function. Intuitively, we would expect that general fully-connected neural networks with Fourier features exhibit similar behaviors as our toy example. However, it is extremely difficult to calculate the the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for generic cases. Therefore, here we attempt to empirically verify our analysis by numerical experiments. To this end, we first initialize two Fourier feature embeddings with σ=1,10𝜎110\\sigma=1,10, respectively,\nand apply them to a one-dimensional input coordinate before passing them through a 4-layer fully-connected neural network with 100 units per hidden layer. Then, we study the\nNTK eigendecomposition of these two networks at initialization. Figure 2 and figure 3 show the visualizations of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the NTK computed using 100100100 equally spaced points in [ref]0 01[ref]0  for σ=1,10𝜎110\\sigma=1,10, respectively. One can observe that the eigenvalues corresponding to the Fourier features with σ=10𝜎10\\sigma=10 shrink much slower than the ones corresponding to σ=1𝜎1\\sigma=1. Moreover, comparing the eigenvectors for different σ𝜎\\sigma, it is easy to see that σ=10𝜎10\\sigma=10 results in higher frequency eigenvectors than σ=1𝜎1\\sigma=1.\nThis conclusion is further clarified by figure 4, which depicts the frequency content of the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, for different σ∈ 𝜎150\\sigma\\in . All these observations are consistent with Proposition 3.2 and the analysis presented for the toy network with Fourier features. Next, let us consider a simple one-dimensional target function of the form and generate the training data {xi,f​(xi)}i=1100superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑓subscript𝑥𝑖𝑖1100\\{x_{i},f(x_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{100} where xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} are evenly spaced in the unit interval. We proceed by training these two networks to fit the target function using the Adam optimizer  with default settings for 1,00010001,000 and 10,0001000010,000 epochs respectively.\nThe results for σ=1,10𝜎110\\sigma=1,10 are summarized in figure 5\nand figure 6, respectively. It can be observed that low frequencies are learned first for σ=1𝜎1\\sigma=1, which is pretty similar to the behavior of conventional fully-connected neural networks, commonly referred to as “spectral bias” [ref]30.\nNotice, however, that it is high frequencies that are learned first for σ=10𝜎10\\sigma=10. As shown in figure 2\nand figure 3, we already know that the value of σ𝜎\\sigma determines the frequency of eigenvectors of the NTK. Therefore, this observation highly suggests that “spectral bias” actually corresponds to “eigenvector bias”, in the sense that the leading eigenvectors corresponding to large eigenvalues of the NTK determine the frequencies which the network is biased to learn first. Furthermore, one may note that the distribution of the eigenvalues corresponding to σ=1𝜎1\\sigma=1 moves “outward” during training. From our experience, the movement of the eigenvalue distribution results in the movement of its NTK, as well as the parameters of the network during training.\nAs shown in figure 5(b)), the parameters of the network barely move after a rapid change in the first few hundred epochs.\nThis indicates that the network initialization is not suitable to fit the given target function because the parameters of the network have to move very far from initialization in order to reach a reasonable local minimum. In contrast, the distribution of the the eigenvalues corresponding to σ=10𝜎10\\sigma=10 almost keeps the NTK spectrum fixed during training. Accordingly, in the middle panel of figure 6(b), similar behavior can be observed, but the relative change of the parameters for case of σ=10𝜎10\\sigma=10 is much less than the case of σ=1𝜎1\\sigma=1.\nThis suggests that the initialization of the network is “good” and desirable local minima exist in the vicinity of the parameter initialization in the corresponding loss landscape.\nAs shown in the top right panels of figure 5 and figure 6, the relative L2superscript𝐿2L^{2} prediction error corresponding to σ=10𝜎10\\sigma=10 decreases much faster than the relative L2superscript𝐿2L^{2} error corresponding to σ=1𝜎1\\sigma=1. Finally, it is worth emphasizing that Fourier feature mappings initialized by large σ𝜎\\sigma do not always benefit the network, as too large value of σ𝜎\\sigma may cause over-fitting. To demonstrate this point, we initialize a Fourier feature mapping with σ=10𝜎10\\sigma=10 and pass it through the same fully-connected network. We now consider f​(x)=sin⁡π​x+sin⁡(2​π​x)𝑓𝑥𝜋𝑥2𝜋𝑥f(x)=\\sin{\\pi x}+\\sin(2\\pi x) as the ground truth target function, from which 202020 points are uniformly sampled as training data. Then we train the network to fit the target function using the Adam optimizer with default settings for 1,00010001,000 epochs. As shown in figure 7, although all training data pairs are perfectly approximated and the training error is very small, the network interpolates the training data with high frequency oscillations, and thus fails to correctly recover the target function. One possible explanation is that\nthe neural network approximation tends to exhibit similar frequencies as the leading eigenvectors of its NTK.\nTherefore, choosing an appropriate σ𝜎\\sigma such that the frequency of the leading NTK eigenvectors agrees with the frequency of the target function plays an important role in the network performance, which not only accelerates the convergence speed, but also increases the prediction accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: the eigenfunctions and the corresponding eigenvalues,\nlet us consider a much simper case by setting d=1𝑑1d=1 and m=1𝑚1m=1.
