      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Learning-Based Multiband Signal Fusion for 3-D SAR Super-Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe objective of multiband signal fusion is to impute the bandwidth between the subbands (interpolating between the subbands or extrapolating the missing samples) in the k𝑘k-domain to acquire the ideal full-band signal shown in Fig. 2b, where the dotted portion represents the signal in the frequency gap.\nMethods for recovering the missing wavenumber domain data from Nksubscript𝑁𝑘N_{k} to N~−1~𝑁1\\tilde{N}-1 apply MUSIC  or MPA   to estimate the signal poles in an all-pole model.\nHowever, these approaches assume that the estimated model order of s1​(⋅)subscript𝑠1⋅s_{1}(\\cdot) and s2​(⋅)subscript𝑠2⋅s_{2}(\\cdot), N^t≈Ntsubscript^𝑁𝑡subscript𝑁𝑡\\hat{N}_{t}\\approx N_{t}, is small compared to Nksubscript𝑁𝑘N_{k}.\nFrom the analysis in , N^tsubscript^𝑁𝑡\\hat{N}_{t}, the estimated number of targets in the scene, must be chosen such that N^t<round​(Nk/3)subscript^𝑁𝑡roundsubscript𝑁𝑘3\\hat{N}_{t}<\\text{round}(N_{k}/3) for the MPA .\nAfter the N^tsubscript^𝑁𝑡\\hat{N}_{t} signal poles and coefficients are computed, the missing samples can be estimated.\nHowever, high-resolution near-field SAR often requires imaging of intricate, continuous objects modeled by thousands or millions of point scatterers, or Nt≫Nkmuch-greater-thansubscript𝑁𝑡subscript𝑁𝑘N_{t}\\gg N_{k}  .\nAs a result, traditional approaches such as the MPA assume simplistic targets, thereby neglecting high-frequency features of the target, and are unable to faithfully recover the multiband signals. For clarity in the remainder of this paper, we propose new terminology to describe the spectral composition of radar target scenes based on the portion of the baseband bandwidth occupied by the reflected signal.\nA target consisting of fewer reflectors than the number of frequency samples (Nt<Nk)subscript𝑁𝑡subscript𝑁𝑘(N_{t}<N_{k}) over the specified frequency range has a low-bandwidth relative to the bandwidth of the system.\nLow-bandwidth targets have a low model order and a low-rank sample covariance matrix, allowing conventional algorithms to adequately approximate signal poles and coefficients.\nIn contrast, a target consisting of a large number of reflectors relative to the frequency sampling (Nt≫Nk)much-greater-thansubscript𝑁𝑡subscript𝑁𝑘(N_{t}\\gg N_{k}) is a high-bandwidth target, which is typical in most security and industrial applications of near-field SAR imaging.\nHigh-bandwidth targets contain intricate, high-frequency spatial features and have not been addressed for multiband signal fusion in previous studies. To illustrate this phenomenon, we consider two cases: (1) a low-bandwidth target consisting of 3 point reflectors and (2) a 3-D model of a rectangle with various cutout shapes to constitute a high-bandwidth target, as shown in the first and second rows of Fig. 3, respectively.\nAll images are reconstructed using the RMA  [ref]32   with the SAR scanning parameters detailed in Section 5.1.3.\nThe MFT 0 is applied to fuse the multiband data, yielding the images in the left column (Fig. 3a).\nAs expected, since the MFT does not account for the frequency gap between the subbands, increased sidelobes are observed along the z𝑧z-direction.\nHowever, the quality of images recovered using the MPA  varies significantly.\nFor the simple low-bandwidth target in the top row (Nt=3,Nk=64)formulae-sequencesubscript𝑁𝑡3subscript𝑁𝑘64(N_{t}=3,N_{k}=64), the MPA recovers each point with minimal undesirable sidelobes compared to the MFT.\nHowever, although its performance is better than the MFT, the MPA is plagued by considerable degradation for the high-bandwidth target, where Ntsubscript𝑁𝑡N_{t} is on the order of thousands and Nt≫Nkmuch-greater-thansubscript𝑁𝑡subscript𝑁𝑘N_{t}\\gg N_{k}, as the high-bandwidth features of the target are not adequately modeled by the MPA.\nFor an equitable comparison, a parallelized GPU implementation of the MPA is employed  .\nHence, the computation time required for the GPU-implemented MPA is still 1.6 h for this example, deeming it unfit for many applications demanding rapid imaging, such as packing and security screening.\nBy comparison, the MFT and k​R𝑘𝑅kR-Net boast computation times of 5.2 s and 12.5 s, respectively, enabling many common mmWave imaging solutions.\nIn the right column (Fig. 3c), the imaging results obtained using the proposed k​R𝑘𝑅kR-Net demonstrate robustness for both targets by achieving focusing performance comparable to the ideal, full-band scenario.\nNotably, the intricate features of the high-bandwidth target are retained, and the resolution in the z𝑧z-direction is significantly improved compared with the MFT and MPA. Multiband signal fusion can be posed as a spectral super-resolution/restoration problem in the R𝑅R-domain, the dual to imputation in the k𝑘k-domain.\nAs shown in Figs. 2c and 2d, R𝑅R-domain super-resolution of the Ntsubscript𝑁𝑡N_{t} peaks corresponds to imputation of the full bandwidth [ref]35.\nDeep learning-based solutions have proven successful in similar spectral-enhancement problems on radar images 4 5 6 7 8 and multisinusoidal line spectra 3 4, achieving resolutions exceeding the theoretical limitations.\nHowever, data-driven approaches have not been applied to multiband signals to achieve joint k𝑘k-domain imputation and R𝑅R-domain super-resolution.\nBecause the multiband fusion problem has distinct features in the k𝑘k-domain and R𝑅R-domain, we propose a hybrid approach that operates in both domains.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: 3-D model of a rectangle with various cutout shapes to constitute a high-bandwidth target, as shown in the first and second rows of Fig. 3, respectively.\nAll images are reconstructed using the RMA  [ref]32   with the SAR scanning parameters detailed in Section 5.1.3.\nThe MFT 0 is applied to fuse the multiband data, yielding the images in the left column (Fig. 3a).\nAs expected, since the MFT\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
