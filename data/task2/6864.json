A Multi-Objective Optimization Problem (MOP) involves determining the set of optimal compromises when no specific solution can optimize all objectives simultaneously. To gain a deeper understanding of the Multi-objective optimization problems, we recommend  and .\nMost of the MOO algorithms handle optimization problems using approaches like evolutionary algorithms  . scalarization methods  , set-oriented techniques [ref]43 , and gradient-based approaches .\nIn this work, we focus on scalarization-based algorithms, that allow for preferences in MOO . Users preferences are integrated by assigning corresponding weights (importance) to each objective. While linear scalarization algorithms struggle to find optimal solutions in non-convex Pareto front cases, in Reinforcement Learning, recommend the Weighted Chebyshev scalarization approach in a Multi-Objective Q-learning framework. This scalarization method uses the Chebyshev distance metric to minimize the distance between the objective functions and a given reference point.\n solved multi-objective infinite-dimenisonal parameter optimization problems using the Pascoletti-Serafini (PS) scalarization approach. As in our work, the obtained scalar optimization problems are solved using the Augmented Lagrangian method.\nIn , it has been proved that this PS scalarization approach is equivalent to the WC scalarization, where a variation of the weights and the reference point in WC correspond respectively to a variation of the direction and the reference point in the PS method.\nTo address the inflexibility of the PS scalarizationâ€™s constraints, [ref]1 revised a modified PS scalarization algorithm. Nevertheless, for complex MOO problems, the suggested modified PS scalarization algorithm has yet to be tested.\nThese methods lead to the identification of the Pareto set, where each Pareto optimal point is obtained under a different choice of the scalarization parameter.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: optimization problems, we recommend  and .\nMost of the MOO algorithms handle optimization problems using approaches like evolutionary algorithms  . scalarization methods  , set-oriented techniques [ref]43 , and gradient-based approaches .\nIn this work, we focus on scalarization-based algorithms, that allow for preferences in MOO .
