      "content": "Paper Title: Interpretable Stochastic Model Predictive Control using Distributional Reinforced Estimation for Quadrotor Tracking Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAccurate trajectory tracking for autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), such as quadrotors, is necessary for maintaining autonomy. Although industrial applications of autonomous UAVs, such as commercial deliveries, search-and-rescue  and wireless power transfer , have attracted much attention in recent years, precisely tracking high-speed and high-acceleration UAV trajectories is an extremely challenging control problem, particularly in unknown and dynamic environments with unpredictable aerodynamic forces. To achieve safe, precise and reliable quadrotor trajectory tracking, there are two main problems that need to be solved: How can we achieve robust and feasible estimation (or modelling) of the aerodynamic effects on quadrotors in complex dynamic environments? And; How can the whole control framework be integrated with aerodynamic effect estimation to solve the uncertainties and disturbances while tracking trajectory references precisely and reliably? Previous work has shown that the primary source of uncertainties are aerodynamic effects deriving from drag forces and moment variations caused by the rotors and the fuselage [ref]3. Prominent aerodynamic effects appear at flight speeds of 5 m‚Äãs‚àí1ùëösuperscriptùë†1ms^{-1} in wind tunnel experiments by . These effects acting on quadrotors are chaotic and hard to model directly, as they are generated from a combination of the individual propellers and airframe , turbulent effects caused by rotor‚Äìrotor and airframe‚Äìrotor interactions , and the propagation of other turbulence . Most current approaches to quadrotor trajectory tracking treat aerodynamic effects as simple external disturbances, and do not account for higher-order effects or attempt to deviate from a determined plan   0. While these solutions are efficient and feasible for lightweight on-board computers, aggressive maneuvers at high speed, e.g., greater than 5 m‚Äãs‚àí1ùëösuperscriptùë†1ms^{-1}, introduce large positional and attitude tracking errors. Recent data-driven approaches, such as Gaussian Processes (GP) [ref]3 1 and neural networks 2 combined with Model Predictive Control (MPC), show accurate modelling of aerodynamic effects. However, due to the nonparametric nature of GP, the GP-based approaches perform poorly in complex environments - where large datasets contain drastic changes in wind speed and heading. In these instances, learning-based (neural networks) approaches perform better than those GP-based approaches 3. Achieving adaptability and robustness in complex environments is still challenging, however, primarily because training datasets are collected from simulated platforms and real-world historical records that do not fully describe the complex environments. In comparison to existing data-driven approaches, Reinforcement Learning (RL), an interactive learning process, is able to learn complex and changeable disturbances - i.e., the errors between the true and estimated values - using much less model information 4. The key challenge of most existing RL approaches 5 is that policy optimization biases toward actions with high variance value estimates, since some of these values will be overestimated by random chance 6. In risk-sensitive or safety-critical applications such as autonomous quadrotor navigation these actions should be avoided. Recent work on distributional RL 7 was proposed to approximate and parameterize the entire distribution of future rewards, instead of the expected value. Distributional RL algorithms have been operated to achieve advanced results on continuous control domains 8. In princple, they provide more complete and richer value-distribution information to enable a more stable learning process 7. Previous distributional RL algorithms parameterize the policy value distribution in different ways, including canonical return atoms 7, the expectiles 9, the moments 0, and the quantiles 1 2. The quantile approach is especially suitable for autonomous UAV trajectory tracking due to its risk-sensitive policy optimization. Robust MPC for tracking control of uncertain systems like quadrotors is rapidly developing thanks to advances in hardware and algorithmic efficiency 3. The robust control approach enables a ‚Äòworst case‚Äô formulation to analyze the stability and performance of a system under bounded uncertainties and disturbances 4. However, with consideration of the uncertainties in real-world scenarios, such worst-case design renders the optimal control actions inherently inadequate and overly conservative in practise 5 6. To avoid the conservatism of the worst case design, Stochastic MPC (SMPC) 7 uses the probabilistic descriptions, such as stochastic constraints (also called chance constraints), to predict probability distributions of system states within acceptable levels of risk in the receding-horizon optimization 8. The core challenges for SMPC include: 1) optimizing the feedback control laws over arbitrary nonlinear functions 9; 2) the chance constraints are non-convex and intractable 6 ; and 3) the computational complexity will grow dramatically as more uncertainties are added. To address the first challenge, one solution is to use affine parameterization of the control policy over finite horizons. However, this approach cannot guarantee convexity, i.e., the second challenge, where the policy set may still be convex . Another solution is an Affine Disturbance Feedback (ADF) control parameterization, proposed in . This ADF control parameterization can address the first two challenges, which are optimizing the dynamic function and guaranteeing the decision variables to be convex, respectively. However, the main weakness is that the computational complexity grows quadratically with the prediction horizon, i.e., the third challenge. To overcome this difficulty, a Simplified Affine Disturbance Feedback (SADF) proposed in , where the SADF is equivalent to ADF but a finite-horizon optimization can be computed more efficiently using CasADi , a nonlinear MPC solver.  achieve good results by implementing SADF with zero-mean disturbance, however it is unclear how the SADF would perform on systems with non-zero-mean disturbances, such as a quadrotor. To address the two stated issues, we propose Quantile-approximation-based Distributional Reinforced-Disturbance-estimation for Stochastic MPC (QuaDRED-SMPC), a systematic, safe and feasible quadrotor trajectory tracking framework for use with high variance aerodynamic effects. The details are as follows: Aerodynamic Disturbance Estimator: a Quantile-approximation-based Distributional Reinforced-disturbance-estimator (QuaDRED), described by Algorithm¬†2, is proposed for aerodynamic disturbance estimation.\nQuaDRED builds upon prior QR-DQN 1 and QUOTA 2 insofar as QuaDRED is a quantile-approximated distributional RL which uses a set of quantiles to approximate the full value distribution. In Section IV-A, theoretical guarantees on convergence of the QuaDRED are provided based on policy evaluation (Proposition 3) and policy improvement (Proposition 4), respectively. Trajectory Tracker: Similar to , a Simplified Affine Disturbance Feedback (SADF) is used for control parameterization in SMPC (Algorithm¬†1), where the convexity can be guaranteed in this process  and computational complexity can be reduced. Different from prior work assuming zero mean disturbance, we consider the control performance and stability under non-zero-mean disturbance. We use an Input-to-State Stability (ISS)  property to find conditions that imply stability and convergence of the tracker. The QuaDRED-SMPC framework is proposed to track quadrotor trajectory accurately under high variance aerodynamic effects. The overall control framework is shown in Fig.¬†1. In Section IV-B, the closed-loop stability of the QuaDRED-SMPC framework is demonstrated under Lipschitz Lyapunov function . Our contributions can be summarized as follows: QuaDRED, a distributional RL with quantile approximation that can sufficiently estimate variable aerodynamic disturbances. In the cases tested, we show that QuaDRED outperforms traditional RL, such as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) 5, and prior Distributional RL approaches, such as C51 7. The integration of a trajectory tracker with an aerodynamic disturbance estimator, a quadrotor trajectory tracking framework that integrates QuaDRED into a stochastic optimal control problem. Convergence and stability guarantees: mathematical proofs are provided for the convergence of distributional-RL-based estimator, and the closed-loop stability of stochastic-MPC-based tracker with consideration of non-zero-mean and bounded disturbances.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: precisely and reliably?
