      "content": "Paper Title: Eigenstripping, Spectral Decay, and Edge-Expansion on Posets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRandom walks on high dimensional expanders (HDX) have been the object of intense study in theoretical computer science in recent years. Starting with their original formulation by Kaufman and Mass , a series of works on the spectral structure of these walks  [ref]3  led to significant breakthroughs in approximate sampling       0 1 2 3, CSP-approximation 4 5, error-correcting codes 6 7, agreement testing 8 9 0, and more. Most of these works focus on the structure of expansion in hypergraphs (typically called simplicial complexes in the HDX literature). On the other hand, it has become increasingly clear that hypergraphs are not always the right tool for the job—recent breakthroughs in locally testable 1 and quantum LDPC codes 2 3 4, for instance, all rely crucially on cubical structure not seen in hypergraphs, while many agreement testing results like the proof of the 2-2 Games Conjecture 5 rely crucially on linear algebraic rather than simplicial structure. In this work, we study a generalized notion of high dimensional expansion on partially ordered sets (posets) introduced by Dikstein, Dinur, Filmus, and Harsha (DDFH) [ref]3 called expanding posets (eposets). Random walks on eposets capture a broad range of important structures beyond their hypergraph analogs, including natural sparsifications of the Grassmann graphs that recently proved crucial to the resolution of the 2-2 Games Conjecture 5 6 7 8 9 . DDFH’s notion of eposets is a global definition of high dimensional expansion based on a relaxation of Stanley’s  sequentially differential posets, a definition originally capturing both the Grassmanian and complete simplicial complex.\nMore recently, Kaufman and Tessler (KT) [ref]32 have extended the study of eposets in two important aspects. First, in contrast to DDFH’s original global definition, KT introduced the local-to-global study of high dimensional expansion in eposets. Second, they identified regularity as a key parameter controlling expansion. In particular, the authors showed strengthened local-to-global theorems for strongly regular posets like the Grassmann, giving the first general formulation for characterizing expansion based on an eposet’s underlying architecture. While analysis of the second eigenvalue is certainly an important consideration (e.g. for mixing applications), a deeper understanding of the spectral structure of eposets is required for applications like the proof of the 2-2 Games Conjecture. As such, our main focus in this work lies in characterizing the spectral and combinatorial behavior of random walks on eposets beyond the second eigenvalue. Strengthening DDFH and recent work of Bafna, Hopkins, Kaufman, and Lovett (BHKL) 5, we prove that at a coarse level (walks on) eposets indeed exhibit the same spectral and combinatorial characteristics as expanding hypergraphs (e.g. spectral stripping, expansion of pseudorandom sets). On the other hand, as in KT, we show that the finer-grained properties of these objects are actually controlled by the underlying poset’s regularity, including the rate of decay of the spectrum and combinatorial expansion of associated random walks. This gives a stronger separation between structures like hypergraphs with weak (linear) eigenvalue decay, and Grassmann-based eposets with strong (exponential) eigenvalue decay (a crucial property in the proof of the 2-2 Games Conjecture 5). In slightly more detail, we show that all eposets exhibit a behaviour called “eigenstripping”  [ref]3 5: the spectrum of any associated random walk concentrates around a few unique approximate eigenvalues. Moreover, the approximate eigenvalues of walks on eposets are tightly controlled by the poset architecture’s regularity111We will additionally assume a slightly stronger condition introduced in KT [ref]32 called middle regularity throughout. See Section 2.1 for details. R​(j,i)𝑅𝑗𝑖R(j,i), which denotes the total number of rank-i𝑖i elements222We consider regular graded posets, where each element has a corresponding rank. In a hypergraph, for instance, rank is given by the size of a set, while in the Grassmann poset it is given by subspace dimension. less than any fixed rank-j𝑗j element (see Section 1.1 for standard definitions). For simplicity, we specialize our result below to the popular “lower” or “down-up” walk (this simply corresponds to taking a random step down and back up the poset, again see Section 1.1); a more involved version holds for higher order random walks in full generality. The spectrum of the lower walk U​D𝑈𝐷UD on a k𝑘k-dimensional γ𝛾\\gamma-eposet is concentrated in (k+1)𝑘1(k+1) strips: where the approximate eigenvalues λi​(U​D)subscript𝜆𝑖𝑈𝐷\\lambda_{i}(UD) are determined by the poset’s regularity: Theorem 1.1 generalizes and tightens recent work on expanding hypergraphs of BHKL [15, Theorem 2.2] (which itself extended a number of earlier works on the topic  [ref]3 4). Additionally, our result on the connection between regularity and approximate eigenvalues generalizes the work of KT [ref]32, who show an analogous result for λ2subscript𝜆2\\lambda_{2}. Theorem 1.1 reveals a stark contrast between the spectral behavior of eposets with different regularity parameters. As a prototypical example, consider the case of hypergraphs versus subsets of the Grassmann (k𝑘k-dimensional vector spaces over 𝔽qnsuperscriptsubscript𝔽𝑞𝑛\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}). In the former, each k𝑘k-set contains (ki)binomial𝑘𝑖{k\\choose i} i𝑖i-sets, leading to approximate eigenvalues that decay linearly (λi≈(k−i)/ksubscript𝜆𝑖𝑘𝑖𝑘\\lambda_{i}\\approx(k-i)/k). On the other hand, each k𝑘k-dimensional vector space contains (ki)qsubscriptbinomial𝑘𝑖𝑞{k\\choose i}_{q} i𝑖i-dimensional subspaces, which leads to eigenvalues that decay exponentially (λi≈q−isubscript𝜆𝑖superscript𝑞𝑖\\lambda_{i}\\approx q^{-i}). The latter property, which we call strong decay is often crucial in applications (e.g. for hardness of approximation 5 or fast algorithms 5), and while it is possible to recover strong decay on weaker posets by increasing the length of the walk 5, this is often untenable in application due to the additional degrees of freedom it affords.333For instance such a walk might take exponential time to implement, or correspond to a more complicated agreement test than desired. The spectral structure of walks on eposets is closely related to their edge-expansion, an important combinatorial property that has recently played a crucial role both in algorithms for  5 and hardness of unique games 5. The key insight in both cases lay in understanding the structure of non-expanding sets. We give a tight understanding of this phenomenon across all eposets in the so-called ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-regime 5, where we show that expansion is tightly controlled by the behavior of local restrictions called links (see Definition 1.7). The expansion of any i𝑖i-link is almost exactly 1−λi​(M)1subscript𝜆𝑖𝑀1-\\lambda_{i}(M). Conversely, any set with expansion less than 1−λi+1​(M)1subscript𝜆𝑖1𝑀1-\\lambda_{i+1}(M) has high variance\nacross i𝑖i-links. In 5, it was shown this characterization allows for the application of a local-to-global algorithmic framework for unique games on such walks. This remains true on eposets,\nand it is an interesting open question whether there are significant applications beyond those given in BHKL’s original work.444While one can apply the framework to playing unique games on the Grassmann poset (or sparsifications thereof), the spectral parameters are such that this does not give a substantial improvement over standard algorithms . Finally, as an application of our structure theorems, we give an in-depth analysis of the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-structure of walks on expanding subsets of the Grassmann poset called q𝑞q-eposets (first studied in [ref]3). We focus in particular on the natural q𝑞q-analog of an important set of walks called partial-swap walks introduced by Alev, Jeronimo, and Tulsiani 4 that generalize the Johnson graphs when applied to expanding hypergraphs. We show that applied to q𝑞q-eposets, these objects give a natural set of walks generalizing the Grassmann graphs and further prove that our generic analysis for eposets gives a tight characterization of non-expansion in this setting. We note that this does not recover the result used for the proof of the 2-2 Games Conjecture which lies in the ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}-regime (replacing variance above with maximum) and requires a dimension-independent bound. This issue was recently (and independently) resolved for simplicial complexes in  and , and we view our work as an important step towards a more general understanding for families like the Grassmann beyond hypergraphs.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: object of intense study in theoretical computer science in recent years.
