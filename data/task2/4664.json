      "content": "Paper Title: On Identity Testing and Noncommutative Rank Computation over the Free Skew Field\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn algebraic circuit complexity the\nbasic arithmetic operations are additions, multiplications, and inverses. Using these arithmetic operations algebraic circuits compute either polynomials or rational functions. An important sub-area of algebraic complexity is noncommutative computation where the multiplication of variables is not commutative\nand the set of monomials (over the variables) form a free monoid.\nIf we allow only addition and multiplication gates in the noncommutative formulas/circuits, they compute noncommutative polynomials (similar to the commutative case) in the free algebra.\n In the commutative case, the role of inverses is well understood but in the noncommutative world it is quite subtle. To elaborate, it is known that any commutative rational expression can be expressed as f​g−1𝑓superscript𝑔1fg^{-1} where f𝑓f and g𝑔g are two commutative polynomials . However, noncommutative rational expressions such as x−1+y−1superscript𝑥1superscript𝑦1x^{-1}+y^{-1} or x​y−1​x𝑥superscript𝑦1𝑥xy^{-1}x cannot be represented as f​g−1𝑓superscript𝑔1fg^{-1} or f−1​gsuperscript𝑓1𝑔f^{-1}g. If we have nested inverses then it makes the rational expression more complicated, for example (z+x​y−1​x)−1−z−1superscript𝑧𝑥superscript𝑦1𝑥1superscript𝑧1{(z+xy^{-1}x)}^{-1}-z^{-1}.\nMoreover, a noncommutative rational expression is not always defined on a matrix substitution. For a noncommutative rational expression 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r}, its domain of definition is the set of matrix tuples (of any dimension) where 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r} is defined. We denote it by dom⁡(𝔯)dom𝔯\\operatorname{dom}(\\mathfrak{r}). Two rational expressions 𝔯1subscript𝔯1\\mathfrak{r}_{1} and 𝔯2subscript𝔯2\\mathfrak{r}_{2} are equivalent if they agree on dom⁡(𝔯1)∩dom⁡(𝔯2)domsubscript𝔯1domsubscript𝔯2\\operatorname{dom}(\\mathfrak{r}_{1})\\cap\\operatorname{dom}(\\mathfrak{r}_{2}). This induces an equivalence relation on the set of all noncommutative rational expressions (with nonempty domain of definition). It was used by Amitsur in his characterization of the universal free skew field (denoted by 𝔽​x¯𝔽¯𝑥\\mathbb{F}{\\lparenless}\\underaccent{\\bar}{x}{\\rparengtr} when the variable set is x¯={x1,x2,…,xn}¯𝑥subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2…subscript𝑥𝑛\\underaccent{\\bar}{x}=\\{x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\}) and the equivalence classes are called the noncommutative rational functions [ref]1. This object plays an important role in the study of noncommutative algebra [ref]1 , control theory , and algebraic automata theory . Computationally, rational functions are represented by noncommutative arithmetic circuits or formulas using addition, multiplication, and inverse gates .\nThe inversion height of a rational formula is the maximum number of inverse gates in a path from an input gate to the output gate. It is known that the inversion height of a rational formula of size s𝑠s is bounded by O​(log⁡s)𝑂𝑠O(\\log s) .\nHrubeš and Wigderson consider the rational identity\ntesting problem (RIT) of testing the equivalence of two rational formulas . It is the same as testing whether a rational formula computes the zero function in the free skew field. In other words, decide whether there exists a matrix tuple (of any dimension) such that the rational formula evaluates to nonzero on that substitution. Rational expressions exhibit peculiar properties which seem to make the RIT problem quite different from polynomial identity testing.\nThe apparent lack of canonical representations such as the sum of monomials representation for polynomials and the use of nested inverses in noncommutative rational expressions complicate the problem. For example, the rational expression (x+x​y−1​x)−1+(x+y)−1−x−1superscript𝑥𝑥superscript𝑦1𝑥1superscript𝑥𝑦1superscript𝑥1(x+xy^{-1}x)^{-1}+(x+y)^{-1}-x^{-1} of inversion height two is a rational identity, known as Hua’s identity [ref]23. A second characterization of the free skew field entries was developed by Cohn .\nA linear pencil L𝐿L of size s𝑠s over noncommuting variables x¯={x1,…,xn}¯𝑥subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\underaccent{\\bar}{x}=\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\} is a s×s𝑠𝑠s\\times s matrix whose entries are linear forms in x¯¯𝑥\\underaccent{\\bar}{x} variables, i.e. L=A0+∑i=1nAi​xi𝐿subscript𝐴0superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖L=A_{0}+\\sum_{i=1}^{n}A_{i}x_{i}, where each Aisubscript𝐴𝑖A_{i} is an s×s𝑠𝑠s\\times s matrix over the field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F}. Cohn showed that for every free skew field entry 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r} in 𝔽​x¯𝔽¯𝑥\\mathbb{F}{\\lparenless}\\underaccent{\\bar}{x}{\\rparengtr}, there is a linear pencil L𝐿L such that 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r} is an entry of the inverse of L𝐿L. More generally, we say that 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r} has a linear pencil representation of size s𝑠s, if for vectors c¯,b¯∈𝔽s¯𝑐¯𝑏superscript𝔽𝑠\\underaccent{\\bar}{c},\\underaccent{\\bar}{b}\\in\\mathbb{F}^{s} and s×s𝑠𝑠s\\times s linear pencil L𝐿L,\n𝔯=c¯t​L−1​b¯𝔯superscript¯𝑐𝑡superscript𝐿1¯𝑏\\mathfrak{r}=\\underaccent{\\bar}{c}^{t}L^{-1}\\underaccent{\\bar}{b} where c¯tsuperscript¯𝑐𝑡\\underaccent{\\bar}{c}^{t} is the transpose of c¯¯𝑐\\underaccent{\\bar}{c}. Hrubeš and Wigderson give an efficient reduction from the RIT problem to the singularity testing problem of linear pencils . In particular, if 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r} is a rational formula of size s𝑠s, they showed that 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r} has a linear pencil representation L𝐿L of size at most 2​s2𝑠2s such that 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r} is defined on a matrix tuple if and only if L𝐿L is invertible on that tuple .\nUsing this connection, they reduce the RIT problem to the problem of testing whether a given linear pencil is invertible over the free skew field in deterministic polynomial time.\nThe latter is the noncommutative Singular problem, whose commutative analog is the symbolic determinant identity testing problem. The deterministic complexity of symbolic determinant identity testing is completely open in the commutative setting . In contrast, the Singular problem in noncommutative setting has deterministic polynomial-time algorithms in the white-box model due to the works of Garg et al.  which is based on operator scaling and that of Ivanyos et al.  which is based on the second Wong sequence and a constructive version of regularity lemma. As a consequence, a deterministic polynomial-time white-box RIT algorithm follows. A central open problem in this area is to design an efficient deterministic algorithm for noncommutative Singular problem in the black-box case .\nThe algorithms by Garg et al.  and Ivanyos et al.  are inherently sequential and we believe that they are unlikely to be helpful for black-box algorithm design.\nIt is well-known  that an efficient black-box algorithm (via a hitting set construction) for Singular would generalize the celebrated quasi-NC algorithm for bipartite matching significantly . There is a randomized polynomial-time black-box algorithm for this problem . Even for the RIT problem (which could be easier than the noncommutative Singular problem), the progress towards designing efficient deterministic black-box algorithm is very limited. In fact, only very recently a deterministic quasipolynomial-time black-box algorithm for identity testing of rational formulas of inversion height two has been designed [ref]2. It is interesting to note that in the literature of identity testing, the noncommutative Singular problem and the RIT problem stand among rare examples where deterministic polynomial-time white-box algorithms are designed but for the black-box case no deterministic subexponential-time algorithm is known. For noncommutative polynomials computed by polynomial-size arithmetic circuits, efficient randomized polynomial identity testing algorithms are known either for polynomial degree bound or for exponential sparsity bound  . In contrast, the complexity of testing the identity of rational circuits is completely open. In fact, even in the white-box setting we do not have a randomized subexponential-time algorithm.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: variable set is x¯={x1,x2,…,xn}¯𝑥subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2…subscript𝑥𝑛\\underaccent{\\bar}{x}=\\{x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\}) and the equivalence classes are called the noncommutative rational functions [ref]1.
