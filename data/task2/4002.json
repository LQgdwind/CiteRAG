      "content": "Paper Title: STN: Scalable Tensorizing Networks via Structure-Aware Training and Adaptive Compression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDriven by new computational hardware and large-scale training data, deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained remarkable achievements in a variety of applications, including image and video recognition  , object detection  , instance segmentation  , and image generation , to name a few. At the same time, recent studies reveal that over-parameterization is a crucial feature for successfully training DNNs, which encourages them to find better local minima in huge parameter space  8. However, the over-parameterized representations of neural networks rely on excessive computational and storage costs, thereby severely restricting their usability in resource-constrained edge devices, such as mobile phones and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices . Consequently, various compression techniques have been proposed for reducing the computational and memory consumption of DNNs, including low-rank approximation  , quantization  , structural sparsification , and pruning . The goal of these methods is to convert a high-precision large model into a small model with low complexity while maintaining or even improving the model’s performance as possible. Among these strategies, the low-rank approximation based on tensor decomposition (TD) has a solid theoretical rationale [ref]19  for capturing the intrinsic structure inside the weight tensors by representing them as multilinear operations over a sequence of latent factors. Moreover, TD-based approaches can achieve higher compression ratios and even obtain accuracy gains by mitigating the overfitting of a pre-trained model 2 [ref]49. In this light, many TD models have been exploited to eliminate redundancy and promote parameter efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which mainly focus on reparameterizing the convolutional and fully-connected layers   . As two of the most classical TD methods, CANDECOMP/PAR- AFAC (CP) and Tucker decomposition  9 were used earlier to accelerate and compress CNNs  . By virtue of tensor networks (TNs) 0, the recently proposed tensor train (TT) 1 and tensor ring (TR) 4 decompositions exhibit better behaviour on higher-order tensor representations. In particular, the storage complexity of TT and TR is linear with the tensor order. However, as pointed out in [ref]47, changing the model size often leads to non-negligible performance degradation, even if the low-rank approximated model is retrained over a long period. This necessitates a new compression paradigm to solve this difficulty, that is, to construct a more compact and flexible representation with little reducing the expressiveness of the original layers. To achieve that, we rethink the inherent limitations of existing TD-based compression methods. (i) Scalability.\nA pre-trained model requires compression into multiple versions of different sizes to match specific scenarios’ computational and diverse storage requirements. However, retraining or fine-tuning each smaller model separately requires additional resources. It is desirable to resize the uncompressed model without retraining while maintaining high accuracy dynamically since decomposition computation in the post-processing stage is trivial. Thereby, several arts [ref]49 [ref]47  try to account for compression during the training procedure, such as adding regularizers and compression loss to preserve the desired low-rank characteristic for the uncompressed models. But they either have unsatisfied performance  or require predetermining the TD model and ranks [ref]49 [ref]47. (ii) Model Selection and Rank Determination.\nA majority of precedent studies     prefer to select a suitable decomposition model to compress the weight tensors in DNNs, e.g., the convolution kernels and dense matrix, expecting to achieve higher compression ratios while maintaining the model performance. However, varying sizes and depths of the parameters exhibit different low-rank structural characteristics, making it inappropriate to decompose all layers with a single TD model. For instance, the Tucker decomposition applies to convolutional layers well rather than fully-connected layers, while the TT is the opposite  . In addition, it is laborious and cumbersome to determine the TD-ranks for each layer to satisfy the memory requirements. Hence, the suboptimal model selection and hand-designed ranks lead to non-negligible performance degradation. To tackle the existing limitations listed above, we propose a novel scalable compression framework to eliminate the redundancy of neural networks (shown in Fig. 1). First, we present a structure-aware training scheme that introduces an additional low-rank regularizer during the training procedure for the uncompressed model to ensure the desired low-rank characteristics for reducing the approximation-caused error. That is separate from [ref]49 [ref]47 because we are unnecessary to specify the TD model and rank in advance. To further compress the pre-trained model, a data-driven adaptive TD strategy is introduced to simultaneously compress the convolutional and fully-connected layers of DNNs, which enables us to learn the most appropriate decomposition topology for each weight tensor and to select the proper ranks under specified storage constraints (see Fig. 6). Note that the adaptive decomposition strategy favours the kernels with unbalanced mode dimensions, and this is the main difference from other TD-based approaches     with fixed topologies and manually designed ranks. Conclusively, the main technical contributions of our work can be summarized as follows: We propose STN to eliminate redundancy of overparameterized DNNs and improve their scalability, allowing flexibility to change the model size without retraining. The training of STN is performed under alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)  framework by solving a regularized optimization problem. That maintains the performance of the full-rank model, and the obtained inherent low-rank characteristic reduces the approximation error. An alternating least squares (ALS)-based scalable compression algorithm is presented to tensorize STN, which avoids the problems of model selection and rank determination while capturing the intrinsic global structure of the weight tensors better. We conduct extensive experiments on several prominent architectures and benchmarks to show the superiority of STN over other scalable and tensorizing counterparts. Notations.
