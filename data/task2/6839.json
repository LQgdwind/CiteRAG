Classical context modeling techniques include key-value, markup, logic-based, ontology-based, object-oriented, and graphical modeling. Among them, ontologies are widely regarded as a highly effective solution for knowledge representation and facilitating information interoperability among applications operating in dynamic and diverse environments . CSMs are based on the concept of ontologies and promote the states and state transitions. We applied a finite state machine, more specifically, a mealy type state machine, to represent the statesâ€™ sequences and transitions. Figure 2 presents an aerial view of context distribution, communication, and modeling for intelligent systems of public domains (with public services related APPs) and personal domains (for applications that are customized for different personal needs). As shown in Figure 2, each domain can administer contextual information of the entities that belong to the domain, which implicitly contains an ontology model of those entities, and each entity can have different attributes [ref]44. The combinations of the states of some correlated attributes and entities form various situations . Each domain can have an attribute like D5-A1, which means the domain D5 has an attribute A1, and a situation like D4-S1, which means domain D4 has a situation space S1. For simplicity, we did not list the entities in between the domains and attributes and the situation spaces in the notations. Additionally, a simplified example of CSM can be found for D3-A1. More examples and details about building them can be found in . The steps representation and coordinator servers in Figure 2 will be referred to in the following methodology sections and discussion for the topics of matrix representation and a privacy protection mechanism.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: domain can administer contextual information of the entities that belong to the domain, which implicitly contains an ontology model of those entities, and each entity can have different attributes [ref]44.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
