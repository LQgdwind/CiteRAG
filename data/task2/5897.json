      "content": "Paper Title: Detecting Backdoors During the Inference Stage Based on Corruption Robustness Consistency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBadnets  is the first work that describes how to embed a backdoor into the DNNs by poisoning part of the training data. Many backdoor attacks have been developed after Badnets. To categorize these works, a reasonable way is to divide them by the triggers’ appearance of these attacks, i.e., the trigger types. The universal trigger is a classical trigger type that is leveraged in many works such as Badnets , Blended , and Low-frequency . Universal trigger represents that for any input images tampered with the same trigger, the backdoor-infected model will give the predefined predictions. Then, the sample-specific trigger is invented 2 [ref]26 7. Unlike universal triggers, the appearance of sample-specific triggers depends on the images that the trigger attaches. Another research topic in backdoor attacks is the imperceptibility of the backdoor triggers, i.e., the invisible backdoor attacks, such as Wanet 3, LIRA , and SSBA [ref]26. The triggers generated by this kind of attack only lead to subtle modifications in images, and humans can hardly perceive the existence of backdoor triggers. A backdoor attack can meet the sample-specific and invisible conditions simultaneously, for example, the SSBA attack [ref]26.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: trigger represents that for any input images tampered with the same trigger, the backdoor-infected model will give the predefined predictions.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
