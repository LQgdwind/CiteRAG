An important concept is the tabu lists, which keep track of the most recent history of the search and prevent the search from going back to previously visited solutions. The early attempts of applying tabu search on vehicle routing include    . Several improvements to the basic tabu search framework have been applied to solving vehicle routing problems. For example, some works    used adaptive memory programming in tabu search. The adaptive memory programming exploits a collection of strategic memory components and is more efficient than using a single fixed memory management procedure .  proposed granular tabu search. The granular is a restricted neighborhood, which not containing the moves that are has a low probability of leading to a good feasible solution. For vehicle routing problems, the granular is typically defined as a limited number of ”short” arcs, based on the observation that ”long” arcs are less possible to be part of high-quality solutions. Because of the simple yet effective idea of granular tabu search, it has been widely applied on VRPs in recent years [ref]223   and the idea of granular has been used in other local search-based methods . As a general concept, tabu search can be easily integrated into other algorithms   . Recently,  combined tabu search with simulated annealing in the local search to efficiently solve a VRP with cross docks and split deliveries. 2 proposed a hybrid method based on a variable neighborhood search framework and the tabu list is adopted in a local search procedure to avoid cycling.  used tabu search in the shaking procedure of variable neighborhood search to solve a class of multi-depot VRPs. The applications of tabu search include multi-depot VRP , periodic VRP , VRP with heterogeneous fleet [ref]101, and open VRP [ref]93, heterogeneous multi-type fleet VRP , multi-depot open VRP , and VRP with discrete split deliveries and pickups , among others  .\n\nReference markers found: [223]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]223: that ”long” arcs are less possible to be part of high-quality solutions.
