      "content": "Paper Title: Voronoi Progressive Widening: Efficient Online Solvers for Continuous State, Action, and Observation POMDPs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section expands on the introduction to cover more previous work in solving continuous action MDPs and POMDPs with online tree search.\nSeveral techniques use double progressive widening (DPW) , originally designed to solve continuous space MDPs.\nMost notably, POMCPOW and PFT-DPW [ref]9 extend POMCP and DPW to handle continuous space POMDPs.\nHowever, these algorithms use DPW as it is proposed with the inefficient action sampling that is not suitable for large problems. One effective direction to handle continuous action spaces has been to use continuous bandits to sample new actions.\nParticularly, hierarchical optimistic optimization (HOO) and the corresponding HOOT algorithm  began work on continuous bandit algorithms applied to MCTS.\nThis is followed by works such as HOLOP [ref]22 that plans with open-loop trajectories instead of individual actions using HOO, POLY-HOOT  with polynomial guarantees, and VOO and VOOT [ref]12 that we build on in this work. Another direction is to use Bayesian optimization to efficiently sample new actions.\nCBTS  uses Gaussian processes (GP) to tackle the random action sampling problem.\nHowever, CBTS does not use progressive widening approach and uses a separate GP at each belief node, which limits its optimization scope and branching capabilities.\nMost recently, BOMCP  extends POMCPOW by posing the random action sampling step of DPW as a Bayesian optimization problem over all the belief and action nodes.\nDespite the effectiveness of BOMCP, GPs are very computationally expensive to fit especially over the joint belief and action space, and BOMCP trades off computation time for sample efficiency compared to POMCPOW. Other directions include GPS-ABT  that uses generalized pattern search to find local optima, PA-POMCPOW that additionally incorporates score functions , and VG-UCT that calculates gradient of the value function .\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: action MDPs and POMDPs with online tree search.\nSeveral techniques use double progressive widening (DPW) , originally designed to solve continuous space MDPs.\nMost notably, POMCPOW and PFT-DPW [ref]9 extend POMCP and DPW to handle continuous space POMDPs.\nHowever, these algorithms use DPW as it is proposed with the inefficient action sampling that is not suitable for large problems.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
