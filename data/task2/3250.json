      "content": "Paper Title: Speedup deep learning models on GPU by taking advantage of efficient unstructured pruning and bit-width reduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConvolution efficiency optimization have recently become quite popular research subject. Jordá et al.  present the way in which the cuDnn library calculates convolution layers dependent upon parameter configurations and data representation. Lavin et al. [ref]9 introduces Winograd convolution implementation which is based on minimal filtering algorithm. This approach for a small filter and batch size was 2.26 times faster than the previous version of cuDnn. Adámek et al.  proposes an FFT based convolution on GPGPU by the shared memory implementation of the overlap-and-save method, and for certain sizes, a 30% speed increase was achieved in comparison to cuDnn. The direct sparse convolutions method was proposed in . The authors used the CSR format to store the weights and perform the convolution operation by use of the sparse matrix multiplication. This approach achieved 3.1-7.3 times speed increase comparison to dense convolution in the AlexNet model, on Intel Atom, Xeon and Xeon Phi processors. Lu et al.  proposed FPGA’s sparse convolution implementation which in VGG16 is almost three times faster than FPGA’s dense implementation. The same type of convolution was applied on the GPU in , where the speed increase for AlexNet 6, GoogleLeNet  and ResNet  models were respectively 1.74, 1.34 and 1.43 times that of the GEMM implementation in the CUBLAS222https://developer.nvidia.com/cublas library. Żurek et al.  introduced improvements to the direct sparse convolutions method which enabled the achievement of better performance than the cuDnn library in some specific cases of sparsity level. The comparison of results of the proposed method with the cuDnn library method was conducted for 32-bit and 16-bit representations of the data. The VGG-16, CNN-non-static and 1x1 layers from\nResNet models were used as benchmarks. The greatest accelerations were achieved for convolution type 1D, where for sparsity level equaling around 90 % the speed was doubled. For the remaining types of convolution with the same sparsity level, depending on the layer type, the acceleration level was around twelve percent. An important role in sparse convolution is played by weight pruning, which can produce a number of zero weights. Information about the level of weight sparsity can be used after the pruning step in order to decide if it is worth running direct sparse implementation or cuDnn.\nIn 9, the authors prove that retraining with pruning can reduce the drop in accuracy caused by removing unimportant weights.\nPruning is one of the most popular solutions when it comes to memory compression and the acceleration of deep learning models 9, [ref]20, .\nSome of the most popular approaches of pruning methods are: pruning without retraining with local search heuristics 9,, lottery tickets search [ref]20, movement pruning  and  or based on variational dropout . The methods based on retraining use masks (static or dynamic) in each epoch which are mainly based on absolute values of weights or gradients. In most of the mentioned works there is no real use of the results obtained from unstructured sparsity in the GPU. In , , , , ,  and  research work concentrates on structural pruning. The approaches presented in these papers are focused mainly on pruning whole channels in a filters by using different techniques. In the following articles , , , [ref]20,  algorithms for unstructured pruning are described without any hardware accelerator mappings.\nQuantisation is the next step by which it is possible to reduce workload and memory further. Many quantisation approaches were applied for deep learning\n   using linear or nonlinear quantisation, regularization modifications, clustering  and other techniques .\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: quite popular research subject.
