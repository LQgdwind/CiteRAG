      "content": "Paper Title: Logical Characterizations of Recurrent Graph Neural Networks with Reals and Floats\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section we consider (node) properties that are definable in MSOMSO\\mathrm{MSO}.\nThe first main result is Theorem 4.1, where we show that for properties definable in MSOMSO\\mathrm{MSO}, the expressive power of GNN‚Äã[‚Ñù]GNNdelimited-[]‚Ñù\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}]s is captured\nby a finitary logic. In fact, this logic is GMSCGMSC\\mathrm{GMSC} and by Theorem¬†3.2, it follows that relative to MSOMSO\\mathrm{MSO}, GNN‚Äã[‚Ñù]GNNdelimited-[]‚Ñù\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}]s have the same expressive power as GNN‚Äã[F]GNNdelimited-[]F\\mathrm{GNN[F]}s (Theorem 4.3 below). Let PùëÉP be a property definable in MSOMSO\\mathrm{MSO}. Then PùëÉP is expressible\nas a GNN‚Äã[‚Ñù]GNNdelimited-[]‚Ñù\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}] if and only if it is definable in GMSCGMSC\\mathrm{GMSC}. Theorem¬†4.1 is proved later in this section.\nThe recent work  relates to Theorem 4.1; see the introduction for a\ndiscussion.\nThe proof of Theorem¬†4.1 can easily be adapted to show that a property PùëÉP definable in MSOMSO\\mathrm{MSO} is expressible as a constant-iteration GNN‚Äã[‚Ñù]GNNdelimited-[]‚Ñù\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}] iff it is definable in GMLGML\\mathrm{GML}. This relates to [ref]5 which shows the same for FOFO\\mathrm{FO} in place of MSOMSO\\mathrm{MSO}.\nThe MSO-version in the\nthis particular case is not an actual generalization, as based on , we\nshow the following; see Appendix C.1. Any property definable by MSOMSO\\mathrm{MSO} and constant-iteration GNN‚Äã[‚Ñù]GNNdelimited-[]‚Ñù\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}] is also FOFO\\mathrm{FO}-definable. Uniting Theorems¬†4.1 and¬†3.2,\nwe see that (recurrent) GNN‚Äã[‚Ñù]GNNdelimited-[]‚Ñù\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}]s and GNN‚Äã[F]GNNdelimited-[]F\\mathrm{GNN[F]}s coincide\nrelative to MSOMSO\\mathrm{MSO}.\nIt is easy to get a similar result for constant-iteration GNNGNN\\mathrm{GNN}s (the details are in Appendix C.2). Let PùëÉP be a property definable in MSOMSO\\mathrm{MSO}. Then PùëÉP is expressible\nas a GNN‚Äã[‚Ñù]GNNdelimited-[]‚Ñù\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}] if and only if it is expressible as a GNN‚Äã[F]GNNdelimited-[]F\\mathrm{GNN[F]}.\nThe same is true for constant-iteration GNNGNN\\mathrm{GNN}s. To put Theorem¬†4.3 into perspective, we note that by Example¬†2.5, the centre-point property is expressible in GMSCGMSC\\mathrm{GMSC}, but not in MSOMSO\\mathrm{MSO}. From Theorem¬†3.2, we thus obtain the\nfollowing. There is a property PùëÉP that is expressible as a GNN‚Äã[F]GNNdelimited-[]F\\mathrm{GNN[F]} but not in MSOMSO\\mathrm{MSO}. Theorem 3.6 shows that constant-iteration GNN‚Äã[‚Ñù]GNNdelimited-[]‚Ñù\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}]s and depth-bounded œâ‚Äã-‚ÄãGMLùúî-GML\\omega\\text{-}\\mathrm{GML}-formulae are equally expressive. The proof of Proposition 2.4 shows that already depth-bounded œâ‚Äã-‚ÄãGMLùúî-GML\\omega\\text{-}\\mathrm{GML} can define properties that are not definable in GMSCGMSC\\mathrm{GMSC}. Thus, by Theorem 3.2 we obtain the following. There is a property definable in constant-iteration GNN‚Äã[‚Ñù]GNNdelimited-[]‚Ñù\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}]\nbut not as a GNN‚Äã[F]GNNdelimited-[]F\\mathrm{GNN[F]}. We next discuss the proof of Theorem¬†4.1.\nWe build upon results due to Janin and\nWalukiewicz  [ref]18, reusing an\nautomaton model from¬† that\ncaptures the expressivity of MSOMSO\\mathrm{MSO}\non tree-shaped Kripke models. With a tree-shaped Kripke model we mean a potentially\ninfinite model that, when viewed as a directed graph, is a directed tree.\nThe out-degree of nodes is unrestricted, different nodes may have different degree, and both leaves and infinite paths are\nadmitted in the same tree. We next introduce the mentioned automaton model. Although we are only going to use it on tree-shaped Kripke models, in its full generality it is actually defined on unrestricted such models.\nWe nevertheless\ncall them tree automata as they belong to the tradition of more\nclassical forms of such automata. In particular, a run of an automaton\nis tree-shaped, even if the input model is not.\nFormally, a parity tree automaton (PTA) is a tuple ùíú=(Q,Œ£N,q0,Œî,Œ©)ùíúùëÑsubscriptŒ£ùëÅsubscriptùëû0ŒîŒ©\\mathcal{A}=(Q,\\Sigma_{N},q_{0},\\Delta,\\Omega), where QùëÑQ is a finite\nset of states, Œ£N‚äÜPROPsubscriptŒ£ùëÅPROP\\Sigma_{N}\\subseteq\\mathrm{PROP} is a finite\nnode alphabet, q0‚ààQsubscriptùëû0ùëÑq_{0}\\in Q is an initial state,\nŒî‚äÜQ√óŒ£N√ó‚Ñ±ŒîùëÑsubscriptŒ£ùëÅ‚Ñ±\\Delta\\subseteq Q\\times\\Sigma_{N}\\times\\mathcal{F}\nis a transition relation with ‚Ñ±‚Ñ±\\mathcal{F} being the set of all transition\nformulas for ùíúùíú\\mathcal{A} defined below, and Œ©:Q‚Üí‚Ñï:Œ©‚ÜíùëÑ‚Ñï\\Omega:Q\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N} is a priority function.\nA transition formula for ùíúùíú\\mathcal{A} is a disjunction\nof FO-formulas of the form where k‚â•0ùëò0k\\geq 0, ùñΩùóÇùñøùñø‚Äã(y1,‚Ä¶,yn)ùñΩùóÇùñøùñøsubscriptùë¶1‚Ä¶subscriptùë¶ùëõ\\mathsf{diff}(y_{1},\\dots,y_{n}) shortens an FOFO\\mathrm{FO}-formula declaring y1,‚Ä¶,ynsubscriptùë¶1‚Ä¶subscriptùë¶ùëõy_{1},\\dots,y_{n}\npairwise distinct, qi‚ààQsubscriptùëûùëñùëÑq_{i}\\in Q are states used as unary predicates and\nœàùúì\\psi is a disjunction of conjunctions of atoms q‚Äã(z)ùëûùëßq(z), with q‚ààQùëûùëÑq\\in Q. A PTA ùíúùíú\\mathcal{A} accepts a language L‚Äã(ùíú)ùêøùíúL(\\mathcal{A}) consisting of (possibly infinite) Kripke models MùëÄM. We have M‚ààL‚Äã(ùíú)ùëÄùêøùíúM\\in L(\\mathcal{A}) if there is an accepting run of ùíúùíú\\mathcal{A} on MùëÄM, and runs are defined in the spirit of alternating automata. While details are in Appendix C.3,\nwe mention that transition formulas govern transitions in the run: a\ntransition of a PTA currently visiting node vùë£v in state qùëûq\nconsists of sending\ncopies of itself to successors of vùë£v, potentially in states other than qùëûq. It is not required that a copy is sent to every successor, and multiple copies (in different states) can be sent to the same successor.\nHowever, we must find some (q,V‚Äã(v),œë)‚ààŒîùëûùëâùë£italic-œëŒî(q,V(v),\\vartheta)\\in\\Delta such that the transition satisfies œëitalic-œë\\vartheta in the sense that œëitalic-œë\\vartheta is satisfied in the model with one element for each successor of vùë£v and unary predicates\n(states of ùíúùíú\\mathcal{A}) are interpreted according to the transition.\nThis specific form of PTAs is interesting to us due to the following. Let œÜ‚Äã(x)ùúëùë•\\varphi(x) be an MSOMSO\\mathrm{MSO}-formula equivalent to an œâ‚Äã-‚ÄãGMLùúî-GML\\omega\\text{-}\\mathrm{GML} formula.\nThen there is a PTA ùíúùíú\\mathcal{A} such that for any\nKripke model MùëÄM:‚Äâ\nM‚äßœÜ‚Äã(w)modelsùëÄùúëùë§M\\models\\varphi(w) iff\nthe unraveling of MùëÄM at wùë§w is in L‚Äã(ùíú)ùêøùíúL(\\mathcal{A}). Theorem¬†9 in [ref]18 states that for every MSOMSO\\mathrm{MSO} sentence œàùúì\\psi,\nthere is a PTA ùíúùíú\\mathcal{A} such that for every\ntree-shaped Kripke model MùëÄM: M‚ààL‚Äã(ùíú)ùëÄùêøùíúM\\in L(\\mathcal{A}) iff M‚äßœàmodelsùëÄùúìM\\models\\psi.\nTo obtain a PTA for œÜ‚Äã(x)ùúëùë•\\varphi(x), we start from the MSOMSO\\mathrm{MSO} sentence œà‚Äã\\colonequals‚Äã‚àÉx‚Äã(œÜ‚Äã(x)‚àß¬¨‚àÉy‚ÄãR‚Äã(y,x))ùúì\\colonequalsùë•ùúëùë•ùë¶ùëÖùë¶ùë•\\psi\\colonequals\\exists x\\,(\\varphi(x)\\wedge\\neg\\exists yR(y,x))\nand build the corresponding PTA ùíúùíú\\mathcal{A}. Then ùíúùíú\\mathcal{A} is as desired. In fact, M‚äßœÜ‚Äã(w)modelsùëÄùúëùë§M\\models\\varphi(w)\niff U‚äßœÜ‚Äã(w)modelsùëàùúëùë§U\\models\\varphi(w) with UùëàU the unraveling of MùëÄM at wùë§w since œÜ‚Äã(x)ùúëùë•\\varphi(x) is\nequivalent to an œâ‚Äã-‚ÄãGMLùúî-GML\\omega\\text{-}\\mathrm{GML}-formula which is invariant under unraveling (defined in Appendix C.1). Moreover, U‚äßœÜ‚Äã(w)modelsùëàùúëùë§U\\models\\varphi(w) iff\nU‚äßœàmodelsùëàùúìU\\models\\psi iff U‚ààL‚Äã(ùíú)ùëàùêøùíúU\\in L(\\mathcal{A}).\n‚àé In view of Theorem¬†4.6 and since GMSCGMSC\\mathrm{GMSC}-programs are invariant under\nunraveling, we may prove Theorem¬†4.1\nby showing that for every PTA ùíú=(Q,Œ£N,q0,Œî,Œ©)ùíúùëÑsubscriptŒ£ùëÅsubscriptùëû0ŒîŒ©\\mathcal{A}=(Q,\\Sigma_{N},q_{0},\\Delta,\\Omega) that is equivalent to an œâùúî\\omega-GML-formula, we can find a GMSCGMSC\\mathrm{GMSC}-program ŒõŒõ\\Lambda\nsuch that for every tree-shaped Kripke model MùëÄM with root¬†wùë§w, we have M‚ààL‚Äã(ùíú)ùëÄùêøùíúM\\in L(\\mathcal{A})\niff M,w‚äßŒõmodelsùëÄùë§ŒõM,w\\models\\Lambda. We then say\nthat ùíúùíú\\mathcal{A} and ŒõŒõ\\Lambda are tree equivalent. For a state q‚ààQùëûùëÑq\\in Q, let ùíúqsubscriptùíúùëû\\mathcal{A}_{q} be the PTA defined\nlike ùíúùíú\\mathcal{A} but with qùëûq as its starting state. For a tree-shaped\nKripke model TùëáT, set QT={q‚ààQ‚à£T‚ààL‚Äã(ùíúq)}subscriptùëÑùëáconditional-setùëûùëÑùëáùêøsubscriptùíúùëûQ_{T}=\\{q\\in Q\\mid T\\in L(\\mathcal{A}_{q})\\}.\nWe say ùí¨‚äÜùí´‚Äã(Q)ùí¨ùí´ùëÑ\\mathcal{Q}\\subseteq\\mathcal{P}(Q) is the universal set for P‚äÜŒ£NùëÉsubscriptŒ£ùëÅP\\subseteq\\Sigma_{N}\nif ùí¨ùí¨\\mathcal{Q} consists precisely of the sets QTsubscriptùëÑùëáQ_{T}, for all\ntree-shaped Kripke models TùëáT, whose root\nis labeled exactly with the proposition letters in PùëÉP.\nLet T=(W,R,V)ùëáùëäùëÖùëâT=(W,R,V) be a tree-shaped Kripke model with root wùë§w and\nk‚àà‚Ñïùëò‚Ñïk\\in\\mathbb{N}, and let WksubscriptùëäùëòW_{k} be the restriction of WùëäW to the nodes on level at most kùëòk (the root being on level¬†0). A kùëòk-prefix decoration of TùëáT\nis a mapping Œº:Wk‚Üíùí´‚Äã(ùí´‚Äã(Q)):ùúá‚Üísubscriptùëäùëòùí´ùí´ùëÑ\\mu:W_{k}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{P}(Q)) such that the following conditions hold: for each S‚ààŒº‚Äã(w)ùëÜùúáùë§S\\in\\mu(w): q0‚ààSsubscriptùëû0ùëÜq_{0}\\in S; for all v‚ààWùë£ùëäv\\in W on the level kùëòk, Œº‚Äã(v)ùúáùë£\\mu(v) is the universal set for V‚Äã(v)ùëâùë£V(v); for each v‚ààWùë£ùëäv\\in W on some level smaller than kùëòk\nthat has successors u1,‚Ä¶,unsubscriptùë¢1‚Ä¶subscriptùë¢ùëõu_{1},\\dots,u_{n} and all\nS1‚ààŒº‚Äã(u1),‚Ä¶,Sn‚ààŒº‚Äã(un)formulae-sequencesubscriptùëÜ1ùúásubscriptùë¢1‚Ä¶subscriptùëÜùëõùúásubscriptùë¢ùëõS_{1}\\in\\mu(u_{1}),\\dots,S_{n}\\in\\mu(u_{n}), Œº‚Äã(v)ùúáùë£\\mu(v)\ncontains the set SùëÜS that\ncontains a state q‚ààQùëûùëÑq\\in Q iff there is a triple (q,V‚Äã(v),œë)‚ààŒîùëûùëâùë£italic-œëŒî(q,V(v),\\vartheta)\\in\\Delta with œëitalic-œë\\vartheta satisfied\nin the following model: the universe is {u1,‚Ä¶,un}subscriptùë¢1‚Ä¶subscriptùë¢ùëõ\\{u_{1},\\dots,u_{n}\\} and each unary predicate q‚Ä≤‚ààQsuperscriptùëû‚Ä≤ùëÑq^{\\prime}\\in Q is interpreted as\n{ui‚à£q‚Ä≤‚ààSi}.conditional-setsubscriptùë¢ùëñsuperscriptùëû‚Ä≤subscriptùëÜùëñ\\{u_{i}\\mid q^{\\prime}\\in S_{i}\\}. A kùëòk-prefix decoration of TùëáT represents a set of accepting runs of\nùíúùíú\\mathcal{A} on the prefix TksubscriptùëáùëòT_{k} of TùëáT. As these runs start in universal sets, for each extension of TksubscriptùëáùëòT_{k} obtained by attaching trees to nodes on level kùëòk, we can\nfind a run among the represented ones that can be extended to an\naccepting run of ùíúùíú\\mathcal{A} on that extension.\nIn fact TùëáT is such an extension.\nThe following crucial lemma is\nproved in Appendix C.3. For every tree-shaped Kripke model TùëáT:\nT‚ààL‚Äã(ùíú)ùëáùêøùíúT\\in L(\\mathcal{A}) if and only if there is a kùëòk-prefix decoration of TùëáT, for some k‚àà‚Ñïùëò‚Ñïk\\in\\mathbb{N}. Using the above, we sketch the proof of Theorem 4.1;\nthe full proof is in Appendix C.3.\nIt follows from Lemma 4.7 that given a PTA ùíúùíú\\mathcal{A}, we obtain a tree equivalent GMSCGMSC\\mathrm{GMSC}-program ŒõŒõ\\Lambda by constructing ŒõŒõ\\Lambda so that it is satisfied at the root of a tree-shaped Kripke model MùëÄM iff MùëÄM has a kùëòk-prefix decoration for some kùëòk. This requires care, but is indeed possible; the details are in Appendix C.3. A crucial part of the construction is expressing transition formulas of PTAs as GMLGML\\mathrm{GML}-formulas. ‚àé\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: that a property PùëÉP definable in MSOMSO\\mathrm{MSO} is expressible as a constant-iteration GNN‚Äã[‚Ñù]GNNdelimited-[]‚Ñù\\mathrm{GNN}[\\mathbb{R}] iff it is definable in GMLGML\\mathrm{GML}.
