      "content": "Paper Title: METASET: Exploring Shape and Property Spaces for Data-Driven Metamaterials Design\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMetamaterials are drawing increased attention for their ability to achieve a variety of non-intuitive properties that stem from their intentionally hierarchical structures . While they traditionally consist of one unit cell that is repeated everywhere, multiple unit cells can also be assembled to create aperiodic mechanical metamaterials with, e.g., spatially-varying or functionally-gradient properties  . Over the past few years, conventional computational methods have been adapted to design these complex structures, including topology optimization (TO) of the microscale unit cells within a fixed macroscale structure  , and hierarchical and concurrent multiscale TO that design both the macrostructure and a pre-specified number of unique unit cells   . However, as the desire to attain even more intricate behaviors grows, so too does the complexity of the design process, which must account for the expensive physical simulations and, in aperiodic structures, the vast combinatorial design space and disconnected neighboring unit cells  [ref]8. Capitalizing on advances in computing power, data-driven metamaterials design can be a more efficient and therefore enticing solution to those challenges. Its success hinges on precomputed unit cell libraries or datasets, which can avoid costly on-the-fly physical simulations and multiscale TO in huge design spaces, as well as provide candidate unit cells that are better connected to their neighbors. Fig. 1 shows an overview of two common approaches in data-driven design: global optimization methods, and machine learning (ML) based methods. In the first case, combinatorial optimization algorithms can be used to directly search for the set of unit cells that realize a target macroscale behavior while minimizing or constraining the boundary mismatch between neighboring cells   [ref]8 . From another perspective, data-driven methods can use the dataset to train ML models that further accelerate design. For example, they have been used to rapidly predict homogenized physical properties as part of the optimization loop 0 1 2 3. Additionally, deep generative models inspired by the computer vision field can learn embedded geometric descriptors that act as reduced dimensional design variables, and construct new designs, e.g., optical 2D metamaterials 4 5, almost instantaneously. Accelerated by data-driven techniques, challenging designs such as spatially-varying displacement profiles and nonlinear behavior that are prohibitively expensive via conventional methods are now tangible. The efficacy of data-driven methods, however, relies highly on the size and coverage of the datasets. The search space of global optimization methods can quickly explode when the number of unit cells increases. Meanwhile, imbalanced datasets with skewed data distributions can reduce the chance of meeting certain property or compatibility requirements, and hobble the performance of ML models since they may not learn a less frequent property or shape as well 6. Therefore, due to the importance of the data on downstream tasks, in this work we focus on the first step of data-driven design: dataset selection. In existing literature, metamaterial datasets are often built using heuristics or the designer’s intuition, with the assumption that the unit cells will offer sufficient coverage for the desired application. Many employ TO to inversely design unit cells that meet pre-specified target properties   0, and some expand the dataset by morphing the shapes  0 or randomly flipping pixels or voxels . Alternatively, Panetta et al. developed graph-based rules to create truss-like unit cells 7. Although these are more feasible than enumerating over all possibilities, bias toward particular properties or shapes can be unintentionally introduced, deteriorating the performance of the design algorithm or the design itself. Moreover, the point at which to stop generating new unit cells has thus far been heuristic with the same goal in mind: to cover a broad property space. The range of this space is sometimes restricted for specific applications , or strict symmetry and manufacturability constraints are implemented to limit the possible shapes 7. More often, the property space is allowed to grow at will, e.g., TO and shape perturbation are repeated until the change in the density of the property space is less than a given tolerance  0. While efficient, all of the works to date have only considered coverage in the property space alone, which can produce similar shapes or overlook those that might benefit the design with regards to boundary connectivity. In contrast, our work explores coverage in both property and shape spaces. Improving imbalance arising from data with multiple classes has been extensively researched in computer science. The most relevant to our application are the data preprocessing strategies such as undersampling to remove data from majority classes, oversampling to replicate data from minority classes, or combinations thereof 6. However, the former can accidentally remove samples with important features, i.e., decrease the diversity, and the latter can lead to model overfitting and increased training overhead 8. Nor are they made to consider the diversity of data with features that have drastically different representations, like shape and property. The issue of downsampling a metamaterial database was addressed by Chen et al. 3, who compressed the size of their database by selecting the samples that are farthest from each other with respect to properties (not shape), allowing them to more efficiently fit a property prediction model. As far as we know, there is currently no method to assess or select a diverse set of unit cells that can simultaneously cover the shape and property spaces. Despite the dearth in the metamaterials field, measuring and ranking items based on their quality as well as their contribution to the diversity of a whole set or subset is an ongoing research area. In computer science, for example, recommender systems rank diverse items such as online products to match users’ preferences. These are based on the concept of diminishing marginal utility 9, wherein lower ranking items bestow less additional value onto the users. In design, too, researchers have developed methods to help designers sift through large sets of ideas by ranking them. In particular, to balance diversity against quality of designs, Ahmed et al. introduced the idea of clustering items into groups for subset selection 0 by employing submodular functions that follow the property of diminishing marginal utility. Additionally, Ahmed et al. 1 showed the application of Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) 2, which model the likelihood of selecting a subset of diverse items as the determinant of a kernel matrix, to the diverse ranking task. The latter, in particular, are elegant probabilistic models that capture the trade-off between competing ideas like quality and diversity. While the goal of maximizing the determinant is similar to the optimality criterion used in generating D-optimal designs 3 in design of experiments, DPPs are not restricted to linear kernels, and have advantages in that calculating marginals, computing certain conditional probabilities and sampling can all be done in polynomial time. This paper shows that DPPs can also be used for coverage in multiple spaces defined over the shapes and properties of unit cells. Our contributions:\nWe propose METASET, an automated methodology that simultaneously considers the diversity of shape and property to select subsets of unit cells from existing datasets. By doing so, we can achieve scalable data-driven design of metamaterials using smaller yet diverse subsets and eliminate bias in imbalanced datasets to improve any downstream task in the data-driven framework. As a part of METASET, we introduce similarity metrics to efficiently assess the diversity of the shapes and properties of 2D and 3D metamaterials. We also propose that a weighted sum of Determinantal Point Process (DPP) kernels based on the shape and property similarities can measure and allow the maximization of the joint diversity of both spaces.\nFor the first time in data-driven metamaterials design — to our knowledge — we reveal through 2D case studies that diverse subsets can expedite and even enhance the design performance and connectivity of aperiodic metamaterials.\nFinally, applying METASET to 3D unit cells, we identify diverse families of isosurface unit cells and discover that these extend beyond the ones commonly considered in the design of functionally-graded structures 4 . The components of our methodology are detailed in Sec. 2.\nIn our 2D case studies (Sec. 3), we explore the effects of diversity and subset size on 2D metamaterial designs with non-intuitive target displacement profiles. In a 3D example (Sec. 4), we compare the impact of different shape similarity metrics on diverse unit cell families and demonstrate that METASET can diversify datasets regardless of the chosen metric.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: complexity of the design process, which must account for the expensive physical simulations and, in aperiodic structures, the vast combinatorial design space and disconnected neighboring unit cells  [ref]8.
