      "content": "Paper Title: A Heterogeneous RISC-V based SoC for Secure Nano-UAV Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA state-of-the-art MCU for nano-UAVs platforms is the STM32-F4.\nThe STM32-F4 is the computational unit of the Crazyflie6 platform, integrating a Cortex-M4 core and 192kB of on-chip SRAM with 180MHz of maximum operating frequency.\nIts low performance and small memory capacity limit the autonomous navigation capabilities of the nano-drone when compared to embedded computers.\nTo this extent, two kinds of approaches have been proposed: minimization of the workload  or offloading of the mission control computation to an external base station, limiting the MCU to flight control.\nThe latter approach presents severe drawbacks, in the first instance, it introduces network-dependent latency, limiting the maximum distance from the workstation to a few tens of meters.\nAlso, the data transmitted are subject to noise on the transmission channel, limiting reliability, and eavesdropping on confidential data. To offer enhanced computational capabilities within a small power budget, recent works also propose SoCs featuring hardwired ASIC accelerators designed for specific UAV applications, like, for example, motion-control [ref]9, visual-inertial odometry (VIO) , simultaneous-localization-and-mapping (SLAM), or QNN inference  .\nThese accelerators achieve impressive energy efficiency, in the order of hundreds of TOp/s/W, by carefully mapping the target algorithm to the hardware.\nFor example, many accelerators exploit the inherent parallelism of the target application, such as using a systolic array for motion control[ref]9.\nAnother common approach exploits reduced-precision arithmetic, as in SLAM and VIO, to reduce the memory footprint and the datapath size.\nExploiting both parallelism and reduced-precision computation is also a well-established technique to accelerate QNN inference and training, due to the nature of such algorithm.\nFor example, accelerators like the NE16 in GAP9, the HWCE in GAP8, and the ternary weight neural-network (so-called CUTIE) accelerator in Kraken, able to reach peaks of 11.6 TMAC/s, have been proposed to speed up QNN inference.\nHowever, due to poor flexibility and programmability, these accelerators have to anyway rely on general-purpose CPUs to achieve end-to-end flight.\nFurthermore, the high area cost per device makes them hard to adopt as they risk becoming obsolete due to the rapid evolution of the target nano-UAVs applications. To overcome these limitations, recent MCUs integrate parallel fully-programmable and flexible accelerators, that have successfully proved to enable autonomous navigation[ref]2 .\nNamely, GAP8, GAP9 and Kraken are MCUs with enhanced computational capabilities, based on parallel programmable accelerators.\nGAP8 and GAP9 are commercial products by GreenWaves Technologies compliant with the so-called Crazyflie-AIdeck board, which is meant as a companion of the Crazyflie to offload the mission control tasks[ref]2.\nGAP8 embeds the so-called Ri5cy core as host CPU and 1.5MB of on-chip SRAM memory, accompanied by a parallel programmable cluster of other eight Ri5cy cores delivering up to 150 GOP/s on 8-bit data.\nRi5cy is a 4 pipeline-stages core compliant with the so-called XpulpV2 ISA, a custom RISC-V ISA based on RV32 with extensions for DSP and ML applications, with support for 16/8-bit SIMD operations and hardware loops.\nGAP9 is an improved version of the GAP8 processor.\nIt is fabricated in a more advanced node than GAP8, halving the power envelope and it features as well 2MB of non-volatile SVM memory.\nAlso, differently from GAP8, GAP9’s cluster includes 4 FPUs with FP16/32 support.\nLastly, Kraken  is a research prototype based on the same heterogeneous architecture of GAP8 and GAP9, i.e., an RV32 CPU along with an eight RV32 core cluster, which delivers up to 90 GOp/s on 2-bit data.\nKraken’s RV32 cores are a more advanced version of Ri5cy, i.e., the Ri5cyNN cores  with support of sub-byte SIMD operations and fused Mac&Load instructions, which enable the concurrent execution of SIMD dot-product and memory accesses, increasing the computation efficiency up to 94%percent9494\\%.\nKraken embeds 1.5MB of on-chip SRAM memory and the CUTIE accelerator, able to achieve up to roughly 90k Ternary-MACs per cycle.\nFurthermore, it provides an event-based camera, tightly coupled with a Spiking Neural Engine accelerator.\nWhen compared to traditional cameras, event-based cameras offer high temporal resolution (in the order of μ𝜇\\mus), very high dynamic range (140 dB vs. 60 dB), low power consumption, and high pixel bandwidth (on the order of kHz) resulting in reduced motion blur. Shaheen’s approach leverages the best from these advanced AI IoT SoCs, integrating its own fully-programmable parallel 8-core RV32 cluster accelerator.\nShaheen’s RV32 cores stem from the Ri5cyNN cores and are further enhanced with mixed-precision support to eliminate the massive software overhead necessary for packing and unpacking data when executing mixed-precision sub-byte kernels, providing up to 8.5x speed-up over Kraken and less than 5.6%percent5.65.6\\% extra area resource over the baseline core without extensions.\nIn addition, Shaheen addresses a major limitation of SoA MCUs: the software stack based on lightweight RTOSs or simple bare-metal runtimes.\nProgramming applications on these stacks is hard, owing to (i) the lack of virtualization capabilities of the host CPUs and (ii) the small amount of memory directly accessible through loads and stores, which limits the maximum software memory footprint.\nIn the context of MCUs, memory resources coincide with on-chip SRAMs and off-chip DRAMs.\nThe first ones provide high bandwidth but are limited to a few hundred kB, due to the area and power constraints .\nThe latter ones offer one order of magnitude more capacity but are much slower and are typically accessed only through explicit input-output copy functions.\nThus, beyond SoA, to support a richer software stack while offering the advanced computing performance and energy efficiency of the RV32-based cluster, Shaheen integrates an RV64 core with advanced virtualization and security features, along with up to 512MB of main memory.\nThis enables the secure coexistence of rich and mature general-purpose OS and bare-metal RTOS on the same platform and eases porting of feature-rich software stacks for robotics, such as ROS.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: computational capabilities within a small power budget, recent works also propose SoCs featuring hardwired ASIC accelerators designed for specific UAV applications, like, for example, motion-control [ref]9, visual-inertial odometry (VIO) , simultaneous-localization-and-mapping (SLAM), or QNN inference  .\nThese accelerators achieve impressive energy efficiency, in the order of hundreds of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
