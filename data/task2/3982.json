      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Policy Iteration for Robust Markov Decision Processes via Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), an agent interacts with the environment and learns to optimally behave in it ¬†.\nNevertheless, an MDP solution may be very sensitive to the model parameters ¬†  , implying that one should be cautious when the model is changing or when there is uncertainty in the model parameters. Robust MDPs (RMDPs) on the other hand, allow some room for the uncertainty in the model parameters as it allows the model parameters to belong to some uncertainty set ¬†  . Solving robust MDPs is NP-hard for general uncertainty sets [ref]22, hence the uncertainty set is popularly assumed to be rectangular which enables tractability  [ref]22 [ref]15.\nThe uncertainty set is called rectangular if the uncertainty in model parameters (i.e., reward and transition kernel) in one state is not coupled with the uncertainty in model parameters in different state.\nUnder this rectangularity assumption, many structural properties of MDPs remain intact [ref]22 and methods such as robust value iteration  , robust modified policy iteration , partial robust policy iteration [ref]15 etc can be used to solve it.\nIt is also known that uncertainty in the reward can be easily handled, whereas handling uncertainty in transition kernel is much more challenging [ref]8.\nWhen an uncertainty set has a polyhedral structure (as in L1/L‚àûsubscriptùêø1subscriptùêøL_{1}/L_{\\infty} robust MDPs) then it can be solved using nested Linear programming, that is, both policy evaluation and policy improvement are done using linear programming exactly or inexactly .\nFurther in this direction, the partial policy iteration approach to solve L1subscriptùêø1L_{1}-Robust MDPs by [ref]15 uses bags of tricks such as homotopy, bisection methods etc.\nBut these methods are conceptually complex, offering very little insight, and unable to generalize to online settings. Work by  considers the R-contamination uncertainty set and proposes a Q-learning algorithm that can be used in online settings too. But their uncertainty set is sa-rectangular, interestingly their results resembles very closely to our sa-rectangular L1subscriptùêø1L_{1} robust MDPs results. We believe, our approach can be used to generalize R-contamination uncertainty set to s-rectangular settings as well. Goyal et al.  consider an r-rectangular uncertainty set that is not s-rectangular, still, the setting is simple enough to admit deterministic policies as optimal policy. A fundamental differences between sa and s rectangular robust MDPs is the greedy and optimal policy in sa-rectangular robust MDPs like non-robust MDPs, is deterministic, but it may be stochastic in s-rectangular case . Several previous works have investigated robust MDPs from a regularization perspective [ref]8   .\nWhile this approach provides an interesting insight into the problem at hand, it has so far did not lead to scalable methods for solving RMDPs.\nAlong this direction and closest to our work is by Derman et. al [ref]8 which showed that robust MDPs can be viewed as value and policy regularized MDPs.\nParticularly, for (ùöúùöä)ùöúùöä(\\mathtt{sa})-rectangular case, they reduced robust policy iteration (both policy evaluation and improvement) to reward regularized non-robust MDPs.\nThe reward regularizer comes from the uncertainty in the reward and transition kernel. Nevertheless, their assumption of kernel noise is unrealistic.\nFor ùöúùöú\\mathtt{s}-rectangular case, they obtained only policy evaluation as regularized non-robust MDPs, and for policy improvement, they go for an external black box solver (projection onto simplex solver). Hence, making it very difficult to generalize in an online setting. Contributions: Established a concrete equivalence between s-rectangular robust MDPs to policy regularized MDPs. A clear understanding of the policy improvement step leads to efficient computation of optimal value and policy that is naturally generalizable to an online setting. A clear characterization of the greedy/optimal policy in s-rectangular LpsubscriptùêøùëùL_{p} robust MDPs. To the best of our knowledge, this kind of policy is novel in literature. Like the softmax policy, these policies give more weight to actions having more advantages but unlike softmax, it doesn‚Äôt play utterly useless actions. We provide a complexity analysis of our methods for LpsubscriptùêøùëùL_{p} robust MDPs that are the same as non-robust MDPs up to some log factors. We correct unrealistic assumption made in noise transition kernel in [ref]8 in both sa and s rectangular case. It is noteworthy that our work can be used to obtain an optimistic policy that is used as an exploration policy in  . Interestingly, we show UCRL 2 algorithm (in discounted setting) resembles UCB VI . This relation is discussed in section 11 in details.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: hand, allow some room for the uncertainty in the model parameters as it allows the model parameters to belong to some uncertainty set ¬†  .
