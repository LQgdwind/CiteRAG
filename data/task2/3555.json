      "content": "Paper Title: AgileWatts: An Energy-Efficient CPU Core Idle-State Architecture for Latency-Sensitive Server Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs far as we know, this is the first work to introduce a very low power processor core power-state (i.e., deep idle C-state) that provides both low transition latency and low power consumption. While low server efficiency for latency-critical workloads has been studied before, previous work proposed management and scheduling techniques to mitigate the problem, rather than addressing it directly (i.e., with a fast yet low-power processor core power state). Modern Cloud Applications. Interactive latency-sensitive cloud applications are gradually shifting to a modular architecture based on loosely-coupled microservices to meet their software maintenance, scalability, and availability requirements   .\nHowever, the decoupled nature of microservices exacerbates the strict tail latency requirements of such applications. Recent work  that characterizes large-scale deployments of microservices at Alibaba clusters shows that servicing a single user request may involve tens or even hundreds of microservices.\nWith each microservice contributing a small amount of service time, together these can add up to a significant end-to-end service latency.\nMemcached appears in a significant fraction of microservices’ call graphs due to its ability to reduce the time to retrieve hot data from databases, making Memcached an important and latency critical component.\nThe same Alibaba study also reveals that to meet the stringent tail latency requirements of microservices, Alibaba servers running latency-sensitive microservices typically operate at 10% utilization.\nThis follows previous reports from industry and academia that the utilization of servers running latency-sensitive applications is typically 5%percent55\\%–20%percent2020\\%      . Servers at low utilization, however, have traditionally suffered from poor energy efficiency, partly because servers running latency-sensitive tasks at low utilization also disable deep C-states to avoid the tens or hundreds of microseconds penalty of transitioning out of such deep C-states  . This emphasizes the need for deep C-states with low transition latency and high power savings. Fine-grained, Latency-Aware DVFS Management.\nBesides C-states, the other major power-management feature of modern processors is dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS).\nPrevious work proposes fine-grained DVFS control to save power, while avoiding excessive latency degradation.\nRubik  scales core frequency at sub-millisecond scale based on a statistical performance model to save power, while meeting a target tail latency.\nSwan  extends this idea to computational sprinting     (e.g., Intel Turbo Boost   ): requests are initially served on a core operating at low frequency and, depending on the load, Swan scales up the frequency (including sprinting levels) to catch up and meet latency requirements.\nNMAP  focuses on the network stack and leverages transitions between polling and interrupt modes as a signal to drive DVFS management.\nThe new C6A state of AW facilitates the effective use of idle states and could make a simple race-to-halt approach     5 [ref]8 more attractive than complex DVFS management techniques. Workload-Aware Idle State Management.\nVarious proposals exist for techniques that profile incoming request streams and use that profile information to improve power management.\nSleepScale  is a runtime power management technique that selects the most efficient C-state and DVFS setting for a given QoS constraint based on workload profiling information.\nWASP  proposes a two-level power management framework;\nthe first level tries to steer bursty request streams to a subset of servers, such that other machines can leverage deeper, longer-latency idle states;\nthe second level adjusts local power management decisions based on workload characteristics such as job size, arrival pattern and\nutilization.\nSimilarly, CARB  packs requests into a subset of cores, while limiting latency degradation, so that the other cores have longer quiet times and can transition to deeper C-states.\nThe idea of packing requests into a subset of active cores, to extend idle periods on other cores is explored by work focusing on both C-state and DVFS management   .\nThese proposals are orthogonal to AW: while C6A can provide most of the benefits of a deep idle state at a much lower latency, advanced and workload-aware sleep management techniques can still bring extra power savings by enabling cores and/or system to enter traditional deeper, higher-latency C-states  8 9  .\nMemory power management techniques               have also been proposed to reduce system energy consumption and they are complementary to our work.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: between polling and interrupt modes as a signal to drive DVFS management.\nThe new C6A state of AW facilitates the effective use of idle states and could make a simple race-to-halt approach     5 [ref]8 more attractive than complex DVFS management techniques.
