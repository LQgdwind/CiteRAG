      "content": "Paper Title: Removing Class Imbalance using Polarity-GAN: An Uncertainty Sampling Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe problem of class imbalance occurs when the distribution of samples among all possible classes is uneven, which results in classes with widely varying sample sizes. Here, the distribution of examples across the known categories is biased or skewed. The distribution can vary from a slight bias to a severe imbalance where there is one example in the minority class for hundreds[ref]5, thousands, or millions of illustrations in the majority class or classes. Datasets with class imbalance pose a severe challenge for predictive modeling as most of the machine learning algorithms used for classification are designed around the assumption of an approximately equal number0 of examples for each class. Hence, for the same reason, machine learning models obtained after training on data sets with severe class imbalance often have poor predictive performance, specifically for the minority class (a class with too few training samples). Various methods have been proposed in past to handle class imbalance[ref]8. Most popular of these approaches can be classified into two major categories (i) Data-level solution , and (ii) Algorithmic level solution. Data-Level methods have few initial success stories and are often based on under-sampling, oversampling, and synthetic sampling. These approaches face certain drawbacks. While performing under sampling , there is a high risk of removing the data point that may contain important information about the predictive class. On the other hand, oversampling may result in overfitting to the training data. Synthetic sampling(SMOTE)[ref]5 based approach synthetically manufacture observations of unbalanced classes similar to the existing one using nearest neighbor classification. However, it is not clear how one synthetically manufacture observation of an unbalanced class when the number of observations is infrequent. For example, we may have only one picture of a rare species we would like to identify using an image classification algorithm. Algorithm-Level methods include cost-sensitive and hybrid approaches. At the Algorithm-Level, there are a variety of methods that have been used. Such as hybrid/ensemble approaches includes a Bayesian Optimization Algorithm that maximizes Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient by learning optimal weights for the positive and negative classes  and an approach that combines Random Over-Sampling (ROS) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a class of generative models approximating the real data distribution. GANs have been widely used for the task of image generation, image super-resolution and semi-supervised learning. State of the art performances for these tasks is obtained by utilizing generative adversarial networks’ power to generate samples from the real data distribution. Various work including Conditional GANs (CGAN) [ref]8 and auxiliary classifier GANs (ACGAN)  further extend GANs by conditioning the training procedure on the class labels for the classifier. It was demonstrated in  that data generated by conditioned GAN improved the classification performance. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any substantial work done for extreme visual classification tasks while using a GAN to generate samples. The main hurdle of using GAN for extreme visual classification tasks comes from the fact that it usually requires many samples to train a generative adversarial network. More often than not, too few training samples are available for most of the classes in datasets with class imbalance. Apart from that, the training process’s instability remains a major practical challenge while training a GAN. Also, conditional GANs only performs well in the case where class boundaries are clear. When a supervised model makes a prediction, it often provides a confidence score for that prediction. In this paper, we use modified GAN as an uncertainty sampling method. Getting feedback when the model is uncertain about prediction has resemblance with active learning popularly known in the literature as uncertainty sampling for active learning. Using uncertainty-based sampling (Manali and Mustafa et al.) has shown that distinguishing between different types of uncertainties has a drastic impact on the learning efficiency. This paper uses a modified Generative Adversarial Network for uncertainty sampling, which we further utilize to sample hard examples and use it for extreme visual classification. To achieve the goal, we also propose adding a second classifier network to the original network. Here, the Generator network tries to compete in a min-max game with Discriminator and the classifier we introduced in the GAN module. An additional condition is enforced on generator network G to produce points within the desired imbalanced class convex hull. The generator network is initialized with auto-encoder to make it stable. The discriminator D ensures that G adheres to the class distribution of imbalanced class.\nWe make the following contributions to the paper. Changes introduced in the GAN, i.e., generating points in the convex hull while keeping it in contention with classifier make sure that the points generated are on the boundary, which helps classifier find a more deterministic decision boundary. Using autoencoders and generating points in convex hulls provide better convergence and prevent points from mixing into different classes, respectively. Using uncertainty help in making the distribution more even. We have done testing extensively on real-world data sets having a high imbalance class, which is not performed in previous methods. We used the below parameters to measure uncertainty sampling. Least Confidence: the difference between the most confident prediction and 100%percent\\% confidence. Margin of Confidence: the difference between the top two most confident predictions. Ratio of Confidence: the ratio between the top two most confident predictions. Entropy: the difference between all predictions, as defined by information theory with our methods. We achieve state of the art performance on extreme visual classification tasks on the FashionMNIST, CIFAR10 MNIST, SVHN, ExDark, UCF101, Anomaly Detection, detection, COVID datasets. In the rest of the paper, we will discuss Methodology used, Algorithms, Results and Related work. our method lead an improvement of 5%percent55\\% for class with least sample i.e. 1:10 ratio in CIFAR-10 dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: of examples across the known categories is biased or skewed.
