      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey on Graph Neural Networks and Graph Transformers in Computer Vision: A Task-Oriented Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImage-Text Matching.\nImage-text matching aims to measure semantic similarity between a pair of image and sentence, which plays a vital role in visuo-linguistic cross-modal content retrieval. Since local similarity between regions and words contributes to global semantic similarity, Huang et al. [ref]198 utilize a cross-modal GCN to align visual regions and word representations for global similarity computation. Unlike the method in [ref]198, Li et al. [ref]199 first learn a relation-enhanced global image representation based on local regions and their relations, and then match this image representation with the sentence representation. A GCN is used to perform relation reasoning on image regions to generate relation-enhanced features. Similar to the method in [ref]199, Yan et al.  also use a GCN to reason about semantic relations between image regions. In addition, they propose a discrete-continuous policy gradient algorithm to transform images and texts into a common space. Wang et al.  improve region-based relation reasoning by introducing commonsense knowledge into the reasoning process. They construct a concept correlation graph and learn consensus-aware concept representations via stacked GCN layers. Besides constructing a relation graph on image regions, Liu et al.  and Li et al.  build a textual graph for the sentence via a dependency parser and perform semantic matching between the two graphs via a GCN and an attention mechanism. In addition, GNNs have also been utilized for video-text matching   . Vision-Language Navigation. Vision-language navigation requires an agent to navigate an unknown environment following a natural language instruction . Deng et al. [ref]208 develop an evolving graphical planner model, which iteratively and dynamically expands a trajectory graph built on the current node, visited nodes, potential action nodes and their relations, and runs a GNN on the graph to predict an action. Unlike the method in [ref]208, Chen et al.  use a GNN to capture the visual appearance and connectivity of the environment from its topological map. Gao et al.  involve external knowledge in action prediction and run a GCN on external and internal environment knowledge graphs to extract external knowledge used for cooperating with internal knowledge. Chen et al.  generate a layout graph at each step according to the instruction and use graph convolution to learn the current navigation state from the current layout graph and history layout memory. The navigation state is used to predict the action probability distribution at the current step. Like the method in [ref]208, Chen et al.  construct an environment graph on visited, navigable, and current nodes. Furthermore, they aggregate information in the graph using self-attention to predict the navigation score for each node.\n\nReference markers found: [198]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]198: and sentence, which plays a vital role in visuo-linguistic cross-modal content retrieval.
