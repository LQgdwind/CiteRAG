For all of our experiments we fixed N=200𝑁200N=200 and set P=α​N𝑃𝛼𝑁P=\\alpha N where α𝛼\\alpha varied between 100.1superscript100.110^{0.1} and 100.5superscript100.510^{0.5}. Each synthetic dataset was pruned to keep a fraction f𝑓f of the smallest-margin examples, where f𝑓f varied between 0.10.10.1 and 111 in Fig. 1 and between 0.20.20.2 and 111 in Figs. 2,3 to match the real-world experiments in Fig. 3. Perceptrons were optimized to find the max-margin separating solution using a standard quadratic programming (QP) algorithm from the CVXPY library (for analysis of the computational complexity of this algorithm see Fig. 8). Results were averaged over 100100100 independent draws of the teacher and training examples. ImageNet model training was performed using a standard ResNet-50 through the VISSL library [ref]41 (stable version v0.1.6), which provides default configuration files for supervised ResNet-50 training (accessible here; released under the MIT license). Each model was trained on a single node of 8 NVIDIA V100 32GB graphics cards with BATCHSIZE_PER_REPLICA = 256, using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a base learning rate = 0.1, nesterov momentum = 0.9, and weight decay = 0.001. For our scaling experiments (Fig. 3 and Fig. 9), we trained one model per fraction of data kept (0.1-1.0) for each dataset size. In total, these plot required training 97 models on (potentially a subset of) ImageNet. All the models were trained with matched number of iterations, corresponding to 105 epochs on the full ImageNet dataset. The learning rate was decayed by a factor of 10 after the number of iterations corresponding to 30, 60, 90, and 100 epochs on the full ImageNet dataset. For our main ImageNet experiments (Fig. 5) we trained one model per fraction of data kept (1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6) ×\\times metric (11 metrics in total). In the plot itself, since any variation in the “fraction of data kept = 1.0” setting is due to random variation across runs not due to potential metric differences, we averaged model performances to obtain a single datapoint here (while also keeping track of the variation across models, which is plotted as ±2plus-or-minus2\\pm 2 standard deviations). In total, this plot required training 55 models on (potentially a subset of) ImageNet. For Fig. 5C, in order to reduce noise from random variation, we additionally trained five models per datapoint and metric, and plot the averaged performance in addition to error bars showing one standard deviation of the mean. Numerical results from Figure 5BC are available from Table 1. ImageNet  is released under the ImageNet terms of access. It is important to note that ImageNet images are often biased [ref]43 . The SWaV model used to compute our prototypicality metrics was obtained via torch.hub.load(‘facebookresearch/swav:main’, ‘resnet50’), which is the original model provided by ; we then used the avgpool layer’s activations. CIFAR-10 and SVHN model training was performed using a standard ResNet-18 through the PyTorch library. Each model was trained on a single NVIDIA TITAN Xp 12GB graphics card with batch size = 128, using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with learning rate = 0.1, nesterov momentum = 0.9, and weight decay = 0.0005. Probe models were trained for 20 epochs each for CIFAR-10 and 40 epochs each for SVHN. Pruning scores were then computed using the EL2Ns metric [ref]10, averaged across 10 independent initializations of the probe models. To evaluate data pruning performance, fresh models were trained from scratch on each pruned dataset for 200 epochs, with the learning rate decayed by a factor of 5 after 60, 120 and 160 epochs. To assess the effect of pruning downstream finetuning data on transfer learning performance, vision transformers (ViTs) pre-trained on ImageNet21k were fine-tuned on different pruned subsets of CIFAR-10. Pre-trained models were obtained from the timm model library . Each model was trained on a single NVIDIA TITAN Xp 12GB graphics card with batch size = 128, using the Adam optimizer with learning rate = 1e-5 and no weight decay. Probe models were trained for 2 epochs each. Pruning scores were then computed using the EL2Ns metric [ref]10, averaged across 10 independent random seeds. To evaluate data pruning performance, pre-trained models were fine-tuned on each pruned dataset for 10 epochs. To assess the effect of pruning upstream pretraining data on transfer learning performance, each of the ResNet-50s pre-trained on pruned subsets of ImageNet1k in Fig. 3D was fine-tuned on all of CIFAR-10. Each model was trained on a single NVIDIA TITAN Xp 12GB graphics card with batch size = 128, using the RMSProp optimizer with learning rate = 1e-4 and no weight decay. Probe models were trained for 2 epochs each. Pruning scores were then computed using the EL2Ns metric [ref]10, averaged across 10 independent random seeds. To evaluate data pruning performance, pre-trained models were fine-tuned on each pruned dataset for 10 epochs.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: see Fig. 8).
