Researchers have proposed various non-deep PLL methods to disambiguate candidate labels. We roughly divide them into average-based methods and identification-based methods. Average-based methods assume that each candidate label has an equal probability of being the ground-truth label. For parametric models, Cour et al.   proposed to distinguish the average output of candidate and non-candidate labels. For instance-based models, Hullermeier et al.  estimated the ground-truth label of each sample by voting on the label information of its neighborhood. However, these average-based methods can be severely affected by false positive labels in the candidate set  . Identification-based methods address the shortcoming of average-based methods by directly identifying the ground-truth label and maximizing its estimated probability . To implement these methods, researchers have exploited various techniques, such as maximum margin   and maximum likelihood criteria  . For example, Nguyen et al.  maximized the margin between the maximum output of candidate and non-candidate labels. However, it cannot distinguish the ground-truth label from other candidate labels. To this end, Yu et al.  directly maximized the margin between the ground-truth label and all other labels. Unlike the maximum margin criterion, Jin et al.  iteratively optimized the latent ground-truth label and trainable parameters via the maximum likelihood criterion. Considering the fact that different samples and distinct candidate labels should contribute differently to the learning process, Tang et al.  further utilized the weight of each sample and the confidence of each candidate label to facilitate disambiguation. They exploited the model outputs to estimate the confidence of candidate labels. Differently, Zhang et al.   and Gong et al. [ref]28 leveraged the smoothness assumption for confidence estimation, i.e., samples that are close in feature space tend to share the same label. In addition, Liu et al.  maximized a mixture-based likelihood function to deal with PLL. But limited by linear models, these non-deep PLL methods are usually optimized in an inefficient manner .\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: and the confidence of each candidate label to facilitate disambiguation.
