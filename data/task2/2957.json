      "content": "Paper Title: Deep convolutional forest: a dynamic deep ensemble approach for spam detection in text\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMobile messaging service has become one of the most common means of communication among people since they allow individuals to communicate with one another at any time and from any location. Besides, there is a vast number of messaging apps that provide their service for free. According to statistics, 95% of mobile messages in the USA are read and responded to within three minutes of receiving . In addition, Short Message Service (SMS) offers businesses an enormous chance to communicate and interact with customers as 48% of consumers prefer direct communication from businesses via SMS . As a result, users are prone to SMS attacks such as spam and phishing, especially users who lack awareness about cyber threats. Spam text is any undesired text transmitted to people without their permission and may include a link to a phone number to call, a link to open a website, or a link to download a file. Thus, an attacker can masquerade as a trusted entity and exploit spam texts by attaching malicious links so that victims may be duped into clicking a harmful link, resulting in installing malware or revealing sensitive information, including login credentials and credit card numbers  . For example, phishing attacks can occur by sending fake messages for users telling them to reset their passwords to be able to login to Facebook, Twitter, or any other platform . Besides, spammers can share misleading information about the COVID-19 pandemic causing a negative impact on society . Therefore, filtering spam texts is crucial to protect users against social engineering attacks, mobile malware and threats. Previous studies in the area of spam classification focused on using machine learning algorithms , but these algorithms require prior knowledge and domain expertise for identifying useful features in order to achieve accurate classification [ref]7. Furthermore, researchers proposed deep learning approaches to detect spam . However, deep neural networks require much effort in tuning hyper-parameters . Besides, they require massive data for training to predict new data accurately. Consequently, they require a high computational cost . To overcome the high complexity of deep learning models and to reduce the effort spent in tuning hyper-parameters, Zhou and Feng  developed multi-grained cascade forest (gcForest), a decision tree ensemble approach that can be applied to different classification tasks and has much fewer hyper-parameters than deep learning neural networks. Ensemble methods  train multiple base models to produce a single best-fit predictive model. Kontschieder et al. 0 demonstrated that employing ensemble approaches like random forests 1 aided by deep learning model features can be more effective than solely using a deep neural network. gcForest applies multi-grained scanning for extracting features and employs a cascade structure (i.e., layer-by-layer processing of raw features) for learning. Inspired by gcForest, this paper enhances the procedure of feature engineering by replacing the multi-grained scanning with convolutional layers and pooling layers to capture high-level features from textual data. The motivation for using gcForest as a baseline for this paper is that gcForest is the first deep learning model that trains data without relying on neural networks and backpropagation, as the authors claimed . This paper introduces a dynamic (self-adaptive) deep ensemble mechanism to overcome the stated limitations of machine learning and deep learning approaches for detecting spam texts. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: Implementing a dynamic deep ensemble model called Deep Convolutional Forest (DCF). Extracting features automatically by utilizing convolutional layers and pooling layers. Determining the model complexity automatically so that the model can perform accurately on both small-scale data and large-scale data. Classifying text into Spam or Ham (Not-Spam), achieving a remarkable accuracy. The rest of this paper is arranged as follows: ”Related work” provides the literature review, ”Methodology” explains the word embedding technique, followed by the detailed explanation of deep convolutional forest (DCF), ”Experimental results” shows the results of the proposed method along with results of traditional machine learning classifiers and existing deep learning methods, ”Discussion” discusses the findings and explains why the proposed solution outperforms the existing solutions. Finally, ”Conclusion” concludes the proposed work and contains recommendations for future research.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: focused on using machine learning algorithms , but these algorithms require prior knowledge and domain expertise for identifying useful features in order to achieve accurate classification [ref]7.
