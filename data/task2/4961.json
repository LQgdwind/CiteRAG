      "content": "Paper Title: Transformers meet Stochastic Block Models: Attention with Data-Adaptive Sparsity and Cost\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Transformer 0 architecture has been the go-to method for encoding sequential data, due to its superior performance in various tasks such as machine translation , image classification , and protein language modeling . Its key strength stems from the multi-head attention module, where a so-called attention score matrix computes how contextually important one token is to another for all possible token pairs. Each Transformer layer simultaneously pools the token representations based on the attention scores, eventually returning contextualized features without sequentially traversing through the input sequence as its recurrent neural network-based predecessors [ref]18. A well-known drawback of the original Transformer is its high computational cost in time and memory that increases quadratically with sequence length. This is due to the full pairwise computation of attention scores, which prohibits applying it in tasks involving long-range dependencies such as document summarization  or high-resolution image processing . Many works have thus focused on developing more efficient alternatives by exploiting fixed or learnable attention sparsity patterns  [ref]51  , low-rank approximations  , or kernelized attention modules  . Even though the efficient alternatives hold theoretical expressibility guarantees , they are far from sufficient, still failing to convince practitioners to replace the original Transformer. We believe this is mostly due to their lack of adaptability. They apply the same modifications to unanimously sparsify all the attention modules across layers, without considering the tasks at hand. Such strategy imposes inductive bias too strongly and often leads to sub-optimal cost vs. performance trade-offs in downstream tasks . In this work, we argue that to retain the utmost potential of Transformers, each attention module should have the ability to flexibly choose between sparse and full attention. This is especially evident when considering many state-of-the-art systems suggest the need for a mixture of dense and sparse attention layers. For example, a qualitative analysis on pretrained BERT showed that lower layers exhibit broad dense attention while upper layers perform focused sparse attention . In the case of GPT-3 , the Transformer blocks are manually arranged to alternate between dense and sparse attention. To contribute to the efficient Transformers lineage, we propose SBM-Transformer, capable of adjusting its attention sparsity data-adaptively based without fully computing the attention score matrix (Figure 1). Leveraging a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM) , each attention head samples a bipartite graph connecting queries to keys. Then, the adjacency of the sampled graph is used as an attention mask so that only attention scores corresponding to sampled edges are computed.\nThe overall computational cost is linear in the number of edges, which can range from linear to quadratic in sequence length depending on the data and task under concern. Each attention head is equipped with its own underlying SBM, enabling the model to diversify the attention sparsity across heads and layers. By incorporating a straight-through estimator  in the discrete graph-sampling step, SBM-Transformer enjoys end-to-end differentiability and can find the proper attention sparsity based solely upon minimizing the predictive loss. The model can also easily be further regularized by penalizing the number of sampled edges, which results in a lighter model using less computational resources during inference. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first Transformer architecture that can data-adaptively choose between linear to full attention with respective computational costs. To summarize, our main contributions are as follows: We present SBM-Transformer, a novel Transformer of which each attention head can adaptively adjust its attention sparsity as well as computational cost based on the input data. To demonstrate the benefit of this flexibility, we theoretically prove that SBM-Transformer retains universal approximability, and also stress-test the model under a synthetic task where full attention is required to achieve 100% accuracy. Evaluations on LRA and GLUE benchmarks show that SBM-Transformer outperforms previous efficient Transformer models as well as the vanilla Transformer with dense attention.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: based on the attention scores, eventually returning contextualized features without sequentially traversing through the input sequence as its recurrent neural network-based predecessors [ref]18.
