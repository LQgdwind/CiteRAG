      "content": "Paper Title: Enhancing the Transferability of Adversarial Attacks through Variance Tuning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn contrast, to mitigate the threat of adversarial examples, various adversarial defense methods have been proposed. One promising defense method is called adversarial training [ref]8 [ref]15 [ref]21 that injects the adversarial examples into the training data to improve the model robustness. Tramèr et al. propose ensemble adversarial training by augmenting the training data with perturbations transferred from several models, which can further improve the robustness against transfer-based black-box attacks. However, such adversarial training methods, as one of the most powerful and extensively investigated defense methods, often result in high computation cost and are difficult to be scaled to large-scale datasets and complex neural networks [ref]15. Guo et al. utilize a set of image transformations (\\egJPEG compression, Total Variance Minimization, \\etc) on the inputs to eliminate adversarial perturbations before feeding the images to the models. Xie et al. adopt random resizing and padding (R&P) on the inputs to mitigate the adversarial effect. Liao et al. propose to train a high-level representation denoiser (HGD) to purify the input images. Xu et al. propose two feature squeezing methods: bit reduction (Bit-Red) and spatial smoothing to detect adversarial examples. Feature distillation (FD)  is a JPEG-based defensive compression framework against adversarial examples. ComDefend  is an end-to-end image compression model to defend adversarial examples. Cohen et al. adopt randomized smoothing (RS) to train a certifiably robust ImageNet classifier. Naseer et al. design a neural representation purifier (NRP) model that learns to purify the adversarially perturbed images based on the automatically derived supervision.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: In contrast, to mitigate the threat of adversarial examples, various adversarial defense methods have been proposed.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
