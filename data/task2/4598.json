      "content": "Paper Title: On the existence of strong proof complexity generators\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe dWPHP for a function g𝑔g extending n𝑛n bits to m=m​(n)𝑚𝑚𝑛m=m(n) bits is formalized by\nthe formula Notation ∀1(n)for-allsuperscript1𝑛\\forall 1^{(n)} means that the universal quantifier ranges over all strings\n1​…​11…11\\dots 1 of any length n𝑛n.\nTo witness this formula means to find a witness y𝑦y for the existential quantifier given\n1(n)superscript1𝑛1^{(n)} as input.\nThis task became known recently in complexity theory as the range avoidance\nproblem666That problem deals with functions computed by circuits\nand the input to the task is the circuit itself; that is included in the formulation above as g𝑔g can have parameters (not shown in the notation).. Witnessing is a classic notion of proof theory777In particular,\nwitnessing of dWPHP is discussed in [16, Sec.7]. and, in particular, many fundamental results\nin bounded arithmetic are formulated as follows: if a theory T𝑇T proves a formula of\na certain syntactic complexity then it can be witnessed\n(i.e. its leading ∃\\exists can be witnessed) by a function from\na certain computational class C𝐶C.\nSuch statements are known\nfor many basic bounded arithmetic theories, many natural syntactic classes of formulas\nand computational classes of functions. Unprovability results are generally difficult and usually conditional, and we shall use one below.\nBut in the relativized set-up (in our situation this would mean that g𝑔g is given by an oracle)\nmany unconditional\nunprovability results are known and they are usually derived by showing that a principle at hand cannot be witnessed\nby a function in some particular class C𝐶C (for dWPHP see the end of this section). We now give an application of the conditional unprovability result of [ref]23.\nConsider theory TPVsubscript𝑇PV{T_{\\mbox{\\tiny PV}}} whose language has a k𝑘k-ary function symbol fMsubscript𝑓𝑀f_{M}\nattached to every p-time clocked machine M𝑀M with k𝑘k inputs, all k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1. The symbol\nfMsubscript𝑓𝑀f_{M} is naturally interpreted on 𝐍𝐍\\mathbf{N} by the function M𝑀M computes.\nThe axioms of TPVsubscript𝑇PV{T_{\\mbox{\\tiny PV}}} are all universal sentences in the language true in 𝐍𝐍\\mathbf{N} under\nthis interpretation. The hypothesis used in the unprovability result is this. Hypothesis (H): There exists a constant d≥1𝑑1d\\geq 1 such that every language in 𝒫𝒫{\\cal P} can be decided by circuits of size O​(nd)𝑂superscript𝑛𝑑O(n^{d}):\n𝒫⊆Size​(nd)𝒫Sizesuperscript𝑛𝑑{\\cal P}\\subseteq\\mbox{Size}(n^{d}). The possibility that (H) is true with d=1𝑑1d=1 is attributed to Kolmogorov but it is not\na hypothesis accepted by mainstream complexity theory. However, there are no technical results\nsupporting the skepticism. In fact, (H) has a number of interesting consequences\nsuch as 𝒫≠𝒩​𝒫𝒫𝒩𝒫{\\cal P}\\neq{\\cal N}{\\cal P} or ℰ⊆S​i​z​e​(2o​(n))ℰ𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒superscript2𝑜𝑛{\\cal E}\\subseteq Size(2^{o(n)}) (the latter is bad for universal derandomization but it is good for proof complexity, cf.  [ref]23). The following theorem uses\ng:=tts,kassign𝑔subscripttt𝑠𝑘g:={\\mbox{{\\bf tt}}}_{s,k} with s=2ϵ​k𝑠superscript2italic-ϵ𝑘s=2^{\\epsilon k} for a fixed 0<ϵ<10italic-ϵ10<\\epsilon<1 for our p-time\nfunction. The dWPHP for this function can be expressed by formula: where n=n​(m):=10​s​log⁡s𝑛𝑛𝑚assign10𝑠𝑠n=n(m):=10s\\log s.\nWe chose m𝑚m as the natural parameter: m𝑚m and n𝑛n\nare polynomially related and determine each other so this indeed expresses dWPHP. Assume hypothesis (H). Then for every 0<ϵ<10italic-ϵ10<\\epsilon<1 and s=s​(k):=2ϵ​k𝑠𝑠𝑘assignsuperscript2italic-ϵ𝑘s=s(k):=2^{\\epsilon k}\nthe theory TPVsubscript𝑇PV{T_{\\mbox{\\tiny PV}}} does not prove the sentence\n(1). The proof of this theorem in [ref]23 goes by showing that (1)\ncannot be witnessed in a particular interactive way discussed below. However, we want\nto stress that the unprovability result itself, perhaps proved from other hypotheses (or unconditionally) not using witnessing methods (but using model theory instead, for example)\nimplies the impossibility to witness (1) in a particular way. To illustrate the idea simply we start by showing that (1) cannot\nbe witnessed by a p-time function f𝑓f, assuming (H).\nThe property that f𝑓f\nwitnesses (1) is itself a universal statement and hence, if true, an axiom of TPVsubscript𝑇PV{T_{\\mbox{\\tiny PV}}}. As this axiom easily implies (1)\nwe get a contradiction with Theorem 2.1. In fact, it is easy to see (as pointed out by one of the referees) that for any specific 0<ϵ<10italic-ϵ10<\\epsilon<1\nthe existence of a p-time witnessing function f𝑓f for (1)\nwith s=2ϵ​k𝑠superscript2italic-ϵ𝑘s=2^{\\epsilon k}\nis equivalent to the existence of a language in ℰ∖S​i​z​e​(2ϵ​n)ℰ𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒superscript2italic-ϵ𝑛{\\cal E}\\setminus Size(2^{\\epsilon n}):\nthe set for any potential p-time f𝑓f consists of the collection of characteristic functions of a language\nin ℰℰ{\\cal E} for input lengths ℓ≥1ℓ1\\ell\\geq 1, and vice versa. Consider now an interactive\nmodel of witnessing via\nStudent - Teacher computation. In this model of computation (cf.  )\np-time student S𝑆S, given 1(n)superscript1𝑛1^{(n)}, produces his candidate solution\nb1∈{0,1}msubscript𝑏1superscript01𝑚b_{1}\\in{\\{0,1\\}^{m}}. A computationally unlimited teacher T𝑇T either acknowledges the correctness or she produces a counter-example:\nx1∈{0,1}nsubscript𝑥1superscript01𝑛x_{1}\\in{\\{0,1\\}^{n}} s.t. g​(x1)=b1𝑔subscript𝑥1subscript𝑏1g(x_{1})=b_{1}. S𝑆S then produces his second candidate solution b2subscript𝑏2b_{2} using also x1subscript𝑥1x_{1},\nT𝑇T either accepts it or gives counter-example x2subscript𝑥2x_{2} etc. The requirement is that within a given bound\nt𝑡t on the number of rounds S𝑆S always succeeds. This can be written in a universal way as The witnessing for TPVsubscript𝑇PV{T_{\\mbox{\\tiny PV}}} guarantees that t𝑡t is a constant.\nWe remark that the witnessing for TPV+S21subscript𝑇PVsubscriptsuperscript𝑆12{T_{\\mbox{\\tiny PV}}}+S^{1}_{2} yields\nS-T protocol with polynomially many rounds t=mO​(1)𝑡superscript𝑚𝑂1t=m^{O(1)}; this relates to the notion of\npseudo-surjectivity mentioned in the Introduction\n(the universal statement (2) can be represented by an infinite family of p-size tautologies and pseudo-surjectivity requires that these tautologies do not have short proofs,\ncf.   for details). Let us state the conclusion of this discussion formally. Assume hypothesis (H). Then dWPHP for function tts,ksubscripttt𝑠𝑘{\\mbox{{\\bf tt}}}_{s,k} with parameters as in Theorem 2.1\ncannot be witnessed by a Student-Teacher computation with p-time Student\nand constantly many rounds. Hence to witness the non-emptiness of the\ncomplement of tts,ksubscripttt𝑠𝑘{\\mbox{{\\bf tt}}}_{s,k} with parameters as in Theorem 2.1\nby a constant round S-T protocol with p-time student\nwould imply arbitrarily high polynomial lower bounds for circuits\ncomputing a language in 𝒫𝒫{\\cal P}. Recently Ilango, Li and Williams  proved that the dWPHP for the\ncircuit value function C​V𝐶𝑉CV\n(cf. Section 4) is not provable in TPVsubscript𝑇PV{T_{\\mbox{\\tiny PV}}}\nby showing that it cannot be witnessed by an S-T computation with parameters\nas in Theorem 2.2, assuming\na couple of hypotheses of a different nature: that c​o​𝒩​𝒫𝑐𝑜𝒩𝒫co{\\cal N}{\\cal P} is not infinitely often in\nthe Arthur-Merlin class AM and a\nheuristically justified conjecture in cryptography about the security of the\nindistinguishability obfuscation i​𝒪𝑖𝒪i{\\cal O}.\nBoth these hypotheses appear to be accepted by majority of experts (as oppose to hypothesis\n(H)). However,\none may wonder whether the hypothesis that the dWPHP cannot be in general witnessed\nby a constant-round (or even with polynomially many rounds) S-T protocol with\na p-time student is not more fundamental, in the sense of being closer to basic\nconcepts, than the hypotheses above used to derive it. If we manage to extend the unprovability to theory TPV∪S21subscript𝑇PVsubscriptsuperscript𝑆12{T_{\\mbox{\\tiny PV}}}\\cup S^{1}_{2} then we would rule out witnessing by S-T computation\nwith polynomially many rounds. Extending it further to theory TPV∪T21subscript𝑇PVsubscriptsuperscript𝑇12{T_{\\mbox{\\tiny PV}}}\\cup T^{1}_{2} (or equivalently to TPV∪S22subscript𝑇PVsubscriptsuperscript𝑆22{T_{\\mbox{\\tiny PV}}}\\cup S^{2}_{2})\nwould rule out witnessing by p-time machines accessing an 𝒩​𝒫𝒩𝒫{\\cal N}{\\cal P} oracle.\nAll these statements need to be conditional as they imply (unconditionally) that 𝒫𝒫{\\cal P} differs from 𝒩​𝒫𝒩𝒫{\\cal N}{\\cal P}: if 𝒫=𝒩​𝒫𝒫𝒩𝒫{\\cal P}={\\cal N}{\\cal P} then this\nis implied by a true universal statement in the language of TPVsubscript𝑇PV{T_{\\mbox{\\tiny PV}}} (saying that a particular p-time algorithm solves SAT)\nand hence all true universal closures of bounded formulas are equivalent over TPVsubscript𝑇PV{T_{\\mbox{\\tiny PV}}} to universal statements which are axioms of TPVsubscript𝑇PV{T_{\\mbox{\\tiny PV}}}. Further note that in the relativized world we have a number of unconditional results\nabout the impossibility to witness\ndWPHP. As an example let us mention that\nwe cannot witness dWPHP by a non-uniform p-time machine (i.e. using a sequence of polynomial size circuits, cf. Sipser ) with an\naccess to an 𝒩​𝒫R𝒩superscript𝒫𝑅{\\cal N}{\\cal P}^{R} oracle where R𝑅R is the graph of g𝑔g that g𝑔g is not a bijection between [0,a]0𝑎[0,a] and [0,2​a]02𝑎[0,2a].\nAnother example is that\neven if we have oracle access to g𝑔g and to another function f𝑓f we cannot witness\nby a PLS problem with base data defined by p-time machines with oracle access to f,g𝑓𝑔f,g\nthat g𝑔g is not a bijection between [0,a]0𝑎[0,a] and [0,2​a]02𝑎[0,2a]\nwith f𝑓f being its inverse map. The interested reader can find these results (and all background)\nin [13, Secs.11.2-3] and in references given there.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: that a principle at hand cannot be witnessed\nby a function in some particular class C𝐶C (for dWPHP see the end of this section). We now give an application of the conditional unprovability result of [ref]23.\nConsider theory TPVsubscript𝑇PV{T_{\\mbox{\\tiny PV}}} whose language has a k𝑘k-ary function symbol fMsubscript𝑓𝑀f_{M}\nattached to every p-time clocked machine M𝑀M with k𝑘k inputs, all\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
