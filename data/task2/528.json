      "content": "Paper Title: NROWAN-DQN: A Stable Noisy Network with Noise Reduction and Online Weight Adjustment for Exploration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn our experiments, hyper-parameters are designed based on Hessel‚Äôs, Mnih‚Äôs, and Fortunato‚Äôs algorithms  [ref]31 [ref]25, and the network structure is exactly the same as that in Hessel‚Äôs algorithm. We have fine-tuned some of the hyper-parameters in order to fit our experimental situation better. For example, in Cartpole and Pong, it takes 30K frames and 1M frames respectively to run a round of experiments. So it is inappropriate to use a replay buffer with 1M capacity as the setting in Mnih‚Äôs algorithm [ref]31. When we conducted a comparative experiment, hyper-parameters of all the public parts of the algorithms are consistent in each comparison. In order to ensure the reproducibility of the experiment, we attach a detailed report in Table 1, which includes pre-processing setting, network structure setting, and public hyper-parameters setting. In the original environment, each frame is a 3-channel color image. These pictures will be converted into single-channel grayscale images. Then these pictures will be scaled to (84, 84) and transmitted to the agent. Since the scale of the four problems is small, we don‚Äôt stack frames. During the learning process, each frame will be treated as a separate state for the agent. Correspondingly, the action will not be repeated. Since there are not involving statistics among different games, we do not clip the rewards. Since Cartpole, MountainCar and Acrobot are not involving high-dimensional state input, the original information from these environments will be transmitted to the agent without any processing. Our Q network structure is the same as the common Q network structure in the reinforcement learning. There are three convolution layers in our Q network. The first layer has 32 channels, the convolution kernel size is 8√ó\\times8, and the step size is 4. The second layer has 64 channels, the convolution kernel size is 4√ó\\times4, and the step size is 2. The third layer has 64 channels, the convolution kernel size is 3√ó\\times3, and the size is 1. After convolution processing, the pixel matrix is changed into a one-dimensional vector and delivered to the fully connected layer. The fully connected layer contains a hidden layer and an output layer. The hidden layer has 512 neurous. The number of neurous in the output layer is the same with the number of environmental actions. Except the output layer, all the layers take the ReLu function as their activation function. Since Cartpole, MountainCar and Acrobot do not need to process high-dimensional information, the state information provided by the Gym can be directly delivered to the fully connected layer. The fully connected layer has two hidden layers and an output layer. Each hidden layer has 128 neurons. The output layer has the same number of neurons as the number of environmental actions. Similarly, except the output layer, all the layers take the ReLu function as their activation function. 1M frames are required in each round of learning in Pong, and the replay buffer size is 100K. In the first 10K frames, gradient update process of Q network is not performed. The agent take actions using a random initialization network. During this process, the 4-tuple (st,at,rt,st+1)subscriptùë†ùë°subscriptùëéùë°subscriptùëüùë°subscriptùë†ùë°1(s_{t},a_{t},r_{t},s_{t+1}) is pushed into the replay buffer at each time step. After 10K frames, agent randomly samples 32 tuples from the replay buffer at each time step, and performs batch random gradient descent. Every 1K frames, the parameters of the target network are updated to the parameters of the current online network. For Cartpole, MountainCar and Acrobot, each round of learning only takes 30K frames, and the replay buffer size is 10K. When the number of quaternions in the replay buffer is enough for the agent to sample, the learning starts. Agent randomly samples 32 tuples from the replay buffer at each time step, and performs batch random gradient descent on the parameters in the online network. The parameters of the target network are updated to the parameters of the current online network every 1K frames. In addition to the above setting, other hyper-parameters are involved in our algorithm. When using the online adjustment strategy, kf‚Äãi‚Äãn‚Äãa‚Äãlsubscriptùëòùëìùëñùëõùëéùëôk_{final} is set to 4.0. In the following experiments, kf‚Äãi‚Äãn‚Äãa‚Äãlsubscriptùëòùëìùëñùëõùëéùëôk_{final} will be set to a value in the range of {2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0}. Agents using noisy networks also have hyper-parameters setting that is not available in the original DQN. In our experiment, the initial value œÉ0subscriptùúé0\\sigma_{0} is set to 0.4. The noise factor ŒµisubscriptùúÄùëñ\\varepsilon_{i} and ŒµjsubscriptùúÄùëó\\varepsilon_{j} are randomly generated according to a normal distribution. The shape of the normal distribution is determined by the dimension of input or output. All the agents use the Adam optimizer  to update the network parameters. The learning rate Œ±ùõº\\alpha is set to 0.0001. Table 2 shows the learning and noise parameters setting. In the following experiments, Œ±ùõº\\alpha will be set to a value in the range of {0.0001, 0.000075, 0.000025}.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: In our experiments, hyper-parameters are designed based on Hessel‚Äôs, Mnih‚Äôs, and Fortunato‚Äôs algorithms  [ref]31 [ref]25, and the network structure is exactly the same as that in Hessel‚Äôs algorithm.
