      "content": "Paper Title: On the Robustness of Deep Clustering Models: Adversarial Attacks and Defenses\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe utilize a simple GAN based architecture for generating the adversarial perturbation δ𝛿\\delta and solving the attack problem delineated in the previous section. There are many different variations to using GANs for generating adversarial samples, such as AdvGAN [ref]17, AdvGAN++ [ref]18, WPAdvGAN , CycleAdvGAN , among many others. For our attack, we employ a vanilla GAN architecture consisting of deep neural networks for both the Generator and Discriminator, similar to AdvGAN. We utilize the Generator model 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} to generate the adversarial perturbation δ𝛿\\delta for a given input image Xi∈Xsubscript𝑋𝑖𝑋X_{i}\\in X, i.e., 𝒢​(Xi)→δ→𝒢subscript𝑋𝑖𝛿\\mathcal{G}(X_{i})\\rightarrow\\delta. The Discriminator model 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} plays a similar role as for the original GAN model [ref]16 as it aims to ensure that the perturbed image is similar to the distribution of input images. We then rewrite our attack optimization problem in the context of the GAN architecture. The loss for the attack objective can be written directly as in the optimization problem: And we can simply reformulate the constraint on the norm of the adversarial noise as: We also write the vanilla minimax GAN loss [ref]16 as: To train the Generator 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} and Discriminator 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}, we then optimize these combined losses by solving the following saddle-point problem (where αa,αcsubscript𝛼𝑎subscript𝛼𝑐\\alpha_{a},\\alpha_{c} are hyperparameters to control tradeoff): Upon obtaining the trained Generator 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}, we can generate the adversarial perturbation as δ=𝒢​(Xi)𝛿𝒢subscript𝑋𝑖\\delta=\\mathcal{G}(X_{i}) for any image Xi∈Xsubscript𝑋𝑖𝑋X_{i}\\in X provided as input. We then provide these adversarial images Xi+δsubscript𝑋𝑖𝛿X_{i}+\\delta as input to the pre-trained deep clustering model 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} to obtain cluster membership confidence scores as Mi′=𝒞​(Xi+δ)superscriptsubscript𝑀𝑖′𝒞subscript𝑋𝑖𝛿M_{i}^{\\prime}=\\mathcal{C}(X_{i}+\\delta) after the attack. From Misubscript𝑀𝑖M_{i} we know the original cluster label as Li=arg⁡maxj∈[k]⁡Mi,jsubscript𝐿𝑖subscript𝑗delimited-[]𝑘subscript𝑀𝑖𝑗L_{i}=\\operatorname*{\\arg\\!\\max}_{j\\in[k]}M_{i,j} and similarly, we can obtain the cluster label of the adversarial image as Li′=arg⁡maxj∈[k]⁡Mi,j′superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑖′subscript𝑗delimited-[]𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑀𝑖𝑗′L_{i}^{\\prime}=\\operatorname*{\\arg\\!\\max}_{j\\in[k]}M_{i,j}^{\\prime}. If the optimization problem was solved successfully and the distance between Misubscript𝑀𝑖M_{i} and 𝒞​(Xi+δ)𝒞subscript𝑋𝑖𝛿\\mathcal{C}(X_{i}+\\delta) is sufficiently large enough, we can have Li≠Li′subscript𝐿𝑖superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑖′L_{i}\\neq L_{i}^{\\prime}. Moreover, assuming that a mapping function ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi exists that maps the output cluster labels to the ground truth labeling, we know that: ϕ​(Li)=Yiitalic-ϕsubscript𝐿𝑖subscript𝑌𝑖\\phi(L_{i})=Y_{i}. Since Li≠Li′subscript𝐿𝑖superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑖′L_{i}\\neq L_{i}^{\\prime}, we can conclude that ϕ​(Li′)≠Yiitalic-ϕsuperscriptsubscript𝐿𝑖′subscript𝑌𝑖\\phi(L_{i}^{\\prime})\\neq Y_{i} leading to misclustering and a drop in performance. Remark. Note that since our attack objective is indirectly formulated, it is possible that Misubscript𝑀𝑖M_{i} and Mi′superscriptsubscript𝑀𝑖′M_{i}^{\\prime} are not sufficiently far apart even after the attack, leading to Li=Li′subscript𝐿𝑖superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑖′L_{i}=L_{i}^{\\prime}. However, as we find and our experiments show, this does not happen frequently in practice as our blackbox attack is highly successful at generating adversarial samples that disrupt the performance of all deep clustering models considered in the paper (Section 6.1). We have considered the following open-source deep clustering models in experiments: CC , SPICE , SCAN , MiCE , NNM , RUC .\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: perturbation δ𝛿\\delta and solving the attack problem delineated in the previous section.
