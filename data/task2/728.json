      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting Modified Greedy Algorithm for Monotone Submodular Maximization with a Knapsack Constraint\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA set function f:2V→ℝ:𝑓→superscript2𝑉ℝf\\colon 2^{V}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} is submodular  if for all S,T⊆V𝑆𝑇𝑉S,T\\subseteq V, it holds that Alternatively, defining as the marginal gain of adding an element v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V to a set S⊆V𝑆𝑉S\\subseteq V, an equivalent definition of a submodular set function f𝑓f is that for all S⊆T𝑆𝑇S\\subseteq T and v∈V∖T𝑣𝑉𝑇v\\in V\\setminus T, The latter form of definition describes the concept of diminishing return in economics.\nThe function f𝑓f is monotone nondecreasing if and only if f​(S)≤f​(T)𝑓𝑆𝑓𝑇f(S)\\leq f(T) for all S⊆T𝑆𝑇S\\subseteq T (or equivalently f​(v∣S)≥0𝑓conditional𝑣𝑆0f(v\\mid S)\\geq 0). Many well known combinatorial optimization problems are essentially monotone submodular maximization, such as maximum coverage  , maximum facility location [ref]8 , and maximum entropy sampling  0. In addition, a growing number of problems in real-world applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning are also shown to be monotone submodular maximization. These problems include sensor placement 3 4, feature selection 1 [ref]46, viral marketing  , image segmentation   , document summarization 8 9, data subset selection 2 [ref]43, etc. In this paper, we study monotone submodular maximization with a knapsack constraint, which is defined as follows: where f𝑓f is a monotone nondecreasing submodular set function111We assume that function f𝑓f is normalized, i.e., f​(∅)=0𝑓0f(\\emptyset)=0, and is given via a value oracle., c​(S)=∑v∈Sc​(v)𝑐𝑆subscript𝑣𝑆𝑐𝑣c(S)=\\sum_{v\\in S}c(v) and c​(v)𝑐𝑣c(v) represents the cost of element v𝑣v. Without loss of generality, we may assume that the cost of each element does not exceed b𝑏b, since elements with cost greater than b𝑏b do not belong to any feasible solution.\nThis optimization problem has already found great utility in the aforementioned applications. Since this optimization problem is NP-hard in general, various approximation algorithms have been proposed. For a special cardinality constraint where the costs of all elements are identical, i.e., c​(v)=1𝑐𝑣1c(v)=1 for every element v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V, Nemhauser\net al.  proposed a simple hill-climbing greedy algorithm that can provide (1−1/e)11e(1-1/{\\mathrm{e}})-approximation (we say that an algorithm provides α𝛼\\alpha-approximation, where α≤1𝛼1\\alpha\\leq 1, if it always obtains a solution of value at least α𝛼\\alpha times the value of an optimal solution). However, for the general knapsack constraint, the approximation factor of such a greedy algorithm is unbounded. Wolsey  found that slightly modifying the original greedy algorithm can provide an approximation ratio of (1−1/eβ)≈0.35711superscripte𝛽0.357(1-1/{\\mathrm{e}}^{\\beta})\\approx 0.357, where β𝛽\\beta is the unique root of the equation ex=2−xsuperscripte𝑥2𝑥{\\mathrm{e}}^{x}=2-x. Khuller\net al.  studied the budgeted maximum coverage problem (a special case of monotone submodular maximization with a knapsack constraint where the function value is always an integer), and derived two approximation factors, i.e., (1−1/e)/2≈0.31611e20.316(1-1/{{\\mathrm{e}}})/2\\approx 0.316 and (1−1/e)≈0.39311e0.393(1-1/\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{e}}})\\approx 0.393, for the modified greedy algorithm developed by Wolsey . We note that the factor of (1−1/e)11e(1-1/\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{e}}}) is extensively mentioned in the literature, but unfortunately their proof was flawed as pointed out by Zhang\net al. . It becomes an open question whether the modified greedy algorithm can achieve an approximation ratio at least (1−1/e)11e(1-1/\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{e}}}). Khuller\net al.  also developed a partial enumeration greedy algorithm that improves the approximation factor to (1−1/e)11e(1-1/{\\mathrm{e}}), which was later shown to be applicable to the general problem (1) . However, this algorithm requires O​(n5)𝑂superscript𝑛5O(n^{5}) (where n=|V|𝑛𝑉n=\\lvert V\\rvert is the total number of elements in the ground set V𝑉V) function value computations, which is not scalable. We focus on the scalable modified greedy algorithm of O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2})  and conduct a comprehensive analysis on its worst-case approximation guarantee. Based on the monotonicity and submodularity, we derive several relations governing the solution value and the optimum. Leveraging these relations, we establish an approximation ratio of 0.4050.4050.405, which significantly improves the factors of (1−1/eβ)≈0.35711superscripte𝛽0.357(1-1/{\\mathrm{e}}^{\\beta})\\approx 0.357 given by Wolsey  and (1−1/e)/2≈0.31611e20.316(1-1/{{\\mathrm{e}}})/2\\approx 0.316 given by Khuller\net al. . More importantly, our analysis fills a critical gap in the proof for the factor of (1−1/e)≈0.39311e0.393(1-1/\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{e}}})\\approx 0.393 given by Khuller\net al.  to clarify a long-standing misconception in the literature. In addition, we enhance the modified greedy algorithm to derive a data-dependent upper bound on the optimum. We empirically demonstrate the tightness of our bound with a real-world application of viral marketing in social networks. The bound enables us to obtain a data-dependent ratio typically much higher than 0.4050.4050.405 between the solution value of the modified greedy algorithm and the optimum. It can also be used to significantly improve the efficiency of algorithms such as branch and bound as shown by our experimental evaluations.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: f​(v∣S)≥0𝑓conditional𝑣𝑆0f(v\\mid S)\\geq 0).
