Additionally, let us define ℱ(1:n):={x(1:n),f^(1:n)}assignsuperscriptℱ:1𝑛superscriptx:1𝑛superscript^𝑓:1𝑛\\mathcal{F}^{(1:n)}:=\\{\\textbf{x}^{(1:n)},\\hat{f}^{(1:n)}\\}. We have a Bayesian model on the function and each of its partial derivatives and assume that the GP priors are independent. In what follows, we will first discuss the GP regression for the objective function GP. Since the GP models are independent, the regression for the partial derivative GPs follows along similar lines. To account for noise in the function evaluations, we assume the f^​(𝐱)^𝑓𝐱\\hat{f}({\\bf x}) is normally distributed, i.e., where λ2:ℛ→ℝ:superscript𝜆2→ℛℝ\\lambda^{2}:\\mathcal{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} specifies the noise variance. We also assume that the noise variance is constant across the domain ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}.\nFor specifying the prior, we use the constant mean function μ0∈ℝsubscript𝜇0ℝ\\mu_{0}\\in\\mathbb{R} and the squared exponential function k𝑘k Let the kernel matrix K be defined as and additionally define Ky:=K+λ2​IassignsubscriptK𝑦Ksuperscript𝜆2𝐼\\textbf{K}_{y}:=\\textbf{K}+\\lambda^{2}I.\nThe posterior for the objective function f^^𝑓\\hat{f} at any 𝐱𝐱{\\bf x} [ref]44 is then given by where, Similar expressions can be obtained for the partial derivative GPs as well. Let μi(n)​(𝐱)subscriptsuperscript𝜇𝑛𝑖𝐱\\mu^{(n)}_{i}({\\bf x}) and σi(n)​(𝐱)+λi2subscriptsuperscript𝜎𝑛𝑖𝐱subscriptsuperscript𝜆2𝑖\\sigma^{(n)}_{i}({\\bf x})+\\lambda^{2}_{i} denote the mean and standard deviation of ∂f​(⋅)∂x​(i)𝑓⋅𝑥𝑖\\frac{\\partial f(\\cdot)}{\\partial x(i)} after n𝑛n posterior updates.\nThe variables η={σ2,l,λ2,μ0}𝜂superscript𝜎2𝑙superscript𝜆2subscript𝜇0\\eta=\\{\\sigma^{2},l,~{}\\lambda^{2},\\mu_{0}\\} are referred to as the hyper-parameters of the GP model [ref]44.\nNote that for each choice of these hyper-parameters, we obtain a different prior distribution over the function and one must tune these hyper-parameters so that they are consistent with the observed data. The hyper-parameters can be estimated using either maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), maximum a posteriori (MAP) or a fully Bayesian approach , . In our work, we utilize the MLE approach instead of the Bayesian methods as they require MCMC sampling methods  which are computationally very expensive. MLE involves determining the optimal set of hyper-parameters that maximizes the likelihood of the observed data, i.e., where C=−n2​log⁡2​π𝐶𝑛22𝜋C=-\\frac{n}{2}\\log 2\\pi.\nThis process of determining the best hyper-parameters by maximizing the log likelihood of the data is referred to as “GP fitting”. As a first step, we perform this GP fitting for the function as well the partial derivative GPs using the observed data 𝒟(1:n)superscript𝒟:1𝑛\\mathcal{D}^{(1:n)}. Using the optimal hyper-parameters, we then obtain the posterior GP models using (1).\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: K be defined as and additionally define Ky:=K+λ2​IassignsubscriptK𝑦Ksuperscript𝜆2𝐼\\textbf{K}_{y}:=\\textbf{K}+\\lambda^{2}I.\nThe posterior for the objective function f^^𝑓\\hat{f} at any 𝐱𝐱{\\bf x} [ref]44 is then given by where, Similar expressions can be obtained for the partial derivative GPs as well.
