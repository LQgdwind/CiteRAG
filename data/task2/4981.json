      "content": "Paper Title: Behavioral Intention Prediction in Driving Scenes: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nParameter Conditioning Prototype for trajectory prediction usually models the intent as extra information to re-weight or re-constrain the trajectory distribution sampling function   [ref]201. The Conditional VAE (CVAE) models [ref]202 defined as follows are commonly adopted. where pθ​(𝐳i|𝐱i)subscript𝑝𝜃conditionalsubscript𝐳𝑖subscript𝐱𝑖p_{\\theta}({\\bf{z}}_{i}|{\\bf{x}}_{i}) denotes the conditional independence of the latent variables 𝐳isubscript𝐳𝑖{\\bf{z}}_{i} under the agent observation 𝐱i∈𝐗subscript𝐱𝑖𝐗{\\bf{x}}_{i}\\in{\\bf{X}}. Commonly, the intention is encoded in pθ​(𝐳i|𝐱i)subscript𝑝𝜃conditionalsubscript𝐳𝑖subscript𝐱𝑖p_{\\theta}({\\bf{z}}_{i}|{\\bf{x}}_{i}), where the other conditions, such as interaction and road scene knowledge may also be encoded.\nEuro-PVI [ref]203 models the interactive intention between the surrounding objects and ego-vehicles (e.g., yielding, decelerating, and crossing, etc.), and develops a Joint-β𝛽\\beta-CVAE to conduct the trajectory prediction, where the interaction intention is encoded as the latent variables in the CVAE formulation. The results verify that involving the interactive intention between pedestrians and vehicles could significantly reduce the ADE and FDE values. Sun et al.  also propose a CVAE model to jointly predict the intended goals and trajectories, which embeds the predicted goals and the interaction of agents with a Multiple layers Perception (MLP) at each time step. Recent work LOKI  treats the intended goals as a condition for scene graph construction, where the outputs of a Goal Proposal Network (GPN) and the agent intention prediction model are added to decode future trajectories, as shown in Fig. 11(c). Recently, the trajectory prediction of vehicles in highway scenarios usually takes the parameter conditioning prototype. For example, Gao et al.  propose a dual Transformer to encode the past trajectories and interactive information, and decode the future Lane Changing (LC) intention. Then, the predicted LC intention probability is fed into the feature of past trajectories for the subsequent trajectory prediction. Compared with the naive Transformer, the Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) value for future predicted trajectories is reduced by 7.52% and 27.3% on the NGSIM and HighD datasets, respectively . Do et al.  take the LC intention as a prior for future trajectory prediction. Differently, they initialize the path generation step by a cubic spline curve in the Frenet Coordinate System (FCS), then predict the LC intention and future trajectories by a dynamic estimation of path probabilities. Besides, other parameter-based intention prediction models, such as the Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN)     , are also explored. As for the deep learning era, the framework of DBN will be popular, where the feature extraction of the inference model may be fulfilled by deep learning modules. The work  firstly predicts the vehicle intention on the BEV sequence by a CNN model with the binary cross-entropy loss, and then fuses the predicted intent to the trajectory prediction with a multi-head attention decoder model. Ma et al.  propose a continual multi-agent behavior prediction work, which designs an episodic memory buffer and a conditionally generative memory to capture the historical interaction trajectories with the labeling of goal position and interaction intention. Wu et al.  fuse the pedestrians' behavior, intention, and scene context together to tackle the trajectory prediction problem. The pedestrian intention is inferred by DBN with the variables for the existence of the crossing area, waiting time, distance to curb, etc. The pedestrian crossing intention is treated as a bool variable to change the trajectory sampling function. In some works, the researchers fuse the intention and trajectory prediction as a sequential prediction problem, where the predicted trajectories are also useful for the intention prediction tasks. For example, Saleh et al.   predict the long-term intention of pedestrians by a stacked LSTM over the trajectory points. Discussion: Multi-task learning and parameter conditioning prototypes in BIP-aware trajectory prediction become popular recently. From the task jointing strategy for BIP-aware trajectory prediction, the cross-entropy loss is commonly utilized to optimize the BIP task. In the multi-task learning prototype, the parameters of modules on two tasks commonly share the weights. Contrarily, the parameter conditioning prototypes usually have separate weight sets. Explainability still is a core issue in the multi-task learning prototype. The parameter conditioning prototype seems to be appropriate because of the flexible dynamic networks and can provide a parameterized explainability for information importance modeling. Certainly, the parameter conditioning prototype can also involve multi-task learning to optimize the models.\n\nReference markers found: [201]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]201: Parameter Conditioning Prototype for trajectory prediction usually models the intent as extra information to re-weight or re-constrain the trajectory distribution sampling function   [ref]201.
