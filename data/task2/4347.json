We follow the recipe introduced in Zhou et al. , and reproduce gradient norm bounds for when the network is a GNN. From Lemma B.3 Cao and Gu [ref]10, we get ∥𝒈GNN​(Gi;𝜽0)∥2≤C¯​m​Lsubscriptdelimited-∥∥subscript𝒈GNNsubscript𝐺𝑖superscript𝜽02¯𝐶𝑚𝐿\\left\\lVert{\\bm{g}}_{\\mathrm{GNN}}(G_{i};{\\bm{\\theta}}^{0})\\right\\rVert_{2}\\leq\\bar{C}\\sqrt{mL} with probability of at least 1−δ/31𝛿31-\\delta/3. By the definition of Frobenius norm, it follows, For Eq. C.32 we may write, with probability greater than 1−δ/31𝛿31-\\delta/3, where the next to last inequality holds by Lemma B.5 Zhou et al.  and the last inequality follows directly from Lemma B.6 Zhou et al. . As for Eq. C.33, by definition of the single-BLOCK GNN and Lemma B.4 Zhou et al. , with probability greater than 1−δ/31𝛿31-\\delta/3.\n∎ Let the sequence (𝛉~(j))superscript~𝛉𝑗(\\tilde{\\bm{\\theta}}^{(j)}) denote the gradient descent updates on the following loss function, then if m=poly​(T,L,B,|𝒢|,λ0−1,λ−1,log⁡(N/δ))𝑚poly𝑇𝐿𝐵𝒢superscriptsubscript𝜆01superscript𝜆1𝑁𝛿m={\\rm poly}(T,L,B,|{\\mathcal{G}}|,\\lambda_{0}^{-1},\\lambda^{-1},\\log(N/\\delta)) and the learning rate η≤C​(m​L+m​λ)−1𝜂𝐶superscript𝑚𝐿𝑚𝜆1\\eta\\leq C(mL+m\\lambda)^{-1} This lemma adapts Lemma D.8 Kassraie and Krause  to our setting. We repeat the proof for the sake of completeness. Note that ℒ~~ℒ\\tilde{\\mathcal{L}} is m​λ𝑚𝜆m\\lambda-strongly convex, and C​(m​L+m​λ)𝐶𝑚𝐿𝑚𝜆C(mL+m\\lambda)-smooth,\nsince where the second inequality follows from Lemma C.7. Strong Convexity of ℒ~~ℒ\\tilde{\\mathcal{L}} guarantees a monotonic decrease of the loss if the learning rate is smaller than the smoothness coefficient inversed. Therefore, From the RKHS assumption, the true reward is bounded by B𝐵B and hence the last inequality follows since the size of the training set is t𝑡t. Gradient descent on smooth and strongly convex functions converges to optima if the learning rate is smaller than the smoothness coefficient inversed. Under this condition the minima of ℒ~~ℒ\\tilde{\\mathcal{L}} is unique and has the closed form Having set η≤C​(m​L+m​λ)−1𝜂𝐶superscript𝑚𝐿𝑚𝜆1\\eta\\leq C(mL+m\\lambda)^{-1}, we get that 𝜽~(j)superscript~𝜽𝑗\\tilde{\\bm{\\theta}}^{(j)} converges to 𝜽~∗superscript~𝜽\\tilde{\\bm{\\theta}}^{*} with the following exponential rate, ∎ Let the sequence 𝛉(J)superscript𝛉𝐽{\\bm{\\theta}}^{(J)} denote the J𝐽J-th gradient descent update on the GNN loss, If m=poly​(T,L,B,|𝒢|,λ0−1,λ−1,log⁡(N/δ))𝑚poly𝑇𝐿𝐵𝒢superscriptsubscript𝜆01superscript𝜆1𝑁𝛿m={\\rm poly}(T,L,B,|{\\mathcal{G}}|,\\lambda_{0}^{-1},\\lambda^{-1},\\log(N/\\delta)) and η≤C​(m​L+m​λ)−1𝜂𝐶superscript𝑚𝐿𝑚𝜆1\\eta\\leq C(mL+m\\lambda)^{-1} for some C𝐶C, then with probability greater than 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta, Following Zhou et al.  we introduce the sequence (𝜽~(j))superscript~𝜽𝑗(\\tilde{\\bm{\\theta}}^{(j)}) which denotes the gradient descent updates on the following proxy loss, By Lemma C.8, It remains to show that ‖𝜽(J)−𝜽~(J)‖2≤B/m​λsubscriptnormsuperscript𝜽𝐽superscript~𝜽𝐽2𝐵𝑚𝜆||{\\bm{\\theta}}^{(J)}-\\tilde{\\bm{\\theta}}^{(J)}||_{2}\\leq\\sqrt{B/m\\lambda}, which concludes the proof due to triangle inequality. By writing out the gradient descent updates of the two sequences we get, We bound each term separately. In the rest of the proof, Lemma C.7 is always used with τ=B/m​λ𝜏𝐵𝑚𝜆\\tau=\\sqrt{B/m\\lambda}. Lemma C.3 Zhou et al.  directly holds for fGNNsubscript𝑓GNNf_{\\mathrm{GNN}}, and states that ‖𝒇GNN(j)−𝒚‖2≤(B+1)​tsubscriptnormsuperscriptsubscript𝒇GNN𝑗𝒚2𝐵1𝑡||{\\bm{f}}_{\\mathrm{GNN}}^{(j)}-{\\bm{y}}||_{2}\\leq(B+1)\\sqrt{t}. Then Eq. C.32 Lemma C.7 gives, Recall that fGNN​(G;𝜽0)=0subscript𝑓GNN𝐺superscript𝜽00f_{\\mathrm{GNN}}(G;{\\bm{\\theta}}^{0})=0 by design. Then for the second term, using Equations C.31 and C.33 from Lemma C.7, As for the last term, first note that by Eq. C.31 Lemma C.7, with high probability where the last inequality holds since η𝜂\\eta is chosen to be small enough. Therefore, We put the three terms back together and unroll the recursive inequality. Then if m𝑚m is picked to be large enough at the above stated polynomial rate, ∎ The next lemma shows that the first order approximation of a GNN at initialization can still describe the network after it has been trained with gradient descent for J𝐽J steps.

By Lemma 4.1 Cao and Gu [ref]10, if m=poly​(T,L,B,|𝒢|,λ0−1,λ−1,log⁡(1/δ))𝑚poly𝑇𝐿𝐵𝒢superscriptsubscript𝜆01superscript𝜆11𝛿m={\\rm poly}(T,L,B,|{\\mathcal{G}}|,\\lambda_{0}^{-1},\\lambda^{-1},\\log(1/\\delta)) and η𝜂\\eta is set according to the statement of the lemma, then for a fixed 𝒙𝒙{\\bm{x}} with probability greater than 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta, where ∥𝜽(J)−𝜽0∥2≤τsubscriptdelimited-∥∥superscript𝜽𝐽superscript𝜽02𝜏\\left\\lVert{\\bm{\\theta}}^{(J)}-{\\bm{\\theta}}^{0}\\right\\rVert_{2}\\leq\\tau.

Setting δ←δ/2​N←𝛿𝛿2𝑁\\delta\\leftarrow\\delta/2N and applying the union bound gives Therefore, if m=poly(T,L,B,|𝒢|,λ0−1,λ−1,log(N/δ)))m={\\rm poly}(T,L,B,|{\\mathcal{G}}|,\\lambda_{0}^{-1},\\lambda^{-1},\\log(N/\\delta))) with probability greater than 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta, It remains to bound ‖𝜽(J)−𝜽0‖2subscriptnormsuperscript𝜽𝐽superscript𝜽02||{\\bm{\\theta}}^{(J)}-{\\bm{\\theta}}^{0}||_{2} in order to calculate η𝜂\\eta in Equation C.34.

Setting δ←δ/T←𝛿𝛿𝑇\\delta\\leftarrow\\delta/T and taking a union bound over all t≤T𝑡𝑇t\\leq T concludes the proof. Note that the added log⁡T𝑇\\log T term from union bound does not change rate for m𝑚m, since it is already growing polynomially with T𝑇T.\n∎\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: We follow the recipe introduced in Zhou et al. , and reproduce gradient norm bounds for when the network is a GNN.
