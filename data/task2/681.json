      "content": "Paper Title: The Impact of Distance on Performance and Scalability of Distributed Database Systems in Hybrid Clouds\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare our work in this paper with the state-of-the-art studies in two categories: Performance evaluation of distributed databases deployed on cloud computing, and the impact of distance on data-intensive applications performance. Performance evaluation of distributed databases on cloud computing:\nBy flourishing NoSQL databases in 2011, several of them including MongoDB, Cassandra, Riak, CouchDB, Riak, Redis, and Hbase are the center of studies . As stated in the literature, these databases outperform the relational databases in performance and scalability, making them more popular for use within private or public cloud datacenters. The performance evaluation of NoSQL databases is supported through using the Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) [ref]8 that allows to measure throughput and latency of read, write, insert, update, delete, and scan operations. Initially, Cooper et al. [ref]8 used this benchmark to measure the performance of Cassandra, Hbase, MySQL, and PNUTS . Later, since 2012, researchers leveraged this benchmark to make comparison between NoSQL and relational databases deployed on cloud computing from performance and scalability perspectives . Abramova et al.  compared MongoDB and Cassandra in terms of their features and capabilities using YCSB. MongoDB is affected by high workloads, whereas Cassandra seemed to experience performance boosts with the increasing amounts of data. Also, Cassandra outperforms MongoDB in update operations. Veen et al.  made a comparison between MongoDB and Cassandra and concluded also that MongoDB provides high throughput as it is deployed in a single server. Klein et al.  evaluated MongoDB and Cassandra with non-default setting parameters to measure throughput, latency for read and write operations. Rable et al.  conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance and scalability of Cassandra, Hbase, Redis, Voldemort, VoltDB, and MySQL. Kuhlenkamp et al.  carried out a large experiment to measure scalability and elasticity of Cassandra and HBase deployed within a public cloud datacenter. As summarized in Table 1, different from our work, all these studies (except in our work ) evaluate the performance of distributed databases on either a private or a public cloud datacenter. Recently, we have evaluated throughput performance of distributed databases on a hybrid cloud without considering distance between private and public clouds involved in a hybrid cloud agreement model . Several studies have used NoSQL databases to evaluate their applicability to different IT domains. Bastiao et al.  leveraged MongoDB and CouchDB in the healthcare domain. They observed that there is no difference between these two databases in performance, and concluded NoSQL databases still should be improved. Lourenco et al.  evaluated Cassandra, CouchDB and MongoDB for a write-intensive application. The results revealed that Cassandra is better than the other NoSQL databases for a four-node setup, while a MS SQL Server running on a single node outperformed all NoSQL contenders for these specific settings. Rith et al.  implemented a layer to translate SQL queries to NoSQL ones for MongoDB and Cassandra, moving from relational to non-relational databases. None of these studies has investigated the impact of distance between cloud datacenters making up a hybrid cloud for the performance, scalability and VM packing (i.e., VMs number vs. VMs flavour) of distributed databases. Some researchers have evaluated their proposed algorithms, policies and methods through simulation and implementation for a hybrid cloud. Toosi et al.  has recently configured a hybrid cloud including Microsoft Azure and two PC workers to analyze the proposed resource provisioning algorithms. Using the same configuration for the hybrid cloud with different VM size though, Tuli et al.  evaluated several resource provisioning and task scheduling algorithms. Calheiros et al.  and Vecchiola et al.  provided almost similar setup to evaluate an algorithm leveraging dynamic resources to meet the deadline constraint for Bag-of-Tasks (BoTs). Li et al. [ref]15 designed a cost-aware job scheduling approach based on the queuing theory in hybrid clouds. Differently, Loreti et al.  implemented a software layer on top of a hybrid cloud infrastructure to dynamically deploy and scale virtual clusters. Zhou et al.  proposed an approach to optimize the monetary cost of workflow scheduling with constrained time. They extended this approach to minimize the execution time of tasks within constrained time and budget. Our work is different with these studies as they have implemented scheduling algorithms to complete tasks within a constrained time and budget for BoT applications in a simulated or implemented hybrid cloud environment. Impact of distance on data-intensive applications performance:\nUser-perceived latency for database operations (e.g., read, write, delete, update or create, etc.) is a vital criterion at the database level. Latency for these operations can be impacted from network congestion, overloaded computing infrastructure, and the distance between the location of requests issued from, and the location of data stored. How to reduce network latency was well-studied in literature, and there are several simple solutions. They are varying from data replication , requests iteration  to more powerful hardware resources. Obviously, these solutions are more effective if a public cloud datacenter with a proper distance is selected to be paired with the private one as experimentally observed in a study . All studies stated above did not investigate the impact of distance between cloud datacenters involving in the hybrid cloud on the performance and horizontal/vertical scalability of distributed databases. This investigation is our main contribution in this study.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: making them more popular for use within private or public cloud datacenters.
