      "content": "Paper Title: Pruning and Quantization for Deep Neural Network Acceleration: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSection 4 discusses quantization techniques. It describes binarized quantized neural networks, and reduced precision networks, along with their training methods. We described low-bit dataset validation techniques and results. We also list the accuracy of popular quantization frameworks and described hardware implementations in Section 4.3. Quantization usually results in a loss of accuracy due to information lost during the quantization process. This is particularly evident on compact networks. Most of the early low bit quantization approaches only compare performance on small datasets (e.g., MNIST, and CIFAR-10)  [ref]94   [ref]235 . However, observations showed that some quantized networks could outperform the original network (see: Section 4.4).\nAdditionally, non-uniform distribution data may lead to further deterioration in quantization performance . Sometimes this can be ameliorated by normalization in fine-tuning  or by non-linear quantization (e.g., log representation) . Advanced quantization techniques have improved accuracy. Asymmetric quantization  maintains higher dynamic range by using a zero point in addition to a regular scale parameter. Overheads introduced by the zero point were minimized by pipelining the processing unit. Calibration based quantization  removed zero points and replaced them with precise scales obtained from a calibrating dataset. Quantization-aware training was shown to further improve quantization accuracy. 8-bit quantization is widely applied in practice as a good trade-off between accuracy and compression. It can easily be deployed on current processors and custom hardware. Minimal accuracy loss is experienced especially when quantization-aware training is enabled.\nBinarized networks have also achieved reasonable accuracy with specialized hardware designs.\n Though BN has advantages to help training and pruning, an issue with BN is that it may require a large dynamic range across a single layer kernel or between different channels. This may make layer-wise quantization more difficult. Because of this per channel quantization is recommended . To achieve better accuracy following quantization, we recommend: Use asymmetrical quantization. It preserves flexibility over the quantization range even though it has computational overheads . Quantize the weights rather than the activations. Activation is more sensitive to numerical precision . Do not quantize biases. They do not require significant storage. High precision biases in all layers , and first/last layers  [ref]272, maintain higher network accuracy. Quantize kernels channel-wise instead of layer-wise to significantly improve accuracy . Fine-tune the quantized model. It reduces the accuracy gap between the quantized model and the real-valued model . Initially train using a 32-bit floating point model. Low-bit quantized model can be difficult to train from scratch - especially compact models on large-scaled data-sets [ref]272. The sensitivity of quantization is ordered as gradients, activations, and then weights [ref]272. Stochastic quantization of gradients is necessary when training quantized models  [ref]272.\n\nReference markers found: [94]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]94: the quantization process.
