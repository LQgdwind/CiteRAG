Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: Sparse and Continuous Attention Mechanisms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe used the VQA-v2 dataset [ref]31 with the standard splits (443K, 214K, and 453K question-image pairs for train/dev/test, the latter subdivided into test-dev, test-standard, test-challenge and test-reserve). We adapted the implementation of [ref]32,101010https://github.com/MILVLG/mcan-vqa consisting of a Modular Co-Attention Network (MCAN). Our architecture is the same as [ref]32 except that we represent the image input with grid features generated by a ResNet [ref]54 pretrained on ImageNet , instead of bounding-box features .\nThe images are resized to 448×448448448448\\times 448 before going through the ResNet that outputs a feature map of size 14×14×20481414204814\\times 14\\times 2048. To represent the input question words we use 300-dimensional GloVe word embeddings , yielding a question feature matrix representation. Table 5 shows the hyperparameters used for all the VQA experiments presented. All the models we experimented with use the same features and were trained only on the train set without data augmentation.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: We used the VQA-v2 dataset [ref]31 with the standard splits (443K, 214K, and 453K question-image pairs for train/dev/test, the latter subdivided into test-dev, test-standard, test-challenge and test-reserve).

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
