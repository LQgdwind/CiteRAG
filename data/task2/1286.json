      "content": "Paper Title: A Pseudo-labelling Auto-Encoder for unsupervised image classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClassification is one of the most important tasks in deep learning. It consists of identifying a trait in the input and assigning a label to it. The input could be an image, a video, a simple vector of values or else. Classification has many useful and valuable applications such as spam detection , disease identification , particle discovery [ref]3 etc. Current deep learning technics are able to achieve outstanding performance on this task using supervised learning. However, the efficacy of these methods depends on the presence of labeled data which is very scarce. For this aim, the development of unsupervised and semi-supervised methods has seen an increasing interest. In order to benefit from the sheer amount of available unlabelled data, a lot of work has been done to improve the performance of deep learning models in the unsupervised learning context. Among these methods, in [ref]4 it is proposed to concatenate the output of some of the convolutional layers of the GAN’s discriminator (Generative Adverserial Network) and pass them through a linear classifier to infer the class of the input images. In the work of [ref]5, a Stacked Capsule Auto-Encoder has been used to break down an image into multiple objects. Then, according to the present objects in a scene, the class of the image can be deduced. Auto-Encoders are neural networks that are trained to attempt to reconstruct the input that is presented to them and construct an internal representation of it . They have been used to different ends among them modelling , de-noising  and more. The work of  explored the use of Auto-Encoders to do unsupervised image classification and optimised the architecture of the network using the Genetic Algorithm. This work obtained satisfactory results on the MNIST dataset where 96.32% accuracy has been achieved with an optimised Auto-Encoder that has fully connected layers. Conventionally, Auto-Encoders use a pixel-wise loss function to calculate the difference between the input and the output. Thus, the pixel-wise loss does not take into consideration the dependencies between the neighbouring pixels of an image. To solve this problem, the perceptual loss was introduced by A. B. L. Larsen & al. in 0. Its importance and impact have been evaluated for image reconstruction and generation where it demonstrated great potential. The perceptual loss uses a pre-trained model to capture the dependencies between the pixels of an image then applies the loss function to the output of this model. The work of 1 explored the effect of the perceptual loss on the embeddings produced by the encoder in the task of object positioning and image classification. It has been found that the perceptual loss enriches the encodings produced w.r.t the semantic class of the input. Big improvements in terms of classification accuracy have been noticed over not using the perceptual loss. Similarly, the use of data augmentation has been shown as a powerful technique to improve the generalisation capabilities on neural networks in a supervised learning context 2. Data augmentation is a technique where alterations are introduced into the training data in order to improve its diversity and allow the network to see the data from different perspectives during the training phase. In the recent work of T. Chen & al. 3 data augmentation was one of the most important ideas that allowed obtaining state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, surpassing the accuracy of neural networks having done the learning phase in a supervised manner. In the work of 3, data augmentation is applied to an image twice and then encoded using a large pre-trained model. The weights of the network are then refined so that the encodings of the image are the same regardless of the applied data augmentations. Despite the effectiveness of data augmentation in the supervised and the semi-supervised contexts, this technique’s effect on the embeddings produced by an Auto-Encoder in the unsupervised image classification task has not been explored yet, notably when used in conjunction with the perceptual loss. In this work, we aim to explore this combination. To this end, we found that incorporating data augmentation in a simple way where the Auto-Encoder reconstructs its input, which is an image with data augmentation, does not improve the embeddings produced. As a result, we introduce an effective method for the integration of data augmentation called the Pseudo-Labelling method. This method is a variant of a denoising Auto-Encoder and consists of creating a correspondance between data augmented images and the original image (see Figure 1). Combining the proposed method with an Auto-Encoder trained with the perceptual loss results in improvements in both the stability and the accuracy of the unsupervised classification. Consequently, the proposed method incorporates data augmentation in a way that forces the encoder to better understand the input, look past the alterations applied and create more concise encodings. Subsequently, we summarise our contributions in this work as follow: We emphasise the improvements that the perceptual loss brings when compared to a simple Auto-encoder w.r.t the unsupervised images classification accuracy. We propose a novel combination of a variant of a denoising Auto-Encoder and the perceptual loss called Pseudo-Labelling that leads the encoder to improve the quality of the outputted embeddings w.r.t unsupervised image classification. We compare positively the performance of the Pseudo-Labelling method to 8 different unsupervised learning methods including Auto-Encoder and none Auto-Encoder based methods [ref]4 [ref]5 1 4 5 6 7. The outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we present the basic concepts of the Auto-Encoders then we detail the main idea of Auto-Encoders trained using the perceptual loss. In Section 3, we deal with the data augmentation method applied to images. Section 4 introduces two different ways of incorporating data augmentation in an Auto-Encoder that is trained using the perceptual loss. The first one uses data augmentation in a simple way, whereas the second one (the Pseudo-Labelling method) harnesses data augmentation in a beneficial way that urges the network to learn better encodings. In Section 5, we present the results of our experiments. Section 6 compares the work presented in this paper with a variety of Auto-Encoder and none Auto-Encoder based methods in the task of unsupervised image classification. Our conclusions and perspectives for future work are presented in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: The input could be an image, a video, a simple vector of values or else.
