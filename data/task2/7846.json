      "content": "Paper Title: Set Descriptive Complexity of Solvable Functions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this work we have expanded the study of solvable functions as introduced in our recent papers , . Specifically, we provided a ranking for the class of solvable functions that naturally translates to solvable dynamical systems in the form of IVPs ruled by solvable ODEs. With Proposition 8 we showed that for each countable ordinal, there exists at least one solvable function with ranking equal to such ordinal, therefore formally proving one of the intuitive claims of , . Indeed, starting from the functions discussed in Proposition 8 and built with the help of Definition 12, it is trivial to describe solvable IVPs in higher dimensions with the same ranking by using techniques similar to the one employed in Example 1. Hence, this proves that the hierarchy of solvable IVPs introduced by our ranking is indeed fully populated, as already envisioned (albeit only in an intuitive manner) in , . Moreover, by limiting the scope of our ranking to the case of one-dimensional solvable functions, we illustrated several properties and comparisons with other rankings for differentiable functions presented in the literature. More precisely, we demonstrated that the set of one-dimensional solvable functions is a coanalytic subset of the space of continuous functions, and the solvable ranking introduces a coanalytic norm over such a subset. Moreover, we showed with Theorem 4 that the solvable ranking dominates the Kechris-Woodin ranking, consequently dominating also the Denjoy ranking and the Zalcwasser ranking due to known results from . Finally, an insightful implication of the results of this paper is the following fact: solving analytically IVPs involving discontinuous ODEs requires the totality of the countable ordinals, similarly to what has been already proved by  for the case of Denjoy integration. To conclude, we outline three relevant possible directions for future work: The analysis of the set descriptive complexity of solvable functions performed in this paper could be further developed in another direction by considering its lightface complexity (i.e.¬†constructivity). This could mean producing a finer-grained investigation on the complexity of each level of the hierarchy inspired by the existing treatments for differentiability and Denjoy integration described in  and  respectively. One interesting question to address could be proving that the set of solvable functions S‚ÄãVùëÜùëâSV is a ùö∑11superscriptsubscriptùö∑11\\boldsymbol{\\Pi}_{1}^{1} complete subset of C‚Äã( )ùê∂01C( ) as it is the case for ùíüùíü\\mathcal{D}. One possible way to prove such a statement could be to provide a one-to-one reduction of S‚ÄãVùëÜùëâSV to the set of well-founded trees W‚ÄãFùëäùêπWF such as the one described for ùíüùíü\\mathcal{D} in 5. Practically, this means designing, in addition to the Borel encoding of well-founded trees into solvable functions produced by Definition 12, a similar encoding for the other direction, i.e.¬†from solvable functions to well-founded trees. Nonetheless, one difficulty to overcome to achieve such encoding is that every solvable function is also a differentiable function, and so the tree description of a solvable function needs to include a tree description of differentiability (such as the one in 5) as well as the extra condition of solvability. Finally, having proved that the hierarchy of solvable IVPs introduced by our ranking is fully populated, an interesting next step could be to make use of the IVP described in Example 2 as a building block to produce, for each hyperarithmetical real, a simulation using a solvable IVP that reaches such real. This could be done by rescaling and composing the dynamics used in Example 2 in the spirit of continuous-time ODEs simulations presented in [ref]3. A similar achievement could represent the equivalent of what has already been obtained in  for Denjoy integration, producing a description for the lightface descriptive complexity of solvable function alternative to the one mentioned in point 1 of this list. Such investigation could therefore yield a continuous-time, dynamical characterization of ordinal computing using systems of discontinuous ODEs.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: a simulation using a solvable IVP that reaches such real.
