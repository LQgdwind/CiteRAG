      "content": "Paper Title: Hard-ODT: Hardware-Friendly Online Decision Tree Learning Algorithm and System\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDecision tree algorithms are a popular class of machine learning algorithm and have been deployed in many real scenarios   [ref]3, especially when multiple decision trees are combined into powerful ensemble models, such as XGBoost  and random forests . Recently, the ensemble of decision trees as deep forests  has been reported to produce comparable performance compared to deep neural networks. However, there are several drawbacks that limit the full exploitation of the traditional decision trees (e.g., IDT3 , CART  and C4.5 ). The first drawback is the extensive memory consumption during the training process, which is proportional to the size of datasets. Classic decision tree learners assume that the complete datasets can be preloaded before training starts. This reduces their capability to train with large-scale datasets, especially when, nowadays, large amount of data is being generated daily. The second disadvantage comes with the learners’ inability to adapt themselves to new data once the training process is terminated. In the era of big data, the size of datasets is no longer the bottleneck of learning algorithms. Instead, the ability to effectively learn from massive data and rationally make use of incoming data becomes more fundamental and critical. To broaden the applicability of decision tree algorithms, extensions from traditional tree algorithms to batch learning and online learning (or so-called incremental learning) have been studied, which aim at adapting the models to incoming data without losing previously learned knowledge. One of the state-of-the-art online learning methods for streaming data is the Hoeffding tree 0 algorithm and its variants 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. The Hoeffding tree presents an enhancement of the decision tree induction algorithm which leverages the accumulated samples to estimate the complete datasets statistically. It is capable of performing training and inference concurrently. The Hoeffding tree is widely used in various application scenarios 9 0 1 2. While efficient software implementation has been investigated for processors to accelerate the Hoeffding tree 2 3, there are still many hindrances to the compact implementation and optimization of the Hoeffding tree design from the hardware perspective. We identify two principal challenges limiting Hoeffding tree implementation in hardware: 1) the high cost of memory usage to store the required subset of samples as well as characteristics in each leaf node; and 2) the high computational demand with dependency and long latency between iterations in the learning process, which can hamper efficient data processing with optimization schemes such as parallelism and pipelining. Furthermore, we observe a trade-off between the above two factors in the state-of-the-art designs: the methods in 3 and 4, attempting to reduce the memory usage, tend to extensively increase the computational intensity and latency, and vice versa, as in the proposed methods of 1 and 2. The high and unbalanced need of memory and computation makes the existing approaches difficult to efficiently implement in hardware, especially on FPGAs where memory and digital signal processing (DSP) resources are both limited. Motivated by the above challenges and observations, we seek opportunities to implement and optimize the Hoeffding tree in a hardware-friendly and scalable way, and also strive to make use of resources in a more balanced manner. In this paper, we propose Hard-ODT, the first implementation of the Hoeffding tree learning system on FPGA, with the following contributions: We first introduce a quantile-based algorithm for Hoeffding tree induction, which uses light-weight computation and constant memory, while preserving high accuracy. We present hardware optimization techniques dedicated to the proposed algorithm, in order to achieve high hardware efficiency and scalability. These includes different levels of parallelism, dynamic and memory-based resource sharing, and pipelining with data forwarding. We investigate optimization techniques for tree growing, categorical attribute learning and split judgment to establish the complete online decision tree system on FPGA. We model performance and resource utilization for the proposed online decision tree learning system on FPGA for fast evaluation of the critical design metrics. We develop a design flow to apply the proposed online learning system to FPGA run-time power monitoring.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Decision tree algorithms are a popular class of machine learning algorithm and have been deployed in many real scenarios   [ref]3, especially when multiple decision trees are combined into powerful ensemble models, such as XGBoost  and random forests .
