      "content": "Paper Title: High-Order Pooling for Graph Neural Networks with Tensor Decomposition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we present tGNN performance on node- and graph-level tasks. We compare tGNN with several classic baseline models under the same training setting. For three citation networks, we compare tGNN with several baselines including GCN , GAT 5, GraphSAGE 9, H2GCN [ref]54, GPRGNN , APPNP  and MixHop ; for three OGB node datasets, we compare tGNN with MLP, Node2vec 7, GCN , GraphSAGE 9 and DeeperGCN .\nAnd for graph-level tasks, we compare tGNN with several baselines including MLP, GCN , GIN , DiffPool , GAT 5, MoNet , GatedGCN , PNA 3, PHMGNN  and DGN . The model choice is because we propose a new pooling method and want to mainly compare tGNN with other poolings in standard GNN architectures. Current leading models on OGB leaderboards  adopt transformer, equivariant, fingerprint, C&S, or others, which are more complex than standard GNNs.\nWe visualize the performance boost and comparisons with GNNs and pooling techniques in Tab. 1,3. From Tab. 1, we can observe that tGNN outperforms all classic baselines on Cora, Pubmed, PRODUCTS and ARXIV, and have slight improvements on the other datasets but underperforms GCN on Citeseer and DeeperGCN on PROTEINS. On the citation networks, tGNN outperforms others on 2 out of 3 datasets. Moreover, on the OGB node datasets, even when tGNN\nis not ranked first, it is still very competitive (top 3 for all\ndatasets). We believe it is reasonable and expected that tGNN does not outperform all methods\non all datasets. But overall tGNN shows very competitive performance and deliver significant improvement on challenging graph benchmarks compared to popular commonly used pooling methods (with comparable computational cost). In Tab. 3, we present tGNN performance on graph property prediction tasks. tGNN achieves state-of-the-arts results on MolHIV, and have slight improvements on other three Benchmarking graph datasets. Overall tGNN achieves more effective and accurate results on 5 out of 10 datasets comparing with existing pooling techniques, which suggests that high-order CP pooling can leverage a GNN to generalize better node embeddings and graph representations.\n\nReference markers found: [54]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]54: We compare tGNN with several classic baseline models under the same training setting.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
