      "content": "Paper Title: MAGNet: Multi-Region Attention-Assisted Grounding of Natural Language Queries at Phrase Level\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject detection has been the bread and butter of computer vision with the recent advances in deep learning leading to super-human performances in terms of accuracy and speed  .\nA variation of the object detection task is visual grounding where the objective is to detect objects/regions of interests in the image referenced by a descriptive phrase instead of a pre-defined set of classes. The visual grounding task can have various specific objectives: (a) Phrase localization  : The language query is a local phrase from a caption describing an image such that an image region linked to the phrase may or may not be independent of the broader context of the full caption. This makes the queries inherently ambiguous. (b) Referring expression   [ref]7 [ref]8 : the query is an expression referring to a particular region of an image. It is less ambiguous. (c) Natural language object retrieval 0 1: a query is used to retrieve images from a set of images. (d) Visual question answering 2 3 4: a query is in the form of a question and the image region is the associated answer. In this paper, we will mainly focus on the tasks (a) and (b).\nRecently, various approaches have been developed to solve the above-mentioned specific tasks. Most state-of-art visual grounding systems have a two-stage framework  [ref]7 [ref]8 5 6 7 8 which rely on an explicit pre-trained object detector to obtain proposed object bounding boxes and rank their ROI-pooled features based on the encoded feature obtained from the query. This essentially limits these systems to a fixed set of object classes that the detector was trained on. One-stage approaches 9 0 1 2 adopt object detection frameworks to generate image features of all possible regions and fuse them with separately encoded features for the query (proposal-level visual-textual fusion) to rank them. Such proposal-level fusion doesn‚Äôt build an understanding of the whole image in relation to the phrase query. Some datasets  also provide annotations in addition to the query such as class, attribute, etc. described by the query and thus are used in various works [ref]8 0 3. This makes them dependent on the information provided by the dataset and not purely based on the natural language query. To reduce the ambiguity in phrase localization, 4 also utilizes the full sentence to describe the image along with the query to develop relationships between multiple queries in the sentence. Evaluation metrics used to measure the performance also adds bias to some existing works. The conventional R‚Äãe‚Äãc‚Äãa‚Äãl‚Äãl‚Äã@‚ÄãKùëÖùëíùëêùëéùëôùëô@ùêæRecall@K metric essentially expects the predicted region in an image to be ranked in the top K spots. Thus, most works are designed to predict one region per query even if the query might suggest multiple regions in the image irrespective of how the dataset has marked the ground truth. In this work, to address the mentioned issues, we utilize an encoder-decoder language model with spatial attention for image-level visual-textual fusion of the input image and the natural language query which encodes both the local (word) and global (full query/phrase) understanding of the query in relation to the input image. We utilize this context generated from the attention distribution to train a Faster-RCNN framework 4 such that the proposal generation through in-network Region Proposal Network (RPN) is trained to understand the multi-modal relationship and is not limited to a fixed set of classes, and the Region-CNN network is trained to detect one or multiple regions that can relate to the given query. We depend only on the phrase query - ground truth pair information to make the model independent of the constraints of the datasets i.e. additional attributes, context etc. We call this framework Multi-region Attention-assisted Grounding network (MAGNet). We evaluate our approach on Flickr30k entities , ReferIt game  and Visual Genome 5 datasets. Thus, the contributions of this work are listed as follows: Image-level visual-textual fusion of the input image and the natural language query through the encoder-decoder language model with spatial attention. Spatial Attention distribution representing global (phrase) understanding alongside the local (word) understanding of the query in relation to the input image. Attention-assisted proposal generation through in-network RPN trained on the context generated from attention. Attention-assisted region detection through Region-CNN trained on the context generated from attention enabling single or multiple detections for a single query.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: image such that an image region linked to the phrase may or may not be independent of the broader context of the full caption.
