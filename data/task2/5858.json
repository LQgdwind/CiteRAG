      "content": "Paper Title: Prompt Tuning based Adapter for Vision-Language Model Adaption\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVision Language Model.\nVision and language models have become increasingly popular in recent years and have shown remarkable success in various computer vision tasks  3    . These models typically consist of an image encoder and a text encoder, trained using contrastive loss on large-scale image-text pairs. CLIP [ref]30 and ALIGN  are some of the most prominent models in this domain. CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) is a large-scale vision language model trained on 400 million image-text pairs that have demonstrated impressive transferability in cross-domain downstream tasks. In this context, our work focuses on transferring CLIP into 11 cross-domain image classification tasks. The integration of prompt learning-based methods and parameter-efficient methods has also shown significant improvement in few-shot performance with small computing resources, making it an area of active research. Parameter Tuning\nLarge pre-trained vision language models like CLIP have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks, but their high computational requirements make them difficult to deploy in resource-constrained environments. To address this issue, several approaches    have been proposed to reduce the number of parameters and computations required for inference while maintaining high accuracy. CLIP-Adapter  appends a lightweight two-layer Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to the pre-trained weight-fixed CLIP model and optimizes its parameters via stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Tip Adapter  constructs a non-parametric cache model that stores features of training images and their labels as a key-value database. By aggregating the information from the cache model with the text features, Tip-Adapter significantly boosts the classification accuracy without training over Zero-shot CLIP. However, Tip-Adapter still uses the manual Prompt as an image classifier, which can not fully utilize the huge knowledge of the text encoder of the CLIP model. Prompt Tuning\nPrompt engineering    has been widely used in natural language processing (NLP) to improve the performance of language models on specific tasks. A prompt is a piece of text that is added to the input to guide the model toward a particular output. Prompts can be used to provide additional information to the model, such as a task description or a set of constraints. Prompt engineering involves designing effective prompts that can guide the model toward the desired output. For example, by feeding a manual text prompt ”a photo of a {}” to the text encoder [ref]30, the CLIP model has shown strong zero-shot image recognization ability. Meanwhile, prompt tuning aims to learn an optimal prompt automatically through fine-tuning or meta-learning. In recent studies, several methods have been proposed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of prompt engineering and learning. For example, CoOp  introduced a collaborative optimization method that jointly optimizes prompts and model parameters. On the other hand, Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT)  uses a visual prompt that is tailored to the image input, improving the model’s performance on image classification tasks. Unified Prompt Tuning (UPT) [ref]39 is a recent method that learns a unified prompt for multiple tasks, which leads to better performance in downstream tasks. These methods have shown promising results in improving the performance of vision and language models, and we aim to build upon their success in our work. Few-shot Learning\nFew-shot learning has been a challenging research topic in image classification, where the objective is to recognize novel classes from only a few training examples    . This problem has garnered significant attention in the computer vision community, as it is more realistic and practical in many real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce or costly to obtain. In recent years, various methods have been proposed for few-shot image classification. One of the earliest approaches for few-shot learning was Siamese neural networks 9, which used a distance metric to compare images and learn to distinguish between classes. Later, the idea of meta-learning was introduced , which trains a model to learn how to learn from few examples. This approach led to the development of popular few-shot learning algorithms like Matching Networks , Prototypical Networks  , and Relation Networks . These methods have shown promising results on various benchmark datasets, but they usually rely on simple feature extractors and do not scale well to large-scale image classification problems. Recently, CLIP’s [ref]30 ability to jointly reason about text and images has inspired a new line of research on few-shot learning for vision and language models. Various adaptation methods, such as CoOp , UPT [ref]39, and Tip-Adapter  have been proposed to fine-tune the CLIP model on few-shot datasets. These methods have achieved state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of adapting large-scale vision and language models to few-shot learning tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: success in various computer vision tasks  3    .
