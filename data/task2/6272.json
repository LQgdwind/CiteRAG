      "content": "Paper Title: On the Role of Entanglement and Statistics in Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we consider the following setup of statistical query learning that was considered in the work of [HIN+22]. Let U𝑈U be a unitary and consider the induced distribution PUsubscript𝑃𝑈P_{U} on the computational basis, i.e., In [HIN+22, NIS+23] they considered learning algorithms that were given access to the following: for ϕ:{0,1}n→[−1,1]:italic-ϕ→superscript01𝑛11\\phi:\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\rightarrow[-1,1] and τ∈[ref]0 𝜏01\\tau\\in[ref]0 , The goal of the learning algorithm is to learn PUsubscript𝑃𝑈P_{U} upto total variational distance ≤εabsent𝜀\\leq\\varepsilon by making poly⁡(n)poly𝑛\\operatorname{poly}(n) many 𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍\\mathsf{Stat} queries each with tolerance τ=1/poly⁡(n)𝜏1poly𝑛\\tau=1/\\operatorname{poly}(n). Hinsche et al. [HIN+22] showed the hardness of learning the distribution PUsubscript𝑃𝑈P_{U} when U𝑈U is a Clifford circuit of depth ω​(log⁡n)𝜔𝑛\\omega(\\log n) and recently Nietner et al. [NIS+23] showed that if U𝑈U is a depth-Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(n) circuit where each gate is picked from U​(4)𝑈4U(4), then PUsubscript𝑃𝑈P_{U} is not learnable using just 𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍\\mathsf{Stat} queries. In this section we consider a stronger question. One can also just directly look at the quantum state |ψU⟩=U​|0n⟩ketsubscript𝜓𝑈𝑈ketsuperscript0𝑛|\\psi_{U}\\rangle=U|0^{n}\\rangle and ask how many 𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍\\mathsf{Qstat} queries of the form suffice to learn PUsubscript𝑃𝑈P_{U} upto small trace distance? Note that the learning model in [HIN+22, NIS+23] is a strict restriction of this model, cause one could just consider M=∑xϕ​(x)​|x⟩​⟨x|𝑀subscript𝑥italic-ϕ𝑥ket𝑥bra𝑥M=\\sum_{x}\\phi(x)|x\\rangle\\langle x|, then which is precisely αϕsubscript𝛼italic-ϕ\\alpha_{\\phi}. To this end, we first generalize [HIN+22] in the following theorem. For constant α∈(0,1)𝛼01\\alpha\\in(0,1), there is a family of n𝑛n-qubit circuits consisting of {Had,X,CX}HadXCX\\{\\textsf{Had},\\textsf{X},\\textsf{CX}\\} gates of depth d=(log⁡n)1/α𝑑superscript𝑛1𝛼d=(\\log n)^{1/\\alpha} and size d2superscript𝑑2d^{2} that requires 2Ω​(d)superscript2Ω𝑑2^{\\Omega(d)} 𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍\\mathsf{Qstat} queries to learn the output distribution in the computational basis to error ≤0.00125absent0.00125\\leq 0.00125 in total variational distance. Consider the padded states |ψA⟩⊗|0⟩⊗k​(n)tensor-productketsubscript𝜓𝐴superscriptket0tensor-productabsent𝑘𝑛|\\psi_{A}\\rangle\\otimes|0\\rangle^{\\otimes k(n)} we considered in Theorem 20 where {|ψA⟩=12n​∑x|x,x⊤​A​x⟩}Asubscriptketsubscript𝜓𝐴1superscript2𝑛subscript𝑥ket𝑥superscript𝑥top𝐴𝑥𝐴\\{|\\psi_{A}\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^{n}}}\\sum_{x}|x,x^{\\top}Ax\\rangle\\}_{A}.\nUsing Fact 5 learning the output distributions of these states below total variational distance 0.001250.001250.00125 implies the existence of an algorithm learning the states up to trace distance 0.050.050.05. However, we know that doing so requires 2Ω​(d)superscript2Ω𝑑2^{\\Omega(d)} queries using Theorem 20. Thus, learning the output distributions requires at least 2Ω​(d)superscript2Ω𝑑2^{\\Omega(d)} 𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍\\mathsf{Qstat} queries as well.\n∎ We next prove a generalization of [NIS+23]. Before that, we need the following result. [NIS+23, Theorem 36]\n\nThere exists a d=O​(n)𝑑𝑂𝑛d=O(n) such that for any circuit depth d′≥dsuperscript𝑑′𝑑d^{\\prime}\\geq d and any distribution Q𝑄Q over {0,1}nsuperscript01𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{n}, we have that where μd′subscript𝜇superscript𝑑′\\mu_{d^{\\prime}} indicates the uniform distribution over circuits of depth d′superscript𝑑′d^{\\prime}. Let 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} be an algorithm that makes 𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍​(τ)𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍𝜏\\mathsf{Qstat}(\\tau) queries and with high probability learns the output distributions of O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n)-depth random circuits, to error ≤1/225absent1225\\leq 1/225 in total variational distance, then 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} must make Ω​(τ2⋅2n)Ω⋅superscript𝜏2superscript2𝑛\\Omega(\\tau^{2}\\cdot 2^{n}) such many queries. This is a generalization of [NIS+23, Theorem 6] and follows by a similar analysis to their lower bound. For d≥3.2​(2+ln⁡2)​n+ln⁡n𝑑3.222𝑛𝑛d\\geq 3.2(2+\\ln 2)n+\\ln n we have that the uniform distribution over depth d𝑑d random circuits is a 2−nsuperscript2𝑛2^{-n} approximate 2-design [NIS+23]. Like we saw in the proof of Theorem 29, for every observable ‖M‖≤1norm𝑀1\\|M\\|\\leq 1, we have that 𝖵𝖺𝗋ρ∼𝒞​(𝗍𝗋​[M​ρ])=O​(2−n)subscript𝖵𝖺𝗋similar-to𝜌𝒞𝗍𝗋delimited-[]𝑀𝜌𝑂superscript2𝑛\\mathsf{Var}_{\\rho\\sim{\\mathcal{C}}}(\\mathsf{tr}[M\\rho])=O(2^{-n}). We proceed with the same adversarial lower bound. Upon making a 𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍\\mathsf{Qstat} query with observable M𝑀M, the adversary responses with 𝔼ρ∼𝒞​[𝗍𝗋​[M​ρ]]subscript𝔼similar-to𝜌𝒞delimited-[]𝗍𝗋delimited-[]𝑀𝜌\\mathbb{E}_{\\rho\\sim{\\mathcal{C}}}[\\mathsf{tr}[M\\rho]]. Using Chebyshev’s inequality, While the proof could continue using Theorem 16 (by reducing to the many-vs-one decision problem), it is more direct to note that the above inequality implies that every deterministic algorithm cannot identify the correct ρ∈𝒞𝜌𝒞\\rho\\in{\\mathcal{C}} for a large fraction of states in 𝒞𝒞{\\mathcal{C}}. In particular, say 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is a deterministic algorithm that outputs an estimate of a distribution Q𝑄Q such that dTV​(Pψ,Q)<1/225subscript𝑑TVsubscript𝑃𝜓𝑄1225d_{\\text{TV}}(P_{\\psi},Q)<1/225 and uses at most t𝑡t 𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍​(τ)𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍𝜏\\mathsf{Qstat}(\\tau) queries. Using Eq. (84), there is a fraction of 𝒞′superscript𝒞′{\\mathcal{C}}^{\\prime} of measure at least 1−O​(t⋅τ−2⋅2−n)1𝑂⋅𝑡superscript𝜏2superscript2𝑛1-O(t\\cdot\\tau^{-2}\\cdot 2^{-n}) that are consistent with 𝗍𝗋​[Mi​𝔼ρ∼𝒞​[ρ]]𝗍𝗋delimited-[]subscript𝑀𝑖subscript𝔼similar-to𝜌𝒞delimited-[]𝜌\\mathsf{tr}[M_{i}\\mathbb{E}_{\\rho\\sim{\\mathcal{C}}}[\\rho]] for the 𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍​(τ)𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍𝜏\\mathsf{Qstat}(\\tau) queries {M1,…,Mt}subscript𝑀1…subscript𝑀𝑡\\{M_{1},\\ldots,M_{t}\\} made by 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}. Since 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is deterministic, it must output the same distribution Q𝑄Q for all ρ∈𝒞′𝜌superscript𝒞′\\rho\\in{\\mathcal{C}}^{\\prime}. We now use Theorem 35 to claim that there is a large set of states that are both consistent with 𝗍𝗋​[Mi​𝔼ρ∼𝒞​[ρ]]𝗍𝗋delimited-[]subscript𝑀𝑖subscript𝔼similar-to𝜌𝒞delimited-[]𝜌\\mathsf{tr}[M_{i}\\mathbb{E}_{\\rho\\sim{\\mathcal{C}}}[\\rho]] and far from Q𝑄Q in total variational distance. where the inequality follows from the union bound, Theorem 35, and the concentration of measure shown above. Thus, there is a set 𝒞′′superscript𝒞′′{\\mathcal{C}}^{\\prime\\prime} of measure at least 1−O​(t⋅τ−2⋅2−n)1𝑂⋅𝑡superscript𝜏2superscript2𝑛1-O(t\\cdot\\tau^{-2}\\cdot 2^{-n}) that is both consistent with 𝗍𝗋​[Mi​𝔼ρ∼𝒞​[ρ]]𝗍𝗋delimited-[]subscript𝑀𝑖subscript𝔼similar-to𝜌𝒞delimited-[]𝜌\\mathsf{tr}[M_{i}\\mathbb{E}_{\\rho\\sim{\\mathcal{C}}}[\\rho]] for all queries Misubscript𝑀𝑖M_{i} and also dTV​(Pρ,Q)≥1/225subscript𝑑TVsubscript𝑃𝜌𝑄1225d_{\\text{TV}}(P_{\\rho},Q)\\geq 1/225 for all ρ∈𝒞′′𝜌superscript𝒞′′\\rho\\in{\\mathcal{C}}^{\\prime\\prime}. Upon the input of a ρ∈𝒞′′𝜌superscript𝒞′′\\rho\\in{\\mathcal{C}}^{\\prime\\prime}, 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} fails to provide a distribution Q𝑄Q such that dTV​(Pρ,Q)<1/225subscript𝑑TVsubscript𝑃𝜌𝑄1225d_{\\text{TV}}(P_{\\rho},Q)<1/225. For any constant success probability 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta there is then some nδsubscript𝑛𝛿n_{\\delta} such that for n≥nδ𝑛subscript𝑛𝛿n\\geq n_{\\delta} 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} must fail on a set of measure strictly greater than δ𝛿\\delta. Using Yao’s Principle, thus any randomized algorithm using t∈poly⁡(n)𝑡poly𝑛t\\in\\operatorname{poly}(n) 𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍\\mathsf{Qstat} queries must fail with probability strictly greater than δ/2𝛿2\\delta/2 for n𝑛n sufficiently large. Thus, 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} must use t=Ω​(τ2⋅2n)𝑡Ω⋅superscript𝜏2superscript2𝑛t=\\Omega(\\tau^{2}\\cdot 2^{n}) 𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍\\mathsf{Qstat} queries.\n∎\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: basis, i.e., In [HIN+22, NIS+23] they considered learning algorithms that were given access to the following: for ϕ:{0,1}n→[−1,1]:italic-ϕ→superscript01𝑛11\\phi:\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\rightarrow[-1,1] and τ∈[ref]0 𝜏01\\tau\\in[ref]0 , The goal of the learning algorithm is to learn PUsubscript𝑃𝑈P_{U} upto total variational distance ≤εabsent𝜀\\leq\\varepsilon by making poly⁡(n)poly𝑛\\operatorname{poly}(n) many\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
