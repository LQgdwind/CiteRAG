      "content": "Paper Title: Few-Shot Semantic Relation Prediction across Heterogeneous Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, increasing research attention has been devoted to few-shot problems on graphs. Especially, the episodic meta-learning paradigm [ref]30 has become the most popular strategy for this problem, which transfers knowledge learned from many similar few-shot learning tasks. Based on it, Meta-GNN  applies MAML  to tackle the low-resource learning problem on graph. Furthermore, RALE [ref]32 uses GNNs to encode graph path-based hubs and capture the task-level dependency, to achieve knowledge transfer. GPN [ref]33 adopts Prototypical Networks  to make the classification based on the distance between the node feature and the prototypes. G-META  uses local subgraphs with MAML to transfer information across tasks. However, these existing methods are designed for traditional tasks such as node classification and link prediction in homogeneous graphs. In contrast, in this paper we focus on semantic relation prediction in heterogeneous graphs. Recently, HINFShot  and HG-Meta  have extended meta-learning paradigms to heterogeneous graphs. However, they are limited to citation networks and can only deal with a single HG with several fixed object types (i.e., “paper”, “author”, “venue” and “institution”). They design specialized functions for object/link types or metapaths in the citation network, which cannot be generalized to deal with different object/link types in other HGs. Furthermore, the two methods are designed to learn a single object embedding for classification and are unable to capture the relationship between objects in HGs. Therefore, HINFShot and HG-Meta not only cannot deal with multiple HGs with different heterogeneities, but also cannot be used to learn semantic relations between objects for prediction.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: In recent years, increasing research attention has been devoted to few-shot problems on graphs.
