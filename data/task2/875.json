      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring the Generalizability of Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction: Meta-Modeling and an Analytic Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction (STTP) problem refers to the problem that resides in many urban predictive applications related to both spatial and temporal human mobility dynamics, e.g., the predictions of taxi demand , metro human flow , electrical vehicle charging usage , and traffic speed . The STTP problems play a vital role in today’s smart city management and organization, e.g., traffic monitoring and emergency response. Traditionally, STTP is often formulated as a time series prediction problem, where statistical methods such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)   are widely used. In recent years, with the advance of machine learning, especially deep learning techniques, a variety of new models have been developed for STTP. Today, researchers can be quickly overwhelmed by numerous STTP related papers that continuously emerge in top-tier conferences and journals    [ref]8 . However, most efforts focus on the sophisticated application-specific model design and then test their models on limited data of one or few specialized applications, e.g., ridesharing [ref]8, bikesharing  0, and highway traffic speed . Although the proposed models can conceptually be applied to other STTP scenarios, whether the performance can still be as good as their specialized applications remains unclear. In other words, it becomes rather difficult to analyze whether an STTP model can be quickly generalized over various scenarios. Indeed, the generalizability is a fundamental and key property of an STTP model, and significantly determines the potential impact scope. In this regard, it is highly urgent to require a general analytic framework that can help investigate and compare different application-driven STTP models. Furthermore, the insights derived from the analytic framework can guide researchers to justify the generalizability of these models, and then design new models with better generalizability. To fill this research gap, this paper makes efforts from the following aspects: 1) To make different application-driven STTP approaches comparable, we propose an analytic framework, called STAnalytic, to investigate the STTP approaches from their considered high-level spatial and temporal factors. Particularly, STAnalytic maps an STTP model into a two-level hierarchical analysis process where the first level is spatial and temporal perspective, and the second level is knowledge and modeling perspective. Then, every STTP model can be analyzed as two research questions: (1) “what effort is done from temporal and spatial perspective?”; and (2) “which spatial/temporal knowledge is considered with which modeling techniques?”. This qualitative analysis can provide useful insights about whether an STTP model can be well generalized to various scenarios even before we run quantitative experiments over the model. 2) To elaborate the effectiveness of STAnalytic in terms of helping design generalizable STTP models, we propose a spatio-temporal meta-model, called STMeta, based on the analysis results of the STTP over state-of-the-art in literature    [ref]8. STMeta is a “model of model” (meta-model) which has a hierarchical structure to flexibly and efficiently integrate generalizable temporal and spatial knowledge identified by STAnalytic from literature. With state-of-the-art deep learning techniques such as graph convolution 1 and attention mechanisms 2, we implement three variants of STMeta and verify their generalizable effectiveness via multiple real-life STTP benchmark datasets (listed next). 3) To alleviate the issue that today’s STTP research studies usually conduct experiments on certain specific applications and do not justify the generalizability among various applications quantitatively, we build  a set of STTP benchmark datasets  including five scenarios, i.e., ridesharing, bikesharing, metro, electric vehicle charging, and traffic speed. The datasets cover ten cities, where the longest time duration spans four years and the largest number of traffic data records is more than 400 million. We have released our code and data repository111https://github.com/uctb/UCTB. To summarize, this paper makes the following contributions: 1) We develop an analytic framework, namely STAnalytic, following which existing STTP approaches can be qualitatively explored. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies that propose such an analytic framework for the STTP problem. 2) We design a meta-model called STMeta based on the insights derived from STAnalytic over state-of-the-art research    [ref]8. STMeta can flexibly and efficiently take into account multiple spatial and temporal knowledge for building an STTP model. 3) We build a set of real-life STTP benchmark datasets covering five scenarios and ten cities. The benchmark results verify that STMeta generally outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. After analyzing the results, we provide several design guidelines to develop STTP approaches with better generalizability.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: a variety of new models have been developed for STTP.
