Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

Using another proof methodology, it is argued in [ref]29 that the regret of PSRL grows as the square root of the state space size and not linearly. In our paper, we choose to use the more conservative approach of [ref]28 because we believe that the proof used in [ref]29 is not correct (in particular the use of a deterministic vùë£v in Equation¬†(16) of the proof of Lemma¬†3 in Appendix¬†A in the arXiv version of [ref]29 seems incompatible with the use of Lemma¬†4 of the same paper).\nIn fact, when considering the worst case realization of vùë£v, the concentration bound in Equation¬†(16) of the paper is equivalent to the (scaled) L1 norm of transition concentration.\nWe are not alone to point out this error. Effectively,  used Lemma¬†C.1 and Lemma¬†C.3 (equivalence of Lemma¬†3 of [ref]29) to get a bound in square root of the state space size. But both lemmas are erroneous as mentioned in the latest arXiv version of . The validity of Lemma¬†3 is also questioned on page 87 of 2. While it is informal, the recent work of  also theoretically contradicts the lemma.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: Our bound is linear in SùëÜS, the state size of each arm, because our proof follows the approach used in [ref]28.
