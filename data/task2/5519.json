      "content": "Paper Title: AV-data2vec: Self-supervised Learning of Audio-Visual Speech Representations with Contextualized Target Representations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe proposed AV-data2vec, a self-supervised framework to jointly learn audio-visual speech representations based on contextualized targets.\nAV-data2vec adopts a shared modality-agnostic transformer encoder which takes as input both audio and video data, both of which are fused early on, similar to the human speech perception system.\nAV-data2vec unifies ASR, VSR and AVSR within a single framework and achieves state-of-the-art performance under all settings with the same amount of data/model parameters. Despite of this, there are still several limitations. Firstly, the current state-of-the-art self-supervised audio-visual speech recognition results are still inferior to supervised systems that rely on approximately 90K hours of labeled data [ref]5. Nevertheless, the self-supervised results for all of the current methods (AV-HuBERT [ref]3, VATLM [ref]28, RAVen , AV-data2vec) tend to reach saturation under high-resource and LARGE model settings. u-HuBERT  and VATLM attempt to use additional single-modality data to enhance performance, but the gain is limited. Secondly, our results are sensitive to hyper-parameters, such as modality scheduler. The training process for both data2vec  and AV-data2vec is not stable, which means that a good set of hyper-parameters can produce remarkable results. However, the optimal set of hyper-parameters may still be challenging to obtain. We believe that this high sensitivity is due to the fact that video data is much noisier than speech and contains less linguistic information. Furthermore, since our visual feature extractor, i.e., the ResNet-18, may not be capable of extracting sufficient useful information, the fused audio-visual feature may tend to be dominated by audio features. This sensitivity to the modality scheduler has also been observed in AV-HuBERT and RAVen. To address this issue, it would be beneficial to use a more powerful visual feature encoder such as Video Transformer that is adopted in VideoCLIP . Additionally, implementing an information encoding monitoring method would provide better feedback for tuning the modality scheduler. It also worths to explore the audio-visual learning in the articulatory spaceÂ     to introduce vocal tract signal as additional signal to supervise the learning.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Firstly, the current state-of-the-art self-supervised audio-visual speech recognition results are still inferior to supervised systems that rely on approximately 90K hours of labeled data [ref]5.
