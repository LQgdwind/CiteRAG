      "content": "Paper Title: POTTER: Pooling Attention Transformer for Efficient Human Mesh Recovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAfter pretaining on the ImageNet with POTTER_cls, we load the pretrained weight and train the entire network POTTER with the architecture illustrated in Fig. 4 for the HMR task. An HMR head HybrIK [ref]17 is applied for generating the final human mesh. Dataset and Implementation Details:\nHuman3.6M  is one of the commonly used datasets with the indoor setting which consists of 3.6M video frames performed by 11 actors. Following    , there are 5 subjects (S1, S5, S6, S7, S8) used for training and 2 subjects (S9, S11) used for testing. 3DPW  a widely used outdoor dataset that contains 60 video sequences with 51k frames. Unlike Human3.6M which only provides the annotation of key joints, accurate 3D mesh annotation is available for the 3DPW. Thus, we evaluate the Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) [ref]30 and MPJPE after Procrustes Alignment (PA-MPJPE) [ref]30 on Human3.6M. For 3DPW, we report the MPJPE, PA-MPJPE, and e Mean Per Vertex Error (MPVE). Following previous work [ref]17 [ref]3  , Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP , COCO , and 3DPW are used for mixed training. We train our POTTER with the architecture illustrated in Fig. 4.\nThe Adam  optimizer is utilized for training where the learning rate is 1×10−31superscript1031\\times 10^{-3} with a batch size of 32. All experiments are conducted on four NVIDIA RTX5000 GPUs with Pytorch implementation. The 3D joint loss and vertex loss are applied during the training. More implementation details are provided in the Supplementary D. Results:\nTable 2 compares POTTER with previous SOTA methods for the HMR task on Human3.6M and 3DPW datasets. As a pure transformer architecture, POTTER outperforms the previous transformer-based SOTA method METRO  (a hybrid CNN+transformer architecture) by showing significant computational and memory reduction. To be more specific, POTTER only requires 16.3 M Params and 7.8 G MACs (7% of Params and 14% MACs compared with METRO) to achieve the new SOTA performance. Although FastMETRO [ref]3 reduces the computational and memory costs of METRO, it is still much more expensive than our POTTER with worse performance. Without bells and whistles, POTTER demonstrates its exceptional performance both in terms of mesh recovery accuracy and model efficiency.  Mesh visualization:\nWe show qualitative results of POTTER on Human3.6M, 3DPW, and COCO dataset in Fig. 8. POTTER can estimate reliable human poses and meshes given various input images. More qualitative results are presented in the Supplementary B.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: After pretaining on the ImageNet with POTTER_cls, we load the pretrained weight and train the entire network POTTER with the architecture illustrated in Fig. 4 for the HMR task.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
