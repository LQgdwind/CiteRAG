      "content": "Paper Title: A SAT Scalpel for Lattice Surgery: Representation and Synthesis of Subroutines for Surface-Code Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRef.¬† first provided a compiler that takes in ICM (initialization, CNOT, and measurement) representation and translates the gates to lattice surgery operations.\nLater on, researchers opt for a more efficient operation with lattice surgery, multi-qubit Pauli measurements.\nThus, a few works focused on implementing FTQC on a 2D grid of qubits with the multi-qubit-Pauli-based gate set¬† [ref]14  .\nRef.¬† still used this gate set but discussed the advantage of having non-local connectivity.\nIn terms of software, Ref.¬† provided an instruction set for this gate set and Ref.¬† provided a compiler.\nHowever, as we demonstrated above, it is beneficial to consider optimizations beyond this gate set. Some previous works focused on improving specific components, not generic quantum circuit.\nSince the magic state factories take up a lot of volume, they have become a natural target for such optimizations.\nRef.¬† further developed the aforementioned technique of selectively reducing code distances, which can be applied in combination with the optimizations we present in this work.\nRef.¬† considered the interplay of TùëáT-factories with |CCZ‚ü©ketCCZ|\\text{CCZ}\\rangle-factories, and presented improved factory designs.\nRef.¬† provided further improvements on |CCZ‚ü©ketCCZ|\\text{CCZ}\\rangle-factories.\nHowever, all these works are manual efforts instead of an automated synthesizer. There is a similar line of works for defect based FTQC on surface codes¬†.\nThe compilation problem is formulated as routing FTQC components¬†.\nAfter a manual approach of bridge compression was proposed¬†, researchers encoded the problem to integer linear programming¬† , which is another kind of mathematical programming than SAT.\nHeuristic compilation approaches have been presented for optimizing communication¬†  , or for TùëáT-factory¬†.\nHowever, defect-based computation is phasing out because of higher overheads than lattice surgery¬† . Ref.¬† utilizes an SMT solver to synthesize fault-tolerant Clifford circuit in a bottom-up fashion like this work.\nHowever, the gate set consists of CNOT, XùëãX, YùëåY, ZùëçZ, SùëÜS, and HùêªH, quite different from generic lattice surgery operations in this work.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: for a more efficient operation with lattice surgery, multi-qubit Pauli measurements.\nThus, a few works focused on implementing FTQC on a 2D grid of qubits with the multi-qubit-Pauli-based gate set¬† [ref]14  .\nRef.¬† still used this gate set but discussed the advantage of having non-local connectivity.\nIn terms of software, Ref.¬† provided an instruction set for this gate set and Ref.¬† provided a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
