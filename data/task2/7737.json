We defer the proof of Theorem 4.4 to Section 5.\nCompared with vector-valued CSPs (VecCSP) used in the previous work [20, Definition 3.3], SVecCSP offers more structural properties. For parallel constraints, the previous work [ref]20 sets up the sub-constraint over a subset of the coordinates.\nBy construction, there might be 2|E𝗉|superscript2subscript𝐸𝗉2^{|E_{\\sf p}|} different sub-CSP instances over all coordinates. Each of the 2|E𝗉|superscript2subscript𝐸𝗉2^{|E_{\\sf p}|} sub-CSPs requires an individual PCPP verifier. To simultaneously check the satisfiability of all these sub-instances, they tuple these verifiers into a giant verifier, resulting in an exponential blowup of the proof length. Hence, an almost-linear size of proof is impossible. In contrast, SVecCSP sets up the sub-constraint on all coordinates, which implies a unified sub-CSP instance among all coordinates. As a result, we avoid the tuple procedure, enabling a highly succinct proof. For linear constraints,\nVecCSP defined in  [ref]20 allow them to be over arbitrary pairs of variables. They introduce auxiliary variables for all pairs of variables and their corresponding linear constraints to check such unstructured constraints.\nThe number of auxiliary variables is |V|⋅|E𝗅|⋅𝑉subscript𝐸𝗅|V|\\cdot|E_{\\sf l}|, which means that the proof length is at least quadratic, making an almost linear size of proof impossible. However, SVecCSP only sets up linear constraints over xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} and yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i}, with the same index i𝑖i. After encoding x𝑥x and y𝑦y by the parallel Reed-Muller code, we can leverage this alignment and introduce auxiliary proofs, which is also a codeword of the parallel Reed-Mulle code, to check the validity of linear constraints efficiently, with an almost-linear blowup. Though SVecCSP has a more refined structure than VecCSP, we can obtain it from VecCSP by properly duplicating variables and relocating constraints.\nHowever, the VecCSP instance in [ref]20 has parameters |V|=O​(k2),|E|=O​(k2)formulae-sequence𝑉𝑂superscript𝑘2𝐸𝑂superscript𝑘2|V|=O(k^{2}),|E|=O(k^{2}), which are too large to obtain Theorem 4.4.\nTo get around this, we combine results from   and the reduction in [ref]20 to obtain a sparse VecCSP instance with |V|=O​(k),|E|=O​(k)formulae-sequence𝑉𝑂𝑘𝐸𝑂𝑘|V|=O(k),|E|=O(k), which ultimately leads to Theorem 4.4.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: In this section, we define special vector-valued CSP (SVecCSP for short).
