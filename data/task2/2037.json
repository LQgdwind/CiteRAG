      "content": "Paper Title: Detecting Backdoor in Deep Neural Networks via Intentional Adversarial Perturbations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, the effectiveness of different adversarial perturbation generation methods is evaluated.\nThe four different adversarial perturbation generation methods evaluated in the experiment are C&W [ref]20, DeepFool [ref]21, PGD [ref]22 and UAP .\nThese four adversarial perturbation generation methods are separately used to generate the perturbation which is later utilized in the proposed method.\nAs shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, for the three datsets, using UAP  in the proposed method obtains the highest BDR (99.63%, 99.76% and 99.91% in Fashion-MNIST , CIFAR-10  and GTSRB  datasets, respectively), and the highest CIIR (90.66%, 89.82% and 98.85% in Fashion-MNIST , CIFAR-10  and GTSRB  datasets, respectively) among all the four adversarial perturbation generation methods.\nWith the adversarial perturbation generated by C&W [ref]20, DeepFool [ref]21 and PGD[ref]22, the performance of the proposed method is less effective, as the backdoor detection rates are as low as 74.42%, 65.22% and 91.52% by using C&W [ref]20, DeepFool [ref]21 and PGD [ref]22, respectively (as shown in Fig. 6), and the clean image identification rates are as low as 41.92%, 47.85% and 67.77% by using C&W [ref]20, DeepFool [ref]21 and PGD [ref]22, respectively (as shown in Fig. 7). As mentioned in Section 3.4, in the perturbation generation process, image-specific adversarial attack requires the label of each specific image to generate corresponding image-specific perturbation.\nIf the image is a backdoor instance, its label will be the target label, then the image-specific perturbation will be generated based on the target label instead of its ground-truth label.\nHence, the generated image-specific perturbation will strongly affect the backdoor trigger.\nOnce the backdoor trigger is strongly affected, it cannot trigger the backdoor, leading to the inconsistence of predicted labels of backdoor instance before and after perturbation.\nAs a result, this backdoor instance will be incorrectly considered as a benign image.\nTherefore, the performance of the proposed method with image-specific perturbation is low.\nUAP  is a kind of image-agnostic perturbation, which is generated based on a small set of clean images.\nThe influence of UAP is mostly on the salient regions of the backdoor instance instead of the trigger.\nTherefore, the predicted labels of the backdoor instance before and after perturbation are consistent, which makes the image be correctly detected as a backdoor instance.\nIn summary, among these four adversarial perturbation generation methods, UAP  is most suitable for use in the proposed method.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: section, the effectiveness of different adversarial perturbation generation methods is evaluated.\nThe four different adversarial perturbation generation methods evaluated in the experiment are C&W [ref]20, DeepFool [ref]21, PGD [ref]22 and UAP .\nThese four adversarial perturbation generation methods are separately used to generate the perturbation which is later utilized in the proposed\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
