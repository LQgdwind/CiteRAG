      "content": "Paper Title: Supermasks in Superposition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur solutions for 𝖦𝖭𝗌𝖦𝖭𝗌\\mathsf{GNs} and 𝖦𝖭𝗎𝖦𝖭𝗎\\mathsf{GNu} are very similar. Because 𝖦𝖭𝗎𝖦𝖭𝗎\\mathsf{GNu} is strictly more difficult, we focus on only evaluating in Scenario 𝖦𝖭𝗎𝖦𝖭𝗎\\mathsf{GNu}. For relevant figures we provide a corresponding table in Section H. Datasets  Experiments are conducted on PermutedMNIST, RotatedMNIST, and SplitMNIST. For PermutedMNIST , new tasks are created with a fixed random permutation of the pixels of MNIST. For RotatedMNIST, images are rotated by 10 degrees to form a new task with 36 tasks in total (similar to ). Finally SplitMNIST partitions MNIST into 5 different 2-way classification tasks, each containing consecutive classes from the original dataset. Training  We consider two architectures: 1) a fully connected network with two hidden layers of size 1024 (denoted FC 1024-1024 and used in ) 2) the LeNet 300-100 architecture  as used in [ref]8 .\nFor each task we train for 1000 batches of size 128 using the RMSProp optimizer 8 with learning rate 0.00010.00010.0001 which follows the hyperparameters of . Supermasks are found using the algorithm of Mallya et al. 1 with threshold value 0. However, we initialize the real valued “scores” with Kaiming uniform as in . Training the mask is not a focus of this work, we choose this method as it is fast and we are not concerned about controlling mask sparsity as in Section 4.1. Evaluation  At test time we perform inference of task identity once for each batch. If task is not inferred correctly then accuracy is 0 for the batch. Unless noted otherwise we showcase results for the most challenging scenario — when the task identity is inferred using a single image. We use “Full Batch” to indicate that all 128 images are used to infer task identity. Moreover, we experiment with both the the entropy ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} and 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} (Section 3.6) objectives to perform task identity inference. Results  Figure 4 illustrates that SupSup is able to sequentially learn 2500 permutations of MNIST—SupSup succeeds in performing 25,000-way classification. This experiment is conducted with the One-Shot algorithm (requiring one gradient computation) using single images to infer task identity. The same trends hold in Figure 3, where SupSup outperforms methods which operate in Scenario 𝖦𝖦𝖦𝖦\\mathsf{GG} by using the One-Shot algorithm to infer task identity. In Figure 3, output sizes of 100 and 500 are respectively used for LeNet 300-100 and FC 1024-1024. The left hand side of Figure 5 illustrates that SupSup is able to infer task identity even when tasks are similar—SupSup is able to distinguish between rotations of 10 degrees. Since this is a more challenging problem, we use a full batch and the Binary algorithm to perform task identity inference. Figure 7 (appendix) shows that for HopSupSup on SplitMNIST, the new mask 𝐦𝐦\\mathbf{m} converges to the correct supermask in <30absent30<30 gradient steps. Baselines & Ablations  Figure 5 (left) shows that even in Scenario 𝖦𝖭𝗎𝖦𝖭𝗎\\mathsf{GNu}, SupSup is able to outperform PSP  and BatchE [ref]51 in Scenario 𝖦𝖦𝖦𝖦\\mathsf{GG}—methods using task identity. We compare SupSup in 𝖦𝖭𝗎𝖦𝖭𝗎\\mathsf{GNu} with methods in this strictly easier scenario as they are more competitive. For instance, 9 considers sequential learning problems with only 5-10 tasks. SupSup, after sequentially learning 250 permutations of MNIST, outperforms all non-replay methods from  in the 𝖦𝖭𝗎𝖦𝖭𝗎\\mathsf{GNu} scenario after they have learned only 10 permutations of MNIST with a similar network. In 𝖦𝖭𝗎𝖦𝖭𝗎\\mathsf{GNu}, Online EWC achieves 33.88% & SI achieves 29.31% on 10 permutations of MNIST 9 while SupSup achieves 94.91% accuracy after 250 permutations (see Table 5 in 9 vs. Table 7). In Figure 5 (right) we equip BatchE with task inference using our One-Shot algorithm. Instead of attaching a weight αisubscript𝛼𝑖\\alpha_{i} to each supermask, we attach a weight αisubscript𝛼𝑖\\alpha_{i} to each rank-one matrix [ref]51. Moreover, in Section C of the appendix we augment BatchE to perform task-inference using large batch sizes.\n“Upper Bound” and “Lower Bound” are the same as in Section 4.1. Moreover, Figure 6 illustrates the importance of output size. Further investigation of this phenomena is provided by Section 3.6 and Lemma 1 of Section I.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: dataset.
