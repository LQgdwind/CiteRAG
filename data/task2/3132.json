In the meantime we update the layout in a similar manner: Although one could improve the neural crossing predictor by multiple steps in every (S​G​D)2superscript𝑆𝐺𝐷2(SGD)^{2} iteration, we found little difference when varying the number of steps.\nTherefore, we only take one step to improve the neural crossing predictor in every (S​G​D)2superscript𝑆𝐺𝐷2(SGD)^{2} iteration.\nAs with other criteria, we randomly draw mini-batches (by default, of size m=128𝑚128m=128) and iterate through all edge pairs over the course of the SGD iterations.\n When a graph layout does not have many crossings (e.g., a stress-minimized layout of a near-planar graph), this sampling strategy is not efficient.\nIn that case, we use an efficient algorithm (Bentley-Ottmann [ref]7) to find all crossing edges in a graph, and sample a mini-batch of crossings.\nSince finding all crossings can be slow for large graphs, we only do this once every few iterations and reuse the finding across a few iterations.\nSpecifically, when we draw mini-batches from the pool of all crossings, we recompute all crossings again once the pool is drained.\nTo evaluate the quality we simply count the number of crossings.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: predictor using a sample of edge pairs from the graph.\nFor simplicity, we describe the training by SGD, although in practice one can utilize any SGD variants (e.g. SGD with momentum, ADAM or RMSProp [ref]51) to train the predictor more efficiently.
