      "content": "Paper Title: Computational Complexities of Folding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe computer simulation of origami and related folding problems has been well-studied, and several systems can convert a crease pattern into its folded state, or find a folding motion to reach that state       . However, these systems are often heuristic, rather having proven performance guarantees. They may sometimes produce unphysical motions in which paper passes through itself. They may be limited to simple folding steps instead of multi-crease motions. The search space may be pruned heuristically, avoiding a slow combinatorial search but omitting valid solutions . These methods generally approximate real numbers by floating point, and it can be unclear whether a folded state that appears numerically valid might be mathematically impossible. On the theoretical side, only limited positive results are known, including polynomial time algorithms for folding single-strip patterns with parallel creases  , single-vertex crease patterns , and map folds of 2×n2𝑛2\\times n grids . We would like to understand the extent to which improved theory might help make these simulations more robust, and to which theoretical hardness limit our ability to find algorithmic guarantees for these problems. Past results in this direction include the 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-completeness of finding a flat-folded state of a finite crease pattern  , and the undecidability of certain problems related to flat folding of infinite crease patterns  . We extend these results by proving the following: Flat folding has a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm, with time depending factorially on the ply of a crease pattern (the maximum number of layers in its folded state), exponentially on the treewidth of a graph associated with the crease pattern, and quadratically in the number of creases (Theorem 1). Under the exponential time hypothesis, the exponential dependence on treewidth is necessary for this result, even when the ply is bounded (Theorem 2). In the radical computation tree and root computation tree models of exact symbolic computation formalized by Bannister et al. , it is not always possible to represent the three-dimensional folded state of a polyhedral net with triangular faces and integer edge lengths (Theorem 3). For a toy model of flat folding consisting of uncreased congruent squares of paper taped to a tabletop by one edge (“flaps and flips”), getting between two flat folded states by moving one square at a time, or testing whether all states are reachable from each other, is 𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤\\mathsf{PSPACE}-complete (Theorem 4). Counting flat-folded states of flaps and flips instances is #​𝖯#𝖯\\mathsf{\\#P}-complete under polynomial-time counting reductions (Theorem 5). There is a fixed infinite self-similar crease pattern (the union of infinitely many scaled copies of a finite set of creases, which may either be labeled or unlabeled) for which testing whether a finite choice of folds can be extended to a flat-folding of the whole pattern is 𝖼𝗈𝖱𝖤𝖼𝗈𝖱𝖤\\mathsf{coRE}-complete and undecidable (Theorem 6). Without the finite choice of folds, it is undecidable to determine whether a given self-similar crease pattern is flat-foldable (Theorem 7). Theorem 4 and Theorem 5 use reductions from nondeterministic constraint logic . In proving Theorem 5, we also prove that counting solutions to a nondeterministic constraint logic instance is #​𝖯#𝖯\\mathsf{\\#P}-complete (Corollary 13). Few #​𝖯#𝖯\\mathsf{\\#P}-completeness or #​𝖯#𝖯\\mathsf{\\#P}-hardness proofs are known for geometric problems   [ref]23 [ref]25. Theorem 5 adds to this small set. Theorem 6 and Theorem 7 strengthen previous results of Hull and Zakharevich  by using finite paper, avoiding optional folds, and proving undecidability for flat folding rather than a more complicated decision problem.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: a nondeterministic constraint logic instance is #​𝖯#𝖯\\mathsf{\\#P}-complete (Corollary 13).
