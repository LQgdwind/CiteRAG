      "content": "Paper Title: TTA-Nav: Test-time Adaptive Reconstruction for Point-Goal Navigation under Visual Corruptions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerally, an end-to-end visual navigation model can be decomposed into two parts: Visual Encoder (VE) and a policy network. VE gets an RGB observation and extracts useful features for the task. Then, the policy network is given the target destination and uses the extracted features along with the target location to output action [ref]17. The models can be trained with reinforcement (RL) and/or imitation learning (IL) [ref]19. The overview architecture of the navigation models we used is in the purple frame in Fig. 2.\nIn our study, we adopt the SOTA navigation model from  [ref]6. It is trained with 2.5 billion RGB frames on a point-goal navigation task.\nThese RGB frames are obtained from both Gibson 2+limit-from22+ dataset (train)  and Matterport3D dataset (train and validation) . We will call this model DD-PPO in the remaining parts of the text. Our algorithm is based on the batch normalization (BatchNorm)  but the pretrained DD-PPO model has group normalization (GroupNorm) . Therefore, we replace all GroupNorm layers with BatchNorm and fine-tune the model on Gibson scenes for 120M frames using the same configurations as in [ref]6. Specifically, we adopt SE-ResNeXt-50  for VE architecture and LSTM  with the hidden size of 512512512 for the policy network. We use the same reward function as proposed in [ref]6. We will call this model as Pretrained-Nav.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: an RGB observation and extracts useful features for the task.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
