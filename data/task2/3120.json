      "content": "Paper Title: The Power of Communication in a Distributed Multi-Agent System\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this work, we study communication in the context of a distributed renewable energy grid, an Offshore Wind Farm. Existing offshore wind farms consist of up to 175 wind turbines, covering 90 square kilometres ; therefore, wind conditions can vary vastly. Exchanging wind direction information with neighbouring wind turbines can help predict wind change and consequently achieve higher efficiency. Our test bed environment is a fixed size, continuously generated wind field with a random main wind direction. The MA setup consists of eight agents, each controlling one distributed wind turbine, taking actions simultaneously and independently. The collective goal is to maximise efficiency, measured by the cumulative energy generated across all turbines. Orienting a wind turbine against the wind direction generates energy. The environment is partially observable, where each wind turbine agent can only observe its own orientation and wind direction. We can enable a communication layer, which extends each agentâ€™s observation space to exchange information with n nearest neighbours . Two information exchange modes are available: \"broadcasting\" and \"by Choice\". An information signal consists of the local position and wind direction of the sender . Knowing wind direction in the surrounding neighbourhood helps each wind turbine predict future wind change, generating higher cumulative energy over time. We present a neighbourhood communication system based on a Graph Neural Network (GNN) [ref]16\nusing a message passing framework [ref]17\ncoupled with a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning \ncontrol mechanism, building on top of a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm\n[ref]19.\nWe demonstrate how training time, performance and scalability of a Single- and no communication Multi-Agent baseline can be surpassed by leveraging communication in a 1. message broadcasting and 2. sending messages by choice setup.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: neighbourhood helps each wind turbine predict future wind change, generating higher cumulative energy over time. We present a neighbourhood communication system based on a Graph Neural Network (GNN) [ref]16\nusing a message passing framework [ref]17\ncoupled with a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning \ncontrol mechanism, building on top of a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
