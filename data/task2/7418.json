Machine learning models, particularly time-series models such as LSTM, GRU, and Bi-LSTM, have gained popularity in this domain  3 4 5. Researchers have proposed tailored models to better fit the financial scenario. For example, Li et al. 6 introduce extra input gates to extract positive and negative correlations between factors. Ding et al. 7 propose a novel LSTM model to simultaneously predict the opening, lowest, and highest prices of a stock. Agarwal et al. 8 propose a hybrid prediction model (HPM) that combines three time-series models. Zhang et al. [ref]2 propose a State Frequency Memory (SFM) network that decomposes the hidden states of memory cells into multiple frequency components to model different latent trading patterns. Feng et al.  incorporate a temporal attentive aggregation layer and adversarial training into an LSTM variant. Chen et al. 9 use Bi-LSTM to encode stock data and financial news representations in their Structured Stock Prediction Model (SSPM) and multi-task Structured Stock Prediction Model (MSSPM). CNNs are also believed to capture important features for predicting stock fluctuations. For instance, Deng et al.  propose the Knowledge-Driven Temporal Convolutional Network (KDTCN), which integrates knowledge graphs with CNNs to fully utilize industrial relations. Lu et al.  enhance a CNN-based model by extracting historical influential stock fluctuations with attention mechanism. Chandar  transforms technical indicators into images and used them as input for a CNN model. To handle non-Euclidean structured data, some researchers have incorporated Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into stock forecasting. Velickovic et al.  construct a graph with stocks as nodes and used graph attention network (GAT) to aggregate neighbor embeddings. Xu et al.  construct a stock market relationship graph and extracted information hierarchically. Li et al.  propose an LSTM Relational Graph Convolutional Network (LSTM-RGCN) model that handles both positive and negative correlations among stocks. The Transformer model , with self-attention and positional encoding mechanisms, has shown great potential in stock forecasting. Ding et al.  improve the Transformer by incorporating multi-scale Gaussian prior, optimizing locality, and implementing Orthogonal Regularization. Yoo et al.  propose a Data-axis Transformer with Multi-Level Contexts (DTML) to learn the correlations between stocks. Yang et al.  introduce the Hierarchical, Transformer-based, multi-task (HTML) model for predicting short-term and long-term asset volatility.
