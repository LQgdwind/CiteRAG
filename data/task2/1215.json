In DL, a DNN model\nis trained to minimize the adopted loss function based on a large\namount of data and the back propagation algorithm without\nrelying on an explicit\nhand-crafted mathematical formulation of the system model. Although DL\nhas been extensively studied in the fields of computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing, only recently, it has been seriously considered for\nthe design of WCS [ref]16 regarding problems such as channel estimation,\ndata detection, and classification of wireless signals. Channel estimation and data detection based on DL\nwere studied for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) ,\nfilter bank multicarrier modulation [ref]18,\nmultiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) ,\nmillimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO , and\nmolecular communication  systems. Moreover,\nthe authors of  studied DL-based channel estimation\nand detection for MIMO systems with 1-bit analog-to-digital converters.\nFurthermore, in , a DL-based channel state information (CSI) feedback scheme for\nmassive MIMO systems was proposed. Regarding the classification of wireless signals, it was shown\nin  and  that the modulation format\nand the type of data traffic can be determined accurately with DNNs. DL\nwas also applied for cooperative spectrum sensing in CR systems\n, where a DNN-based cooperative spectrum sensing\nstrategy was proposed. Moreover, DL was exploited for\nthe design of encoders and decoders using a DNN-based autoencoder\nfor optical wireless communications  and sparse code\nmultiple access (SCMA) .\nFinally, the practical relevance and viability of DL-based\nWCS design were verified by implementation with\nsoftware-defined radios  \nand corresponding digital circuits using hardware description language .\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: interest in different application domains,\nmainly due to its remarkable advantages over conventional methods.\nFor example, image classification based on DL has even surpassed\nhuman-level performance [ref]15.
