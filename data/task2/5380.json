Every MLP can be seen as a\nquantitative argumentation framework (QAF)  [ref]40.\nIntuitively, QAFs are edge-weighted directed graphs,\nwhere nodes represent arguments and, similarly to  , edges with negative weight represent\nattack and edges with positive weight represent support relations between arguments.\nEach argument is initialized with a base score that\nassigns an apriori strength to the argument.\nThe strength of arguments is then updated iteratively\nbased on the strength values of attackers and supporters\nuntil the values converge. In acyclic graphs corresponding to MLPs, this iterative process is equivalent to the forward propagation process in the MLPs  [ref]40.\nConceptually, strength values are from some domain 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}  .\nAs we focus on (real-valued) MLPs, we will assume 𝒟⊆ℝ𝒟ℝ\\mathcal{D}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}. The exact domain depends on\nthe activation function, e.g. the logistic function\nresults in 𝒟= 𝒟01\\mathcal{D}= , the hyperbolic tangent in 𝒟=[−1,1]𝒟11\\mathcal{D}=[-1,1] and ReLU in 𝒟=[0,∞]𝒟0\\mathcal{D}=[0,\\infty].\nFormally, we describe QAFs as follows. A QAF with domain 𝒟⊆ℝ𝒟ℝ\\mathcal{D}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R} is a tuple\n(𝒜,E,β,w)𝒜𝐸𝛽𝑤(\\mathcal{A},E,\\beta,w) that consists of sets 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} of arguments and E⊆𝒜×𝒜𝐸𝒜𝒜E\\!\\subseteq\\!\\mathcal{A}\\!\\times\\!\\mathcal{A} of edges\nbetween\narguments; a function β:𝒜→𝒟:𝛽→𝒜𝒟\\beta\\!:\\!\\mathcal{A}\\!\\rightarrow\\!\\mathcal{D}\nassigning base scores in\n𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}\nto all arguments; a function w:E→ℝ:𝑤→𝐸ℝw:E\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}\nassigning weights in ℝℝ\\mathbb{R} to all edges. Edges with negative/positive weights are called attack/support edges, denoted by AttAtt\\mathrm{Att}/SupSup\\mathrm{Sup}, respectively. The strength values of arguments are usually computed iteratively\nusing a two-step update procedure  : first, an aggregation function α𝛼\\alpha\naggregates the strength values of attackers and supporters;\nthen, an influence function ι𝜄\\iota adapts the\nbase score.\nExamples of aggregation functions include product  7 ,\naddition   8 and maximum  , with the influence function\ndefined accordingly to guarantee that strength values fall\nin 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}.\nHere, we focus on\nthe aggregation and influence functions from\n[ref]40, to obtain QAFs simulating MLPs\nwith a logistic activation function  [ref]40.\nThe strength values of arguments are computed by the following iterative\nprocedure:\nfor every a∈𝒜𝑎𝒜a\\in\\mathcal{A}, we let sa(0):=β​(a)assignsuperscriptsubscript𝑠𝑎0𝛽𝑎s_{a}^{(0)}:=\\beta(a)\nbe the initial strength value; the strength values are then updated by the next two steps repeatedly (where the auxiliary αaisuperscriptsubscript𝛼𝑎𝑖\\alpha_{a}^{i} carries the aggregate at iteration i≥0𝑖0i\\geq 0): αa(i+1):=∑(b,a)∈Ew​((b,a))⋅sb(i)assignsuperscriptsubscript𝛼𝑎𝑖1subscript𝑏𝑎𝐸⋅𝑤𝑏𝑎superscriptsubscript𝑠𝑏𝑖\\alpha_{a}^{(i+1)}:=\\sum_{(b,a)\\in E}w((b,a))\\cdot s_{b}^{(i)}. sa(i+1):=φl​(ln⁡(β​(a)1−β​(a))+αa(i+1))assignsuperscriptsubscript𝑠𝑎𝑖1subscript𝜑𝑙𝛽𝑎1𝛽𝑎superscriptsubscript𝛼𝑎𝑖1s_{a}^{(i+1)}:=\\varphi_{l}\\big{(}\\ln(\\frac{\\beta(a)}{1-\\beta(a)})+\\alpha_{a}^{(i+1)}\\big{)},\nwhere φl​(z)=11+exp⁡(−z)subscript𝜑𝑙𝑧11𝑧\\varphi_{l}(z)=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-z)} is the logistic function. The final strength of argument a𝑎a is defined via the limit of sa(i)superscriptsubscript𝑠𝑎𝑖s_{a}^{(i)}, for i𝑖i towards infinity.\nNotably, the semantics given by this notion of final strength satisfies almost all desiderata for QAF semantics [ref]40.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: Vl−1subscript𝑉𝑙1V_{l-1} by applying 𝒪xℳsubscriptsuperscript𝒪ℳ𝑥\\mathcal{O}^{\\mathcal{M}}_{x}\ncomponent-wise.
