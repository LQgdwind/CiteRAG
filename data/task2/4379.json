In order to overcome the language biases issues in VQA, many debiasing methods have been proposed recently. Specifically, existing methods can be roughly divided into two groups: 1) Ensemble-based debiasing methods. These methods always design an auxiliary branch to explicit model and exclude the language biases [ref]46        . 2) Model-agnostic debiasing methods. These methods mainly include balancing datasets  , data augmentation by generating augmented training samples [ref]22     , and designing extra training objectives [ref]22  . Almost existing debiasing methods significantly improve their OOD performance, but with the cost of ID performance drops. In this paper, we deeply analyze existing DA methods, and propose a new DA strategy to achieve a decent trade-off between ID & OOD performance. Data Augmentation in VQA. In addition to the mainstream synthetic-based methods, there are other DA methods: some existing methods generate negative samples by randomly selecting images or questions [ref]50 , or compose reasonable image-question (VQ) pairs as new positive training samples . For these generated VQ pairs, they utilize manually pre-defined rules to obtain answers, which are designed for some specific question types. However, these DA methods almost either suffer a severe ID performance drop  [ref]50   or their answer assignment mechanisms rely on human annotations and lack generality  [ref]22   . Instead, our KDDAug overcomes all these weaknesses. Knowledge Distillation. KD is a method that helps the training process of a smaller student network under the supervision of a larger teacher network . The idea of KD has been applied to numerous vision tasks, e.g., object detection  2 or visual-language tasks   . Recently, Niu et.al.  began to study KD for VQA and propose a KD-based method to generate “soft” labels in training. Inspired by them, we propose to use a multi-teacher KD to generate robust pseudo ground-truth labels for all new composed VQ pairs.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: existing methods can be roughly divided into two groups: 1) Ensemble-based debiasing methods.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
