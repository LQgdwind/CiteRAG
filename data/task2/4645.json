      "content": "Paper Title: Open-Ended Evolution for Minecraft Building Generation This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 programme under grant agreement No 951911.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEarly works on computational creativity approached the task of content generation by searching the problem space using evolutionary algorithms and an extrinsic objective function . As the problem spaces and fitness functions become more complex, however, such algorithms tend to suffer from premature convergence to suboptimal solutions. To overcome this issue, modern creative artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have shifted toward abandoning objectives altogether and using novelty search to reward solutions based on their diversity [ref]2. Whilst simple novelty search helps avoid the pitfalls of objective functions, it often still suffers from its own search biases and population convergence , and does not guarantee that solutions exhibit desired qualities. Open-endedness in evolution through novelty  is an important topic in computational creativity and artificial general intelligence, and is at the center of this project. Recent works on achieving open-endedness in procedural content generation (PCG) have focused on using an intrinsic definition for novelty which is defined on the system’s own output. Intrinsic motivation (IM) in artificial systems has been identified as an important factor for achieving higher forms of open-ended creativity, and in situations where the objective of the system is difficult to model [ref]5.\nThe Deep Learning Novelty eXplorer (DeLeNoX) algorithm  approaches an IM novelty function by assessing novelty in terms of a higher-level representation, determined by an autoencoder (CNN).\nBy allowing the generator to adjust its measure for novelty according to its own observations, DeLeNoX is able to continually adapt its focus to search beyond its current biases, a concept which is critical for achieving open-ended evolution. More recent works have applied this intrinsically motivated approach to a variety of tasks, such as 2D artifacts  [ref]7, interesting behaviors in robots  and search space illumination . Our approach builds upon DeLeNoX, expanding the algorithm on more complex 3D structures. In this paper we propose a computational system designed to autonomously create interesting Minecraft buildings using an intrinsic and open-ended definition of novelty. Sandbox games such as Minecraft 0 are arguably the perfect canvas to illustrate an artificial system’s creativity: their open-ended gameplay allows the player to create any structure that can be expressed as a set of voxels. On a high level, the system alternates between phases of exploration and transformation. During exploration, the latent space defined by the current autoencoder is explored as thoroughly as possible by applying constrained novelty search [ref]2 to neuroevolution 1. Repair functions ensure individuals abide to a set of basic rules for buildings, in place of an objective function. During transformation, the most novel individuals from each population form a training set to retrain the autoencoder, modifying the latent space (and distance function) and opening up new areas of the solution space to explore. The new autoencoder is used for the next iteration of the algorithm which can continue until stopping criteria are met. Our findings suggest that redefining the latent space using novel data with a diverse range of structural complexity improves the generator’s ability to find more complex and novel features in its output. To our knowledge this approach remains untested for generating complex 3D structures such as Minecraft buildings. Current research into PCG for Minecraft focuses on the goals laid out in the Generative Design in Minecraft Competition 2 to design settlements and buildings, without emphasizing creativity in the generation process. The buildings generated are often static, rule-based systems that do not involve any optimization methods at all. We position this work to fill in this space, and potentially inspire more creativity-focused building and/or settlement generators.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: this issue, modern creative artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have shifted toward abandoning objectives altogether and using novelty search to reward solutions based on their diversity [ref]2.
