      "content": "Paper Title: Manifold Free Riemannian Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNon-convex constrained optimization problems are prevalent across multiple areas in science, physics, economics, climate modeling and many other fields. Through history, various methods and vast literature dealt with proposing algorithm for solving constrained optimization problems, e.g., projected gradient method; sequential quadratic programming; proximal point method; penalty, barrier, and\naugmented Lagrangian\nmethods, and many others . In many applications, the constraint set is a low dimensional manifold, e.g., eigenvalue problems, principal component analysis, low-rank matrix completion, pose estimation and motion recovery. Explicitly, consider an optimization problem of the form where ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥{\\mathcal{M}} is a compact and boundaryless smooth dùëëd-dimensional\nsubmanifold of ‚ÑùDsuperscript‚Ñùùê∑\\mathbb{R}^{D}, and f:‚ÑùD‚Üí‚Ñù:ùëì‚Üísuperscript‚Ñùùê∑‚Ñùf:\\mathbb{R}^{D}\\to\\mathbb{R} is a sufficiently\nsmooth cost function (i.e., gradient Lipschitz). Note that, essentially the minimization is of the restriction of fùëìf on ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M}, i.e., f|‚Ñ≥evaluated-atùëì‚Ñ≥f|_{\\mathcal{M}}. Several approaches were developed over\nthe years to solve Problem¬†(1.1). Most relevant to our work is the extensive literature, e.g.¬† [ref]35 , which developed the so-called Riemannian optimization framework for solving Problem(1.1) for various constraining manifolds.\nFor recent surveys, see  .\nKey to the success of this framework are advances in numerical linear algebra (e.g., matrix factorization),\nand the introduction of tractable geometric components,\nwhich enabled progress in this field and allowed the development of effective algorithms.\nThe Riemannian optimization framework proved especially effective for matrix manifolds (i.e., manifolds constructed from ‚ÑùD1√óD2superscript‚Ñùsubscriptùê∑1subscriptùê∑2\\mathbb{R}^{D_{1}\\times D_{2}} as embedded submanifolds or quotient manifolds), such as the Stiefel manifold, the Grassmann\nmanifold of subspaces, the cone of positive definite matrices, and even\nthe Euclidean space. The main idea in the Riemannian optimization framework is as follows. Given a\nconstraining manifold, use Riemannian geometry to develop geometrical\ncomponents which allow modifying iterative methods for solving unconstrained\noptimization problems to solve the constrained case by viewing it as an unconstrained problem with a manifold geometry. Much effort\nwas invested in developing these components for frequently arising\nmanifolds and finding ways to efficiently compute them (see Subsection 2.1). In the aforementioned line of research either the manifold ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥{\\mathcal{M}}\nis explicitly available, or the computation of the components\nis possible directly from the given constraints. However, a much less investigated problem setting is in which the given constraints form a manifold ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥{\\mathcal{M}} for which the geometric components are intractable or cannot be formed explicitly, then the manifold ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥{\\mathcal{M}}, or at the very least the relevant components, need to be approximated.\nIn this paper, we tackle three specific scenarios for Problem (1.1) in which the manifold ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥{\\mathcal{M}} is unknown, in the sense that it is given only implicitly. The first two are the main focus of this paper and we demonstrate both of them empirically. The last scenario is mentioned as a remark of a possible application of our method, and we do not demonstrate it, but our analysis is valid for it as well. In the strictest scenario, at the bare minimum, we require only a noiseless quasi-uniform sample set (see Definition 4) with respect to the domain ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} of the cost function and ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} (see assumption 5 and 10), and knowledge of the intrinsic dimension of the constraining manifold. In a simpler scenario, we assume in addition to the previous requirements that we have access to the cost function and its gradient in ‚ÑùDsuperscript‚Ñùùê∑\\mathbb{R}^{D}. Finally, in the simplest scenario we also assume that we have access to the tangent spaces of the constraining manifold at least at the points of the sample set. Note that the last scenario exists in real world applications such as in digital imaging (e.g., 2 4), where for a finite sample set it is possible to determine precisely tangent spaces using high resolution images or 333D-scans. Our method builds upon a recently developed method\nfor approximating manifolds, ‚ÄúManifold Moving Least-Squares (MMLS) Projection‚Äù\n[ref]37. Given a set of samples of ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥{\\mathcal{M}} which forms a quasi-uniform sample set with respect to the domain ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M}, the dimension\nof the manifold dùëëd, and a point ùê´‚àà‚ÑùDùê´superscript‚Ñùùê∑{\\mathbf{r}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D} close enough to the\nmanifold (see Assumption 8), MMLS\nalgorithm performs two stages of approximation resulting in an approximate\n‚Äúprojection‚Äù of ùê´ùê´{\\mathbf{r}} to the manifold ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥{\\mathcal{M}} (see Subsection\n2.2). It is shown in [37, Theorem 4.21]\nthat the set of all MMLS projections of the points of ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥{\\mathcal{M}},\ndenoted by ‚Ñ≥~~‚Ñ≥\\widetilde{{\\mathcal{M}}}, is in itself almost everywhere111We say ‚Ñ≥~~‚Ñ≥\\widetilde{{\\mathcal{M}}} is almost everywhere a smooth dùëëd-dimensional\nmanifold, when for all ùê´‚àà‚Ñ≥~ùê´~‚Ñ≥{\\mathbf{r}}\\in\\widetilde{{\\mathcal{M}}} but a set of measure 00 there exists a local diffeomorphism around ùê´ùê´{\\mathbf{r}} to another smooth dùëëd-dimensional\nmanifold. a smooth dùëëd-dimensional\nmanifold approximating ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥{\\mathcal{M}} and MMLS projection of ùê´ùê´{\\mathbf{r}}\nbelongs to ‚Ñ≥~~‚Ñ≥\\widetilde{{\\mathcal{M}}}. MMLS provides a local dùëëd-dimensional coordinate system and an\norigin, from which a polynomial approximation of a parametrization\nof ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥{\\mathcal{M}} is constructed, viewing the manifold locally as a graph\nof a function from a dùëëd-dimensional space to a (D‚àíd)ùê∑ùëë(D-d)-dimensional\nspace. MMLS can be utilized to define an approximate tangent space and some of\nthe geometric components required for optimization. We present\nour proposed approximations in Section 3. Thus, our proposed algorithm can be utilized for previously unsolved problems, zeroth-order optimization in the sense of constraint set accessibility. Furthermore, we also provide a fully zeroth-order optimization method with respect to the cost function accessibility. Suppose that the cost function fùëìf is only given\nvia samples of the values of fùëìf on ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥{\\mathcal{M}} (or its gradient is unknown, while samples of fùëìf are available), the extension of\nMMLS for approximating functions over manifolds [ref]36\nis utilized for approximating fùëìf (if required) and its Euclidean gradient222Note that the gradient approximation is an extension we present here, see Lemma 31 in Appendix B.1.. We theoretically analyze the global convergence of a Riemannian gradient\nmethod based on MMLS in Section 4, following a similar analysis as in \nand using the results presented in  . In our analysis we\ndo not assume convexity in the usual or the Riemannian sense [7, Section 11]\nin order to not restrict our analysis, and also since continuous and\nconvex (in the Riemannian sense) functions over connected and compact manifolds (as we assume for ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} in this paper) are constant functions [7, Corollary 11.10].\nFinally, we demonstrate empirically our proposed MMLS based geometrical components\nboth for a Riemannian gradient method based on MMLS, and also for a\nRiemannian conjugate-gradients (CG) method based on MMLS. Our analysis assumes a noiseless (i.e., clean) sample set of the cost function and the constraining manifold. In practice, this assumption can be relaxed since MMLS [ref]37 and its function approximation extention [ref]36 can also be applied on a noisy sample set, but some results in [ref]37 [ref]36 , e.g., on the approximation order, require clean samples. Thus for the sake of theoretical analysis, we restrict ourselves in this paper to the case in which we have clean samples. Our proposed method builds upon MMLS. Note that other methods for manifold learning which provide similar tools as MMLS (see Assumption 18) can also be used to produce approximations of the various geometric components we propose here (see Table 1). Moreover, the analysis we perform in Subsection 4.1 is general and can be extended for the use of other manifold learning methods satisfying Assumption 18.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: fùëìf on ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M}, i.e., f|‚Ñ≥evaluated-atùëì‚Ñ≥f|_{\\mathcal{M}}.
