      "content": "Paper Title: The Power of a Single Qubit: Two-way Quantum Finite Automata and the Word Problem\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe show that, for many groups G𝐺G, the corresponding word problem WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G} is recognized by a 2QCFA with “good” parameters. In order to state these results, we must make use of some terminology and notation concerning 2QCFA, the word problem of a group, and various classes of groups whose word problems are of complexity theoretic interest. A full description of the 2QCFA model can be found in Section 2.1; the definition of the word problem, as well as additional group theory background, including the definitions of the various classes of groups discussed in this section, can be found in Section 2.2. The following definition establishes some useful notation that will allow us to succinctly describe the parameters of a 2QCFA. We use ℝ>0subscriptℝabsent0\\mathbb{R}_{>0} to denote the positive real numbers. For T:ℕ→ℕ:𝑇→ℕℕT:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}, ϵ∈ℝ>0italic-ϵsubscriptℝabsent0\\epsilon\\in\\mathbb{R}_{>0}, d∈ℕ𝑑ℕd\\in\\mathbb{N}, and 𝔸⊆ℂ𝔸ℂ\\mathbb{A}\\subseteq\\mathbb{C}, the complexity class 𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠​(T,ϵ,d,𝔸)𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠𝑇italic-ϵ𝑑𝔸\\mathsf{coR2QCFA}(T,\\epsilon,d,\\mathbb{A}) consists of all languages L⊆Σ∗𝐿superscriptΣL\\subseteq\\Sigma^{*} for which there is a 2QCFA M𝑀M, which has d𝑑d quantum basis states and transition amplitudes in 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A}, such that, ∀w∈Σ∗for-all𝑤superscriptΣ\\forall w\\in\\Sigma^{*}, the following holds: M𝑀M runs in expected time O​(T​(|w|))𝑂𝑇𝑤O(T(\\lvert w\\rvert)), Pr⁡[M​ accepts ​w]+Pr⁡[M​ rejects ​w]=1Pr𝑀 accepts 𝑤Pr𝑀 rejects 𝑤1\\Pr[M\\text{ accepts }w]+\\Pr[M\\text{ rejects }w]=1, w∈L⇒Pr⁡[M​ accepts ​w]=1𝑤𝐿⇒Pr𝑀 accepts 𝑤1w\\in L\\Rightarrow\\Pr[M\\text{ accepts }w]=1, and w∉L⇒Pr⁡[M​ rejects ​w]≥1−ϵ𝑤𝐿⇒Pr𝑀 rejects 𝑤1italic-ϵw\\not\\in L\\Rightarrow\\Pr[M\\text{ rejects }w]\\geq 1-\\epsilon. The focus on the transition amplitudes of a 2QCFA warrants a bit of additional justification, as while it is standard to limit the transition amplitudes of a Turing machine in this way, it is common for finite automata to be defined without any such limitation. For many finite automata models, applying such a constraint would be superfluous; for example, the class of languages recognized with bounded error and in expected time 2no​(1)superscript2superscript𝑛𝑜12^{n^{o(1)}} by a 2PFA with no restriction at all on its transition amplitudes is precisely the regular languages . However, the power of the 2QCFA model is quite sensitive to the choice of transition amplitudes. A 2QCFA with non-computable transition amplitudes can recognize undecidable languages, with bounded error and in expected polynomial time ; whereas, 2QCFA with transition amplitudes restricted to the algebraic numbers ℚ¯¯ℚ\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}} can only recognize languages in 𝖯∩𝖫2𝖯superscript𝖫2\\mathsf{P}\\cap\\mathsf{L}^{2}, even if permitted unbounded error and exponential time . In particular, the algebraic numbers are arguably the “standard” choice for the permitted transition amplitudes of a quantum Turing machine (QTM). It is desirable for the definition of 2QCFA to be consistent with that of QTMs as such consistency makes it more likely that techniques developed for 2QCFA could be applied to QTMs. Therefore, ℚ¯¯ℚ\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}} is the the natural choice for the permitted transition amplitudes of a 2QCFA, though we do also consider the impact of allowing transition amplitudes in the slightly broader class ℂ~=ℚ¯∪{eπ​i​r:r∈(ℚ¯∩ℝ)}~ℂ¯ℚconditional-setsuperscript𝑒𝜋𝑖𝑟𝑟¯ℚℝ\\widetilde{\\mathbb{C}}=\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}\\cup\\{e^{\\pi ir}:r\\in(\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}\\cap\\mathbb{R})\\}. We begin with a simple motivating example. For a finite alphabet ΣΣ\\Sigma, a symbol σ∈Σ𝜎Σ\\sigma\\in\\Sigma, and a word w∈Σ∗𝑤superscriptΣw\\in\\Sigma^{*}, let #​(w,σ)#𝑤𝜎\\#(w,\\sigma) denote the number of appearances of σ𝜎\\sigma in w𝑤w. Then the word problem for the group ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z} (the integers, where the group operation is addition) is the language Wℤ={w∈{a,b}∗:#​(w,a)=#​(w,b)}subscript𝑊ℤconditional-set𝑤superscript𝑎𝑏#𝑤𝑎#𝑤𝑏W_{\\mathbb{Z}}=\\{w\\in\\{a,b\\}^{*}:\\#(w,a)=\\#(w,b)\\}. This language is closely related to the language Le​q={am​bm:m∈ℕ}subscript𝐿𝑒𝑞conditional-setsuperscript𝑎𝑚superscript𝑏𝑚𝑚ℕL_{eq}=\\{a^{m}b^{m}:m\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}; in particular, Le​q=(a∗​b∗)∩Wℤsubscript𝐿𝑒𝑞superscript𝑎superscript𝑏subscript𝑊ℤL_{eq}=(a^{*}b^{*})\\cap W_{\\mathbb{Z}}. More generally, the word problem for the group ℤksuperscriptℤ𝑘\\mathbb{Z}^{k} (the direct product of k𝑘k copies of ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}) is the language Wℤk={w∈{a1,b1,…,ak,bk}∗:#​(w,ai)=#​(w,bi),∀i}subscript𝑊superscriptℤ𝑘conditional-set𝑤superscriptsubscript𝑎1subscript𝑏1…subscript𝑎𝑘subscript𝑏𝑘#𝑤subscript𝑎𝑖#𝑤subscript𝑏𝑖for-all𝑖W_{\\mathbb{Z}^{k}}=\\{w\\in\\{a_{1},b_{1},\\ldots,a_{k},b_{k}\\}^{*}:\\#(w,a_{i})=\\#(w,b_{i}),\\forall i\\}. Ambainis and Watrous [ref]2 showed that Le​q∈𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠​(n4,ϵ,2,ℂ~)subscript𝐿𝑒𝑞𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠superscript𝑛4italic-ϵ2~ℂL_{eq}\\in\\mathsf{coR2QCFA}(n^{4},\\epsilon,2,\\widetilde{\\mathbb{C}}), ∀ϵ∈ℝ>0for-allitalic-ϵsubscriptℝabsent0\\forall\\epsilon\\in\\mathbb{R}_{>0}. We note that the same method would easily imply the same result for Wℤsubscript𝑊ℤW_{\\mathbb{Z}}, and could be further adapted to produce a similar result for Wℤksubscript𝑊superscriptℤ𝑘W_{\\mathbb{Z}^{k}}. Our first main theorem generalizes and improves upon these results in several ways. Let Π^1subscript^Π1\\widehat{\\Pi}_{1} denote the collections of all finitely generated virtually abelian groups (i.e., all groups that have a finite-index subgroup isomorphic to ℤksuperscriptℤ𝑘\\mathbb{Z}^{k}, for some k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N}, where ℤ0superscriptℤ0\\mathbb{Z}^{0} is the trivial group); we will explain this choice of notation shortly. ∃C∈ℝ>0,∀G∈Π^1,∀ϵ∈ℝ>0formulae-sequence𝐶subscriptℝabsent0formulae-sequencefor-all𝐺subscript^Π1for-allitalic-ϵsubscriptℝabsent0\\exists C\\in\\mathbb{R}_{>0},\\forall G\\in\\widehat{\\Pi}_{1},\\forall\\epsilon\\in\\mathbb{R}_{>0}, WG∈(𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠​(n3,ϵ,2,ℂ~)∩𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠​(nC,ϵ,2,ℚ¯))subscript𝑊𝐺𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠superscript𝑛3italic-ϵ2~ℂ𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠superscript𝑛𝐶italic-ϵ2¯ℚW_{G}\\in(\\mathsf{coR2QCFA}(n^{3},\\epsilon,2,\\widetilde{\\mathbb{C}})\\cap\\mathsf{coR2QCFA}(n^{C},\\epsilon,2,\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}})). By the above observation that Le​q=(a∗​b∗)∩Wℤsubscript𝐿𝑒𝑞superscript𝑎superscript𝑏subscript𝑊ℤL_{eq}=(a^{*}b^{*})\\cap W_{\\mathbb{Z}}, the following corollary is immediate. ∃C∈ℝ>0,∀ϵ∈ℝ>0formulae-sequence𝐶subscriptℝabsent0for-allitalic-ϵsubscriptℝabsent0\\exists C\\in\\mathbb{R}_{>0},\\forall\\epsilon\\in\\mathbb{R}_{>0}, Le​q∈(𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠​(n3,ϵ,2,ℂ~)∩𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠​(nC,ϵ,2,ℚ¯))subscript𝐿𝑒𝑞𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠superscript𝑛3italic-ϵ2~ℂ𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠superscript𝑛𝐶italic-ϵ2¯ℚL_{eq}\\in(\\mathsf{coR2QCFA}(n^{3},\\epsilon,2,\\widetilde{\\mathbb{C}})\\cap\\mathsf{coR2QCFA}(n^{C},\\epsilon,2,\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}})). The above corollary improves upon the result of Ambainis and Watrous [ref]2 in two distinct senses. Firstly, using the same set of permissible transition amplitudes, our result has a better expected running time. Secondly, our result shows that Le​qsubscript𝐿𝑒𝑞L_{eq} can be recognized by a 2QCFA with transition amplitudes in ℚ¯¯ℚ\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}, which still runs in expected polynomial time. Let 𝖢𝖥𝖫𝖢𝖥𝖫\\mathsf{CFL} denote the context-free languages (languages recognized by non-deterministic pushdown automata), 𝖮𝖢𝖫𝖮𝖢𝖫\\mathsf{OCL} denote the one-counter languages (languages recognized by non-deterministic pushdown automata with single-symbol stack alphabet) and 𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒−𝖢𝖥𝖫𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖢𝖥𝖫\\mathsf{poly{-}CFL} (resp. 𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒−𝖮𝖢𝖫𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖮𝖢𝖫\\mathsf{poly{-}OCL}) denote the intersection of finitely many context-free (resp. one-counter) languages.

Moreover, as WG∈𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒−𝖮𝖢𝖫∩𝖢𝖥𝖫⇔G⇔subscript𝑊𝐺𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖮𝖢𝖫𝖢𝖥𝖫𝐺W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{poly{-}OCL}\\cap\\mathsf{CFL}\\Leftrightarrow G is a finitely generated virtually cyclic group , the above corollary exhibits a wide class of non-context-free languages that are recognizable by a 2QCFA in polynomial time: the word problem of any group that is virtually ℤksuperscriptℤ𝑘\\mathbb{Z}^{k}, k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2. Interestingly, the limiting factor on the running time of the 2QCFA for any of the above word problems (or Le​qsubscript𝐿𝑒𝑞L_{eq}) is not the difficulty of distinguishing strings in the language from strings not in the language, but is instead due to the apparent difficulty of using a 2QCFA to produce a Boolean random variable with a particular (rather extreme) bias. In particular, we make use of the procedure (from [ref]2) that allows a 2QCFA, on an input of size n𝑛n, to generate a Boolean value that is 111 with probability essentially n−1superscript𝑛1n^{-1}, in time O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}). If, for some δ∈(0,1)𝛿01\\delta\\in(0,1), it were possible for a 2QCFA to produce a Boolean variable that has value 111 with probability n−δsuperscript𝑛𝛿n^{-\\delta} in time r​(n)𝑟𝑛r(n), then our technique would immediately show that ∀G∈Π^1,∀ϵ∈ℝ>0formulae-sequencefor-all𝐺subscript^Π1for-allitalic-ϵsubscriptℝabsent0\\forall G\\in\\widehat{\\Pi}_{1},\\forall\\epsilon\\in\\mathbb{R}_{>0}, WG∈𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠​((n+r​(n))​nδ,ϵ,2,ℂ~)subscript𝑊𝐺𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠𝑛𝑟𝑛superscript𝑛𝛿italic-ϵ2~ℂW_{G}\\in\\mathsf{coR2QCFA}((n+r(n))n^{\\delta},\\epsilon,2,\\widetilde{\\mathbb{C}}). Next, let Fksubscript𝐹𝑘F_{k} denote the free group of rank k𝑘k, for k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N}; in particular, F0subscript𝐹0F_{0} is the trivial group, F1subscript𝐹1F_{1} is the group ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}, and, for any k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2, Fksubscript𝐹𝑘F_{k} is non-abelian. Notice that WF2subscript𝑊subscript𝐹2W_{F_{2}} is closely related to the language Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal}. Ambainis and Watrous [ref]2 showed that, ∀ϵ∈ℝ>0for-allitalic-ϵsubscriptℝabsent0\\forall\\epsilon\\in\\mathbb{R}_{>0}, ∃D∈ℝ≥1𝐷subscriptℝabsent1\\exists D\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 1}, such that Lp​a​l∈𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠​(Dn,ϵ,2,ℚ¯)subscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠superscript𝐷𝑛italic-ϵ2¯ℚL_{pal}\\in\\mathsf{coR2QCFA}(D^{n},\\epsilon,2,\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}), and the same method would show the same result for WF2subscript𝑊subscript𝐹2W_{F_{2}}. We show that the same result holds for any group built from free groups, using certain operations. Let Π^2subscript^Π2\\widehat{\\Pi}_{2} denote the collection of all finitely generated groups that are virtually a subgroup of a direct product of finitely many finite-rank free groups. ∀G∈Π^2,∀ϵ∈ℝ>0,∃D∈ℝ≥1formulae-sequencefor-all𝐺subscript^Π2formulae-sequencefor-allitalic-ϵsubscriptℝabsent0𝐷subscriptℝabsent1\\forall G\\in\\widehat{\\Pi}_{2},\\forall\\epsilon\\in\\mathbb{R}_{>0},\\exists D\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 1}, such that WG∈𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠​(Dn,ϵ,2,ℚ¯)subscript𝑊𝐺𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠superscript𝐷𝑛italic-ϵ2¯ℚW_{G}\\in\\mathsf{coR2QCFA}(D^{n},\\epsilon,2,\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}). As WG∈𝖢𝖥𝖫⇔G⇔subscript𝑊𝐺𝖢𝖥𝖫𝐺W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{CFL}\\Leftrightarrow G is a finitely generated virtually free group , we obtain the following. ∀WG∈𝖢𝖥𝖫,∀ϵ∈ℝ>0,∃D∈ℝ≥1formulae-sequencefor-allsubscript𝑊𝐺𝖢𝖥𝖫formulae-sequencefor-allitalic-ϵsubscriptℝabsent0𝐷subscriptℝabsent1\\forall W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{CFL},\\forall\\epsilon\\in\\mathbb{R}_{>0},\\exists D\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 1}, such that WG∈𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠​(Dn,ϵ,2,ℚ¯)subscript𝑊𝐺𝖼𝗈𝖱𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠superscript𝐷𝑛italic-ϵ2¯ℚW_{G}\\in\\mathsf{coR2QCFA}(D^{n},\\epsilon,2,\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}). Consider the homomorphism π:F2×F2→ℤ:𝜋→subscript𝐹2subscript𝐹2ℤ\\pi:F_{2}\\times F_{2}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{Z}, where π𝜋\\pi takes each free generator of each copy of F2subscript𝐹2F_{2} to a single generator of ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}; then K=ker⁡π𝐾kernel𝜋K=\\ker\\pi is finitely generated, but not finitely presented .

We next consider a broader class of groups. Let Z​(H)𝑍𝐻Z(H) denote the center of a group H𝐻H, let U⁡(d,ℚ¯)U𝑑¯ℚ\\operatorname{U}(d,\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}) denote the group of d×d𝑑𝑑d\\times d unitary matrices with entries in ℚ¯¯ℚ\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}, let PU⁡(d,ℚ¯)=U⁡(d,ℚ¯)/Z​(U⁡(d,ℚ¯))PU𝑑¯ℚU𝑑¯ℚ𝑍U𝑑¯ℚ\\operatorname{PU}(d,\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}})=\\operatorname{U}(d,\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}})/Z(\\operatorname{U}(d,\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}})), and let (PU⁡(d,ℚ¯))ksuperscriptPU𝑑¯ℚ𝑘(\\operatorname{PU}(d,\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}))^{k} denote the direct product of k𝑘k copies of PU⁡(d,ℚ¯)PU𝑑¯ℚ\\operatorname{PU}(d,\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}).

In order to state our final main result, as well as to provide appropriate context for the results listed above, we define the classes of groups ΣjsubscriptΣ𝑗\\Sigma_{j} and ΠjsubscriptΠ𝑗\\Pi_{j}, for j∈ℕ𝑗ℕj\\in\\mathbb{N}, inductively. First Σ0=Π0={ℤ,{1}}subscriptΣ0subscriptΠ0ℤ1\\Sigma_{0}=\\Pi_{0}=\\{\\mathbb{Z},\\{1\\}\\} (i.e., both classes consist of the two groups ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z} and the trivial group {1}1\\{1\\}). We use ×\\times to denote the direct product and ∗∗\\ast to denote the free product. For j>1𝑗1j>1, we define Πj={H1×⋯×Ht:t∈ℕ≥1,H1,…,Ht∈Σj−1}subscriptΠ𝑗conditional-setsubscript𝐻1⋯subscript𝐻𝑡formulae-sequence𝑡subscriptℕabsent1subscript𝐻1…subscript𝐻𝑡subscriptΣ𝑗1\\Pi_{j}=\\{H_{1}\\times\\cdots\\times H_{t}:t\\in\\mathbb{N}_{\\geq 1},H_{1},\\ldots,H_{t}\\in\\Sigma_{j-1}\\} and Σj={H1∗⋯∗Ht:t∈ℕ≥1,H1,…,Ht∈Πj−1}subscriptΣ𝑗conditional-set∗subscript𝐻1⋯subscript𝐻𝑡formulae-sequence𝑡subscriptℕabsent1subscript𝐻1…subscript𝐻𝑡subscriptΠ𝑗1\\Sigma_{j}=\\{H_{1}\\ast\\cdots\\ast H_{t}:t\\in\\mathbb{N}_{\\geq 1},H_{1},\\ldots,H_{t}\\in\\Pi_{j-1}\\}. These groups comprise an important subclass of a particularly important class of groups: the right-angled Artin groups. Note that every G∈⋃j(Πj∪Σj)𝐺subscript𝑗subscriptΠ𝑗subscriptΣ𝑗G\\in\\bigcup_{j}(\\Pi_{j}\\cup\\Sigma_{j}) is finitely generated. Also note that the ΠjsubscriptΠ𝑗\\Pi_{j} and ΣjsubscriptΣ𝑗\\Sigma_{j} form a hierarchy in the obvious way. We further define Π^jsubscript^Π𝑗\\widehat{\\Pi}_{j} (resp. Σ^jsubscript^Σ𝑗\\widehat{\\Sigma}_{j}) as the set of all finitely generated groups that are virtually a subgroup of some group in ΠjsubscriptΠ𝑗\\Pi_{j} (resp. ΣjsubscriptΣ𝑗\\Sigma_{j}), which also form a hierarchy in the obvious way. In particular, Π^1subscript^Π1\\widehat{\\Pi}_{1} (resp. Π^2subscript^Π2\\widehat{\\Pi}_{2}) is precisely the class of groups for which Theorem 1.2 (resp. Theorem 1.3) demonstrates the existence of a 2QCFA that recognizes the corresponding word problem with bounded error in expected polynomial (resp. exponential) time. We next consider the class Π^3subscript^Π3\\widehat{\\Pi}_{3}. While the relationship of this class to the class of groups to which Theorem 1.4 applies is unclear to us, we can show that the word problem of any group in this class can be recognized by a 2QCFA with negative one-sided unbounded error.

Lastly, we consider 2QCFA with no restrictions on their transition amplitudes, as well as the measure-once one-way quantum finite automaton (MO-1QFA) defined by Moore and Crutchfield . Let 𝖼𝗈𝖭𝟣𝖰𝖥𝖠𝖼𝗈𝖭𝟣𝖰𝖥𝖠\\mathsf{coN1QFA} denote the class of languages recognizable with negative one-sided unbounded error by a MO-1QFA (with any constant number of states).

Let 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} denote the class of groups to which the preceding theorem applies (which includes all groups to which all earlier theorems apply). Let 𝖲𝖲\\mathsf{S} denote the stochastic languages (the class of languages recognizable by PFA with strict cut-points).
