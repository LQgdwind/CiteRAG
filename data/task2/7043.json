      "content": "Paper Title: On the Fine-Grained Query Complexity of Symmetric Functions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo study the fine-grained Watrous conjecture, we start with the following two fundamental symmetric Boolean functions, which are also essential to analyze general symmetric functions: where 1‚â§k‚â§n/21ùëòùëõ21\\leq k\\leq n/2 and where k<lùëòùëôk<l.\nThe famous Deutsch-Jozsa problem [ref]21 and the decision version of the unstructured search problem  can be interpreted as special cases of these two functions. Fefferman and Kimmel considered the subset-sized checking problem  , where the nùëõn-bit input string is promised to have either nùëõ\\sqrt{n} or 0.99‚Äãn0.99ùëõ0.99\\sqrt{n} many marked items, and the goal is to decide which case. Their result together with  proved that it can be served as an oracle separation between ùñ†ùñ¨ùñ†ùñ¨\\mathsf{AM} and ùñ∞ùñ¢ùñ¨ùñ†ùñ∞ùñ¢ùñ¨ùñ†\\mathsf{QCMA}.\nOn a similar flavour,  introduced the approximate counting problem, where the nùëõn-bit input has either ‚â§wabsentùë§\\leq w or ‚â•2‚Äãwabsent2ùë§\\geq 2w many marked items.\nOur function fnk,l‚Äã(‚ãÖ)superscriptsubscriptùëìùëõùëòùëô‚ãÖf_{n}^{k,l}(\\cdot) can be seen as a symmetric variant of these two problems111Our problem can also be seen as a Gap-Threshold function. Threshold function is defined as fnk‚Äã(x)=1subscriptsuperscriptùëìùëòùëõùë•1f^{k}_{n}(x)=1 iff |x|‚â•kùë•ùëò|x|\\geq k.. We study the tradeoff between the number of queries and the optimal success probabilities in quantum and randomized settings for both functions with errors close to 1/2. We further consider the relation between various complexity measures of partial symmetric Boolean functions. For total Boolean functions, it has been proved that several fundamental complexity measures are polynomial equivalent (See Table 1 in [ref]4). Moreover, the tight bounds on several fundamental complexity measures of total symmetric Boolean functions have also been obtained . However, the result for partial symmetric Boolean functions has not been fully characterized. Our contribution is as follows. For convenience, if fùëìf is a symmetric Boolean function, we denote f‚Äã(k)=f‚Äã(x)ùëìùëòùëìùë•f(k)=f(x) for any |x|=kùë•ùëò|x|=k. Additionally, we say an nùëõn-bit Boolean function f:D‚Üí{0,1}:ùëì‚Üíùê∑01f:D\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\} is even if f‚Äã(|x|)=f‚Äã(n‚àí|x|)ùëìùë•ùëìùëõùë•f(|x|)=f(n-|x|) for any x‚ààDùë•ùê∑x\\in D, where D‚äÜ{0,1}nùê∑superscript01ùëõD\\subseteq\\{0,1\\}^{n}. For both randomized setting and quantum setting, we characterize the optimal success probability of algorithms given the number of queries for the function fnksuperscriptsubscriptùëìùëõùëòf_{n}^{k} (Theorem¬†1.3) and fnk,lsuperscriptsubscriptùëìùëõùëòùëôf_{n}^{k,l} (Theorems¬†1.4 and¬†1.5). As a corollary, we show for any TùëáT-query quantum algorithm to compute fnksuperscriptsubscriptùëìùëõùëòf_{n}^{k} and fnk,lsuperscriptsubscriptùëìùëõùëòùëôf_{n}^{k,l}, there exist classical randomized algorithms using ùóâùóàùóÖùóí‚Äã(T)ùóâùóàùóÖùóíùëá\\mathsf{poly}(T) queries to simulate the success probability of the quantum algorithm (Corollaries¬†1.6 and¬†1.7). Additionally, we characterize the exact quantum query complexity of fnksuperscriptsubscriptùëìùëõùëòf_{n}^{k} (Theorem¬†1.8). We establish a relation between the number of queries and the bias of quantum and randomized algorithms to compute total symmetric Boolean functions, where the bias of the algorithms can be arbitrarily small (Theorem¬†1.9). As a corollary, we prove a weak version of Conjecture 1.2:\nthe acceptance probability of a quantum\nquery algorithm to compute a total symmetric Boolean function can be approximated by a randomized algorithm with only a polynomial increase in the number of queries, where the bias of quantum algorithms can be arbitrarily small (Corollary 1.10). We investigate the relation between different complexity measures of partial symmetric Boolean functions.\nSpecifically, Theorem 1.12 shows the relation between the quantum query complexity and the approximate degree of even partial symmetric Boolean functions for arbitrarily small bias222Theorem¬†1.12 is also a new result for total symmetric Boolean functions..\nTheorem 1.13 shows exact quantum query complexity and degree are quadratically related.\nTheorem¬†1.14 presents tight bounds of block sensitivity, fractional block sensitivity, quantum query complexity, and approximate degree, where quantum query complexity and approximate degree are in a bounded-error setting. Corollary¬†1.15 shows block sensitivity is an upper bound of quantum query complexity. Since it has been known that Q‚Äã(f)‚â•Œ©‚Äã(ùñªùóå‚Å°(f))ùëÑùëìŒ©ùñªùóåùëìQ(f)\\geq\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\operatorname{\\mathsf{bs}}(f)}) for any (possibly partial) Boolean function fùëìf , quantum query complexity and block sensitivity of partial symmetric Boolean functions are polynomially related.\nOn the converse, Theorem 1.16 shows\nan exponential gap between the exact quantum query complexity and randomized query complexity for some partial symmetric Boolean functions, which is different from total symmetric functions. The acceptance probability of a TùëáT-query quantum algorithm to compute a Boolean function can be approximated by a deterministic algorithm using poly‚Äã(T,1/œµ,1/Œ¥)polyùëá1italic-œµ1ùõø\\mathrm{poly}(T,1/\\epsilon,1/\\delta) queries within an additive error œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon on a 1‚àíŒ¥1ùõø1-\\delta fraction of inputs. For T>0ùëá0T>0, the quantum TùëáT-bias and classical TùëáT-bias of fnksuperscriptsubscriptùëìùëõùëòf_{n}^{k} are For fnk,lsuperscriptsubscriptùëìùëõùëòùëôf_{n}^{k,l} and T>0ùëá0T>0, the quantum TùëáT-bias is If T=O‚Äã((n‚àík)‚Äãl(l‚àík)2)ùëáùëÇùëõùëòùëôsuperscriptùëôùëò2T=O\\left(\\frac{(n-k)l}{(l-k)^{2}}\\right), the classical TùëáT-bias of fnk,lsuperscriptsubscriptùëìùëõùëòùëôf_{n}^{k,l} satisfies that If T=Œ©‚Äã((n‚àík)‚Äãl(l‚àík)2)ùëáŒ©ùëõùëòùëôsuperscriptùëôùëò2T=\\Omega\\left(\\frac{(n-k)l}{(l-k)^{2}}\\right), then Œ¥C‚Äã(fnk,l,T)=Œò‚Äã(1)subscriptùõøùê∂superscriptsubscriptùëìùëõùëòùëôùëáŒò1\\delta_{C}\\left(f_{n}^{k,l},T\\right)=\\Theta(1). For arbitrarily small bias Œ≤>0ùõΩ0\\beta>0, if there exists a quantum algorithm using TùëáT queries to compute fnksuperscriptsubscriptùëìùëõùëòf_{n}^{k} with success probability 1/2+Œ≤12ùõΩ1/2+\\beta, then there also exists a classical randomized algorithm using O‚Äã(T2)ùëÇsuperscriptùëá2O(T^{2}) queries to compute fnksuperscriptsubscriptùëìùëõùëòf_{n}^{k}\nwith the same success probability. For arbitrarily small bias Œ≤>0ùõΩ0\\beta>0, if there exists a quantum algorithm using TùëáT queries to compute fnk,lsuperscriptsubscriptùëìùëõùëòùëôf_{n}^{k,l} with success probability 1/2+Œ≤12ùõΩ1/2+\\beta, then there also exist classical randomized algorithms using T2superscriptùëá2T^{2} queries to compute fnk,lsuperscriptsubscriptùëìùëõùëòùëôf_{n}^{k,l} with success probability 1/2+Œ©‚Äã(Œ≤2)12Œ©superscriptùõΩ21/2+\\Omega\\left(\\beta^{2}\\right) and using T4superscriptùëá4T^{4} queries to compute fnk,lsuperscriptsubscriptùëìùëõùëòùëôf_{n}^{k,l} with success probability 1/2+Œ©‚Äã(Œ≤)12Œ©ùõΩ1/2+\\Omega\\left(\\beta\\right). Thus The exact quantum query complexity of fnksuperscriptsubscriptùëìùëõùëòf_{n}^{k} satisfies ‚åàœÄ2‚ÄãŒ∏‚åâ‚â§QE‚Äã(fnk)‚â§‚åàœÄ2‚ÄãŒ∏‚åâ+2ùúã2ùúÉsubscriptùëÑùê∏superscriptsubscriptùëìùëõùëòùúã2ùúÉ2\\lceil\\frac{\\pi}{2\\theta}\\rceil\\leq Q_{E}(f_{n}^{k})\\leq\\lceil\\frac{\\pi}{2\\theta}\\rceil+2, where Œ∏=2‚Äãarcsin‚Å°k/nùúÉ2ùëòùëõ\\theta=2\\arcsin{\\sqrt{k/n}}, whereas the zero-error randomized query complexity of fnksuperscriptsubscriptùëìùëõùëòf_{n}^{k} is n‚àík+1ùëõùëò1n-k+1.

Corollary 1.10 is a randomized version of Conjecture 1.2. Additionally, Corollary 1.10 considers total symmetric Boolean functions, while Conjecture 1.2 refers to any Boolean function. For any (possibly partial) symmetric Boolean function fùëìf satisfying f‚Äã(x)=f‚Äã(n‚àíx)ùëìùë•ùëìùëõùë•f(x)=f(n-x) and arbitrarily small Œ≤>0ùõΩ0\\beta>0, if T=ùñΩùñæùóÄ~12‚àíŒ≤‚Å°(f)ùëásubscript~ùñΩùñæùóÄ12ùõΩùëìT=\\operatorname{\\mathsf{\\widetilde{deg}}}_{\\frac{1}{2}-\\beta}(f),\nthere exists a quantum query algorithm using ‚åàT/2‚åâùëá2\\lceil T/2\\rceil queries to compute fùëìf with success probability 1/2+Œ©‚Äã(Œ≤/T)12Œ©ùõΩùëá1/2+\\Omega\\left(\\beta/\\sqrt{T}\\right).\nNamely, As a corollary, we have Qœµ(f)=O(ùñΩùñæùóÄ~œµ(f)2)Q_{\\epsilon}(f)=O(\\operatorname{\\mathsf{\\widetilde{deg}}}_{\\epsilon}(f)^{2}) for any error œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon arbitrarily close to 1/2121/2.

For any partial symmetric Boolean function fùëìf, we have For any partial symmetric Boolean function fùëìf, we have Q‚Äã(f)=O‚Äã(ùñªùóå‚Å°(f))ùëÑùëìùëÇùñªùóåùëìQ(f)=O\\left(\\operatorname{\\mathsf{bs}}(f)\\right).
