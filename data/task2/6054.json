      "content": "Paper Title: Controllable One-Shot Face Video Synthesis With Semantic Aware Prior\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKeypoint-based warping method\nKeypoint-based warping models represent the pose and expression transformations using explicit motion fields estimated via keypoints. These model then warp and synthesize the target faces based on the estimated motion fields.\nEarly models use facial landmarks as such keypoints  0 and warp directly on the source image, which often leads to unnatural head deformation.\nAs facial landmarks allow identity-related information from the driver to be transferred into the generated video, most methods are limited in achieving identity preserving 0  .\nMarioNETte 1 tries to solve this problem with a landmark formation method. However, the result is still not satisfactory for the one-shot case [ref]38. Recently, unsupervised keypoints based warping methods, which leverage first-order motion to warp the latent feature maps, achieve state-of-the-art performance with much more compact keypoints than landmarks    [ref]35 4   .\nFace-vid2vid [ref]35 proposes to detect unsupervised 3D keypoints in the canonical space, which disengages identity from expression and obtains improved identity-preserving ability. Furthermore, conducting warping in 3D space allows free-view control.\nFollowing the unsupervised keypoint-based paradigm, DaGAN 4 learns a self-supervised learned depth map as a supplementary modality. Mallya et. al.  propose a transformer-based implicit warping method to learn from multiple source images. These techniques are orthogonal to our method and may be combined for better performance. However, the unsupervised learned keypoints do not necessarily match the precise locations of the face like facial landmarks do . It is tempting to see how landmarks perform when equipped with the more recent flow-estimation method used in the unsupervised keypoint-based framework. Oquab et.al.  is the first to compare the off-the-shelf 2D facial landmarks and the unsupervised learned landmarks under a unified keypoint-based framework . They use 2D landmark prediction model to obtain the keypoints, which suffer from the identity loss issue as mentioned before. They reach the conclusion that landmarks are not superior to unsupervised keypoints. Building upon the recent unsupervised 3D keypoint-based methods, we leverage the external semantic-aware prior and achieve improvements across different bandwidth budgets. 3D-face-based warping method 3D face reconstruction models   provide valuable prior information about human face. Recent methods apply it to 2D images for rendering 3D dense meshes, which are used to learn a dense flow estimator to warp the image in the input space [ref]38  . The warped image is then refined by another generator to create a more realistic image.\nAlternatively, Ren et.al.   directly induce the 3D face parameters into a flow estimator without utilizing the motion descriptors (e.g. keypoints, landmarks or edges). However, this leads to spatial information loss , which makes their method achieve worse geometric correspondence than the recent keypoint warping-based methods  . In this paper, we mainly leverage the 3D prior to improve the keypoints-based methods. Direct synthesis methods Direct synthesis methods aim to directly generate the result without explicit warping. Early methods  1 take landmarks as the input for guiding generation. Recent studies focus on the extraction and disentanglement of pose and identity in the latent space  9 9, where a meta-model is finetuned on a specific person under a few-shot setting. This line of methods enjoys better robustness against large pose changes, but the overall fidelity of the synthesized faces tends to be lower than those produced by warping-based methods . In this work, we induce expression code derived from the semantic aware prior to the generator. Our method thus combines the advantage of the warping-based method and the direct synthesis method. Person-specific methods Person-specific methods conduct learning-based reconstruction 6 7  4 using a long video of the particular actor to reenact. Despite achieving impressive visual results, they do not generalize well to unseen identities. In this work, we mainly focus on the one-shot talking head synthesis setting, which can be applied to a new person using a single image.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: are limited in achieving identity preserving 0  .\nMarioNETte 1 tries to solve this problem with a landmark formation method.
