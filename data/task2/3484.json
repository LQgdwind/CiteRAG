Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11.

Table 1 shows the total performance of the six compilers compiling from 𝖢𝖭𝖥𝖢𝖭𝖥\\mathsf{CNF} to the target language. Overall, 𝖯𝖺𝗇𝗂𝗇𝗂𝖯𝖺𝗇𝗂𝗇𝗂\\mathsf{Panini} compiled 37, 89, 21, 212, and 35 more instances than BDDC, miniC2D, c2d, Dsharp, and D4, respectively.\nWe remark that 𝖯𝖺𝗇𝗂𝗇𝗂𝖯𝖺𝗇𝗂𝗇𝗂\\mathsf{Panini} compiled 58, 168, 43, 251, and 44 more instances than BDDC, miniC2D, c2d, Dsharp, and D4 respectively without the usage of pmc.\nFigures 4a and 4b show the cactus plots for runtime and compilation sizes (in terms of edges in the DAG) for all six compilers.\nThe x𝑥x-axis gives the number of benchmarks; and\nthe y𝑦y-axis is compiling time (resp. compilation sizes), i.e.,\na point (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y) in Figure 4a shows that x𝑥x benchmarks took less than or equal to y𝑦y seconds to compile.\nThe results show that 𝖯𝖺𝗇𝗂𝗇𝗂𝖯𝖺𝗇𝗂𝗇𝗂\\mathsf{Panini} can give start-of-the-art compilation\nboth in runtime and compiled size.\nWe show the space performance of 𝖢𝖢𝖣𝖣𝖢𝖢𝖣𝖣\\mathsf{CCDD} on some selected instances in Table 2.\nThe experimental results show that 𝖢𝖢𝖣𝖣𝖢𝖢𝖣𝖣\\mathsf{CCDD} has obvious space advantage and there are many kernelized nodes in the compiled forms.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: 𝖯𝖺𝗇𝗂𝗇𝗂𝖯𝖺𝗇𝗂𝗇𝗂\\mathsf{Panini} with state-of-the-art compilers for\nthe following target languages:\n(i) 𝖲𝖣𝖣𝖲𝖣𝖣\\mathsf{SDD} with miniC2D ;\n(ii) 𝖮𝖡𝖣𝖣​[∧]𝖮𝖡𝖣𝖣delimited-[]\\mathsf{OBDD[\\wedge]} with BDDC [ref]20;\n(iii) Decision-𝖣𝖭𝖭𝖥𝖣𝖭𝖭𝖥\\mathsf{DNNF} with c2d , Dsharp  and D4 .\nWe used the widely employed pre-processing tool pmc  for all the instances, which preserves the equivalence between input\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
