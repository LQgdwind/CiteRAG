      "content": "Paper Title: A Feature Memory Rearrangement Network for Visual Inspection of Textured Surface Defects Toward Edge Intelligent Manufacturing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVarious approaches have been proposed for applying DNNs in unsupervised textured surface inspection, which is a topic of increasing interest in the computer vision field. To the best of our knowledge, the most prominent class of techniques for this purpose is deep generative models, which can be further categorized into two subtypes, autoencoders (AEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), along with their extensions. An autoencoder (AE) is one type of unsupervised neural network in which the output target is to reconstruct the input data. In anomaly detection, the reconstruction error serves as a criterion for the anomaly property based on the fact that an AE accepts only normal samples as training data; thus, the reconstruction result for anomalous input should be unpredictable and yield a higher reconstruction error. However, this assumption may not always hold due to the strong generalizability of DNNs and the possibility that anomalies may be entangled with normal patterns in the latent space, in which case the AE will also prefer to reconstruct even anomalies well. To mitigate this drawback, many extensions have been proposed. The MSCDAE of Mei et al.[ref]19 utilizes a three-layer pyramid to perform textured surface defect inspection. Yang et al. proposed a multiscale feature-clustering-based fully convolutional AE (MS-FCAE), which focuses on constraining the feature distribution to eliminate defects during reconstruction. Gong et al.  proposed MemAE, in which sparse coding of latent representations and memory-based reconstruction are introduced to eliminate abnormal generalization. [ref]26 proposed a masked AE trained in a self-supervised fashion, which applies random removal and reconstruction of image regions through partial inpainting, thereby suppressing the generalization of the AE. However, a tradeoff exists between reconstruction quality for normal textures and defect suppression, limiting the defect inspection performance of AEs. Recent developments in many visual tasks, such as texture synthesis and image style transfer, have shown that GANs have an outstanding generative ability and are highly capable of capturing the internal distributions of data. For reconstruction-based texture inspection, a GAN can leverage texture generation and restoration, in contrast to the simple texture reconstruction of AE-based models, to convert defective regions to the background texture profile. proposed a GAN-integrated AE by replacing the decoder of an AE with the generator of a GAN. [ref]30 proposed an anomaly feature-editing-based adversarial network (AFEAN) that suppresses the reconstruction of defects by means of latent feature editing.  proposed GANomaly, which jointly minimizes the distance between normal and pseudo samples in the image/latent domain; however, further experiments revealed that the clarity of the reconstructed image is limited in such an isolated bottleneck connected encoder–decoder network. To address this challenge, one natural approach named Skip-GANomaly was proposed in by introducing ‘skip connections’. Although high-quality image reconstruction was achieved, unrepaired anomalous regions unfortunately remained due to the trivial solution of propagating low-level features directly to the last layers of the model. The AFEAN of[ref]30 also ignored the impact of skip connections. Overall, the phenomena of overinspection and misinspection remain as unresolved shortcomings in the above literature due to the following challenges. Only defect-free samples are employed for training, which limits the defect recognition ability of the model, and the tradeoff between anomaly elimination and high-quality reconstruction is difficult to balance. Moreover, inefficient unimodal defect localization techniques, such as naïve image subtraction, restrict the inspection performance.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: normal patterns in the latent space, in which case the AE will also prefer to reconstruct even anomalies well.
