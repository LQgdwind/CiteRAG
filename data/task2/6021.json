Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Partial Correlation based Deep Visual Representation for Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. We conduct experiments using one scene and five fine-grained image datasets: the MIT Indoor dataset , Airplane , Birds , Cars , DTD  and iNaturalist [ref]40.\nWe also use ImageNet100 (a subset of ImageNet-1K dataset) proposed by Tian et al. [ref]39 and mini-ImageNet . We follow the widely used training and testing protocols of Bilinear CNN . The details of datasets and protocols are provided in Appendix A. Metric for evaluations. For evaluation of different methods, average classification accuracy is used. This metric is widely used in literature, e.g.,  [ref]23. Implementation details. Our method is implemented using PyTorch 1.9. We use ImageNet-1K pre-trained backbones provided in Torchvision 0.13.0 library. Following the recent works  [ref]23, the number of feature channels is reduced to 256 with 1×1111\\times 1 convolution for efficiency and fair comparisons.\nAll images are resized to 448×448448448448\\times 448 and the training is conducted by randomly flipping them horizontally.\nWe fine-tune all backbones for 50-100 epochs with AdamW optimiser  for an initial learning rate of 0.00012, and ConvNext-T CNN and Swin-T with an initial learning rate 0.00005. For all backbones, we decrease the learning rate by a factor of 10 at the 15th and 30th epochs. Depending on the dataset and backbones, our fine-tuning process lasts for about 3-8 hours on four P100 GPUs.\nFor ImageNet100, ResNet-50 was trained\nfor 100 epochs with the initial learning rate 0.01, reduced by 10 at the 15th, 30th and 45th epochs.\nSettings are detailed in Appendix B.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: Datasets.

The\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
