      "content": "Paper Title: DM2S2: Deep Multimodal Sequence Sets with Hierarchical Modality Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn industry (e.g., digital advertising [ref]1  and e-commerce  ), huge amounts of multimodal data are often obtained, in which each instance is described as a set of information from multiple modalities.\nThus, handling multimodal information is a fundamental problem in most web applications.\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) also experience technical challenges in handling multimodal data . The mainstream approaches of multimodal models are based on a mid-fusion architecture, which encodes the data from each modality and then concatenates multiple features [ref]6 .\nPrevious studies have explored various mid-fusion models, such as the gated multimodal units (GMU) [ref]6 and neural architecture search (NAS)-based models .\nHowever, mid-fusion models often face several challenges.\nFirst, as the number of modalities increases, the dimensionality of the concatenated features generally increases as well.\nMoreover, mid-fusion models require the impractical assumption that each instance in a dataset must have the same number of modalities without missing information. To address the above multimodal problems, Reiter et al. [ref]8 proposed deep multimodal sets (DMMS) based on Deep Sets , which is a class of models that is defined according to sets.\nThe underlying concept of DMMS is that a function defined on sets should satisfy the invariance to the number and order of elements in a set (i.e., modalities).\nHowever, as DMMS encodes/compresses each modality and then further compresses the features using a pooling operation, the architecture may omit the importance of signals in a single modality. Although set-aware architectures such as DMMS [ref]8 can deal with “unordered” sets of modalities, the data in multimodal information takes various forms; certain types of data are inherently sequential (e.g., text tokens), whereas others are not (e.g., categorical data).\nRecent BERT -based multimodal methods often convert an image into textual tokens using optical character recognition (OCR), and thus, obtain a textual sequence   .\nIn particular, such a preprocessing technique is effective in extracting rich semantic information that is difficult to capture by encoding raw modality data.\nTherefore, these situations motivate us to handle sets of sequences. As the interpretability and explainability of the model predictions are indispensable factors in industry, it is necessary to provide an interpretation of the importance of each modality.\nThe DMMS [ref]8 enables an explainable prediction in terms of the importance of the modalities.\nHowever, conventional mid-fusion models may ignore the higher-order interactions between elements across sequences, as they only focus on the fusion of encoded modality representations.\nFurthermore, owing to the black-box nature of DNN-based models, such “encode-and-concatenate” models do not provide a breakdown of the importance of factors in a modality.\nThis is an insufficient diagnosis in a practical setting; for example, it is often desirable to know the element-level importance to investigate the problem in text tokenization. In this study, we propose a new concept for handling multimodal data known as deep multimodal sequence sets (DM2S2).\nOur concept consists of three components that capture the relationship between multiple modalities: (1) a BERT-based encoder, (2) intra-modality residual attention (IntraMRA), and (3) inter-modality residual attention (InterMRA).\nFor (1), the BERT-based encoder outputs a rich representation that handles the inter- and intra-orders of the elements in a modality.\nIn (2), IntraMRA captures the importance of the elements in a modality.\nIn (3), InterMRA further enhances the importance of the elements with modality-level granularity.\nWe employ OCR methods to extract semantic features from multimodal data (especially for the visual modality) that may not be captured by image recognition.\nThe model based on our concept empirically demonstrates that it is preferable to use semantic features that are derived from OCR tokens over features that are encoded directly from visual information.\nOur two-step MRA can capture fine granularity representations that are not explicitly modeled by the DMMS [ref]8. Empirical experiments on various real-world datasets reveal that our sequence set-aware concept achieved performance that is comparable to or better than previous multimodal and set-aware models.\nIn particular, the model based on our concept outperformed those deployed in the production environment on a large-scale production advertising (Ad) dataset.\nFurthermore, the model enables the visualization of the contribution of elements in modalities to model predictions based on the importance that is learned by the MRA. The contributions of this study are summarized as follows: We propose a new model for capturing higher-order interactions, and the inter- and intra-relationships of each modality, considering that multimodal data often include set structured contents. Our set-aware model with a multimodal structure achieves equivalent or better prediction performance compared to previous multimodal and set-aware models. An evaluation on datasets, including a real-world production dataset, demonstrates that our DM2S2 can be reasonably applied in a real environment. The visualization of the learned MRA weights can be used to explain predictions that are important in industrial fields.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: In industry (e.g., digital advertising [ref]1  and e-commerce  ), huge amounts of multimodal data are often obtained, in which each instance is described as a set of information from multiple modalities.\nThus, handling multimodal\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
