WESPAD first learns to partition and then distort word representations, which acts as a regularizer and adds generalization capabilities to the model. This method also solves the problem of little training examples for the positive health mentions in the dataset. Although, this method improves the classification accuracy, distorting the original word embedding causes information loss. [ref]6 uses non-contextual word embeddings for tweet health classification. It applies the preprocessing on the given tweet and extracts non-contextual word representations from it, and then passes these representations to Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) . LSTMs-based classifier outperforms Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Decision Trees.  uses a two-stepped approach for the tweet classification. First, it detects whether the disease word is mentioned figuratively or not, and then, it uses this information as a new binary feature combined with other features and applies a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification. Usage of this additional feature improves the classification results. This method does not work well on figurative mention tweets, especially the disease word “heart attack”, one of the most widely used words in the figurative sense.  adds 14k new tweets to the existing health-mention dataset “PHM2017”[ref]7. It also uses emojis by converting them into string representations using the Python library. As a pre-processing, it normalizes the URL and user mentions in the tweet. This work experiments with both non-contextual representations such as word2vec [ref]39 as well as with contextual representations like ELMO  and BERT  and incorporates sentiment information using WordNet , VAD , and ULMFit . It combines the output of the Bi-LSTM  with sentiment information to produce a final binary output that represents classification results. Experiments show that combining BERT and VAD outperforms other methods.  uses permutation-based word representation method  for health mention classification and leverages the emojis as a part of the tweet text by converting them into a text representation. In this paper, we exploit the adversarial training combined with the contrastive learning on the task of HMC. Results show that adversarial training combined with contrastive learning consistently improves the classification score.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: [ref]7 presents a new method namely Word Embedding Space Partitioning and Distortion (WESPAD) for health mention classification on Twitter data.
