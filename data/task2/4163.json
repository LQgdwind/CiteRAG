      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Network Normal Estimation and Bathymetry Reconstruction from Sidescan Sonar\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere have been many attempts to estimate the bathymetry from sidescan, most of which are model-based. Many of the methods are inspired by the technique known as shape-from-shading, which was first proposed by Horn  to estimate the shape of objects from shading information with camera images. Lander & Hebert  and Li & Pai  were among the earliest to use such technique to sidescan sonar images. One of the differences between  and  is that in  they model the sonar’s reflection model as a factorization of the diffuse and specular components, while in  they use the Lambertian model.\nAnother series of model-based methods   use a Lambertian model for the surface scattering process and estimate the bathymetry, the reflectance and the\nbeam-pattern from sidescan at the same time, with an expectation-maximization (EM) approach using gradient descent. Since estimating bathymetry from sidescan is an ill-posed inverse problem, many works have introduced some boundary conditions from bathymetric data. Li & Pai  proposed improving the MBES bathymetry with high-resolution sidescan data when the bathymetric data from MBES is of too coarse a resolution to describe the detailed terrain of the seafloor. The grid-based, sparse bathymetric data is used as control points for the shape-from-shading process. Johnson & Hebert  suggest using the sparse bathymetric data as an initial estimate for the bathymetry, then iteratively refining the bathymetric map by minimizing the error between sidescan backscatter data and the one predicted by the bathymetry. They use smoothness regularization as a constraint. Since they phrase the fitting process as a global optimization problem, in principle, their approach can deal with multiple observations from different sidescan lines. Bore & Folkesson [ref]6 also introduce sparse altimeter readings as a constraint and phrase the bathymetry reconstruction from multiple sidescan lines as a global optimization problem, enforcing smoothness prior on the estimated bathymetry, thus increasing robustness against sensor noise or model errors. They also propose the utilization of GPUs to accelerate such an optimization. In the last decades, a great deal of research into shape-from-shading has focused on data-driven approaches, most of them deep learning. Some recent works have used neural networks to predict the depth  [ref]17  , or surface normals 0 1 or both 2 3 4 from camera images and have achieved state-of-the-art results. Bathymetry reconstruction from sidescan can be seen as an analogous task to 3D reconstruction from monocular camera images. In our previous work , a method was proposed to use a CNN to estimate the depth contours of the seafloor from sidescan images with smoothness regularization. To reduce the gradual increase in depth estimation error as one moves further away from the sidescan sensor, our prior work  introduced sparse depth constraints from altimeter readings along the sonar’s trajectory and reconstructed the bathymetry by fusing multiple bathymetric estimates along with the corresponding prediction uncertainty into a single map. In the recent years, deep learning has been used on sidescan images for other tasks, such as classification 5 6 7, object detection 8 9, bottom tracking 0 1, semantic segmentation 2 3, sidescan generative modeling and simulation 4.\nDzieciuch et al. 5 show that a simple CNN can be used for mine detection in sidescan sonar imagery and achieve comparable accuracy as human operators. Huo et al. 6 publish a sidescan classification dataset of civilian objects and propose a method to generate semi-synthetic data to handle the imbalanced training data. They show that with a pre-trained CNN model on camera images, applying deep transfer learning on sonar images can achieve high accuracy on a classification task. Steiniger et al. 7 compare several ways of dealing with the imbalanced datasets for classification tasks, among which the augmentation of the training data with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 5, e.g., BAGANs 6 could improve the performance of the CNN classifier.\nEinsidler et al. 8 adapt the state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, YOLO (You Only Look Once) 7 on sidescan images and show that deep transfer learning on a pre-trained CNN model with some fine-tuning on the real sidescan dataset could achieve competitive performance on the anomaly detection task. Yu et al. 9 adapt the attention mechanism into the object detection algorithm, namely combining Transformer module 8 with YOLO, and achieve high accuracy and efficiency for underwater objection detection on sidescan images. Although they claim the algorithm could run in real-time, they conduct the experiments on a desktop with a modern CPU and GPU, whose computational power outperforms most of the onboard computers of AUVs.\nYan et al. 0 are the first to apply 1D CNN on sidescan intensity for bottom tracking. They use a sliding window on each sidescan ping to detect the bottom position. They also claim the inference time is short enough for real-time applications but as 9, their experiments are tested with a modern CPU and GPU. Similarly, Qin et al. 1 use a 1D CNN to detect the bottom from sidescan data. They model the bottom tracking as a binary semantic segmentation problem on 1D sidescan data and show that U-Net based architecture has a better performance when the data is noisy.\nRahnemoonfar & Dobbs 2 propose a novel CNN architecture and illustrate it outperforms the state-of-art techniques on pothole semantic segmentation of sidescan images. Wu et al. 3 propose a novel CNN named ECNet to perform semantic segmentation on sidescan with much fewer parameters and much faster speed, making it possible to be applied to real-time tasks on an embedded platform, where their experimental tests were run to compute the inference time.\nBore & Folkesson 4 propose a data-driven approach to simulate realistic sidescan given a bathymetry model with a conditional GAN. In a user survey, they show that the simulated sidescan are realistic enough to be mistaken by sidescan experts. Much of the current work on 3D reconstruction pays particular attention to\nneural rendering and implicit neural representations (INR). Neural rendering aims to produce photo-realistic renderings of a 3D scene from arbitrary viewpoints, given the representation of the scene, such as geometry, semantic structure, material illumination and appearance. By integrating differentiable rendering into the training of the neural networks, neural rendering allows us to address both reconstruction and rendering during joint optimization 9. There is another line of research, implicit neural representations, focusing on different representations for modeling objects in the 3D scene, sometimes also referred to as coordinate-based representations. Other than explicitly describing scenes as voxels, point clouds or meshes, these representations such as Occupancy Networks 0, Deep Signed Distance Function (DeepSDF) 1, Scene Representation Networks (SRNs) , Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [ref]8, and Sinusoidal Representation Networks (SIRENs)  are continuous, differentiable and parameterized by MLPs. Due to the continuous nature of implicit neural representations, it can be more memory efficient than discrete representations since the model size is independent of the spatial resolution; however, the ability to model the fine detail is no longer limited by the discrete grid resolution but by the capacity of the neural networks . Being differentiable means that gradients can be computed using automatic differentiation, enabling us to supervise the gradients directly. To better represent the fine detail in the signals, which contains high-frequency variation in the data, Mildenhall et al. [ref]8 propose to use a sinusoidal function for positional encoding, mapping the inputs to a higher dimensional space. Subsequently, Sitzmann et al.  show that directly using the sine function as a periodic activation function in the MLPs, namely SIRENs, not only outperforms the positional encoding strategy proposed in [ref]8, but also allows constraints on the derivatives of a SIREN to reconstruct signals since the derivative of a SIREN is merely a phase-shifted SIREN. In  they show the great potential of SIRENs on reconstructing scenes with high quality and fidelity.\nBore & Folkesson [ref]6 show that combining a physical Lambertian model with implicit neural representations can be used for estimating a self-consistent bathymetric map from only sidescan images and altimeter readings from a large survey. Another line of research that is closely related to this work is depth and normal estimation from monocular camera images with CNNs. Similar to the empirical discovery [ref]17 that there exists a long-tailed distribution in the histogram of per-pixel depth values in both indoor and outdoor datasets, the depth or surface normal in our existing datasets also exhibits a severe long-tailed distribution. After all, the seafloor often appears featureless. The vanilla ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} or ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} loss function generally used in such pixel-level regression problems will consequently focus more on the ”head” regions. In the monocular depth estimation task, it will result in poorer performance on distant depth regions, while in the depth estimation from sidescan task, it would perform poorly on the ”tail” regions where the seafloor has more features such as boulders and rocks. A common solution to deal with the imbalanced depth distribution is to use a depth-aware loss[ref]17, which weights the errors of pixels according to the corresponding depth, forcing the neural networks to pay more attention to the ”tail” regions during the training.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: a constraint.
