      "content": "Paper Title: Art Creation with Multi-Conditional StyleGANs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe most obvious way to investigate the conditioning is to look at the images produced by the StyleGAN generator.\nHowever, this is highly inefficient, as generating thousands of images is costly and we would need another network to analyze the images.\nThe StyleGAN architecture and in particular the mapping network is very powerful.\nThe mapping network, an 8-layer MLP, is not only used to disentangle the latent space, but also embeds useful information about the condition space.\nHence, we consider a condition space before the synthesis network as a suitable means to investigate the conditioning of the StyleGAN.\nAnalyzing an embedding space before the synthesis network is much more cost-efficient, as it can be analyzed without the need to generate images. As explained in the survey on GAN inversion by Xia et al., a large number of different embedding spaces in the StyleGAN generator may be considered for successful GAN inversion [ref]42.\nUsually these spaces are used to embed a given image back into StyleGAN. Thus, all kinds of modifications, such as image manipulation  [ref]2   7  , image restoration 7 3 9 , and image interpolation [ref]2  3 1 can be applied.\nAn obvious choice would be the aforementioned W𝑊W space, as it is the output of the mapping network.\nHowever, Zhu et al. discovered that “the marginal distributions [in W𝑊W] are heavily skewed and do not follow an obvious pattern” .\nThey therefore proposed the P𝑃P space and building on that the PNsubscript𝑃𝑁P_{N} space.\nThe P𝑃P space can be obtained by inverting the last LeakyReLU activation function in the mapping network that would normally produce the W𝑊W space.\nThe last LeakyReLU has a slope of α=0.2𝛼0.2\\alpha=0.2 and we can thus transform the W𝑊W space to the P𝑃P space with: where 𝐰𝐰\\mathbf{w} and 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} are vectors in the latent spaces W𝑊W and P𝑃P, respectively.\nZhu et al. make the assumption that the joint distribution of points in the latent space P𝑃P approximately follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution .\nTo examine whether the P𝑃P space is a valid embedding space to evaluate the conditioning, we train a conditional StyleGAN on our EnrichedArtEmis data and visualize the marginal distributions of two different conditions in the P𝑃P space, which can be seen in Fig. 2.\nWe observe that the distributions for different conditions differ and that the P𝑃P space appears to follow a Gaussian distribution.\nTo support our assumption that the distributions for different conditions are indeed different, we compare their respective multivariate Gaussian distributions.\nHence, we do not need to invoke the PNsubscript𝑃𝑁P_{N} space, whose main purpose is to eliminate the dependency among latent variables, as the multivariate Gaussian distribution will address these dependencies.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: to generate images.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
