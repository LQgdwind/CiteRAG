      "content": "Paper Title: IAdet: Simplest human-in-the-loop object detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor the IA framework, one would like a well-performing, data-efficient, and fast-to-train model. In other words, we want the model that achieves the best time-performance curve and thus enables the fastest annotation. Note that performance here refers to test performance, which we assume to be statistically identical to the performance over unlabeled samples. In what follows we will restrict our attention to object detection models, but their literature is representative of other areas as well. The best performing models are huge, thus they are not fast to train and are not necessarily data efficient. For instance, the current state-of-the-art in COCO detection [ref]46 is a self-supervised transformer with 3 billion parameters. On the other hand, the most data-efficient models are presumably few-shot object detection models. Few-shot object detection models are usually classified into meta-learned models and finetuned models. Note that both are usually finetuned, and both achieve comparable performance . The meta-learned models are trained with episodes that simulate the few-shot setting by using a limited number of arbitrary query vectors that have to be recognized in the training images.\nIn the IA framework, the amount of annotated data increases, yet meta-learned few-shot models do not scale to more annotations as naturally as the simpler finetuned models .\nMore recently, state-of-the-art few-shot detection performance has been established by leveraging self-supervised representations [ref]5, which suggests that traditionally fine-tuning self-supervised models can be better than using few-shot specific ones. One important lesson from the few-shot learning literature is that full finetuning is usually better than retraining the head only , although simply retraining the head can bring solid performance too . Even if few-shot learning methods have been greatly developed, simple baselines are still competitive . The semi-supervised learning literature explores learning from little annotated data and much more unlabeled data. Self-supervised learning has enabled the extraction of supervised-level representations from unlabeled data only. These representations make further learning (even self-supervised ) easier.\nThese methods usually involve pretraining, but we prefer to save time by starting from already pretrained backbones. How to best do this is studied by transfer learning. A comparison between transfer and self-supervised learning is given in . [ref]31[ref]31 have shown that the most important factor for transfer learning is the source image domain, which should ideally include the target image domain. Moreover, there are metrics one could compute to predict which models would better transfer to a target dataset . If the source and target domain are different, one should look into the domain adaptation literature . In this work, we make transfer learning suitable by using MS-COCO 8 weights to tackle PASCAL VOC: the classes of the former dataset include those of the latter.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: of other areas as well.
