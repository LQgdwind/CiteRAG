      "content": "Paper Title: Are Existing Out-Of-Distribution Techniques Suitable for Network Intrusion Detection?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine learning models are trained under the closed-world assumption, where test data is drawn i.i.d. from the same distribution as the training data.\nHowever, this assumption is often violated and several ML fields try to address the issue of identifying unknown/anomalous/out-of-distribution data: Anomaly detection [ref]11 aims to detect anomalous inputs that deviate from normality, whether in features or labels. Anomaly detection assumes there might be abnormal data in the training set  and treat data as a whole, thus it does not strictly require the correct classification of inputs. Novelty detection is similar to anomaly detection, but assumes the presence of only normal data in the training set and focuses on inputs affected by semantic shift , hence not falling into any of the training classes. In addition, novel inputs are not treated as erroneous and are typically prepared for retraining and future constructive procedures. Open Set Recognition  goes beyond novelty detection and also requires the correct classification of in-distribution (ID) data. The goal is to detect inputs belonging to new classes and correctly classify those from known classes. Open Set Recognition is usually focused on semantic shifts. Outlier detection identifies inputs in a dataset that markedly differ from others. Outlier detection is a pre-processing step and is not applied during inference or training. As introduced in Sec. I, the NIDS setting requires the classification of known traffic and the detection of shifts caused either by modifications in known traffic or the appearance of unknown traffic.\nThis setting resembles the Open Set Recognition one, but it additionally comprises shifts not implying the appearance of new classes.\nTherefore, we speak of Out-Of-Distribution detection in general terms. Confidence-based detectors use estimates derived from a model to quantify the level of certainty or trust in its predictions as an indicator of ID-ness.\nIn , the authors observed that well-trained models assign lower confidence scores to OOD data.\nSubsequent studies    have proposed techniques to enhance confidence estimation, while others have introduced modifications to the model architecture and training objectives  .\nAlthough confidence is not always a reliable OOD indicator  , due to their simplicity and clarity, confidence-based detectors are commonly used in practice and serve as a baseline for OOD detection. Density-based detectors explicitly model the distribution of ID data, either raw or latent features, and flag samples falling into low-density regions as OOD.\nIn multi-class tasks, class-conditional distribution estimators are often employed so that the OOD samples can be identified based on their likelihood [ref]22 [ref]23.\nTo model the class-conditional distribution of ID data, parametric and non-parametric models such as a simple Mixture of Gaussian, Kernel Density Estimation, and deep generative models  are frequently used.\nHowever, modeling the distribution of complex data and estimating the likelihood may be challenging [ref]23, imply a-priori assumptions that need validation, and do not always scale well like in kernel estimators.\nTherefore, we prefer to avoid these detectors and leave their evaluation to future work. Distance-based detectors are based on the idea that the OOD samples should be relatively far away from centroids or prototypes of ID classes.\nOnce a prototype is extracted for each training class, a distance metric like Mahalanobis, Euclidean, or Cosine can be used to estimate the class similarity and flag samples that are not similar enough to any of the prototypes [ref]22 .\nRecently, even a class-conditioned K-Nearest Neighbor approach  has been adopted to detect OOD samples based on the distance from the k-nearest neighbor.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: as the training data.\nHowever, this assumption is often violated and several ML fields try to address the issue of identifying unknown/anomalous/out-of-distribution data: Anomaly detection [ref]11 aims to detect anomalous inputs that deviate from normality, whether in features or labels.
