      "content": "Paper Title: Studying Fake News Spreading, Polarisation Dynamics, and Manipulation by Bots: a Tale of Networks and Language\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSocial media are also an excellent source of data that can be analysed to check hypotheses, and to validate proposed models. It is not surprising that they have been extensively used by scholars as a platform for empirical studies. Network analysis and computational linguistics provide a wide spectrum of practical tools that allow the researcher to find, on large scale networks, signals of homophily, sentiments and emotions, users’ stances and opinions, agreement and disagreement, and so on. The tendency of online users to only engage with some other users and select news that are in agreement with prior beliefs, while disregarding information that challenges them, is well documented.\nConservatives versus liberals  , pro-Euro versus anti-Euro , or pro-vax versus anti-vax , are a few examples of the many divisive topics that fuel heated debates on online social media. It happens on Facebook , Twitter , Youtube , Reddit and Gab [ref]52. It happens also on blogs , and even email recipients appear divided into two stances 8 about political topics. Some topics are divisive by nature and ultimately require each observer to take one of two possible sides. Politics is the main apple of discord : it is the case, for instance, of the polarisation in the American politics in which both voters   and candidates   are getting more and more polarised. In Bakshy et al.  authors determined the political alignment of 10 million Facebook users, and found that neighbours of liberal users are way more likely to be liberals than neutral or conservative, and the opposite holds for conservatives. Similar findings are displayed in Colleoni et al. , where authors report that Democrats more than Republicans are more likely to belong to an ideologically enclosed network, on average, but the highest homophily is due to highly partisan Republicans. The same findings are also supported by Boutyline et al. 8. Adamic et al.  shows that even conservative blogs are more likely to reference other conservative blogs, compared to liberal blogs. However, opposite communities have been found between science and conspiracies supporters 2 , or between users debating about climate policies . Polarisation is not only measured in terms of homophily of users’ neighbours, but also in terms of interaction with other users online. Barberà et al.  estimated the political leaning of 3.8 million Twitter users that produced over 150 million tweets, confirming that information about politics circulated mostly in closed loops between ideologically lenient users. Conover et al.  looked at 250,000 tweets before the 2010 U.S. Presidential campaign, confirming that the network of retweets shows high partisanship, as most of the retweets (intended as a form of endorsement) are in-group for both conservatives and liberals. In-group and out-group dynamics are predominant in Del Vicario et al. , Bessi et al. 2, Zollo et al.  and Bessi et al. , where pro-science users are opposed to pro-conspiracies users, and the two communities rarely overlap. Homophily and ideological segregation, however, only trigger partisanship on flammable content, like politics. Barberá et al.  measured polarisation over 12 diverse topics, and found that mainly political issues caused high partisanship of users, while other events did not (such as Super Bowl, Oscar 2014, Winter Olympics). Garimella et al.  collected 10 datasets of tweets, divided into political (i.e., online debates over political topics) and non-political. They also found that political topics are more divisive, while non-political did not trigger the same partisan response. Users’ individual and social biases play a relevant role in polarisation dynamics. For instance, Bessi 0 investigates personality traits of conspiracy followers and pro-science users. Boutyline et al. 8 instead establishes a link between a preference for certainty, stability and familiarity of conservative voters and political extremists, and higher levels of homophily and in-group sense of belonging. Such conformity to in-group ideas brings social advantages to the individual. In Garimella et al.  authors noted that bi-partisan users, i.e., users that bridge opposite echo chambers, show lower Pagerank centrality in the network, while also receiving less explicit appreciation (e.g., with likes), retweets and mentions than partisan users. Politicians on Twitter with an extremist, polarising stance have more followers than politicians with same activity and same presence on other media 5. On the contrary, out-group dynamics can be openly adversarial. Conover et al.  noted high homophily between in-group users in retweets, but also a big, mixed cluster with low homophily between in- and out-group mentions, that authors verified to be made of provocative interactions. Williams et al.  show similar findings on the two communities of skeptics and activists about climate change on Twitter. Lai et al.   confirmed that also during Brexit and the 2016 Italian constitutional referendums, retweets were mainly used as an endorsement, as opposed to mentions and “reply to” messages, that were adopted by users to engage a debate with someone with an opposite view. They also noticed that very active users tend to mild their own stances on Twitter after referendums results.\nIn Bail et al.  authors surveyed Democrats and Republicans users before, during and after a month of observation, during which they exposed users to a bot spamming content from the opposite party. Republicans that followed the liberal bot resulted to be substantially more radicalised than before. Munson et al. 2 suggested that educating users about how much they are exposed to a single-minded environment may lead to better results in correcting polarisation. Polarisation may be the long-term outcome of a process driven by inner and outer biases on each user’s online experience. The interplay between personal biases, social biases and algorithmic filters is addressed in Geschke et al. , where agents with limited attention are exposed to information coming from neighbours, personal searches, and algorithms. The effectiveness of algorithms in shielding users from discordant ideas is in fact disputed: along with empirical findings that confirm the existence of filter bubbles  accountable to algorithms 6, there is also evidence of the contrary, of a minor or non-existent role of algorithms in driving the polarisation process 3.\nNikolov et al. 8 measured the diversity of information consumed by approximately 100,000 users in mails, search logs and social media. They found that social media algorithms lead to a narrower variance of opinions the user could pick, compared to web searches. This view is shared also by Cinelli et al. [ref]52, where authors compared homophily on several social networks, claiming that substantial differences between Reddit’s and Facebook’s content consumption patterns are due to the news feed algorithm of the latter. Also Flaxman et al. [ref]90 found similar results: authors show that “articles found via social media or web search engines are indeed associated with higher ideological segregation than those an individual reads by directly visiting news sites”. However, they also highlight how users are more exposed to diverse ideologies through social media than through web engines, addressing to users’ biases the lack of variance in news read. The same consideration holds in Bakshy et al. , where conservative Facebook users’ news feed was estimated not far from a random sample of political ideas. In the authors’ words, “Within the population under study here [10.1 million users], individual choices more than algorithms limit exposure to attitude-challenging content in the context of Facebook”. Haim et al  reject the hypothesis that Google news feed may overindulge with one-sided news.\nAlthough the radicalisation of political views is not entirely to blame on the web  3, it is still reasonable to believe that online social media may play a role in this process, because they represent a platform for media outlets to reach visibility, and also for user generated content to potentially spread at an unprecedented rate. It is worth noting that also the existence or the impact of echo chambers on the spreading of misinformation is not universally accepted as facts. The aforementioned contributions from Barberá et al.  and Flaxman et al. [ref]90 claim that the echo-chambers phenomenon is overstated.\nA research from the Pew Research Center shows how “only 23% of U.S. users on Facebook and 17% on Twitter now say with confidence that most of their contacts’ views are similar to their own. 20% have changed their minds about a political or social issue because of interactions on social media” 5. Dubois et al.  shows the results of a survey conducted in the United Kingdom, and concludes that only a small fraction of people find themselves in an echo chamber. Guess et al.  is also critical of the echo chamber phenomenon, and the authors present an exhaustive list of arguments to support their claim. Last, we focused on polarisation mainly, but we have to point out that this binary lineup does not necessarily mean that there are only two surviving opinions on one issue. Individuals are entitled to doubts and soft opinions, they may acknowledge partial grounds to the opposite party, or even change their opinion when confronted with new evidence. For example, the Twitter’s debate on immigration in Italy shows that there is an “almost” silent majority of users with mild or less polarised opinions between others expressing radicalised views or following political leaders with a clear (sometimes extreme) stance on this topic (see Vilella et al. ). Fragmentation is likely more common in debates than polarisation, even if an empirical observation of such phenomena is in general more challenging due to the difficulties of assigning scores to multi-faceted opinions that have values in a continuum. However, studying fragmentation in real scenarios instead of polarisation could be one of the forthcoming problems to be addressed to better understand how misinformation spreads even in less radicalised debates.\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: anti-Euro , or pro-vax versus anti-vax , are a few examples of the many divisive topics that fuel heated debates on online social media.
