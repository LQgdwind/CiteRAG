      "content": "Paper Title: Symmetric Linear Arc Monadic Datalog and Gadget Reductions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor a τ𝜏\\tau-structure 𝔅𝔅{\\mathfrak{B}} and a class of τ𝜏\\tau-structures ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}\nthe pair (ℱ,𝔅)ℱ𝔅({\\mathcal{F}},{\\mathfrak{B}}) is called a duality pair if a finite structure 𝔄𝔄{\\mathfrak{A}} has a homomorphism to 𝔅𝔅{\\mathfrak{B}} if and only if no structure 𝔉∈ℱ𝔉ℱ{\\mathfrak{F}}\\in{\\mathcal{F}} has a homomorphism to 𝔅𝔅{\\mathfrak{B}}.\nSeveral forms of duality pairs will be relevant here, depending on the class of structures ℱℱ{\\mathcal{F}}. A τ𝜏\\tau-structure 𝔅𝔅{\\mathfrak{B}} has finite duality if there exists a finite set of τ𝜏\\tau-structures ℱℱ{\\mathcal{F}} such that (ℱ,𝔅)ℱ𝔅({\\mathcal{F}},{\\mathfrak{B}}) is a duality pair. The property of having finite duality is among the very few notions studied in the context of constraint satisfaction which is not preserved under gadget reductions, as illustrated in the following example. Let τ={E}𝜏𝐸\\tau=\\{E\\} be the signature that consists of a single binary relation symbol E𝐸E whose elements we call edges.\nLet 𝔓nsubscript𝔓𝑛{\\mathfrak{P}}_{n} be the structure with the domain {1,2,…,n}12…𝑛\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\} and edges {(1,2),(2,3),…,(n−1,n)}1223…𝑛1𝑛\\{(1,2),(2,3),\\dots,(n-1,n)\\}.\nLet ℨnsubscriptℨ𝑛{\\mathfrak{Z}}_{n} be the structure with the domain\n{1,2,…,2​n+3}12…2𝑛3\\{1,2,\\dots,2n+3\\} and edges Then 𝔓2subscript𝔓2{\\mathfrak{P}}_{2} has finite duality, witnessed by the duality pair ({𝔓3},𝔓2)subscript𝔓3subscript𝔓2(\\{{\\mathfrak{P}}_{3}\\},{\\mathfrak{P}}_{2}), 𝔓2subscript𝔓2{\\mathfrak{P}}_{2} pp-constructs 𝔓3subscript𝔓3{\\mathfrak{P}}_{3} , so CSP⁡(𝔓3)CSPsubscript𝔓3\\operatorname{CSP}({\\mathfrak{P}}_{3}) has a gadget reduction to CSP⁡(𝔓2)CSPsubscript𝔓2\\operatorname{CSP}({\\mathfrak{P}}_{2}),\nbut 𝔓3subscript𝔓3{\\mathfrak{P}}_{3} does not have finite duality: this is witnessed by the fact that is a duality pair , and that there is no homomorphism from ℨnsubscriptℨ𝑛{\\mathfrak{Z}}_{n} to ℨmsubscriptℨ𝑚{\\mathfrak{Z}}_{m} for n<m𝑛𝑚n<m. Let ρ={E,Z}𝜌𝐸𝑍\\rho=\\{E,Z\\} be the signature that consists of a binary relation symbol E𝐸E and a unary relation symbol Z𝑍Z. Let 𝔅2subscript𝔅2{\\mathfrak{B}}_{2} be the structure with domain {0,1}01\\{0,1\\} where Let 𝔓2′superscriptsubscript𝔓2′{\\mathfrak{P}}_{2}^{\\prime} be the ρ𝜌\\rho-expansion of 𝔓2subscript𝔓2{\\mathfrak{P}}_{2} where Z𝔓2′≔{0,1}≔superscript𝑍superscriptsubscript𝔓2′01Z^{{\\mathfrak{P}}_{2}^{\\prime}}\\coloneqq\\{0,1\\}.\nThen ({𝔓2′},𝔅2)superscriptsubscript𝔓2′subscript𝔅2(\\{{\\mathfrak{P}}_{2}^{\\prime}\\},{\\mathfrak{B}}_{2}) is a duality pair. A more robust form of duality is tree duality, which plays a central role in constraint satisfaction, and is studied in the graph homomorphism literature in the 90s. A structure 𝔅𝔅{\\mathfrak{B}} has tree duality\nif there exists a (not necessarily finite) set of trees ℱℱ{\\mathcal{F}} such that (ℱ,𝔅)ℱ𝔅({\\mathcal{F}},{\\mathfrak{B}}) is a duality pair.\nThe following is well known; see Theorem 7.4 in . The equivalence of 1. and 3. is from ; also see [ref]7. Let 𝔅𝔅{\\mathfrak{B}} be a finite τ𝜏\\tau-structure.\nThen the following are equivalent: 𝔅𝔅{\\mathfrak{B}} has tree duality; 𝔅𝔅{\\mathfrak{B}} has a pp-construction in\n({0,1};{0},{1},{0,1}3∖{(1,1,0)})0101superscript013110(\\{0,1\\};\\{0\\},\\{1\\},\\{0,1\\}^{3}\\setminus\\{(1,1,0)\\}); 𝔅𝔅{\\mathfrak{B}} can be solved by arc consistency. There are finite structures with tree duality that have a P-complete CSP, such as the structure\n({0,1};{0},{1},{0,1}3∖{(1,1,0)})0101superscript013110(\\{0,1\\};\\{0\\},\\{1\\},\\{0,1\\}^{3}\\setminus\\{(1,1,0)\\}), which is essentially the Boolean HornSAT problem. In the following, we therefore introduce more restrictive forms of dualities. A relational structure 𝔄𝔄{\\mathfrak{A}} is called a generalised caterpillar if it is a generalised tree, its incidence graph 𝔊𝔊{\\mathfrak{G}} contains a path P=(a1,…,an)𝑃subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛P=(a_{1},\\dots,a_{n}) such that every vertex in G∖{a1,…,an}𝐺subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛G\\setminus\\{a_{1},\\dots,a_{n}\\} of the form (t,R)𝑡𝑅(t,R) is connected (in 𝔊𝔊{\\mathfrak{G}}) to a vertex in P𝑃P. See Figure 1 (left) for an example.\nA relational structure 𝔄𝔄{\\mathfrak{A}} is called an (injective) caterpillar if it is injective and a generalised caterpillar\n(this definition of a caterpillar is equivalent to the one given in ).\nA structure 𝔅𝔅{\\mathfrak{B}} has caterpillar duality if there exists\na set of caterpillars ℱℱ{\\mathcal{F}} such that (ℱ,𝔅)ℱ𝔅({\\mathcal{F}},{\\mathfrak{B}}) is a duality pair.\nThe structures 𝔅𝔅{\\mathfrak{B}} with caterpillar duality have been characterised by  (Theorem 2.18) in terms of linear arc Datalog. To capture the power of symmetric linear arc Datalog, we present a more restrictive form of duality.\nLet 𝔗𝔗{\\mathfrak{T}} be an (injective) tree and\nlet a𝑎a and b𝑏b be distinct elements of 𝔗𝔗{\\mathfrak{T}}.\nWrite the canonical query of 𝔗𝔗{\\mathfrak{T}} as ϕa∧ϕa,b∧ϕbsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑎subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑎𝑏subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑏\\phi_{a}\\wedge\\phi_{a,b}\\wedge\\phi_{b} where\nϕasubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑎\\phi_{a} contains all conjuncts of the form\nR​(u¯)𝑅¯𝑢R(\\bar{u}) such that in the incidence graph,\nall paths from the vertex (u¯,R)¯𝑢𝑅(\\bar{u},R) to the vertex b𝑏b pass though a𝑎a. Similarly, we define ϕbsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑏\\phi_{b}, switching the roles of a𝑎a and b𝑏b.\nNote that ϕasubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑎\\phi_{a} and ϕbsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑏\\phi_{b} do not share any conjuncts.\nAll the remaining conjuncts of the canonical query form ψ𝜓\\psi.\nLet ϕ1subscriptitalic-ϕ1\\phi_{1} be obtained from ϕasubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑎\\phi_{a} (ϕbsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑏\\phi_{b}) by existentially quantifying all variables except for a𝑎a (b)b),\nand let ψ𝜓\\psi be obtained from ϕa,bsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑎𝑏\\phi_{a,b} by existentially quantifying all variables except for a𝑎a and b𝑏b.\nWe introduce the following concept; see Figure 2 for an example. Let 𝔗𝔗{\\mathfrak{T}} be an (injective) tree and let a𝑎a and b𝑏b be distinct elements of 𝔗𝔗{\\mathfrak{T}} that are not leaves.\nThe (a,b)𝑎𝑏(a,b)-unfolding of 𝔗𝔗{\\mathfrak{T}} is\nthe canonical database of the formula where ϕ1subscriptitalic-ϕ1\\phi_{1}, ϕ2subscriptitalic-ϕ2\\phi_{2}, and ψ𝜓\\psi are as defined above.\nA unfolding of 𝔗𝔗{\\mathfrak{T}} is a structure 𝔗′superscript𝔗′{\\mathfrak{T}}^{\\prime} that is obtained by a sequence 𝔗=𝔗1,𝔗2,…,𝔗n=𝔗′formulae-sequence𝔗subscript𝔗1subscript𝔗2…subscript𝔗𝑛superscript𝔗′{\\mathfrak{T}}={\\mathfrak{T}}_{1},{\\mathfrak{T}}_{2},\\dots,{\\mathfrak{T}}_{n}={\\mathfrak{T}}^{\\prime} such that\n𝔗isubscript𝔗𝑖{\\mathfrak{T}}_{i} is an (ai,bi)subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑏𝑖(a_{i},b_{i})-unfolding of 𝔗i−1subscript𝔗𝑖1{\\mathfrak{T}}_{i-1}, for all i∈{2,…,n}𝑖2…𝑛i\\in\\{2,\\dots,n\\}. Note that an unfolding of a tree 𝔗𝔗{\\mathfrak{T}} is again a tree and has a homomorphism to 𝔗𝔗{\\mathfrak{T}}.\nIt can also be shown that the unfolding of a caterpillar is a caterpillar as well (Lemma 3.9).\nWe say that a structure 𝔅𝔅{\\mathfrak{B}} has unfolded caterpillar duality if there exists a set ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} of caterpillars such that (ℱ,𝔅)ℱ𝔅({\\mathcal{F}},{\\mathfrak{B}}) is a duality pair, and\nℱℱ{\\mathcal{F}} contains every unfolding of a caterpillar in ℱℱ{\\mathcal{F}}.\nClearly, unfolded caterpillar duality implies caterpillar duality.\nUnfolded generalised caterpillar duality is defined analogously.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: set of trees ℱℱ{\\mathcal{F}} such that (ℱ,𝔅)ℱ𝔅({\\mathcal{F}},{\\mathfrak{B}}) is a duality pair.\nThe following is well known; see Theorem 7.4 in . The equivalence of 1. and 3. is from ; also see [ref]7. Let 𝔅𝔅{\\mathfrak{B}} be a finite τ𝜏\\tau-structure.\nThen the following are equivalent: 𝔅𝔅{\\mathfrak{B}} has tree duality; 𝔅𝔅{\\mathfrak{B}} has a pp-construction\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
