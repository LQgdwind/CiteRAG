      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Reason and Memorize with Self-Notes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImplicit Reasoning.\nbAbI  was a set of synthetic tasks for testing different reasoning capabilities  and showed the advantage of attention-based models over recurrent neural networks [ref]26 [ref]27.\nMore recently, attention-based transformers  have become the foundation of language-based reasoning .\nHowever, the feedforward nature of transformers makes it unsuitable for state-tracking 1 and several recurrent versions have been proposed  3 4.\nFurther, transformer-based large LMs are shown to struggle at multi-step reasoning [ref]7. Explicit Rationales.\nUse of rationales has been explored for interpretability , and for performing intermediate computations   . In particular, the Scratchpad method by Nye et al.  is closest to our proposed Self-Notes method which can be interpreted as an online-variant of Scratchpad. Use of rationales for reasoning and arithmetic tasks, referred to as “chain-of-thought”, has been shown to be particularly beneficial for zero- and few-shot in-context learning with large language models  2 [ref]7.\nZelikman et al.  showed the possibility of bootstrapping from a small set of reasoning labels to a larger unlabeled dataset.\nTrivedi et al. 3 propose interleaving chain-of-thought reasoning with knowledge retrieval steps (both after context).\nOther works have generated “inner monologue” tokens as a form of intermediate reasoning after a prompt 0 4.\nHowever, as with Scratchpad, the “chain-of-thought” and “inner monologue” reasoning is done after reading the entire input context rather than while reading it as in Self-Notes.\nThis emergent capability of chain-of-thought prompting is only possible in large (>> 6B) models . In concurrent work, Toolformer 5 introduces a method to finetune LMs to make API calls to external tools in the middle of the context. We propose a more general method to augment the context without API calls. Length Extrapolation.\nLength extrapolation, or generalization to longer instances during inference than those seen during training is an important property for an intelligent agent. In the context of transformer-based models, length extrapolation has been explored for language modeling 6, machine translation  7 8, models trained on artificial datasets 9 6, and a variety of other tasks.\nOne of the reasons for the limited length generalization capability of transformer models is due to the input position being represented with learnable embeddings 8 0. Adaptive Computation.\nWhen humans read and write text, we often spend a different amount of time per sentence. Transformers are designed to process and generate each sentence using the same amount of computation regardless of the complexity.\nSeveral works have addressed the problem of fixed computation time 1 2 3, but require modifying the training procedure or model architecture. Self-Notes can be viewed as a form of adaptive computation because the model decides when to deviate from the context and “think”.\nUnlike previous adaptive computation approaches, Self-Notes can easily be applied to existing LM architectures and training procedures. Editing of Generated Text.\nSeveral works have introduced variants of the transformer architecture to allow insertions, deletions, and revisions to the generated text 4 5 6 7 8. Contrary to these methods that revise post-context generations, Self-Notes revises the original prompt context by inserting tokens on the fly.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Implicit Reasoning.\nbAbI  was a set of synthetic tasks for testing different reasoning capabilities  and showed the advantage of attention-based models over recurrent neural networks [ref]26 [ref]27.\nMore recently, attention-based transformers  have become the foundation of language-based reasoning .\nHowever, the feedforward nature of transformers makes it unsuitable for\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
