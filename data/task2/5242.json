      "content": "Paper Title: Data structures for Approximate Discrete Fréchet distance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA big open question is whether we can store P𝑃P in a data structure, for efficient (approximate) Fréchet distance queries for any query Q𝑄Q. This topic received considerable attention throughout the\nyears   [ref]28    .\nA closely related field is nearest neighbor data structures under the Fréchet distance metric [ref]23   .\nRecently at SODA 2023, Gudmundsson, Seybold and Wong  answer this question negatively for arbitrary curves in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2}: showing that even with polynomial preprocessing space and time, we cannot preprocess a curve P𝑃P to decide the Fréchet distance between P𝑃P and a query curve Q𝑄Q in Ω​((n​m)1−δ)Ωsuperscript𝑛𝑚1𝛿\\Omega((nm)^{1-\\delta}) time for any δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0. Surprisingly, even in very restricted settings efficient results are difficult to obtain.\nDe Berg et al.  present an O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}) size\ndata structure that restricts the orientation of the query segment to be horizontal. Queries are supported in\nO​(log2⁡n)𝑂superscript2𝑛O(\\log^{2}n) time, and even subcurve queries are allowed (in that case, using\nO​(n2​log2⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛2superscript2𝑛O(n^{2}\\log^{2}n) space). Recently at ESA 2022, Buchin et al.  improve these result to using only O​(n​log2⁡n)𝑂𝑛superscript2𝑛O(n\\log^{2}n) space, where queries take O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) time.\nFor arbitrary query segments, they present an O​(n4+δ)𝑂superscript𝑛4𝛿O(n^{4+\\delta}) size data structure that supports (subcurve) queries to arbitrary segments in O​(log4⁡n)𝑂superscript4𝑛O(\\log^{4}n) time. Gudmundsson et al.  extend de Berg et al.’s  data structure. First to subcurve queries with arbitrary start and end points, then to queries where the horizontal query segment is translated in order to minimize its Fréchet distance. By applying parametric search, they obtain a O​(n2​log2⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛2superscript2𝑛O(n^{2}\\log^{2}n) size data structure that performs the generalized subcurve queries in O​(log8⁡n)𝑂superscript8𝑛O(\\log^{8}n) query time. With another application of parametric search, the data structure performs the translation-invariant Fréchet query in O​(log16⁡n)𝑂superscript16𝑛O(\\log^{16}n) query time. Driemel and Har-peled  create a data structure to store any curve in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} for constant d𝑑d.\nThey preprocess P𝑃P in O​(n​log3⁡n)𝑂𝑛superscript3𝑛O(n\\log^{3}n) time and O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) space. For any query (Q,ε,i,j)𝑄𝜀𝑖𝑗(Q,\\varepsilon,i,j) they can create a (3+ε)3𝜀(3+\\varepsilon)-approximation of Dℱ​(P​[i,j],Q)subscript𝐷ℱ𝑃𝑖𝑗𝑄{D_{\\mathcal{F}}}(P[i,j],Q) in O​(m2​log⁡n​log⁡(m​log⁡n))𝑂superscript𝑚2𝑛𝑚𝑛O(m^{2}\\log n\\log(m\\log n)) time. There exist some data structures for specifically the discrete Fréchet distance.\nDriemel, Psarros and Schmidt  fix ε𝜀\\varepsilon and an upper bound on m𝑚m beforehand (and assume m<<nmuch-less-than𝑚𝑛m<<n).\nThey store any curve P𝑃P in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} for constant d𝑑d using O​((m​log⁡1ε​ε−d)m)𝑂superscript𝑚1𝜀superscript𝜀𝑑𝑚O((m\\log\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\varepsilon^{-d})^{m}) space and preprocessing, to answer (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximate Fréchet distance queries in O​(m2+log⁡1ε)𝑂superscript𝑚21𝜀O(m^{2}+\\log\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}) time.\nFiltser  gives the corresponding data structure for the discrete Fréchet distance.\nRecently, at SODA 2022, Filtser and Filtser [ref]28 study the same setting: storing P𝑃P in O​((O​(1ε))d​m​log⁡1ε)𝑂superscript𝑂1𝜀𝑑𝑚1𝜀O(\\left(O(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})\\right)^{dm}\\log\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}) space, to answer (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximate Fréchet distance queries in O~​(m⋅d)~𝑂⋅𝑚𝑑\\tilde{O}(m\\cdot d) time.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: question is whether we can store P𝑃P in a data structure, for efficient (approximate) Fréchet distance queries for any query Q𝑄Q.
