      "content": "Paper Title: From {Solution} Synthesis to {Student Attempt} Synthesis for Block-Based Visual Programming TasksThis article is a longer version of the paper from the EDM 2022 conference. Authors are listed alphabetically.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe emergence of block-based visual programming platforms has made coding more accessible and appealing to beginners. Block-based programming uses “code blocks” that reduce the burden of syntax and introduces concepts in an interactive way. Led by initiatives like Hour of Code by Code.org   and the popularity of languages like Scratch , block-based programming has become integral to introductory CS education. Considering the Hour of Code initiative alone, over one billion hours of programming activity has been spent in learning to solve tasks in such environments . Programming tasks on these platforms are conceptual and open-ended, and require multi-step deductive reasoning to solve. Given these aspects, novices often struggle when learning to solve these tasks. The difficulties faced by novice students become evident by looking at the trajectory of students’ attempts who are struggling to solve a given task. For instance, in a dataset released by Code.org   , even for simple tasks where solutions require only 555 code blocks (see Figure 2(a)), students submitted over 50,0005000050,000 unique attempts with some exceeding a size of 505050 code blocks. AI-driven programming tutors have the potential to support these struggling students by providing personalized assistance, e.g., feedback as hints or curriculum design . To effectively assist struggling students, AI-driven systems need several components, a crucial one being student modeling. In particular, we need models that can automatically infer a student’s knowledge from limited interactions and then predict the student’s behavior on new tasks. However, student modeling in block-based visual programming environments can be quite challenging because of the following: (i) programming tasks are conceptual, and there is no well-defined skill-set or problem-solving strategy for mastery ; (ii) there could be a huge variability in behaviors and a long-tail distribution of students’ attempts for a task ; (iii) the objective of predicting a student’s behavior on new tasks is not limited to coarse-grained success/failure indicators (e.g., )—ideally, we should be able to do fine-grained synthesis of attempts for a given student. Beyond the above-mentioned challenges, there are two critical issues arising from limited resources and data scarcity for a given domain. First, while the space of tasks that could be designed for personalized curriculum is intractably large , the publicly available datasets of real-world students’ attempts are limited; e.g., for the Hour of Code: Maze Challenge domain, we have datasets for only two tasks . Second, when a deployed system is interacting with a new student, there is limited prior information 5, and the system would have to infer the student’s knowledge by observing behavior on a few reference tasks, e.g., through a quiz [ref]21. These two issues, in turn, limit the applicability of state-of-the-art techniques that rely on large-scale datasets across tasks or personalized data per student (e.g.,  [ref]28  )—we need next-generation student modeling techniques for block-based visual programming that can operate under data scarcity and limited observability. To this end, this paper focuses on the following question: For a given student, can we synthesize the student’s attempt on a new target task after observing the student’s attempt on a fixed reference task?\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: interacting with a new student, there is limited prior information 5, and the system would have to infer the student’s knowledge by observing behavior on a few reference tasks, e.g., through a quiz [ref]21.
