      "content": "Paper Title: Can Shape-Infused Joint Embeddings Improve Image-Conditioned 3D Diffusion?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent years have witnessed remarkable advancements in deep generative models, especially in image generation. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) played a central role in this progress, outperforming previous methods such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) not only in unconditional image synthesis [ref]1, but also in text-to-image synthesis. Works such as GLIDE [ref]2, DALLE-2 [ref]3, Stable Diffusion , and Imagen  showed, indeed, how we can effectively condition the generation of images by text prompts. Behind the effectiveness of many conditioned DDPMs is the guidance provided by joint embedding models, such as CLIP  in the case of DALLE-2 [ref]3. The strength of these models lies in mapping multimodal concepts in the same well-structured embedding space, thus effectively aligning the modalities together.\nThis mechanism aids diffusion models in generating content in one modality that is highly coherent with a guiding source in any other modality. In the case of DALLE-2 with CLIP, guidance is provided through textual prompts. The undeniable success of diffusion on 2D images led research to focus also on other modalities.\nIn particular, interest has sparked in the generation of 3D shapes guided by 2D images. Image-to-shape generation is beneficial to fields such as VR and AR, cultural heritage , medical imaging and diagnosis , and industrial design and manufacturing . Inspired by text-to-image generation, LION  showed that it is possible to use the CLIP embedding of a 2D image to condition a diffusion model in the generation of a similar 3D shape, achieving state-of-the-art performance in quality and diversity.\nYet, this result also begs the question of whether aligning text to 2D information\nis all that is needed to produce image-guided shapes. In fact, during training, CLIP is only provided with two-dimensional visual features and does not have access to any structural information about the shapes behind the images it observes. Besides, obstruction and visual ambiguities in 2D images are very common, and injecting only 2D information in the guiding process might lead to diverse shapes collapsing into similar embeddings. Motivated by this question, with this work we set out to assess the impact of adding 3D information in the guiding process. We propose a joint-embedding model, named CISP (Contrastive Image-Shape Pre-training), analogous to CLIP but designed to align 2D images and 3D shapes in a joint embedding space. As CISP is trained using a contrastive loss, we expect the structure itself of the embedding space to reflect 3D characteristics that might be invisible or cluttered in the mere 2D representations of the same objects.\nWe assess the influence of CISP embeddings compared to text-image CLIP embeddings when employed as guidance for a shape diffusion model. To achieve this goal, we establish a generation pipeline for image-guided 3D diffusion that allows conditioning on either CISP and CLIP embeddings. We quantitatively compare their generation performance in terms of generation quality and diversity, as well as the coherence of the resulting shapes to the query image. We further compare the properties and structure of the two embedding spaces through interpolations. Finally, we assess the OOD capabilities of both models and perform ablation on the proposed architecture. This study contributes to the ongoing dialogue on generative models,\npaving the way for innovative three-dimensional visual content synthesis.\nAs our small-scale experiments show promising results, we argue that investing in training a large-scale multimodal system including 3D representations would be highly beneficial to advance the generation capabilities of current models to the 3D world. In summary, the key contributions of this work are: We present CISP, a model exploiting contrastive pre-training to learn joint image-shape embeddings. We show that a CISP-conditioned diffusion model generates shapes with higher coherence to the guiding images than a CLIP-conditioned model, while maintaining similar generation quality and diversity. This phenomenon occurs despite the large-scale nature of CLIP compared to CISP. We investigate the impact of shape-aware embeddings by studying the regularity of the CISP embedding space with manifold interpolations and out-of-distribution sampling.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: played a central role in this progress, outperforming previous methods such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) not only in unconditional image synthesis [ref]1, but also in text-to-image synthesis.
