      "content": "Paper Title: On the Complexity of CSP-based Ideal Membership Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe study of polynomial ideals and algorithmic problems related to them goes back to David Hilbert . In spite of such a heritage, methods developed in this area till these days keep finding a wide range of applications in mathematics and computer science. In this paper we consider the Ideal Membership Problem (IMP for short), in which the goal is to decide whether a given polynomial belongs to a given ideal. It underlies such proof systems as Nullstellensatz and Polynomial Calculus. To introduce the problem more formally, let 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} be a field and 𝔽​[x1,x2,…,xn]𝔽subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2…subscript𝑥𝑛\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{n}] denote the ring of polynomials over 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} with indeterminates x1,…,xnsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}. In this paper 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} is always the field of real or complex numbers. A set of polynomials I⊆𝔽​[x1,x2,…,xn]I𝔽subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2…subscript𝑥𝑛\\emph{{I}}\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{n}] is said to be an ideal if it is closed under addition and multiplications by elements from 𝔽​[x1,x2,…,xn]𝔽subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2…subscript𝑥𝑛\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{n}]. By the Hilbert Basis Theorem every ideal I has a finite generating set , that is, there exists P={f1,f2,…,fr}⊆𝔽​[x1,x2,…,xn]𝑃subscript𝑓1subscript𝑓2…subscript𝑓𝑟𝔽subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2…subscript𝑥𝑛P=\\{f_{1},f_{2},\\dots,f_{r}\\}\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{n}] such that for every f0∈𝔽​[x1,x2,…,xn]subscript𝑓0𝔽subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2…subscript𝑥𝑛f_{0}\\in\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{n}] the polynomial f0subscript𝑓0f_{0} belongs to I if and only if there exists a proof, that is, polynomials h1,…,hrsubscriptℎ1…subscriptℎ𝑟h_{1},\\dots,h_{r} such that the identity f0=h1​f1+⋯+hr​frsubscript𝑓0subscriptℎ1subscript𝑓1⋯subscriptℎ𝑟subscript𝑓𝑟f_{0}=h_{1}f_{1}+\\dots+h_{r}f_{r} holds. Such proofs will also be referred to as ideal membership proofs. We then write I=⟨P⟩Idelimited-⟨⟩𝑃\\emph{{I}}=\\langle P\\rangle. The Hilbert Basis Theorem allows one to state the IMP as follows: given polynomials f0,f1,…,frsubscript𝑓0subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑟f_{0},f_{1},\\dots,f_{r} decide whether there exists a proof that f0∈⟨f1,…,fr⟩subscript𝑓0subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑟f_{0}\\in\\langle f_{1},\\dots,f_{r}\\rangle. In many cases combinatorial or optimization problems can be encoded as collections of polynomials, and the problem is then reduced to proving or refuting that some polynomial vanishes at specified points or is nonnegative at those points. Polynomial proof systems can then be applied to find a proof or a refutation of these facts. Polynomial Calculus and Nullstellensatz proof systems are some of the standard techniques to check for zeroes of a polynomial, and Sum-of-Squares (SOS) allows to prove or refute the nonnegativity of a polynomial. We may be interested in the length or degree of a proof in one of those systems. Sometimes such proofs can also be efficiently found — such proof systems are referred to as automatizable — and in those cases we are also concerned with the complexity of finding a proof. The general IMP is a difficult problem and it is not even obvious whether or not it is decidable. The decidability was established in   . Then Mayr and Meyer  were the first to study the complexity of the IMP. They proved an exponential space lower bound for the membership problem for ideals generated by polynomials with integer and rational coefficients. Mayer  went on establishing an exponential space upper bound for the IMP for ideals over ℚℚ\\mathbb{Q}, thus proving that such IMPs are EXPSPACE-complete. The source of hardness here is that a proof that f0∈⟨P⟩subscript𝑓0delimited-⟨⟩𝑃f_{0}\\in\\langle P\\rangle may require polynomials of exponential degree. In the cases when the degree of a proof has a linear bound in the degree of f0subscript𝑓0f_{0}, the IMP can be solved efficiently. (There is also the issue of exponentially long coefficients that we will mention later.) By Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz polynomial ideals can often be characterized by the set of common zeroes of all the polynomials in the ideal. Such sets are known as affine varieties and provide a link between ideals and combinatorial problems, where an affine variety corresponds to the set of feasible solutions of a problem. Combinatorial problems give rise to a fairly narrow class of ideals known as combinatorial ideals. The corresponding varieties are finite, and therefore the ideals itself are zero-dimensional and radical. The former implies that the IMP can be decided in single-exponential time , while the latter will be important later for IMP algorithms. Indeed, if the IMP is restricted to radical ideals, it is equivalent to (negation of) the question: given f0,f1,…,frsubscript𝑓0subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑟f_{0},f_{1},\\dots,f_{r} does there exists a zero of f1,…,frsubscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑟f_{1},\\dots,f_{r} that is not a zero of f0subscript𝑓0f_{0}. The special case of the IMP with f0=1subscript𝑓01f_{0}=1 has been studied for combinatorial problems in the context of lower bounds on Polynomial Calculus and Nullstellensatz proofs, see e.g.   . A broader approach of using polynomials to represent finite-domain constraints has been explored in  . Clegg et al., , discuss a propositional proof system based on a bounded degree version of Buchberger’s algorithm [ref]9 for finding proofs of unsatisfiability. Jefferson et al.,  use a modified form of Buchberger’s algorithm that can be used to achieve the same benefits as the local-consistency algorithms which are widely used in constraint processing. Whenever the degree of a proof h1,…,hrsubscriptℎ1…subscriptℎ𝑟h_{1},\\dots,h_{r} is bounded, that is, the degree of each hisubscriptℎ𝑖h_{i} is bounded by a constant, there is an LP or SDP program of polynomial size whose solutions are the coefficients of the proof. If in addition the solution of the LP or SDP program can be represented by a polynomial number of bits (thus having low bit complexity), a proof can be efficiently found. This property also applies to SOS and provides one of the most powerful algorithmic methods for optimization problems. It was recently observed by O’Donnell  that low degree of proofs does not necessarily implies its low bit complexity. More precisely, he presented a collection of polynomials and a polynomial such that there are low degree proofs of nonnegativity for these polynomials, that is, there also exists a polynomial size SDP whose solutions represent a SOS proof of that. However, the size of those solutions are always exponential (or the proof has high bit complexity), and therefore the Ellipsoid method will take exponential time to find them. It therefore is possible that every low degree SOS proof has high bit complexity. Raghavendra and Weitz 5 also demonstrated an example showing that this is the case even if all the constraints in the instance are Boolean, that is, on a 2-element set. The examples of O’Donnell and Raghavendra-Weitz indicate that it is important to identify conditions under which low degree proofs (Nullstellensatz, Polynomial Calculus, or SOS) exist and also have low bit complexity. Raghavendra and Weitz 5 suggested some sufficient conditions of this kind for SOS proofs that are satisfied for a number of well studied problems such as Matching, TSP, and others. More precisely, they formulate three conditions that a polynomial system ought to satisfy to yield for a low bit complexity SOS proof. Two of these conditions hold for the majority of combinatorial ideals, while the third, the low degree of Nullstellensatz, is the only nontrivial one. Noting that Nullstellensatz proofs are basically witnesses of ideal membership, the IMP is at the core of all the three proof systems. The Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) provides a general framework for a wide range of combinatorial problems. In a CSP we are given a set of variables and a collection of constraints, and we have to decide whether the variables can be assigned values so that all the constraints are satisfied. Following    every CSP can be associated with a polynomial ideal. Let CSP 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} be given on variables x1,…,xnsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛x_{1},\\dots,x_{n} that can take values from a set D={0,…,t−1}𝐷0…𝑡1D=\\{0,\\dots,t-1\\}. The ideal I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}) of 𝔽​[x1,…,xn]𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}] whose corresponding variety equals the set of solutions of 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} is constructed as follows. First, for every xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} the ideal I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}) contains a domain polynomial fD​(xi)subscript𝑓𝐷subscript𝑥𝑖f_{D}(x_{i}) whose zeroes are precisely the elements of D𝐷D. Then for every constraint R​(xi1,…,xik)𝑅subscript𝑥subscript𝑖1…subscript𝑥subscript𝑖𝑘R(x_{i_{1}},\\dots,x_{i_{k}}), where R𝑅R is a predicate on D𝐷D, the ideal I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}) contains a polynomial fR​(xi1,…,xik)subscript𝑓𝑅subscript𝑥subscript𝑖1…subscript𝑥subscript𝑖𝑘f_{R}(x_{i_{1}},\\dots,x_{i_{k}}) that interpolates R𝑅R, that is, for (xi1,…,xik)∈Dksubscript𝑥subscript𝑖1…subscript𝑥subscript𝑖𝑘superscript𝐷𝑘(x_{i_{1}},\\dots,x_{i_{k}})\\in D^{k} it holds fR​(xi1,…,xik)=0subscript𝑓𝑅subscript𝑥subscript𝑖1…subscript𝑥subscript𝑖𝑘0f_{R}(x_{i_{1}},\\dots,x_{i_{k}})=0 if and only if R​(xi1,…,xik)𝑅subscript𝑥subscript𝑖1…subscript𝑥subscript𝑖𝑘R(x_{i_{1}},\\dots,x_{i_{k}}) is true. This model generalizes a number of constructions used in the literature to apply Nullstellensatz or SOS  proof systems to combinatorial problems, see, e.g.,    5. The construction above also provides useful connections between the IMP and the CSP. For instance, the CSP 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} is unsatisfiable if and only if the variety associated with I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}) is empty, or equivalently, if and only if 1∈I​(𝒫)1I𝒫1\\in\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}) (1 here denotes the polynomial of degree 0). In this sense it is related to the standard decision version of the CSP. However, since I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}) is radical for any instance 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}, the IMP reduces to verifying whether every point in the variety of I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}) is a zero of f0subscript𝑓0f_{0}. Thus, it is probably closer to the CSP Containment problem (given two CSP instances over the same variables, decide if every solution of the first one is also a solution of the second one), which has mainly been studied in the context of Database theory and Conjunctive Query Containment, see, e.g., . Studying CSPs in which the type of constraints is restricted has been a very fruitful research direction. For a fixed set of relations ΓΓ\\Gamma over a finite set D𝐷D, also called a constraint language, CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) denotes the CSP restricted to instances with constraints from ΓΓ\\Gamma, 9 . Feder and Vardi in  conjectured that every CSP of the form CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) is either solvable in polynomial time or is NP-complete. This conjecture was recently confirmed by Bulatov and Zhuk in  . Mastrolilli in  initiated a similar study of the IMP. Let IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) be the IMP restricted to ideals produced by instances from CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma). As was observed above, the complement of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) reduces to IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma), and so IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) is coNP-complete whenever CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) is NP-hard. Therefore the question posed in  is: For which constraint languages ΓΓ\\Gamma is it possible to efficiently find a generating set for the ideal I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}), 𝒫∈CSP​(Γ)𝒫CSPΓ\\mathcal{P}\\in\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma), that allows for a low bit complexity proof of ideal membership? Mastrolilli  (along with ) resolved this question in the case when ΓΓ\\Gamma is Boolean language, that is, over the set {0,1}01\\{0,1\\}. He proved that in this case IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) is polynomial time solvable, and moreover ideal membership proofs can be efficiently found, too, for any Boolean ΓΓ\\Gamma for which CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) is polynomial time solvable. However, IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) in  satisfies two restrictions. First, the result is obtained under the assumption that ΓΓ\\Gamma contains the constant relations that allows one to fix a value of a variable. Mastrolilli called such languages idempotent. We will show that this suffices to obtain a more general result. Second, in the majority of cases a bound on the degree of the input polynomial f0subscript𝑓0f_{0} has to be introduced. The IMP where the input polynomial has degree at most d𝑑d will be denoted by IMPd,IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d},\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma). The exact result is that for any idempotent Boolean language ΓΓ\\Gamma the problem IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) is polynomial time solvable for any d𝑑d when CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) is polynomial time solvable, and an ideal membership proof can be efficiently found, and IMP0​(Γ)subscriptIMP0Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{0}(\\Gamma) is coNP-complete otherwise. We will reflect on the distinction between IMP and IMPdsubscriptIMP𝑑\\textsc{IMP}_{d} later in the paper, but do not go deeply into that. The case when CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) is equivalent to solving systems of linear equations modulo 2 was also considered in  fixing a gap in . There has been very little work done on IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) beyond 2-element domains. The only result we are aware of is [ref]7 that proves that IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) is polynomial time when ΓΓ\\Gamma is on a 3-element domain and is invariant under the so-called dual-discriminator operation, which imposes very strong restrictions on the relations from ΓΓ\\Gamma; we will discuss this case in greater details in Section 5.2. The main tool for proving the tractability of IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) is constructing a Gröbner Basis of the corresponding ideal. It is not hard to see that the degree of polynomials in a Gröbner Basis of an ideal of 𝔽​[x1,…,xn]𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}] that can occur in IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) is only bounded by n​|D|𝑛𝐷n|D|, where ΓΓ\\Gamma is over a set D𝐷D. Therefore the basis and polynomials themselves can be exponentially large in general. In fact, this is the main reason why considering IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) instead makes the problem easier. For solving this problem it suffices to find a d𝑑d-truncated Gröbner Basis, in which the degree of polynomials is bounded by d𝑑d, and so such a basis always has polynomial size. Thus, the (possible) hardness of IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) is due to the hardness of constructing a Gröbner Basis.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: of using polynomials to represent finite-domain constraints has been explored in  .
