      "content": "Paper Title: Enhancing a Neurocognitive Shared Visuomotor Model for Object Identification, Localization, and Grasping With Learning From Auxiliary Tasks The authors gratefully acknowledge partial support from the German Research Foundation DFG under project CML (TRR 169).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe shared visuomotor model enables the simultaneous learning of object classification and localization, as well as motor control. The network is designed to receive sensory input in the form of an image displaying a table with one or more objects, viewed from the robot’s perspective, as well as a neurally encoded description of the grasping target. Our model has three output layers:\n1) It generates robotic arm joint angles for performing a reach-for-grasp action as a primary task; 2) It generates bounding boxes for the auxiliary task of localizing objects in the image; 3) As a second auxiliary task, it classifies the localized objects. The two auxiliary tasks of object localization and classification can be jointly evaluated as an object detection task to analyze the model’s ability for visual (but not motor) processing. The network can be trained on the primary visuomotor task only or in combination with any number of auxiliary tasks. We extend the model developed by Kerzel et al.  by introducing two auxiliary tasks and redesigning the object encoding mechanism, as shown in Fig. 2. The model is based on the Retinanet [ref]29, built upon a Keras-based555https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet implementation of the Retinanet using a Resnet  with 50 layers as a backbone. The Retinanet extends the backbone with lateral connections to the FPN. The FPN infiltrates the backbone at three stages, with two additional convolutional layers as described in [ref]29, resulting in a total of five pyramidal layers. Each pyramidal layer has 256 output channels. The Resnet mimics the early hierarchical processing of visual input in the human brain  while the feature pyramids contain pattern and shape information with regard to regions in the input image. This shared visual processing is then used for the primary visuomotor and the auxiliary object classification and localization tasks by different subnetworks. The input comprises a 990 × 540 pixel RGB image and a neural encoding, describing the target object in natural language sentences, e.g., “the purple pyramid on top of the blue and green stack of blocks”. The neural encoding for a given sentence is generated by a Transformer Encoder [ref]41.\nThe transition to a three-dimensional world necessitates the use of more complex object descriptions that contain not only visual features but also descriptions of object positions since blocks of the same shape and color can appear in multiple locations. For the remainder of the text, the Transformer Encoder can be assumed to create a unique neural representation of the target object, analogous to the one-hot encoding used by Kerzel et al. . Due to the increased complexity of object description in terms of location and shape in a three-dimensional world (e.g., “yellow brick on top of pink brick” as shown in Fig. 2), a simple one-hot encoding would not suffice; hence, the employment of the Transformer Encoder. The Transformer utilizes dot-product attention to prioritize words that contribute most to the end-goal. More specifically, the Transformer Encoder learns a language model for encoding natural language sentences, which makes it suitable for our task: describing the object to be grasped and allowing the neural model to attend to relevant words that fulfill our desired objective. The output encoding is presented in the form of a dense representation. Three parallel subnetworks branch from the Feature Pyramids, two of which are part of the original Retinanet setup that will be used for training the auxiliary tasks, and one for enabling the primary visuomotor task. The classification subnetwork which predicts the probabilities of objects existing at each position and the regression subnetwork for estimating the limits of the bounding boxes. Following the Retinanet implementation [ref]29, actually, multiple classification and regression subnetworks branch off different layers of the FPN; this is simplified to enhance clarity. The visuomotor subnetwork, in which the information from the pyramidal network is combined with the encoded object description to produce joint angles.\nThe model’s model is shown in Fig. 2. Parameters are not shared across the subnetworks, which are designed as follows: The classification subnetwork is constructed using four 3 × 3 convolutional layers with 256 channels for each FPN layer, and parameters shared across all the FPN layers. Each convolutional layer uses a ReLU activation, with a sigmoid activation for the final layer. The outputs are of size K × A, where K represents the number of object classes to be detected, and A represents the number of anchors. Anchors are windows of predefined shape and size that slide over the input image according to a stride parameter. As the predetermined size of the anchor can be an issue in detecting arbitrary objects, both the number and shape of the anchors were empirically optimized for our approach. We use nine anchors for all experiments. The final layer results in an output indicating whether a class belongs to an anchor or not, along with the class index. Focal loss is the cost function used for this subnetwork. The regression subnetwork is constructed using four 3 × 3 convolutional layers with 256 channels for each FPN layer, and parameters shared across all the FPN layers. Each convolutional layer is followed by a ReLU activation, with a sigmoid activation for the final layer. The network outputs the location (x, y) and size (height, width) of each anchor. The four linear outputs per anchor are regressed to the nearest ground-truth box. The smooth L1 loss is the cost function used for this subnetwork. The visuomotor subnetwork combines the semantic encoding of the targeted object with the visual features from the Feature Pyramids that represent the scene. Extending our previous work, we introduce an intermediate, multi-dimensional structure between the visuomotor subnetwork and the low-level visual processing module. We refer to this structure as a node, with multiple nodes indicating the dimensionality. The intermediate structure connecting the visuomotor subnetwork with the Retinanet is similar to the regression subnetwork. We set the number of nodes to four, resembling the output of the Retinanet’s bounding box regression subnetwork. We introduce the nodes to reshape the output branching from each module and integrate seamlessly with their pre-existing design. Similarly, we introduce semantic encoding nodes feeding from the goal and intention encoding module. These nodes are composed of a dense layer with a length of 200 units. We set the number of nodes to four for maintaining consistency with the visual processing nodes. The visuomotor subnetwork flattens and concatenates the visual processing and semantic encoding nodes. The concatenated layer is followed by two dense layers with 900 units each. The two dense layers use a sigmoid activation function, followed by the final output layer, with six units representing the six-degrees-of-freedom of the robotic arm. The six units produce the joint configuration used for actuating the arm and grasping the target object. The layers following the concatenation learn the shared features between the two modules and are based on the post-convolutional layer structure described in . The Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss is used as this subnetwork’s cost function.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: tasks.
