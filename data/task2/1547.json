      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Pixel Aggregations for Image and Video Denoising\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate the proposed algorithm against the state-of-the-art image and video denoising methods¬†[ref]9     on the synthetic dataset at different noise levels.\nWe conduct exhaustive hyper-parameter finetuning for the NLM¬†, BM3D¬† and VBM4D¬† methods including both blind and non-blind models, and choose the best results.\nFor fair comparisons, we train the KPN¬†[ref]9 and DnCNN¬† methods on our datasets with the same settings.\nWhile the KPN [ref]9 scheme is originally designed for multi-frame input, we\nadapt it to single image for more comprehensive evaluation by changing the network input. As shown in Table¬†II and¬†III, the proposed algorithm achieves consistently better results on both single image and video denoising in terms of both PSNR and structural similarity (SSIM) in all the subsets with different noise levels.\nEven our blind version model achieves competitive results whereas other methods rely on the oracle noise parameters to perform well.\nNote that the KPN¬†[ref]9 learns convolution kernels for image and video denoising, where the irrelevant input pixels can negatively affect the filtering process and lead to inferior denoising results.\nTable¬†III also shows the results by applying the PAN model on each frame separately and then fusing the outputs with weighted sum for video denoising (denoted as PAN-sep).\nThe proposed ST-PAN model can generate better results than PAN-sep owing to its capability of handling large motion. Figure ¬†5 shows several image and video denoising results from the synthetic dataset.\nConventional methods¬†   with hand-crafted sampling and weighting strategies do not perform well and generate severe artifacts.\nIn particular,\nthe VBM4D¬† method selects pixels using L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} norm to measure patch similarities, which tends to generate oversmoothing results, as shown in Figure¬†5(j).\nOn the other hand, directly synthesizing the results with deep CNNs¬† can lead to denoised results with corrupted structures and fewer details (Figure¬†5(e)).\nFurthermore, the KPN¬†[ref]9 learns rigid kernels for video denoising, which do not deal with misalignments larger than 222 pixels due to the limitation of rigid sampling.\nWhen the misalignment is beyond this limit, the KPN model is likely to generate oversmoothed results (Figure¬†5(k)) or ghosting artifacts around high-contrast boundaries, as shown in Figure¬†6.\nIn contrast, the proposed method learns the pixel aggregation process in a data-driven manner and achieves clearer results with fewer artifacts (Figure¬†5(f), (l) and Figure¬†6(g)).\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: We evaluate the proposed algorithm against the state-of-the-art image and video denoising methods¬†[ref]9     on the synthetic dataset at different noise levels.\nWe conduct exhaustive hyper-parameter finetuning for the NLM¬†, BM3D¬† and VBM4D¬† methods including both blind and non-blind models, and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
