Technically speaking, it requires the condition to be a simple NNF formula\nwhose literals all appear in the instance being explained. This leads to the notion of complete\nreason introduced in .222Ref.  gave a different but equivalent definition\nand for binary variables. See  for a more general treatment. Suppose instance ℐℐ{\\cal I} belongs to class cisubscript𝑐𝑖c_{i}.\nThe complete reason for the decision on instance ℐℐ{\\cal I} is\nthe weakest NNF ΓΓ\\Gamma whose literals are in ℐℐ{\\cal I}\nand that satisfies ℐ⊧Γ⊧ΔimodelsℐΓmodelssubscriptΔ𝑖{\\cal I}\\models\\Gamma\\models\\Delta_{i}. We stress here that the complete reason is a simple NNF formula, that is, every literal it contains\ncorresponds to a state. Consider a classifier with\nthree ternary features X,Y,Z𝑋𝑌𝑍X,Y,Z. Instance ℐ=x2⋅y2⋅z1ℐ⋅subscript𝑥2subscript𝑦2subscript𝑧1{\\cal I}=x_{2}\\cdot y_{2}\\cdot z_{1} is\ndecided as belonging to class c2subscript𝑐2c_{2} which has formula Δ2=x23⋅(x2+y23)⋅(y23+z1)subscriptΔ2⋅subscript𝑥23subscript𝑥2subscript𝑦23subscript𝑦23subscript𝑧1\\Delta_{2}=x_{23}\\cdot(x_{2}+y_{23})\\cdot(y_{23}+z_{1}).\nThe complete reason for this decision is x2⋅(y2+z1)⋅subscript𝑥2subscript𝑦2subscript𝑧1x_{2}\\cdot(y_{2}+z_{1}). It says that instance ℐℐ{\\cal I}\nbelongs to class c1subscript𝑐1c_{1} because it has characteristic x2subscript𝑥2x_{2} and one of the two characteristics y2,z1subscript𝑦2subscript𝑧1y_{2},z_{1}.\nThis is indeed the most general condition on the instance which implies the class formula and that\nis constructed by applying conjunctions and disjunctions to the instance characteristics x2subscript𝑥2x_{2}, y2subscript𝑦2y_{2} and z1subscript𝑧1z_{1}. Two questions become relevant now. First, how do we compute the complete reason? Second, how can we use\ncomplete reasons when they are too complex to be interpretable by humans? We will address the first question next\nwhile leaving the second question until later in the tutorial. Ref.  showed that if the class formula is appropriately represented (e.g., as an OBDD [ref]6),\nthe complete reason can be computed in linear time. A major development then came in  which\nintroduced the following quantification operator and showed that it can be used to express the complete reason. For variable X𝑋X with states x1,…,xnsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n},\nthe universal literal quantification of state xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} from formula ΔΔ\\Delta is defined\nas ∀xi⋅Δ=Δ|xi⋅∏j≠i(xi+Δ|xj)\\forall x_{i}\\cdot\\Delta=\\Delta|x_{i}\\cdot\\prod_{j\\not=i}(x_{i}+\\Delta|x_{j}). This operator is commutative so it is meaningful to quantify an instance ℐℐ{\\cal I} from its\nclass formula Δi,subscriptΔ𝑖\\Delta_{i}, written ∀ℐ⋅Δifor-all⋅ℐsubscriptΔ𝑖\\forall{\\cal I}\\cdot\\Delta_{i}, by quantifying the states of ℐℐ{\\cal I} in any order.\nMoreover, ∀ℐ⋅Δifor-all⋅ℐsubscriptΔ𝑖\\forall{\\cal I}\\cdot\\Delta_{i} corresponds to the complete reason as shown in  for Boolean variables\nand in  for discrete variables. One significance of this result is that\nthis quantification operator is well behaved computationally on a number of logical forms. For example,\none can quantify any set of states from a CNF in linear time.\nMore generally, the operator distributes over conjunctions, and distributes over disjunctions when the\ndisjuncts do not share variables as also shown in  (see weaker conditions in ).\nThis brought into focus the following form of class formulas as it allows one to compute complete reasons in linear time (and general reasons too\nthat are discussed in Section III-B). An NNF is or-decomposable iff vars​(α)∩vars​(β)=∅vars𝛼vars𝛽\\texttt{vars}(\\alpha)\\cap\\texttt{vars}(\\beta)=\\emptyset for any disjuncts α𝛼\\alpha and β𝛽\\beta in the NNF.333This is to\nbe contrasted with and-decomposable NNFs, known as Decomposable NNFs (DNNFs) [ref]8, which have been studied extensively. Due to this form and some of its weakenings, \nprovided closed-form complete reasons for certain classes of classifiers that are based on decision graphs.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: humans? We will address the first question next\nwhile leaving the second question until later in the tutorial.
