      "content": "Paper Title: Deployment Challenges of Industrial Intrusion Detection Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor readers unfamiliar with the topic of industrial intrusion detection, we motivate the rationale of retrofitting detective solutions to ICS and present one IIDS from the literature and evaluated in this publication in the following in detail. Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) resemble the foundation of many modern applications ranging from manufacturing, over the production and distribution of water, gas, or electricity, to autonomous vehicles .\nBesides this diversity, one typical architecture that all these applications rely on are digital control loops measuring the environment with sensors and influencing it through actuators usually interconnected with industrial control networks .\nConsequently, ICSs are likewise susceptible to regularly occurring threats from cyberspace , which can ultimately cause harm to the physical processes, businesses, and environment.\nFor their mitigation, either preventive measures such as authenticated and encrypted communication channels [ref]7 or detective approaches like Intrusion Detection Systems [ref]20 can be implemented.\nThis publication focuses on the latter, which aim at timely indicating malicious behavior to ICS operators before actual harm can be conducted and avoid attacks remaining uncovered. To detect unwanted behavior, the detection methodologies underlying industrial IDSs make great use of domain knowledge and ICS-specific behavior 1.\nOne key attribute is ICSs’ notorious predictability, as they usually perform repetitive tasks .\nBased on a set of training data, note that supervised IIDSs require attack samples while OCC methods solely train on benign data, a detection model can be trained and tuned with hyperparameters to indicate unexpected deviations, such as cyberattacks.\nThe goal of each approach and their tuning is to detect as many cyberattacks as possible while emitting few false positive alerts, which would have to be falsified by operators afterward.\nThe performance of an IIDS is ultimately measured with metrics [ref]20 like the F1 score. One approach to implementing such an OCC-based IIDS, which serves as our introductory example, is MinMax (cf. Fig. 1) 0.\nThe detection methodology is based on the fact that physical values measured by sensors usually reside within precise limits, e.g., a boiler inside an ICS has a lower and upper operational temperature.\nMinMax first extracts these limits from a set of benign training data.\nThen, since physical measurements can underlie natural variation and noise, the approach enlarges these limits by a configurable hyperparameter to avoid too many false positive alarms.\nIn the end, an alarm is raised if a measurement exceeds or undercuts the trained threshold.\nFinally, the ICS operators are in charge of analyzing the raised alarm and initiating countermeasures. For OCC-based IIDSs, as depicted here, the training requires benign data recorded, e.g., during normal ICS behavior.\nStill, for deployment, hyperparameters, i.e., the threshold, have to be adequately selected to reduce the number of false-positives and not miss attacks (cf. Fig. 1).\nContrary, while supervised IIDSs can find adequate hyperparameters themselves during training as they also learn on malicious samples, obtaining this malicious data in ICS is much more challenging as it involves actual physical processes .\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: which can ultimately cause harm to the physical processes, businesses, and environment.\nFor their mitigation, either preventive measures such as authenticated and encrypted communication channels [ref]7 or detective approaches like Intrusion Detection Systems [ref]20 can be implemented.\nThis publication focuses on the latter, which aim at timely indicating malicious behavior to ICS operators\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
