      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Phytoplankton Parasite Detection Using Autoencoders\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPhytoplankton are key players in aquatic systems, mediating biogeochemical cycles and forming the base of the food webs . Phytoplankton population dynamics result from the interplay between resource availability and mortality losses . While some loss mechanisms, such as grazing, are well known, the contribution of other loss mechanisms such as parasitism remains poorly considered and largely understudied in many aquatic systems. Phytoplankton are susceptible to a wide variety of parasites such as viruses, bacteria, protists and fungi. They can cause mortality of certain phytoplankton species, thereby altering phytoplankton bloom dynamics and changing the cycling and flow of energy and matter in aquatic ecosystems , , . Zoosporic or nanoflagellate parasites infecting phytoplankton encompass a highly diverse functional group of eukaryotic protist and fungal species . They have in common the production of free-living motile stages as their infective propagules which attach to a phytoplankton host cell and further develop either inside (endobiotic) or outside (epibiotic) the host cell, using the host resources for their growth and reproduction. Due to their inconspicuous nature they are difficult to identify and something we are not able to identify typically tends to get overlooked or discarded. Consequently, although the presence and potential importance of these phytoplankton parasites is increasingly recognized, quantitative data in nature is extremely scarce. An additional challenge includes capturing rapid infection dynamics on a relevant temporal (eg., days) and spatial scale. Obtaining quantitative information of parasite infections by traditional methods is labour-intensive and time-consuming, limiting the spatial and/or temporal coverage of studies investigating phytoplankton-parasite interactions . Recent technological advances in imaging instruments have made it possible to collect large volumes of plankton image data to study plankton populations, opening new research possibilities . The possibility of high frequency sampling enabled with imaging instruments can allow to better understand phytoplankton dynamics and their potential interaction with parasites . However, while methods for automatic recognition of phytoplankton classes have been widely developed, methods to automatic recognition of parasites infections are still underdeveloped for phytoplankton. This is likely associated to challenges to obtain a sufficient amount of image data of plankton parasites, which requires screening of a huge amount of raw image data, urging for automated solutions for the task. The scarcity of plankton parasite images is the major challenge for developing deep learning-based computer vision methods for detecting them. While object detection methods such as Faster R-CNN [ref]9 and YOLO 0 have been shown to achieve high accuracy on various detection tasks, including parasite detection (see, e.g., 1), they struggle when the amount of training data is limited. Therefore, a more promising approach is to formulate parasite detection as an anomaly detection task. Here the idea is to train the model with images of healthy plankton and to detect images that deviate from the data the models were trained on. Due to the availability of large amounts of plankton image data without parasites for training and relatively small intra-class variation among healthy samples, the images that deviate notably from the training data can be expected to contain potential parasites. In this work, phytoplankton parasite detection is considered. The problem is formulated as an anomaly detection problem and solved using an autoencoder. The proposed method consists of a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE) 2 that encodes the input image into a compressed latent representation and uses it to reconstruct the original image. The rationale is that when the autoencoder is trained only on images of healthy phytoplankton it fails to reconstruct the parasites which allows to detect them from the difference image (see Fig. 1). The proposed method further employs the HardNet 3 feature extractor and Local Outlier Factor 4 for classifying between healthy plankton and plankton with parasites. (a)                      (b)                   (c)                      (d) In the experimental part of the work, an extensive set of different backbone convolutional neural networks (CNNs), autoencoder architectures, feature extractors, and classifiers are systematically evaluated on challenging phytoplankton image data to find the best combination to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. Furthermore, we compare the autoencoder-based anomaly detection method to a Faster R-CNN based object detector. The results show that the proposed method obtains comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN object detector while requiring no images with parasites for training. This makes the autoencoder based method a promising approach for wider utilization in plankton image analysis where collecting large training data of plankton with parasites is infeasible.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: The scarcity of plankton parasite images is the major challenge for developing deep learning-based computer vision methods for detecting them.
