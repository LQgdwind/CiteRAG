      "content": "Paper Title: High-Throughput Flexible Belief Propagation List Decoder for Polar Codes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPolar codes, proposed by Arıkan in , have become an integral part of 5G new radio (NR), where they were ratified as the standard codes for the control channels of 5G enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) scenarios .\nAlong with the invention of polar codes, Arıkan introduced successive cancellation (SC) decoding and belief propagation (BP) decoding.\nFollowing the evolution of communication scenarios, both SC and BP decoding led the development of polar decoding algorithms and implementations, which were extended into a series of advanced polar decoders such as SC list (SCL)      [ref]8 , BP list (BPL) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8, and BP flip (BPF) 9 0 1 2 decoders. While the original SC decoding algorithm can achieve channel capacity at infinite code lengths, it shows poor error-correcting performance with practical finite code lengths.\nTo improve the error-correcting performance of SC decoding, SCL decoding was proposed in  to keep a list of up to 𝕃𝕃\\mathbb{L} candidate codewords.\nAdditionally, when concatenated with cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes , polar codes with SCL decoding outperform low-density parity-check (LDPC) and Turbo codes in terms of the error-correcting performance 3.\nTo satisfy the low-latency and high throughput requirements of eMBB scenarios, node-based fast SCL decoders    [ref]8  focus on exploiting special constituent codes 4 5 6 7 8, which help to avoid traversing the lower stages of the decoding tree to provide a significant reduction in decoding latency compared to conventional bit-wise SCL decoders.\nThe state-of-the-art (SOA) node-based SCL decoder  with a list size (L=8𝐿8L=8) achieves a throughput of more than 2.942.942.94 Gbps, which fits the reliability, latency, and throughput requirements of eMBB scenarios.\nHowever, when considering the ultra-high peak data rate requirements of future communication systems 9, SC-based decoders become impractical due to the serial processing inherent in these algorithms    [ref]8 . In contrast to SC-based decoding, BP decoding is an inherently parallel algorithm.\nBP decoding can thus be implemented easily in a multi-stage factor graph in pursuit of a much higher throughput 0.\nAdditionally, BP decoding has the potential to realize iterative detection and decoding to achieve better system performance than separate detection and decoding 1 2, which further raises the interest in BP decoding for academia and industry.\nThough the error-correcting performance of BP decoding improves as the iteration number increases, it is still far behind the SCL performance.\nBPF decoding 9 0 1 2 and BPL decoding 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 are two advanced BP algorithms that can approach the performance of SCL by expanding the exploration of candidate codewords.\nBPF decoding guesses the positions of error-prone bits and sequentially corrects them in additional decoding attempts.\nUnfortunately, online identification of error-prone bits 0 1 2 through sorting and post-processing of channel messages increases the hardware complexity and degrades the maximum operating frequency 2.\nAlternatively, BPL decoding proposed in 1 tries to decode on multiple permuted factor graphs (PFGs), where the number of possible PFGs is n!𝑛n! (n=log2⁡N)𝑛subscript2𝑁(n=\\log_{2}{N}) for length-N𝑁N polar codes.\nDecoding schedules of BPL can be divided into parallel 1 2 3 4 and serial schedules 7, respectively.\nIn parallel BPL decoding, 𝕃𝕃\\mathbb{L} independent BP decoders operate in parallel (each BP decoder works on a unique PFG) and the optimal codeword with the minimum Euclidean distance to the received signals is selected from the 𝕃𝕃\\mathbb{L} identified candidate codewords.\nHowever, parallel BPL decoding has very poor hardware utilization, especially for large list sizes.\nTo avoid the high hardware consumption caused by the parallel architecture, the authors of 7 proposed a serial BPL decoding schedule, in which shuffling the input LLRs can be substituted for permutations of the factor graph stages.\nThis hardware-friendly decoding strategy allows BPL decoding to reuse a single BP decoder at the cost of merely shuffling the input LLRs into a specific order for each PFG. To improve the error-correcting performance of BPL decoding, numerous researchers have explored methods of optimizing the PFG selection, including empirical methods 3 1 7 and analytical methods 5 4 6.\nIt is noteworthy that the authors of 4 first derived the permutation gain for parallel BPL decoding, which provides the inspiration for analytically solving the optimal PFG selection.\nIn view of hardware implementations, many works of BP decoders have been presented in 4 0 5 6 7 8 9.\nCompared to the classical single-column BP architectures 0, the SOA double-column bidirectional-propagation architecture 9 instantiates two processing element (PE) arrays and propagates the left-to-right and right-to-left messages simultaneously to improve the throughput.\nMoreover, the most challenging task for the BPL decoder is the implementation of flexible permutations since the PFG selection algorithms 5 4 6 0 are generally dynamic, corresponding to varying code configurations or channel environments.\nEven if based on area-efficient serial decoding, the BPL decoder still needs to support the generation of flexible permutations by shuffling the input LLRs into a specific order for each PFG.\nA straightforward method is to utilize the Beneš network 1 2, which is an optimal non-blocking network that can achieve any arbitrary permutation.\nHowever, the design space of permutations is n!𝑛n! instead of N!𝑁N! for length-N𝑁N polar codes, and the control signals of the Beneš network are difficult to generate on-the-fly for each PFG.\nIt is not efficient to adopt the Beneš network in the BPL decoder.\nIn summary, there are thus two critical problems for the BPL decoder: How to select the optimal PFG set from n!𝑛n! PFGs for length-N𝑁N polar codes? How to efficiently implement flexible permutations for BPL decoding in hardware? It is further noteworthy that BPL decoding is a particular case of a generalized automorphism ensemble (AE) decoding, in which we can deploy the SC, SCL, or BP decoding on multiple PFGs to achieve ML performance of polar or Reed-Muller (RM) codes 3 4.\nHence, the solutions to these two problems are significant for both BPL and for generalized AE decoding.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: scenarios, both SC and BP decoding led the development of polar decoding algorithms and implementations, which were extended into a series of advanced polar decoders such as SC list (SCL)      [ref]8 , BP list (BPL) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8, and BP flip (BPF) 9 0 1 2 decoders.
