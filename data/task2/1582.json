MIS⁡(G)MIS𝐺\\operatorname{{\\textsf{MIS}}}(G)). We recall principal notions on lattices and closure systems .\nA mapping ϕ:2X→2X:italic-ϕ→superscript2𝑋superscript2𝑋\\phi\\colon 2^{X}\\to 2^{X} is a closure operator if for any Y,Z⊆X𝑌𝑍𝑋Y,Z\\subseteq X, Y⊆ϕ​(Y)𝑌italic-ϕ𝑌Y\\subseteq\\phi(Y) (extensive), Y⊆Z𝑌𝑍Y\\subseteq Z implies ϕ​(Y)⊆ϕ​(Z)italic-ϕ𝑌italic-ϕ𝑍\\phi(Y)\\subseteq\\phi(Z) (isotone), and ϕ​(ϕ​(Y))=ϕ​(Y)italic-ϕitalic-ϕ𝑌italic-ϕ𝑌\\phi(\\phi(Y))=\\phi(Y) (idempotent).\nWe call ϕ​(Y)italic-ϕ𝑌\\phi(Y) the closure of Y𝑌Y.\nThe family ℱ={ϕ​(Y)∣Y⊆X}ℱconditional-setitalic-ϕ𝑌𝑌𝑋\\mathcal{F}=\\{\\phi(Y)\\mid Y\\subseteq X\\} ordered by set-inclusion forms a\nclosure system or lattice.\nA closure system ℱ⊆2Xℱsuperscript2𝑋\\mathcal{F}\\subseteq 2^{X} is a set system such that\nX∈ℱ𝑋ℱX\\in\\mathcal{F} and for any F1,F2∈ℱsubscript𝐹1subscript𝐹2ℱF_{1},F_{2}\\in\\mathcal{F}, F1∩F2subscript𝐹1subscript𝐹2F_{1}\\cap F_{2} also belongs to ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}.\nElements of ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} are closed sets and we say that F𝐹F is closed if F∈ℱ𝐹ℱF\\in\\mathcal{F}.\nEach closure system ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} induces a unique closure operator ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi such that ϕ​(Y)=⋂{F∈ℱ∣Y⊆F}italic-ϕ𝑌conditional-set𝐹ℱ𝑌𝐹\\phi(Y)=\\bigcap\\{F\\in\\mathcal{F}\\mid Y\\subseteq F\\}, for any Y⊆X𝑌𝑋Y\\subseteq X.\nThus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between closure systems and operators.\nWithout loss of generality, we will assume that ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi and ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} are standard:\nϕ​(∅)=∅italic-ϕ\\phi(\\emptyset)=\\emptyset and for any x∈X𝑥𝑋x\\in X, ϕ​(x)∖{x}italic-ϕ𝑥𝑥\\phi(x)\\setminus\\{x\\} is closed.\nNote that ∅\\emptyset is thus the minimum element of ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, called the bottom.\nSimilarly, X𝑋X is the top of ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}.

We move to implicational bases  .\nAn implication si an expression of the form A​→⁡B𝐴→𝐵A\\operatorname{\\rightarrow}B with A,B⊆X𝐴𝐵𝑋A,B\\subseteq X.\nWe call A𝐴A the premise and B𝐵B the conclusion.\nA set ΣΣ\\Sigma of implications over X𝑋X is an implicational base over X𝑋X.\nWe denote by |Σ|Σ|\\Sigma| the number of implications in ΣΣ\\Sigma.\nA subset F⊆X𝐹𝑋F\\subseteq X satisfies or models ΣΣ\\Sigma if for any A​→⁡B∈Σ𝐴→𝐵ΣA\\operatorname{\\rightarrow}B\\in\\Sigma, A⊆F𝐴𝐹A\\subseteq F implies B⊆F𝐵𝐹B\\subseteq F.\nThe family ℱ={F⊆X∣F​ satisfies ​Σ}ℱconditional-set𝐹𝑋𝐹 satisfies Σ\\mathcal{F}=\\{F\\subseteq X\\mid F\\text{ satisfies }\\Sigma\\} is a closure system whose induced closure operator ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi is the forward\nchaining algorithm.\nThis procedure starts from any subset Y𝑌Y of X𝑋X and constructs a sequence Y=Y0⊆⋯⊆Yk=ϕ​(Y)𝑌subscript𝑌0⋯subscript𝑌𝑘italic-ϕ𝑌Y=Y_{0}\\subseteq\\dots\\subseteq Y_{k}=\\phi(Y) of subsets of\nX𝑋X such that for any i∈[k]𝑖delimited-[]𝑘i\\in[k], Yi=Yi−1∪{B∣∃A​→⁡B∈Σ​s.t.​A⊆Yi−1}subscript𝑌𝑖subscript𝑌𝑖1conditional-set𝐵𝐴→𝐵Σs.t.𝐴subscript𝑌𝑖1Y_{i}=Y_{i-1}\\cup\\{B\\mid\\exists A\\operatorname{\\rightarrow}B\\in\\Sigma\\,{\\emph{s.t.}}\\,A\\subseteq Y_{i-1}\\}.\nThe algorithm stops when Yi−1=Yisubscript𝑌𝑖1subscript𝑌𝑖Y_{i-1}=Y_{i}. We now introduce our main problem.\nFollowing   [ref]2 we call an\ninconsistency relation any symmetric and irreflexive relation over X𝑋X.\nSuch a relation is sometimes called a site  or a\nconflict relation .\nUsually, inconsistency relations need to satisfy more conditions in order to capture\nmedian or modular-semilattices  .\nAs we do not need further restrictions here, we can choose to model inconsistency as a\ngraph Gc=(X,Ec)subscript𝐺𝑐𝑋subscript𝐸𝑐G_{c}=(X,E_{c}), and call it a consistency-graph.\nAn edge u​v𝑢𝑣uv of Ecsubscript𝐸𝑐E_{c} represents an inconsistent pair of elements in X𝑋X.\nA subset Y𝑌Y which does not contain any inconsistent pair (i.e., an independent set of\nGcsubscript𝐺𝑐G_{c}) is called consistent.\nLet ΣΣ\\Sigma be an implicational base over X𝑋X and a Gc=(X,Ec)subscript𝐺𝑐𝑋subscript𝐸𝑐G_{c}=(X,E_{c}) consistency-graph.\nWe denote by maxCC​(Σ,Gc)maxCCΣsubscriptGc{\\textsf{maxCC}}(\\Sigma,G_{c}) the set of maximal consistent closed sets of ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, that\nis maxCC​(Σ,Gc)=max⊆​(ℱ∩IS​(Gc))maxCCΣsubscriptGcsubscriptmaxℱISsubscriptGc{\\textsf{maxCC}}(\\Sigma,G_{c})={\\textsf{max}}_{\\subseteq}(\\mathcal{F}\\cap{\\textsf{IS}}(G_{c})).\nAn example of implicational base along with a consistency-graph is given in Figure\n1.\nOur problem is the following. Maximal Consistent closed-sets Enumeration (MCCEnum) Input: An implicational base ΣΣ\\Sigma over X𝑋X, a non-empty consistency-graph Gc=(X,Ec)subscript𝐺𝑐𝑋subscript𝐸𝑐G_{c}=(X,E_{c}). Output: The set maxCC​(Σ,Gc)maxCCΣsubscriptGc{\\textsf{maxCC}}(\\Sigma,G_{c}) of maximal consistent closed sets of ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} with respect\nto Gcsubscript𝐺𝑐G_{c}. Remark that X𝑋X is part of the input.\nIf Gcsubscript𝐺𝑐G_{c} is empty, MCCEnum is easy to solve as X𝑋X is the unique element of\nmaxCC​(Σ,Gc)maxCCΣsubscriptGc{\\textsf{maxCC}}(\\Sigma,G_{c}).\nHence, we will assume without loss of generality that Gcsubscript𝐺𝑐G_{c} is not empty.\nIf ΣΣ\\Sigma is empty, then MCCEnum is equivalent to the enumeration of maximal\nindependent sets of a graph which can be efficiently solved .\nIf premises of ΣΣ\\Sigma have size 111, the problem also reduces to maximal independent sets\nenumeration  .\nIn  the authors identify, for a fixed ΣΣ\\Sigma, the\nconsistency-graphs Gcsubscript𝐺𝑐G_{c} such that MIS⁡(Gc)=maxCC​(Σ,Gc)MISsubscript𝐺𝑐maxCCΣsubscriptGc\\operatorname{{\\textsf{MIS}}}(G_{c})={\\textsf{maxCC}}(\\Sigma,G_{c}). We conclude with a recall on enumeration algorithms .\nLet 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} be an algorithm with input x𝑥x and output a set of solutions R​(x)𝑅𝑥R(x).\nWe denote by |R​(x)|𝑅𝑥|R(x)| the number of solutions in R​(x)𝑅𝑥R(x).\nWe assume that each solution in R​(x)𝑅𝑥R(x) has size poly⁡(|x|)poly𝑥\\operatorname{{\\textsf{poly}}}(|x|).\nThe algorithm 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is running in output-polynomial time if its execution time\nis bounded by poly⁡(|x|+|R​(x)|)poly𝑥𝑅𝑥\\operatorname{{\\textsf{poly}}}(|x|+|R(x)|).\nIt is incremental-polynomial if for any 1≤i≤|R​(x)|1𝑖𝑅𝑥1\\leq i\\leq|R(x)|, the time\nspent between the i𝑖i-th and i+1𝑖1i+1-th output is bounded by poly⁡(|x|+i)poly𝑥𝑖\\operatorname{{\\textsf{poly}}}(|x|+i), and\nthe algorithm stops in time poly⁡(|x|)poly𝑥\\operatorname{{\\textsf{poly}}}(|x|) after the last output.\nIf the delay between two solutions output and after the last one is poly⁡(|x|)poly𝑥\\operatorname{{\\textsf{poly}}}(|x|),\n𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} has polynomial-delay.\nNote that if 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is running in incremental-polynomial time, it is also\noutput-polynomial.\nFinally, we say that 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} runs in output-quasipolynomial time if is execution\ntime is bounded by Npolylog​(N)superscript𝑁polylogNN^{{\\textsf{polylog}}(N)} where N=|x|+|R​(x)|𝑁𝑥𝑅𝑥N=|x|+|R(x)|.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: A\\operatorname{\\rightarrow}B\\in\\Sigma\\,{\\emph{s.t.}}\\,A\\subseteq Y_{i-1}\\}.\nThe algorithm stops when Yi−1=Yisubscript𝑌𝑖1subscript𝑌𝑖Y_{i-1}=Y_{i}.
