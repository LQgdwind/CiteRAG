      "content": "Paper Title: giotto-ph: A Python Library for High-Performance Computation of Persistent Homology of Vietoris–Rips Filtrations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo the best of our knowledge, at the time of writing Ripser444https://github.com/Ripser/ripser, retrieved 1 August 2021.  is the de facto state of the art and reference for computing VR persistence barcodes on CPUs. Ripser uses multiple known optimizations like clearing  and cohomology . Furthermore, it makes use of other performance-oriented ideas, such as the implicit representation of the (co)boundary and reduced (co)boundary matrices, and the emergent/apparent pairs optimizations (we refer to  for definitions and details). At the time of writing, the latest version of Ripser is v1.2.555Release date: 25 February 2021. In that version, to the emergent pairs optimization in use until that point was added an optimization based on apparent pairs. Although Ripser v1.2 is arguably the fastest existing code for computing VR barcodes in a sequential (i.e., single CPU core) setting, it has no parallel capabilities. Overcoming this limitation is possible as two recent lines of work   demonstrate. Based on a “pairing uniqueness lemma” proved by Cohen-Steiner et al. , Morozov and Nigmetov  observe that the reduction of the (co)boundary matrix can, in fact, be performed out of order as long as column additions are always performed left to right.666“Left to right” here is meant relative to the filtration order. Therefore – these authors suggest – any column reduction can be efficiently performed in parallel provided adequate synchronisation is used. A functional proof of concept of this idea as applied to a now superseded777In particular, based on Ripser v1.1 and hence not using apparent pairs, cf. Figure 1. version of Ripser was put in the public domain in June 2020 , but has not led to a distributable software package. A generic implementation of the ideas in , not tied to Vietoris–Rips filtrations and instead designed to make lock-free reduction possible on any (co)boundary matrix, has recently been published as the Oineus library [ref]32. Although optimizations such as clearing and implicit matrix reduction appear to have been implemented there, the code and performance are not optimized for Vietoris–Rips filtrations, and in particular no implementation of the emergent or apparent pair optimization is present there at this time.888At the time of writing, this library is in version 1.0. We were not aware of its existence during the development of our code. Zhang et al.’s Ripser++  implements the idea of finding apparent pairs in parallel on a GPU to accelerate the computation of VR barcodes. Despite this, Ripser++ is not fully parallel. For each dimension to process, it divides the computation into three sub-tasks: “filtration construction and clearing”, “finding apparent pairs” and “sub-matrix reduction”. The last of these steps is not parallel and it is executed on the CPU. Accordingly to Amdahl’s law,999https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl’s_law this processing sequence is expected to yield only diminishing returns when augmenting the number of parallel resources. Although performance gains have been demonstrated in  – particularly when using high-end GPUs – there is room for extending parallelism to the third sub-task above, which we try to harvest in this work by integrating the aforementioned ideas from . All implementations presented in this subsection (barring [ref]32, which also provides some Python bindings) are written in low-level languages (C++, CUDA). However, researchers today make wide use of higher-level languages – Python, for instance, is the dominant one in several fields. It is therefore natural that libraries have been developed to couple Python’s ease of use with the high performance provided by these pieces of code. Ripser.py  is probably the most notable of these implementations, providing an intuitive interface for VR filtrations wrapping Ripser at its core. The authors of the library forked the original Ripser implementation and added support for non-zero birth times, as well as the possibility to compute and retrieve cocycles. Meanwhile, in 2020, Boissonnat and Pritam presented a new algorithm they called Edge Collapser (EC) . Independently of the code used to compute barcodes, EC can be used as a pre-processing step on any flag filtration to remove “redundant” edges – and modify the filtration values of some others – while ensuring that the flag filtration obtained from the thus “sparsified” weighted graph has the same barcode as the original filtration. Although it introduces an initial overhead, pre-processing by EC can dramatically improve the end-to-end run-time for barcode computation by greatly reducing the complexity of the downstream reduction steps. As reported by those authors, this is especially true when one wishes to compute barcodes in high homology dimensions, and/or when one is dealing with large datasets. An implementation of EC has already been integrated into the GUDHI library  .\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: of the ideas in , not tied to Vietoris–Rips filtrations and instead designed to make lock-free reduction possible on any (co)boundary matrix, has recently been published as the Oineus library [ref]32.
