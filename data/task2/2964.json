      "content": "Paper Title: Mastering Atari Games with Limited Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement learning has achieved great success on many challenging problems. Notable work includes DQN , AlphaGo  and OpenAI Five [ref]7. However, most of these works come at the cost of a large number of environmental interactions. For example, AlphaZero  [ref]39 needs to play 21 million games at training time. On the contrary, a professional human player can only play around 5 games per day, meaning it would take a human player 11,500 years to achieve the same amount of experience. The sample complexity might be less of an issue when applying RL algorithms in simulation and games. However, when it comes to real-world problems, such as robotic manipulation, healthcare, and advertisement recommendation systems, achieving high performance while maintaining low sample complexity is the key to viability. People have made a lot of progress in sample efficient RL in the past years  [ref]12     . Among them, model-based methods have attracted a lot of attention, since both the data from real environments and the “imagined data” from the model can be used to train the policy, making these methods particularly sample-efficient  [ref]12. However, most of the successes are in state-based environments. In image-based environments, some model-based methods such as MuZero  and Dreamer V2  achieve super-human performance, but they are not sample efficient; other methods such as SimPLe  is quite efficient but achieve inferior performance (0.144 human normalized median scores). Recently, data-augmented and self-supervised methods applied to model-free methods have achieved more success in the data-efficient regime . However, they still fail to achieve the levels which can be expected of a human. Therefore, for improving the sample efficiency as well as keeping superior performance, we find the following three components are essential to the model-based visual RL agent: a self-supervised environment model,\na mechanism to alleviate the model compounding error, and a method to correct the off-policy issue.\nIn this work, we propose EfficientZero, a model-based RL algorithm that achieves high performance with limited data. Our proposed method is built on MuZero. We make three critical changes: (1) use self-supervised learning to learn a temporally consistent environment model, (2) learn the value prefix in an end-to-end manner, thus helping to alleviate the compounding error in the model, (3) use the learned model to correct off-policy value targets. As illustrated as Figure 1, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the widely used Atari  100k benchmark and it achieves super-human performance with only 2 hours of real-time gameplay. More specifically, our model achieves 194.3% mean human normalized performance and 109.0% median human normalized performance. As a reference, DQN  achieves 220% mean human normalized performance, and 96% median human normalized performance, at the cost of 500 times more data (200 million frames).\nTo further verify the effectiveness of EfficientZero, we conduct experiments on some simulated robotics environments of the DeepMind Control (DMControl) suite. It achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms the state SAC which directly learns from the ground truth states. Our sample efficient and high-performance algorithm opens the possibility of having more impact on many real-world problems.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Reinforcement learning has achieved great success on many challenging problems.
