Dm​i​ntsuperscriptsubscript𝐷𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑡D_{min}^{t} can be calculated with rather complex algorithms for any tree t𝑡t   [ref]11. Algorithms to calculate Dm​i​ntsuperscriptsubscript𝐷𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑡D_{min}^{t} satisfying a certain constraint are also available but less known. See   for planarity (no edge crossings) and   for projectivity, a particular case of planarity. Here we are interested in compact formulae for Dm​i​ntsuperscriptsubscript𝐷𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑡D_{min}^{t} for certain classes of trees or general lower bounds. In his pioneering research, Iordanskii, in addition to showing that Dm​i​nt≤Dm​i​ns​t​a​rsuperscriptsubscript𝐷𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑡superscriptsubscript𝐷𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟D_{min}^{t}\\leq D_{min}^{star} , also showed that the maximum value of Dm​i​ntsuperscriptsubscript𝐷𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑡D_{min}^{t} over all trees of n𝑛n vertices with maximum degree k1subscript𝑘1k_{1} such that k1≥3subscript𝑘13k_{1}\\geq 3 satisfies the following inequalities  The asymptotic order in n𝑛n of the expression for the lower and upper bound is with a constant factor for the lower bound\nand a constant factor for the upper bound.  reviews various techniques to obtain lower bounds of Dtsuperscript𝐷𝑡D^{t}. In a network with m𝑚m edges, the edge method consists of picking the m𝑚m shortest edges noting that there can be at most n−d𝑛𝑑n-d edges of length d𝑑d, for 1≤d≤n−11𝑑𝑛11\\leq d\\leq n-1.

The next theorem presents a lower bound of Dm​i​ntsuperscriptsubscript𝐷𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑡D_{min}^{t} that depends exclusively on the degree sequence and that is obtained with the degree method. A similar application of the degree method can be found in . For any tree t𝑡t of n𝑛n vertices, where is the number of vertices of odd degree. Let Ditsuperscriptsubscript𝐷𝑖𝑡D_{i}^{t} be the sum of the length of the edges attached to the i𝑖i-th vertex of t𝑡t.\nThe degree method is based on a star tree decomposition of D𝐷D in a network, whereby  Di,m​i​ntsuperscriptsubscript𝐷𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑡D_{i,min}^{t} is a lower bound of Ditsuperscriptsubscript𝐷𝑖𝑡D_{i}^{t} defined as  if kisubscript𝑘𝑖k_{i} is even,\nand if kisubscript𝑘𝑖k_{i} is odd.\nCombining both results, one obtains Inserting the last result into equation 13, one obtains ∎ In a linear tree, ⟨k2⟩=4−6/ndelimited-⟨⟩superscript𝑘246𝑛\\left<k^{2}\\right>=4-6/n  and q=2𝑞2q=2 give D0=n−1subscript𝐷0𝑛1D_{0}=n-1, matching Dm​i​nl​i​n​e​a​rsuperscriptsubscript𝐷𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑎𝑟D_{min}^{linear}.
