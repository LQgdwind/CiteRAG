Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Video Extrapolation in Space and Time\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSynthesizing novel views based on 2D images is a challenging problem, as it requires the reasoning of the 3D structure of the perceptual world.\nAs shown in¬†Fig.¬†2(a) and¬†Fig.¬†2(b), monocular view synthesis approaches¬† [ref]38 [ref]10 take I11subscriptùêº11I_{11} as inputs and outputs the synthesized image for a query view j‚â†1ùëó1j\\neq 1. Stereo view synthesis approaches¬†[ref]44 are similar but take in two input views I11,I12subscriptùêº11subscriptùêº12I_{11},I_{12}.\nMost of these approaches synthesize novel views based on camera parameters estimated from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques, except for Lai¬†et al.¬†[ref]10 which uses camera parameters predicted by the model. These methods focus exclusively on spatial extrapolation and do not take the temporal axis into account.\nPrevious works¬† [ref]44   use layered representation and apply per-layer warping to obtain the novel view based on camera poses.\nSynSin¬†[ref]38 and Worldsheet¬† predict the depth from a monocular image input and warps a 3D representation of the scene in the features space and pixel space, respectively, to synthesize novel views.\nIn comparison, our proposed VEST encapsulates NVS but also has the ability to perform temporal extrapolation. Closer to ours, Lin¬†et al.¬† and Yoon¬†et al.¬† tackle the problem of NVS for dynamic scenes. Lin¬†et al.¬† addresses the temporal inconsistency of the MPI representation when applied to scenes with moving objects by identifying the error-prone regions with a learned 3D mask volume.\nThere are three key differences between our model and Lin¬†et al.\nFirst, they require two images from synchronized stereo cameras as inputs during inference, while our method takes in two consecutive frames from a single camera.\nSecond, they assume a static camera and static background while we do not.\nThird, they rely on the static background computed from the full video sequences from two source views, while ours directly predicts the future video sequence based on two input frames.\nYoon¬†et al.¬† proposes to fuse the depth estimated from a single view and multiple views with a depth fusion network, and predicts the novel view on top. It requires segmentation labels and optical flow inputs, while our method is fully self-supervised.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: views based on 2D images is a challenging problem, as it requires the reasoning of the 3D structure of the perceptual world.\nAs shown in¬†Fig.¬†2(a) and¬†Fig.¬†2(b), monocular view synthesis approaches¬† [ref]38 [ref]10 take I11subscriptùêº11I_{11} as inputs and outputs the synthesized image for a query view j‚â†1ùëó1j\\neq 1.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
