Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

It has been well-studied in many visual tasks like image recognition , segmentation [ref]34, and object detection .\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, only a few recent works have explicitly tackled the class imbalance problem in SGG.\n[ref]21 firstly pointed out the imbalance problem.\n and  proposed a new balanced evaluation metric, i.e., mean Recall.\nBesides,  unified the statistical knowledge with a deep architecture to facilitate scene graph generation. [ref]17 exploited external knowledge and image reconstruction to refine image features.  pruned those easy frequent relations and introduced a new dataset.\nHowever, the performance of those methods is far from satisfactory.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: training process is crucial to achieve an optimal training and fully exploit the potential of model architecture.
