      "content": "Paper Title: Making deep neural networks right for the right scientific reasons by interacting with their explanations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, AI methods, especially machine learning with various directions and algorithms  , have become more and more successful in a wide range of areas like computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics, among others. Consider e.g. AlphaZero surpassing human-level performance in playing chess and Go. During its self-play training process, AlphaZero discovered a remarkable level of Go knowledge. This included not only fundamental elements of human Go knowledge, but also non-standard strategies beyond the scope of traditional human Go knowledge , exemplifying the potential of these methods to discover strategies previously unknown even to experts of the domain.\nHowever, studies from various applications such as    [ref]3 have revealed that learning machines can also result in “Clever Hans”-like moments, i.e., human-undesired strategies where the machine exploits artifacts in the dataset. To “un-Hans” machines, we introduced the novel learning setting of “explanatory interactive learning” (XIL) and illustrated its benefits. XIL adds the scientist into the training loop. She interactively revises the original model via providing feedback on its explanations, used to automatically augment the training with counterexamples or to modify the model using rrr. Our experimental results demonstrate that users care strongly about “Clever Hans”-like moments in machine learning and XIL can indeed help avoiding them. There are several possible avenues for future work to overcome the current limitations of XIL.\n\nAcquiring annotations, especially of explanations, can be time consuming. The number of interactions required in order to reach an acceptable state is an open issue .\nHence, one should work on optimal query strategies for XIL that aim at minimizing the interaction efforts. Adapting regret bounds from co-active learning  might be an interesting alternative.\nMoreover, the data at hand may not always allow XIL to fully alleviate wrong reasons without decreasing the network’s predictive performance. One should develop ways for keeping the drop as small as possible.\nFurthermore, XIL relies on two assumptions, namely, (a) faithful explanations can be computed,\nand (b) the user feedback is faithful, too. Assumption (a) is still subject to very active research,\nparticularly for deep learning methods [ref]31 (see the supplement). One should improve the quality and robustness of XAI methods and also explore XIL for interpretable models .\nIf the user is rather confident about the right reasons, learning to explain methods such as hint provide an interesting avenue for future work. Our initial results, see the supplement, are encouraging. However,\neven scientific experts do not always know the reasons for predictions.\nTherefore, one should strive to better understand the effects of wrong feedback and even adversarial attacks  on XIL.\nAdditionally, one should turn other interactive learning settings such as coactive , active imitation , mixed-initiative interactive [ref]19 and guided probabilistic learning  into explanatory one. Lastly, because it is not yet clear what makes explanations good for humans , one should extend explanatory interactions towards using alternative explanations, multiple modalities and counterfactuals  . In any case, interacting with explanations of machine learning models is an enabler for scientific discoveries for humans and machines in cooperation.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: human Go knowledge , exemplifying the potential of these methods to discover strategies previously unknown even to experts of the domain.\nHowever, studies from various applications such as    [ref]3 have revealed that learning machines can also result in “Clever Hans”-like moments, i.e., human-undesired strategies where the machine exploits artifacts in the dataset.
