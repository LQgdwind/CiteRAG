      "content": "Paper Title: Spectral Adversarial Training for Robust Graph Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo comprehensively compare our proposed approach with several state-of-the-art methods, we consider the following four categories of methods: (i) Random and GCN-PGD from structured-based AT methods; (ii) BVAT, GraphVAT, and LAT from feature-based AT methods; (iii) Jaccard and SVD from adversarial purification methods and (iv) SimPGCN and MedianGCN from methods with robust architectures. Random [ref]8: it is the simplest structure-based AT that randomly drops edges during each training step to generate adversarial examples. GCN-PGD [ref]13: it is an attack-oriented AT that generates adversarial examples on the discrete graph structure based on projected gradient descent (PGD) attack. BVAT : it is a batch virtual AT that promotes the smoothness of GNNs by generating virtual adversarial perturbations. GraphVAT : it proposes a dynamic regularization technique based on virtual AT, to smooth the output and learn a robust GNN over adversarial examples. LAT : it proposes to employ AT on the first latent representation of GNNs and make GNNs more robust against adversarial perturbations. Jaccard : since attackers tend to connect nodes with large differences to achieve a better attack effect, it uses Jaccard similarity to preprocess the graph and filter out edges between nodes with low feature similarity. SVD [ref]27: it adopts a truncated SVD to form a low-rank approximation of graph adjacency matrix to alleviate the adversarial behaviors. SVD is similar to our method, but it does not incorporate adversarial training into the learning phase. SimPGCN : it is an improved GNN with a feature similarity preserving aggregation, which effectively preserves node similarity while exploiting graph structure. MedianGCN : it is a state-of-the-art defense method, adopting median as the aggregation function of GNNs to enhance their robustness.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: (ii) BVAT, GraphVAT, and LAT from feature-based AT methods; (iii) Jaccard and SVD from adversarial purification methods and (iv) SimPGCN and MedianGCN from methods with robust architectures.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
