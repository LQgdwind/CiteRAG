      "content": "Paper Title: On the link between generative semi-supervised learning and generative open-set recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOpen-set recognition (OSR) is the research field that studies classification with simultaneous novelty detection. More specifically, OSR classifiers must accurately categorise samples that belong to K>1𝐾1K>1 number of labelled categories and simultaneously separate samples that belong to any number of novel categories into an additional K+1𝐾1K+1’th category. Novel categories are formally defined as groups of anomalous samples with similar patterns that do not match any of the labelled categories . Within OSR, novel categories are further described as those that are unobserved during training but appear during testing  . In other words, OSR ensures classifiers can handle changing environments wherein new patterns emerge over time . With regards to the training policy, OSR studies generally use supervised learning wherein the training set, 𝒟lab-trainsubscript𝒟lab-train\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{lab-train}}, contains sample pairs, (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y), where x𝑥x is the input sample and y𝑦y is the output category label. After training, an independent testing set, 𝒟testsubscript𝒟test\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{test}}, is used to determine the performance of the classifier, wherein the novel categories could lie. Testing sets also consist of sample pairs, (x,ya)𝑥subscript𝑦𝑎(x,y_{a}). However, considering that the classifier cannot access the testing labels, these are defined as anticipated labels, yasubscript𝑦𝑎y_{a}, which are used to determine classifier performance. It is important to state that the testing sets should mimic real-world scenarios as closely as possible to ensure credible performance measurements. Let the set CK:={1,2,…,K}assignsubscript𝐶𝐾12…𝐾C_{K}:=\\{1,2,...,K\\} represent all labelled categories, with all entries in CKsubscript𝐶𝐾C_{K} representing the category labels. Within conventional supervised learning, all training and testing samples belong to one of the categories in CKsubscript𝐶𝐾C_{K}. In other words, all (y∼𝒟lab-train)∈CKsimilar-to𝑦subscript𝒟lab-trainsubscript𝐶𝐾(y\\sim\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{lab-train}})\\in C_{K} and all (ya∼𝒟test)∈CKsimilar-tosubscript𝑦𝑎subscript𝒟testsubscript𝐶𝐾(y_{a}\\sim\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{test}})\\in C_{K}. To extend supervised learning to OSR, samples from novel categories are inserted into the testing set. Let the K+1𝐾1K+1’th category be defined as the augmented unknown category, meaning it is an encapsulating category representing any and all unobserved novel categories. Then, the OSR regime would have all (y∼𝒟lab-train)∈CKsimilar-to𝑦subscript𝒟lab-trainsubscript𝐶𝐾(y\\sim\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{lab-train}})\\in C_{K} and all (ya∼𝒟test)∈(CK∪{K+1})similar-tosubscript𝑦𝑎subscript𝒟testsubscript𝐶𝐾𝐾1(y_{a}\\sim\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{test}})\\in(C_{K}\\cup\\{K+1\\}). In other words, beyond generalising the K𝐾K labelled categories, OSR classifiers must generalise the K+1𝐾1K+1’th augmented unknown category, noting that this category does not have any training samples. Supervised learning requires many labelled training samples to train classifiers, making it costly in real-world applications. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) proposes a more cost-efficient solution by training classifiers using a small labelled and a large unlabelled training set, |𝒟lab-train|<<|𝒟unlab-train|much-less-thansubscript𝒟lab-trainsubscript𝒟unlab-train|\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{lab-train}}|<<|\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{unlab-train}}| . Similar to the test set, the classifier cannot access the labels in 𝒟unlab-trainsubscript𝒟unlab-train\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{unlab-train}}, and so these labels are also represented as anticipated labels, yasubscript𝑦𝑎y_{a}. We also focus on the inductive SSL setting, where the testing set is again independent of the training set. Conventional SSL relies on the cluster assumption, meaning we assume that all unlabelled training samples belong to one of the labelled categories - i.e. all (ya∼𝒟unlab-train)∈CKsimilar-tosubscript𝑦𝑎subscript𝒟unlab-trainsubscript𝐶𝐾(y_{a}\\sim\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{unlab-train}})\\in C_{K}. Furthermore, conventional SSL assumes that all (ya∼𝒟test)∈CKsimilar-tosubscript𝑦𝑎subscript𝒟testsubscript𝐶𝐾(y_{a}\\sim\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{test}})\\in C_{K}, meaning there are no novel categories included in this learning policy. Similar to supervised learning, we can extend SSL to OSR by simply including novel categories in the test set - i.e. all (ya∼𝒟test)∈(CK∪{K+1})similar-tosubscript𝑦𝑎subscript𝒟testsubscript𝐶𝐾𝐾1(y_{a}\\sim\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{test}})\\in(C_{K}\\cup\\{K+1\\}). This so-called SSL-OSR setting is the primary focus of this study. However, it is essential to note that as soon as we enter the realm of SSL, novel categories could also exist in 𝒟unlab-trainsubscript𝒟unlab-train\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{unlab-train}}. SSL-OSR assumes that novel categories only appear during testing. However, so-called observed novel categories have become more prevalent within SSL based research  . Specifically, given the immense cost to label every category big data domains, recent studies have focused on the setting where observed novel categories are scattered in 𝒟unlab-trainsubscript𝒟unlab-train\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{unlab-train}}. This research field is called learning with augmented category by exploiting unlabelled data (LACU) . In this policy, the K+1𝐾1K+1’th category is defined as a background augmented category to encapsulate all observed novel categories. It is important to note that LACU and OSR have contrasting definitions for the K+1𝐾1K+1’th category since LACU considers observed novel categories and OSR considers unobserved ones. Although LACU represents an important SSL setting, this study only focuses on linking conventional SSL and OSR, meaning we assume that there are no novel categories seen in 𝒟unlab-trainsubscript𝒟unlab-train\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{unlab-train}}. Furthermore, our K+1𝐾1K+1’th category is the augmented unknown category, as per the definition of OSR. GANs have been extensively used for conventional SSL . Initially, SSL-GANs transformed the discriminator to distinguish between real and fake samples and simultaneously classify any real samples into its corresponding labelled category    . However, state-of-the-art models now prefer a three-network game, wherein the discriminator remains unchanged to the original GAN and a separate classifier is added to the mix  . Of all SSL-GANs, the bad-GAN by Dai et al.  is especially noteworthy, as Dai theoretically and experimentally showed that good SSL-GANs should generate ’bad-looking’ samples that lie in the complementary space. More specifically, Dai showed that regulating an SSL classifier using generated samples that lie in the complementary space (see Fig. 2(a)), then the classifier is forced to tighten the boundaries in the embedding space of labelled categories for improved generalisation. Bad-GANs are particularly interesting since OSR studies have used the same notion of bad-looking samples [ref]40. Before exploring OSR-GANs, it is essential to consider the use of GANs for conventional novelty detection - i.e. without multi-category classification. Conventional novelty detection is a one-class classification problem that distinguishes between unobserved novel categories from a single positive labelled category that represents the entire training domain . The discriminator networks in GANs have been widely studied in this context   . More specifically, because the discriminator is tasked to separate fake-generated samples from all training samples, the discriminator can be considered a novelty detector if fake-generated samples represent in the open domain. However, the equilibrium theory of GANs suggests that a trained discriminator won’t be able to determine whether an input sample is real or fake . Therefore, unique adjustments are required to use a discriminator as a novelty detector. This study focuses on OSR, which extends novelty detection to also classify multiple labelled categories. Nevertheless, the underlying theory between OSR and novelty detection remains the same. A standard method to ensure that the discriminator/classifier can determine whether a sample is from the training domain or not is to design the generator to produce bad-looking samples   [ref]29 [ref]22 . Although multiple definitions have been proposed for these bad-looking samples, we argue that all definitions really rely on the SSL theory of the complementary space. Examples of such OSR-GANs include the counterfactual (counter)-GAN by Neal et al. [ref]29, which combines an auto-encoder and a GAN to generate counterfactual (or bad-looking) images that belong to one category but is pulled towards another. In contrast, Jo et al. [ref]22 use a feature-matching (FM)-GAN and a denoising auto-encoder to generate samples that are corrupted with the noisy distribution of the feature space of the classifier. Finally, the recent adversarial reciprocal point learning GAN (ARP-GAN) proposed by Chen et al. also uses bad-looking samples that match reciprocal points . We note that ARP-GANs significantly outperformed all other OSR-GANs, and will be discussed in detail in the upcoming section. Although SSL-GANs and OSR-GANs theorise better generalisation and results given bad-looking generated samples, these methods have not yet been compared within research. Our hypothesis states that the notion of bad-looking samples in either the SSL or the OSR context represents samples that fall within the complementary space. In other words, counterfactual samples [ref]29, samples modelled with noisy distributions [ref]22, and samples based on reciprocal points , all allow classifiers to generalise the open space for the same reasons SSL models perform better when generalising the complementary space. That is, regularising a classifying network with samples in the complementary space inherently generalises the open space within the classifying network. With this hypothesis, an SSL-GAN would be capable at OSR, and an OSR-GAN would also be capable at SSL. Furthermore, all these models could be used for the combined task of SSL-OSR. Finally, it is important to note several studies that also focused on the combined task of SSL-OSR. Capazzo et al.  used traditional machine-learning techniques to address label noise under the SSL-OSR setting. However, these traditional techniques are unsuitable for high-dimensional data, and so these methods cannot be used for image classification. Another attempt at SSL-OSR is in the unpublished study by Kliger et al. , who also applied GANs in this context. However, their proposed method and results were unclear, and no theoretical link was made between SSL-GANs and OSR-GANs. Finally, the most similar study to ours is the study by Sung et al. [ref]40. Sung applied manually chosen operations to the training data to create bad-looking samples. Subsequently, FM-GANs were used to generate samples that matched fell between pseudo-data and the real-data which were used to regularise either a SSL or OSR classifying network. However, Sung did not justify the choice of operations to create the pseudo-data (i.e. no theoretical framework was developed for bad-looking samples), while Sung experimented on SSL and OSR independently without linking the two. In this study, we theoretically and experimentally link SSL with OSR under the unified framework of highly parameterised GANs.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: the boundaries in the embedding space of labelled categories for improved generalisation.
