      "content": "Paper Title: Creativity in the era of artificial intelligence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs we aim to reason on conceptual objects, understanding creativity requires first the ability to precisely define it. However, the concept of creativity appears to be particularly multi-faceted and complex to define. As is usually the case with such highly abstract concepts, decades of debates have first focused on carving out its uniqueness by delineating it from closely-related concepts such as originality, genius, imagination and talent . In the collective subconscious, the core aspect of creativity lies in novelty. In that sense, creativity involves moving across our preconceived knowledge and creating a schism between the present and the future . Through this first lens, creativity seems to put a strain on our relationship with the future, as it introduces uncertainty. Embracing creativity implies a hazardous leap forward that might upset the balance of our pattern-seeking habits, as it is impossible to fully understand the consequences of an entirely novel concept or object [ref]41. However, we might take comfort in the fact that this uncertainty is not boundless, as creativity (and art alike) does not arise from a conceptual void . Even though creativity lives in the realms of the least predictable concepts, it remains first and foremost a contextually-embedded phenomenon  Indeed, creativity involves social aspects, as it implicates individuals in a context, working with a set of existing patterns of meanings and symbols at a given time in history . The significance and relevance of creative ideas is not solely observed in their content, but within the social framework and historical period at which these ideas are produced. Ideas appear relevant only when a group of persons articulate their thoughts around the same set of questions , and a critical mass of knowledge develops in one place. Hence, creativity offers variation and depends equally on the properties of the environment as on its own quality . Conversely, what was deemed revolutionary and obtained widespread acclaim at one point will gradually be integrated as an impending norm of the era, slowly becoming mundane in the society and domain it operates . An emblematic example in the musical realm is that of musical synthesizers . When they appeared, audio synthesizers remained for long confined to the fringe of contemporary and experimental music, producing unheard sounds that were too unsettling to be deemed musical yet. It is only through a gradual evolution period that these sounds emerged across almost all musical genres, which now commonly integrate different levels of audio synthesis. In that sense, creativity is a transformative process, adapting and integrating elements to a domain with predefined norms, steadily shifting and adapting these norms . In summary, although creativity is complex and multi-faceted, it can be articulated around three major components of novelty (creative ideas are innovative), quality (appeal of the idea) and relevance (the idea is appropriate to the task and era) . Hence, studying creativity requires to consider a large number of nuances, which are themselves mostly subjective and renders the analysis of creativity as a set of empirically testable hypotheses rather tedious. This might explain why the empirical study of creativity is only at a very precocious stage.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: implies a hazardous leap forward that might upset the balance of our pattern-seeking habits, as it is impossible to fully understand the consequences of an entirely novel concept or object [ref]41.
