      "content": "Paper Title: SHA-256 Collision Attack with Programmatic SAT\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBoolean satisfiability (SAT) solving involves searching for a solution of a\nBoolean formula (an assignment of the variables that makes the formula true).\nThe tools designed for this\npurpose are called SAT solvers.\nEven though all\nknown algorithms for SAT solving run in exponential time in the worst case, in\npractice many problems can be solved by modern SAT solvers in a reasonable\namount of time. In fact, SAT solvers are so effective that in practice there are\nproblems unrelated to logic that are most effectively solved by reducing them to\nSAT and calling a SAT solver.\n The beauty of SAT solving lies in its generic nature, which means that it can be\napplied to any domain as long as the problem can be encoded into a Boolean\nformula. This also allows solvers to be tuned for performance independently of a\nspecific problem. Modern SAT solvers can be surprisingly effective at solving\nSAT problems by incorporating sophisticated techniques like conflict analysis and clause learning,\nclever branching heuristics, and simplification .\nThis combination allows them to be highly\npotent at general-purpose search. SAT solving, ever since its inception, has been found to be useful for\nsatisfiability checking—determining whether a logical formula is satisfiable.\nOn the other side, Computer Algebra Systems (CASs) include algorithms that are\nefficient at solving mathematical problems. However, many problems exist that\ninvolves both satisfiability checking and symbolic computation, and bridging the\ntwo fields was proposed in 2015 in the work of Ábrahám  and\nZulkoski et al. . Shortly afterwards, the SC2superscriptSC2\\text{SC}^{2}\nproject  was initiated to support the joint community.\nSince then, a wide variety of problems have been tackled using SC2\ntechniques, from circuit verification  to knot\ntheory  to quantifier elimination and cylindrical algebraic\ndecomposition [ref]23, and factoring integers with known bits [ref]24.\nSee England’s survey  for an\noverview of many other examples. Programmatic SAT involves injecting code into the solver to aid the solver and\nsolve a problem more efficiently than it otherwise could . It’s\nuseful especially when aspects of the problem are difficult to express in\nconjunctive normal form, the typical input of SAT\nsolvers . Programmatic SAT is usually domain-specific and combines the powerful techniques\nof search possessed by SAT solvers with the most efficient high-level algorithms\nand analysis tools for the problem. Some modern SAT solvers can be customized\nin a programmatic way through built-in interfaces like\nIPASIR-UP . The solver may be aided through the\nfollowing ways during search: External propagation: Assigning variables derived through\nhigh-level deduction. External decisions: Making decisions on picking important\nunassigned variables and guessing their values through high-level analysis. External learning: Injecting learned clauses during conflicts\ndetected through the high-level conflict analysis.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: community.\nSince then, a wide variety of problems have been tackled using SC2\ntechniques, from circuit verification  to knot\ntheory  to quantifier elimination and cylindrical algebraic\ndecomposition [ref]23, and factoring integers with known bits [ref]24.\nSee England’s survey  for an\noverview of many other examples.
