      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUtilizing the closed-form solution of optimal transport in one dimension , the sliced Wasserstein  (SW) distance is computationally and statistically scalable. In particular, SW has the time complexity of 𝒪​(n​log⁡n)𝒪𝑛𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n) and the space complexity of 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n) when dealing with two probability measures that have at most n𝑛n supports. Moreover, the SW does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality since it has sample complexity of 𝒪​(n−1/2)𝒪superscript𝑛12\\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2}) [ref]27 . As evidence for the effectiveness of the SW distance, many applications have leveraged SW as the key to improving performance e.g., generative models , domain adaptation , point-cloud upsampling , clustering , gradient flows [ref]5, and so on. A key component of the SW is the slicing distribution, i.e., the distribution of the projecting direction. The slicing distribution controls the contribution of each projecting direction to the final value of the SW. A statistically desired slicing distribution should satisfy two properties. The first property is to assign a high probability to “informative\" projecting directions. In some applications that involve weak convergence of measures, such as generative modeling  and gradient flow [ref]5, an informative direction can be interpreted as a discriminative direction that highlights the difference between two measures after projection. The second property is to have the maximal projecting direction in the support set, i.e., the projecting direction that can lead to the maximum projected distance. This property ensures the identity of indiscernible of the expected value. To ensure the second property, a more relaxed criterion can be considered, which involves having a continuous density on the unit-hypersphere. Beyond statistical properties, two computational properties are desired for the slicing distribution. Firstly, the slicing distribution should be stable to obtain, meaning that parameters of the slicing distribution can be computationally identifiable. Secondly, it should be fast and efficient to sample projecting directions from the slicing distribution. This property is essential, as Monte Carlo samples are used to approximate the intractable expectation with respect to the slicing distribution. The conventional SW  utilizes the uniform distribution over the unit-hypersphere as the slicing distribution, which is a fixed, continuous, and easy-to-sample distribution. However, the uniform slicing distribution is not discriminative. Distributional sliced Wasserstein [ref]31 (DSW) performs optimization to find the best slicing distribution belonging to a chosen family of distributions over the unit-hypersphere, aiming to maximize the expected projected distance. When the family is a collection of Dirac measures, DSW reverts to max sliced Wasserstein  (Max-SW). DSW and Max-SW are discriminative, but they are not stable, computationally expensive, and require a differentiable ground metric. This is because they involve iterative gradient-based optimization, which may not guarantee a global optimum. Energy-based sliced Wasserstein  (EBSW) utilizes the energy-based slicing distribution, which has a density proportional to an increasing function of the projected distance. The energy-based slicing distribution is continuous, optimization-free, and discriminative. However, it requires more sophisticated sampling techniques to obtain projecting directions, such as importance sampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), due to the unnormalized density. Moreover, these sampling techniques lead to biased weighted estimates. To design an effective slicing distribution, the key is to relate the continuous slicing distribution with the two input measures. This connection can be achieved through optimization, as demonstrated in DSW [ref]31, or by directly defining the slicing distribution based on the two input measures, as seen in EBSW . Designing an efficient slicing distribution poses a more challenging task. Interactive procedures, such as optimization (as in DSW) and sequential sampling (as in EBSW with MCMC), should be avoided. The ideal scenario is to have a slicing distribution that allows for i.i.d. sampling, making it parallelizable. Using a proposal distribution, importance sampling in EBSW could yield a fast estimate. However, importance sampling requires a careful choice of the proposal distribution for accurate estimation, especially in high dimensions. Additionally, importance sampling leads to biased estimates in the case of unnormalized densities. To address the challenge, we propose a novel, effective, and efficient slicing distribution obtained based on a new notation of projecting direction, named random-path projecting direction (RPD). The idea is to first create a ‘path’ between two input measures, then project the two measures along that path and conduct the one-dimensional Wasserstein comparison. Here, a path is defined as the normalized difference between two random variables that are distributed with two input measures, respectively, with an additional random perturbation for continuity guarantee. Since the path is defined as the random difference, it captures the directions in which the two measures differ. Therefore, using the distribution of the random-paths can lead to a discriminative slicing distribution. In addition, sampling a random path is efficient since it only requires the mild assumption that two input measures are easy to sample from, a condition usually held in machine learning applications. Contribution. In summary, our contributions are three-fold: 1. We propose a new type of projecting direction, named random-path projecting direction (RPD), which involves a random perturbation of the normalized difference between two random variables distributed under two input measures. From the RPD, we derive the random-path slicing distribution (RPSD), which is guaranteed to be continuous. Despite having intractable density, the RPSD is fast and simple to sample random projecting directions. 2. From the RPSD, we introduce two novel variants of sliced Wasserstein. The first variant is called random-path projection sliced Wasserstein (RPSW), which replaces the uniform distribution in SW with the RPSD. The second variant is importance-weighted random-path projection sliced Wasserstein (IWRPSW). It is defined as an expectation of a weighted average of multiple randomly projected distances with RPDs. We then establish theoretical properties of RPSW and IWRPSW, encompassing topological, statistical, and computational aspects. In greater detail, we delve into the metricity of RPSW and IWRPSW, their connections to other SW variants, their sample complexity, and their computational complexities using Monte Carlo methods. 3. We conduct a comparative analysis of the proposed RPSW and IWRPSW against existing SW variants, including SW, Max-SW, DSW, and EBSW. Our first application involves gradient flow, where distances are utilized to guide a source distribution towards a target distribution. Furthermore, we introduce a new framework for training denoising diffusion models using SW metrics through the augmented generalized mini-batch energy (AGME) distance. In this framework, SW variants serve as the kernel to assess the difference between two random sets. Here, AGME functions as the loss function, aiming to minimize the difference between forward transition distributions and their corresponding reverse transition distributions in denoising diffusion models. In addition to serving as a benchmark for comparing SW variants, our proposed training approach can improve generative quality and sampling speed. Organization. We begin by reviewing some preliminaries in Section 2. Following that, in Section 3, we define the random-path projection direction, the random-path slicing distribution, RPSW, and IWRPSW. We then derive their theoretical and computational properties. Section 4 presents experiments comparing RPSW and IWRPSW with other SW variants. In Section 5, we provide concluding remarks. Finally, we defer the proofs of key results and additional materials to the Appendices. Notations.
