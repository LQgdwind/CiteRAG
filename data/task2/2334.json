Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: ADVANCING CTC-CRF BASED END-TO-END SPEECH RECOGNITION WITH WORDPIECES AND CONFORMERS\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA basic problem for acoustic modeling is the choice of modeling units. Conventionally, ASR systems (i.e. GMM-HMM , DNN-HMM [ref]14 etc.) heavily rely upon phonetic knowledge. These systems usually adopt phone as modeling units, where AM labels come from word-level transcripts using an expert-curated pronunciation lexicon. For languages like English with a low degree of grapheme-phoneme correspondence, it has been shown that a highly optimized pronunciation lexicon could achieve fairly well results so far [ref]15 [ref]16 . Despite the promising results of phone-based ASR systems, creating expert-curated pronunciation lexicon is time-consuming. Thus, another direction for AM modeling units is to replace phone with grapheme to eliminate the need of lexicon construction. Early explorations on grapheme-based modeling units have shown that these systems usually perform worse than phone-based systems , while grapheme-based systems could achieve results as well as phone-based systems for languages with high degree of grapheme-phoneme correspondence . Grapheme-based systems are not better than phone-based systems in English, until taking the context into account . Recently, grapheme-based units like BPE  or wordpiece , which originate from the task of Neural Machine Translation (NMT), have been broadly applied to ASR systems, including the hybrid  and E2E  systems.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: A basic problem for acoustic modeling is the choice of modeling units.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
