      "content": "Paper Title: PAC: Assisted Value Factorisation with Counterfactual Predictions in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo overcome the limitations of existing Value Decomposition methods discussed in Sec. 3, in this section, we introduce the idea of assisted optimal joint policy factorization and propose such a method under the multi-agent soft actor-critic framework. Framework overview.\nFig. 2 shows the architecture of the learning framework. There are three main components in PAC : (1) a weighted Qt​o​tsuperscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡Q^{tot} utilizing per-agent local critics qi​(ui,τi,mi)subscript𝑞𝑖subscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝜏𝑖subscript𝑚𝑖q_{i}(u_{i},\\tau_{i},m_{i}), where misubscript𝑚𝑖m_{i} serves as assistive information aiding value factorization, (2) an unrestricted joint action estimator Q^∗superscript^𝑄\\hat{Q}^{*}, which serves as a baseline estimator of Q∗superscript𝑄Q^{*} and allows the computation of counterfactual predictions from a quick local search, and (3) an assisted information generating module, which is able to utilize the deep variational bottleneck method to encode the counterfactual optimal joint action selection. In addition to TD errors for Qt​o​tsubscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡Q_{tot} and Q∗superscript𝑄Q^{*}, the PAC system is trained using three more loss functions: counterfactual assistance loss LC​Asubscript𝐿𝐶𝐴L_{CA} for optimized value function factorization, information bottleneck loss LL​Bsubscript𝐿𝐿𝐵L_{LB} for succinct and effective assistive information generation, and local policy loss LL​Psubscript𝐿𝐿𝑃L_{LP} for training factorized agent policy with entropy maximization. Generating Counterfactual Predictions\nOne of the key insights underlying this method is that the optimal joint action selection u∗superscript𝑢{u}^{*} from the centralized Q^∗superscript^𝑄\\hat{Q}^{*} can be used as a direct information assisting Qt​o​tsubscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡Q_{tot} explicitly. Although the complexity of computing u∗=argmaxu​𝔼​[Q∗​(s,τ,⋅)]superscriptusubscriptargmax𝑢𝔼delimited-[]superscript𝑄𝑠𝜏⋅\\textbf{u}^{*}=\\textrm{argmax}_{u}\\mathbb{E}[Q^{*}(s,\\tau,\\cdot)] is impractical as it grows in O​(|U|n)𝑂superscript𝑈𝑛O(|U|^{n}), however, it is possible to compute a local estimation of u^∗superscript^u\\hat{\\textbf{u}}^{*} as u^i∗=argmax⁡Q^∗​(s,𝝉,𝒖−𝒊,⋅)subscriptsuperscript^𝑢𝑖argmaxsuperscript^𝑄𝑠𝝉subscript𝒖𝒊⋅\\hat{u}^{*}_{i}=\\operatorname{argmax}\\hat{Q}^{*}(s,\\boldsymbol{\\tau},\\boldsymbol{u_{-i}},\\cdot), which reduces the computational complexity from exponential to linear level of O​(n⋅|U|)𝑂⋅𝑛𝑈O(n\\cdot|U|). However, even with u∗superscriptu\\textbf{u}^{*} provided, in what manner it can benefit value function factorization is not researched. Directly feeding this to the policy or critic network is counterproductive as\nthe neural network can easily learn that this specific input is the key to reducing the TD-error\nwhile it is not helpful to explore or train the local policy and the training process might stall. Using an extra loss function, e.g. cross-entropy, as an effort to train the network to make decisions u𝑢u that are close to u∗superscriptu\\textbf{u}^{*} sounds promising, however, it only quantifies the error without actually guiding the training since it may trap the policy in local sub-optimum and further limits the exploration process. Inspired by difference rewards  and counterfactual baseline  for policy gradients, we propose a counterfactual assistance loss. For each agent a𝑎a we can use an advantage function that compares the u^∗superscript^𝑢\\hat{u}^{*} from Q∗superscript𝑄Q^{*} and u𝑢u from Qt​o​tsuperscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡Q^{tot} to a counterfactual baseline that marginalizes out the agent’s potential optimal action which relegates u^a∗subscriptsuperscript^𝑢𝑎\\hat{u}^{*}_{a}, while keeping all other agents’ action 𝒖−asuperscript𝒖𝑎\\boldsymbol{u}^{-a} fixed, a counterfactual assistance loss is proposed as: This looks similar to calculating the counterfactual advantage as used in COMA, however, in COMA such counterfactual advantage is calculated for centralized critic which is computationally expensive and unstable which limits its performance, while our counterfactual assistance loss is providing direct guidance in training the policy network towards the direction of ui∗superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑖u_{i}^{*}. We later show in ablation studies that this loss is contributing to the performance improvements. Generating Assistive Information \nAdditionally, we show 𝒖^∗superscriptbold-^𝒖\\boldsymbol{\\hat{u}^{*}} can be encoded and then used as input for local critics qi​(ui,τi,mi)subscript𝑞𝑖subscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝜏𝑖subscript𝑚𝑖q_{i}(u_{i},\\tau_{i},m_{i}), as assistive information aiding value factorization. As previous works suggests [ref]11 , we consider the information bottleneck method , with the Markov chain o-m-u^∗superscript^u{\\hat{\\textbf{u}}}^{*} during encoding. To be specific, we regard the internal representation of the intermediate layer as stochastic encoding misubscript𝑚𝑖m_{i} of input source oisubscript𝑜𝑖o_{i}, with the goal to learn an encoding that is maximally informative about the result u^i∗superscriptsubscript^𝑢𝑖\\hat{u}_{i}^{*}.\nFormally, the objective for each agent i𝑖i can be written as: misubscript𝑚𝑖m_{i} is an instance of random variable of assitive information that is drawn from multivariate Gaussian distribution 𝑵(fm(oi;θm),𝑰))\\boldsymbol{N}(f_{m}(o_{i};\\theta_{m}),\\boldsymbol{I})), θmsubscript𝜃𝑚\\theta_{m} is the parameters of encoder fmsubscript𝑓𝑚f_{m} and 𝑰𝑰\\boldsymbol{I} is an identity matrix, a Lagrange multiplier parameter β≥𝛽absent\\beta\\geq 0 is used to control the trade-off between the encoding the necessary information and reaching maximal compression. Yet this does not lead to a learnable model, since this mutual information I𝐼I is intractable. With the help of variational approximation, specifically, deep variational information bottleneck , we are able to parameterize this model using a neural network. We then derive and optimize a variational lower bound of such objective as where ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} is the entropy operator, DKLsubscript𝐷KLD_{\\mathrm{KL}} denotes Kullback-Leibler divergence operator and qϕ​(mi)subscript𝑞italic-ϕsubscript𝑚𝑖q_{\\phi}(m_{i}) is a variational posterior estimator of p​(mi)𝑝subscript𝑚𝑖p(m_{i}) with parameters ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi.\nUsing the loss above a message encoder fmsubscript𝑓𝑚f_{m} with parameters θmsubscript𝜃𝑚\\theta_{m} is trained to generate information mi∼𝑵(fm(oi;θm),𝑰))m_{i}\\sim\\boldsymbol{N}(f_{m}(o_{i};\\theta_{m}),\\boldsymbol{I})) that is useful for decision making.\nCompared to [ref]11  that encodes the general state information and other agents’ action selections as communication messages, which can not reduce the uncertainties in action-value functions; using the encoded u^∗superscript^𝑢\\hat{u}^{*} as assistance information can provide an explicit direction toward better individual value estimation and thus a joint value factorization. Detailed derivations and proofs can be found in Appendix A.1. Factorized Policy Iteration with Entropy Maximization\nWe leverage factorized policies to maintain decentralized execution in PAC despite the use of assistive information for training. Recent works have shown that Boltzmann exploration policy iteration is guaranteed to improve the policy and converge to optimal with unlimited iterations and full policy evaluation, within MARL domain it can be defined as:\nJ(π)=∑t𝔼[r(𝐬t,𝐮t)+αℋ(π(⋅|𝐬t))]J(\\pi)=\\sum_{t}\\mathbb{E}\\left[r\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{t},\\mathbf{u}_{t}\\right)+\\alpha\\mathcal{H}\\left(\\pi\\left(\\cdot|\\mathbf{s}_{t}\\right)\\right)\\right]\nwhere α𝛼\\alpha denotes the temperature parameter that is used to adjust the balance between maximizing the entropy for a better exploration and maximizing the expected reward.\nWe present one possible method of expanding this to MARL problems, to achieve decentralized policies in PAC and to encourage efficient exploration. Several recent works are proposed to expand actor-critic or soft-actor-critic in to factorization based MARL methods [ref]13  , they all follow a centralized critic with decentralized actors (CCDA) framework. In this work, we train the actors in a centralized but factorized way. Unlike  that reuses the local utility network for both actor or critic or [ref]13 which consists of a soft V-network and a soft Q-network for local policy net,\nwe use a separate network as policy networks and propose a centralized but factorized soft policy iteration with factorized Maximum-Entropy trained as: where qm​i​xsuperscript𝑞𝑚𝑖𝑥q^{mix} is the monotonic value decomposition network with ui∼πi​(oi)similar-tosubscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝜋𝑖subscript𝑜𝑖u_{i}\\sim\\pi_{i}(o_{i}) and 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} is the replay buffer used to sample training data. As noted in previous research, choosing the temperature term in soft-actor-critic is non-trivial as it can vary in an unpredictable way when the policy becomes better as the training continues [ref]13. Instead of finding each individual temperature using approximation functions, since we use a centralized but factored policy, we consider one global temperature that is automatically adjusted by considering it as a constrained optimization problem as a parameter that is trained independently with loss: where ℋ0subscriptℋ0\\mathcal{H}_{0} is a fixed entropy term so the temperature term α𝛼\\alpha is\ngenerally decreasing such that the degree of exploration is reduced as the training proceeds. Training Process\nSo far we have discussed the components of our method, to formulate the new scalable RL algorithm, we now explain the implementation and the centralized training process for deep RL under DEC-POMDP. In the decentralized execution phase, only the policy (agent) network (marked as local policy in Fig.1 ) is enabled so that full CTDE is maintained. Despite that monotonicity constraints limitations to the expressive power of the mixing network, recent research   demonstrated that the IGM principle [ref]5 as equivalent to joint greed actions and individual greedy actions is crucial, as it greatly promotes the sample efficiency; meanwhile most designs with only one unrestricted joint action-value function show poor empirical performance[ref]5 , and thus we follow the design of WQMIX and keep both Qt​o​tsubscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡Q_{tot} network and Q^∗superscript^𝑄\\hat{Q}^{*} network. The Q^∗superscript^𝑄\\hat{Q}^{*} architecture (Green part in Fig. 1) is used as the estimator for Q∗superscript𝑄{Q}^{*} from unrestricted functions, where its mixing network is a feed-forward network that takes its local utilities.\nWhile the Qt​o​tsubscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡Q_{tot} module (blue part in Fig.1) looks similar to QMIX and many other factorized methods, there is a significant difference, for its local estimator is provided with assistive information and the local value feeding to the network q​(u,τi,mi)𝑞𝑢subscript𝜏𝑖subscript𝑚𝑖q({u},\\tau_{i},m_{i}) is selected based on local policy, rather than taking\nargmax⁡qi​(⋅,τi,mi)argmaxsubscript𝑞𝑖⋅subscript𝜏𝑖subscript𝑚𝑖\\operatorname{argmax}{q}_{i}(\\cdot,{\\tau}_{i},m_{i}). Then Qt​o​tsubscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡Q_{tot} and Q∗superscript𝑄{Q}^{*} are trained with the objective to reduce their respective loss as: where u^i=argmax⁡qi​(⋅,τi,mi)subscript^𝑢𝑖argmaxsubscript𝑞𝑖⋅subscript𝜏𝑖subscript𝑚𝑖\\hat{u}_{i}=\\operatorname{argmax}{q}_{i}(\\cdot,{\\tau}_{i},m_{i}), yi=r+γ​Q^∗​(s′,𝝉′,argmax𝐮^′⁡Qt​o​t​(𝝉′,𝐮^′,s′;𝜽))subscript𝑦𝑖𝑟𝛾superscript^𝑄superscript𝑠′superscript𝝉′subscriptargmaxsuperscript^𝐮′subscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡superscript𝝉′superscript^𝐮′superscript𝑠′𝜽y_{i}=r+\\gamma\\hat{Q}^{*}(s^{\\prime},\\boldsymbol{\\tau}^{\\prime},\\operatorname{argmax}_{\\mathbf{\\hat{u}}^{\\prime}}Q_{tot}(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}^{\\prime},\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}^{\\prime},s^{\\prime};\\boldsymbol{\\theta})) with 𝜽−superscript𝜽\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{-}\\  being the parameters of the target network that are periodically updated to stabilize the training. ui∼πi​(oi)similar-tosubscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝜋𝑖subscript𝑜𝑖u_{i}\\sim\\pi_{i}(o_{i}) and w​(s,u)𝑤𝑠uw(s,\\textbf{u}) is the weighting function111In this work we follow the weighting function design of OW-QMIX in WQMIX , as w = 1 if Qt​o​t​(s,𝝉,u,𝒎)−yisubscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑠𝝉u𝒎subscript𝑦𝑖Q_{tot}(s,\\boldsymbol{\\tau},\\textbf{u},\\boldsymbol{m})-y_{i} ¡0, w = α𝛼\\alpha otherwise. to ensure the weighted projection can recover the correct maximal joint action value function for any Q. Note the action selection for loss function in our method is different from the original design of QMIX and WQMIX. Apart from the independently updated entropy term α𝛼\\alpha, all other components (including the message encoder) are trained in an end-to-end manner with the objective to minimize the weighted sum of all losses proposed above, including the counterfactual loss and information bottleneck loss as Detailed derivations can be found in Appendix A.1\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: used as input for local critics qi​(ui,τi,mi)subscript𝑞𝑖subscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝜏𝑖subscript𝑚𝑖q_{i}(u_{i},\\tau_{i},m_{i}), as assistive information aiding value factorization.
