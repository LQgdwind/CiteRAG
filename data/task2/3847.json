Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: AlphaZero-Inspired Game Learning: Faster Training by Using MCTS Only at Test Time\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nN-tuple networks, which are an important building block of our approach, have shown to work well in many games, e. g., in ConnectFour  [ref]22, Othello , EinStein würfelt nicht (EWN) 0, 2048 [ref]6, SZ-Tetris 1, etc.\nOther function approximation networks (DNN or other) could be used as well in AlphaZero-inspired RL, but n-tuple networks have the advantage that they can be trained very fast on off-the-shelf hardware. There are two papers in the game learning literature that combine n-tuple networks with MCTS:\nSironi et al. 2 use the n-tuple bandit EA to automatically tune a self-adaptive MCTS. This is an interesting approach but for a completely different goal and not related to AlphaZero. Chu et al. 0 use an n-tuple network as a guidance for MCTS in the game EWN. They train an n-tuple network via Monte-Carlo RL and incorporate the trained heuristic with three different approaches into MCTS. Monte Carlo is a special form of temporal difference (TD) learning, namely TD(1). To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to couple n-tuple networks with MCTS using TD(λ𝜆\\lambda)-training with arbitrary λ𝜆\\lambda. Neither Chu et al. 0 nor we use MCTS in the training loop for the main results. However, we compare in Sec. IV-E – at least for some viable settings – MCTS within and outside of self-play training. Finally, we use our approach for other games than those studied in 0.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: N-tuple networks, which are an important building block of our approach, have shown to work well in many games, e. g., in ConnectFour  [ref]22, Othello , EinStein würfelt nicht (EWN) 0, 2048 [ref]6, SZ-Tetris 1, etc.\nOther function approximation networks (DNN or other) could be used as well in AlphaZero-inspired RL, but n-tuple\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
