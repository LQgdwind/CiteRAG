      "content": "Paper Title: Extending Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Neural Networks with Differentiable Contact Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this work, we have introduced a differentiable contact model, which can capture contact dynamics with different properties. Our contact model extends the applicability of Lagrangian/Hamiltonian-inspired neural networks to enable the learning of hybrid dynamics in rigid body systems and offer interpretability about system and contact properties. We show that the proposed framework achieves better prediction with fewer samples and is robust against noisy data or LCP-generated data. Future works will incorporate model-based control and explore interpretable safe control policies for robotics applications. A particular direction could be to develop appropriate energy shaping control policies  and integrate them with this proposed learning framework. Limitations:\nOur framework assumes a known collision detection module. Although it can be obtained from an idealized touch feedback sensor , this information might be unavailable in other scenarios. Future work would explore how to relax this assumption.\nOur framework might fail to correctly simulate systems which have extremely high mass ratios or stiffness ratios as compared to Macklin et al. [ref]37, where they show their primal method and dual method perform well in high mass ratios and high stiffness ratios scenarios, respectively. Our model might also have challenges in contact-rich systems and might not be as scalable as IPC . Please see Appendix L for additional scalability results. Our framework also uses a mix of acceleration-based simulation (integrating continuous dynamics) and time-stepping methods (calculating instantaneous velocity change) while other simulation methods typically use only one of them. This is because we’d like to use RK4 to better enforce the conservation of energy as done in [ref]14 [ref]17. However, this choice also makes our simulator not as efficient as other simulators. We would like to compare our method to other differentiable physics model such as NeuralSim  and gradSim . However, gradSim has not been open sourced when this work is conducted and it is hard to reproduce model. NeuralSim has its own automatic differentiation engine where gradient are computed one at the time, which is suitable for downstream tasks as demonstrated in ; however, it is not suitable for dynamics and parameter learning tasks where a large number of parameters need to be updated based on their gradients. Additional efforts need to made to incorporate NeuralSim with deep learning frameworks. Although we are not able to compare our work with these differentiable physics simulators, these difficulties demonstrate that dynamics and parameter learning with differentiable physics simulators are currently underexplored in the literature. Societal impact: We introduce a framework for data-driven dynamics modelling which uses physics-based priors to improve generalization, sample efficiency, and interpretability. Data-driven dynamics modelling, in general, can have a profound effect in learning-based control synthesis, especially in robotics and automation. However, our proposed framework is still a conceptual proposal and has a very low (around 2) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5. We are yet to fully understand its limitations and failure scenarios that can significantly influence its real-world adoption.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: Future work would explore how to relax this assumption.\nOur framework might fail to correctly simulate systems which have extremely high mass ratios or stiffness ratios as compared to Macklin et al.
