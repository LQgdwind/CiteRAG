      "content": "Paper Title: Safe Motion Planning with Environment Uncertainty\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe denote by ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} the set of all points occupied by a rigid-body robot at any given time. Similarly, let 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} represent the set of all points occupied by a rigid-body obstacle. A collision occurs if there exits a point such that it is in both ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} and 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}. Thus the collision condition is defined as and we denote the probability of collision as P​(ℛ∩𝒮≠{ϕ})𝑃ℛ𝒮italic-ϕP\\left(\\mathcal{R}\\cap\\mathcal{S}\\neq\\{\\phi\\}\\right). In this work we assume spherical geometries for ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} and 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} with radii r1subscript𝑟1r_{1} and s1subscript𝑠1s_{1}, respectively. We assign body-fixed reference frames to both the robot and the obstacle located at xksubscriptx𝑘\\textbf{x}_{k} and sksubscripts𝑘\\textbf{s}_{k}, respectively in the global frame. By abuse of notation we will use xksubscriptx𝑘\\textbf{x}_{k} and sksubscripts𝑘\\textbf{s}_{k} equivalently to ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} and 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}. The collision condition is thus defined in terms of the body-fixed frames as We recall here that the locations of the obstacles are in general uncertain. Let us now consider an obstacle at any given time instant, distributed according to the Gaussian sk∼𝒩​(𝝁sk,Σsk)similar-tosubscripts𝑘𝒩subscript𝝁subscripts𝑘subscriptΣsubscripts𝑘\\textbf{s}_{k}\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\bm{\\mu}_{\\textbf{s}_{k}},\\Sigma_{\\textbf{s}_{k}}\\right), where 𝝁sksubscript𝝁subscripts𝑘\\bm{\\mu}_{\\textbf{s}_{k}} represents the mean and ΣsksubscriptΣsubscripts𝑘\\Sigma_{\\textbf{s}_{k}} the associated covariance. Given the current robot state xksubscriptx𝑘\\textbf{x}_{k} and the obstacle state sksubscripts𝑘\\textbf{s}_{k}, the probability of collision can be formulated if the joint distribution between the robot and the obstacle state is known. In such a case the collision probability is given by where 𝒞xk,sksubscript𝒞subscriptx𝑘subscripts𝑘\\mathcal{C}_{\\textbf{x}_{k},\\textbf{s}_{k}} as defined above represents the fact that the robot configuration xksubscriptx𝑘\\textbf{x}_{k} and its collision with an obstacle at location sksubscripts𝑘\\textbf{s}_{k} is considered, and Icsubscript𝐼𝑐I_{c} is an indicator function defined as and p​(xk,sk)𝑝subscriptx𝑘subscripts𝑘p(\\textbf{x}_{k},\\textbf{s}_{k}) is the joint distribution of the robot and the obstacle.  compute an approximate upper bound for the collision probability by linearizing the collision condition. [ref]20 use MCI to compute (16). However, the resulting double summation is approximated to a single summation to reduce computational complexity. ,  approximate the integral in (16) as V​p​(xk,sk)𝑉𝑝subscriptx𝑘subscripts𝑘Vp(\\textbf{x}_{k},\\textbf{s}_{k}), where V𝑉V is the volume occupied by the robot. For computing p​(xk,sk)𝑝subscriptx𝑘subscripts𝑘p(\\textbf{x}_{k},\\textbf{s}_{k}), they first assume a distribution centered around the obstacle with the covariance being the sum of the robot and obstacle location uncertainties. Then the density p​(xk,sk)𝑝subscriptx𝑘subscripts𝑘p(\\textbf{x}_{k},\\textbf{s}_{k}) is computed by assuming a constant robot location. Du Toit and Burdick use the robot center, whereas in  the maximum of p​(xk,sk)𝑝subscriptx𝑘subscripts𝑘p(\\textbf{x}_{k},\\textbf{s}_{k}) on the surface of the robot is used to obtain an upper bound. However, the approximation is valid only when the robot radius is negligible. To demonstrate, let us re-write the collision condition as If the robot radius is negligible then it can be assumed that sk=xksubscripts𝑘subscriptx𝑘\\textbf{s}_{k}=\\textbf{x}_{k}, giving Thus assuming a constant value of the obstacle evaluated at the robot location, we have where V𝑉V is the volume occupied by the robot. The approximate collision probability is thus Assuming that the robot and the obstacle locations are independent Gaussian distributions with sk∼𝒩​(𝝁sk,Σsk)similar-tosubscripts𝑘𝒩subscript𝝁subscripts𝑘subscriptΣsubscripts𝑘\\textbf{s}_{k}\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\bm{\\mu}_{\\textbf{s}_{k}},\\Sigma_{\\textbf{s}_{k}}\\right) and xk∼𝒩​(𝝁xk,Σxk)similar-tosubscriptx𝑘𝒩subscript𝝁subscriptx𝑘subscriptΣsubscriptx𝑘\\textbf{x}_{k}\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\bm{\\mu}_{\\textbf{x}_{k}},\\Sigma_{\\textbf{x}_{k}}\\right), the collision probability can be approximately written as where Other existing approaches truncate the state distributions or compute approximate upper bounds using chance-constraints. As such, these approaches compute an approximation of the collision probability. In contrast, we formulate the collision constraint as a quadratic form in random variables, allowing us to compute an exact expression for the collision probability. In the remainder of this  section a rigorous treatment of the same is presented. Since the robot and the obstacles are assumed to be spherical objects, the collision constraint is written as where (as before) xksubscriptx𝑘\\textbf{x}_{k} and sksubscripts𝑘\\textbf{s}_{k} are the random vectors that denote the robot and obstacle locations, respectively. Let the current estimates of the two random vectors be distributed according to sk∼𝒩​(𝝁sk,Σsk)similar-tosubscripts𝑘𝒩subscript𝝁subscripts𝑘subscriptΣsubscripts𝑘\\textbf{s}_{k}\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\bm{\\mu}_{\\textbf{s}_{k}},\\Sigma_{\\textbf{s}_{k}}\\right) and xk∼𝒩​(𝝁xk,Σxk)similar-tosubscriptx𝑘𝒩subscript𝝁subscriptx𝑘subscriptΣsubscriptx𝑘\\textbf{x}_{k}\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\bm{\\mu}_{\\textbf{x}_{k}},\\Sigma_{\\textbf{x}_{k}}\\right). Let us denote the difference between the two random variables by w=xk−skwsubscriptx𝑘subscripts𝑘\\textbf{{w}}=\\textbf{x}_{k}-\\textbf{s}_{k}. Using the expression for the difference between two Gaussian distributions, we have w∼𝒩​(𝝁xk−𝝁sk,Σxk+Σsk)similar-tow𝒩subscript𝝁subscriptx𝑘subscript𝝁subscripts𝑘subscriptΣsubscriptx𝑘subscriptΣsubscripts𝑘\\textbf{{w}}\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\bm{\\mu}_{\\textbf{x}_{k}}-\\bm{\\mu}_{\\textbf{s}_{k}},\\Sigma_{\\textbf{x}_{k}}+\\Sigma_{\\textbf{s}_{k}}\\right). The collision constraint in (24) can now be written in terms of w, where y is a random vector distributed according to the squared L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}-norm of w. Now, given the probability density function (pdf) of y, the collision constraint reduces to solving the integral where p​(y)=Py​(y=y)𝑝𝑦subscript𝑃yy𝑦p(y)=P_{\\textbf{{y}}}(\\textbf{{y}}=y) is the pdf of y. It is noteworthy that the above integral is the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of y, that is, P​(𝒞xk,sk)=Fy​(y)𝑃subscript𝒞subscriptx𝑘subscripts𝑘subscript𝐹y𝑦P\\left(\\mathcal{C}_{\\textbf{x}_{k},\\textbf{s}_{k}}\\right)=F_{\\textbf{{y}}}(y), where Fy​(y)subscript𝐹y𝑦F_{\\textbf{{y}}}(y) denotes the cdf. Thus the collision condition reduces to finding the cdf of y such that y≤(r1+s1)2ysuperscriptsubscript𝑟1subscript𝑠12\\textbf{{y}}\\leq(r_{1}+s_{1})^{2}. As a consequence, we have In the following Sections, we will first show that the collision constraint is a quadratic form in random variables and later derive an exact expression for the cdf of the quadratic from.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: is the joint distribution of the robot and the obstacle.  compute an approximate upper bound for the collision probability by linearizing the collision condition. [ref]20 use MCI to compute (16).
