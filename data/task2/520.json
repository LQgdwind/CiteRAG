      "content": "Paper Title: Sparse GPU Kernels for Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nand  propose efficient SpMM kernels based on alternative sparse matrix formats designed for GPUs  .  discuss the design of high-performance SpMM on GPUs. We compare to their approach for computing SpMM in Section VII-A and reference their taxonomy for SpMM design throughout the text.  propose an adaptive tiling technique, where CSR matrices are partitioned into sets of rows. Within each set, the columns are re-ordered such that columns with more nonzeros are grouped. These \"heavy\" groups are processed together and exploit tiled execution to enable more reuse of operands. The remaining columns are processed with a standard row-splitting scheme. We benchmark and discuss limitations of this approach in Section VII-A. [ref]50 implement an efficient direct sparse convolution for CPUs and demonstrate performance gains relative to dense baselines.  develop a technique for inducing sparsity in Winograd convolutions  and design and efficient implementation for CPUs.  design efficient SpMM kernels for CPUs and demonstrate significant performance improvements for highly efficient neural networks on mobile processors. [ref]13 and [ref]15 enforce different forms of structure on sparse matrices to enable efficient mapping to GPUs. [ref]13 develop efficient GPU kernels for block-sparse matrices and apply them to neural networks on a range of different tasks. [ref]15 propose fixing the number of nonzeros in small regions of the sparse matrix to balance between performance and accuracy loss from enforcing structure on the topology of nonzeros.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: tiled execution to enable more reuse of operands. The remaining columns are processed with a standard row-splitting scheme. We benchmark and discuss limitations of this approach in Section VII-A.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
