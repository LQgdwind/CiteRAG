These methods (1-8), as well as our new proposed methods (9-12), are listed as follows: Self Normalizing Neural Network (SNN): Self normalizing networks with SELUs activation function and ranks the best among the FNNs . MSRAinit (MS): The deep neural network with Microsoft weight initialization . Highway (HW): Highway networks [ref]43. ResNet (ResNet): Residual networks adapted to FNNs using residual blocks with 2 or 3 layers [ref]44. Stochastic configuration networks (SCN): The\nrandomized neural network generated incrementally by stochastic configuration. Broad learning system (BLS): The RVFL based model with a complete paradigm shift in discriminative learning . Hierarchical ELM (H-ELM): Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine for multi-layer perception  edRVFL_O: The original ensemble deep random vector functional link neural network without re-normalization . edRVFL_N: The new edRVFL network with re-normalization that proposed in this work.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
