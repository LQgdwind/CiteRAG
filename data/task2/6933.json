      "content": "Paper Title: Iterative Multi-granular Image Editing using Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMultimodal Image Generation and Editing Methods:\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GAN)  based text to images approaches like StackGAN , StackGAN++  and AttnGAN  were effective in generating 64×64×36464364\\times 64\\times 3 images conditioned on their textual description. These methods work well in modelling simple objects like generating flowers and birds, but struggle to generate complex scenes with multiple objects. Recently, diffusion based methods   have had phenomenal success in generating realistic images from textual descriptions. Similar to the success in image synthesis domain, diffusion based models have had significant strides for editing images too. Imagic 1 is able to make complex non-rigid edits to real images by learning to align a text embedding with the input image and the target text. PnP 8, NTI , Imagic 1, DiffEdit [ref]4 first use DDIM inversion   to invert the image to the input tensor required by the the diffusion model, and then use the text conditioned denoising process to generate the image with the required edit. CycleDiffusion  proposes DPM-Encoder to project an image to the latent space of diffusion models thereby enabling them to be used as zero-shot image editors.\nInstructPix2Pix  and Imagen Editor  pass the image to be edited directly to the diffusion model by bypassing the DDIM inversion step. This improves the fidelity of the generated edits. But, none of these works addresses the challenges involved with iterative editing, which is the main focus of our work. A trivial way to make these efforts iterative would be to pass the edited image recursively. We compare with such iterative variants of PnP 8 and InstructPix2Pix  in Sec. 5. Recent efforts in mask guided image editing methods [ref]4  indeed can support multi-granular editing. We compare with these methods in Sec. 5. Iterative Image Synthesis: This area is relatively less explored. CAISE 2 and Conversational Editing 7 applies operations like ‘rotate image by 90∘superscript9090^{\\circ}’, ‘change the contrast by 606060’, ‘crop the image’ and so on. SSCR  and Keep drawing it  operates on synthetic data from CLEVR 0 dataset, and tries to add objects to a canvas incrementally. Our approach operates on natural images, and can handle real-world edits that an artist might make to an image.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: editing images too. Imagic 1 is able to make complex non-rigid edits to real images by learning to align a text embedding with the input image and the target text.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
