      "content": "Paper Title: Exact and Approximate High-Multiplicity Scheduling on Identical Machines\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe describe three tools that can be used to improve the framework by Goemans and Rothvoss  such that the running time does not depend on ∥b∥∞fragments∥b∥\\left\\lVert b\\right\\rVert_{\\infty}, which in the case of scheduling problems eliminates parameters like the makespan or the largest due date from the running time. The first tool (covered in section 3) is a balancing result by Govzmann et al.  that allows pre-scheduling many of the jobs, leaving us with a makespan value that is bounded by 2dpmaxfragments2dp2dp_{\\max}, where pmaxfragmentspp_{\\max} is the largest processing time. Applying this preprocessing before using the algorithm by Goemans and Rothvoss yields the following running times for solving P||{Cmax,Cmin,Cenvy}fragmentsP||{C,C,Cenvy}{P||\\{C_{\\max},C_{\\min},C_{\\textup{envy}}\\}}: The optimization problem P||{Cmax,Cmin}fragmentsP||{C,C}{P||\\{C_{\\max},C_{\\min}\\}} can be solved in time (dlog(pmax)+log(2dpmax2))2O(d)⟨I⟩O(1)fragments(d(p)(2dp2))fragments2fragmentsO(d)⟨I⟩fragmentsO(1)(d\\log(p_{\\max})+\\log(2dp_{\\max}^{2}))^{2^{O(d)}}\\langle I\\rangle^{O(1)} and the optimization problem P||CenvyfragmentsP||Cenvy{P||C_{\\textup{envy}}} can be solved in time pmax(dlog(pmax)+log(2dpmax2))2O(d)⟨I⟩O(1)fragmentsp(d(p)(2dp2))fragments2fragmentsO(d)⟨I⟩fragmentsO(1)p_{\\max}(d\\\\\n\\log(p_{\\max})+\\log(2dp_{\\max}^{2}))^{2^{O(d)}}\\langle I\\rangle^{O(1)}. We also show lower bounds for P||CmaxfragmentsP||C{P||C_{\\max}} that somewhat resemble the running time of our algorithm, though there is still a gap (for a proof, see LABEL:sect:complexity): Let ε>0fragmentsε0\\varepsilon>0. Unless the ETH fails, P||CmaxfragmentsP||C{P||C_{\\max}} cannot be solved in time ⟨I⟩O(d1−ε)pmaxO(1)fragments⟨I⟩fragmentsO(dfragments1ε)pfragmentsO(1)\\langle I\\rangle^{O(d^{1-\\varepsilon})}p_{\\max}^{O(1)}, ⟨I⟩O(1)dO(d1−ε)pmaxO(1)fragments⟨I⟩fragmentsO(1)dfragmentsO(dfragments1ε)pfragmentsO(1)\\langle I\\rangle^{O(1)}d^{O(d^{1-\\varepsilon})}p_{\\max}^{O(1)} or ⟨I⟩o(dlog(d))pmaxO(1)fragments⟨I⟩fragmentso(𝑑fragments(d))pfragmentsO(1)\\langle I\\rangle^{o\\left(\\frac{d}{\\log(d)}\\right)}p_{\\max}^{O(1)}. Note that the encoding length ⟨I⟩fragments⟨I⟩\\langle I\\rangle includes log(pmax)fragments(p)\\log(p_{\\max}) and d𝑑d. In Appendix B, we show that the balancing result can be used to speed up an additive approximation scheme by Buchem et al.  in the case where the number of jobs ∥n∥1fragments∥n∥1\\left\\lVert n\\right\\rVert_{1} is larger than the number of machines m𝑚m times pmaxfragmentspp_{\\max}: There is an additive approximation scheme for P||{Cmax,Cmin,Cenvy}fragmentsP||{C,C,Cenvy}{P||\\{C_{\\max},C_{\\min},C_{\\textup{envy}}\\}} with error at most εpmaxfragmentsεp\\varepsilon p_{\\max} that has running time (mpmax)O(1ε)fragments(mp)fragmentsO(1𝜀)(mp_{\\max})^{O(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})}. In LABEL:sect:omittedproofs, we give a matching lower bound for objective CmaxfragmentsCC_{\\max} via ETH: Let δ>0fragmentsδ0\\delta>0. Then P||CmaxfragmentsP||C{P||C_{\\max}} cannot be approximated with additive error at most εpmaxfragmentsεp\\varepsilon p_{\\max} in time (mpmax)O((1ε)1−δ)fragments(mp)fragmentsO((1𝜀)fragments1δ)(mp_{\\max})^{O((\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})^{1-\\delta})}, unless the ETH fails. The second tool (covered in section 4) involves solving a special relaxation of an integer linear program (ILP) associated with a given PQ-representation. A proximity result by Cslovjecsek et al.  then gives an upper bound for the points in P𝑃P, which allows us to reduce the coefficients in the system Ax≤bfragmentsAxbAx\\leq b describing P𝑃P with the famous result by Frank and Tardos . Together, this then yields an algorithm for solving PQ-representations in a running time independent of ∥b∥∞fragments∥b∥\\left\\lVert b\\right\\rVert_{\\infty}:111Of course, the entries in b𝑏b still appear in the encoding length of P𝑃P, but only logarithmically. If a problem has a PQ-representation (P,Q,m)fragments(P,Q,m)(P,Q,m) with P={x∈ℝ≥0N|A(P)x=b(P)}fragmentsP{xRfragments0𝑁|Afragments(P)xbfragments(P)}P=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}^{N}\\,|\\,A^{(P)}x=b^{(P)}\\} and Q={x∈ℝ≥0N|A(Q)x=b(Q)}fragmentsQ{xRfragments0𝑁|Afragments(Q)xbfragments(Q)}Q=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}^{N}\\,|\\,A^{(Q)}x=b^{(Q)}\\} with A(P)∈ℤM(P)×NfragmentsAfragments(P)ZfragmentsMfragments(P)NA^{(P)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{M^{(P)}\\times N}, A(Q)∈ℤM(Q)×NfragmentsAfragments(Q)ZfragmentsMfragments(Q)NA^{(Q)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{M^{(Q)}\\times N}, b(P)∈ℤM(P)fragmentsbfragments(P)ZfragmentsMfragments(P)b^{(P)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{M^{(P)}} and b(Q)∈ℤM(Q)fragmentsbfragments(Q)ZfragmentsMfragments(Q)b^{(Q)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{M^{(Q)}}, it can be solved in time The third tool (covered in section 5) is an upper bound for the number of vertices of the integer hull of a polytope that is similar to the one by Berndt et al.  but better for our specific purpose: The number of vertices of the integer hull of a polytope P={x∈ℝN≥0|Ax=b}fragmentsP{xR𝑁fragments0|Axb}P=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N}_{\\geq 0}\\,|\\,Ax=b\\} is bounded by NMO(Mlog(MΔ))NfragmentsN𝑀O(M(MΔ))𝑁N^{M}O(M\\log(M\\Delta))^{N}, where A∈ℤM×NfragmentsAZfragmentsMNA\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{M\\times N} and Δ=∥A∥∞fragmentsΔ∥A∥\\Delta=\\left\\lVert A\\right\\rVert_{\\infty}. Note that this does not depend on ∥b∥∞fragments∥b∥\\left\\lVert b\\right\\rVert_{\\infty}. Previously known bounds either depend on ∥b∥∞fragments∥b∥\\left\\lVert b\\right\\rVert_{\\infty} or are exponential in log(∥A∥∞)fragments(∥A∥)\\log(\\left\\lVert A\\right\\rVert_{\\infty}). Combined with the algorithm by Jansen and Klein 3, this gives an alternative way of solving PQ-representations: If a problem has a PQ-representation (P,Q,m)fragments(P,Q,m)(P,Q,m) with P={x∈ℝ≥0N|A(P)x=b(P)}fragmentsP{xRfragments0𝑁|Afragments(P)xbfragments(P)}P=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}^{N}\\,|\\,A^{(P)}x=b^{(P)}\\} and Q={x∈ℝ≥0N|A(Q)x=b(Q)}fragmentsQ{xRfragments0𝑁|Afragments(Q)xbfragments(Q)}Q=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}^{N}\\,|\\,A^{(Q)}x=b^{(Q)}\\} with A(P)∈ℤM(P)×NfragmentsAfragments(P)ZfragmentsMfragments(P)NA^{(P)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{M^{(P)}\\times N}, A(Q)∈ℤM(Q)×NfragmentsAfragments(Q)ZfragmentsMfragments(Q)NA^{(Q)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{M^{(Q)}\\times N}, b(P)∈ℤM(P)fragmentsbfragments(P)ZfragmentsMfragments(P)b^{(P)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{M^{(P)}} and b(Q)∈ℤM(Q)fragmentsbfragments(Q)ZfragmentsMfragments(Q)b^{(Q)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{M^{(Q)}}, it can be solved in time Both Theorem 1.5 and Theorem 1.7 can be used to obtain algorithms for various scheduling problems that are more efficient than a straightforward application of the results by Goemans and Rothvoss  and Jansen and Klein 3 with previously known bounds for the vertices of the integer hull.\nIn Appendix A, we give PQ-representations for various scheduling problems, MinSum-Weighted-BinPacking (MSWBP) and uniform n𝑛n-fold ILPs. The theorems also yield (log(pmax))2O(d)⟨I⟩O(1)fragments((p))fragments2fragmentsO(d)⟨I⟩fragmentsO(1)(\\log(p_{\\max}))^{2^{O(d)}}\\langle I\\rangle^{O(1)}-time (resp. pmax(log(pmax))2O(d)⟨I⟩O(1)fragmentsp((p))fragments2fragmentsO(d)⟨I⟩fragmentsO(1)p_{\\max}(\\log(p_{\\max}))^{2^{O(d)}}\\langle I\\rangle^{O(1)}) algorithms for P||{Cmax,Cmin,Cenvy}fragmentsP||{C,C,Cenvy}{P||\\{C_{\\max},C_{\\min},C_{\\textup{envy}}\\}}, but with worse constants than in Theorem 1.1.\nOne might ask why such running times are interesting, as the parameters pmaxfragmentspp_{\\max} and d𝑑d are still entangled. But with an inequality that can be found in an exercise from [ref]11 (Hint 3.18) and has been used by Koutecký and Zink , one can bound (log(Δ))2O(d)fragments((Δ))fragments2fragmentsO(d)(\\log(\\Delta))^{2^{O(d)}} by 22O(d)Δo(1)fragments2fragments2fragmentsO(d)Δfragmentso(1)2^{2^{O(d)}}\\Delta^{o\\left(1\\right)} (see LABEL:lem:paralgbound).\nSo Theorem 1.1 almost answers the open question by Mnich and van Bevern  for an algorithm solving P||CmaxfragmentsP||C{P||C_{\\max}} that is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) w.r.t. d𝑑d. This question had been partially answered by Koutecký and Zink , who gave an f(d)no(1)⟨I⟩O(1)fragmentsf(d)nfragmentso(1)⟨I⟩fragmentsO(1)f(d)n^{o\\left(1\\right)}\\langle I\\rangle^{O(1)}-time algorithm, where f𝑓f is some computable function.\nActually, one can analyze the function (log(Δ))2O(d)fragments((Δ))fragments2fragmentsO(d)(\\log(\\Delta))^{2^{O(d)}} even further. Define the tower function for any α∈ℕfragmentsαN\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{N}, β∈ℝfragmentsβR\\beta\\in\\mathbb{R} recursively as follows: Tower(α,β)=βfragmentsTower(α,β)β\\textup{Tower}(\\alpha,\\beta)=\\beta if α=0fragmentsα0\\alpha=0 and Tower(α,β)=2Tower(α−1,β)fragmentsTower(α,β)2fragmentsTower(α1,β)\\textup{Tower}(\\alpha,\\beta)=2^{\\textup{Tower}(\\alpha-1,\\beta)} otherwise.\nFor example, Tower(1,β)=2βfragmentsTower(1,β)2𝛽\\text{Tower}(1,\\beta)=2^{\\beta} and Tower(2,β)=22βfragmentsTower(2,β)2fragments2𝛽\\text{Tower}(2,\\beta)=2^{2^{\\beta}}. We generalize the inequality used by Koutecký and Zink  to the following: For every α,β,γ∈ℕ>0fragmentsα,β,γNfragments0\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma\\in\\mathbb{N}_{>0}, we have βγ≤max{Tower(α,γ)γ,βlog(α)(β)}fragmentsβ𝛾{Tower(α,γ)𝛾,βfragmentsfragments(α)(β)}\\beta^{\\gamma}\\leq\\max\\{\\textup{Tower}(\\alpha,\\gamma)^{\\gamma},\\beta^{\\log^{(\\alpha)}(\\beta)}\\}. Case 1: γ≥log(α)(β)fragmentsγfragments(α)(β)\\gamma\\geq\\log^{(\\alpha)}(\\beta). Then Tower(α,γ)≥βfragmentsTower(α,γ)β\\textup{Tower}(\\alpha,\\gamma)\\geq\\beta and we get βγ≤Tower(α,γ)γfragmentsβ𝛾Tower(α,γ)𝛾\\beta^{\\gamma}\\leq\\textup{Tower}(\\alpha,\\gamma)^{\\gamma}. Case 2: γ<log(α)(β)fragmentsγfragments(α)(β)\\gamma<\\log^{(\\alpha)}(\\beta). Then βγ<βlog(α)(β)fragmentsβ𝛾βfragmentsfragments(α)(β)\\beta^{\\gamma}<\\beta^{\\log^{(\\alpha)}(\\beta)}. So inserting β=log(pmax)fragmentsβ(p)\\beta=\\log(p_{\\max}), γ=2O(d)fragmentsγ2fragmentsO(d)\\gamma=2^{O(d)}, we get for any α∈ℕ>0fragmentsαNfragments0\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{N}_{>0}: Interestingly enough, log(α+1)(pmax)≤1fragmentsfragments(α1)(p)1\\log^{(\\alpha+1)}(p_{\\max})\\leq 1 for α=4fragmentsα4\\alpha=4, as long as pmax≤265536fragmentsp265536p_{\\max}\\leq 2^{65536}. So one could argue that for any reasonable value of pmaxfragmentspp_{\\max} (≤265536fragments265536\\leq 2^{65536}), the running time log(pmax)2O(d)⟨I⟩O(1)fragments(p)fragments2fragmentsO(d)⟨I⟩fragmentsO(1)\\log(p_{\\max})^{2^{O(d)}}\\langle I\\rangle^{O(1)} is FPT w.r.t. d𝑑d. Of course, it is a bit hypocritical to argue about ?reasonable? values (which would be encountered in practice) if at the same time the running time then includes a tower of height 555. Also, the assumption pmax≤265536fragmentsp265536p_{\\max}\\leq 2^{65536} directly yields an FPT running time. It still seems to us that this is an interesting observation, as this might be as close to an FPT running time as one can get. In LABEL:sect:complexity, we give a reduction from Q||{Cmax,Cmin}fragmentsQ||{C,C}{Q||\\{C_{\\max},C_{\\min}\\}} to P||{Cmax,Cmin}fragmentsP||{C,C}{P||\\{C_{\\max},C_{\\min}\\}}, producing instances with d+τfragmentsdτd+\\tau job types, where τ𝜏\\tau is the number of machine types. This shows that the big open question whether P||CmaxfragmentsP||C{P||C_{\\max}} is FPT w.r.t. parameter d𝑑d (see ) and the question whether Q||{CminfragmentsQ||{C{Q||\\{C_{\\min}} is FPT w.r.t. parameters d𝑑d and τ𝜏\\tau have the same answer: The following statements are equivalent: P||{Cmax,Cmin}fragmentsP||{C,C}{P||\\{C_{\\max},C_{\\min}\\}} is FPT w.r.t. parameter d𝑑d. Q||{Cmax,Cmin}fragmentsQ||{C,C}{Q||\\{C_{\\max},C_{\\min}\\}} is FPT w.r.t. parameters d𝑑d and τ𝜏\\tau.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: Theorem 1.1.\nOne might ask why such running times are interesting, as the parameters pmaxfragmentspp_{\\max} and d𝑑d are still entangled.
