      "content": "Paper Title: Use All The Labels: A Hierarchical Multi-Label Contrastive Learning Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the real world, hierarchical multi-labels occur naturally and frequently. Biological classification of organisms is structured in a taxonomic hierarchy. In e-commerce websites, retail spaces and grocery stores, products are organized by several levels of categories. The hierarchical representation is a natural categorization of classes, and serves to efficiently represent the relationship between different classes. However, this relationship is seldom utilized in learning tasks, with traditional supervised approaches preferring to organize their classes in a flat list. In single task learning problems, where a model is learned for one objective only, a flat list of classes is a reasonable approach. However, in representation learning frameworks, where a single embedding function can be used in a variety of downstream tasks, utilizing all of the supervisory signal available is vital. In order to generalize to unknown downstream tasks and unseen data, the embedding function must represent the data concisely and accurately, which includes preserving the hierarchical categorization in the embedding space. However, representation learning approaches that exploit this hierarchical relationship between labels have received very little attention. In recent years, several unsupervised [ref]13   and supervised [ref]18 [ref]17   metric learning frameworks have been proposed. These approaches typically rely on minimizing the distance between representations of a positive pair and maximizing the distance between negative pairs. In the unsupervised (self-supervised) setting   [ref]13 , the positive pairs are different views of the same image, most typically obtained by random augmentations of the anchor image  [ref]13 . In the supervised setting, labels are used to construct a wider variety of positive pairs, from different images of the same class and their augmentations [ref]17 [ref]18. Positive pairs constructed from augmentations of the anchor image, and pairs constructed from the anchor image and other images of the same class are considered to be equivalent, and the learning process attempts to minimize the distance between images in all of these positive pairs to the same degree. While representations learned in this paradigm may be satisfactory for a downstream task based on the supervisory label such as category prediction, other tasks such as instance prediction, retrieval, attribute prediction and clustering can suffer due to the absence of direct supervision for these tasks. Additionally, these approaches do not support multi-label learning and are unable to utilize information about the relationship between labels. Formally, in the hierarchical multi-label setting, each data point has multiple dependent labels, and the relationship between labels is best represented in a hierarchy. See Figure 1(b) for a sample representation in a tree structure. For example, in the DeepFashion dataset, each data point has 3 hierarchically structured labels: category (Denim, Cardigan, Shirts etc), product (identified by product id) and variation (typically color / pattern variations). For the anchor image in Figure 1(a), which belongs to a specific product in the Denim category , the sub-category image is a different sample from the same product, and the category image is from a different product in the same category. All the negative images are from different categories. Our proposed approach leverages all the available labels to learn an embedding function that can preserve the label hierarchy in the embedding space. We develop a general representation learning framework that can utilize available ground truth and learn embeddings that generalize to a variety of downstream tasks. We present two novel losses (and their combination) that exploit the relationship between hierarchical multi-labels and learn representations that can retain the label relationship in the representation space. The Hierarchical Multi-label Contrastive Loss (HiMulCon) enforces a penalty that is dependent on the proximity between the anchor image and the matching image in the label space. In this setting, we define proximity in the label space as the overlap in ancestry in the tree structure. The Hierarchical Constraint Enforcing Loss (HiConE) prevents the hierarchy violation, that is, it ensures that the loss from pairs farther apart in the label space is never smaller than the loss from pairs that are closer. Models learned under this framework can be used exactly like traditional representation learning frameworks, a model is trained with our novel loss functions to learn an efficient encoder network, and embeddings generated from this approach can be used in a variety of downstream tasks. Our framework is not limited to the hierarchical multi-label scenario. It reduces to the supervised contrastive approach [ref]18 when only single level labels are available, and to the SimCLR  approach when no labels are available. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework in comparison to Khosla et al. [ref]18, Chen et al.  and a standard cross entropy based approach on downstream tasks such as category prediction, sub-category retrieval and clustering NMI . These tasks also show that our approach preserves the hierarchical relationship between labels in the representation space, and generalizes to unseen data as well.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: the embedding space.
