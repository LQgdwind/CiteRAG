      "content": "Paper Title: Expected Scalarised Returns Dominance: A New Solution Concept for Multi-Objective Decision Making An earlier version of this work was presented at the Adaptive and Learning Agents Workshop 2021 [1]. This article extends our workshop paper with additional theoretical analysis and new empirical results.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMORL has been highlighted as one of several key challenges that needs to be addressed in order for RL to be commonly deployed in real-world systems . In order to apply RL to the real world the MORL community must consider the ESR criterion. However, the ESR criterion has largely been ignored by the MORL community, with the exception of the works of Roijers et al.  , Hayes et al.   and Vamplew et al. 7. The works of Hayes et al.   and Roijers et al.  present single-policy algorithms that are suitable to learn policies under the ESR criterion, however, prior to this work, a formal definition of the necessary requirements to compute policies under the ESR criterion had not previously been defined. In Section 3, we outline, through examples and definitions, the necessary requirements to optimise under the ESR criterion.\nThe formal definitions outlined in Section 3 ensure that an optimal policy can be learned when the utility function of the user is known under the ESR criterion. However, in the real world, a userâ€™s preferences over objectives (or utility function) may be unknown at the time of learning . Prior to this paper, a suitable solution set for the unknown utility function scenario under the ESR criterion had not been defined. This long-standing research gap has restricted the applicability of MORL in real-world scenarios under the ESR criterion. In Section 4 and Section 5 we define the necessary solution sets required for multi-policy algorithms to learn a set of optimal policies under the ESR criterion when the utility function of a user is unknown. In Section 6 we present a novel multi-policy algorithm, known as multi-objective tabular distributional reinforcement learning (MOTDRL), that can learn the ESR set in a MOMAB setting when the utility function of a user is unknown at the time of learning. In Section 7 we evaluate MOTDRL in two MOMAB settings and show that MOTDRL can learn the ESR set in MOMAB settings.\nThis work aims to answer some of the existing research questions regarding the ESR criterion. Moreover, we aim to highlight the importance of the ESR criterion when applying MORL to real-world scenarios. In order to successfully apply MORL to the real world, we must implement new single-policy and multi-policy algorithms that can learn solutions for non-linear utility functions in various scenarios. A promising direction for future work would be to extend the work of Hayes et al.  and the work of Wang and Sebag . It may be possible to build on the aforementioned works to implement a multi-objective distributional Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that can learn a set of optimal policies under the ESR criterion. It is important to note that Hayes et al.   use bootstrap Thompson sampling to approximate a posterior distribution. This method cannot learn the ESR set when utility function of a user is unknown, therefore a different distributional method must be used to learn the ESR set. Although the distributional method used by Hayes et al.  cannot be used to learn the ESR set, this work is still a useful starting point. Given distributional MORL methods are a new area of research, not much is known about the computational requirements of maintaining a return distribution. Therefore, it is important that a comprehensive computational analysis of distributional MORL methods is undertaken to fully understand the implications of maintaining a return distribution. In a future publication we plan to perform a computational analysis for distributional MORL methods in both bandit and sequential decision making settings. A lack of well defined benchmarks is a significant challenge associated with implementing any new single-policy or multi-policy algorithms under the ESR criterion. Currently, very few ESR benchmark environments exist (e.g. Fishwood ). In order to accurately evaluate single-policy and multi-policy ESR algorithms, a suite of benchmark problem domains need to be designed. Under the SER criterion, such benchmarks already exist, e.g. Deep Sea Treasure [ref]4.\nIt is also important to highlight the need to establish new metrics to evaluate multi-policy algorithms under the ESR criterion. As previously mentioned, all metrics used to evaluate multi-objective algorithms are designed for the SER criterion. In order to accurately evaluate multi-policy algorithms under the ESR criterion, new metrics must be determined. We note that extending the work of Zintgraf et al. 8 for the ESR criterion would be a promising starting point.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: evaluate single-policy and multi-policy ESR algorithms, a suite of benchmark problem domains need to be designed.
