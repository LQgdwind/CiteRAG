      "content": "Paper Title: E2PN: Efficient SE(3)-Equivariant Point Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGroup convolutions: In 2016, Cohen and Welling proposed G-CNN , enabling equivariance beyond translations on 2D images with generalized G-convolutions (group convolutions) over the group of 90-degree rotations, which is one of the earliest efforts in equivariant deep learning. Group convolution is similar to conventional convolutions but has an extended domain for feature maps and kernels. The idea was then applied to different networks to enable equivariance for SE‚Äã(2)SE2\\mathrm{SE}(2)  , SO‚Äã(3)SO3\\mathrm{SO}(3) , SE‚Äã(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3)  [ref]2, and E‚Äã(3)E3\\mathrm{E}(3)  groups up to some discretization. The idea mainly works with finite (discretized) groups, as it is convenient to parameterize feature maps and kernels on the discretized group elements just as on pixel grids. Group convolutions have a relatively simple structure, making them straightforward to apply, but a major downside is that the lifted domain of features and kernels causes higher computational and memory costs, and the problem is more prominent when the group is large.\nGroups convs can also work with continuous groups, for example, with the help of Monte Carlo (MC) estimation as in [ref]13, but they suffer from a large memory burden in MC sampling when the number of layers grows . Steerable CNNs: Another line of work is steerable CNNs. Instead of augmenting the domain of feature maps, steerable CNNs generalize the space of feature values to be steerable, i.e., the feature values transform predictably as the input transforms. The way the feature transforms is called the group representation in the feature space, governed by the feature type. Features of scalar type are kept unchanged under group actions, and we call the group representation trivial. For vector or tensor feature types, the representation is not trivial, and the features will change with group actions, for example, through rotation matrix multiplication. Steerable CNNs work for both discretized and continuous groups. One may freely design the feature types based on pre-determined basic types and corresponding representations (irreducible representations, i.e., irreps) as building blocks for a given group. Group convolutions can be viewed as a special case of steerable CNNs with regular representations, i.e., channels of a feature vector undergo permutations when transformed. Examples of steerable CNNs include   3 0 . While the framework of steerable CNNs generalizes group convolutions with more flexibility, it requires a good understanding of representation theory and involves generalized Fourier analysis when working with a continuous group, which makes the structure complicated and challenging to apply in real-world applications broadly. The work of¬†[ref]39  also found empirically that steerable CNNs with irreps underperform regular representations in certain tasks. Theoretical progress: There has been a lot of progress in the theoretical development of equivariant networks that are not group-specific.  developed a general formulation for steerable CNNs with scalar type features, and   generalized it to arbitrary feature types. It is proven that all equivariant linear maps can be written as convolutions. The formulation from the perspective of Fourier analysis was presented in 6. [ref]39 found the general form of solution for the equivariant kernels for E‚Äã(2)ùê∏2E(2) group, later generalized to any compact group .  proposed an algorithm to solve for the equivariance constraint for arbitrary matrix group. The formulation of group convolution based on MC estimation was proposed for any Lie group with [ref]13 or without  surjective exponential maps. Equivariant non-linear layers like transformers   and equivariant set and graph networks    are also proposed, but they are not the focus of this paper. Applications of equivariant learning in perception tasks: We want to highlight a few equivariant networks that gain attention in perception applications due to their simplicity and practicality. Vector Neurons  is a PointNet-like SO‚Äã(3)SO3\\mathrm{SO}(3)-equivariant network for 3D point cloud learning, later applied to point cloud registration 9 and manipulation . It can be viewed as a special case of TFN  with type-1 features and self-interactions only. E2CNN [ref]39 as an SE‚Äã(2)SE2\\mathrm{SE}(2)-equivariant framework was applied in several image processing tasks  , given its generality and user-friendly library. DEVIANT  applied scale-equivariant convolutions in monocular 3D object detection. EPN [ref]2 is a group convolution network with SE‚Äã(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3)-equivariance for 3D point cloud learning based on KPConv  and was used in practice, for example in place recognition task . We also position this proposed work in this category, aiming to promote the application of equivariant learning with our efficient and easy-to-use design. Our work is developed based on EPN, which also serves as a major baseline in this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: extended domain for feature maps and kernels.
