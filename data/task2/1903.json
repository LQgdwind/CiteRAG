      "content": "Paper Title: HYPER2: Hyperbolic Poincaré Embedding for Hyper-Relational Link Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe emerging of large-scale Knowledge Graphs(KGs), such as Freebase, Wikidata and Google’s Knowledge Graph power a plethora of downstream tasks ranging from recommendation systems to semantic search and from question answering to natural language understanding[ref]7. KGs are generally represented as a set of triplets in the form of (head entity, relation, tail entity) where a relation links an entity pair. Despite containing rich information, KGs are still in face of incompleteness issue. To our knowledge, 71% of all people in Freebase have no p​l​a​c​e​_​o​f​_​b​i​r​t​h𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑒_𝑜𝑓_𝑏𝑖𝑟𝑡ℎplace\\_of\\_birth attribute. Link prediction task, seeking to predict new links between entities in the graph based on existing ones, tackles this issue. A variety of representitive link prediction techniques such as RESCAL0, TransE1 and ConvE2 have been devised to work over triplet based KGs. And in the past decade, we have witnessed gratifying progress in this realm. Nevertheless, when lots of efforts are poured into binary facts(i.e. triplets), we pay less attention to the ubiquitous n-ary facts involving more than two entities. For instance, award_nomination relation often involves an awarding institution, a receiver, an award and a work. And several performers can also co-occur in a performance.\nAs a matter of fact, in Freebase, more than 1/3 entities participate in n-ary facts3. These higher-arity facts with more knowledge are much closer to natural language, link prediction in hyper-relational KGs provides an excellent potential for lots of downstream NLP applications4. Existing triple based models decompose n-ary facts into a set of triplets, irreversibly resulting in internal structural and semantic loss5. To deal with the more challenging n-ary facts without breaking them into triplets, m-TransH3, a translational distance model based on TransH is first proposed. Along with the model, the authors put forward the first hyper-relational KG JF17K, which is derived from Freebase with frequent presence of n-ary facts. The work is ground breaking, but it combines relations and entities in sequence so as to get a so-called meta-relation. The strict position restriction would bring information loss, for in some cases, two or more entities changing position doesn’t necessarily lead to semantic deviation. Take the sentence Andrea Bocelli sang Time To Say Goodbye and Canto Della Terra with Sarah Brightman in the concert Vivere: Live In Tuscany as an example, exchanging position of Time To Say Goodbye and Canto Della Terra expresses exactly the same semantic meaning. RAE6 further takes multi-layer perceptron into m-TransH, the incremental work brings constant progress. But both of the two tranlational models are limited by the translation nature and suffer from weak expressiveness,\nleaving much room for improvement. Besides, these two models cannot predict relations. Deep models recently gain popularity in n-ary link prediction just as they prevail in many other tasks. NaLP and a new dataset WikiPeople, extracted from Wikidata mainly focusing on people-related facts, are proposed in 7. NaLP outperforms m-TransH and RAE on both dataset, but as shown in Figure 2(c), it breaks an n-ary fact into n𝑛n key-value pairs and needs to compute relatedness Cn2superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑛2C_{n}^{2} times for a single fact. Authors of HINGE5 advocate that primary triple keeps the main sturcture and semantic information of an n-ary fact.\nExperiments shows that Hinge greatly outperforms NaLP, validating the significance of primary triple. But as dipicted in Figure 2(b), HINGE views an n-ary fact as the combiantion of a primary triple and n−2𝑛2n-2 3-ary tuples, it captures triple and quintuple features with convolution network. It has been proved in 8 that some n-ary facts are in possesseion of indecomposibility. Take the m​e​d​i​c​a​l​_​r​e​c​o​r​d𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙_𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑑medical\\_record relation as an example, A d​o​c​t​o​r𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟doctor will record the r​e​a​c​t​i​o​n𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛reaction of a p​a​t​i​e​n​t𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡patient after he takes m​e​d​i​c​i​n​e𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑛𝑒medicine. R​e​a​c​t​i​o​n𝑅𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛Reaction of a p​a​t​i​e​n​t𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡patient is tightly correlated to what m​e​d​i​c​i​n​e𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑛𝑒medicine he takes, it’s not reasonable to seperate r​e​a​c​t​i​o​n𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛reaction from m​e​d​i​c​i​n​e𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑛𝑒medicine. Despite the remarkable performance improvement, n-ary facts in these deep models still suffer from non-integrity issue. Moreover, deep models always sustain relatively high computational complexity. HSimplE9 and HyPE9 are convolutional models, but they can only deal with 2-ary to 6-ary data. The tensor decomposition based model GTED0 also sustains inflexibility issue, it’s only applicable to 3-ary and 4-ary facts. Moreover, the three models don’t explicitly distinguish entities within and beyond triple, neglecting the importance of the primary triple. In this work, we represent an n-ary fact as a whole, keeping the integrity of the fact and maintain the vital role that the primary triple plays in an n-ary fact. Recently, advance in binary link prediction task illustrates that hyperbolic Poincaré model shows superiority and lower complexity over its counterparts1. We further learn that Poincaré ball excels in representing knowledge with hierarchy for the exponential growth of distance on the boundary of the hyperbolic space. As shown in Figure 1, containing rich geometric structures, a Poincaré ball is endowed with strong expressiveness in representing complex graph-structured data. It’s also notable that hyperbolic Poincaré embedding method has an edge in complexity in that it involves much less\nmatrix addition and multiplication operations compared to existing deep models. To our konwledge, it has not been studied in hyper-relational KG. Considering the expressiveness and low complexity, we deem that hyperbolic Poincaré embedding method, which to the best of our knowledge has not been studied in hyper-relational KGs yet, is promising for a both efficient and effective model. In this work, we propose a generalized hyperbolic Poincaré embedding framework that is appilicable to arbitary arity facts, termed as HYPER2.\nIn HYPER2, all entities are first randomly initialized on the hyperbolic space, then through vector projection between hyperbolic space and tangent space and aggregation of information on the tangent space, HYPER2 captures the interaction between the primary triple and the affiliated entities. HYPER2 achieves SOTA on two representative hyper-relational datasets, improving HITS@1, HITS@10, MRR by 34.5%, 21.9%, 29.1% on WikiPeople, and 23.1%, 14.4%, 18.9% on JF17K respectively, which validates the effectiveness and superiority of our model. Besides, HYPER2 is less computationally complicated, 49-61 times quicker in comparison with its analogues. Moreover,\nour experiments verify literals (numeric values, date-time instances or other string) impede embedding learning. Our contribution can be summarized as follows: HYPER2 employs hyper-relation to totally shrink from tearing an n-ary facts into smaller tuples, simultaneously considering the vital role that the primary triple plays in an n-ary fact and the indecomposibility of some n-ary facts. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed HYPER2 is the first model that employs hyperbolic Poincaré ball for hyper-relational KGs, HYPER2 generalize hyperbolic Poincaré method from binary to arbitary arity facts, illustrating high flexibility. Extensive experiments on two representative hyper-relational KGs demonstrate that HYPER2 realizes superior performance to its counterparts, improving SOTA by a surprisingly large margin, demonstrating absolute superiority. We validate the side effect brought by literals in Wikipeople dataset. And we theoretically and experimentally compare the parameter size and the computational complexity of HYPER2 against several previous best-performing baselines. Experiments show our model greatly overwhelms its counterparts, unveiling low complexity.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Wikidata and Google’s Knowledge Graph power a plethora of downstream tasks ranging from recommendation systems to semantic search and from question answering to natural language understanding[ref]7.
