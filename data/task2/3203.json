      "content": "Paper Title: Positional Encoding Augmented GAN for the Assessment of Wind Flow for Pedestrian Comfort in Urban Areas\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhen designing urban spaces, there is a need to understand the wind environment before the buildings are built to ensure a comfortable environment for the inhabitants. This topic has received significant attention in wind engineering and the scientific literature. Today there are two main methods to analyze the wind environment; experiments in a wind tunnel and simulations using CFD   . Performing experiments is considered the most accurate method to evaluate the wind environment.\nCFD simulations are increasingly being accepted as a viable alternative to experiments, thanks to extensive efforts in improving the methodology and validating results against wind tunnel experiments and full-scale measurements. However, even though simulations can be cheaper than performing experiments, it still represents a significant cost. When designing a new building, it is desirable to see how small changes in the design change the wind flow patterns. Moving a structure closer to its neighbor or adjusting its height would require repeatedly re-running the whole CFD simulation or multiple simulations from several wind directions. In the early stages of the design process, the\nan architect might accept slightly lower accuracy in the wind predictions if this means a faster design iteration time. In that case, there might exist less time-consuming methods within the field of machine learning, and in particular, deep learning methods that can potentially allow a more interactive evaluation of the wind environment. There are several examples of the combination of CFD and deep learning in recent literature.\nCFDNet [ref]7 introduces a physical simulation and deep learning coupled framework for accelerating RANS simulations by adding an iterative refinement stage consisting of a CNN in-between the warmup and refinement stage of a physical solver. In this way, they significantly accelerate the convergence of the overall scheme. The model is tested on different geometries unseen during training to evaluate how well their method generalize. Experiments showed that the CFDNet still performed fine and was able to perform accurate predictions. This work indicates that combining physical models with data-driven machine learning models could be a promising approach for accelerating simulations.\nIn addition, [ref]8 compare the accuracy of physical solvers with surrogate models using a modified version of the U-Net architecture  trained in a supervised manner. In contrast to CFDNet, their method is an end-to-end surrogate entirely driven by the neural network. Leaving out the physical constraints is something they do intentionally and instead choose to focus on working with state-of-the-art CNN and executes detailed evaluations. One problem with models like these is that they can not guarantee that the predictions meet the necessary constraints of the traditional physics-based algorithms. On the other side, this makes it a more generic approach applicable for various other equations beyond RANS.\nSimilarly, [ref]9 shows how they input the SDF as input for a CNN autoencoder to train a surrogate model for CFD simulations around different shaped airfoils. SDF works efficiently with neural networks for shape learning and is widely used in applications as rendering and segmentation and extracting structural information of different geometries, essentially providing a universal representation of the different shapes. All the mentioned methods have in common that they have a multi-channel output consisting of velocity and pressure. In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks  has been shown to be an efficient unsupervised method for learning the underlying distribution of a given dataset. Different extensions of the original architecture have been proposed. StyleGAN , for example, is capable of learning to generate fake human faces indistinguishable from real faces. One could think that there exists a function that maps any geometrical shape to a version that exists its corresponding flow fields. The surrogate model ffsGAN presented in  is trying to do just that. They propose a model that leverages the property of cGANs combined with CNNs to directly establish a one-to-one mapping from a given supercritical airfoil to its corresponding flow field structure. Unlike other methods that use an encoder to map the input to lower-dimensional space, they have a way to parameterize the airfoils as a 14-dimensional vector.\nWhile their approach is promising, FlowGAN  shows how they customize U-Net as the generator to include the Reynolds number and angle of attack. The flow parameters are concatenated with the geometry parameters extracted by the encoder of U-Net before they are passed to an MLP network to perform a nonlinear input-output mapping. The output of the MLP network is what is being decoded by the generator network. In this way, they provide a method for generating solutions to flow fields in various conditions based on observations rather than re-training. Traditional CFD methods produce high-accuracy results, but they are computationally expensive and do not work well in the design process of new prototypes in a given domain. To obtain results, it often takes several hours or days, depending on the prototype’s complexity. Deep learning methods can help create an interactive tool for testing new designs, even when they are getting computationally hard for physical solvers. The experiments in  demonstrate that CNN can work as a surrogate model for physical solver both when given discrete 2D and 3D bluff shapes. These experiments differ from other papers mentioned, as they are focusing more on the interactive application aspect for prototype design of different kinds of bluff shapes.\nIn the 3D domain,  proposes an architecture based on residual CNN for CFD prediction using 3D convolutions, enabling them to offer designers an interactive tool for prototyping. The dataset they use consists of various geometries representing samples of urban structures. In this way, they can create an interactive tool that could be used for city planners. A unique feature of their tool is that they offer a network trained in reverse, where you input the target wind flow, and it outputs the urban volumes that will produce it. One of their limitations is that only one direction of the wind flow is considered. Usually, we should consider multiple directions to create a representative forecast.\nLastly,  proposes a regression model using Gaussian Process to predict how fluid flows around three-dimensional objects interactively. In general, it is challenging to handle detailed 3D shapes in a data-driven manner using machine learning approaches. It requires a consistent parameterization of the input and output of the model. To do this, they purpose PolyCube maps-based parametrization that can be computed at high rates and allow their method to work efficiently even when doing interactive design and optimization during prototyping.\n\nMore in detail, in our work, we formulate the wind flow prediction as an image-to-image translation problem , and we explore the potential of the most advanced GAN-based architectures for such a task. The main contributions of this work are as follows: We rephrase the problem from computing 3D flow fields using computational fluid dynamics to a 2D image-to-image translation-based problem on the building footprints to predict the flow field at pedestrian height level. We propose state-of-the-art GAN architectures for the image-to-image translation process. The generator can generate realistic-looking wind flows assessment conditioned on a given geometry input of various amounts of buildings. We perform a systematic comparison of the most advanced GANs experimenting on several new datasets of various bluff-shaped buildings generated using computational fluid dynamics methods. Further, we also perform an experimental study on buildings with different heights and a systematic generalization experiment to optimize a model on one of the datasets and investigate how the model performs on the others. We propose a novel extension of known image-to-image translation methods where we inject different positional information into the architectures using the signed distance function and coordinates of the Cartesian space seen by the convolutional filters. We conduct an ablation study, through experiments, to test the effect of different attention mechanisms for airflow prediction. We optimize models for a real scenario, using buildings from a built-up city environment. This allows us to analyze the problem at a more applied and complex scale than previous work. We organize the paper as follows. In section 2 we clarify the problem we are trying to solve while introducing the architectures’ implementation details and their corresponding objectives. In section 3 we introduce the dataset and metrics used for training and evaluating the models. Experimental results and discussion are given in section 4, and the conclusion is drawn in section 5.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: learning methods that can potentially allow a more interactive evaluation of the wind environment.
