      "content": "Paper Title: GPU-initiated Fine-grained Overlap of Collective Communication with Computation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo the best of our knowledge no prior work has addressed hiding All-to-All latency in DLRM using GPU-initiated communication. However, there have been prior research on optimizing DLRM, overlapping communication-computation using CPU-initiated networking, GPU-initiated communication for ML, and optimizing collective communication which we present in this section. Ever since the DLRM models were released , researchers have been proposing techniques to improve their execution performance and memory-efficiency. Mudigere et al. [ref]43 proposed Neo system which employs 4D parallelism strategy (table-wise, row-wise, column-wise, and data parallelism) for distributing embedding computations evenly across GPUs. Furthermore, they fuse embedding operators with their parameter update into single kernels to minimize kernel-launch overheads and memory requirements and employ software-managed caching mechanism to leverage hardware memory hierarchy. Their evaluations show that All-to-All latency is exposed and constitutes a significant portion (>35%) of distributed DLRM training execution time. Other research works have proposed ways to reduce memory consumed by embedding tables using compression [ref]50  and improving data layout by leveraging the asymmetrical access patterns of embedding tables [ref]28.\nHowever, in this paper, we try to address large All-to-All communication latency exposed in distributed DLRM training. We do so by fusing and overlapping All-to-All with embedding operations at finer granularity using GPU-initiated communication. Wang et. al  propose decomposing the original collective communication and its dependent computation into smaller pieces. The communication of an individual data shard can be overlapped with the computation of another. Our approach is conceptually similar to this as both aim at overlapping communication of a portion of data with the computation of another. However, unlike us, the approach proposed in   will result in higher number of kernel invocations where each sharded kernel is smaller than the original one. For the use case considered in  , the sharded kernels (corresponding to individual data shard) are sufficiently large to amortize the kernel invocation overhead but this is not always the case [ref]43. Further, their approach uses CPU resources to manage and schedule the sharded kernels and requires additional operations to combine the individual partial results. Our approach uses GPU-initiated networking to eliminate CPU resources for communication and leverages the application compute distribution across WGs to hide communication without requiring additional computation to merge results. Wang et. al.  propose using GPU-initiated networking to hide remote memory access latency in GNNs. While this work uses GPU-initiated communication, it focuses on optimizing irregular communication by interleaving and pipelining local neighbor aggregation with remote neighbour access. Their work targets a different problem than that addressed in this paper and thus require completely different optimizations and implementation. Unlike our approach which aims at hiding the collective communication latency. There have been efforts to reduce the collective latency. Cai et. al.  have proposed an approach to synthesize collective algorithms tailored for a specific hardware topology. Others   have proposed optimal communication schedule for specific collectives aimed at reducing contention and improving link utilization. These optimizations are orthogonal to the approach proposed in this work. Fusing kernels/layers/operators into a single operator to eliminate intermediate stores has been proposed in the past   and is widely prevalent in modern ML frameworks  . However, in existing approaches the kernels being fused together are exclusively compute operations. We instead propose fusing communication with computation as part of our approach.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: which we present in this section.
