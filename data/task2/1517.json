      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge Distillation Methods for Efficient Unsupervised Adaptation Across Multiple Domains\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTime complexity generally depends mostly on the CNN convolutional layers, while memory complexity (number of parameters) depends mostly on the fully connected layers.\nCurrently, one of the most popular ways to reduce CNN complexity is to apply pruning techniques [ref]19      , using either weight or filter-level pruning. Another popular strategy to lower the complexity is quantization   , which reduces the complexity by reducing the representation of weights into a lower precision, i.e., converting 64-bit float precision to an 8-bit integer. Low rank decomposition techniques   have also been employed to accelerate CNNs by decomposing weight tensor into lower rank approximation. Lastly, KD [ref]15   [ref]18 aims to transfer knowledge from a larger teacher model to a smaller student model, therefore, preserving teacher accuracy on the student, while reducing complexity. In this paper, we focus on KD based techniques on the intuition that a CNN can efficiently learn how to adapt to a target domain, improving its accuracy on target domain data. Also, we argue that by leveraging over-parametrization , our approach can provide a better generalization capacity than when applying UDA on a pruned CNN which has fewer parameters to optimize. Additionally, KD also provides a natural generalization for an MTDA setting where each teacher is responsible for a target domain. Two main approaches have been proposed for distilling a teacher’s knowledge to a student – either based on network outputs [ref]15 or on intermediate features . For example, a temperature-based softmax was used in [ref]15 to generate softer versions of the teacher network outputs, facilitating the learning of a student model. In contrast, Heo et al.  enforce similarities between the teacher and student models at intermediate features layers, by minimizing a partial L2 distance. In particular, if the value measures on the student model is smaller than the value of the teacher, and both are negative, then the result is set to 0. A margin ReLU is also employed since the authors argue that negative value from the network is also useful. Another work [ref]18 proposes to solve the problem of the gap between teacher and student by integrating a teaching assistant that serves as an intermediate student that first learns from the teacher then it will distill the information to the student using the output of its network.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: layers, while memory complexity (number of parameters) depends mostly on the fully connected layers.\nCurrently, one of the most popular ways to reduce CNN complexity is to apply pruning techniques [ref]19      , using either weight or filter-level pruning.
