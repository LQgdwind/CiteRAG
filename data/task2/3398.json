For instance, in this study, we take advantage of Blockchain UTXO accounting methods to construct a proxy for store-of-value. This approach could be seamlessly applied to other UTXO blockchains such as Bitcoin Cash,282828https://www.bitcoincash.org/whitepaper Dash,292929https://cryptoverze.com/dogecoin-whitepaper Dogecoin,303030https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/introduction/about.html Litecoin,313131https://www.allcryptowhitepapers.com/litecoin-whitepaper and Zcash.323232https://whitepaper.io/coin/zcash Moreover, our approach can adapt to the updates of blockchain mechanisms and generate further research findings. In recent years, cryptocurrencies based on proof-of-work have been criticized as a waste of energy. Most of the electricity consumed by miners is converted into hashing power to compute cryptographic puzzles instead of routing and executing transactions. To address this issue, proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain projects, such as EOS,333333https://www.allcryptowhitepapers.com/eos-whitepaper Tezos,343434https://wiki.tezosagora.org/whitepaper and Cosmos,353535https://v1.cosmos.network/resources/whitepaper have gained momentum in recent years. In the PoS protocol, a certain fraction of native tokens are staked in the system by validators (i.e., miners, see Saleh 2020 ). Validators do not need to solve cryptographic puzzles to win the block rewards. The more tokens staked by a validator, the higher the chance that the validator becomes a block maker and earns the block rewards. Moreover, PoS projects have a flexible token dilution rate. For example, the dilution rate is dynamically adjusted by the Cosmos system to achieve a 66.7% staking ratio. When the staking ratio drops below the target, the block rewards automatically increase to attract more tokens staked in the system and vice versa. In such a case, the staking ratio and the dilution rate as proxies for store-of-value would be interdependent. Besides store-of-value, other features unique to the crypto market such as the decentralization level , the network features of the peer-to-peer transactions , sentiments on blockchain security  and the upgrade of blockchain mechanisms 9  might also affect the values of cryptocurrency. It would be interesting to explore further in this direction. Like all other asset prices, cryptocurrency prices are also affected by macroeconomic development, which is beyond the scope of this paper. For example, on March 12, 2020, the cryptocurrency market crashed with the stock market and gold market due to the panic sale caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Bitcoin prices plunged by more than 60%, almost twice as much as the stock market (e.g., Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 Index). However, one and half months after the market collapse, the BTC price quickly recovered to its pre-crisis level while the stock market still stagnated at around 80% of its pre-crisis level. It would be interesting to study what unique attributes of the cryptocurrency market led to the different market trajectories and what the implications are for investment strategies. In the current paper, the indicators that we develop for cryptocurrency valuation are based on macro variables and functions of currency in monetary theory. However, every macro phenomenon is a manifestation of micro behavior in an aggregate form, which in general is derived from two micro facets: the choices of each individual based respectively on rationality or heuristic bias contingent on the state of the world. For the first, to model rational choices, each individual must envision at least all hypothetical scenarios in Decision under Ambiguity 6 and also form subjective probabilities for all possible scenarios in Decision under Uncertainty . However, since crypto-economics is rapidly evolving, both requirements are difficult if not far-fetched for the majority, which makes the problems more similar to decisions under ignorance  7 5 , a vastly uncultivated field even at the foundations of microeconomic theory. Second, little literature seeks to understand behavioral patterns of bounded rationality  8. For instance, Gemayel and Preda (2021)  find evidence of heuristic bias including disposition effect , self-attribution bias 4, and the gambler’s fallacy  among cryptocurrency traders. We envision the two directions as representing promising directions and the next frontiers for future research. Hey (2009) 3 envisions the fourth paradigm shift in scientific discoveries to be data-driven. Our study shows that interdisciplinary research in machine learning could verify the explainability of valuation ratios by establishing consistency for its theoretical implications in empirical results. To facilitate this future research, we distribute the trading algorithms as open-source software via Python Package Index  (PyPI).363636refer to the latest version: https://test.pypi.org/project/AlgorithmicTradingCV, and a related data science pipeline paper [ref]70.\n\nReference markers found: [70]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]70: algorithms as open-source software via Python Package Index  (PyPI).363636refer to the latest version: https://test.pypi.org/project/AlgorithmicTradingCV, and a related data science pipeline paper [ref]70.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
