      "content": "Paper Title: IM-META: Influence Maximization Using Node Metadata in Networks With Unknown Topology\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSocial networks that encode the relationships and interactions of individuals play a vital role as a medium for facilitating the sharing of ideas, thoughts, and information through the building of virtual networks and communities. Well-known applications of such social networks include viral marketing‚Äîfor example, a company would like to hire the most influential opinion leaders to advertise a new product. To this end, the so-called influence maximization (IM) problem that aims at identifying a set of seed nodes, leading to the maximum influence spread under given influence diffusion models, was introduced as a formalization . In addition to (viral) marketing in social networks, efficient solutions to the IM problem stand to benefit applications in numerous domains such as microfinance  and healthcare . In the original formulation of the IM problem, the topological structure of the underlying network in question is assumed to be fully known . In practice and despite the growing popularity of studies on IM, however, this assumption tends to be overly simplistic as the underlying network cannot be fully observed in many real-world applications of network analyses  . Although one could, in principle, invest further efforts into uncovering the complete network prior to the application of existing IM algorithms, the accumulation of a complete network structure is often prohibitively expensive, labor-intensive, or entirely impractical¬†. Even with the increasing availability of (social) network data from social media platforms, this source of information is not without limitations, not least due to privacy concerns [ref]6.\nConsequently, when working with graph data, one should assume that none or only a part of the network structure is available in practice  [ref]8  0. When confronted with the need to perform IM on networks that have such an unknown or partially known topology, a naturally arising question is therefore how one can identify a set of seed nodes, necessitating the network structure. Recent studies have addressed this question by allowing a small budget for node queries to surgically discover parts of the underlying network, while simultaneously aiming to identify a set of seed nodes from the explored subgraph that is expected to be as influential as the globally optimal seed set 1 2 3 4 5 6 . However, node metadata (i.e., node features), which can often be retrieved from various sources such as users‚Äô created content over given (social) networks 7 or even be inferred from users‚Äô individual behavior 8, are not fully considered in this problem despite the fact that they are more readily available than the relationship between individuals. Such metadata may then be leveraged to identify relations that are likely to exist. For example, in co-authorship networks, one might take advantage of the keywords in each author‚Äôs publications to infer a topical relationship between authors. In the IM problem for HIV awareness in homeless youth , metadata such as the individual‚Äôs name, age, and familial background among the homeless demographic as well as individuals can be readily gathered due to the mandatory registration process at welfare centers, which is necessitated for the disbursement of monthly allowances. Motivated by the observation that the collection of metadata for nodes is cost-effective, we propose a solution for real-world applications of IM in incomplete (social) network settings where the underlying network Gùê∫G is initially unknown.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: impractical¬†.
