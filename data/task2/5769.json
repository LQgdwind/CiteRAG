      "content": "Paper Title: GNN-Ensemble: Towards Random Decision Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAt last, we measure the adversarial robustness of GNN-Ensemble. We conduct the experiment using DeepRobust444https://github.com/DSE-MSU/DeepRobust and consider four graph evasion attacks : RL-S2V [ref]38, PGD [ref]39, GF-Attack , and IG-FGSM [ref]41. All four attacks perturb the input graph by adding and deleting edges. IG-FGSM, in addition, modifies the features as well. We set the maximum perturbation threshold to 10%, that is, allow the attacker to add or delete at most 10% of the edges. To satisfy the imperceptibility requirement of adversarial attacks, the attacker can only modify such a limited percentage of nodes or edges. We compare GNN-Ensemble with three representative adversarial defense approaches: GCN-SVD , GCN-Jaccard [ref]41 and ProGNN . These defense approaches are applied in their default settings in DeepRobust.\nThis set of experiments are conducted on Cora and PubMed under the transductive setting.\nTable VII shows the adversarial robustness results. We make three observations: For all four adversarial attacks on the graph, GNN-Ensemble consistently and significantly outperforms the four defense methods on both datasets. Since the attacker is limited to modifying at most 10% of the edges, the majority of the nodes and edges remain unchanged during the adversarial attack. Since GNN-Ensemble explores the structural information of the graph and uses multiple subgraphs of the original graph for learning and prediction, subgraphs containing the victim node will be less likely to be impacted by the maliciously modified edges. Therefore, GNN-Ensemble can achieve better classification performance on the victim nodes in an adversarially sabotaged graph. GNN-Ensemble is very effective in mitigating the adversarial effect of IG-FGSM, where attacks occur by\nadding and deleting edges as well as modifying features. GNN-Ensemble trains the base GNN models on sampled substructures and subfeatures of the original graph. The adversarial effect is much less eminent in the sampled subspaces. Therefore, GNN-Ensemble is very robust to adversarial attacks. Due to the different optimization goals under every possible combination of substructure and subfeatures, it now becomes very difficult to make adversarial examples via optimizing the graph in favor of the attackers. Therefore, different base models in GNN-Ensemble can hardly be jointly optimized to perform the cross-model attack .\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: At last, we measure the adversarial robustness of GNN-Ensemble.
