Cases (i)–(ix) follows from the fact that each of the classes of (H1,H2)subscript𝐻1subscript𝐻2(H_{1},H_{2})-free graphs in these cases has bounded clique-width and that clique-width is quickly computable for general graphs .\nFor Case (i) we also refer to Theorem 3.19.\nBoundedness of clique-width has been proven for Case (ii) as follows: in  for K1,3+3​P1subscript𝐾133subscript𝑃1K_{1,3}+\\nobreak 3P_{1}; in  for K1,3+P2subscript𝐾13subscript𝑃2K_{1,3}+\\nobreak P_{2}; in  for P1+P2+P3subscript𝑃1subscript𝑃2subscript𝑃3P_{1}+P_{2}+P_{3} and P1+P5subscript𝑃1subscript𝑃5P_{1}+P_{5}; in  for P1+S1,1,2subscript𝑃1subscript𝑆112P_{1}+\\nobreak S_{1,1,2}; in  for P2+P4subscript𝑃2subscript𝑃4P_{2}+P_{4}; in  for P6subscript𝑃6P_{6}; in  for S1,1,3subscript𝑆113S_{1,1,3}; and in  for S1,2,2subscript𝑆122S_{1,2,2}. It has been proven for Case (iv) as follows: in  for P1+2​P2subscript𝑃12subscript𝑃2P_{1}+2P_{2}; and in  for 3​P1+P23subscript𝑃1subscript𝑃23P_{1}+P_{2} and P2+P3subscript𝑃2subscript𝑃3P_{2}+P_{3}. It has been been proven for Case (vi) as follows: in  for P1+P4subscript𝑃1subscript𝑃4P_{1}+P_{4}; and in  for P5subscript𝑃5P_{5}. It has been proven for Case (viii) and (ix) in   and , respectively. Cases (iii), (v), (vii) follow from Cases (ii), (iv) and (vi), respectively, after recalling that the clique-width of a class of (H1,H2)subscript𝐻1subscript𝐻2(H_{1},H_{2})-free graphs is bounded if and only if the clique-width of the class of (H1¯,H2¯)¯subscript𝐻1¯subscript𝐻2\\left(\\overline{H_{1}},\\overline{H_{2}}\\right)-free graphs is bounded [ref]38.\nCases (x) and (xi) follow from Theorems 4.13 and 4.9 respectively.\nCase (xii) has been proven in .\nCases (xiii)–(xv) follow from Theorems 4.1–4.5, respectively. For our second summary theorem, we turn to the unbounded cases.\nWe let 𝒮𝒮{\\cal S} be the class of graphs every connected component of which is either a subdivided claw or a path.\nWe let 𝒩𝒩{\\cal N} denote the class of graphs that contain a connected component with\neither a cycle of length at least 444 or\nat least two (not necessarily vertex-disjoint) triangles; note, for example, that 𝒩𝒩{\\cal N} contains C4subscript𝐶4C_{4}, 𝖽𝗂𝖺𝗆𝗈𝗇𝖽𝖽𝗂𝖺𝗆𝗈𝗇𝖽{\\sf diamond}, and K4subscript𝐾4K_{4}. For graphs H1subscript𝐻1H_{1} and H2subscript𝐻2H_{2}, the class of (H1,H2)subscript𝐻1subscript𝐻2(H_{1},H_{2})-free graphs has unbounded mim-width if one of the following holds: H1∉𝒮subscript𝐻1𝒮H_{1}\\notin{\\cal S} and H2∉𝒮subscript𝐻2𝒮H_{2}\\notin{\\cal S}, H1⊇iC3subscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝑖subscript𝐻1subscript𝐶3H_{1}\\supseteq_{i}C_{3} and H2⊇iP3+P6subscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝑖subscript𝐻2subscript𝑃3subscript𝑃6H_{2}\\supseteq_{i}P_{3}+P_{6}, P8subscript𝑃8P_{8} or S1,1,5subscript𝑆115S_{1,1,5}, H1⊇iK1,3subscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝑖subscript𝐻1subscript𝐾13H_{1}\\supseteq_{i}K_{1,3} and H2∈𝒩subscript𝐻2𝒩H_{2}\\in{\\cal N}, H1⊇i𝖽𝗂𝖺𝗆𝗈𝗇𝖽subscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝑖subscript𝐻1𝖽𝗂𝖺𝗆𝗈𝗇𝖽H_{1}\\supseteq_{i}{\\sf diamond} and H2⊇i5​P1subscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝑖subscript𝐻25subscript𝑃1H_{2}\\supseteq_{i}5P_{1}, P2+P4subscript𝑃2subscript𝑃4P_{2}+P_{4}, 2​P32subscript𝑃32P_{3} or P6subscript𝑃6P_{6}, H1⊇i3​P1subscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝑖subscript𝐻13subscript𝑃1H_{1}\\supseteq_{i}3P_{1} and H2⊇i3​P1subscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝑖subscript𝐻23subscript𝑃1H_{2}\\supseteq_{i}3P_{1}, C5subscript𝐶5C_{5} or C2​s+1¯¯subscript𝐶2𝑠1\\overline{C_{2s+1}} for s≥3𝑠3s\\geq 3, H1⊇i4​P1subscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝑖subscript𝐻14subscript𝑃1H_{1}\\supseteq_{i}4P_{1} and H2⊇i𝗀𝖾𝗆subscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝑖subscript𝐻2𝗀𝖾𝗆H_{2}\\supseteq_{i}{\\sf gem}, 3​P1+P2¯¯3subscript𝑃1subscript𝑃2\\overline{3P_{1}+P_{2}} or P1+2​P2¯¯subscript𝑃12subscript𝑃2\\overline{P_{1}+2P_{2}}, H1⊇i2​P2subscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝑖subscript𝐻12subscript𝑃2H_{1}\\supseteq_{i}2P_{2} and H2⊇iC4subscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝑖subscript𝐻2subscript𝐶4H_{2}\\supseteq_{i}C_{4}, C5subscript𝐶5C_{5}, K1,4subscript𝐾14K_{1,4}, 2​P22subscript𝑃22P_{2}, 3​P1+P2¯¯3subscript𝑃1subscript𝑃2\\overline{3P_{1}+P_{2}} or 𝗌𝗎𝗇tsubscript𝗌𝗎𝗇𝑡{\\sf sun}_{t} for t≥3𝑡3t\\geq 3, or H1⊇iK4subscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝑖subscript𝐻1subscript𝐾4H_{1}\\supseteq_{i}K_{4} and H2⊇iP2+P4subscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝑖subscript𝐻2subscript𝑃2subscript𝑃4H_{2}\\supseteq_{i}P_{2}+P_{4} or P6subscript𝑃6P_{6}. Cases (i) and (iii) follow from Theorem 3.12 and Lemma 3.15, respectively, possibly after applying Lemma 3.2 a sufficient number of times. All three subcases of Case (ii) follows from Theorem 5.8. The first subcase of Case (iv) follows from Theorem 5.1, the second one follows from Theorem 5.15, the third one follows from Theorem 5.11 and the fourth one follows from Theorem 5.15. All three subcases of Case (v) follow from Lemma 3.18. Case (vi) follows from Theorems 5.9 and 5.3. All subcases of Case (vii) follow from Lemma 3.16.\nCase (viii) follows from Theorem 5.15. We note that the situation for the unbounded cases is again different from the situation for the unbounded cases of clique-width. For example, (H1,H2)subscript𝐻1subscript𝐻2(H_{1},H_{2})-free graphs have unbounded clique-width if both H1¯∉𝒮¯subscript𝐻1𝒮\\overline{H_{1}}\\notin{\\cal S} and H2¯∉𝒮¯subscript𝐻2𝒮\\overline{H_{2}}\\notin{\\cal S} (see, for example, ). Take,\nfor instance,\nH1=4​P1subscript𝐻14subscript𝑃1H_{1}=4P_{1} and H2=2​P2subscript𝐻22subscript𝑃2H_{2}=2P_{2}. Then H1¯=K4¯subscript𝐻1subscript𝐾4\\overline{H_{1}}=K_{4} and H2¯=C4¯subscript𝐻2subscript𝐶4\\overline{H_{2}}=C_{4}, and thus\nH1¯∉𝒮¯subscript𝐻1𝒮\\overline{H_{1}}\\notin{\\cal S} and H2¯∉𝒮¯subscript𝐻2𝒮\\overline{H_{2}}\\notin{\\cal S}, so (H1,H2)subscript𝐻1subscript𝐻2(H_{1},H_{2})-free graphs have unbounded clique-width. However, by Theorem 6.1-(xiii), (H1,H2)subscript𝐻1subscript𝐻2(H_{1},H_{2})-free graphs have bounded mim-width.\nAs (H1¯,H2¯)¯subscript𝐻1¯subscript𝐻2(\\overline{H_{1}},\\overline{H_{2}})-free graphs have unbounded mim-width by Theorem 6.3-(i),\nthis example also shows that the complementation operation, a standard tool for working with clique-width, does not preserve mim-width. Consequently,\nfor mim-width there are many more open cases than the only five open cases for clique-width .\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: graphs is bounded if and only if the clique-width of the class of (H1¯,H2¯)¯subscript𝐻1¯subscript𝐻2\\left(\\overline{H_{1}},\\overline{H_{2}}\\right)-free graphs is bounded [ref]38.\nCases (x) and (xi) follow from Theorems 4.13 and 4.9 respectively.\nCase (xii) has been proven in .\nCases (xiii)–(xv) follow from Theorems 4.1–4.5, respectively.
