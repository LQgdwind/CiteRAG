      "content": "Paper Title: Uncertainty Estimation for Language Reward Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur work seeks to develop techniques for uncertainty estimation and active learning for fine-tuning pre-trained language models.\nUncertainty estimation  and active learning  are both well-established fields, while fine-tuning language models is a new but popular area of research [ref]5.\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge the only prior work for uncertainty in fine-tuned language models is limited to calibrating the total uncertainty of these models 0  [ref]21 . While calibrated total uncertainty is helpful, many applications (such as active learning) depend on separately estimating aleatoric (or data) uncertainty and epistemic (or model) uncertainty .\nAleatoric uncertainty is due to irreducible randomness in the data generating process.\nBy contrast, epistemic uncertainty is due to a lack of knowledge and could be reduced by seeing more data points. Uncertainty estimation for deep learning  seeks to provide well-calibrated estimates of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty for neural networks.\nEnsembles are a simple and popular approach : training multiple models, with their disagreement estimating model uncertainty.\nThey have been found to be a strong baseline in a variety of applications   0 , although they have been criticized on both a theoretical  and empirical  basis.\nHypermodels are a related approach  , generating the weights of another network as a function of some noise variable, effectively simulating a very large ensemble.\nBayesian neural networks are an alternative class of approaches that learn a distribution over the weights of a neural network  . Active learning  seeks to achieve greater sample efficiency by having the algorithm select which data points to ask a human annotator to label.\nOne effective heuristic selects the point with maximal epistemic uncertainty, i.e. the point the model is most unsure about, making active learning and uncertainty estimation intricately connected.\nThis is related to the notion of query-by-committee 0: selecting points where a “committee” of models most disagree, whether a literal ensemble of models or a generative model class such as a hypermodel or Bayesian neural network. It is, however, possible to perform active learning without any explicit notion of epistemic uncertainty.\nFor example, uncertainty sampling  simply queries the point which a single model is least confident in the classification of, regardless of whether this is due to epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty.\nMoreover, there are also methods that select the points based on the expected change to the model, e.g. 9), and those that seek to minimize the variance over model parameters, e.g. ). In this paper, we focus on learning reward functions from preference comparisons.\nThis typically requires collecting de novo human preference comparisons for the task at hand – an expensive and time-consuming process.\nPrior work has therefore applied active learning to this setting to reduce the size of the dataset required.\n propose an ensemble-based method similar to our approach, finding it improves sample efficiency in around three quarters of the continuous control and Atari tasks tested.\nMore sophisticated approaches have also been developed, but are difficult to scale and have only been demonstrated in low-dimensional environments 5 . An alternative way to boost sample efficiency is to use unsupervised learning to leverage vast unlabeled datasets 2 .\nThese foundation models can then be fine-tuned on labeled data to perform a particular task [ref]5.\nCrucially, the number of labels required for fine-tuning is far smaller than that of training a model from scratch. This fine-tuning approach has been successfully applied to learning natural language tasks from preference comparisons.\n fine-tune language models to continue a prompt in a particular style, producing completions that users prefer to the original model 88% of the time after only 5,000 comparisons.\nThey also train the model to summarize documents, but find it only learns naive copying behavior.\n3 refine this work with improved data collection, producing summaries that outperform human reference summaries after less than 100,000 comparisons. This is a relatively small amount of data, and models can do tolerably well with an order of magnitude less data than this.\nThe use of a foundation model therefore clearly massively improves sample efficiency.\nOn the other hand, 100,000 comparisons is still substantial, representing over 4 years of full-time work!111Assuming 5 minutes per comparison, and 40 hours a week for 52 weeks a year.\nIt is therefore tempting to combine active learning with the use of a foundation model, to improve sample efficiency beyond what either method can do alone.\nWhile prior work has attempted to leverage language models to automate part of the labeling process 8 , we are not aware of any work fine-tuning language models that has tried actively selecting points for human feedback.\nWe seek to fill this gap in the literature in the remainder of the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: for fine-tuning pre-trained language models.\nUncertainty estimation  and active learning  are both well-established fields, while fine-tuning language models is a new but popular area of research [ref]5.\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge the only prior work for uncertainty in fine-tuned language models is limited to calibrating the total uncertainty of these models 0  [ref]21 .
