Large-scale diffusion models, such as Imagen , DALL⋅⋅\\cdotE2, and Stable Diffusion , have greatly enhanced the ability to generate images from plain text, known as text-to-image synthesis. Naturally, recent works   [ref]4 [ref]5 [ref]9  have attempted to adapt text-guided diffusion models to real image editing, aiming to exploit their rich and diverse semantic knowledge. A slew of studies     propose learning a unique word for a given object and fine-tuning the diffusion models case-specifically for different text prompts. These methods usually introduce a case-specific optimization process, which may limit their applications in real time. Another liner of research focuses on designing optimization-free methods [ref]5   [ref]4 [ref]9 , which require no fine-tuning or optimization and can be easily extended to any pre-trained diffusion models. These methods usually apply the diffusion process first on the input image and then conduct the\ndenoising procedure conditioned on both the input image and text guidance. To preserve details of original images, they often spatially blend noised versions of the input image with the text-guided diffusion latent variables at each time step, using either a user-provided mask [ref]5 [ref]4  or self-predicted one [ref]9. Notably, Prompt-to-Prompt  controls the editing of synthesized images by manipulating the cross-attention maps; however, its editing ability is limited when applied to real images. When combined with Null-text inversion , an accurate inversion technique and thus facilitate an intuitive text-based modification of the image, Prompt-to-Prompt  can be extended to real image editing. This paper focuses on developing an optimization-free method for image editing, which can be applied to any pre-trained diffusion models and completes image editing within approximately 10 seconds.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: models, such as Imagen , DALL⋅⋅\\cdotE2, and Stable Diffusion , have greatly enhanced the ability to generate images from plain text, known as text-to-image synthesis.
