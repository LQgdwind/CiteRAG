      "content": "Paper Title: Modality-Aware Negative Sampling for Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Embedding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNegative sampling (NS) aims to generate negative triples which donâ€™t appear in existing KGs. Those negative triples will participate in the training process of KGE models by contrasting them with positive triples. Therefore, many NS methods are proposed to generate high-quality negative samples. Normal NS [ref]7 randomly replaces the head or tail entity with another entity with the same probabilities. KBGAN  and IGAN  apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [ref]32 to select harder negative samples. NSCaching [ref]15 store the high-quality negative triples with cache during training to achieve efficient sampling. NS-KGE  employs a unified square loss to avoid NS during training. It is called no-sampling but all-sampling. SANS  utilize the graph structure to sample high-quality negative samples. CAKE  construct commonsense from KGs to guide NS. EANS  propose a clustering-based negative sampling strategy with an auxiliary loss function. VBKGC  propose a twins negative sampling method for different parts of the score function. However, many of the NS methods have their shortcomings which leads to the dilemma of NS for MMKGE. On the one hand, they are not lightweight enough as extra modules are introduced in the models. On the other hand, they are designed for unimodal knowledge graph embedding.\nSuch a strategy performs well in general KGE because each entity has only one structural embedding. As many MMKGE models define multiple embeddings for each entity, the alignment between different embeddings is also significant but ignored by existing methods.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: triples will participate in the training process of KGE models by contrasting them with positive triples. Therefore, many NS methods are proposed to generate high-quality negative samples. Normal NS [ref]7 randomly replaces the head or tail entity with another entity with the same probabilities.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
