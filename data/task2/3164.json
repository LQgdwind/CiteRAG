      "content": "Paper Title: Phase Transition of the 3-Majority Dynamics with Uniform Communication Noise\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe authors of  initiate the study of the consensus problem in the presence of communication noise. They consider the Vicsek model , in which they introduce a noise feature and a notion of robust consensus. Subsequently, dynamics for the consensus problem with noisy communications have received considerable attention. In particular, as mentioned in the introduction, this direction is motivated, among many reasons, by the desire to find models for the consensus problem in natural phenomena [ref]23. The communication noise studied in this type of problem can be devided in two types: uniform (or unbiased) and non-uniform (or biased). The uniform case wants to capture errors in communications between agents in real-world scenarios. The non-uniform communication noise instead describes the case in which agents have a preferred opinion.\nThe authors of [ref]23 are the first to explicitly focus on the uniform noise model. In detail, they study the broadcast and the majority consensus problem when the opinion set is binary. In their model of noise, every bit in every exchanged message is flipped independently with some probability smaller than 1/2121/2. As a result, the authors give natural protocols that solve the aforementioned problems efficiently. The work  generalizes the above study to opinion sets of any cardinality. As for the non-uniform communication noise case, in  it is considered the h‚Ñéh-Majority dynamics with a binary opinion set {alpha,beta}alphabeta\\{\\textsc{alpha},\\textsc{beta}\\}, with a probability pùëùp that any received message is flipped towards a fixed preferred opinion, say beta, while with probability 1‚àíp1ùëù1-p the former message keeps intact. They suppose there is an initial majority agreeing on alpha, and they analyze the time of disruption, that is the time the initial majority is subverted. They prove there exists a threshold value p‚ãÜsuperscriptùëù‚ãÜp^{\\star} (which depends on h‚Ñéh), such that 1) if p<p‚ãÜùëùsuperscriptùëù‚ãÜp<p^{\\star}, the time of disruption is at least polynomial, w.h.p., and 2) if p>p‚ãÜùëùsuperscriptùëù‚ãÜp>p^{\\star}, the time of disruption is constant, w.h.p. Their result holds for any sufficiently dense graph. We remark that our work differs from  in that there is no preferred opinion, and the noise affecting communications may result in any possible opinion. The noise feature affecting opinion dynamics has been shown to be equivalent to a model without noise, in which communities of stubborn agents (i.e., they never change opinion) are added to the network . Hence, we discuss some previous works that consider such a model. In , the authors focus on the voter model, and show that the presence stubborn agents with opposite opinions precludes the convergence to consensus. The work  studies the asynchronous voter rule and the asynchronous majority rule dynamics with Poisson clocks, when the opinion set is binary using mean-field techniques, in presence of agents that either have a probability (which depends on their current opinion) not to update when the clock ticks, or are stubborn. In the second case, which directly relates with our work, they show that for the 3-Majority dynamics there are either one or two possible stable equilibrium, depending on the sizes of the stubborn communities, which are reached in logarithmic time. If the two sizes are close between each other and not too large, then agreement on both opinions is possible in the steady state. Otherwise, either no agreement is possible, or the process converges to an agreement towards a single opinion (that of the largest stubborn community). This work includes the case in which the two stubborn communities have equal size, which corresponds to the uniform communication noise model. Nevertheless, we have some crucial differences: first of all, our work consider the synchronous version of the 3-Majority dynamics, which cannot be analyzed with the same tools. Indeed, in each update round, the synchronous model has non-zero probability to reach any of the two monochromatic configurations. This feature is absent in the asynchronous version, since at each update, with probability equal to 1, at most one agent can change opinion. Furthermore, we want to remark that mean-field arguments do not capture important aspects of the process, such as metastability, which in  is shown only through simulations. For example, the actual behavior of the process in the long-term is oscillation in a very small interval around the equilibrium values, spending long times in those intervals, and eventually switching between the two. We characterize the width of the oscillation interval and show there is high probability of convergence, providing also a lower bound on the time the process spends in the equilibrium interval.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: considerable attention.
