If we set λ=1𝜆1\\lambda=1, β=C1​d​H​ι𝛽subscript𝐶1𝑑𝐻𝜄\\beta=C_{1}dH\\sqrt{\\iota} in Algorithm 1 where ι=log⁡(log⁡(|𝒜|)​4​d​T/p)𝜄𝒜4𝑑𝑇𝑝\\iota=\\log(\\log(|\\mathcal{A}|)4dT/p) for some absolute constant C1subscript𝐶1C_{1}. With probability (1−p)1𝑝(1-p), for some absolute constants C𝐶C, and C′superscript𝐶′C^{\\prime}. We remark the difference with the existing results. Since ξ=2​H/γ𝜉2𝐻𝛾\\xi=2H/\\gamma (by Definition 3), our result indicates that our approach obtains 𝒪~​(d3​H3​T)~𝒪superscript𝑑3superscript𝐻3𝑇\\mathcal{\\tilde{O}}(\\sqrt{d^{3}H^{3}T}) regret and the same order of constraint violation where 𝒪~~𝒪\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}} absorbs logarithmic factor on T𝑇T. The regret and constraint violation are sub-linear in T𝑇T, and similar dependence is observed in  [ref]7. Also note that compared to the unconstrained case 4, there is an additional log(|𝒜|))\\log(|\\mathcal{A}|)) factor in the value of ι𝜄\\iota which arises because we use soft-max policy instead of the greedy policy which adds to the covering number. The regret and constraint violation do not depend on the dimension of the state space, rather, it depends on the dimension of the feature space. To the best of our knowledge this is the first result which shows both 𝒪~​(T)~𝒪𝑇\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T}) regret and constraint violation in the model-free set up (tabular or linear) without requiring a simulator.  Comparison with [ref]7: Compared to [ref]7 which also considers linear function approximation (however, it considers linear kernel MDP rather linear MDP) we improve the result in [ref]7 by a factor of H𝐻H.\nSecond, compared to [ref]7, which is a model-based policy-based algorithm, ours is a model-free value-based algorithm. Due to this, the above uniform concentration challenge does not exist in [ref]7. Moreover, our model-free algorithm also enjoys an easy implementation and improved computation efficiency since it does not estimate the next step expected value function as in [ref]7 which requires an integration oracle to compute a d𝑑d-dimensional integration at every step. [ref]7 also needs to store the previous policies and estimated value functions, hence, it needs O​(T)𝑂𝑇O(T) additional space complexity. We have an additional d𝑑\\sqrt{d} factor in front of the regret and constraint violation. Similar difference in regret is also observed between the model-based linear kernel unconstrained MDP  and model-free linear unconstrained MDP 4 even in the unconstrained case. Similar to the discussion in Section 3.1 on [ref]23, our result directly translates to a sample complexity guarantee (or, PAC guarantee). For example, we can learn a policy π𝜋\\pi such that Vr,1π∗​(x1)−Vr,1π​(x1)≤ϵsubscriptsuperscript𝑉superscript𝜋𝑟1subscript𝑥1subscriptsuperscript𝑉𝜋𝑟1subscript𝑥1italic-ϵV^{\\pi^{*}}_{r,1}(x_{1})-V^{\\pi}_{r,1}(x_{1})\\leq\\epsilon, and b−Vg,1π​(x1)≤ϵ𝑏subscriptsuperscript𝑉𝜋𝑔1subscript𝑥1italic-ϵb-V^{\\pi}_{g,1}(x_{1})\\leq\\epsilon after 𝒪~​(d3​H4/ϵ2)~𝒪superscript𝑑3superscript𝐻4superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^{3}H^{4}/\\epsilon^{2}) number of samples. Here, the policy π𝜋\\pi is obtained after running Algorithm 1 for 𝒪~​(d3​H3/ϵ2)~𝒪superscript𝑑3superscript𝐻3superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^{3}H^{3}/\\epsilon^{2}) number of episodes, and then selecting policy πksubscript𝜋𝑘\\pi_{k} with probability 1/K1𝐾1/K for any k∈[K]𝑘delimited-[]𝐾k\\in[K]. Recently,  proposed an algorithm with provable sample complexity guarantee for linear CMDP. However, the regret and violation guarantees are different from the sample complexity guarantees as the former ones are any time guarantee. The proposed algorithms are different since the goal is different. In particular, the uniform concentration bound challenge does not appear there. Note that using the explore-then-commit algorithm [ref]23, one can achieve 𝒪~​(T2/3)~𝒪superscript𝑇23\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3}) regret for large T𝑇T (from 𝒪~​(1/ϵ2)~𝒪1superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\epsilon^{2}) sample complexity bound achieved in ) which is worse than ours. Additionally, we achieve zero violation (Remark 2) while maintaining the same order of regret with respect to T𝑇T.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: same order of constraint violation where 𝒪~~𝒪\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}} absorbs logarithmic factor on T𝑇T.
