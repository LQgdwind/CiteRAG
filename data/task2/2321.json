      "content": "Paper Title: Depth-Aware Multi-Grid Deep Homography Estimation with Contextual Correlation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince Warped MS-COCO is a synthetic dataset without parallax, we only compare our solution with other single homography solutions. Besides, we modify the third pyramid level of the regression network to predict a single homography instead of the multi-homography for fairness. We train our network in a supervised manner because of the availability of the ground truth. We first compare ours with traditional feature-based solutions. As shown in Table II, we choose various feature descriptors, e.g.formulae-sequenceùëíùëîe.g. SIFT , ORB , BRISK  and SOSNet [ref]12, and different outliers rejection algorithms, e.g.formulae-sequenceùëíùëîe.g. RANSAC , MAGSAC [ref]14, MAGSAC++ , composing 12 distinct solutions. Of these feature descriptors, SOSNet is adopted to replace the local descriptors of SIFT with deep learning features. Then we compare ours with deep learnig-based solutions, e.g.formulae-sequenceùëíùëîe.g. DHN , UDHN [ref]17, CA-DHN , LB-DHN  and LB-UDHN . All the learning solutions including ours are trained in this dataset. We adopt 4-pt homography RMSE from [ref]17  as the metric to evaluate all the above solutions. Formally, we divide the testing results into 3 levels according to the performance ‚Äî easy (top 0-30%), moderate (top 30-60%), and hard (top 60-100%). I3√ó3subscriptùêº33I_{3\\times 3} refers to a 3√ó3333\\times 3 identity matrix as a ‚Äúno-warping‚Äô homography for the reference. The results are shown in Table II, where FùêπF indicates the performance of the solution is worse than that of I3√ó3subscriptùêº33I_{3\\times 3}. Observed from this table, it is evident to conclude that: (1) Our network outperforms other solutions, including traditional and deep learning algorithms in all cases (‚Äúeasy‚Äù, ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù, and ‚Äúhard‚Äù). (2) The deep learning solutions are more robust since they are superior to traditional solutions in ‚Äúhard‚Äù columns. This advantage benefits from the robust feature extraction ability of CNNs. In the experiment, we do not compare ours with   because they are essentially template matching algorithms. Specifically, they will take a big reference image and a small template image as inputs in these methods, where the overlap rates between the inputs can be 100%. In contrast, these compared methods and ours deal with inputs with a relatively low overlap rate.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: ground truth. We first compare ours with traditional feature-based solutions. As shown in Table II, we choose various feature descriptors, e.g.formulae-sequenceùëíùëîe.g. SIFT , ORB , BRISK  and SOSNet [ref]12, and different outliers rejection algorithms, e.g.formulae-sequenceùëíùëîe.g. RANSAC , MAGSAC [ref]14, MAGSAC++ , composing 12 distinct solutions.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
