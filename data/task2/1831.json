A desirable property of every explanation map is that it is non-random and highlights only the relevant regions in the image and no more. Nevertheless, the question arises on what is the target of explanations. In most cases the target is a human and they are often not AI experts. Therefore, many methods use a qualitative assessment based on human inspection to evaluate and compare different maps. To evaluate the Grad-CAM maps, the authors of  conduct user surveys to find which maps and models they find reliable.\nCruciani et al.[ref]54 demonstrate the usefulness of LRP to visualize relevant features on brain magnetic resonance imaging modality (MRI) for multiple sclerosis classification. It is observed that the LRP heat maps are sparse and not always as intuitive which is also illustrated by Fig. 10. It is therefore important to consider the user, who will be using the maps while choosing a method to explain a network. For the domain of medical images, the specialist might require a map that provides holistic explanations for them to be able to interpret and trust the network decision. Although human measurements on the quality of these maps are useful, they are time-consuming, could introduce bias and inaccurate evaluations[ref]55. Another way to evaluate explainers consists of comparing the explanation maps with human understanding of visual content. The objective way to perform this is by calculating the comparison metrics between explanation maps and Gaze Fixation Density Maps (GFDMs) of human experts performing the same visual classification task as the trained network. This can also be done by a comparison of explanation maps and important regions in the images identified by human experts by manual contouring. Mohseni et al. perform a similar experiment. The final goal of explanations is to increase a user’s trust in AI systems and especially for image classification tasks in our case. Accordingly, Mohseni et al. observe that providing nonsensical explanations (i.e., those that do not align with users’ expectations) may harm the users’ reported trust and observed reliance on the system. Thus, in our experiments for an initial evaluation of the methods presented in this paper, we follow the strategy of comparison of explanation maps with user expectations for a given visual classification task. We measure them by GFDMs built upon gaze fixations of observers in a task-driven psychovisual experiment. The usual metrics of comparison of saliency maps, such as PCC, SSIM, L1 norm of difference (similarity) can also be used here. The higher the value of correlation, the stronger is the trust of the user in the explainer. Hence in this paper, we compare the presented white-box methods on the datasets with human gaze fixations recorded in a task-driven visual experiment of recognition of architectural styles of Mexican architectural heritage, introduced in  and publicly available at 111https://api.nakala.fr/data/11280%2F5712e468/1e412e0a43b5635365293b249feb9d53d74b5dc8.\nAs comparison metrics, we have chosen PCC and L1 norm of difference (SIM). We have taken a VGG-16 network initialized with ImageNet weights and retrained it on the complete Mexculture dataset from . The results of the comparison of explanation maps from different white-box methods and the GFDM for this network are shown in Tab. 1. Here the metrics have been computed on 284 images of the MexCulture dataset with available gaze fixation density maps for images that have not been used for training. From the table, one can see that FEM is the most similar to the GFDM in SIM - L1 norm and that Grad-CAM has the highest correlation with the GFDM. The methods belonging to the linearization category (Sec. 4) Integrated gradients and SmoothGrad are designed to reduce the noise from Gradient backpropagation heatmaps. From the table, it can be seen that the Similarity and PCC metrics are improved for these methods when compared to Gradient Backpropagation. Grad-CAM maps have the highest similarity to the GFDM maps from the linearization category of methods. Fig. 11 shows the heatmaps of different white-box methods for a sample image from the dataset. A zero image (black) has been taken as the reference image for the DeepLIFT visualization in the figure. It can be seen that the LRP method highlights the contrasted edges between the structure and sky to be the most relevant regions. Muddamsetty et al. also create a dataset comprising the user saliency maps in the form of GFDMs of medical experts on retinal images. They compare Grad-CAM and their own explainer maps with GFDM. Metrics like Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Div) for the two maps were computed for the comparison. They show that the saliency map of both explainers closely aligns with human experts. When the gaze fixation density maps are not available - and this is usually the case in real-world applications, the importance map produced by the explainer can be compared with already existing methods, which have been assessed. Thus for FEM[ref]37 the authors compare the saliency maps obtained by FEM with gradient-based methods. They show that the most similar explanations in terms of the metrics of comparison of saliency maps such as Pearson Correlation Coefficient, L1subscript𝐿1L_{1}-Similarity are given by Grad-CAM method (Sec.  4.6) which is also observed from our results (Tab. 1). Methods can also be compared based on their computation time. The choice of methods is limited in their application for a larger set of images or real-time feedback if they have a long computation time. Fuad et al.[ref]37 observe that gradient-based methods including Grad-CAM have longer computation times and FEM was faster in comparison.\n\nReference markers found: [54]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]54: based on human inspection to evaluate and compare different maps.
