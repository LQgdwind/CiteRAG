      "content": "Paper Title: Spatz: Clustering Compact RISC-V-Based Vector Units to Maximize Computing Efficiency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe VRF is at the core of any vector processor. It must provide enough bandwidth for the functional units to achieve high utilization. In the RISC-V ISA, the vector instruction with the highest bandwidth requirements is the floating-point multiply-accumulate between two vectors, 𝚟𝚏𝚖𝚊𝚌𝚌.𝚟𝚟formulae-sequence𝚟𝚏𝚖𝚊𝚌𝚌𝚟𝚟\\mathtt{vfmacc.vv} (and its integer equivalent, 𝚟𝚖𝚊𝚌𝚌.𝚟𝚟formulae-sequence𝚟𝚖𝚊𝚌𝚌𝚟𝚟\\mathtt{vmacc.vv}) [ref]20. The VRF must handle reading three operands and writing one result per cycle to sustain one FMA per cycle. Furthermore, more VRF bandwidth is required to execute memory operations concurrently with high-bandwidth multiply-accumulate operations. Large vector processors are typically coupled with equally complex scalar processors. For example, CVA6, an application-class RV64GC scalar core, consumes \\qty317 p  per operation of a simple dot product kernel, with only \\qty28 p  spent on the actual computation . Therefore, long vectors are needed to amortize the large energy overhead associated with fetching and dispatching individual instructions with a large application-class (super-)scalar core. Typical large vector units achieve long vectors and high bandwidth through a large multi-banked VRF, with five  to eight  single read/write port (1RW) SRAM banks per FPU. However, this approach requires inflexible fine-grained scheduling of the VRF bank accesses  or an architecture that can handle banking conflicts when multiple operands reside at the same bank . Therefore, VRFs are coupled with operand “queues” which store the operands until they are all simultaneously available. Instead of achieving high functional unit utilization through hardware complexity, the RISC-V-based Snitch core tries to tackle the VNB by maximizing the cores’ compute/control ratio, mitigating the efficiency loss due to deep pipelines and dynamic scheduling [ref]21. The Snitch-based shared-L1 cluster couples Snitch cores, typically RV32I or RV32E, with large double-precision FPUs. It achieves an energy efficiency of \\qty79 G DP/ on a double-precision matrix multiplication kernel [ref]21, almost double that of state-of-the-art vector machines . This cluster’s high performance is linked to Stream Semantic Registers (SSRs) , which stream L1 data into and from the FPUs without explicit load/store instructions. As a result, SSRs incur high L1 traffic. For example, each core must read two L1 SPM words per cycle to sustain the execution of a matrix multiplication kernel without incurring systematic structural hazards. This traffic is particularly taxing on the cluster’s physical implementation, as the L1 SPM interconnect is the critical factor for its scalability [ref]8. Furthermore, the breakdown of SRAM and interconnect scaling makes achieving the L1 bandwidth required by SSRs challenging. The vector-SIMD abstraction provides a clean abstraction for software to adapt automatically to the microarchitecture’s vector length . Therefore, we elect a streamlined VPU with a small VRF to act as the PE of our proposed shared-L1 cluster. The VRF size is used as an architectural knob to balance the bandwidth and energy cost of an L1 SRAM with the size and energy cost of the L0 SCM . If the VPU achieves a high compute/control ratio, we can explore the capacity/bandwidth trade-off without needing large VRFs. The VPU is based on the RVV extension version 1.01.01.0 of the open-source RISC-V ISA [ref]20. The extension adds 323232 architectural vector registers, 𝚟𝟶𝚟𝟶\\mathtt{v0} to 𝚟𝟹𝟸𝚟𝟹𝟸\\mathtt{v32}, each with 𝚅𝙻𝙴𝙽𝚅𝙻𝙴𝙽\\mathtt{VLEN} bytes. We assume that the VPU operates on vector elements \\qty[quantity-product=-]8 wide. Therefore, each vector register has 𝚟𝚕=𝚅𝙻𝙴𝙽/8𝚟𝚕𝚅𝙻𝙴𝙽8\\mathtt{vl}=\\nicefrac{{\\mathtt{VLEN}}}{{8}} vector elements. Furthermore, the RVV extension adds the concept of a vector register group so that a single vector instruction can operate on multiple vector registers. The Vector Length Multiplier (LMUL) ℓℓ\\ell, with ℓ∈{1,2,4,8}ℓ1248\\ell\\in\\{1,2,4,8\\}, represents how many vector registers are combined to form a vector register group. As a result, LMUL trades available vector registers against longer vectors at runtime. Taking it into account, RVV provides 32/ℓ32ℓ\\nicefrac{{32}}{{\\ell}} vector registers, each with ℓ×𝚅𝙻𝙴𝙽/8ℓ𝚅𝙻𝙴𝙽8\\nicefrac{{\\ell\\times\\mathtt{VLEN}}}{{8}} elements. We implement the VRF as a multi-banked, multi-ported, latch-based SCM. The 32​𝚅𝙻𝙴𝙽32𝚅𝙻𝙴𝙽32\\,\\mathtt{VLEN} bytes of the VRF are divided into two SCM banks with three read ports and one write port (3R1W) and 16​𝚅𝙻𝙴𝙽16𝚅𝙻𝙴𝙽16\\,\\mathtt{VLEN} bytes each. A single 3R1W SCM cut can provide enough bandwidth for executing the 𝚟𝚏𝚖𝚊𝚌𝚌.𝚟𝚟formulae-sequence𝚟𝚏𝚖𝚊𝚌𝚌𝚟𝚟\\mathtt{vfmacc.vv} instruction and multiple SCM banks ensure that other instructions can execute concurrently with the high-bandwidth vector multiply-accumulate instructions. Furthermore, since all operands of a vector instruction can be read simultaneously, we can forgo any “operand buffers” to time-multiplex the VRF operand fetching. Figure 2 shows the architecture of a 3R1W latch-based SCM with R𝑅R rows, each W𝑊W-bytes wide. This SCM architecture is similar to that of  , with manually-inserted Integrated Clock Gating (ICG) cells gating the many clocks reaching the latch array. Besides the clock (𝙲𝙻𝙺𝙲𝙻𝙺\\mathtt{CLK}), write enable (𝚆𝙴𝚆𝙴\\mathtt{WE}), write address (𝚆𝙰𝙳𝙳𝚁𝚆𝙰𝙳𝙳𝚁\\mathtt{WADDR}), and write data (𝚆𝙳𝙰𝚃𝙰𝚆𝙳𝙰𝚃𝙰\\mathtt{WDATA}) ports, the SCM also has a write byte strobe (𝚆𝙱𝙴𝚆𝙱𝙴\\mathtt{WBE}) port to select which bytes are written at each write transaction. The write data is stored in registers before being stored in the latch array. The three read address (𝚁𝙰𝙳𝙳𝚁​[𝚒]𝚁𝙰𝙳𝙳𝚁delimited-[]𝚒\\mathtt{RADDR[i]}) ports directly control muxes that select a row to forward to the corresponding read data (𝚁𝙳𝙰𝚃𝙰​[𝚒]𝚁𝙳𝙰𝚃𝙰delimited-[]𝚒\\mathtt{RDATA[i]}) port. Each cell of the storage array comprises eight data latches and an AND2 standard cell, \\qty28 in total. For comparison, an equivalent storage array cell based on multi-bit flip-flop standard cells would occupy \\qty49. We implemented the SCM of Figure 2 with Synopsys’ Fusion Compiler 2022.03, for many combinations of W𝑊W and R𝑅R, at \\qty950 M  in worst-case conditions (SS, \\qty0.72, \\qty125) using GlobalFoundries’ 12LPP advanced \\qty12 n  FinFET node. Then, we used Synopsys’ PrimePower 2022.03 to measure its read and write energy consumption, initialized with random numbers, at \\qty1 G  and nominal operating conditions (TT, \\qty0.80, \\qty25). Those results are summarized in Figure 3. We interpolate the read and write energy consumption of the SCM as a polynomial function on the SCM width W𝑊W and capacity K𝐾K. Using the least-squares algorithm to fit parameterized functions to the points of Figure 3, it costs to read W𝑊W bytes out of the SCM, and to write W𝑊W bytes into the SCM. For comparison, it costs ε^L1read=\\qty​4.63​psubscriptsuperscript^𝜀readL1\\qty4.63p\\hat{\\varepsilon}^{\\text{read}}_{\\text{L1}}=\\qty{4.63}{\\mathrm{p}} to read and ε^L1write=\\qty​5.77​psubscriptsuperscript^𝜀writeL1\\qty5.77p\\hat{\\varepsilon}^{\\text{write}}_{\\text{L1}}=\\qty{5.77}{\\mathrm{p}} to write 888 bytes into a 1RW SRAM of capacity \\qty8 Ki  in the same technology. We can gain further insight into the L0 and L1 energy consumption by normalizing the cost per byte accessed. For example, it takes \\qty0.58 p / to read data from an 1RW SRAM of width \\qty8 and capacity \\qty8 Ki . According to our model, it takes \\qty35 less energy, only \\qty0.38 p /, to read data from an L0 SCM with the same capacity and width. This comparison is not favorable towards the SRAMs since our model does not scale to this capacity (the largest \\qty[quantity-product=-]8-wide SCM we considered has a capacity of only \\qty512). However, our results back our conclusion that latch-based SCMs are an energy-efficient approach for building small-capacity storage buffers. Unfortunately, this SCM with a capacity of \\qty8 Ki  would be at least 25×25\\times larger than its equivalent SRAM, which constitutes a major drawback of latch-based SCMs with large capacity. In the following section, we will tune the L0 SCM capacity to minimize the overall energy consumption of a shared-L1 computing cluster. In particular, we consider the L1 SPM to have a fixed configuration. An extension of this work would be the multi-variate optimization of the cluster’s energy consumption as a function of both the L0 SCM and L1 SPM configurations. This multi-variate analysis requires a model of the SRAM energy consumption, which could be inferred from either commercial or open-source memory macro generators.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: is the floating-point multiply-accumulate between two vectors, 𝚟𝚏𝚖𝚊𝚌𝚌.𝚟𝚟formulae-sequence𝚟𝚏𝚖𝚊𝚌𝚌𝚟𝚟\\mathtt{vfmacc.vv} (and its integer equivalent, 𝚟𝚖𝚊𝚌𝚌.𝚟𝚟formulae-sequence𝚟𝚖𝚊𝚌𝚌𝚟𝚟\\mathtt{vmacc.vv}) [ref]20.
