      "content": "Paper Title: Convolutional Complex Knowledge Graph Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge Graphs represent structured collections of facts modelled in the form of typed relationships between entities . These collections of facts have been used in a wide range of applications, including web search [ref]10, cancer research [ref]29, and even entertainment . However, most KG on the Web are far from being complete [ref]24. For instance, the birth places of 71%percent7171\\% of the people in Freebase and 66%percent6666\\% of the people in DBpedia are not found in the respective KG. In addition, more than 58%percent5858\\% of the scientists in DBpedia are not linked to the predicate that describes what they are known for . Link prediction on KG refers to identifying such missing information .  Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models have been particularly successful at tackling the link prediction task [ref]24. We investigate the use of a 2D convolution in the complex space ℂℂ\\mathbb{C} to tackle the link prediction task. We are especially interested in an effective composition of the non-symmetric property of Hermitian products with the parameter sharing property of a 2D convolution. Previously, Trouillon et al.  showed the expressiveness of a Hermitian product on complex-valued embeddings (⟨𝐞h,𝐞r,𝐞t¯⟩)subscript𝐞ℎsubscript𝐞𝑟¯subscript𝐞𝑡\\real(\\langle\\mathbf{e}_{h},\\mathbf{e}_{r},\\overline{\\mathbf{e}_{t}}\\rangle), where 𝐞hsubscript𝐞ℎ\\mathbf{e}_{h}, 𝐞rsubscript𝐞𝑟\\mathbf{e}_{r}, and 𝐞tsubscript𝐞𝑡\\mathbf{e}_{t} stand for the embeddings of head entity, relation and tail entity, respectively; 𝐞t¯¯subscript𝐞𝑡\\overline{\\mathbf{e}_{t}} is the complex conjugate of 𝐞tsubscript𝐞𝑡\\mathbf{e}_{t}. The Hermitian product used in  is not symmetric and can be used to model antisymmetric relations since (⟨𝐞h,𝐞r,𝐞t¯⟩)≠(⟨𝐞t,𝐞r,𝐞h¯⟩)subscript𝐞ℎsubscript𝐞𝑟¯subscript𝐞𝑡subscript𝐞𝑡subscript𝐞𝑟¯subscript𝐞ℎ\\real(\\langle\\mathbf{e}_{h},\\mathbf{e}_{r},\\overline{\\mathbf{e}_{t}}\\rangle)\\neq\\real(\\langle\\mathbf{e}_{t},\\mathbf{e}_{r},\\overline{\\mathbf{e}_{h}}\\rangle). Dettmers et al.  and Nguyen et al.  indicated the effectiveness of using a 2D convolution followed by an affine transformation to predict missing links. Additionally, Balažević et al.  showed that 1D relation-specific convolution filters can be an effective means to tackle the link prediction task. Chen et al.  suggested applying a 2D convolution followed by two capsule layers on quaternion-valued embeddings. In turn, the results of a recent work  highlighted the importance of extensive hyperparameter optimization and\nnew training strategies (see Table 1). The paper showed that the link prediction performances of previous state-of-the-art models (e.g., RESCAL, ComplEx and DistMult   7) increased by up to 10%percent1010\\% absolute on benchmark datasets, provided that new training strategies are applied. Based on these considerations, we propose ConEx—a multiplicative composition of a 2D convolution operation with a Hermitian inner product of complex-valued embedding vectors. By virtue of its novel architecture, ConEx is able to control the impact of a 2D convolution on predicted scores, i.e., by endowing ComplEx with two more degrees of freedom (see Section 4). Ergo, ConEx is able to degenerate to ComplEx if such a degeneration is necessary to further reduce the incurred training loss. We evaluated ConEx on five of the most commonly used benchmark datasets (WN18, WN18RR, FB15K, FB15K-237 and YAGO3-10). We used the findings of  on using Bayesian optimization to select a small sample of hyperparameter values for our experiments. Hence, we did not need to perform an extensive hyperparameter optimization throughout our experiments and fixed the seed for the pseudo-random generator to 1. In our experiments, we followed the standard training strategy commonly used in the literature  . Overall, our results suggest that ConEx outperforms state-of-the-art models on four out of five benchmark datasets w.r.t. Hits@N and  Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). ConEx outperforms ComplEx and ConvE on all benchmark datasets in all metrics. Results of our statistical hypothesis testing indicates that the superior performance of ConEx is statistically significant. Our ablation study suggests that the dropout technique and the label smoothing have the highest impact on the performance of ConEx. Furthermore, our results on the YAGO3-10 dataset supports the findings of Ruffinelli et al.  as training DistMult and ComplEx with new techniques resulted in increasing their MRR performances by absolute 20%percent2020\\% and 19%percent1919\\%, respectively. Finally, our results suggest that the generalization performance of models can be further improved by applying ensemble learning. In particular, ensembling ConEx leads to a new state-of-the-art performance on WN18RR and FB15K-237.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: structured collections of facts modelled in the form of typed relationships between entities .
