Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Unlocking the Potential of Multimodal Unified Discrete Representation through Training-Free Codebook Optimization and Hierarchical Alignment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe employ DCID [ref]31 as the baseline and compare its performance with recent works on unified representations, including S-Mit [ref]17, MST [ref]34, CODIS , TURN , and CMCM . These methods are implemented on our tasks, and their performance is evaluated on two downstream tasks. For the AVE , VGGSound-AVEL  , and UCF101  datasets, precision (%)(\\%) is used as the metric. Accuracy (%)(\\%) is employed for evaluating performance on the AVVP  datasets. The F1-score (%)(\\%) is utilized for assessing the AVE to AVVP generalization task, while mIoU and F-score (as defined in AVS ) are used for the AVS-S4 dataset. The losses of H-DCID are not suitable for full backpropagation initially. If subsequent layer losses participate in backpropagation before sufficient disentanglement is achieved by previous layers, this can lead to failure in aligning modality-general semantics from coarse to fine granularity across layers. We use the warm-start technique, applying only preceding layer losses for the first few epochs until adequate disentanglement is reached. Only then are losses from subsequent DCID [ref]31 layers introduced into the backpropagation. All results presented in Tabs. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were obtained with the codebook size set to 400. The ablation study on codebook size is discussed in Fig. 5. The backbone models used to extract features for video, audio, and text modalities are VGG19 , VGGish, and BERT , respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: We employ DCID [ref]31 as the baseline and compare its performance with recent works on unified representations, including S-Mit [ref]17, MST [ref]34, CODIS , TURN , and CMCM .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
