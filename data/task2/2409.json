      "content": "Paper Title: Influence of a Set of Variables on a Boolean Function\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBoolean functions play an important role in diverse areas of mathematics and computer science, including combinatorics, probability, complexity theory, learning theory,\ncryptography and coding theory. We refer to two excellent books on Boolean functions, namely  and . The first book\nfocuses on Boolean functions in the context of theoretical computer science, while the second book focuses on Boolean functions in relation to cryptography and\ncoding theory. The notion of influence of a variable on a Boolean function was introduced by Ben-Or and Linial [ref]2. Subsequently, this concept has become central\nto the study of Boolean functions in various contexts. See  for a very comprehensive account of such applications. The notion of influence, however,\nhas not received much attention in the context of cryptographic applications of Boolean functions. We know of only two works   which\nstudied influence in relation to cryptographic properties. The notion of influence of a variable on a function has been extended to consider the influence of a set of variables on a function. We have been able to locate four different\ndefinitions of the influence of a set of variables on a Boolean function. The first definition appears in the work of Ben-Or and Linial [ref]2 itself in 1989.\nA different definition due to Fischer et al.  appeared in 2002 and the same definition was considered in 2009 by Blais .\nA third definition was given by Gangopadhyay and Stănică  in 2014 and a fourth definition was given by Tal  in 2017.\nAll of these definitions coincide with each other in the case of a single variable, but in the case of more than one variable, in general the values provided by the\nfour definitions of influence are different. The motivation of our work is to make a systematic and comprehensive study of the notion of influence of a set of variables on a Boolean function. To this end,\nwe introduce a definition of influence based on the auto-correlation function, which is a very useful tool for analysing certain cryptographic properties of Boolean functions.\nTwo Walsh transform based characterisations of influence are obtained and some basic intuitive properties are derived. Several results on the influence of a single variable\nare generalised. These include Poincaré inequality and edge expansion property of influence of a variable. In the context of cryptographic properties, we provide characterisations\nof resilient and bent functions using the notion of influence. The definition of influence given in   is shown to be half the value of\nthe notion of influence that we introduce. We also argue that the definition of influence considered in  does not satisfy a basic desirable\nproperty, namely that the influence of a set of variables can be zero even if the function is not degenerate on these variables. Next we define a quantity called pseudo-influence, obtain its Walsh transform based characterisation and derive certain basic properties. We show that the pseudo-influence\ndoes not satisfy some intuitive properties that one would expect a notion of influence to satisfy, which is why we call it pseudo-influence. From the Walsh transform\nbased characterisation, it follows that the definition of influence considered by Tal  is the notion of pseudo-influence that we introduce.\nOur motivation for introducing pseudo-influence and analysing it is to show that the notion of influence considered in  is not satisfactory. Lastly, we make a systematic study of the Ben-Or and Linial (BL) notion of influence [ref]2.\nWe show that the BL notion of influence satisfies some desirable properties, but it does not satisfy sub-additivity. Further, we argue that compared to the\nauto-correlation based definition, the BL notion of influence is a more coarse measure. Section 2 introduces the background and the notation and also describes the previous definitions of influence of a set of variables.\nThe definition of influence from auto-correlation is introduced in Section 3 and its Walsh transform based characterisations and basic\nproperties are derived. The concept is further developed in several subsections.\nThe path expansion property of influence is derived in Section 3.1, two probabilistic interpretations of influence are\ngiven in Section 3.2, the relation of influence to juntas and cryptographic properties are described in Section 3.3\nand 3.4 respectively, and a general form the Fourier entropy/influence conjecture is mentioned in Section 3.5. The notion of pseudo-influence\nis defined in Section 4 and its properties as well as its relation to influence are studied. Section 5 makes a detailed investigation\nof the notion of influence introduced by Ben-Or and Linial and its relation to the auto-correlation based notion of influence.\nA discussion of the new results in this paper and their importance is given in Section 6.\nFinally, Section 7 concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: while the second book focuses on Boolean functions in relation to cryptography and\ncoding theory.
