Our framework is closely related to prior work that considers the learning of other agents in the environment.\nThe framework by , for instance, learns the best response adaptation to the other agent’s anticipated updated policy.\nNotably, LOLA [ref]6 and its more recent improvements   study the impact of behavior on one or a few of another agent’s policy updates.\nOur work is also related to frameworks that leverage the inferred policy dynamics of other agents to impact their future policies by maximizing the discounted return objective  .\nMeta-learning frameworks are also related that directly account for the non-stationary policy dynamics in multiagent settings based on the inner-loop and outer-loop optimization    .\nLastly, the field of incentive MARL     is related, where agents additionally optimize incentive rewards and learn successful policies in solving sequential social dilemma domains  .\nHowever, all of these approaches only account for a finite number of updates to the policies of other agents, so we observe that these methods can converge to a less desirable solution.\nFURTHER addresses this issue by optimizing for the average reward objective in the active Markov game setting. Another effective approach to addressing the non-stationarity is learning equilibrium policies that correspond to game-theoretic solution concepts     .\nThese frameworks predict stationary joint action values by the end of learning and can guarantee convergence to Nash  or correlated  equilibrium values under certain assumptions.\nHowever, as noted in , this convergence is guaranteed only while ignoring the actual learning dynamics of other agents, and each agent assumes all agents will play the same joint equilibrium strategy.\nAs such, equilibrium learners can fail to learn best-response policies when others choose to play different equilibrium strategies in the future as a result of their learning.\nBy contrast, FURTHER considers convergence to a recurrent set of joint policies by inferring the true policy dynamics of other agents.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: and reason about joint action effects 4.\nExample frameworks include centralized training with decentralized execution, which accounts for the actions of other agents through a centralized critic [ref]12      .\nOther related approaches include opponent modeling frameworks that infer opponent policies and condition an agent’s policy on this inferred information about others    .\nWhile this\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
