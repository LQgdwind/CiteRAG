      "content": "Paper Title: How to Learn a Useful Critic? Model-based Action-Gradient-Estimator Policy Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPolicy gradients are among the most popular methods in reinforcement learning.\nA variety of algorithms have been proposed for the estimation of the policy gradient, either involving only the policy  [ref]4  or also a value function   .\nThe latter category of algorithms is reffered to as actor-critic methods  .\nAmong them, the ones based on the Deterministic Policy Gradient [ref]47  leverage the action-gradient of the critic.\nWhen using function approximation, the quality of the learned critic is of paramount importance : for instance, enforcing on the critic the compatiblity conditions [ref]47 ensures an unbiased estimate of the policy gradient. Developed around such conditions, GProp  is, to the best of our knowledge, the only method that explicitly optimizes for the accuracy of the learned action-value gradient.\nIt is significantly different w.r.t. MAGE, being model-free and based on gradient estimation via noisy perturbations together with an additional deviator network.\nImportantly, while GProp’s deviator network is a function approximator that outputs an estimate for the action-gradient, recent theoretical 9 and practical  insights outside of RL suggest that learning the action-gradient by second-order differentiation, as we propose in MAGE, is not only simpler to implement w.r.t. GProp and similar procedures , but also fundamentally more effective when using neural network approximators. The technique we use for learning the action-gradient relies on the differentiation of the TD-error and, thus, of the Bellman equation.\nThis is related to a broad class of methods called value gradients   1 , in which the policy is improved by backpropagating through the unrolled Bellman equation.\nThose approaches, however, learn the value function by standard temporal difference 1.\nAnother classical method, named Dual Heuristic Programming (DHP)   , learns the gradient of the state-value function in a model-based setting, leading to a TD-learning procedure that resembles our approach.\nHowever, DHP has the main goal of improving generalization of the value function and exploration, and is fundamentally different from MAGE, that aims at learning an accurate action-gradient of the critic and is motivated by the Deterministic Policy Gradient Theorem. More broadly, inside and outside of reinforcement learning, several algorithms incorporate gradient penalties into the loss function used for training a neural network.\nThis technique, known as double backpropagation , has been employed in a number of applications, for instance increasing generalization capabilities  8, enforcing Lipschitz constants 0 0 , or encouraging robustness to adversarial examples .\nParticularly related to our approach is Sobolev training , which leverages the availability of the derivatives of a target function to explicitly try to learn both value and gradient of it during supervised training; in our case, no ground-truth gradient is available and we use the action-gradient of the TD-target as a proxy. Our method learns the action-gradient in the context of model-based policy optimization   .\nWe build upon the classical Dyna framework  5, in which a learned model is used for generating imaginary transitions, then employed for training a value function.\nOur algorithm, which learns a Q-function from model-generated data but only optimizes the policy by using real data, is related to the approaches that compute the policy gradient by using a model-based value function together with trajectories sampled in the environment  1 1 3.\nIn practice, we leverage an ensemble of models, which has been shown to improve performance in a variety of contexts 7  3. Finally, our work is related in spirit to decision-aware model learning (DAML) 4 5 1.\nIn DAML approaches, the model of the dynamics of the environment is learned by explicitly considering how it will be used for improving the control policy: this is the same rationale behind the learning objective used in MAGE for the critic, focused on how it will be useful for policy optimization, and not merely on how it will be similar to the true value function.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Policy gradients are among the most popular methods in reinforcement learning.\nA variety of algorithms have been proposed for the estimation of the policy gradient, either involving only the policy  [ref]4  or also a value function   .\nThe latter category of algorithms is reffered to as actor-critic methods  .\nAmong them, the ones based on the Deterministic Policy Gradient [ref]47  leverage the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
