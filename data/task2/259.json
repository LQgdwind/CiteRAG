      "content": "Paper Title: Action Space Shaping in Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement learning  has been successfully applied to various video game environments to create human-level or even super-human agents [ref]2  [ref]4   [ref]7, and show promise as a general way to teach computers to play games. However, these results are accomplished with a significant amount of engineering, including questions like:\nhow should the agent perceive the environment,\nwhat should the rewards be and\nwhen should the game terminate, just to name a few examples.\nOne of these concerns is the action space:\nhow does the agent act in the environment?\nDo we restrict the number of available actions?\nShould we simplify it by creating combinations of actions?\nHow do we deal with continuous controls like mouse movement?\nIntuitively, learning to control a system with more buttons is harder, as the agent has to learn what each of the actions mean.\nReducing the number of buttons might ease the learning but comes with the risk of limiting the agent’s performance.\n Such transformations of the action space, which we call action space shaping, are prominent in reinforcement learning research and competitions, especially when it comes to video games.\nEnvironments like Doom  and Minecraft  have large action spaces with dozens of buttons, and in related competitions all top participants modified the actions 0 .\nThis action space shaping comes in the forms of removing actions, combining different actions into one action and discretizing continuous actions. The goal is to ease the learning for the agent, similar to reward shaping 1. Along with the well-known work on mastering Starcraft II [ref]2 and Dota 2  with reinforcement learning, other games have received similar attention, such as modern first-person shooters 2 [ref]4, Minecraft 3 , popular fighting-games like Super Smash Bros 4, other massive online battle arenas (MOBAs) [ref]7 and driving in GTA V 5. All of these works do action space shaping, either because of limitations of the learning environment or because of the sheer number of actions, e.g. in strategy games and MOBAs. The effect of different action spaces is no stranger to RL research.\nA large number of possible actions is known to lead to over-optimistic estimates of future rewards 6.\nPrevious research has addressed this problem by removing un-promising actions 7, or by finding the closest neighbors of promising ones 8.\nOther works extended existing methods by adding support for different action spaces 9  or by supporting large, complex action spaces .\nThe work by Delalleau et al.  shares our focus and mindset, where authors discussed different ways of processing complex action spaces, specifically for video games. However, this and other related works have not included experiments that study specific changes to the action-spaces. We fill this gap by running experiments on various video game environments, testing transformations successfully used in different competitions. Our core research question is \\saydo these transformations support the training of reinforcement learning agents? By answering this question in the context of video games, we aim to reduce the number of dials to tune when applying RL to games.\nThis is especially useful in the case of new environments, where it is unknown if RL agents can learn to play the game.\nIf an agent fails to learn, it is often unclear if the issue lies in the learning algorithm, the observation space, the rewards, the environment dynamics or the action space.\nBy studying which types of action spaces work and which do not, we hope to remove one of these possibilities, making prototyping and further research easier. We start our contribution by summarizing different types of action space shaping done, recognizing common transformations and then verifying their effectiveness with empirical experiments.\nWe start with experiments in a toy-environment, and then move on to Atari, ViZDoom, Starcraft II and Obstacle Tower environments, to cover a broad range of different environments.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Reinforcement learning  has been successfully applied to various video game environments to create human-level or even super-human agents [ref]2  [ref]4   [ref]7, and show promise as a general way to teach computers to play games.
