      "content": "Paper Title: Capturing Dynamics of Time-Varying Data via Topology\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDrawing from subfields within mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics, and computer science, topological data analysis (TDA) is a set of approaches that help one understand complex data by studying its shape.\nThe application of TDA has contributed to the understanding of problems and systems in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities, including granular materials , cancer biology , development economics , political science [ref]29, urban analytics , natural language processing 9, and much more.\nClassic works that build and review the fundamental ideas of TDA include      .\nWhile TDA was originally developed with the study of static data in mind, in recent years, it has found fruitful application to time-evolving data, or as we will say, dynamically-varying or time-varying metric spaces.\nFor example, for a biological aggregation such as an insect swarm, the metric space of interest might be the positions and velocities of all organisms, which vary from frame to frame in the movie of an experimental trial 7.\nFor networked oscillators, the metric space of interest might be the phase of each oscillator in the ensemble, which, similarly, evolves in time 5.\nThese systems can produce massive amounts of data, and so there is sometimes a need to simplify or summarize the dynamic behavior of time-varying systems.\nHere, TDA plays a role. In this paper, we have three overarching goals.\nFirst, we aim to provide a lay reader in the data science community with an overview of topological tools for studying time-varying metric spaces.\nSecond, we demonstrate an application of some of these tools to a parameter recovery problem arising in the study of collective behavior.\nFinally, we present a new tool for time-varying metric spaces — a crocker stack — and explore its continuity properties.\nOverall, we hope that our work will provide a mechanism to bring newcomers to the field up-to-date on approaches to time-varying metric spaces, including our own new contribution. Topological methods for studying time-varying data are built on a technique called persistent homology.\nHomology provides a way to (partially) characterize the topology of an object. The characterization comes in the form of quantities called Betti numbers βksubscript𝛽𝑘\\beta_{k}, where the k𝑘k indicates a boundary of dimension k𝑘k enclosing a void of dimension k+1𝑘1k+1.\nConcretely, the number of connected components is β0subscript𝛽0\\beta_{0}, the number of topological loops (circles) is β1subscript𝛽1\\beta_{1}, the number of trapped volumes is β2subscript𝛽2\\beta_{2}, and so on up in dimension.\nFor example, suppose we have a filled-in disk next to a hollow square next to a two-torus, that is, a hollow donut; see Figure 1.\nThe filled-in disk has Betti numbers (β0,β1,β2,β3,…)=(1,0,0,0,…)subscript𝛽0subscript𝛽1subscript𝛽2subscript𝛽3…1000…(\\beta_{0},\\beta_{1},\\beta_{2},\\beta_{3},\\ldots)=(1,0,0,0,\\ldots) because it is one object that is contractible and has no higher dimensional structure.\nThe hollow square has Betti numbers (1,1,0,0,…)1100…(1,1,0,0,\\ldots) because it is one object enclosing a flat void.\nAnd finally, the torus has Betti numbers (1,2,1,0,…)1210…(1,2,1,0,\\ldots) because it is one object, is generated by two independent circles (one passing around the equator of the donut and one passing around the donut’s hole), and encloses an empty volume.\nAltogether, then, we have (β0,β1,β2,β3,…)=(3,3,1,0,…)subscript𝛽0subscript𝛽1subscript𝛽2subscript𝛽3…3310…(\\beta_{0},\\beta_{1},\\beta_{2},\\beta_{3},\\ldots)=(3,3,1,0,\\ldots) if we consider the homology of the union of these three shapes. In the example above, we have used idealized shapes such as a disk, hollow square, and torus.\nHowever, we want to also think about the topological properties of a data set, rather than only idealized shapes.\nSuppose we have N𝑁N data points in ℝmsuperscriptℝ𝑚\\mathbb{R}^{m} and we want to know if this set of points has structure that we cannot see by eye.\nWe can build a simplicial complex (in particular, we describe the process to construct a Vietoris-Rips simplicial complex, but others exist as well) out of the data by placing an m𝑚m-dimensional ball of radius ε/2𝜀2\\varepsilon/2 around each point, forming a k𝑘k-simplex whenever k+1𝑘1k+1 points are pairwise within ε𝜀\\varepsilon (i.e. the balls pairwise intersect), and then, calculating the Betti numbers of the object formed.\nOf course, the values of the Betti numbers will depend on our choice of ε𝜀\\varepsilon.\nFor ε𝜀\\varepsilon approaching zero, all the balls will still be separated, and we have β0=Nsubscript𝛽0𝑁\\beta_{0}=N with no higher dimensional topological features.\nFor ε𝜀\\varepsilon approaching infinity, all the balls will overlap and we will have a giant, solid mass\nwith β0=1subscript𝛽01\\beta_{0}=1 and no higher dimensional features.\nAt intermediate values of ε𝜀\\varepsilon, the structure of the simplicial complex may well be sensitive to ε𝜀\\varepsilon, and one may see topological holes of various dimensions that are born and die as ε𝜀\\varepsilon varies.\nThe persistent part of persistent homology refers to calculating homology over a range of values of ε𝜀\\varepsilon and studying how topological features persist or vary. Thus far, we have been discussing static data. Three topological summaries of time-varying data are vineyards , crocker plots 6, and multiparameter rank functions .\nAs we will explain in more detail later, a vineyard is a 3D representation of persistent homology over time.\nA crocker plot is a 2D image that displays the topological information at all scales and times simultaneously, albeit in a manner that does not necessarily elucidate persistence.\nFinally, a multiparameter rank function is a computable invariant with appealing theoretical properties, providing lower bounds on strong notions of distance between dynamic metric spaces.\nThe three topological summaries we have mentioned here will be presented in more detail in Section 3. We introduce a new topological summary called a crocker stack, a 3D data structure that is an extension of the 2D crocker plot. The crocker stack has three important and useful features.\nFirst, as we will prove in Section 7, it satisfies a continuity property.\nRoughly, a small perturbation of time-varying data results in a small perturbation of the crocker stack.\nSecond, the crocker stack inherits appealing interpretability properties of the crocker plot.\nA crocker stack is convenient for visualization purposes since topological information for all times and at all scales in the data set is displayed as a single 2D plot, and a third dimension captures the persistence of topological features; see Figure 2 for an example.\nThird, a crocker stack can be discretized and converted into a feature vector, which can be used as input to machine learning tasks. We explain crocker stacks in detail in Section 4. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.\nSection 2 synthesizes information on persistence modules and metric spaces, thus providing the basic topological background underpinning this work in TDA.\nSection 3 reviews existing frameworks for studying time-varying metric spaces, namely vineyards, crocker plots, and multiparameter rank functions.\nSection 4 presents our new topological summary, crocker stacks.\nIn Section 5, we use crocker plots and crocker stacks to study a seminal model of collective behavior: the Vicsek model 8.\nSpecifically, we show that when used as inputs to machine learning algorithms for a parameter recovery task, crocker plots and stacks outperform more traditional summaries of dynamical behavior, drawn from physics.\nSection 6 reviews notions of distances between metric spaces and persistence modules, which are necessary background for Section 7, in which we study the continuity properties of crocker stacks.\nWe conclude and describe possible future work in Section 8.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: to the understanding of problems and systems in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities, including granular materials , cancer biology , development economics , political science [ref]29, urban analytics , natural language processing 9, and much more.\nClassic works that build and review the fundamental ideas of TDA include      .\nWhile TDA was originally developed with the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
