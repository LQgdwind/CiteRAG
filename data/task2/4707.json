      "content": "Paper Title: High-order Multi-view Clustering for Generic Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare HMvC and AHMvC with several state-of-the-art multi-view graph clustering methods on graph data: graph learning-based methods, like RMSC , MNE , PwSC , and MvAGC ; GNN-based methods, like O2MA, O2MAC , SDCN [ref]53, HDMI , DAEGA , CMGEC , and MAGCN ; contrastive learning-based methods, like COMPLETER  and MVGRL [ref]31.\nRMSC employs low-rank and sparse decomposition to achieve robust spectral clustering. MNE learns multi-view graph embedding for clustering and PwSC is a parameter-weighted multi-view graph clustering method. MvAGC is a scalable method that explores high-order interaction among topological structures. O2MA and O2MAC select the most informative view to learn representation for clustering. HDMI learns node embeddings by exploring high-order mutual information. SDCN and DAEGA are two deep clustering methods aiming to collect structural information via GCN and graph attention auto-encoder, respectively. CMGEC adds graph fusion network on multiple graph auto-encoders to obtain a consistent embedding. MAGCN applies graph auto-encoder on both attributes and topological graphs. COMPLETER and MVGRL learn a common representation shared across multiple views and different graphs via contrastive mechanism, respectively. \nFurthermore, we compare HMvC with several traditional methods on generic multi-view data, including AMSL , MLRSSC , MSC_IAS , LMVSC 6, and SMC . AMSL is a parameter-free auto-weighted multiple\ngraph learning framework and remaining methods are subspace clustering methods.\nWe set Œ±ùõº\\alpha, Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta, and Œºùúá\\mu in the same range [1‚Äãe‚àí3,1,1‚Äãe‚Äã2,1‚Äãe‚Äã3,1‚Äãe‚Äã4]1ùëí311ùëí21ùëí31ùëí4[1e-3,1,1e2,1e3,1e4]. On all datasets, we set filtering order k=2ùëò2k=2. We utilize third-order similarity on graph data while second-order on non-graph data, then we tune the parameters to obtain the best results. On the medium-size datasets, we choose the number of anchors m=[ref]50 ùëö50100m=[ref]50  for AHMvC.\nAlmost all experiments are conducted on the same machine with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700 3.20GHz CPU, two GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPUs, and 64GB RAM. MVGRL [ref]31 is implemented on Google Colab with Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU 2.30GHz CPU, one Tesla K80, and 12GB RAM.\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: AHMvC with several state-of-the-art multi-view graph clustering methods on graph data: graph learning-based methods, like RMSC , MNE , PwSC , and MvAGC ; GNN-based methods, like O2MA, O2MAC , SDCN [ref]53, HDMI , DAEGA , CMGEC , and MAGCN ; contrastive learning-based methods, like COMPLETER  and MVGRL [ref]31.\nRMSC employs low-rank and sparse decomposition to achieve robust spectral\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
