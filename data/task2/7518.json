Deep learning has also been applied to affective computing from physiological data  [ref]13. A deep network to classify the states of relaxation, anxiety, excitement, and fun using skin conductance and pulse signals, achieving comparable accuracy to shallow methods, is given in . A Deep Belief Network (DBN) to classify positive and negative emotions is given in . The selection of electrodes and frequency bands is performed through the distribution of weights in a trained DBN ‚Äì being asymmetries between the left and right brain hemispheres relevant features. A Dynamical-Graph Convolutional Net (DG-CNN) learns an adjacency matrix among EEG channels to outperform DBN, Transductive SVM and Transfer Component Analysis in . A Two-Stage Fuzzy Fusion strategy combined with a CNN (TSFF-CNN) is described in . Facial expressions and speech modalities are aggregated for a final decision. The method manages ambiguity in emotional states. TSFF-CNN outperformed other deep models. Recent studies address explainable methods in emotion recognition  . In 0, Biorthogonal wavelets, combined with Fuzzy SVM, are employed to process facial images for identifying happiness, sadness, surprisingness, angriness, and fearfulness. An Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) that combines facial expression and EEG features has shown to be superior to single-source classifiers in 1. ANFIS identifies the valence status stimulated by watching movies. The Online weighted Adaptation Regularization for Regression (OwARR) algorithm 2 aims to estimate driver drowsiness from EEG data. We note that offline training is required to select OwARR domains. An ensemble of models using swarm-optimized Sugeno or Choquet aggregators for motor imagery recognition and robotic arm control is presented in 3. All the learning methods mentioned above implicitly assume stationary data since models are expected to keep their training performance during tests using fixed parameters. However, physiological data can change due to artifacts, environmental conditions, and multiple users sharing a device. Fatigue, attention, and stress also affect user-dependent and independent generalized classifiers in an uncertain manner.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Naive Bayes (NB), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
