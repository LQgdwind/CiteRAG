      "content": "Paper Title: Fearless Asynchronous Communications with Timed Multiparty Session Protocols\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nintroduces a new framework, affine timed multiparty session types (ATMP),\nto address the challenges of timeouts, disconnections\nand other failures in asynchronous communications:\n\n\n(1) We propose ATMP, an extension of asynchronous MPST that incorporates time specifications,\naffinity, and mechanisms for handling exceptions, thus facilitating effective management of failures, with a particular focus on timeouts.\nAdditionally, we\ndemonstrate that properties from MPST,\ni.e. type safety, protocol conformance,\nand deadlock-freedom, are guaranteed for well-typed processes, even\nin the presence of timeouts and their corresponding handling mechanism;\n\n(2) We present MultiCrustyTsuperscriptMultiCrusty𝑇\\texttt{MultiCrusty}^{T}​,\nour Rust toolchain designed for building asynchronous timed multiparty protocols under ATMP:\nMultiCrustyTsuperscriptMultiCrusty𝑇\\texttt{MultiCrusty}^{T}​ enables the implementation of protocols adhering to the properties of ATMP.\n\n The primary focus of ATMP lies in\neffectively handling timeouts during process execution,\nin contrast to the approaches in  ,\nwhich aim to completely avoid time failures. Bocchi et al.  introduce\ntime conditions in MPST to ensure precise timing in communication protocols,\nwhile their subsequent work  extends binary timed session types\nto incorporate timeouts, allowing for more robust handling of time constraints. Yet, they\nadopt strict requirements to prevent timeouts.\nIn , feasibility and wait-freedom\nare required in their protocol design.\nFeasibility requires precise time specifications for protocol termination,\nwhile wait-freedom prohibits overlapping time windows for senders and receivers in a protocol,\nwhich is not practical in real-world applications. Similarly, in , strong conditions including progress\nof an entire set of processes\nand urgent receive are imposed.\nThe progress property is usually undecidable,\nand the urgent receive condition,\nwhich demands immediate message reception upon availability,\nis infeasible with asynchronous communication. Recently,\n[ref]34 proposes the inclusion of timeout as the unique failure notation in MPST,\noffering flexibility in handling failures.\nTime also plays a role in synchronous communication systems, where  develops rate-based binary session types,\nensuring synchronous message exchanges at the same rate, i.e. within the same time window.\nHowever, in both [ref]34 and ,\ntime constraints are not integrated into types and static type checking,\nresulting in the specifications lacking the ability to guide time behaviour.\nAdditionally,\nthe model used in  assumes that all communications and computations are non-time-consuming, i.e. with zero time cost, making it unfeasible in distributed systems. By the efficient integration of time and failure handling mechanisms in our framework,\nnone of those impractical requirements outlined in  \nis necessary. In ATMP, when a process encounters a timeout error,\na mechanism for handling time failures is triggered,\nnotifying all participants about the timeout,\nleading to the termination of those participants and ultimately ending the session.\nSuch an approach guarantees that participants consistently\nreach the end of the protocol,\nas the communication session is entirely dropped\nupon encountering a timeout error.\nAs a result,\nevery process can terminate successfully,\nreducing the risk of indefinite blockages, even with timeouts.\nAdditionally, in our system, time constraints over local clocks are incorporated with types to effectively model asynchronous timed communication, addressing the limitations in [ref]34 . Except for ,\nthe aforementioned works on timed session types focus more on theory,\nlacking implementations.\nTo bridge this gap on the practical side,\nwe provide MultiCrustyTsuperscriptMultiCrusty𝑇\\texttt{MultiCrusty}^{T}​,\na Rust implementation of ATMP designed for secure timed communications.\nMultiCrustyTsuperscriptMultiCrusty𝑇\\texttt{MultiCrusty}^{T}​ makes use of affine timed meshed channels,\na communication data structure that integrates time constraints and clock utilisation.\nOur toolchain relies on macros and native generic types\nto ensure that asynchronous protocols are inherently correct by construction.\nIn particular,\nMultiCrustyTsuperscriptMultiCrusty𝑇\\texttt{MultiCrusty}^{T}​ performs compile-time verification to guarantee that,\nat any given point in the protocol,\neach isolated pair of participants comprises one sender and one receiver\nwith corresponding time constraints.\nAdditionally,\nwe employ affine asynchronous primitives and native optional types\nto effectively handle runtime timeouts and errors. To showcase the capabilities and expressiveness of our toolchain,\nwe evaluate MultiCrustyTsuperscriptMultiCrusty𝑇\\texttt{MultiCrusty}^{T}​ through examples from the literature, and further\ncase studies including a remote data protocol from an Internet of Remote Things (IoRT) network ,\na servo web protocol from a web engine , and protocols from real-time systems such as Android motion sensor , PineTime smartwatch , and keyless entry .\nOur comparative analysis with\na Rust implementation of affine MPST without time [ref]32\nreveals that MultiCrustyTsuperscriptMultiCrusty𝑇\\texttt{MultiCrusty}^{T}​ exhibits minimal overhead\nwhile providing significantly strengthened property checks.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: progress property is usually undecidable,\nand the urgent receive condition,\nwhich demands immediate message reception upon availability,\nis infeasible with asynchronous communication.
