      "content": "Paper Title: Redeeming Intrinsic Rewards via Constrained Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe goal of reinforcement learning (RL)  is to find a mapping from states to actions (i.e., a policy) that maximizes reward. At every learning iteration, an agent is faced with a question: has the maximum possible reward been achieved? In many practical problems, the maximum achievable reward is unknown. Even when the maximum achievable reward is known, if the current policy is sub-optimal then the agent is faced with another question: would spending time improving its current strategy lead to higher rewards (exploitation), or should it attempt a different strategy in the hope of discovering potentially higher reward (exploration)? Pre-mature exploitation is akin to getting stuck in a local-optima and precludes the agent from exploring. Too much exploration on the other hand can be distracting, and prevent the agent from perfecting a good strategy. Resolving the exploration-exploitation dilemma  is therefore essential for data/time efficient policy learning. In simple decision making problems where actions do not affect the state (e.g. bandits or contextual bandits ), provably optimal algorithms for balancing exploration against exploitation are known  . However, in the general settings where RL is used, such algorithms are unknown. In the absence of methods that work well in both theory and practice, state-of-the-art RL algorithms rely on heuristic exploration strategies such as adding noise to actions or random sampling of sub-optimal actions (e.g., ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-greedy). However, such strategies fail in sparse reward scenarios where infrequent rewards hinder policy improvement. One such task is the notorious ATARI game, Montezuma’s Revenge . Sparse reward problems can be solved by supplementing the task reward (or extrinsic reward rEsubscript𝑟𝐸r_{E}) with a dense exploration bonus (or intrinsic reward rIsubscript𝑟𝐼r_{I}) generated by the agent itself    [ref]7 [ref]8.\nIntrinsic rewards encourage the agent to visit novel states, which increases the chance of encountering states with task reward. Many prior works  [ref]8  show that jointly optimizing for intrinsic and extrinsic reward (i.e., rE+λ​rIsubscript𝑟𝐸𝜆subscript𝑟𝐼r_{E}+\\lambda r_{I}, where λ≥0𝜆0\\lambda\\geq 0 is a hyperparameter) instead of only optimizing for extrinsic reward (i.e., λ=0𝜆0\\lambda=0) improves performance on sparse reward tasks such as Montezuma’s revenge   0. However, a recent study found that using intrinsic rewards does not consistently outperform simple exploration strategies such as ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-greedy across ATARI games 1. This is because the mixed objective (rE+λ​rIsubscript𝑟𝐸𝜆subscript𝑟𝐼r_{E}+\\lambda r_{I}) is biased for |λ|>0𝜆0|\\lambda|>0, and optimizing it does not necessarily yield the optimal policy with respect to the extrinsic reward alone 2. Fig. 1(a) illustrates this problem using a toy example. Here the green triangle is the agent and the blue/pink circles denote the location of extrinsic and intrinsic rewards, respectively. At the start of training, all states are novel and provide a source of intrinsic reward (i.e., pink circles). This makes accumulating intrinsic rewards easy, which the agent may exploit to optimize its objective of maximizing the sum of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. However, such optimization can result in a local maxima: the agent might move rightwards along the bottom corridor, essentially distracting the agent from the blue task rewards at the top. In this example, since it is not hard to find the task reward, better performance is obtained if only the extrinsic reward (λ=0𝜆0\\lambda=0) is maximized. The trouble, however, is that in most environments one doesn’t know a priori how to optimally trade off intrinsic and extrinsic rewards (i.e., choose λ𝜆\\lambda). A common practice is to conduct an extensive hyperparameter search to find the best λ𝜆\\lambda, as different values of λ𝜆\\lambda are best suited for different tasks (see Fig. 4). Furthermore, as the agent progresses on a task, the best exploration-exploitation trade-off can vary, and a constant λ𝜆\\lambda may not be optimal throughout training. In initial stages of training exploration might be preferred. Once the agent is able to obtain some task reward, it might prefer exploiting these rewards instead of exploring further. The exact dynamics of the exploration-exploitation trade-off is task-dependent, and per-task tuning is tedious, undesirable, and often computationally infeasible. Consequently, prior works use a fixed λ𝜆\\lambda during training, which our experiments reveal is sub-optimal. We present an optimization strategy that alleviates the need to manually tune the relative importance of extrinsic and intrinsic rewards as training progresses. Our method leverages the bias of intrinsic rewards when it is useful for exploration and mitigates this bias when it does not help accumulate higher extrinsic rewards. This is achieved using an extrinsic optimality constraint that forces the extrinsic rewards earned after optimizing the mixed objective to be equal to the extrinsic rewards accumulated by the optimal policy that maximizes extrinsic rewards only. Enforcing the extrinsic optimality constraint in general settings is intractable because the optimal extrinsic reward is unknown. We devise a practical algorithm called Extrinsic-Intrinsic Policy Optimization (EIPO), which uses an approximation to solve this constrained optimization problem (Section 3). While in principle we can apply EIPO to any intrinsic reward method, we evaluate performance using state-of-the-art random network distillation (RND) . Fig. 1(b) presents teaser results on two ATARI games: (i) Montezuma’s Revenge - where joint optimization with RND (red) substantially outperforms a PPO policy 3 optimized with only extrinsic rewards (black); (ii) James Bond - where PPO substantially outperforms RND. These results reinforce the notion that bias introduced by intrinsic rewards helps in some games, but hurts in others. Our algorithm EIPO (blue) matches the best algorithm in both games, showing that it can leverage intrinsic rewards as needed. Results across 61 ATARI games reinforce this finding. Additionally, in some games EIPO outperforms multiple strong baselines with and without intrinsic rewards, indicating that our method can not only mitigate the potential performance decreases caused by intrinsic reward bias, but can also improve performance beyond the current state-of-the-art.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: can be solved by supplementing the task reward (or extrinsic reward rEsubscript𝑟𝐸r_{E}) with a dense exploration bonus (or intrinsic reward rIsubscript𝑟𝐼r_{I}) generated by the agent itself    [ref]7 [ref]8.\nIntrinsic rewards encourage the agent to visit novel states, which increases the chance of encountering states with task reward.
