      "content": "Paper Title: Real-Time Multimodal Cognitive Assistant for Emergency Medical Services\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHuman Action Recognition (HAR) has been extensively studied, with applications in numerous domains such as video surveillance, entertainment, sports,  and medicine   . Previous work has explored various sources of data,  including RGB images, depth information, and wearable sensors. However, within the EMS domain, there is limited work on responder action and intervention recognition.  proposes a method that utilizes a spatial-temporal fusion convolution neural network (CNN) to recognize actions taken place during emergency incidents by responders. However, like most previous works in other domains, this method relies on a significant volume of annotated EMS data [ref]29, which is notably scarce and costly to obtain. Recently, zero-shot learning methods have overcome traditional supervised learning challenges, including the need for extensive annotations [ref]29 and the inability to generalize to different classes [ref]30. For instance, CLIP  excels in zero-shot image classification by associating images with relevant natural language captions. It is trained by contrastive learning based on a large dataset of image-text pairs from the Internet. This paper presents our preliminary work on real-time recognition of EMS interventions using the knowledge of protocol guidelines and zero-short image classification. The real-time recognition of responders’ actions enables monitoring of the critical aspects of interventions (e.g., CPR rate and depth ) and validating them for adherence to established protocol guidelines during training or actual incidents to enhance responders’ skills and quality of care. It can also assist in the automated logging of EMS data and ePCR filing .\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: (CNN) to recognize actions taken place during emergency incidents by responders.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
