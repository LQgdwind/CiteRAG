      "content": "Paper Title: Overcoming Reward Overoptimization via Adversarial Policy Optimization with Lightweight Uncertainty Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe empirically investigate the effectiveness of the two lightweight uncertainty estimation methods introduced in Section 3.2.\nSince our objective is to harness uncertainty in reward modelling to mitigate the overoptimization issue in RLHF, we specifically examine whether the two approaches can identify discrepancies between estimated proxy rewards and gold rewards during the RL stage.\nWe adopt a synthetic setup widely used in the literature  [ref]9 [ref]11, where we train a significantly larger ‚Äúgold-standard‚Äù reward model that simulates human preferences and provides labels for training a proxy reward model. We run a standard RLHF pipeline on the Anthropic HH  and TL;DR dataset[ref]36, with reward and policy models established from LLama-7B .\nThe preference dataset is labelled by the gold reward model. In particular, for the Anthropic HH dataset, the gold reward model is trained from Vicuna-13B 7, and for the TL;DR dataset, the gold reward model is trained from LLama-13B . Additional details, such as gold/proxy reward model training, PPO implementation, etc., can be found in Appendix A.1. During the PPO training stage, we log the generated samples every 10 steps. Subsequently, we compute their gold reward, proxy reward, as well as reward uncertainties associated with the proxy reward.\nWe compare the following uncertainty methods: CI:\nThe uncertainty quantified\nthrough Eq.(3); GP: Gaussian Process uncertainty through Eq.(6); ENS-7B: Ensemble of three LLama7B reward models; ENS-3B: Ensemble of three 3B reward models based on OpenLLaMA3B_v2 . Since there are no officially released 3B models for LLaMA, we adopt OpenLLaMA  which is an open-source smaller reproduction of Meta AI‚Äôs LLaMA, showcasing comparable performance. The results are presented in Figure 1. In Figure 1b and 1d, we depict the correlation between derived uncertainty111Uncertainties calculated by different methods have different scales, so we normalized them to (0,1) for ease of comparison. and the difference between gold reward and proxy reward (i.e., |r‚àó‚Äã(x,y)‚àírœÜ‚Äã(x,y)|superscriptùëüùë•ùë¶subscriptùëüùúëùë•ùë¶|r^{*}(x,y)-r_{\\varphi}(x,y)|). Ideally, an effective uncertainty measure should increase as the difference between gold and proxy reward increases.\nIn Figure 1a and Figure 1c, we illustrate the progression of proxy rewards (blue dashed line), gold rewards (blue solid line), and uncertainties calculated by two lightweight uncertainty estimation methods, along with ENS-3B,\nthroughout the PPO optimization steps. The reward values are indexed on the left y-axis, while the uncertainty is indexed on the right y-axis. These figures provide insight into whether the calculated uncertainties can effectively recognize the over-optimization issue. Our key insights are summarized as follows: ‚àô‚àô\\bullet The lightweight uncertainty estimation methods are effective in signalling over-optimizaton.\nWe observe from Figure 1b and 1d that, as the difference between gold reward and proxy reward increases, the uncertainty calculated by CI and GP also rises. This demonstrates CI and GP indeed carry information on when the proxy reward is drifting away from the ground-truth reward.\nFurthermore, in Figure 1a and 1c, it is evident that when there is a divergence between golden and proxy rewards, indicating over-optimization, the uncertainty calculated by CI and GP generally increases with the optimization steps. This suggests the potential to leverage them to address the over-optimization issue. CI appears to outperform GP since it consistently increases with the divergence of gold and proxy rewards, while GP tends to stabilize after roughly 500500500 steps, as shown in Figure 1c. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet The lightweight uncertainty estimation surpasses reward ensembles with comparable parameter sizes.  Compared to the two lightweight uncertainty estimation methods, ENS-3B appears to be less correlated with the divergence between gold and proxy rewards, particularly on the TL;DR dataset [ref]36. Contrary to our lightweight uncertainty estimation methods, the uncertainty calculated by ENS-3B does not exhibit a monotonically increasing trend with the reward difference between gold and proxy rewards. This is likely due to the fact the smaller reward models, in this case, 3B models, are not able to capture the preference well, thus leading to worse predictions.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: examine whether the two approaches can identify discrepancies between estimated proxy rewards and gold rewards during the RL stage.\nWe adopt a synthetic setup widely used in the literature  [ref]9 [ref]11, where we train a significantly larger ‚Äúgold-standard‚Äù reward model that simulates human preferences and provides labels for training a proxy reward model.
