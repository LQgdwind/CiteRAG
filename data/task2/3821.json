      "content": "Paper Title: Fast Computation of Zigzag PersistenceThis research is partially supported by NSF grant CCF 2049010.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStandard persistent homology defined over a growing sequence\nof simplicial complexes is\na fundamental tool in topological data analysis (TDA). Since the advent of\npersistence algorithm  and its algebraic\nunderstanding , various extensions of the basic concept\nhave been explored    .\nAmong these extensions,\nzigzag persistence introduced by Carlsson and de Silva  is\nan important one. It\nempowered TDA to deal with\nfiltrations where both insertion\nand deletion of simplices are allowed.\nIn practice, allowing deletion of simplices does make the topological tool more powerful.\nFor example, in dynamic networks  \na sequence of graphs may not grow monotonically but can also shrink due to\ndisappearance of vertex connections. Furthermore,\nzigzag persistence seems to be naturally connected with the\ncomputations involving multiparameter\npersistence, see e.g. [ref]16 . Zigzag persistence possesses some key differences\nfrom standard persistence. For example,\nunlike standard (non-zigzag) modules which decompose\ninto only finite and infinite intervals, zigzag modules\ndecompose into four types of intervals (see Definition 2).\nExisting algorithms for computing zigzag persistence from a zigzag filtration   3 \nare all based on maintaining explicitly or implicitly a consistent basis throughout the filtration.\nThis makes these algorithms\nfor zigzag persistence\nmore involved and hence slower in practice\nthan algorithms for\nthe non-zigzag version though they have the same time complexity .\nWe sidestep the bottleneck of maintaining an explicit basis\nand propose an algorithm called FastZigzag, which converts\nthe input zigzag filtration\nto a non-zigzag filtration with an efficient strategy for mapping barcodes of the two bijectively. Then, we can apply any efficient algorithm for standard persistence on the\nresulting non-zigzag filtration to compute the barcode of the original filtration.\nConsidering the abundance of optimizations       of standard persistence algorithms\nand a recent GPU acceleration 9,\nthe conversion in FastZigzag enables zigzag persistence computation\nto take advantage of any existing or future improvements on standard persistence computation.\nOur implementation, which uses the\nPhat  software for computing standard persistence,\nshows substantial performance gain\nover existing state-of-the-art softwares 6 8\nfor computing zigzag persistence\n(see Section 3.5).\nWe make our software publicly available through:\nhttps://github.com/taohou01/fzz. To elaborate on the strategy of FastZigzag, we first observe\na special type of zigzag filtrations\ncalled non-repetitive zigzag filtrations in which\na simplex (or more generally, a cell) is never added again once deleted. Such a filtration\nadmits an up-down filtration as its canonical form that can be\nobtained by a series of diamond switches   .\nThe up-down filtration can be further converted\ninto a non-zigzag filtration again using diamond switches as in the Mayer-Vietoris\npyramid presented in .\nIndividual switches are atomic tools that help us to show equivalence of barcodes, but\nwe do not need to actually execute them in computation.\nInstead, we go straight\nto the final form of the filtration quite easily and efficiently.\nFinally, we observe that any zigzag filtration\ncan be treated as a non-repetitive cell-wise\nfiltration of a ΔΔ\\Delta-complex 0\nconsisting of multisets of input simplices.\nThis means that each repeatedly added\nsimplex is treated as a different cell in the ΔΔ\\Delta-complex,\nso that we can apply\nour findings for non-repetitive filtrations to\narbitrary filtrations.\nThe conversions\ndescribed above are detailed in Section 3.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: but can also shrink due to\ndisappearance of vertex connections. Furthermore,\nzigzag persistence seems to be naturally connected with the\ncomputations involving multiparameter\npersistence, see e.g. [ref]16 .

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
