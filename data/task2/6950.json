      "content": "Paper Title: SyntheWorld: A Large-Scale Synthetic Dataset for Land Cover Mapping and Building Change Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHigh-resolution remote sensing image processing is vital for urban planning, disaster response, and environmental monitoring. Although advances in deep neural networks and the emergence of various benchmark datasets have led to significant progress in these research areas, the unique aspects of remote sensing image processing tasks still present many challenges. First, acquiring large-scale datasets that compare with those in computer vision and natural language processing is difficult due to the sensitivity, privacy, and commercial considerations of remote sensing data. As a result, remote sensing datasets tend to be significantly smaller. Second, compared to fields like computer vision or natural language processing, remote sensing data annotation is both more costly and time-intensive. For example, annotating a 1024×1024102410241024\\times 1024 image from a large land cover mapping dataset such as 8 usually takes more than two hours. Finally, variations in image capture conditions such as sensor type, image acquisition season, and geographical location introduce a severe domain shift problem in remote sensing image processing. Synthetic datasets, with their low-cost acquisition, high fidelity, and diversity, present a viable solution to these challenges. In the field of computer vision, numerous high-quality synthetic datasets  [ref]25    7 have already emerged, primarily serving tasks such as semantic segmentation, depth estimation, optical flow estimation, and 3D reconstruction of street-view and indoor-view scenario. However, high-quality synthetic datasets for remote sensing are scarce in comparison. The most important reason is, as described in , in a virtual world constructed for street-view or indoor-view scenes, the distance between the sensor and the target location is relatively small (a few or tens of meters), with the main focus being on pedestrians, vehicles, road signs, or various furniture, resulting in a relatively small virtual world size. In contrast, in remote sensing scenarios, sensors are often located tens of thousands of meters away from the target virtual world, making even a relatively small virtual world extend over several square kilometers, while maintaining a multitude of diverse targets, such as thousands of trees in different poses and hundreds of buildings of different styles. This makes the construction of large-scale synthetic remote sensing datasets exceptionally challenging. Upon a thorough survey of the available synthetic remote sensing datasets    9 [ref]50 1, we discern that each of them has specific limitations. First, most existing works focus on a single task, such as building segmentation   or object detection 9 [ref]50. However, there is a notable lack of effective synthetic datasets for critical tasks like multi-class land cover mapping and building change detection. Furthermore, these datasets exhibit limited diversity due to constraints associated with the size of the virtual world and the tools used. They either emulate real-world cities to create a limited number of virtual environments or use real remote sensing images as the background. Furthermore, when it comes to 3D models in the virtual world, existing methodologies consistently rely on predefined textures, layouts, and geometries, resulting in a restrictive range of styles for buildings, trees, and other land objects. In this work, we use the freely available open-source 3D modeling software Blender , along with various plugins from the Blender community, GPT-4 , and the Stable Diffusion model 4, to develop a procedural modeling system specifically for generating high-resolution remote sensing datasets. We present SyntheWorld, the largest high-resolution remote sensing image dataset for land cover mapping and building change detection tasks. Fig. 1 displays some examples from the proposed SyntheWorld dataset. The main contributions of this work are: We introduce SyntheWorld, the first fully synthetic high-resolution remote sensing dataset, which integrates procedural 3D modeling techniques with Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). We use SyntheWorld as the first synthetic dataset specifically designed to improve performance in two crucial tasks: multi-class land cover mapping and building change detection. We propose the Relative Distance Ratio (RDR), a new metric designed to quantify the conditions under which the synthetic dataset can drive performance improvements. Through comprehensive experiments on various remote sensing benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: datasets, with their low-cost acquisition, high fidelity, and diversity, present a viable solution to these challenges.
