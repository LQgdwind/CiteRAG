Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: FedCiR: Client-Invariant Representation Learning for Federated Non-IID Features\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBaselines:\nApart from FedAvg [ref]1, we compare FedCiR against several SOTA FL algorithms in solving the non-IID issue, including FedProx [ref]25, FedProc [ref]17, FedGen , and FedSR .\nTo gain more insights from FedCiR, we develop two more\nbaselines: FedReg and FedAlign. Specifically, FedReg only improves the global knowledge for local models with the regularizer ‚Ñír‚Äãe‚Äãgsubscript‚Ñíùëüùëíùëî\\mathcal{L}_{reg}, while FedAlign only utilizes the regularizer ‚Ñía‚Äãl‚Äãi‚Äãg‚Äãnsubscript‚Ñíùëéùëôùëñùëîùëõ\\mathcal{L}_{align} to force the representations to be client-invariant. Datasets:\nWe consider both benchmark and real-world datasets, including DomainNet , PACS , Office-Caltech-10 , Camelyon17 , and Iwildcam , which contain multiple domains of data, e.g., photos, art paintings, cartoon images, and sketch images on PACS.\nFor FL, We consider the feature shift scenarios where each client has only one domain of data that are resized to 128√ó128128128128\\times 128 pixels.\nThe Camelyon17 dataset is a binary classification task for detecting tumors in varying hospitals and the Iwildcam dataset is a multi-class classification task for wildlife animal images captured by cameras at different locations.\nFor the Iwildcam dataset, the data among cameras (clients) are both label-skewed and feature-skewed, and most of them are invalid background data and\nuseless for training.\nTherefore, we only use ten classes of samples in ten of the cameras that have the largest data volume. Moreover, apart from the feature-skewed data distribution, we also evaluate the effectiveness of FedCiR on label-skewed data distribution, where the data in each domain are distributed to multiple clients (number of clients / number of domains) according to the Latent Dirichlet Sampling with varying Dirichlet parameters Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta. Model structures:\nWe use ResNet18  as the backbone for all the datasets.\nFor FedCiR and FedGen, the generator is composed of two fully connected layers with ReLU and BatchNorm layers between them. Hyperparameters:\nIn the main experiments, we set the local updating steps E=20ùê∏20E=20 and communication rounds T=300ùëá300T=300.\nDuring local training, we use SGD with batch size 32, learning rate 0.010.010.01, momentum 0.9, and weight decay 5√ó10‚àí45superscript1045\\times 10^{-4}, as the local optimizer.\nFor FedCiR and FedGen, the server optimizes the generator for 5 steps (Eg=5)subscriptùê∏ùëî5(E_{g}=5) in each communication round.\nMore details of hyperparameters for FedCiR and baselines are available in Appendix E.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Baselines:\nApart from FedAvg [ref]1, we compare FedCiR against several SOTA FL algorithms in solving the non-IID issue, including FedProx [ref]25, FedProc [ref]17, FedGen , and FedSR .\nTo gain more insights from FedCiR, we\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
