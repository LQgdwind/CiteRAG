      "content": "Paper Title: Classifying concepts via visual properties\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe use of media, e.g., videos or photos, is quite pervasive, in particular, but not only, in the Web. This phenomenon extends also to hierarchies, for instance, in the case of eCommerce, where the user is able to seamlessly navigate a catalog where each item is annotated by, usually, an image. The key observation is that, in these situations, the main description is provided in natural language, while photos have a complementary role of integrating visually the main content provided linguistically. ImageNet  is a very important point in case. ImageNet is a very large image database which is extensively used for the training of Deep Neural Networks. It has been built by taking WordNet, its English Version from Princeton , and by populating it with millions of photos collected from the Web. As also described in , the construction of ImageNet has been done in a way to preserve a high level of quality. However, for how it has been constructed, viz. by populating a linguistic hierarchy with photos, there is no guarantee that the photos provide the information that would be needed to build the visual subsumption hierarchy implicitly assumed by WordNet. In other words, while by construction, ImageNet is a hierarchy of classification concepts, there is no evidence that the photos encode also substance concepts. While this will most likely have no implications in the recognition of single substances, some difficulties may arise in case one is interested in learning concept hierarchies, and also any time the problem of the Semantic Gap raises difficulties (see discussion in Section 3). Furthermore notice how these limitations apply to all approaches where linguistic hierarchies are used to classify objects, see, e.g.,\n  or, more generically, to support computer vision, see, e.g., . The goal of the project introduced in this section, whose preliminary name is MultiMedia UKC, is to build a resource very similar to ImageNet but with the key difference of being built following the methodology defined in this paper. The starting point is the Universal Knowledge Core (UKC) ,555An online version of the system can be reached at http://ukc.datascientia.eu/. a multilingual lexical resource now containing more than one thousand languages and more than one hundred thousand classification concepts. Besides its size, both in terms of concepts and languages, which is a strong incentive towards its use, the UKC seems very well suited for our goals as its organization matches quite naturally Ranganathan’s four-phased methodology. Starting from the UKC, we envision the following construction of the MultiMedia UKC: Pre-Idea Stage: This phase is used to construct (substance) concepts by extracting visual objects from media. The media will be selected to depict the terms in the UKC. The extraction of visual objects will be done applying the techniques from [ref]10 ; Idea Plane: This phase is used to construct a visual subsumption hierarchy via visual objects. This is done by applying the methodology described in this paper; Verbal Plane: This phase is used to annotate substance concepts with words, which, in turn, are annotated with synsets , i.e., the set of their synonyms. Synsets are further annotated with their definition (i.e., their gloss) defined in terms of Genus and Differentia. There is one verbal plane per language. This is achieved by aligning the hierarchy constructed in the idea plane with the UKC hierarchy; Notational plane: This phase is used to generate a set of language independent classification concepts, as unique, alinguistic identifiers. This is done reusing the concepts which already exist in the conceptual layer of the UKC. The construction of a multimedia UKC is quite ambitious and it is bound to raise complications in all the first three steps. The notational plane should come for free by reusing the current UKC identifiers. In the pre-idea stage the complexity comes from the issue of how to extract features from media, a problem which can get rather complicated in non-ideal situations, e.g., in presence of noise. The intuition is to solve this problem with the help of the human supervision. In the Idea plane the complication comes from the need of selecting how to apply the canons introduced in Section 4, a task which requires the involvement of an expert. The complication in the verbal plane comes from the need to match the hierarchy built in in the previous step with the hierarchy which already exists in the UKC. In practice we expect the classification process of the second step to be strongly driven by what is already available in the UKC. And for sure there will be a lot of iterations between these two steps. To illustrate the kind of reasoning that we will have to perform while constructing the MultiMedia UKC, we introduce two small examples, which relate to two key tenets of categorization from the work on basic categories by Eleanor Rosch  . The starting point is her empirical observation that in taxonomies (quote from ), “there is one level of abstraction at which the most basic category cuts are made”, where she defines basic categories as “those which carry the most information … and are, thus, the most differentiated from one another”. Coherently with the methodology proposed here, she observes that in perceiving and categorizing objects (quote from ), “objects may be first seen or recognized as members of their basic category, and that only with the aid of additional processing can they be identified as members of their superordinate or subordinate category.” In complement to the above tenet, her second tenet establishes that (quote from ) “basic objects appeared to be the most abstract categories for which an image could be reasonably representative of the class as a whole”. Let us concentrate on the biological taxonomy depicted in Figure 1, as from , where the second classification is a natural language description of the first. Following Rosch’s first tenet, fish is a basic category. In fact, fishes share the maximum number of visual properties amongst themselves and are also most differentiable amongst other sub-categories of aquatic vertebrate (e.g., placoderm and agnathan, not mentioned in the linguistic hierarchy on the right of Figure 1, but depicted in the left figure by the images which annotate the nodes above the node associated to fish). The first example considers the situation when we move upwards from the basic category fish, therefore increasing extension. Here the role of the canon of increasing/decreasing extension provides the logical means of organizing the superordinate categories into a taxonomically clean chain.\nLet us consider for instance the concept of aquatic vertebrate. In Figure 1 the big union symbol sign means that the extension of this concept should be taken as the disjoint union of the elements depicted.\nAs the picture suggests, this concept cannot be visually recognized by any representative image and can only be perceived by considering the images of all the different basic categories, e.g., fish, placoderm and agnathan. In other words more abstract substance concepts should be constructed by joining the substance concepts of the child concepts. But this comes for free, and the distinction is only linguistic and not visual as, also for the lower categories, e.g., fish, substance concepts are the union of distinct and different visual objects.\nThis is a general phenomenon which we believe it will apply any time we will move towards the root of the hierarchy and that, it seems, has been largely overlooked so far in the mainstream computer vision literature. Another example is the concept of vehicle, which can only be visualized as the union of the extension of its subordinate concepts, some of which are basic categories, e.g., car, bike, ship, train.\nDually, the subordinate categories of fish, e.g., blueback salmon chinook salmon, on the other hand, can be visually recognized by incrementally recognizing the finer visual properties of the basic category fish (decreasing extension) over successive encounters. However how far down it is possible to go in the recognition of the subordinate categories before falling into Rosch’s second tenet, is an open question for which, at the moment we have no answer. We expect that it will vary a lot from one basic category to another. The canon of modulation, on the other hand, logically facilitates the identification of co-extensiveness of the categories which are superordinate and subordinate to the basic categories by ensuring the impossibility of missing links. As a matter of fact, this factor definitely confirms the primacy of basic categories in the process of perception. For example, a recognition of rainbow trout as a subordinate category of fish thus skipping trout as the category between fish and raimbow trout fails in its very purpose of incremental visual classification as it will bring up rainbow trout to the same level of visual co-extensiveness as salmon. Further, if the system visually recognizes trout to be the basic category and aquatic vertebrate to be its immediate superordinate category, the system fails in its adherence to human-like vision which, as has been extensively established in  , recognizes fish as a biological basic category. Thus, to restate, the impossibility of missing links (and hence, the canon of modulation) ensures the primacy of basic categories. This at the moment is only an intuition. We believe that the construction of the MultiMedia UKC will allow to (dis)confirm this intuition quantitatively.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: (substance) concepts by extracting visual objects from media.
