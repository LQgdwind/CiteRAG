      "content": "Paper Title: SimCLF: A Simple Contrastive Learning Framework for Function-level Binary Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEmbedding is the transformation of discrete variables into a high-dimensional continuous space. In embedding-based solutions, functions are not compared based on the function itself, but instead on the learned embedding of functions. First, binary functions are transformed into multi-dimensional vector representations (embeddings). These embeddings are then compared using simple geometric operations . Functions with similar semantics have embeddings that are closer to each other in the high-dimensional space. In literature , the authors proposed a function embedding solution called Asm2Vec. Asm2Vec transforms the assembly code into embeddings by Word2Vec[ref]34. The function representations are learned by using code embeddings based on the PV-DM model [ref]26. Some articles employ graph embedding methods. For instance,  use a neural network-based approach to learn the embedding of an Attributed Control Flow Graph (ACFG). Initially, SAFE  employs Word2Vec to convert the instructions into embeddings. A GRU Recurrent Neural Network (GRU RNN) is then used to capture the sequential interaction of the instructions. The success of pure attention networks in the NLP domain such as Transformer  and BERT  has inspired the adoption of Transformer-like structures in BCSD. All of these articles [ref]25 employ architectural structures that are rooted in the pure attention pre-training model, yielding remarkable outcomes. In , the authors adopt a method based on BERT, where they pre-train the binary code using BERT at both the one-token and one-block levels. Then Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used on adjacency matrices to extract the order information. PalmTree  utilizes three pre-training tasks to capture various characteristics of assembly language and generate general-purpose instruction embeddings. These pre-training tasks are performed through self-supervised training on large-scale unlabelled binary corpora. TREX  develops a novel neural architecture, a hierarchical Transformer, which can learn execution semantics from micro-traces during the pre-training phase. jTrans is the first solution that embeds control flow information of binary code into Transformer-based language models. However, none of these papers have investigated the quality of the embedding that they’ve learned. Our experiments indicated that the issue of representation collapse exists in code embedding based on pre-trained models.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: closer to each other in the high-dimensional space.
