Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Review-Incorporated Model-Agnostic Profile Injection Attacks on Recommender Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConventional shilling attacks [ref]1 such as Random and Bandwagon rely on global statistics and work mainly for traditional collaborative filtering (CF) (e.g., user-based KNN) [ref]9. The attacks are simple heuristics-based and not transferable among different RSs (e.g., item-based KNN) . The lack of diversity in data generation makes them easy to be detected [ref]9.\nSome algorithm-specific poisoning attacks are proposed to optimize for specific types of RSs, such as matrix factorization-based [ref]2 and graph-based . However, their effectiveness to DL-based RSs  is limited. An attack  is proposed for DL-based under gray-box settings, which overestimates its practical performance. Since the methods are primarily concerned with optimizing attack performance, they lack of imperceptibility. Recently, more efforts have been made to leverage GANs for effective profile generation, e.g., DCGAN , AUSH , TrialAttack , RecUP  and Leg-UP [ref]9. However, their attack profiles contain only ratings, which is not applicable to review-based RSs. To address these issues, we propose R-Trojan, a review-enhanced attack framework.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Conventional shilling attacks [ref]1 such as Random and Bandwagon rely on global statistics and work mainly for traditional collaborative filtering (CF) (e.g., user-based KNN) [ref]9.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
