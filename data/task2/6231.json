      "content": "Paper Title: Prediction Error-based Classification for Class-Incremental Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe largely follow the experimental setup from . In the implementation of PEC, we match the parameter counts and the number of optimization steps with those used for VAE-GC in¬†. We compare PEC against a comprehensive list of CIL methods; we provide explanations for the methods that were not included in our main text experiments in Appendix¬†C.1.2. For some datasets, namely MNIST [ref]12, Fashion-MNIST , and CIFAR-10 , we directly use raw image data. For others, namely CIFAR-100  and CORe50 [ref]29, we use pretrained frozen feature extractors, which are applied on the raw data before further processing; we follow , using the same feature extractors. Below we briefly summarize the experimental setup for the particular datasets: MNIST and Fashion-MNIST: we use (5/2)52(5/2) task split. Optimization for 200020002000 steps per task, or 100010001000 steps per class, with batch size =128absent128=128. MLP is used as an architecture, no feature extractor is used. Parameter count per class for VAE-GC and PEC methods: 150‚ÄãK150ùêæ150K. CIFAR-10: we use (5/2)52(5/2) task split. Optimization for 500050005000 steps per task, or 250025002500 steps per class, with batch size =256absent256=256. Simple networks with convolutions and linear layers are used as architectures, no feature extractor is used. Parameter count per class for VAE-GC and PEC methods: 350‚ÄãK350ùêæ350K. CIFAR-100: we use (10/10)1010(10/10) task split. Optimization for 500050005000 steps per task, or 500500500 steps per class, with batch size =256absent256=256. MLP is used as an architecture, a simple convolutional network pre-trained on CIFAR-10 is used as a feature extractor. Parameter count per class for VAE-GC and PEC methods: 180‚ÄãK180ùêæ180K. CORe50: we use (5/2)52(5/2) task split. For this dataset, we only perform one pass through the data during training. We use batch size =1absent1=1. MLP is used as an architecture, ResNet18 [ref]18 pre-trained on ImageNet  is used as a feature extractor. Parameter count per class for VAE-GC and PEC methods: 170‚ÄãK170ùêæ170K. In all experiments, we use the Adam  optimizer. We set the learning rate to the standard value of 0.0010.0010.001, with the following exceptions: for the CORe50 experiments, LR is set to 0.00030.00030.0003 for PEC and 0.00010.00010.0001 for other methods; for the CIFAR-100 experiments, LR is set to 0.00010.00010.0001 for discriminative approaches and standard 0.0010.0010.001 otherwise. Additionally, for all PEC experiments, the learning rate decays linearly to 00 through the training. For VAE-GC we use 10‚ÄãK10ùêæ10K importance samples to estimate likelihoods. The method-specific hyperparameters of SI, EWC and AR1 are selected based on the grid search described in¬†. While for the experiments in Tables¬†1 and¬†2 the shrinkage parameter œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon of SLDA was tuned, for the experiments in this section the default value of 0.00010.00010.0001 is used. For VAE-GC experiments on MNIST, we additionally include batch normalization in the architecture, since we observed it improves performance. Additionally, in order to ensure a fair comparison with VAE-GC, the best-performing baseline in these experiments, we run a grid search for this method where we incorporate the following elements that are used with PEC: linear learning rate decay and GELU activation function¬†. These did not improve the results for VAE-GC.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: PEC against a comprehensive list of CIL methods; we provide explanations for the methods that were not included in our main text experiments in Appendix¬†C.1.2.
