      "content": "Paper Title: RulE: Knowledge Graph Reasoning with Rule Embedding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEmbedding-based methods \nEmbedding-based methods aim to learn embeddings for entities and relations and estimate the plausibility of unobserved triplets based on these learned embeddings. Some representative works include TransE [ref]7, DistMult [ref]23, RotatE , ComplEx , TuckER  and BoxE methods . They view a relation as some operation or mapping function between entities to capture common relation patterns (e.g., symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion and composition). These approaches learn representations solely based on triplets (zeroth-order logic) contained in the given KG. In contrast, our approach is able to embody more complex first-order logical rules in the embedding space by jointly modeling entities, relations and logical rules in a unified framework. Rule-based methods \nLearning logical rules for knowledge graph reasoning has also been extensively studied.\nAs one of the early efforts, Quinlan  uses Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to derive logical rules (hypothesis) from all the training samples in a KG.\nMarkov Logic Networks (MLNs)    [ref]29 define the joint distribution of given variables (observed facts) and hidden variables (missing facts) such that missing facts can be inferred in the probabilistic graphical model.\nAMIE  and AMIE+  first enumerate possible rules and then learn a scalar weight for each rule to encode its quality.\nNeural-LP  and DRUM  mine rules by simultaneously learning logic rules and their weights based on TensorLog . RNNLogic  simultaneously trains a rule generator and reasoning predictor to generate high-quality logical rules. NCRL  infers rule head by recursively merging atomic compositions in rule body. Except for RNNLogic, the above methods solely use the learned logical rules for reasoning, which suffer from brittleness and are hardly competitive with embedding-based reasoning in most benchmarks. Although RNNLogic considers the effect of KGE during inference, it\npretrains KGE separately from logical rule learning without jointly modeling KGE and logical rules in the same space. Most existing works focus on mining rules from observed triplets. In contrast, we focus on the setting where rules are already given (either mined from KG or provided as prior knowledge) and the task is to leverage the rules for better inference. Thus, in principle, our framework can be combined with any rule mining model to improve their rule usage. Joint KGE and logical rules \nSome recent work tries to incorporate logical rules into KGE models to improve the generalization performance of KGE reasoning. KALE  and RUGE  use logical rules to infer new facts as additional training data for KGE. Several other works inject rules via regularization terms during training, including Wang et al.  and Ding et al. . These methods leverage logical rules only to enhance KGE training and do not really perform reasoning with logical rules. Although Meilicke et al.  combines symbolic and embedding-based methods, it only loosely ensembles the rankings generated by embedding-based and symbolic methods.\nIn contrast, our method jointly learns entity/relation/rule embeddings in a unified space, which is shown to enhance KGE itself. With the learned rule embedding, RulE can also perform logical rule inference in a soft way, improving the rule-based reasoning process. Moreover, the combination of both further advance the performance.\n GNN-based methods \nRecently, there are some KG reasoning works based on graph neural networks    . They exploit neighboring information via message-passing mechanisms, which are empirically powerful and can be applied to the inductive setting. However, they usually suffer from high complexity. Furthermore, these methods cannot leverage prior/domain knowledge presented as logical rules, its interpretability is built on path-explanation of the predictions.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: methods aim to learn embeddings for entities and relations and estimate the plausibility of unobserved triplets based on these learned embeddings.
