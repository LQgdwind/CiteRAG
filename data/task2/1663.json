      "content": "Paper Title: ECO: Enabling Energy-Neutral IoT Devices through Runtime Allocation of Harvested Energy\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nResearch and development of the Internet of Things have grown considerably in the recent past . This growth has been enabled by advances in sensor technologies, low-power processing, and communication technologies. IoT devices have applications in a wide range of fields such as wearable health monitoring, environmental monitoring, smart cities, digital agriculture, and robotics      [ref]20.\nIoT devices are deployed either as a network of multiple devices or single nodes, depending on the application requirements. For instance, environmental monitoring and smart city applications typically use a wide-area network along with infrastructure to cover the area of interest    . Similarly, health monitoring applications use a single node or smaller body area networks  . One of the challenges of IoT devices is limited battery size due to small form-factor, especially in wearable devices.\nThe small battery severely constrains the energy budget of the device and battery lifetime.\nRecent work has proposed harvesting energy from ambient sources, such as light, motion, electromagnetic waves, and body heat, to alleviate the issue.\nPrior studies have shown that ambient light has the highest potential for EH with power levels of >>1 mW and <<100 μ𝜇\\muW in outdoor (5000 lux) and indoor (500 lux) conditions, respectively, with an 8.1 cm2 flexible PV-cell .\nSimilarly, human motion EH can yield about 15 μ𝜇\\muW with a 23.8 cm2 piezoelectric patch during walking .\nIn comparison, RF EH harvests 10 μ𝜇\\muW with an 18.4 cm2 flexible antenna with -10 dBm @ 915 MHz , and body heat EH has power levels of about 3 μ𝜇\\muW with a 1 cm2 flexible harvester at 15 ∘C ambient temperature (i.e., temperature difference of 22 ∘C) . Energy harvesting requires algorithms that allocate the harvested energy to the device so that sufficient energy is available at all times of the day  .\nFor instance, light energy is typically available during the day.\nThus, the device has to store sufficient energy for use during the night.\nKansal et al.  present the general framework of energy-neutral operation for energy harvesting devices. Energy-neutral operation (ENO) ensures that the total energy consumed in a given period, such as a day, is equal to the energy harvested during the same period.\nTo achieve this, the authors propose a linear programming approach that adapts the device’s duty cycle under energy constraints.\nThe work in  proposes a long-term energy management algorithm, referred to as long term-ENO, that aims to achieve energy neutrality for one year or more.\nSimilarly, Geissdoerfer et al.  propose a feedback controller to achieve long-term-ENO.\nWhile these approaches are helpful, they do not consider the application requirements, user activity patterns, or the stochastic nature of energy harvesting. The stochastic nature of energy harvesting has prompted researchers to investigate approaches that aim to account for the stochasticity    [ref]35. These approaches typically model stochastic optimization as a Markov decision process and develop policies to perform the energy management. Unfortunately, these approaches still do not consider the stochasticity arising from user activities.\nFor example, the harvested energy changes significantly if the user moves indoors after being in the sun. User and context-aware approaches aim to address this issue by leveraging knowledge about the user’s activities to reduce the power consumption of the device  .\nThese approaches focus only on power management and do not account for energy harvesting.\nTherefore, there is a need for approaches that account for variations in harvested energy due to environmental conditions and user activities. This work presents a novel approach to enable energy-neutral operation under varying energy harvesting conditions.\nOur prior work addressed a similar problem .\nHowever, it relaxes the minimum battery energy constraints and assumes an impractical logarithmic utility function to derive a closed-form solution.\nIn contrast, the ECO framework uses a light-weight rollout technique that supports arbitrary utility functions and finds the energy allocations without relaxing any constraints.\nThe rollout phase implicitly accounts for the harvested energy variations due to environmental conditions and user activities. Specifically, we start with an initial energy allocation using the expected EH values.\nThen, we use the rollout algorithm at runtime to make adjustments to the energy allocation as a function of the deviations in energy harvesting.\nFurthermore, the proposed technique is evaluated using ATUS data of 4772 users with light and motion EH modalities.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: communication technologies.
