      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Lightweight Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation via External Attention-enhanced Graph Convolution Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSequential Recommendation (SR) aims to capture the user’s dynamic behavioral pattern from the interaction sequence that has attracted immense research attention and has wide applications in many domains, such as electronic commerce, online retrieval, and mobile services     .\nThough some SR methods have achieved great success in many popular tasks, they meet the challenge while characterizing user preferences from the sparse data or cold-start scenarios.\nTherefore,  Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (CSR) is gaining increasing research attention that mitigates the above problem by leveraging the side information from other domains [ref]37.\nThe key idea of CSR is to recommend the next-item to the overlapped user whose historical interactions can observe in multiple domains during the same period. Early  Cross-domain Sequential Recommender systems (CSRs) incorporate a  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based structure   to capture the sequential dependencies from the hybrid sequence but fail to model the associations among cross-domain entities.\nThen, the attention-based methods, e.g., Chen et al.  and Li et al. 0, adopt dual-attention structures that attentively transfer the users’ sequential preference between domains but have difficulty excavating structural patterns inside the sequential transitions.\nRecently proposed  Graph Convolution Network (GCN)-based methods [ref]37 0 2 for CSR tasks bridge two domains by the  Cross-domain Sequential (CDS) graph and transfer the fine-grained domain knowledge by considering structural information.\nHowever, the volume and computational complexity of such graph-based methods are enormous, resulting in the low running efficiency of models, which hinders their deployment on generic devices with limited memory (e.g., GPUs). To realize the memory-efficient lightweight recommender system, recent studies  3 8 predominantly focus on compressing the original collaborative filtering matrix to improve the recommendation efficiency.\nHowever, the dependency between the origin representations might be disturbed in the process of embedding transformation, and the user’s interest migration in a period also can not be sufficiently modeled.\nThen, to explore the evolution and migration of users’ preferences from a lightweight perspective, some researchers  7 shift their focus to transformer-based models.\nNevertheless, the self-attention mechanism within the Transformer  has quadratic complexity that brings a heavy parameter scale.\nSimilar problems also exist in CSRs, even worse, because they need to share information across two domains, which leads to a doubling of the parameter size.\nHence, developing the lightweight CSRs is an ongoing trend, but accompanied by two significant challenges:\n1) As mentioned earlier, the current CSRs begin to use complex and in-depth models such as graph convolution networks [ref]37 0 to learn the primary preference for users, which brings a lot of burden for model training but contributes little to the node representation learning.\n2) The global relevance weighting strategy (e.g., the Transformer-based methods) 2  7 may not be the optimal scheme to capture the sequential behavioral pattern, as it has enormous computational complexity and ignore the positional relations of the item from the dual-domain hybrid sequence. In this work, we propose a novel  Lightweight External Attention-enhanced Graph Convolution Network (LEA-GCN) to address the above challenges.\nConcretely, we first extract the positional information of each item in the original hybrid sequence to better capture the inter-domain behavior evolution of overlapped users.\nThen, we construct the  Cross-domain Sequential (CDS) graph and model the complicated inner-domain associations among users and items, such as the user-item interactions and the sequential orders of items in each domain.\nAfter that, we take two steps to simplify the GCN encoder:\n1) By removing the feature transformation matrices and the non-linear activation function (i.e., like the LightGCN 5 does on NGCF ), we only keep the simple weighted sum aggregator in GCN to capture the collaborative filtering signals from both domains.\n2) Then, we adopt the  Single-Layer Aggregating Protocol (SLAP), which reduces the complexity of layer propagation and simultaneously avoids the interference caused by high-order connectivity in the CDS graph.\nTo address the second challenge, we adopt a newly proposed technology, named  External Attention (EA), which has attracted extensive research attention in the field of Computer Vision (CV)  3.\nEA uses two external memory units to optimize the computational complexity of the traditional self-attention mechanism, which surprisingly matches our lightweight purpose.\nHowever, the external storage units are independent of the input features, which leads to the deficiency in modeling items’ collaborative filtering signal.\nTo avoid that, we devise a dual-channel EA-based sequence encoder to learn the user-specific sequential pattern.\nIt simultaneously calculates the correlation between items and the external memory units by a multi-head structure and the relation score of each item in the sequence via a  Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).\nThe main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: After pointing out the defects of existing CSR methods in parameter scale and training efficiency, we propose a lightweight GCN-based scheme, namely LEA-GCN, for the memory-efficient cross-domain sequential recommendation. We improve the GCN by simplifying the network structure and using the single-layer aggregation protocols. Then, we devise a dual-channel external attention to model the user’s sequential preference in a lightweight perspective. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that LEA-GCN performs better and requires fewer parameters than several state-of-the-art baselines.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: scenarios.\nTherefore,  Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (CSR) is gaining increasing research attention that mitigates the above problem by leveraging the side information from other domains [ref]37.\nThe key idea of CSR is to recommend the next-item to the overlapped user whose historical interactions can observe in multiple domains during the same period.
