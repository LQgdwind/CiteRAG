      "content": "Paper Title: DualVGR: A Dual-Visual Graph Reasoning Unit for Video Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are three research directions about image question answering. The first line, namely monolithic method  , locates the most relevant visual region of images based on attention mechanism, then projects visual features and textual features together into a common latent space through a single step. Antol et al.  combine the visual features and the textual features via multimodal pooling, such as addition and concatenation, then map them into a unified space. However, multimodal pooling methods do not well capture the complex associations between two modalities due to their different distributions. Therefore, some approaches  related to Bilinear Pooling, which has been used to integrate different CNN features for fine-grained image recognition , have been proposed. However, Bilinear Pooling needs a huge number of parameters and the dimensionality of output feature is usually too high. Some extended versions are proposed to handle these issues, such as Multimodal Compact Bilinear Pooling (MCB) , Hadamard Product for Low-rank Bilinear Pooling (MLB) , Multimodal Factorized Bilinear Pooling (MFB)  and Multimodal Factorized High-order pooling (MFH) . Monolithic methods have been demonstrated useful in some cases, but failed to perform well in long and compositional questions. The second line focuses on modeling the multi-step interaction process through a recurrent cell 8 9   . Nguyen and Okatani 8, Yang et al. 9 stack the attention layers to model the multi-step interaction process. Xiong et al.  introduce a novel dynamic memory network to iteratively retrieve meaningful visual contents. Meanwhile, some approaches  [ref]3  aim to integrate relational reasoning in each step, especially graph-based methods. Li et al. [ref]3 model multi-type inter-object relations via a graph attention mechanism to learn question-adaptive relation representations. The third line is neural-symbolic reasoning. This kind of methods decompose the whole task into some subtasks, and design several Neural Module Networks (NMN)        to solve those subtasks. Andreas et al.  firstly utilize an off-the-shelf parser to decompose the compositional question into logical expressions, then construct a monolithic network for each subtask. Hu et al.  claim that a brittle off-the-shelf semantic parser would lead to bad performance, hence they design a seq-to-seq RNN to end-to-end predict instance-specific layout. These kinds of methods receive good performances on synthetic datasets , as the questions are easy to parse into subtasks. Besides, Yi et al.  propose a CLEVRER dataset for exploring the problem of temporal and causal reasoning in videos. This dataset further promotes the development of the neuro-symbolic reasoning research in video-related tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: attention layers to model the multi-step interaction process.
