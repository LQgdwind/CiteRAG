      "content": "Paper Title: Investigating Typed Syntactic Dependencies for Targeted Sentiment Classification Using Graph Attention Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost work along the first line splits a given input sentence into two sections, including the target mention and its context. Features are extracted from each section and combining the features for making prediction.\nFor example, Vo and Zhang  use word2vec embeddings and pooling mechanisms for extracting features from target mention and its left and right context, respectively, before concatenating all the features for classification.\nZhang et al.  use gated recurrent neural network for extracting features from target mentions and its context, before further defining a gate to integrate such features.\nTang et al.  exploit two long-short memory network (LSTM [ref]24) for feature encoding, and combine the last hidden state of two networks for classification. There are also attempts exploiting convolutional neural networks (CNN) for targeted sentiment classification.\nFor instance,\nHuang and Carley [ref]13 use parameterized filters and parameterized gates to incorporate aspect information into CNN, and apply the resulting CNN to encode the sentence.\nXue and Li [ref]25 further employ a gated CNN layer to extract aspect-specific features from the hidden states originated from a bi-directional RNN layer. The attention mechanism   is also shown to be useful for the task.\nMa et al.  use a bidirectional attention network, which learns attention weights from the target mention to its context vectors, to model the target-context relationship.\nLi et al.  further improve the attention-based models with position information.\nTang et al.  introduce a self-supervised attention learning approach, which automatically mines useful supervision information to refine attention mechanisms. In addition to attention, Memory networks have also been applied to this task.\nTang et al.  develop a deep memory network (MemNet), which uses pre-trained word vectors as a memory and exploits attention mechanism to update the memory.\nChen et al.  improve MemNet by taking the hidden states generated by LSTM as memory and adopting gated recurrent units (GRU) to update the representation of target mentions.\nWang et al.  deploy a targeted sensitive memory network for better information integration. Recently, contextualized language models such as BERT , GPT 0 and ALBERT 1 ELECTRA 2 have shown their usefulness for a wide range of natural language inference (NLI) works.\nWith regard to the task of targeted sentiment classification, Song et al. 3 use BERT to encode a target mention and it context, before applying attention to draw semantic interaction between targets and context words.\nGao et al. 4 further introduce several variants to apply BERT for targeted sentiment classification, showing that incorporating target mention is helpful for BERT based models.\nSun et al. 5 propose to construct an auxiliary sentence from the aspect and convert aspect-based sentiment classification into a\nsentence-pair classification task.\nXu et al. 6 re-train a BERT model on a customer reviews dataset and use the resulting model for targeted sentiment classification.\nLi et al. 7 explore BERT for end-to-end targeted sentiment classification, jointly learning to predict the target mentions and its sentiment polarity. It has been shown that BERT contains implicit syntactic information, which can be useful for downstream tasks 8 9. In contrast to these efforts, however, we make explicit use of syntactic information by encoding discrete structures. Our method is orthogonal to the implicit use of knowledge in BERT, and can be combined with contextualized embeddings.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: neural network for extracting features from target mentions and its context, before further defining a gate to integrate such features.\nTang et al.  exploit two long-short memory network (LSTM [ref]24) for feature encoding, and combine the last hidden state of two networks for classification. There are also attempts exploiting convolutional neural networks (CNN) for targeted sentiment\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
