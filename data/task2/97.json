Previous applications of unsupervised machine learning methods demonstrated the existence of social and cultural biases embedded in the statistical properties of language, but little research has been conducted with respect to the biases in transfer learning models for faces or people and even less attention has been paid to the intersection of machine learning and first appearance bias  . Jacques Junior et al.  review the use of computer vision to anticipate personality traits. Yang and Glaser  use a novel long-short term memory (LSTM) approach to predict first impressions of the Big Five personality traits after 15 seconds of exposure to various facial expressions. Most notably, Safra et al. [ref]37 also train a model on a subset of the computer-generated faces produced by Todorov et al. .\nThey learn to predict subjective trustworthiness ratings with facial action units, or facial configurations such as smiling and frowning, and use their model to analyze the evolution of trustworthiness in portraiture. The authors claim that their model can be used to predict trustworthiness for selfies and historical portraits, but the correlation between their model’s predictions and subjective ratings from human annotators in external datasets is low. We clarify their results with several modifications: first, we train on Black and Asian faces, in addition to Caucasian faces; second, we use transfer learning to obtain more generalized face representations; and third, we extract representations of the entire face to capture biases related to face structure and color, not just facial actions such as smiling and frowning. There is a serious concern that face recognition and face modeling techniques may propagate cognitive and historical biases entrenched in human annotations and model design. Our study investigates part of this concern: we evaluate whether first impression appearance biases can be learned with off-the-shelf face processing technology. Can we observe the same biased effects in real-world datasets with a predictive model?\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: There is a wealth of literature measuring the stereotypes perpetuated by image classifiers and other machine learning models, from search results to automated captioning  [ref]17 .
