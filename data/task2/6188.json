      "content": "Paper Title: ChatAgri: Exploring Potentials of ChatGPT on Cross-linguistic Agricultural Text Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor a significant period of time in the past, the predominant approach for addressing the agricultural text processing problems was based on traditional machine learning methodologies. Xu et al.  proposed a novel method to predict the rise and fall of agricultural exports, called agricultural exports time series-long short-term memory (AETS-LSTM). AETS-LSTM achieves improved prediction performance that predicts the tendencies of the agricultural exports, which is effective way to help agribusiness operators to make better evaluations and adjustment policies. To identify the pests and diseases symptoms of rice farming, Costa et al.  build a knowledge-based system that used jaccard similarity coefficient (JSC), which performs tokenizing, filtering and porter stemming to extract critical information to deliver pests and disease problem. Feature engineering-based methods were limited by their inability to capture the complexity and nuances of natural language, particularly when it comes to some semantic complex situations [ref]26. With the emergence of PLMs [31; 35; 1; 2], a powerful technique that revolutionized the field of NLP, many traditional methods [7; 36; 30] has been substituted [ref]8. Since then, the PLM-based fine-tuning paradigm has been propelled to be the mainstream learning technique for various agricultural information processing [ref]37. PLM-based fine-tuning paradigm is designed by introducing additional network parameters and fine-tuning PLMs to downstream tasks using task-specific objective functions.\nCao et al.  developed an improved BERT-based model to extract complete semantic information for the task of sentiment analysis in agricultural product reviews. The goal was to assist consumers in making informed purchasing decisions. They utilized TensorFlow to fine-tune the whole parameters of BERT and its downstream classifier to obtain a well-optimized model. Jin et al.  proposed a dictionary knowledge infused network, DictABSA, for sentiment analysis and agricultural text classification. Nevertheless, these PLM-based fine-tuned models may not generalize well to new scenarios and required significant amount of annotated data, making it hard to be quickily developed and easily deployed. As a result, the role of traditional PLM-based fine-tuning has gradually diminished in NLP, being replaced by a more promising learning paradigm known as “prompt learning” or “prompt-tuning”, according to a recent survey . Different from the PLM-based fine-tune paradigm, prompt-tuning follows the original LM training which adapts the downstream task to the PLM itself with the help of constructed prompting templates, thus especially performing well in few-shot or even zero-shot scenarios. Lyu et al.  investigate the effect of different optimized prompts on the performance of the improved plain-language translations of the radiology report. Liu et al.  proposed P-Tuning, a novel method that automatically searches for prompts in the continuous space to improve the performance of PLMs. It uses a few continuous free parameters as prompts and optimizes them using gradient descent. Experiments proved that P-Tuning brings substantial improvements to GPTs, even outperforms BERT models to some extent. Liu et al.  also introduced P-Tuning v2, a enhanced continuous prompt optimization method of P-Tuning . P-Tuning v2 represents a significant improvement over P-Tuning by using continuous prompts for every layer of the PLM, rather than just the input layer, increasing the capacity of continuous prompts and helping to close the gap to fine-tuning across the small models and hard tasks. Hu et al.  devised a novel knowledge enhanced method for text classification, namely knowledgeable prompt-tuning (KPT). It incorporates rich external knowledge from knowledge bases (KBs) into the prompt verbalizer to better stimulate the internal knowledge in PLMs.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: problem.
