The recent FROMP approach of Pan et al. [ref]45 is closest to ours where the form of the functional divergence used is similar to our suggestion in\nEq. 14. Specifically, comparing with Eq. 14, their functional divergence correspond to the vector 𝐝msubscript𝐝𝑚\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\mathbf{d}$}$}_{m} with the i𝑖i’th entry as h​(f𝐰​(𝐮i))−h​(f𝐰∗​(𝐮i))ℎsubscript𝑓𝐰subscript𝐮𝑖ℎsubscript𝑓subscript𝐰subscript𝐮𝑖h(f_{\\text{\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\mathbf{w}$}$}}}(\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\mathbf{u}$}$}_{i}))-h(f_{\\text{\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\mathbf{w}$}$}}_{*}}(\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\mathbf{u}$}$}_{i})) for 𝐮i∈ℳsubscript𝐮𝑖ℳ\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\mathbf{u}$}$}_{i}\\in\\mathcal{M}, and the matrix 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} is (can be seen as Nystrom approximation), where 𝚲​(𝐰)𝚲𝐰\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}$}$}(\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\mathbf{w}$}$}) is a diagonal matrix with h′​(f𝐰​(𝐮i))superscriptℎ′subscript𝑓𝐰subscript𝐮𝑖h^{\\prime}(f_{\\text{\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\mathbf{w}$}$}}}(\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\mathbf{u}$}$}_{i})) as the i𝑖i’th diagonal entry, and 𝐆​(𝐰∗)=∇𝐟​(𝐰∗)⊤​𝚲​(𝐰∗)​∇𝐟​(𝐰∗)+δ​𝐈𝐆subscript𝐰∇𝐟superscriptsubscript𝐰top𝚲subscript𝐰∇𝐟subscript𝐰𝛿𝐈\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\mathbf{G}$}$}(\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\mathbf{w}$}$}_{*})=\\nabla\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\mathbf{f}$}$}(\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\mathbf{w}$}$}_{*})^{\\top}\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}$}$}(\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\mathbf{w}$}$}_{*})\\nabla\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\mathbf{f}$}$}(\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\mathbf{w}$}$}_{*})+\\delta\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\mathbf{I}$}$} is the GGN matrix.\nThey also propose to use ‘memorable past’ examples obtained by sorting h′​(f𝐰∗i)superscriptℎ′superscriptsubscript𝑓subscript𝐰𝑖h^{\\prime}(f_{\\mathbf{w}_{*}}^{i}), which is consistent with our theory (see Eq. 11). Based on our work, we can interpret the approach of Pan et al. [ref]45 as a mechanism to reconstruct the gradient of the past, which gives very good performance in practice. Another related approach is the gradient episodic memory (GEM) , where the goal is to ensure that the ∑i∈ℳ[ℓ​(yi,f𝐰∗i)−ℓ​(yi,f𝐰i)]<0subscript𝑖ℳdelimited-[]ℓsubscript𝑦𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑓subscript𝐰𝑖ℓsubscript𝑦𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑓𝐰𝑖0\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{M}}[\\ell(y_{i},f_{\\mathbf{w}_{*}}^{i})-\\ell(y_{i},f_{\\text{\\mbox{$\\mbox{$\\mathbf{w}$}$}}}^{i})]<0. This is similar in spirit to the student-teacher transfer of Vapnik and Izmailov  where the loss of the student is regularized using the model output of the teacher (see Eq. 7 in Vapnik and Izmailov  for an example). Lopez-Paz and Ranzato  relax the optimization problem to write it in terms of the gradients, which is similar to K-priors, except that K-priors use a first-order optimization method, which is simpler than the dual approach used in\nLopez-Paz and Ranzato . Most of these approaches do not employ a weight-space divergence, and sometimes even the function-space divergence is replaced by the Euclidean one [ref]7 [ref]9. Often, the input locations are sampled randomly, or using a simple replay method [ref]9 which could be suboptimal.\nSome approaches propose computationally-expensive methods for choosing examples to store in memory  , and some can be seen as related to choosing points with high leverage .\nThe approach in Titsias et al.  uses inducing inputs which is closely connected to the online GP update. The method we proposed does not contradict with these, but gives a more direct way to choose the points where the gradient errors are taken into consideration.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: K-priors is closely related to recent functional regularization approaches proposed for deep continual learning   [ref]7   [ref]45 [ref]9.
