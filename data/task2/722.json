      "content": "Paper Title: Coded Elastic Computing on Machines with Heterogeneous Storage and Computation Speed\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nf𝑓fαfsubscript𝛼𝑓\\alpha_{f}m​[ref]1𝑚delimited-[]1m[ref]1m​[ref]2𝑚delimited-[]2m[ref]2m​[ref]3𝑚delimited-[]3m[ref]3m​𝑚delimited-[]4mm​𝑚delimited-[]5mm​𝑚delimited-[]6mL′superscript𝐿′L^{\\prime} We return to Example 1 presented in Sections III-A and IV-D and use Algorithm 1 to derive the computation (rows in each element of 𝓜tsubscript𝓜𝑡\\boldsymbol{{\\cal M}}_{t}) assignments for t=2𝑡2t=2, where machine 4 is preempted. The steps of the algorithm are shown in Fig. 4. In this case, we showed that 𝝁∗=   5 5superscript𝝁2525354545\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^{*}=\\left[\\frac{2}{5},\\frac{2}{5},\\frac{3}{5},\\frac{4}{5},\\frac{4}{5}\\right] in Section IV-D. In the first iteration, f=1𝑓1f=1, we have L′=Lsuperscript𝐿′𝐿L^{\\prime}=L and 𝒎=𝝁∗𝒎superscript𝝁\\boldsymbol{m}=\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^{*} as no computations have been assigned yet. Rows of the respective cs-matrices are assigned to machine 111, 555, and 666 because among all machines, machine 111 has the least remaining computations to be assigned, and machines 555 and 666 have with the most remaining computations to be assigned. Moreover, note that where machine 333 is the machine with the most remaining rows to be assigned that is not included in 𝒫1={1,5,6}subscript𝒫1156\\mathcal{P}_{1}=\\{1,5,6\\}. Therefore, a fraction α1=25subscript𝛼125\\alpha_{1}=\\frac{2}{5} of the rows are assigned to machines 1,5,6156{1,5,6}.\nThen, 𝒎𝒎\\boldsymbol{m} is adjusted to reflect the remaining computations to be assigned and L′=3−3​α1=95superscript𝐿′33subscript𝛼195L^{\\prime}=3-3\\alpha_{1}=\\frac{9}{5}. For iteration 222, the condition of (34) relating to line 10 of Algorithm 1 is motivated by the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a (𝒎,L′)𝒎superscript𝐿′(\\boldsymbol{m},L^{\\prime})-FP solution given in Lemma 1. Here, we are interested in the FP solution for 𝒎𝒎\\boldsymbol{m} which is updated after each iteration. In other words, for each iteration of a row set assignment in Algorithm 1, we ensure there exists a set of succeeding row assignments such that a final FP solution is obtained. In the second iteration, f=2𝑓2f=2, machine 222 is a machine with the least remaining rows to be assigned. Computations are assigned to machine 222 and machines 333 and 666 which are a pair of machines with the most remaining computations to be assigned. Ideally, we would like to assign all the remaining rows to machine 222. However, since assigning 2525\\frac{2}{5} of the rows to machine 222 in this iteration will violate the condition of (33) in Lemma 1 and as a consequence, there will be no valid filling solution going forward. Therefore, we set α2=15subscript𝛼215\\alpha_{2}=\\frac{1}{5} instead and after this iteration 𝒎𝒎\\boldsymbol{m} and L′superscript𝐿′L^{\\prime} are adjusted accordingly. In the third iteration, f=3𝑓3f=3, since we assign α3=15subscript𝛼315\\alpha_{3}=\\frac{1}{5} of the rows to machines 2,3,5235{2,3,5} and 𝒎𝒎\\boldsymbol{m} and L′superscript𝐿′L^{\\prime} are adjusted accordingly. Finally, in the fourth iteration, f=4𝑓4f=4, only three machines 3,5,6356{3,5,6} have non-zero computation assignment left and each is assigned α4=15subscript𝛼415\\alpha_{4}=\\frac{1}{5} of the rows.\nIn this example, the algorithm converges in F=4𝐹4F=4 (fewer than N2=5subscript𝑁25N_{2}=5) iterations. The resulting computing assignment is shown in Fig. 1(b).\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: f𝑓fαfsubscript𝛼𝑓\\alpha_{f}m​[ref]1𝑚delimited-[]1m[ref]1m​[ref]2𝑚delimited-[]2m[ref]2m​[ref]3𝑚delimited-[]3m[ref]3m​𝑚delimited-[]4mm​𝑚delimited-[]5mm​𝑚delimited-[]6mL′superscript𝐿′L^{\\prime} We return to Example 1 presented in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
