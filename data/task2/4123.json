      "content": "Paper Title: SI𝜒O: Smoothing Inference with Twisted Objectives\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe HH model is a physiologically grounded model of neural action potentials  defined through a set of four nonlinear differential equations. Each neuron is defined by four state variables: the instantaneous membrane potential v​(t)∈ℝ𝑣𝑡ℝv(t)\\in\\mathbb{R}, the potassium channel activation n​(t)∈ [ref]1𝑛𝑡01n(t)\\in [ref]1, sodium channel activation m​(t)∈ [ref]1𝑚𝑡01m(t)\\in [ref]1, and sodium channel inactivation h​(t)∈ [ref]1ℎ𝑡01h(t)\\in [ref]1. The channel states represent the aggregated probability that the given channel is active. The state evolves according to: The membrane capacitance Cmsubscript𝐶𝑚C_{m} is often defined to be 1.01.01.0. The first term, iext​(t)subscript𝑖ext𝑡i_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t) is the externally injected current. The second term represents the net current through cell membrane due to the potential difference between the intracellular and extracellular mediums, often referred to as the leakage current. This current is a function of the membrane capacitance, gLsubscript𝑔𝐿g_{L}, and the potential of the extracellular medium, ELsubscript𝐸𝐿E_{L}, where the potential difference across the membrane is then v​(t)−EL𝑣𝑡subscript𝐸𝐿v(t)-E_{L}. The third term represents the net current through the membrane as a result of the potassium channels as a function of the channel state n​(t)𝑛𝑡n(t), the channel capacitance gKsubscript𝑔𝐾g_{K}, and the potassium reversal potential EKsubscript𝐸𝐾E_{K}. The final term represents the current through the membrane as a result of the sodium channel states, both m​(t)𝑚𝑡m(t) and h​(t)ℎ𝑡h(t), the sodium channel conductance gN​asubscript𝑔𝑁𝑎g_{Na}, and the sodium reversal potential EN​asubscript𝐸𝑁𝑎E_{Na}. The channel states evolve according to: where αn,αm,αh,βn,βm,βhsubscript𝛼𝑛subscript𝛼𝑚subscript𝛼ℎsubscript𝛽𝑛subscript𝛽𝑚subscript𝛽ℎ\\alpha_{n},\\alpha_{m},\\alpha_{h},\\beta_{n},\\beta_{m},\\beta_{h} are all fixed scalar functions of the membrane potential. We discretize this continuous-time differential equation into a discrete-time latent variable model by integrating using Euler integration with an integration timestep of 0.020.020.02ms (similarly to Huys and Paninski ). This defines the deterministic time-evolution of the neural state. We follow a similar approach as Huys and Paninski  and add Gaussian random noise to each of the four states at each timestep. The membrane potential is unconstrained, and so we can add noise directly. The gate states, however, are constrained to the range   [ref]1. Huys and Paninski  use truncated Gaussian noise to avoid pushing the state outside the constrained range. We use a different approach and transform the constrained states into an unconstrained state by applying the inverse sigmoid function to the raw gate value. This has the effect of modifying the variance of the perturbation in constrained space as a function of the state (heteroscedastic noise in constrained space). However, this hetereoscedasticity carries with it a favorable intuition. The magnitude of the noise term is reduced (after being pushed through a sigmoid) close the limits. This means that the same noise kernel provides smaller perturbations close to the extremes, while still retaining a larger permissible perturbations in the mid-range. We add zero-mean Gaussian noise to the potential with variance scaled by the integration timestep, σv2=9​m​V​s−1×0.02​s=0.18​mVsuperscriptsubscript𝜎𝑣29mVsuperscripts10.02s0.18mV\\sigma_{v}^{2}=9\\mathrm{mVs^{-1}}\\times 0.02\\mathrm{s}=0.18\\mathrm{mV}. The unconstrained gate variables are perturbed by zero-mean Gaussian noise with variance also scaled by the integration timestep, σ{n,m,h}2=0.1​s−1×0.02​s=0.002superscriptsubscript𝜎𝑛𝑚ℎ20.1superscripts10.02s0.002\\sigma_{\\{n,m,h\\}}^{2}=0.1\\mathrm{s^{-1}}\\times 0.02\\mathrm{s}=0.002. Observations are sampled from a Gaussian emission distribution centered on the current membrane potential with variance 25mV. Observations are generated every 50 timesteps. The model is integrated with a timestep of 0.02ms, corresponding to an acquisition rate of 1kHz. We initialize the potential according to a Gaussian distribution with mean equal to -65mV and a standard deviation of 25mV. The unconstrained gate variables are initialized from a Gaussian distribution with mean defined by an estimate of the steady-state value x=sigmoid​(αx​(−65)/αx​(−65)−βx​(−65))𝑥sigmoidsubscript𝛼𝑥65subscript𝛼𝑥65subscript𝛽𝑥65x=\\mathrm{sigmoid}\\left(\\nicefrac{{\\alpha_{x}(-65)}}{{\\alpha_{x}(-65)-\\beta_{x}(-65)}}\\right), where x𝑥x represents the n𝑛n, m𝑚m or hℎh states. To iterate the model, we first constrain the state by passing the gate variables through a sigmoid. The potential is already unconstrained and so requires no transform. We then iterate the model given the constrained state. The iterated state is then unconstrained by passing the gate states through the logit function (inverse of the sigmoid function). The noise term is then added to the iterated, unconstrained state. Observations are then generated by sampling from the emission distribution every 50 steps. We generate traces with 2,048 timesteps, corresponding to approximately 40ms.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: of four nonlinear differential equations.
