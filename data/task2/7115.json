      "content": "Paper Title: Darwin3: A large-scale neuromorphic chip with a Novel ISA and On-Chip Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSpiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their ability to process spatial-temporal information in an efficient event-driven manner. To exploit the capabilities of SNNs, several spiking neural network simulation platforms have been introduced, such as Brian2, NEST[ref]2, and SPAIC.\nNevertheless, the dependence of these platforms on using extensive GPU and CPU resources to mimic the spiking dynamics with a high count of timing steps potentially diminish the intrinsic advantages of SNNs. Neuromorphic chips are designed for efficient execution of spiking neural networks, which have demonstrated promising performance in brain simulation and specific ultra-low power scenarios. However, several limitations prevent them from fully leveraging the advantages of spiking neural networks. To better leverage the benefits of the SNN models, we should emphasize the three aspects when designing neuromorphic chips: Flexibility of Neural Models: One of the key functions of neuromorphic chips is to simulate diverse biological neurons and synapses. However, many neuromorphic chips only support a single type of neuron model, as evidenced in platforms like Neurogrid, which is based on analog neuron circuits. Some works introduce a degree of configurability to accommodate various neuron models. Loihi achieved enhanced learning capabilities through configurable sets of traces and delays. FlexLearn has conceived a versatile data path that amalgamates key features from diverse models. Moreover, endeavors have been undertaken to develop fully configurable neuronal models using instructions. SpiNNaker’s multi-core processors[ref]7, based on conventional ARM cores, provide significant flexibility. However, it is associated with reduced performance and energy efficiency compared to other accelerators. While Loihi2 presents an instruction set incorporating logical and mathematical operations similar to RISC instructions. However, instruction sets designed for conventional neural networks lack efficiency for SNNs despite their flexibility. Synapse Density: To further unlock the potential of SNNs, neuromorphic chips need to support the representation of large-scale SNNs with more complex topologies. However, current neuromorphic chips pay less attention to this aspect, primarily concentrating on simulating the behavior of neurons and synapses. For instance, TrueNorth0 employs a crossbar design for synaptic connections, but it suffers from limited and fixed fan-in/fan-out capacity. Loihi  takes an approach by using axon indexes to encode topology, thereby enhancing flexibility. Loihi2  proposes optimizing for convolutional and factorized connections but gives less attention to other connection types. Unicorn 1 introduces a technique for merging synapses from multiple cores to extend the synaptic scale of a single core. Thus, improving synapse density for various topologies under limited storage conditions is crucial for optimizing the cost-effectiveness of the chip. On-chip Learning Ability: Learning capability is a critical feature of biological neural networks. Currently, only a few neuromorphic chips support on-chip learning. Among those, the supported learning rules are pretty restricted. For instance, BrainscaleS22 only accommodates fixed learning algorithms. Loihi supports programmable rules for pre-, post-, and reward traces. Loihi2 extends its capabilities of the programmable rules applied to pre-, post-, and generalized ”third-factor” traces. However, even with the enhanced flexibility exhibited by Loihi2, it cannot accommodate novel learning rules that might emerge. The latest research achievements in the field of electrochemical memory array3 also provide new reference solutions. In this paper, we design a large-scale neuromorphic chip with a domain-specific Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), named Darwin3, to support model flexibility, system scalability, and on-chip learning capability of the chip. Darwin3 is the third generation of our Darwin 4 family of neuromorphic chips, which was successfully taped out and lit up in December 2022. Our main contributions are as follows. 1) We propose a domain-specific instruction set architecture (ISA) for neuromorphic systems, capable of efficiently describing diverse models and learning rules, including the integrate-and-fire (LIF) family5, Izhikevich6, and STDP7, among others. The proposed architecture excels in achieving high parallelism during computational operations, including loading parameters and updating state variables such as membrane potential and weights. 2) We design a novel mechanism to represent the topology of SNNs. This mechanism effectively compresses the information required to describe synaptic connections, thereby reducing overall memory usage. The article is organized as follows: Firstly, we introduce the topic and briefly overview the article’s contents. Second, we present the neuromorphic computing domain-specific ISA. Then, we offer the overall architecture of the neuromorphic chip and the implementation of each part, including the architecture of neuron nodes and the mechanism of topology representation. Lastly, we demonstrate the experiment results.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: spatial-temporal information in an efficient event-driven manner.
