Other studies focus on more flexible hardware or scheduling designs.\nEnGN 5 introduces a unified SIMD architecture that adopts a ring-based dataflow for SpMM to improve hardware utilization.\nAuten et al.  connect all components with a crossbar switch in a hardware block.\nHowever, these works do not capture the generic GNN characteristics and suffer from long-distance data movement problems, leading to low performance and energy efficiency.\nIn contrast, we make no assumptions about the targeted GNN models and propose three methods to enhance GNN accelerator performance.\nOur approach involves co-designing the software and hardware of the compiler, architecture, and graph partitioner as a whole.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: extends this concept with a multi-stage pipeline and bidirectional dataflow.\nGraphACT  and ReGraphX  also incorporate CPU and 3D ReRAM techniques in their multi-stage acceleration.\nAWB-GCN [ref]8 proposes a unified SpMM architecture for GCN’s two operators, improving hardware utilization.\nGCNAX 1 presents a reconfigurable loop ordering and fusion design for GCN, while I-GCN  explores\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
