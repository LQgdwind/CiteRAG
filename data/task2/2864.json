      "content": "Paper Title: A Rate-Distortion Framework for Explaining Black-box Model Decisions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPowerful machine learning models such as deep neural networks are inherently opaque, which has motivated numerous explanation methods that the research community developed over the last decade [ref]1  6   [ref]16  . The meaning and validity of an explanation depends on the underlying principle of the explanation framework. Therefore, a trustworthy explanation framework must align intuition with mathematical rigor while maintaining maximal flexibility and applicability. We believe the Rate-Distortion Explanation (RDE) framework, first proposed by [ref]16, then extended by , as well as the similar framework in , meets the desired qualities. In this chapter, we aim to present the RDE framework in a revised and holistic manner. Our generalized RDE framework can be applied to any model (not just classification tasks), supports in-distribution interpretability (by leveraging in-painting GANs), and admits interpretation queries (by considering suitable input signal representations). The typical setting of a (local) explanation method is given by a pre-trained model Φ:ℝn→ℝm,:Φ→superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑚\\Phi:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{m},\nand a data instance x∈ℝn𝑥superscriptℝ𝑛x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}. The model ΦΦ\\Phi can be either a classification task with m𝑚m class labels or a regression task with m𝑚m-dimensional model output. The model decision Φ​(x)Φ𝑥\\Phi(x) is to be explained. In the original RDE framework [ref]16, an explanation for Φ​(x)Φ𝑥\\Phi(x) is a set of feature components S⊂{1,…,n}𝑆1…𝑛S\\subset\\left\\{1,\\ldots,n\\right\\} in x𝑥x that are deemed relevant for the decision Φ​(x)Φ𝑥\\Phi(x). The core principle behind the RDE framework is that a set S⊂{1,…,n}𝑆1…𝑛S\\subset\\left\\{1,\\ldots,n\\right\\} contains all the relevant components if Φ​(x)Φ𝑥\\Phi(x) remains (approximately) unchanged after modifying xScsubscript𝑥superscript𝑆𝑐x_{S^{c}}, i.e., the components in x𝑥x that are not deemed relevant. In other words, S𝑆S contains all relevant features if they are sufficient for producing the output Φ​(x)Φ𝑥\\Phi(x). To convey concise explanatory information, one aims to find the minimal set S⊂{1,…,n}𝑆1…𝑛S\\subset\\left\\{1,\\ldots,n\\right\\} with all the relevant components.\nAs demonstrated in [ref]16 and 8, the minimal relevant set S⊂{1,…,n}𝑆1…𝑛S\\subset\\left\\{1,\\ldots,n\\right\\} cannot be found combinatorically in an efficient manner for large input sizes. A meaningful approximation can nevertheless be found by optimizing a sparse continuous mask s∈ [ref]1n𝑠superscript01𝑛s\\in [ref]1^{n} that has no significant effect on the output Φ​(x)Φ𝑥\\Phi(x) in the sense that\nΦ​(x)≈Φ​(x⊙s+(1−s)⊙v)Φ𝑥Φdirect-product𝑥𝑠direct-product1𝑠𝑣\\Phi(x)\\approx\\Phi(x\\odot s+(1-s)\\odot v)\nshould hold for appropriate perturbations v∈ℝn𝑣superscriptℝ𝑛v\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}, where ⊙direct-product\\odot denotes the componentwise multiplication. Suppose d​(Φ​(x),Φ​(y))𝑑Φ𝑥Φ𝑦d\\big{(}\\Phi(x),\\Phi(y)\\big{)} is a measure of distortion (e.g. the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-norm) between the model outputs for x,y∈ℝn𝑥𝑦superscriptℝ𝑛x,y\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n} and 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V} is a distribution over appropriate perturbations v∼𝒱similar-to𝑣𝒱v\\sim\\mathcal{V}. An explanation in the RDE framework can be found as a solution mask s∗superscript𝑠s^{*} to the following minimization problem: where λ>0𝜆0\\lambda>0 is a hyperparameter controlling the sparsity of the mask. We further generalize the RDE framework to abstract input signal representations x=f​(h)𝑥𝑓ℎx=f(h), where f𝑓f is a data representation function with input hℎh. The philosophy of the generalized RDE framework is that an explanation for generic input signals x=f​(h)𝑥𝑓ℎx=f(h) should be some simplified version of the signal, which is interpretable to humans. This is achieved by demanding sparsity in a suitable representation system hℎh, which ideally optimally represents the class of explanations that are desirable for the underlying domain and interpretation query. This philosophy underpins our experiments on image classification in the wavelet domain, on audio signal classification in the Fourier domain, and on radio map estimation in an urban environment domain. Therein we demonstrate the versatility of our generalized RDE framework.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Powerful machine learning models such as deep neural networks are inherently opaque, which has motivated numerous explanation methods that the research community developed over the last decade [ref]1  6   [ref]16  .
