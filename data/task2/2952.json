      "content": "Paper Title: Differentiable NAS Framework and Application to Ads CTR Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe provide a brief introduction to NAS methods and their application to a few different areas. This is not meant to be a comprehensive summary. Rather, we select methods that we hope will help readers get the most from our work. In their work on NAS with reinforcement learning , Zoph et al. propose a controller-trainer reinforcement learning (RL) approach in which a controller samples architectures to be trained and is then updated based the results that these architectures achieve. The authors use a recurrent neural network (RNN) as the controller, which generates the different architectural parameters of the search candidates. As models are trained, the controller is updated via the REINFORCE  algorithm. One major drawback of this approach is that architectures have to be sampled in a sequential fashion, and that a large number of such candidates must be trained before we can sample high-performing architectures. This is the challenge that gradient-based NAS approaches attempt to remedy. In contrast to an RL-based methodology, Wu et al. [ref]17 [ref]24 attempt to complete the entire search process with the training of one supernetwork (covered in much more detail in section III). Each layer of the supernetwork contains multiple candidate operators with the final output being a weighted average of the individual operators. The weights are defined as a Gumbel Softmax distribution over a vector of architecture parameters. The supernet then trains both the operator weights and the architecture parameters. Once this is complete, high-performing architectures can be generated by simply sampling operators from the Gumbel Softmax distribution. As we train the supernet, we anneal the “temperature” of the Gumbel Softmax operation such that it becomes closer to hard sampling over time. In this way, the search is completed in one training pass, after which architectures can be generated. ProxylessNAS follows a similar direction of using a supernetwork to essentially conduct the search process [ref]19. Both of these approaches allow for directly incorporating latency information in the loss function of the search process by differentiating the expected latency of the network to be sampled from the supernet. NAS techniques can be applied to many different areas. AdaBERT  focuses on designing architectures specific to individual NLP tasks based on a general pre-trained BERT model. BERT  models are pre-trained on large datasets in a semi-supervised manner and fine-tuned on smaller datasets in a supervised manner; AdaBERT leverages this to design more efficient models during the fine-tuning process. In recommendation systems, AutoCTR  aims to search over the key “building blocks” of a set of DLRM-type recommendation models. This work does not use a supernetwork-based NAS approach, but rather samples architectures. It is able to maintain efficiency by conducting the search process over subsampled versions of the datasets. This approach of using a proxy task is common in NAS [ref]19.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: must be trained before we can sample high-performing architectures.
