      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Vision-and-Language Pre-training with Text-Relevant Image Patch Selection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) [ref]45    [ref]27  0 [ref]24 7 has experienced remarkable growth, emerging as a dominant paradigm for addressing Vision-Language (VL) tasks. Conventional VLP models [ref]45   [ref]27 employ pre-trained object detectors    to extract region-based image features but suffer from extensive annotation and expensive computation of object detector training.\nInspired by the success of the Vision Transformer (ViT)  and its variants  3 1 in the computer vision domain, more recent VLP models  [ref]24   0  have adopted ViT as the visual encoder or cross-modal fusion encoder without using region features from the pre-trained object detector. However, ViT-based VLP methods necessitate the modeling of lengthy visual sequences, e.g., from high-resolution images, to achieve robust vision understanding, which results in quadratic computational complexity proportional to the visual sequence length. Furthermore, recent studies   have started to investigate vision-language foundation models, focusing on scaling up both model and data size. Consequently, there is an increasing need to reduce the substantial computational costs associated with ViT-based VLP models. As demonstrated in Figure 1 (a), we observe that eliminating the inattentive patch tokens of the image [CLS] token generally does not impact the Visual Question Answering (VQA)  predictions. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that not all image tokens in the visual encoder positively contribute to the final prediction results of VLP models, and a considerable number of redundant image tokens exist. Recent studies   5 1  have explored ViT model acceleration by eliminating unrelated image tokens. However, these methods are specifically tailored for computer vision tasks (e.g., image recognition) and remove redundant tokens based on visual semantics while disregarding the aligned knowledge in the text modality. Consequently, they are not suitable for VL tasks. As illustrated in Figure 1 (b), removing patch tokens based solely on the image [CLS] token, without the guidance of text knowledge, leads to incorrect answers. This observation inspires us to reduce the number of image tokens by merging less informative patch tokens under the guidance of the aligned text context. In this work, we introduce an efficient VLP model featuring Text-Relevant Image Patch Selection (TRIPS) to progressively reduce redundant image tokens with the guidance of text. TRIPS selects text-consistent image tokens through a text-aware patch-selection layer, thereby minimizing the computational cost of visual encoding and cross-modal fusion. This patch-selection layer preserves attentive image tokens with text guidance and fuses inattentive tokens into a single one by dynamically computing text-dependent visual attention in an end-to-end manner. Consequently, we gradually decrease the number of image tokens as the visual backbone deepens, alleviating the computational burden of the visual encoder and enhancing the efficiency of cross-modal fusion due to the reduced visual sequences. Additionally, model efficiency can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the keep rate of image tokens in the patch-selection layer without introducing any additional parameters. We evaluate TRIPS on five representative VL tasks consisting of visual question answering (VQA), natural language visual reasoning (NLVR), cross-modal retrieval, image captioning, and visual grounding. By incorporating TRIPS into existing representative VLP models, we achieve approximately 40% efficiency gains while maintaining competitive or superior downstream task performance. For example, equipped with TRIPS, ALBEF [ref]24, a recent robust two-stream VLP model, can accelerate by 40.98% and even improve by 0.1 on the VQA test-dev and 0.2 on the NLVR Dev (see Table 3). Moreover, by increasing the input image resolution while maintaining the same computational cost, TRIPS can enhance performance by 0.4 on the VQA test-dev and 0.6 on the NLVR Dev. Our main contributions can be summarized as three-fold: We introduce an efficient vision-and-language pre-training model featuring Text-Relevant Image Patch Selection (TRIPS). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to reduce the computational cost of VLP models by diminishing image tokens with the assistance of linguistic context. We propose a novel text-relevant patch-selection layer, which can dynamically compute text-dependent visual attention to identify attentive (or critical) image tokens and merge inattentive ones with text guidance in an end-to-end manner. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our TRIPS can enhance the training and inference efficiency of VLP models while incurring lower computational costs. Moreover, by increasing the input image resolution, TRIPS leverages additional image tokens to achieve superior performance without increasing computational expenses.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: In recent years, Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) [ref]45    [ref]27  0 [ref]24 7 has experienced remarkable growth, emerging as a dominant paradigm for addressing Vision-Language (VL) tasks.
