      "content": "Paper Title: The Universal Law of Generalization Holds for Naturalistic Stimuli\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHumans constantly form generalizations, whether when trying to identify the color of an object or reasoning about which action to take based on past experiences. Understanding how generalizations relate to underlying psychological representations is a core problem in cognitive science. The universal law of generalization is a fundamental hypothesis concerning the nature of this relationship which states that the strength of generalization between two stimuli should decay as a universal exponential function of their psychological distance. While extensively studied, evidence for the universal law comes from small datasets and artificial stimuli that are very different from the real world. Our work is the first to provide direct evidence for the universal law in a high-dimensional naturalistic domain by collecting and analyzing 605,019605019605,019 human similarity and generalization judgments for natural images. Every day, humans interact with complex perceptual objects that vary in modality, structure and function. Whether deciding when to cross a street, recognizing the face of a friend, or trying to determine whether a novel fruit will taste good, we need to form meaningful generalizations from past perceptual experiences. This problem of generalization is arguably one that we share with all intelligent species, something that led Roger Shepard to propose a candidate for the first universal law of psychology . Shepard‚Äôs universal law of generalization ‚Äì intended to hold for intelligent entities anywhere in the universe ‚Äì asserts that the extent to which a property is generalized from one stimulus to another should decrease as a concave function (usually exponential) of the distance between those stimuli in psychological space. This idea has been elaborated upon in Bayesian models of cognition , and linked to information-theoretic principles such as maximum entropy , Kolmogorov complexity , and efficient coding . Implicit in Shepard‚Äôs proposal is the idea that it is possible to represent perceptual stimuli in a psychological space ‚Äì typically a low-dimensional representation where the similarity between two stimuli decreases with their distance. While this idea is controversial (e.g., ; ; 9), Shepard showed that such spaces can capture the similarity relationships between a variety of simple perceptual stimuli. He proposed a procedure, known as multidimensional scaling (MDS), for uncovering the structure of mental representations from behavioral data (; ; ). Given a set of stimuli, the procedure begins by constructing a similarity matrix between all stimulus pairs, e.g., by collecting similarity judgments or confusion probabilities, and then applying an iterative algorithm that embeds those stimuli in a psychological space (typically Euclidean) such that similar stimuli are mapped to nearby points. Having mapped stimuli to points in a psychological space, it becomes possible to test the universal law. While Shepard‚Äôs (non-metric) multidimensional scaling method assumes similarity decreases with distance, it doesn‚Äôt specify the form of that function. By analyzing the abstract question of how an ideal organism should decide whether two stimuli shared a given property,  showed that this function should be concave. Mathematical analysis of a variety of different assumptions about the distribution of properties in psychological space showed that generalization typically decreased as an exponential function of distance. Shepard then demonstrated that this theoretical relationship held for a wide array of stimuli that had been embedded into a psychological space via MDS, including geometric shapes, phonemes, colors (in both humans and pigeons), and even Morse code signals. Despite the success of Shepard‚Äôs account, two clear limitations remain. First, for a set of NùëÅN stimuli MDS requires on the order of N2superscriptùëÅ2N^{2} pairwise comparisons to construct a full similarity matrix which, as the number of stimuli increases, necessitates a large amount of human data. For example, a set of 100 stimuli would require on the order of 10,000 similarity judgments, without even including any repetitions to ensure data quality. This bottleneck has recently propelled a line of research aimed at finding cheaper approximations for human similarity matrices (; ; ). Second, and in part as a result of the first limitation, most of the evidence for the universal law comes from studies that are limited to low-dimensional artificial stimuli and small stimulus sets (; ; [ref]7; ). Even though more recent work such that of  has considered somewhat richer stimuli such as synthesized instrument timbres and vibrotactile patterns, these were still limited to small datasets on the scale of 10-20 stimuli. These limitations make it hard to draw conclusions about the status of the universal law of generalization in the high-dimensional regime of real-world stimuli, especially as fundamental problems in psychology continue to be reshaped by large-scale behavioral studies (see e.g., ; ; 1; 4). To address this gap, we leveraged recent advances in online recruitment as well as the availability of naturalistic image datasets to directly test the universal law of generalization in a high-dimensional setting. Specifically, we considered a dataset of similarity judgments over three sets of images recently collected by 0 where each dataset comprised 120 images from a given natural category, namely, animals, fruits, and vegetables. This dataset consisted of 214,200 human judgments. To account for the different ways in which similarity scores can be constructed, we augmented this dataset with a newly collected set of generalization judgments where participants rated how likely it is a certain blank property (7; 2) (e.g., having an enzyme) generalizes from one stimulus to another. The latter dataset comprises 390,819390819390,819 generalization judgments from 2,40624062,406 online participants. We used these data to directly test the universal law of generalization in this high-dimensional large-scale regime.
