      "content": "Paper Title: A Visual Analytics Framework for Reviewing Streaming Performance Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile visual analytics for streaming data has not been matured yet in performance visualization, researchers have developed visualizations in other domains, such as fraud detection  and factory management .\nDasgupta et al.  provided a comprehensive survey of streaming data visualization and its challenges.\nOne of the major challenges with streaming data is how we show important changes or meaningful patterns with a low cognitive load since available data is constantly updated  . A common approach taken is the simplification of visual results (e.g., aggregation).\nFor example, Xu et al.  developed extended Marey’s graph for monitoring assembly line performance.\nWhile Marey’s graph is originally used for train schedules, it suffers from visual cluttering when the data gets updated frequently.\nTo solve this issue, the extended Marey’s graph in  emphasizes only the abnormal behaviors of the assembly line (e.g., causing delays of assembly processes) by aggregating the other behaviors.\nSome researchers used dimensionality reduction (DR) methods to summarize changes in streaming multivariate data.\nFor instance, Cheng et al.  used the multidimensional-scaling (MDS) for showing an overview of similarities between temporal behaviors in streamed data.\nIn addition to this, they introduced the concept of sliding MDS, which visualizes temporal changes in the similarities between selected points as line paths.\nTo detect the rating fraud in e-commerce stores, Webga and Lu  used singular-value decomposition to show the dissimilarities of the rating streams.\nHowever, when streaming data has high volume and velocity (i.e., frequent updates), the algorithms used in the works above could not work well due to the computational cost.\nTo handle high volume and velocity streaming data, the completion time of algorithms used for visual analytics should be constant and/or less than the data-collection rate even when a total number of data points or features are increasing . Recently, progressive visual analytics [ref]41 is being actively studied.\nProducing useful results with a latency restriction is a common requirement.\nIn fact, a few studies started to apply progressive visual analytics methods to handle streaming data.\nFor example, Pezzotti et al.  developed Approximated t-SNE (A-tSNE) as a progressive version of t-SNE  which is a commonly-used non-linear DR method.\nThey showed the usage of A-tSNE for streaming data visualization in their case study.\nThe work in  enhanced the existing incremental principal component analysis (PCA)  for streaming data visualization.\nIn addition to the incremental calculation, their method maximizes the overlap of data points between previous and updated PCA results to keep the user’s mental map.\nWe also use progressive methods to support the analysis of streaming of large performance data.\nHowever, while these two works above   focused only on handling new data points fed from streams, our methods can also be used when new features (values for new time points in our case) are obtained continuously.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: used for visual analytics should be constant and/or less than the data-collection rate even when a total number of data points or features are increasing .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
