      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning (DL) has transformed the field of machine learning (ML) with deep neural networks (DNNs) being deployed in various real-world applications, including medical diagnosis, financial services, biometrics, intelligent transportation, social media, and smart home devices. Despite tremendous progress, their acceptance in mission-critical application areas is being hampered by two significant limitations. First, there is an inherent inability to explain decisions in a manner understandable to humans [ref]1. Second, there is vulnerability to adversarial attacks, i.e., malicious and imperceptible alterations to the input, that can fool trained networks to alter their decisions drastically [ref]2. These seemingly two disparate concepts are intrinsically linked to each other and may have their origins in the data-driven nature of DNNs with a highly nonlinear input-output relationship and over-parameterized design. Explainability tackles the critical problem that human users cannot directly understand the complex behavior of DNNs or explain their underlying decision-making process. The explainability of ML models is the fundamental requirement for building trust with users and holds the key to their safe, fair, and successful deployment in real-world applications. The issue of explainability transcends the realm of scientific interest. The adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by the European Union in May 2018 gives any citizen the “right to explanation” of an algorithmic decision made about them . Explainability is both a legal right and a responsibility that has extensive social implications. The GDPR states that individuals “have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing”. Explainability in ML is not a new topic and has been handled in many different ways, including building interpretable models or generating post hoc explanations [ref]1. This tutorial will focus on the latter. Given a trained neural network, either the input features are perturbed, and their effect on the network output is monitored, or a signal from the network output is back-propagated to the input. Either way, the resulting information from the perturbations or the gradient propagation provides an estimate of the contribution of input features to the output and can be presented as heatmaps. “How good is an explanation?” is a fundamental question in explainability research. Generally, a visual analysis of the explanation is performed given the fact that these explanations are generated for humans to see and understand the behavior of the model. Recently, it has been shown that a visual analysis may not be a reliable method to ascertain the “plausibility” of an explanation . However, the lack of ground-truth explanation makes it challenging to quantitatively assess, compare, and contrast various explanations. A crucial property that all explainability methods should satisfy is insensitivity to minor input perturbations. That is, a small perturbation (possibly malicious) in the input, which does not affect network decision, should not significantly change the attributions [ref]5 . This notion of robustness is closely linked to reproducibility and replicability of explanations. Concurrently, the explanation of a decision should change significantly when the network is under an adversarial attack, that is, imperceptible malicious changes in the input that force the network to alter its decision [ref]2. In an ideal world, the attribution maps should be sensitive enough to detect adversarial attack and concurrently invariant to small perturbations in the input. This tutorial paper provides a thorough overview of gradient-based post hoc explainability methods, their attributional robustness, and the link between explainability maps and adversarial robustness. We restrict our focus on computer vision classification models, i.e., the networks are generally convolutional neural networks (CNNs) whose input data consist of images (e.g., from ImageNet datasets) and whose outputs are class scores or soft-max probabilities. We have created a website that provides links to all explainability methods discussed in the following sections, figures, and the code for generating these figures ***https://sites.google.com/view/robustexplainability/home. This tutorial is not meant to provide an exhaustive survey of all the explainability methods proposed for DL models.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: acceptance in mission-critical application areas is being hampered by two significant limitations.
