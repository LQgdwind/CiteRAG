      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Resource Partitioning on Modern GPUs: A Reinforcement Learning Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHPC clusters and supercomputers are becoming increasingly heterogeneous, and as a consequence, 172 out of 500 top-class supercomputers are now GPU-equipped systems (as of Nov 2022) .\nThis trend has started ever since Dennard scaling ceased over a decade ago  .\nAs single-thread performance improvements were sustained by Dennard scaling, the industry had to shift towards multi-/many-core processors and heterogeneous architectures focusing on thread-/data-level parallelisms.\nGPUs are specialized hardware to exploit data-level parallelism of applications by spending more transistors on compute resources and simplifying the control logic considerably compared with those of CPUs.\nBy taking advantage of this simplicity, GPUs can offer much higher computational throughput and memory bandwidth than CPUs in the same VLSI technology generation (typically several times higher). However, as the available resources in GPUs have increased exponentially over the past decades, it has become increasingly difficult for a single program to fully utilize them.\nThe first reason for this is that not all GPU programs have sufficient parallelism to convert the available compute resources inside a GPU into speedup, which is governed by the well-known Amdahl’s law .\nThe second reason is the throughput of memory intensive applications is limited by the available memory bandwidth, and thus increasing the compute resources does not contribute to the speedup for them, which is known as the memory-wall problem [ref]5.\nThe third reason is the compute resources inside a GPU are also becoming heterogeneous with different types of units (e.g., matrix engines, regular FP64 units, integer units, etc.), and depending on their usages, power can also be under utilized and wasted . As a consequence, the industry has started supporting several resource partitioning features that enable multiple programs to be co-scheduled on the same GPU at the same time with variable resource allocations.\nOne example is MPS (Multi-Process Service) that allows multiple programs to share computational resources logically, which is supported in recent NVIDIA GPUs .\nThe MPS feature is a software-based mechanism with several architectural supports that decides the process to SM (Streaming Processor) assignments with arbitrary rates (e.g., 70%).\nAnother example is MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) that physically partitions computational and bandwidth resources in a hierarchical manner at the granularity of GPC (Graphics Processing Cluster), which is supported in recent high-end NVIDIA GPUs from the Ampere generation . It first partitions a GPU into one or more GIs (GPU Instances), each of which is completely isolated, and then partitions each GI into one or more CIs (Compute Instances) that share the memory resources within the GI but utilize the compute resources mutually exclusively at the granularity of GPC.\nThese different partitioning features can be applied at the same time in a hierarchical manner, i.e., the MPS is applicable inside a CI created by the MIG. This paper explicitly targets hierarchical resource partitioning on modern GPUs, e.g., the hierarchical combination of MIG (coarse-grained physical partitioning) and MPS (fine-grained logical resource allocations), and orchestrates the multi-level partitioning setup and co-scheduling decision making for a given set of jobs.\nTo this end, we first analyze the impact of partitioning setup on performance using different workloads and demonstrate the potential benefit of the hierarchical partitioning.\nDriven by the observations, we propose our resource management method based on reinforcement learning using job profiles.\nMore specifically, we regard the optimization as a classification problem and choose an optimal set of partitioning and co-scheduling groups for a given set of jobs.\nWe train the classifier composed of a deep Q network using reinforcement learning at offline and apply the optimized agent to the online optimization.\n Specifically, this paper makes the following major contributions: As far as we know, this work is the first to apply reinforcement learning to simultaneously optimizing job co-scheduling and hierarchical resource partitioning on platforms with multiple different partitioning features (MPS and MIG) available on recent commercial GPUs. We quantitatively analyze the impact of the resource partitioning setup on GPUs throughput, while comparing different partitioning setups. We then define the co-scheduling and resource partitioning process as an optimization problem in a concrete mathematical form, which enables us to regard the optimization as a classification problem and introduce a reinforcement learning-based solution.\n We demonstrate that our approach can successfully set up the partitioning and co-scheduling group selections simultaneously through our thorough evaluations, and discuss how it is extensible to the entire cluster scale.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: intensive applications is limited by the available memory bandwidth, and thus increasing the compute resources does not contribute to the speedup for them, which is known as the memory-wall problem [ref]5.\nThe third reason is the compute resources inside a GPU are also becoming heterogeneous with different types of units (e.g., matrix engines, regular FP64 units, integer units, etc.), and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
