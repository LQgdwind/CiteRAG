      "content": "Paper Title: Application of Ghost-DeblurGAN to Fiducial Marker Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeblurGAN-v2 adopts the FPN  architecture to build the generator. If we utilize more complex architecture upgraded from FPN, such as Feature Pyramid Grids , the deblurring quality should be improved, as it can provide features with richer semantic and quality information . However, at the same time, the inference time of the network will also increase due to the more complex inner connections or more pathways, which is contrary to our intention of improving the real-time deblurring efficiency. Hence, the FPN architecture is also adopted in this work. For the FPN architecture, the design starts from the backbone. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the backbone feature extractor. Quite a few novel lightweight backbones, such as MobileNetV3 [ref]27 and GhostNet [ref]28 are proposed since MobileNetV2 , which is the backbone adopted in the lightweight implementation of DeblurGAN-v2 [ref]2. The current SOTA backbones, MobileNetV3 and GhostNet, employ the same architecture which is automatically searched by platform-aware NAS [ref]27 [ref]28. MobileNetV3 and GhostNet have neck and neck performance in ImageNet Classification and Object Detection, but it should be noted that MobileNetV3 and GhostNet do not show accuracy superiority over MobileNetV2 in Object Detection; however, their virtue is in the reduced FLOPs [ref]28. Yet, it is to be verified whether MobileNetV3 and GhostNet have better deblurring quality than MobileNetV2 in the architecture of DeblurGAN-v2. The comparison results are presented in Section IV. In DeblurGAN-v2, the last few layers, including average pooling and full connections, of the backbone are abandoned since these layers are originally developed for the image classification. However, we experimentally found that for the DeblurGAN-v2 architecture, the last eight layers of GhostNet can be abandoned and by doing so the accuracy is even boosted. Hence, as seen in Fig. 2, only the first eight feature blocks of GhostNet are preserved in the proposed model and the dimension of the output tensor of the last layer is 160 instead of 960, which is different from the original GhostNet. Moreover, the remaining top-down pathways and horizontal connections in the FPN are modified correspondingly afterward. For example, the upscale ratios of the proposed generator are 4,4,2,2,2 from top to bottom since the proposed lightweight model is shallow compared to the original model which adopts the upscale ratios 8,4,2,1,1. Refer to [ref]2 to check the detailed difference between the proposed generator and the original one.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: architecture, the design starts from the backbone.
