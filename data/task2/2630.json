      "content": "Paper Title: Straight-line Drawings of 1-Planar GraphsSupported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) Br835/20-1\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider simple undirected graphs with n𝑛n vertices and colored\nedges and assume that graphs are biconnected and are given with a\ndrawing (or a simple topological embedding) in the plane. For\nconvenience, we do not distinguish between a graph and its 1-planar\ndrawing, a vertex, its point in a drawing, and its position in a\ncanonical ordering, and an edge and its line in a drawing. We also\nrefer to a leftmost lower neighbor or a lower (left) subgraph if\nthis is clear from the drawing of a planar graph. Straight-line grid drawings of planar graphs can be constructed by\nusing the canonical ordering and the shift method, introduced by de\nFraysseix et al. . Alternatively, Schnyder\nrealizers can be used . A canonical ordering\nof a triconnected planar graph G𝐺G is a bucket order V1,…,Vmsubscript𝑉1…subscript𝑉𝑚V_{1},\\ldots,V_{m} of its vertices, so that further properties are satisfied\n. A bucket Visubscript𝑉𝑖V_{i} consists of a single vertex or a\nset of vertices forming a path that is a part of the boundary of a\nface of a planar drawing of G𝐺G. The first bucket consists of two\nvertices v1subscript𝑣1v_{1} and v2subscript𝑣2v_{2} in the outer face, called the base.\nThe last bucket consists of another vertex in the outer face. Let\nGksubscript𝐺𝑘G_{k} denote the subgraph induced by the vertices from the first\nk𝑘k buckets. Its outer face, called contour, contains v1,v2subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2v_{1},v_{2} and the vertices of Visubscript𝑉𝑖V_{i}. Every Gksubscript𝐺𝑘G_{k} is biconnected and\ninternally triconnected, so that separation pairs are on the\ncontour. A canonical ordering of a triconnected planar graph can be computed\nin linear time . In general, a planar graph has\nmany canonical orderings, for example a leftmost and a rightmost one\n. In particular, if the base is fixed, then any\nother vertex in the outer face can be chosen as the last vertex. If\nthe last vertex t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} is in a separating triangle (t1,t2,t3)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2subscript𝑡3(t_{1},t_{2},t_{3}),\nthen there are canonical orderings t2<t3<w<t1subscript𝑡2subscript𝑡3𝑤subscript𝑡1t_{2}<t_{3}<w<t_{1} and t3<t2<w<t1subscript𝑡3subscript𝑡2𝑤subscript𝑡1t_{3}<t_{2}<w<t_{1}, where vertex w𝑤w is in the interior of (t1,t2,t3)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2subscript𝑡3(t_{1},t_{2},t_{3}), since there is a canonical ordering of a subgraph with t1subscript𝑡1t_{1}\nand the vertices in the interior of (t1,t2,t3)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2subscript𝑡3(t_{1},t_{2},t_{3}) removed and\nwith t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} or t3subscript𝑡3t_{3} as last vertex. The vertices in the interior of\n(t1,t2,t3)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2subscript𝑡3(t_{1},t_{2},t_{3}) follow t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} and t3subscript𝑡3t_{3} by biconnectivity. \n The drawing of a graph in the plane is 1-planar if each edge is crossed\nat most once. Then edges cross in pairs. The crossing point\npartitions a crossed edge into two uncrossed segments,\nwhereas an uncrossed edge consists of a single segment. A graph G𝐺G\nis 1-planar if it admits a 1-planar drawing. A 1-planar\ndrawing is planar-maximal if no uncrossed edge can be added\nwithout violating 1-planarity. This property is assumed from now on.\nAlternatively, one may consider maximal 1-planar drawings,\nwhich do not admit the addition of any edge without violation. The\nplanar skeleton is obtained by removing all pairs of crossed edges. For an\nalgorithmic treatment, we use the planarization, which is\nobtained from a 1-planar drawing by treating each crossing point as\na special vertex of degree four . Clearly, a\n1-planar drawing can be augmented to a planar-maximal one in\nlinear time. A separation pair ⟨u,v⟩𝑢𝑣\\langle u,v\\rangle partitions a graph into\ncomponents, so that G−{u,v}=H0−,…,Hr−𝐺𝑢𝑣superscriptsubscript𝐻0…superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑟G-\\{u,v\\}=H_{0}^{-},\\ldots,H_{r}^{-} for some\nr≥1𝑟1r\\geq 1. Let Hisubscript𝐻𝑖H_{i} denote the subgraph induced by the vertices of\nHi−superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑖H_{i}^{-} and the vertices from the separation pair, so that the\ncommon edge (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) is in the outer face. The (edges between\nu𝑢u and vertices of the) components H0,…,Hksubscript𝐻0…subscript𝐻𝑘H_{0},\\ldots,H_{k}\nare ordered clockwise at u𝑢u and counter clockwise at v𝑣v.\nTwo consecutive components are separated by one or two pairs of\ncrossed edges if G𝐺G is planar-maximal 1-planar. The outer\ncomponent H0subscript𝐻0H_{0} contains vertices in the outer face if all crossed\nedges are removed. All other components are called inner\ncomponents. Every inner component Hisubscript𝐻𝑖H_{i} has a first inner\nface, which is the face next to edge (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) in the subgraph\ninduced by H0,…,Hisubscript𝐻0…subscript𝐻𝑖H_{0},\\ldots,H_{i}, that is the later inner components\nHi+1,…​Hrsubscript𝐻𝑖1…subscript𝐻𝑟H_{i+1},\\ldots H_{r} are removed. There is a B- or a W-configuration if a pair of edges\ncrosses in the outer face of a component . Alam et\nal.  observed that B-configurations can be\navoided if the embedding is changed by a flip, see\nFigs. 1(b) and 1(c). A\nW-configuration consists of six vertices v1,v2,u1,u2,t1,t2subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2subscript𝑢1subscript𝑢2subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2v_{1},v_{2},u_{1},u_{2},t_{1},t_{2}, so that there are two pairs of crossed edges\n(v1,u2)subscript𝑣1subscript𝑢2(v_{1},u_{2}), (v2,u1)subscript𝑣2subscript𝑢1(v_{2},u_{1}) and (v1,t2)subscript𝑣1subscript𝑡2(v_{1},t_{2}),\n(v2,t1)subscript𝑣2subscript𝑡1(v_{2},t_{1}), see Fig. 1(a). Vertices v1subscript𝑣1v_{1} and\nv2subscript𝑣2v_{2} are the base with edge (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) uncrossed and\nvertices t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} and t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} are on top. By a flip, the pairs\n(t1,t2)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2(t_{1},t_{2}) and (u1,u2)subscript𝑢1subscript𝑢2(u_{1},u_{2}) can be exchanged, so that u1subscript𝑢1u_{1} and\nu2subscript𝑢2u_{2} are on top in another embedding.\n The drawing of an edge-colored 1-planar graph is called\nspecialized if there are vertices v1,v2,t1subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2subscript𝑡1v_{1},v_{2},t_{1} and t2subscript𝑡2t_{2},\nso that the outer face is an isosceles triangle (v1,v2,t2)subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2subscript𝑡2(v_{1},v_{2},t_{2})\nand edges incident to v2subscript𝑣2v_{2} are black. Moreover, the drawing is\n1-planar, except for\nedge (v1,t1)subscript𝑣1subscript𝑡1(v_{1},t_{1}), which is crossed by edges incident to\nt2subscript𝑡2t_{2} and edges crossing (v1,t1)subscript𝑣1subscript𝑡1(v_{1},t_{1}) are crossed at most\ntwice. Hence, a specialized drawing is tri-fan-crossing. It is\n1-planar if either edge (v1,t1)subscript𝑣1subscript𝑡1(v_{1},t_{1}) or vertex t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} is removed,\nsee Figs. 5(b) and 6(c). Alam et al.  have shown that every triconnected\n1-planar graph can be drawn straight line on a grid of quadratic\nsize, except, possibly, for one edge in the outer face.\nThey use the algorithm by Chroback and Kant \nfor a drawing of the planar skeleton, whereas we prefer the one\nby Kant , which\ncreates edges with slope −1,010-1,0 and +11+1 on the contour. A triconnected 1-planar graph G𝐺G admits a straight-line 1-planar\ndrawing if and only if G𝐺G has at most 4​n−94𝑛94n-9 edges. If existing,\nthere is a specialized drawing on a grid of size at most (4​n−8)×(2​n−4)4𝑛82𝑛4(4n-8)\\times(2n-4), so that the outer face is an isosceles right-angled\ntriangle. An edge is uncrossed in the straight-line drawing if and\nonly if it is uncrossed in (the 1-planar drawing of) G𝐺G. Its\nlength ℓℓ\\ell is bounded by 1≤ℓ≤4​n−81ℓ4𝑛81\\leq\\ell\\leq 4n-8. Form   and  we obtain\nthat a 1-planar drawing of a planar-maximal 1-planar graph G𝐺G has a\ntriangular face with three uncrossed edges if and only if G𝐺G has at most 4​n−94𝑛94n-9\nedges. Choose this triangle as the outer face. As shown by Kant\n, there is a convex drawing of the planar skeleton\non a grid of size at most (2​n−4)×(n−2)2𝑛4𝑛2(2n-4)\\times(n-2), so that the outer\nface is an isosceles right-angled triangle. The drawing can be\nturned into a strictly convex drawing on a grid of size at most\n(4​n−8)×(2​n−4)4𝑛82𝑛4(4n-8)\\times(2n-4) if two extra shifts are used for any two\nedges of a quadrangle that are in a line, as shown in\n [ref]45. See Fig. 4 for an\nillustration. Every pair of crossed edges is reinserted into the\nquadrangle from which it was removed. Uncrossed edges are colored\nblack. There is a black and a red edge if two edges cross, where\nthe coloring is chosen so that all edges incident to vertex v2subscript𝑣2v_{2}\nare black. Then the drawing is specialized. At its creation, an\nuncrossed edge has length at least one, since there is a grid\ndrawing. Later on, edges are stretched by horizontal shifts. The\nbase is the longest edge and is a horizontal line of length at most\n4​n−84𝑛84n-8.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: into a strictly convex drawing on a grid of size at most\n(4​n−8)×(2​n−4)4𝑛82𝑛4(4n-8)\\times(2n-4) if two extra shifts are used for any two\nedges of a quadrangle that are in a line, as shown in\n [ref]45.
