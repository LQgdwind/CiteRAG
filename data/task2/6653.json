We will later use the approximation β~~𝛽\\tilde{\\beta} within the regularization (LABEL:A.eq2.1.5), where the matrix B=diag​(β​(x1),β​(x2),…,β​(xn))𝐵diag𝛽subscript𝑥1𝛽subscript𝑥2…𝛽subscript𝑥𝑛B=\\mathrm{diag}(\\beta(x_{1}),\\beta(x_{2}),\\ldots,\\beta(x_{n})) will be substituted by a matrix B~=diag​(β~​(x1),β~​(x2),…,β~​(xn))~𝐵diag~𝛽subscript𝑥1~𝛽subscript𝑥2…~𝛽subscript𝑥𝑛\\tilde{B}=\\mathrm{diag}(\\tilde{\\beta}(x_{1}),\\tilde{\\beta}(x_{2}),\\ldots,\\tilde{\\beta}(x_{n})) of the corresponding approximate values β~​(xi)≈β​(xi),i=1,2,…,nformulae-sequence~𝛽subscript𝑥𝑖𝛽subscript𝑥𝑖𝑖12…𝑛\\tilde{\\beta}(x_{i})\\approx\\beta(x_{i}),i=1,2,...,n.\nNote, however, that the problem of estimating the Radon-Nikodḿ derivative appears not only in domain adaptation with covariate shift, but also in anomaly detection , two-sample testing , divergence estimation , covariate shift adaptation  , generative modeling[ref]22, conditional density estimation, and classification from\npositive and unlabeled data; cf.also the monograph.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: derivative appears not only in domain adaptation with covariate shift, but also in anomaly detection , two-sample testing , divergence estimation , covariate shift adaptation  , generative modeling[ref]22, conditional density estimation, and classification from\npositive and unlabeled data; cf.also the monograph.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
