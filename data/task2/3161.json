      "content": "Paper Title: RSBNet: One-Shot Neural Architecture Search for A Backbone Network in Remote Sensing Image Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn our experiments, seven public RSI datasets are used for evaluation the performance of proposed methods in three RSI recognition tasks, including AID dataset , NWPU-RESISC45 dataset , PatternNet dataset , RSI-CB dataset , UC-Merced dataset [ref]50, ISPRS 2-D  and NWPU VHR-10 dataset . Collected from various satellite sensors over diverse locations of the ground surface and under different conditions, these datasets contain rich scene categories, geographic structures and image variations. The first four datasets are built for RSI scene classification task; the NWPU VHR-10 dataset is a geospatial dataset used for multiclass object detection; the ISPRS 2-D dataset is constructed for the task of land-cover classification. A brief introduction to each dataset is described as below. AID dataset: It consists of 10000 600×600600600600\\times 600 aerial images of 30 scene categories, and the number of sample images in each class varies from 220 to 420. NWPU-RESISC45 dataset: This dataset contains totally 31500 sample images which are divided into 45 scene categories. Each scene category consists of 700 images with a fixed size of 256×256256256256\\times 256 pixels. PatternNet dataset: It contains 38 scene categories, and each category consists of 800 images of size 256×256256256256\\times 256 pixels. RSI-CB dataset: This dataset contains 35 scene categories of approximately 24,000 images. Each class contains an average of approximately 690 images with a size of 256×256256256256\\times 256 pixels. UC-Merced dataset: This small-scale dataset is a widely used scene classification benchmark dataset, which consists of 21 scene classes with 100 sample images in each class. These scene images are all with a size of 256×256256256256\\times 256. ISPRS 2-D dataset: This dataset is a sub-decimeter resolution dataset over the two cities of Vaihingen and Potsdam. The Vaihingen dataset contains 33 patches of different sizes (average 2494×2064249420642494\\times 2064), and the Potsdam dataset consists of 38 tiles (6000×6000600060006000\\times 6000 pixels). All pixels of the sample images are annotated with six common land cover categories. NWPU VHR-10 dataset: This dataset is a multi-source and multi-resolution object detection dataset covering 10 categories. The images are divided into two sub-datasets, including a positive sample dataset of 650 images and a negative sample dataset of 150 images.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: are used for evaluation the performance of proposed methods in three RSI recognition tasks, including AID dataset , NWPU-RESISC45 dataset , PatternNet dataset , RSI-CB dataset , UC-Merced dataset [ref]50, ISPRS 2-D  and NWPU VHR-10 dataset .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
