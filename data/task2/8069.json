      "content": "Paper Title: Brain Inspired Probabilistic Occupancy Grid Mapping with Hyperdimensional Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we present an innovative approach to occupancy grid mapping (OGM) drawing inspiration from recent advances in cognitive science  and computational neuroscience . Our methodology is grounded in the evolving field of vector symbolic architectures (VSA) [ref]27. VSAs have been conceptualized as a computationally viable abstraction for modeling biological phenomenon, including memory, cognition, and motor control . This research builds upon the foundational work of  which introduced Spatial Semantic Pointers (SSP). SSPs define an algebraic framework founded on hyperdimensional vectors of unitary phasors and circular convolution. Previous studies demonstrate the efficacy of SSP-based VSA systems serving as kernel density estimators in hyperdimensional space . Expanding upon these prior works, we describe an end-to-end OGM framework founded on SSPs, VSA-OGM. Existing approaches to occupancy grid mapping encounter two prominent challenges. Firstly, theoretical methods offer high accuracy but struggle with significant time complexity due to the learning and parameterization of fully specified statistical distributions. Secondly, neural methods demonstrate high accuracy in extrapolating beyond observed domains with reduced latency but have limited application in mission and safety critical applications due to operating stochasticity unseen domains. In response to these challenges, our approach pioneers a novel direction in OGM systems drawing inspiration from theoretical and neural methodologies. Known as quasi-neural methods, this innovative framework seeks to leverage the determinism and high accuracy of theoretical approaches while harnessing the enhanced computational efficiency of neural methods. By amalgamating the strengths of both domains, quasi-neural methods offer a promising solution to address the computational complexity and stochasticity issues prevalent in current mapping techniques. We showcase the efficacy of VSA-OGM as a quasi-neural method through comprehensive evaluation, including an ablation study and quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art theoretical   and neural methods [ref]12. In our ablation study, we assess the influence of key parameters, including vector dimensionality, distribution length-scale, spatial chunking, and local entropy extraction. Our findings illuminate the impact of these parameters on the accuracy, stability, and graceful degradation of system performance. Our results and analysis underscore the robustness and adaptability of our hyperdimensional occupancy grid mapping system, positioning it as a promising alternative that bridges the strengths of both theoretical and neural methodologies in addressing complex spatial mapping tasks. Compared to theoretical methods, our approach achieves similar levels of mapping accuracy while significantly reducing inference latency by approximately 200.0x and 4.0x when compared to Bayesian Hilbert Maps (BHM)  and Fast Bayesian Hilbert Maps (Fast-BHM) , respectively. Furthermore, our method facilitates multi-map fusion among multiple agents. Our results demonstrate minimal information loss during the fusion process and performance comparable to that of Fast-BHM. This capability highlights the versatility and scalability of our approach in collaborative, multi-agent mapping scenarios. In comparison to the neural method presented in EviLOG [ref]12, VSA-OGM demonstrates the capability to accurately model and interpolate LiDAR points sampled along major road sections and around moving vehicles without the need for a 29.6329.6329.63 hour pretraining session. This highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach in capturing complex environmental dynamics. However, it’s important to note a key distinction between VSA-OGM and EviLOG: while our method excels in accurately representing data within the observed domain, it encounters challenges in extrapolating outside this domain, particularly in areas with extremely limited information. This limitation arises from our method’s fundamental principle of not assuming any specific properties about the operating environment. It is worth noting that EviLOG may be more susceptible to domain adaptation issues, as it is finely tuned to extrapolate domain-specific information.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: mapping (OGM) drawing inspiration from recent advances in cognitive science  and computational neuroscience .
