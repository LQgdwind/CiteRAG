      "content": "Paper Title: A Review of Speaker Diarization: Recent Advances with Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis paper has provided a comprehensive overview of\nspeaker diarization techniques, highlighting the recent development of deep learning-based diarization approaches.\nIn the early days, a speaker diarization system was\ndeveloped as a pipeline of sub-modules including front-end processing,\nSAD, segmentation, speaker embedding extraction,\nclustering, and post-processing, leading to a standalone system\nwithout much connection to other components in a given speech application.\nWith the emergence of the deep learning technology,\nmore and more advancements have been made for speaker diarization,\nfrom a method that replaces a single module into a deep-learning-based method,\nto a fully EEND.\nFurthermore,\nas the speech recognition technology becomes more accessible,\na trend to tightly integrate speaker diarization into the ASR systems has emerged, such as benefiting from the ASR output to improve the accuracy of speaker diarization.\nRecently, joint modeling for speaker diarization and speech recognition is investigated in an attempt to\nenhance the overall performance of speaker diarization.\nThanks to these great achievements, speaker diarization systems have already\nbeen used in many applications, including meeting transcription,\nconversational interaction analysis, audio indexing, and conversational AI systems.\n As we have seen,\ntremendous progress has been made for speaker diarization systems.\nNevertheless, there is still much room for improvement.\nAs the final remark, we\nconclude this paper by listing the\nremaining challenges for speaker diarization\ntoward future research and development. Most speaker diarization methods assume that an entire recording can be observed to execute speaker diarization.\nHowever, numerous applications such as meeting transcription systems or smart agents require\nvery short latency for assigning the speaker.\nWhile there have been several attempts to make online speaker diarization system\nboth for clustering-based systems (e.g., [ref]218)\nand neural network-based diarization systems (e.g.,  [ref]172 [ref]173),\nit still remains as a challenging problem. A model that is trained on a data in a specific domain often works poorly\non data in another domain.\nFor example,\nit is experimentally known that the EEND model tends to overfit to the\ndistribution of the speaker overlaps of the training data .\nSuch a domain mismatch issue is universal for any training-based method.\nGiven the growing interest for trainable speaker diarization systems,\nit will become more important to evaluate the ability for handling the variety of inputs.\nThe international evaluation efforts for speaker diarization such as\nthe DIHARD challenge    or VoxSRC   also have great importance in this direction. Overlap of multitalker speech is the inevitable nature of conversation.\nFor example, an average of 12% to 15% of speaker overlap was observed in meeting recordings\n ,\nand it could even increase in daily conversations   .\nNevertheless, many traditional speaker diarization systems, especially clustering-based systems,\nhave only focused on non-overlapping regions and even the overlapping regions are excluded in the evaluation metric .\nWhile the topic has been studied for long years\n(e.g. early works  ),\nthere is a growing interest for handling the speaker overlaps toward better speaker diarization,\nincluding the application of speech separation ,\npost-processing  , and\njoint modeling of speech separation and speaker diarization  . Many applications require ASR results along with speaker diarization results.\nIn the modular combination of speaker diarization and ASR,\nsome systems locate a speaker diarization system before ASR  while\nsome systems locate a speaker diarization system after ASR  .\nBoth types of systems showed a strong performance for a specific task,\nand determining the best kind of system architecture for the speaker diarization and ASR tasks is still an open problem .\nFurthermore, there is another line of research to jointly perform\nspeaker diarization and ASR    ,\nwhich was introduced in Section 4.\nThe joint modeling approach could leverage the inter-dependency between speaker diarization and ASR\nto better perform both tasks.\nHowever, it has not yet been fully investigated whether such joint frameworks perform better than\nthe well-tuned modular systems.\nOverall, the integration of speaker diarization and ASR is one of the hottest topics\nthat is still being investigated by many researchers. Visual information contains a strong clue for the identification of speakers.\nFor example, the video captured by\na fish-eye camera was used to improve the accuracy of speaker diarization in a meeting transcription task .\nThe visual information was also used to significantly improve the accuracy of speaker diarization.\nfor speaker diarization on YouTube video .\nWhile these studies showed the effectiveness of visual information,\nthe audiovisual speaker diarization has yet been rarely investigated compared with\naudio-only speaker diarization, and there will be many rooms for improvement.\n\nReference markers found: [218]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]218: or smart agents require\nvery short latency for assigning the speaker.\nWhile there have been several attempts to make online speaker diarization system\nboth for clustering-based systems (e.g., [ref]218)\nand neural network-based diarization systems (e.g.,  [ref]172 [ref]173),\nit still remains as a challenging problem.
