      "content": "Paper Title: FibeRed: Fiberwise Dimensionality Reduction of Topologically Complex Data with Vector Bundles\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe apply FibeRed to three examples.\nWe reproduce a dynamical system simulation from  and reconstruct an attractor—a torus.\nWe reconstruct the conformation space—a Möbius band—and energy landscape of the pentane molecule from a simulation using RDKit ; this is inspired by an analysis in .\nFinally, we reconstruct the conformation space of the cyclooctane molecule—a Klein bottle glued to a 222-sphere—using the data of [ref]30. We compare FibeRed to various well known dimensionality reduction algorithms (see\n\\crefsection:other-runs\nfor more results).\nGiven that we consider topologically non-trivial data, we follow   and evaluate the output of algorithms using persistent homology and persistence diagrams (PDs) to quantify the preservation of large scale topology (see\n\\crefsection:background\nfor background and references).\nWhen we do not clarify the field of coefficients used to compute a PD, the PD is independent of this choice.\nSee \\creftable:minimal-target-dimensions for a summary. For the initial map π:X→B:𝜋→𝑋𝐵\\pi:X\\to B we use the implementation of circular coordinates in 7.\nThe parameters for FibeRed are chosen as in \\crefsection:choosing-parameters and the computed Stiefel–Whitney obstructions are in \\creffigure:sw-obstructions.\nFor persistent homology computations, we use ripser  on geodesic distance, estimated as shortest path distance in a 15-nearest neighbor graph.\nFor other dimensionality reduction algorithms, we use their scikit-learn implementation . An implementation and Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the examples is in . Torus from attractor of double-gyre dynamical system.\nDynamical systems can be analyzed by studying the topology of their attractors  .\nGiven a real-valued time series coming from measurements of a given particle on which a dynamical system acts, one can obtain a pointcloud by constructing a delay embedding of the time series, which, under certain conditions, is concentrated around a diffeomorphic copy of the attractor the particle is converging to .\nUsing the delay embedding method with target dimension 444, it was shown in [13, Section 4.1] that a certain attractor of the double-gyre dynamical system 0 is orientable and has the homology of a torus.\nHere, we reproduce the simulation of  using the code from  and apply dimensionality reduction to this 444D pointcloud, with the goal of embedding the attractor and its dynamics in ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3}. In \\creffigure:torus-example, we show the results of FibeRed and t-SNE.\nIn order to highlight self-intersections in low-dimensional representations, we use the following function: given a dataset X𝑋X and a representation of it f:X→Y:𝑓→𝑋𝑌f:X\\to Y let κ:X→ℝ:𝜅→𝑋ℝ\\kappa:X\\to\\mathbb{R} be defined by κ​(x)=miny∈X⁡dY​(f​(x),f​(y))/dX​(x,y)𝜅𝑥subscript𝑦𝑋subscript𝑑𝑌𝑓𝑥𝑓𝑦subscript𝑑𝑋𝑥𝑦\\kappa(x)=\\min_{y\\in X}d_{Y}(f(x),f(y))/d_{X}(x,y).\nThe output of t-SNE in \\creffigure:torus-example is representative of the output with other parameter choices and other dimensionality reduction algorithms we have tried on this data (LE, DM, LLE, HLLE, Isomap, UMAP): if the target dimension is 3, there are always self-intersections or tears.\nThe difficulty faced by metric-based algorithms in this example is that the input torus in 4D has an approximately flat metric and thus it does not admit a smooth isometric embedding in ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3}. Möbius band from conformation space of pentane.\nAny fixed molecule admits different realizations, or conformations, in three-dimensional space.\nIn, e.g., molecular dynamics 1, one is interested in understanding all possible conformations of a molecule.\nThe collection of conformations up to rotations and translations is known as the conformation space of the molecule.\nEach conformation has an associated energy and the conformation space together with the energy function is known as the energy landscape of the molecule. We reconstruct the conformation space and energy landscape of the pentane molecule from a simulation (see\n\\crefsection:pentane-data-generation\nfor details).\nThe pentane molecule has two rotational degrees of freedom (modelled as a torus S1×S1superscript𝑆1superscript𝑆1S^{1}\\times S^{1}) but also has a symmetry which interchanges the two angles of rotation.\nFor this reason, the (unlabeled) conformation space consists of a quotient of the torus, which can be seen to be a Möbius band.\nIn \\creffigure:mobius-example, we embed the conformation space of pentane in ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3} and compare the output of FibeRed to that of Isomap and t-SNE.\nLE and DM are able to recover a Möbius band in ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3}; since UMAP uses LE as initialization, it is also able to recover the Möbius band in ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3}.\nIn \\creffigure:mobius-example-conformation, we use the cut-unfold technique to find a fundamental domain of the conformation space and estimate the energy landscape. The difficulty faced by some of the metric-based dimensionality reduction algorithms in this example is that, with respect to the intrinsic metric, the ratio between the height of the Möbius band and its circumference is approximately 2/3232/3 and thus there is no isometric embedding in ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3} [22, Theorem 15.1]. Klein bottle from conformation space of cyclooctane.\nIn this example, we reconstruct the conformation space and energy landscape of the cyclooctane molecule using the dataset of [ref]30.\nIn [ref]30, it is shown that the conformation space of cyclooctane consists of a 2-sphere glued to a Klein bottle along two disjoint circles\nand a parametrization of the dataset is given using Isomap and knowledge about how the data was generated. By estimating the local dimension of the data, we first separate the Klein bottle part of the dataset from the 2-sphere.\nIn \\creffigure:klein-example, we embed the Klein bottle part of the data in 4D.\nWe were not able to recover the right topology in ℝ4superscriptℝ4\\mathbb{R}^{4} using any of LE, DM, LLE, HLLE, LTSA, Isomap, or t-SNE.\nMeanwhile, UMAP is able to recover the right topology in ℝ4superscriptℝ4\\mathbb{R}^{4}.\nIn order to evaluate the 4D embeddings, we use the following distinguishing feature of the Klein bottle K𝐾K: with ℤ/2ℤ2\\mathbb{Z}/2 coefficients we have dim(H1​(K;ℤ/2))=2dimensionsuperscript𝐻1𝐾ℤ22\\dim(H^{1}(K;\\mathbb{Z}/2))=2 and dim(H2​(K;ℤ/2))=1dimensionsuperscript𝐻2𝐾ℤ21\\dim(H^{2}(K;\\mathbb{Z}/2))=1, while with ℤ/3ℤ3\\mathbb{Z}/3 coefficients we have dim(H1​(K;ℤ/3))=1dimensionsuperscript𝐻1𝐾ℤ31\\dim(H^{1}(K;\\mathbb{Z}/3))=1 and dim(H2​(K;ℤ/3))=0dimensionsuperscript𝐻2𝐾ℤ30\\dim(H^{2}(K;\\mathbb{Z}/3))=0.\nIn \\creffigure:cyclooctane-full-parametrization, we produce an efficient 2D parametrization of the conformation space of cyclooctane without using a priori knowledge of how the data was generated. The difficulty faced by metric-based algorithms in this example is that the Klein bottle in high dimensional space has aspect ratio close to 111 (i.e., an isometric representation by a fundamental domain such as the one \\creffigure:cyclooctane-full-parametrization (left) has commensurable height and width), and thus it does not admit a simple isometric embedding in ℝ4superscriptℝ4\\mathbb{R}^{4}.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: from a simulation using RDKit ; this is inspired by an analysis in .\nFinally, we reconstruct the conformation space of the cyclooctane molecule—a Klein bottle glued to a 222-sphere—using the data of [ref]30.
