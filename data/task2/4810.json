      "content": "Paper Title: Boosting Adversarial Robustness From The Perspective of Effective Margin Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nArchitectures and Datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of EMR with ResNet18  and WideResNet-34-10 [ref]52 following existing work on adversarial robustness [ref]33. The experiment is run on CIFAR10 , consisting of 50k training and 10k test images. There are 10 object categories in CIFAR10 and each category has 5000 training and 1000 test images. Both adversarial training with PGD [ref]33 and TRADES PGD  are used in the experiment. Training Setting. We use a standard SGD-Momentum optimizer and XE loss for training. All experiments use an initial learning rate of 0.1 and batch size of 128. For AT-PGD, we train the network for 100 epochs and the learning rate is divided by 10 at epochs 60 and 90. For TRADES, we train the network for 130 epochs and the learning rate is divided by 10 at epochs 60 and 120. Note that for EMR, when the learning rate is decayed, λE​M​Rsubscript𝜆𝐸𝑀𝑅\\lambda_{EMR} is also divided by 10. To avoid robust overfitting [ref]40, we split the original training set into a training and validation set with 48k and 2k images respectively, and select a model with the best robust test accuracy on the validation set. If not mentioned, all methods are evaluated using the model selection based on the validation set for a fair comparison. Evaluation. FGSM , PGD [ref]33 and AutoAttack  are used to evaluate the adversarial robustness of a DNN. In FGSM, PGD and AutoAttack, we use the l∞subscript𝑙l_{\\infty} norm as the metric to bound the adversarial perturbation.\nThe l∞subscript𝑙l_{\\infty} norm PGD attack uses gradient ascent to increase the loss by updating the input image and projecting it to an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-bounded l∞subscript𝑙l_{\\infty} ball.\n\nFGSM is a special case of PGD using only 1 iteration.\nAutoAttack is an ensemble of parameter-free attacks consisting of Auto-PGDCE, Auto-PGD with Difference of Logits Ratio loss, FAB  and Squared Attack . In our experiment, we use ϵ=8/255=0.031italic-ϵ82550.031\\epsilon=8/255=0.031 and α=2/255=0.0078𝛼22550.0078\\alpha=2/255=0.0078 in FGSM and PGD, and ϵ=0.031italic-ϵ0.031\\epsilon=0.031 for AutoAttack. We notice that PGD without random start is more effective than PGD with random start so our PGD evaluation starts from the input image without random noise. Baselines. To make a fair comparison between EMR and baseline with WD, we search the λW​Dsubscript𝜆𝑊𝐷\\lambda_{WD} from 2e-4 to 1e-3, so that the improvement of EMR upon WD is not a result of weak WD regularization. Besides AT and TRADES, we compare EMR with Input Gradient Regularization (IGR)  and Hypersphere Embedding (HE) . IGR regularizes the squared l2subscript𝑙2l_{2} norm of the loss, instead of the network output as with EMR, with respect to the input. HE applies a normalization function to the feature, i.e., output of the penultimate layer, and the classification layer’s weight, so that the XE loss is only determined by the cosine similarity. We compare the performance of HE and our EMR in the WideResNet experiment using their official implementation. For IGR and HE, we use their default training parameters. For EMR, we select the hyperparameters with grid search. The specific hyperparameter settings are reported in the supplemental.\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: Architectures and Datasets.
