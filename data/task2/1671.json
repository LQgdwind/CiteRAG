Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

The input of the semantic labelling process can be raw or pre-labelled urban datasets such as the automatically generated results from over-segmentation or semantic segmentation (see Section 3.3).\nRegardless of the input data, it still needs to be manually checked and annotated with a labelling tool, which involves selecting a correct semantic label from a predefined list for each triangle (or point, depending on the dataset) by users.\nIn addition, some interactive approaches can make the labelling process semi-manual.\nHowever, unlike our proposed approach, the labelling work of most of the 3D benchmark data does not take full advantage of over-segmentation and semantic segmentation on 3D data, and interactive annotation in the 3D space. We present in this section an overview of the publicly available semantic 3D urban benchmark datasets categorised by sensors and reconstruction types (see Table 1).\nMore specifically, we elaborate on the quality, scale, and labelling strategy of the existing urban datasets regarding semantic segmentation.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: M𝑀M\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n3D Manually\n\nNot reported\n\nParis-rue-Madame \n\nMLS\n2014\n\n\nPoint Cloud\n\n0.16 k​m𝑘𝑚km\n17\n\n\n20 M𝑀M\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n2D semantic segmentation\n\n\n\n3D Semi-manually\n\nNot reported\n\niQmulus [ref]19\n\nMLS\n2015\n\n\nPoint Cloud\n\n10 k​m𝑘𝑚km\n8\n\n\n300 M𝑀M\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n2D Semi-manually\n\nNot reported\n\nSemantic3D \n\nTLS\n2017\n\n\nPoint Cloud\n\n-\n8\n\n\n4000 M𝑀M\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n2D & 3D Semi-manually\n\nNot\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
