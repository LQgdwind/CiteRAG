Shallow encoding models map each entity to a unique embedding vector. These methods rely on embedding lookup during inference, and can only make predictions for the nodes observed during training.\nFor example, TransE¬†[ref]38 and RotatE use head-to-tail node relations to compute the plausibility of triples based on a distance function (e.g.,¬†Euclidean distance between entities).\nConvE and ComplEx¬† exploit similarity of latent features. RGCN¬†[ref]40 uses a Graph Convolutional Network-based entity and relation encoder to learn entity representations.\nNodePiece¬† represents each node as a set of top-k nearest anchor nodes and mùëöm unique relation types around the node. Anchor nodes and relation types are encoded in a node representation that can be used in any downstream prediction task for any entity, including those unobserved during training. For baseline experiments we use the Pykeen library¬† and construct a static graph from the training data. We follow the best practices introduced in the Pykeen library (e.g.,¬†training approach, loss function, and the explicit modeling of inverse relations)¬†[ref]43. For example, we follow stochastic local closed world assumption, where a random candidate set of triplets that are not part of the graph are considered as negative candidates. In addition, we compare our proposed model performance with the original RE-Net and TGN models.\nCompared to our DGT model, these models rely on gated recurrent unit sequence layers instead of Transformer layers. For the RE-Net model and its variants, we supply a batch size of 1,024, a hidden dimension of 200, and maintain default parameters listed in the original paper¬†.\nFor the TGN model and its variants, we supply a batch size of 200 and a memory dimension of 172.\nAll other parameters are unchanged from the original TGN paper¬†.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: map each entity to a unique embedding vector. These methods rely on embedding lookup during inference, and can only make predictions for the nodes observed during training.\nFor example, TransE¬†[ref]38 and RotatE use head-to-tail node relations to compute the plausibility of triples based on a distance function (e.g.,¬†Euclidean distance between entities).\nConvE and ComplEx¬† exploit\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
