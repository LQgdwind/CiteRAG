Recently, increasing attention is paid to how to apply deep learning for non-euclidean data like graphs, which is widely used in various tasks, such as social network, protein interface prediction[ref]13, knowledge graph embedding1, etc. In retrospect, graph neural networks also help with lots of tasks in computer vision or natural language processing, like object detection7, action recognition, machine translation, semantic parsing15, etc. Specifically, most GNNs exploit a neighborhood aggregation mechanism that could incorporate information from both the node attributes and graph topology. The node embedding generated can then be used for downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction, graph classification (an extra readout module in need), etc.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Recently, increasing attention is paid to how to apply deep learning for non-euclidean data like graphs, which is widely used in various tasks, such as social network, protein interface prediction[ref]13, knowledge graph embedding1, etc. In retrospect, graph neural networks also help with lots of tasks in computer vision or natural language processing, like object detection7, action\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
