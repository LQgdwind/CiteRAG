[ref]22 employed pix2pix  network to generate\nhigh-quality faces from noisy ones. Additionally, they introduced a multi-quality fusion\nnetwork (MQFNet) to fuse data of different qualities and improve FR performance.\nZhao et al. [ref]24 proposed a lightweight multiscale fusion network\n(LMFNet) with a hierarchical structure, achieving superior performance on Lock3DFace. Among these methods, Led3D  and MQFNet [ref]22 are most\nrelevant to our LDNFNet.\nLed3D introduced an efficient deep model for 3D face recognition.\nIn our work, we extend Led3D into a three-path form to fully utilize the complementary information\nbetween different modalities.\nOn the other hand, MQFNet uses general convolutional layers to achieve feature fusion\nfrom data of different qualities.\nHowever, we propose an innovative multi-branch convolutional fusion block to mine\nmore diverse fusion representations with fewer parameters and computations.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: In the last few decades, 3D FR has received significant attention, especially with the\nrelease of high-quality 3D face databases like FRGC v2 ,\nBU3D-FE [ref]8, and Bosphorus .\nHigh-quality 3D FR has demonstrated impressive recognition results,\nbut the performance of low-quality 3D FR remains unsatisfactory.\n Some early works   primarily relied\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
