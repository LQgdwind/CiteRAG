      "content": "Paper Title: Stochastic Collapse: How Gradient Noise Attracts SGD Dynamics Towards Simpler Subnetworks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImplicit biases of SGD.\nSeveral recent works have explored the properties of SGD and its implicit biases.\nBarrett and Dherin [ref]3 showed how SGD can be interpreted as adding implicit gradient norm regularization and Geiping et¬†al.  showed that training full-batch gradient descent while explicitly adding this regularization can achieve the same performance as SGD.\nKunin et¬†al. [ref]5 showed how the anisotropic structure of SGD noise effectively modifies the loss and HaoChen et¬†al.  showed that parameter-dependent noise introduces an implicit bias towards local minima with smaller variance, while spherical Gaussian noise does not.\nBlanc et¬†al. [ref]7 and Damian et¬†al.  studied the dynamics of gradient descent with label noise near a manifold of minima and proved that SGD implicitly regularizes the trace of the Hessian.\nLi et¬†al.  developed a framework to study this bias of SGD by considering the projection of the trajectory to the manifold.\nKleinberg et¬†al.  showed how SGD is effectively operating on a smoother version of the original loss allowing it to escape sharp local minima.\nZhu et¬†al.  further demonstrated how the anisotropic structure of SGD noise helps SGD escape efficiently.\nXie et¬†al.  demonstrated that the covariance matrix of SGD approximates the Hessian around local minima, and thus the escape rate from a minima is linked to the Hessian eigenvalues or flatness.\nWhile numerous studies have sought to identify the origin of SGD‚Äôs implicit bias, most have predominantly focused on how SGD introduces an implicit regularization term [ref]3  [ref]5, minimizes a measure of curvature among equivalent minima [ref]7  , or escapes from sharp local minima    .\nIn our work, we provide a novel perspective and discuss how stochastic gradients introduce a strong attraction towards regions of parameter space associated with simpler subnetworks, even when this attraction is detrimental to the full-batch train loss. Simplicity biases.\nSeveral works have explored implicit biases that encourage some notion of sparsity or low-rankness in neural network learning dynamics.\nKunin et¬†al.  showed how gradient flow training with an exponential loss can lead to sparse solutions via an implicit max-margin process.\nWoodworth et¬†al.  demonstrated how an implicit L1subscriptùêø1L_{1} penalty occurs for diagonal linear networks trained with gradient flow in the limit of small initialization.\nNacson et¬†al.  and Pesme et¬†al.  showed how large step sizes and stochastic gradients further bias these networks towards the sparse regime.\nAndriushchenko et¬†al.  observed that longer training with large learning rates keeps SGD high in the loss landscape where an implicit bias towards sparsity is stronger and theoretically analyzed diagonal linear networks, showing that an associated SDE has implicit bias towards sparser representations.\nVivien et¬†al.  studied the role of label noise in inducing an implicit Lasso regularization for quadratically parameterized models.¬†Kunin et¬†al.  and Ziyin et¬†al.  showed how weight decay induce a bias towards rank minimization for linear networks.\nGalanti et¬†al.  and Wang and Jacot  extended this observation to deep settings trained with SGD.\nJacot  theoretically, and Huh et¬†al.  empirically, showed an implicit bias towards learning low-rank functions with increasing depth.\nGur-Ari et¬†al.  showed that gradients of SGD converge to a small subspace spanned by a few top eigenvectors of the Hessian.\nZiyin et¬†al.  demonstrated how data augmentation can promote dimensional collapse of representations in self-supervised learning.\nWhile many works have explored the emergence of sparsity or low-rankness during training, much of the analysis is confined to a particular architecture or consists of general empirical observations lacking a clear underlying mechanism.\nIn our work, we focus on a fundamental characteristic of neural networks trained with SGD that leads to novel empirical observations. Our analysis is closely related to a recent work studying failure modes of SGD  and a concurrent follow up work studying the stability of SGD near a fixed point .\nIn App.¬†A we further discuss these works and other relevant works.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Implicit biases of SGD.\nSeveral recent works have explored the properties of SGD and its implicit biases.\nBarrett and Dherin [ref]3 showed how SGD can be interpreted as adding implicit gradient norm regularization and Geiping et¬†al.  showed that training full-batch gradient descent while explicitly adding this\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
