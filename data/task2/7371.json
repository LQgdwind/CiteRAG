      "content": "Paper Title: Can Shape-Infused Joint Embeddings Improve Image-Conditioned 3D Diffusion?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe undertake a comparative analysis of the shape generation quality and diversity between our CISP-driven model and the CLIP-driven model.\nQuality is defined as the fidelity of the generated shapes, without accounting for their alignment with the reference image or their variation. Diversity, instead, pertains to the range of structural variations in shapes, disregarding their logical structure or alignment with the input image. Both measurements are crucial for a well-performing generative model. Our comparison focuses primarily on the two presented models; however, for context, we also reference the performance of recent 3D Deep Diffusion Probabilistic Models  [ref]23  [ref]10.\nGiven that quality and diversity evaluations in existing literature are typically unguided, we adjust our methodology accordingly to ensure a fair and equivalent comparison. Our approach to unconditioned generation involves removing guiding images in our model and replacing Eisubscript𝐸𝑖E_{i} embeddings and Ecsubscript𝐸𝑐E_{c}\ntokens with pre-learned null tokens. The primary metric for our comparative analysis is the 1-Nearest Neighbor Accuracy (1-NNA), as it is acknowledged as the most indicative metric for 3D generation , addressing issues of other metrics such as Matching Distance (MMD) and Coverage (COV). 1-NNA, introduced in [ref]39 and later applied to 3D generation in , evaluates the diversity and quality of generated samples through a 1-Nearest Neighbor classifier’s accuracy. We define Sgsubscript𝑆𝑔S_{g} as the set of generated samples and Srsubscript𝑆𝑟S_{r} as the reference samples set, with |Sr|=|Sg|subscript𝑆𝑟subscript𝑆𝑔|S_{r}|=|S_{g}|. For a sample x𝑥x, let Nxsubscript𝑁𝑥N_{x} represent its nearest neighbor, where Nx∈{Sg∪Sr−x}subscript𝑁𝑥subscript𝑆𝑔subscript𝑆𝑟𝑥{N_{x}\\in\\{S_{g}\\cup S_{r}-x\\}}. 1-NNA is then computed as: Here, 𝕀𝕀\\mathbb{I} is the indicator function. The ideal 1-NNA score is 50%percent5050\\%, indicating a precise classification of generated and reference shapes by the 1-NN classifier. To adapt voxel shapes for EMD and CD analysis, we follow the procedure outlined in PVD , sampling 2048 points from each generated shape’s surface. Our methodology also incorporates metrics implementations from PVD’s publicly available code. \n\n\n\n\n\n1-NNA\n\n\n\nShape\nModel\nCD\nEMD\n\nAeroplane\n\n71.69\n66.74\n\n[ref]23\n62.71\n67.14\n\nPVD \n73.82\n64.81\n\nLION [ref]10\n67.41\n61.23\n\nOurs (CLIP)\n63.37\n59.79\n\nOurs (CISP)\n58.93\n56.93\n\nCar\n\n-\n-\n\n[ref]23\n-\n-\n\nPVD \n54.55\n53.83\n\nLION [ref]10\n53.70\n52.34\n\nOurs (CLIP)\n53.17\n53.97\n\nOurs (CISP)\n53.20\n53.11\n\nChair\n\n61.47\n61.62\n\n[ref]23\n62.08\n64.45\n\nPVD \n56.26\n53.32\n\nLION [ref]10\n53.41\n51.14\n\nOurs (CLIP)\n53.52\n51.69\n\nOurs (CISP)\n53.30\n51.97\n\n\n\naBest of our models highlighted in bold.\n\nbBest overall model is underlined.\n\n\n The results, detailed in Table I, show that both our models obtain high quality and diversity, comparable or superior to the literature in this domain. When compared, CLIP- and CISP-guided models achieve similar quality and diversity across most categories. An exception is noted in the Aeroplane category, where the CISP-guided model shows notable improvements of 7.5%percent7.57.5\\% and 5%percent55\\% in CD and EMD metrics, respectively. Although similar scores were anticipated for both models due to the unguided nature of the experiments, which does not account for coherence, the CISP-guided model’s training involved learning from a 3D-informed space. This aspect likely contributed to its enhanced performance in certain categories, such as aeroplanes, indicating a better grasp of 3D semantics and structural features.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: generative model.
