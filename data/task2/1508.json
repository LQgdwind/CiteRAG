      "content": "Paper Title: On the Generalizability of Motion Models for Road Users in Heterogeneous Shared Traffic Spaces\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nShared space design principles  have been drawing significant attention in recent years, as an alternative to traditional regulated traffic designs. In shared spaces, heterogeneous road users such as pedestrians, cars, bicycles share the same space. Unlike traditional traffic environments, in shared spaces, there are no or very few road signs, signals, and markings; this causes frequent direct interactions among road users to coordinate their trajectories. There is an ongoing debate on the safeness of shared spaces; while some studies state that the lack of explicit traffic regulations makes road users more safety-conscious and may lead to fewer road accidents   , others ( [ref]5) argue the lack of acceptance and understanding of the concept can compromise safety in shared spaces.\nNotwithstanding this debate, traditional road designs have been replaced by shared spaces in a growing number of urban areas; some examples are the Laweiplein intersection in Drachten, Skvallertorget in Norrköping, and Kensington High Street in London . Yet, the lack of explicit rules makes it essential to investigate the safety issues in shared spaces. Modeling and simulation shared spaces by analyzing and reproducing the motion behaviors of road users including their interactions is crucial to assess and optimize such spaces during the planning phase. Realistic simulation models can also form a safe basis for autonomous cars to learn how to interact with other road users. Interpreting and modeling mixed-traffic interactions pose challenging problems; an interaction can be a simple reaction or a result of complex human decision-making processes, i.e., modifying speed or direction by predicting other road users’ behavior, or communicating with them . Moreover, how one interacts with others is dependent on many factors like their transport mode, current situation, road structures and conditions, social norms (culture), and many individual factors (e.g. age, gender, or time pressure ). To the best of our knowledge, so far, there are not many works on modeling and simulation of shared spaces. We observe mostly two different state-of-the-art approaches: (1) physics-based models, mainly the social force model (SFM) of pedestrian dynamics  including numerous extensions adding, e.g., new forces, decision-theoretic concepts, or rule-based constraints, to describe different types of actors such as cars   or bicycles 0; and (2) cellular Automata (CA) models 1 2 3, which are mainly used for modeling mixed-traffic flows in settings with explicit traffic regulations, unlike most shared spaces. Although these approaches perform well for single bilateral conflicts (i.e., for any point in time, a road user can only handle a single explicit conflict with one other user), they fail in representing multiple conflicts among heterogeneous road users and groups, which are very common in shared spaces. Hence, in our previous works, we integrated SFM with a game-theoretic model to address both bilateral and multiple conflicts among pedestrians and cars 4 5. In this paper, we describe conflict as “an observable situation in which two or more road users approach each other in time and space to such an extent that there is a risk of collision if their movements remain unchanged” as specified in 6; here, we use the terms conflict and interaction interchangeably. In the literature, motion models do not adequately consider the differences in road users’ behaviors induced by differing environmental settings. These models are usually calibrated and validated using scenarios from a single shared space environment. In 7, we took a first step to address this gap by proposing the concept of zone-specific motion behaviors for pedestrians and cars, considering road and intersection zones. In 8, we evaluated the transferability111We use the terms transferability and generalizability interchangeably of our existing model by modeling scenarios that differ from the one used in 7 in terms of traffic conditions, spatial layout and social norms. Subsequent results show that our model can suitably replicate the motion of pedestrians and cars from the new scenarios. In this paper, we delve further into this direction by proposing a conceptually systematic and simple process of modeling general motion models and output a moderate version of a general motion model for pedestrians and cars, by following our proposed modeling process. A general model should be able to reproduce a large variety of motion behaviors of heterogeneous road users ranging from simple free-flow motions to resulted-motions from complex interactions and transferable to new environments with minimal time and effort. The differences between the current work and our previous work (8) in terms of model transferability are:\n(1) In this paper, we build a general model to capture motion behaviors from three data sets with incremental integration of new motion behaviors, and a well-defined and largely automated calibration process to adapt model parameters to the target environment. Whereas in 8, as we did not have any specific process to generate a general motion model, to adapt to the new environment, we had to analyze, consider and explicitly change our model parameters and methods based on the social norms of that new environment, which resulted in different versions of our model, i.e. each version for each different environment. (2) In the current work, the transferability of our model is evaluated using the DUT and HBS data sets as in 8 and also by a new data set (CITR) that contains unique conflict scenarios than the other two data sets (see Section IV). We further introduce heterogeneity in pedestrian motion by recognizing different motion patterns, by calibrating individual motion characteristics (e.g., sensitivity when interacting with others) and clustering them into different groups 222In this paper, the keyword group is used to represent a set of pedestrians with a similar motion pattern, not the social group, e.g., family members. (see Section VI). The contributions of this paper are: We propose a systematic process to formulate a general motion model. We propose a motion model for pedestrians and cars, which can simulate a large variety of conflict scenarios among road users and evaluate the generalizability of our model by using three different shared space data sets. The results of our evaluation process indicate that our model achieves satisfactory performance for each data set. We present a methodology to recognize and model different motion patterns of pedestrians from real-world data sets. To do so, we investigate several approaches to cluster pedestrians with similar motion patterns into groups. Our evaluation results show that the heterogeneity in pedestrians motion improves the model performance. Following a review of previous research in Section\nII, we propose the formulation of a general model for movement modeling of heterogeneous road users in Section III. We illustrate the examined data sets and the architecture of our Game-Theoretic Social Force Model (GSFM) in Section IV and Section V, respectively.\nSection VI explains the calibration methodology and recognition of different walking styles of pedestrians. In Section VII, we describe how we evaluate model performance and discuss the results. We conclude by outlining future research venues.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: on the safeness of shared spaces; while some studies state that the lack of explicit traffic regulations makes road users more safety-conscious and may lead to fewer road accidents   , others ( [ref]5) argue the lack of acceptance and understanding of the concept can compromise safety in shared spaces.\nNotwithstanding this debate, traditional road designs have been replaced by shared spaces\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
