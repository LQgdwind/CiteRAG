      "content": "Paper Title: On the Impact of Stable Ranks in Deep Nets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStable Ranks in Neural Networks Obtaining good generalization properties is a central task in current machine learning research as well as practical work. Motivated by classical VC theory , a recent line of work    obtained DNN generalization-error estimates in terms of the so-called stable ranks of the weight matrices (i.e. the ratio of the matrix‚Äôs Frobenius and spectral norms; formal definition is given below). Intuitively, the stable rank is a continuous counterpart of the rank of a matrix and represents the effective ‚Äútrue‚Äù number of parameters, or the ‚Äúeffective‚Äù size of a layer in the DNN. Hence, bounds on the stable rank yield control on the complexity of the weight matrices and, ultimately, on the flexibility of the hidden representations. Recently, stable rank-based regularization was studied [ref]29, and furthermore, [ref]29  empirically demonstrated that carefully crafted regularizations based on spectral norms and stable ranks can lead to impressive performance improvements of DNN models in terms of scaling and generalization (in particular, for Generative Adversarial Networks [ref]12). A major question that was implicitly addressed in the above body of literature asks about the DNN‚Äôs capabilities whenever stable ranks are constrained: Question 1: How can one quantify the trade-off between lower stable ranks, generalization bounds and the network‚Äôs expressivity? In particular, how \"expressive\" can the space of DNNs conditioned on their layers‚Äô stable ranks be? A missing piece of analysis in this regard goes along the net‚Äôs geometric and feed-forward map properties. The notion of DNN expressivity has been central to a substantial body of ML literature (e.g.   and the references therein). By expressivity, one usually refers to the network‚Äôs ability to adapt to a multitude of scenarios and data distributions, still providing meaningful and useful data representations w.r.t. the present task (e.g. classification, clustering, etc). To this end, a highly-expressive neural net should geometrically be capable of shaping and transforming the data in a sufficiently sophisticated way. Hence, our goal in this regard will be to analyze how basic geometric notions such as lengths of curves, distances and curvature change as one applies the feed-forward map of the neural network. Question 2: Is the space of DNNs conditioned on stable ranks useful for initialization? How is this reflected in the training? Previous work in this regard established mostly empirical results on stable rank regularized training [ref]29. However, the theoretical training framework appears to a large extent unexplored. Moreover, interesting related questions if (and why) stable rank initialization alone is beneficial remain open. In this work we discuss Questions 1, 2 in the regime of large-width DNNs. Regarding Question 1: We propose and study a random DNN model constrained on layers‚Äô stable rank (Section 3). After obtaining suitable moment bounds for our non-standard layer sampling, we theoretically study the behavior in the large width limit. Here, we show how one can make use of both simultaneous limit techniques 3  as well as \"classical\" sequential (GP-based) limits    . Regarding the latter and somewhat surprisingly, our non-standard matrix sampling still yields normal distributions via an application of a non-trivial Central Limit Theorem for the Orthogonal group O‚Äã(n)ùëÇùëõO(n) as n‚Üí‚àû‚Üíùëõn\\rightarrow\\infty . Finally, we obtain control on the DNN‚Äôs feed-forward dynamics and see that stable ranks act as linear factors layerwise (Theorem 4.1). Using arguments in   one sees that within our DNN model small stable ranks (bounded above by sùë†s) lead to an exponential decrease of geometric expressivity (regarding the net‚Äôs depth LùêøL) in terms of curvature and curve lengths, i.e. these geometric quantities are bounded by ‚àºsLsimilar-toabsentsuperscriptùë†ùêø\\sim s^{L} (Section 5). At the same time the model-capacitory contribution in the well-known theoretical PAC-based generalization gaps   [ref]29 are improved linearly in terms of the net‚Äôs stable rank, i.e. as ‚àºL‚Äãssimilar-toabsentùêøùë†\\sim Ls. Regarding Question 2: We analyze training of stable rank constrained nets via Neural Tangent Kernels (Section 6). Similar to the feed-forward dynamics, we see that evolution kernels scale layerwise w.r.t. stable ranks. Further, we provide empirical analysis and theoretical motivation as to why stable rank initialization alone could be useful for improving training convergence (Section 7). Further motivation and some open questions In the present paper, the random model methodology is inspired by works such as   - namely, our considerations are mostly taking place within a suitable random DNN model where the layers are stable rank constrained. Furthermore, as in   some of our analysis (and proposed random DNN model) is not making use of data characteristics or training-algorithm information. The guiding idea here is that one attempts to understand generic DNN behavior under stable-rank (capacity) constraints. Moreover, as a first step we implicitly interpret these constraints as well-controlling the PAC-based generalization bounds (Section 2 below). Of course, the full generalization bound also includes a post-training loss term (which in practice is often comparable or negligible in comparison to the other model-capacitory terms) - in this regard one interpretation of our random DNN model is as follows: one trains a black-box DNN without direct access to the layer weights, but after training has information only on stable-ranks and train loss (thus controlling completely the theoretical generalization bound); hence, \"opening the black-box\" could be interpreted in a simplistic way as drawing a DNN from the proposed scheme. Indeed, a natural follow-up would be to improve the random DNN model by explicitly using training or data information. Below we observe how data sets might exhibit ‚Äúnatural‚Äù stable ranks - being able to estimate those in advance is an intriguing open problem. In particular, this might require one to understand and extract insights on how the layers‚Äô stable ranks are related with data Hessian and NTK evolution in the spirit of [ref]1. Another interesting open question addresses the negative correlation between generalization and some PAC-based estimates established empirically for unconstrained/unregularized random DNNs . It is argued in [ref]29 that this observation becomes invalid whenever stable rank constraints/regularization are enforced within this random DNN model. Here, we also provide some empirical analysis in support of the latter. However, the intriguing question how and in which regime the negative correlation holds remains open.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: on the stable rank yield control on the complexity of the weight matrices and, ultimately, on the flexibility of the hidden representations.
