      "content": "Paper Title: CoSCL: Cooperation of Small Continual Learners is Stronger than a Big One\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we extensively evaluate CoSCL on visual classification tasks. All results are averaged over 5 runs with different random seeds and task orders. Benchmark: We consider four representative continual learning benchmarks. The first two are with CIFAR-100 dataset , which includes 100-class colored images of the size 32√ó32323232\\times 32. All classes are split into 20 incremental tasks, based on random sequence (RS) or superclass (SC).\nThe other two are with larger-scale datasets, randomly split into 10 incremental tasks: CUB-200-2011  includes 200 classes and 11,788 bird images of the size 224√ó224224224224\\times 224, and is split as 30 images per class for training while the rest for testing. Tiny-ImageNet  is derived from iILSVRC-2012 , consisting of 200-class natural images of the size 64√ó64646464\\times 64. Implementation: We mainly focus on the task-incremental setting used in [ref]45  [ref]6 [ref]41 and follow their implementation for most experiments if not specified. For all the baselines, we apply a 6-layer CNN architecture for CIFAR-100-SC and CIFAR-100-RS, and an AlexNet-based architecture for CUB-200-2011 and Tiny-ImageNet.222A concurrent work observed that the regular CNN architecture indeed achieves better continual learning performance than more advanced architectures such as ResNet and ViT with the same amount of parameters .\nSince our method consists of multiple continual learners, we use a similar architecture for each sub-network and accordingly reduce the width (i.e., using fewer channels) to keep the total number of parameters comparable to other baselines, so as to make the comparison as fair as possible.\nThen, there is an intuitive trade-off between the number and width of learners.\nAccording to our theoretical analysis in Proposition¬†1 and 2, the choice for the number of learners (i.e., parameter spaces) KùêæK is independent of the training data distribution under a limited parameter budget. Also, we empirically validate that this trade-off is only moderately sensitive (see Fig.¬†5). So we simply set K=5ùêæ5K=5 for all experiments.\nThe learners‚Äô training differs only in random initialization of the parameters. The implementations are further detailed in Appendix B. Overall Performance:\nWe first adapt CoSCL to representative continual learning strategies, including weight regularization such as EWC  and MAS , parameter isolation such as HAT [ref]41 and AGS-CL , and experience replay (ER) of old training samples (20 images per class) . As shown in Fig.¬†1, our proposal that cooperates multiple continual learners with narrower sub-networks can largely improve their performance. Then, we compare with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods under a realistic restriction that old training samples or additional data sources are not available, as detailed below. First, we compare with the SOTA methods that can be plug-and-play with weight regularization baselines, such as AFEC [ref]45 and CPR [ref]6. AFEC [ref]45 encouraged the network parameters to resemble the optimal solution for each new task to mitigate potential negative transfer, while CPR [ref]6 added a regularization term that maximized the entropy of output probability to find a flat minima. In contrast, CoSCL can more effectively improve weight regularization baselines by up to 10.64% on CIFAR-100-SC, 9.33% on CIFAR-100-RS, 11.45% on CUB-200-2011 and 6.72% on Tiny-ImageNet, and achieve the new SOTA performance (detailed in Table 1). At the same time, we consider the SOTA methods that improve continual learning in terms of architecture, such as BNS  and MARK 7. BNS applied neural structure search to build a network for preventing catastrophic forgetting and promoting knowledge transfer, while MARK achieved this goal by learning an additional set of shared weights among tasks.333They both are performed against a similar AlexNet-based architecture. With a similar or smaller parameter budget, ours largely outperforms the two recent strong baselines (see Table¬†2). Detailed Analysis: Now, we use EWC  as the default continual learning method and provide a detailed analysis for the superior performance of CoSCL. First, we analyze the knowledge transfer among tasks by evaluating the metrics of backward transfer (BWT), which is the averaged influence of learning each new task to the old tasks, and forward transfer (FWT), which is the averaged influence of remembering the old tasks to each new task . As shown in Fig.¬†6, CoSCL substantially improves both BWT and FWT of the default method, and in general far exceeds other representative baselines implemented in a single model. In particular, CoSCL raises BWT to almost zero, which means that catastrophic forgetting can be completely avoided.\nWe also evaluate the expertise of each continual learner across tasks in Fig. 7 and Appendix C. The predictions made by each continual learner‚Äôs representations differ significantly and complement with each other. The functional diversity can be naturally obtained from the randomness in architecture, such as the use of dropout and a different random initialization for each learner, and is explicitly regulated by our ensemble cooperation loss (Fig.¬†8, a, discussed later). Next, we present the results of an ablation study in Table¬†3. We first consider a naive baseline that averages the predictions of multiple independently-trained small continual learners, referred to as the ‚Äúclassifier ensemble (CE)‚Äù.\nHowever, such a naive baseline even underperforms the single continual learner (SCL). In contrast, the proposed feature ensemble (FE) of multiple small continual learners can naturally achieve a superior performance, where the ensemble cooperation loss (EC) and the task-adaptive gates (TG) bring obvious benefits by properly adjusting for functional diversity among learners and exploiting the additional information from task labels, respectively. Then we evaluate the effect of hyperparameters in Fig.¬†8. The hyperparameters of EC and TG are only moderately sensitive within a wide range. In this case, an appropriate (positive) strength of EC constrains the excessive diversity of predictions to improve the performance, while the continual learners will lose diversity if EC is too strong, resulting in a huge performance drop. If CoSCL cannot obtain sufficient diversity from the randomness of its architecture, the use of negative strength of EC can naturally serve this purpose, left for further work. Moreover, we empirically validate our theoretical analysis as below. We first evaluate the ‚Ñã‚Ñã\\mathcal{H}-divergence of feature representations between tasks, which relies on the capacity of a hypothesis space to distinguish them . Specifically, the ‚Ñã‚Ñã\\mathcal{H}-divergence can be empirically approximated by training a discriminator to distinguish if the features of input images belong to a task or not, where a larger discrimination loss indicates a smaller ‚Ñã‚Ñã\\mathcal{H}-divergence. As shown in Fig.¬†9, a, the proposed FE together with EC can largely decrease the ‚Ñã‚Ñã\\mathcal{H}-divergence while TG has a moderate benefit (there is a saturation effect when they are combined together).\nMeanwhile, we evaluate the curvature of loss landscape for the continually-learned solution by permuting the parameters to ten random directions 1, where the solution obtained by CoSCL enjoys a clearly flatter loss landscape than SCL (Fig.¬†9, b). Taking all results together, cooperating multiple small continual learners can mitigate the discrepancy between tasks in feature space and improve flatness of the continually-learned solution (Fig.¬†9), thus facilitating both FWT and BWT (Fig.¬†6). This is consistent with our theoretical analysis, suggesting that learning plasticity and memory stability are not necessarily conflicting in continual learning, but can be simultaneously enhanced by a well-designed model architecture. Adding Continual Learners is More Effective than Widening a Single Network:\nAll of the above experiments are performed under a fixed parameter budget. A recent work observed that a wider network usually suffers from less catastrophic forgetting , providing an initial exploration of the effects of architecture in continual learning. Here we argue that adding continual learners with CoSCL is a better choice. In Fig.¬†10 we compare the performance of using an increasing number of continual learners (the width is the same as that used in Table¬†1) and accordingly widening the network of a single continual learner (SCL). It can be clearly seen that the performance gap between CoSCL and SCL is growing when more parameters are used. Therefore, CoSCL presents a promising direction for continual learning that can leverage network parameters in an efficient and scalable way. Unsupervised Continual Learning (UCL): has the unique property of being naturally robust to catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning on incremental unlabeled data 6 . An empirical explanation is that UCL achieves a flatter loss landscape and more meaningful feature representations , which is consistent with our analysis. We further validate this idea by adapting CoSCL to UCL444Here we only use feature ensemble (FE) with ensemble cooperation loss (EC)., where we follow the UCL setting of  for CIFAR-100-RS and use a similar architecture as Table¬†1. As shown in Table¬†4, CoSCL can significantly improve the performance of UCL with two strong unsupervised learning strategies such as SimSiam  and BarlowTwins .\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: Tiny-ImageNet  is derived from iILSVRC-2012 , consisting of 200-class natural images of the size 64√ó64646464\\times 64.
