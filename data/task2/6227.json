      "content": "Paper Title: RLAD: Reinforcement Learning from Pixels for Autonomous Driving in Urban Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, Autonomous Driving  (AD)has experienced significant growth due to advancements in artificial intelligence and information sensing, which have received widespread attention in both academia and industry  . In general terms, AD involves tasks that fall into two main categories: environment perception and driving policy   [ref]5. First, the autonomous agent must derive a useful representation of the environment from sensor data, and then generate the appropriate control commands based on the driving policy in order to keep the vehicle on a safe route. Urban driving is one of the most challenging environments for autonomous vehicles, mainly due to the unpredictability and diversity of agents present in the environment, as well as complex situations, such as pedestrians crossing lanes, traffic lights, intersections, among others  . Given the multifaceted nature of urban driving, researchers have recognized the necessity of employing information fusion techniques to effectively perceive and comprehend data from various sources and of different natures [ref]5 . Consequently, there has been a notable shift in focus from traditional modular pipelines to end-to-end approaches, such as Imitation Learning  (IL)and Reinforcement Learning  (RL). Imitation Learning  (IL)learns a driving policy from a dataset of expert demonstrations using supervised learning techniques , in which the goal is to create an agent that behaves as similarly as possible to the expert. The major limitations of this method are that the driving policy is limited to the performance of the experts, and it is practically inconceivable to collect expert data covering all possible driving situations . IL algorithms also suffer from a distribution mismatch in the training data, i.e., the algorithm will never encounter failing situations, and therefore, will not react properly in those conditions . Conversely, Reinforcement Learning  (RL)learns a driving policy by interacting directly with an environment and collecting rewards that assess the suitability of an action taken in a given state 0. Usually, the goal of the agent is to maximize the cumulative rewards. As in this case the agent is interacting directly with the environment, it does not suffer from a distribution mismatch and is also not limited to the performance of an expert. However, due to the extensive exploration of the environment during the training stage, RL is known to have a poor sample efficiency, requiring an order of magnitude more data than IL to converge 0. Reinforcement Learning from Pixels  (RLfP)is a type of RL that directly maps the image data into actions. This requires simultaneously training a convolution encoder alongside a policy network, which is a challenging task due to the sample efficiency problem 1. Additionally, it is known that performing Temporal Differences  (TD)learning with a convolutional encoder leads to unstable training and premature convergence, which eventually results in degenerated feature representations 2. Existing RLfP approaches have been applied on Atari games 3 and MuJoCo 4 tasks, which present significantly fewer challenges in terms of environment perception when compared to AD. For instance, in Atari and MuJoCo, practically any change in the observation space is task-relevant, whereas in AD the observation space contains predominately task-irrelevant information, as is the case of clouds and architectural details 5. To bypass this problem, current RL approaches applied in urban AD focus on decoupling the perception training from the driving policy training 6 7  0  . The idea is to train an encoder using supervised or unsupervised techniques to derive a latent representation from the sensor data, and then train an RL algorithm that maps the latent representation into actions. This adds stability to the optimization by circumventing dueling training objectives. However, it leads to suboptimal policies because the encoder may not be aligned with the downstream task 8. Since the objective is to maximize the cumulative rewards, it is beneficial to use them to improve simultaneously the feature representation of the sensor data and the driving policy network 5. This paper proposes RLAD, a Reinforcement Learning from Pixels Autonomous Driving agent, capable of driving under complex urban environments. This is the first approach to carry out a successful simultaneous training of the encoder and policy network using RL in the domain of vision-based urban AD. We leverage the latest advancements in RLfP that have been achieved by Meta AI111https://ai.facebook.com/ and propose techniques to integrate those advancements in the urban AD domain. Overall, we summarize our main contributions as follows: We propose RLAD, the first method that learns simultaneously the encoder and the driving policy network using RL in the domain of vision-based urban AD. We also show that RLAD significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art RLfP methods in this domain; We introduce an image encoder that leverages both image augmentations and Adaptive Local Signal Mixing  (A-LIX)layers to minimize the catastrophic self-overfitting of the encoder; We propose WayConv1D, a waypoint encoder that leverages the 2D geometrical information of the waypoints using 1D convolutions with a 2×\\times2 kernel, which significantly improves the stability of the driving; We perform a comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art RLfP in the domain of vision-based urban AD, where we show that one of the main challenges is obeying traffic lights. To address this limitation, we incorporate an auxiliary loss that specifically targets the traffic light information in the latent representation of the image, thereby enhancing its significance.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: sensing, which have received widespread attention in both academia and industry  .
