      "content": "Paper Title: Don’t Watch Me: A Spatio-Temporal Trojan Attack on Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Augment Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBackdoors on DNN have been widely studied in the domain of supervised learning [ref]10 , where triggers can be an image patch, a physical accessory, or invisible noise. These backdoors can be applied to attack AV’s vision perception capacities. For example, several invisible triggers (style transfer based , residual maps based , warping based ) are applied to a traffic sign recognition benchmark (GTSRB [ref]30). These backdoors will lead to wrong recognition of traffic signs, and then produce wrong control commands. Our work focuses on DRL-based AD. While these experiences can be applied to DRL, DRL aims to solve sequential decision-making problems which are quite different from classification tasks. Currently, there are only few works that have studied backdoors on DRL. We compare these works in Table I.\nKiourti et al.[ref]13 specify image patterns as the trigger and train a DRL model which can output fixed or random actions or reward when the trigger is present.  is the only work that studied backdoor attacks on DRL-based AV controllers. The authors used a specific set of combinations of positions and speeds of vehicles in the observation as the trigger. When the trigger is present, the backdoored DRL model could generate malicious decelerations to cause a physical crash or traffic congestion. We call these two backdoors “instant backdoors”, similar to the one in supervised learning, because their triggers and actions do not involve sequential dependencies. Since the state space of many real-world environments including AD is partial observable, introducing RNN into DRL networks to capture temporal dependencies is an efficient solution to improve the performance and practicability of DRL. But, RNN can introduce new security threats to DRL. Similar to [ref]13, Yang et al. used image patches as the trigger, but they examined the persistent effect of backdoors on DRL equipped with LSTM by jointly training the backdoored model with a clean and a Trojan environment. Ashcraft et al. also studied backdoors on a network similar to the one in , but the trigger they used is a sequence of actions following a specific pattern, and their attacks are instant. Wang et al. studied backdoors on DRL controlled two-player competitive games. They also used a sequence of actions as the fast-failing trigger, trained two different policies (clean and poisoned), and hard-encoded them to generate the backdoored trajectories. Then, they used imitation learning to train a DNN model to mimic the behavior of generated trajectories. Our previous work  proposed a temporal-pattern backdoor attack on DRL, which uses the temporal constraints among a sequence of states (which are not controllable by the DRL agent) to encode its trigger. In this paper, we design a new backdoor attack on DRL by hiding triggers in spatio-temporal features, which are the key success factor of DRL-based AD systems, and train the backdoored model in the same environment, rather than two individual environments. Besides, different from existing backdoors, the attack duration after the trigger is present is controllable during the training process, which balances the low low poisoning rate of training buffers and high attack success rate.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Backdoors on DNN have been widely studied in the domain of supervised learning [ref]10 , where triggers can be an image patch, a physical accessory, or invisible noise.
