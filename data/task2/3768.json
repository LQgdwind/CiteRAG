      "content": "Paper Title: Local and global topological complexity measures of ReLU neural network functions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIt is well-known (e.g. ) that the class of functions F:ℝn→ℝ:𝐹→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} realizable by feedforward ReLU neural networks is precisely the class of finite piecewise linear (PL) functions (Definition 3.3). Less well-understood is how architecture impacts function complexity and how complexity evolves during training. That is, for a fixed architecture of fully-connected, feedforward ReLU neural network, how does the set of finite PL functions realizable by that architecture sit inside the set of all finite PL functions? Do the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent preference certain classes of finite PL functions over others? In order to tackle these questions in a systematic way, we need a good framework for characterizing the complexity of finite PL functions. In the present work, we draw on algebraic topology and a PL version of Morse theory to develop a new notion of complexity. The idea of using Betti numbers of sublevel sets as a measure of complexity for neural network functions was initiated in [ref]3. Recall that the Betti numbers of a topological space are the ranks of its homology groups (see e.g. 0), and they are invariants of the space up to homeomorphism (in fact, up to the weaker notion of homotopy equivalence, see Definition 4.2). In [ref]3 and, later, , the homological or topological complexity of a continuous function F:ℝn→ℝ:𝐹→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} was defined as the collection of Betti numbers of the (single) sublevel set F≤0:=F−1​(−∞,0].assignsubscript𝐹absent0superscript𝐹10F_{\\leq 0}:=F^{-1}(-\\infty,0]. In [ref]3, the authors explore how homological complexity grows with respect to depth and width for neural networks with polynomial and arctan\\arctan activation functions, and in , the authors use persistent homology, introduced by Zomorodian-Carlsson in 5, to perform an empirical study of the homological complexity of ReLU neural networks of varying architectures. We note that modern practitioners favor the ReLU activation function for supervised learning problems involving regression. Our study begins with the observation that another natural and complementary notion of complexity of a continuous function is the number of homeomorphism classes of its sublevel sets, For a smooth function F𝐹F, Morse theory provides a toolkit for not only computing algebro-topological invariants of the sublevel sets (e.g., their Betti numbers) but also understanding how they change as the threshold t=a𝑡𝑎t=a varies. Put simply, for a smooth function F:ℝn→ℝ:𝐹→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}, the homeomorphism class of a sublevel (or superlevel) set can only change across a critical point, where the gradient of F𝐹F vanishes. Moreover, generic smooth functions are Morse, which means that the critical points are isolated and admit a standard quadratic local model. These conditions yield\na straightforward description of how the topology of the sublevel set changes as the threshold crosses the critical value; the change is local, controlled, and relatively easy to describe. For PL functions ℝn→ℝ→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝ\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}, it is still natural to define a notion of complexity based on algebro-topological descriptions of homeomorphism classes of sublevel (or superlevel) sets. However, in contrast to the smooth setting, a generic finite PL function is not necessarily PL Morse (see Section 3); consequently, describing how the homological complexity of a sublevel set F≤asubscript𝐹absent𝑎F_{\\leq a} varies with a∈ℝ𝑎ℝa\\in\\mathbb{R} requires a more delicate analysis. Following ideas dating back to Banchoff , we focus our attention on the flat cells of a ReLU neural network map F:ℝn→ℝ:𝐹→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}. The canonical polyhedral complex 𝒞​(F)𝒞𝐹\\mathcal{C}(F) associated to a feedforward ReLU neural network map F:ℝn→ℝ:𝐹→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R} was introduced in ; informally, it is a decomposition of ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n} into convex polyhedra (cells) of varying dimension such that F𝐹F is affine-linear on each cell. The flat cells of F𝐹F are, by definition, the cells of 𝒞​(F)𝒞𝐹\\mathcal{C}(F) on which F𝐹F is constant. Flat cells in the PL category should be viewed as the appropriate analogues of critical points in the smooth category, with the caveat that not every flat cell is critical. Explicitly, we prove: Let F:ℝn→ℝ:𝐹→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} be a finite PL function, and let a≤b∈ℝ𝑎𝑏ℝa\\leq b\\in\\mathbb{R} be thresholds. If the polyhedral complex 𝒞​(F)F∈[a,b]𝒞subscript𝐹subscript𝐹absent𝑎𝑏\\mathcal{C}(F)_{F_{\\in[a,b]}} contains no flat cells, then the sublevel sets F≤asubscript𝐹absent𝑎F_{\\leq a} and F≤bsubscript𝐹absent𝑏F_{\\leq b} are homotopy equivalent, as are the superlevel sets F≥asubscript𝐹absent𝑎F_{\\geq a} and F≥bsubscript𝐹absent𝑏F_{\\geq b}. Here, 𝒞​(F)F∈[a,b]𝒞subscript𝐹subscript𝐹absent𝑎𝑏\\mathcal{C}(F)_{F_{\\in[a,b]}} is a level set complex (see §2 for the precise definition); it is, roughly speaking, the restriction of the complex 𝒞​(F)𝒞𝐹\\mathcal{C}(F) to the set F−1​([a,b])superscript𝐹1𝑎𝑏F^{-1}([a,b]).\nHomotopy equivalence is an equivalence relation on topological spaces that is weaker than homeomorphism but strong enough to imply the equality of all standard invariants coming from algebraic topology (cf. Section 4 and 0). Moreover, since a finite PL map has finitely many flat cells, an immediate consequence of Theorem 1 is that there are finitely many homotopy equivalence classes of sublevel sets – i.e. for a feedforward ReLU neural network function F𝐹F, we need only consider finitely many sublevel sets F≤asubscript𝐹absent𝑎F_{\\leq a}, a∈ℝ𝑎ℝa\\in\\mathbb{R}, to capture all of the topological complexity information associated to F𝐹F. To this end, we may first consider the sublevel sets F≤asubscript𝐹absent𝑎F_{\\leq a} (resp. superlevel sets F≥asubscript𝐹absent𝑎F_{\\geq a}) for very negative (resp. very positive) values of a∈ℝ𝑎ℝa\\in\\mathbb{R}.\nIndeed, if the images of all flat cells are contained in the compact interval [−M,M]𝑀𝑀[-M,M], then the homology of F≤asubscript𝐹absent𝑎F_{\\leq a} and F≤bsubscript𝐹absent𝑏F_{\\leq b} agree for all a,b<−M𝑎𝑏𝑀a,b<-M and the homology of F≥asubscript𝐹absent𝑎F_{\\geq a} and F≥bsubscript𝐹absent𝑏F_{\\geq b} agree for all a,b>M𝑎𝑏𝑀a,b>M. Consequently, a first (coarse) description of the topological topological complexity of F𝐹F is given by: the collection of Betti numbers of the set F≤asubscript𝐹absent𝑎F_{\\leq a} for any a<−M𝑎𝑀a<-M, which we call the stable sublevel homological complexity of F𝐹F, or stable sublevel H𝐻H–complexity for short, and the collection of Betti numbers of F≥asubscript𝐹absent𝑎F_{\\geq a} for any a>M𝑎𝑀a>M, which we call the stable superlevel H𝐻H–complexity of F𝐹F. Next, we may investigate how the sublevel sets F≤tsubscript𝐹absent𝑡F_{\\leq t} (and superlevel sets F≥tsubscript𝐹absent𝑡F_{\\geq t}) change as we vary t∈[−M,M]𝑡𝑀𝑀t\\in[-M,M]. In analogy to the smooth setting, our preference would be to apply PL Morse theory (as developed in ) to the class of finite PL maps realized by ReLU neural network functions, but we quickly see that ReLU neural network functions have a nonzero probability of being non PL Morse (Definition 3.5): Let F:ℝn→ℝ:𝐹→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} be a ReLU neural network map with hidden layers of dimensions (n1,…,nℓ)subscript𝑛1…subscript𝑛ℓ(n_{1},\\ldots,n_{\\ell}). The probability that F𝐹F is PL Morse is We remark that the expression (1) above for the probability is Additionally, note that for architectures whose hidden layers all have the same dimension (a common choice), the upper bound given by Theorem 2 is significantly lower for deep networks than for shallow networks of the same total dimension. For ReLU neural networks with >1absent1>1 hidden layer, we expect the true probability that F𝐹F is PL Morse to be much lower than the given upper bound. Thus, in order to measure how the sublevel sets F≤tsubscript𝐹absent𝑡F_{\\leq t} change as we vary the threshold t𝑡t, we need to do more work. Following [ref]7, we associate to each (connected component of)111Flat cells of PL maps need not be isolated. flat cell(s) K𝐾K at level t𝑡t its local homological complexity (or local H𝐻H–complexity for short), which we define to be the rank of the relative homology of the pair (F≤t,F≤t∖K)subscript𝐹absent𝑡subscript𝐹absent𝑡𝐾(F_{\\leq t},F_{\\leq t}\\setminus K). (Readers unfamiliar with relative homology may informally view the local H𝐻H–complexity of K𝐾K as the (total rank of the) homology of the quotient space obtained by collapsing everything in F≤tsubscript𝐹absent𝑡F_{\\leq t} outside of a neighborhood of K𝐾K to a point; for more detail see 0.) We may then define the total H𝐻H–complexity of a finite PL map to be the sum of all the local H𝐻H–complexities. It is noted in [ref]7 that PL Morse regular points have local H𝐻H–complexity 00 and PL Morse nondegenerate-critical points have local H𝐻H–complexity 111. To prove Theorem 1 we draw heavily upon Grunert’s work in , where he proves an analogous result for bounded polyhedral complexes, aka polytopal complexes. We apply results in convex geometry and combinatorics (cf. 2) to construct,\nfor every ReLU neural network map F:ℝn→ℝ:𝐹→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} with canonical polyhedral complex 𝒞​(F)𝒞𝐹\\mathcal{C}(F), a canonical polytopal complex, 𝒦​(F)𝒦𝐹\\mathcal{K}(F), and a homotopy equivalence |𝒞​(F)|∼|𝒦​(F)|similar-to𝒞𝐹𝒦𝐹|\\mathcal{C}(F)|\\sim|\\mathcal{K}(F)| (we use |⋅||\\cdot| to denote the underlying set of a polyhedral complex) that respects the finite PL map F𝐹F: Let 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} be a polyhedral complex in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}, let F:|𝒞|→ℝ:𝐹→𝒞ℝF:|\\mathcal{C}|\\to\\mathbb{R} be linear on cells of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}, and assume |𝒞F∈[a,b]|⊆|𝒞|subscript𝒞𝐹𝑎𝑏𝒞|\\mathcal{C}_{F\\in[a,b]}|\\subseteq|\\mathcal{C}| contains no flat cells. Then there exists a polytopal complex 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} with |𝒟|⊂|𝒞|𝒟𝒞|\\mathcal{D}|\\subset|\\mathcal{C}| and a strong deformation retraction Φ:|𝒞|→|𝒟|:Φ→𝒞𝒟\\Phi:|\\mathcal{C}|\\to|\\mathcal{D}| (which induces a cellular map 𝒞→𝒟→𝒞𝒟\\mathcal{C}\\to\\mathcal{D}) such that\nΦΦ\\Phi is F𝐹F-level preserving on |𝒞F∈[a,b]|subscript𝒞𝐹𝑎𝑏|\\mathcal{C}_{F\\in[a,b]}| and for every c∈[a,b]𝑐𝑎𝑏c\\in[a,b], Furthermore, there is an F𝐹F-level preserving PL isotopy Combined with results of Grunert () for polytopal complexes, this immediately implies: Let 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} be a polyhedral complex in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}, let F:|𝒞|→ℝ:𝐹→𝒞ℝF:|\\mathcal{C}|\\to\\mathbb{R} be linear on cells of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}, and assume |𝒞F∈[a,b]|⊆|𝒞|subscript𝒞𝐹𝑎𝑏𝒞|\\mathcal{C}_{F\\in[a,b]}|\\subseteq|\\mathcal{C}| contain no flat cells. Then for any threshold c∈[a,b]𝑐𝑎𝑏c\\in[a,b], |𝒞F≤c|subscript𝒞𝐹𝑐|\\mathcal{C}_{F\\leq c}| is homotopy equivalent to |𝒞F≤a|subscript𝒞𝐹𝑎|\\mathcal{C}_{F\\leq a}|; also |𝒞F≥c|subscript𝒞𝐹𝑐|\\mathcal{C}_{F\\geq c}| is homotopy equivalent to |𝒞F≥b|subscript𝒞𝐹𝑏|\\mathcal{C}_{F\\geq b}|. Because polytopal complexes admit finite simplicial subdivisions and there exist finite time algorithms for computing homology for finite simplicial complexes, Theorems 3 and 4 together have the following important practical consequence, which we state informally: For every flavor of H𝐻H–complexity described in this paper and every finite PL map F:ℝn→ℝ:𝐹→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}, there exists a finite time algorithm for computing the H𝐻H–complexity of F𝐹F. After establishing these foundational preliminaries, we turn our attention to bounds, computations, and examples. In Section 6 we provide a useful combinatorial characterization of the local complexity of flat cells in shallow (i.e., depth 222) ReLU neural networks in terms of the ∇F∇𝐹\\nabla F orientation on the 111–complex of 𝒞​(F)𝒞𝐹\\mathcal{C}(F). In Section 7, we introduce the stable sublevel and superlevel H𝐻H–complexities as well as the coarse bounded sublevel and superlevel H𝐻H–complexities of a finite PL function F:ℝn→ℝ:𝐹→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}. These are significantly less computationally expensive than total H𝐻H–complexity but provide a reasonable measure of topological complexity in their own right. We also establish the following weak but computationally inexpensive lower bounds for coarse H𝐻H–complexity: Let F:ℝn→ℝ:𝐹→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} be a finite PL function for which the images of the flat cells are contained in the interval [−M,M]𝑀𝑀[-M,M]. Let n±subscript𝑛plus-or-minusn_{\\pm} denote the number of connected components of F≤±Msubscript𝐹absentplus-or-minus𝑀F_{\\leq\\pm M} and let n±superscript𝑛plus-or-minusn^{\\pm} denote the number of connected components of F≥±Msubscript𝐹absentplus-or-minus𝑀F_{\\geq\\pm M}. We have the following lower bounds: |n−−n+|subscript𝑛subscript𝑛|n_{-}-n_{+}| is a lower bound for the coarse bounded sublevel H𝐻H–complexity |n+−n−|superscript𝑛superscript𝑛|n^{+}-n^{-}| is a lower bound for the coarse bounded superlevel H𝐻H–complexity We close, in Section 8, by presenting a construction proving that local H𝐻H–complexity of a ReLU neural network function can be arbitrarily large.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: and a PL version of Morse theory to develop a new notion of complexity.
