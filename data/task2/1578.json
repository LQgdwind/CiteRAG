Given a list of axioms A1,…,Alsubscript𝐴1…subscript𝐴𝑙A_{1},\\ldots,A_{l} and a conjecture G𝐺G to prove,\nan ATP translates {A1,…,Al,¬G}subscript𝐴1…subscript𝐴𝑙𝐺\\{A_{1},\\ldots,A_{l},\\neg G\\} into an equisatisfiable\nset of initial clauses 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}.\nIt then tries to derive a contradiction ⊥bottom\\bot from 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} (thus showing that A1,…,Al⊧Gmodelssubscript𝐴1…subscript𝐴𝑙𝐺A_{1},\\ldots,A_{l}\\models G)\nusing a logical calculus, such as resolution or superposition  [ref]26.\nThe employed process of iteratively deriving (according to the inference rules of the calculus) new clauses, logical consequences of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C},\nis referred to as saturation and is typically implemented using some variant of\na given-clause algorithm : in each iteration, a single clause C𝐶C is selected and\ninferences are performed between C𝐶C and all previously selected clauses.\nDeciding which clause to select next is known to be a key heuristical choice point,\nhugely affecting the performance of an ATP . The idea to improve clause selection by learning from past prover experience goes (to the best of our knowledge) back to Schulz  \nand has more recently been successfully employed by the ENIGMA system\n   [ref]18\nand variations   .\nExperience is collected from successful prover runs, where each selected clause constitutes a training example and the example is marked as positive\nif the clause ended up in the discovered proof, and negative otherwise.\nA machine learning (ML) algorithm is then used to fit this data and produce a model ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}\nfor classifying clauses into positive and negative, accordingly.\nA good learning algorithm produces a model ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} which accurately\nclassifies the training data but also generalizes well to unseen examples;\nideally, of course, with a low computational cost of both (1) training and (2) evaluation. When a model is prepared, we need to integrate its advice back to the prover’s\nclause selection process. An ATP typically organizes this process by maintaining\na set of priority queues, each ordering the yet-to-be-processed clauses by a certain criterion,\nand alternates—under a certain configurable ratio—between selecting the best clause from each queue.\nOne way of integrating the learnt advice, adopted by ENIGMA, is to add another queue Qℳsubscript𝑄ℳQ_{\\mathcal{M}}\nin which clauses are ordered such that those positively classified by ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}\nprecede the negatively classified ones, and extend the mentioned ratio such\nthat Qℳsubscript𝑄ℳQ_{\\mathcal{M}} is used for, e.g., half of the selections (while the remaining ones fall back to the original strategy). In this work, we rely instead on the layered clause selection paradigm   8,\nin which a clause selection mechanism inherited from an underlying strategy is applied\nseparately to the set A𝐴A of clauses classified as positive by ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} and to the set B𝐵B of all\nyet-to-be-processed clauses (i.e., A⊆B𝐴𝐵A\\subseteq B).\nA “second level” ratio then dictates how often will the prover relay to select from either of these two sets.\nFor example, with a second-level ratio 2:1, the prover will select twice from A𝐴A\n(unless A𝐴A is currently empty and a fallback to B𝐵B happens)\nbefore selecting once from B𝐵B. An advantage of this approach is that the original,\ntypically well-tuned, selection mechanism is still applied within both A𝐴A and B𝐵B.111\nWe compared and empirically evaluated various modes of integrating the model advice\ninto the clause selection process in our previous work 7.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: Modern automatic theorem provers (ATPs) for first-order logic\nsuch as E , SPASS , or Vampire [ref]23\nare one of the most mature tools for general reasoning in a variety of domains.\nIn a nutshell, they work in the following way.
