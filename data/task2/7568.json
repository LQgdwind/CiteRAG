      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Graphs via Hierarchical Semantic Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph-structured data is ubiquitous in real-world applications, from social networks to biological networks and chemical molecules    .\nOne notable advancement in this area is the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNN-based models have pioneered end-to-end learning strategies to extract valuable information from graphs and have demonstrated remarkable success across various applications   .\nHowever, the success of GNNs encounters challenges in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios primarily due to the intricate nature of graph distribution shifts   . Graph data, characterized by nodes, edges, and potential attributes, poses additional challenges compared to other domains such as natural language processing (NLP) or computer vision (CV).\nUnlike those domains where context is often provided by sentences, paragraphs, or spatial information in images   6, graph lacks a built-in contextual framework, making it inherently challenging to discern the relevance and context of individual graph elements in OOD scenarios 9 . Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) [ref]2 is a widely used strategy in the Euclidean domain, relying on the assumption that training data is sourced from distinct environments with varied data distributions. Motivated by the success of invariant learning in the Euclidean domain [ref]2    7 [ref]29 1 2, invariant learning methods for non-Euclidean graphs 3    0  0 extend the concept to address the unique challenges posed by graph-structured data.\nDespite commendable progress in addressing OOD scenarios within the graph domain, existing studies have predominantly adhered to the assumption of a flat environmental situation  3.\nFor example, in the DrugOOD dataset, there are nearly 7000 diverse training environments in ic50-sca subset, including a wide variety of distinct substructures.\nFig. 1 illustrates three existing approaches to acquire environments when performing invariant learning on this data: “Real” means directly utilizing provided environments , “Rand#2” means randomly splitting samples into two environments  [ref]2, and “Infer#2” means inferring samples into two environments  7.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, all existing approaches exhibit poor or comparable performance to empirical risk minimization (ERM), which is consistent with the findings of Yang 3.\nThese phenomena indicate the shortcomings of flat environments:\n(1) Limited consideration of local environment similarity degrades performance in numerous environments (e.g., ‘Real’ case in Fig. 1)\n(2) Inferring from a small number of environments may fail to capture global environment similarities and interrelationships. (e.g., ‘Infer#2’ case in Fig. 1 ) Considering that graphs exhibit a hierarchical structure, with semantic information organized across various levels. This inherent hierarchy is fundamental to understanding structures and properties within graphs 4. In addition, inspired by the recent works [ref]29 7 , which show that the diversity of environments is recognized as the key to effectively\nhandling graph OOD scenarios\n, we aim to bridge the gap of flat environments while leveraging the inherent hierarchy of graphs. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical approach to generate semantic environments of each graph for effective graph invariant learning.\nInitially, we extract variant subgraphs from the input graph, enabling the generation of proxy predictions on local environments. Employing stochastic attention mechanisms, we iteratively re-extract subgraphs, building global environments hierarchically.\nTo guide the robustness of hierarchical environment inference,\nwe introduce a hierarchical environment diversification loss which encourages our model to diversify environments within the same hierarchy while maintaining consistency across different hierarchical levels. This approach not only aids our model in considering relationships between environments but also strengthens graph invariant learning robustness.\nBy modeling relationships between different environments within a hierarchical framework, our approach acquires the rich source of environmental information embedded in the hierarchical structure of graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach to graph OOD classification datasets. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose a hierarchical approach to generate semantic environments for effective graph invariant learning. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method is the first attempt to generate the environments in a hierarchical way in graph OOD generalization. We introduce a new learning objective that guides our model to learn the diversity of environments within the same hierarchy while maintaining consistency across different hierarchies. Extensive experiments have demonstrated our model yields significant improvements over various domains. In molecule graph benchmarks DrugOOD, our method achieves up to 1.29% and 2.83% higher ROC-AUC compared to SOTA graph invariant learning approaches.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: graph lacks a built-in contextual framework, making it inherently challenging to discern the relevance and context of individual graph elements in OOD scenarios 9 .
