      "content": "Paper Title: Detailed saliency maps generation using model-agnostic methods\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe class of explainability methods characteristic to the domain of Computer Vision are gradient-based methods. The most basic of which, and also the earliest, is a method proposed by Simonyan et al. [ref]12. The intuition behind it assumes that when error information for a specific class is backpropagated through the network, the resulting input map will show which inputs would have to change the least in order to affect the confidence score the most, implying that these inputs are the most relevant to the explained class.\nSaliency maps produced by this method were distinctively noisy and a set of proposed refinements followed. SmoothGrad [ref]13 showed that averaging of saliency maps generated for several copies of the input image, each copy combined with random noise, actually increases the clarity of resulting map. Guided Backpropagation  produced high-resolution maps which reflected parts - usually edges - of the explained object instance. It altered the approach of original backprop by propagating only through positively-valued connections and positively activated neurons. This approach was later shown to have unintended side-effects by , which we will discuss later. Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP) , while based on the principle of backpropagation, propagates the confidence score - instead of gradient - back through the network, using neuron activations and weights of connections between layers to trace paths leading to the most relevant inputs. All of these methods rely on access to the internal state of the model - such as gradient information, layer activations and connection weights - and hence they belong to the group of model-specific or white-box methods. These techniques usually offer very good performance , making them suitable for use in real-time applications . However, they are difficult to assess in a quantitative manner and are vulnerable to adversarially modified input . Another noteworthy technique is the Class Activation Map , which could be considered an example of explainable architectures - models designed to provide both predictions and their explanations (e.g. SENN ). This particular solution is not an explainable architecture in itself but rather a \"conversion kit\" which inserts an additional fully-connected layer right after the last convolutional layer of the target model.\nThis additional layer performs avg-pooling of final feature maps, and connects to the output layer. After retraining, these connection weights reflect the relevance of each feature map to each recognized class. To obtain a saliency map, feature maps are weighted by values of connection between their corresponding output of the CAM layer and the network’s output for explained class. This technique is rather unwieldy since it not only requires retraining of the explained network but also needs to be manually adapted to each model architecture. It was quickly superseded by GradCAM , which combines feature maps with gradient information to achieve similar results without the added inconvenience of rewiring the model. Our target class of solutions are perturbation-based, black-box techniques, the first of which, referred to simply as \"Occlusions\"  was proposed in 2013 and builds explanations by moving a rectangular occlusion across an image and analysing its influence on confidence score of the explained class.\nIf the score decreases when a particular region is occluded - that region must be salient. This logic is the basis of all perturbation-based approaches to explanations of Convolutional Neural Networks.\nBecause these techniques do not access the internal state of the model, they belong to the class of model-agnostic methods.\nOther examples of perturbation-based methods are: RISE  - samples the input with random occlusion grids. As of 2020, it is state-of-the-art within the group of perturbation-based methods . This method is the primary focus of our work and will be described in more detail later on. GLAS  - inspired by RISE, samples the input with Gaussian kernels laid out on a grid. Authors also propose a recursive variant which gradually excludes salient areas from the image, allowing the process to identify secondary areas of importance. The latter approach is particularly useful for images featuring multiple instances of a single class, where a single prominent instance may \"monopolize\" the map. Extremal Perturbations  - using an iterative optimization process designed to maximize the reduction of confidence score with the smallest occlusion possible. Since this approach is very similar to an adversarial attack, a regularisation term is used to avoid meaningless, pixel-space perturbations. LIME [ref]4 - although not developed with Computer Vision in mind, LIME is a model-agnostic method and can be applied to models in this domain. When operating on image data, it uses occlusion of super-pixels to generate perturbed examples. Currently, LIME is one of the most popular general-purpose XAI methods, along with SHAP . D-RISE  - an extension of RISE dedicated to object detection models. The approach to input sampling remains unchanged, although the approach to weighting samples has been adjusted to accommodate differences in model output format, such as multiple predictions of varying confidence for each recognized class. Though conceptually simple, and easily applicable to a wide range of models [ref]4 , these methods tend to be computationally intensive and slow compared to gradient-based approaches. Gathering a suitable sample may require evaluation of hundreds or thousands of perturbed images, depending on the algorithm and its configuration.\nIn case of RISE, 300 samples are usually enough to obtain a well-converged map from a coarse grid, but when a fine-grained grid is used, thousands or even tens of thousands of evaluations may be necessary to get a reliable and noiseless result.\nHowever, in case of algorithms which do not optimize perturbations to a particular class - such as Occlusions, RISE or non-recursive GLAS - this disadvantage can be offset in some scenarios by their capability to simultaneously generate maps for all recognizable classes.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: The class of explainability methods characteristic to the domain of Computer Vision are gradient-based methods.
