      "content": "Paper Title: Rotation Synchronization via Deep Matrix Factorization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecall that Z^^ùëç\\widehat{Z} represents the input to rotation synchronization whereas XùëãX represents the desired output.\nOur objective here is to recover ZùëçZ from Z^^ùëç\\widehat{Z}, or, in other terms, at the same time denoising relative rotations and completing missing ones. Indeed, once ZùëçZ is known,\nthe sought absolute rotations XùëãX can be straightforwardly recovered from the eigendecomposition of ZùëçZ [ref]1.\nIn other words, rotation synchronization can be viewed as a matrix completion problem  . In general, matrix completion deals with the recovery of missing values of a matrix from a subset of its entries. In this case, the task is to find WùëäW such that where ‚äôdirect-product\\odot denotes the entry-wise product and Œ©Œ©\\Omega denotes the corresponding binary mask having zeros in correspondence of missing entries222Observe that Œ©Œ©\\Omega has a block structure in the rotation synchronization problem: each missing rotation/pair results in a 3√ó3333\\times 3 zero block.. Œ©Œ©\\Omega is also known as the sampling set in matrix completion literature .\nProblem (6) means that we are looking for a full matrix WùëäW that is as close as possible to the input partial matrix Z^^ùëç\\widehat{Z} on the set of available entries.\nSuch a task is clearly ill-posed, as there are infinitely-many solutions. In order to make the problem tractable, additional assumptions are typically introduced. A popular choice is the low-rank assumption  , meaning that WùëäW is supposed to belong to a low-dimensional subspace. Note that such condition is satisfied in rotation synchronization, as observed in Sec.¬†III-A. Matrix completion is a highly researched topic comprising several solvers (e.g.,    ) that work well for a variety of applications, the most prominent one being recommender systems (see the survey [ref]31 for additional references). Most of the solutions typically enforce the low-rank assumption via explicit constraints such as the nuclear norm regularization .\nAnother possibility is to adopt implicit regularization, as done in  .\nIn particular, in  the unknown matrix WùëäW is expressed as the product of several factors: and the following problem is addressed where ||‚ãÖ||F||\\cdot||_{F} denotes the Frobenius norm and |Œ©|Œ©|\\Omega| denotes the cardinality of the sampling set, i.e., the number of available entries.\nEquation (7) is also called deep matrix factorization and the number of factors dùëëd is called depth. It was observed in  that in practice, even when the rank is unconstrained, performing gradient descent on a matrix factorization tends to produce low-rank solutions, i.e., the gradient descent algorithm has implicit regularization properties. Moreover, increasing depth leads to a more accurate completion when the number of missing entries is high. In particular, the authors of  noted that ‚Äúadding depth to the matrix factorization leads to more significant gaps between the singular values of the product matrix, i.e., to a stronger implicit bias towards low rank‚Äù. In this paper we adopt the deep matrix factorization formulation from  and we apply it ‚Äì for the first time ‚Äì to the rotation synchronization problem. Such a framework is suitable for our task, as it involves a low-rank matrix with missing data, as already observed. However, a practical method has to deal also with wrong measures, i.e., outliers.\nTo this end, we substitute the ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2}-norm typically used for deep matrix factorization ‚Äì see (8) ‚Äì with the ‚Ñì1subscript‚Ñì1\\ell_{1}-loss, motivated by the fact that the latter is more robust to outliers than the former. Thus we consider the following optimization problem: where ||‚ãÖ||1,1||\\cdot||_{1,1} is the entry-wise ‚Ñì1subscript‚Ñì1\\ell_{1} norm (in the same way as Frobenius is the entry-wise ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2} norm).\nFollowing , we cast the above problem\nas training a linear neural network with dùëëd layers. See the next section for more details. Please note that the matrix completion problem is not solved in the forward phase, as one might expect. In fact, it is the backward phase that is equivalent to minimizing the cost function of matrix completion with factorization, as will be clarified later.\nSolving Problem (9) will produce an optimal W=Wd‚ãÖWd‚àí1‚Äã‚Ä¶‚ÄãW2‚ãÖW1ùëä‚ãÖ‚ãÖsubscriptùëäùëësubscriptùëäùëë1‚Ä¶subscriptùëä2subscriptùëä1W=W_{d}\\cdot W_{d-1}\\dots W_{2}\\cdot W_{1}, which represents a denoised and complete version of the input Z^^ùëç\\widehat{Z}, or, equivalently, an approximation of the ground-truth ZùëçZ. Then, in order to recover the sought absolute rotations, we apply eigendecomposition to the optimal WùëäW, as explained in [ref]1.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: same time denoising relative rotations and completing missing ones.
