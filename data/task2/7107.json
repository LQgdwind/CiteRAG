      "content": "Paper Title: Weighted Automata and Logics Meet Computational Complexity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWeighted automata theory       , origins of which go back to the seminal article of M.-P. Schützenberger , encompasses\nthe study of quantitative generalisations of automata and related formalisms such as grammars    and systems of equations  , rational expressions  , and MSO logics  [ref]19.\nA weight taken from some structure – most typically a semiring – is assigned to each transition of a weighted automaton, so that these automata no longer describe formal languages;\ninstead, they realise functions mapping words over some alphabet to elements of the underlying semiring. After identifying the most natural algebra for such functions, one usually interprets\nthem as formal power series in several noncommutative variables      , also called weighted languages  . Among the objects of study of weighted automata theory, weighted finite automata and the corresponding class of rational series are undoubtedly the best understood .\nNevertheless, a great deal of research has also focused on weighted generalisations of models that are not expressive equivalents of finite automata: for instance, there are now well-developed theories of weighted counterparts to context-free languages  ,\none-counter languages , or Lindenmayer systems . On the other hand, weighted Turing machines received comparably little attention. These were introduced as “algebraic Turing machines”\nby C. Damm, M. Holzer, and P. McKenzie , who also discovered many of the applications of such machines to computational complexity surveyed in this article.\nHowever, the authors used this model mainly as an auxiliary tool for studying complexity aspects of evaluating tensor formulae over various semirings, and they did not make a natural connexion to weighted automata theory explicit.\nTheir work thus remained essentially unnoticed by the weighted automata community. To the author’s best knowledge, an explicit study of weighted Turing machines over structures incorporating at least all semirings only appeared in ,\nwhere several variants of such machines over strong bimonoids111The theory of weighted finite automata over strong bimonoids is a well-understood generalisation of their usual theory over semirings  ; strong bimonoids are essentially semirings without distributivity. were considered.\nThere also is a mention of weighted Turing machines in ; however, these are understood there on a more-or-less informal level\nand in a much broader sense. Finally, a class of so-called “semiring Turing machines” similar to weighted Turing machines was recently introduced in  . This article can be seen as an attempt to convey the significance of weighted Turing machines, defined by analogy to weighted automata, for\na substantial part of computational complexity theory. As decision problems are captured by languages, the usual complexity classes of decision problems – such as 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P}, 𝐍𝐏𝐍𝐏\\mathbf{NP}, 𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄\\mathbf{PSPACE}, or 𝐄𝐗𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄𝐄𝐗𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄\\mathbf{EXPTIME} – are\nactually classes of languages. On the other hand, counting or optimisation problems no longer correspond to languages, but to their quantitative extensions.\nApplying an approach standard in weighted automata theory, these problems can be regarded as formal power series. The classes such as #​𝐏#𝐏\\#\\mathbf{P} or 𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐏𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐏\\mathbf{OptP}\ncan thus be seen as weighted – or quantitative – complexity classes of noncommutative formal power series. The key observation to be highlighted in this article is that many of such quantitative complexity classes, commonly studied in computational complexity theory, can in fact be naturally characterised by weighted Turing machines\nover a suitable semiring. For instance, one may consider a complexity class 𝐍𝐏​[S]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{NP}[S] consisting of all power series realised by polynomial-time\nweighted Turing machines over a semiring S𝑆S. As usual, setting S𝑆S to the Boolean semiring corresponds to disregarding weights – that is, 𝐍𝐏​[S]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{NP}[S] becomes just 𝐍𝐏𝐍𝐏\\mathbf{NP} for S=𝔹𝑆𝔹S=\\mathbb{B}.\nOn the other hand, the semiring of natural numbers ℕℕ\\mathbb{N} typically takes the role of counting;\nit is thus not surprising that the class 𝐍𝐏​[ℕ]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]ℕ\\mathbf{NP}[\\mathbb{N}] coincides with the counting complexity class #​𝐏#𝐏\\#\\mathbf{P}     .\nThis example, which can be seen as a leading source of inspiration for studying the classes 𝐍𝐏​[S]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{NP}[S],\nwas actually already observed – and presented in their terminology of algebraic Turing machines – by C. Damm, M. Holzer, and P. McKenzie . Moreover, several other examples of semirings S𝑆S, for which 𝐍𝐏​[S]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{NP}[S] corresponds to a known complexity class, were identified in  as well:\nover the finite field 𝔽2=ℤ/2​ℤsubscript𝔽2ℤ2ℤ\\mathbb{F}_{2}=\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}, the “parity-𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P}” class ⊕𝐏direct-sum𝐏\\oplus\\mathbf{P}  is represented by 𝐍𝐏​[𝔽2]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]subscript𝔽2\\mathbf{NP}[\\mathbb{F}_{2}];\nsimilarly, the class of supports of series from 𝐍𝐏​[ℤ/k​ℤ]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]ℤ𝑘ℤ\\mathbf{NP}[\\mathbb{Z}/k\\mathbb{Z}], for a natural number k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2, corresponds to 𝐌𝐎𝐃𝐤​𝐏subscript𝐌𝐎𝐃𝐤𝐏\\mathbf{MOD_{k}P}  ,\nand the class 𝐍𝐏​[ℤ]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]ℤ\\mathbf{NP}[\\mathbb{Z}] can be seen as 𝐆𝐚𝐩𝐏𝐆𝐚𝐩𝐏\\mathbf{GapP}   . This list is extended in this article by a few less straightforward examples: we observe that the class of optimisation problems 𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐏​[O​(log⁡n)]𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐏delimited-[]𝑂𝑛\\mathbf{OptP}[O(\\log n)] 8\ncan be captured by 𝐍𝐏​[ℕmax]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]subscriptℕmax\\mathbf{NP}[\\mathbb{N}_{\\operatorname*{max}}], where ℕmaxsubscriptℕmax\\mathbb{N}_{\\operatorname*{max}} is the max-plus semiring of natural numbers; moreover, the class 𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐏𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐏\\mathbf{OptP} 8\ncan also be modelled as 𝐍𝐏​[Smax]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]subscript𝑆max\\mathbf{NP}[S_{\\operatorname*{max}}] for Smaxsubscript𝑆maxS_{\\operatorname*{max}} being a suitable “max-plus semiring of binary words”.\nFurthermore, over semirings of finite languages 2𝑓𝑖𝑛Σ∗subscriptsuperscript2superscriptΣ𝑓𝑖𝑛2^{\\Sigma^{*}}_{\\mathit{fin}}, the classes 𝐍𝐏​[2𝑓𝑖𝑛Σ∗]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]subscriptsuperscript2superscriptΣ𝑓𝑖𝑛\\mathbf{NP}[2^{\\Sigma^{*}}_{\\mathit{fin}}] relate to the complexity class of multivalued functions 𝐍𝐏𝐌𝐕𝐍𝐏𝐌𝐕\\mathbf{NPMV} ,\nand the class of all fuzzy languages realisable by polynomial-time fuzzy Turing machines, understood in the sense of  (see also  for more on this model and 8 for a first mention of fuzzy algorithms),\ncan also be viewed as 𝐍𝐏​[F∗]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]subscript𝐹\\mathbf{NP}[F_{*}] for a suitable semiring F∗subscript𝐹F_{*} depending on the triangular norm ∗* considered. Existence of a problem complete for 𝐍𝐏​[S]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{NP}[S] when S𝑆S is finitely generated as an additive monoid was also essentially established in  and the subsequent article by M. Beaudry and M. Holzer  –\nit was proved there that the evaluation problem for scalar tensor formulae over S𝑆S has this property.\nIn this article, we gain some more insight into the concept of 𝐍𝐏​[S]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{NP}[S]-completeness by showing that in fact already the Cook-Levin theorem 3 generalises to the weighted setting:\na suitably defined “satisfiability” problem for weighted propositional logics, 𝖲𝖠𝖳​[S]𝖲𝖠𝖳delimited-[]𝑆\\mathsf{SAT}[S], is 𝐍𝐏​[S]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{NP}[S]-complete with respect to polynomial-time many-one reductions whenever the semiring S𝑆S is finitely generated (in the usual algebraic sense, i.e., as a semiring).\nHere, the weighted propositional logics are precisely the propositional fragments of the weighted MSO logics of M. Droste and P. Gastin  [ref]19.\nIn addition, we identify one more artificial 𝐍𝐏​[S]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{NP}[S]-complete problem for every finitely generated semiring S𝑆S, inspired by the 𝖳𝖬𝖲𝖠𝖳𝖳𝖬𝖲𝖠𝖳\\mathsf{TMSAT} problem of S. Arora and B. Barak ;\nthis problem involving weighted Turing machines can be proved to be 𝐍𝐏​[S]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{NP}[S]-complete quite readily, but otherwise is of limited use.\nFinally, we observe that 𝐍𝐏​[S]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{NP}[S]-complete problems with respect to polynomial-time many-one reductions do not exist when S𝑆S is not finitely generated. In addition to the class 𝐍𝐏​[S]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{NP}[S], we also introduce its “deterministic counterpart” 𝐅𝐏​[S]𝐅𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{FP}[S]; this class of semiring-valued functions generalises both\n𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P} and the class 𝐅𝐏𝐅𝐏\\mathbf{FP}, which relates to #​𝐏#𝐏\\#\\mathbf{P} similarly as 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P} does to 𝐍𝐏𝐍𝐏\\mathbf{NP} .\nQuite naturally, 𝐅𝐏​[S]⊆𝐍𝐏​[S]𝐅𝐏delimited-[]𝑆𝐍𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{FP}[S]\\subseteq\\mathbf{NP}[S] holds for all semirings S𝑆S; we also observe that there is a semiring, for which this inclusion is provably strict.\nWe finally gather some basic observations concerning the role of the semiring S𝑆S when it comes to the relation of the classes 𝐅𝐏​[S]𝐅𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{FP}[S] and 𝐍𝐏​[S]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{NP}[S]:\nwe prove that when T𝑇T is a factor semiring of S𝑆S, then 𝐅𝐏​[S]=𝐍𝐏​[S]𝐅𝐏delimited-[]𝑆𝐍𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{FP}[S]=\\mathbf{NP}[S] implies 𝐅𝐏​[T]=𝐍𝐏​[T]𝐅𝐏delimited-[]𝑇𝐍𝐏delimited-[]𝑇\\mathbf{FP}[T]=\\mathbf{NP}[T]. The original among the results presented in this survey are based on an unpublished work of the author from 2019. Meanwhile, some similar results were also obtained\nby T. Eiter and R. Kiesel   in their related framework of semiring Turing machines. The author believes that a consistent study of weighted complexity classes and related concepts, suggested by this article, can be worthwhile for at least the following three reasons: Traditionally, weighted automata theory has mostly dealt with what S. Eilenberg  aptly described as rational and algebraic phenomena – or with their further specialisations.\nSolid generalisations to the weighted setting have thus been obtained over the years for the classical theories of rational and context-free languages, corresponding to the two lowermost levels of the Chomsky hierarchy.\nThe study of weighted computational complexity might help to understand how the principal concepts of weighted automata theory relate to classes of languages beyond these two levels, usually studied within the theory of computation.\nIt should become clearer that virtually all of the main concepts covered in a typical first course on formal languages and automata theory such as 2 – including the theory of computation – can not only be consistently generalised to the weighted setting, but these\ngeneralisations are actually meaningful and often related to important concepts from other areas. Plenty of complexity classes have been introduced over the years, and many of them are quantitative in their essence – i.e., instead of decision problems,\nthey classify problems in which a value from some algebra is assigned to each input  .\nIt turns out that these classes can often be characterised via weighted Turing machines, which makes the analogies with the corresponding complexity classes of decision problems\nmore transparent, while the nature of such analogies can be described by the semiring considered. The landscape of quantitative complexity classes thus in a sense becomes more readable. Universal importance of weighted logics becomes apparent in the study of weighted complexity classes.\nWeighted MSO logics over words were introduced by M. Droste and P. Gastin  in order to characterise the class of rational series in a similar spirit as rational languages\nare captured by unweighted MSO logics over words ; this result was also extended from finite words to other settings such as infinite words , trees  , or graphs .\nLater, weighted first-order logics and their relation to aperiodic weighted automata were also considered .\nIn connexion to weighted complexity classes, weighted logics tend to arise in new unexpected ways. As we observe,\nthe Boolean satisfiability problem 𝖲𝖠𝖳𝖲𝖠𝖳\\mathsf{SAT} admits a natural weighted generalisation 𝖲𝖠𝖳​[S]𝖲𝖠𝖳delimited-[]𝑆\\mathsf{SAT}[S] over a semiring S𝑆S, which can be seen as a “satisfiability” problem for the weighted propositional logic over S𝑆S,\nthe propositional fragment of the weighted MSO logic over S𝑆S. This problem turns out to be 𝐍𝐏​[S]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{NP}[S]-complete whenever S𝑆S is finitely generated, which generalises the Cook-Levin theorem to the weighted setting.\nIn yet another direction, there have been attempts [ref]2   1 to extend the results of descriptive complexity 3 6 to counting complexity classes.\nA relatively recent approach of M. Arenas, M. Muñoz and C. Riveros [ref]2  successfully uses weighted logics over the semiring of natural numbers for this purpose.\nThe theory of weighted complexity classes over abstract semirings opens a door to possible extensions of these results, in which quantitative descriptive complexity theory based on weighted logics\nwould be developed over some fairly general class of semirings.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: encompasses\nthe study of quantitative generalisations of automata and related formalisms such as grammars    and systems of equations  , rational expressions  , and MSO logics  [ref]19.\nA weight taken from some structure – most typically a semiring – is assigned to each transition of a weighted automaton, so that these automata no longer describe formal languages;\ninstead,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
