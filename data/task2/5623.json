      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Intrinsic Embedding for Non-rigid Point Cloud Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBaselines  We compare our method with a set of baselines, which are categorized depending on if mesh information is required during inference time: (1) BCICP , SURFMNet , UnsupFMNet , NeuroMorph [ref]14, FMNet , WSupFMNet  in which meshes are required for computing eigenbasis; (2) 3D-CODED , CorrNet-3D , LIE , on the other hand, can directly predict point-wise maps based on point clouds as test input. The used supervision is indicated next to each method in the table: Unsupervised, Supervised, Weakly-supervised. First, we train models on FAUST_r and SCAPE_r datasets respectively. In particular, we train our NIE and NIM network both with ground-truth geodesic information computed on the meshes from the training set.\nIn Table 3, we report the normal matching errors as well as generalized matching errors. For instance, the column F on S reads that training on FAUST_r but test on SCAPE_r.\nIn Table 3, the best score from each category are highlighted in bold. Our method performs the best in 333 out of 444 terms among the competing methods of the same category.\nIndeed, our score is also the second best of all methods in the table with respect to the 333 terms, only being outperformed by WSupFMNet  by a reasonable margin, given the fact that the latter uses eigenbasis of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We report further the generalization capacity in Table 4. In this case, we train our NIE and NIM network, as well as the baseline methods, on SURREAL_r, and then use the trained models to infer test shapes of SCAPE_r and FAUST_r.\nIn this case, we mainly compare CorrNet-3D  and LIE .\nIt is evident from the top half of Table 4 that our method generalizes the best, with 50%percent5050\\% and 56.7%percent56.756.7\\% matching error reduction upon LIE.\nWe also provide qualitative illustrations on the computed maps from different approaches in Fig. 4. Finally, we demonstrate that, given a trained NIE, one can even train a NIM network on a different training set, where geodesic information is absent.\nMore specifically, we first train the NIE module on SURREAL_r dataset. Then given a set of point clouds from other dataset, e.g., the training set of FAUST_r, we can use the trained NIE to embed the unseen point clouds, and to approximate the geodesic distances with Euclidean distances among the embeddings.\nIn the end, we train NIM with the point clouds from FAUST_r and the respective approximated geodesics. Fig. 6 shows the results on the above learning protocol. As a strong baseline, we train two NIM’s on FAUST_r and on SCAPE_r, which exploit the full information from the respective dataset. As shown in Fig. 6, our method, without any ground-truth geodesic information from the dataset of interest, achieves decent performance even compared to the models trained with full information.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: Baselines  We compare our method with a set of baselines, which are categorized depending on if mesh information is required during inference time: (1) BCICP , SURFMNet , UnsupFMNet , NeuroMorph [ref]14, FMNet , WSupFMNet  in which meshes are required for computing eigenbasis; (2) 3D-CODED , CorrNet-3D , LIE , on the other hand, can directly predict point-wise maps based on point clouds as\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
