      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforcement Learning Algorithms: An Overview and Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough discrete actions are sufficient to move a car or UAV in a virtual environment, such actions do not provide a realistic object movement in real-life scenarios. Continuous actions describe the quantity of movement in different directions where the agent does not choose from a list of predefined actions. For example, a realistic UAV movement specifies the quantity of required change in roll, pitch, yaw, and throttle values to navigate the environment while avoiding obstacles, rather than moving UAV using one step in predefined directions: up, down, left, right, and forward. Continuous action space requires the agent to learn a parameterized policy 𝝅𝜽subscript𝝅𝜽\\bm{\\pi_{\\theta}} to maximize the expected summation of the discounted rewards because it is impossible to calculate action-value for all continuous actions at different states. The problem is a maximization problem and can be solved using gradient descent algorithms to find the optimal 𝜽𝜽\\bm{\\theta}. The value of 𝜽𝜽\\bm{\\theta} is updated as follows: where 𝜶𝜶\\bm{\\alpha} is the learning rate and ∇bold-∇\\bm{\\nabla} is the gradient. The reward function 𝑱𝑱\\bm{J} objective is to maximize the expected reward using a parameterized policy πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta} as follows : Here 𝝆𝝅𝜽​(𝒔)subscript𝝆subscript𝝅𝜽𝒔\\bm{\\rho_{\\pi_{\\theta}}(s)} defines the stationary probability of 𝝅𝜽subscript𝝅𝜽\\bm{\\pi_{\\theta}} starting from state 𝒔𝟎subscript𝒔0\\bm{s_{0}} and transitioning to future states following the policy 𝝅𝜽subscript𝝅𝜽\\bm{\\pi_{\\theta}} for 𝒕𝒕\\bm{t} time steps. Finding the optimal 𝜽𝜽\\bm{\\theta} that maximizes the function 𝑱​(𝝅𝜽)𝑱subscript𝝅𝜽\\bm{J(\\pi_{\\theta})} requires finding the gradient ∇𝜽𝑱​(𝜽)subscriptbold-∇𝜽𝑱𝜽\\bm{\\nabla_{\\theta}J(\\theta)}: Equation 10 can be further rewritten in continuous episodes since ∑𝒔∈𝑺𝜼​(𝒔)=𝟏subscript𝒔𝑺𝜼𝒔1\\bm{\\sum_{s\\in S}\\eta(s)=1} as: When the training sample is collected according to the target policy 𝒔∼𝝆𝝅𝜽similar-to𝒔superscript𝝆subscript𝝅𝜽\\bm{s\\sim\\rho^{\\pi_{\\theta}}} and the expected return is generated for the same policy 𝝅𝜽subscript𝝅𝜽\\bm{\\pi_{\\theta}}, the algorithm is referred to as on-policy algorithm. On the other hand, in off-policy algorithms, the training sample follows a behavior policy 𝜷​(𝒂|𝒔)𝜷conditional𝒂𝒔\\bm{\\beta(a|s)}, which is different than the target policy 𝝅𝜽​(𝒂|𝒔)subscript𝝅𝜽conditional𝒂𝒔\\bm{\\pi_{\\theta}(a|s)} , while the expected reward is generated using the target policy 𝝅𝜽subscript𝝅𝜽\\bm{\\pi_{\\theta}}. Off-policy algorithms do not require full rejectories (episodes) for the training sample and they can reuse past trajectories. Equation 12  shows how the policy is adjusted to the ratio between the target policy 𝝅𝜽​(𝒂|𝒔)subscript𝝅𝜽conditional𝒂𝒔\\bm{\\pi_{\\theta}(a|s)} and behaviour policy 𝜷​(𝒂|𝒔)𝜷conditional𝒂𝒔\\bm{\\beta(a|s)}.
