      "content": "Paper Title: Meuzz: Smart Seed Scheduling for Hybrid Fuzzing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHybrid testing as a research topic has attracted tremendous attention and made\nsignificant contributions to bug discovery. For instance, the winning teams in\nthe DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge all used hybrid\ntesting. Compared with plain fuzzing, hybrid testing features an\nextra concolic execution component, which revisits the fuzzed paths, solves the\npath conditions, and tries to uncover new paths. One key challenge in hybrid testing is to recognize high-utility seeds (i.e., seeds of high potential to guide concolic execution to crack complex conditions guarding more coverage and bugs).\nPrioritizing such seeds allows the hybrid fuzzer to achieve higher code coverage\nmore quickly, and in turn, discover more bugs in a fixed time frame. Moreover,\nthis prioritization matters in practice because the concolic execution engine\nusually has limited time budget and can explore only a (small) subset of all\nfuzzer-generated seeds. Being able to estimate seed utility allows hybrid\nfuzzers to use concolic execution more efficiently. The existing work       \nuses purely heuristic-based seed selection. For example, some prefer seeds with\nsmaller sizes while some value those that lead to new code coverage.\nThese heuristics, despite their simplicity, do not perform equally well across\ndifferent kinds of programs and are not universally suitable for all programs.\nContradicting the previous belief¬†  , our experiments show that seeds leading to\nnew coverage sometimes have the lowest utility (¬ß6.3).\nSimilarly,\nprevious work   suggested that smaller seeds should have higher\nutility, which however is not true in certain programs as our evaluation shows.\nAs a result, these simple and fixed heuristics may cause non-optimum seed\nselections, overwhelming the concolic engine with low-utility seeds and slowing\ndown bug discovery. Compared to heuristics, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, when trained with\nsufficient data, can discover complex and implicit patterns automatically\n.\nWe show that seed selection strategies that are automatically learned based on\nindividual programs perform better than manually defined heuristics that fail to\nconsider all kinds of programs. As our experiment shows that the influence of each\nfeature varies across different programs, suggesting that no single feature (or\nrule) can work well for all programs.\nML-based seed selection avoids the need for manually designing, testing, and\nreasoning about seed selection rules, which can be daunting, non-scalable, or\neven impossible when the volume of data to be analyzed is overwhelming. In this paper, we introduce Meuzz, an ML-enhanced hybrid fuzzing system. Unlike\nexisting work, which schedule seeds using simple heuristics derived from a\nparticular set of test programs, Meuzz uses ML and a set of static and dynamic\nfeatures, computed from seeds and individual programs, to predict seed utility\nand perform seed scheduling. Meuzz also has a built-in evaluation module that\nmeasures prediction quality for continuous learning and improvement. To the best\nof our knowledge, Meuzz is the first work  that applies ML\nto seed prioritization and scheduling. To effectively apply ML to seed scheduling for hybrid fuzzing, our design of\nMeuzz pays special attention to two ML tasks: feature engineering and\ndata labeling. While these are the essential steps to bootstrap ML, they\ncould be time-consuming and thus too costly or impractical to be included in the\nfuzzing workflow. For instance, feature extraction can be very slow if it\nrequires heavy computation or extensive data collection. Moreover, it is not\nstraightforward to quantify seed utility, which is essential for labeling. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we first engineer a set of lightweight\nfeatures based on code reachability and dynamic analysis. Second, we propose a\nlabeling method using the input descendant tree to quantify the utility of a\nseed. Our evaluation shows that Meuzz takes only 5Œº‚Äãsùúáùë†{\\mu}s on average to\nextract an individual feature. It also confirms that the descendant tree of a\nseed accurately reflects seed utility. Collecting data and training a new model for every program might not be\neconomical or necessary. Therefore, we investigate the feasibility of model\nreusability and transferability to answer the question: Is a learned model\ntransferable to different fuzzing configurations or programs?\nSince the learning is designed to predict the likelihood of seeds triggering\nbugs, rather than any specifics of the fuzzed program, a model learned by Meuzz turns out to be applicable beyond the program from which the model is learned. We compare Meuzz with the state-of-the-art fuzzers¬†[ref]24  \nas well as the most recent hybrid testing systems . The results,\nbased on a set of real-world benchmark programs, show that Meuzz achieves much\nhigher code coverage than the tested fuzzers that use simple seed selection\nheuristics. Particularly Meuzz expands the code coverage by as much as 27.1%\ncompared to QSYM, the start-of-the-art hybrid fuzzing system. The experiments\nalso show that the prediction models learned by Meuzz have good reusability and\ntransferability. The reused models boost the coverage by 7.1% on average. The\ntransplanted models improve fuzzing performance in 38 out of 56 cases (67.9% of\ncases), with 10 cases seeing more than 10% improvement. This paper makes the following contributions. Effective and generalizable approach. We design, implement, and\nevaluate Meuzz, the first system that applies machine learning to the seed\nselection stage of hybrid fuzzing. Meuzz performs better and is more widely\napplicable than heuristic-based seed selection. Practical feature and label engineering. We address two major\nchallenges, namely feature engineering and label inference, when applying\nML to seed selection in hybrid fuzzing.\nOur feature selection and extraction allow for online/continuous learning. They\nare compatible with the existing hybrid fuzzing workflow and require no changes\nto either fuzzers or concolic execution engines. We also propose an automatic\nlabel inference method based on seed descendant trees. Reusable and transferable ML models. Our seed selection models\ndemonstrate strong reusability and transferability.\nAs a result, Meuzz can reuse a well-trained model on different programs (or\ndifferent fuzzing configurations) to quickly bootstrap the fuzzing campaign and\ncontinuously improve and adapt the model to the current program or\nconfiguration. Open-Source. The full implmentation of Meuzz will be open-sourced after acceptance.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: than any specifics of the fuzzed program, a model learned by Meuzz turns out to be applicable beyond the program from which the model is learned.
