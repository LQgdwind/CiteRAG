      "content": "Paper Title: Pathformer: Recursive Path Query Encoding for Complex Logical Query Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs) have drawn much attention in academia and industry,\nwhich have been often used in various intelligent application scenarios   [ref]3 .\nHowever, due to the limitations of KG construction techniques  , real-world KGs    are often considered noisy and incomplete, which is also known as the Open World Assumption (OWA) 0.\nComplex Logical Query Answering (CLQA) is a fundamental yet challenging task which requires answering the Existential First Order Logic (EFOL) queries with logical operators, including existential quantifier (‚àÉ\\exists), conjunction (‚àß\\wedge), disjunction (‚à®\\vee), and negation (¬¨\\neg) on incomplete KGs.\nSince CLQA is geared toward KGs with OWA,\nthe method to solve CLQA needs to perform multi-hop logical reasoning over KGs.\nThat is, not only to execute logical operators but also to utilize available knowledge to predict the unseen one, which is the root cause of the failure of traditional traversal methods to answer complex logical queries 1. Recently, Query Embedding (QE) methods 2 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 have been proposed to solve CLQA.\nQE methods embed entities and queries into continuous vector spaces to select answer entities by comparing the distance between the candidate entity embeddings and query embedding.\nThey represent the EFOL query formula as a computation graph, where logic operations are replaced with corresponding set operations.\nMoreover, the existential quantifier induces a set projection operation, which corresponds to logic skolemization 9.\nFor example, a query ‚ÄùWho starred in Fellini‚Äôs films that didn‚Äôt win any Oscar awards?‚Äù can be converted into an EFOL query with a single free variable: V?.‚àÉV:Direct(Fellini,V)‚àß¬¨AwardedTo(OscarAward,V)‚àßStarredBy(V,V?)V_{?}.\\exists V:Direct(Fellini,V)\\wedge\\neg AwardedTo(Oscar\\ Award,V)\\wedge StarredBy(V,V_{?}).\nAs shown in Figure 1 (A), we can obtain a tree-like computation graph based on the query.\nEach node in the computation graph represents an entity or an entity set, while each edge represents the corresponding set logic operation. However, although most QE methods effectively tackle the incompleteness of KG, there is still a limitation.\nThey usually encode the query link by link starting from the anchor entity nodes according to the computation graph.\nThese approaches only consider previous query context information but not future context,\nmaking it difficult to model the implicit complex dependencies between various parts of a query.\nBIQE 0 is also aware of this point, so it uses a transformer encoder 1 to model the entire computation graph, thereby fully utilizing the query context information through the bidirectional attention mechanism 2.\nTo represent the structure of the computation graph, BIQE designs a special positional encoding scheme.\nHowever, according to current studies on graph transformers 3 4,\ngraph inductive biases are crucial for the transformers to encode graphs,\nand only introducing positional encoding may be insufficient for modelling graph structure information.\nThis means the query encoding approach of BIQE may lose the structural information of the input query graph.\nAdditionally, BIQE cannot handle negative queries. In this paper, we focus on an important subset of EFOL queries whose computation graphs are trees, i.e., query computation trees.\nFor a tree, all nodes except leaf ones are branch nodes.\nAs is shown in the tree-like computation graph in Figure 1 (A), the anchor entity nodes are leaf nodes, and others are branch nodes.\nFor example, the existential variable node VùëâV is a two-branch node, and each branch can be regarded as a path query sequence.\nSimilarly, the free variable node (i.e., answer node) V?subscriptùëâ?V_{?} is a single-branch node, and its branch V‚ü∂rS‚Äãt‚Äãa‚Äãr‚Äãr‚Äãe‚Äãd‚ÄãB‚ÄãyV?superscript‚ü∂subscriptùëüùëÜùë°ùëéùëüùëüùëíùëëùêµùë¶ùëâsubscriptùëâ?V\\ \\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle r_{StarredBy}}}{{\\longrightarrow}}\\ V_{?} is also a path query sequence.\nThis means that we can decompose a tree-like query into path query sequences by branches, which allows us to follow the query computation tree to solve the query path by path.\nFor these path query sequences, we can naturally introduce the transformer 2 to encode them separately.\nThrough the bidirectional attention mechanism, we can fully utilize future context to explicitly model the complex dependencies between various parts of a path query.\nIn contrast to BIQE, the transformer is not used to encode the entire query computation tree but a branch path query sequence,\nso there is no need to consider the loss of input graph structure information caused by insufficient graph inductive biases for the transformer. Therefore, we propose a neural QE method named Pathformer, which decomposes a tree-like query into path query sequences by branches.\nWe define the fork query as the process of aggregating the representations of each branch path query sequence to obtain the corresponding multi-branch variable node representation,\nso a tree-like EFOL query can be viewed as a combination of path queries and fork queries, as shown in Figure 1 (B).\nWe use the encoder part of the transformer 2 as the path query encoder to encode the entire path query sequence at once.\nFurthermore, by introducing just one token representing the set complement/negation operation,\nPathformer can encode path queries with negation.\nBy encoding the fork query,\nwe can get the representations of the intermediate multi-branch variable nodes to complete the subsequent path queries.\nThus, we can recursively encode all the path query sequences through the fork queries to embed the complex query into the one-point vector space.\nWe conducted experiments on two KG reasoning benchmark datasets: FB15k-237  and NELL995 5.\nThe experimental results show that Pathformer can outperform existing competitive neural QE methods,\nand we find that Pathformer, as a one-point embedding method, has the potential to be applied to non-one-point embedding spaces 1 3 after experimental analyses.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have drawn much attention in academia and industry,\nwhich have been often used in various intelligent application scenarios   [ref]3 .\nHowever, due to the limitations of KG construction techniques  , real-world KGs    are often considered noisy and incomplete, which is also known as the Open World Assumption (OWA)\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
