      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Pixel Aggregations for Image and Video Denoising\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExisting denoising methods are developed based on explicit or implicit pixel aggregations       [ref]8.\nGaussian  and bilateral  smoothing models sample pixels from a local window and compute averaging weights using Gaussian functions.\nThe non-local means (NLM)  aggregates image pixels globally and decides the weights with patch similarities.\nOn the other hand, the BM3D  method searches pixels with block matching and uses transform domain collaborative filtering for weighted averaging. As videos contain temporal information and more pixel observations, the VBM3D  and VBM4D  algorithms extend the BM3D scheme by grouping more similar patches in the spatio-temporal domain.\nIn addition, optical flow has also been exploited in video denoising  [ref]8 to aggregate pixels.\nHowever, existing video denoising methods are less effective for videos with fast and complex motion.\nIn contrast to the above approaches with hand-crafted strategies for sampling and averaging pixels, our method explicitly learns the pixel aggregation process from data for denoising.\nFurthermore, the proposed spatio-temporal model handles large motion in video denoising without optical flow estimation. Recently, numerous image and video denoising   [ref]15 [ref]16      0 1 methods based on deep learning have been developed.\nIn particular, CNNs with residual connections have been used to directly learn a mapping function from the noisy input to the denoised output\n  .\nOn the other hand,\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs) [ref]15 [ref]16 have also been used for exploiting the temporal structure of videos to learn the mapping function for multiple frame input.\nWhile these networks are effective in removing noise, the adopted activation functions may lead to information loss 2.\nIn addition, directly synthesizing images with deep neural networks does not enforce constrained output space and thereby tends to generate oversmoothing artifacts.\nIn contrast, the proposed algorithm can directly manipulate the input frames and adaptively aggregate pixels across the spatial and spatio-temporal space, which effectively addresses the above issues.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Existing denoising methods are developed based on explicit or implicit pixel aggregations       [ref]8.\nGaussian  and bilateral  smoothing models sample pixels from a local window and compute averaging weights using Gaussian functions.\nThe non-local means (NLM)  aggregates image pixels globally\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
