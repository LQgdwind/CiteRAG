      "content": "Paper Title: Weakly-supervised Action Transition Learning for Stochastic Human Motion Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModeling human motion has broad applications in human-robot interaction [ref]26, virtual/augmented reality (AR/VR)  and animation 0.\nAs such, it has been an active research problem for many years . In\nparticular, recently, great progress has been made in predicting future motion given an observed past motion sequence  7. Addressing this could have a significant impact on autonomous systems, allowing them to forecast potential dangers and plan their actions accordingly.\nNevertheless, except for a few early methods that predict motions of a single action category  ,\nrecent methods  7 mostly focus on action-agnostic predictions.\nThus, they cannot be used by an autonomous system to generate specific potential future scenarios encoded by a sequence of action labels, for example to evaluate the consequences of a person on a sidewalk either walking to the crossing, waiting for the green light, and crossing the road, or instead running on the street and stopping in front of the car.\nBy contrast, recent works on human motion synthesis can generate action-specific sequences  . However, these methods neither leverage past motion observations, nor synthesize transitions between different actions.\nIn this work, we therefore introduce the task of action-driven stochastic human motion prediction, which aims to predict a set of future motions given a sequence of action labels and past motion observations. One of the key challenges of this task arises from the fact that humans can perform\nmotions with all kinds of action transitions. For example, when one walks to\na table, they can then either grab a drink, or sit on a chair, or\nplace something on the table, or perform any combination of the above.\nConstructing a dataset that covers this huge space of possible action transitions is therefore virtually impossible, significantly complicating training a model for this task. As a matter of fact, to the best of our knowledge, almost all human motion datasets contain sequences that depict a single action. While the recent BABEL dataset  constitutes the only exception with multiple actions per sequence, it contains only a small subset of action transitions, which, as evidenced by our experiments, does not suffice to learn to generalize to arbitrary ones. To tackle the diversity of human action transitions with such limited data, we develop a weakly-supervised training strategy that only relies on a motion smoothness prior. Specifically, we generate multi-action sequences by combining historical and future motions from different action categories, and account for the lack of supervision during the transition between two actions by simply encouraging the predicted motion to be temporally smooth. As will be shown by our experiments, such a simple prior suffices to model natural action transitions. The second main challenge of our task arises from the stochastic nature of human motion: Several ways to perform one action sequence are equally plausible. To handle this stochasticity, we design a model based on a variational autoencoder (VAE) , conditioning the VAE on the observed past motion and on the action label sequence. We demonstrate the generality of this model by exploiting it with two different temporal encoding architectures, an RNN-based one\nand a Transformer-based one.\nFurthermore, to reflect the fact that some action sequences require more time to be executed than others, we introduce a simple yet effective strategy based on the prediction variance to produce multi-action motions of different lengths. This contrasts with most of the motion prediction literature, which predicts fixed-length motions, and, as illustrated by Fig. 1, allows us to generate realistic, diverse future motions depicting the given actions in order and with varying length. We believe that our approach can also be beneficial for other tasks, e.g., music generation of variable length. Our contribution can therefore be summarized as follows:\n(i) We introduce a new task, action-driven stochastic human motion prediction, which bridges the gap between motion synthesis and stochastic human motion prediction;\n(ii) We propose a weakly-supervised training strategy to learn the action transitions without requiring an unrealistic amount of annotated data;\n(iii) We develop a simple yet effective way of predicting motions of varying length. Our experiments on 3 human motion modeling benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming baseline models constructed by extending state-of-the-art action-conditioned motion synthesis methods and stochastic human motion prediction ones to our new task.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Modeling human motion has broad applications in human-robot interaction [ref]26, virtual/augmented reality (AR/VR)  and animation 0.\nAs such, it has been an active research problem for many years .
