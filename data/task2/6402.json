      "content": "Paper Title: Practical First-Order Bayesian Optimization Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nZeroth Order Bayesian Optimization (ZOBO) or (BO) is a black-box optimization paradigm to determine the global maxima of an unknown function fùëìf, i.e., to determine where ‚Ñõ‚Ñõ\\mathcal{R} denotes the domain where we want to search for the global maxima . The objective function f‚Äã(x)ùëìxf(\\textbf{x}) is ‚Äúblack-box‚Äù or is ‚Äúlatent‚Äù in the sense that we do not know the exact functional form of f‚Äã(‚ãÖ)ùëì‚ãÖf({\\cdot}) and can only observe the function values at query locations. Furthermore, these observed values are typically corrupted by noise.\nThis is often the case when the function f‚Äã(‚ãÖ)ùëì‚ãÖf(\\cdot) is ‚Äúexpensive to evaluate‚Äù i.e. each function evaluation can take a lot of time (for example in days) or is financially costly as in case of drug tests  and dynamic pricing . Function evaluations can also require a lot of computational power which is the case in automatic hyper-parameter tuning for machine learning , , [ref]13, , , 1, and in finding the optimal policy in reinforcement learning tasks , 1, .\nIn such scenarios, we are limited by the number of function queries that we can perform. This is where BO proves to be useful by providing a sample-efficient sequential strategy of querying the objective function to eventually determine the global optima. ZOBO involves two key steps, the first one is that of Bayesian modelling of the unknown function using Gaussian Processes (GP) 4. This model provides a probability distribution (a Gaussian distribution) over the set of all possible values that the objective function f‚Äã(x)ùëìxf(\\textbf{x}) can take at x. Furthermore, using appropriate kernel functions, it also provides a joint probability distribution (multivariate Gaussian) on the function values across different locations.\nIn the second step, one constructs a utility or acquisition function from this Gaussian distribution which acts as surrogate for the unknown function. Typical examples of acquisition functions used in the literature are the probability of improvement (PI) , expected improvement (EI) [ref]18, , , , upper confidence bound (UCB) , predictive entropy search  and knowledge gradient (KG) . The point at which the acquisition function is maximized\ncorrespond to points that either have high objective function values or have high uncertainty in the surrogate model. The objective function is then queried at this maxima point and the Bayesian model is updated based on the new function evaluations. This process is continued until the allowed budget on function evaluations is exhausted. See 4 and , ,  for more details on GP and BO respectively. ZOBO has been applied successfully in a variety of domains. In , the problem of optimizing black-box functions where the input space consists of all permutations of dùëëd objects has been considered. In , an attempt to unify the framework of BO with multi-armed bandit problem is proposed to optimize functions in a hybrid input space of continuous and categorical inputs. In 2, random embeddings have been utilized to apply BO to high dimensional functions. , provide alternative approaches to utilize BO for higher dimensional functions by assuming additive structures. More recently, 3 has utilized BO for the neural architecture search problem. First Order Bayesian Optimization (FOBO) algorithms 5,  on the other hand make use of both the function and gradient evaluations at the query points in search for maxima. Note that the gradient information has been utilized extensively in popular optimization procedures such as gradient descent and can also prove to be valuable in BO. Recently, ,  and  have used hyper-gradients for hyper-parameter optimization in machine learning algorithms and , 0 have constructed the gradient information using the policy gradient method to determine the optimal policy in reinforcement learning. The gradient information is therefore either readily available or can be easily constructed in most applications of our interest for little to no additional cost. In such scenarios, 5 and  have successfully illustrated that FOBO methods significantly outperform existing ZOBO methods. In fact, 5 have demonstrated the utility of FOBO methods for hyper-parameter optimization, while  have illustrated its use in reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks. In a more recent work,  quantify the improvement in regret using FOBO methods under suitable assumptions and propose a FOBO algorithm that achieves a superior regret of O‚Äã((log‚Å°n)2)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõ2O((\\log n)^{2}) compared to Œ©‚Äã(n)Œ©ùëõ\\Omega(\\sqrt{n}) achieved by ZOBO. Current FOBO methods, even though efficient in their search, have major shortcomings. A major computational challenge in 5 in utilizing the gradient information is in performing the posterior updates to the GP. This involves taking an inverse of an n‚Äã(d+1)ùëõùëë1n(d+1) dimensional kernel matrix, requiring O‚Äã((n‚Äã(d+1))3)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõùëë13O((n(d+1))^{3}) computations. In order to alleviate this problem  model each partial derivative using an independent Gaussian process which reduces the computational complexity to O‚Äã((d+1)‚Äãn3)ùëÇùëë1superscriptùëõ3O((d+1)n^{3}). They use an acquisition function, which independently search in each dimension for points in the domain with zero partial derivative. While promising, this approach however need not necessarily recommend query points with zero gradient and hence the gradient information is not efficiently utilized. The proposed algorithm also does not utilize the uncertainties in the estimates of the objective function (which is easily available and valuable in such Bayesian modelling) and therefore fails to explore the search space efficiently. In this paper, we propose FOBO algorithms where the impetus is to search for potential query points in the domain where the gradient vanishes. We assume independent GP models for each of the partial derivatives and construct a novel multi-level acquisition function. Using the notion of multiple restarts, we first optimize the lower level acquisition function to identify potential query points where the partial derivatives are zero across all dimensions simultaneously. Such points with zero gradient could potentially correspond to maxima, minima or saddle point and hence we need to rank them on the basis of their likelihood of being the global maxima. Towards this, we use an upper level acquisition (significance) function that makes use of the GP model of the objective function to rank these points. The point with the highest significance value is chosen as the next query point.\nIn addition to this, to encourage exploration in search for maxima, we utilize uncertainties in the estimates of the function and the partial derivative values. Our algorithms are broadly categorized into two types, the first one is based on the EI algorithm while the second one is based on PI. We illustrate their performance on standard test functions and show its efficacy against the state of the art ZOBO and FOBO algorithms. We also consider their application in automatic hyper-parameter tuning for machine learning and finding optimal policy in reinforcement learning.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: as in case of drug tests  and dynamic pricing .
