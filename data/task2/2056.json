      "content": "Paper Title: SHAQ: Incorporating Shapley Value Theory into Multi-Agent Q-Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nValue Factorisation in MARL. To deal with the instability during training in global reward game by independent learners [ref]26, the centralised training and decentralised execution (CTDE) [ref]22 was proposed and it became a general paradigm for MARL. Based on CTDE, MADDPG  learns a global Q-value that can be regarded as assigning the same credits to all agents during training , which may cause the unfair credit assignment . To avoid this problem, VDN [ref]8 was proposed to learn the factorised Q-value, assuming that any global Q-value equals to the sum of decentralised Q-values. Nevertheless, this factorisation may limit the representation of the global Q-value. To mitigate this issue, QMIX  and QTRAN  were proposed to represent the global Q-value with a richer class w.r.t. decentralised Q-values, based on the assumption (called Individual-Global-Max) of convergence to the optimal joint deterministic policy. Markov Shapley value proposed in this paper belongs to the family of value factorisation, based on the game-theoretical framework called MCG that enjoys the interpretability. From the conventional cooperative games (e.g., network flow game , induced subgraph game  that can be used for modelling social networks, and facility location game ), it is insightful that the coalition introduced in this paper exists. In many scenarios, however, the information of coalition might be unknown. Therefore, the latent coalition is assumed, and we only need to concentrate on the observable information, e.g., the global reward. Relationship to VDN. By setting δi​(𝐬,ai)=1subscript𝛿𝑖𝐬subscript𝑎𝑖1\\delta_{i}(\\mathbf{s},a_{i})=1 for all state-action pairs, SHAQ degrades to VDN [ref]8. Although VDN tried to tackle the problem of dummy agents, Sunehag et al. [ref]8 did not give a theoretical guarantee on identifying it. The Markov Shapley value theory proposed in this paper well addresses this issue from both theoretical and empirical aspects. These aspects show that VDN is a subclass of SHAQ. The theoretical framework proposed in this paper answers to why VDN works well in most scenarios but performs poorly in some scenarios (i.e., δi​(𝐬,ai)=1subscript𝛿𝑖𝐬subscript𝑎𝑖1\\delta_{i}(\\mathbf{s},a_{i})=1 in Eq.9 was incorrectly defined over the suboptimal actions). Relationship to COMA. Compared with COMA , each agent i𝑖i’s credit assignment Q¯i​(𝐬,ai)subscript¯𝑄𝑖𝐬subscript𝑎𝑖\\bar{Q}_{i}(\\mathbf{s},a_{i}) is mathematically expressed as follows: where subscript −i𝑖-i indicates the agents excluding i𝑖i. Q¯i​(𝐬,ai)subscript¯𝑄𝑖𝐬subscript𝑎𝑖\\bar{Q}_{i}(\\mathbf{s},a_{i}) can be seen as the action marginal contribution between the grand coalition Q-value and the coalition Q-value excluding the agent i𝑖i, under some permutation to form the grand coalition wherein agent i𝑖i is located at the last position. The efficiency is obviously violated (i.e., the sum of optimal action marginal contributions defined here is unlikely to be equal to the optimal grand coalition Q-value). In contrast to COMA, SHAQ considers all permutations to form the grand coalition to preserve the efficiency. Relationship to Independent Learning. Independent learning (e.g. IQL [ref]26) can be also seen as a special credit assignment, however, the credit assigned to each agent is still with no intuitive interpretation. Mathematically, suppose that Q¯i​(𝐬,ai)subscript¯𝑄𝑖𝐬subscript𝑎𝑖\\bar{Q}_{i}(\\mathbf{s},a_{i}) is the independent Q-value of agent i𝑖i, we can rewrite it in the form consisting of action marginal contributions such that It is intuitive to see that the independent Q-value is a direct approximation of MSQ, ignoring coalition formation, while SHAQ considers coalition formation in approximation. This gives an explanation for why independent learning works well in some cooperative tasks . Nevertheless, it encounters the same issue as in COMA, the loss of properties led by the coalition formation. Relationship to SQDDPG. We now discuss the relationship between SQDDPG  and SHAQ. In terms of algorithms, SQDDPG belongs to policy gradient methods (i.e. an approximation of policy iteration) while SHAQ belongs to value based methods (i.e. an approximation of value iteration). Since policy iteration (with one-step policy evaluation) is equivalent to value iteration  (at least under a finite state space and a finite action space), the theory behind SHAQ directly fills the gap in SQDDPG on theoretical guarantees of convergence to optimal joint policy. Specifically, the learning procedure of SQDDPG iteratively performs the following two stages: It can be observed that both SQDDPG and SHAQ ideally converge to the same optimal MSQs w.r.t. the optimal actions such that However, about suboptimal actions, SQDDPG does not provide any theoretical guarantee, whereas SHAQ does with specific implementations as shown in Eq.13 to match the theoretical results shown in this paper. Note that this is critical to reliable interpretations of the optimal MSQ w.r.t. suboptimal actions (e.g., for detecting adversarial attacks on controllers if deployed in industry ).\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Value Factorisation in MARL.
