      "content": "Paper Title: GALÆXI: Solving complex compressible flows with high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods on accelerator-based systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe computational sciences have become an essential driver for understanding the dynamics of complex, nonlinear systems ranging from the dynamics of earth’s climate  to obtaining information about a patient’s characteristic blood flow to derive personalized approaches in medical therapy .\nWhile these successes also rely on significant breakthroughs in the development of numerical methods and physical models, a major portion can be ascribed to the exponential increase in available computing power, which has allowed simulating increasingly large and complex problems over the last decades.\nHowever, the corresponding process of shrinking transistors from generation to generation has become increasingly challenging and the resulting gains in performance have diminished in recent years .\nAs a consequence, the community is moving towards accelerator chips, which do not serve as a one-size-fits-all hardware like traditional CPUs.\nThese chips are specialized to yield better performance and efficiency for specific tasks, such as workloads in artificial intelligence, video encoding or cryptography.\nThis also shows in the field of high-performance computing (HPC), where nine out of the ten fastest supercomputers listed in the most recent TOP500  from November 2023 employ some form of accelerator.\nIn the most recent GREEN500  list, which focuses on sustainability in terms of energy invested per computation, all of the ten most efficient HPC systems employ GPU accelerators. However, such accelerators generally differ considerably from general-purpose CPUs in terms of hardware design, as well as the working principle.\nAs a consequence, using accelerators oftentimes not only requires rewriting and redesigning large portions of existing code to make efficient use of such hardware, but also might change which numerical algorithms are most efficient for a specific task.\nThis poses significant challenges for legacy HPC codes due to the considerable effort required to migrate the existing codebase to hardware accelerators.\nThis issue is particularly pervasive in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), where scale-resolving simulations of turbulent flows generally require significant HPC resources. Here, modern high-order discretization methods such as Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and Flux Reconstruction (FR) schemes have become popular due to their computational efficiency for such multi-scale problems and their excellent scaling properties on HPC systems. The need to adapt existing and established code bases to the new HPC architectures has already been considered in the CFD community.\nOne of the most established high-order codes for incompressible and weakly compressible flow is Nek5000 .\nThe first effort to port Nek5000 to accelerators was reported in 2015 [ref]7, where a barebones version of the code was adapted for GPUs using the OpenACC library.\nFull GPU support was then offered by its successor NekRS , which is based on the Open Concurrent Computing Abstraction (OCCA) .\nSimilarly, Neko 0 was implemented from scratch using modern, object-orientated Fortran and abstraction layers to support multiple hardware backends.\nWhile the previous codes focus mainly on incompressible and weakly compressible flows, pyFR 1 also solves the compressible Navier–Stokes equations (NSE) on unstructured meshes using the FR approach.\nMoreover, it is written in Python and relies on code generation to support multiple computing backends including accelerators and provides excellent scaling properties on HPC systems.\nSimilarly, the deal.II 2 and MFEM 3 libraries provide a DG discretization to solve the compressible NSE and both have added GPU support in recent years. In this work, we present GALÆXI 333https://github.com/flexi-framework/galaexi/ as a GPU-accelerated solver for hyperbolic-parabolic conservation laws with special emphasis on compressible flows.\nThe numerical simulation of compressible flows is highly relevant for a large number of problems, e.g. from the aviation industry or aeroacoustics.\nGALÆXI builds on the well-established FLEXI solver 4 and inherits the majority of its features and its extensive pre- and post-processing suite that is designed for large-scale applications.\nHence, GALÆXI implements multiple flavors of the Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method (DGSEM) and can handle fully unstructured, curved, high-order meshes to account for complex geometries.\nMoreover, multiple stabilization techniques are implemented to ensure the stability of the scheme in underresolved simulations and in the vicinity of shocks using shock capturing schemes based on localized finite-volume (FV) subcell approaches.\nThe user interface of GALÆXI is deliberately kept compatible to FLEXI, such that GALÆXI can serve as a drop-in replacement to run existing simulation setups on GPU systems without modifications. This work contributes the following aspects to the challenging but necessary steps for the transition to exascale HPC architectures in CFD.\nIt provides insights into the suitability of DGSEM for GPU acceleration and quantifies the gains in performance and efficiency that can be expected for explicit, high-order DG methods when moving from traditional CPUs to GPUs.\nIt also provides practical guidelines on how existing codebases can be ported to GPU hardware and proposes parallelization concepts for achieving parallel efficiency on HPC hardware with high-order schemes.\nFurthermore, the savings in the context of energy-to-solution are discussed in particular and can serve as a point of reference in terms of energy efficiency. This work is organized as follows.\nFirst, Section 2 introduces the governing equations and the numerical methods implemented in GALÆXI.\nBased on this, Section 3 provides details on the parallelization strategy and the implementation of the compute kernels.\nThe resulting performance and scaling abilities of GALÆXI are presented and discussed in Section 4.\nThe implementation of the numerical scheme is verified in Section 5, demonstrating the theoretical convergence rates of the numerical methods and accurate results for the incompressible and compressible formulations of the Taylor–Green-Vortex (TGV) test case.\nTo demonstrate the applicability to applications of relevance, GALÆXI is employed in Section 6 to compute a large-scale, wall-resolved LES of the NASA Rotor 37 5 test case.\nSection 7 summarizes the major results of the paper and provides an outlook on further developments.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: in the CFD community.\nOne of the most established high-order codes for incompressible and weakly compressible flow is Nek5000 .\nThe first effort to port Nek5000 to accelerators was reported in 2015 [ref]7, where a barebones version of the code was adapted for GPUs using the OpenACC library.\nFull GPU support was then offered by its successor NekRS , which is based on the Open Concurrent\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
