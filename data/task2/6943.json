      "content": "Paper Title: DeViL: Decoding Vision features into Language\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset. We use the official train-validation split of the CC3M 6, consisting of 3M image-caption pairs collected from the web. We chose this dataset because it is sufficiently large to cover a large variety in both the vision and language modalities. Its successor CC12M  is less focused on high conceptual relevance, and more noisy in caption quality, making CC3M more suitable for tasks that require strong semantic alignment between text and image. Baselines.Although our goal is to translate latent representations of pre-trained vision models into language, DeViL can still be used to obtain full image descriptions. Hence, we evaluate DeViL generated sentences with standard captioning metrics and compare against captioning methods  [ref]50 [ref]17. ClipCap  is a lightweight model that combines the CLIP vision model with a pre-trained language model. Similar to our approach, ClipCap only trains a translation network to keep the training cost low. Both UnifiedVLP [ref]50 and LEMON [ref]17 are large-scale models pre-trained on several datasets not limited to captioning and subsequently finetuned. Thus, they surpass lightweight models such as ClipCap and DeViL, but require a lot of resources to train. Results.\nWe present our results on common language-based metrics: BLEU@4 , METEOR , ROUGE-L , CIDEr , and SPICE . We consider ResNet50  trained on ImageNet and CLIP 2 in both its ResNet50 and ViT variants as our vision backbones. We report image captioning results in Table 1. Between vision backbones, we observe that CLIP-ViT performs better than its ResNet50 counterpart and ResNet50 trained on ImageNet, which is not surprising given CLIP’s contrastive vision-language pre-training. Since the vision encoder of CLIP has in the past depicted strong zero-shot capabilities on a variety of tasks, we would expect it also to have a large coverage of visual concepts when we explain their features. When using the CLIP-ViT backbone, we further ablate the relevance of the pre-trained language model.\nWe make use of OPT-125M  and GPT2 3 in our pipeline. With CLIP-ViT-B-32 as the vision backbone and OPT as the language model, we obtain our best scores surpassing ClipCap on all by a big margin, e.g. a CIDEr of 86.29 vs. 71.82. Even when using GPT2 and the same translation network architecture as ClipCap, we perform better across the board while using fewer parameters (40M vs. 43M). This is due to our model changes in using multiple layers of the vision backbone and the introduction of both feature-level and layer-level dropouts. Compared to large-scale captioning models that require more resources, we still perform better than UnifiedVLP on all metrics despite it requiring 1200h of training on a V100 GPU. In comparison, ClipCap reports 72h of training on GTX1080, while DeViL requires 24h of training on an A100. LEMON [ref]17 still surpasses our lightweight model as the state-of-the-art model on captioning. Required training resources for LEMON are not reported. Ablations. We ablate the proposed token and feature dropouts in Table 2 in terms of captioning metrics for the CLIP-ViT model. This table shows 3 different models trained with incremental combinations of both dropouts. While each DeViL model is trained to explain multiple vision backbone layers, we evaluate them in two scenarios: using vision features from all layers of the vision backbone it was trained with (all) and when using only the last layer (single).\nThis ablation study confirms that dropout is essential for producing image-relevant captions for individual layers at inference time. Since the model without token dropout has never seen a single layer being passed to the translation network, it performs poorly in this out-of-distribution scenario making CIDEr drop from 75.88 to 4.729. Feature dropout is less essential, but further improves captioning scores and reduces overfitting. When we compare results on using all layers rather than just using one, we see an improvement in all scores, e.g. CIDEr increases from 75.88 to 86.29. This suggests that complementary information is encoded in the different layers and caption content indeed differs, making it reasonable to assume we can obtain layer-specific explanations even when training on caption data. Overall, these results show that with our dropout methods, we can train on several layers at once and perform an evaluation on individual layers by themselves, while also avoiding the need to train one model for each layer we might want to explain later on.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: models into language, DeViL can still be used to obtain full image descriptions.
