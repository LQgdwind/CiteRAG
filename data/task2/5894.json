      "content": "Paper Title: Transformer-based Self-supervised Multimodal Representation Learning for Wearable Emotion Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo solve the overfitting problem introduced by the limited available data for supervised deep learning models, one common solution is data augmentation, i.e., applying different transformations on the original samples to obtain more abundant data. However, performing data augmentation could not introduce inter-subject variability during training .\nAlternatively, a technique that does not require the intervention of labeled data is unsupervised representation learning, where a typical model is an autoencoder, which extracts meaningful representations through the compression and reconstruction of the unlabeled data.\nSeveral studies have explored the feasibility of this technique for emotion recognition.\nIn [ref]16, stacked convolutional autoencoders were applied independently on unlabelled ECG and EDA data to obtain generalized latent representations for arousal classification, achieving better performance than the fully supervised approaches. Though this method effectively modeled the heterogeneity of multimodal signals, i.e. using different models to extract valid unimodal features, however, it neglected the collaborative and complementary nature of multimodality. Different from the previous approach, Zhang et al. [ref]15 presented a correlation-based emotion recognition algorithm (CorrNet), where intra-modal features are first obtained with separate convolutional autoencoders, followed by covariance and cross-covariance computation between each pair of modalities to obtain inter-modal features.\nHowever, these unsupervised learning methods based on autoencoders did not introduce supervised signals in pre-training, thus may resulting in unsatisfactory performance. Recently, a compelling branch in the field of unsupervised representation learning is self-supervised learning (SSL), which can effectively address the de-generalization issue posed by insufficient labeled data.\nUnlike unsupervised learning which does not involve any labelled data, SSL is designed with a series of pretext tasks that introduce self-supervision to unlabelled data, enabling more effective representation learning for downstream tasks.\nEach unsupervised sample is automatically labeled through inherent dependencies and associations between the data without human intervention [ref]17.\nThe SSL model pre-trained on pseudo-labeled data is considered as powerful feature extractor for a variety of downstream tasks.\nIn the domains of computer vision and natural language processing, SSL-based work such as SimCLR , Word2Vec , and BERT  have exhibited competitive and even superior performance on a range of tasks.\nHowever, few studies have investigated the performance of SSL models on peripheral physiological signal data.\nSarkar et Etemad  introduced a self-supervised representation learning framework for ECG-based emotion recognition, where the 1DCNN-based multi-task deep neural network\nis pre-trained with the objective of identifying the signal transformation types applied to unlabeled data.\nTheir study indicated that the pretext task based on transformation recognition can enable the model to better cope with potential variation factors in the data. However, not all time steps of a signal sequence are associated with the target event (i.e., a specific emotion). Thus, how to filter out irrelevant information during SSL for downstream tasks is an unsolved problem. Exploiting the synchrony of multimodal emotional responses is a potential solution. More specifically, multimodal physiological signals exhibit correlated or consistent temporal changes when emotions are elicited. In this way, modeling the correlation of multimodal signals in SSL can facilitate the capture of emotion-related components in unlabeled data. For multimodal emotion recognition, Dissanayake et al.  proposed a self-supervised contrastive learning approach, which aims to approximate the positive pairs while pushing the negative pairs away from each other. However, their SSL model is obtained by pretraining each modality independently, and thus again ignores the cross-modal correlations.\nTherefore, more effective multimodal fusion strategies need to be developed for SSL-based wearable emotion recognition.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: extracts meaningful representations through the compression and reconstruction of the unlabeled data.\nSeveral studies have explored the feasibility of this technique for emotion recognition.\nIn [ref]16, stacked convolutional autoencoders were applied independently on unlabelled ECG and EDA data to obtain generalized latent representations for arousal classification, achieving better\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
