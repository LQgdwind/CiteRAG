      "content": "Paper Title: Semi-orthogonal Embedding for Efficient Unsupervised Anomaly Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnsupervised anomaly segmentation is to localize the anomaly regions in the test sample while only anomaly-free samples are available in training.\nSo, anomaly segmentation is a more challenging task than anomaly detection, which is generally referred to detection whether a given sample has anomaly.\nAnomaly segmentation is to give the visual explanation for the detected anomalies and the location for manual inspection.\nIn real-world problems, anomaly-free samples are usually redundant; however, anomaly samples are scarce due to manufacturing and annotation costs.\nFor this reason, unsupervised methods are favored while it can also provide the robustness towards unknown anomaly forms. The reconstruction error-based methods are explored for autoencoders¬†[ref]1 [ref]2 and GANs¬†[ref]3. The common idea is to train generative networks to minimize reconstruction errors learning low-dimensional features, and expect the higher error for the anomalies not presented in training than the anomaly-free.\nHowever, the networks with a sufficient capacity could restore even anomalies causing performance degradation, although the perceptual loss function for the generative networks¬†[ref]1 or the knowledge distillation loss for teacher-student pairs of networks¬†  achieves a limited success. An inspiring advance comes from a tradition, the Mahalanobis distance¬†. It measures how many standard deviations away a given sample is from the mean of a distribution of normal samples. First, one update is to use the features extracted from the CNNs pre-trained by many natural images. Second, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation, the localized Mahalanobis distance using the feature maps outperform the comparative methods¬†, which exploits a separate covariance for each location in the feature map. This method is in accordance with the assumption of a Gaussian distribution having a single mode since the distribution for every locations of feature maps tends to be a multi-modal distribution. Third, the multi-scale features enable to detect the anomalies in the interactions among the different stages¬† , along with various sizes of receptive-fields in the CNNs. However, the precision matrices for the Mahalanobis distances are required to compute for every locations in the feature map, which formulates the batch-inverse of multi-dimensional tensor where the batch size is for every locations, H√óWùêªùëäH\\times W. As an ad-hoc method, Defard et¬†al.  propose to use randomly sampled features to reduce the covariance size. Our study reveals that it incurs the rank reduction when redundant features are selected with a limited budget of covariance size. In this paper, we generalize the random feature selection to semi-orthogonal embedding as a low-rank approximation of precision matrix for the Mahalanobis distance. The uniformly generated semi-orthogonal matrix¬† can avoid the singular case retaining the better performance while cubically reducing the computational cost for batch-inverse.\nWe achieve new state-of-the-art results for the benchmark datasets, MVTec AD¬†, KolektorSDD¬†, KolektorSDD2¬†, and mSTC¬† while outperforming the competitive methods using reconstruction error-based¬†[ref]3 [ref]2 [ref]1 or knowledge distillation-based¬†  methods with substantial margins. Moreover, we show that our method decoupled with the pre-trained CNNs can exploit the advances of discriminative models without a fine-tuning procedure.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: costs.\nFor this reason, unsupervised methods are favored while it can also provide the robustness towards unknown anomaly forms.
