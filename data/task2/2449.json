Our data\naugmentation setting follows  .\nWe first randomly crop images to a desirable size (32√ó\\times32 for\nCIFAR, 96√ó\\times96 for STL10, and 224√ó\\times224 for ImageNet subsets).\nThen, we perform random horizontal flip, random color jittering, and\nrandom grayscale conversion. For datasets which are ImageNet subsets,\nwe further apply Gaussian blurring at the last step .\nSimilar to previous works [ref]7  9,\nboth the training and test sets are used for CIFAR10, CIFAR20 and\nSTL10 while only the training set is used for other datasets. We also\nprovide results where only the training set is used for CIFAR10, CIFAR20\nand STL10 in Appdx.¬†A.8. For STL10, 100,000 auxiliary unlabeled samples\nare additionally used to train the ‚Äúrepresentation learning‚Äù head.\nHowever, when training the ‚Äúclustering‚Äù head, these auxiliary\nsamples are not used since their classes may not appear in the training\nset. Following previous works 9   [ref]53,\nwe adopt ResNet34 and ResNet50  as the backbone\nnetwork when working on the 5 standard datasets and on the 3 big ImageNet\nsubsets, respectively. The ‚Äúrepresentation learning‚Äù head (RL-head)\nand the ‚Äúclustering‚Äù head (C-head) are two-layer neural networks\nwith ReLU activations. The length of the output vector of the RL-head\nis 128. The temperature œÑùúè\\tau (Eq.¬†5)\nis fixed at 0.1. To reduce variance in learning, we train our model\nwith 10 C-subheads444The final ‚Ñíclustersubscript‚Ñícluster\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{cluster}} in Eq.¬†8\nis the average of ‚Ñíclustersubscript‚Ñícluster\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{cluster}} of these C-subheads. similar to . This only adds little extra computation\nto our model. However, unlike 9  [ref]53,\nwe do not use an auxiliary ‚Äúover-clustering‚Äù head to exploit\nadditional information from data since we think our RL-head can do\nthat effectively. Training setups for end-to-end and two-stage clustering are provided\nin Appdx.¬†A.7. We use three popular clustering metrics namely Accuracy (ACC), Normalized\nMutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) for evaluation.\nFor unlabeled data, ACC is computed via the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm.\nAll of these metrics scale from 0 to 1 and higher values indicate\nbetter performance. In this work, we convert the   range\ninto percentage.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: We evaluate our proposed method on 5 standard datasets for image clustering\nwhich are CIFAR10/20 , STL10 ,\nImageNet10  [ref]7, and ImageNet-Dogs\n [ref]7, and on 3 big ImageNet subsets\nnamely ImageNet50/100/200 with 50/100/200 classes, respectively  .\nA description of these datasets is given in Appdx.¬†A.6.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
