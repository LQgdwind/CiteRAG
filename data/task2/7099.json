      "content": "Paper Title: Challenges and Opportunities to Enable Large-Scale Computing via Heterogeneous Chiplets Invited Paper\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo catch up with the increasing demands, more circuits are integrated into chips.\nHowever, simply scaling the monolithic ASIC accelerators is hardly practical.\nThe chiplet technique is becoming a promising solution to improve performance and energy efficiency and decrease the cost and time to market (design cycle column in Table¬†I), which also suits the different requirements of customers. There are two limitations in scaling up monolithic ASIC chips: the chip area and the yield rate.\nThe die size of CPUs and GPUs grew 14% and 8% respectively every year¬† from 2006 to 2020, which is quickly approaching the lithographic reticle limit.\nFurthermore, the yield will decrease with the increase in die sizes, which causes more waste, leading to higher costs.\nOne way to keep scaling while minimizing the cost is to fabricate small chips and then integrate them.\nTraditionally, multiple chips can be connected via printed circuit boards (PCBs).\nHowever, PCB systems are difficult to provide high-density inter-chip connections, which is required in many applications.\nThe PCB systems cannot pack more than 400 connections in 1 c‚Äãm2ùëêsuperscriptùëö2cm^{2} because the PCBs are prone to warpage and the distance between solder bumps (used to connect the PCBs and chips) cannot be less than 0.5 mm¬†.\nBesides, due to the wire length and parasitic parameters the PCB systems need more power in interconnection and the signal frequency is low¬†.\nThe chiplet technique is proposed to keep the performance scaling and maintain a reasonable cost.\nThis is done by partitioning a monolithic chip into several smaller chiplets and reassembling them into a system-in-package (SiP).\nThis method enables further scaling in the silicon area and decreases the cost.\nTable¬†I compares chiplet technology, monolithic ASIC, and PCB in various metrics¬†. The chiplet technology has been adopted and shown great improvement in real-world products. For example, the first-generation AMD EPYC CPU processor¬† is based on chiplet architecture, which consists of four chiplets in the 14nm process node.\nCompared with the monolithic design, the chiplet-based architecture integrates more silicon area in total, which exceeds the reticle limits.\nBesides, the cost of the chiplet-based architecture is 41% cheaper than a monolithic design¬†. Additionally, chiplet technology allows the integration of chiplets in different process nodes, which provides more choices for different IPs.\nFor example, unlike digital circuits, analog circuits or mixed-signal IPs do not benefit greatly from the advanced technology node, and it is also difficult and time-consuming to apply new technology to them¬†[ref]19. Therefore, it is necessary to manufacture these IPs in a more mature technology node.\nChiplet allows us to integrate these analog or mixed-signal chiplets together with digital circuit chiplets that are fabricated in more advanced technology.\nBesides, designers can select various chiplets to fulfill specific requirements. For example, GPT-based applications have high demands in memory bandwidth¬†. Therefore, to decrease inference latency, chiplets with more memory channels or higher I/O bandwidth are preferred to be integrated into the SiP. \n\n\n\n\nProtocol\nInstitution\n \n\n\nTypical Energy\n\nEfficiency (pJ/bit)\n\n \n\n\nMaximum Speed\n\n(Gbps/wire)\n\n \n\n\nFault Tolerance\n\nMechanism\n\n\nUSR¬†\n\\\n<<0.6 ¬†\n>20¬†\nN/A\n\nAIB¬† \nIntel\n0.85 (Gen1)\n2 (Gen1)¬†, 6.4 (Gen2)¬†\nN/A\n\nBoW¬† \nODSA\n<0.25-1.0 ¬†\n32¬†\nN/A\n\nHBM¬†\nJESDC\n\\\n6.4\nECC\n\nLINPINCON¬†\nTSMC\n0.424\n2.8\nN/A\n\nUCIe¬†\nUCIe Union\n0.25-1.25¬†\n32 GT/s¬†\n \n\n\nCRC + Retransmission\n\n\nAAC¬† \n \n\n\nChina Chiplet Industry Alliance\n\n2.5¬†\n128¬†\n \n\n\nCRC + BER + Retransmission\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: unlike digital circuits, analog circuits or mixed-signal IPs do not benefit greatly from the advanced technology node, and it is also difficult and time-consuming to apply new technology to them¬†[ref]19.
