      "content": "Paper Title: SemIE: Semantically-aware Image Extrapolation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate the proposed approach on two different datasets which have a sufficient disparity between each other to show that our approach is fairly robust and is applicable to diverse scenes. We utilize the publicly available Cityscapes  and ADE20K-bedroom subset 0 datasets both of which contain large variety of distinct object categories. While Cityscapes comprises of outdoor street images, ADE20K bedroom subset consists of bedroom scenes. The ADE20K processed subset111To obtain the processed subset, we contacted the authors of . consists of 31 classes including bed, lamp, wall, floor and table. Cityscapes consists of 2975 training images and 500 validation images. Each image has its corresponding semantic label map and instance label map along with the original image. The bedroom subset of ADE20K 0 has 1389 images in the training set and 139 in the validation set. In order to limit the size of our model, we downsample the images in Cityscapes to a resolution of 256×512256512256\\times 512 and the ADE20K bedroom by resizing all its images to a standard size of 384×512384512384\\times 512 while training. For both the datasets, the input image is taken as centre crop of resized image with half the height and width. Implementation details\nWe train PSPNet  on Cityscapes as well as ADE20K bedroom subset at the resolution discussed earlier and use them to generate segmentation maps of the input (cropped) images. We adopt cGAN based generator for stage 1, stage 2 and stage 4 models similar to SPADE [ref]32. In stage 2 we replace t​a​n​h𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎtanh with s​i​g​m​o​i​d𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑜𝑖𝑑sigmoid activation in the final layer to produce one hot encodings and semantic label map. For the training of stage 2, in our final objective (Eq. 1), we use λF​L=5subscript𝜆𝐹𝐿5\\lambda_{FL}=5, λC​E=5subscript𝜆𝐶𝐸5\\lambda_{CE}=5 and γ=5𝛾5\\gamma=5. For the training of stage4, we use the same weights for loss terms as [ref]32, i.e. λF​M=10,λV​G​G=10​ and ​λK​L​D=0.05formulae-sequencesubscript𝜆𝐹𝑀10subscript𝜆𝑉𝐺𝐺10 and subscript𝜆𝐾𝐿𝐷0.05\\lambda_{FM}=10,\\lambda_{VGG}=10\\text{ and }\\lambda_{KLD}=0.05 in Eq 3. We use ADAM solver  with β1=0subscript𝛽10\\beta_{1}=0 and β2=0.9subscript𝛽20.9\\beta_{2}=0.9 for both the stages. The training is done for 200 epochs. Baselines\nWe compare our method with various baselines both in quantitative (with FID and Similarity in Object Co-Occurrence metrics) and qualitative terms. We compare the proposed approach with five baselines ‘Outpainting-SRN’ , ‘Boundless’ [ref]37, ‘SPGNet’ [ref]35, ‘SPGNet++’ and partial convolutions (‘PConv’) . ‘PConv’  was originally proposed for image inpainting, like in [ref]37, we adapt it for the task of image out-painting in our setting. We also use SPGNet [ref]35 as a baseline since it also operates in semantic label space but for image inpainting task; but we adapt it for out-painting task. We create a modified version of SPGNet, SPGNet++ using [ref]32 base generator and multiscale discriminator used in our method while retaining the exact training procedure and loss functions used in [ref]35 and use it to compare with our method. We train these baselines on our kind of input-crop (25% of the original image). Evaluation Metrics\nTo compare the perpetual quality of the generated RGB image we use Frêchet Inception distance (FID)  metric. However, since we additionally focus on generation of new objects in the extrapolated region, we also evaluate the results in semantic label space using similarity in object co-occurrence (SOCC) statistics . FID: It is a standard metric used to calculate the fidelity of GAN generated images and provides a measure of the distance between the generated images and the real images. SOCC:\nThe co-occurrence measure for two classes casubscript𝑐𝑎c_{a} and cbsubscript𝑐𝑏c_{b} can be calculated as the ratio of the number of times they occur together to the total number of times one of them occurs in the entire dataset. Let Ncasubscript𝑁subscript𝑐𝑎N_{c_{a}} represent the frequency of a class casubscript𝑐𝑎c_{a} in the input image, and Nca​bsubscript𝑁subscript𝑐𝑎𝑏N_{c_{ab}} be the number of times there is atleast one instance of class cbsubscript𝑐𝑏c_{b} present in the extrapolated region, given casubscript𝑐𝑎c_{a} is present in the input. The probability of co-occurrence p​(ca,cb)𝑝subscript𝑐𝑎subscript𝑐𝑏p(c_{a},c_{b}) of the two classes can be calculated as Nca​bNcasubscript𝑁subscript𝑐𝑎𝑏subscript𝑁subscript𝑐𝑎\\frac{N_{c_{ab}}}{N_{c_{a}}}. The similarity in co-occurrence probability of a pair of classes between generated outputs and the training set, therefore, reflects the extent of faithful emulation of scene distribution. The similarity in co-occurrence for class c2subscript𝑐2c_{2} in the output to the training set, given c1subscript𝑐1c_{1} is present in the output, is defined as s​(ca,cb)=1−|pt​r​a​i​n​(ca,cb)−pg​e​n​(ca,cb)|𝑠subscript𝑐𝑎subscript𝑐𝑏1subscript𝑝𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛subscript𝑐𝑎subscript𝑐𝑏subscript𝑝𝑔𝑒𝑛subscript𝑐𝑎subscript𝑐𝑏s(c_{a},c_{b})=1-|p_{train}(c_{a},c_{b})-p_{gen}(c_{a},c_{b})|. The closer this score is to 1, the greater is the similarity between the outputs of the model and the training set images.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: at the resolution discussed earlier and use them to generate segmentation maps of the input (cropped) images.
