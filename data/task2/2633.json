      "content": "Paper Title: Length Scale Control in Topology Optimization using Fourier Enhanced Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFirst we consider four benchmark topology optimization problems illustrated in the first column of Figure 9, together with the desired volume fraction. The default mesh size is 60√ó30603060\\times 30. The second column illustrates the topologies obtained using the popular 88-line implementation of SIMP [ref]50, with a filter radius of 1.4, that directly controls the minimum length scale, avoiding checker-board patterns ; no additional length-scale control was imposed. The final compliance values and the number of finite element iterations are also listed. The third column illustrates the topologies obtained using TOuNN , using a neural net size of 4√ó204204\\times 20 on the same mesh, without length scale control. The fourth column are the topologies obtained through the proposed Fourier-TOuNN algorithm, with lm‚Äãi‚Äãn=6subscriptùëôùëöùëñùëõ6l_{min}=6 and lm‚Äãa‚Äãx=30subscriptùëôùëöùëéùë•30l_{max}=30. As one can observe, the topologies computed through Fourier-TOuNN exhibit thin features, and the compliance values are lower (better) than both SIMP and TOuNN. We note that the plots in the third and fourth column are at a larger resolution. This stems from the fact that, after optimization, the density values are sampled on a much finer grid (than that used for FE) to extract fine geometry as explained in Fig. 8; this comes with no additional computational cost. The total computational time for the examples in Figure 9 varied between 4-6 seconds proportional to the number of FE iterations; this is consistent with other mesh-based implementations such as [ref]50. Further, averaging across the examples, we observed that, in Fourier-TOuNN, FE accounts for 41%percent4141\\%, forward propagation accounts for 20%percent2020\\%, backward propagation accounts for 27%percent2727\\%, and the remaining 13%percent1313\\% is for miscellaneous operations. This is in contrast to SIMP implementations where FE accounts for a significant portion of the computation, for instance about 96%percent9696\\% as reported in . Reducing the non-FE overhead in Fourier-TOuNN via code refactoring and just-in-time compilations  remains to be explored.  Next, we consider a simple tensile bar problem, (over a mesh of size 60√ó30603060\\times 30) as illustrated in Figure 10. The elements on the right edge are explicitly retained, while an extrude constraint along xùë•x is imposed as discussed in . Various length scale intervals are imposed as illustrated; the topologies and compliances obtained are consistent with expectations.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: 9, together with the desired volume fraction. The default mesh size is 60√ó30603060\\times 30. The second column illustrates the topologies obtained using the popular 88-line implementation of SIMP [ref]50, with a filter radius of 1.4, that directly controls the minimum length scale, avoiding checker-board patterns ; no additional length-scale control was imposed.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
