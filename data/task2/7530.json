      "content": "Paper Title: Objective and Interpretable Breast Cosmesis Evaluation with Attention Guided Denoising Diffusion Anomaly Detection Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFigureÂ 3 presents the anomaly scores estimated by our proposed AG-DDAD model for each cosmesis group. The graph clearly demonstrates a consistent pattern of increasing anomaly scores as the cosmesis quality declines. The median scores (with interquartile ranges) for the excellent, good, fair, and poor groups were as follows: median 6.628 (interquartile range [IQR], 6.119-7.412) for the excellent group, median 7.175 (IQR, 6.412-7.839) for the good group, median 8.427 (IQR, 7.534-9.383) for the fair group, and median 9.052 (IQR, 8.001-10.520) for the poor group. Significantly, there were notable differences in scores observed between these groups. Interestingly, the disparity in scores between the groups with good cosmesis quality (excellent versus good) was relatively minor. However, a substantial distinction was observed between the good and poor cosmesis groups (excellent, good vs. fair, poor). These findings suggest that our model exhibits promising potential as an anomaly detection tool, specifically for identifying cases of poor cosmesis. \n\n\nMethods\nAUC (95% CI)\n\nFeature-based\n\n\nPaDiM \n0.556 (0.448 - 0.664)\n\nDFM \n0.494 (0.462 - 0.527)\n\nSTFPM [ref]46\n0.685 (0.589 - 0.780)\n\nFastFlow [ref]49\n0.586 (0.481 - 0.691)\n\nCSFlow \n0.644 (0.546 - 0.743)\n\nCFA \n0.511 (0.399 - 0.624)\n\nPatchCore [ref]36\n0.710 (0.619 - 0.800)\n\nReverse Distillation \n0.652 (0.552 - 0.751)\n\nReconstruction-based\n\n\nGanomaly \n0.730 (0.642 - 0.817)\n\nDRAEM \n0.676 (0.581 - 0.770)\n\nDDPM \n0.815 (0.742 - 0.887)\n\nDDIM \n0.866 (0.804 - 0.928)\n\nDDAD-10 \n0.859 (0.794 - 0.925)\n\nPropsoed (AG-DDAD)\n0.921 (0.876 - 0.965)\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: potential as an anomaly detection tool, specifically for identifying cases of poor cosmesis. \n\n\nMethods\nAUC (95% CI)\n\nFeature-based\n\n\nPaDiM \n0.556 (0.448 - 0.664)\n\nDFM \n0.494 (0.462 - 0.527)\n\nSTFPM [ref]46\n0.685 (0.589 - 0.780)\n\nFastFlow [ref]49\n0.586 (0.481 - 0.691)\n\nCSFlow \n0.644 (0.546 - 0.743)\n\nCFA \n0.511 (0.399 - 0.624)\n\nPatchCore [ref]36\n0.710 (0.619 - 0.800)\n\nReverse Distillation \n0.652\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
