      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge-Aware Language Model Pretraining\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section describes the techniques we use to probe the knowledge capability incorporated in the weights of pretrained language models, including LAMA Knowledge Probing¬†[ref]7, Edge Probing¬† , and the zero-shot performance on downstream tasks¬†[ref]3. Knowledge Probe. Petroni et al.¬†[ref]7 developed the LAMA knowledge probing test which evaluates whether the language model can predict the factually correct token in ‚Äúfill-the-blank‚Äù cloze statements. For example, the model is considered to include the corresponding commonsense knowledge ‚ÄúisCapbleOf‚Äù if it can predict the token ‚Äúfly‚Äù or ‚Äúeat‚Äù for the cloze test ‚Äúbirds can      ‚Äù. The LAMA cloze statements were semi-manually constructed from four knowledge sources: Google-RE (Wikipedia Relations), T-REx (Wikidata Relations), ConceptNet (Commonsense Relations), and SQuAD (Questions on Wikipedia). The knowledge graph triples were transformed to statements using manually defined templates. The SQuAD questions are manually rewritten to statements.\nLAMA only keeps cloze statements where the missing word is a single token w.r.t the tokenizer of the model in question, to avoid the influence of decoding. Sometimes the missing word can appear in the middle of a sentence, but for auto-regressive language models such as GPT-2 and Transformer-XL¬†[ref]27, LAMA only evaluates on those at the end. We refer to their paper for more details¬†[ref]7. Edge Probe. Besides looking at the token-level predictions, Tenney et al.¬†  develop the edge probing‚Äù tasks to study the information (e.g., syntactic, semantic, or long range structures) in the learned hidden representations. Similar to the evaluation protocol in representation learning¬†, the edge probing technique uses the PLM‚Äôs hidden representations on one or multiple text spans (e.g., hi:i+ksubscript‚Ñé:ùëñùëñùëòh_{i:i+k}) as fixed feature representations to linear classifiers on various linguistic/semantic tasks ‚Äì A better performance indicates stronger knowledge capability of the PLM in the corresponding task. In total eight core NLP tasks are included in edge probing¬†: part-of-speech tagging (POS), constituent labeling (Consts.), dependency parsing (Deps.), named entity typing (Entities), semantic role labeling (SRL), coreference (Coref.), semantic probe-role (SPR), and relation classification (Relations). The first four tasks are considered more local, syntactical, while the later four involve ‚Äúhigher-order‚Äù and/or long-range phenomena¬†. Zero-Shot Evaluation. Radford et al.¬†[ref]3 demonstrate that their GPT-2 language models can be viewed as ‚Äúunsupervised multitask learners‚Äù that perform downstream tasks without using any task specific pretraining or fine-tuning¬†[ref]3.\nTheir deep GPT-2 models, though far from fully-supervised PLM‚Äôs performance, also provide meaningful zero-shot results on several downstream tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and machine translation. These zero-shot results show promise that one centralized deep model can conduct many real world tasks without requiring much human annotation or task-specific finetuning. The new GPT-3 is another step in this direction, but at the cost of 175 Billion parameters¬†). In the short-term, this zero-shot evaluation is a good strategy to directly evaluate the knowledge captured in language model parameters. We focus on the zero-shot QA setting in Radford et al.¬†[ref]3, and include all the three datasets used by Roberts et al.¬†: Trivia QA¬†, Natural Questions¬†, and Web Questions¬†. In zero-shot setting, the PLMs are directly asked to generate the answer for the question; no task related information is provided for training, nor any context documents or knowledge graph of these questions are used. All the knowledge has to come from the model parameters optimized on the pretraining corpus alone. The only additional information available to the PLMs is the task format as context during inference. Several example question-answer pairs were concatenated to the front of the question, to notify the model to generate answers¬†[ref]3. In total we use eight manually written dummy QA pairs (listed in appendix), e.g. ‚ÄúQuestion: how many wheels does a semi truck have? Answer: 18‚Äù, and prepend them to each question of the testing dataset.\nAll our models take the input in the format of and generates an answer without any additional training besides knowledge-aware pretraining.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: This section describes the techniques we use to probe the knowledge capability incorporated in the weights of pretrained language models, including LAMA Knowledge Probing¬†[ref]7, Edge Probing¬† , and the zero-shot performance on downstream tasks¬†[ref]3.
