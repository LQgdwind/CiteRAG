Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Social GAN [ref]14 proposes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to predict multi-modal trajectory autoregressively. SoPhie [ref]35 also uses a GAN and extends it by attention modules to incorporate other agents and scene context. Conditional Flow VAE (CF-VAE) [ref]4 proposes a conditional normalizing flow based Variational Auto-Encoder that models future uncertainty without disentangling underlying factors. Conditional Generative Neural System (CGNS)  proposes variational divergence minimization in latent space to learn feasible regions for future trajectories. P2TIRL  proposes a grid based trajectory forecasting method learnt using maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning. DESIRE  also proposes an inverse reinforcement learning approach for prediction by planning. SimAug  is a recently proposed method that uses additional adversarially generated 3D multi-view data for adapating to novel viewpoints in forecasting and improve the Multiverse model . PECNet  is the prior state-of-the art method on short-term trajectory prediction on the Stanford Drone Dataset. They propose to use goal-conditioning but does not account for multi-modality in the path to the goal. TNT  closely improves upon PECNet‚Äôs performance for K=5ùêæ5K=5 samples on SDD and is the prior state-of-the-art in that setting. Trajectron++  proposes a recurrent graph based forecasting model incorporating dynamic constrains such as other moving agents and scene information. This work also hold the prior state-of-the art on ETH/UCY short-term trajectory prediction benchmark.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: We benchmarks against several state-of-the-art methods across both short and long term trajectory forecasting settings which we describe briefly.
