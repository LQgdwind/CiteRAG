      "content": "Paper Title: Augmentation-Free Graph Contrastive Learning of Invariant-Discriminative Representations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo comprehensively and fairly evaluate the performance of iGCL, we selected three categories of methods as baselines: unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and contrastive learning. Unsupervised learning baselines include Raw Feats and Node2Vec [ref]16. Raw Feats indicates classifying nodes using the logistic regression classifier with raw node features as input. Node2vec indicates classifying nodes using the logistic regression classifier with the representations generated by Node2vec as input. Supervised learning baselines include GCN [ref]36, GAT [ref]37, and GraphSAGE . GCN dramatically reduces the computational complexity of graph convolution through simplification operations and renormalization trick and iteratively extracts informative representations in a layer-stacked manner. GAT introduces the self-attention mechanism to GNNs to adaptively assign weights to neighboring nodes during aggregation in a data-driven manner. GraphSAGE proposes a sampling approach that allows GNNs to adapt to large-scale graphs. Contrastive learning baselines include DGI , MVGRL , GRACE , GCA , BGRL , CCA-SSG , and AFGRL . DGI and MVGRL train models by contrasting node-level representations with graph-level representations. Following the idea of SimCLR, GRACE and GCA learn node representations by pulling the representations of the same nodes in two augmented graphs closer and pushing them away from each other. Inspired by BYOL, neither BGRL nor AFGRL need negative samples to avoid a trivial solution. CCA-SSG proposes a loss function based on canonical correlation analysis to avoid a parameterized mutual information estimator, additional projector, asymmetric structures, and negative samples.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: of iGCL, we selected three categories of methods as baselines: unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and contrastive learning. Unsupervised learning baselines include Raw Feats and Node2Vec [ref]16. Raw Feats indicates classifying nodes using the logistic regression classifier with raw node features as input. Node2vec indicates classifying nodes using the logistic regression classifier\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
