      "content": "Paper Title: Physical Computing: A Category Theoretic Perspective on Physical Computation and System Compositionality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHorsman et al.’s Abstraction/Representation (AR) theory, inspired by quantum computation, addresses a fundamental question in computational theory: when do physical systems compute? They propose a concept called the “compute cycle”  . In this theory, physical computing is conceptualized as using a physical system to predict the evolution of an abstract representation. Central to AR theory is the utilization of commuting diagrams. These diagrams represent a bi-directional mapping between a physical system and its abstract counterpart. For instance, a physical system p𝑝p is abstractly represented as mpsubscript𝑚𝑝m_{p} through the modelling representation relation RTsubscript𝑅𝑇R_{T} of theory T𝑇T. The abstract dynamics CTsubscript𝐶𝑇C_{T} evolve the abstract state mpsubscript𝑚𝑝m_{p} to mp′subscript𝑚superscript𝑝′m_{p^{\\prime}}, paralleled by the evolution of the physical system p𝑝p to state p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} by physical dynamics H​(p)𝐻𝑝H(p). This framework offers a method to visualize and understand the interaction between physical and abstract computational processes (as shown in Fig.1). AR theory posits that a physical system is computing when the evolution of its abstract representation corresponds with\nabstract representation of the evolved physical system itself. This theory, articulated by Horsman et al., relies on representational mapping between physical and abstract domains, symbolized through RTsubscript𝑅𝑇R_{T} and RT~~subscript𝑅𝑇\\tilde{R_{T}}, and illustrated using commutative diagrams. However, AR risks falling into the same conceptual pitfalls as Putnam’s “mapping account,” 333Later, referred to as the “simple mapping account” by . The simple mapping account requires two conditions in order for a physical system P to compute the descriptions in C :\n\n\n1.\n\nA mapping from the computational description (C) to a physical description (state P)\n\n2.\n\nstates and transitions of the physical system (P) should mirror the computational (C) states and transitions\n\n which suggests that computation occurs in any physical system with a one-to-one mapping to a computational process   [ref]50. All what is needed to satisfy this condition is for the micro-states of the system to match the transitions specified by machine table (equivalent of the abstract computation) on hand. This perspective could lead to an overly broad definition of computational systems, lacking specific criteria to discern true computational processes.\nAn schematic of the simple mapping account is represented in 2 showing the correspondence between the abstract and the physical domains. The “simple mapping account” posited by Putnam is challenged by its generality, as it implies that any physical system could be considered a Turing machine due to the vast number of its possible micro-states. This leads to a form of pancomputationalism, where virtually all physical systems could be seen as implementing some form of computation Unpublished, personal communication .. Such a “weak mapping” does not provide stringent criteria for physical-computational equivalence, opening the door to overly inclusive definitions of computation. Dennett’s suggestion of reverse engineering mapping as a means to discern genuine computational patterns aims to move beyond the overly broad interpretations of computational systems 3, but the key challenge remains in the overly general mapping of physical states to computational processes. Mapping accounts, critical in understanding computation, have evolved with varying philosophical emphases. Versions like simple , causal , counterfactual , dispositional 4, syntactic , semantic , and mechanistic  were all developed to interpret the computational aspect of the human mind rather than any general computing physical system. In contrast, AR theory  was devised for unconventional computing, differing from traditional accounts by not confining abstract representations to mental aspects 555For an in-depth review of different mapping accounts, see . For a review on relations between AR and different mapping accounts, see .. Weak forms of the mapping account (as referred to by ) only require an arbitrary physico-computational association for the first condition to hold. That the association between a given physical system and a computation can be entirely based on mapping, opens the gate to pancomputationalism . AR theory relies on this physico-computational mapping; however, it binds the mapping to a representational frame. As a result, according to AR, there is no computation without such representation. This “representational” view of concrete computation is contrary to the simple  and mechanistic  mapping accounts, and more in-line with the syntactic  and semantic . What sets apart AR from syntactic  and semantic  accounts is that AR deviates from requiring the representational entity to be an aspect or product of mind or for the representations to be meaningful . In fact, AR does not put any restrictions on the abstract (representational) mapping of the physical state . AR theory’s unique approach sets it apart from “philosophical” account of concrete computation, but also presents challenges in defining computational activity, which we aim to resolve through a category-theoretic functorial perspective.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: physical system (P) should mirror the computational (C) states and transitions\n\n which suggests that computation occurs in any physical system with a one-to-one mapping to a computational process   [ref]50.
