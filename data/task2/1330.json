      "content": "Paper Title: Alpha-Refine: Boosting Tracking Performance by Precise Bounding Box Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEarly Box Estimation. Early box estimation methods are mainly scale estimation,\nwhich can be summarized into two categories:\nmultiple-scale search and sampling-then-regression strategies.\nMost correlation-filter-based trackers     and SiamFC  adopt the former strategy.\nSpecifically, these trackers construct search regions with different sizes, then compute correlation with the template,\nand finally determine the size of the target as the size-level where the highest response locates.\nMultiple-scale search is coarse and time-consuming due to its fixed-aspect-ratio prediction and heavy image pyramid\noperation.\nAnother type of method first generates several bounding box samples, then uses some methods to choose\nthe best one, and finally apply regression on it to obtain more accurate results.\nSINT , MDNet  and RT-MDNet 6 are three representative trackers\nthat exploit this approach. Modern Box Estimation.\nAs deep learning techniques become mature, several high-performance scale\nestimation approaches are developed and can be categorized into the following classes: RPN-based   , Mask-based , IoU-based [ref]7 [ref]2,\nand Anchor-free-based  .\nRPN-based methods learn a region proposal network , which determines whether the current anchor\ncontains the target and makes refinement to the target simultaneously.\nSiameseRPN-series trackers    utilize the RPN-based\nmechanism as the core component and achieve great success in recent years.\nMask representation is more accurate, and the ability to predict mask is quite\nbeneficial to precise box estimation.\nSiamMask  and D3S  belong to this class, which obtain higher precision\nthan the Siamese tracker that can only predict boxes.\nIoU-based approaches learn a network to predict the overlap between candidate boxes and groundtruth.\nDuring the inference phase, this strategy optimizes candidate boxes by gradient-ascent,\nand therefore obtains more precise results.\nATOM [ref]7 and DiMP [ref]2 fully exploit this method and surpass traditional\ncorrelation-filter trackers by a large margin.\nIn the past years, anchor-free philosophy has become quite popular in the object detection\nfield  9 8 .\nSiamFC++  introduces this structure into object tracking field and therefore\nachieves state-of-the-art performance.\nThe CGACD method  designs a corner-based box estimation for object tracking which wisely adopts soft-argmax to decode the corner heat map into box coordinates. The corner-based version of Alpha-Refine\nadopts a similar box representation, and experiments demonstrate that this design retains more precise\nspatial information for a refinement module. Refinement Modules.\nMany state-of-the-art trackers 0 2 [ref]7 [ref]2 [ref]21 apply a multiple-stage\ntracking strategy to obtain accurate and robust results.\nThis approach first locates the target coarsely and then utilizes a refinement module to refine results from\nthe previous stage.\nSPM 0 and Siamese Cascaded RPN 2 adopt a light-weight relation\nnetwork  and stacked RPNs , respectively, as the refinement module\nto further increase trackers’ discriminative power and precision.\nHowever, the two refinement modules have to be trained together with their previous Siamese tracker\nin an end-to-end manner; this procedure limits their flexibility of combining with other base trackers.\nATOM [ref]7 and DiMP [ref]2 first use an online classification module to locate the target\nand then draw some random samples around it.\nFinally, they deploy a modified IoU-Net 5 to\nmaximize the overlap between these samples and groundtruth to obtain more precise bounding boxes.\nThis modified IoU-Net can be trained separately from the base tracker.\nThus, the IoU-Net has good transferability but its precision can still be greatly improved.\nNotably, the winners of VOT2019 [ref]21 utilize\nSiamMask  as a refinement module [ref]21.\nSimilar to IoU-Net 5 mentioned before, SiamMask  can be combined\nwith any base tracker.\nHowever, SiamMask is designed as an independent tracker rather than a refinement module,\nwhich is not suitable and not economical to refine other trackers.\nConsidering previous refinement modules’ weak transferability and limited accuracy,\nwe propose a novel, flexible, and accurate refinement module named Alpha-Refine.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: deep learning techniques become mature, several high-performance scale\nestimation approaches are developed and can be categorized into the following classes: RPN-based   , Mask-based , IoU-based [ref]7 [ref]2,\nand Anchor-free-based  .\nRPN-based methods learn a region proposal network , which determines whether the current anchor\ncontains the target and makes refinement to the target\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
