      "content": "Paper Title: Weakly Supervised Scene Text Detection using Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the past years we have seen a tremendous technical advancement in computer vision algorithms [ref]1  . But this success does not come without a cost, namely the need for large amounts of labeled training data . Among computer vision tasks, annotation for text detection is one of the most complex forms, as it requires bounding box labels to mark the exact text locations in the image.\nAccording to  it takes on average 39 seconds to label images containing multiple texts with tight bounding boxes, a 20-fold increase over annotation for classification. Scene Text Detection (STD), is known as the method of determining\nthe locations of text in natural scene images , e.g., on storefronts or street signs, often called ”text in the wild” . Its use cases include content-based image search, automatic navigation (including robotics) [ref]8, instant translation  as well as the digitization of document archives . In most cases STD is used as a preliminary step for text recognition [ref]8. Narrowing down the search space in natural images and proposing accurate text regions is crucial for recognition algorithms to perform well. STD is a notoriously hard problem. One must distinguish it from the much more structured problem of optical character recognition (OCR) in scanned documents [ref]8. In contrast to document text, scene text has no underlying formatting, can occur in a variety of sizes, fonts, colors and orientations and be scattered across the image [ref]8 . Real-world scenes also come with very diverse backgrounds, requiring large amounts of data for algorithms to learn from [ref]8. For all specialized applications, for which public datasets or pretrained models do not suffice, this data has to be manually annotated. Many supervised STD methods have been developed in the past (see II). Most of these approaches follow a bottom-up approach using region proposals . Only some top-down methods involving reinforcement learning (RL) have been tested. This approach not only forms an alternative to the standard route taken by most researchers, which reduces the number of region proposals required , but also brings the advantage that it relies on a single scalar reward. This reward can be estimated and thus opens the door to weaker forms of supervision. We combine this idea with a neural network introduced by Bartz et al. [ref]14, which rates the RL detections (see IV).\nWeak supervision is a paradigm where noisy labels are applied to otherwise unlabeled data points. These labels are called weak as they are not guaranteed to be ground-truth, but come from heuristics or estimates. When the model is taught properly what good text detections look like, it can serve as an automated annotator for unlabeled images.\nOur experimental results with this model can be found in VII and suggested future improvements in VIII. We release our code and models to the community 111https://github.com/emanuel-metzenthin/RL-scene-text-detection.\n We make the following contributions in this paper: We enhance an existing supervised RL approach to STD and show contrary to prior research that high detection rates are possible using this method. We combine the weak supervision technique for object detection proposed by [ref]14 with our RL method and show that weakly supervised STD is feasible this way. We perform semi-supervision using synthetic labeled data and weakly supervised real-world data\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: In the past years we have seen a tremendous technical advancement in computer vision algorithms [ref]1  .
