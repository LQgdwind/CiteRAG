      "content": "Paper Title: DiscrimLoss: A Universal Loss for Hard Samples and Incorrect Samples Discrimination\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTask and dataset. Image classification is to identify the target correctly given the images with specific classes, which belongs to a task in CV.\nWe first test the effectiveness of DiscrimLoss by performing image classification experiments on four benchmarks: MNIST¬†, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100¬†, and Clothing1M¬†[ref]25.\nWe briefly summarize the statistics of four datasets in Table¬†II.\nBesides, we inject label noise into the first three datasets.\nFor MNIST, the noise rates are set to 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%. For CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, the noise proportions are specified as 0%, 20%, 40%, and 60%. Baselines. For comparison, six categories of baselines are involved.\n(1) The model trained with vanilla cross-entropy (CE).\n(2) Multi-network learning methods, addressing the issue of prediction error accumulation in single network learning: (i) Co-teaching¬† maintains two networks. Each network aims to teach the other with the small-loss principle; (ii) Co-teaching++¬† comprises two networks and keeps prediction disagreement data. Small-loss data is picked and used to cross-train two DNNs; (iii) JoCoR¬† trains two networks by the joint loss with co-regularization to make predictions. The objective is to reduce the diversity of the two networks during training.\n(3) Sample reweighting methods: (i) MentorNet¬†, which requires an extra neural network to learn a curriculum so as to alleviate overfitting on incorrect data; (ii) Data Parameters¬†[ref]17 learns two types of learnable parameters to realize dynamic curriculum learning; (iii)\nSuperLoss¬†[ref]20 learns a curriculum by reweighting samples according to sample difficulty. Each sample weight can be calculated by the respective model loss.\n(4) Loss correction methods: Forward & Backward¬†, which multiplies the model prediction by a stochastic matrix TùëáT or an inverse of TùëáT and achieves loss correction.\n(5) Regularization-based methods:\n(i) SLN¬†, which does label perturbation in SGD, provides an implicit regularization effect for training overparameterized DNNs;\n(ii) CDR¬†, which divides all model parameters into critical and non-critical ones, performs different update rules for different types of parameters to hinder the memorization of noisy labels.\n(6) Re-designing more robust loss methods: CurriculumLoss¬†, which proposes a loss to achieve curriculum sample selection.\nMore details are in Appendix¬†B. Implementation and Results.\nTo compare with the relevant state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, for MNIST, we train a LeNet  following the experiment settings in [ref]20 for 20 epochs.\nFor CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we use the WideResNet-28-10 model with the same experiment settings as those in [ref]17 for 120 epochs.333https://github.com/apple/ml-data-parameters\nWe utilize the SGD optimizer with batchsize 128, momentum 0.9, weight decay 5e-4, initial learning rate 0.1 for these three datasets. For CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, the learning rate decreased to 0.01 after 80 epochs and 0.001 after 100 epochs.\nFor Clothing1M, we train an Imagenet-pretrained ResNet-50 using the SGD optimizer with momentum 0.9, weight decay 1e-3, and batchsize 32 following the common settings in  and  for 10 epochs. The initial learning rate is 1e-3 and decreased to 1e-4 after 5 epochs.444https://github.com/chenpf1025/SLN MNIST.\nAs shown in Table¬†III,\nDiscrimLoss consistently outperforms the baseline methods under different noise proportions on MNIST. In addition, with the increase of the noise level, DiscrimLoss can achieve a statistically significant gain of 0.11%, 0.12%, 0.24%, 0.62% over the SOTA approach, which confirms our motivation that DiscrimLoss can effectively discriminate between hard samples and incorrect samples.\n CIFAR-10 & CIFAR-100.\nFor CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we observe a similar conclusion, as shown in Table¬†IV.\nMoreover, we further explore the effectiveness of DiscrimLoss in separating hard samples from incorrect ones. Fig.¬†5 demonstrates the distribution statistics of\nnormalized losses from samples trained with cross-entropy or DiscrimLoss at 40-th, 80-th, and 120-th epochs.\nWe discover that DiscrimLoss can effectively distinguish incorrect samples from correct ones with an increase in training epochs by ‚Äúpushing‚Äù\nlosses of correct samples to the minimum and incorrect samples to the maximum.\n Clothing1M.\nClothing1M is a large-scale benchmark (1MùëÄM training images) with real-world noise. The number of images of each class is unbalanced, and we experiment with the noisy-class-balanced sampling, following the settings in¬†. As shown in Table¬†V, DiscrimLoss consistently outperforms all baselines, which indicates that DiscrimLoss can effectively discriminate among samples with various difficulties for instances within a challenging real-world noisy environment. Robust loss as the inner loss.\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of DiscrimLoss on top of a robust loss, we take SuperLoss as the robust loss and place DiscrimLoss on top of it (i.e., SuperLoss-DiscrimLoss in Table¬†V).\nAs shown in Table¬†V, SuperLoss-DiscrimLoss further achieves higher test accuracy compared to SuperLoss and DiscrimLoss,\nwhich indicates DiscrimLoss can boost robust losses effectively by appending on top of them.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: classes, which belongs to a task in CV.\nWe first test the effectiveness of DiscrimLoss by performing image classification experiments on four benchmarks: MNIST¬†, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100¬†, and Clothing1M¬†[ref]25.\nWe briefly summarize the statistics of four datasets in Table¬†II.\nBesides, we inject label noise into the first three datasets.\nFor MNIST, the noise rates are set to 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
