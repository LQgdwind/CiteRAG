      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Deep Probabilistic Approach for Partial Point Cloud Registration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPoint-Level Methods.\nPoint-level registration approaches first extract point-wise features, then establish point-to-point correspondences through feature matching, followed by outlier rejection and robust estimation of the rigid transformation.\nNumerous works, such as FCGF  and RGM [ref]17, focus on extracting discriminative features for geometric correspondences.\nFor the correspondence prediction,\nDCP [ref]44, RPMNet , and REGTR  perform feature matching by integrating the Sinkhorn algorithm or Transformer  into a network to generate soft correspondences from local features. IDAM  incorporates both geometric and distance features into the iterative matching process.\nTo reject outliers, DGR  and 3DRegNet  use networks to estimate the inliers. Predator  and PRNet  focus on detecting points in the overlap region and utilizing their features to generate matches. Keypoint-free methods    first downsample the point clouds into super-points and then match them by examining whether their neighborhoods (patch) overlap. Though achieving remarkable performance, most of these methods rely on large amounts of ground-truth transformations, as inaccessible or expensive as such annotation may get.\nThis said, the ground-truth geometric labels could potentially be obtained from full 3D reconstruction pipelines ,\nbut these require delicate parameter tuning, partial human supervision, and extra sensory information such as GPS.\nAs a result, the success of learning-based techniques has been limited to a handful of datasets with ground-truth annotations. Distribution-Level Methods.\nDistribution-level methods model the point clouds as probability distributions, often via the use of GMMs, and perform alignment either by employing a correlation-based or an EM-based optimization framework.\nThe correlation-based methods  [ref]53 first build GMM probability distributions for both the source and target point clouds. Then, the transformation is estimated by minimizing a metric or divergence between the distributions. However, these methods lead to nonlinear optimization problems with nonconvex constraints . Unlike correlation-based methods, the\nEM-based approaches, such as JRMPC , CPD , and FilterReg , represent the geometry of one point cloud using a GMM distribution over 3D Euclidean space.\nThe transformation is then calculated by fitting another point cloud to the GMM distribution under the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) framework.\nThese methods are robust to noise and density variation [ref]53. Most of them utilize robust discrepancies to reduce the influence of outliers by greedily aligning the largest possible fraction of points while being tolerant to a small number of outliers. However, if outliers dominate, the greedy behavior of these methods easily emphasizes outliers, leading to degraded registration results .\nConsidering these factors, we formulate registration in a novel partial distribution matching framework, where we only seek to partially match the distributions. Unsupervised Point Cloud Registration.\nTo handle ground-truth labeling issues, great efforts       have been devoted to unsupervised deep point cloud registration. The existing methods mainly lie in auto-encoders    with a reconstruction loss or contrastive learning    with data augmentation.\nAlthough encouraging results have been achieved, some limitations remain to be addressed.\nFirstly, they depend on the point-level loss, such as Chamfer distance in auto-encoder , finding it difficult to handle large-scale scenarios due to computational complexity.\nSecondly, many pipelines  apply fixed/handcrafted data augmentation to generate transformations or correspondences, leading to sub-optimal learning.\nThis is because they cannot fully use the cross information of partially overlapping point clouds without geometric labels, and the shape complexity of the samples is ignored in the fixed augmentation .\nTo overcome these limitations, we provide a distribution consistency-based unsupervised method, which utilizes the distribution-level loss to reduce the computational complexity. Even without using any data augmentation, the proposed method is still suitable and available.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: then establish point-to-point correspondences through feature matching, followed by outlier rejection and robust estimation of the rigid transformation.\nNumerous works, such as FCGF  and RGM [ref]17, focus on extracting discriminative features for geometric correspondences.\nFor the correspondence prediction,\nDCP [ref]44, RPMNet , and REGTR  perform feature matching by integrating the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
