      "content": "Paper Title: EMP: Effective Multidimensional Persistence for Graph Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMultipersistence theory is under intense research because of its promise to significantly improve the performance and robustness properties of single persistence theory. While single persistence theory obtains the topological fingerprint of single filtration, a multidimensional filtration with more than one parameter should deliver a much finer summary of the data to be used with ML models. However, because of the technical issues in the theory, multipersistence has not reached to its potential yet and remains largely unexplored by the ML community. Here, we provide a short summary of these technical issues. For further details, ¬†gives a nice outline of current state of the theory and major obstacles. In single persistence, the threshold space {Œ±i}subscriptùõºùëñ\\{\\alpha_{i}\\} being a subset of ‚Ñù‚Ñù\\mathbb{R}, is totally ordered, i.e., birth time¬†<<¬†death time for any topological feature appearing in the filtration sequence {Œîi}subscriptŒîùëñ\\{\\Delta_{i}\\}. By using this property, it was shown that ‚Äúbarcode decomposition‚Äù is well-defined in single persistence theory in the 1950s [Krull-Schmidt-Azumaya Theorem¬†‚ÄìTheorem 4.2]. This decomposition makes the persistence module M={Hk‚Äã(Œîi)}i=1NùëÄsuperscriptsubscriptsubscriptùêªùëòsubscriptŒîùëñùëñ1ùëÅM=\\{H_{k}(\\Delta_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N} uniquely decomposable into barcodes. This barcode decomposition is exactly what we call a Persistence Diagram. However, when one goes to higher dimensions, i.e. d=2ùëë2d=2, then the threshold set {(Œ±i,Œ≤j)}subscriptùõºùëñsubscriptùõΩùëó\\{(\\alpha_{i},\\beta_{j})\\} is no longer totally ordered, but becomes partially ordered (Poset). In other words, some indices have ordering relation (1,2)<(4,7)1247(1,2)<(4,7), while some do not, e.g., (2,3) vs. (1,5). Hence, if one has a multipersistence grid {Œîi‚Äãj}subscriptŒîùëñùëó\\{\\Delta_{ij}\\},\nwe no longer can talk about birth time or death time as there is no order any more. Furthermore, Krull-Schmidt-Azumaya Theorem is no longer true for upper dimensions¬†‚ÄìSection 4.2. Hence, for general multipersistence modules barcode decomposition is not possible, and the direct generalization of single persistence to multipersistence fails. On the other hand, even if the multipersistence module has a good barcode decomposition, because of partial ordering, representing these barcodes faithfully is another major problem. Multipersistence modules are an important subject in commutative algebra, where one can find the details of the topic in¬†. While complete generalization is out of reach for now, several attempts have been tried to utilize MP idea¬†[ref]51. One of the first such novel ideas came from  where they suggest using one-dimensional slices in the MP grid, and to get the signature of the most dominant features. Later,  combined several slicing directions (vineyards) and obtained a vectorization by summarizing several persistence diagrams (PDs) in these directions. Slicing techniques use the persistence diagrams of predetermined one-dimensional slices in the multipersistence grid and then combine (compress) them as one-dimensional output¬†. In that respect, one major issue is that the topological summary highly depends on the predetermined slicing directions in this approach, and how to decide this direction. The other problem is the loss of information when compressing the information in various persistence diagrams. Another novel approach to vectorizing the multipersistence module is presented by¬†Vipond [ref]11. In this study, the author effectively extends persistence landscapes into higher dimensions. This approach does not use a specific global slice direction. For every point ùê±‚àà‚Ñùnùê±superscript‚Ñùùëõ\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}‚Äîwhere nùëõn signifies the dimension of the multipersistence module‚Äîthe kt‚Äãhsuperscriptùëòùë°‚Ñék^{th}-landscape explores the widest direction in which the rank invariant has a nontrivial image. Viewed from this perspective, the Multipersistence Landscape might be regarded as a more faithful representation of the multipersistence module. While the MP Landscape can be notably effective in scenarios where vital information is derived from a few predominant topological features, such as point clouds or sparse data, its computational intensity makes it less practical for analyzing large datasets with numerous topological features. Conversely, our approach offers a less computationally intensive, yet more versatile vectorization, which can be efficiently applied to various datasets. As explained above, the MP approach has still technical problems to reach its full potential, and there are several attempts to utilize this idea. In this paper, we do not claim to solve theoretical problems of multipersistence homology but offer a novel, highly practical multidimensional topological summary by advancing the existing methods. We use the grid directions in the multipersistence module as natural slicing directions and produce multidimensional topological summary of the data. As a result, these multidimensional topological fingerprints are capable of capturing very fine topological information hidden in the data. Furthermore, in the case the data provides more than two very important filtering functions, our framework easily accommodates these functions and induces corresponding substructures. Then, our EMP model captures the evolving topological patterns of these substructures and summarize them in matrices and arrays which are highly practical output formats to be used with various ML models. Our model is highly different from previous work mostly because of its practicality and computational efficiency. Among these, the closest method to ours is  which employs slicing techniques in a different way. Like us, they have predetermined slicing options (vineyards), and they compute the single persistence diagrams on these slices and combine them in a unique way by using weight functions induced by lifespans of the topological features in this collection of persistence diagrams. In our approach, we use only horizontal slices and do not compress the information. First, choosing horizontal slices is computationally very feasible to obtain persistence diagrams. Second, we offer a variety of options on how to vectorize these persistence diagrams. Hence, depending on the dataset, one can use vectorization methods that emphasize long barcodes (Silhouette with p>1ùëù1p>1, Entropy, Persistence Image) or the ones which consider all signals equally (Betti). Our experiments proved that these varieties of options can be quite useful as some EMP vectorizations give much better results than others in different datasets (Section¬†5.3).\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: important subject in commutative algebra, where one can find the details of the topic in¬†.
