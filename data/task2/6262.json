      "content": "Paper Title: Power Control with QoS Guarantees: A Differentiable Projection-based Unsupervised Learning Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo date, most deep learning (DL)-based studies considered SRM via power control   [ref]2 , while considering simple BS power budget constraint.\nRecently, some research works considered the problem of SRM via power control with power budget and minimum rate constraint of users. The authors in [ref]3  applied unsupervised training of DNNs and incorporated the penalty of violating the QoS constraint in the loss function. In [ref]15, the authors proposed a hybrid resource allocation scheme for multi-channel underlay device-to-device (D2D) communications. In particular, the transmit power control is considered for SRM considering interference and minimum rate constraints. The authors considered a heuristic equally reduced power (ERP) scheme together with a DNN-based scheme to avoid violation of QoS constraints. However, resorting to these heuristics (ERP in [ref]15 or minimum power [ref]3), when the DNN’s output violates QoS constraint, can compromise the quality of optimal power allocation solutions; thereby impacting the maximum achievable sum-rate. Based on the duality theory,    applied the Lagrangian loss function to train the DNN and parameterize both the primal and dual variables. However, due to the residual error of DNN for parameterizing the dual variables, the methods cannot guarantee that the constraints are always satisfied. In , the authors introduced a slack variable that relaxes the minimum rate constraints. The objective changed to maximizing the sum-rate while minimizing the slack variable. This new method called counterfactual\noptimization sacrifices the sum-rate to provide QoS of the cell-edge users.\nVery recently,  studied the SRM via power control with minimum rate and power budget constraints for an ad-hoc setup. To address the constraints, an approximate closed-form projection is used that takes the output of the DNN and projects it into the feasible set. However, the approach is limited to linear constraints. Table I summarizes the existing state-of-the-art and clarifies the novelty of this article.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: To date, most deep learning (DL)-based studies considered SRM via power control   [ref]2 , while considering simple BS power budget constraint.\nRecently, some research works considered the problem of SRM via power control with power budget and minimum rate constraint of users.
