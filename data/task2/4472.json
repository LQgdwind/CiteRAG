      "content": "Paper Title: Out-of-Distribution Detection with Semantic Mismatch under Masking\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) are trained under a “close-world” assumption  3, where all the samples fed to the model are assumed to follow a narrow semantic distribution.\nHowever, when deployed in the wild, the model is exposed to an “open-world” with all kinds of inputs not necessarily following this distribution [ref]9.\nSuch out-of-distribution (OOD) samples with significantly different semantics may\nmislead DNN models and generate wrong prediction results with extremely high confidence, thereby hindering DNN’s deployment safety  6   . To distinguish OOD samples from the in-distribution (In-D) data, some propose to reuse the features extracted from the original DNN model to tell the difference6     .\nHowever, such a feature-sharing strategy inevitably results in the trade-off between the prediction accuracy for In-D samples and the OOD detection capabilities.\nThere are also various density-based OOD detection methods   , which try to model the In-D data with probabilistic measures such as energy and likelihood. However, the trustworthiness of these measures is not guaranteed .\nAnother popular OOD detection mechanism uses generative models (e.g., variational autoencoder (VAE)) to reconstruct the input  9. Based on the assumption that In-D data can be well reconstructed while OODs cannot since they are not seen during training, one could measure the distance between the original input and the reconstructed one and detect OOD with a threshold.\nHowever, this assumption is not sound. There are cases where OODs are faithfully reconstructed with the generative models, causing misjudgements . In this paper, we propose a novel distance-based OOD detection framework, named Masked OOD Catcher (MoodCat), wherein we consider the semantic mismatch under masking as the distance metric. Specifically, for image classifiers, we first randomly mask a portion of the input image, use a generative model to synthesize the masked image to a new image conditioned on the classification result, and then calculate the semantic difference between the original image and the synthesized one for OOD detection. Our insight is that, the classification result carries discriminative semantic information and it imposes strong constraints onto the synthesis procedure, especially when trying to recover the masked portions. With MoodCat, for correctly classified In-D data, the generative model can use the unmasked region to make up the masked part with sufficient training. In contrast, for OOD samples that are semantically different, the synthesized image based on the classification result tends to be dramatically different, especially for the masked region. MoodCat is a standalone OOD detector, and it does not require fine-tuning the original classifier. Consequently, it can be combined with any classifier to equip it with OOD detection capability without affecting its accuracy.\nWe perform comprehensive evaluations on standard OOD detection benchmarks  with six datasets and four detection settings. Results show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions by a large margin.\nWe summarize the contributions of this work in the following: We propose a novel OOD detection framework by identifying semantic mismatch under masking, MoodCat. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly considers semantics information for OOD detection. We present a novel masking and conditional synthesis flow in MoodCat, and investigate various masking strategies and conditional generator designs for OOD detection. To tell the semantic difference between the original image and the synthesized one, we employ an anomalous scoring model composed of various quality assessment metrics (e.g., DISTS  and LPIPS ) and a newly-proposed conditional binary classifier. The rest of the paper is constructed as follows.\nSection 2 surveys related OOD detection methods.\nWe detail our proposed MoodCat framework in Section 3.\nSection 4 presents our experimental results and the corresponding ablation studies.\nFinally, Section 5 concludes this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: are assumed to follow a narrow semantic distribution.\nHowever, when deployed in the wild, the model is exposed to an “open-world” with all kinds of inputs not necessarily following this distribution [ref]9.\nSuch out-of-distribution (OOD) samples with significantly different semantics may\nmislead DNN models and generate wrong prediction results with extremely high confidence, thereby hindering\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
