      "content": "Paper Title: Cross-Modal Knowledge Reasoning for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual question answering (VQA)  is an attractive research direction aiming to jointly analyze multimodal content from images and natural language. Equipped with the capacities of grounding, reasoning and translating, a VQA agent is expected to answer a question in natural language based on an image. Recent works  [ref]4 have achieved great success in VQA tasks that are answerable by solely referring to the visible content. However, such kinds of models are incapable of answering questions which require external knowledge beyond the visible content.\nConsidering the question in Figure 1, the agent not only needs to visually localize ‘red cylinder’, but also to semantically recognize it as ‘fire hydrant’ and connects the knowledge that ‘fire hydrant is used for firefighting’.\nTherefore, how to collect question-oriented and information-complementary evidence from visual, semantic and knowledge perspectives is essential to achieve general VQA. To advocate research in this direction, [ref]5 introduces a Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) task, named as ‘Fact-based’ VQA (FVQA), for answering questions by joint analysis of the image and the knowledge base of facts. The typical solutions for FVQA build a fact graph with fact triplets filtered by the visual concepts in the image and select one entity in the graph as the answer. Existing works [ref]5 [ref]6 parse the question as keywords and retrieve the supporting-entity only by keyword matching. This kind of approaches is vulnerable when the question does not exactly mention the visual concepts (e.g. synonyms and homographs) or the mentioned information is not captured in the fact graph (e.g. the visual attribute ‘red’ in Figure 1 may be falsely omitted). To resolve these problems,  introduces visual information into the fact graph and infers the answer by implicit graph reasoning under the guidance of the question. However, they provide the whole visual information equally to each graph node by concatenation of the image, question and entity embeddings. Actually, only part of the visual content are relevant to the question and a certain entity.\nMoreover, the fact graph here is still homogeneous since each node is represented by a fixed form of image-question-entity embedding, which limits the model’s flexibility of adaptively capturing evidence from different modalities. A model has to be selective by choosing relevant information and avoiding unexpected noise. The recent proposed natural language understanding systems based on the cognition theory  are consistent in that our brain is capable to adaptively combine multimodal input for understanding and reasoning. As proposed in , the understanding system contains two essential parts, where the neocortical sub-system (the blue box in Figure 2) is responsible for selectively integrating linguistic and non-linguistic input to understand the object and situation while the medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub-system (the red box in Figure 2) aims to store and learn from the integrated embeddings of the neocortical sub-system states. This understanding system is universal to tackle a wide range of natural language problems requiring external knowledge in multimodal format. In this perspective, KVQA problems can also be solved by this system by considering external knowledge in both linguistic (text and knowledge graph) and non-linguistic (image) format, which is flexible to choose task-relevant and content-complementary information for answer prediction. Motivated by the proposed structure of understanding system in , we first introduce a novel scheme to depict an image by unifying the graph representation of different modalities, including the visual graph, semantic graph and fact graph. Specifically, the object appearance and their relationships are kept in the visual graph, the high-level abstraction is provided in the semantic graph and the corresponding factual knowledge is supported in the fact graph, which imitates distinct areas in neocortical sub-system that processes each input modality (the three blue ovals at bottom of neocortex). Graph representation is suitable for modeling the objects (entities) and their relationships of input and beneficial for connecting different modalities to constrain each other. Then we integrate cross-modal knowledge corresponding to the same concept (the blue oval at top of neocortex) by a series of memory-based reasoning steps. In order to select complementary knowledge from different modalities for integration, we propose a constraint satisfaction process in which the information in one modality influences the selection of information in another modality. To this end, we perform each reasoning step by a Graph-based Read, Update, and Control (GRUC) module that conducts parallel reasoning over both visual and semantic information: the control unit updates the control signal for extracting a knowledge vector from the knowledge graphs (visual and semantic); the read unit generates the knowledge vector from the knowledge graphs upon the constrain of the control signal; the update unit integrates the knowledge vector into the control signal as well as the knowledge graph for memory update. After multiple reasoning steps, we obtain complementary evidence from different modalities and fuse them adaptively to reason about the global-optimal answer via a graph neural network, which can be seen as the learning system in MLT. The main contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) We novelly depict multimodal knowledge sources by multiple knowledge graphs from the visual, semantic and factual views, which unifies the representations of different modalities in graph domain and thus benefits for structure preserving and relational reasoning. Thereinto, introducing the semantic graph for high-level abstraction brings remarkable improvement in KVQA, which has been less studied in previous work. (2) We propose a recurrent reasoning model that has three obvious novelties: First, it is a parallel reasoning model that applies modality-oriented controllers for reasoning over different modalities in a parallel mode, which can be easily extended to involve more modalities; Second, our model is designed for reasoning upon graph-structured multimodal data, aiming to consider the essential structural information in the reasoning process; Third, the basic reasoning module GRUC is a modular architecture consisting of Read, Update and Control units, which supports more explicit and structured reasoning. (3) The proposed model remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on three benchmark datasets, including FVQA, Visual7W-KB and OK-VQA, which demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model. Through ablative studies, we prove how each of the proposed components contributes to the improvement. (4) The proposed model has good interpretability. It automatically tells which concept (entity) and modality (visual, semantic or factual) have more contributions to answer the question through visualization of attention weights in GRUC and gate values in the fusion process. Meanwhile, the model can also reveal the knowledge selection mode from different modalities according to the complexity of the questions.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: images and natural language.
