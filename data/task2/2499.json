      "content": "Paper Title: BigGraphVis: Leveraging Streaming Algorithms and GPU Acceleration for Visualizing Big Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nForce-directed algorithms¬† are widely used to create graph layouts. The idea of force-directed algorithms¬†  is to define repulsive force between every pair of nodes and attractive force between adjacent nodes. The algorithm then updates the node positions based on the total force acting on each node. The process is repeated over a number of iterations for better convergence. Some force-directed algorithms are based on energy minimization¬† , where the energy is defined such that at a minimum energy state, the distances among the nodes become proportional to their graph-theoretic distances in the graph. Computation of pairwise forces is a major bottleneck of a force-directed layout.\nA straightforward calculation of forces take O‚Äã(n2)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõ2O(n^{2}) time, but based on an approximation algorithm for performing an nùëõn-body simulation (Barnes‚ÄìHut simulation¬†), one can compute approximate forces in O‚Äã(n‚Äãlog‚Å°n)ùëÇùëõùëõO(n\\log n) time.\nForceAtlas2¬† is a popular force-directed algorithm that leverages several useful techniques such as Barnes-Hut simulation (for fast force calculation), degree-dependent\nrepulsive force (to reduce visual cluttering), and local and global adaptive temperatures (for better convergence). ForceAtlas2, implemented in a popular graph drawing software Gephi¬†, can produce a good layout for graphs with up to 100,000 nodes. Multilevel force-directed layouts¬†  further speeds up computation by first ‚Äòcoarsening‚Äô the graph (computing a new graph with smaller size) repetitively in multiple levels. The global energy minimization is performed across these coarse graphs, and then the detailed drawings are computed for each coarse graph. \nA number of recent approaches to force-directed layout for big graphs includes using distributed architecture¬†, dimensionality reduction¬†, and deep-learning based computation¬†[ref]26.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: for each coarse graph. \nA number of recent approaches to force-directed layout for big graphs includes using distributed architecture¬†, dimensionality reduction¬†, and deep-learning based computation¬†[ref]26.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
