      "content": "Paper Title: The solving degrees for computing Gröbner bases of affine semi-regular polynomial sequences\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the case where the chosen monomial ordering is graded, the complexity of computing a Gröbner basis is often estimated with the so-called solving degree.\nTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, there are three (in fact four) kinds of definitions of solving degree, and we here review them.\nThe first definition is explicitly provided first by Ding and Schmidt in , and it depends on algorithms or their implementations: As the first definition, we define the solving degree of an algorithm to compute a Gröbner basis as the highest degree of the polynomials involved during the execution of the algorithm, see [14, p. 36].\nFor example, applying Buchberger’s algorithm or its variants such as F4subscript𝐹4F_{4} with the normal strategy, we collect critical S-pairs with the lowest degree and then reduce the corresponding S-polynomials in each iteration of the main loop of reductions.\nThe lowest degree of each iteration is called the step degree.\nThen the solving degree is defined as the highest step degree.\nInstead, we may adopt the highest degree of S𝑆S-polynomials appearing in the whole computation as in  and  by Semaeve-Tenti, and in this case we use the terminology “the solving degree in the strict sense”. Their is a variant of the above first definition, where the solving degree is defined as a value depending not only on an algorithm but also on its implementation.\nMore precisely, in [14, Section 2.1], the authors use the term solving degree for the step degree at which it takes the most amount of time among all iterations.\nIn the cryptographic literature, the term solving degree often means this solving degree.\nAlthough this solving degree is estimated based on experiments, it is practically a quite important ingredient for analyzing the security of multivariate cryptosystems.\nThe degree of regularity dreg​(⟨Ftop⟩)subscript𝑑regdelimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹topd_{\\rm reg}(\\langle F^{\\rm top}\\rangle) can be often used as a proxy for this solving degree. We do not consider the solving degree in (I)’, since this paper focuses on theoretical aspects on computing Gröbner bases, but not on aspects in practical implementation.\nFor a graded monomial ordering ≺precedes\\prec on R𝑅R and an input set F𝐹F of non-zero polynomials in R𝑅R, we denote by sd≺𝒜​(F)superscriptsubscriptsdprecedes𝒜𝐹\\mathrm{sd}_{\\prec}^{\\mathcal{A}}(F) the solving degree in (I) of an algorithm 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} to compute a Gröbner basis of F𝐹F with respect to ≺precedes\\prec. On the other hand, Caminata and Gorla [ref]7 defined the solving degree of an input system, so that it does not depend on an algorithm, by using Macaulay matrices.\nHere, a Macaulay matrix is defined as follows:\nFor a (fixed) graded monomial ordering ≺precedes\\prec and a finite sequence H=(h1,…,hk)∈(R∖{0})k𝐻subscriptℎ1…subscriptℎ𝑘superscript𝑅0𝑘H=(h_{1},\\ldots,h_{k})\\in(R\\smallsetminus\\{0\\})^{k} with d:=max⁡{deg⁡(hi):1≤i≤k}assign𝑑:degreesubscriptℎ𝑖1𝑖𝑘d:=\\max\\{\\deg(h_{i}):1\\leq i\\leq k\\}, writing each hisubscriptℎ𝑖h_{i} as hi=∑j=1ℓci,j​tjsubscriptℎ𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑗1ℓsubscript𝑐𝑖𝑗subscript𝑡𝑗h_{i}=\\sum_{j=1}^{\\ell}c_{i,j}t_{j}, where 𝒯≤d={t1,…,tℓ−1,tℓ=1}subscript𝒯absent𝑑subscript𝑡1…subscript𝑡ℓ1subscript𝑡ℓ1\\mathcal{T}_{\\leq d}=\\{t_{1},\\ldots,t_{\\ell-1},t_{\\ell}=1\\} is the set of monomials in R𝑅R of degree ≤dabsent𝑑\\leq d with t1≻⋯≻tℓsucceedssubscript𝑡1⋯succeedssubscript𝑡ℓt_{1}\\succ\\cdots\\succ t_{\\ell}, the Macaulay matrix of H𝐻H, denoted by Mac≺​(H)subscriptMacprecedes𝐻\\mathrm{Mac}_{\\prec}(H) is defined to be the k×ℓ𝑘ℓk\\times\\ell matrix (ai,j)i,jsubscriptsubscript𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑖𝑗(a_{i,j})_{i,j} over K𝐾K (we let Mac≺​(H)subscriptMacprecedes𝐻\\mathrm{Mac}_{\\prec}(H) be the 1×1111\\times 1 zero-matrix if H𝐻H is empty).\nMoreover, for each non-negative integer d𝑑d, the degree-d𝑑d Macaulay matrix of F𝐹F, denoted by M≤d​(F)subscript𝑀absent𝑑𝐹M_{\\leq d}(F) when ≺precedes\\prec is fixed, is defined as M≤d​(F):=Mac≺​(𝒮≤d​(F))assignsubscript𝑀absent𝑑𝐹subscriptMacprecedessubscript𝒮absent𝑑𝐹M_{\\leq d}(F):={\\rm Mac}_{\\prec}(\\mathcal{S}_{\\leq d}(F)), where 𝒮≤d​(F)subscript𝒮absent𝑑𝐹\\mathcal{S}_{\\leq d}(F) is a sequence of the multiples t​f𝑡𝑓tf for f∈F𝑓𝐹f\\in F with deg⁡(f)≤ddegree𝑓𝑑\\deg(f)\\leq d and t∈𝒯≤d−deg⁡(f)𝑡subscript𝒯absent𝑑degree𝑓t\\in\\mathcal{T}_{\\leq d-\\deg(f)}.\nNamely, the rows of M≤d​(F)subscript𝑀absent𝑑𝐹M_{\\leq d}(F) correspond to t​f𝑡𝑓tf’s above, and the columns are indexed by the monomials of degree at most d𝑑d in descending order with respect to ≺precedes\\prec.\nNote that the order of elements in 𝒮≤d​(F)subscript𝒮absent𝑑𝐹\\mathcal{S}_{\\leq d}(F) can be arbitrary. We define the solving degree of F𝐹F with respect to a fixed (graded) monomial ordering as the lowest degree d𝑑d at which the reduced row echelon form (RREF) of M≤d​(F)subscript𝑀absent𝑑𝐹M_{\\leq d}(F) produces a Gröbner basis of F𝐹F. Note that the computation of the RREF of M≤d​(F)subscript𝑀absent𝑑𝐹M_{\\leq d}(F) corresponds to the standard XL algorithm , which is based on an idea of Lazard . The third definition is given in Gorla et al.’s works (cf. , , , [ref]21), see also .\nMore precisely, for each non-negative integer d∈ℤ≥0𝑑subscriptℤabsent0d\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}, let VF,dsubscript𝑉𝐹𝑑V_{F,d} be the smallest K𝐾K-vector space such that {f∈F:deg​(f)≤d}⊂VF,dconditional-set𝑓𝐹deg𝑓𝑑subscript𝑉𝐹𝑑\\{f\\in F:\\mathrm{deg}(f)\\leq d\\}\\subset V_{F,d} and {t​f:f∈VF,d,t∈𝒯≤d−deg​(f)}⊂VF,dconditional-set𝑡𝑓formulae-sequence𝑓subscript𝑉𝐹𝑑𝑡subscript𝒯absent𝑑deg𝑓subscript𝑉𝐹𝑑\\{tf:f\\in V_{F,d},\\ t\\in\\mathcal{T}_{\\leq d-\\mathrm{deg}(f)}\\}\\subset V_{F,d}, where 𝒯≤dsubscript𝒯absent𝑑\\mathcal{T}_{\\leq d} denotes the set of all monomials in R𝑅R of degree at most d𝑑d.\nThen the third definition is as follows: The solving degree of F𝐹F is defined as the smallest d𝑑d for which VF,dsubscript𝑉𝐹𝑑V_{F,d} contains a Gröbner basis of F𝐹F with respect to a fixed monomial ordering. We can also describe the solving degree in (III) with Macaulay matrices.\nSpecifically, we consider to compute a Gröbner basis of F𝐹F by the following mutant strategy: Initialize d𝑑d as d=max​{deg⁡(f):f∈F}𝑑maxconditional-setdegree𝑓𝑓𝐹d=\\mathrm{max}\\{\\deg(f):f\\in F\\}.\nCompute the RREF of M≤d​(F)subscript𝑀absent𝑑𝐹M_{\\leq d}(F).\nIf the RREF contains a polynomial f𝑓f with deg⁡(f)<ddegree𝑓𝑑\\deg(f)<d whose leading monomial is not equal to that of any row of M≤d​(F)subscript𝑀absent𝑑𝐹M_{\\leq d}(F), add to the RREF the new rows corresponding to t​f𝑡𝑓tf for all t∈𝒯≤d−deg⁡(f)𝑡subscript𝒯absent𝑑degree𝑓t\\in\\mathcal{T}_{\\leq d-\\deg(f)} such that t​f𝑡𝑓tf does not belong to the linear space spanned by the rows of the RREF.\nRepeat the computation of the RREF and the operation of adding new rows, until there are no new rows to add.\nIf the resulting matrix produces a Gröbner basis of F𝐹F, then we stop, and otherwise we proceed to the next degree, d+1𝑑1d+1. This strategy computes a basis of VF,dsubscript𝑉𝐹𝑑V_{F,d} for each d𝑑d, and therefore the smallest d𝑑d for which the mutant strategy terminates is equal to the solving degree of F𝐹F in terms of (III), see [22, Theorem 1].\nAs in [ref]21, we refer to the algorithms such as Mutant-XL [ref]6 and MXL2  that employ this strategy as mutant algorithms.\nIn the following, we denote the solving degree in (II) and that in (III) respectively by sd≺mac​(F)superscriptsubscriptsdprecedesmac𝐹\\mathrm{sd}_{\\prec}^{\\rm mac}(F) and sd≺mut​(F)superscriptsubscriptsdprecedesmut𝐹\\mathrm{sd}_{\\prec}^{\\rm mut}(F).\nBy definitions, it is clear that sd≺mut​(F)≤sd≺mac​(F)superscriptsubscriptsdprecedesmut𝐹superscriptsubscriptsdprecedesmac𝐹\\mathrm{sd}_{\\prec}^{\\rm mut}(F)\\leq\\mathrm{sd}_{\\prec}^{\\rm mac}(F) for any graded monomial oredering ≺precedes\\prec, and the equality holds if the elements in F𝐹F are all homogeneous. In a series of their celebrated works (cf. [ref]7, , , , [ref]21), Gorla et al. provided a mathematical formulation for the relations between the solving degrees sd≺mac​(F)superscriptsubscriptsdprecedesmac𝐹\\mathrm{sd}_{\\prec}^{\\rm mac}(F) and sd≺mut​(F)superscriptsubscriptsdprecedesmut𝐹\\mathrm{sd}_{\\prec}^{\\rm mut}(F) and algebraic invariants coming from F𝐹F, such as the maximal Gröbner basis degree, the degree of regularity, the Castelnuovo–Mumford regularity, the first and last degrees, and so on.\nHere, the maximal Gröbner basis degree of the ideal ⟨F⟩Rsubscriptdelimited-⟨⟩𝐹𝑅\\langle F\\rangle_{R} is the maximal degree of elements in the reduced Gröbner basis of ⟨F⟩Rsubscriptdelimited-⟨⟩𝐹𝑅\\langle F\\rangle_{R} with respect to a fixed monomial ordering ≺precedes\\prec, and is denoted by max.GB.deg≺​(F)formulae-sequencemaxGBsubscriptdegprecedes𝐹\\mathrm{max.GB.deg}_{\\prec}(F).\nFor any graded monomial oredering ≺precedes\\prec, it is straightforward that\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: the solving degree in (I) of an algorithm 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} to compute a Gröbner basis of F𝐹F with respect to ≺precedes\\prec.
