      "content": "Paper Title: MV-DeepSDF: Implicit Modeling with Multi-Sweep Point Clouds for 3D Vehicle Reconstruction in Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs shown in Eq.¬†(6), ground truth latent codes, partial point clouds,\nand their corresponding latent codes are required for training the reconstruction network.\nHowever, real-world datasets, such as Waymo¬†[ref]37 and KITTI¬†, do not contain ground truth shapes,\nso it is necessary to use a synthetic dataset  for generating the training data.\nTo resolve this problem, we utilize the latent codes of the training shapes\n(e.g., the complete dense point cloud shown in Case 1 of Figure 3) as ground truth latent codes\nin the second stage of model training.\nAs for the partial point clouds, the domain gap between training instances and in-the-wild instances directly determines\nthe ability of our network to generalize to real-world datasets.\nTo reduce the domain gap, we adopt PCGen  as our partial point cloud generation method.\nPCGen places a virtual LiDAR with real-world parameters (resolution and sampling pattern) around the vehicle\nand simulates the point cloud captured by the virtual LiDAR.\nThis differs from the method used by DeepSDF [ref]32, where a simulated depth camera is used as the virtual sensor instead of a LiDAR.\nA visual comparison of the real-world point cloud and simulated partial point clouds obtained using various methods is given in Figure 5.\nAs shown in Figure 5, the partial point clouds of PCGen  are visually closer to the in-the-wild LiDAR sweeps of Waymo [ref]37 and KITTI  than those of the virtual depth camera approach [ref]32,\nwhich only raycasts evenly in the inclination and azimuth directions.\nApart from this visual superiority, the advantages of generating partial point clouds with PCGen can also be observed\nthrough the improved generalization ability of our network. See experiments for further details.\n When generating training data from ShapeNetV2 , we randomly sample one side of the vehicle to accurately reflect the\nreal-world scan of a LiDAR on an ego-vehicle.\nIn this way, we produce six partial point clouds for each vehicle.\nThe virtual LiDAR pose for each partial point cloud is generated using a set of restrictions.\nThese restrictions are set by considering the possible relative poses of an ego vehicle‚Äôs LiDAR in the coordinate system of the other vehicle.\nIn particular, Œ∏‚àà[0‚àò,180‚àò]ùúÉsuperscript0superscript180\\theta{\\in}[0^{\\circ},180^{\\circ}] or Œ∏‚àà[‚àí180‚àò,0‚àò]ùúÉsuperscript180superscript0\\theta{\\in}[-180^{\\circ},0^{\\circ}], r‚àà[ref]3 ùëü315r{\\in}[ref]3 , and h‚àà[0.8,1.2]‚Ñé0.81.2h{\\in}[0.8,1.2]\nare used, where Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta represents the azimuth, rùëür represents the distance between the LiDAR and the vehicle,\nand h‚Ñéh represents the height of the LiDAR to the ground.\nŒ∏,r,ùúÉùëü\\theta,r, and h‚Ñéh describes the pose of the virtual LiDAR with respect to the frame of the other vehicle.\nBoth rùëür and h‚Ñéh are expressed in the normalized space, where the size of the vehicle is normalized into the range [‚àí1,1]11[-1,1].\nFinally, we generate a latent code for each partial point cloud using Eq.¬†(1).\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: in Eq.¬†(6), ground truth latent codes, partial point clouds,\nand their corresponding latent codes are required for training the reconstruction network.\nHowever, real-world datasets, such as Waymo¬†[ref]37 and KITTI¬†, do not contain ground truth shapes,\nso it is necessary to use a synthetic dataset  for generating the training data.\nTo resolve this problem, we utilize the latent codes of the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
