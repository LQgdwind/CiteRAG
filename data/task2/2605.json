      "content": "Paper Title: Phy-Q as a Measure for Physical Reasoning Intelligence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we conduct a comparison between ten related physical reasoning benchmarks and two physics-based AI game competitions to show how Phy-Q testbed advances upon existing work. The comparison is done with respect to six criteria.\n1) Measuring broad generalization in individual physical scenario/s, i.e, testing the ability of an agent in generalizing to tasks that require the same physical rule to solve.\n2) Categorization of tasks of the test environment into different physical scenarios, i.e, agents can be evaluated for individual scenarios to recognize the scenarios that they can perform well.\n3) Procedural generation of tasks or variations of the tasks, i.e., the tasks/variants of the tasks in the test environment are created algorithmically facilitating the users to generate any amount of data.\n4) Destructibility of objects in the environment, i.e., if the environment contains objects that can be destroyed upon the application of forces. Having destructible objects makes the environment more realistic than an environment that only has indestructible objects since the agents need to consider the magnitude of the force that is applied to the objects. For example, when a robot moves a cup, it needs to reason that the force to exert should be large enough to grab the cup but not too large to break it.\n5) Observing the outcome of a desired physical action, i.e., if an agent can physically interact and observe the outcome of the action the agent takes.\n6) Inclusion of human player data, i.e., if the evaluation has results of human players. We consider PHYRE , Virtual Tools game , and OGRE [ref]13, which are game based benchmarks, IntPhys [ref]24, CLEVERER [ref]25, CATER , and Physion  which are video based benchmarks, COPHY  which is an image based benchmark, CausalWorld  and RLBench  which are robotic benchmarks. The AI game competitions we consider are Computational Pool , and Geometry Friends . We also included the AIBIRDS  competition for the comparison to show what properties in Phy-Q facilitate the systematic evaluation of AIBIRDS competition agents. Table 1 summarises the comparison. The most closely related physical reasoning test environment to ours is PHYRE , which also consists of tasks to measure two levels of generalization of agents. PHYRE benchmark tests if agents can generalize to solve tasks within a task template (within template) and if agents can generalize between different task templates (cross template).\nThe cross template evaluation in PHYRE does not guarantee that the physical rules required to solve the testing tasks exist in the training tasks. This leads to uncertainties in understanding agents’ performance: inferior performance may not be an indicator of inferior physical reasoning but of a difficult training and testing split. Whereas the broad generalization evaluation in our testbed always ensures that physical rules required in testing tasks are covered in the training tasks, hence we guarantee a more systematic evaluation of the physical reasoning capabilities of AI agents.\nAccording to the task design in PHYRE, tasks need to be solved by trial and error. That is, even when the physical rule is known, multiple attempts are still needed to solve the tasks. Therefore, PHYRE promotes developing agents with physical dexterity. In contrast, we focus on strategy based physical reasoning tasks that can be solved by a single attempt when the physical rule is understood. We promote developing agents that can understand a physical rule rather than taking a precise action in a physical environment (i.e., agents with strategic physical reasoning capabilities).\nFurthermore, a limited number of object shapes, motion, and material properties on scene dynamics hinder the ability of a comprehensive evaluation, as performing well on these tests might not indicate greater physical reasoning ability in more general and realistic contexts . Therefore, compared to PHYRE, in Phy-Q we have 1) 3 more object shapes (rectangles, squares, and triangles) to allow more diverse physical dynamics, 2) destructible objects to make our environment more realistic, and 3) objects with three different materials that have different densities, bounciness, and friction to allow physical reasoning in a more realistic context. As a recent visual and physical prediction benchmark, Physion  evaluates algorithms’ physical prediction capability using videos of eight different physical scenarios. Compared to Physion, Phy-Q testbed has a more comprehensive set of 15 physical scenarios enabling the evaluation of agents in a wider range of physical scenarios. Phy-Q testbed requires agents to interact with the environment and select the desired action to accomplish physical tasks. Therefore, on top of predicting a physical event’s outcome, agents need to apply the acquired physical knowledge to solve new situations, which is considered to be a more advanced type of task in Bloom’s taxonomy . In addition, a study on forward prediction for physical reasoning  confirms that higher forward prediction accuracy does not necessarily increase performance in domains that require selecting an action. Therefore, the research problem focused on Physion differs from that of Phy-Q. Despite Angry Birds being a simplified and controlled physics environment as compared to the much messier real physical world, no AI system has been developed that comes close to human performance. To encourage the development of AI agents that can reason with physics as humans do, the AIBIRDS competition has been organized annually since 2012, mostly held at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence . Since then, many different AI approaches have been proposed, ranging from modern deep reinforcement learning methods to more old-school heuristic methods, e.g. qualitative physical reasoning methods.\nHowever, none of these approaches has reached the milestone of achieving human level performance. One major reason is that an agent’s performance in the competition does not enable an agent developer to identify the physical scenarios that the agent falls short of. This is because the tasks in the competition are generally complex with multiple physical scenarios within the same task. In this work, we show how the Phy-Q testbed can be used towards guiding the competition agents through a systematic evaluation of agents’ performance.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: and observe the outcome of the action the agent takes.\n6) Inclusion of human player data, i.e., if the evaluation has results of human players.
