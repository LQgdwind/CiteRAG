      "content": "Paper Title: P-time Algorithms for Typical #EO Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we aim to give a detailed characterization of counting problems in Section 1.1 by proving Lemma 1.5. We use ≤Tsubscript𝑇\\leq_{T} and ≡Tsubscript𝑇\\equiv_{T} to respectively denote polynomial-time Turing reductions and equivalences. By Definition 1.1 to 1.4, it is easy to verify the following lemma. #​GH​(f)≡T#​CSP​({f}).subscript𝑇#GH𝑓#CSP𝑓\\#\\textsf{GH}(f)\\equiv_{T}\\#\\textsf{CSP}(\\{f\\}). [ref]15\n#EO(ℱ)≡THolant(≠2∣ℱ)\\#\\textsf{EO}(\\mathcal{F})\\equiv_{T}\\textsf{Holant}(\\neq_{2}\\mid\\mathcal{F}). We also have the following lemma from . \nHolant(≠2∣ℱ)≡THolant(Z−1ℱ)\\textsf{Holant}(\\neq_{2}\\mid\\mathcal{F})\\equiv_{T}\\textsf{Holant}(Z^{-1}\\mathcal{F}) Here, Z−1=12​(1−𝔦1𝔦)superscript𝑍112matrix1𝔦1𝔦Z^{-1}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\begin{matrix}1&-\\mathfrak{i}\\\\\n1&\\mathfrak{i}\\end{matrix}\\right), and Z−1​ℱsuperscript𝑍1ℱZ^{-1}\\mathcal{F} is the signature set obtained from ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} by taking a holographic transformation   defined by Z−1superscript𝑍1Z^{-1}. We omit the introduction of holographic transformation and the proof of this lemma, as they do not play a key role in this article. However, readers are encouraged to have a better understanding of holographic transformation from [Section 1.3.2] as holographic transformation is a very powerful method in the field of counting complexity. Suppose f𝑓f is an EO signature of arity 2​d2𝑑2d, with variable set Var​(f)={x1,x2,⋯,x2​d}Var𝑓subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2⋯subscript𝑥2𝑑\\text{Var}(f)=\\{x_{1},x_{2},\\cdots,x_{2d}\\}. Fix an arbitrary perfect pairing P={{xi1,xi2},{xi3,xi4},⋯,{xi2​d−1,xi2​d}}𝑃subscript𝑥subscript𝑖1subscript𝑥subscript𝑖2subscript𝑥subscript𝑖3subscript𝑥subscript𝑖4⋯subscript𝑥subscript𝑖2𝑑1subscript𝑥subscript𝑖2𝑑P=\\{\\{x_{i_{1}},x_{i_{2}}\\},\\{x_{i_{3}},x_{i_{4}}\\},\\cdots,\\{x_{i_{2d-1}},x_{i_{2d}}\\}\\} of Var​(f)Var𝑓\\text{Var}(f). We define EOPsuperscriptEO𝑃\\textsf{EO}^{P} as a subset of {0,1}2​dsuperscript012𝑑\\{0,1\\}^{2d} corresponding to P𝑃P, by or equivalently, EOP=supp​([xi1≠xi2]⋅[xi3≠xi4]​⋯​[xi2​d−1≠xi2​d]).superscriptEO𝑃supp⋅delimited-[]subscript𝑥subscript𝑖1subscript𝑥subscript𝑖2delimited-[]subscript𝑥subscript𝑖3subscript𝑥subscript𝑖4⋯delimited-[]subscript𝑥subscript𝑖2𝑑1subscript𝑥subscript𝑖2𝑑\\textsf{EO}^{P}=\\text{supp}([x_{i_{1}}\\neq x_{i_{2}}]\\cdot[x_{i_{3}}\\neq x_{i_{4}}]\\cdots[x_{i_{2d-1}}\\neq x_{i_{2d}}]). If supp​(f)⊆EOPsupp𝑓superscriptEO𝑃\\text{supp}(f)\\subseteq\\textsf{EO}^{P}, we say f𝑓f is an EOPsuperscriptEO𝑃\\textsf{EO}^{P} signature, corresponding to this fixed P𝑃P.\nIf there exists some perfect pairing P𝑃P of Var​(f)Var𝑓\\text{Var}(f) such that f𝑓f is an EOPsuperscriptEO𝑃\\textsf{EO}^{P} signature, we say f𝑓f is a pairwise opposite signature (exactly as Definition 5.5 in [ref]15), or an EOMsuperscriptEOM\\textsf{EO}^{\\text{M}} signature for short. For an EOPsuperscriptEO𝑃\\textsf{EO}^{P} signature f𝑓f defined above, we define τfsubscript𝜏𝑓\\tau_{f}, also denoted as τ​(f)𝜏𝑓\\tau(f), as a set of arity d𝑑d signatures such that Since P𝑃P can exchange the positions of two variables in one pair freely, we know that |τf|=2dsubscript𝜏𝑓superscript2𝑑|\\tau_{f}|=2^{d}. We then define the “inverse mapping” of τ𝜏\\tau. Let g𝑔g be an arbitrary signature of arity d𝑑d. We define π​(g)𝜋𝑔\\pi(g), also denoted as πgsubscript𝜋𝑔\\pi_{g}, as Obviously, πgsubscript𝜋𝑔\\pi_{g} is an EOPsuperscriptEO𝑃\\textsf{EO}^{P} signature with P={{x1,y1},{x2,y2},⋯,{xd,yd}}𝑃subscript𝑥1subscript𝑦1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑦2⋯subscript𝑥𝑑subscript𝑦𝑑P=\\{\\{x_{1},y_{1}\\},\\{x_{2},y_{2}\\},\\cdots,\\{x_{d},y_{d}\\}\\}. We also define π​(ℱ)={π​(f)∣f∈ℱ}𝜋ℱconditional-set𝜋𝑓𝑓ℱ\\pi(\\mathcal{F})=\\{\\pi(f)\\mid f\\in\\mathcal{F}\\}. τ​(π​(g))𝜏𝜋𝑔\\tau(\\pi(g)) contains g𝑔g. In fact, it is composed of all signatures that can be realized by flipping some variables of g𝑔g using the binary disequality. This hints that #​EO#EO\\#\\textsf{EO} is equivalent to #​CSP#CSP\\#\\textsf{CSP} with free binary disequality. With a more detailed argument in [ref]15, including the equivalence of computational complexity between #​CSP#CSP\\#\\textsf{CSP} and #​CSP#CSP\\#\\textsf{CSP} with free binary disequality, the following stronger lemma can be obtained. [15, Theorem 6.1]\n#​CSP​(ℱ)≡T#​EO​(π​(ℱ)).subscript𝑇#CSPℱ#EO𝜋ℱ\\#\\textsf{CSP}(\\mathcal{F})\\equiv_{T}\\#\\textsf{EO}(\\pi(\\mathcal{F})). Combining Lemma 2.1-2.4, Lemma 1.5 is proved.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: Turing reductions and equivalences.
