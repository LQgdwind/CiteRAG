      "content": "Paper Title: Corners in Quasirandom Groups via Sparse Mixing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe notion of quasirandom groups was introduced by Gowers  in studying product-free sets. Quasirandom groups enjoy the property that for any two large sets A,B⊂G𝐴𝐵𝐺A,B\\subset G, the distribution obtained by taking uniform random samples a∈A𝑎𝐴a\\in A, b∈B𝑏𝐵b\\in B and outputting a​b𝑎𝑏ab is close to uniform in an L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}-sense. Of course, abelian groups fail to satisfy the mixing property mentioned above. In 𝔽2nsuperscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑛\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n} for instance, a subspace V𝑉V of codimension 1 is very dense, but V+V=V𝑉𝑉𝑉V+V=V is far from being uniform. We now present the formal definition. A finite group G𝐺G is D𝐷D-quasirandom if every nontrivial irreducible representation over ℂℂ\\mathbb{C} has dimension at least D𝐷D. One can show that every irreducible representation of a finite group G𝐺G must have dimension at most |G|𝐺\\sqrt{|G|}. We record this fact for later use, which can be found in most introductory texts on representation theory of finite groups. For example, this follows from Proposition 5 in [48, Chapter 2.4]. Every complex irreducible representation of a finite group G𝐺G has dimension at most |G|𝐺\\sqrt{|G|}. There are choices of groups G𝐺G which are D𝐷D-quasirandom for D=|G|Ω​(1)𝐷superscript𝐺Ω1D=|G|^{\\Omega(1)}. Contrast this with abelian groups, where every irreducible representation has dimension 1. A common example of a quasirandom group is the set of 2×2222\\times 2 matrices over the finite field 𝔽psubscript𝔽𝑝\\mathbb{F}_{p} for p𝑝p prime with determinant 1.\nA classical result of Frobenius  shows that every nontrivial irreducible representation of SL2​(𝔽p)subscriptSL2subscript𝔽𝑝\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{p}) has dimension at least p−12∼|G|1/3similar-to𝑝12superscript𝐺13\\frac{p-1}{2}\\sim|G|^{1/3}. (For exposition of these facts and additional background on quasirandom groups, see e.g. .) Quasirandom groups have seen various application in constructing pseudorandom objects. The Ramanujan graphs of Lubotzky, Phillips, and Sarnak [ref]36 are built from Cayley graphs of PSL2​(𝔽p)subscriptPSL2subscript𝔽𝑝\\mathrm{PSL}_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{p}) for specific choices of p𝑝p. (The group PSL2​(𝔽p)subscriptPSL2subscript𝔽𝑝\\mathrm{PSL}_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{p}) is obtained by quotienting SL2​(𝔽p)subscriptSL2subscript𝔽𝑝\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{p}) by its center.) Bourgain and Gamburd  showed that random Cayley graphs on SL2​(𝔽p)subscriptSL2subscript𝔽𝑝\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{p}) are expanders. The quasirandomness property was useful for arguing about the multiplicity of eigenvalues of the Cayley graph. Outside of graph theory, ideas from the study of quasirandom groups led to an optimal inapproximability result for k𝑘k-LIN over non-abelian groups . A recent work of Derksen, Lee, and Viola  building on  proved k𝑘k-NOF lower bounds for computing an “interleaved product” of elements coming from a quasirandom group. In particular, their bounds are best understood in the regime where k𝑘k is growing, and they match that of . Before we can formally state the mixing property of quasirandom groups, we define the convolution of two functions f,g:G→ℝ:𝑓𝑔→𝐺ℝf,g\\colon G\\to\\mathbb{R} as Notice that the arguments to the functions in the expectation y,y−1​x𝑦superscript𝑦1𝑥y,y^{-1}x satisfy y⋅(y−1​x)=x⋅𝑦superscript𝑦1𝑥𝑥y\\cdot(y^{-1}x)=x. When μ1,μ2subscript𝜇1subscript𝜇2\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2} are distributions, then (μ1∗μ2)​(x)∗subscript𝜇1subscript𝜇2𝑥(\\mu_{1}\\ast\\mu_{2})(x) is the probability of independent samples z1∼μ1similar-tosubscript𝑧1subscript𝜇1z_{1}\\sim\\mu_{1} and z2∼μ2similar-tosubscript𝑧2subscript𝜇2z_{2}\\sim\\mu_{2} satisfying x=z1​z2𝑥subscript𝑧1subscript𝑧2x=z_{1}z_{2}. The most useful property of quasirandom groups is that convolutions of large sets mix. More formally, we have the following: Let G𝐺G be a D𝐷D-quasirandom group and f,g:G→ℝ:𝑓𝑔→𝐺ℝf,g:G\\to\\mathbb{R}, and assume at least one has mean zero. Then There are various proofs of this fact    which use representation theory. Over abelian groups, convolutions and L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}-norms have pleasant interpretations when working in the Fourier basis. Many of these statements have clean analogs over non-abelian groups which can be formulated using representation theory. Theorem 4.6 can be used to count solutions to equations in quasirandom groups.  did exactly this to argue about the size of product-free sets in quasirandom groups. Namely, we can count solutions (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y) where x∈X,y∈Y,x​y∈Zformulae-sequence𝑥𝑋formulae-sequence𝑦𝑌𝑥𝑦𝑍x\\in X,y\\in Y,xy\\in Z. We have the following: Let G𝐺G be a D𝐷D-quasirandom group, and suppose X,Y,Z⊂G𝑋𝑌𝑍𝐺X,Y,Z\\subset G are subsets. Then, Let f=X−𝔼[X]𝑓𝑋𝔼delimited-[]𝑋f=X-\\mathop{\\mathbb{E}}[X], g=Y−𝔼[Y]𝑔𝑌𝔼delimited-[]𝑌g=Y-\\mathop{\\mathbb{E}}[Y], and h=Z−𝔼[Z]ℎ𝑍𝔼delimited-[]𝑍h=Z-\\mathop{\\mathbb{E}}[Z]. We have Since f𝑓f and 𝔼[X]𝔼delimited-[]𝑋\\mathop{\\mathbb{E}}[X] are orthogonal, we have ‖f‖2=(𝔼[X2]−𝔼[X]2)1/2≤‖X‖2subscriptnorm𝑓2superscript𝔼delimited-[]superscript𝑋2𝔼superscriptdelimited-[]𝑋212subscriptnorm𝑋2\\|f\\|_{2}=\\left(\\mathop{\\mathbb{E}}[X^{2}]-\\mathop{\\mathbb{E}}[X]^{2}\\right)^{1/2}\\leq\\|X\\|_{2}, and similarly for g𝑔g and hℎh.\n∎ We can essentially rephrase Corollary 4.7 as a statement about pseudorandomness against cubes. Let G𝐺G be a D𝐷D-quasirandom group. Then the set is D−1/2superscript𝐷12D^{-1/2}-pseudorandom against cubes. If C=X×Y×Z⊂G3𝐶𝑋𝑌𝑍superscript𝐺3C=X\\times Y\\times Z\\subset G^{3} is a cube, then Corollary 4.7 implies Note that the same proof also works to show that {(x,y,z):x​y​z=1G}conditional-set𝑥𝑦𝑧𝑥𝑦𝑧subscript1𝐺\\{(x,y,z):xyz=1_{G}\\} is pseudorandom against cubes by replacing Z𝑍Z in the above proof with Z−1={z−1:z∈Z}superscript𝑍1conditional-setsuperscript𝑧1𝑧𝑍Z^{-1}=\\{z^{-1}:z\\in Z\\}. Together with Lemma 4.8, we obtain our result on corner-free sets in quasirandom groups as a corollary of Theorem 2.4, where we define corners in the following way: Let G𝐺G be a finite group. A corner is a triple {(x,y),(x​g,y),(x,g​y)}⊂G×G𝑥𝑦𝑥𝑔𝑦𝑥𝑔𝑦𝐺𝐺\\{(x,y),(xg,y),(x,gy)\\}\\subset G\\times G. A corner is nontrivial if g≠1G𝑔subscript1𝐺g\\neq 1_{G}. Let G𝐺G be a D𝐷D-quasirandom group. Then, any corner-free subset of G×G𝐺𝐺G\\times G has size at most Let B⊂G×G𝐵𝐺𝐺B\\subset G\\times G be a corner-free set of size |B|≥2−d​|G|2𝐵superscript2𝑑superscript𝐺2|B|\\geq 2^{-d}|G|^{2} for some d≥1𝑑1d\\geq 1. Assume for the sake of contradiction that d≤O​(log1/4⁡D)𝑑𝑂superscript14𝐷d\\leq O(\\log^{1/4}D) for some small enough implicit constant. Define S⊂G×G×G𝑆𝐺𝐺𝐺S\\subset G\\times G\\times G to be Notice that by the group property, S𝑆S is a permutation function. Additionally, Lemma 4.8 implies that S𝑆S is D−1/2superscript𝐷12D^{-1/2}-pseudorandom with respect to cubes. We will embed B𝐵B as a subset of S𝑆S by defining Observe A𝐴A has size |A|≥2−d​|S|𝐴superscript2𝑑𝑆|A|\\geq 2^{-d}|S|. Additionally, (Note that {(x,y),(x,x−1​z),(z​y−1,y)}𝑥𝑦𝑥superscript𝑥1𝑧𝑧superscript𝑦1𝑦\\{(x,y),(x,x^{-1}z),(zy^{-1},y)\\} corresponds to a corner by an appropriate change of variables.)\nThis along with the fact that A𝐴A is a weak permutation function implies that the corner count in B𝐵B is given by which since B𝐵B has no nontrivial corners, is at most the number of trivial corners |G|2superscript𝐺2|G|^{2}. We can use Theorem 2.4 to lower bound this count as long as we can verify that S𝑆S is sufficiently pseudorandom against cubes. Indeed, for d≤O​(log1/4⁡D)𝑑𝑂superscript14𝐷d\\leq O(\\log^{1/4}D) small enough, we have D−1/2≤2−O​(d4)superscript𝐷12superscript2𝑂superscript𝑑4D^{-1/2}\\leq 2^{-O(d^{4})}. By 4.5, we have D≤|G|1/2𝐷superscript𝐺12D\\leq|G|^{1/2}. This gives a lower bound on the corner count of which gives the desired contradiction.\n∎\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: additional background on quasirandom groups, see e.g. .)
