      "content": "Paper Title: Faster Rectangular Matrix Multiplication by Combination Loss Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRectangular matrix multiplication appears as a bottleneck in several computational problems (e.g., the construction of fast algorithms for the all-pairs shortest paths problem     ,\nthe dynamic computation\nof the transitive closure  ,\nfinding ancestors  or detecting directed cycles ).\nFrom a theoretical perspective, the most relevant quantity is the exponent of rectangular matrix multiplication: for any κ≥0𝜅0\\kappa\\geq 0, the exponent of rectangular matrix multiplication ω​(κ)𝜔𝜅\\omega(\\kappa) is defined as the smallest ω​(κ)𝜔𝜅\\omega(\\kappa) such that the product of an n×⌈nκ⌉𝑛superscript𝑛𝜅n\\times\\left\\lceil n^{\\kappa}\\right\\rceil matrix by an ⌈nκ⌉×nsuperscript𝑛𝜅𝑛\\left\\lceil n^{\\kappa}\\right\\rceil\\times n matrix can be computed in O​(nω+ϵ)𝑂superscript𝑛𝜔italic-ϵO(n^{\\omega+\\epsilon}) time for any ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0.111It is known (see, e.g.,  ) that the arithmetic complexity of the following three types of matrix products is the same: computing the product of an n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n matrix by an n×m𝑛𝑚n\\times m matrix; computing the product of an n×m𝑛𝑚n\\times m matrix by an m×n𝑚𝑛m\\times n matrix; computing the product of an m×n𝑚𝑛m\\times n matrix by an n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n matrix. The exponent of rectangular matrix multiplication thus represents the exponent of the asymptotic complexity of the best possible algorithm for any of these three kinds of matrix multiplication. Note that ω=ω​(1)𝜔𝜔1\\omega=\\omega(1). There is a long history of research on proving upper bounds on ω​(κ)𝜔𝜅\\omega(\\kappa) for κ≠1𝜅1\\kappa\\neq 1 as well     [ref]22  .\nThe best known upper bounds, which are shown in Table 2, have been obtained by Le Gall and Urrutia . These upper bounds were obtained by analyzing the fourth power of the Coppersmith-Winograd tensor, and improved prior bounds obtained by analyzing the second power [ref]22 and the first power . For κ=1𝜅1\\kappa=1 (square matrix multiplication), the results from  recover the upper bound ω<2.3729269𝜔2.3729269\\omega<2.3729269 obtained from the analysis of fourth power of the Coppersmith-Winograd tensor by Stothers  and Vassilevska Williams . Note that higher powers of the Coppersmith-Winograd tensor (e.g., the eighth power) have not yet been analyzed in the context of rectangular matrix multiplication, mainly because the optimization problems are significantly more complicated than for square matrix multiplication. Ref.  also shows that ω​(0.31389)=2𝜔0.313892\\omega(0.31389)=2 and thus gives the lower bound 0.313890.313890.31389 on the quantity sup{κ|ω​(κ)=2}supremumconditional-set𝜅𝜔𝜅2\\sup\\{\\kappa\\>|\\>\\omega(\\kappa)=2\\} that is called the dual exponent of matrix multiplication (and sometimes denoted α𝛼\\alpha).\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: three kinds of matrix multiplication.
