      "content": "Paper Title: Art Creation with Multi-Conditional StyleGANs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe StyleGAN architecture [ref]22 introduced by Karras et al. and the improved version StyleGAN2  produce images of good quality and high resolution.\nWith an adaptive augmentation mechanism, Karras et al. were able to reduce the data and thereby the cost needed to train a GAN successfully .\nFor brevity, in the following, we will refer to StyleGAN2-ADA, which includes the revised architecture and the improved training, as StyleGAN. The StyleGAN architecture consists of a mapping network and a synthesis network.\nGiven a latent vector 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z} in the input latent space Z𝑍Z, the non-linear mapping network f:Z→W:𝑓→𝑍𝑊f:Z\\rightarrow W produces 𝐰∈W𝐰𝑊\\mathbf{w}\\in W.\nThe mapping network is used to disentangle the latent space Z𝑍Z.\nThe latent vector 𝐰𝐰\\mathbf{w} then undergoes some modifications when fed into every layer of the synthesis network to produce the final image.\nThis architecture improves the understanding of the generated image, as the synthesis network can distinguish between coarse and fine features.\nIn addition, it enables new applications, such as style-mixing, where two latent vectors from W𝑊W are used in different layers in the synthesis network to produce a mix of these vectors. In order to influence the images created by networks of the GAN architecture, a conditional GAN (cGAN) was introduced by Mirza and Osindero  shortly after the original introduction of GANs by Goodfellow et al. .\nIn their work, Mirza and Osindera simply fed the conditions alongside the random input vector and were able to produce images that fit the conditions.\nOver time, more refined conditioning techniques were developed, such as an auxiliary classification head in the discriminator  and a projection-based discriminator [ref]28.\nThe StyleGAN generator follows the approach of accepting the conditions as additional inputs but uses conditional normalization in each layer with condition-specific, learned scale and shift parameters  [ref]23. With a latent code 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z} from the input latent space Z𝑍Z and a condition 𝐜𝐜\\mathbf{c} from the condition space C𝐶C, the non-linear conditional mapping network fc:Z,C→W:subscript𝑓c→𝑍𝐶𝑊f_{\\mathrm{c}}:Z,C\\rightarrow W produces 𝐰c∈Wsubscript𝐰c𝑊\\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{c}}\\in W.\nThe latent code 𝐰csubscript𝐰c\\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{c}} is then used together with conditional normalization layers in the synthesis network of the generator to produce the image.\nThe discriminator uses a projection-based conditioning mechanism [ref]28 [ref]23.\nIn the following, we study the effects of conditioning a StyleGAN.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: The StyleGAN architecture [ref]22 introduced by Karras et al. and the improved version StyleGAN2  produce images of good quality and high resolution.\nWith an adaptive augmentation mechanism, Karras et al. were able to reduce\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
