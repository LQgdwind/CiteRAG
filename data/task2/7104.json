      "content": "Paper Title: A Computing-in-Memory-based One-Class Hyperdimensional Computing Model for Outlier Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOutlier detection, also referred to as anomaly detection, is a crucial technique utilized in various application domains like medical diagnosis, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and financial fraud detection. Outliers are generally extreme or out-of-distribution values in a dataset that deviate from other samples or an observation that does not fit the overall pattern. These outliers typically suggest measurement variability, experimental errors, or novelty. In machine learning, outliers in the training or testing set may cause failure in the detection or classification tasks. Additionally, in recent times, cyber attackers deliberately fabricate outliers, posing a threat to the security of cyber-physical systems. Over the years, researchers continue to design robust solutions to detect outliers efficiently and effectively, where statistical methods and machine learning methods are the two most popular types of solutions. Statistical methods include parametric methods such as Gaussian mixture model (GMM) methods¬† and non-parametric methods such as kernel density estimation methods¬†. While statistical methods are mathematically well explainable, fast to evaluate, and easy to implement, their results could be unreliable for practical applications due to their dependency on assumptions of a specific distribution model. Recently, using machine learning techniques for outlier detection has witnessed a significant surge. Among the most effective methodologies, one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), isolation forest, and autoencoder-based neural network approaches are the most notable. OCSVM, which is a variant of the conventional SVM, distinguishes outliers from inliers by maximizing the margin¬†. The isolation forest method, on the other hand, utilizes an ensemble model consisting of isolation trees, with outliers being more vulnerable to isolation and having shorter traversal path lengths¬†. The autoencoder-based method is a novel unsupervised learning approach that uses neural networks to reconstruct data samples, identifying outliers based on the reconstruction errors¬†. These traditional machine learning-based methods can achieve accurate outlier detection but may lack consideration for computation and energy efficiency. In this paper, we present a novel approach for outlier detection based on hyperdimensional computing (HDC). HDC is an emerging computing paradigm inspired by the human brain circuitry that exhibits high-dimensionality and fully distributed holographic representation¬†[ref]6 . HDC represents data samples using high-dimensional hypervectors, typically dimension D=10,000ùê∑10000D=10,000, which can be generated, manipulated, and compared to perform learning tasks. Compared to deep neural networks (DNNs), HDC offers several advantages, including smaller model size, lower computational cost, and one/few-shot learning, making it an attractive alternative, particularly for low-cost computing platforms¬†. HDC has demonstrated promising results in diverse applications such as computer vision¬†, and natural language processing¬†. Specifically, we propose¬†ODHD, which is a novel one-class HDC-based outlier detection method using a positive-unlabeled (P-U) learning structure 0. Our approach is based on the simple yet reasonable assumption that a single hypervector (HV) can represent the abstract information of all inlier samples, which can be distinguished from outlier samples represented in HVs. Although HDC has been extensively studied for supervised learning tasks such as classification in various domains¬†, there is limited research on using HDC for other tasks. Furthermore, recognizing the memory-centric computing properties of ODHD, we propose a hardware/software codesign implementation of ODHD‚Äòs¬†both training and inference phases on top of a computing-in-memory (CiM) architecture (IM-ODHD). CiM can curtail the memory access bottleneck by leveraging parallelism inside the memory array structure, which enables computation at the bitline level along several current paths simultaneously. CiM has emerged as one of the most promising approaches for signal processing, optimization, deep learning and stochastic computing¬†1. Our experimental results indicate that CiM can significantly accelerate the ODHD¬†algorithm and deliver superior energy efficiency. Built on top of our previous study in¬†2, this paper makes the following contributions: We introduce ODHD, a novel one-class outlier detection method based on HDC and P-U learning. Our approach forms a high-dimensional representation of inlier samples and is a viable alternative to existing outlier detection approaches. We develop a comprehensive pipeline for ODHD¬†algorithm. First, we map all inliers samples to a high-dimensional space and create a one-class HV to represent the abstract information of inliers. Next, we propose a confidence-based method to automatically compute a threshold that is used for outlier detection. During testing, we compute the similarity between the unseen testing sample and the one-class HV and compare it to the pre-computed threshold to detect outliers. We propose a static random-access memory (SRAM)-based CiM architecture, IM-ODHD, to implement ODHD. Our CiM architecture leverages customized elements (sense amplifiers), mat-level row/column decoders, logarithmic bit shifters, etc., to attain reduced latency and increased parallelism supporting different parameters of HDC, such as a number of dimensions and hypervector seeds. We apply a hardware/software codesign approach to further improve the functionality of IM-ODHD¬†on CiM architecture. Specifically, we adjust the algorithm-level design of ODHD¬†and show that the proposed changes speed up the runtime of both training and inference with insignificant accuracy loss. To evaluate ODHD, we use six datasets from the Outlier Detection Datasets (ODDS) Library¬†3 and compare our approach with baseline methods such as OCSVM, isolation forest, autoencoder, and HDAD. The comprehensive evaluation results show that ODHD¬†outperforms all the baseline methods on all six datasets in all metrics, including accuracy, F1 score, and ROC-AUC with both CPU/GPU and CiM implementations. Furthermore, after the hardware/software codesign adjustment, we demonstrate that our hardware/software codesign implementation of IM-ODHD¬†is able to outperform the GPU-based implementation of the same algorithm by at least 293√ó\\times/419√ó\\times in terms of training/testing latency (and on average 16.0√ó\\times/15.9√ó\\times in terms of training/testing energy consumption). Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of ODHD¬†in the realm of both software and hardware and highlights its potential for research in outlier detection. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Sec.¬†2, we discuss the fundamentals of HDC and CiM. Sec.¬†3 introduces the ODHD¬†algorithm. An SRAM-based CiM architecture for ODHD¬†(IM-ODHD) is proposed in Sec.¬†4. We evaluate the performance, energy, and latency of ODHD¬† and IM-ODHD¬†in Sec.¬†5. Related works are presented and discussed in Sec.¬†6. Finally, Sec.¬†7 concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: on hyperdimensional computing (HDC).
