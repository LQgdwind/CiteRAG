      "content": "Paper Title: Enhanced back-translation for low resource neural machine translation using self-trainingSupported by NITDEF PhD Scholarship Scheme 2018.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis work is based on a unidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder architecture with Luong attention [ref]2. This is a recurrent neural network RNMT architecture and it is summarized below. Our approach can be applied to other architectures such as the convolutional neural network NMT (CNMT) 0  and the Transformer  2. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is based on a sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder system made of neural networks that models the conditional probability of a source sentence to a target sentence [ref]1 3 [ref]2. The encoder converts the input in the source language into a set of vectors while the decoder converts the set of vectors into the target language, word by word, through an attention mechanism – introduced to keep track of context in longer sentences [ref]1. The NMT model produces the translated sentence by generating one target word at every time step. Given the “right” amount of qualitative parallel data only, the NMT model can learn the probability of mapping sentences in the source language to their equivalents in another language – the target language – word by word . Given an input sequence X=(x1,…,xTx)𝑋subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥subscript𝑇𝑥X=(x_{1},...,x_{T_{x}}), the encoder – made up of a bidirectional or unidirectional neural network with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 4 or gated recurrent units (GRU) 5 – computes the annotation vector hjsubscriptℎ𝑗h_{j}, which is a concatenation of the forward and backward hidden states hj→→subscriptℎ𝑗\\overrightarrow{h_{j}} and hj←←subscriptℎ𝑗\\overleftarrow{h_{j}} respectively. The decoder is made up of a recurrent neural network that takes a recurrent hidden state sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}, the previously translated words (y1,…,yi−1)subscript𝑦1…subscript𝑦𝑖1(y_{1},...,y_{i-1}) and a context vector cisubscript𝑐𝑖c_{i} to predict the probability of the next word yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i} as the weighted summation of the annotations hjsubscriptℎ𝑗h_{j}. An alignment model – a single layer feed-forward network which is learned jointly with the rest of the network through back-propagation – which models the probability that yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i} is aligned to xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} is used to compute the weight of each annotation hjsubscriptℎ𝑗h_{j}. All of the parameters in the NMT model, θ𝜃\\theta, are optimized to maximize the following conditional log-likelihood of the M sentence aligned bilingual samples .\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: This work is based on a unidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder architecture with Luong attention [ref]2.
