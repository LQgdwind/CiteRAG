According to the class of ranking functions considered, there are many different definitions of maxima representations.\nIn particular, the convex hull¬†[ref]32 3 and skyline¬† are two examples of maxima representations when the classes of all linear functions and nonnegative monotonic functions are considered, respectively. In practice, since maxima representations can still be overwhelmingly large¬† [ref]3, recent efforts have been directed toward reducing their sizes using approximation techniques.\nNanongkai et al.¬† were the first to propose the regret-minimizing set (RMS) problem for approximate maxima representations.\nThey introduced the regret ratio, which is the relative difference in scores between the top-ranked point of the dataset and the top-ranked point of a subset,\nas the measure of regret for a ranking function.\nThey used the maximum regret ratio, i.e., the maximum of the regret ratios over all nonnegative (monotonic) linear functions, to measure how well a subset approximates the maxima representation of a dataset.\nAn RMS is defined as the smallest subset whose maximum regret ratio was at most ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon.\nThe RMS problem was proven to be NP-hard¬†0  for any dataset in three or higher dimensions.\nSince the seminal work of Nanongkai et al., different approximation and heuristic algorithms¬†  [ref]3  4 1  0 were proposed for RMS.\nPlease refer to¬†3 for a survey of algorithmic techniques for RMS. Furthermore, several works¬†4 0 6   7   9 2 4 studied different generalizations and variations of RMS.\nChester et al.¬†4 generalized the regret ratio to kùëòk-regret ratio that expressed the score difference between the top-ranked point in the subset and the kùëòkth-ranked point in the dataset.\nAccordingly, they extended RMS to kùëòk-RMS for approximating maxima representations of top-kùëòk results (instead of top-111 results) w.r.t.¬†all ranking functions.\nDifferent RMS problems with nonlinear utility functions were studied in¬†6  .\nSpecifically, they considered convex/concave functions¬†6, multiplicative functions¬†, and submodular functions¬†, respectively, but all of which were monotonic.\nThe average regret minimization¬†7   problem has also been investigated recently.\nInstead of targeting the maximum regret ratio, it uses the average of regret ratios over all ranking functions as the measure of representativeness.\nIn another variant, Nanongkai el al.¬†9 and Xie et al.¬†2 proposed the interactive regret minimization problem by introducing user interactions to enhance RMS.\nMoreover, Asudeh et al.¬† proposed the ranking-regret representatives (RRR) in which the regret was defined by rankings instead of scores.\nSpecifically, an RRR is the smallest subset that contains at least one of\nthe top-kùëòk points in the dataset for all ranking functions.\nXie et al.¬†4 studied a dual problem of RMS called happiness maximization, where the goal is to maximize the happiness (i.e., one minus the regret) instead of minimizing the regret. Note that all above approaches to approximate maxima representations\nare designed for monotonic linear (or nonlinear, in some cases) ranking functions.\nAccordingly, most existing algorithms for RMS and related problems rely on\nthe monotonicity of ranking functions and naturally cannot be directly used for GRMR.\nTo the best of our knowledge, GRMR is the only method that considers the class of all linear\nfunctions including non-monotonic ones with negative weights as the ranking functions.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: A great variety of approaches to representing a large dataset by a small subset of data points\nhave been proposed recently¬†     2   [ref]39.\nOne important method that has been extensively investigated is maxima representation¬† 3, which finds a compact subset that contains the maxima (i.e., points with the highest scores) of a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
