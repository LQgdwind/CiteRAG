      "content": "Paper Title: Cheetah: Bridging the Gap Between Machine Learning and Particle Accelerator Physics with High-Speed, Differentiable Simulations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent work, Cheetah played a key role in the successful training of a neural network policy for tuning the transverse beam properties in a particle accelerator through the method of RL  [ref]1 [ref]5 – so-called  reinforcement learning-trained optimisation (RLO).\nSpecifically, this work considers a tuning task in the  Experimental Area (EA) beamline section at the ARES accelerator.\nThe EA is made up of a sequence {Q1,Q2,Cv,Q3,Ch}subscript𝑄1subscript𝑄2subscript𝐶𝑣subscript𝑄3subscript𝐶ℎ\\left\\{Q_{1},Q_{2},C_{v},Q_{3},C_{h}\\right\\} of two quadrupole magnets, followed by a vertical dipole magnet, a third quadrupole magnet and a horizontal dipole magnet. These magnets allow for the tuning of the transverse beam properties (μx,σx,μy,σy)subscript𝜇𝑥subscript𝜎𝑥subscript𝜇𝑦subscript𝜎𝑦\\left(\\mu_{x},\\sigma_{x},\\mu_{y},\\sigma_{y}\\right), i.e. position and size in the horizontal and vertical dimensions.\nThese properties are measured with a diagnostic screen station downstream of the magnets.\nAt ARES, transverse beam parameter tuning is commonly performed in preparations for experiments in an experimental vacuum chamber installed downstream of the EA.\nThe goal of the transverse beam tuning task in the EA is to find the magnet settings 𝒖=(kQ1,kQ2,αCv,kQ3,αCh)𝒖subscript𝑘subscript𝑄1subscript𝑘subscript𝑄2subscript𝛼subscript𝐶𝑣subscript𝑘subscript𝑄3subscript𝛼subscript𝐶ℎ\\bm{u}=\\left(k_{Q_{1}},k_{Q_{2}},\\alpha_{C_{v}},k_{Q_{3}},\\alpha_{C_{h}}\\right) that minimise the difference between the beam parameters observed on the screen 𝒃=(μx,σx,μy,σy)𝒃subscript𝜇𝑥subscript𝜎𝑥subscript𝜇𝑦subscript𝜎𝑦\\bm{b}=\\left(\\mu_{x},\\sigma_{x},\\mu_{y},\\sigma_{y}\\right) and some target beam parameters 𝒃′=(μx′,σx′,μy′,σy′)superscript𝒃′superscriptsubscript𝜇𝑥′superscriptsubscript𝜎𝑥′superscriptsubscript𝜇𝑦′superscriptsubscript𝜎𝑦′\\bm{b}^{\\prime}=\\left(\\mu_{x}^{\\prime},\\sigma_{x}^{\\prime},\\mu_{y}^{\\prime},\\sigma_{y}^{\\prime}\\right) set by a human operator.\nIn the EA, the beam entering that section 𝒃insubscript𝒃in\\bm{b}_{\\textit{in}} and the transverse misalignments 𝒎𝒎\\bm{m} of components like quadrupoles and the screen are not known, making this the transverse beam tuning task more challenging to solve.\nTo date, transverse beam tuning is mostly solved manually by experienced human operators, which requires a lot of time and makes it difficult to reproduce results. In order to solve this beam tuning task utilising RLO,\na task-specific RL loop is defined as shown in Fig. 3.\nIn this loop, the accelerator environment is implemented using Cheetah at the time of training and then replaced with the real ARES accelerator at the time of application. The Python package Gymnasium  (the successor to the previously popular OpenAI Gym [ref]42) is used to define the environment.\nA  multilayer perceptron (MLP) of two hidden layers is used as a policy model. Each layer has a width of 646464 neurons and uses a  rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation. The policy takes as input the normalised observed beam 𝒃𝒃\\bm{b}, the currently set quadrupole strengths and deflection angles of the magnets 𝒖𝒖\\bm{u}, and the target beam parameters 𝒃′superscript𝒃′\\bm{b}^{\\prime}.\nIts output is defined as normalised changes to the magnet settings 𝒂t=Δ​𝒖subscript𝒂𝑡Δ𝒖\\bm{a}_{t}=\\Delta\\bm{u}.\nThe rewards and observations are normalised using a running average during the training. The actions are normalised to the action spaces, which is [-3, 3] \\unit\\per\\squared for quadrupole strengths, [-0.6, 0.6] \\unit\\milli for vertical steering magnet, and [-0.3, 0.3] \\unit\\milli for horizontal steering magnet. The different action ranges of vertical and horizontal magnets are chosen so that they have approximately the same steering effect at the position of the diagnostics screen. To train the policy, the  Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)  algorithm is used for its relative training sample efficiency among model-free RL algorithms. Specifically, we employ the implementation provided by the Stable Baselines3  Python package.\nAs originally introduced to the field of RL for accelerators in [ref]1, domain randomisation  is performed during training by sampling magnet and screen misalignments, as well as the incoming beam parameters and the target beam from a uniform distribution at the start of each rollout episode.\nWe define the reward for transverse beam parameter tuning as with R^​(𝒔t,𝒂t)=O​(𝒖t)−O​(𝒖t+1)^𝑅subscript𝒔𝑡subscript𝒂𝑡𝑂subscript𝒖𝑡𝑂subscript𝒖𝑡1\\hat{R}\\left(\\bm{s}_{t},\\bm{a}_{t}\\right)=O\\left(\\bm{u}_{t}\\right)-O\\left(\\bm{u}_{t+1}\\right), where the objective function O​(𝒖t)𝑂subscript𝒖𝑡O\\left(\\bm{u}_{t}\\right) is the logarithmic and weighted difference between the observed and target beams A weight vector 𝒘=(1,2,1,2)𝒘1212\\bm{w}=\\left($1$,$2$,$1$,$2$\\right) was chosen for the final training. The policy is trained over a total of 6 000 00060000006\\,000\\,000 interactions with the Cheetah environment. One interaction with the real environment involves sending new set points to the magnet power supplies, waiting for the power supplies to finish ramping to their set points, and taking multiple images of the diagnostic screen with the beam turned on and with the beam turned off.\nAltogether this process takes ca. \\qtyrange1020.\nConsequently, training on the real ARES accelerator would take about 333 years of continuous beam time.\nWith beam time a scarce resource, such a long training is infeasible.\nFast simulations like Cheetah can be computed faster than real time and enable us to collect the equivalent of many years of real time experience in much more feasible time frames. As was shown in Section II.4, Cheetah is especially fast, allowing for the equivalent of 333 years of experience to be collected in just \\qty27.\nOther RL algorithms such as  Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) also allow for parallel rollouts on multiple environments. Using a simulation like Cheetah means that experience could be collected even faster in this case, while we usually do not have access to multiple of the same accelerator for training. Despite having been trained using a comparatively simple simulation and deployed to the real world zero-shot without fine-tuning, our RL policy successfully tunes the transverse beam parameters on the real accelerator, finding magnet settings that achieve beam parameters closer to the target than those found by other state-of-the-art black-box optimisation algorithms. Moreover, the trained policy converges on these magnet settings in just a few samples, tuning the beam in less wall time than human operators while achieving comparable results.\nAn example of a trained policy from [ref]5 tuning the transverse beam parameters in the EA is shown in Fig. 4.\nHere it can be observed that the target transverse beam parameters of 𝒃′=(\\qty−0.61​\\milli,\\qty​0.26​\\milli,\\qty​1.03​\\milli,\\qty​0.35​\\milli)superscript𝒃′\\qty0.61\\milli\\qty0.26\\milli\\qty1.03\\milli\\qty0.35\\milli\\bm{b}^{\\prime}=\\left(\\qty{-0.61}{\\milli},\\qty{0.26}{\\milli},\\qty{1.03}{\\milli},\\qty{0.35}{\\milli}\\right) are reached after about 666 steps.\nFor more detailed results and discussions, please refer to [ref]1 [ref]5.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: In recent work, Cheetah played a key role in the successful training of a neural network policy for tuning the transverse beam properties in a particle accelerator through the method of RL  [ref]1 [ref]5 – so-called  reinforcement learning-trained optimisation (RLO).\nSpecifically, this work considers a tuning task in the  Experimental Area (EA) beamline section at the ARES\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
