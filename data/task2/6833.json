      "content": "Paper Title: A Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Wireless Communication Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the recent years, energy efficiency in wireless communication networks has been the primary focus for a number of research studies, addressing the problem from different perspectives through the exploitation of resource orchestration, computation offloading, as well as load balancing strategies. A subset of research works is tackling the problem of energy efficiency, considering generic (non FL related) computation tasks [ref]16    . In [ref]16, the authors consider two computation offloading schemes for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems, improving the energy efficiency for latency-constrained computation by optimizing the available resources. Zhang et al. in  introduce an improved SAC algorithm towards a joint optimization of partial task offloading and resource allocation decisions. Another work  presents a knowledge plane-based MANO framework, using a twin-delayed double-Q SAC method towards energy consumption and Virtual Network Function instantiation cost minimization. In , the authors propose a Q-learning and Double Deep Q Networks (DDQN)-based methods to determine the joint policy of computation offloading and resource allocation in a dynamic MEC system. AlQerm et al. in , propose an online RL methodology to determine the most energy efficient traffic offloading strategy. There is a number of proposed solutions that consider an FL process as a use case, targeting to address energy-related challenges   [ref]20    [ref]19  . The work in  presents a framework that targets to minimize the overall energy consumption of a Federated Edge Intelligence -supported IoT network, using the Alternate Convex Search algorithm. The authors in  propose a joint resource allocation scheme for FL in IoT, aiming at the minimization of the system and learning costs by jointly optimizing bandwidth, computation frequency, transmission power allocation and sub-carrier assignment. Mo et al. [ref]20 focus on minimizing the total energy consumption of an FL system, by optimizing both communication and computational resources using techniques from convex optimization. Another work , proposes energy-efficient strategies for bandwidth allocation and scheduling, so as to reduce the energy consumption, while warranting learning performance in an FL framework. In  a bisection-based algorithm is proposed, whose goal is to minimize the total energy consumption of an FL system under a latency constraint. Zhang et al.  present an energy-efficient FL framework for Digital Twin-enabled IIoT that exploits a DDQN, in order to jointly optimize training strategies and resource allocation, considering a dynamic environment. Another work [ref]19, through the use of a Proximal Policy Optimization-based actor-critic method, targets the energy efficiency improvement of FL, by jointly minimizing the learning time and energy consumption. The authors in  exploit the merits of Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient in resource allocation, addressing the challenges of FL in an Internet of Vehicles (IoV) scenario. Nguyen et al.  propose a Deep Q Learning (DQL) algorithm concerning the resource allocation, in a mobility-aware FL network, which aims to maximize the number of successful transmissions, while minimizing the energy and channel costs. The work  targets to optimize the performance of an FL model, using multi-agent RL, while considering energy-related requirements. The authors in  propose an RL solution for device selection at each communication round, towards FL performance optimization. It must be noted that only a limited amount of the state-of-the-art works     [ref]19 propose solutions that can be deployed in a run-time manner, taking into account the dynamicity of wireless network environments. Also, only the authors in [ref]20 take into account the FL modelâ€™s complexity in conjunction with its size that could significantly affect the total energy consumption of the system. Moreover, there are no related works incorporating the wasted amount of consumed energy for any unfinished FL task (e.g. due to time limit) as part of the solution. Also, none of the existing RL works consider the energy cost that is required, while exploring for energy efficient strategies. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first work that addresses the minimization of the overall FL related energy consumption and communication channel occupancy in a run-time and safe  manner, tailored to any time-varying wireless network environment, while taking into account the FL modelâ€™s performance and complexity. Finally, this work towards addressing the energy cost of the offline RL phase, proposes a computationally cost effective FL environment that emulates a real FL process.
