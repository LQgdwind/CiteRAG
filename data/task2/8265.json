      "content": "Paper Title: Improving the Leading Constant of Matrix Multiplication\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section we will prove Theorem 2.2 and show that our approach can be applied to the current best fast matrix multiplication algorithm to improve its leading constant. We first state the current best result and briefly explain its techniques. Let ω0<2.372subscript𝜔02.372\\omega_{0}<2.372 denote the current best bound on ω𝜔\\omega. Then, there is a function f:ℕ→(0,1):𝑓→ℕ01f:\\mathbb{N}\\to(0,1) with f​(N)=1Θ​(log⁡N)𝑓𝑁1Θ𝑁f(N)=\\frac{1}{\\Theta(\\sqrt{\\log N})} such that: For all positive integers N𝑁N, there exist integers m,H,C𝑚𝐻𝐶m,H,C with m,H=2Θ​(N)𝑚𝐻superscript2Θ𝑁m,H=2^{\\Theta(N)} and C≤2O​(N/log⁡N)𝐶superscript2𝑂𝑁𝑁C\\leq 2^{O(N/\\log N)} such that and This is the result of the laser method application of  [ref]3, which ultimately applies the asymptotic sum inequality to conclude that and then takes the limit as N→∞→𝑁N\\to\\infty. The parameter C𝐶C denotes the number of copies of the tensor one must make to fix the ‘holes’ which appear in the matrix multiplication tensors in their construction; see [56, Corollary 4.2; see also Sections 5.6, 6.6 and 7].\n∎ Before proceeding, we calculate what leading coefficient we would obtain if we are to design an algorithm with this result using the standard recursive approach. Suppose we are aiming for an algorithm with exponent ω0+εsubscript𝜔0𝜀\\omega_{0}+\\varepsilon. We thus require f​(N)=1Θ​(log⁡N)<ε𝑓𝑁1Θ𝑁𝜀f(N)=\\frac{1}{\\Theta(\\sqrt{\\log N})}<\\varepsilon, and so we need log⁡N=Θ​(1/ε2)𝑁Θ1superscript𝜀2\\log N=\\Theta(1/\\varepsilon^{2}) and therefore\nN=2Θ​(1/ε2)𝑁superscript2Θ1superscript𝜀2N=2^{\\Theta(1/\\varepsilon^{2})}. As a consequence, m,H=2Θ​(N)=22Θ​(1/ε2)𝑚𝐻superscript2Θ𝑁superscript2superscript2Θ1superscript𝜀2m,H=2^{\\Theta(N)}=2^{2^{\\Theta(1/\\varepsilon^{2})}}. When applying Theorem 7.1 for multiplying matrices, the current algorithm in   [ref]3 uses the asymptotic sum inequality (Lemma 5.5) which shows that for any s≥1𝑠1s\\geq 1, Then one can use the tensor ⟨ms,ms,ms⟩superscript𝑚𝑠superscript𝑚𝑠superscript𝑚𝑠\\langle m^{s},m^{s},m^{s}\\rangle to recursively multiply mk×mksuperscript𝑚𝑘superscript𝑚𝑘m^{k}\\times m^{k} matrices with an operation count Therefore, the leading coefficient 3​m2​s⋅Hk/s⋅3superscript𝑚2𝑠superscript𝐻𝑘𝑠3m^{2s}\\cdot H^{k/s} of the usual algorithm can be optimized to for some s=Θ​(k​log⁡Hlog⁡m)𝑠Θ𝑘𝐻𝑚s=\\Theta\\Big{(}\\sqrt{\\frac{k\\log H}{\\log m}}\\Big{)}. In that case, we have Let M=mk𝑀superscript𝑚𝑘M=m^{k} such that we are multiplying M×M𝑀𝑀M\\times M matrices. The leading coefficient scales exponentially with k=log⁡Mlog⁡m𝑘𝑀𝑚\\sqrt{k}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log M}{\\log m}} with a huge constant depending on ε𝜀\\varepsilon. We use C0​(ε)subscript𝐶0𝜀C_{0}(\\varepsilon) to represent this huge constant 22O​(1/ε2)superscript2superscript2𝑂1superscript𝜀22^{2^{O(1/\\varepsilon^{2})}} such that the leading coefficient is However, in order for this approach using ⟨m,m,m⟩𝑚𝑚𝑚\\langle m,m,m\\rangle to be valid, we must have M≥m𝑀𝑚M\\geq m since k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1, which means The leading coefficient is therefore at least Finally, define C​(ε)=C0​(ε)𝐶𝜀subscript𝐶0𝜀C(\\varepsilon)=\\sqrt{C_{0}(\\varepsilon)} such that This is the C​(ε)𝐶𝜀C(\\varepsilon) which appears in Theorem 2.2 above. We now show that we could give a better upper bound that is independent with respect to the input size using our algorithm. Let ω0<2.372subscript𝜔02.372\\omega_{0}<2.372 denote the current best bound on ω𝜔\\omega. Then there is a function f:ℕ→(0,1):𝑓→ℕ01f:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow(0,1) with f​(N)=1Θ​(log⁡N)𝑓𝑁1Θ𝑁f(N)=\\frac{1}{\\Theta(\\sqrt{\\log N})} such that: For all positive integers N𝑁N, there exists integers m,H,C𝑚𝐻𝐶m,H,C with m,H=2Θ​(N)𝑚𝐻superscript2Θ𝑁m,H=2^{\\Theta(N)} and C≤2O​(N/log⁡N)𝐶superscript2𝑂𝑁𝑁C\\leq 2^{O(N/\\log N)} such that for sufficiently large k𝑘k. Before proving Theorem 7.3, we first compare our new leading constant with the previous leading coefficient. Our new leading constant is at most which not only does not depend on the input size but also is strictly better since O​(ε2)<12𝑂superscript𝜀212O(\\varepsilon^{2})<\\frac{1}{2}. In addition, our coefficient for the lower order term m2​ksuperscript𝑚2𝑘m^{2k} also does not depend on the input size and is not too big compared to the leading constant: We use Theorem 7.1 as the tensor needed by our algorithm in Theorem 6.6 (with a=b=c=1𝑎𝑏𝑐1a=b=c=1). For parameter N𝑁N that we will select, let H,m,C,f𝐻𝑚𝐶𝑓H,m,C,f be as in Theorem 7.1 and let r=R​(⟨m,m,m⟩)𝑟𝑅𝑚𝑚𝑚r=R(\\langle m,m,m\\rangle). Theorem 6.6 gives us that for any sufficiently large positive integer k𝑘k, By Lemma 6.7 we know O​(7N)≤R​(CW5⊗N)≤O​(N⋅7N)𝑂superscript7𝑁𝑅superscriptsubscriptCW5tensor-productabsent𝑁𝑂⋅𝑁superscript7𝑁O(7^{N})\\leq R(\\textup{CW}_{5}^{\\otimes N})\\leq O(N\\cdot 7^{N}), and therefore O​(7N)≤H⋅mω0+f​(N)C𝑂superscript7𝑁⋅𝐻superscript𝑚subscript𝜔0𝑓𝑁𝐶O(7^{N})\\leq\\frac{H\\cdot m^{\\omega_{0}+f(N)}}{C}. We substitute this to get: By our choice of m,H,N𝑚𝐻𝑁m,H,N, Let C1,C2,C3>0subscript𝐶1subscript𝐶2subscript𝐶30C_{1},C_{2},C_{3}>0 be constants such that We use the result in Theorem 7.1 with N𝑁\\sqrt{N} to obtain Lemma 5.5 (with s=N𝑠𝑁s=\\sqrt{N}) implies that Therefore, we know which implies that (recall f​(N)=1Θ​(log⁡N)𝑓𝑁1Θ𝑁f(N)=\\frac{1}{\\Theta(\\sqrt{\\log N})}) Therefore, the leading constant of our algorithm is upper bounded by and the coefficient for the lower-order term m2​ksuperscript𝑚2𝑘m^{2k} is ∎\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: integers m,H,C𝑚𝐻𝐶m,H,C with m,H=2Θ​(N)𝑚𝐻superscript2Θ𝑁m,H=2^{\\Theta(N)} and C≤2O​(N/log⁡N)𝐶superscript2𝑂𝑁𝑁C\\leq 2^{O(N/\\log N)} such that and This is the result of the laser method application of  [ref]3, which ultimately applies the asymptotic sum inequality to conclude that and then takes the limit as N→∞→𝑁N\\to\\infty.
