      "content": "Paper Title: Accuracy-Privacy Trade-off in Deep Ensemble: A Membership Inference Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMembership inference is a form of privacy leakage where the goal is to determine if a sample was used during the training of a target model. Samples used during training are often referred to as member or train samples, and other samples are referred to as non-member, non-train, or test samples. Majority of the membership inference attacks are built on the intuition that a trained model outputs greater confidence on member samples than non-member samples. Hence, they often use confidence values as an attack feature. The first MI attack on neural networks, refereed to as Shokri’s attack, was proposed in [ref]15 where the attacker trains an attack classifier to predict the membership status. The attack classifier takes the prediction confidence of the victim model as an input. The intuition is that the confidence values are often greater for train samples in comparison with non-train samples . Hence, assuming that the attacker has access to a dataset with a similar distribution, she trains a set of shadow models to mimic the victim model. Since the membership status of the data with which the shadow models are trained are known to the attacker, she can use the data to train the attack classifier. Many papers use the same idea with different variations or less restrictive assumptions          . These confidence-based approaches suffer from low accuracy because they cannot distinguish hard member samples (for which the confidence is low) from easy non-member samples (for which the confidence is high). The state-of-the-art membership inference attacks aim to solve this issue by calibrating the confidence so that it takes the difficulty of the target sample into account [ref]31  . The most recent state-of-the-art MI attack with difficulty calibration is proposed in [ref]31. In this Watson attack, the attacker trains multiple shadow models with datasets that exclude the target sample. Thus, the attacker can obtain the average confidence of the target sample when the sample is absent from the training data. During the attack, the attacker obtains the attack score by subtracting the obtained average confidence from the confidence output of the target model. Hence, the large attack score is an indication of a member sample.\nIn , authors propose the subpopulation-based MI attack that instead of calibrating the difficulty by training multiple shadow models, they use samples from the same subpopulation as the target sample to estimate the average model response. The intuition is that if the confidence of the victim model is significantly higher on the target samples in comparison with similar samples, it is an indication of a member sample. This attack achieves similar accuracy as other calibration-based attacks, while decreasing the training computation cost of shadow models significantly.\n‘ Most previous work built upon the idea of using prediction confidence to infer the membership status, except   [ref]12. In , the authors assumed white-box access to the target model and launched a series of MI attack based on confidence values, distance to the decision boundary, gradient w.r.t model weight, and gradient w.r.t input. Interestingly, none of those approaches significantly outperforms confidence-based attack. In , the authors proposed two attacks based on input transformation and distance to the boundary in a black-box setting. Similarly, in [ref]12, they propose the sampling attack that randomly perturbs an input to obtain a set of random transformations of the input and uses the predicted labels to infer membership status. The intuition is that deep models are more robust on training samples. As a result, perturbed training samples are less likely to be labeled as a class different from the unperturbed training sample. The attack simply counts the number of perturbed samples that has different label than the unperturbed sample as an MI attack feature. In [ref]12 shows that DP-SGD can effectively defend against the sampling attack, at the cost of accuracy. In this paper, we illustrate the results of Shokri’s shadow model attack [ref]15, Watson’s MI attack with sample difficulty calibration [ref]31, and sampling attack [ref]12. As shown in , most confidence-based and loss-based membership inference attacks that do not use sample difficulty calibration achieve similar performance. Thus, we only show the results of Shokri’s original attack in this paper. Furthermore, the other variations of the membership inference attacks with sample difficulty   achieve similar accuracy in comparison with [ref]31. Decision boundary-based attacks are extremely computational and query inefficient.\nGradient-based approach of  also needs full knowledge of the entire deep ensemble. We also show the accuracy of sampling attack [ref]12 because it only needs black-box access to the defender’s model.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: on member samples than non-member samples.
