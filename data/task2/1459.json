      "content": "Paper Title: Unifying Relational Sentence Generation and Retrieval for Medical Image Report Composition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAutomatic generation of medical image reports has recently attracted increasing research interests [ref]1  , which has a significant potential to simplify the diagnostic procedure and reduce the burden of physicians. Besides the difficulties shared with captioning and visual question answering (VQA) (e.g. fine-grained visual processing and reasoning, bridging visual and linguistic modalities), the medical report composition must have a plausible logic and consistent topics to complete a long narrative consisting of multiple sentences or paragraphs. Moreover, a task-oriented challenge requires predicting not only the highly accurate medical term diagnosis but also the heterogeneous forms of information including impression and findings. Deep neural network architectures [ref]4   [ref]7, sequence-to-sequence models   and visual attention mechanisms    have been widely adopted in both image captioning and VQA, which improve performance by learning to focus on the salient regions of the image. However, without other prior knowledge on the visual content, such computed visual attention may concentrate on irrelevant regions. Furthermore, few methods have considered key entities, topic relationships and paragraph consistency, which are most likely to generate similar sentences in one report or similar reports for different medical images, due to the dataset bias. In general, radiologists first check a patientâ€™s images for peculiar regions, think of correlations among prominent symptoms, then write sentences according to the keywords following certain patterns for the normal cases and adjust statements for the specific cases. In this paper, we adopted a similar methodology and proposed a Unifying Retrieval and Relational-topic sentence Generation framework, named Relation-paraNet, which incorporates the semantic consistency of medical terms into the reports and encourages the sentence generation for rare abnormal descriptions. Specifically, our Relation-paraNet exploits hybrid-knowledge co-reasoning in two ways. First, we explore explicit relationships among all abnormal medical terms to induce the visual attention learning and topic representation encoding for better topic-oriented symptom descriptions. We pay attention to the abnormal medical terms that reflect the keywords of the reports and introduce the relational-topic to guide the sentence generation. We further excavate the semantic consistency among all abnormal keywords and conduct abnormality classification to induce visual attention learning. On the other hand, to generate better topic-oriented symptom descriptions, we integrate visual features and abnormality relations for topic representation, which is essential to depict the principal idea of the independent sentence in the report. Furthermore, inspired by the fact that radiologists often write reports based on templates, we introduce an Adaptive Generator that changes between the template retrieval and sentence generation according to a contextual topic encoder. We employ a retrieval classification module to decide the choice for either automatically generating sentences or retrieving specific sentences from the template database. The template database is based on human prior knowledge collected from available medical reports. To enable effective and robust report composition, we take the integral generated sentences into concern and encode such paragraph information back into the network to produce the next sentence. Experimental results show that by unifying retrieval paragraph and relational topic, our Relation-paraNet is able to generate more accurate and professional medical reports. Our contributions are summarized in the following aspects. Aiming at resolving the task-oriented challenges of medical report composition, we make the first attempt to incorporate the semantic consistency of medical terms into the final reports and encourage the precise sentence generation for rare abnormal descriptions. We introduce a Unifying Retrieval and Relational-topic driven Generation framework, named Relation-paraNet, which integrates a Relational-Topic Encoder to learn explicit semantic consistency among medical terms and an Adaptive Generator to change between the template retrieval and sentence generation for more natural medical report composition. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art works on two medical report datasets and achieves an appealing performance under human evaluation. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II\npresents a brief review of related work. Section III introduces\nthe pipeline of our method, including the\nmodel formulation and the optimization method. The\nexperimental results, comparisons, and component analysis\nare presented in Section IV. Section V concludes the paper with a discussion of future work.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Automatic generation of medical image reports has recently attracted increasing research interests [ref]1  , which has a significant potential to simplify the diagnostic procedure and reduce the burden of physicians.
