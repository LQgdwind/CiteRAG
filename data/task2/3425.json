      "content": "Paper Title: Locally Differentially Private Distributed Deep Learning via Knowledge Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLocal Differential Privacy (LDP) has been proposed  to remove the trusted curator of the centralized differential privacy. LDP also provides the data owner more controls on the information left hands in a more strict and realistic privacy manner. LDP for statistical information collection and estimation have been well studied in the past decades  [ref]36  [ref]37    . Recently, more works propose to apply DP or LDP in data mining and machine learning applications, such as clustering , Bayesian inference , frequent itemset mining  and probability distribution estimation    . However, only a few recent works aim to use LDP in deep learning.\nFor instance, Abadi et al.  propose to train the deep neural network via stochastic gradient descent with differential privacy under a centralized setting. However, it not only requires an impractical trusted third party to serve as the trusted curator but also has the privacy budget exploding issue (i.e., causing impractical huge privacy budget to train a meaningful deep learning model). Papernot et al. [ref]10 proposes PATE, a “teacher-student” paradigm for privacy-preserving deep learning, where each data owner learns a teacher model using its own (local) private dataset, and the data user aims to learn a student model using the unlabelled public data (but no direct access to the data owners’ private data) to mimic the output of the ensemble of the teacher models, i.e., the student learns to make predictions that is the same as the most number of teachers. To ensure privacy, PATE [ref]10 assumes a trusted aggregator to provide a differentially private query interface, where the data user could query the ensemble of the teacher models (from the data owners) using the unlabelled public data to obtain the labels for the training of the student model. However, a fully trusted aggregator barely exists in most of the real-world distributed deep learning scenarios.\nChase et al.  proposes a private collaborative neural network learning approach, that combines secure multi-party computation (MPC), differential privacy (DP) and secret sharing. Since the MPC protocol is implemented via a garbled circuit whose size is subject to the number of parameters (i.e., the size of the gradient) of the neural network, it tends to be less efficient and not scalable while training larger neural networks. Also, in , using secret sharing requires at least two non-colluding honest data users which might not be practical.\nIn , the authors present a federated optimization algorithm under private manner. Instead of directly averaging the distributed client models updates, an alter approach that use random sampling and Gaussian mechanism on sum of clients updates is introduced to approximate the averaging. The curator collects the noisy updates to optimize the center server model. However, this approach only focus on training small deep learning models (i.e., only training one or very few number of iterations) and easier datasets (i.e., not testing on any image datasets). Our approach aims to solve the challenges left by the previous approaches. The difference could be summarized in three folds: (i) our approach aims to enable training large deep neural networks (e.g., ResNet) on popular benchmark image datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10); (ii) our approach designs a proactive mechanism (i.e., the active query sampling) to reduce the overall privacy budget efficiently to prevent privacy budget exploding while training large deep neural networks; (iii) our approach is not based on federated learning, thus does not have to satisfy the requirements of performing federated learning (e.g., clients being online around the same time period).\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: owner more controls on the information left hands in a more strict and realistic privacy manner.
