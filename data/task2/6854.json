      "content": "Paper Title: Will More Expressive Graph Neural Networks do Better on Generative Tasks?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe graph convolution operation of the original GCN   can be defined as follows: where ci​jsubscript𝑐𝑖𝑗c_{ij} is a normalisation constant for each edge ℰi​jsubscriptℰ𝑖𝑗\\mathcal{E}_{ij} which originates from using the symmetrically normalised adjacency matrix D−12​AD−12superscriptD12superscriptAD12\\textbf{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\textbf{A}\\textbf{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}, W(l)superscriptW𝑙\\textbf{W}^{(l)} is a learnable weight matrix, and σ𝜎\\sigma is a non-linear activation function. R-GCN  [ref]6 makes use of the relational data of the graphs, and extends the graph convolution operation to the following: let ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} be the edge relation type (for molecular graphs, this can be the bond type), then where 𝒩irsubscriptsuperscript𝒩𝑟𝑖\\mathcal{N}^{r}_{i} denotes the set of neighbouring nodes of node i𝑖i under relation r∈ℛ𝑟ℛr\\in\\mathcal{R}, ci,rsubscript𝑐𝑖𝑟c_{i,r} is a problem-specific normalisation constant that can either be learnt or chosen in advance and Wr(l)superscriptsubscriptW𝑟𝑙\\textbf{W}_{r}^{(l)} denotes the learnable matrix for edge type r𝑟r. It has been shown that neither GCN nor R-GCN is as expressive as the 1-WL test [ref]29. Each GIN  [ref]29 layer updates the node features as follows: where ϕ(l)superscriptitalic-ϕ𝑙\\phi^{(l)} is an MLP, and ϵ(l)superscriptitalic-ϵ𝑙\\epsilon^{(l)} is a learnable scalar. GIN is provably as expressive as the 1-WL test,\nwhich makes it one of the maximally-expressive GNNs (proof in [ref]29). The PNA  operator defines its aggregation function ⨁direct-sum\\bigoplus as a combination of neighbourhood-aggregators and degree-scalers, as defined by the following equation, with ⊗tensor-product\\otimes being the tensor product: The PNA operator can then be inserted into the standard MPNN framework, obtaining the PNA layer: where ϕ(l)superscriptitalic-ϕ𝑙\\phi^{(l)} and ψ(l)superscript𝜓𝑙\\psi^{(l)} are MLPs. According to the theorem that in order to discriminate between multisets of size n𝑛n whose underlying set is R𝑅R, at least n𝑛n aggregators are needed (proof in ), PNA pushes its expressivity closer towards the 1-WL limit than GIN, by including more aggregators, thereby increasing the probability that at least one of the aggregators can distinguish different graphs. GSN  adopts a feature-augmented message passing style by counting the appearance of certain graph substructures and encoding them into the features. The feature augmentation of GSN then works as follows: let 𝒢={G1,⋯,GK}𝒢subscript𝐺1⋯subscript𝐺𝐾\\mathcal{G}=\\left\\{G_{1},\\cdots,G_{K}\\right\\} be a set of pre-computed small (connected) graphs. For each Gk=(𝒱k,ℰk)subscript𝐺𝑘subscript𝒱𝑘subscriptℰ𝑘G_{k}=(\\mathcal{V}_{k},\\mathcal{E}_{k}) in 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}, we first find its isomorphic subgraphs Gk′=(𝒱k′,ℰk′)superscriptsubscript𝐺𝑘′superscriptsubscript𝒱𝑘′superscriptsubscriptℰ𝑘′G_{k}^{\\prime}=(\\mathcal{V}_{k}^{\\prime},\\mathcal{E}_{k}^{\\prime}) in G=(𝒱,ℰ)𝐺𝒱ℰG=(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E}). Then, for each node i∈V𝑖𝑉i\\in V and 1≤k≤K1𝑘𝐾1\\leq k\\leq K, we count the number of subgraphs Gk′superscriptsubscript𝐺𝑘′G_{k}^{\\prime} node i𝑖i belongs to, as defined by the equation below: We then obtain the node structural features for each node i∈𝒱𝑖𝒱i\\in\\mathcal{V}: xi𝒱=[xG1𝒱​(i),⋯,xGk𝒱​(i)]∈ℕKsubscriptsuperscriptx𝒱𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝒱subscript𝐺1𝑖⋯subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝒱subscript𝐺𝑘𝑖superscriptℕ𝐾\\textbf{x}^{\\mathcal{V}}_{i}=\\left[x^{\\mathcal{V}}_{G_{1}}(i),\\cdots,x^{\\mathcal{V}}_{G_{k}}(i)\\right]\\in\\mathbb{N}^{K}. Similarly, we can derive the edge structural features for each edge (i,j)∈ℰ𝑖𝑗ℰ(i,j)\\in\\mathcal{E}: xi​jℰ=[xG1ℰ​(i,j),⋯,xGkℰ​(i,j)]∈ℕKsubscriptsuperscriptxℰ𝑖𝑗subscriptsuperscript𝑥ℰsubscript𝐺1𝑖𝑗⋯subscriptsuperscript𝑥ℰsubscript𝐺𝑘𝑖𝑗superscriptℕ𝐾\\textbf{x}^{\\mathcal{E}}_{ij}=\\left[x^{\\mathcal{E}}_{G_{1}}(i,j),\\cdots,x^{\\mathcal{E}}_{G_{k}}(i,j)\\right]\\in\\mathbb{N}^{K} by counting the numbers of subgraphs it belongs to: The augmented features can then be inserted into the messages and follow the standard MPNN, obtaining two variants of GSN layer, GSN-v (vertex-count) and GSN-e (edge-count): where ϕ(l)superscriptitalic-ϕ𝑙\\phi^{(l)} and ψ(l)superscript𝜓𝑙\\psi^{(l)} are MLPs and ⨁direct-sum\\bigoplus is a permutation-invariant local neighbourhood aggregation function, such as sum, mean or max. It can be proved that GSN is strictly more expressive than the 1-WL test, when Gksubscript𝐺𝑘G_{k} is any graph except for the star graphs (i.e., one center nodes connected to one of multiple outer nodes) of any size, and structural features are inferred by subgraph matching (proof in ). This essentially suggests that GSN is more expressive than R-GCN which is at most as expressive as the 1-WL test in general. GearNet  uses an R-GCN [ref]6 as a fundamental framework to develop a node features and edge features message passing mechanism. Each GearNet layer updates the node features as follows: where ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} is the edge relation type, 𝒩irsubscriptsuperscript𝒩𝑟𝑖\\mathcal{N}^{r}_{i} denotes the set of neighbouring nodes of node i𝑖i under relation r∈ℛ𝑟ℛr\\in\\mathcal{R}, BN denotes a batch normalisation layer, Wr(l)superscriptsubscriptW𝑟𝑙\\textbf{W}_{r}^{(l)} is the learnable convolutional kernel matrix for edge type r𝑟r, and σ𝜎\\sigma is a non-linear activation function. To model the interactions between edges, we first construct a relational graph G′=(𝒱′,ℰ′,ℛ′)superscript𝐺′superscript𝒱′superscriptℰ′superscriptℛ′G^{\\prime}=\\left(\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime},\\mathcal{E}^{\\prime},\\mathcal{R}^{\\prime}\\right) among edges. Each node in the graph G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} corresponds to an edge in the original graph. G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} links edge (i,j,r1)𝑖𝑗subscript𝑟1(i,j,r_{1}) in the original graph to edge (w,k,r2)𝑤𝑘subscript𝑟2(w,k,r_{2}) if and only if j=w𝑗𝑤j=w and i≠k𝑖𝑘i\\neq k. The type of this edge is determined by the angle between (i,j,r1)𝑖𝑗subscript𝑟1(i,j,r_{1}) and (w,k,r2)𝑤𝑘subscript𝑟2(w,k,r_{2}). The angular information reflects the relative position between two edges that determines the strength of their interaction . Similar to R-GCN, the GearNet edge message passing layer is defined as: Similar as Eq. (12), the message function for edge (i,j,r1)𝑖𝑗subscript𝑟1(i,j,r_{1}) will be updated by aggregating features from its neighbours 𝒩′(i,j,r1)rsubscriptsuperscriptsuperscript𝒩′𝑟𝑖𝑗subscript𝑟1\\mathcal{N^{\\prime}}^{r}_{(i,j,r_{1})}, where 𝒩′(i,j,r1)r={(w,k,r2)∈𝒱′|((w,k,r2),(i,j,r1),r)∈ℰ′}subscriptsuperscriptsuperscript𝒩′𝑟𝑖𝑗subscript𝑟1conditional-set𝑤𝑘subscript𝑟2superscript𝒱′𝑤𝑘subscript𝑟2𝑖𝑗subscript𝑟1𝑟superscriptℰ′\\mathcal{N^{\\prime}}^{r}_{(i,j,r_{1})}=\\{(w,k,r_{2})\\in\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime}|((w,k,r_{2}),(i,j,r_{1}),r)\\in\\mathcal{E}^{\\prime}\\}. Finally, the entire GearNet message passing layer can be expressed as: where FC denotes a linear transformation on the message function. GearNet is more expressive than R-GCN for its sparse edge message passing mechanism which encodes spatial information of a graph. In order to generalise the standard averaging or max-pooling aggregators in GNNs, GAT  applies attention-based neighbourhood aggregation as its aggregation function to obtain sufficient expressive power to transform the input features into higher-level features. The normalised masked attention coefficient for node i𝑖i is defined as: where a is a learnable weight vector, representing the attention mechanism a𝑎a: a single-layer feedforward neural network, W is a learnable input linear transformation’s weight matrix and ∥∥\\| represents concatenation operation. Each K𝐾K multi-head attention GAT layer updates the node features as follows: where ∥∥\\| represents concatenation, αi​jksuperscriptsubscript𝛼𝑖𝑗𝑘\\alpha_{ij}^{k} are normalised attention coefficients computed by the k𝑘k-th attention mechanism (ak)superscript𝑎𝑘(a^{k}), and WksuperscriptW𝑘\\textbf{W}^{k} is the corresponding input linear transformation’s weight matrix. GAT computes a representation for every node as a weighted average of its neighbours through the attention mechanism, which is more flexible than the neighbourhood aggregation in R-GCN. GATv2 [ref]7 adopts a strictly more expressive dynamic graph attention mechanism [ref]7 in its aggregation function to learn the graph representation. The graph attention variant that has a universal approximator attention function. The normalised masked dynamic attention coefficient for node i𝑖i is defined as: where a is a learnable weight vector, representing the attention mechanism a𝑎a: a single-layer feedforward neural network, W is a learnable input linear transformation’s weight matrix and ∥∥\\| represents concatenation operation. Each K𝐾K multi-head attention GATv2 layer updates the node features as follows: where ∥∥\\| represents concatenation, αi​jksuperscriptsubscript𝛼𝑖𝑗𝑘\\alpha_{ij}^{k} are normalised dynamic attention coefficients computed by the k𝑘k-th attention mechanism (ak)superscript𝑎𝑘(a^{k}), and WksuperscriptW𝑘\\textbf{W}^{k} is the corresponding input linear transformation’s weight matrix. It has been proved that GATv2 – a graph attention variant that has a universal approximator attention function, and is thus strictly more expressive than GAT (proof in [ref]7).\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: W(l)superscriptW𝑙\\textbf{W}^{(l)} is a learnable weight matrix, and σ𝜎\\sigma is a non-linear activation function.
