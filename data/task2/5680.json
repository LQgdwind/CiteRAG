      "content": "Paper Title: Taming Contrast Maximization for Learning Sequential, Low-latency, Event-based Optical Flow\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEvent cameras capture per-pixel log-brightness changes at microsecond resolution [ref]13.††The project’s code and additional material can be found at https://mavlab.tudelft.nl/taming_event_flow/. This operating principle results in a sparse and asynchronous visual signal that, under constant illumination, directly encodes information about the apparent motion (i.e., optical flow) of contrast in the image space. These cameras offer several advantages, such as low latency and robustness to motion blur [ref]13, and hence hold the potential of a high-bandwidth\nestimation of this optical flow information. However, the event-based nature of the generated visual signal poses a paradigm shift in the processing pipeline, and traditional, frame-based algorithms become suboptimal and often incompatible. Despite this, the majority of learning-based methods that have been proposed so far for event-based optical flow estimation are still highly influenced by frame-based approaches. This influence is normally reflected in two key aspects of their pipelines: (i) the design of the network architecture, and (ii) the formulation of the loss function. Regarding architecture design, most literature methods format subsets of the input events as dense volumetric representations  that are processed at once by stateless (i.e., non-recurrent) models   [ref]30 . Similarly to their frame-based counterparts   , these models estimate the per-pixel displacement over the time-length of the event volume using only the information contained within it. Consequently, these volumes need to encode enough spatiotemporal information for motion to be discernible. However, if done over relatively long time periods, the subsequent models suffer from limitations such as high latency or having to deal with large pixel displacements   . With respect to the loss function, multiple options have been explored due to the lack of real-world datasets with per-event ground truth. Pure supervised learning can be used with datasets such as MVSEC  or DSEC-Flow , but their ground truth only contains per-pixel displacement at low frequencies, which makes models difficult to train. On the other hand, a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework can be formulated using either the accompanying frames with the photometric error as a loss   , or through an events-only contrast maximization   proxy loss for motion compensation (i.e., event deblurring)   [ref]30 [ref]19 . However, despite not relying on ground truth, all the literature on SSL for optical flow assumes that the events move linearly within the time window of the loss, which ignores much of the potential of event cameras and their high temporal resolution (see Fig. 1, bottom left). In this work, we focus on the estimation of high frequency event-based optical flow and how this can be learned in an SSL fashion using contrast maximization with a relaxed linear motion assumption. To achieve this, we build upon the continuous-operation pipeline from Hagenaars et al. [ref]19, which retrieves optical flow by sequentially processing small partitions of the event stream with a stateful (i.e., recurrent) model over time, instead of dealing with large volumes of input events. We augment (and train) this pipeline with a novel contrast maximization formulation that performs event motion compensation in an iterative manner at multiple temporal scales, as shown in Fig. 1. Using this framework, we achieve the best accuracy of all contrast-maximization-based approaches on multiple datasets, only being outperformed by pure supervised learning methods trained with ground-truth data. In summary, the extensions that we propose to the SSL framework in [ref]19, i.e., our main contributions, are: The first iterative event warping module in the context of contrast maximization (see Section 3.2). This module unlocks a novel multi-reference loss function that better captures the trajectory of scene points over time, thus improving the accuracy of the predictions. The first multi-timescale approach to contrast maximization, which adds robustness, improves convergence, and reduces tuning requirements of loss-related hyperparameters (see Section 3.3). As a result, we present the first self-supervised optical flow method for event cameras that relaxes the linear motion assumption, and hence that has the potential of exploiting the high temporal resolution of the sensor by producing estimates in a close-to continuous manner. We validate the proposed framework through extensive evaluations on multiple datasets. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to show the effectiveness of each individual component.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Event cameras capture per-pixel log-brightness changes at microsecond resolution [ref]13.††The project’s code and additional material can be found at https://mavlab.tudelft.nl/taming_event_flow/.
