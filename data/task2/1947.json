      "content": "Paper Title: Semi-Supervised Learning of Visual Features by Non-Parametrically Predicting View Assignments with Support Samples\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne procedure to simultaneously learn with both labeled and unlabeled data is to combine a supervised loss on the labeled samples with an unsupervised loss on the unlabeled samples.\nFor example, [ref]12   train a model by adding an unsupervised regularization term to a supervised cross-entropy loss.\nSimilarly, UDA [ref]15 adds a supervised cross-entropy loss to an appropriately weighted unsupervised regularization term.\nLikewise, S4L  adds a supervised cross-entropy loss to a weighted mixture of self-supervised pretext loss terms.\nThis idea of an adding a supervised cross-entropy loss to an unsupervised instance-based loss has also been exploited to learn representations suitable for both image classification and instance recognition . There is also a family of semi-supervised methods related to self-training [ref]5 that explicitly generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled samples and that optimize prediction accuracy on both the ground truth labels (for the labeled samples) and the pseudo-labels (for the unlabeled samples).\nFor example Pseudo-Label  and earlier related methods    first train a model on the labeled samples, use this model to assign pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples, and then re-train the model using both the labeled and unlabeled samples.\nThe MixMatch trilogy of work    operates similarly, but generates the pseudo-labels in an online fashion.\nSpecifically, FixMatch  trains with a supervised cross-entropy loss while simultaneously making predictions on weakly augmented unlabeled images.\nWhen the unsupervised predictions are confident enough, they are used as pseudo-labels for strongly augmented views of those same unlabeled images. Another closely related line of work in self-training uses an explicit teacher-student configuration.\nFor example, Mean Teacher  and Noisy Student  use a teacher network to assign pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples, which are then used to train a student network.\nSimilarly, MPL  uses a teacher network to pseudo-label unlabeled images for a student network. The student then performs an update by minimizing its prediction error with respect to the teacher’s pseudo-label.\nSubsequently, the student is evaluated on a mini-batch of labeled samples, and the teacher network is updated using a meta-learning loss based on the student’s evaluation performance.\nIn MPL, the overall teacher update consists of the combination of the student’s meta-learning loss plus a separate UDA loss.\nAfter self-training, the MPL student model is subsequently fine-tuned on the labeled samples using a standard cross-entropy loss. There is also the Co-training framework  which bears a coarse resemblance to the self-training procedure, but posseses notable differences.\nSpecifically, Co-training learns a separate feature extractor on each (conditionally independent) view of the data, combines the predictions of the different feature extractors, and alternates between pseudo-labeling a subset of the data and training on the generated pseudo-labels.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: One procedure to simultaneously learn with both labeled and unlabeled data is to combine a supervised loss on the labeled samples with an unsupervised loss on the unlabeled samples.\nFor example, [ref]12   train a model by adding an unsupervised regularization term to a supervised cross-entropy loss.\nSimilarly, UDA [ref]15 adds a supervised cross-entropy loss to an appropriately weighted\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
