      "content": "Paper Title: Automated Kantian Ethics: A Faithful Implementation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAutomated ethics is a growing field, spurred in part by the need for ethically intelligent AI agents. Tolmeijer et al. surveyed the state of the field of machine ethics  and characterized implementations in automated ethics by (1) the choice of ethical theory, (2) implementation design decisions (e.g. logic programming), and (3) implementation details (e.g. choice of logic). Two branches of automated ethics are top-down and bottom-up ethics. Top-down automated ethics begins with an ethical theory, whereas bottom-up automated ethics learns ethical judgements from prior judgements (e.g., using machine learning to make ethical judgements as in ). Bottom-up approaches often lack an explicit ethical theory explaining their judgements, so analytically arguing for or against their conclusions is impossible. Top-down approaches, on the other hand, must be explicit about the underlying ethical theories, and are thus more explainable. In this paper, I use a top-down approach to formalize Kantian ethics. There is work automating other ethical theories, like consequentialism   or particularism  . Kantian ethics is a deontological, or rule based ethic, and there is prior work implementing other deontological theories 7  . There has been both theoretical and practical work on automating Kantian ethics 4 7. In 2006, Powers 4 argued that implementing Kantian ethics presented technical challenges, such as automation of a non-monotonic logic, and philosophical challenges, like a definition of the categorical imperative. I address the former through my use of Dyadic Deontic Logic, which allows obligations to be retracted as context changes, and the latter through my use of the practical contradiction interpretation. There has also been prior work in formalizing Kantian metaphysics using I/O logic 8. Deontic logic is inspired by Kant’s “ought implies can” principle, but does not include a robust formalization of the categorical imperative 8. Kroy 6 presents a formalization of the first two formulations of the categorical imperative, but does not implement it. I implement his formalization of the FUL to compare it to my system. Lindner and Bentzen [ref]9 presented one of the first formalizations and implementations of Kant’s second formulation of the categorical imperative. They present their goal as “not to get close to a correct interpretation of Kant, but to show that our interpretation of Kant’s ideas can contribute to the development of machine ethics.” My work builds on theirs by formalizing the first formulation of the categorical imperative as faithfully as possible. Staying faithful to philosophical literature makes my system capable of making robust and reliable judgements. The implementation of this paper was inspired by and builds on Benzmüller, Parent, and Farjami’s foundational work with the LogiKEy framework for machine ethics, which includes their implementation of DDL in Isabelle 0 2. The LogiKEy project has been used to study metaphysics 1 2, law , and ethics 5, but not Kant’s categorical imperative.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: a formalization of the first two formulations of the categorical imperative, but does not implement it.
