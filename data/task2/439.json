Besides the basic task of binary polarity classification , sentiment analysis research has been carried out in many other related topics such as multimodal sentiment analysis  [ref]14, multilingual sentiment analysis , aspect-based sentiment analysis , domain adaptation  , rumors and fake news detection  , gender-specific sentiment analysis  , and multitask learning , including also applications of sentiment analysis in domains like healthcare  , political forecasting , tourism , customer relationship management , stance classification , and dialogue systems  . Recently, some sophisticated deep learning techniques like capsule networks , deep belief networks , and hybrid AI  are applied to the research of sentiment analysis and aspect-based sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis in dialogues, in particular, has become a new trend recently. Poria et al.  proposed context-dependent LSTM networks to capture contextual information for identifying sentiment over video sequences, and Ragheb et al.  utilized self-attention to prioritize important utterances.\nMemory networks , which introduce an external memory module, was applied to modeling historical utterances in conversations. For example, CMN [ref]5 modeled dialogue histories into memory cells, ICON  proposed global memories for bridging self- and inter-speaker emotional influences, and AGHMN  proposed hierarchical memory network as utterance reader.\nGhosal et al. 8 incorporated commonsense knowledge to enhance emotion recognition.\nRecent advances in deep learning were also introduced to conversational sentiment analysis like attentive RNN [ref]2, adversarial training 9, and graph convolutional networks .\nAnother emerging direction is to incorporate Transformer-based contextual embedding.\nZhong et al. 0 leveraged commonsense knowledge from external knowledge bases to enrich transformer encoder.\nQin et al. 1 built a co-interactive relation network to model feature interaction from bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) for joint dialogue act recognition and sentiment analysis. Neural Tensor Networks (NTN) 2 first proposed for reasoning over relational data are also related to our work. Socher et al. 3 further extended NTN to capture semantic compositionality for sentiment analysis. The authors proposed a tensor-based composition function to learn sentence representation recursively, which solves the issue when words function as operators that change the meaning of another word.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: in the last decade . Besides the basic task of binary polarity classification , sentiment analysis research has been carried out in many other related topics such as multimodal sentiment analysis  [ref]14, multilingual sentiment analysis , aspect-based sentiment analysis , domain adaptation  , rumors and fake news detection  , gender-specific sentiment analysis  , and multitask learning ,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
