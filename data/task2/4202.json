      "content": "Paper Title: A deep inverse reinforcement learning approach to route choice modeling with context-dependent rewards\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo tackle traffic congestion and plan transportation infrastructure, it is important to understand, and ultimately predict, how individuals move between places through transportation networks and how various factors affect their decisions. The increasing popularity of devices equipped with location sensors offers unprecedented possibilities for studying detailed human movements and better comprehending individual routing preferences. This requires specialized analytical methods to extract human routing behavior patterns from large-scale trajectory data. Route choice modeling, as a fundamental step in transportation planning and forecasting, is the process of estimating the likely paths that individuals follow during their journeys . Empirical studies have repeatedly shown that chosen routes often deviate significantly from the shortest paths  . Therefore, route choice models are needed to appraise perceptions of route attributes, forecast routing behavior under hypothetical scenarios, predict future traffic conditions on transportation networks, and potentially guide us to design better urban infrastructure. Conventional route choice models adopt the discrete choice model (DCM) framework and can be generally categorized into two types. The most common type is path-based in the sense that the model describes a discrete choice among paths, where each path is a sequence of network links that connects an origin to a destination. Path-based models are simple but require sampling potential paths to form a finite choice set, which is a non-trivial task in a large and complex network (e.g., urban road networks). The other type is link-based where the route choice problem is formulated as a sequence of link choices. Link-based models have several advantages. First, they do not require choice set generation and tend to produce more consistent model estimates . Second, they are generally more suited to incorporate detailed link-level features (e.g., bike lanes for cyclists), which is useful for evaluating transportation network design. Third, they can be easily extended for dynamic routing situations when travelers may change route choices en route in response to updated link features (e.g., traffic congestion for drivers). Despite of these potential advantages, existing link-level models, like most DCMs, still assume simple linear utility functions and require link-additive features, making it difficult to uncover complex human routing preferences that may be nonlinear and vary by context. Therefore, we need a more flexible link-based modeling framework to incorporate context information and capture such complex routing preferences. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful alternative to classical DCMs. Because of their multilayer structure and diverse architecture design, deep neural networks (DNNs) can capture nonlinear relationships and incorporate high-dimensional features, and have shown state-of-the-art performance in many problems, especially for mode choice modeling  [ref]39. There are relatively few studies applying DNNs for route choice modeling, and all are path-based . Link-based models typically need to adopt a sequential structure to capture the behavioral patterns in a series of link choices. Although several recent works demonstrated the potential of sequential DNNs for trajectory prediction  and trajectory generation , they cannot be directly applied to route choice modeling, where reaching a specific destination is necessary. As route choice models are commonly used to understand human routing preferences and make travel predictions for planning purposes, they require good interpretability and generalizability, which are often lacking in deep learning methods. This study aims to fill these research gaps. In this study, we propose a deep inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework for link-based route choice modeling. IRL is well suited because it is structurally similar to dynamic DCMs [ref]33, behaviorally interpretable, and flexible enough to incorporate deep architectures and high-dimensional features. In this framework, the link-based route choice problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and the goal is to recover the underlying reward function (similar to utility functions) from observed human trajectories. Both the reward and policy functions are context-dependent and can be approximated using DNNs. Specifically, the adversarial IRL, or AIRL , is adapted to the route choice problem to learn these functions from observed trajectories in a model-free fashion, without the need for value iteration. Several alternatives of the proposed model are also tested, including a simpler behavioral cloning (BC) method and Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) . Extensive experiments are conducted using taxi GPS data on a selected road network from Shanghai, China, and the results validate the improved prediction performance of the proposed model over classical DCMs as well as other DNN baselines. The improvement holds for limited training data and unseen destinations, demonstrating the generalizability of the model. The specific contributions of this study include (1) a general deep IRL framework for route choice modeling with context-dependent reward and policy functions, (2) a specific context-dependent AIRL architecture to learn routing preferences from observed trajectories without value iteration, and (3) empirical findings for comparison across a diverse range of route choice models (path-based vs link based, linear vs nonlinear, model-based vs model-free, IRL vs imitation learning, etc.) regarding their prediction performance, computational efficiency and interpretability. While this study focuses on the driver route choice on a road network, the proposed methodology is general and should be adaptable to other route choice problems across different modes and networks. To support open science and future development of related methods, both the code and relevant data are made available online333The code and relevant data are available at https://github.com/liangchunyaobing/RCM-AIRL. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature on route choice models, inverse reinforcement learning, and interpretable deep learning. Section 3 presents how we formulate the route choice problem as an inverse reinforcement learning problem and how deep learning can help us solve the problem. We then introduce a specific model architecture adapted from AIRL for route choice modeling in Section 4. The model evaluation setup and results are described in Sections 5 and 6, respectively. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper by discussing the main findings, limitations, and future research directions.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: networks (DNNs) can capture nonlinear relationships and incorporate high-dimensional features, and have shown state-of-the-art performance in many problems, especially for mode choice modeling  [ref]39.
