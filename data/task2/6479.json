      "content": "Paper Title: Tensorformer: Normalized Matrix Attention Transformer for High-quality Point Cloud Reconstruction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSurface reconstruction from point clouds is important yet challenging in many computer vision and graphics applications, such as geometry modeling and AR rendering. Before deep learning methods arose, traditional methods such as Poisson Surface Reconstruction (PSR) have been proposed to address this challenge. The PSR can generate a smooth surface with per-point normal by solving a Poisson equation of indicator function. However, per-point normal is always difficult to acquire in real applications like autonomous driving. Meanwhile, the absence of machine learning modules makes these traditional methods lack the ability to recover local details while the input points are sparse or noisy. With rapid development of deep learning, some works try to utilize the strong prediction ability of the neural network to improve the reconstruction quality. Most CNN-based works[ref]4  [ref]2  define the surface reconstruction as a classification or regression problem. Specifically, the neural network should predict the SDF or occupancy value of all points in the whole space or a bounding box according to the point cloud. DeepSDF[ref]4 extracts the global feature via PointNet of the whole point cloud and combines feature and query point to predict the occupancy. Convolutional Occupancy Networks[ref]2 casts the per-point feature extracted via PointNet++ to fixed grid point and uses 3D convolution to enhance the feature. All the above methods employ convolution and its variation to enhance the extracted features. The good per-point feature is critical for reconstructing high-quality surfaces. Inspired by the recent success of transformers on natural language processing [ref]8 and image understanding , a lot of works have attempted to extend transformer to point cloud feature encoding 0 1 which has achieved good performance for segmentation and classification. The transformer is particularly suited for point cloud processing since self-attention, which is the center of a transformer, is essentially a set operator 1. However, current Scaled Dot-product Attention[ref]8 and Vector Attention2 only aggregate the feature of the same channel, neglecting the importance of feature aggregation between different channels, which is not enough for local detailed geometry recovery from a sparse point cloud. We propose Matrix Attention, a novel self-attention module for encoding the geometry of 3D point clouds. In matrix attention, features of different neighboring points and different channels of each point are simultaneously weighted and fused, leading to more degrees of freedom. Such joint point-wise and channel-wise attention help better capture the local geometry, in analogy to the joint set and coordinate embedding of discrete differential operators on 2-manifold in 3D space 3. Fig. 2 depicts the difference between Vector Attention + FC and Matrix Attention. Our experiment in table VII demonstrates the superiority of Matrix Attention among other attention designs in the reconstruction task. Existing self-attention modules usually employ a softmax normalization for outputting the final attention weights. Softmax yields a high variance of attention weights, which adversely affects local geometry encoding. We will provide a theoretic analysis of the method in Sec. III. To further release the power of our attention design, we found that a simplistic weight normalization results in a powerful transformer for geometry learning. With the designs above, we name our new point transformer, which is short for Tensorformer. Fig. 1 demonstrates that the proposed method performs better for local geometry details preserving and generating more clear surfaces than other state-of-the-art alternatives. In summary, the contributions of this paper include the following: We propose matrix attention which can simultaneously integrate features from different channels and neighbors, significantly improving the point feature expression ability for reconstruction. We propose linear normalization, which can prevent the gradient vanish and back-propagate the gradient to almost all the input elements rather than the most significant ones. We establish a network with Tensorformer and achieve SOTA on ShapeNetCore and ABC(001) on point cloud reconstruction. Our method performs an average improvement of 5% on IoU from the 131313 categories of the ShapeNetCore dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: are sparse or noisy.
