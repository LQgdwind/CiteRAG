      "content": "Paper Title: Integer Traffic Assignment Problem: Algorithms and Insights on Random Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe conditional probability distribution (19) can be represented by a factor graph, where variable nodes are the at the edges and factor nodes at the nodes of the original network. Let (i​j)𝑖𝑗(ij) be an (undirected) edge on the graph G𝐺G. We place two variables on this edge σi→jν=𝕀​[i→j∈πν]superscriptsubscript𝜎→𝑖𝑗𝜈𝕀delimited-[]→𝑖𝑗superscript𝜋𝜈\\sigma_{i\\to j}^{\\nu}=\\mathbb{I}[i\\to j\\in\\pi^{\\nu}] and σj→iν=𝕀​[j→i∈πν]superscriptsubscript𝜎→𝑗𝑖𝜈𝕀delimited-[]→𝑗𝑖superscript𝜋𝜈\\sigma_{j\\to i}^{\\nu}=\\mathbb{I}[j\\to i\\in\\pi^{\\nu}].\nThe probability distribution (II.2)can be decomposed into factors as P​({σi→jν}(i​j)∈E|{Hi​jν}(i​j)∈E,sν,tν)∝fsν​ftν​∏i∈[N]\\sν,tνfiproportional-to𝑃conditionalsubscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝜎𝜈→𝑖𝑗𝑖𝑗𝐸subscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝐻𝜈𝑖𝑗𝑖𝑗𝐸superscript𝑠𝜈superscript𝑡𝜈subscript𝑓superscript𝑠𝜈subscript𝑓superscript𝑡𝜈subscriptproduct𝑖\\delimited-[]𝑁superscript𝑠𝜈superscript𝑡𝜈subscript𝑓𝑖P\\left(\\{\\sigma^{\\nu}_{i\\to j}\\}_{(ij)\\in E}|\\{H^{\\nu}_{ij}\\}_{(ij)\\in E},s^{\\nu},t^{\\nu}\\right)\\propto f_{s^{\\nu}}f_{t^{\\nu}}\\prod_{i\\in[N]\\backslash s^{\\nu},t^{\\nu}}f_{i}.\nLet us look at these factors: fi=𝕀[∑k,l∈∂ik≠lσk→iν+σi→lν=(0 OR 2)]exp(−β∑k∈∂iHi​kνσi→kν)]f_{i}=\\mathbb{I}[\\sum_{\\begin{subarray}{c}k,l\\in\\partial i\\\\\nk\\neq l\\end{subarray}}\\sigma^{\\nu}_{k\\to i}+\\sigma^{\\nu}_{i\\to l}=(0\\text{ OR }2)]\\exp{(-\\beta\\sum_{k\\in\\partial i}H^{\\nu}_{ik}\\sigma^{\\nu}_{i\\rightarrow k})}].\nThis constraint ensures that πνsuperscript𝜋𝜈\\pi^{\\nu} passes through node i𝑖i no more than once. It also ensures that the {σi→j}subscript𝜎→𝑖𝑗\\{\\sigma_{i\\to j}\\} form a valid path and it contains the weighting factor e−β​Hi​kνsuperscript𝑒𝛽subscriptsuperscript𝐻𝜈𝑖𝑘e^{-\\beta H^{\\nu}_{ik}} that represents the cost of passing through edge i,k𝑖𝑘i,k, independently of direction. This constraint is placed at every node in the graph except for sν,tνsuperscript𝑠𝜈superscript𝑡𝜈s^{\\nu},t^{\\nu} ftν=𝕀​[∑k∈∂tνσk→tνν=1]​𝕀​[∑k∈∂tνσtν→kν=0]subscript𝑓superscript𝑡𝜈𝕀delimited-[]subscript𝑘superscript𝑡𝜈subscriptsuperscript𝜎𝜈→𝑘superscript𝑡𝜈1𝕀delimited-[]subscript𝑘superscript𝑡𝜈subscriptsuperscript𝜎𝜈→superscript𝑡𝜈𝑘0f_{t^{\\nu}}=\\mathbb{I}\\left[\\sum_{k\\in\\partial t^{\\nu}}\\sigma^{\\nu}_{k\\to t^{\\nu}}=1\\right]\\mathbb{I}\\left[\\sum_{k\\in\\partial t^{\\nu}}\\sigma^{\\nu}_{t^{\\nu}\\to k}=0\\right] imposes that the path ends at tνsuperscript𝑡𝜈t^{\\nu}. fsν=𝕀​[∑k∈∂sνσsν→kν=1]​𝕀​[∑k∈∂sνσk→sνν=0]​∏k∈∂sν(exp⁡(−β​Hsν​kν​σsν→kν))subscript𝑓superscript𝑠𝜈𝕀delimited-[]subscript𝑘superscript𝑠𝜈subscriptsuperscript𝜎𝜈→superscript𝑠𝜈𝑘1𝕀delimited-[]subscript𝑘superscript𝑠𝜈subscriptsuperscript𝜎𝜈→𝑘superscript𝑠𝜈0subscriptproduct𝑘superscript𝑠𝜈𝛽subscriptsuperscript𝐻𝜈superscript𝑠𝜈𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝜎𝜈→superscript𝑠𝜈𝑘f_{s^{\\nu}}=\\mathbb{I}\\left[\\sum_{k\\in\\partial s^{\\nu}}\\sigma^{\\nu}_{s^{\\nu}\\to k}=1\\right]\\mathbb{I}\\left[\\sum_{k\\in\\partial s^{\\nu}}\\sigma^{\\nu}_{k\\to s^{\\nu}}=0\\right]\\prod_{k\\in\\partial s^{\\nu}}(\\exp{(-\\beta H^{\\nu}_{s^{\\nu}k}\\sigma^{\\nu}_{s^{\\nu}\\rightarrow k})}) imposes that the path starts at sνsuperscript𝑠𝜈s^{\\nu}. Having defined the quantity fisubscript𝑓𝑖f_{i}, one can draw the factor graph as shown in Figure 9. From the construction of the graph, one can deduce that if the original network is tree like, the factor graph will remain tree like given our choice of variables. Given this property, BP equations are expected to converge to a good solution if the graph does not have too many loops. We can now derive the BP equations for this factor graph; this gives two sets of messages. Since each variable node has exactly two neighbouring factor nodes, simplifications of the BP equations leads to the iteration of only one set of messages. We denote by χi→jνsubscriptsuperscript𝜒𝜈→𝑖𝑗\\chi^{\\nu}_{i\\rightarrow j} the message going from node i𝑖i to node j𝑗j. The message χi→jν​(σi→jν,σj→iν)subscriptsuperscript𝜒𝜈→𝑖𝑗subscriptsuperscript𝜎𝜈→𝑖𝑗subscriptsuperscript𝜎𝜈→𝑗𝑖\\chi^{\\nu}_{i\\rightarrow j}(\\sigma^{\\nu}_{i\\to j},\\sigma^{\\nu}_{j\\to i}) depends on the value of the variable, that can take four different values. First notice that νi→j​(1,1)=0subscript𝜈→𝑖𝑗110\\nu_{i\\to j}(1,1)=0, since the path cannot backtrack on one edge. For the other three values (σi→jν,σj→iν)∈\\sigma^{\\nu}_{i\\to j},\\sigma^{\\nu}_{j\\to i})\\in {(0,0),(1,0),(0,1)} (for a node i≠sν,eν𝑖superscript𝑠𝜈superscript𝑒𝜈i\\neq s^{\\nu},e^{\\nu}), update equations are derived: Equations B are intuitive. For example, to derive the expression of χi→jν​(0,0)subscriptsuperscript𝜒𝜈→𝑖𝑗00\\chi^{\\nu}_{i\\to j}(0,0), two cases need to be considered: the case where none of the neighboring edges to i𝑖i is occupied, and the case where a path passes through node i𝑖i, but without passing through node j𝑗j (and therefore passes through k→i→l→𝑘𝑖→𝑙k\\to i\\to l with k,l≠j𝑘𝑙𝑗k,l\\neq j). Same reasoning can be applied for the two other messages. Special equations apply for the source node sνsuperscript𝑠𝜈s^{\\nu}: and for the end node eνsuperscript𝑒𝜈e^{\\nu} : To get rid of the normalization factor 1/Zi→j1subscript𝑍→𝑖𝑗1/Z_{i\\rightarrow j} present in the messages, the following change of variables can be applied: Using equations B, one finds a closed form for the normalized messages zi→jνsubscriptsuperscript𝑧𝜈→𝑖𝑗z^{\\nu}_{i\\rightarrow j} and z~i→jνsubscriptsuperscript~𝑧𝜈→𝑖𝑗\\tilde{z}^{\\nu}_{i\\rightarrow j} : Equations 29 and 30 are fixed point equations for the messages zi→jνsubscriptsuperscript𝑧𝜈→𝑖𝑗z^{\\nu}_{i\\to j} and z~i→jνsubscriptsuperscript~𝑧𝜈→𝑖𝑗\\tilde{z}^{\\nu}_{i\\to j} at finite β𝛽\\beta. In order to take the β→∞→𝛽\\beta\\rightarrow\\infty limit, it is useful to define the quantities ai→jν=−log⁡(zi→jν)/βsubscriptsuperscript𝑎𝜈→𝑖𝑗subscriptsuperscript𝑧𝜈→𝑖𝑗𝛽a^{\\nu}_{i\\to j}=-\\log(z^{\\nu}_{i\\to j})/\\beta and bi→jν=−log⁡(z~i→jν)/βsubscriptsuperscript𝑏𝜈→𝑖𝑗subscriptsuperscript~𝑧𝜈→𝑖𝑗𝛽b^{\\nu}_{i\\to j}=-\\log(\\tilde{z}^{\\nu}_{i\\to j})/\\beta. After taking the zero temperature limit (β→∞→𝛽\\beta\\to\\infty), the belief propagation equations thus provide update equations for the messages ai→jνsubscriptsuperscript𝑎𝜈→𝑖𝑗a^{\\nu}_{i\\rightarrow j} 13 and bi→jνsubscriptsuperscript𝑏𝜈→𝑖𝑗b^{\\nu}_{i\\rightarrow j} 18. The zero temperature belief propagation equations presented allow, if iterated until convergence, to find the path ν𝜈\\nu minimizing the energy once all other paths μ∈[M]\\ν𝜇\\delimited-[]𝑀𝜈\\mu\\in[M]\\backslash\\nu are fixed. Indeed, it samples from the conditional probability distribution II.2 that concentrates around the configurations of lowest energy when β𝛽\\beta goes to ∞\\infty. As already mentioned in section II.2, following this procedure results in one step of the greedy procedure. In other words, BP is used as an algorithm to find the shortest path.\nHowever, the procedure described in [ref]54 consists in only making one iteration of the update equations 13 and 18 before updating the cost on edges. The cost Hi​jνsuperscriptsubscript𝐻𝑖𝑗𝜈H_{ij}^{\\nu} at the edge (i​j)𝑖𝑗(ij) being defined as Hi​jν=ϕ​(Ii​j\\ν+1)−ϕ​(Ii​j\\ν)superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑖𝑗𝜈italic-ϕsubscriptsuperscript𝐼\\absent𝜈𝑖𝑗1italic-ϕsubscriptsuperscript𝐼\\absent𝜈𝑖𝑗H_{ij}^{\\nu}=\\phi(I^{\\backslash\\nu}_{ij}+1)-\\phi(I^{\\backslash\\nu}_{ij}), it is necessary to compute the expected total traffic of the other paths Ii​j\\νsubscriptsuperscript𝐼\\absent𝜈𝑖𝑗I^{\\backslash\\nu}_{ij} between i𝑖i and j𝑗j. We can write the expected traffic as Ii​j\\ν=∑μ∈[M]\\νP​(σ(i​j)μ=1)subscriptsuperscript𝐼\\absent𝜈𝑖𝑗subscript𝜇\\delimited-[]𝑀𝜈𝑃subscriptsuperscript𝜎𝜇𝑖𝑗1I^{\\backslash\\nu}_{ij}=\\sum_{\\mu\\in[M]\\backslash\\nu}P(\\sigma^{\\mu}_{(ij)}=1) where σ(i​j)μ=𝕀⁡[i→j∈πν​ OR ​j→i∈πν]subscriptsuperscript𝜎𝜇𝑖𝑗𝕀→𝑖𝑗superscript𝜋𝜈 OR 𝑗→𝑖superscript𝜋𝜈\\sigma^{\\mu}_{(ij)}=\\operatorname{\\mathbb{I}}[i\\to j\\in\\pi^{\\nu}\\text{ OR }j\\to i\\in\\pi^{\\nu}]. The expected contribution of path μ𝜇\\mu to the traffic at edge (i​j)𝑖𝑗(ij) is equal to the probability P​(σ(i​j)μ=1)𝑃subscriptsuperscript𝜎𝜇𝑖𝑗1P(\\sigma^{\\mu}_{(ij)}=1). Naturally, we have that P​(σ(i​j)μ=1)=P​(σi→jμ=1)+P​(σj→iμ=1)𝑃subscriptsuperscript𝜎𝜇𝑖𝑗1𝑃subscriptsuperscript𝜎𝜇→𝑖𝑗1𝑃subscriptsuperscript𝜎𝜇→𝑗𝑖1P(\\sigma^{\\mu}_{(ij)}=1)=P(\\sigma^{\\mu}_{i\\rightarrow j}=1)+P(\\sigma^{\\mu}_{j\\rightarrow i}=1), where P​(σi→jμ=1)𝑃subscriptsuperscript𝜎𝜇→𝑖𝑗1P(\\sigma^{\\mu}_{i\\rightarrow j}=1) can be expressed using the messages ai→jμsubscriptsuperscript𝑎𝜇→𝑖𝑗a^{\\mu}_{i\\rightarrow j} and bi→jμsubscriptsuperscript𝑏𝜇→𝑖𝑗b^{\\mu}_{i\\rightarrow j}. In order to derive the expression, one can start by deducing the marginal from the finite temperature messages χi→jμsubscriptsuperscript𝜒𝜇→𝑖𝑗\\chi^{\\mu}_{i\\rightarrow j}, then operate the same change of variables 28 as follows : Taking the limit β→∞→𝛽\\beta\\rightarrow\\infty, the probability P​(σi→jμ=1)𝑃subscriptsuperscript𝜎𝜇→𝑖𝑗1P(\\sigma^{\\mu}_{i\\rightarrow j}=1) concentrates at one value (either 0 or 1) depending on the values of the messages. Explicitly, the value of σi→jμsubscriptsuperscript𝜎𝜇→𝑖𝑗\\sigma^{\\mu}_{i\\rightarrow j} (including the case i=sμ𝑖superscript𝑠𝜇i=s^{\\mu} and i=tμ𝑖superscript𝑡𝜇i=t^{\\mu}) will follow the expression: The results derived in this appendix can be compared to the ones exposed in the supplementary material of [ref]54 and to the pseudocode of the CBP algorithm (also taken from [ref]54). The update equations for ai→jνsubscriptsuperscript𝑎𝜈→𝑖𝑗a^{\\nu}_{i\\rightarrow j} (13) and bi→jνsubscriptsuperscript𝑏𝜈→𝑖𝑗b^{\\nu}_{i\\rightarrow j} (18) can be compared to equations (35),(36) which are the ones originally derived in [ref]54.\nThe two sets of equations, are almost identical, we shall now focus on the differences. The main difference is the presence of Hi​jνsuperscriptsubscript𝐻𝑖𝑗𝜈H_{ij}^{\\nu} in place of ϕ′​(ηj​iν⁣∗)superscriptitalic-ϕ′superscriptsubscript𝜂𝑗𝑖𝜈\\phi^{\\prime}(\\eta_{ji}^{\\nu*}).\nThis is due to the fact that the authors use an approximated form of the energy obtained by Taylor expanding Hi​jνsuperscriptsubscript𝐻𝑖𝑗𝜈H_{ij}^{\\nu}.\nThis approximation is only valid if Ii→j\\ν≫1much-greater-thansuperscriptsubscript𝐼→𝑖𝑗\\absent𝜈1I_{i\\rightarrow j}^{\\backslash\\nu}\\gg 1 which is not the case in the regime ρ=O​(1)𝜌𝑂1\\rho=O(1), which is the one considered in [ref]54. Another difference lies in the update equation of message bi→jνsubscriptsuperscript𝑏𝜈→𝑖𝑗b^{\\nu}_{i\\rightarrow j} in the case i=eν𝑖superscript𝑒𝜈i=e^{\\nu}. Indeed, the term −mink∈∂eν\\j⁡[ak→eνν]subscript𝑘\\superscript𝑒𝜈𝑗subscriptsuperscript𝑎𝜈→𝑘superscript𝑒𝜈-\\min_{k\\in\\partial e^{\\nu}\\backslash j}[a^{\\nu}_{k\\rightarrow e^{\\nu}}] is present in equation (18) and is missing from equation (36).\nAdditionally, some algebraic computations reveal that equation (19) exactly corresponds to equation (B.1), originally derived in [ref]54. Despite the presence of these differences, in our experiments we use the code from [ref]54. We further tried using the exact formula for Hi​jνsuperscriptsubscript𝐻𝑖𝑗𝜈H_{ij}^{\\nu} in place of the Taylor expansion and this did not improve the energy reached by CBP.\n\nReference markers found: [54]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]54: in section II.2, following this procedure results in one step of the greedy procedure.
