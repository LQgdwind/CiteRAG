      "content": "Paper Title: Weighting and Pruning based Ensemble Deep Random Vector Functional Link Network for Tabular Data Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning has been extremely successful in recent years. Ranging from vision and video tasks to natural language processing, these deep neural networks have reached state-of-the-art results in multiple domains  . In conventional neural networks, back-propagation methods are used to train a large number of parameters in these models . Although such a training method makes it possible to optimize the parameters, the time-consuming training process has become a severe problem in recently designed complex neural networks. Also, a BP-trained neural network may fall into a local minimum and gives a sub-optimal result   . By looking at the Kaggle competitions that have no relation with vision or sequence, we can easily find that deep learning is not always the best solution for diverse tasks [ref]7 . At the same time, another kind of neural network based on randomization is attracting significant attention because of its superiority to overcome the shortcomings of the conventional models   0. It has been successfully applied to a range of tasks from classiﬁcation 1 2 3, regression 4 5, visual tracking 6, to forecasting 7 8. Instead of using back-propagation to train, this randomization-based neural network frequently uses a closed-form solution to optimize parameters in the model 9. Unlike the BP-trained neural networks which need multiple iterations, the randomization-based neural networks only need to be trained once by feeding all the samples to the model together. Among these models, Random Vector Functional Link Network (RVFL) 0 is a typical representative with a single hidden layer. Its universal approximation ability has been proved in 1. The weights and biases are randomly generated in this neural network. And its uniqueness lies in a direct link that connects the information from the input layer to the output layer. However, due to different random seeds and perturbations in the training set, this randomized neural network can perform quite differently in each realization 2. To increase the performance, stability, and robustness of this model, two improved structures named Deep Random Vector Functional Link Network (dRVFL) and Ensemble Deep Random Vector Functional Link Network (edRVFL) were proposed 3. The dRVFL network is a deep version of RVFL network, which allows the existence of multiple hidden layers, while edRVFL network treats each hidden layer as a classifier to compose an ensemble. However, with the edRVFL network goes deeper, the divergence of the randomized hidden features will become a serious problem. Therefore, using normalization methods to re-normalize the hidden features is extremely important for improving the performance of the edRVFL network. In this paper, we employ the batch normalization scheme 4 to do the re-normalization work. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that batch normalization is introduced to the randomized neural network. After the re-normalization process, the mean and the variance of the hidden features will become 0 and 1. Then, we scale and shift these values to increase the expression capacity of the neural network. Besides, there are still some drawbacks to the edRVFL network. Firstly, for every layer (or classifier) in the edRVFL network, they share the same training samples. Meanwhile, these training samples have the same weights in the training process. Compared to ensemble methods that using differing training bags for each classifier, these ensemble frameworks which utilize similar training sets usually perform worse  5 6. Moreover, the testing accuracy for the last few layers may slightly go down when the network becomes deeper. We believe that some inferior features can be generated since we randomly generate the weights for the hidden neurons. And these useless features will propagate to deeper layers inducing further inferior features to decrease the overall testing accuracy. Thus, for solving the first problem, we introduce a weighting matrix. Each training sample will be allocated a particular weight when performing the closed-form solution depending on its performance in the previous layer. Our approach differs from Weighted Extreme Learning Machine 7 which gives weights to each sample for addressing the problem of imbalance learning. The main purpose is to ensure that different classifiers can have their preference for a particular portion of the training samples that were not classified with high confidence in the previous layer. We have also tried to apply the sample weighting method of Adaboost 8. However, most of the samples will be given weights near zero while only a few can be allocated reasonable weights. Therefore, we propose four different weighting methods in this paper, and this improved variant of edRVFL network is named Weighted Ensemble Deep Random Vector Functional Link Network (WedRVFL). Besides, pruning algorithms are widely used to reduce the heavy computational cost of deep neural networks in low-resource settings 9. Different effective techniques have been proposed to cut off the redundant part of the neural network models 0 1 2 3. In our case, we perform it by selecting some inferior features in the hidden layer and prune them permanently. The selection process can help to prevent the propagation of inferior features and maintain the testing accuracy for deeper layers. We named this improved variant of edRVFL network as Pruning-based Ensemble Deep Random Vector Functional Link Network (PedRVFL). Although there was previous work that applying pruning strategy to the RVFL network in 4, we would like to highlight that our work is different from theirs at the following point: They do pruning after training to shrink the size of the neural network. However, we perform pruning during the generation step so that inferior features will not propagate to deeper layers. Additionally, we integrate the advantages of WedRVFL and PedRVFL to create a combined model called Weighting and Pruning based Ensemble Deep Random Vector Functional Link Network (WPedRVFL). The key contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: We introduce the batch normalization to the edRVFL network for re-normalizing the hidden features. We employ the weighting scheme to allocate different weights to different samples in the edRVFL network. We name it WedRVFL network. The weight matrix changes according to the samples’ predictions in the previous layers. This method can make sure that each hidden layer in the network has different biases for each sample and increase the ensemble classification accuracy. We propose pruning based edRVFL network called PedRVFL network. Instead of pruning neurons after the training process, we cut off the inferior neurons according to their importance for classification when we are training the model. This method can prevent the propagation of detrimental features and increase the classification accuracy in deeper layers. The combination of weighting and pruning based edRVFL network named WPedRVFL network is also presented in the paper. The empirical results show the superiority of our new methods over 11 state-of-the-art methods on 24 UCI benchmark datasets. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the basic concepts of RVFL network and illustrates the ensemble deep version of this structure. Section 3 introduces the re-normalization method for the edRVFL network. Then Section 4 gives details about our new proposed versions of edRVFL network. In Section 5, the performance of our methods, as well as other deep feedforward neural networks (FNNs) and RVFL variants are compared. Finally, conclusions and future research directions are presented in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: a sub-optimal result   .
