      "content": "Paper Title: On Approximating the Dynamic Response of Synchronous Generators via Operator Learning: A Step Towards Building Deep Operator-based Power Grid Simulators\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPower grid time-domain simulation. Most commercial power grid simulators implement a partitioned-solution approach 8 or an implicit integration scheme. On the one hand, the partition approach sequentially solves DAEs describing the power grid dynamics. In particular, this approach freezes the dynamic (resp. algebraic) variables to solve for the algebraic (resp. dynamic) variables. Such a strategy enables independently simulating power grid dynamic components. However, it also introduces a delay error propagating throughout the power grid simulation . On the other hand, implicit integration schemes simultaneously solve the differential and algebraic equations describing the power grid dynamics. Such a scheme eliminates delay error propagation. However, it requires simultaneously solving all the power grid components using expensive iterative methods (e.g., Newton’s method), which may require matrix inversion 8. Parallel computing-based solutions. Building on the continuous advance of high-performance parallel computing, many works  [ref]45       4 have proposed and developed parallel computing-based solutions to accelerate the simulation of complex power grids. For example, in , the authors employed high-performance computing to achieve faster simulation. Furthermore, the authors of  [ref]45  designed parallel algorithms for power grid dynamic simulation by spatially decomposing the simulation task. Similarly, one can also parallelize across (i) the time-domain  4 or (ii) across numerical solvers   . In particular, the parareal in time algorithm was employed in  4 to provide faster simulations of large-scale power grids. Parallel computing-based solutions, however, still consume a high amount of computational resources and the speedup is limited by the part of serial applications, which could prevent their application for tasks requiring multiple forward simulations, e.g., control, uncertainty quantification, and optimization. Deep learning-based solutions. Deep learning-based computational tools promise to transform how we predict and simulate complex dynamical systems. Thus, a recent wave of publications has provided encouraging results in the form of faster alternatives to traditional numerical schemes. These publications can be roughly classified into deep learning-based methods aiming at (i) learning the governing equations of the system   , (ii) encoding the underlying physics into training protocols 9 0 , or (iii) predicting the future states of the system 7 6 8. For instance, Brunton et al.   used data to learn the unknown governing equations of a dynamic system. The authors then extended this work to learn a control dynamical system’s input/state governing equation . Similarly, the authors of  used data to learn a sparse approximation of partial differential equations. For power grids, in , the authors employed the physics-informed neural network framework introduced in 9  to encode a simplified version of the power grid’s dynamics into the training loss function. In our previous work 0, we designed a discrete physics-informed neural network that incorporates into training protocols stiff and differential-algebraic equations, which often describe the power grid dynamics. On the other hand, many works 7 6 8 have proposed learning the system’s next-step response and recursively using this response to predict the system’s evolution for longer time horizons. One can implement such a next-step strategy using, for example, recurrent, residual networks (resNet) 7 or feed-forward neural networks 8. However, most of the above deep learning-based methods avoid overfitting using vast amounts of data. Moreover, they likely require retraining when dealing with unseen operating conditions. As a result, the effective design of deep learning-based solutions for predicting and simulating large-scale complex dynamical systems is still a widely-open research question. Component-based learning. To enable effective learning strategies for large-scale dynamical systems, one can follow a distributed (or component-based) design approach that requires learning the input/output response of individual components. Then, by synchronizing the trained components, one can predict and simulate large-scale dynamical systems. In , we introduced this component-based learning strategy for the power systems community. Here, we used recurrent neural networks to approximate the input/output response of a synchronous generator (SG) interacting with the rest of the grid. The proposed strategy, however, (i) required a vast amount of data to control error propagation and (ii) needed a uniform simulation step size. In a parallel effort, the authors of  proposed using continuous-time echo state networks for building a faster surrogate neural architecture. Such an architecture can (i) approximate the input/output response of a library of components and (ii) discretely interact with causal models through functional mockup interfaces . The proposed architecture, however, ignores the problem’s infinite-dimensional nature, lacks the mathematical foundation of the original echo state networks , and needs rolling a numerical integration scheme to obtain the current prediction. To tackle the above drawbacks, in this paper, we propose using the mathematically-sound infinite-dimensional framework of operator learning, which we introduced to the power systems community in 2. Operator learning. In the seminal paper 7, Lu et al. designed based on the universal approximation theorem for nonlinear operators  a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) framework, which can learn nonlinear operators (i.e., mappings between infinite-dimensional spaces). Compared to traditional neural networks, the proposed DeepONet learns with streams of scattered data and exhibits minor generalization errors, as demonstrated in applications such as control systems 4, power systems 2, or multi-physics problems . Extensions to the original DeepONet framework have enabled dealing with stiff dynamics  and discontinuities 3, incorporating physics-informed training , and quantifying uncertainty 2 6 0. Thus, in this paper, we adopt an operator learning framework to design an efficient and effective deep operator network, which learns the solution operator of power grid dynamic components (e.g., SGs) interacting with the rest of a power grid (e.g., represented via a numerical simulator).\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: methods (e.g., Newton’s method), which may require matrix inversion 8.
