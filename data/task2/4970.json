      "content": "Paper Title: Layer-wise shared attention network on dynamical system perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe design of the attention module usually requires the value of the attention map, regarded as importance, in the range    , and also requires a small parameter increment . For the standard LSTM cell, i.e., Figure 5 (Left), on the one hand, the range of the activation function tanh is [−1,1]11[-1,1] instead of   , which is verified that the range of value of the attention map is critical to the performance of the model ; On the other hand, there are several linear transformation in standard LSTM cell and each of them have up to N2superscript𝑁2N^{2} learnable parameters, which can cause serious computational cost. Therefore, we conduct some modifications in the LSTM module used in DIA-LSTM.\nAs shown in Figure 5, compared to the standard LSTM [ref]41 cell, there are three modifications in our purposed LSTM: 1) a shared linear transformation to reduce the input dimension of LSTM; 2) a carefully selected activation function for better performance; 3) The light-weight transformation is used to replace some Linear transformation. (1) Parameter Reduction. A standard LSTM consists of four linear transformation layers as shown in Figure 5 (Left). Since ytsubscript𝑦𝑡y_{t}, ht−1subscriptℎ𝑡1h_{t-1} and htsubscriptℎ𝑡h_{t} are of the same dimension N𝑁N, the standard LSTM may cause 8​N28superscript𝑁28N^{2} parameter increment (The details are shown in Section 7.2). When the number of channels is large, e.g., N=210𝑁superscript210N=2^{10}, the parameter increment of the added-in LSTM module in the DIA unit will be over 8 million, which can hardly be tolerated. As shown in Figure 5 (Left), ht−1subscriptℎ𝑡1h_{t-1} and ytsubscript𝑦𝑡y_{t} are passed to four linear transformation layers with the same input and output dimension N𝑁N. In the modified LSTM cell, a linear transformation layer with a smaller output dimension is applied to ht−1subscriptℎ𝑡1h_{t-1} and ytsubscript𝑦𝑡y_{t}, where we use reduction ratio r𝑟r in these transformations.\nSpecifically, we reduce the dimension of the input from 1×1×N11𝑁1\\times 1\\times N to 1×1×N/r11𝑁𝑟1\\times 1\\times N/r and then apply the ReLU activation function to increase non-linearity in this module. The dimension of the output from the ReLU function is changed back to 1×1×N11𝑁1\\times 1\\times N when the output is passed to those four linear transformation functions.\nThis modification can enhance the relationship between the inputs for different parts in DIA-LSTM and also effectively reduce the number of parameters by sharing a linear transformation for dimension reduction. The number of parameter increments reduces from 8​N28superscript𝑁28N^{2} to 10​N2/r10superscript𝑁2𝑟10N^{2}/r, and we find that when we choose an appropriate reduction ratio r𝑟r, we can make a better trade-off between parameter reduction and the performance of DIA-LSTM. Moreover, in Figure 5 (Right), we can replace part of linear transformations with “IE” in Eq.(5), which can further reduce the number of parameters of DIA-LSTM but such an alternative may cause some performance loss. For input x∈Rn𝑥superscript𝑅𝑛x\\in R^{n}, “IE” can be written as where 𝐖IE∈Rnsubscript𝐖IEsuperscript𝑅𝑛\\mathbf{W}_{\\text{IE}}\\in R^{n} and 𝐛IE∈Rnsubscript𝐛IEsuperscript𝑅𝑛\\mathbf{b}_{\\text{IE}}\\in R^{n} are learnable parameters.Further experimental results will be discussed in the ablation study. (2) Activation Function. Sigmoid function (σ​(z)=1/(1+e−z)𝜎𝑧11superscript𝑒𝑧\\sigma(z)=1/(1+e^{-z})) is used in many popular attention-based methods like SENet [ref]9, CBAM 0 to generate attention maps as a gate mechanism. As shown in Figure 5, we change the activation function of the output layer from Tanh to Sigmoid. Further discussion will be presented in the ablation study.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: learnable parameters, which can cause serious computational cost.
