      "content": "Paper Title: Align before Fuse: Vision and Language Representation Learning with Momentum Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe adapt the pre-trained model to five downstream V+L tasks.\nWe introduce each task and our fine-tuning strategy below.\nDetails of the datasets and fine-tuning hyperparameters are in Appendix. Image-Text Retrieval contains two subtasks:\nimage-to-text retrieval (TR) and text-to-image retrieval (IR).\nWe evaluate ALBEF on the Flickr30K¬† and COCO benchmarks,\nand fine-tune the pre-trained model using the training samples from each dataset.\nFor zero-shot retrieval on Flickr30K, we evaluate with the model fine-tuned on COCO.\nDuring fine-tuning, we jointly optimize the ITC loss (Equation¬†2) and the ITM loss (Equation¬†4).\nITC learns an image-text scoring function based on similarity of unimodal features,\nwhereas ITM models the fine-grained interaction between image and text to predict a matching score.\nSince the downstream datasets contain multiple texts for each image,\nwe change the ground-truth label of ITC to consider multiple positives in the queue, where each positive has a ground-truth probability of 1/#‚Äãpositives1#positives1/\\#\\mathrm{positives}.\nDuring inference,\nwe first compute the feature similarity score sitcsubscriptùë†itcs_{\\mathrm{itc}} for all image-text pairs.\nThen we take the top-kùëòk candidates and calculate their ITM score sitmsubscriptùë†itms_{\\mathrm{itm}} for ranking.\nBecause kùëòk can be set to be very small,\nour inference speed is much faster than methods that require computing the ITM score for all image-text pairs¬†[ref]2  [ref]8. Visual Entailment (SNLI-VE555results on SNLI-VE should be interpreted with caution because its test data has been reported to be noisy¬†[ref]50¬†) is a fine-grained visual reasoning\ntask to predict whether the relationship between an image and a text is entailment, neutral, or contradictory.\nWe follow UNITER¬†[ref]2 and consider VE as a three-way classification problem,\nand predict the class probabilities using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on the multimodal encoder‚Äôs representation of the [CLS] token. Visual Question Answering (VQA¬†) requires the model to predict an answer given an image and a question.\nDifferent from existing methods that formulate VQA as a multi-answer classification problem¬† [ref]2,\nwe consider VQA as an answer generation problem, similar to¬†.\nSpecifically, we use a 6-layer transformer decoder to generate the answer.\nAs shown in Figure¬†3a,\nthe auto-regressive answer decoder receives the multimodal embeddings through cross attention,\nand a start-of-sequence token ([CLS]) is used as the decoder‚Äôs initial input token.\nLikewise, an end-of-sequence token ([SEP]) is appended to the end of decoder\noutputs which indicates the completion of generation.\nThe answer decoder is initialized using the pre-trained weights from the multimodal encoder,\nand finetuned with a conditional language-modeling loss.\nFor a fair comparison with existing methods,\nwe constrain the decoder to only generate from the 3,192 candidate answers¬† during inference. Natural Language for Visual Reasoning (NLVR2¬†)\nrequires the model to predict whether a text describes a pair of images.\nWe extend our multimodal encoder to enable reasoning over two images.\nAs shown in Figure¬†3b,\neach layer of the multimodal encoder is replicated to have two consecutive transformer blocks,\nwhere each block contains a self-attention layer, a cross-attention layer, and a feed-forward layer (see Figure¬†1).\nThe two blocks within each layer are initialized using the same pre-trained weights,\nand the two cross-attention layers share the same linear projection weights for the keys and values.\nDuring training,\nthe two blocks receive two sets of image embeddings for the image pair.\nWe append a MLP classifier on the multimodal encoder‚Äôs [CLS] representation for prediction. For NLVR2, we perform an additional pre-training step to prepare the new multimodal encoder for encoding an image-pair.\nWe design a text-assignment (TA) task as follows:\ngiven a pair of images and a text, the model needs to assign the text to either the first image, the second image, or none of them.\nWe consider it as a three-way classification problem, and use a FC layer on the [CLS] representation to predict the assignment.\nWe pre-train with TA for only 1 epoch using the 4M images (Section¬†3.4). Visual Grounding\naims to localize the region in an image that corresponds to a specific textual description.\nWe study the weakly-supervised setting,\nwhere no bounding box annotations are available.\nWe perform experiments on the RefCOCO+¬† dataset,\nand fine-tune the model using only image-text supervision following the same strategy as image-text retrieval.\nDuring inference,\nwe extend Grad-CAM¬† to acquire heatmaps, and use them to rank the detected proposals provided by¬†.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: sitmsubscriptùë†itms_{\\mathrm{itm}} for ranking.\nBecause kùëòk can be set to be very small,\nour inference speed is much faster than methods that require computing the ITM score for all image-text pairs¬†[ref]2  [ref]8.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
