      "content": "Paper Title: Curiosity creates Diversity in Policy Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFinding the optimal policy in an environment is a trade-off between exploration and exploitation and early rewards can guide this trade-off towards rewarding parts of environment.\nHowever, in reward-sparse environments, all rewards are null except in some specific goal states; finding an optimal policy therefore becomes a difficult and uninformed exploration problem.\nMany real-world problems can be modelled as reward-sparse Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), such as robotic control   and autonomous vehicle stress testing 6. Many traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, such as , handle this trade-off by adding some form of noise to the most promising action. Similarly, population-based policy search methods like evolutionary strategies (ES), such as , generate a variety of exploratory control policies by introducing noise in the policy parameter space.\nHowever, when the reward is sparse, noise-based approaches explore only a local part of the environment and fail to find rewarding states, for example in robotic control tasks . A separate approach to overcome the sparse reward problem is to use exploration bonuses to reward exploration. Early examples of exploration bonuses are count-based exploration methods [ref]5 which count the number of visits to a state and reward visiting states which have low counts. More recent approaches use approximations of exploration with neural networks, such as Random Network Distillation (RND)  which uses the prediction error between a randomly initialized network and a distilled network as the exploration bonus. Variational Intrinsic Control 1 and the Diversity is All You Need algorithm (DIAYN) [ref]15 use measures from information theory to quantify the distribution of states visited by an RL policy, which is used in an exploration reward. In this work, we specifically focus on intrinsic motivation methods [ref]3 which reward policies for covering unexplored or under-explored transitions. We base this work on Curiosity , a type of intrinsic motivation which rewards policies for discovering transitions that are different from those seen previously. Population-based methods have been used on sparse reward environments, specifically through the use of objective functions which encourage exploration. Quality Diversity (QD) methods, such as Novelty Search (NS) 7 and MAP-Elites , are Genetic Algorithms that encourage policies to cover new areas of a predefined behavior space, such as the terminal state of a policy. Novelty has been demonstrated to be a useful intrinsic motivation for ES  but requires the definition of a behavior space, which can be a limiting factor in applying QD methods. In this paper, we show that Curiosity can be used as an intrinsic fitness metric to explore sparse reward environments. We use Curiosity as a self-supervised prediction metric on transitions covered throughout the full episode which accumulates to an overall Curiosity fitness score. We study Curiosity as the intrinsic fitness of an evolutionary strategy by proposing Curiosity-ES. We demonstrate that Curiosity-ES outperforms state of the art QD methods such as MAP-Elites on maze navigation and robotic control tasks without requiring an explicit behavior definition. We show empirically that Curiosity leads to the exploration of transitions which are different from previously seen transitions, allowing for multiple reward-finding trajectories to be discovered. We first contextualize Curiosity-ES with other policy search algorithms, notably Novelty Search and other Evolutionary Strategies, in section 2. We expand on Curiosity and its use in Reinforcement Learning in subsection 2.3. We then present Curiosity-ES in section 3, detailing how Curiosity is calculated over a trajectory and aggregated as a fitness metric. The maze navigation and robotic control environments and experimental parameters used in this article are detailed section 4. We compare Curiosity-ES to a set of QD and RL algorithms on these two environments using both extrinsic and intrinsic reward in section 5, finding that Curiosity leads to more exploration and more efficient policies on both types of environments. We provide a detailed study of the diversity of rewarding policies on of the maze navigation tasks in section 6. Finally, we discuss the implications of Curiosity in population-based methods and define future directions in section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: tasks .
