      "content": "Paper Title: Gibbs Sampling with People\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMCMC is a procedure for sampling from distributions whose normalization constants are impractical to compute directly. It works by constructing a Markov chain whose stationary distribution corresponds to the probability distribution of interest; given enough samples from this Markov chain, it is then possible to approximate the probability distribution arbitrarily closely. The MCMC algorithm may be performed by choosing an arbitrary initial Markov state x𝑥x from the parameter space, then repeating the following steps until convergence:\n(1) Sample a candidate x∗superscript𝑥∗x^{\\ast} for the next state of the Markov chain according to some proposal function q​(x∗;x)𝑞superscript𝑥∗𝑥q(x^{\\ast};x);\n(2) Decide whether to accept this candidate according to an appropriate acceptance function A​(x∗;x)𝐴superscript𝑥∗𝑥A(x^{\\ast};x) constructed to reflect the probability distribution of interest.\nIn the case of a symmetric proposal function, the acceptance function takes a simple form known as the Barker acceptance function and is given by A​(x∗;x)=π​(x∗)/(π​(x)+π​(x∗))𝐴superscript𝑥∗𝑥𝜋superscript𝑥∗𝜋𝑥𝜋superscript𝑥∗A(x^{\\ast};x)=\\pi(x^{\\ast})/(\\pi(x)+\\pi(x^{\\ast})) where π​(x)𝜋𝑥\\pi(x) is the target distribution . In MCMCP the acceptance function is replaced with a human participant, whose task is to choose between the current state and the candidate state 5. The trick is then to frame this task such that the participant’s choices correspond to the acceptance function for an interesting probability distribution.\nThe solution presented in the original MCMCP paper is to tell the participant that one of the stimuli comes from a class distribution (e.g., cats), and one of them comes from an unknown category. The authors suppose that the participant computes the posterior probability of class membership assuming a locally uniform likelihood for the alternative class, and then selects a stimulus with probability proportional to its posterior probability of class membership. Under these assumptions, the participant’s behaviour can be shown to correspond to the classic Barker acceptance function where the underlying probability distribution is the likelihood function for the class being judged. This formulation is elegant but it has two important limitations. First, it can only be applied to semantic representations that take categorical forms; the derivation does not make sense for continuous semantic representations (e.g., pleasantness). Second, it assumes that participants make their choices with probabilities equal to their posterior probabilities of class membership (a process termed probability matching) as opposed to the Bayes-optimal strategy of deterministically maximizing this posterior probability [ref]54. Humans do indeed seem to exhibit probability matching in certain contexts, but a convincing cognitive model ought to explain how this sub-optimal process arises . Here we reformulate MCMCP (and later GSP) without these limitations. We suppose that the participant is asked to select the stimulus that best matches a given criterion C𝐶C; for example ‘select the most pleasant chord’ or ‘select the color that most resembles lavender’. We suppose that the participant performs this task by extracting a utility value for each stimulus, and selecting the stimulus with the maximum utility . In the case of the class membership tasks typically used in MCMCP, we might hypothesize that the utility corresponds to the subjective likelihood of the stimulus conditioned on the class of interest; however, in the general case the utility function need not necessarily correspond to a probability distribution. The utility value is however assumed to have a deterministic component and a noise component, namely Ui=ℓi+nisubscript𝑈𝑖subscriptℓ𝑖subscript𝑛𝑖U_{i}=\\ell_{i}+n_{i}, where ℓisubscriptℓ𝑖\\ell_{i} is the deterministic utility of stimulus i𝑖i, and nisubscript𝑛𝑖n_{i} is the associated noise. This noise component can capture participant-level noise from sensory   and cognitive  4 processes, as well as population-level noise corresponding to individual differences in the utility function . In the case where the noise components are i.i.d. and have an extreme value distribution common to discrete choice models, it can be shown that the probability of selecting a given stimulus s1subscript𝑠1s_{1} is equal to\n(1+exp⁡(−γ​(ℓ1−ℓ2)))−1superscript1𝛾subscriptℓ1subscriptℓ21(1+\\exp({-\\gamma(\\ell_{1}-\\ell_{2})}))^{-1}\nwhere γ−1superscript𝛾1\\gamma^{-1} corresponds to the scale parameter of the noise component. If the utility is assigned based on subjective likelihood ℓi=log⁡p​(si|C)subscriptℓ𝑖𝑝conditionalsubscript𝑠𝑖𝐶\\ell_{i}=\\log p(s_{i}|C), then this equation\nreproduces the Barker acceptance function with target distribution π​(s)∝pγ​(s|C)proportional-to𝜋𝑠superscript𝑝𝛾conditional𝑠𝐶\\pi(s)\\propto p^{\\gamma}(s|C). This justifies MCMCP for an optimal observer with a noisy utility function (for proof and discussion see Appendix A.1).\n\nReference markers found: [54]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]54: equal to their posterior probabilities of class membership (a process termed probability matching) as opposed to the Bayes-optimal strategy of deterministically maximizing this posterior probability [ref]54.
