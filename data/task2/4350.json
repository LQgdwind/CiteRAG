      "content": "Paper Title: CoSCL: Cooperation of Small Continual Learners is Stronger than a Big One\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nContinual Learning requires effective learning of incremental tasks without severe catastrophic forgetting. Representative strategies include weight regularization   , memory replay   , parameter isolation  8 and dynamic architecture 4 . These strategies either learn all tasks with a single model, which have to compromise the performance of each task to obtain a shared solution [ref]35; or allocate parameter subspace for each task to prevent mutual interference, yet limited by scalability.\nSeveral recent work tried to improve continual learning in terms of architecture, such as by using neural architecture search  or learning an additional set of shared parameters 7, but to a limited extent. [ref]35 proposed a model zoo that incrementally adds sub-networks to learn new tasks, which had to store a large amount of old training samples. Flatness of Loss Landscape provides a conceptual explanation of generalization for deep neural networks, which is recently introduced to understand catastrophic forgetting in continual learning   1 [ref]6 . The core idea is that convergence to a smooth region will be more robust to (mild) parameter changes.  2 analyzed that the forgetting of old tasks in continual learning can be bounded by the variation of parameters between tasks and the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, where the lower eigenvalues indicate a flatter curvature of the solution. [ref]6  1 explicitly encouraged the network to find a flat minima and empirically validated its efficacy in continual learning. Ensemble Model is a powerful architecture to improve generalization, but is still under explored in continual learning. Most current applications focus on learning each single task with a sub-network   , which can be seen as a special case of dynamic architecture. The main limitation is that the total amount of parameters (resp., the storage and computational cost) might grow linearly with the number of incremental tasks.  proposed an efficient ensemble strategy to reduce extra parameter cost for task-specific sub-networks. Similar to ours, a concurrent work 3 also observed that ensemble of multiple continual learning models brings huge benefits. They further exploited recent advances of mode connectivity  and neural network subspace  to save computational cost, but had to use old training samples 3. Besides, 2 achieved more effective weight regularization by ensemble of multiple auxiliary classifiers learned from extra out-of-distribution data (e.g., SVHN  for CIFAR-100 1). Main Advantages of Our Work are summarized in three aspects: (1) The generalization bounds presented in our work demonstrate the direct link between continual learning performance and flatness of loss landscape (as well as other components). (2) We use a fixed number of sub-networks, which are all continual learners rather than single-task learners, and adjust their width accordingly, so no additional or growing parameters are needed. (3) We mainly focus on a restrict setting where old training samples or extra data sources are not needed, which is more general and realistic for continual learning.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: , parameter isolation  8 and dynamic architecture 4 .
