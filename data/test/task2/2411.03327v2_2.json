    "multi-type mev detection": "Varun et al. 0 proposed a neural network-based approach to detect front-running and sandwich transactions, specifically targeting displacement and suppression front-running and single and cross-DEX sandwich transactions. Their approach involves extracting features for a transaction based on prior transactions and inputting them into a pre-trained Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model to identify MEV transactions. The features extracted include the transaction’s gas price, the mean and standard deviation of transactions’ gas prices over the last 10 blocks, the mean and standard deviation of the same account’s historical gas prices, gas token usage, and a predicted gas price. The predicted gas price is obtained using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model based on the gas prices of the previous 12 non-MEV transactions. Using the MEV transactions data identified by Torres et al.  for training and validation, the approach achieved accuracies of 85.53% for suppression front-running transactions, 88.58% for displacement front-running transactions, and 89.08% for sandwich transactions. However, the proposed learning-based model may be prone to overfitting as it depends on a tailored dataset and might fail to generalize to a wider range of front-running and sandwich transactions. Li et al.  introduced a learning-based approach to detect sandwich, arbitrage, and liquidation MEV transactions. The authors proposed ACTLIFTER, which identifies MEV transactions within Flashbot bundles by mapping them to asset transfer patterns. Additionally, they developed ACTCLUSTER to discover new categories of MEV transactions within the sandwich, arbitrage, and liquidation types. ACTCLUSTER clusters MEV actions identified by ACTLIFTER by converting the bundle into a matrix where each DeFi action is represented as an action block. This matrix is processed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract features, which are then flattened and fed into three fully connected neural network layers. MEV actions are initially labeled as a sandwich, cyclic arbitrage, or liquidation transaction, with these labels being extended after each clustering round using DBSCAN. ACTLIFTER achieved better detection results compared to Etherscan171717https://etherscan.io/, accessed on 05 September 2024 and DeFiRanger 1. However, ACTLIFTER is limited to identifying swap activities involving a token pair and fails to detect token chains. Table III presents the capabilities of the proposed detection approaches in detecting different types of MEV transactions. In the context of front-running MEV transactions, no approach focuses on replacement transactions. Regarding sandwich MEV transactions, most works focus on detecting single and cross-DEX sandwich transactions      0 . Only a few focus on detection of burger  , dagwood , and liquidation sandwich   transactions. No single approach is capable of detecting all types of sandwich transactions. Furthermore, all these approaches are limited to single-block sandwich transactions. Consequently, the detected sandwich transactions represent only lower bounds and could result in a high number of false negatives  . For arbitrage detection, most works focus on ordered cyclic transactions      . Additionally, most of the works      are limited to atomic arbitrage transactions, where multiple swap events occur within a single transaction. Only  addresses arbitrages performed through both atomic and non-atomic transactions. Lastly, only  focuses on the detection of liquidation MEV transactions. To summarize, there is no work that is capable of detecting all types of MEV transactions. Furthermore, the detection results presented by the studies discussed above         0  are only estimates of MEV, as there is no definitive ground truth for MEV . In addition, these works represent reactive MEV detection approaches, focusing on quantifying MEV acquired in the past. Estimating potential or future MEV via a proactive approach is challenging because the MEV obtained by each searcher varies based on the optimization techniques used to maximize MEV and the targeted victim transactions ."
