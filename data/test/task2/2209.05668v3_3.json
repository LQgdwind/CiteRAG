    "iv-a experiments on data augmentation": "Datasets and competing methods. In this subsection, two benchmark image classification data sets, namely, CIFAR10 [ref]29 and CIFAR100 [ref]29, are used. Both data consist of 32√ó\\times32 natural images in 10 classes for CIFAR10 and 100 classes for CIFAR100. There are 50,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing. The training and testing configurations used in¬†[ref]12 are followed. Several classical and state-of-the-art robust loss functions and (semantic) data augmentation methods are compared: Large-margin loss¬†[ref]32, Disturb label¬†, Focal Loss¬†, Center loss¬†, Lq loss¬†,\nCGAN¬†, ACGAN¬†, infoGAN¬†, ISDA, and ISDA + Dropout. The Wide-ResNet-28¬† and ResNet-110¬† are used as the base neural networks. Considering that the training/testing configuration is fixed for both sets, the results of the above competing methods reported in the ISDA paper¬†[ref]12 are directly presented (some are from their original papers). The training settings for the above base neural networks also follow the instructions of ISDA paper and its released codes. Our methods have two variants. LPL (mean+fixed bound). In this version, the optimization in Eq. (27) is used. Mean denotes that the threshold is mean‚Äã(q¬Øc)meansubscript¬Øùëûùëê\\text{mean}({\\bar{q}_{c}}). Fixed bound means that the value of œµcsubscriptitalic-œµùëê\\epsilon_{c} is fixed and identical for all categories during optimization. It is searched in {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4}. LPL (mean+varied bound). In this version, the optimization in Eq. (27) is used. Theoretically, varied bound means that the value of œµcsubscriptitalic-œµùëê\\epsilon_{c} is varied according to Eq. (33). However, the varied bounds in the same batch make the implementation more difficult and increase the training complexity. In our implementation, we choose to set a varied number of updating steps for each category in our PGD-like optimization. The value of Œî‚ÄãœµŒîitalic-œµ\\Delta\\epsilon is searched in {0.1, 0.2}. The Top-1 error is used as the evaluation metric. The performances of the base neural networks with the standard cross-entropy loss are re-run before running our methods to conduct a fair comparison. Almost identical results are obtained compared with the published results in the ISDA paper. Results. Tables I and II present the results of all competing methods on the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, respectively. Our LPL method (two versions) achieves the best performance almost under both the two base neural networks. ISDA achieves the second-best performance. Only in the case of Wide-ResNet-28-10 on CIFAR100, LPL (mean+fixed œµcsubscriptitalic-œµùëê\\epsilon_{c}) is inferior to ISDA. However, the former still achieves the fourth lowest error. The results of LPL with varied bounds are better than those of LPL with fixed bounds. This comparison indicates the rationality of our motivation that the category with relatively low (high) performance should be more positively (negatively) augmented. In the final part of this section, more analyses will be conducted to compare ISDA and our method. Naturally, the varied threshold will further improve the performances."
