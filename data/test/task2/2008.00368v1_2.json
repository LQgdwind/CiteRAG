    "related work": "Data Privacy and Data Cleaning. \nWe extend the PACAS framework introduced in¬†, which focuses on repairs involving ground values. While the prior PACAS framework prices and returns generalized values, the CL does not allow generalized values in its relation RCLsubscriptùëÖCLR_{\\textit{CL}}. Instead, the CL instantiates a grounding process to ground any generalized values returned by the SP. In this work, we remove this limitation by re-defining the notion of consistency between RCLsubscriptùëÖCLR_{\\textit{CL}} and the set of FDs Œ£Œ£\\Sigma to include generalized values. We have also extended the budget allocation scheme to consider allocations according to the proportion of errors in which cells (in an equivalence class) participate. This improves the PACAS framework to be more adaptive to the changing number of unresolved errors instead of only assigning fixed allocations. Our revised experiments, using repair error Œ¥ùõø\\delta as a measure of accuracy, show the influence of generalized repairs along varying parameters towards improved efficiency and effectiveness. There has been limited work that considers data privacy requirements in data cleaning. Jaganathan and Wright propose a privacy-preserving protocol between two parties that imputes missing data using a lazy decision-tree imputation algorithm . Information-theoretic metrics have been used to quantify the information loss incurred by disclosing sensitive data values¬†7 . As mentioned previously, PrivateClean provides a framework for data cleaning on local deferentially private relations using a set of generic user-defined cleaning operations showing the trade-off between privacy bounds and query accuracy¬†. While PrivateClean provides stronger privacy bounds than PACAS, these bounds are only applicable under fixed query budgets that limit the number of allowed queries (only aggregation queries), which is difficult to enforce in interactive settings. Our evaluation has shown the significant repair error that PrivateClean incurs due to the inherent randomization needed in local differential privacy. Ge et. al., introduce APEx, an accuracy-aware, data privacy engine for sensitive data exploration that allow users to pose adaptive queries with a required accuracy bound. APEx returns query answers satisfying the bound and guarantees that the entire data exploration process is differentially private with minimal privacy loss. Similar to PACAS, APEx allows users to interact with private data through declarative queries, albeit specific aggregate queries (PACAS has no such restriction). APEx enable users to perform specific tasks over the privatized data, such as entity resolution. While similar in spirit, APEx uses the given query accuracy bound to tune differential privacy mechanisms to find a privacy level œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon that satisfies the accuracy bound. In contrast, PACAS applies generalization to target predicates in the given query requests, without randomizing the entire dataset, albeit with looser privacy guarantees, but with higher data utility.\n Dependency Based Cleaning.  Declarative approaches to data cleaning (cf.¬† for a survey) have focused on achieving consistency against a set of dependencies such as FDs and inclusion dependencies and their extensions. Data quality semantics are declaratively specified with the dependencies, and data values that violate the dependencies are identified as errors, and repaired¬†     8. There are a wide range of cleaning algorithms, based on user/expert feedback¬†0 1 2, master database¬† , knowledge bases or crowdsourcing¬†3, probabilitic inference 4 5. Our repair algorithm builds upon these existing techniques to include data disclosure requirements of sensitive data and suggesting generalized values as repair candidates. Data Privacy. \nPPDP uses generalization and suppression to limit data disclosure of sensitive values  . The generalization problem has been shown to be intractable, where optimization, and approximation algorithms have been proposed (cf.¬† for a survey). Extensions have proposed tighter restrictions to the baseline kùëòk-anonymity model to protect against similarity and skewness attacks by considering the distribution of the sensitive attributes in the overall population in the table¬†. Our extensions to (X,Y)-anonymity to include semantics via the VGH¬†can be applied to existing PPDP techniques to semantically enrich the generalization process such that semantically equivalent values are not inadvertently disclosed. In differential privacy, the removal, addition or replacement of a single record in a database should not significantly impact the outcome of any statistical analysis over the database¬†6. An underlying assumption requires that the service provider know in advance the set of queries over the released data. This assumption does not hold for the interactive, service-based data cleaning setting considered in this paper. PACAS aims to address this limitation by marrying PPDP and data pricing in interactive settings. Data Pricing. \nWe use the framework by Deep and Koutris that provides a scalable, arbitrage-free pricing for SQL queries over relational databases . Recent work has considered pricing functions to include additional properties such as being reasonable (differentiated query pricing based on differentiated answers), and predictable, non-disclosive (the inability to infer unpaid query answers from query prices) and regret-free (asking a sequence of queries during multiple interactions is no more costly than asking at once)¬†. We are investigating extensions of SafePrice to include some of these properties."
