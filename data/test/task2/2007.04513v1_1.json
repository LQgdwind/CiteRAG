    "introduction": "Let G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) be a simple, connected, undirected graph. A disconnecting set of G𝐺G is a set of edges F⊆E​(G)𝐹𝐸𝐺F\\subseteq E(G) whose removal disconnects G𝐺G. The edge-connectivity of G𝐺G is κ′​(G)=min⁡{|F|:F is a disconnecting set of G}superscript𝜅′𝐺:𝐹F is a disconnecting set of G\\kappa^{\\prime}(G)=\\min\\{|F|:\\mbox{$F$ is a disconnecting set of $G$}\\}. A cut [S,T]𝑆𝑇[S,T] of G𝐺G is a partition of V𝑉V into two subsets S𝑆S and T=V∖S𝑇𝑉𝑆T=V\\setminus S. The cut-set ∂(S)𝑆\\partial(S) of a cut [S,T]𝑆𝑇[S,T] is the set of edges that have one endpoint in S𝑆S and the other endpoint in T𝑇T; these edges are said to cross the cut. In a connected graph, each cut-set determines a unique cut.\nNote that every cut-set is a disconnecting set, but the converse is not true.\nAn inclusion-wise minimal disconnecting set of a graph is called a bond (or a minimal cut). It is easy to see that every bond is a cut-set, but there are cut-sets that are not bonds. More precisely, a nonempty set of edges F𝐹F of G𝐺G is a bond if and only if F𝐹F determines a cut [S,T]𝑆𝑇[S,T] of G𝐺G such that G​[S]𝐺delimited-[]𝑆G[S] and G​[T]𝐺delimited-[]𝑇G[T] are both connected. Let s,t∈V​(G)𝑠𝑡𝑉𝐺s,t\\in V(G). An s​t𝑠𝑡st-bond of G𝐺G is a bond whose removal disconnects s𝑠s and t𝑡t. A minimum (maximum) cut of a graph G𝐺G is a cut with cut-set of minimum (maximum) size. Every minimum cut is a bond, thus a minimum bond is also a minimum cut of G𝐺G, and it can be found in polynomial time using the classical Edmonds–Karp algorithm . Besides that, minimum s​t𝑠𝑡st-bonds are well-known structures, since they are precisely the s​t𝑠𝑡st-cuts involved in the Gomory-Hu trees . Maximum Cut is one of the most fundamental problems in theoretical computer science. Given a graph G𝐺G and an integer k𝑘k, the problem asks for a subset S𝑆S of vertices such that |∂(S)|≥k𝑆𝑘|\\partial(S)|\\geq k. Whenever the subgraph of G𝐺G induced by S𝑆S is connected, the cut [S,V∖S]𝑆𝑉𝑆[S,V\\setminus S] is called connected. Recall that every bond is a connected cut, but the converse is not true. In this paper, we are interested in the complexity aspects of the following problem. \n\n\nMaximum Connected Cut\nInstance: A graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E); a positive integer k𝑘k.\nQuestion: Is there a proper subset S⊂V​(G)𝑆𝑉𝐺S\\subset V(G) such that G​[S]𝐺delimited-[]𝑆G[S] is connected and |∂(S)|≥k𝑆𝑘|\\partial(S)|\\geq k?\n\n \n\n\nLargest Bond\nInstance: A graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E); a positive integer k𝑘k.\nQuestion: Is there a proper subset S⊂V​(G)𝑆𝑉𝐺S\\subset V(G) such that G​[S]𝐺delimited-[]𝑆G[S] and G​[V∖S]𝐺delimited-[]𝑉𝑆G[V\\setminus S] are both connected and |∂(S)|≥k𝑆𝑘|\\partial(S)|\\geq k?\n\n We also consider the versions of both problems where the removal of the cut-set must disconnect a given pair of vertices. \n\n\nMaximum Connected s​t𝑠𝑡st-Cut\nInstance: A graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E); vertices s,t∈V​(G)𝑠𝑡𝑉𝐺s,t\\in V(G); a positive integer k𝑘k.\n\n\nQuestion: Is there a proper subset S⊂V​(G)𝑆𝑉𝐺S\\subset V(G) with s∈S𝑠𝑆s\\in S and t∉S𝑡𝑆t\\notin S, such that G​[S]𝐺delimited-[]𝑆G[S] is connected and |∂(S)|≥k𝑆𝑘|\\partial(S)|\\geq k?\n\n \n\n\nLargest s​t𝑠𝑡st-Bond\n\n\nInstance: A graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E); vertices s,t∈V​(G)𝑠𝑡𝑉𝐺s,t\\in V(G); a positive integer k𝑘k.\n\n\nQuestion: Is there a proper subset S⊂V​(G)𝑆𝑉𝐺S\\subset V(G) with s∈S𝑠𝑆s\\in S and t∉S𝑡𝑆t\\notin S, such that G​[S]𝐺delimited-[]𝑆G[S] and G​[V∖S]𝐺delimited-[]𝑉𝑆G[V\\setminus S] are both connected and |∂(S)|≥k𝑆𝑘|\\partial(S)|\\geq k?\n\n Such problems can be seen as variants of Maximum Cut, which was shown to be NP-hard in Karp’s seminal work 3. To overcome this intractability, a lot of researches have been done from various view points, such as approximation algorithms , fixed-parameter tractability , and special graph classes     . The Maximum Connected Cut problem was defined in 0 and it is known to be NP-complete even on planar graphs . Regarding bonds on planar graphs, a folklore theorem states that if G𝐺G is a connected planar graph, then a set of edges is a cycle in G𝐺G if and only if it corresponds to a bond in the dual graph of G𝐺G . Note that each cycle separates the faces of G𝐺G into the faces in the interior of the cycle and the faces of the exterior of the cycle, and the duals of the cycle edges are exactly the edges that cross from the interior to the exterior . Consequently, the girth of a planar graph equals the edge connectivity of its dual .\nAlthough cuts and bonds are similar, computing the largest bond of a graph seems to be harder than computing its maximum cut. Maximum Cut is NP-hard in general , but becomes polynomial for planar graphs . On the other hand, finding a longest cycle in a planar graph is NP-hard, implying that finding a largest bond of a planar multigraph (or of a simple edge-weighted planar graph) is NP-hard. In addition, it is well-known that if a simple planar graph is 333-vertex-connected, then its dual is a simple planar graph. In 1976, Garey, Johnson, and Tarjan  proved that the problem of establishing whether a 333-vertex-connected planar graph is Hamiltonian is NP-complete, thus, as also noted by Haglin and Venkatesan 0, finding the largest bond of a simple planar graph is also NP-hard, contrasting with the polynomial-time solvability of Maximum Cut on planar graphs. Recently, Chaourar proved that Largest Bond can be solved in polynomial time on series parallel graphs and graphs without K5∖esubscript𝐾5𝑒K_{5}\\setminus e as a minor in  . Computing the largest bond of a graph G𝐺G corresponds to compute the maximum minimal cut of G𝐺G. Graph problems about finding a maximum minimal (or minimum maximal) solutions such as Maximum Minimal Vertex Cover  0, Maximum Minimal Dominating Set , Maximum Minimal Edge Cover , Maximum Minimal Separator , Minimum Maximal matching  , and Minimum Maximal Independent Set 0, have been long studied. From the point of view of parameterized complexity, it is well known that Maximum Cut can be solved in FPT time when parametrized by the size of the solution , and since every graph has a cut with at least half the edges 6, it follows that it has a linear kernel. Concerning approximation algorithms, a 1/2121/2-approximation algorithm can be obtained by randomly partitioning the set vertices into two parts, which induces a cut-set whose expected size is at least half of the number of edges . The best-known result is the seminal work of Goemans and Williamson , who gave a 0.8780.8780.878-approximation based on semidefinite programming. This has the best approximation factor unless the Unique Games Conjecture fails .\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no algorithmic study regarding the parameterized complexity of computing the largest bond of a graph as well as the approximability of the problem.\nObserve that a bond induces a feasible solution of Maximum Connected Cut, but not the other way around, since G​[T]𝐺delimited-[]𝑇G[T] may be disconnected. Indeed, the size of a largest bond can be arbitrarily smaller than the size of the maximum connected cut; take, e.g., a star with n𝑛n leaves.\nFor Maximum Connected Cut on general graphs, there exists a Ω​(1/log⁡n)Ω1𝑛\\Omega(1/\\log n)-approximation , where n𝑛n is the number of vertices. Also, there is a constant-factor approximation with factor 1/2121/2 for graphs of bounded treewidth , and a polynomial-time approximation scheme for graphs of bounded genus . Recently, Saurabh and Zehavi  considered a generalization of Maximum Connected Cut, named Multi-Node Hub. In this problem, given numbers l𝑙l and k𝑘k, the objective is to find a cut [S,T]𝑆𝑇[S,T] of G𝐺G such that G​[S]𝐺delimited-[]𝑆G[S] is connected, |S|=l𝑆𝑙|S|=l and |∂(S)|≥k𝑆𝑘|\\partial(S)|\\geq k.\nThey observed that the problem is W​𝑊delimited-[]1W-hard when parameterized on l𝑙l, and gave the first parameterized algorithm for the problem with respect to the parameter k𝑘k. We remark that the W​𝑊delimited-[]1W-hardness also holds for Largest Bond parameterized by |S|𝑆|S|. Since every nonempty bond determines a cut [S,T]𝑆𝑇[S,T] such that G​[S]𝐺delimited-[]𝑆G[S] and G​[T]𝐺delimited-[]𝑇G[T] are both connected, every bond of G𝐺G has size at most |E​(G)|−|V​(G)|+2𝐸𝐺𝑉𝐺2|E(G)|-|V(G)|+2. A graph G𝐺G has a bond of size |E​(G)|−|V​(G)|+2𝐸𝐺𝑉𝐺2|E(G)|-|V(G)|+2 if and only if V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) can be partitioned into two parts such that each part induces a tree. Such graphs are known as Yutsis graphs. The set of planar Yutsis graphs is exactly the dual class of Hamiltonian planar graphs.\nAccording to Aldred, Van Dyck, Brinkmann, Fack, and McKay , cubic Yutsis graphs appear in the quantum theory of angular momenta as a graphical representation of general recoupling coefficients. They can be manipulated following certain rules in order to generate the so-called summation formulae for the general recoupling coefficient (see  3 ). There are very few results about the largest bond size in general graphs. In 2008, Aldred, Van Dyck, Brinkmann, Fack, and McKay  showed that if a Yutsis graph is regular with degree 333, the partition of the vertex set from the largest bond will result in two sets of equal size. In 2015, Ding, Dziobiak and Wu 1 proved that any simple 333-connected graph G𝐺G will have a largest bond with size at least 217​log⁡n217𝑛\\frac{2}{17}\\sqrt{\\log n}, where n=|V​(G)|𝑛𝑉𝐺n=|V(G)|. In 2017, Flynn 8 verified the conjecture that any simple 333-connected graph G𝐺G has a largest bond with size at least Ω​(nlog3⁡2)Ωsuperscript𝑛subscript32\\Omega(n^{\\log_{3}2}) for a variety of graph classes including planar graphs. Even though there are many important applications of Maximum Connected Cut and Largest Bond such as image segmentation , forest planning 1, and computing a market splitting for electricity markets , the known results are much fewer than those for Maximum Cut due to the difficult nature of simultaneously maximizing its size and handling the connectivity of a cut."
