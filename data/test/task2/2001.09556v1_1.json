    "ii related work": "Density prediction approaches Regression-based algorithms are developed to regress the object count of interest from crowd images. Recently, end-to-end trainable deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely adopted in crowd counting task. These DNNs are optimized to predict a density map that approximates ground truth crowd distribution. For example, Zhang et al.  solve the cross-scene crowd counting problem with a deep convolutional neural network fed with density map and global count datasets. The quality of density map can have a non-negligible impact on counting results.  witnesses a significant boost in the crowd counting performance after adopting density map refinement framework. Localization approaches Early counting by detection methods    2 rely on hand-crafted features, which cannot well handle those highly congested scenes with occlusions. Nowadays deep learning models have become key solution to object detection problem. Therefore, many researches seek to apply deep learning based detection frameworks into crowd counting, and have achieved remarkable performance improvements. 3 proposes an end-to-end trainable human detector for crowded scenes. For scenes with few occlusion and low density, well-trained detector is able to localize objects. For example, DecideNet  deploys human detector to rectify counting in low density regions. However in many crowd scenes, people head are so small that bounding box annotations are not suitable. Therefore, dot annotation on every head center is usually used in crowd localization task. This limits the application of detection based methods in crowd counting. Additionally, the high density becomes a hurdle for traditional counting by detection approaches. In this paper, we will demonstrate that detection based method can not only give highly precise localization results, but also obtain comparable even better counting performance by introducing compressed sensing techniques into detection framework. Compressed sensing based output encoding Compressed sensing (CS)    and sparse coding (SC) 8 have emerged as new frameworks for signal acquisition and reconstruction, with rich theoretical results and significant practical applications, such as MRI scan time reduction  and economical camera design . CS-based encoding has a rather modest presence in the literature, where it was applied with linear and non-linear machine learners. One early research in the output encoding with error correcting ability  had shown superior accuracy. In the recent past, redundancy in the output representation  yielded more accurate predictions. Recently, non-linear predictors such as a Bayesian learner , Decision trees  or CNN  were used. Viswanathan et al.  used Bayesian inference with CS and showed good accuracy in prediction. Decision trees and gradient boosting had also been used in conjunction with CS encoding to yield good prediction accuracies . Recent researches    focused on the cross domain application of compressive sensing and deep learning. For example,  develops a CS-based tumor cell localization scheme and proposing an end-to-end training network. However unlike crowd analysis, size variations of tumor cells are much smaller due to strict operating conditions during making medical microscopy slides, such as tissue collection, sectioning, staining, scanning, etc. Consequently,  doesn’t pay attention to solve target size variation issue. Without the ability to offer different receptive field sizes,  also cannot adaptively emphasize informative channels that have proper receptive field size. Channel-wise attention mechanisms Proper regulation of informative channels can have a positive effect on the overall performance of DNNs. Hu et al.  use a lightweight gating mechanism in SENet to adaptively recalibrate feature maps based on channel-wise dependencies. SKNet  exploits the aggregation of the feature maps of different-sized kernels via selection weights to self-modulate receptive Field sizes and achieves superior performance in object recognition.  proposes weighted channel dropout to filter channels in accordance to activation status and elevates detection performance with a slight computational cost. Multi-scale architectures A number of research attentions have been paid to the scale variation issue. Several piece of initial works    deploy multi-scale image pyramid to refine counting performance in areas that objects are densely present. Recent progress have taken spatial locality , cross scale aggregation , and adaptive scale  into consideration. It has been proven effective to gather multiple branches with distinct targets, such as Switch-CNN  and RAZ-Net .  develops a multi-column CNN that uses different convolution kernel sizes to deal with varying density. 1 adopts a scale-aware training scheme for the multi-branch architecture to give each branch a specialty for corresponding scales and achieves remarkable improvements over baseline approach. Additionally, enlarging receptive field of deep network is another insightful idea, for example CSRnet 4 deploys a sequence of dilation convolutions and takes human body structure into consideration."
