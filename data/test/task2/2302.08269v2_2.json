    "iv-c qualitative comparison of uie methods": "We qualitatively compare the performance of our proposed SyreaNet with other SOTA methods on real underwater images. The results from other methods are either implemented by the original codes or provided by the authors. Thoese methods include traditional method UDCP [ref]4 and learning-based methods UWCNN , WaterNet [ref]39, AIO , GL-Net  and UColor . As shown in Fig. 5, it can be shown that although UDCP [ref]4 is effective in erasing the hazy effect, it fails to deal with bluish/greenish underwater conditions and also results in a dark tone. UWCNN  fails to enhance underwater images effectively, producing a reddish and dark tone. AIO  brightens the images but introduces obvious artifacts. WaterNet [ref]39 is not effective in bluish environments (the 3rd and 4th row). Although GL-Net  and UColor  can enhance underwater images in a variety of underwater conditions, they still fail to effectively remove the bluish/greenish effect for relatively distant objects. In contrast, our proposed SyeraNet outperforms other SOTA methods in enhancing the degraded images in various underwater conditions by consistently removing the water effect (bluish/greenish/hazy). In addition to the effectiveness in removing the water effect, SyreaNet is also superior in restoring the details of degraded underwater images, as shown in Fig. 7."
