    "introduction": "The Ising model is a classical model from statistical physics that arises in multiple sampling and inference tasks across computer science. The model has an edge-interaction parameter b𝑏b and a vertex parameter λ𝜆\\lambda, known as the external field. For a graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E), configurations of the model are all possible assignments of two spins +,-+-\\textup{{+}},\\textup{{-}} to the vertices of G𝐺G. Each configuration σ:V→{+,-}:𝜎→𝑉+-\\sigma:V\\rightarrow\\{\\textup{{+}},\\textup{{-}}\\} has weight λ|n+​(σ)|​bδ​(σ)superscript𝜆subscript𝑛+𝜎superscript𝑏𝛿𝜎\\lambda^{|n_{\\textup{{+}}}(\\sigma)|}b^{\\delta(\\sigma)}, where n+​(σ)subscript𝑛+𝜎n_{\\textup{{+}}}(\\sigma) is the set of vertices that get the spin + under σ𝜎\\sigma and δ​(σ)𝛿𝜎\\delta(\\sigma) is the number of edges that get different spins.111The parametrisation of the Ising model in terms of δ​(σ)𝛿𝜎\\delta(\\sigma) follows the closely related works [ref]35 ; if instead the model is defined in terms of the number of edges with the same spins the edge-interaction parameter 1/b∈(1,∞)1𝑏11/b\\in(1,\\infty) is obtained, whose logarithm is known as the inverse temperature in the physics literature. The partition function is the aggregate weight of all configurations, i.e., In this paper, we consider the problem of approximating the partition function when b∈(0,1]𝑏01b\\in(0,1], known as the ferromagnetic case, and when the parameter λ𝜆\\lambda is in the complex plane. Complex parameters for the Ising model have been studied in the computation of probability amplitudes of quantum circuits, see, e.g.,   . Somewhat surprisingly, and this is one of the main motivations behind this work, complex parameters are also fundamental in understanding the complexity of approximation even for real-valued parameters. In particular, many of the recent advances on the development of approximation algorithms for counting problems have been based on viewing the partition function as a polynomial of the underlying parameters in the complex plane, and using refined interpolation techniques from   to obtain fully polynomial time approximation schemes (𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖠𝖲𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖠𝖲\\mathsf{FPTAS}, see below for the technical definition), even for real values         . The bottleneck of this approach is establishing zero-free regions in the complex plane of the polynomials, which in turn requires an in-depth understanding of the models with complex-valued parameters. This framework of designing approximation algorithms aligns with the classical statistical physics perspective on phase transitions, where zeros in the complex plane have long been studied in the context of phase transitions (see, e.g., 9 4), and several of these classical results have recently been used to obtain efficient approximation algorithms ([ref]35 ). In particular, the celebrated Lee-Yang theorem  says that, when regarding the partition function of the ferromagnetic Ising model as a polynomial in the external field parameter λ𝜆\\lambda, all its zeros, referred to as Lee-Yang zeros, lie on the unit circle in the complex plane. (These Lee-Yang zeros have actually been observed in quantum experiments .) The Lee-Yang theorem was recently used by Liu, Sinclair, and Srivastava [ref]35 to obtain an 𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖠𝖲𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖠𝖲\\mathsf{FPTAS} for approximating the partition function for values λ∈ℂ𝜆ℂ\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{C} that do not lie on the unit circle.\nThis result can be viewed as a derandomisation of the Markov chain based randomised algorithm by Jerrum and Sinclair 5 for λ>0𝜆0\\lambda>0 (see also 0 1), solving a longstanding problem.222Notably, the correlation decay approach, which also yields deterministic approximation algorithms and was key in the full classification of antiferromagnetic 2-spin systems    5, somewhat surprisingly does not perform as well for ferromagnetic systems, see 3 for the state-of-the-art on this front. As noted in [35, Remark p.290], the “no-field” case |λ|=1𝜆1|\\lambda|=1 is unclear, since on the one hand we have the algorithm by 5 for λ=1𝜆1\\lambda=1, on the other hand it is known that Lee-Yang zeros are dense on the unit circle.\nThe density picture was further explored in  for graphs of bounded maximum degree ΔΔ\\Delta, by establishing for each b∈(0,1)𝑏01b\\in(0,1) a symmetric arc around λ=1𝜆1\\lambda=1 on the unit circle where the partition function does not vanish for all graphs of maximum degree at most ΔΔ\\Delta and showing density of the Lee-Yang zeros on the complementary arc. See also 0 for the density result. In this paper we resolve the complexity picture of the ferromagnetic Ising model.\nWe show that for graphs of maximum degree ΔΔ\\Delta approximately computing the partition function is #​𝖯#𝖯\\mathsf{\\#P}-hard333Roughly, #P is the counting version of problems in NP, see, e.g.,  for details., on the arc of the unit circle where the Lee-Yang zeros are dense. See Theorem 1 below for a precise statement of our main results.\nSince on the complementary arc there exists an 𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖠𝖲𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖠𝖲\\mathsf{FPTAS}, by the results of  (in combination with  ), this gives a direct connection between hardness of approximation and the presence of Lee-Yang zeros. Combined with the results of 5 [ref]35, our work therefore classifies the complexity of approximating the partition function of the ferromagnetic Ising model on the complex plane. It should be noted that the existence of zeros does not imply hardness in a straightforward manner.444For example, the graphs in  whose partition function is shown to be zero are trees, and these can be clearly detected in polynomial time. More generally, it is hard to imagine a construction of graphs with vanishing partition function which can directly yield hardness. In any case, our results, following the framework of 9  [ref]7 show hardness for a relaxed version of the problems where zeros do not need to be detected, making all these considerations irrelevant.\nWe obtain the connection between the Lee-Yang zeros and computational complexity via tools from complex dynamical systems. The partition function on trees naturally gives rise to a dynamical system, cf. Section 2.1. Both the hardness of approximating the partition function as well as the density of the Lee-Yang zeros originate from chaotic behavior of the dynamics, while normal behavior is linked to absence of zeros and hence the existence of efficient approximation algorithms . Our work falls into the broader context of showing how zeros in the complex plane actually relate to the existence and design of approximation algorithms.\nThis connection has been well studied for general graphs, see, e.g., 9 7 4; for bounded-degree graphs, the picture is less clear, but the key seems to lie in understanding the underlying complex dynamical systems   0   [ref]7.\nA general theory is so far elusive, but it seems that the chaotic behavior of the underlying complex dynamical system is linked to the presence of zeros of the partition function and to the #​𝖯#𝖯\\mathsf{\\#P}-hardness of approximation. Establishing hardness results for ferromagnetic spin systems is notoriously challenging  3, we therefore expect our techniques to be applicable in a wider framework.\nWe will explain in Section 2 the obstacles that arise relative to previous works for antiferromagnetic spin systems."
