    "ii-b sag-free simulation": "To achieve sag-free simulations (or equivalently, static equilibrium), one common approach is to enforce zero net forces in the dynamical system. Hadap  proposed using inverse dynamics to solve nonlinear force equations for reduced multibody systems, although such methods may not necessarily be applicable to maximal coordinate systems. To solve nonlinear force equations, the Asymptotic Numerical Method (ANM) was employed, achieving faster convergence compared to Newton-type optimizers  8, although it remains unclear how to incorporate box constraints, which help prevent stability problems and violations of physical laws. Curvature-based solvers have also been employed, since they need fewer DOFs to represent elastic rod dynamics. Derouet-Jourdan et al.  presented a method for achieving static equilibrium of curvature-based elastic strands  and extended their work with frictional contacts . The curvature-based formulations have extensively been used for inverse problems to model, design, and fabricate elastic rods    . To achieve static equilibrium in more general contexts, Twigg and Kačić-Alesić proposed minimizing the force norm by optimizing rest shape parameters in mass-spring systems consisting of one-dimensional elements . Takahashi and Batty extended their approach to DER [ref]5, in work closely related to ours. We clarify key differences in Sec II-C. Rest shape optimization has also been applied to two-dimensional sheet-like structures  and three-dimensional deformable volumes  . To enforce zero-net-force constraints, adjoint methods have been extensively used   2. While these methods are efficient, their implementation tends to be significantly more complicated because they involve Hessians of objective terms due to differentiation of the nonlinear force constraints. Given that DER Hessian treatments are the subject of ongoing study 2 3, we formulate our problem without explicitly incorporating the Hessian into the parameter optimization. While finite differences could bypass this complexity 9, they are known to be significantly slower than optimization with analytical gradients. As an alternative, Hsu et al.   proposed a global-local initialization method that first computes global forces to achieve static equilibrium and then adjusts local elements to generate such forces. However, this approach would require excessive stiffening of materials and is applicable only to simulation approaches where local force elements can exclusively be defined. As such, the global-local initialization is not applicable to DER, as discussed by Takahashi and Batty [ref]5."
