  "sections": {
    "introduction": "Good data and computation abstractions catch the intrinsic properties of computing and hence play an essential role. The earliest computation models, such as Turing machine¬†, Game of Life¬†, Langton‚Äôs ant¬†, and lambda calculus¬†, are typical example. These models have equivalent abilities in representing all computations. Unfortunately, these models only assure feasibility in computation representation and fail to provide primitive operators to program complex algorithms. Keeping performance concerns in mind, the researchers present several computation models and corresponding languages providing operators for specific domains, such as relation algebra¬†, SQL¬†[ref]6 for database, and MATLANG¬†[ref]7 for scientific computation. Besides them, there are also implicit models and operators provided by the libraries or computation engines like TensorFlow¬†[ref]8 and PyTorch¬† for deep learning. Their intuition is to define atomic computations, offer language with operators that are compositions of one or more atomic computations, and implement every operator to ensure the best performance on major computation tasks. However, these models or corresponding operators are confronted with two major problems. First, they are designed for a relatively small domain. For example, relation algebra is only suitable for structured data. As a result, they remain low compatibility and high portability cost issues when extending those models to support emerging computing. Second, they have poor generalized expression ability. The generalized expression ability depicts the ability to represent newly-added computations on the existing computation model. If users want to implement new computations in a particular model with poor generalized expression ability, they must implement new operators case by case. As a result, there are more and more newly-defined complicated operators with different semantics. To attack the above challenges, this article proposes a unified computation model with the generalized expression ability and a concise set of primitive operators. First, we propose a unified data abstraction ‚Äì Tensor of List. Tensor of List is a data abstraction with generalized expression ability, and classical data abstractions like vector, matrix, tensor, and list, can be seen as its particular instances. Based on Tensor of List, we present a unified computation model. The proposed computation model introduces five atomic computations. The five atomic computations can represent any elementary computation on the ToL data abstraction by finite composition, ensured with strict formal proof. We call the Tensor of List data abstraction and the corresponding computation abstraction the ToL model (In short, ToL). In the rest of this article, ToL refers to the ToL data abstraction or the ToL model in different contexts. Based on ToL, we design a pure-functional language ‚Äì ToLang, which provides a concise set of primitive operators that can be used to program complex big data and AI algorithms. We focus on four aspects to evaluate how our computation model solves the problems. Table¬†1 is the overall comparison of different models/languages. As for the applicable domain, ToL suits all domains and provides three levels of generalized expression ability: data abstraction, a limited composition of the five atomic computations that can represent any ToL elementary computation, and a concise set of primitive operators. As for conciseness, we show a smaller set of primitive operators in ToLang can present a large set of ONNX¬†0 operators in the AI domain. Finally, as for performance concerns, we show ToL has a built-in performance indicator, born with a strictly defined computation metric ‚Äì elementary operation count (EOPs), consistent with FLOPs¬†1 within a small error range. The organization of this article is as follows. Section 2 is the related work. We make all the necessary definitions for ToL data and computation abstractions in Sections 3.1-3.3. We present strict proof for ToL‚Äôs completeness and atomicity properties in Section 3.4. We present ToLang in Section 4. We evaluate ToLang‚Äôs expression ability in Section 5. We demonstrate ToL‚Äôs built-in performance indicator in Section 6. Section 7 is the conclusion."
