  "sections": {
    "single-agent rl": "For the single-agent case, recent work by Choi et al.  (2021) applied RL to the problem of navigating a robot to a goal while avoiding dynamic obstacles. Their problem is similar to the single-agent agent version of our problem, where the goal in our case is a parking space and their robot is a car in our case. Their approach trains an RL algorithm inside simulations using the Stage111http://playerstage.sourceforge.net and Gazebo  simulators, and uses lidar sensors around the robot as information of nearby obstacles to avoid them. They harness the PPO [ref]22 algorithm to successfully learn a model that controls the robot to avoid the obstacles in real-time. PPO is a highly performant modern deep RL algorithm that uses policy-gradient and actor-critic methods to learn high-performing models in record time and with minimal hyper-parameter tuning. Currently, PPO is one of the most commonly used RL algorithms in practise due to its scalability, data-efficiency and robustness. Choi et al.  transferred their model into the real-world and found that their robot avoided real obstacles without fault. Another recent work by Thunyapoo et al.  (2020) applies RL to essentially the single-agent version of our problem, where a single car parks itself in a static environment of moderate complexity. Their approach uses the Unity3D engine to simulate a car park, with a single moving car in the environment as the agent and other stationary (static) parked cars as obstacles. They too successfully apply PPO to learn models that park cars in their environment with more than a 95%percent9595\\% success rate, with varying configurations and parking zones. A more primitive work can be seen by Lai  (2018), whom applies Q-Learning  to a single-agent car parking scenario. While successful, the parking space in their simulation remains fixed, and Q-Learning essentially over-fits to the specific configuration of their environment rather than using sensor data to dynamically avoid obstacles, making the work slightly unrealistic. However, the study formulates the motion of a car in a discrete manner appropriate for the application of Q-Learning, which may be useful to harness when modelling our environment in a discrete manner."
