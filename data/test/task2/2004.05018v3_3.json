    "mim-width of special graph classes": "Belmonte and Vatshelle  proved that the mim-width of the following graph classes is bounded and quickly computable:\npermutation graphs, convex graphs\nand their complements,\ninterval graphs\nand their complements,\ncircular k𝑘k-trapezoid graphs, circular permutation graphs, Dilworth-k𝑘k graphs, k𝑘k-polygon graphs, circular-arc graphs and complements of d𝑑d-degenerate graphs. Some of the results of  have been extended.\nLet Kr⊟Kr⊟subscript𝐾𝑟subscript𝐾𝑟K_{r}\\boxminus K_{r} be the graph obtained from 2​Kr2subscript𝐾𝑟2K_{r} by adding a perfect matching, and let Kr⊟r​P1⊟subscript𝐾𝑟𝑟subscript𝑃1K_{r}\\boxminus rP_{1} be the graph obtained from Kr⊟Kr⊟subscript𝐾𝑟subscript𝐾𝑟K_{r}\\boxminus K_{r} by removing all the edges in one of the complete graphs (see Section 2 for undefined notation).\nKang et al.  showed that for any integer r≥2𝑟2r\\geq 2,\nthere is a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a branch decomposition of mim-width at most r−1𝑟1r-1 when the input is restricted to\n(Kr⊟r​P1)⊟subscript𝐾𝑟𝑟subscript𝑃1(K_{r}\\boxminus rP_{1})-free chordal graphs, which generalize interval graphs, or (Kr⊟Kr)⊟subscript𝐾𝑟subscript𝐾𝑟(K_{r}\\boxminus K_{r})-free co-comparability graphs, which generalize permutation graphs. Hence, in particular, all these classes have bounded mim-width. Kang et al.  also proved that the classes of chordal graphs, circle graphs and co-comparability graphs have unbounded mim-width; for the latter two classes, this was shown independently by Mengel .\nVatshelle  and Brault-Baron et al. 1 showed the same for grids and chordal bipartite graphs, respectively, whereas Mengel  proved that strongly chordal split graphs have unbounded mim-width. Brettell et al. 2 showed that the mim-width of (Kr,s​P1+P5)subscript𝐾𝑟𝑠subscript𝑃1subscript𝑃5(K_{r},sP_{1}+P_{5})-free graphs is bounded and quickly computable for every r≥1𝑟1r\\geq 1 and s≥0𝑠0s\\geq 0. In particular, this yielded an alternative proof for showing that List k𝑘k-Colouring is polynomially solvable for (s​P1+P5)𝑠subscript𝑃1subscript𝑃5(sP_{1}+P_{5})-free graphs for all k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1 and s≥0𝑠0s\\geq 0 [ref]20. Let K1,s1superscriptsubscript𝐾1𝑠1K_{1,s}^{1} be the graph obtained from the (s+1)𝑠1(s+1)-vertex star K1,ssubscript𝐾1𝑠K_{1,s} after subdividing each edge once; note that s​P1+P5𝑠subscript𝑃1subscript𝑃5sP_{1}+P_{5} is an induced subgraph of K1,s+21superscriptsubscript𝐾1𝑠21K_{1,s+2}^{1}. In 3, the result of 2 on the mim-width of (Kr,s​P1+P5)subscript𝐾𝑟𝑠subscript𝑃1subscript𝑃5(K_{r},sP_{1}+P_{5})-free graphs was generalized to (Kr,K1,s1,Pt)subscript𝐾𝑟superscriptsubscript𝐾1𝑠1subscript𝑃𝑡(K_{r},K_{1,s}^{1},P_{t})-free graphs. As a consequence, for all k≥3𝑘3k\\geq 3, s≥1𝑠1s\\geq 1 and t≥1𝑡1t\\geq 1, List k𝑘k-Colouring is polynomial-time solvable even for\n(K1,s1,Pt)superscriptsubscript𝐾1𝑠1subscript𝑃𝑡(K_{1,s}^{1},P_{t})-free graphs; previously this was shown for k=3𝑘3k=3 by Chudnovsky et al. 8. Brettell et al. 4 considered the following generalisation of convex graphs. A bipartite graph G=(A,B,E)𝐺𝐴𝐵𝐸G=(A,B,E) is ℋℋ{\\cal H}-convex, for some family of graphs ℋℋ{\\cal H}, if there exists a graph H∈ℋ𝐻ℋH\\in{\\cal H} with V​(H)=A𝑉𝐻𝐴V(H)=A such that the set of neighbours in A𝐴A of each b∈B𝑏𝐵b\\in B induces a connected subgraph of H𝐻H (when ℋℋ{\\mathcal{H}} is the set of paths, we obtain exactly convex graphs). They showed that the class of ℋℋ{\\mathcal{H}}-convex graphs has bounded and quickly computable mim-width if ℋℋ{\\mathcal{H}} is the set of cycles, or ℋℋ{\\mathcal{H}} is the set of trees with bounded maximum degree and bounded number of vertices of degree at least 333."
