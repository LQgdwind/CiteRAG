    "theta bodies for combinatorial ideals": "One of the core problems in optimization is to understand the conv​(S)conv𝑆\\texttt{conv}(S) or a relaxation of conv​(S)conv𝑆\\texttt{conv}(S), where S𝑆S the set of feasible solutions to a given problem and conv​(S)conv𝑆\\texttt{conv}(S) denotes the convex hull of S𝑆S. For the CSPs, an instance 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) can be associated with an ideal I​(𝒫)=⟨f1,…,fs⟩I𝒫subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑠\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P})=\\left\\langle f_{1},\\ldots,f_{s}\\right\\rangle and the Sol​(𝒫)=V​(I​(𝒫))Sol𝒫VI𝒫\\textsf{Sol}(\\mathcal{P})={\\textbf{V}}\\left(\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P})\\right) is a finite subset of ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}. Hence, in this setting we are interested in computing conv​(V​(I​(𝒫)))convVI𝒫\\texttt{conv}({\\textbf{V}}\\left(\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P})\\right)). This is cut out by the inequalities f​(𝐱)≥0𝑓𝐱0f(\\mathbf{x})\\geq 0 as f𝑓f runs over all linear polynomials that are nonnegative over V​(I​(𝒫))VI𝒫{\\textbf{V}}\\left(\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P})\\right). Thus, a natural relaxation for conv​(V​(I​(𝒫)))convVI𝒫\\texttt{conv}({\\textbf{V}}\\left(\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P})\\right)) is 555Note that, in general, for an ideal I∈ℝ​[X]Iℝdelimited-[]𝑋\\emph{{I}}\\in\\mathbb{R}[X] the convex hull of V​(I)VI{\\textbf{V}}\\left(\\emph{{I}}\\right) may not be closed. Hence, (18) is a relaxation for the closure of conv​(V​(I))convVI\\texttt{conv}({\\textbf{V}}\\left(\\emph{{I}}\\right)), denoted by c​l​(conv​(V​(I)))𝑐𝑙convVIcl(\\texttt{conv}({\\textbf{V}}\\left(\\emph{{I}}\\right))). Here, closure of the convex hull of a set C𝐶C means the intersection of the closed halfspaces containing C𝐶C. Here we wish to provide a systematic approach using the algebraic property of the solution sets and our results on the IMP and χ𝜒\\chiIMP to compute/approximate conv​(Sol​(𝒫))convSol𝒫\\texttt{conv}(\\textsf{Sol}(\\mathcal{P})). We follow the notion of theta bodies introduced and advanced by Gouveia, Parrilo and Thomas . Throughout this section we work with 𝔽=ℝ𝔽ℝ\\mathbb{F}=\\mathbb{R}. Some definitions are in order. Let I be an ideal in ℝ​[X]ℝdelimited-[]𝑋\\mathbb{R}[X]. A polynomial f∈ℝ​[X]𝑓ℝdelimited-[]𝑋f\\in\\mathbb{R}[X] is called k𝑘k-SOS mod I if there exist s1,…,st∈ℝ​[X]ksubscript𝑠1…subscript𝑠𝑡ℝsubscriptdelimited-[]𝑋𝑘s_{1},\\ldots,s_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}[X]_{k} such that f−∑i=1tsi2∈I𝑓superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑠𝑖2If-\\sum_{i=1}^{t}s_{i}^{2}\\in\\emph{{I}}. The ideal I is called k𝑘k-SOS if every nonnegative polynomial on V​(I)VI{\\textbf{V}}\\left(\\emph{{I}}\\right) is k𝑘k-SOS mod I. If every degree d𝑑d nonnegative polynomial on V​(I)VI{\\textbf{V}}\\left(\\emph{{I}}\\right) is k𝑘k-SOS mod I we say I is (d,k)𝑑𝑘(d,k)-SOS. Lovász [ref]40 asked the following question: Which ideals in ℝ​[X]ℝdelimited-[]𝑋\\mathbb{R}[X] are (1,1)11(1,1)-SOS? How about (1,k)1𝑘(1,k)-SOS?. We propose a restricted version of this question for vanishing ideals of constraint languages. Formally, we say a language ΓΓ\\Gamma is (d,k)𝑑𝑘(d,k)-SOS if for every instance 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) the corresponding ideal I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}) is (d,k)𝑑𝑘(d,k)-SOS. An analogue of Lovász’s question for constraint languages is, Which languages are (1,1)11(1,1)-SOS? How about (1,k)1𝑘(1,k)-SOS? Gouveia, Parrilo and Thomas  quite elegantly present an equivalent geometric notion to an ideal being (1,k)1𝑘(1,k)-SOS. For a positive integer k𝑘k, the k𝑘k-th theta body of an ideal I∈ℝ​[X]Iℝdelimited-[]𝑋\\emph{{I}}\\in\\mathbb{R}[X] is Observe that, by definition, T​H1​(I)⊇T​H2​(I)⊇⋯⊇conv​(V​(I))superset-of-or-equals𝑇subscript𝐻1I𝑇subscript𝐻2Isuperset-of-or-equals⋯superset-of-or-equalsconvVITH_{1}(\\emph{{I}})\\supseteq TH_{2}(\\emph{{I}})\\supseteq\\dots\\supseteq\\texttt{conv}({\\textbf{V}}\\left(\\emph{{I}}\\right)). We say a combinatorial ideal is T​Hk𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘TH_{k}-exact if T​Hk​(I)=conv​(V​(I))𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘IconvVITH_{k}(\\emph{{I}})=\\texttt{conv}({\\textbf{V}}\\left(\\emph{{I}}\\right))666In , an ideal in ℝ​[X]ℝdelimited-[]𝑋\\mathbb{R}[X] is called T​Hk𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘TH_{k}-exact if T​Hk​(I)=c​l​(conv​(V​(I)))𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘I𝑐𝑙convVITH_{k}(\\emph{{I}})=cl(\\texttt{conv}({\\textbf{V}}\\left(\\emph{{I}}\\right))). In general, conv​(V​(I))convVI\\texttt{conv}({\\textbf{V}}\\left(\\emph{{I}}\\right)) may not be closed while the theta bodies are. Therefore, the theta body sequence of I can converge, if at all, only to c​l​(conv​(V​(I)))𝑐𝑙convVIcl(\\texttt{conv}({\\textbf{V}}\\left(\\emph{{I}}\\right))). . Zero-dimensional ideals are T​Hk𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘TH_{k}-exact for some finite k𝑘k . We say a language ΓΓ\\Gamma is T​Hk𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘TH_{k}-exact if for any instance 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) the ideal I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}) is T​Hk𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘TH_{k}-exact. An intriguing question is characterizing T​Hk𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘TH_{k}-exact languages, for constant k𝑘k. Which languages are T​Hk𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘TH_{k}-exact, for some constant k𝑘k? Gouveia, Parrilo and Thomas  proved that a radial ideal is T​Hk𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘TH_{k}-exact if and only if it is (1,k)1𝑘(1,k)-SOS. They have also provided an answer to Problem 8.2 characterizing finite sets S⊂ℝn𝑆superscriptℝ𝑛S\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n} that are (1,1)11(1,1)-SOS (see Theorem 4.2 in ). Although the results of  provide a characterization of T​Hk𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘TH_{k}-exact ideal, they do little to the computational side of theta bodies. Theta bodies provide a set of relaxations of solution sets and helps to formulate many combinatorial problems as optimizing a (linear) polynomial over theta bodies which could lead to a better understanding of approximability of many combinatorial problems in a unified way. In order to use theta bodies in this way, we need a method of efficiently ‘construct’ a theta body.\nOne way to describe the k𝑘k-th theta body of I is in terms of the so called combinatorial moment matrices which are matrices indexed by a basis of ℬksubscriptℬ𝑘\\mathcal{B}_{k} . Let us elaborate on this via an example, see   for further details. First we explain the construction of combinatorial moment matrices and then discuss how we can use them to describe theta bodies for the Clique problem. We may assume ℬ={𝐱α∣𝐱α∉⟨LT​(I)⟩}ℬconditional-setsuperscript𝐱𝛼superscript𝐱𝛼delimited-⟨⟩LTI\\mathcal{B}=\\{\\mathbf{x}^{\\alpha}\\mid\\mathbf{x}^{\\alpha}\\not\\in\\left\\langle\\textnormal{LT}(\\emph{{I}})\\right\\rangle\\} and ℬk={𝐱α∣|α|≤k,𝐱α∉⟨LT​(I)⟩}subscriptℬ𝑘conditional-setsuperscript𝐱𝛼formulae-sequence𝛼𝑘superscript𝐱𝛼delimited-⟨⟩LTI\\mathcal{B}_{k}=\\{\\mathbf{x}^{\\alpha}\\mid|\\alpha|\\leq k,\\mathbf{x}^{\\alpha}\\not\\in\\left\\langle\\textnormal{LT}(\\emph{{I}})\\right\\rangle\\} are vectors with their elements listed in increasing grlex order. Hence, any polynomial modulo I is 𝐜⋅ℬ⋅𝐜ℬ\\mathbf{c}\\cdot\\mathcal{B} with 𝐜∈ℝ|ℬ|𝐜superscriptℝℬ\\mathbf{c}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{B}|}. Now, let 𝐲=(y1,…,ym)∈ℝ|ℬ2​k|𝐲subscript𝑦1…subscript𝑦𝑚superscriptℝsubscriptℬ2𝑘\\mathbf{y}=(y_{1},\\dots,y_{m})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{B}_{2k}|} and define Mℬk​(𝐲)subscript𝑀subscriptℬ𝑘𝐲M_{\\mathcal{B}_{k}}(\\mathbf{y}) to be the matrix indexed by ℬksubscriptℬ𝑘\\mathcal{B}_{k} whose (𝐱αi,𝐱αj)superscript𝐱subscript𝛼𝑖superscript𝐱subscript𝛼𝑗(\\mathbf{x}^{\\alpha_{i}},\\mathbf{x}^{\\alpha_{j}}) entry is 𝐜⋅𝐲⋅𝐜𝐲\\mathbf{c}\\cdot\\mathbf{y} where 𝐜∈ℝ|ℬ2​k|𝐜superscriptℝsubscriptℬ2𝑘\\mathbf{c}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{B}_{2k}|} is so that The matrix Mℬk​(𝐲)subscript𝑀subscriptℬ𝑘𝐲M_{\\mathcal{B}_{k}}(\\mathbf{y}) is known as the k𝑘k-th truncated combinatorial moment matrix. Having Mℬksubscript𝑀subscriptℬ𝑘M_{\\mathcal{B}_{k}}, we define the following We now explain this construction using the Clique problem. Let G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) be a graph with vertex set V={x1,…,xn}𝑉subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛V=\\{x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}\\} and edge set E𝐸E. A clique in G𝐺G is a set of vertices U𝑈U such that for all xi,xj∈Usubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗𝑈x_{i},x_{j}\\in U, xi​xj∈Esubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗𝐸x_{i}x_{j}\\in E. The corresponding ideal is For a subset U⊆V𝑈𝑉U\\subseteq V let 𝐱U=∏xi∈Uxisuperscript𝐱𝑈subscriptproductsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑈subscript𝑥𝑖\\mathbf{x}^{U}=\\prod_{x_{i}\\in U}x_{i}. From definition of I, it is clear that ℬ={𝐱U∣U​ is a clique in ​G}ℬconditional-setsuperscript𝐱𝑈𝑈 is a clique in 𝐺\\mathcal{B}=\\{\\mathbf{x}^{U}\\mid U\\text{ is a clique in }G\\}. In particular, ℬ1={1,x1,…,xn}subscriptℬ11subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\mathcal{B}_{1}=\\{1,x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}\\}. Denote by y0,y1,…,ynsubscript𝑦0subscript𝑦1…subscript𝑦𝑛y_{0},y_{1},\\dots,y_{n} the first n+1𝑛1n+1 coordinates of 𝐲∈ℝ|ℬ2​k|𝐲superscriptℝsubscriptℬ2𝑘\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{B}_{2k}|}. Then the k𝑘k-th theta body of I is described as Equivalently, in a more intuitive way, we can describe the k𝑘k-th theta body as follows too. Another way to compute a representation of theta bodies is to work with the truncated quadratic module. The quadratic module of I is and the k𝑘k-th truncation of ℳ​(I)ℳI\\mathcal{M}(\\emph{{I}}) is Both ℳ​(I)ℳI\\mathcal{M}(\\emph{{I}}) and ℳk​(I)subscriptℳ𝑘I\\mathcal{M}_{k}(\\emph{{I}}) are cones in the ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}-vector space ℝ​[X]/Iℝdelimited-[]𝑋𝐼\\mathbb{R}[X]/I. Recall that ℝ​[X]/Iℝdelimited-[]𝑋𝐼\\mathbb{R}[X]/I as a ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}-vector space is isomorphic to Span​(𝐱α∣𝐱α∉⟨LT​(I)⟩)Spanconditionalsuperscript𝐱𝛼superscript𝐱𝛼delimited-⟨⟩LTI\\texttt{Span}(\\mathbf{x}^{\\alpha}\\mid\\mathbf{x}^{\\alpha}\\not\\in\\left\\langle\\textnormal{LT}(\\emph{{I}})\\right\\rangle). Hence, having a monomial basis ℬ={𝐱α∣𝐱α∉⟨LT​(I)⟩}ℬconditional-setsuperscript𝐱𝛼superscript𝐱𝛼delimited-⟨⟩LTI\\mathcal{B}=\\{\\mathbf{x}^{\\alpha}\\mid\\mathbf{x}^{\\alpha}\\not\\in\\left\\langle\\textnormal{LT}(\\emph{{I}})\\right\\rangle\\} or ℬk={𝐱α∣|α|≤k,𝐱α∉⟨LT​(I)⟩}subscriptℬ𝑘conditional-setsuperscript𝐱𝛼formulae-sequence𝛼𝑘superscript𝐱𝛼delimited-⟨⟩LTI\\mathcal{B}_{k}=\\{\\mathbf{x}^{\\alpha}\\mid|\\alpha|\\leq k,\\mathbf{x}^{\\alpha}\\not\\in\\left\\langle\\textnormal{LT}(\\emph{{I}})\\right\\rangle\\} would lead to an efficient computation of sum-of-squares in ℝ​[X]/Iℝdelimited-[]𝑋𝐼\\mathbb{R}[X]/I . If the ideals arising from the combinatorial problem are produced through instance of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) for some language ΓΓ\\Gamma, our methods make it possible to efficiently compute a representation of the corresponding theta body of one of the types described above. We say the class of k𝑘k-th theta bodies arising from instances of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma), denoted by T​Hk​(Γ)𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘ΓTH_{k}(\\Gamma), is efficiently computable if for any instance 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) a representation of the k𝑘k-th theta body T​Hk​(I​(𝒫))𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘I𝒫TH_{k}(\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P})) can be constructed in polynomial time. Therefore, we propose the following research problem. For which languages ΓΓ\\Gamma the k𝑘k-th theta body T​Hk​(I​(𝒫))𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘I𝒫TH_{k}(\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P})) is computable in polynomial time where 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} is an instance of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma)? Our results on χ𝜒\\chiIMP imply that a monomial basis ℬksubscriptℬ𝑘\\mathcal{B}_{k} as well as a k𝑘k-truncated Gröbner Basis can be computed in polynomial time. This together with our result on the bit complexity of SOS proofs obtain the following. Let ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} be a class of ideals for which χ​IMPd𝜒subscriptIMP𝑑\\chi\\textsc{IMP}_{d} is polynomial time decidable. Then there exists a polynomial time algorithm that constructs the d𝑑d-th theta body of an ideal I∈ℋIℋ\\emph{{I}}\\in\\mathcal{H}. Let I be an ideal in ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}. By Theorem 6.9 we can construct the d𝑑d-truncated Gröbner Basis as well as ℬdsubscriptℬ𝑑\\mathcal{B}_{d}. This together with the result of Laurent  leads to a polynomial time algorithm to compute the d𝑑d-th theta body of I.\n∎ Using the reductions from Theorems 6.4 and 6.10 we obtain the following results. Let ΓΓ\\Gamma and ΔΔ\\Delta be constraint languages on (possibly different) sets D𝐷D, E𝐸E, respectively. Suppose there exists a polynomial time algorithm that solves the search version of χ​IMPk​(Γ)𝜒subscriptIMP𝑘Γ\\chi\\textsc{IMP}_{k}(\\Gamma). Then, O​(k)𝑂𝑘O(k)-th theta body for language ΔΔ\\Delta can be constructed in polynomial time if D=E𝐷𝐸D=E and ΓΓ\\Gamma pp-defines ΔΔ\\Delta, or ΓΓ\\Gamma pp-interprets ΔΔ\\Delta. Let ΓΓ\\Gamma be a finite constraint language over domain D𝐷D. For constant k𝑘k and an instance 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) the k𝑘k-th theta body of I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}), T​Hk​(I​(𝒫))𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘I𝒫TH_{k}(\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P})), can be computed in polynomial time if ΓΓ\\Gamma has a semilattice polymorphism, or ΓΓ\\Gamma has the dual-discriminator polymorphism, or ΓΓ\\Gamma is expressed as a system of linear equations over 𝖦𝖥​(p)𝖦𝖥𝑝\\mathsf{GF}(p), p𝑝p prime. Our results yield efficient construction of theta bodies for many well-studied combinatorial problems. Note that, in this case, Theorem 7.4 guarantees low bit complexity of the coefficients in SOS proofs which leads to a polynomial time execution of the Ellipsoid method. As a result optimizing a linear polynomial over such theta bodies is guaranteed to be polynomial time using the Ellipsoid method. In what follows we provide examples of well-studied problems for which the objective is optimizing a linear polynomial over integer points and (re)discover multiple positive results on computation of theta bodies. We point out there are only a handful of specific problems for which theta bodies are known to be efficiently computed. Let G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) be an undirected graph with vertex set V={x1,…,xn}𝑉subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛V=\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\} and edge set E𝐸E. A stable set (a.k.a independent set) in G𝐺G is a set of vertices U𝑈U such that for all xi​xj∈Usubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗𝑈x_{i}x_{j}\\in U, xi​xj∉Esubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗𝐸x_{i}x_{j}\\not\\in E. The Maximum Stable Set problem seeks a stable set of largest cardinality in G𝐺G. This can be seen as an optimization problem over language Γ={(0,0),(0,1),(1,0)}Γ000110\\Gamma=\\{(0,0),(0,1),(1,0)\\}. More precisely, the objective is maximizing ∑ixisubscript𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖\\sum_{i}x_{i} subject to (xi​xj)∈Γsubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗Γ(x_{i}x_{j})\\in\\Gamma, for all xi​xj∈Esubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗𝐸x_{i}x_{j}\\in E. One can observe that ΓΓ\\Gamma admits the semilattice polymorphism Min and hence by Corollary 8.8 the k𝑘k-th theta body of the corresponding ideal to this problem, T​Hk​(G)𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘𝐺TH_{k}(G), can be constructed in polynomial time. We point out that, for this problem, it is known that the 111-st theta body provides a convex relaxation for the (characteristic vectors) of all stable sets in G𝐺G . Therefore, the problem max𝐱∈T​H1​(G)​∑xisubscript𝐱𝑇subscript𝐻1𝐺subscript𝑥𝑖\\max\\limits_{\\mathbf{x}\\in TH_{1}(G)}\\sum x_{i} is a SDP which can be solved to arbitrary precision in polynomial time in the size of G𝐺G. The optimal value of this SDP provides an upper bound on the size of a maximum stable set. Let ℳ=(E,𝒞)ℳ𝐸𝒞\\mathcal{M}=(E,\\mathcal{C}) be a binary matroid where E𝐸E is called the ground set and 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is a collection of subsets of E𝐸E that is closed under taking symmetric differences. Each member of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is called a cycle. (Often members of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} are called independent sets, however, here we call them cycles to avoid confusion.) One can view the binary matroid ℳ=(E,𝒞)ℳ𝐸𝒞\\mathcal{M}=(E,\\mathcal{C}) as the 𝖦𝖥​(2)𝖦𝖥2\\mathsf{GF}(2)-vector subspaces of 𝖦𝖥​(2)E𝖦𝖥superscript2𝐸\\mathsf{GF}(2)^{E}. Let 𝟏F∈{0,1}Esubscript1𝐹superscript01𝐸\\mathbf{1}_{F}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{E} denote the characteristic vector of F⊆E𝐹𝐸F\\subseteq E, thus the cycles of the binary matroid ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} arise as the solutions in 𝖦𝖥​(2)E𝖦𝖥superscript2𝐸\\mathsf{GF}(2)^{E} of a linear system M​𝐱=0𝑀𝐱0M\\mathbf{x}=0, where M𝑀M is a matrix with columns indexed by E𝐸E. The convex hull of the vectors 𝟏Fsubscript1𝐹\\mathbf{1}_{F}, F∈𝒞𝐹𝒞F\\in\\mathcal{C}, is called the matroid polytope or cycle polytope. Let I​(ℳ)⊆ℝ​[xi∣i∈E]Iℳℝdelimited-[]conditionalsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑖𝐸\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{M})\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}[x_{i}\\mid i\\in E] be the vanishing ideal of the cycle vectors of ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}. Our result in Theorem 6.10 implies the following theorem. The set ℬk={𝐱α∣|α|≤k,𝐱α∉⟨LT​(I​(ℳ))⟩}subscriptℬ𝑘conditional-setsuperscript𝐱𝛼formulae-sequence𝛼𝑘superscript𝐱𝛼delimited-⟨⟩LTIℳ\\mathcal{B}_{k}=\\{\\mathbf{x}^{\\alpha}\\mid|\\alpha|\\leq k,\\mathbf{x}^{\\alpha}\\not\\in\\left\\langle\\textnormal{LT}(\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{M}))\\right\\rangle\\}, and the k𝑘k-truncated Gröbner Basis of the ideal I​(ℳ)Iℳ\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{M}) can be computed in polynomial time. This result has numerous consequences including a polynomial time algorithm to construct T​Hk​(I​(ℳ))𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘IℳTH_{k}(\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{M})). This in turn can be viewed as computing the moment matrices for the cycle ideal I​(ℳ)Iℳ\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{M}). One classical and well studied application is cut function of graphs. When ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} is the cut polytope then T​Hk​(I​(ℳ))𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘IℳTH_{k}(\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{M})) provides a relaxation for the cut polytope. In particular, T​H1​(I​(ℳ))𝑇subscript𝐻1IℳTH_{1}(\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{M})) coincides with the edge-relaxation considered by Rendl and Wiegele  and numerical experiments there indicates that it is often tighter than the Goemans-Williamson SDP relaxation . See  for more detailed discussions and applications. Min Ones and Max Ones are Boolean CSP problems where the objective is to find a feasible solution (a 0-1 assignment satisfying all constraints) minimizing/maximizing the number of variables assigned the label 111 . Classical examples are the Minimum Vertex Cover, the Maximum Stable Set, and many packing and covering problems . In almost all the cases where Boolean CSP is polynomial time decidable our results imply that we can construct theta bodies as relaxations of the solution space. This motivates the question of studying the power of the theta body relaxations in designing approximation algorithms for this class of problems. In the Maximum Stable Set problem we have a linear cost function defined over homomorphisms from graph G𝐺G to the graph H=(V={0,1},E={(0,0),(0,1),(1,0)})𝐻formulae-sequence𝑉01𝐸000110H=(V=\\{0,1\\},E=\\{(0,0),(0,1),(1,0)\\}). However, one can consider a more general setting as follows. Let H=(V,E)𝐻𝑉𝐸H=(V,E) with V​(H)={0,1,…,d}𝑉𝐻01…𝑑V(H)=\\{0,1,\\ldots,d\\} be a fixed digraph and G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) with V​(G)={x1,…,xn}𝑉𝐺subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛V(G)=\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\} be an input digraph. Given a cost function c:V​(G)×V​(H)→ℝ+∪{+∞}:𝑐→𝑉𝐺𝑉𝐻subscriptℝc:V(G)\\times V(H)\\to\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\cup\\{+\\infty\\}, the objective is to find a homomorphism from G𝐺G to H𝐻H with minimum cost which is defined as ∑i∈[n],j∈V​(H)c​(xi,j)subscriptformulae-sequence𝑖delimited-[]𝑛𝑗𝑉𝐻𝑐subscript𝑥𝑖𝑗\\sum_{i\\in[n],j\\in V(H)}c(x_{i},j). This problem is studied under name of Min-Cost H-coloring and many important optimization problems are captured by this specification: Minimum Vertex Cover, Minimum Sum 3-Coloring, Minimum Sum K-Coloring to name a few. Only a few results are known in terms of approximation for this problem in a unified framework  [ref]54. Both of these results are based on rounding a particular LP. Our result implies that we can construct theta bodies for many cases of H𝐻H and have a convex relaxation of all possible homomorphisms. This motivates the question of checking if formulating the Min-Cost H-coloring problem as an optimization problem over theta bodies help to achieve (better) approximation algorithms. A natural generalization of the above problems, both in terms of alphabet and arity of the relations, is the class of Strict CSPs . As usual we have a constraint language ΓΓ\\Gamma on domain D={0,…,d}𝐷0…𝑑D=\\{0,\\dots,d\\}. Given an instance 𝒫=(X,D,C)𝒫𝑋𝐷𝐶\\mathcal{P}=(X,D,C) of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) and a cost function c:X×D→ℝ+∪{+∞}:𝑐→𝑋𝐷subscriptℝc:X\\times D\\to\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\cup\\{+\\infty\\}, the objective is to minimize/maximize ∑xi∈X,j∈Dc​(xi,j)subscriptformulae-sequencesubscript𝑥𝑖𝑋𝑗𝐷𝑐subscript𝑥𝑖𝑗\\sum_{x_{i}\\in X,j\\in D}c(x_{i},j) subject to V​(⟨𝒫⟩)Vdelimited-⟨⟩𝒫{\\textbf{V}}\\left(\\left\\langle\\mathcal{P}\\right\\rangle\\right) i.e., finding a solution to 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} that minimizes/maximises ∑xi∈Xxisubscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑋subscript𝑥𝑖\\sum_{x_{i}\\in X}x_{i}. The approximability of this problem and it special cases have been studied intensively and (Unique Game) hardness results are known . It is tempting to study the power of theta body relaxations for approximation of Strict CSPs as our results imply in many cases a theta body can be constructed in polynomial time."
