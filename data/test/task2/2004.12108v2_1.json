    "literature review": "Distributed systems such as available in healthcare have become vastly complex due to the amalgamation of different technologies such as IoT, edge computing, and cloud computing. Due to these advanced capabilities, a modern system can utilize a myriad of data sources to facilitate improved capabilities towards essential services. The nature of distributed data platforms introduces a plethora of complexities towards preserving user privacy of users without compromising data utility. Extremely high dimensions and massive distribution of data sources are two of the main complexities that need to be addressed when designing robust privacy-preserving approaches for DML systems. Due to these reasons, privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) approaches should be efficient and should be able to work in distributed settings. Approaches based on secure multi-party computation , attribute access control  , lightweight cryptographic procedures  , homomorphic encryption  are few examples for some encryption approach which can provide good privacy. However, the high computational complexity of such encryption scenarios can seriously jeopardize the performance of a distributed ML setup. The inherent high computational complexity of the cryptographic approaches requires excessive amounts of computational resources, which include large storage facilities such as cloud computing that are often controlled by third-parties. Furthermore, the encryption approaches such as homomorphic encryption for PPDM increase the size of the data after the application of encryption, which is not suitable for the domain of big data as the data sizes can already be extensive. Hence, the implementation of cryptographic scenarios for distributed databases can be unrealistic and unaffordable . Compared to encryption, data perturbation/modification provides efficient and lightweight solutions for big data privacy [ref]28, and hence, data perturbation is a better fitting solution for PPDM of distributed data. Previous data perturbation approaches include swapping  , additive perturbation  , condensation , randomized response , microaggregation , random rotation  , random projection  , geometric perturbation , and hybrid perturbation  . Due to the modifications, the data end up with reduced utility. The relationship between utility and privacy granted by a particular perturbation algorithm is defined via a privacy model . More than a few privacy models have been introduced where one model tries to overcome the defects of another. k−a​n​o​n​y​m​i​t​y𝑘𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑦𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑦k-anonymity  0, l−d​i​v​e​r​s​i​t​y𝑙𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦l-diversity 1, t−c​l​o​s​e​n​e​s​s𝑡𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠t-closeness 2, (α,k)−a​n​o​n​y​m​i​t​y𝛼𝑘𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑦𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑦(\\alpha,k)-anonymity 3, kθ−a​f​f​i​n​i​t​ysubscript𝑘𝜃𝑎𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑦k_{\\theta}-affinity 4 are some examples for privacy models. However, these models exhibit vulnerabilities to attacks such as composition attacks 5, minimality attacks  6, and foreground knowledge 7 attacks. Moreover, the perturbation approaches that use these models do not scale for big data with high dimensions. When the dimensions of the input dataset grow, the computational cost necessary to conduct data perturbation grows exponentially. The literature refers to this phenomenon as ”The Dimensionality Curse”  8. Another issue in high dimensional data is the leak of extra information that can be effectively used by attackers to misuse sensitive private information 9. Differential privacy (DP) is another privacy model, which was developed more recently to render a strong privacy guarantee compared to prior approaches. Nevertheless, due to the high noise levels imposed by DP algorithms, DP might not be the optimal choice for big data privacy . The distribution of data sources and infrastructures also introduces a massive complexity towards the development of robust privacy-preserving approaches for distributed databases. Modern distributed privacy-preserving approaches include federated (FedNN) machine learning and split learning (SplitNN), which can provide a certain level of privacy to distributed databases. In FedML, the distributed clients use their local data to train local ML models and communicate the locally trained ML model parameters with the central server to train a global representation of the local models. The server then distributes the global model parameters with the clients so that the clients can now generalize their local models based on the model parameters federated by the server. SplitML has a similar distributed setup. However, instead of communicating the model parameters, SplitML splits the ML model between the clients and the server. During the training process, a client will hold a portion of the ML model, whereas the server will hold the other portion of the ML model. As a result, a client will transfer activations from its split layer to the split layer of the server during both forward and backward passes of the training process of the ML model. When many clients need to connect to the server for ML model training, the clients will either have a peer to peer communication or a client-server communication for the model parameter communications in order for each client to have a synchronous ML model training process. However, both FedML and SplitML have the same problem of the central point of failure as the server in both cases has too much control over the model learning process. If the server is attacked, the whole framework becomes vulnerable, and as a result, user privacy cannot be guaranteed. Especially the attack methods such as membership inference and model memorization can exploit the vulnerabilities of the central point of failure to retrieve raw data used for the model training process. The other distributed approaches which work on horizontally and vertically partitioned data also tend to produce issues towards efficiency or privacy . As most of these methods use the approaches based on homomorphic encryption to provide privacy, such methods become inefficient when working with big data, and the need to share too much information with the server makes most of them untrusted and yields the same issue of the central point of failure . Among data perturbation approaches, matrix multiplicative approaches proved to provide high utility towards data clustering and classification  . Examples for matrix multiplicative perturbation approaches include random rotation, geometric, and projection perturbation [ref]28 methods. For example, random rotation perturbation repeatedly multiplies the input data by a randomly generated matrix with the properties of an orthogonal matrix, until the perturbed data satisfy a pre-anticipated level of privacy  . An additional matrix of translation and distance perturbation are combined with random rotation to produce geometric data perturbation. The added randomness of the random translation matrix improves the privacy of the perturbed data. However, geometric data perturbation also follows the same repeated approach until the perturbed data satisfy an expected level of privacy . Random projection perturbation follows a different approach by projecting the high dimensional input data to a low dimensional space  . One of the important properties of matrix multiplicative data perturbation approaches is their ability to preserve the distance between tuples of the input dataset   . As a result of this property, matrix multiplicative approaches provide high utility for data classification and clustering, which are based on distance calculations. However, due to the inefficient approaches utilized for the optimal perturbation parameter generation, rotation perturbation, geometric perturbation, and projection fail to provide enough scalability. PABIDOT is a recently developed perturbation approach for the privacy preservation of big data classification, using the properties of geometric data perturbations. PABIDOT provides high efficiency towards big data while maintaining high privacy and classification accuracy. However, for distributed healthcare scenarios such as shown in Figure 1, PABIDOT cannot be applied as it is not a distributed algorithm. As shown in Figure 1, a distributed system can be composed of branches that are geographically dispersed. The data coming from each branch should be perturbed before they leave the local network. A distributed data perturbation algorithm which can provide high utility while maintaining high privacy for distributed healthcare is essential."
