    "introduction": "Constraint-satisfaction problems (CSPs) are fundamental in mathematics, physics, and computer science. The Boolean SATisfiability problem (SAT) is a paradigmatic class of CSPs, where each variable takes value from the binary set {True,False}TrueFalse\\{\\texttt{True},\\texttt{False}\\}. Solving SAT efficiently is of utmost significance in computer science, both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. As a special case of SAT, formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNFs) are a conjunction (and-ing) of disjunctions (or-ing) of literals. Despite the NP-completeness of CNF-SAT, there has been dramatic progress on the engineering side of CNF-SAT solvers . SAT solvers can be classified into complete and incomplete ones: a complete SAT solver will return a solution if there exists one or prove unsatisfiability if no solution exists, while an incomplete algorithm is not guaranteed to find a satisfying assignment nor can it prove unsatisfiability. Most modern complete SAT solvers are based on the the Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) algorithm introduced in GRASP , an evolution of the backtracking Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm  . Examples of highly efficient complete SAT solvers include Chaff , MiniSat , PicoSAT , Lingeling , Glucose , and machine learning-enhanced MapleSAT 0. Overall, CDCL-based SAT solvers constitute a huge success for SAT problems, and have been dominating in the research of SAT solving. Discrete local search (DLS) methods are used in incomplete SAT solvers. The number of unsatisfied constraints is often regarded as the objective function. DLS algorithms include greedy local search (GSAT) 1 and random walk GSAT (WSAT) 2.\nSeveral efficient variants of GSAT and WSAT have been proposed, such as NSAT 3, Novelty+ 4, SAPS 5, ProbSAT 6, and CCAnr 7. While practical DLS solvers could be slower than CDCL solvers, they are useful for solving certain classes of instances, e.g., hard random 3-CNF and MaxSAT 1. Continuous local search (CLS) algorithms are much less studied in SAT community, compared with CDCL and DLS methods. In 8, the SAT problem is regarded as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem and is solved by interior point method after relaxing the problem to linear programming (LP). Another work 9 converts SAT into an unconstrained global minimization problem and applies coordinate descent. Those methods, however, are only able to solve relatively easy random CNF instances and fail to provide interesting theoretical guarantees regarding rounding and convergence. Non-CNF constraints are playing important roles in computer science and other engineering areas, e.g., XOR constraints in cryptography 0, as well as Pseudo-Boolean constraints and Not-all-equal (NAE) constraints in discrete optimization 1 2.\nThe combination of different types of constraints enhances the expressive power of Boolean formulas. Nevertheless, compared to that of CNF-SAT solving, efficient SAT solvers that can handle non-CNF constraints are less well studied. There are two main approaches to handle hybrid\nBoolean systems, i.e., instances with non-CNF constraints: 1) CNF encoding and 2) extensions of existing SAT solvers.\nFor the first approach, different encodings differ in size, the ability to detect inconsistencies by unit propagation (arc consistency), and solution density 3.\nIt is generally observed that the running time of SAT solvers relies heavily on the detail of encodings. Finding the best encoding for a solver usually requires considerable testing and comparison 4. In addition, the encodings of different constraints generally do not share extra variables, which increases the number of variables. The second approach often requires different techniques for various types of constraints, e.g., cryptoMiniSAT 5 uses Gaussian Elimination to handle XOR constraints, while Pueblo 6 leverages cutting plane to take care of pseudo-Boolean constraints.\nDespite the efforts of Dixon et a.¬†7 to develop a general satisfiability framework based on group theory, the study of a uniform approach for solving hybrid constraints is far from mature. Recently, an algebraic framework named FourierSAT 8 attempted to address the issues with handling non-CNF constraints, bringing CLS methods back to the view of SAT community. As an algorithmic application of Walsh-Fourier analysis of Boolean functions, FourierSAT transforms Boolean constraints into multilinear polynomials, which are then used to construct the objective function, where a solution is found by applying vector-wise gradient-based local search in the real cube [‚àí1,1]nsuperscript11ùëõ[-1,1]^{n}. In this framework, different constraints are handled uniformly in the sense that they are all treated as polynomials. Compared with the earlier CLS algorithm 9, FourierSAT is able to handle more types of constraints than just random CNF formulas. Moreover, FourierSAT provides interesting theoretical properties of rounding as well as global convergence speed thanks to a better-behaved objective function. In addition, taking advantage of the infrastructure for training neural networks, including software libraries and hardware, to solve discrete problems has become a hot topic recently 9. The gradient descent-based framework of FourierSAT provides the SAT community a possible way of benefiting from machine-learning methods and tools. Though FourierSAT does bring attention back to CLS methods, it still has some limitations. First, as a CLS approach, FourierSAT suffers from inefficient gradient computation. Specifically, computing the gradient of nùëõn coordinates can take O‚Äã(n)ùëÇùëõO(n) function evaluations. Second, the types of constraints accepted by FourierSAT are still somehow limited‚Äîonly constraints with closed-form Walsh-Fourier expansions can be handled. Third, FourierSAT uses random restart when getting stuck in a local optimum, and the information of the previous local optima is not leveraged. Contributions.\nWe point out here that the core of CLS methods for SAT solving is the ability of efficiently evaluating and differentiating (computing the gradient) the objective, independent of the representations we use for Boolean constraints. We show that the evaluation and differentiation problem in the framework of FourierSAT are equivalent with weighted model counting and circuit-output probability. Model counting and circuit-output probability are hard computational problems for general Boolean functions 0. Nevertheless, if a Boolean function can be compactly represented by certain structures, e.g., Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) 1, then those tasks can be done efficiently. As a widely-used representation of Boolean constraints, BDD has applications in synthesis, verification and counting. Thus practical packages for handling BDDs, e.g., CUDD 2 have been developed. Such packages provide sub-function sharing between individual BDDs so that a set of BDDs can be stored compactly. We propose a novel algorithm for computing the gradient of the objective based on belief propagation on BDDs. We prove that by our algorithm, the complexity of computing the gradient is linear in terms of the size of shared BDDs. In fact, computing gradient for nùëõn coordinates is as cheap as evaluating the objective function. We then extend FourierSAT to a more versatile incomplete SAT solver, which we call GradSAT by using a more general data structure, BDDs, rather than the Walsh-Fourier expansions. As interesting families of Boolean functions that have compact BDDs, pseudo-Boolean constraints and symmetric Boolean constraints, including CNF, XOR and cardinality constraints, have abundant applications. We enhance the performance of GradSAT in a variety of ways. We borrow the idea of adaptive weighting form DLS 3 and Discrete Lagrange Method 4 to make use of solving history and search the continuous space more systematically. We also take advantage of a portfolio of continuous optimizers and parallelization. In the experimental section, we aim to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of CLS approaches represented by our tool, GradSAT. On one hand, our method owns nice versatility and can outperform CDCL and DLS solvers on certain problems, showing the power of CLS and hybrid Boolean encodings instead of pure CNF. On the other hand, we observe that on certain benchmarks, e.g., formulas with XORs, CDCL solvers still offer better performance, revealing potential limitations of CLS methods for handling instances with solution-space shattering. We conclude that CLS methods can be a useful complement to strengthen the SAT-solver portfolio. In addition, since local search-based SAT solvers can be naturally used to solve MaxSAT problems 5, we apply GradSAT to many MaxSAT instances and obtain encouraging results."
