  "title": "Smartphone Security Behavioral Scale: A New Psychometric Measurement for Smartphone Security",
  "sections": {
    "related work": "Prior works have examined users’ perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors toward smartphone security. Their findings can be summarized into three realms: the inattentiveness toward security warnings/messages  , the misconceptions of smartphone security   , and low level of smartphone security behavior  . In terms of behavioral measurements, previous studies have assessed users’ smartphone security behaviors via two main approaches: field observation and self-reported measurement. For field observations, most studies focus on two aspects: users’ authentication and locking behaviors on smartphones   , and users’ behaviors on granting access  [ref]62 . Although field observation can probe into users’ actual behaviors in the real world, it usually focuses on a single aspect of the behavior, making it difficult to conveniently gain a comprehensive understanding on users’ behaviors in a short period of time. Therefore, many studies adopt a self-reported approach to measure users’ smartphone security behaviors. There are various means to measure self-reported smartphone security behaviors. The most used approach in prior work is to develop measurements by adapting more general computer security assessments or by modifying a developed measurement from previous studies. For example, Das and Khan  generated a 6-item measure that was adapted from Microsoft’s computing safety index. Jones and Chin  performed a survey study to investigate students’ usage and security behaviors on smartphones by asking seven questions about security practices. A more recent study by Thompson et al.  designed a five item measure to assess smartphone security behavior in a personal context, which was adapted from a security behavioral assessment in personal computer usage by Liang and Xue 8. Another recent (2018) survey study by Verkijika  examined south African users’ smartphone security practices by using five questions that were adapted from the measurement developed by Thompson et al. . While reviewing developed security measurements, we found that there is no standardized and targeted way to measure smartphone security behavior (or behavior intentions) across different contexts. Existing methods are all adopted or adapted from general computer security behavior. However, it is possible that users’ smartphone behaviors can deviate from their computer behaviors. For instance, Chin et al.  found that participants’ behaviors and activities on smartphones were quite different from their use of laptops. For example, users were less likely to purchase and perform sensitive tasks on their smartphones because of security concerns regarding mobile devices. We Identify two key gaps in the current literature: 1) there is no standardized measurement of smartphone security behaviors across contexts; 2) it remains unclear if general computer security behavior measurements is adequate to apply to assess smartphone security behaviors. Thus, a key goal of this study is to develop a standardized and valid measurement of smartphone security behavior intentions that can be used in different contexts. Toward this goal, we ask the following concrete research questions: RQ1: How adequate is the application of general computer security behavior measurement to smartphone security? RQ2: If the application of computer security behavior is not adequate, can we develop a measurement tool which can capture smartphone security behavior intentions?"
