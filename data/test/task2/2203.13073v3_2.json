    "overview of proofs": "Our goal is to obtain regular 0,1010,1 matrices M𝑀M for which the binary rank of M𝑀M is much smaller than the Boolean rank of M¯¯𝑀\\overline{M}.\nWe first observe that a polynomial gap between the two quantities, for a regular matrix, can be derived from a construction of Huang and Sudakov .\nIndeed, it can be verified that the (simple) graphs G𝐺G given in , which satisfy bp(G)=kbp𝐺𝑘\\mathop{\\mathrm{bp}}(G)=k and χ​(G)≥Ω​(k6/5)𝜒𝐺Ωsuperscript𝑘65\\chi(G)\\geq\\Omega(k^{6/5}), are regular, hence their adjacency matrices are regular as well. The following simple claim implies that these adjacency matrices achieve a polynomial gap between the binary rank and the Boolean rank of the complement. For every simple graph G𝐺G, the adjacency matrix M𝑀M of G𝐺G satisfies For a simple graph G𝐺G on the vertex set [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n], put k=bp(G)𝑘bp𝐺k=\\mathop{\\mathrm{bp}}(G), and let (A1,B1),…,(Ak,Bk)subscript𝐴1subscript𝐵1…subscript𝐴𝑘subscript𝐵𝑘(A_{1},B_{1}),\\ldots,(A_{k},B_{k}) be the k𝑘k bipartitions of the k𝑘k edge-disjoint bicliques that form a partition of the edge set of G𝐺G. Observe that for every i∈[k]𝑖delimited-[]𝑘i\\in[k], the sets Ai×Bisubscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖A_{i}\\times B_{i} and Bi×Aisubscript𝐵𝑖subscript𝐴𝑖B_{i}\\times A_{i} form combinatorial rectangles of ones in the adjacency matrix M𝑀M of G𝐺G, and that these 2​k2𝑘2k rectangles form a partition of the ones in M𝑀M, hence rankbin(M)≤2⋅ksubscriptrankbin𝑀⋅2𝑘{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(M)\\leq 2\\cdot k. Next, put m=rank𝔹(M¯)𝑚subscriptrank𝔹¯𝑀m={\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(\\overline{M}), and let A1×B1,…,Am×Bmsubscript𝐴1subscript𝐵1…subscript𝐴𝑚subscript𝐵𝑚A_{1}\\times B_{1},\\ldots,A_{m}\\times B_{m} be m𝑚m combinatorial rectangles that form a cover of the ones in M¯¯𝑀\\overline{M}, i.e., the zeros in M𝑀M. For every i∈[m]𝑖delimited-[]𝑚i\\in[m], let Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i} denote the set of elements j∈[n]𝑗delimited-[]𝑛j\\in[n] satisfying (j,j)∈Ai×Bi𝑗𝑗subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖(j,j)\\in A_{i}\\times B_{i}. Since G𝐺G is simple, the elements on the diagonal of M𝑀M are all zeros, hence the sets Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i} for i∈[m]𝑖delimited-[]𝑚i\\in[m] cover all vertices of G𝐺G. Since Ai×Bisubscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖A_{i}\\times B_{i} is a rectangle of zeros in M𝑀M, it also follows that Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i} is an independent set in G𝐺G. This implies that m≥χ​(G)𝑚𝜒𝐺m\\geq\\chi(G), and we are done.\n   The matrices M𝑀M that are known to achieve super-polynomial separations between rankbin(M)subscriptrankbin𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(M) and rank𝔹(M¯)subscriptrank𝔹¯𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(\\overline{M}), however, are apparently far from being regular   [ref]2.\nTheir constructions rely on a powerful technique, known as query-to-communication lifting, that enables to deduce separation results in communication complexity from separation results in the more approachable area of query complexity.\nThe proofs of the separation results of   [ref]2 involve two main steps, as described below. In the first step, one provides a family of Boolean functions f:{0,1}n→{0,1}:𝑓→superscript01𝑛01f:\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\} with a large gap between two certain measures of Boolean functions, namely, the unambiguous 111-certificate complexity of f𝑓f and the 00-certificate complexity of f𝑓f (see Section 2.3).\nThese measures can be viewed as query complexity analogues of the binary rank of a matrix and the Boolean rank of its complement.\nIt is shown in [ref]2 that the gap between the two measures can be nearly quadratic. In the second step, the separation is “lifted” from query complexity to communication complexity. This is done by considering, for some gadget function g:{0,1}ℓ×{0,1}ℓ→{0,1}:𝑔→superscript01ℓsuperscript01ℓ01g:\\{0,1\\}^{\\ell}\\times\\{0,1\\}^{\\ell}\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}, the communication problem in which two players get inputs from {0,1}ℓ⋅nsuperscript01⋅ℓ𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{\\ell\\cdot n} and aim to determine the value of the composed function f∘gn:{0,1}ℓ⋅n×{0,1}ℓ⋅n→{0,1}:𝑓superscript𝑔𝑛→superscript01⋅ℓ𝑛superscript01⋅ℓ𝑛01f\\circ g^{n}:\\{0,1\\}^{\\ell\\cdot n}\\times\\{0,1\\}^{\\ell\\cdot n}\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}, defined by for all x,y∈{0,1}ℓ⋅n𝑥𝑦superscript01⋅ℓ𝑛x,y\\in\\{0,1\\}^{\\ell\\cdot n}. Here, the vectors x=(x1,…,xn)𝑥subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛x=(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}) and y=(y1,…,yn)𝑦subscript𝑦1…subscript𝑦𝑛y=(y_{1},\\ldots,y_{n}) are viewed as concatenations of n𝑛n blocks of size ℓℓ\\ell.\nQuery-to-communication lifting results typically show that for some gadget g𝑔g, a gap between certain query complexity measures of f𝑓f implies a gap between the suitable communication complexity measures of the composed function f∘gn𝑓superscript𝑔𝑛f\\circ g^{n}. For the non-deterministic setting, it is shown in  that if the gadget g𝑔g is the inner product function on vectors of length ℓ=Θ​(log⁡n)ℓΘ𝑛\\ell=\\Theta(\\log n), then a gap between the unambiguous 111-certificate complexity and the 00-certificate complexity for f𝑓f implies a gap between the unambiguous non-deterministic communication complexity and the co-non-deterministic communication complexity for f∘gn𝑓superscript𝑔𝑛f\\circ g^{n} (see also [13, Appendix A]).\nThe analysis uses the fact that the inner product function forms a two-source extractor, as shown by Chor and Goldreich . Let M𝑀M denote the matrix associated with the communication problem of f∘gn𝑓superscript𝑔𝑛f\\circ g^{n} for the function f𝑓f constructed in [ref]2 and the inner product function g𝑔g.\nThe lifting result of  implies that M𝑀M attains a near optimal separation between rankbin(M)subscriptrankbin𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(M) and rank𝔹(M¯)subscriptrank𝔹¯𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(\\overline{M}).\nHowever, it can be seen that the matrix M𝑀M is not regular at all. For example, the row and the column of M𝑀M that correspond to the all-zero vector consist of only ones or only zeros, depending on the value of f𝑓f on the all-zero vector. We turn to describe how we obtain regular matrices M𝑀M with a similar gap between rankbin(M)subscriptrankbin𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(M) and rank𝔹(M¯)subscriptrank𝔹¯𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(\\overline{M}).\nWe first observe that to construct a regular matrix M𝑀M, it suffices to replace the inner product function in the above construction by a different gadget function g𝑔g. Specifically, it turns out that if g𝑔g is unbiased in a strong sense, namely, it is unbiased even while fixing one of its two inputs, then the matrix M𝑀M associated with f∘gn𝑓superscript𝑔𝑛f\\circ g^{n} is regular for any function f𝑓f (see Section 4.1).\nHence, to obtain the desired separation on regular matrices, we provide an extension of the query-to-communication lifting theorem of  which allows the gadget function g𝑔g to be not only the inner product function but any low-discrepancy function. We note that such an extension was speculated already in [14, Remark 1] and was actually established for the deterministic and probabilistic settings in a recent work of Chattopadhyay, Filmus, Koroth, Meir, and Pitassi . Building on the approach of  and on tools supplied in , we prove that such an extension holds for the non-deterministic setting as well (for a precise statement, see Theorem 3.2).\nWe proceed by showing that a slight variant g𝑔g of the inner product function, studied in [ref]4 and in , is unbiased in the required sense and has low discrepancy.\nThen, to prove Theorem 1.1, we apply our generalized query-to-communication lifting theorem to the family of functions f𝑓f provided in [ref]2 with this gadget g𝑔g. Let us mention that our generalized lifting theorem is not essential for the proof of Theorem 1.1. It turns out that the matrix M𝑀M obtained using the aforementioned gadget function g𝑔g has a sub-matrix that corresponds to a composition with the standard inner product function, hence the lower bound on rank𝔹(M¯)subscriptrank𝔹¯𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(\\overline{M}) can also be derived from the lifting result of . Yet, the generality of our lifting theorem, proved in Appendix A, can be used to obtain a separation between rankbin(M)subscriptrankbin𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(M) and rank𝔹(M¯)subscriptrank𝔹¯𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(\\overline{M}) using various other gadget functions, and we believe that it might find additional applications. We finally use the regular matrices given in Theorem 1.1 to provide regular counterexamples for the Alon-Saks-Seymour conjecture and to prove Theorem 1.2.\nIt is shown in  that a matrix M𝑀M with rankbin(M)subscriptrankbin𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(M) much smaller than rank𝔹(M¯)subscriptrank𝔹¯𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(\\overline{M}) can be transformed into a graph G𝐺G with bp(G)bp𝐺\\mathop{\\mathrm{bp}}(G) much smaller than χ​(G)𝜒𝐺\\chi(G). This transformation, however, does not preserve the regularity.\nIn fact, a natural attempt to produce a regular graph G𝐺G from a regular matrix M𝑀M using the approach of  results in a graph that is not even simple (because it has loops).\nMoreover, certain steps of the argument of  identify subgraphs of this graph G𝐺G with a biclique partition number much smaller than the chromatic number, but those subgraphs are not necessarily regular even if G𝐺G is.\nWe overcome these difficulties by combining the approach of  with a couple of additional ideas, and show that any square regular matrix M𝑀M with a large gap between rankbin(M)subscriptrankbin𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(M) and rank𝔹(M¯)subscriptrank𝔹¯𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(\\overline{M}) can be transformed into a simple regular graph G𝐺G with a similar gap between bp(G)bp𝐺\\mathop{\\mathrm{bp}}(G) and χ​(G)𝜒𝐺\\chi(G) (see Theorem 5.1)."
