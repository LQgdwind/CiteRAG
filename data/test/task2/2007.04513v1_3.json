    "on planar bipartite graphs": "Although Maximum Cut is trivial for bipartite graphs, we first observe that the same does not apply to compute the largest bond. Largest Bond is NP-complete even on planar bipartite subcubic graphs. In [ref]40, Haglin and Venkatesan proved that Largest Bond remains NP-complete on planar cubic graphs. Since subdivision of edges does not increase the size of the largest bond, by subdividing each edge of a planar cubic graph G𝐺G we obtain planar bipartite subcubic graph G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} such that G𝐺G has a bond of size k𝑘k if and only if G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} has a bond of size k𝑘k.\n∎ Let G𝐺G be a simple bipartite graph and ℓ∈ℕℓℕ\\ell\\in\\mathbb{N}. To determine the largest bond ∂(S)𝑆\\partial(S) of G𝐺G with |S|=ℓ𝑆ℓ|S|=\\ell is W​𝑊delimited-[]1W-hard with respect to ℓℓ\\ell. From an instance H𝐻H of k𝑘k-Independent Set on regular graphs we first construct a multigraph G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} by adding an edge between any pair of vertices.\nFinally, we obtain a simple graph G𝐺G by subdividing every edge of G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime}.\nNotice that H𝐻H has an independent set of size k𝑘k if and only if G𝐺G has a bond ∂(S)𝑆\\partial(S) of size d​k+k​(n−k)𝑑𝑘𝑘𝑛𝑘dk+k(n-k) with |S|=k+(k2)𝑆𝑘FRACOP𝑘2|S|=k+{\\genfrac{(}{)}{0.0pt}{2}{k}{2}}, where d𝑑d is the vertex degree of H𝐻H.\n∎ Now, we consider Maximum Connected Cut on planar bipartite graphs. a) A monotone rectilinear representation of an instance of Planar Monotone Rectilinear 3-SAT. b) The reduced graph Hϕsubscript𝐻italic-ϕH_{\\phi}. Maximum Connected Cut is NP-complete on planar bipartite graphs. The reduction is based on the proof of Theorem 444 in , which proves that Maximum Connected Cut is NP-hard on planar graphs.\nWe transform the planar reduced graph in  into our planar bipartite graph by using additional vertices, called bridge vertices. In this proof, we reduce an instance of Planar Monotone Rectilinear 3-SAT, which is known to be NP-complete , to a planar bipartite instance of Maximum Connected Cut.\nAn instance of Planar Monotone Rectilinear 3-SAT consists of a 3-CNF formula ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi satisfies the following properties: (a) each clause contains either only positive literals or only negative literals, (b) the bipartite incidence graph Gϕsubscript𝐺italic-ϕG_{\\phi} is planar, and (c) Gϕsubscript𝐺italic-ϕG_{\\phi} has a monotone rectilinear representation.\nIn a monotone rectilinear representation of Gϕsubscript𝐺italic-ϕG_{\\phi}, the variable vertices are drawn on a straight line in the order of their indices and each positive (resp., negative) clause vertex is drawn in the “positive side” (resp., “negative side”) of the plane defined by the straight line (See Figure 1). The Reduction.\nGiven a formula ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi of Planar Monotone Rectilinear 3-SAT with a monotone rectilinear representation as in Figure 1 (a), let X={x1,x2,…,xn}𝑋subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2…subscript𝑥𝑛X=\\{x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{n}\\} be a set of variables and 𝒞={C1,C2,…,Cm}𝒞subscript𝐶1subscript𝐶2…subscript𝐶𝑚{\\mathcal{C}}=\\{C_{1},C_{2},\\dots,C_{m}\\} be a set of clauses.\nLet K>4​m2𝐾4superscript𝑚2K>4m^{2} and m>2𝑚2m>2.\nThen we create the graph Hϕ=(V,E)subscript𝐻italic-ϕ𝑉𝐸H_{\\phi}=(V,E) as follows (see Fig.1).\nFor each variable xi∈Xsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑋x_{i}\\in X, we create two literal vertices v​(xi)𝑣subscript𝑥𝑖v(x_{i}) and v​(x¯i)𝑣subscript¯𝑥𝑖v(\\bar{x}_{i}) corresponding to the literals xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} and x¯isubscript¯𝑥𝑖\\bar{x}_{i}, respectively.\nMoreover, we add K𝐾K helper vertices h1i,…,hKisubscriptsuperscriptℎ𝑖1…subscriptsuperscriptℎ𝑖𝐾h^{i}_{1},\\ldots,h^{i}_{K} and connect hkisubscriptsuperscriptℎ𝑖𝑘h^{i}_{k} to v​(xi)𝑣subscript𝑥𝑖v(x_{i}) and v​(x¯i)𝑣subscript¯𝑥𝑖v(\\bar{x}_{i}) for each k=1,…,K𝑘1…𝐾k=1,\\ldots,K.\nFor every clause Cj∈𝒞subscript𝐶𝑗𝒞C_{j}\\in{\\mathcal{C}}, we create a clause vertex v​(Cj)𝑣subscript𝐶𝑗v(C_{j}) and connect v​(xi)𝑣subscript𝑥𝑖v(x_{i}) (resp., v​(x¯i)𝑣subscript¯𝑥𝑖v(\\bar{x}_{i})) to v​(Cj)𝑣subscript𝐶𝑗v(C_{j}) if Cjsubscript𝐶𝑗C_{j} contains xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} (resp., x¯isubscript¯𝑥𝑖\\bar{x}_{i}).\nMoreover, we attach K𝐾\\sqrt{K} pendant vertices to each v​(Cj)𝑣subscript𝐶𝑗v(C_{j}). Then we attach K𝐾K pendant vertices to each helper vertex hkisubscriptsuperscriptℎ𝑖𝑘h^{i}_{k}.\nFinally, we add a bridge vertex bi,i+1subscript𝑏𝑖𝑖1b_{i,i+1} with K𝐾K pendant vertices that we make adjacent to each v​(xi)𝑣subscript𝑥𝑖v(x_{i}), v​(x¯i)𝑣subscript¯𝑥𝑖v(\\bar{x}_{i}), v​(xi+1)𝑣subscript𝑥𝑖1v(x_{i+1}), and v​(x¯i+1)𝑣subscript¯𝑥𝑖1v(\\bar{x}_{i+1}) for 1≤i≤n−11𝑖𝑛11\\leq i\\leq n-1.\nWe denote by Hϕsubscript𝐻italic-ϕH_{\\phi} the graph we obtained.\nNotice that we can draw Hϕsubscript𝐻italic-ϕH_{\\phi} in the plane according to a monotone rectilinear representation.\nMoreover, Hϕsubscript𝐻italic-ϕH_{\\phi} is bipartite since we only add helper and bridge vertices, which have a neighbor only in literal vertices, and pendant vertices to the planar drawing of Gϕsubscript𝐺italic-ϕG_{\\phi}. Clearly, this reduction can be done in polynomial time.\nTo complete the proof, we prove the following claim. A formula ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi is satisfiable if and only if there is a maximum connected cut of size at least m​K+n​K2+(2​n−1)​K+2​(n−1)𝑚𝐾𝑛superscript𝐾22𝑛1𝐾2𝑛1m\\sqrt{K}+nK^{2}+(2n-1)K+2(n-1) in Hϕsubscript𝐻italic-ϕH_{\\phi}. Let VXsubscript𝑉𝑋V_{X}, VCsubscript𝑉𝐶V_{C}, VHsubscript𝑉𝐻V_{H}, VBsubscript𝑉𝐵V_{B}, and VPsubscript𝑉𝑃V_{P} be the set of literal vertices, clause vertices, helper vertices, bridge vertices, and pendant vertices, respectively. (⇒⇒\\Rightarrow) We are given a satisfiable assignment α𝛼\\alpha for ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi.\nFor α𝛼\\alpha, we denote a true literal by lisubscript𝑙𝑖l_{i}. We also call v​(li)𝑣subscript𝑙𝑖v(l_{i}) a true literal vertex.\nLet S=⋃i=1n{v​(li)}∪VC∪VH∪VB𝑆superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛𝑣subscript𝑙𝑖subscript𝑉𝐶subscript𝑉𝐻subscript𝑉𝐵S=\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}\\{v(l_{i})\\}\\cup V_{C}\\cup V_{H}\\cup V_{B}.\nThat is, S𝑆S consists of the set of true literal vertices, all the clauses vertices, all helper vertices and bridge vertices.\nObserve that the induced subgraph by S𝑆S is connected.\nThis follows from the facts that each clause has at least one true literal and literal vertices are connected by bridge vertices. Finally, we show that |∂(S)|≥m​K+n​K2+(2​n−1)​K+2​(n−1)𝑆𝑚𝐾𝑛superscript𝐾22𝑛1𝐾2𝑛1|\\partial(S)|\\geq m\\sqrt{K}+nK^{2}+(2n-1)K+2(n-1).\nSince each clause vertex has K𝐾\\sqrt{K} pendant vertices and each helper vertex K𝐾K pendant vertices, there are m​K+n​K2𝑚𝐾𝑛superscript𝐾2m\\sqrt{K}+nK^{2} cut edges.\nMoreover, each bridge vertex has K𝐾K cut edges incident to its pendant vertices and two cut edges incident to literal vertices not in S𝑆S.\nFinally, since either v​(xi)𝑣subscript𝑥𝑖v(x_{i}) or v​(xi¯)𝑣¯subscript𝑥𝑖v(\\bar{x_{i}}) is not in S𝑆S, there are n​K𝑛𝐾nK cut edges between literal vertices and helper vertices.\nTherefore, we have |∂(S)|≥m​K+n​K2+(n−1)​(K+2)+n​K=m​K+n​K2+(2​n−1)​K+2​(n−1)𝑆𝑚𝐾𝑛superscript𝐾2𝑛1𝐾2𝑛𝐾𝑚𝐾𝑛superscript𝐾22𝑛1𝐾2𝑛1|\\partial(S)|\\geq m\\sqrt{K}+nK^{2}+(n-1)(K+2)+nK=m\\sqrt{K}+nK^{2}+(2n-1)K+2(n-1). (⇐⇐\\Leftarrow)\nWe are given a connected cut S𝑆S in Hϕsubscript𝐻italic-ϕH_{\\phi} such that |∂(S)|≥m​K+n​K2+(2​n−1)​K+2​(n−1)𝑆𝑚𝐾𝑛superscript𝐾22𝑛1𝐾2𝑛1|\\partial(S)|\\geq m\\sqrt{K}+nK^{2}+(2n-1)K+2(n-1).\nHere, we assume without loss of generality that S𝑆S is an optimal connected cut of Hϕsubscript𝐻italic-ϕH_{\\phi}.\nSuppose, for contradiction, that neither of v​(xi)𝑣subscript𝑥𝑖v(x_{i}) and v​(x¯i)𝑣subscript¯𝑥𝑖v(\\bar{x}_{i}) is contained in S𝑆S for some variable xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i}.\nThen, all helper vertices hkisubscriptsuperscriptℎ𝑖𝑘h^{i}_{k} cannot be contained in S𝑆S due to the connectivity of S𝑆S.\nThere are m​K+3​m+2​n​K+(K+4)​(n−1)𝑚𝐾3𝑚2𝑛𝐾𝐾4𝑛1m\\sqrt{K}+3m+2nK+(K+4)(n-1) edges except for those between helper vertices and its pendant vertices.\nThus, it follows that |∂(S)|≤m​K+3​m+2​n​K+(K+4)​(n−1)+(n−1)​K2𝑆𝑚𝐾3𝑚2𝑛𝐾𝐾4𝑛1𝑛1superscript𝐾2|\\partial(S)|\\leq m\\sqrt{K}+3m+2nK+(K+4)(n-1)+(n-1)K^{2}.\nSince K>4​m2𝐾4superscript𝑚2K>4m^{2} and m>2𝑚2m>2, this contradicts the assumption that |∂(S)|≥m​K+n​K2+(2​n−1)​K+2​(n−1)𝑆𝑚𝐾𝑛superscript𝐾22𝑛1𝐾2𝑛1|\\partial(S)|\\geq m\\sqrt{K}+nK^{2}+(2n-1)K+2(n-1).\nThus, at least one literal vertex must be contained in S𝑆S for each xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i}. Next, we show that every helper vertex must be contained in S𝑆S.\nSuppose a helper vertex hkisubscriptsuperscriptℎ𝑖𝑘h^{i}_{k} is not contained in S𝑆S.\nThen, all K𝐾K pendant vertices attached to hkisubscriptsuperscriptℎ𝑖𝑘h^{i}_{k} is not contained in S𝑆S due to the connectivity of S𝑆S.\nSince at least one literal vertex of xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} is contained in S𝑆S, we can increase the size of the cut by moving hkisubscriptsuperscriptℎ𝑖𝑘h^{i}_{k} to S𝑆S, contradicting the optimality of S𝑆S.\nTherefore, we assume that every helper vertex is contained in S𝑆S.\nSimilar to helper vertices, we can prove that every bridge vertex is contained in S𝑆S. Then, we observe that exactly one literal vertex must be contained in S𝑆S for each xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i}.\nSuppose that both v​(xi)𝑣subscript𝑥𝑖v(x_{i}) and v​(x¯i)𝑣subscript¯𝑥𝑖v(\\bar{x}_{i}) are contained in S𝑆S for some xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i}.\nSince all helper vertices and bridge vertices are contained in S𝑆S, we may increase the size of the cut by moving either of v​(xi)𝑣subscript𝑥𝑖v(x_{i}) or v​(x¯i)𝑣subscript¯𝑥𝑖v(\\bar{x}_{i}) to V∖S𝑉𝑆V\\setminus S.\nHowever, there are some issues we have to consider carefully.\nSuppose that v​(xi)𝑣subscript𝑥𝑖v(x_{i}) is moved to V∖S𝑉𝑆V\\setminus S.\nThen, some clause vertices v​(Cj)𝑣subscript𝐶𝑗v(C_{j}) in S𝑆S can be disconnected in G​[S]𝐺delimited-[]𝑆G[S].\nIf so, we also move v​(Cj)𝑣subscript𝐶𝑗v(C_{j}) together with its pendant vertices to V∖S𝑉𝑆V\\setminus S.\nSince there are at least K+1𝐾1K+1 cut edges newly introduced but at most m​(K+3)𝑚𝐾3m(\\sqrt{K}+3) edges removed from the cutset, the size of the cutset is increased, also contradicting the optimality of S𝑆S. Finally, we show that every clause vertex is, in fact, contained in S𝑆S.\nSuppose that |S∩VC|=m′<m𝑆subscript𝑉𝐶superscript𝑚′𝑚|S\\cap V_{C}|=m^{\\prime}<m.\nIf v​(Cj)𝑣subscript𝐶𝑗v(C_{j}) is not in S𝑆S, its pendant vertices are also not in S𝑆S.\nDue to the optimality of S𝑆S, the pendant vertices of every helper vertex and every bridge vertex is in V∖S𝑉𝑆V\\setminus S.\nThus, we have |∂(S)∩∂(VH∪VB)|=n​K​(K+1)+(K+2)​(n−1)=n​K2+(2​n−1)​K+2​(n−1)𝑆subscript𝑉𝐻subscript𝑉𝐵𝑛𝐾𝐾1𝐾2𝑛1𝑛superscript𝐾22𝑛1𝐾2𝑛1|\\partial(S)\\cap\\partial(V_{H}\\cup V_{B})|=nK(K+1)+(K+2)(n-1)=nK^{2}+(2n-1)K+2(n-1).\nTherefore, |∂(S)|=|∂(S)∩∂(VC)|+|∂(S)∩∂(VH∪VB)|≤m′​K+3​(m−m′)+n​K2+(2​n−1)​K+2​(n−1)<m​K+n​K2+(2​n−1)​K+2​(n−1)𝑆𝑆subscript𝑉𝐶𝑆subscript𝑉𝐻subscript𝑉𝐵superscript𝑚′𝐾3𝑚superscript𝑚′𝑛superscript𝐾22𝑛1𝐾2𝑛1𝑚𝐾𝑛superscript𝐾22𝑛1𝐾2𝑛1|\\partial(S)|=|\\partial(S)\\cap\\partial(V_{C})|+|\\partial(S)\\cap\\partial(V_{H}\\cup V_{B})|\\leq m^{\\prime}\\sqrt{K}+3(m-m^{\\prime})+nK^{2}+(2n-1)K+2(n-1)<m\\sqrt{K}+nK^{2}+(2n-1)K+2(n-1) as K>4​m2𝐾4superscript𝑚2K>4m^{2}.\nThis is also contradicting to the assumption of the size of the cut. To summarize, exactly one literal vertex is in S𝑆S for each variable and every clause vertex is in S𝑆S.\nSince G​[S]𝐺delimited-[]𝑆G[S] is connected, every clause vertex is adjacent to a literal vertex included in S𝑆S.\nGiven this, we can obtain a satisfying assignment for ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi.\n∎ This completes the proof of Theorem 5.\n∎"
