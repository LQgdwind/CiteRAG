On the other hand in this section we reproduce the results of the original paper (Li et al.) [ref]26 using a VGG-16 model and 224×\\times224 input size and then carry out our LP analysis further confirming our observations.\nWe take the setting of [ref]26, which considers the ImageNet [ref]42 transfer to various datasets, in particular CUB , and Scenes . We use the same model architecture (VGG-16) and training procedures described in  [ref]26, which proposes LwF, closely reproducing their ImageNet →→\\to Scenes as the first step in the sequence (see Tab. 6). We also include an EWC baseline under two conditions: (a) large λ𝜆\\lambda value (λ=8​k𝜆8𝑘\\lambda=8k), so the network is inclined to preserve the knowledge important to the previous tasks, and (b) small λ𝜆\\lambda value (λ=0.5​k𝜆0.5𝑘\\lambda=0.5k), so the network is encouraged to perform competitively on the current task. The results are shown in Figure 8 and Table 8. We first note that our results for the first task switch are consistent with those reported in [ref]26 (see Tab. 6). Fig. 8 reveals that although the forgetting in terms of the traditional measure is high for finetuning compared to LwF (as shown in [ref]26), the LP accuracy of these methods suggest a much less drastic forgetting. Furthermore, the LP performance across finetuning and other methods is not as drastically different as their respective observed accuracies are. Indeed, we observe that on the third task, finetuning outperforms LwF in representation forgetting on ImageNet.\nSimilarly EWC does not clearly outperform naive finetuning. For example, if using one hyper-parameter for the regularization term the performance closely tracks finetuning. On the other hand using λ=8​k𝜆8𝑘\\lambda=8k we observe the best LP performance on ImageNet through the task sequence but degraded current task performance as seen in Fig. 8. Although we followed the training procedure as closely as possible to the ones reported by [ref]26, the results are slightly different from the ones reported in [ref]26 due to (a) not using the task-head warm-up step, where the backbone network is first frozen and the newly added task head is trained until convergence (warm-up), and then the entire network is trained until convergence, and (b) stochasticity of training neural networks. Table 6 highlights these differences. [0.52]\n\\capttabbox\n\n\n\n\nTask 1 LP\nLP Acc.
