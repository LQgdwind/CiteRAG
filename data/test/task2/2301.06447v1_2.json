    "client-edge association in hierarchical fl": "The client-edge association strategy in hierarchical FL has a significant impact on model learning performance due to the data and resource heterogeneity across the dispersed clients [ref]47. HierFAVG ignores the varying training speed of the distributed clients and randomly groups them into different clusters, which may prolong the communication time of each training round [ref]14. Considering the straggler effect, both TiFL [ref]47 and FedAT  divide the clients into different tiers based on the measured latency so that the resource heterogeneity can be mitigated [ref]47. To tackle the data heterogeneity in FL, Duan et al. propose FedGroup, which clusters clients into multiple groups based on the cosine similarity of their parameter updates . In FedCluster, the authors provide several representative clustering approaches, including random uniform clustering, timezone-based clustering and availability-based clustering, to support for various application scenarios . Unfortunately, current client-edge association schemes only focus on one dimension of heterogeneity, without considering the trade-off between data and resource heterogeneities. Existing convergence analysis of hierarchical FL schemes mainly focus on FL with two levels of synchronous model aggregations. For example, the convergence of HierFAVG measures two-level of non-IIDness (i.e., the client level and the edge level) for data distribution in the hierarchical system, and provides qualitative guidelines on picking the aggregation frequencies at two levels [ref]14. While the theoretical analysis in  further proves that reducing the non-IIDness at the edge level is important for the model convergence. Although FedAT  is designed with synchronous client-edge aggregation and asynchronous edge-cloud aggregation, the asynchronous aggregation mechanism in FedAT is a weighted sum of all the latest edge models, which is different from our asynchronous update mechanism. Moreover, the convergence analysis of FedAT ignores the staleness effect and hence fails to provide insights for staleness effect alleviation. Nevertheless, our convergence analysis for HiFL considers both staleness introduced by asynchronous model aggregation and non-IIDness inherent in FL, and further draws some insights for staleness control and non-IIDness reduction to achieve a fast convergence rate and a low convergence bound."
