    "v related work": "Causal effect estimation from observational data has been an active research topic in statistics and artificial intelligence, and is largely based on two frameworks: potential outcome framework¬†  and graphic causal modelling¬†  9. There are also many research works on estimating two different types of causal effect, the average causal effect estimation in a whole population and conditional causal effect estimation in a subpopulation. This work belongs to the first type and we will briefly outline some works on conditional causal effect estimation at the end of this section. For causal effect estimation, various adjustment criteria¬† 1   6 (or in general using d‚Äãoùëëùëúdo calculus operation¬†) are commonly employed to approach the problem in graphical causal modelling. The methods in this category have been outlined in the Introduction, and hence we do not discuss them here. For the methods under the potential outcome framework, the covariate set is normally assumed that satisfies the unconfoundedness and a matching method based on covariate balance is used for causal effect estimation¬†4  5. We do not intend to review the methods here and refer interested readers to¬† 6. Instead, we just briefly discuss representative methods based on potential outcome framework used in this paper. Matching is a practical way to balance the distributions of covariates in the treatment and control groups to achieve unbiased causal effect estimation. When the size of a covariate set is large, exact matching or the nearest neighbour matching is impractical. The propensity score collapses the covariate set to one dimension and is a sound way for balancing covariate distribution in treatment and control groups. Propensity Score Matching (PSM)¬† is the classic method for average causal effect estimation and is widely used in various applications¬† 7. Covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS)¬† is a major improvement of propensity score matching and has been shown good performance. Causal forest (CF)¬† uses the random forest to improve causal effect estimation based on matching. A covariate set may include some variables that are not necessary to be adjusted in causal effect estimation. The process of selecting a refined covariate set is called covariate set selection¬†1  2. The recently causal graph has been used for covariate set selection, and CovSel¬†0 summarises the most widely used covariate selection criteria. Five criteria have been used in this paper. The conditional causal effect estimation aims to remove the heterogeneous by identifying the subpopulations with different causal effects. For estimating conditional causal effect, many machine learning algorithms have been adapted for the task¬†8 9 0 1. We mention some typical works here, and a comprehensive review can be found in¬†2 3. Athey, Wager et al.¬†8 have adapted a tree-based algorithm for estimation. Louizos, Shalit et al.¬† have proposed to utilise Variational Auto-encoder to estimate the unknown latent space of confounders and conditional causal effects simultaneously. Hassanpour and Greiner¬†4 have proposed a context-aware important sampling re-weighing scheme to address the distributional shift due to selection bias in conditional causal effect. K√ºnzel, Sekhon et al.¬†9 have developed a meta-learner, the X-learner, for conditional causal effect estimation. Our work differs from all these works in that we estimate the average causal effect. Because of different purposes, these methods have not been compared in the experiment."
