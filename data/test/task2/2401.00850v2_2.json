    "iv-d results": "We present results of our method on each dataset. Overall, our results demonstrate that our method yields\nreliable gains over fully-supervised methods, and significantly surpasses the baselines. CroHD [ref]15.\nWe use PIPs [ref]14 pretrained on FlyingThings  dataset and run CroHD inference during sampling with a spatial resolution of (768,1280)7681280(768,1280). The 8-frame cycle consistency filter (Eqn. 3) and multiple-video fine-tuning (Sec. III-C) are adopted. We choose 2.52.52.5 for the threshold τ𝜏\\tau and 300030003000 for finetuning iterations κ𝜅\\kappa. Results and comparisons are provided in Table I. We compare with state-of-the-art methods supervised out-of-domain 6 [ref]34 [ref]14, and also methods that perform self-supervised finetuning on a pre-trained model like ours. Our method clearly surpasses all of the baselines with better scores on most of the metrics. Notably, compared with pretrained PIPs where our optimization begins, we reduce ATE-Vis and ATE-Occ from 4.574.574.57 and 7.717.717.71 to 4.024.024.02 and 6.796.796.79, improving by around 10%percent1010\\% with our self-supervised refinement procedure. For baselines, we also try several self-supervised techniques to finetune the pretrained model as ours, namely the PIPs+Color and PIPS+Feat shown in Table I. The idea of them is to use a self-supervised loss measuring the difference between the color or the image features at each predicted track position. We could observe that both these two techniques are not effective, demonstrating even worse scores on many evaluation metrics than the pretrained model. This further implies the effectiveness of our proposed procedure in finetuning a pretrained motion model. Horse30 \nWe use PIPs [ref]14 pretrained on FlyingThings  dataset and run Horse30 inference during sampling with a spatial resolution of (256,448)256448(256,448). The 8-frame cycle consistency filter (Eqn. 3) and multiple-video fine-tuning (Sec. III-C) are adopted. We choose 333 for the threshold τ𝜏\\tau and 600060006000 for finetuning iterations κ𝜅\\kappa. Our results on this dataset are shown in Table III. Compared to the pretrained PIPs [ref]14, our method demonstrates a marked improvement in ATE and MTE. Specifically, we observed a decrease in ATE from 12.3112.3112.31 to 10.8110.8110.81 and in MTE from 4.404.404.40 to 3.973.973.97 with our self-supervised motion refinement technique. For reference, we also include the performance of pretrained RAFT 6 model, which registers an ATE of 12.4612.4612.46 and MTE of 4.034.034.03. We also include the PIPs+Color baseline implemented in the same way as in CroHD to showcase that the traditional motion self-supervision technique fails on pretrained model. Concretely, it achieves an ATE of 12.1512.1512.15 and MTE of 4.404.404.40, indicating that it barely helps to improve model performance. These results showcase the effectiveness of our method. TAP-Vid-DAVIS .\nWe use PIPs [ref]14 pre-trained on FlyingThings  dataset and run DAVIS inference during sampling with a spatial resolution of (288, 512). The 8-\nframe cycle consistency filter (Eqn. 3) and single-video finetuning (Sec. III-C) are adopted. Specifically, we choose\n111 for the threshold τ𝜏\\tau and 100 for finetuning iterations κ𝜅\\kappa for each video. For a single-video finetuning setup, we show performance change on each individual video with the baseline pre-trained model. To compare with other methods on the same scale, we also report an average of our performance over all videos. Results and comparisons are provided in Table IV-D and Fig. 2. We compare with state-of-the-art methods  6 [ref]14  supervised out of domain including the latest works like Tap-Net . We beat all of the baselines with better δ𝛿\\delta and AJ. Notably, compared with PIPs where we start from, we improve δ𝛿\\delta and AJ from 59.459.459.4 and 42.042.042.0 to 60.060.060.0 and 42.542.542.5. Moreover, we also show the performance change in δavgsubscript𝛿avg\\delta_{\\text{avg}} for each video in Fig. 2. We could observe positive change through our self-supervised refinement on almost all of the 30 videos except two videos ‘parkour’ and ‘scooter-black’. Compared with the CroHD results in Table I where we improve the pretrained model by 10%percent1010\\%, results on Tap-Vid-DAVIS do not show as much improvement. However, we note that each Tap-Vid-DAVIS video is only 555 seconds long on average (not much space to extract pseudo-labels), and ground truth is only available for a small number of points (less than 30 per video). MPI-Sintel.\nFor MPI-Sintel, we use RAFT 6 pretrained on FlyingThings datasets and run Sintel inference during sampling with a spatial resolution of (436, 1024). We use the 2-frame cycle consistency filter (Eqn. 1) augmented by color consistency (Eqn. 2) and fine-tune on each video individually. We use the threshold hyperparameters α=0.005𝛼0.005\\alpha=0.005, β=0.25𝛽0.25\\beta=0.25, and γ=0.1𝛾0.1\\gamma=0.1. We choose 100100100 for finetuning iterations\nκ𝜅\\kappa for each video. We evaluate performance change on each individual scene, and also measure the average across videos.  Quantitative comparisons are provided in Table IV, and qualitative comparisons are in Fig. 3, and Fig. 4. We compare with state-of-the-art methods supervised out-of-domain, self-supervised methods, and self-supervised techniques to finetune the pretrained model. We surpass all of the baselines, with better\nEPE on both clean and final splits of MPI-Sintel. Notably, compared with the pre-trained RAFT model, we reduce the EPE for both clean and final from 1.461.461.46 and 2.722.722.72 to 1.321.321.32 and 2.462.462.46, demonstrating around 10%percent1010\\% improvement. Since evaluation variance is quite huge on Sintel, we visualize the percentage EPE change for each of the videos in Figure 3. We can clearly observe that our self-supervised refinement improves the model performance on all of the scenes except ‘ambush_6’ in the clean split. On the other scenes, we observe obvious and significant improvements, even 30%percent3030\\% on scenes like ‘ambush_7’. We visualize the optical flow results in Fig. 4, and highlight the noticeably different regions in red boxes. We observe that our proposed method helps refine the optical flow output by completing missing objects, and improving smoothness in large regions. As baselines to our optimization strategy, we try using color constancy as a self-supervised loss to finetune the pretrained model, optionally combined with a smoothness regularizer or edge-aware smoothness regularizer. We list these in Table IV as RAFT+Color, RAFT+Col.+Smooth and RAFT+Col.+Edge-Sm. In practice, we found that none of these techniques help, and EPE simply rises as training progresses."
