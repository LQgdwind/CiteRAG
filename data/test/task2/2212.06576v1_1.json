  "title": "AI Model Utilization Measurements For Finding Class Encoding Patterns",
  "sections": {
    "related work": "The problem of explainable AI is very broad and the term explainable is still debated in philosophical texts  (“What is an Explanation?”). A comprehensive survey of explainable AI has been published by Arrieta et al.  and extensive teaching materials have been made available by Lakkaraju et al. .\nOur approach can be related to “Explanation of Deep Network Representation” (roles of layers, individual units, and representation vectors) according to the Deep Learning-specific taxonomy presented by Arrieta et al. in , Fig. 11.\nOur utilization-based approach is inspired by exploring relationships between biological neural circuits and AI model computation graphs as discussed by Olah et al. in . Next, the related work is presented with respect to the three formulated problems. Our work on defining utilization is related to the past work on measuring neural network efficiency , [ref]17, which is rooted in neuroscience and information theory. In the work of Schaub and Hotaling , neural efficiency and artificial intelligence quotient (aIQ) are used to balance neural network performance and neural network efficiency while inspired by the neuroscience studies relating efficiency of solving Tetris task and brain metabolism during the task execution . In the work of Bajcsy et al. [ref]17, an online simulation framework is used to simulate efficiencies of small-size neural networks with a variety of features derived from two-dimensional (2D) dot pattern data. In contrast to the previous work , [ref]17, our theoretical framework defines and reasons about class encodings, AI model fingerprints, and metrics for finding class encoding patterns for much more complex AI models and training datasets. Following the categorization in the survey on interpreting inner structures of AI models 0, the utilization measurements can be related to concept vectors whose goal is to associate directions in latent space with meaningful concepts. In the work of Fong and Vedaldi 1(Network 2 Vector) and Bau et al. 2 (Network Dissection), the distribution of activation maps at each convolutional unit as inputs pass through is used to determine a threshold. Threshold-based segmented activation maps are compared across concepts. In contrast to the previous work 1,2, our utilization measurements are computed at all computation units in an AI model, the activation maps are binarized at zero, and statistics are computed over a distribution of tensor-states (including the binarized activation maps from convolutional units). Our approach does not use any inserted modules like in concept whitening 3 to align the latent space with concepts. Furthermore, our approach does not project class activation maps to create saliency maps 4, 5 in the input spatial domain, but, rather, it analyzes class activations in the tensor-state space. Finally, following the categorization of approaches to understanding community (group or cluster) structure in AI models presented by Watanabe et al. 6, our overarching approach to finding class encoding patterns falls into the category\n“Analysis of trained layered neural networks”\nand combines two subcategories: analysis of unit outputs and their mutual relationships and analysis of the influence on neural network inference by data. Overall, our approach can be related to modular partitioning 7, 8, and unsupervised disentanglement of a learned representation 9, 0.\nIn 7, 8, the authors search for local specializations of AI model subgraphs by using spectral clustering of AI model computation graphs and introducing two metrics, such as accuracy changes during neuron pruning ablation (neuron importance) and class-specific accuracy drop in a subcluster of neurons (input-feature coherence).\nIn contrast to 7, 8, our clustering of computation units does not use \"strong\" and \"weak\" structural undirected connectivity of neurons as in spectral clustering, but, rather, repetitive co-occurrence patterns of utilization values in connected computation units.\nFrom the perspective of representation disentanglement, two studies by Locatello et al. 9, 0 perform extensive experiments on 14 0001400014\\,000 models trained on eight datasets to conclude that well-disentangled models cannot be identified without supervision and the evaluation metrics do not always agree on what should be considered as “disentangled”. While we tacitly assume that high-dimensional data can be explained by lower dimensional semantically meaningful latent variables as by Locatello et al. 9, 0, we do not attempt to fully automate finding subgraphs (i.e., a human is always in the loop) to follow the conclusions by Locatello et al. 9, 0. In addition, we do not aim at fully partitioning all AI model computation graphs into poly-semantic and mono-semantic subgraphs based on the poly-semantic and mono-semantic classification of neurons in subgraphs according to Olah et al.  and Räuker et al. 0."
