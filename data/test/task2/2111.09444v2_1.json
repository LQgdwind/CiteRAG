    "fourier analysis on hdx:": "Fourier analysis on HDX was originally studied by Diksein, Dinur, Filmus, and Harsha , who introduced the HD-Level-Set Decomposition, analyzed its spectral properties, and used it to prove an FKN Theorem for HDX. A similar decomposition was also proposed around the same time by Kaufman and Oppenheim , though their work was more focused on understanding the spectral structure of higher order random walks than on developing a theory of Fourier analysis. In the years since, the HD-Level-Set Decomposition has seen some further development [ref]2  , and the nascent theory has helped build efficient approximation algorithms for certain kùëòk-CSPs [ref]2 and unique games , but the restriction to second moment methods seems to have limited its use otherwise. Towards breaking this same barrier, Gur, Lifshitz, and Liu  have also (independently) developed a similar theory of hypercontractivity on local-spectral expanders. While their work certainly shares some connections to ours, its main proof techniques differ substantially and we believe the two works are of independent interest."
