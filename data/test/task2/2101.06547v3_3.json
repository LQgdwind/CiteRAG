  "sections": {
    "b.3 baselines": "All of these baselines share the shared perception backbone, object detection, and actor feature extraction models as described above. These baselines are divided into actor-independent models that either output explicit marginal likelihoods (i.e. MultiPath ) or output sampled trajectories such as our CVAE, DPP [ref]46 and DLow [ref]47 models, and scene-consistent models that are autoregressive (ESP ) or implicit variable models (ILVM [ref]5). As detailed in [ref]5, for MultiPath, we use their mixture of trajectories parameterization instead of our encoder-decoder architecture, to predict a gaussian for each waypoint. For the CVAE model, we replace the Encoder, Prior and Decoder SIMs with MLPs of similar dimension, but use the same variational inference parameterization. For the DPP model, we use the frozen Decoder from the CVAE model. Similarly to [ref]46, instead of predicting a μ𝜇\\mu and σ𝜎\\sigma vectors, we predict S𝑆S scenes samples of latent vectors using an MLP, where each scene sample consists of a 64-dimensional latent vector for each actor. We do this by predicting a S∗64𝑆64S*64-dimensional vector for each actor, and reshaping that into S𝑆S vectors of length 646464 per actor. Then, we decode each scene sample of latent vectors to get S𝑆S separate scene motion forecasts Y𝑌Y. We then apply the determinantal point process loss as described in [ref]46. To get the xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} vectors, as referred to their work (not to be confused with the LookOut definition), we concatenate the trajectories in one scene over all the actors, their (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y) coordinates over time for each scene to get a N∗T∗2𝑁𝑇2N*T*2-dimensional vector xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} for each scene i𝑖i, where N𝑁N is the number of actors and T𝑇T is the number of future timesteps predicted. To get the zisubscript𝑧𝑖z_{i} vectors, as referred to their work (not to be confused with the LookOut definition), we concatenate the per-actor vectors in each scene to get N∗64𝑁64N*64-dimensional vectors zisubscript𝑧𝑖z_{i} for each scene i𝑖i. We use these vectors to compute the Diversity Loss as described in their paper. For the DLow model, we use the frozen Decoder from the CVAE model. Similarly to [ref]47, we predict S𝑆S scene samples of an A𝐴A and B𝐵B vector for each agent using an MLP. Unlike their paper, we output an A𝐴A vector representing the diagonal of the matrix, because the full matrix would not fit in memory given our high dimensionality. These A𝐴A and B𝐵B are essentially used in the same way as described in section 3.2 of our paper, except planning-based diversity and scenario probability scoring are not used. For our ESP model, we adapt it to our feature contexts and memory constraints as described in [ref]5. For our ILVM baseline, we use exactly the formulation described in [ref]5 (where SIMs are used for the Encoder, Prior and Decoder), except we use a fixed standard gaussian distribution as our target encoder distribution instead leaving it unconstrained. The same is true for our CVAE model, and LookOut. This is because it allows our DPP, DLow and LookOut models to more easily learn to fit and map to the distribution of the latent space, making training much more tractable."
