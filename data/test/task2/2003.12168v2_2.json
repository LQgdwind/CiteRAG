    "ii related work": "The importance of generalization, i.e. measuring how well a process model represents the underlying system, is well-known   . This stems from the difficulty of deriving the unknown system from a observation sample of limited size. To date, only a few approaches measuring generalization have been proposed. Van der Aalst et al.  suggested a method which is based on trace alignments. The measure builds on the probability of observing a new path when visiting the same process state the next time. When the average probability is low, the generalization is assumed to be high. However, this metric ignores whether a generated path is realistic, but focuses on the structural properties of the process model. Thus, this approach does not provide insights into the actual underlying system. Buijs et al.  developed a measurement that assumes that a process model is likely to represent the underlying system if all parts of the model are frequently used. The method quantifies how often certain parts of a model are used when replaying an event log. Similar to , this method does not consider if unseen but replayable behavior is likely to be realistic and focuses on structural assumptions only. Therefore, it fails to measure the extent to which a process model represents the behavior of the system. A further approach has been proposed by vanden Broucke et al.  utilizing artificial negative events. This method, which is called Negative Event Generalization, is based on allowed and disallowed generalizations that can be replayed by a process model. Therefore, generalized events refer to process steps that were not recorded in a log and not considered as negative events in a given context. Such events are presumably realistic system events. However, negative events are generated using an algorithm that checks if certain negative events do occur and were preceded with a similar execution history observed in the log. Hence, this method does not generalize unobserved behavior to full extent by allowing comparatively small variations of the recordings in the event log. Similarly, van Dongen et al. introduced an approach that is based on anti-alignments [ref]7. Anti-alignments are alignments that significantly differ from realistic ones. It is assumed that a likely possible behavior is directly reasoned by measuring the distance to anti-alignments. Therefore, process models that add new behavior without introducing new states are preferred and considered well-generalizing. However, this method ignores whether a behavior has not been observed in an event log . To accurately argue how well a process model generalizes, full knowledge about the underlying system must be given. Hence, the existence of a system model in a controlled experiment is assumed such that synthetic event logs can be generated . Measuring generalization can then be reduced to the similarity between discovered process models and the system model   using standard notations. Jannsenswillen and Depaire  concluded that none of the existing methods do reliably measure generalization as required. A similar outcome is reported in . This shows the importance of this paper that develops a novel generalization approach by approximating the system model from an event log. The proposed AVATAR methodology leverages the properties of GANs which can theoretically unveil underlying true data distribution [ref]11."
