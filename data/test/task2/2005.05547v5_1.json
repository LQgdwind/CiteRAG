    "motivation": "We investigate a problem at the confluence of two popular topics – graph\nhomomorphisms and signed graphs. Their interplay was first considered in an\nunpublished manuscript of Guenin , and has since become an\nestablished field of study . We now introduce the two topics separately. In the study of computational\naspects of graph homomorphisms, the central problem is one of existence –\ndoes an input graph G𝐺G admit a homomorphism to a fixed target graph H𝐻H?\n(The graphs considered here are undirected graphs with possible loops but no\nparallel edges.)\nThis is known as the graph homomorphism problem. It was shown in \nthat this problem is polynomial-time solvable when H𝐻H has a loop or is\nbipartite, and is NP-complete otherwise. This is known as the dichotomy\nof graph homomorphisms (see ). The core of a\ngraph H𝐻H is a subgraph of H𝐻H with the smallest number of vertices to which\nH𝐻H admits a homomorphism; note that such a subgraph is unique up to\nisomorphism. A graph with a loop has a vertex with a loop as its core, and\na (non-empty) bipartite graph has an edge as its core. Thus an equivalent way\nof stating the graph dichotomy result is that the problem is polynomial-time\nsolvable when the core of H𝐻H has at most one edge, and is NP-complete\notherwise. Now suppose the input graph G𝐺G is\nequipped with lists, L​(v)⊆V​(H),v∈V​(G),formulae-sequence𝐿𝑣𝑉𝐻𝑣𝑉𝐺L(v)\\subseteq V(H),v\\in V(G), and we ask if there is\na homomorphism f𝑓f of G𝐺G to H𝐻H such that each f​(v)∈L​(v)𝑓𝑣𝐿𝑣f(v)\\in L(v). This is known\nas the graph list homomorphism problem. This problem also has a dichotomy\nof possible complexities  – it is polynomial-time solvable\nwhen H𝐻H is a so-called bi-arc graph and is NP-complete otherwise. Bi-arc\ngraphs have turned out to be an interesting class of graphs; for instance,\nwhen H𝐻H is a reflexive graph (each vertex has a loop), H𝐻H is a bi-arc graph\nif and only if it is an interval graph . These kinds of complexity questions found their most general formulation in\nthe context of constraint satisfaction problems. The Feder-Vardi dichotomy\nconjecture  claimed that every constraint satisfaction problem with\na fixed template H𝐻H is polynomial-time solvable or NP-complete. After a\nquarter century of concerted effort by researchers in theoretical computer\nscience, universal algebra, logic, and graph theory, the conjecture was\nproved in 2017, independently by Bulatov  and Zhuk .\nThis exciting development focused research attention on additional homomorphism\ntype dichotomies, including ones for signed graphs  [ref]8 . The study of signed graphs goes back to  , and has\nbeen most notably investigated in     ,\nfrom the point of view of colourings, matroids, or embeddings. Following\nGuenin, homomorphisms of signed graphs have been pioneered in \nand .\nThe computational aspects of existence of homomorphisms\nin signed graphs — given a fixed signed graph (H,π)𝐻𝜋(H,\\pi), does an input signed\ngraph (G,σ)𝐺𝜎(G,\\sigma) admit a homomorphism to (H,π)𝐻𝜋(H,\\pi) — were studied\nin  , and eventually a complete dichotomy classification was\nobtained in [ref]8. It is surprisingly similar to the second way we\nstated the graph dichotomy result above, see Theorem 5,\nand the discussion following it. Although typically homomorphism problems tend to\nbe easier to classify with lists than without lists (lists allow for recursion\nto subgraphs), the complexity of the list homomorphism problem for signed\ngraphs appears difficult to classify  [ref]8. If the analogy\nto (unsigned) graphs holds again, then the tractable cases of the problem\nshould identify an interesting class of signed graphs, generalizing bi-arc\ngraphs. In this paper, we begin the exploration of this concept, focusing on\nthe case of signed trees. We find that there is interesting structure to the\ntractable cases."
