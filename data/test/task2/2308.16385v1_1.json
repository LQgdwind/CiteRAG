    "appendix a temporal graph datasets": "As shown in Table 2 of the main paper, we select fifteen benchmark databases from diverse domains. All datasets are publicly available under CC BY-NC licence and can be accessed at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HKSFGEfxHDlHuQZ6nK4SLCEMFQIOtzpz?usp=sharing.\nFigure 5 shows\nthe temporal distribution of edges in the evaluated temporal graphs. Reddit is a bipartite interaction graph, consisting of one month of posts made by users on subreddits . Users and subreddits are\nnodes, and egdes are interactions of users writing posts to subreddits. The text of each post is converted into LIWC-feature vector [ref]32 as an edge feature of length 172.\nThis public dataset gives 366 true labels\namong 672,447 interactions, and those true label are ground-truth labels of banned users from Reddit . Wikipedia is a bipartite interaction graph, and contains one month of edits made by editors.\nThis public dataset selects the 1,000 most edited pages as items and editors who made at least 5 edits as users over a month . Editors and pages are nodes, and edges are interactions of editors editing on pages. Edge features of length 172 are interaction edits converted into LIWC-feature vectors [ref]32. Wikipedia dataset treats 217 public ground-truth labels of banned users from 157,474 interactions as positive labels. MOOC is a bipartite MOOC online network\nof students and online course content units 0.\nStudents and courses are nodes, and edges with features of length 4 are interactions of user viewing a video, submitting an answer, etc.\nThis public dataset treats 4,066 dropout events out of 411,749 interactions as positive labels . LastFM is a user-song bipartite network 1.\nUsers and songs are nodes, and edges are user-listens-song interactions.\nThis public dataset includes 1,293,103 interactions between all 1000 users and the 1000 most listened songs . Enron is an email communication network that collects about half a million emails over several years 3.\nNodes of the network are email addresses, and edges are email communication between accounts 4. SocialEvo is a network in which experiments are conducted to closely track the everyday life of a whole undergraduate dormitory with mobile phones.\nThis public dataset is collected by a cell phone application every six minutes, and contains physical proximity and location between students living in halls of residence.\n5. UCI is a facebook-like social network that contains user posts to forums.\nNodes are students (1,899) at University of California, Irvine, and edges are interactions of online messages (59,835) among these users 6.\nEach edge has 100 features. CollegeMsg is provided by the SNAP team of Stanford 7. This dataset is derived from the facebook-like social network introduced in dataset UCI.\nThe SNAP team has parsed it to a temporal network. Each edge has 172 features. CanParl is a Canadian parliament bill voting\nnetwork extracted from open website\n8. Nodes are members of parliament (MPs), and edges are the interactions between MPs from 2006 to 2019. Contact is a temporal and weighted network of physical proximity among the participants 9. Nodes are participant and edges are proximity events between the study participants.\nEdge features indicate the physical proximity between participants . Flights is\na weighted flight network.\nNodes are airports, and edges are tracked flights .\nThe weights of edges indicate the\nnumber of flights between two given airports within a day . UNTrade is a food and agriculture trading weighted network among 181 nations over 30 years .\nNodes are countries, and edges are tradings between two countries.\nThe weights of edges are the total sum of normalized\nagriculture import or export values between two given countries . USLegis is a senate co-sponsorship network that examines the social relations of legislators in their co-sponsorship relationships on bills 8.\nNodes are congress members, and edge weights are the number of times that two members of congress co-sponsor a bill in a given congress . UNVote is a weighted network of roll-call votes in the UN General Assembly 1946-2021 . Nodes are nations, and edge weights are the number of times both nations have voted \"yes\" to an item. Taobao is a subset of the Taobao user behavior dataset intercepted based on the period 8:00 to 18:00 on 26 November 2017 2. This public dataset is a user-item\nbipartite network.\nNodes are users and items, and edges are behaviors between users and items, such as favor, click, purchase, and add an item to shopping cart.\nEach edge has 4 features, corresponding to 4 different types of behaviors ."
