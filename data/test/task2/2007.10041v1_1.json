    "introduction": "A planar straight line graph ΓΓ\\Gamma\n(or PSLG from now on) is the\ndisjoint union of a finite number\n(possibly none) of non-intersecting\nopen line segments (called the edges of ΓΓ\\Gamma)\ntogether with a disjoint finite point set (the vertices\nof ΓΓ\\Gamma)\nthat includes all the endpoints of the line segments,\nbut may include other points as well. If V𝑉V is a finite point set in the plane,\na triangulation of V𝑉V is a PSLG with vertex\nset V𝑉V and a maximal set of edges.\nIf ΓΓ\\Gamma is a PSLG with vertex set\nV𝑉V, then a conforming triangulation for\nΓΓ\\Gamma is a triangulation of a point\nset V′superscript𝑉′V^{\\prime} that contains V𝑉V and such that\nthe union of the vertices and edges of the triangulation\ncovers ΓΓ\\Gamma. We allow V′superscript𝑉′V^{\\prime} to be strictly\nlarger than V𝑉V; in this case V′∖Vsuperscript𝑉′𝑉V^{\\prime}\\setminus V are\ncalled the Steiner points.\nWe want to build conforming triangulations\nfor ΓΓ\\Gamma that have small\ncomplexity (the number of triangles used)\nand good geometry (the shape\nof each triangle; no angles too large or too small),\nbut these two goals are often in conflict.\nIn this paper, we are interested in finding the best\nangle bounds on the triangles that allow us to\npolynomially bound the number of triangles needed\nin terms of n𝑛n, the number of vertices of ΓΓ\\Gamma. If we triangulate a 1×r1𝑟1\\times r rectangle into a fixed\nnumber of elements, it is easy to check that some angles\nmust tend to zero as r→∞→𝑟r\\to\\infty, so there is\nno uniform, strictly positive lower angle bound possible,\nif we want\nthe number of triangles to be bounded only in\nterms of the number of vertices of the given PSLG.\nSince the angles\nof a triangle sum to 180∘superscript180180^{\\circ}, if we had an upper\nbound of 90∘−ϵsuperscript90italic-ϵ90^{\\circ}-\\epsilon on the angles of\na triangulation, then we also have a 2​ϵ2italic-ϵ2\\epsilon lower\nangle bound.\nTherefore, no upper bound strictly less than 90∘superscript9090^{\\circ}\nis possible.\nThus nonobtuse triangulation\n(all angles ≤90∘absentsuperscript90\\leq 90^{\\circ}) is the\nbest we can hope for. In 1960 Burago and Zalgaller  showed that any polyhedral\nsurface has an acute triangulation\n(all angles <90∘absentsuperscript90<90^{\\circ}),\nbut without giving a bound on\nthe number of triangles needed. This was used as a technical\nlemma in their proof of a polyhedral version of the Nash embedding\ntheorem.\nIn 1984 Gerver \nused the Riemann mapping theorem to show that if a polygon’s\nangles all exceed 36∘superscript3636^{\\circ}, then there\nexists a dissection of it into triangles with maximum angle 72∘superscript7272^{\\circ} (in\na dissection, adjacent triangles need not meet along an entire\nedge).\nIn 1988 Baker, Grosse and Rafferty \nagain proved that any polygon has a nonobtuse triangulation,\nand their construction also gives a lower\nangle bound. As noted above, in this case no complexity\nbound in terms of n𝑛n\nalone is possible, although there is a sharp bound in terms of\nintegrating the local feature size over the polygon.\nFor details, see\n,\n\nor the survey . A linear bound for nonobtuse triangulation of point sets was given\nby Bern, Eppstein and Gilbert ,\nand Bern and Eppstein  gave a quadratic\nbound for simple polygons with holes\n(this is a polygonal region where every boundary component\nis a simple closed curve or an\nisolated point). Bern, Dobkin and Eppstein  improved this\nto O​(n1.85)𝑂superscript𝑛1.85O(n^{1.85}) for convex domains.\nBern, S. Mitchell and Ruppert\n gave a O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) algorithm for nonobtuse\ntriangulation of simple polygons with holes in 1994 and\ntheir construction uses only right triangles.\nWe shall make use of their result in this paper.\nThese and related results are discussed in the surveys\n and 0.\nOther papers that deal with algorithms for finding nonobtuse\nand acute triangulations include\n0,\n,\n,\nand .\nGiving a polynomial upper bound for the\ncomplexity of\nnonobtuse triangulation of PSLGs has remained open\n(e.g., see Problem 3 of ).\nWe give such a bound by proving: Every PSLG with n𝑛n vertices\nhas a O​(n2.5)𝑂superscript𝑛2.5O(n^{2.5}) conforming nonobtuse triangulation. Maehara  showed that any\nnonobtuse triangulation\nusing N𝑁N triangles can be refined to an\nacute triangulation (all angles <90∘absentsuperscript90<90^{\\circ})\nwith O​(N)𝑂𝑁O(N) elements.\nA different proof was given by\nYuan 5.\nIn our proof of Theorem 1.1 the triangulation\nwill consist of all right triangles, but the arguments of\nMaehara or Yuan then show the theorem also holds with\nan acute triangulation, at the cost of a\nlarger constant in the O​(n2.5)𝑂superscript𝑛2.5O(n^{2.5}).\nAs noted above, simple examples\ngive a quadratic lower bound for PSLGs (see ),\nso a gap remains between\nour upper bound and the worst known example.\nHowever, this gap can be eliminated in some special cases, e.g., A triangulation of a simple n𝑛n-gon has a\nO​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}) nonobtuse refinement. This improves a O​(n4)𝑂superscript𝑛4O(n^{4}) bound given by Bern and Eppstein\n.\nWe can also approach the quadratic lower bound\nif we consider “almost nonobtuse” triangulations: Suppose θ>0𝜃0\\theta>0.\nEvery PSLG with n𝑛n vertices has a conforming\ntriangulation with\nO​(n2/θ2)𝑂superscript𝑛2superscript𝜃2O(n^{2}/\\theta^{2}) elements and all angles\n≤90∘+θabsentsuperscript90𝜃\\leq 90^{\\circ}+\\theta. This improves a result of S. Mitchell \nwith upper angle bound\n78​π=157.5∘78𝜋superscript157.5\\frac{7}{8}\\pi=157.5^{\\circ} and a result of Tan 7 with\n1115​π=132∘1115𝜋superscript132\\frac{11}{15}\\pi=132^{\\circ}. A triangulation is called Delaunay if whenever two triangles\nshare an edge e𝑒e, the two angles opposite e𝑒e sum to 180∘superscript180180^{\\circ}\nor less. If all the triangles are nonobtuse, then this is certainly the\ncase, so Theorem 1.1 immediate implies Every PSLG with n𝑛n vertices\nhas a O​(n2.5)𝑂superscript𝑛2.5O(n^{2.5}) conforming Delaunay triangulation. This improves a 1993 result of Edelsbrunner and Tan \nthat any PSLG has a conforming Delaunay\ntriangulation of size O​(n3)𝑂superscript𝑛3O(n^{3}).\nConforming Delaunay triangulations for ΓΓ\\Gamma\nare also called Delaunay\nrefinements of ΓΓ\\Gamma. There are numerous papers discussing\nDelaunay refinements including\n,\n1,\n,\n,\n1\nand\n5.\nThe argument in this paper does not seem to\ngive a better estimate for Delaunay triangulations\nthan for nonobtuse triangulations, nor does the proof\nappear to simplify in the Delaunay case.\nFinding an improvement (either for the estimate\nor the argument) in the Delaunay case would be\nextremely interesting. An alternative formulation of the Delaunay condition is that\nevery edge in the triangulation is the chord of an open disk\nthat contains no vertices of the triangulation. We say the\ntriangulation is Gabriel if every edge is the diameter\nof such disk. It is easy to check that a nonobtuse triangulation\nmust be Gabriel, so we also obtain a stronger version of the\nprevious corollary: Every PSLG with n𝑛n vertices\nhas a O​(n2.5)𝑂superscript𝑛2.5O(n^{2.5}) conforming Gabriel triangulation. Given a finite planar point set V𝑉V, and a point\nv∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V, the Voronoi cell corresponding to v𝑣v is\nthe open set of points that are strictly closer to\nv𝑣v than to any other point of V𝑉V. The union of the\nboundaries of the all the Voronoi cells is called\nthe Voronoi diagram of V𝑉V.\nIn 2, it is shown that given a nonobtuse\ntriangulation with N𝑁N elements, one can find a set of O​(N)𝑂𝑁O(N)\npoints so that the Voronoi diagram of the point set covers\nall the edges of the triangulation. Thus we obtain For every PSLG ΓΓ\\Gamma with n𝑛n vertices, there is a point\nset S𝑆S of size O​(n2.5)𝑂superscript𝑛2.5O(n^{2.5}) whose Voronoi diagram covers ΓΓ\\Gamma. The authors of 2 were interested in a type of\nmachine learning called “nearest neighbor learning”.\nGiven ΓΓ\\Gamma and S𝑆S as in the corollary, and any point\nz𝑧z in the plane,\nwe can decide which complementary component\nof ΓΓ\\Gamma z𝑧z belongs to by finding the\nelement w𝑤w of S𝑆S that is closest to z𝑧z; z𝑧z and w𝑤w must\nbelong to the same complementary component of ΓΓ\\Gamma.\nThus the corollary\nsays that a partition of the\nplane by a PSLG of size n𝑛n can be “learned” from a point\nset of size O​(n2.5)𝑂superscript𝑛2.5O(n^{2.5}). This answers a question from\n2 asking if a polynomial number of points\nalways suffices. Acute and nonobtuse triangulations arise in a variety\nof other contexts. In recreational\nmathematics one asks for the smallest\ntriangulation of a given object into acute\nor nonobtuse pieces. For example, a square can obviously be\nmeshed with two right triangles, but less obvious is the\nfact that it can be acutely triangulated\nwith eight elements but not seven; see .\nFor further results of this type see\n3,\n4,\n6,\n7,\n8,\n9,\n,\n,\n3,\n6,\n7,\n8,\nthe 2002 survey 0 and\nthe 2010 survey 9.\nThere is less known in higher dimensions, but\nrecent work has shown\nthere is an acute triangulation of ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3},\nbut no acute triangulation\nof ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}, n≥4𝑛4n\\geq 4\n,\n,\n,\n0,\n1,\n2.\nFinding polynomial bounds for conforming Delaunay tetrahedral meshes\nin higher dimensions remains open. In various numerical methods involving meshes,\na nonobtuse triangulation\nfrequently gives simpler and better behaved algorithms.\nFor example, in 4\nVavasis bounds various matrix norms arising from\nthe finite element method in terms of the number n𝑛n\nof triangulation elements; for general\ntriangulations his estimate is exponential in n𝑛n, but for nonobtuse\ntriangulations it is only linear in n𝑛n.\nOther examples where nonobtuse or Delaunay triangulations give\nsimpler or faster methods include:\ndiscrete maximum principles\n,\n,\n3;\nStieltjes matrices in finite element methods\n,\n6;\nconvenient description of the dual graph ;\nthe Hamilton-Jacobi equation ;\nthe fast marching method 4;\nthe tent pitcher algorithm for meshing space-time\n,\n8,\n9. The ideas in this paper are used in a companion paper\n1\nto obtain conforming quadrilateral meshes for PSLGs\nthat have optimal angle\nbounds and optimal worst case complexity.\nThe precise statement from this paper used in\n1 is Lemma 13.1;\nthis follows from a slight modification of\nthe proof of Theorem 1.3.\nThe result obtained in 1 says\nthat every PSLG has an O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}) conforming quadrilateral mesh with\nall angles ≤120∘absentsuperscript120\\leq 120^{\\circ} and\nall new angles ≥60∘absentsuperscript60\\geq 60^{\\circ}.\nThe angle bounds and\nquadratic complexity bound are both sharp. Many thanks to Joe Mitchell and Estie Arkin for numerous\nconversations about computational geometry in general and\nthe results of this paper in particular. Also thanks to two\nanonymous referees for many helpful comments and suggestions\non two earlier versions of the paper; their efforts\ngreatly improved the presentation in this version. In Section 2 we recall a theorem of\nBern, Mitchell and Ruppert  that connects\nnonobtuse triangulation to finding Gabriel edges, and\nwe sketch the proof of this result in Section 3.\nIn Section 4 we use their theorem to give a simple\nproof of Theorem 1.2. In\nSections 5-8\nwe discuss propagation paths,\ndissections and return regions; these are used in\nthe proofs of both Theorems 1.1 and 1.3.\nSections 9–12\ngive the proof of Theorem\n1.3 and Section 13\nsummarizes facts\nfrom the proof that are used in the sequel paper\n1. Section 14 gives an\noverview of the proof of Theorem 1.1\nand Sections 15–21 provide the details."
