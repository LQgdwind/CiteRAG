Some classical solutions focus on indexing trajectories and performing similarity computation by the alignment of matching sample points. For example, DTW¬† is the first attempt at solving the local time shift issue for computing trajectory similarity. Frechet distance¬† is a classical similarity measure that treats each trajectory as a spatial curve and takes into account the location and order of the sampling points. Further, ERP¬† and EDR¬† are proposed to improve the ability to capture the spatial semantics in trajectories. However, these point-matching methods are inherently sensitive to noise and suffer from quadratic time complexity. EDS¬† and EDwP¬†9 are two segment-matching methods, which operate on segments for matching two trajectories.\nIn recent years, some learning-based algorithms were proposed to speed up the similarity computation. Li et al.¬† propose to learn representations of trajectories in the form of vectors and then measure the similarity between two trajectories as the Euclidean distance between their corresponding vectors.\nSome other studies¬†   define similarity measurements on trajectories based on road segments, to which the trajectories are matched.\nYao et al.¬† employ deep metric learning to approximate and accelerate trajectory similarity computation.\nIn addition, Ma et al.¬†0 propose a similarity measurement called p-distance for uncertain trajectories and study the problem of searching for top-k similar trajectories to a given query trajectory based on p-distance.\nDifferent specialized index techniques are developed for these similarity measures, such as DTW distance¬† , LCSS¬†, ERP¬†, EDR¬†, and EDwP¬†9. However, these index techniques do not generalize to other similarity measures or subtrajectory similarity search.\nIn this paper, we assume an abstract trajectory similarity measurement, which could be instantiated with any of these existing similarity measurements and our techniques still apply.\n (2) Subtrajectory Similarity Related Problems.\nMeasuring subtrajectory similarity is also a fundamental functionality in many tasks such as clustering¬† 6  and similarity join¬†4. Lee et al¬†6 propose a general partition and group framework for subtrajectory clustering. Further, Buchin et al.¬† show the hardness of subtrajectory clustering based on Frechet distance, and Agarwal et al.¬† apply the trajectory simplification technique to approximate discrete Frechet to reduce the time cost of subtrajectory clustering. Recently, Tampakis et al.¬†4 5 proposed a distributed solution for subtrajectory join and clustering by utilizing the MapReduce programming model. Although these algorithms need to consider subtrajectory similarity, similarity computation is not their focus and they usually first segment a trajectory into subtrajectories and employ an existing measure, such as Freechet distance. (3) Subsequence (Substring) Matching. Subsequence matching is a related but different problem. It aims to find a subsequence that has the same length as the query in a given candidate sequence, which usually contains millions or even trillions¬†7 8 of elements. Efficient pruning algorithms¬†0 8 7  1 3  have been proposed for the matching, and these pruning algorithms are generally designed for a specific similarity measure, such as DTW¬†0 8 7  1 5 4 and Euclidean distance¬† 3, and cannot generalize to other measures.\nOn the other hand, substring matching¬†5  often focuses on approximate matching based on the Edit distance. It aims to find a substring in a string to best match the query. Our problem differs from the substring matching problem mainly in two aspects. First, characters in a string have exact match (0 or 1) in the alphabet; however, the points of a trajectory are different. Second, substring matching techniques are usually designed based on the characteristics of strings. e.g.,\ngrammar structure patterns, or word concurrence patterns; however, a trajectory does not have such patterns. (4) Reinforcement Learning. The goal of reinforcement learning is to guide agents on how to take actions to maximize a cumulative reward¬†3 in an environment, and the environment is generally modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP)¬†6. Recently, RL models have been utilized successfully to solve some database related problems. For example, Zhang et al.¬† and Li et al.¬†7 use RL model for automatic DBMS tuning. Trummer et al.¬†6 use RL to learn optimal join orders in the SkinnerDB system. Wang et al.¬† design an effective RL-based algorithm for bipartite graph matching. Overall, there are two types of popular reinforcement learning methods: (1) model-based methods¬† 2 that require to understand the environment and learn the parameters of the MDP in advance, and (2) model-free methods¬†3 1 that make no efforts to learn a model and get feedback from the environment step by step. In this paper, we follow the model-free methods because they are more efficient. Specifically, we make use of a popular reinforcement learning method, namely Deep QùëÑQ Network (DQN)¬†1, for splitting a trajectory into subtrajectories to be candidate solutions for similar subtrajectory search."
