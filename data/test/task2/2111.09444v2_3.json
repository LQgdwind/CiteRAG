    "classical fourier analysis:": "Classical Fourier Analysis on the discrete hypercube focuses on analyzing functions f:{0,1}n‚Üí‚Ñù:ùëì‚Üísuperscript01ùëõ‚Ñùf:\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R} through their Fourier Expansion, a decomposition that breaks fùëìf into a series of orthogonal ‚Äúlevel functions,‚Äù each corresponding to the projection of fùëìf onto a certain eigenspace of the (noisy) hypercube graph.111More generally, these are the eigenspaces of the Hamming scheme. At a basic level, a function‚Äôs Fourier decomposition gives a nice method for understanding its second moment, since orthogonality allows one to move between this and the standard basis freely (a result usually known as Parseval‚Äôs Theorem). On the other hand, in computer science, we are usually interested in analyzing the special class of boolean functions f:{0,1}n‚Üí{0,1}:ùëì‚Üísuperscript01ùëõ01f:\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\to\\{0,1\\}. These functions exhibit rich structure that Parseval‚Äôs Theorem isn‚Äôt equipped to capture‚Äîto understand them, we usually need to look beyond the second moment. Hypercontractivity, introduced in 1970 by Bonami [ref]12 (and later independently by Beckner  and Gross ), is exactly the tool for the job. In its simplest form, hypercontractivity boils down to the statement that the fourth moment of low levels of the Fourier decomposition should behave nicely. Namely that the iùëñith level of a boolean function fùëìf, denoted fisubscriptùëìùëñf_{i}, should satisfy: This deceptively simple observation, known in the above form as ‚ÄúBonami‚Äôs Lemma‚Äù [ref]12, led to many landmark results including the KKL Theorem , noise-sensitivity of sparse functions , Friedgut‚Äôs Junta Theorem , and Majority is Stablest . What‚Äôs more, hypercontractivity (and its resulting applications) actually extend beyond the hypercube. After KKL‚Äôs seminal work, many authors studied extensions and applications of hypercontractivity [ref]10  [ref]28 , but it wasn‚Äôt until recently that tight analogs of Equation¬†1 were developed for general product spaces  as well as for other structured domains such as the symmetric group  and Grassmannian . These extended domains differ from the hypercube in that they are only hypercontractive for special classes of pseudorandom functions, but are nevertheless responsible for an impressive set of applications including analogs of classical results, a variety of new sharp threshold theorems   , and perhaps most famously the proof of the 2-2 Games Conjecture      . Unfortunately, despite the stark similarities between these settings, no unified theory explaining the phenomenen exists. Further, all known techniques rely heavily on product structure or other strong forms of symmetry, which makes it difficult to approach the problem in more general settings."
