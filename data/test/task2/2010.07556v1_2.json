    "ii-b image analysis in other fields": "Convolution neural networks are becoming a standard tool in\nautomated image analysis. We provide here several references that use\nsimilar methods as used in this work.   developed a CNN\narchitecture to detect cracks in steel. The proposed architecture is\ncompared with a method that use hand-crafted feature description. A neural network architecture has been proposed to identify cracks on\nthe road, [ref]23. It has been demonstrated that the\nmethod outperforms methods based on SVM and Boosting. [ref]24 [ref]24 use\nencoder-decoder neural networks to extract agriculture field\nboundaries from satellite images. \n use U-net with VGG11 encoder network to\nsegment satellite images in the Inria Aerial Image Labelling Dataset\n. Image segmentation is an important topic in medical image analysis as\nwell. \n performs semantic segmentation of the\nbrain tumours using MRI imaging. They explore the possibility to combine a\nsimple CNN in a cascaded fashion. \n use deep neural network to classify\ndifferent types of skin cancer. \n use combination of CNN and Recurrent Neural\nNetworks (RNN) to identify a surgical tool location in medical\nimaging.   adapt\nthe U-net encoder-decoder style architecture for the 3-dimensional\ninput signal of the MRI images."
