  "sections": {
    "related work": "Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks 8 at a large scale , over multiple sources of heterogeneous data 0, and over multiple learning objectives 0. Recent methods aim to improve the efficiency of federated learning [ref]7, perform learning in a one-shot setting , propose realistic benchmarks , and reduce the data mismatch between local and global data distributions . While several specific algorithms have been proposed for heterogeneous data, LG-FedAvg is a more general framework that can handle heterogeneous data from new devices, reduce communication complexity, and ensure fair representation learning. We compare with these existing baselines and show that LG-FedAvg outperforms them in heterogeneous settings. Distributed Learning is a related field with similarities and key differences: while both study the theory and practice involving the partition of data and aggregation of updates  2, federated learning is additionally concerned with data that is private and distributed in a non-i.i.d. fashion. Recent work has improved communication efficiency by sparsifying the data and model 4, developing efficient gradient methods 5 , and compressing the updates 3. These compression techniques are complementary to our approach and can be applied to our local and global models. Representation Learning involves learning features from data for generative and discriminative tasks. A recent focus has been on learning fair representations 7,\nincluding using adversarial training  to learn representations that are not informative of private attributes   such as demographics  and gender 6. A related line of research is differential privacy which constraints statistical databases to limit the privacy impact on individuals whose information is in the database  . Our approach extends recent advances in adapting federated learning for heterogeneous data and fairness. LG-FedAvg is a general framework that can handle heterogeneous data from new devices, reduce communication complexity, and ensure fair representation learning."
