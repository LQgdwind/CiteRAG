    "i-a related works": "In the existing literature, there are a limited number of constructions of a probabilistic monad based on random variables, and notably, all of them use definitions that are significantly different from ours. In , a Random Choice Functor (RC) is proposed, which uses an alternative representation for random variables. In this framework, a random variable is defined as a pair consisting of a domain and a function. This approach leads to a scenario where a single random variable, in our setting, corresponds to several different representations in the RC framework. More critically, the morphisms defining the monad on RC do not preserve the equivalence relation between random variables as defined in our paper. Consequently, these morphisms have no correspondence in our setting. In addition, there is no discussion of the commutativity of the monad in . In  a strong monad of random variables has been constructed, albeit with a more complicated definition. This monad construction defines objects whose elements are pairs composed of a random variable and a probabilistic measure on the sample space. Furthermore, to form a monad, not all probabilistic measures on the sample space are allowed; specific additional constraints are required. In contrast, our construction of a monad involves considering any continuous function from the sample space to a given domain as a potential random variable, using a single, fixed measure on the sample space.\nAnother important difference between our work and that of  concerns the nature of the sample spaces. The sample space in  is a Scott domain, consisting of finite and infinite sequences of bits. Conversely, in our approach, the sample space is defined as a Hausdorff topological space. Because of these fundamental differences, the natural transformations that define the monad in our framework differ markedly from those in . Domains of random variables with a structure quite similar to that of the present paper are defined on  , but no monad construction was presented there. As already mentioned, there exists a large literature on denotational models for probabilistic computation. As previously stated, all these works differ substantially from ours, first by the fact that they do not use random variables and, instead, model probabilistic computation using probabilistic measure    , or continuous distribution  [ref]4; and secondly by the fact that these works do not use Scott domains but instead employ a larger class of dcpo’s [ref]4  or categories built starting from measurable spaces   ."
