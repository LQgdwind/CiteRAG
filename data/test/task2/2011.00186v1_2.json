    "ii-c unsupervised representation learning for nas": "Unsupervised representation learning methods fall into to two categories - generative and discriminative [ref]9.\nThe learning objective of existing generative unsupervised learning methods for NAS, arc2vec [ref]8 and NASGEM , is to reconstruct the input neural architectures using an encoder-decoder network, which has little relevance to NAS. Moreover, the arc2vec [ref]8 adopts the variational autoencoder  to embed the input neural architectures into a high dimensional continuous feature space, and the feature space is assumed to follow the Gaussian distribution. Since there is no guarantee that the real underlying distribution of the feature space is Gaussian, this assumption may harm the representation of neural architectures. The NASGEM  adds a similarity loss to improve the feature representation. However, the similarity loss only considers the adjacency matrix of the input neural architecture and ignores the node operations, resulting in the failure to identify isomorphic graphs. We present two self-supervised learning methods to the domain of NAS. The first one is inspired by unsupervised graph representation learning. GMNs [ref]36 adopts graph neural network as building blocks and presents a cross-graph attention-based mechanism to predict the similarity of the two input graphs. SimGNN  takes two graphs as input, embeds the graph and each node of the graph into the feature space using a graph convolutional neural network, and then uses graph feature similarity and node feature similarity to predict the similarity of the input graphs. UGRAPHEMB  takes two graphs as input, adopts graph isomorphism network (GIN)  to embed the input graphs into feature space, and utilizes a multi-scale node attention mechanism to predict the similarity of the input graphs. Our work is quite like UGRAPHEMB, but we design a new neural network model without using the complex multi-scale node attention and apply the unsupervised learning to the field of neural architecture representation learning. The second method is inspired by the contrastive learning for image classification. The contrastive learning used in image classification forces the image and its transformations to be similar in the feature space [ref]9  . Since there is no guarantee that a neural architecture and its transformed form will have the same performance metrics, it is not reasonable to directly apply the contrastive learning for image classification to the NAS domain. We propose a new contrastive learning algorithm, central contrast learning, to learn meaningful representation of neural architectures. To our best knowledge, this is the first study applying contrastive learning to the NAS domain and the field of unsupervised graph similarity learning."
