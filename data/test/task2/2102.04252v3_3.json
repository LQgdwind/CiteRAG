  "title": "HINT: Hierarchical Interaction Network for Clinical Trial Outcome Prediction",
  "sections": {
    "introduction": "Clinical trial is an indispensable step towards developing a new drug, where human participants are tested in responding to a treatment (e.g., a drug or drug combinations) for treating target diseases. The costs of conducting clinical trials are extremely expensive (up to hundreds of millions of dollars ) and the time to run a trial is very long with low success probability  .\nHowever, many factors such as the inefficacy of the drug, drug safety issues, and poor trial protocol design can cause the failure of a clinical trial [ref]15. If we were better at predicting the results of clinical trials, we can avoid running trials that will inevitably fail — more resources could be devoted to trials that are more likely to succeed. Fortunately, the online availability of historical clinical trial data, and massive knowledge bases about approved and failed drugs bring a new opportunity for using machine learning models to tackle the key question: Can one predict the success probability of a trial before the trial started? Various data sources on the web can provide important knowledge for predicting the trial outcome. For example, clinicaltrials.gov database222Publicly available at https://clinicaltrials.gov/. has 279K clinical trial records, which describe many important information about clinical trials. In addition, we are able to find the standard medical codes for most of the diseases described in natural language through National Institutes of Health website333Publicly available at https://clinicaltables.nlm.nih.gov/. . DrugBank Database444Publicly available at https://www.drugbank.ca/  contains the biochemical description of many drugs, which allows the computational modeling of drug molecules. Over the years, there have been early attempts in predicting individual components in clinical trials to improve the trial results, including using electroencephalographic (EEG) measures to predict the effect of antidepressant treatment in improving depressive symptoms  , optimizing drug toxicity based on drug-property and target-property features [ref]24, leveraging phase 2 results to predict the phase 3 trial results . Recently, there has been interest in developing a general method for trial outcome prediction. As an initial attempt,  expanded beyond optimizing individual component to predict trial outcomes for 15 disease groups based on disease-only features using statistical modeling.\nDespite these initial efforts, there are several limitations that impede the utility of existing trial outcome prediction models. Limited task definition and study scope. Existing works either focus on predicting individual component of trials [ref]24  [ref]4  such as patient-trial matching or only covering disease groups of which the disease-specific features are available . Although these works are potentially useful for a limited part of the trial design, they do not answer the fundamental problem: will this trial succeed? To the best of our knowledge, there is no work that attempts to solve the general trial outcome prediction problem across different trial phases for many different diseases. Limited features used for prediction. Due to their limited task definition and study scope, existing works often only leverage restricted disease-specific features, which cannot be generalized for other diseases. These works also ignore the facts that trial outcomes are determined by various trial risks including drug safety, treatment efficiency and trial recruitment, where abundant information exist on the web. For example, the biomedical knowledge that provide explicit biochemical structures among drug molecules and previous trials history for certain disease are both ignored by existing studies but deem very useful for trial outcome prediction.\n Failed to explicitly capture the complex relations among trial components and trial outcomes. Due to the limited data and task scope, existing methods often simplify\ntheir predictions by limited input features and use simple computational method that is not explicitly designed for trial outcome prediction [ref]24  [ref]4  . This significantly impedes them to model the complicated relations among various trial components. Our Approach.\nTo provide accurate trial outcome prediction for all trials, we propose a Hierarchical Interaction Network (HINT). HINT has an input embedding module to encode data from various web sources including drug molecules, disease information and trial protocols, where an imputation module is designed to handle missing data. Next, these embeddings are fed into the knowledge embedding module to generate knowledge embeddings that are pretrained using external knowledge on pharmaco-kinetic properties and trial risk from the web. Then the interaction graph module will connect all the embeddings via domain knowledge to fully capture various trial components and their complex relations as well as their influences on trial outcomes. Based on that, HINT learn a dynamic attentive graph neural network to predict trial outcome. Contribution. Our main contributions are listed as follows: Problem We formally define a model framework for a general clinical trial outcome prediction task, which not only models various trial risks including drug safety, treatment efficiency and trial recruitment, but also models a wide range of drugs and indications (e.g., diseases). Our model framework can generalize over new trials given the drug, disease and protocol information (Section 3.1). Benchmark To enable general clinical trial outcome predictions, we leverage a comprehensive set of datasets from various public web sources, including drug bank, standard disease code and clinical trial records and curate a public-available clinical trial outcome prediction dataset TOP. This benchmark dataset will be released and open-sourced to the community to advance machine learning-aided clinical trial design soon after the review process (Section 4). Method We design a machine learning method that explicitly simulates each clinical trial component and the complicated relations among them (Section 3.2-3.6).\n We evaluated HINT against state-of-the-art baselines using real world data.\nHINT achieved 0.772, 0.607, 0.623 with PR-AUC on Phase I, II, III level prediction respectively and 0.703 on indication-level prediction. These high absolute scores suggest the practical usage of HINT in predicting clinical trial outcome in various stages of the trials. In addition, HINT has up to 12.4% relatively improvement in terms of PR-AUC compared with best baseline method (COMPOSE) . We also conduct ablation study to evaluate the importance of key components of clinical trials to the prediction power and the effectiveness of the hierarchical formulation of a trial interaction graph. At last, we conduct a case study to show the potential real world impact of HINT by successfully predicting the failure of some recent huge trial efforts."
