    "preliminaries": "Graphs. We refer the reader to  for basic background on graph theory, and recall here only some useful definitions. We consider only undirected graphs without loops nor multiple edges. We will use n𝑛n and m𝑚m for denoting the number of vertices and edges, respectively, of the input graph of the problem under consideration.\nWe denote by u​v𝑢𝑣uv an edge between vertices u𝑢u and v𝑣v. For a graph G𝐺G and a vertex set S⊆V​(G)𝑆𝑉𝐺S\\subseteq V(G), we use the shortcut G∖S𝐺𝑆G\\setminus S to denote G​[V​(G)∖S]𝐺delimited-[]𝑉𝐺𝑆G[V(G)\\setminus S].\nThe distance between two vertices u𝑢u and v𝑣v in a graph G𝐺G is the number of edges of a shortest path between u𝑢u and v𝑣v. The diameter of G𝐺G is the maximum distance over all pairs of vertices of G𝐺G. For a vertex v𝑣v in G𝐺G and a positive integer k𝑘k, we denote by Nk​(v)subscript𝑁𝑘𝑣N_{k}(v) the set of vertices of G𝐺G within distance at most k𝑘k from v𝑣v, and we let Nk​[v]=Nk​(v)∪{v}subscript𝑁𝑘delimited-[]𝑣subscript𝑁𝑘𝑣𝑣N_{k}[v]=N_{k}(v)\\cup\\{v\\}. We abbreviate N1​(v)subscript𝑁1𝑣N_{1}(v) and N1​[v]subscript𝑁1delimited-[]𝑣N_{1}[v] as N​(v)𝑁𝑣N(v) and N​[v]𝑁delimited-[]𝑣N[v], respectively, and we let d​(v)=|N​(v)|𝑑𝑣𝑁𝑣d(v)=|N(v)| be the degree of v𝑣v in G𝐺G. A tree is a connected acyclic graph, and a leaf in a tree is a vertex of degree one. For two non-negative integers a𝑎a and b𝑏b, we denote by [a,b]𝑎𝑏[a,b] the set containing every integer c𝑐c such that a≤c≤b𝑎𝑐𝑏a\\leq c\\leq b and we let [a]=[1,a]delimited-[]𝑎1𝑎[a]=[1,a]. If a set S𝑆S is partitioned into pairwise disjoint sets S1,…,Sksubscript𝑆1…subscript𝑆𝑘S_{1},\\dotsc,S_{k}, we denote it by S=S1⊎⋯⊎Sk𝑆⊎subscript𝑆1⋯subscript𝑆𝑘S=S_{1}\\uplus\\dots\\uplus S_{k}. Convexity. Activation problems appear in the literature under a number of different names, such as r𝑟r-neighbor bootstrap percolation         2, dynamic monopolies  5 8 6 , irreversible conversion  7 3 6, or graph convexities, and were studied by researchers of various fields.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, in the particular case in which all thresholds are equal to 222, generalized TSS model is also called 222-neighbor bootstrap percolation or P3subscript𝑃3P_{3}-convexity, which is studied in the field of graph convexities. A finite graph convexity 7 is a pair (G,𝒞)𝐺𝒞(G,\\mathcal{C}) consisting of a finite simple graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) and a set 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} of subsets of V𝑉V (called convex sets) satisfying that ∅,V∈𝒞𝑉𝒞\\emptyset,V\\in\\mathcal{C} and that if C1,C2∈𝒞subscript𝐶1subscript𝐶2𝒞C_{1},C_{2}\\in\\mathcal{C}, then C1∩C2∈𝒞subscript𝐶1subscript𝐶2𝒞C_{1}\\cap C_{2}\\in\\mathcal{C}. In words, ∅\\emptyset and V𝑉V are convex sets and the intersection of convex sets is a convex set. The convex hull H𝒞​(S)subscript𝐻𝒞𝑆H_{\\mathcal{C}}(S) of a set S𝑆S is the minimum convex set containing S𝑆S, that is, H𝒞​(S)subscript𝐻𝒞𝑆H_{\\mathcal{C}}(S) is the intersection of all convex sets containing S𝑆S. When H𝒞​(S)=Vsubscript𝐻𝒞𝑆𝑉H_{\\mathcal{C}}(S)=V then S𝑆S is a hull set of G𝐺G.\nSome well-studied graph convexities are the so-called path convexities, such as the P3subscript𝑃3P_{3}-convexity 7, geodesic convexity 8, and monophonic convexity 3. In the following, we show that instances of the generalized TSS model\ninduce graph convexities in most cases. Let (G,τ)𝐺𝜏(G,\\tau) be an instance of the generalized TSS model, where G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) is a graph and τ:V→ℕ:𝜏→𝑉ℕ\\tau:V\\to\\mathbb{N} is a generalized threshold function. For every set S⊆V𝑆𝑉S\\subseteq V, let the interval Iτ​(S)⊇S𝑆subscript𝐼𝜏𝑆I_{\\tau}(S)\\supseteq S be the union of the set S𝑆S with the set of all vertices v𝑣v outside S𝑆S which have τ​(v)𝜏𝑣\\tau(v) neighbors in S𝑆S. From this, let 𝒞τsubscript𝒞𝜏\\mathcal{C_{\\tau}} be the family of subsets S𝑆S of V𝑉V such that Iτ​(S)=Ssubscript𝐼𝜏𝑆𝑆I_{\\tau}(S)=S (that is, no vertex v𝑣v outside S𝑆S has τ​(v)𝜏𝑣\\tau(v) neighbors in S𝑆S). Given an instance (G,τ)𝐺𝜏(G,\\tau) of the generalized TSS model, where G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) is a graph and τ:V→ℕ:𝜏→𝑉ℕ\\tau:V\\to\\mathbb{N} is a generalized threshold function in G𝐺G, the pair (G,𝒞τ)𝐺subscript𝒞𝜏(G,\\mathcal{C}_{\\tau}) is a graph convexity if and only if V=∅𝑉V=\\emptyset or all thresholds are strictly positive. We have to prove that ∅,V∈𝒞τ𝑉subscript𝒞𝜏\\emptyset,V\\in\\mathcal{C}_{\\tau} and that if C1,C2∈𝒞τsubscript𝐶1subscript𝐶2subscript𝒞𝜏C_{1},C_{2}\\in\\mathcal{C}_{\\tau}, then C1∩C2∈𝒞τsubscript𝐶1subscript𝐶2subscript𝒞𝜏C_{1}\\cap C_{2}\\in\\mathcal{C}_{\\tau}. Clearly V∈𝒞τ𝑉subscript𝒞𝜏V\\in\\mathcal{C}_{\\tau} by vacuity, since there is no vertex outside V𝑉V.\nThus, if V=∅𝑉V=\\emptyset, (G,𝒞τ)𝐺subscript𝒞𝜏(G,\\mathcal{C}_{\\tau}) is a graph convexity, since the only subset S𝑆S of V𝑉V is S=∅=V𝑆𝑉S=\\emptyset=V. So assume that V≠∅𝑉V\\neq\\emptyset. First consider that there is a vertex v𝑣v with threshold τ​(v)=0𝜏𝑣0\\tau(v)=0.\nWith this, we have that S=∅𝑆S=\\emptyset is not convex, since v∉S=∅𝑣𝑆v\\not\\in S=\\emptyset and v𝑣v has τ​(v)=0𝜏𝑣0\\tau(v)=0 neighbors in S=∅𝑆S=\\emptyset. Then (G,𝒞τ)𝐺subscript𝒞𝜏(G,\\mathcal{C}_{\\tau}) is not a graph convexity. Now assume that all thresholds are strictly positive.\nTherefore S=∅𝑆S=\\emptyset is convex, since any vertex v𝑣v does not have τ​(v)𝜏𝑣\\tau(v) neighbors in S=∅𝑆S=\\emptyset. Finally, consider two sets S1,S2∈𝒞τsubscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2subscript𝒞𝜏S_{1},S_{2}\\in\\mathcal{C}_{\\tau} and let S=S1∩S2𝑆subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2S=S_{1}\\cap S_{2}. If S1=Vsubscript𝑆1𝑉S_{1}=V or S2=Vsubscript𝑆2𝑉S_{2}=V, then S=S2𝑆subscript𝑆2S=S_{2} or S=S1𝑆subscript𝑆1S=S_{1}, respectively, and hence S∈𝒞τ𝑆subscript𝒞𝜏S\\in\\mathcal{C}_{\\tau}. So assume that S1≠Vsubscript𝑆1𝑉S_{1}\\neq V and S2≠Vsubscript𝑆2𝑉S_{2}\\neq V, and let v∈V∖S𝑣𝑉𝑆v\\in V\\setminus S. Then v∉S1𝑣subscript𝑆1v\\not\\in S_{1} or v∉S2𝑣subscript𝑆2v\\not\\in S_{2}. Consider v∉S1𝑣subscript𝑆1v\\not\\in S_{1}. Since S1∈𝒞τsubscript𝑆1subscript𝒞𝜏S_{1}\\in\\mathcal{C}_{\\tau}, v𝑣v does not have τ​(v)𝜏𝑣\\tau(v) neighbors in S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} and consequently does not have τ​(v)𝜏𝑣\\tau(v) neighbors in S𝑆S. The case v∉S2𝑣subscript𝑆2v\\not\\in S_{2} is analogous. Then S=S1∩S2⊆𝒞τ𝑆subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2subscript𝒞𝜏S=S_{1}\\cap S_{2}\\subseteq\\mathcal{C}_{\\tau}. In this context, we can also define the activation time tτ​(S)subscript𝑡𝜏𝑆t_{\\tau}(S) of a vertex subset S𝑆S (not necessarily a target set) as the minimum t𝑡t such that Iτt+1​(S)=Iτt​(S)superscriptsubscript𝐼𝜏𝑡1𝑆superscriptsubscript𝐼𝜏𝑡𝑆I_{\\tau}^{t+1}(S)=I_{\\tau}^{t}(S), where Iτk​(S)superscriptsubscript𝐼𝜏𝑘𝑆I_{\\tau}^{k}(S) is the k𝑘k-th iterate of the interval function, defined recursively as Iτ0​(S)=Ssuperscriptsubscript𝐼𝜏0𝑆𝑆I_{\\tau}^{0}(S)=S and Iτk​(S)=Iτk−1​(Iτ​(S))superscriptsubscript𝐼𝜏𝑘𝑆superscriptsubscript𝐼𝜏𝑘1subscript𝐼𝜏𝑆I_{\\tau}^{k}(S)=I_{\\tau}^{k-1}(I_{\\tau}(S)) for k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1. We can also define Hτ​(S)subscript𝐻𝜏𝑆H_{\\tau}(S) as Hτ​(S)=Iτtτ​(S)​(S)subscript𝐻𝜏𝑆superscriptsubscript𝐼𝜏subscript𝑡𝜏𝑆𝑆H_{\\tau}(S)=I_{\\tau}^{t_{\\tau}(S)}(S). This definition of Hτ​(S)subscript𝐻𝜏𝑆H_{\\tau}(S) is useful even when (G,𝒞τ)𝐺subscript𝒞𝜏(G,\\mathcal{C}_{\\tau}) is not a graph convexity (for example, when some thresholds are 0). Recall that a vertex subset S𝑆S is a target set if Hτ​(S)=Vsubscript𝐻𝜏𝑆𝑉H_{\\tau}(S)=V. In this paper, we will use these notations Iτ​(S)subscript𝐼𝜏𝑆I_{\\tau}(S) and Hτ​(S)subscript𝐻𝜏𝑆H_{\\tau}(S). When τ𝜏\\tau is clear in the context, the subscript will be removed from the notations I​(S)𝐼𝑆I(S) and H​(S)𝐻𝑆H(S). The study of complexity aspects related to the computation of graph convexity parameters have been the main goal of various recent papers 1   6 9 .\nFrom Lemma 2.1, all known convexity parameters, such as the Carathéodory number, the Radon number, the Helly number and the convexity number 1 are meaningful in the TSS model and can be investigated in this context. Parameterized complexity. We refer the reader to 2 8 for basic background on parameterized complexity, and we recall here only the definitions used in this article. A parameterized problem is a language L⊆Σ∗×ℕ𝐿superscriptΣℕL\\subseteq\\Sigma^{*}\\times\\mathbb{N}. For an instance I=(x,k)∈Σ∗×ℕ𝐼𝑥𝑘superscriptΣℕI=(x,k)\\in\\Sigma^{*}\\times\\mathbb{N}, k𝑘k is called the parameter. A parameterized problem L𝐿L is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) if there exists an algorithm 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}, a computable function f𝑓f, and a constant c𝑐c such that given an instance I=(x,k)𝐼𝑥𝑘I=(x,k), 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} (called an FPT algorithm) correctly decides whether I∈L𝐼𝐿I\\in L in time bounded by f​(k)⋅|I|c⋅𝑓𝑘superscript𝐼𝑐f(k)\\cdot|I|^{c}. Within parameterized problems, the class \\W may be seen as the parameterized equivalent to the class \\NP of classical decision problems. Without entering into details (see 2 8 for the formal definitions), a parameterized problem being \\W-hard can be seen as a strong evidence that this problem is not FPT. Minors, treewidth, and bounded local treewidth. A graph H𝐻H is a minor of a graph G𝐺G if H𝐻H can be obtained from a subgraph of G𝐺G by contracting edges. A graph class 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C} is minor-closed if whenever a graph G𝐺G belongs to 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C}, all its minors belong to 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C} as well. A graph is planar if it can be drawn in the plane so that its edges may intersect only in the extremities. A graph G𝐺G is an apex graph if it contains a vertex whose removal from G𝐺G results in a planar graph. Let k≥0𝑘0k\\geq 0 be an integer. A graph G𝐺G is a k𝑘k-tree if G𝐺G can be obtained from a clique of size k+1𝑘1k+1 by repeatedly adding vertices adjacent to a clique of size k𝑘k of the current graph. The treewidth of a graph G𝐺G, denoted by 𝗍𝗐​(G)𝗍𝗐𝐺{\\sf tw}(G), is the smallest integer k𝑘k such that G𝐺G is a subgraph of a k𝑘k-tree. A graph class 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C} has bounded local treewidth if there exists a function f:ℕ→ℕ:𝑓→ℕℕf:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N} such that, for every graph G∈𝒞𝐺𝒞G\\in{\\cal C}, every vertex v∈V​(G)𝑣𝑉𝐺v\\in V(G), and every positive integer k𝑘k, 𝗍𝗐​(G​[Nk​[v]])≤f​(k)𝗍𝗐𝐺delimited-[]subscript𝑁𝑘delimited-[]𝑣𝑓𝑘{\\sf tw}(G[N_{k}[v]])\\leq f(k). Examples of graph classes of bounded local treewidth are graphs of bounded treewidth, graphs of bounded degree, planar graphs, or graphs of bounded genus; see 9 for more on bounded local treewidth. The following theorem of Eppstein 6 states that, for minor-closed graph classes, having bounded local treewidth is equivalent to excluding some apex graph. Let 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C} be a minor-closed graph class. Then 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C} has bounded local treewidth if and only if 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C} does not contain all apex graphs. Monadic second-order logic of graphs. The syntax of monadic second-order logic (𝖬𝖲𝖮𝖬𝖲𝖮{\\sf MSO}) of graphs includes the logical connectives ∨\\vee, ∧\\wedge, ¬\\neg, variables for vertices, edges, sets of vertices and sets of edges, the quantifiers ∀,∃for-all\\forall,\\exists that can be applied to these variables, and the binary relations expressing whether a vertex or an edge belong to a set, whether an edge is incident to vertex, whether two vertices are adjacent, and whether two sets are equal. 𝖬𝖲𝖮1subscript𝖬𝖲𝖮1{\\sf MSO}_{1} is the restriction of 𝖬𝖲𝖮𝖬𝖲𝖮{\\sf MSO} where only quantification over sets of vertices (but not edges) is allowed.\nThe following result of Courcelle 7\nis one of the most widely used results in the area of parameterized complexity. Checking whether an 𝖬𝖲𝖮𝖬𝖲𝖮{\\sf MSO} formula ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi holds on an n𝑛n-vertex graph of treewidth at most 𝗍𝗐𝗍𝗐{\\sf tw} can be done in time g​(ϕ,𝗍𝗐)⋅n⋅𝑔italic-ϕ𝗍𝗐𝑛g(\\phi,{\\sf tw})\\cdot n, for a computable function g𝑔g."
