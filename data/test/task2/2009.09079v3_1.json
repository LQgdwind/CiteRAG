    "b.11 potential benefits and applications of the sp system": "Apart from its strengths and potential in modelling AI-related functions (Appendix B.10), it appears that, in more humdrum terms, the SP System has several potential benefits and applications, several of them described in peer-reviewed papers. These include: Big data. Somewhat unexpectedly, it has been discovered that the SP System has potential to help solve nine significant problems associated with big data . These are: overcoming the problem of variety in big data; the unsupervised learning of structures and relationships in big data; interpretation of big data via pattern recognition, natural language processing; the analysis of streaming data; compression of big data; model-based coding for the efficient transmission of big data; potential gains in computational and energy efficiency in the analysis of big data; managing errors and uncertainties in data; and visualisation of structure in big data and providing an audit trail in the processing of big data. Autonomous robots. The SP System opens up a radically new approach to the development of intelligence in autonomous robots ; An intelligent database system. The SP System has potential in the development of an intelligent database system with several advantages compared with traditional database systems . In this connection, the SP System has potential to add several kinds of reasoning and other aspects of intelligence to the ‘database’ represented by the World Wide Web, especially if the SP Machine were to be supercharged by replacing the search mechanisms in the foundations of the SP Machine with the high-parallel search mechanisms of any of the leading search engines. Medical diagnosis. The SP System may serve as a vehicle for medical knowledge and to assist practitioners in medical diagnosis, with potential for the automatic or semi-automatic learning of new knowledge ; Computer vision and natural vision. The SP System opens up a new approach to the development of computer vision and its integration with other aspects of intelligence. It also throws light on several aspects of natural vision [ref]48; Neuroscience. As outlined in Appendix B.8, abstract concepts in the SP Theory of Intelligence map quite well into concepts expressed in terms of neurons and their interconnections in a version of the theory called SP-Neural (, [45, Chapter 11]). This has potential to illuminate aspects of neuroscience and to suggest new avenues for investigation. Commonsense reasoning. In addition to the previously-described strengths of the SP System in several kinds of reasoning, the SP System has strengths in the surprisingly challenging area of “commonsense reasoning”, as described by Ernest Davis and Gary Marcus . How the SP System may meet the several challenges in this area is described in . Other areas of application. The SP System has potential in several other areas of application including [ref]51: the simplification and integration of computing systems; best-match and semantic forms of information retrieval; software engineering [ref]55; the representation of knowledge, reasoning, and the semantic web; information compression; bioinformatics; the detection of computer viruses; and data fusion. Mathematics. The concept of ICMUP provides an entirely novel interpretation of mathematics . This interpretation is quite unlike anything described in existing writings about the philosophy of mathematics or its application in science. There are potential benefits in science from this new interpretation of mathematics."
