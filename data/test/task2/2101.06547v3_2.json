  "title": "LookOut: Diverse Multi-Future Prediction and Planning for Self-Driving",
  "sections": {
    "experimental setup": "ATG4D  is composed of over one million frames of LiDAR, HD maps with very accurate object tracks. It was collected with careful expert drivers in several North American cities. All models are trained to predict 5-second trajectories, given 1 second of LiDAR history. We evaluate motion forecasting in the test set of this dataset. We use a simulated LiDAR environment  for closed-loop experiments where we evaluate the quality of our end-to-end\ndriving model, recreated from real static environments and actors. These scenarios are curated from real driving logs to be particularly challenging, and they do not overlap with those in ATG4D in order to evaluate generalization. When replaying the scenario, the actors switch to reactive actors  if the scenario diverges from the original one due to SDV actions. The simulation is unrolled for ∼similar-to\\sim18 seconds at intervals of 100 milliseconds, which is the same time it takes to acquire a new LiDAR sweep in the data collection vehicle.\nWe note that all training happens on real offline data, but it transfers well to the simulated environment due to its high realism. For motion forecasting, we use state-of-the-art baselines in multi-modal and diverse prediction, all of them trained end-to-end with the same backbone network and object detector architectures for a fair comparison, following the experimental setup in  [ref]5.\nMultiPath , CVAE , CVAE-DPP 6 and CVAE-DLow 7 model the distribution over each actor’s future trajectories independently. Thus, to construct a scene sample for these baselines we sample a random trajectory for each actor, following [ref]5.\nFor approaches that model the joint distribution over all actors’ future trajectories, we benchmark against ESP  and ILVM [ref]5.\nTo compare LookOut to the baselines in the motion planning task, we use the state-of-the-art PLT planner  (Eq. 12) for those motion forecasting models that did not propose a planner. We measure the collision rate (CR) to reflect the driving safety. This is the percentage of simulations in which there is at least 1 collision between the SDV and another actor.\nWe also evaluate the progress made by the SDV on its desired route throughout the simulation horizon, measured in meters from the starting location, as well as the progress per collision, giving an idea of the ratio between non-conservativeness and safety.\nFinally, we measure the mean jerk and acceleration applied as a metric of the driving comfort.\nAs the autonomy unrolls its own actions for long time periods, potentially diverging from the path the expert-driver executed, these metrics capture the quality of the end-to-end system, including its robustness to distributional shift . In the open-loop evaluations, our model is evaluated on real data from the logs in the ATG4D dataset (i.e., the scenes visited by the expert driver), as opposed to closed-loop evaluations where we unroll our own plans.\nTo evaluate the object detection quality we measure the standard mean-average precision (mAP), but defer the results to the supplementary because all the models share the same perception backbone architecture, and it is not the focus of this paper.\nTo measure the reconstruction capability and the diversity of the scene-level motion forecasts, we use K=15𝐾15K=15 scene samples, meaning that there are 15 distinct future scenarios predicted, each with 1 trajectory per actor.\nThe minimum scene average displacement error (minSADE) measures how well we recall the ground-truth trajectory, while the mean scene average displacement error (meanSADE) measures the precision of the predicted distribution as proposed in [ref]5.\nTo evaluate how the diversity of these predictions impact the subsequent contingent plans, we measure the pairwise plan average self-distance (meanPlanASD), i.e., the average distance between the contingent plans for 2 distinct futures.\nAdditionally,\nwe also compute the scene average self-distance (meanSASD), which computes the average pairwise distance among scene samples as a way to measure general diversity as proposed by 6 7."
