  "sections": {
    "introduction": "The tremendous amount of big data does not automatically lead to be easily accessed. The difficulty in data access is still one of the top barriers of many data scientists, according to a recent survey¬†.\nIn fact, organizations, such as governments and companies, have intention to publish data to the public or share data to partners in many cases, but they are usually restricted by regulations and privacy concerns. For example, a hospital wants to share its electronic health records (EHR) to a university for research purpose.\nHowever, the data sharing must be carefully reviewed to avoid disclosure of patient privacy, which usually takes several months without guarantee of approval¬†. To address the difficulties, privacy-preserving data publishing has been extensively studied recently to provide a safer way for data sharing¬†   [ref]8  . However, the existing solutions suffer from the limitations on effectively balancing privacy and utility of the released data¬†. Therefore, efforts have been made recently in the database and machine learning communities to apply generative adversarial networks (GAN) to relational data synthesis¬†      [ref]39.\nThe main advantages of GAN are as follows. First, different from the conventional methods¬†  [ref]8  that inject noise to the original data, GAN utilizes neural networks to generate ‚Äúfake‚Äù data directly from noise. Thus, there is no one-to-one relationship between real and synthetic data, which reduces the risk of re-identification attacks¬†.\nMoreover, the adversarial learning mechanism of GAN enables the synthetic data to effectively preserve utility of the original data for supporting down-streaming applications, such as classification and clustering. However, compared with the success of using GAN for image generation¬†, GAN-based relational data synthesis is still in its infancy stage. Despite some very recent attempts¬†      [ref]39, as far as we know, the proposed methods are not compared under the same framework and thus it is hard for practitioners to understand GAN‚Äôs benefits and limitations.\nTo bridge the gaps, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive experimental study that examines applying GAN to relational data synthesis.\nWe introduce a general framework that can unify the existing solutions for GAN-based data synthesis. Based on the framework, we conduct extensive experiments to systemically investigate the following two key questions. Firstly, it remains an unresolved question on how to effectively apply GAN to relational data synthesis. It is worth noting that relational data has its own characteristics that make the adoption very challenging. (i)ùëñ(i) Relational data has mixed data types, including categorical and numerical attributes. (i‚Äãi)ùëñùëñ(ii) Different attributes have correlations. (i‚Äãi‚Äãi)ùëñùëñùëñ(iii) Many real-world datasets have highly imbalanced data distribution. Thus, the state-of-the-art GAN design for image synthesis (e.g., DCGAN¬†) may not perform well for relational data.\nWe review the existing solutions that realize GAN, including neural network design and training strategies, and define a design space by providing a categorization of the solutions. Through exploring the design space, we systemically evaluate the solutions on datasets with various types and provide insightful experimental findings. The second question is whether GAN is more helpful than the existing approaches to relational data synthesis. To answer this, this paper considers various baseline approaches, including a representative deep generative model, variational auto-encoder (VAE)¬† [ref]50, and the state-of-the-art data synthesis approach using statistical models¬† . To provide a comprehensive comparison, we evaluate their performance on both privacy and the utility of the synthetic data.\nMoreover, we also examine whether GAN can support provable privacy protection, i.e., differential privacy¬†.\nBased on the comparison, we analyze the benefits and limitations of applying GAN to relational data synthesis. To summarize, we make the following contributions. (1) We conduct so far the most comprehensive experimental study for applying GAN to relational data synthesis. We formally define the problem and review the existing approaches (Section¬†2). We introduce a unified framework and define a design space that summarizes the solutions for realizing GAN (Sections¬†3, 4 and 5), which can help practitioners to easily understand how to apply GAN. (2) We empirically conduct a thorough evaluation to explore the design space and compare with the baseline approaches (Section¬†6). We make all codes and datasets in our experiments public at Github111https://github.com/ruclty/Daisy.\nWe provide extensive experimental findings and reveal insights on strength and robustness of various solutions, which provide guidance for an effective design of GAN. (3) We find that GAN is highly promising for relational data synthesis, as it empirically provides better tradeoff between synthetic data utility and privacy. We point out its limitations and identify research directions (Section¬†8)."
