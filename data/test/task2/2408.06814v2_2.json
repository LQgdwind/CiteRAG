    "surface reconstruction approaches": "Several algorithms focus on effectively partitioning space into polygonal faces, convex polyhedra, or computing tetrahedralizations based on intersections of planar primitives.\n proposes a framework for reconstructing lightweight polygonal faces from point clouds based on a\nhypothesis plane generation followed by selection through linear solvers such as SCIP 0, GLPK 1, and Gurobi 2.\nHowever, as the complexity of the scene increases, it struggles to generate an accurate scene representation due to the large number of candidate faces.\n employs a shape assembling mechanism utilizing kinetic data structures for space partitioning into convex polyhedra while\nConstrained Delaunay Tetrahedralization (CDT) is computed through the intersections of planar primitives  3.\nDespite largely mitigating the computational inefficiencies, it still struggles with complex and real-world scenes,\ncompromising the scene geometry and generating a large number of polyhedral faces. [ref]28 addresses this issue by utilizing a 3D partitioning data structure with a global and local slicing strategy based on a three-level hierarchy:\nextracting ceiling and floor primitives, selecting wall planes, and recovering all small planes adjacent to the walls.\nThis approach generates a compact structure mesh with the reconstruction of indoor and outdoor environments.\nWhile some algorithms specialize in constructing outdoor buildings 4  5, others focus on indoor properties, leveraging\nmethods like merging boxes based on wall classification , Markov Random Field (MRF) formulation , or voxel-based occupancy grid 6.\nAdditionally, the reconstruction of indoor objects is approached either through traditional surface reconstruction algorithms [ref]28  or by replacing objects with existing models using registration ."
