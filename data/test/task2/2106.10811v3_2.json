    "a.3.3 surface reconstruction on srb": "Implementation details.\nThe input point cloud is first centered to zero and scaled to have maximum norm of one. Then a bounding box that is 1.1 times the size of the shape is selected. Each iteration we sample 15,000 points from the original point cloud and sample 15,000 points uniformly randomly in a bounding box. We train for 10,000 iterations with a learning rate of 5e-5. We report the values for DGP [ref]44, NSP [ref]45 and PHASE/PHASE+FF  from their respective works, and report the results for FFN [ref]39 from Williams et al. [ref]45 and IGR+FF from Lipman et al. . We report the results for SAL , IGR/IGR wo n  and SIREN/SIREN wo n  using their code. Additional quantitative results. \nWe provide additional quantitative results for surface reconstruction on the Surface Reconstruction Benchmark . Table 6 is an extended version of Table 2 from the main paper that includes comparison to additional methods with normal vector supervision. The results show that we are able to achieve the best reconstruction compared to other methods without normal supervision. Additionally,we achieve improved performance when using normal vector supervision compared to a vanilla SIREN and show comparable results to other methods. Additional qualitative results. \nWe provide additional qualitative results for surface reconstruction on the Surface Reconstruction Benchmark . Figure 18 shows visualizations of the output reconstruction of different methods that use normal vector as ground truth as well as methods that do not. It is clear that whenever ground truth normal vectors are not available, DiGS presents a significant improvement and yields comparable results to normal based methods. Ablation study. \nWe investigate the effects of several design choices made for DiGS and report the averages over all shapes in the dataset in Table 7 and individual shapes in Table 8.\nFirst we investigate the influence of the annealing function τ𝜏\\tau. We compare between the case of No annealing: Linear annealing: Step annealing: Here t0subscript𝑡0t_{0} and t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} are expressed as a fraction of training iterations. In our experiments we used the following values: (t0,t1,τ1)=(0.5,0.75,0)subscript𝑡0subscript𝑡1subscript𝜏10.50.750(t_{0},t_{1},\\tau_{1})=(0.5,0.75,0).\nResults show that annealing improves performance with little difference between linear and step annealing. We also investigate the choice of penalty function over the divergence term (with step decay) and compare between L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} and L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}. Here, L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} allows for sparse spatial locations to have high divergence (which is desired because there may be some source or sink point in the gradient vector field) while L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} provides an average low value over the volume. As expected, the results show an advantage for using L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} penalty on the divergence. Furthermore, we evaluate the second order supervision approach presented in Section A.1.4. For that, we estimate the mean curvature using DeepFit  (a recent state-of-the-art method for estimating normals and curvatures) and introduce the mean curvature as ground truth information during training. The results show that, surprisingly, curvature supervision does not provide any benefit. This is due to the noisiness and local support dependency of curvature estimation which may have over smoothed or jittery values that make training inconsistent. Finally, we investigate the effect of the multi-frequency geometric initialization (with step decay and L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} penalty) and show that it produces consistently better performance than all other ablations. This variant is denoted throughout the paper as DiGS, i.e., L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} penalty on the divergence term with step decay and MFGI (Section 4). Note that all ablations were trained without normal vector information. Use of DiGS Loss with other activation functions. \nOur divergence loss is general and can be applied to any network that has second order derivatives defined everywhere. Note that this means it cannot be used with ReLU activations, though we can use smooth approximations such as the SoftPlus activation function (which IGR  uses). \nHowever, our loss is targeted at high frequency architectures such as SIRENs. A drawback of such architectures is the trade off between high fidelity detail and ghost geometries, especially without normal vector supervision. Our loss is particularly beneficial to alleviate this trade-off.\nWe experimented with using our loss paired with SoftPlus and found that it does not provide a boost in performance since the network is already biased towards low frequency solutions (performance reduction of 0.99 dCsubscript𝑑𝐶d_{C}, and 6.34 dHsubscript𝑑𝐻d_{H} on SRB) which SIREN wo n outperforms even without the divergence loss performance boost."
