  "title": "The Complexity of Finding Fair Independent Sets in Cycles",
  "sections": {
    "our contribution": "The present work initiates the study of the complexity of finding independent sets that fairly represent a given partition of the vertex set of a cycle.\nIt is motivated by the computational aspects of combinatorial existence statements, such as the ‘cycle plus triangles’ conjecture of Du et al.  proved by Fleischner and Stiebitz  and its extensions by Aharoni et al. , Alishahi and Meunier , and Black et al. 0.\nAs mentioned before, the challenge of understanding the complexity of the corresponding search problems was explicitly raised by several authors, including Fleischner and Stiebitz , Alon , and Aharoni et al. . In this work we demonstrate that this research avenue may illuminate interesting connections between this family of problems and the complexity class 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}. As an application, we determine the complexity of finding a monochromatic edge in Schrijver graphs colored by fewer colors than the chromatic number. We start by introducing the Fair Independent Set in Cycle Problem, which we denote by Fair-IS-Cycle and define as follows. In the Fair-IS-Cycle problem, the input consists of a cycle G𝐺G and a partition V1,…,Vmsubscript𝑉1…subscript𝑉𝑚V_{1},\\ldots,V_{m} of its vertex set into m𝑚m sets. The goal is to find an independent set S𝑆S of G𝐺G satisfying |S∩Vi|≥12⋅|Vi|−1𝑆subscript𝑉𝑖⋅12subscript𝑉𝑖1|S\\cap V_{i}|\\geq\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot|V_{i}|-1 for all i∈[m]𝑖delimited-[]𝑚i\\in[m]. The existence of a solution to every input of Fair-IS-Cycle is guaranteed by a result of Aharoni et al. [1, Theorem 1.8].\nSince such a solution can be verified in polynomial running-time, the total search problem Fair-IS-Cycle lies in the complexity class 𝖳𝖥𝖭𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{TFNP}.\nWe prove that the class 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA} captures the complexity of the problem. The Fair-IS-Cycle problem is 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}-complete. In view of the ‘cycle plus triangles’ problem of Du et al. , it would be interesting to understand the complexity of the Fair-IS-Cycle problem restricted to partitions into sets of size 333. While Theorem 1.3 immediately implies that this restricted problem lies in 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}, the question of determining its precise complexity remains open. We proceed by considering the search problem associated with Theorem 1.1.\nIn the Fair Splitting of Cycle Problem, denoted Fair-Split-Cycle, we are given a cycle and a partition of its vertex set and the goal is to find two disjoint independent sets that fairly represent the partition and cover all vertices but one from every part of the partition. We define below an approximate version of this problem, in which the fairness requirement is replaced with the relaxed notion of ε𝜀\\varepsilon-fairness, where the independent sets should include at least 12−ε12𝜀\\frac{1}{2}-\\varepsilon fraction of the vertices of every part. In the ε​-Fair-Split-Cycle𝜀-Fair-Split-Cycle\\varepsilon\\textsc{-}\\textsc{Fair-Split-Cycle} problem with parameter ε≥0𝜀0\\varepsilon\\geq 0, the input consists of a cycle G𝐺G on n𝑛n vertices and a partition V1,…,Vmsubscript𝑉1…subscript𝑉𝑚V_{1},\\ldots,V_{m} of its vertex set into m𝑚m sets, such that n𝑛n and m𝑚m have the same parity. The goal is to find two disjoint independent sets S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} and S2subscript𝑆2S_{2} of G𝐺G covering all vertices but one from each Visubscript𝑉𝑖V_{i} such that for each j∈{1,2}𝑗12j\\in\\{1,2\\}, it holds that |Sj∩Vi|≥(12−ε)⋅|Vi|−1subscript𝑆𝑗subscript𝑉𝑖⋅12𝜀subscript𝑉𝑖1|S_{j}\\cap V_{i}|\\geq(\\frac{1}{2}-\\varepsilon)\\cdot|V_{i}|-1 for all i∈[m]𝑖delimited-[]𝑚i\\in[m]. For ε=0𝜀0\\varepsilon=0, the problem is denoted by Fair-Split-Cycle. The existence of a solution to every input of ε​-Fair-Split-Cycle𝜀-Fair-Split-Cycle\\varepsilon\\textsc{-}\\textsc{Fair-Split-Cycle}, already for ε=0𝜀0\\varepsilon=0, is guaranteed by Theorem 1.1 proved in .\nFor ε=0𝜀0\\varepsilon=0, it can be seen that Fair-Split-Cycle is at least as hard as Fair-IS-Cycle (see Lemma 2.10). Yet, it turns out that Fair-Split-Cycle lies in 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA} and is thus also 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}-complete. The Fair-Split-Cycle problem is 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}-complete. In fact, using the recent work 7, we also obtain the following 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}-completeness result for the approximate version of the problem (see Remark 2.9). There exists a constant ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 for which the ε​-Fair-Split-Cycle𝜀-Fair-Split-Cycle\\varepsilon\\textsf{-}\\textsc{Fair-Split-Cycle} problem is 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}-complete. We finally consider the complexity of the Schrijver problem. In this problem we are given a succinct representation of a coloring of the Schrijver graph S​(n,k)𝑆𝑛𝑘S(n,k) with n−2​k+1𝑛2𝑘1n-2k+1 colors, which is one less than its chromatic number , and the goal is to find a monochromatic edge (see Definition 3.1).\nThe study of the Schrijver problem is motivated by a question raised by Deng et al. 9 regarding the complexity of the analogue Kneser problem for Kneser graphs.\nNote that the latter is not harder than the Schrijver problem, because S​(n,k)𝑆𝑛𝑘S(n,k) is a subgraph of K​(n,k)𝐾𝑛𝑘K(n,k) with the same chromatic number.\nAs an application of our Theorem 1.3, we prove the following. The Schrijver problem is 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}-complete. It would be interesting to determine the computational complexity of the Kneser problem and to decide whether it is 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}-complete, as suggested in 9. It would also be interesting to prove unconditional lower bounds on the query complexity of algorithms for the Kneser and Schrijver problems in the black-box input model, where the input is given as an oracle access.\nWe note that the study of the Kneser problem is motivated by its connections to a resource allocation problem called Agreeable Set, that was introduced by Manurangsi and Suksompong 7 and further studied in 1 2.\nFrom an algorithmic point of view, it was shown in the recent works 2 3 that there exist randomized algorithms for the Kneser and Schrijver problems with running time nO​(1)⋅kO​(k)⋅superscript𝑛𝑂1superscript𝑘𝑂𝑘n^{O(1)}\\cdot k^{O(k)} on graphs K​(n,k)𝐾𝑛𝑘K(n,k) and S​(n,k)𝑆𝑛𝑘S(n,k) respectively, hence these problems are fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the parameter k𝑘k. It would be nice to further explore algorithms for these problems as well as for the other problems studied in the current work."
