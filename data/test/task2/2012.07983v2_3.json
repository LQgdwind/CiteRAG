    "gradsat: from walsh-fourier expansions to bdds": "We start this subsection by analyzing some limitations of FourierSAT. First, FourierSAT only accepts symmetric constraints.There are, however, useful constraints that cannot be reduced to symmetric ones, e.g., pseudo-Boolean constraints (PBs). Second, in FourierSAT, computing gradient costs O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) function evaluations [ref]28, which can get expensive for constraints with more than a few hundred variables. The issues above indicate that there might be better representations of Boolean constraints than Walsh-Fourier expansions. In the rest of this section, we discuss how our new framework, GradSAT, addresses those issues by choosing Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) as the representation to evaluate and differentiate the objective. In order to use a new representation of Boolean constraints, we need to have a deeper understanding of the objective function. Theorem 4 in below, adapted from Theorem 3 in [ref]28 indicates the objective value can be interpreted as a measure of the progress of the algorithm. (Randomized rounding) We define the randomized rounding function ℛ:[−1,1]n→{−1,1}n:ℛ→superscript11𝑛superscript11𝑛\\mathcal{R}:[-1,1]^{n}\\to\\{-1,1\\}^{n} by for i∈{1,⋯,n}𝑖1⋯𝑛i\\in\\{1,\\cdots,n\\}, where ℙℙ\\mathbb{P} denotes the probability. (Vector probability space) We define a probability space on Boolean vectors w.r.t. real point a∈[−1,1]n𝑎superscript11𝑛a\\in[-1,1]^{n}, denoted by 𝒮a:{−1,1}n→ :subscript𝒮𝑎→superscript11𝑛01\\mathcal{S}_{a}:\\{-1,1\\}^{n}\\to  by: for b∈{−1,1}n𝑏superscript11𝑛b\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{n},\nwith respect to the randomized-rounding function ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}.\nWe use b∼Sasimilar-to𝑏subscript𝑆𝑎b\\sim S_{a} to denote that b∈{−1,1}n𝑏superscript11𝑛b\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{n} is sampled from the probability space 𝒮asubscript𝒮𝑎\\mathcal{S}_{a}. Given a formula f𝑓f and constraint weight function w:Cf→ℝ+:𝑤→subscript𝐶𝑓superscriptℝw:C_{f}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{+}, for a real point a∈[−1,1]n𝑎superscript11𝑛a\\in[-1,1]^{n}, we have where 𝔼𝔼\\mathop{\\mathbb{E}} denotes expectation.\n For a discrete point b∈{−1,1}n𝑏superscript11𝑛b\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{n}, Ff,w​(b)subscript𝐹𝑓𝑤𝑏F_{f,w}(b) is the sum of weights of all constraints satisfied by b𝑏b. Therefore, Theorem 4 reveals that for a real point a𝑎a, the value Ff,w​(a)subscript𝐹𝑓𝑤𝑎F_{f,w}(a) is in fact the expected solution quality at a𝑎a. Thus, a CLS approach can make progress in the sense of expectation as long as it increases the objective value. Compared with DLS solvers and coordinate descent-based CLS solvers that only flip one bit per iteration, a CLS method is able to \"flip\" multiple variables, though probably by a small amount, to make progress. We now interpret Theorem 4 from the perspective of circuit-output probability. With f,w,a𝑓𝑤𝑎f,w,a as in Theorem 4, we have where Pa:X→ℝ:subscript𝑃𝑎→𝑋ℝP_{a}:X\\to\\mathbb{R} is the variable input probability function defined by Pa​(xi)=1−ai2subscript𝑃𝑎subscript𝑥𝑖1subscript𝑎𝑖2P_{a}(x_{i})=\\frac{1-a_{i}}{2} for all i∈{1,⋯,n}𝑖1⋯𝑛i\\in\\{1,\\cdots,n\\}. Corollary 1 states that to evaluate the objective function, it suffices to compute the circuit-output probability of each constraint. Calculating the circuit-output probability, as a special case of literal weighted model counting, is #P-hard for general representations such as CNF formulas . Nevertheless, if a Boolean function is represented by a BDD B𝐵B of size S​(B)𝑆𝐵S(B), then the circuit-output probability on it can be solved in time O​(S​(B))𝑂𝑆𝐵O(S(B)) by a probability assignment algorithm  shown in Alg. 2. \nAlg. 2 returns the circuit-output probability COP​(P,f)COP𝑃𝑓\\texttt{COP}(P,f), where P≡12𝑃12P\\equiv\\frac{1}{2} and runs in time O​(S​(B))𝑂𝑆𝐵O(S(B)) given the BDD B𝐵B of f𝑓f. Alg. 2 deals with the uniform variable probability, P​(xi)=12𝑃subscript𝑥𝑖12P(x_{i})=\\frac{1}{2} for i∈{1,…,n}𝑖1…𝑛i\\in\\{1,\\dots,n\\}. In the following we adapt it for admitting a general variable input probability function Pa:X→ :subscript𝑃𝑎→𝑋01P_{a}:X\\to . To use the idea of Alg. 2, we need to construct the BDDs for the constraints of f𝑓f. Note that since different constraints can share same sub-functions, equivalent nodes only need to be stored once. In BDD packages such as CUDD , this property is realized by a decision-diagram manager. After combining equivalent nodes, the BDD forest generated from all constraints forms a multi-rooted BDD (MRBDD). The size of the MRBDD can be significantly smaller than the sum of the size of each individual BDD when sub-function sharing frequently appears. Alg. 3 shows how to use ideas above to evaluate our objective Ff,wsubscript𝐹𝑓𝑤F_{f,w}. Alg. 3 returns the correct objective value Ff,w​(a)subscript𝐹𝑓𝑤𝑎F_{f,w}(a) and runs in time O(S(B)), for the MRBDD B𝐵B of f𝑓f. Alg. 3 traverses the MRBDD in a top-down style while the same effect can be achieved by a bottom-up algorithm as well, as shown in Alg. 4. Similar ideas of traversing BDDs bottom-up have been used in BDD-based SAT solving [ref]43 and weighted model counting . Alg. 4 returns the correct objective value Ff,w​(a)subscript𝐹𝑓𝑤𝑎F_{f,w}(a) and runs in time O(S(B)), for the MRBDD B𝐵B of f𝑓f. So far we have demonstrated how to evaluate the objective by BDDs. In the rest of this section we will show the combination of the bottle-up and top-down algorithms inspires an efficient algorithm for gradient computation."
