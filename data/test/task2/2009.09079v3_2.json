    "demonstrations": "Aspects of CSRK may be modelled with the SPCM [57, Sections 4 to 6]: how to interpret a noun phrase like “water bird”; how, under various scenarios, to assess the strength of evidence that a given person committed a murder; how to interpret the horse’s head scene in The Godfather film. A fourth problem—how to model the process of cracking an egg into a bowl—is beyond what can be done with the SP System as it is now [57, Section 9], but fixing the problems mentioned Appendix B.12 may make it feasible. With the SPCM, it is possible to determine the referent of an ambiguous pronoun in a ‘Winograd schema’ type of sentence [ref]56, where a Winograd schema is a pair of sentences like The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence and The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated revolution, and the ambiguous pronoun in each sentence is “they” ."
