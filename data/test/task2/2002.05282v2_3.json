    "overview, motivation, and problem statement": "Visualization is useful in most data intelligence workflows, but the usefulness is not universally true because the effectiveness of visualization is usually data-, user-, and task-dependent.\nThe cost-benefit ratio proposed by Chen and Golan  captures the essence of such dependency.\nBelow is the qualitative expression of the measure: Consider the scenario of viewing some data through a particular visual representation.\nThe term Alphabet Compression (AC) measures the amount of information loss due to visual abstraction .\nSince the visual representation is fixed in the scenario, AC is thus largely data-dependent.\nAC is a positive measure reflecting the fact that visual abstraction must be useful in many cases though it may result in information loss.\nThis apparently counter-intuitive term is essential for asserting why visualization is useful. (Note that the term also helps assert the usefulness of statistics, algorithms, and interaction since they all usually cause information loss . See also Appendix A.) The positive implication of the term AC is counterbalanced by the term Potential Distortion, while both being moderated by the term Cost.\nThe term Cost encompasses all costs of the visualization process, including computational costs (e.g., visual mapping and rendering), cognitive costs (e.g., cognitive load), and consequential costs (e.g., impact of errors).\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1, increasing AC typically enables the reduction of cost (e.g., in terms of energy, time, or money). The term Potential Distortion (PD) measures the informative divergence between viewing the data through visualization with information loss and reading the data without any information loss. The latter might be ideal but is usually at an unattainable cost except for values in a very small data space (i.e., in a small alphabet as discussed in ).\nAs shown in Fig. 1, increasing AC typically causes more PD.\nPD is data-dependent or user-dependent.\nGiven the same data visualization with the same amount of information loss, one can postulate that a user with more knowledge about the data or visual representation usually suffers less distortion.\nThis postulation is a focus of this paper. Consider the visual representation of a network of arteries in Fig. 2.\nThe image was generated from a volume dataset using the maximum intensity projection (MIP) method.\nWhile it is known that MIP cannot convey depth information well, it has been widely used for observing some classes of medical imaging data, such as arteries.\nThe highlighted area in Fig. 2 shows an apparently flat area, which is a distortion from the actuality of a tubular surface likely with some small wrinkles and bumps.\nThe doctors who deal with such medical data are expected to have sufficient knowledge to reconstruct the reality adequately from the ‚Äúdistorted‚Äù visualization, while being able to focus on the more important task of making diagnostic decisions, e.g., about aneurysm. As shown in some recent works, it is possible for visualization designers to estimate AC, PD, and Cost qualitatively [ref]10  and quantitatively  .\nIt is highly desirable to advance the scientific methods for quantitative estimation, towards the eventual realization of computer-assisted analysis and optimization in designing visual representations.\nThis work focuses on one challenge of quantitative estimation, i.e., how to estimate the benefit of visualization to human users with different knowledge about the depicted data and visual encoding. Building on the methods of observational estimation in  and controlled experiment in , one may reasonably anticipate a systematic method based on a short interview by asking potential viewers a few questions.\nFor example, one may use the question in Fig. 2 to estimate the knowledge of doctors, patients, and any other people who may view such a visualization.\nThe question is intended to tease out two pieces of knowledge that may help reduce the potential distortion due to the ‚Äúflat area‚Äù depiction.\nOne piece is about the general knowledge that associates arteries with tube-like shapes.\nAnother, which is more advanced, is about the surface texture of arteries and the limitations of the MIP method. Let the binary options about whether the ‚Äúflat area‚Äù is actually flat or curved be an alphabet ùî∏={curved,flat}ùî∏curvedflat\\mathbb{A}=\\{\\textit{curved},\\textit{flat}\\}.\nThe likelihood of the two options is represented by a probability distribution or probability mass function (PMF) P‚Äã(ùî∏)={1‚àíœµ,0+œµ}ùëÉùî∏1italic-œµ0italic-œµP(\\mathbb{A})=\\{1-\\epsilon,0+\\epsilon\\}, where 0<œµ<10italic-œµ10<\\epsilon<1.\nSince most arteries in the real world are of tubular shapes, one can imagine that a ground truth alphabet ùî∏G.T.subscriptùî∏G.T.\\mathbb{A}_{\\text{G.T.}} might have a PMF P‚Äã(ùî∏G.T.)ùëÉsubscriptùî∏G.T.P(\\mathbb{A}_{\\text{G.T.}}) strongly in favor of the curved option.\nHowever, the visualization seems to suggest the opposite, implying a PMF P‚Äã(ùî∏MIP)ùëÉsubscriptùî∏MIPP(\\mathbb{A}_{\\text{MIP}}) strongly in favor of the flat option.\nIt is not difficult to interview some potential viewers, enquiring how they would answer the question.\nOne may estimate a PMF P‚Äã(ùî∏doctors)ùëÉsubscriptùî∏doctorsP(\\mathbb{A}_{\\text{doctors}}) from doctors‚Äô answers, and another P‚Äã(ùî∏patients)ùëÉsubscriptùî∏patientsP(\\mathbb{A}_{\\text{patients}}) from patients‚Äô answers. Table 1 shows two scenarios where different probability data is obtained. The values of PD are computed using the most well-known divergence measure, KL-divergence , and are of unit bit.\nIn Scenario 1, without any knowledge, the visualization process would suffer 6.50 bits of PD.\nAs doctors are not fooled by the ‚Äúflat area‚Äù shown in the MIP visualization, their knowledge is worth 6.50 bits.\nMeanwhile, patients would suffer 1.12 bits of PD on average, their knowledge is worth 5.38=6.50‚àí1.125.386.501.125.38=6.50-1.12 bits. In Scenario 2, the PMFs of P‚Äã(ùî∏G.T.)ùëÉsubscriptùî∏G.T.P(\\mathbb{A}_{\\text{G.T.}}) and P‚Äã(ùî∏MIP)ùëÉsubscriptùî∏MIPP(\\mathbb{A}_{\\text{MIP}}) depart further away, while P‚Äã(ùî∏doctors)ùëÉsubscriptùî∏doctorsP(\\mathbb{A}_{\\text{doctors}}) and P‚Äã(ùî∏patients)ùëÉsubscriptùî∏patientsP(\\mathbb{A}_{\\text{patients}}) remain the same.\nAlthough doctors and patients would suffer more PD, their knowledge is worth more than that in Scenario 1 (i.e., 13.28‚àí0.05=13.2313.280.0513.2313.28-0.05=13.23 bits and 13.28‚àí3.11=10.1713.283.1110.1713.28-3.11=10.17 bits respectively). Similarly, the binary options about whether the ‚Äúflat area‚Äù is actually smooth or not can be defined by an alphabet\nùî∏={wrinkles-and-bumps,smooth}ùî∏wrinkles-and-bumpssmooth\\mathbb{A}=\\{\\textit{wrinkles-and-bumps},\\,\\textit{smooth}\\}.\nTable 2 shows two scenarios about collected probability data.\nIn these two scenarios, doctors exhibit much more knowledge than patients, indicating that the surface texture of arteries is a piece of specialized knowledge. The above example demonstrates that using the KL-divergence to estimate PD can differentiate the knowledge variation between doctors and patients regarding the two pieces of knowledge that may reduce the distortion due to the ‚Äúflat area‚Äù.\nWhen it is used in Eq.‚Äâ 1 in a relative or qualitative context (e.g., [ref]10 ), the unboundedness of the KL-divergence does not pose an issue. However, this does become an issue when the KL-divergence is used to measure PD in an absolute and quantitative context.\nFrom the two diverging PMFs P‚Äã(ùî∏G.T.)ùëÉsubscriptùî∏G.T.P(\\mathbb{A}_{\\text{G.T.}}) and P‚Äã(ùî∏MIP)ùëÉsubscriptùî∏MIPP(\\mathbb{A}_{\\text{MIP}}) in Table 1, or P‚Äã(ùîπG.T.)ùëÉsubscriptùîπG.T.P(\\mathbb{B}_{\\text{G.T.}}) and P‚Äã(ùîπMIP)ùëÉsubscriptùîπMIPP(\\mathbb{B}_{\\text{MIP}}) in Table 2, we can observe that the smaller œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon is, the more divergent the two PMFs become and the higher value the PD has.\nIndeed, consider an arbitrary alphabet ‚Ñ§={z1,z2}‚Ñ§subscriptùëß1subscriptùëß2\\mathbb{Z}=\\{z_{1},z_{2}\\}, and two PMFs defined upon ‚Ñ§‚Ñ§\\mathbb{Z}: P=[0+œµ,‚Äâ1‚àíœµ]ùëÉ0italic-œµ1italic-œµP=[0+\\epsilon,\\,1-\\epsilon] and Q=[1‚àíœµ,‚Äâ0+œµ]ùëÑ1italic-œµ‚Äâ0italic-œµQ=[1-\\epsilon,\\,0+\\epsilon].\nWhen œµ‚Üí0‚Üíitalic-œµ0\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0, we have the KL-divergence ùíüKL(Q||P)‚Üí‚àû{\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{KL}}}(Q||P)\\rightarrow\\infty. Meanwhile, the Shannon entropy of ‚Ñ§‚Ñ§\\mathbb{Z}, ‚Ñã‚Äã(‚Ñ§)‚Ñã‚Ñ§\\mathcal{H}(\\mathbb{Z}), has an upper bound of 1 bit.\nIt is thus not intuitive or practical to relate the value of ùíüKL(Q||P){\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{KL}}}(Q||P) to that of ‚Ñã‚Äã(‚Ñ§)‚Ñã‚Ñ§\\mathcal{H}(\\mathbb{Z}).\nMany applications of information theory do not relate these two types of values explicitly.\nWhen reasoning such relations is required, the common approach is to impose a lower-bound threshold for œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon (e.g., ).\nHowever, there is yet a consistent method for defining such a threshold for various alphabets in different applications, while preventing a range of small or large values (i.e., [0,œµ)0italic-œµ[0,\\epsilon) or (1‚àíœµ,1]1italic-œµ1(1-\\epsilon,1]) in a PMF is often inconvenient in practice.\nIn the following section, we discuss several approaches to defining a bounded measure for PD. Note: for an information-theoretic measure, we use an alphabet ‚Ñ§‚Ñ§\\mathbb{Z} and its PMF PùëÉP interchangeably, e.g., ‚Ñã‚Äã(P‚Äã(‚Ñ§))=‚Ñã‚Äã(P)=‚Ñã‚Äã(‚Ñ§)‚ÑãùëÉ‚Ñ§‚ÑãùëÉ‚Ñã‚Ñ§{\\mathcal{H}}(P(\\mathbb{Z}))={\\mathcal{H}}(P)={\\mathcal{H}}(\\mathbb{Z})."
