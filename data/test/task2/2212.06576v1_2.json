    "introduction": "The motivation of this work lies in the lack of interpretability and explainability of artificial intelligence (AI) models in security and safety critical applications.\nFor instance, regular traffic signs and any physically realizable trigger modifications represent intended and hidden encoded classes in a classification AI model (e.g., a yellow sticky on top of a STOP traffic sign as a trigger changing the label from the intended STOP to the target 65 m/h traffic sign classes [ref]1).\nOur lack of understanding of how classes are encoded in AI models for classifying traffic signs poses a safety threat in self-driving cars because AI models can contain such injected triggers causing misclassification. In addition to the application-specific motivation, methods for explainable AI are motivated in general by regulatory agencies, end users, decision makers, and engineers as they provide utilities for bias detection, trust in predictions, suitability for deployment, debugging, and recourse , . We introduce the terminology used in this paper early on due to a varying usage of published terms in a broad spectrum of theoretical contributions to AI. We will refer to an AI model as a computation graph that (a) is a directed graph representing a math function and (b) consists of subgraphs. A subgraph is a subset of graph vertices (or graph nodes) connected with edges in the parent graph. Graph nodes of a computation graph are computation units (or graph components) that perform linear or non-linear operations on input data, (e.g., convolution, tangent hyperbolic activation function, and maximum value operation). In our work, the names of the AI models (or architectures) are adopted from literature since we are not creating any custom computation graphs.\nThe input and output data at each computation unit are multidimensional arrays denoted as tensors. When an image from a class cùëêc flows through a computation graph, each computation unit generates real-valued tensors called class activations (the term is derived from an activation function that decides whether a neuron should be activated or not). A tensor generated by input images has dimensions reflecting a number of images (batch size), channels, rows, and columns. For a batch size equal to one, a tensor can be interpreted as a hyperspectral image.\nIn our work, a class activation mapping is thresholding, and binarized channel values in one tensor are denoted as a tensor-state with rows √ó\\times columns of tensor-state values. The objectives of this work are\n(1) to define utilization-based class encodings and AI model fingerprints,\n(2) to measure class encodings in architectures beyond small models (e.g., LeNet model with 60K parameters) and toy datasets, such as MNIST (Modified NIST dataset with 70K images of size 28√ó28282828\\times 28 pixels), and\n(3) to identify encoding patterns (motifs) that discriminate AI models without and with hidden classes (denoted as clean and poisoned AI models).\nOur ultimate objective is to identify and decompose AI model computation graphs into subgraphs (subnetworks) that serve specific detection, segmentation, classification, or recognition purposes.\nBuilding a library of subgraphs with semantic interpretations, such as a subgraph for wheel detection, creates opportunities to custom-design AI architectures for specific training datasets and avoid exploring a huge search space of graphs as done in the work of Ying et al. .\nThis objective is aligned with the search for visual patterns in a collection of visualizations of AI layers and neurons under the OpenAI Microscope project [ref]5.\nBy understanding class encoding patterns, one can additionally benefit from reduced AI model storage and inference computational requirements via more efficient network architecture search  with advanced hardware [ref]6. Furthermore, one can improve expressiveness of AI model architectures via design  and efficiency measurements  or one can assist in diagnosing failure modes . This work addresses the problems of (a) designing utlization measurements of trained AI models and (b) explaining how training data are encoded in AI models based on those measurements.\nWe approach the problems and address the three objectives as follows: Define a class encoding by introducing a utilization measurement at each computation unit in an AI model computation graph. Form a class encoding as a vector of utilization measurements at all computation units of an AI model. Search for class encoding patterns by training and analyzing clean and poisoned AI models together with their training datasets, as well as by visualizing their patterns in AI model computation graphs, subgraphs, and tensor-state spaces. Conceptually, utilization of any computation unit is related to a ratio of the number of different outputs (tensor-state values) activated by all training data points over the maximum number of possible outputs by the computation unit. Such utilization-based class encodings are useful as statistical representations of complex trained AI models for (a) classifying a large number of AI models as clean or poisoned, and (b) reducing the search space for understanding class‚Äôs unique and overlapping patterns. We use a set of tensor-states at each graph node and for each training image as a baseline representation of one trained AI model. With such a baseline representation, one can visually validate correctness of any conclusions derived from utilization-based class encodings for varying class characteristics, application-specific datasets, and AI model architectures. Figure¬†1 shows a high-level workflow for identifying discriminating patterns of class encodings in clean and poisoned AI models.\nThe left side in Figure¬†1 illustrates \"Training Dataset\" consisting of clean (Class A) and poisoned (Class B) training images with a small red polygon denoted as a trigger (or poison). The left side could also be replaced with two clean classes as we aim to identify patterns of class encodings unique to each class and common for any two classes.\nTraining images representing each class are inferenced. During the inference of images from the same class, a vector of utilizations over all graph computation units is recorded and denoted as a class encoding. Differences in class encodings can be visualized by color-coded AI computation graphs to contrast class encodings (e.g., clean and poisoned or clean Class A and Class B - see the right side of Figure¬†1). The key challenges in addressing the problems lie in (1) integrating theoretical knowledge about neural networks to define utilization-based class encodings, (2) computing class encodings within an allocated time (e.g., 15 min per AI model), with limited computational resources and over hundreds of thousands of training images, and (3) visualizing and interpreting class encoding patterns for a variety of AI model architectures at the granularity of AI model graphs, subgraphs, and tensor-states.\nAll three challenges are intensified by increasing sizes of training datasets and by advancing complexities of AI architectures as enumerated with examples in Table¬†1. As of today, AI architectures are\n(a) very complex in terms of the number of parameters (from 60K parameters in LeNet model , to common networks having millions and billions of parameters, such as 160 billion reported by Trask et al. , and bleeding-edge networks with trillion-parameters in AI language models ),\n(b) very heterogeneous in terms of types of computation units in computational AI graphs, and\n(c) high dimensional in terms of data tensors generated by AI graph computation units.\n The fundamental underlying assumptions of our approach lie in the fact that tensor-state statistics at each graph node from all activations with training images per class can gain us insights into a mathematical function defining the mapping between class-defining training images and class labels. The tensor-state statistics are quantified based on capacity versus utilization metrics. Such metrics capture the concept of a successful defense against backdoor attacks by graph pruning as reported by Liu et al.  and are assumed to reveal a presence or absence of hidden classes (triggers or backdoor attacks). Although symbolic representations of subgraphs are still under investigation by Olah et al. , , we also assume that the utilization-based characterization of subgraphs may have a relationship with symbolic descriptions of image parts (e.g., subgraphs encode a traffic sign shape) and hence presence or absence of trojans can be detected by finding patterns in utilization-based color-coded graphs and subgraphs. The main novelties of this work are in the definition, measurement design, and pattern searching in utilization-based clean and poisoned class encodings. The main contributions are in utilization measurement placements for a variety of AI architectures, and in explainable clean and poisoned AI models at the granularity levels of AI model graphs, subgraphs and tensor-states.\nOur work leveraged interactive Trojan and AI efficiency simulations enabled by the Neural Network Calculator tool  and web-accessible AI models generated for the TrojAI Challenge computer vision rounds . The paper is organized as follows. Section¬†2 explains the relationship of this work to past efforts. Section¬†3 presents the theoretical underpinnings of AI model utilization measurements, the design reasoning, and the methodology for finding class encoding patterns in trained AI models. While Section¬†4 documents experimental data, numerical results, and visualizations, Section¬†5 provides an interpretation of the results in the context of trojan detection and injection.\nFinally, Section¬†6 summarizes lessons learned and outlines future work."
