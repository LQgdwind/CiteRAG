    "appendix a theoretical reasoning and relationships to past work": "Binary tensor-states in AI computation graphs:\nWhile one computation unit in an AI computation graph produces real-value numbers, they can be binarized by thresholding at zero during measurement extraction. The thresholding operation reduces the real-value variability to {0,1}01\\{0,1\\} by discretizing the output real values.\nOne can model the discretization step according to Hopfield Neural Networks (HNN)  where a computation unit is viewed as an associative content-addressable memory for storing information bits about training data points 8. The HNN model was motivated by collective properties of neurons in neurobiology adapted to integrated circuits , and the more recent work on dense associative memory  and Hopfield layers . The thresholding value at zero is motivated by zero-centered normalizations of input data and the majority of nonlinear activation functions being centered around zero (i.e., tanh, sigmoid, rectified linear unit (ReLU), or leaky ReLU). Utilization With Respect to State Representation Power of a Computation Unit:\nA particular computation unit in an AI computation graph can represent a maximum number of states depending on the number of outputs. For example, a fully connected layer (one computation unit) consisting of two nodes (two scalar outputs) can represent no more than four states, such as {00,01,10,11}00011011\\{00,01,10,11\\}. This fully connected layer would be fully utilized if all four states were used for predicting output labels. In order to define the utilization of a computation unit mathematically, one can use the parallels drawn by Bajcsy et al. [ref]17 between neural network and communication fields in terms of (a) computation unit maximum representation power and channel capacity in communications and (b) computation unit utilization and channel efficiency while leveraging the universal approximation theorem  and the source coding theorem .\nUsing the theorems, a computation unit vjsubscript𝑣𝑗v_{j} with DjO​u​tsuperscriptsubscript𝐷𝑗𝑂𝑢𝑡D_{j}^{Out} nodes has the maximum representation power (or computation unit capacity) of nj=2DjO​u​tsubscript𝑛𝑗superscript2superscriptsubscript𝐷𝑗𝑂𝑢𝑡n_{j}=2^{D_{j}^{Out}} possible states. The utilization definition can also be related to Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of a class of binary classifiers H𝐻H from the image space χ𝜒\\chi to the label space {0,1}01\\{0,1\\}; H:χ→{0,1}:𝐻→𝜒01H:\\chi\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\} , . The VC dimension V​C​d​i​m​(H)𝑉𝐶𝑑𝑖𝑚𝐻VCdim(H) is defined as the size m𝑚m of the largest shattered set of inputs {x→1,…,x→m}subscript→𝑥1…subscript→𝑥𝑚\\{\\vec{x}_{1},...,\\vec{x}_{m}\\} such that the growth function\nΠH​(m)=maxx→1,…,x→m∈χ⁡|{(h​(x→1),…,h​(x→m)):h∈H}|=2msubscriptΠ𝐻𝑚subscriptsubscript→𝑥1…subscript→𝑥𝑚𝜒conditional-setℎsubscript→𝑥1…ℎsubscript→𝑥𝑚ℎ𝐻superscript2𝑚\\Pi_{H}(m)=\\max_{\\vec{x}_{1},...,\\vec{x}_{m}\\in\\chi}|\\{(h(\\vec{x}_{1}),...,h(\\vec{x}_{m})):h\\in H\\}|=2^{m} .\nFor real-valued functions ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} present in neural networks, one can define VCdim(ℱ)=VCdim({sgn(f):f∈ℱ}VCdim(\\mathcal{F})=VCdim(\\{sgn(f):f\\in\\mathcal{F}\\}, which is achieved by thresholding at zero in the utilization computation. The pseudodimension of ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} or P​d​i​m​(ℱ)𝑃𝑑𝑖𝑚ℱPdim(\\mathcal{F}) has been proven to satisfy V​C​d​i​m​(ℱ)≤P​d​i​m​(ℱ)𝑉𝐶𝑑𝑖𝑚ℱ𝑃𝑑𝑖𝑚ℱVCdim(\\mathcal{F})\\leq Pdim(\\mathcal{F}) .\nFor example, a convolutional computation unit vjsubscript𝑣𝑗v_{j} with the output tensor (C​h​a​n​n​e​l​s,W​i​d​t​h,H​e​i​g​h​t)𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑊𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ𝐻𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡(Channels,Width,Height) per input image xi→→subscript𝑥𝑖\\vec{x_{i}} would yield V​C​d​i​m​(ℱ​(vj))=C​h​a​n​n​e​l​s𝑉𝐶𝑑𝑖𝑚ℱsubscript𝑣𝑗𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑠VCdim(\\mathcal{F}(v_{j}))=Channels after binarizing the output values. The V​C​d​i​m𝑉𝐶𝑑𝑖𝑚VCdim values are used to quantify utilization of each computation unit as documented in Section 3. Our work does not currently leverage the possibility of using lower and upper bounds on V​C​d​i​m​(ℱ)𝑉𝐶𝑑𝑖𝑚ℱVCdim(\\mathcal{F}) for an entire neural network. These bounds have been derived for AI architectures with computation units characterized by constant and known non-linearities (piece-wise constant, piece-wise linear, and piece-wise polynomial ) with respect to the number of layers L𝐿L and parameters W𝑊W. While in practice there is no guarantee that computation units in one architecture are not characterized by a mixture of non-linearity types, it would be possible to verify the theoretical bounds for a combination of L𝐿L and W𝑊W in a variety of existing popular AI architectures. Analytical and Statistical Utilization Definitions:\nGiven a set of training data points activating a computation unit in an AI computation graph, the computation unit will generate unique output states at varying frequencies. Considering that training datasets are formed by sampling and split into train, validation, and test subsets, the utilization value would vary depending on the sampling techniques and subset of samples. Thus, one can define the utilization ηjsubscript𝜂𝑗\\eta_{j} of a computation unit vjsubscript𝑣𝑗v_{j} using analytical or statistical views since the states generated as outputs of a computation unit by evaluating a set of training data points can be interpreted as deterministic states or as a statistical distribution of states. An analytical definition of computation unit utilization ηs​t​a​t​esuperscript𝜂𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒\\eta^{state} is directly derived as a ratio of a number of unique tensor-states and a computation unit capacity. One could aim at optimizing a network architecture search (NAS)  such that every computation unit reaches maximum utilization ηs​t​a​t​e=1.0superscript𝜂𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒1.0\\eta^{state}=1.0 over all training data points and all predicted labels.\nA statistical definition of computation unit utilization is derived from a tensor-state distribution shape and aims at maximum normalized entropy of the state distribution for each predicted label (entropy-based utilization) ηe​n​t​r​o​p​ysuperscript𝜂𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑦\\eta^{entropy} or at minimum Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence of the state distribution from a uniform distribution allocated per predicted label ηK​L​D​i​vsuperscript𝜂𝐾𝐿𝐷𝑖𝑣\\eta^{KLDiv}. The use of Entropy and KL divergence  are borrowed from the source coding theorem . Ordering Utilization Values in Class Encodings and AI Model Fingerprints:\nFor image classification AI models, a training dataset consists of one set of input images per output class label. Performing an inference on a set of training images per class label will produce one of the three utilization values per measurement probe (e.g., right after each computation unit of a computation graph). The order of probes can be determined based on the flow of input images through a computation graph since it is deterministic and well-defined during an inference computation. Given a sorted (ordered) list of probes and their utilization values, a utilization-based class encoding is uniquely defined. An AI model predicts multiple class labels, and, therefore, utilization evaluations of the same AI model will consists of multiple class encodings. Although class labels have semantic annotations (i.e., cat or dog), they are typically numerically labeled as well, and, therefore, they can be ordered. Given a sorted (ordered) list of classes by numerical labels, a utilization-based fingerprint of an AI model is well-defined as a matrix of ordered utilization-based class encodings."
