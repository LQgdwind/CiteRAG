    "summary, conclusion, and future work": "This paper contains a full approximation fixpoint theory to non-deterministic operators. We introduced deterministic operators,\ntheir non-deterministic approximation operators, and the various fixpoint semantics, namely, the Kripke-Kleene interpretation and state semantics, the stable interpretation semantics\nand the well-founded state semantics. The properties of these semantics and their representation of disjunctive logic programming semantics is summarized in Table¬†4.\nThe relation between these fixpoint semantics is summarized in Figure¬†2. This work also\nallows to generalize the results in¬† , which provide further approximation operators for disjunctive logic programs with aggregates or external atoms, to further semantics of disjunctive logic programs, thus answering an open question in\nthese works. The advantage of studying non-deterministic operators\nis thus at least twofold: allowing to define a family of semantics\nfor non-monotonic reasoning with disjunctive information, clarifying similarities and differences between semantics stemming from the use of different operators. The introduction of disjunctive information in AFT points to a wealth of further research, such as defining three-valued and well-founded semantics for various disjunctive\nnonmonotonic formalisms and studying on the basis of which operators various well-founded semantics for DLP can be represented in our framework. For example, our framework\ncan potentially be used for defining three-valued and well-founded semantics for propositional theories¬†, disjunctive logic programs with\nrecursive aggregates¬†, logic programs with aggregates in the head¬†3, logic programs with forks¬†,\nand disjunctive default logics¬†2 4. Non-deterministic approximation fixpoint theory has already been applied in order to obtain a generalization of abstract dialectical frameworks (ADFs) to conditional abstract dialectical frameworks. In a nutshell, abstract dialectical frameworks consist of sets of arguments or atoms, in which every atom aùëéa is assigned a Boolean acceptance condition Casubscriptùê∂ùëéC_{a}, which\ncodifies under which conditions an atom can be accepted. Heyninck and co-authors¬†8 generalized ADFs as to allow for acceptance conditions to be\nassigned to any, i.e.¬†possibly non-atomic, formulas. This necessitated the generalization of the so-called ŒìŒì\\Gamma-operator to a non-deterministic operator, which was done in the\nframework of non-deterministic approximation fixpoint theory as presented here. Our\nframework lays the ground for the generalization\nof various interesting concepts introduced (or adapted) to AFT, such as ultimate approximations , grounded fixpoints\n2, strong equivalence , stratification  and argumentative representations\n6 to a non-deterministic setting. Extensions to DLP with negations in the rules‚Äô heads and corresponding 4-valued semantics¬†\ncan also be considered. Another issue that is worth some consideration is a study of the complexity of computing different types of fixpoints of non-deterministic\napproximation operators, in the style of Strass and Wallner ."
