    "ii-b cnn-based approaches": "Lately, CNN-based methods have shown significant improvements from traditional methods on the task. Zhang et al. [ref]26 proposed a deep trained CNN to estimate crowd count while predicting crowd density level. In , Zhang et al. proposed a multi-column CNN (MCNN) in which each column was designed to respond to different scales. Li et al. [ref]9 proposed a deep single column CNN based on a truncated VGG16 encoder and dilated convolutional layers as a decoder to aggregate the multi-scale contextual information. Cao et al. [ref]7 presented an encoder-decoder scale aggregation network (SANet). Jiang et al.  proposed a trellis encoder-decoder network (TEDnet) that incorporates multiple decoding paths. Shi et al.  exploited the perspective information of pedestrian height, which is used to combine the multi-scale density maps. Liu et al.  applied an attention mechanism to crowd counting by integrating an attention-aware network into a multi-scale deformable network to detect crowd regions. Wang et al.  escalated the performance of crowd counting by pretraining a crowd counter on the synthetic data and proposed a crowd counting method via domain adaptation to deal with the lack of labeled data. Liu et al.  proposed a VGG16-based model with the scale-aware contextual structure (CAN) that combines features extracted from multiple receptive field sizes and learns the importance of each such feature over image location. Zhu et al.  proposed the dual path multi-scale fusion networks (SFANet) with an additional path to supervisedly learn generated attention maps. SFANet’s decoder reuses coarse features and high-level features from encoding stages similar to Unet . Similarly, Sindagi et al.  also introduced the attention mechanism, but embedded as the spatial attention module (SAM) in the network design. Sam et al.  delivered a separate top-down feedback CNN to correct the initial prediction. Likewise in , Sindagi et al. designed bottom-top and top-bottom feature fusion method to utilize information present at each of the network layers. Recently, instead of employing density maps as learning targets, Ma et al.  constructed a density contribution model and trained a VGG19-based network using Bayesian loss rather than the vanilla mean square error (MSE) loss."
