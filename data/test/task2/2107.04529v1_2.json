    "discussion": "Entropic methods of inference are of general applicability but there exist\nspecial situations — such as, for example, those involving large numbers of\nindependent subsystems — where inferences can be made by purely\nprobabilistic methods without ever invoking the concept of entropy. In such\ncases one can check (see e.g. in ) that the two methods of calculation are consistent with each other. It\nis significant, however, that alternative entropies such as those proposed in\n do not pass this\ntest , which rules them out as\ntools for updating. Some probability distributions obtained by maximizing the\nalternative entropies have, however, turned out to be physically relevant. It\nis therefore noteworthy that those successful distributions can also be\nderived through more standard application of MaxEnt or ME as advocated in this\nreview [ref]8. In other words, what is being\nruled out are not the distributions themselves, but the alternative entropies\nfrom which they were inferred. Choosing the prior density q​(x)𝑞𝑥q(x) can be tricky. Sometimes symmetry\nconsiderations can be useful but otherwise there is no fixed set of rules to\ntranslate information into a probability distribution except, of course, for\nBayes’ rule and the ME method themselves. What if the prior q​(x)𝑞𝑥q(x) vanishes for some values of x𝑥x? S​[p,q]𝑆𝑝𝑞S[p,q] can be\ninfinitely negative when q​(x)𝑞𝑥q(x) vanishes within some region 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}.\nThis means that the ME method confers an infinite preference on those\ndistributions p​(x)𝑝𝑥p(x) that vanish whenever q​(x)𝑞𝑥q(x) does. One must emphasize that\nthis is as it should be. A similar situation also arises in the context of\nBayes’ theorem where assigning a vanishing prior represents a tremendously\nserious commitment because no amount of data to the contrary would allow us to\nrevise it. In both ME and Bayes updating we should recognize the implications\nof assigning a vanishing prior. Assigning a very low but non-zero prior\nrepresents a safer and possibly less prejudiced representation of one’s prior beliefs. The ME method allows one to process information in the form of constraints.\nWhen we are confronted with several constraints we must be particularly\ncautious. Should they be processed simultaneously or sequentially? And, if the\nlatter, in what order? The answer depends on the problem at hand . We refer to constraints as commuting when it makes no difference\nwhether they are handled simultaneously or sequentially. The most common\nexample is that of Bayesian updating on the basis of data collected in several\nindependent experiments. In this case the order in which the observed data\nx′={x1′,x2′,…}superscript𝑥′superscriptsubscript𝑥1′superscriptsubscript𝑥2′…x^{\\prime}=\\{x_{1}^{\\prime},x_{2}^{\\prime},\\ldots\\} is processed does not\nmatter for the purpose of inferring θ𝜃\\theta. In general, however, constraints\nneed not commute and when this is the case the order in which they are\nprocessed is critical. To decide whether constraints are to be handled sequentially or simultaneously\none must be clear about how the ME method handles constraints. The ME\nmachinery interprets a constraint in a very mechanical way: all distributions\nsatisfying the constraint are in principle allowed while all distributions\nviolating it are ruled out. Therefore, sequential updating is appropriate when\nold constraints become obsolete and are superseded by new information while\nsimultaneous updating is appropriate when old constraints remain valid. The\ntwo cases refer to different states of information and therefore it is to be\nexpected that they will result in different inferences. These comments are\nmeant to underscore the importance of understanding what information is and\nhow it is processed by the ME method; failure to do so will lead to errors\nthat do not reflect a shortcoming of the ME method but rather a misapplication\nof it. Entropy is a tool for reasoning and — as with all tools for reasoning or\notherwise — it can be misused leading to unsatisfactory results\n. Should that happen, the inevitable questions are ‘what\nwent wrong?’ and ‘how do we fix it?’ It helps to first ask what components of\nthe analysis can be trusted so that the possible mistakes can be looked for\nelsewhere. The answers proposed by the ME method are radically conservative:\nproblems always arise through a wrong choices of variables, or priors, or\nconstraints. Indeed, one should not blame the entropic method for not having\ndiscovered and taken into account relevant information that was not explicitly\nintroduced into the analysis. Indeed, just as one would be very reticent about\nquestioning the basic rules of arithmetic, or the basic rules of calculus, one\nshould not question the basic sum and product rules of the probability\ncalculus and, taking this one step farther, one should not question the\napplicability of entropy as the updating tool. The adoption of this\nconservative approach leads us to reject alternative entropies and quantum\nprobabilities. Fortunately, those constructs are not actually needed — as\nmentioned above, those Tsallis distributions that have turned out be useful\ncan be derived with the standard entropic methods [ref]8 and quantum mechanics can be handled within standard\nprobability theory without invoking exotic probabilities [ref]36. I would like to acknowledge many valuable discussions on probability and\nentropy with N. Caticha, A. Giffin, K. Knuth, R. Preuss, C. Rodríguez, J.\nSkilling, and K. Vanslette."
