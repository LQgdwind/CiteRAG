    "i introduction": "Polar codes¬† have been ratified as the standard codes to protect control channels in 5G enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB)¬†, thus raising significant attention in both academia and industry.\nSuccessive cancellation (SC)¬† and SC list (SCL) decoding¬† led the mainstream development of polar decoding algorithms and implementations.\nIn particular, SCL decoding can evaluate two hypotheses for each information bit, by estimating each information bit as either 00 or 111 and maintaining a list of up to LùêøL candidate codewords in parallel during the decoding.\nThis yields superior error-correcting performance compared to SC decoding.\nUsing hardware-friendly log-likelihood ratio (LLR)-based SCL decoding¬†, an SCL decoder with L=8ùêø8L=8 provides a good trade-off between error-correcting performance and hardware complexity and has been chosen as the algorithm baseline during the 5G standardization process¬†. In terms of hardware implementation, to reduce long decoding latency in conventional SC-based decoders¬† , node-based techniques have been introduced to SC decoders¬†  , in which special bit patterns of constituent codes can be identified in the decoding tree to allow direct decoding of multiple bits in parallel instead of repeatedly traversing the corresponding parts of the tree.\nThen, such techniques were also introduced to SCL decoders, using list extension strategies for special nodes¬†0 1 2, thereby significantly decreasing the decoding latency.\nNotably, the recently found generalized sequence repetition node (SR)¬†3 can support most existing node patterns in SC decoding.\nThe work in¬†4 first extends the SR node to SCL decoding and implements a corresponding SR-List decoder to meet the stringent low-latency and low-complexity requirements of 5G.\nHowever, the existing SCL decoders (including¬†4) still suffer from sequential processing in the special nodes, which leads to unavoidable stalls.\nTo mitigate the impact of these stalls, based on the architecture in¬†1, several latency-optimization techniques have been proposed in¬†5 to reduce idle cycles by modifying the architectures of computational units to allow for¬†overlapped¬†processing. In addition to low latency, high reliability is also essential, but the error-correcting capability of SCL decoding, with a limited list size, falls short in some resource-constrained scenarios and demands further enhancement.\nRecently, automorphism ensemble decoding (AED) gained a lot of attention due to its superior performance and universality¬†6 7 8 9.\nAED employs code automorphisms, represented as a block lower triangular affine (BLTA) group in polar codes¬†6, to decode various codeword permutations in parallel, demonstrating particular effectiveness for short-length polar codes¬†8.\nHowever, its hard-wired routing of permutations lacks flexibility for diverse automorphisms.\nIt is noteworthy that as a subset of a general affine (GA) group, factor graph permutations¬†0 1 (also known as permuted factor graphs, PFGs) efficiently widen the decoding space through graph ensemble decoding and can be implemented in hardware to generate these permuted graphs on-the-fly¬†2.\nHowever, this factor graph permutation alters the bit indices¬†3 and thus greatly affects the node structure of the polar decoding tree.\nThis alteration complicates the direct application of node techniques to graph ensemble decoding.\nTherefore, integrating graph ensembles with SCL decoding and node-based techniques for high performance and low latency remains challenging. Moreover, these node-based polar decoders rely on the identification of the type and the length of special codes, which necessitates complex control logic¬†.\nTo bypass this issue, most decoders generate instructions offline and store the resulting instructions in dedicated memories.\nThe decoder then proceeds by reading these instructions to coordinate each component.\nHowever, this instruction storage incurs significant area overhead¬† 4 1.\nGiven the wide range of message lengths from 121212 to 170617061706 in 5G¬†NR polar codes, it is impractical to store all possibilities and a rapid succession of code changes leaves no time to generate instructions.\nTo overcome this issue, an online generator is proposed in¬†5 to identify the special patterns of basic nodes directly in hardware based on the channel relative reliability vector, thus supporting a rate-flexible decoder.\nHowever, to the best knowledge of the authors, there is currently no online generator compatible with more generalized nodes, such as SR nodes, that achieves both strict low decoding latency and rate flexibility in generalized node-based SCL decoders."
