    "related work": "Our work builds on two major aspects of DRL:\nrepresentation learning,\nparticularly task-specific encodings following the BSM,\nand\nmethods for sparse reward environments,\n(e.g., intrinsic motivation). Representation Learning for Control \nIn the context of RL, there is a spectrum of representations\nfrom task-agnostic to task-specialized.\nOne task-agnostic approach to learning latent representation spaces\nuses a reconstruction loss.\nIn particular, some methods utilize this approach for model-based planning\n  ,\nwhile others do so for model-free RL\n 7 .\nSuch approaches often utilize generative models,\nwhich have shown use for learning via simulation,\nin addition to representation learning  .\nInstead of fully reconstructing an input, other approaches use self-supervised representation learning methods, especially contrastive learning algorithms\n  . While task-agnostic reconstruction is reusable and transferable, it can store unnecessary or distracting details. In contrast, state abstraction methods  can obtain compact state representations that ignore irrelevant information, by finding (approximately) equivalent aggregated MDPs that have (nearly) identical optimal policies. To learn such MDP homomorphisms  , previous efforts have exploited various structural regularities (e.g., equal rewards and transition probabilities 9 , state-action symmetries and equivariances   ) and assumptions .\nState similarity metric learning  is closely related, as one can aggregate ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-close states to produce a new MDP.\nFor example, inter-state distances can be assigned based on the difference between policy distributions conditioned on respective states  .\nInverse dynamics prediction can also help encourage holding only information relevant to what the agent can control  6.\nFor model-based RL, prior work constructed equivalence classes of models 1, as well as other abstractions  , to save computation and memory. In our work, we build on the use of task-specific bisimulation relations 9,\nwhich define equivalence classes of states based on rewards and transition probabilities.\nHowever, obtaining equivalence classes is brittle, as our estimates of these quantities may be inexact.\nHence, Ferns et al.    instead turn to a bisimulation metric between states,\nwhich can vary smoothly as the rewards and transition probabilities change.\nMore recently, Zhang et al. 3 devised Deep Bisimulation for Control (DBC), which applies a metric learning approach to enforce its representation to approximately follow bisimulation-derived state aggregation.\nWhile DeepMDP 7 proves that its representation provides an upper bound on the bisimulation distance, DBC 3 directly imposes the bisimulation metric structure on the latent space.\nHerein,\nwe extend prior analysis and methods for representation learning\nusing PBSMs,\nwith the goal of improving robustness and general performance.\nIn particular,\nwe focus on preventing embedding pathologies,\nin the context of uninformative reward signals and distraction. Reinforcement Learning under Uninformative Rewards \nMany real-world tasks suffer from uninformative rewards,\nmeaning that the agent receives sparse (mostly zero) or static (largely constant) rewards throughout its trajectories.\nFor example, games like Montezuma’s Revenge only provide reward signals after a large number of steps – and the agent is likely not to receive one at all, in most cases.\nThus, while common, this situation significantly increases the difficulty of the RL task, as the agent receives little signal about its progress.\nTo deal with such situations, a common tactic is to encourage the agent to explore in the absence of an extrinsic reward signal.\nThis is often done by providing intrinsic motivation via a self-derived reward, resulting in “curiosity-driven” behaviour  .\nSuch approaches include\nsurprise  \n(where experiencing unexpected dynamics is rewarded),\nand\nempowerment 0 0\n(where the agent prefers states in which it has more control). In this work, we specifically target the case of uninformative rewards,\nshowing that the DBC model is especially susceptible to instability or collapse for such tasks, and consider ways to ameliorate this issue.\nIn particular, we utilize the forward prediction error as an intrinsic reward 6  3, thus augmenting the sparse extrinsic rewards and encouraging exploration.\nWe also regularize the latent space by learning an inverse dynamics model on top of it, which does not rely on the extrinsic reward signal and has previously been used for distraction-robust representation learning in DRL  6."
