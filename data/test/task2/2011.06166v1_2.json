    "related work": "Computational entropy was studied systematically in \nand is relevant to various problems in complexity and cryptography such as\nleakage-resilience ,\nconstructions of PRGs from one-way functions\n [ref]21 .\nand derandomization . There are a number of definitions of computational entropy which we don‚Äôt\nconsider in this work. For example, Yao pseudoentropy  (see also ), corresponding to random\nvariables which are ‚Äòcompressible‚Äô by a class of tests ‚Ñ±‚Ñ±\\mathcal{F}, in the sense that ‚Ñ±‚Ñ±\\mathcal{F}\ncan encode and decode the random variable by encoding into a small number of bits.\nYao pseudoentropy was recently used in time-efficient hardness-to-randomness tradeoffs ,\nwhere (randomness-efficient) samplers for pseudodense distributions were used with an\nappropriate extractor to construct a pseudorandom distribution.\nAnother example is inaccessible entropy of Haitner et al. [ref]21,\ncorresponding to the entropy of a message at some round in a two-player protocol\nconditioned on the prior messages and the randomness of the players, which is used\nin efficient constructions of statistically hiding commitment schemes\nfrom one-way functions . Separating notions of computational entropy has been studied before\nin , who prove a separation of\npseudodensity and having a dense model for bounded-width\nread-once branching programs. Separating notions of conditional computational entropy\nwas studied in , showing\nseparations between conditional variants\nof Yao pseudoentropy and having a dense model. As mentioned in , citing \nand personal communication with Impagliazzo, another question of interest is whether\nYao pseudoentropy (corresponding to efficient encoding/decoding algorithms)\nimplies having dense model. It is not hard to see that small Yao pseudoentropy\nimplies small pseudodensity, with some mild restrictions on ‚Ñ±‚Ñ±\\mathcal{F}. It would be\ninteresting to see if the techniques from this paper can be used to understand\nYao pseudoentropy in more detail. We leave this to future work. Prior work on the complexity of dense model theorems has\nincluded a tight lower bound on the query complexity \nand a lower bound on the advice complexity .\nAs far as we are aware, this is the first work to consider the computational complexity\nof dense model theorems. There has also been prior work on the computational complexity of hardness amplification, establishing that various\nknown strategies for hardness amplification require the computation of majority    . It is known that a particular type of hardness amplification given by the hardcore lemma implies the dense model theorem . Our results are stronger in the following sense:\nprevious work    shows that black-box hardness amplification proofs\nrequire majority. This means that if you amplify the hardness of fùëìf in some black-box way,\nthen this can be used to compute majority. In our case, we simply show (in different settings)\nthat the dense model theorem is false, regardless of how we tried to prove it.\nBy the connection between the hardcore lemma and the dense model theorem, our results\nalso provide scenarios where the hardcore lemma is false. As far as we are aware,\nthese are the first such scenarios recorded in the literature."
