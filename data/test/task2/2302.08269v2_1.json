    "i introduction": "The acquisition of clear underwater images plays a critical role in fields where autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) are required to interact with underwater environments [ref]1[ref]2. However, the complex underwater conditions usually lead to serious quality degradation of underwater images. Hence, UIE is vital for vision-related underwater tasks. UIE has been studied intensively in recent years [ref]4. Most of them are guided by the simplified atmospheric image formation model: where c∈{R,G,B}𝑐𝑅𝐺𝐵c\\in\\{R,G,B\\} is the color channel, Ic​(x)subscript𝐼𝑐𝑥I_{c}(x) is the captured underwater image, Jc​(x)subscript𝐽𝑐𝑥J_{c}(x) is the scene radiance at x𝑥x, e−βc⋅zsuperscript𝑒⋅subscript𝛽𝑐𝑧e^{-\\beta_{c}\\cdot z} is the medium transmission, Bc∞superscriptsubscript𝐵𝑐B_{c}^{\\infty} is the homogeneous background light, z𝑧z is the range between the camera and the objects. The goal of the UIE is to recover Jc​(x)subscript𝐽𝑐𝑥J_{c}(x) from Ic​(x)subscript𝐼𝑐𝑥I_{c}(x). However, the overwhelming usage of the simplified model in UIE may introduce significant errors . Learning-based UIE methods  have achieved significant results in recent years. They are usually trained with synthesized images due to the lack of reference real underwater images. However, the inter-domain gap between the synthetic and real underwater images could make them hard to generalize well on real underwater images. To narrow the inter-domain gap, some researchers have attempted to generate more realistic underwater images . Other researchers adopted the idea in transfer learning to alleviate the inter-domain difference . Nevertheless, transferring the synthetic domain knowledge with an improved synthetic dataset has not been studied in the UIE field. In addition to the inter-domain gap issue, complex underwater environments often lead to intra-domain gap problems. As shown in Fig. † ‣ 1, the wavelength-dependent light absorption could lead to a dominant bluish/greenish color cast, while the light backscattering and suspended particles could cause a turbid/hazy effect. Although some methods  deal with the problem by classifying synthesized underwater images with Jerlov water types , the intra-domain adaptation using both synthetic and real underwater images has not been explored. In this work, we propose SyreaNet, a UIE framework combining both synthetic and real underwater images guided by the revised underwater image formation model  and novel DA strategies. Our main contributions are as follows: Guided by the revised model, a synthesis module to generate a more realistic underwater image dataset from both in-air and real underwater images is proposed. A physically disentangled network is well designed to predict both clear underwater images and the critical components in the revised model. Novel DA strategies are proposed to align various domain gaps by exchanging knowledge across domains. The superiority of our proposed framework over other SOTA UIE methods is well demonstrated by extensive experiments both qualitatively and quantitatively. The rest of this article is organized as follows. Related work is introduced in Sec. II. The framework details are presented in Sec. III. The experiments are shown in Sec. IV. Finally, concluding remarks are drawn in Sec. V."
