  "sections": {
    "introduction": "There is an increasing need for ready-to-animate models, which takes designers lots of time in shape modeling, skeleton creation, and weight painting. However, manually creating the skeleton is labor-intensive, and requires professional training. Sketch-based tools  liberate users from the troublesome of shape modeling, making 3D modeling accessible to novices. There are also lots of work focusing on automatic skeletonization [ref]6. However, they are computation expensive and far from real-time. The skeleton is extracted only after the entire mesh model is constructed and processed by the algorithm. In this paper, we present a real-time skeletonization method for sketch-based modeling, which enables simultaneous shape modeling and skeleton creation. A local skeleton and corresponding mesh are automatically created as soon as the polygon stroke is captured, then the subpart is connected to the existing subpart, finally a coarse-to-fine refinement strategy is provided to the user to control the skeleton complexity, see Fig.¬†1. Extracting an animatable skeleton in real-time is difficult with three major challenges: (i)ùëñ(i) how to extract the local skeleton efficiently from an underlying shape; (i‚Äãi)ùëñùëñ(ii) how to establish the relationship among local skeletons in real-time; and (i‚Äãi‚Äãi)ùëñùëñùëñ(iii) how to find the optimal skeleton structure suitable for animation. To solve the first challenge, we construct a straight skeleton  structure directly from the input polyline and fully utilize Douglas Peucker (DP) simplification  to accelerate the process. The straight skeleton is extracted by offsetting the polygon edges inward and recording the trace of vertices. We employ straight skeleton as our base skeletonization technique because the computation cost is almost negligible compared with other methods based on binary image 0, voxels 12, point clouds , and meshes . The simplicity of polygon data structure makes the algorithm a perfect candidate for immediate skeleton extraction. Our innovation is the full-fledged use of DP technique for speeding up animatable skeleton extraction. As shown in Fig.¬†1a, we simplify the dense sketch points (red) with DP, the simplified contour not only approximates the shape well but also generates the most concise input for the straight skeleton extraction algorithm. We further propose an efficient BoundedDP algorithm for extracting joints from the axis line of the straight skeleton. Both the axis curvature and silhouette shape are considered, which yields a good result of key joints. To solve the second challenge, we reuse the skeleton axis and joints extracted from the first step and develop a general cylinder around the axis as well as an inscribed ball around the joint to approximate the 3D shape. This approximation enables the real-time intersection test in the interactive modeling process. Once two 3D shapes are found intersecting with each other, we attach one skeleton to the other according to the modeling sequence. We set the independent subparts as roots, and all follow-up subparts are attached hierarchically according to the intersection relationship and the modeling order. The attached position is calculated from Euclidean distance between parent-skeleton bones and child-skeleton joints. To solve the third challenge, we equip users with four operations under three level-of-detail controls. As pointed by , animators need multi-level controls for skeleton complexity, and the fixed number of joints extracted solely from shape topology is not enough to capture user intention. For example, a hand may be represented by a single medial bone or a finer resolution of hierarchical finger joints. Our four operations provide users flexible control over skeleton complexity. Instead of manually inserting, deleting, and connecting bones, users only need to adjust four parameters to change the skeleton structure. The branch-level operation is based on DP algorithm, which allows users to tune the joints number for a single axis, such as the axis on a finger. For the subpart level and global level, we take inspiration from polygon mesh processing 345 and skeleton pruning 67 since a skeleton can be regarded as an acyclic graph structure (tree). The three operations are joints merging, branch pruning, and edge collapsing. Each operation corresponds to a control threshold that is calculated from the current geometric state of the skeleton. Users can explore different design ideas simply by playing around with these parameters. In summary, our contributions are four folds: (i)ùëñ(i) a real-time skeletonization algorithm for immediately constructing an animatable skeleton from user sketch; (i‚Äãi)ùëñùëñ(ii) an efficient method for fast intersection test and sub-skeletons connection; (i‚Äãi‚Äãi)ùëñùëñùëñ(iii) a flexible solution for multi-level of details skeleton control; (i‚Äãv)ùëñùë£(iv) an easy-to-use sketch system to create animatable models."
