    "iv-d2 effectiveness of the appearance module": "To validate the effectiveness of the proposed appearance module, we further compare our proposed DFR-ST with several current methods on VehicleID.\nTable V illustrates the mAP, Top-1, and Top-5 metrics of the proposed appearance module and state-of-the-art methods on the large-scale VehicleID dataset. The bold value means the first, and the underlined value stands for the second.\nNote that VehicleID dataset does not provide any other information besides images, hence we can not utilize the spatio-temporal module in the performance comparison. As shown in Table V, the proposed appearance module outperforms all the existing methods on the Top-5 metric with small, medium, and large test sizes. Besides, the proposed DFR-ST also achieves the highest Top-1 of 77.93% with the large test size, which is the most challenging setting among three test splits.\nIn particular, compared with traditional hand-craft methods, LOMO  and BOW-CN , deep-learning-based approaches achieve significant improvements which verifies the strong representation capability of deep neural networks on the non-linear transformation. Furthermore, our proposed appearance module beats the existing methods including FACT , PROVID , DRDL 7, DenseNet121 , TAMR , VAMI 3, GS-TRE , QD-DLF 6, PRN (Single Height-Channel Branch) , GRF + GGL 5, Hard-View-EALN 4, OIN  and SAVER 8 on the mAP, Top-1 and Top-5 metrics with three test splits.\nAlthough RNN-HA (ResNet+672)  receives more 1.65% on Top-1 with the small test size than the proposed DFR-ST w/o ST, the proposed appearance module outperforms RNN-HA (ResNet+672)  on the other metrics with three test sizes, which show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nAlthough our DFR-ST without the spatio-temporal module is a bit inferior to HPGN 9, the proposed DFR-ST can still obtain rather competitive performance on the challenging VehicleID dataset, which confirms the competitiveness of our proposed appearance module."
