    "c.1 training details": "In this section, we first provide the general setup which, unless specified otherwise, is shared across all of our experiments. Afterwards, we describe dataset-specific details in Secs. C.1.1, C.1.2 and C.1.3, for each dataset and experiment. Standard Networks.\nAs mentioned in Sec. 4 in the main paper, we follow the recipe from . For standard models, we use the AdamW optimizer [ref]23 with a weight-decay factor of 10−4superscript10410^{-4} and a cosine-annealing learning-rate scheduler [ref]24 with an initial learning-rate of 0.01, reached with an initial warmup for 5 epochs. We clip gradients by norm at 1.0. B-cos Networks. We use the latest implementations for B-cos models . Following [ref]5 , we use the Adam optimizer [ref]23 and do not apply weight-decay. We use a cosine-annealing learning-rate scheduler [ref]24 with an initial learning-rate of 10−3superscript10310^{-3}, reached with an initial warmup for 5 epochs. Following , we clip gradients using adaptive gradient clipping (AGC) . Unless specified otherwise, across all models and datasets we use random crops and random horizontal flips as data augmentation during training, and at test time we resize the images to 256 (along the smaller dimension) and apply center crop of (224, 224). We use PyTorch  and PyTorch Lightning  for all of our implementations."
