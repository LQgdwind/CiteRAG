    "related works": "Object Detection.\nCurrent DCNNs-based object detection methods can mainly be grouped into two categories: proposal-based methods and proposal-free methods. Proposal-based methods 1    divide object detection into two sequential stages by firstly generating a set of region proposals and then performing classification and bounding box regression for each proposal.\nProposal-free methods     directly predict the bounding boxes and the corresponding class labels on top of CNN features. We choose to use one of the most representative proposal-based methods, Faster R-CNN 1, in our model as it usually has better detection accuracy than proposal-free detectors due to the cascade design and improving detection accuracy is still the top priority for FSOD. Few-Shot Learning and Meta-Learning. Few-shot learning aims to recognize novel classes using only few examples. Meta-learning has been demonstrated a promising learning paradigm for few-shot learning tasks by transferring meta-knowledge learned from data-abundant base classes to data-scarce novel classes. Current meta-learning based few-shot learning methods can be roughly divided into three categories: optimization-based methods , parameter-generation-based methods  and metric-learning-based methods    .\nMost of the few-shot learning methods are developed for the image classification task. Few-Shot Object Detection. Different from few-shot image classification, few-shot object detection needs to not only recognize objects with an arbitrary appearance, pose and scale using few-shot examples as references, but also localize (multiple) objects in the image and reject numerous background regions. Existing works can be mainly grouped into the following two categories: (1) Long-tailed-learning-based methods 7 0. These methods attempt to learn object detection by using training data from both data-abundant base classes and data-scarce novel classes. To deal with the unbalanced training set, re-sampling 7 and re-weighting  are the two main strategies .\nHowever, the models trained on the joint dataset are inflexible for adding never-seen few-shot classes. (2) Meta-learning-based methods 8 . Meta-learner    3 is introduced to acquire class-level meta knowledge via feature re-weighting and helps the model to generalize to novel classes.\nMeta-learning based methods 9 8 1  4    has been demonstrated to be successful for FSOD.\nMoreover, meta-learning based methods can be efficient for incrementally adding new few-shot classes during network inference. Our method belongs to this category. Graph Convolutional Networks.\nFirst proposed by Kipf et al. ,\ngraph convolutional networks (GCNs) and their variants like Graph Attention Networks (GAT) 5, have seen massive applications in Computer Vision, including modeling video proposal relations in action localization  5, object relations in visual relation reasoning , joint relations in skeleton-based action recognition 2, and object proposal relations in object detection .\nLiu et al.  inject a GNN into a Faster R-CNN framework to contextualize the features of region proposals before the R-CNN classifier. This improves the results but it only shows results under traditional many-shot setting. Some methods 8 utilize GNNs on graphs that represent the ontology of concepts, which could enable generalization to unseen concepts by considering their relations with frequently-seen concepts. Different from previous works, we propose a novel heterogeneous GCNs in this paper that considers various relations within and between proposals and classes for FSOD."
