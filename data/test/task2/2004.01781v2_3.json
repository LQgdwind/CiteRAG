    "string compression techniques": "The technique presented in this article relies on a particular type of sequential pattern mining, namely tandem repeats, and specifically on string compression techniques to detect and collapse repeated sequences of events, so as to reduce the length of the traces in a log. In the rest of this section we review different types of string compression techniques, and the types of repetitive patterns that can be compressed. Last, we review the usage of string compression techniques in process mining. String or text compression techniques can be broken down into two families of approaches: dictionary based-approaches and statistical approaches¬†. Dictionary-based approaches aim at achieving a lossless representation of the input data by recording all reduced versions of repetitive patterns in the data source in a dictionary to be able to later reconstruct an exact representation of the original data. Statistical approaches on the other hand rely on statistical models such as alphabet or probability distributions to compress the input data. This type of approaches can achieve a better degree of compression, but can only reconstruct an approximate representation of the original data, i.e.¬†the compression is prone to the loss of information. As such, this latter approach is more applicable when a small loss of information is tolerable and the amount of information is very large, e.g.¬†in the field of image compression. In the context of trace alignment, this is not suitable because any loss of information may result in further (spurious) differences between the log and the model. Hence, our focus is on lossless compression techniques. Dictionary based approaches can be further sub-divided into approaches that implicitly represent compressed sequences as tuples, i.e.¬†approaches based on ‚ÄúLempel Ziv 77‚Äù¬†, or explicitly record compressions in a dictionary, i.e.¬†approaches based on ‚ÄúLempel Ziv 78‚Äù¬†. The former approaches aims at identifying the longest match of repetitive patterns in a sliding window and compresses the repeated pattern with a tuple consisting of an offset to the previous repetition, the length of the pattern and the first symbol after the pattern. Several approaches improved on this idea by reducing the information of the tuple or by improving the identification of repetitions¬†. Approaches based on Lempel Ziv 78 build up a dictionary for compressed repetitive sequences, where each compressed pattern is linked to an index of its extended form in the dictionary. When the input source is large, the dictionary grows extensively and leads to a lower compression rate. Several approaches tackle this issue by using different dictionary types, for example with static length¬† or over a rolling window¬†. These two latter approaches are faster in decoding repetitive patterns than in compressing them. This is because they need to constantly identify repetitive patterns during the compression. However, they can decode the patterns faster since all necessary information is stored either in the tuples or in the dictionary. In this article, we will define a reduction of an event log based on the ideas of  representing repetitive patterns as tuples. We will use the additional information of the tuples about the reduced pattern, i.e.¬†reduced number of repetitions, to guide the computation of compressed alignments that can then be decoded into proper alignments for the process model. A repetitive pattern¬† is a sequence of symbols that is repeated in a given period or context, i.e.¬†in this work the context is a given trace of an event log. The repeating sequence (a.k.a.¬†the repeat type) can either be full, i.e.¬†all symbols of the repeat type are repeated, or partial, i.e.¬†only some symbols of the repeat type are repeated. A repeat type can either be repeated consecutively, i.e.¬†all repetitions follow one another, or gapped, i.e.¬†the repetitions of the repeat type occur at different positions within a given trace. In addition, a repetitive pattern can also be approximate with a Levenshtein distance of kùëòk symbols, i.e.¬†the pattern allows up to kùëòk symbols disrupting the repeating sequence. In the context of conformance checking, we aim at relating a repetitive pattern to the process model to find if it can be repeated in a loop structure of the process model. For that purpose, we will rely on a restrictive class of repeat patterns, i.e.¬†full repeat types with consecutive repetitions (a.k.a. tandem repeats). If the pattern were partial, approximate or gapped, the execution context of the process model would be lost and hence no cyclic behavior of the process model could be extended when decoding the repetitive patterns later on. In the context of process mining, repetitive patterns have been used to define trace abstractions in¬†[ref]8. These trace abstractions haven then been used to discover hierarchical process models. In this context, tandem repeats have been considered for discovering loop structures and full repeat types with gapped repetitions have been used for discovering subprocesses. The properties of tandem repeats have been further explored in¬†[ref]8. Specifically, a tandem repeat is called maximal, if the repeat type cannot be extended by another consecutive repetition before its starting position or after the last repetition of the tandem repeat. Conversely, a tandem repeat is called primitive, if the repeat type in itself is not another tandem repeat. These categorizations were made to discourage redundant discoveries of similar repeat types. In this article, we will hence use maximal and primitive tandem repeats to reduce the event log for the purpose of speeding up the computation of trace alignments."
