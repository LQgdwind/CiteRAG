    "ii-b automl for encrypted traffic classification": "A plethora of machine learning models have been suggested for traffic classification since the early 2000s. Numerous classical machine learning models including Naive Bayes, Bayesian Networks, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Random Forests   were shown to effectively classify traffic datasets, including encrypted TOR traffic.\nA survey of these classical models can be found in . The use of time-series features including packet size and direction sequences, first suggested in  as a side channel to attack TOR, was shown to be especially effective across models. With the widespread adoption of deep neural networks, numerous deep architectures were employed for ETC including Multi-Layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks, Gated Recurrent Units, Stacked AutoEncoders, and Transformers (      [ref]32 [ref]33) and shown to be effective on private datasets    as well as open research datasets   . By and large, some works such as   [ref]33 primarily focus on designing representations of traffic data for well-known architectures, while others like    [ref]32  focus on designing deep architectures tailored for well-known network traffic data representations. This paper focuses on automating the latter, more precisely, automatically designing an optimized architecture for a specific traffic data representation and a particular dataset. In an attempt to obtain a more realistic evaluation of the proposed ETC models in the literature, including classical and deep models,   performed comparative studies of existing model performances on real-world datasets.  shows that the performances of deep and classical models are close, with 1D-CNN and MLP winning over Random Forest by a small margin.  highlights the importance of parameter tuning and shows that by simply tuning the maximum tree depth, XGBoost can significantly outperform CNN methods. The importance of hyper-parameter tuning is a driving factor in this work, although we take the opposite direction from ’s experiments with XGBoost, and focus on finding the best hyper-parameters and architecture for a CNN. Following our previous work, , in which we highlight the challenges along the way of manually adapting a successful deep architecture to new traffic traces, in this work, we explore a way to automate the manual process, given a dataset and a space of hyper-parameters. AutoML was recently employed for traffic classification in  0. Both  and 0 focus on designing traffic representations for efficient classification performance. While  proposes a normalized packet-level representation, 0 proposes a process for extracting flow-level features from sequences of packet size and directions. They both use the publicly available AutoGluon tool 1. AutoGluon’s approach to AutoML is different from NAS. Rather than opting to find the best model hyperparameters, it creates ensembles of several models by stacking them in layers. It is designed to be fast and simple to use by non-experts. Its base models include classical and deep models. For example,  uses six types of base models including tree-based methods, deep neural networks, and neighbors-based classifiers. A similar ensemble-based method is employed in Mljar 2, a python AutoML package employed in 3 for malware detection. However, Mljar only includes classical machine learning models as base models, hence, 3 is further from our work than the former two."
