    "introduction": "Extraction of plant cell nuclei depicted in a microscopy\nimage  (a) via sublevel set components of the color brightness\nscalar field that has been simplified based on different strategies (b-d).\nWithout any simplification (b), the extracted cells contain numerous false\npositives in the form of undesired components that result from non-persistent\nextrema.\nBridging (c) removes undesired extrema only in a topological sense, by\ncreating bridges from undesired extrema towards desired ones, which simply\nattaches undesired to desired components via noticeable line artifacts.\nFlattening (d) completely removes components that are associated with\nundesired extrema while preserving the shape of desired\ncomponents. In many applications, datasets produced by acquisition or simulation\ncurrently reach unprecedented levels in terms of size and complexity.\nThis motivates the design of advanced analysis tools capable of extracting the\nrelevant information from such datasets, and supporting its\ninterpretation through interactive visualization and analysis.\nThis is the purpose of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) ,\nwhich provides a family of generic, robust, and efficient techniques for the\nextraction of the inherent structural information in the data.\nIt has been successfully applied over the last two decades in a number of\nvisualization and analysis tasks .\nPopular applications include astrophysics 4 ,\nbiological imaging   ,\nchemistry  7 ,\nfluid dynamics\\julien   ,\nmaterial sciences    ,\nand turbulent combustion  .\nFor scalar data, TDA introduces a number of topological abstractions that capture various types of structural features, such as\nthe persistence diagram 0,\nthe contour tree  9,\nthe Reeb graph   ,\nand the Morse-Smale complex    . An important aspect of TDA is its ability to provide multi-scale representations of the aforementioned abstractions, which enables users to distinguish noise from features (Figs. Localized Topological Simplification of Scalar Data and 1).\nThese representations are a critical component in many applications to support multi-scale analysis and visualization.\nIn particular, several importance measures have been introduced to estimate the\nrelevance of the features of interest represented by the critical points of the scalar field (Sec. 3.1).\nSuch measures include topological persistence 0\nand geometrical measures on level sets .\nMoreover, as the notion of a feature of interest greatly depends on the application,\nusers often characterize the importance of extrema\nwith ad-hoc importance measures.\nFor instance, Carr et al. \nshowed that importance measures based on a hyper-volume were often more\neffective for medical data than topological persistence, and\nGuenther et al. 7 demonstrated that critical points corresponding to relevant chemical interactions can be isolated by combined thresholding of multiple chemical quantitites.\nIn general, once an importance measure has been established, multi-scale\nrepresentations in TDA can be obtained either in\n(i) a post-processing step (by iteratively simplifying the computed abstractions), or in\n(ii) a pre-processing step (by simplifying the data before computing the topological abstractions).\nIn the first case (i), a tailored algorithm based on iterative cancellations\nmust be derived for each \\jonasRevisionspecific topological abstraction.\n\\jonasRevision\nIn the second case (ii), the values of the original scalar field have\nto be altered in a pre-processing step such that the resulting simplified\nscalar\nfield only exhibits extrema deemed relevant by\nsome\nimportance measure\nwhile still being\nclose\nto the original scalar field.\nAlthough the latter strategy requires a perturbation of the original scalar\nfield,\nit\nhas the advantage of being generic (since\nany importance measure can be used to classify critical points)\nand agnostic (since the simplified scalar field can be used like any other\nscalar field as an input for subsequent TDA).\nThis strategy decouples the simplification from the topological\nabstractions themselves,\nwhich enables software frameworks—such as the Topology ToolKit (TTK) —to mutualize and\nmodularize implementations of different algorithms.\nSpecifically, all topological abstractions computed with TTK on the\nsimplified field—e.g. critical points ,\nmerge 8 and contour trees 9, Reeb\ngraphs , and Morse-Smale complexes —benefit\nfrom the same pre-simplification without being aware that the input field was\nactually simplified. This is particularly useful in advanced analysis\nscenarios\ncomining\nmultiple abstractions 7 .\nFinally, the pre-simplification of the scalar field does not prohibit further post-simplification of the computed abstractions.\nFor these reasons, this paper focuses on the pre-simplification of scalar data. In addition to the approaches introduced for the persistence-driven\ntopological simplification of scalar data 1  ,\nTierny and Pascucci proposed a generic algorithm that supports arbitrary importance measures 6.\nThese simplification algorithms can \\jonasRevisionagain be classified\ninto\ntwo strategies:\nbridging (a.k.a. carving) and flattening (a.k.a. flooding).\nIn short, bridging connects undesired contours to desired\nones\nvia small bridges \\jonasRevision(technically, along separatrices), thus only\nremoving them in a topological\nsense (Sec. 1c).\nIn contrast, flattening completely removes contours induced by undesired extrema while preserving the shape of desired contours (Sec. 1d).\n\\jonasRevisionHowever, both strategies are limited to the removal of\nextremum-saddle pairs, which notably excludes saddle-saddle pair removal in\n3D (Sec. 5.3).\nAdditionally, the two strategies have an impact on feature geometry as they alter the underlying scalar field.\nIn particular, bridging adds line artifacts between contours, and flattening introduces flat-plateaus that also impact contained integral lines.\n\\jonasRevisionBut most importantly, despite the acceptable asymptotic complexity (linearithmic time) of both strategies, existing algorithms suffer from performance issues due to their global and sequential nature.\nSpecifically, simplification can empirically account for up to 90% of overall\ncomputation time in many TDA pipelines (Sec. 5.2). This paper revisits the problem of topological simplification of scalar data to address this performance issue.\nGiven a scalar field f𝑓f and a selection of extrema to preserve,\nthe proposed algorithm creates, based on localized flattening, a function g𝑔g\nthat only exhibits the selected set of extrema and has a small distance\n‖f−g‖∞subscriptnorm𝑓𝑔||f-g||_{\\infty}\nfor data fitting purposes.\nMoreover, the proposed localized topological simplification (LTS) algorithm (Sec. 4) is output-sensitive as it only visits the regions of the data where simplification is needed; resulting in an immediate speedup over previous approaches.\nDue to its localized nature, it can be parallelized, and we present—to our knowledge—the first parallel approach to topological simplification of scalar data.\nWe provide performance benchmarks obtained with our\nOpenMP  implementation that achieves a high parallel\nefficiency (\\julien70%).\nFor the\ncase where\nthe considered importance measure is topological\npersistence,\nwe present a variant of our framework adapted to persistence-driven\nsimplification.\nGiven an input threshold ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon, we show how to efficiently\ncombine LTS with a partial\ncomputation of the persistence diagram.\nFor applications where a relevant value of ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon can be estimated a priori, this further improves performance.\nExtensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data on a\ncommodity workstation\nreport an observed speedup of ×\\times363636 compared to previous approaches.\nThis significant improvement is illustrated in various TDA scenarios (Sec. 5.2),\nwhere LTS brings the overall analysis time from minutes down to seconds, hence enabling interactive multi-scale exploration of the features present in the data. Contributions 1) Localized Topological Simplification (LTS) (Sec. 4)\nIn contrast to state-of-the-art approaches, which visit the entire input domain, LTS only processes the regions of the domain where the data actually needs simplification.\nThis makes LTS output sensitive, which is particularly relevant for the problem of topological simplification, as noise frequently corresponds to a small fraction of the input domain.\nIn the presented experiments (Sec. 5), this already yields an average speedup over previous, global approaches between ×\\times333 and ×\\times555. 2) Parallel Topological Simplification (Sec. 4.4)\nLTS can be efficiently parallelized due to its localized nature.\nThe presented experiments demonstrate that a shared-memory parallel implementation based on OpenMP yields a high parallel efficiency on real-life datasets (\\julien70%).\nOn a commodity workstation, this results in an overall speedup of ×\\times363636 over previous, sequential approaches. 3) Parallel Persistence-Driven\nSimplification (Sec. 4.5)\nFor the special case where extrema are selected based on topological persistence,\nan adapted version of LTS partially computes the persistence diagram and simultaneously simplifies all features below a given persistence threshold.\nFor applications where persistence is a relevant criterion and a threshold is known a priori, this specialized algorithm further improves performances.\nThis scenario is particularly relevant for batch and in situ processing, where noise below a conservative threshold can be removed prior to any analysis. 4) Reference Implementation (additional material)\nWe provide a reference C++ implementation of all presented algorithms\nthat can be used to replicate the experiments of Sec. 5\nand to perform benchmarks."
