  "sections": {
    "related work": "Uncertainty Quantification and Application.\nAccording to the source of uncertainty, there are two types of uncertainty: epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric Uncertainty [ref]29. Aleatoric uncertainty is also known as data uncertainty, which originates from randomness in the data generation process [ref]29. The data mislabeling can be detected and addressed with this uncertainty [ref]11 . The uncertainty has also been used to enhance the reliability and robustness of predictions against possible noise and corruption.\nHowever, most methods are not designed for recommender systems. The epistemic uncertainty, which quantifies how uncertain a model is , is less related to us. It is usually used to detect the out-of-distribution samples in risk-sensitive fields  [ref]32, such as automatic control  and disease detection [ref]32. There is also the work  focusing on the label noise problem by leveraging both epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty.\nIt is worth mentioning that our AUR framework is inspired by [ref]11. We similarly assume that the labels obey Gaussian Distribution and learn the variance in a similar way. However, there are still some essential differences. [ref]11 trains the uncertainty to obtain a better expectation model, while we make recommendations based on the value of uncertainty. And they do not focus on\nthe improvement of tail prediction. There are some efforts to model and utilize the uncertainty in recommendation    .\nThe first line of research focuses on epistemic uncertainty   .  models the uncertainty of user/item representation to expand users’ and items’ interaction space, aiming at alleviating the cold-start problem.  employs Gaussian embedding, i.e., endowing the randomness to the embedding, to adaptively capture the uncertain preference exhibited by some users.  introduces epistemic uncertainty to generate diverse recommendations for cold-start users. Different from them, we aim at modeling the uncertainty of data instead of the model. Secondly,   pay attention to modeling the uncertainty from the data perspective.\n considers the multi-task scenarios and takes the uncertainty to identify the importance of different tasks.\n introduces aleatoric uncertainty to mitigate the inherent noise in pseudo labels when distilling the knowledge from the teacher model.\nDifferent from them, we consider a single task and directly take use of uncertainties to generate recommendations. Besides,   model both the epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty in reinforcement learning-based recommendation. Their goal is to do better exploration and exploitation trade-offs with both the uncertainty and model normal prediction. Differently, we focus on collaborative filtering and pay attention to the mislabeling issue instead of the exploration and exploitation trade-off.  introduces Gaussian Process to make more accurate predictions for explicit recommendation, while we focus on addressing the mislabeling issue for implicit recommendation. Popularity Bias in Recommendation.\nTail item recommendation performance is very related to the popularity bias problem  , which has gotten huge attention in the recommendation community. To deal with the popularity bias problem, existing methods can be divided into four different categories: 1) IPS-based methods    deal with the problem by re-weighting training samples with propensities. However, the propensities are hard to set properly, causing high variance problems . 2) Utilizing uniform data    to guide the model to be unbiased. However, uniform data is usually small and expensive to gain. 3) The methods based on post-hoc re-ranking or model regularization  0 usually need to heuristically design the re-ranking or regularization polices. 4) Causal inference-based methods such as   first take prior knowledge to create a causal graph to model the recommendation process, and then take intervention or counterfactual inference to eliminate the popularity bias. While the prior knowledge is not easy to get. Representation balancing, a causally deconfounding technique, is also used to deal with the MNAR problem .\nDifferent from all these methods, we take uncertainty modeling to address the mislabeling issue to achieve better recommendation performance for tail items. Data mislabeling.\nTo solve the mislabeling issue, i.e., the positive-unlabeled issue, there are two main strategies: re-weighting and sampling. Reweghting-based methods try to solve the problem by identifying mislabeled samples and assigning lower/higher weights for them/others. 1   2 take heuristic strategies for reweighting, such as assigning higher weights for unlabeled but popular items 2. 3 proposes to learn these weights instead of heuristically designing.\nTo solve the mislabeling issue, sampling-based methods avoid selecting the potential positive but unlabeled samples. There are many sampling methods 4   5 . 4 proposes a neighborhood-aware sampling strategy – avoiding sampling items interacted by neighbors.  gives higher sampling probabilities for unlabeled samples that have higher exposure probabilities. While the exposure probabilities are hard to be estimated well,  resorts to knowledge graph to design a sampling strategy. Besides, 5  directly estimates the probability of mislabeling with a Bayesian framework, and samples negatives based on this probability. Different to the two types of method, we learn the uncertainty of samples, and take the uncertainty as the mislabeling probability. Moreover, we directly take the uncertainty to form recommendation scores instead of utilizing them to re-weight or sample data."
