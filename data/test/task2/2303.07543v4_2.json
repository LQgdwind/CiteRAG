    "scoring functions for pretrained models": "One line of work explores scoring functions to distinguish inliers and\noutliers, which is fundamental to the OOD detection task.\nMultiple designs have been proposed for pretrained deep visual classifiers    6   [ref]20 [ref]25 [ref]29     .\nThe most straightforward design is Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) score, which considers the network confidence as an uncertainty measurement.\nODIN  improves MSP’s performance via two calibration techniques - input preprocessing and temperature scaling.\nLogit-space methods involve max logit [ref]20 and energy score .\nThe latter is further enhanced by feature rectification .\nHuang et al. [ref]25 and Lee et al. [ref]29 investigate gradient space, which demonstrates effectiveness in revealing ID and OOD distinction.\nThose methods achieve great performance on several OOD detection benchmarks, but are tailored to the classification task and not applicable to pretrained visual encoders since they are dependent on classifier outputs.\nOn the other hand, methods based on feature space analysis, such as Mahalanobis  and KNN , not only exhibit exceptional OOD detection performance for classification models, but also showcase applicability to stand-alone visual encoders, including SupCon   and CLIP  4.\nSubspace analysis    measures the residual information from low-dimensional manifold  or column space of classifier weights.\nHowever, to achieve state-of-the-art performance, the result needs to be converted to classifier output space to factor in class-dependent information .\nIn this work, we combine the residual and discriminative information solely\nin the feature space via Linear Discriminant Analysis, which makes our\nmethod applicable to any visual encorder."
