    "approximation and complexity": "In , a useful framework for studying the complexity of fixed point computation problems is defined, which considers both exact computation and approximate computation of the solutions to such problems. The authors introduce the complexity class FIXP, show that many fixed point problems can be shown to belong to this class, and establish that there exist FIXP-complete problems under a suitable notion of reducibility. cds-clearing is, as we have seen, a fixed point problem, hence we consider the problem within the framework of . We introduce in this section some fundamental notions related to exact and approximate computation of fixed points, and define the complexity class FIXP and some related classes. Let F𝐹F be a continuous function that maps a compact convex set to itself (and note that fIsubscript𝑓𝐼f_{I}, for instances I∈cds-clearing𝐼cds-clearingI\\in\\textsc{cds-clearing} is such a function), and let ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0 be a small constant. A weak ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-approximate fixed point of F𝐹F is a point x𝑥x such that its image is within a distance ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon of x𝑥x, i.e., ‖x−F​(x)‖∞<ϵsubscriptnorm𝑥𝐹𝑥italic-ϵ\\|x-F(x)\\|_{\\infty}<\\epsilon.\nA strong ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-approximate fixed point of F𝐹F is a point x𝑥x that is within a distance ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon near a fixed point of F𝐹F, i.e., ∃x′:F​(x′)=x′∧‖x′−x‖∞<ϵ:superscript𝑥′𝐹superscript𝑥′superscript𝑥′subscriptnormsuperscript𝑥′𝑥italic-ϵ\\exists x^{\\prime}:F(x^{\\prime})=x^{\\prime}\\wedge\\|x^{\\prime}-x\\|_{\\infty}<\\epsilon.\nA weak ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-approximate is generally not located close to an actual fixed point, and an example of this in the case of cds-clearing can be found in Appendix A. Moreover, under a mild condition on the fixed point problem under consideration, known as polynomial continuity, a strong approximation is also a weak approximation (see Proposition 1 and the definition below), which explains the use of the terms “strong” and “weak”. Formally a fixed point problem ΠΠ\\Pi is defined as a search problem such that for every instance I∈Π𝐼ΠI\\in\\Pi there is an associated continuous function FI:DI→DI:subscript𝐹𝐼→subscript𝐷𝐼subscript𝐷𝐼F_{I}:D_{I}\\rightarrow D_{I} where DI⊆ℝnsubscript𝐷𝐼superscriptℝ𝑛D_{I}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^{n} (for some n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N}) is compact and convex, such that the solutions of I𝐼I are the fixed points of FIsubscript𝐹𝐼F_{I}. The problem ΠΠ\\Pi is said to be polynomially computable if there is a polynomial q𝑞q such that (i.) DIsubscript𝐷𝐼D_{I} is a convex polytope described by a set of at most q​(|I|)𝑞𝐼q(|I|) linear inequalities, each with coefficients of a size at most q​(|I|)𝑞𝐼q(|I|), and (ii.) For each x𝑥x in DI∩ℚnsubscript𝐷𝐼superscriptℚ𝑛D_{I}\\cap\\mathbb{Q}^{n}, the value FI​(x)subscript𝐹𝐼𝑥F_{I}(x) can be computed in time q​(|I|+size​(x))𝑞𝐼size𝑥q(|I|+\\text{size}(x)). Here, the “size” of a rational number means the number of bits needed to represent the numerator and the denominator in binary. Furthermore ΠΠ\\Pi is said to be polynomially continuous if there is a polynomial q𝑞q such that for each I∈Π𝐼ΠI\\in\\Pi, and rational ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0, there is a rational δ𝛿\\delta of size q​(|I|+size​(ϵ))𝑞𝐼sizeitalic-ϵq(|I|+\\text{size}(\\epsilon)) satisfying the following: for all x,y∈DI𝑥𝑦subscript𝐷𝐼x,y\\in D_{I} with ‖x−y‖∞<δsubscriptnorm𝑥𝑦𝛿\\|x-y\\|_{\\infty}<\\delta it holds that ‖FI​(x)−FI​(y)‖∞<ϵsubscriptnormsubscript𝐹𝐼𝑥subscript𝐹𝐼𝑦italic-ϵ\\|F_{I}(x)-F_{I}(y)\\|_{\\infty}<\\epsilon.\nNote that this condition defining polynomial continuity is the formally correct way of stating that the distance between any two points in the domain does not increase a lot (at most by a “polynomial amount”) when taking their images under FIsubscript𝐹𝐼F_{I}.555The above collection of definitions is stated in a more extensive and refined way in  in order to capture a more versatile collection of search problems. However, for the sake of our discourse, this simplified presentation suffices. A fixed point problem ΠΠ\\Pi has an associated weak and strong approximation versions: In the weak approximation version we are given an instance I𝐼I of ΠΠ\\Pi and a rational ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0, and we need to compute a weak ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-approximate fixed point for FIsubscript𝐹𝐼F_{I}. The strong approximation version is defined analogously. Let ΠΠ\\Pi be a fixed point problem. If ΠΠ\\Pi is polynomially continuous, then the weak approximation version of ΠΠ\\Pi polynomial-time reduces to the strong approximation version of ΠΠ\\Pi. If ΠΠ\\Pi is polynomially continuous and polynomially computable, then the weak approximation version of ΠΠ\\Pi is in PPAD.\n666The reader might be familiar with PPAD, which is a complexity class introduced in [ref]20. Further below, we provide an indirect definition of PPAD in Proposition 2, through defining the complexity class Linear-FIXP. With regard to cds-clearing, it is straightforward to verify that cds-clearing is polynomially computable. Furthermore,  establishes implicitly that cds-clearing is polynomially continuous under a (very) mild assumption that the authors call non-degeneracy. A financial system is non-degenerate iff Every debtor in a CDS either has positive external assets or is the debtor in at least one debt contract with a positive notional. Every bank that acts as a reference bank in some CDS is the debtor of at least one debt contract with a positive notional. We will make this assumption as well throughout our paper, both for the sake of compatibility with  and for the analytical convenience that non-degeneracy provides us (note that in particular, a division by 0 never occurs in (4) when considering a non-degenerate instance).777We note that point 2 of our definition of non-degeneracy was not included in the definition in . However, the assumption we denote by Point 2 is made throughout their paper, but was left unnamed. We chose to include this assumption in the non-degeneracy notion for convenience, rather than leaving it without a name.\nHence, we define cds-clearing to contain only non-degenerate financial networks. In , the authors furthermore show that the weak approximation version of cds-clearing is PPAD-hard, which yields PPAD-completeness of the weak approxmation version of cds-clearing. The polynomial continuity of cds-clearing shows that the strong approximation version of cds-clearing is at least as hard as its weak approximation version. Despite that computing weak approximations for cds-clearing is already known to be PPAD-hard, and that computing strong approximations must therefore be at least as hard due to Point 1 of Proposition 1, we are still interested in understanding the complexity of computing such strong approximations due to the fact that, as noted above, weakly approximate clearing vectors are difficult to justify from the point of view of a regulator who has the responsibility of actually realising the clearing of a financial system: Weakly approximate clearing vectors are potentially very far removed from the actual exact clearing vectors of a financial system. Clearing a system by means of a weakly approximate vector may result in defaults of banks that would not be in default under the true clearing vectors of the system, and non-defaulting banks may similarly end up with vastly different surplus assets after clearing than they would have under a true clearing vector. Strong approximations do not suffer from this problem, as they guarantee that the correct set of banks default and that the equity of all banks after clearing is indeed accurate (of course, up to ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon accuracy). We demonstrate and prove the claims of the above discussion through an illustrative example in Appendix A. Our example supports and motivates the research of strong approximations. To study the strong approximation and exact versions of fixed point problems, the authors of  introduce the class FIXP, and a few derived classes, among which are Linear-FIXP and FIXPasubscriptFIXP𝑎\\textsf{FIXP}_{a}. The class FIXP consists of all fixed point problems ΠΠ\\Pi that are polynomially computable, and for which for all I∈Π𝐼ΠI\\in\\Pi the function FI:DI→DI:subscript𝐹𝐼→subscript𝐷𝐼subscript𝐷𝐼F_{I}:D_{I}\\rightarrow D_{I} can be represented by an algebraic circuit CIsubscript𝐶𝐼C_{I} over the basis A={+,−,∗,max,min}𝐴A=\\{+,-,*,\\max,\\min\\}, using rational constants, such that CIsubscript𝐶𝐼C_{I} computes FIsubscript𝐹𝐼F_{I}, and CIsubscript𝐶𝐼C_{I} can be constructed from I𝐼I in time polynomial in |I|𝐼|I|.\nIn more detail, the circuit CIsubscript𝐶𝐼C_{I} is an acyclic directed graph over a set of gates, say g1,…,gmsubscript𝑔1…subscript𝑔𝑚g_{1},\\ldots,g_{m} (in topological order), with the following properties. There are n𝑛n gates in the first (bottom) layer of the circuit, called the input gates, where n𝑛n is the number of arguments of FIsubscript𝐹𝐼F_{I}. Similarly there are n𝑛n output gates in the last (top) layer of the circuit, called the output gates. The remaining nodes of the circuit each represent rational constants and arithmetic operations from the set A𝐴A. Rational constant nodes have no incoming arcs, and each arithmetic operation node has two incoming arcs. The number of outgoing arcs from each node is not bounded. We may now label CIsubscript𝐶𝐼C_{I}’s input nodes with an input x∈DI𝑥subscript𝐷𝐼x\\in D_{I} (coordinate-wise), and define the output of CIsubscript𝐶𝐼C_{I} by propagating the outputs of each of the nodes through the network via the arcs outgoing from each of the nodes. Naturally, an input node propagates its labeled value, a rational constant node propagates the associated rational number, and an arithmetic operation node takes the two values propagated through its incoming arcs as operands, and applies the corresponding operation on its operands, which it then propagates through its outgoing arcs. The circuit CIsubscript𝐶𝐼C_{I} is then said to compute FIsubscript𝐹𝐼F_{I} iff the output of CIsubscript𝐶𝐼C_{I} on input x𝑥x equals FI​(x)subscript𝐹𝐼𝑥F_{I}(x) for all x∈DI𝑥subscript𝐷𝐼x\\in D_{I}. The class FIXPasubscriptFIXP𝑎\\textsf{FIXP}_{a} is defined as the class of search problems that are the strong approximation version of some fixed point problem that belongs to FIXP. The class Linear-FIXP is defined analogously to FIXP, but under the smaller arithmetic basis where only the gates {+,−max,min}\\{+,-\\max,\\min\\} and multiplication by rational constants are used (thus, arbitrary multiplication is removed from the basis). The classes FIXP, Linear-FIXP, and FIXPasubscriptFIXP𝑎\\textsf{FIXP}_{a} admit complete problems. Hardness of a search problem ΠΠ\\Pi for FIXP (resp. Linear-FIXP and FIXPasubscriptFIXP𝑎\\textsf{FIXP}_{a}) is defined through the existence of a polynomial time computable function ρ:Π′→Π:𝜌→superscriptΠ′Π\\rho:\\Pi^{\\prime}\\rightarrow\\Pi, for all Π∈FIXPΠFIXP\\Pi\\in\\textsf{FIXP} (resp. FIXPasubscriptFIXP𝑎\\textsf{FIXP}_{a}), such that the solutions of I𝐼I can be obtained from the solutions of ρ​(I)𝜌𝐼\\rho(I) by applying a (polynomial-time computable) linear transformation on a subset of ρ​(I)𝜌𝐼\\rho(I)’s coordinates. This type of reduction is known as a polynomial time SL-reduction. We mention a few important facts about these complexity classes that are relevant for understanding the results in our present work. The following proposition states that strong approximations to problems in FIXP can be found in polynomial space. FIXPa⊆PSPACEsubscriptFIXP𝑎PSPACE\\textsf{FIXP}_{a}\\subseteq\\textsf{PSPACE}. The following result shows that finding exact fixed points of fixed point functions expressible through only the operations {+,−,max,min}\\{+,-,\\max,\\min\\} and multiplication by rational constants, is equivalent to solving problems in PPAD. Linear-FIXP=PPADLinear-FIXPPPAD\\textsf{Linear-FIXP}=\\textsf{PPAD}. Consequently, the solutions of instances in Linear-FIXP are always rationals of polynomial size. One detail that we have omitted so far in our definition of FIXP (for simplicity) is that formally FIXP and Linear-FIXP are defined to also include their closures under polynomial time separable linear reductions and polynomial time reductions respectively.888The term “separable linear” refers to the property that solutions of the reduced instance correspond to solutions of the original instance through a polynomial-time computable linear transformation of a subset of the coordinates of the reduced instance’s solution. The authors of  require separable linearity for FIXP-reductions, but not for Linear-FIXP reductions. This is due to the fact that the fixed points of functions belonging to FIXP may be irrational, and linearly separable reductions preserve the approximation properties of approximate fixed points. For Linear-FIXP, the fixed points are always rational, and one is generally interested in exact computation for this class. Thus, the traditional notion of polynomial-time reducibility is appropriate here.. We remark furthermore that in the initial definition of FIXP, which was given in , the division operator and the operators ⋅k𝑘⋅\\sqrt[k]{\\cdot} for k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N} were included in the arithmetic base. However, in the same paper the authors show that these can be dropped without altering the class. Similarly, the original definition of FIXP includes problems in which DIsubscript𝐷𝐼D_{I} is an arbitrary polytope with a polynomially computable set of constraints, but restricting this to  nsuperscript01𝑛 ^{n} turns out to not change the class. An informal understanding of how the hardness of FIXP compares to PPAD (or Linear-FIXP) is as follows. PPAD captures a type of computational hardness stemming from an essentially combinatorial source, as PPAD was originally defined as a class that captures the hardness computing a solution to a graph-theoretical problem, where the solution is guaranteed to exist via a non-constructive parity argument. The class FIXP introduces on top of that a type of numerical hardness that emerges from the introduction of multiplication and division operations: These operations give rise to irrationality in the exact solutions to these problems, and may independently also require the computation of rational numbers of very high precision or very high magnitude (which is enabled by the presence of the multiplication operation, by which one can perform successive squaring inside the associated algebraic circuit)."
