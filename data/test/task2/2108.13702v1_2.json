    "related work": "Image Extrapolation: Prior works in image synthesis have had great breakthroughs in image inpainting 6 [ref]43 [ref]45 , conditional image synthesis     , and unconditional image synthesis   . On the contrary, image extrapolation models have been relatively less successful. The works on image extrapolation can be broadly classified based on whether they use non-parametric methods or parametric methods. Several non-parametric methods   have been able to perform only a limited peripheral texture extension. Furthermore, their heuristics do not capture the variation in color, texture and the information of shape and structure of an object. These methods  limit themselves to simple pattern extrapolation and are very brittle to increasing extrapolation. Other classical approaches  leverage patch matching to extrapolate the image. However, these methods are limited in their ability to generate new objects or hallucinate new textures.\nWith the advent of GAN 0 based approaches, significant progress has been made in image extrapolation.   7 use a single-stage method to extrapolate the input image. Most of these works deal with scene completion using object completion or merely extending the significant texture near the image boundary. 9 proposed a method of feature expansion from input region to predict context for the extrapolated image, while 2 generates the extrapolated image by incrementally extending image on each side using a generated reference image. Consequently, as we go further from the input boundary, the relative volume information from input reduces resulting in the generation of substandard extrapolation.\nMoreover, all of these approaches currently lack the semantic understanding of the scene and semantic structure of objects in the scene.\n\nSemantic Editing for Image Manipulation:\nRecently, there have been a few works that manipulate images by editing in the semantic label space.  concentrates on synthesizing images using semantic label space but in an unconditional setting, where the semantic label space is generated from scratch from a random seed. 4 2 proposed methods to insert an object in an image by editing the semantic label of the input image, given the class information and the bounding box of the object. Such methods are unsuitable to be adapted for image out-painting as we do not have the class information and the bounding boxes for the new objects to be inserted in the extrapolated region. Another drawback of such methods is that they require as many forward passes as the number of the new objects and hence are not scalable in terms of time complexity. 1 proposes to edit an image by allowing the user to provide a semantic guideline of the regions to be manipulated. Different from the above works, our image extrapolation method automatically extrapolates the semantic label map of the image without any user input and estimates the corresponding panoptic label map for the extrapolated image to be generated. The closest work to ours is an in-painting model, SPGNet 5 where the hole in an image is firstly filled in the semantic label space before the final image is generated. However, unlike SPGNet, we generate an estimate of panoptic label map, along with the semantic extrapolation, and further leverage it to ensure texture transfer for the extrapolated instances and sharp instance boundaries in the final image. We show through experiments that our method is significantly better than SPGNet."
