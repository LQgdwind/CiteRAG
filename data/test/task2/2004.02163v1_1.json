    "centralized algorithms—related work": "As the digital data and computing power of the processors are increasing, in the past decade, there has been a strong focus on developing the parallel versions of stochastic algorithms. Based on the communication protocol, these parallel algorithms can be broadly classified as centralized (that follows a master-worker architecture) and decentralized (for example, Allreduce communication strategy, see  ). In this paper we will follow the centralized set-up, where a master node coordinates with all the worker nodes.\nDepending on the update rule, the centralized algorithms can be further categorized into two categories—synchronous and asynchronous. In this scope, for completeness, we will quote a few representatives of each of those categories. While Zinkevich et al.  proposed and analyzed synchronous parallel SGD, Richtárik and Takáč in [ref]34 showed by parallelizing, randomized block coordinate descent methods can be accelerated. Yang  proposed a distributed stochastic dual coordinate ascent algorithm in a star-shaped distributed network, and analyzed the trade-off between computation and communication. In a similar sprit, Jaggi et al.  proposed Communication-efficient distributed dual Coordinate Ascent or COCOA that uses an arbitrary dual optimization method on the local data on each computing node in parallel and reduces communication (we refer to the references in   for distributed primal-dual methods; additionally, see  for application to distributed MPC). Fercoq and Richtárik in  proposed APPROX or Accelerated Parallel PROXimal method—a unison of three ideas, that is, acceleration, parallelization, and proximal method. In , Richtárik and Takáč proposed and analyzed a hybrid coordinate descent method known as HYDRA that partitions the coordinates over the nodes, independently from the other nodes, and applies updates to the selected coordinates in parallel (we also refer to   and HYDRA-2  for more insights). In a similar line of work, Shamir et al.  proposed a distributed approximate Newton-type method or DANE. Synchronous stochastic algorithms are well explored regarding their convergence rates, acceleration, and parallelization  . However, they may suffer from the memory locking, that is, the processors or the computing nodes need to wait for the update from the slowest node. Hogwild! by Recht et al.  is one of the prime example of asynchronous stochastic algorithms and first one of its kind which do not use the memory locking protocol and as a result, the computing nodes can modify the parameters at the same time. De Sa et al.  proposed Buckwild! which is a low-precision asynchronous SGD. Additionally, they analyzed Hogwild! type algorithms with relaxed assumptions and analyzed asynchronous SGD algorithms for (non-convex) matrix-completion type problems (also see ). Chaturapruek et al.  showed that for convex problems, under similar conditions as regular SGD, asynchronous SGD achieves similar asymptotic convergence rate. However, as in  the perturbed iterate analysis of Mania et al.  and Leblond et al. 0 for proving the convergence of asynchronous SGD use rigorous sparsity assumption.\nNoel et al. 9 proposed Dogwild! that is distributed hogwild for CPU and GPU. In the advent of the deep neural networks, asynchronous parallel SGD type algorithms are highly deployed in practice. Recently, Lian et al.  showed that in their setting, proposed asynchronous parallel algorithms can achieve a linear speedup if the number of workers are bounded by the square root of the total number of iterations. In 2017, Zheng et al. 4 proposed an algorithm called delay compensated asynchronous SGD (DC-ASGD) for training deep neural networks and to compensate the delayed gradient update by the local workers to the global model. With experimental validity on deep neural networks, Zheng et al. claimed that their DC-ASGD outperforms both synchronous SGD and asynchronous SGD, and nearly approaches the performance of sequential SGD. Among the others, asynchronous algorithms by Aytekin et. al , distributed SDCA by Ma et. al , distributed SVRG by Lee et. al,  and Zhao and Li 3, asynchronous parallel SAGA by Leblond et al. 0, proximal asynchronous SAGA by Pedregosa et al. , are to name a few. We refer the readers to   for an in-depth understanding. We provide a table of the most frequently used notation in this paper for convenience (See Appendix B).\nHere we include some basic notations. We write the matrices\nin bold uppercase letters and denote vectors and scalars by simple lowercase letters. We define the range space and null space of a matrix 𝐀∈ℝm×n𝐀superscriptℝ𝑚𝑛{\\bf A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n} as Im​(𝐀):={y∈ℝm:y=𝐀​x}assignIm𝐀conditional-set𝑦superscriptℝ𝑚𝑦𝐀𝑥{\\rm Im}({\\bf A}):=\\{y\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}:y={\\bf A}x\\} and N​(𝐀):={x∈ℝn:𝐀​x=0}assign𝑁𝐀conditional-set𝑥superscriptℝ𝑛𝐀𝑥0N({\\bf A}):=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}:{\\bf A}x=0\\}, respectively. We further define the Euclidean inner product as ⟨⋅,⋅⟩⋅⋅\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle and for a symmetric positive definite matrix 𝐁𝐁{\\bf B}, we denote ⟨⋅,⋅⟩𝐁subscript⋅⋅𝐁\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle_{{\\bf B}} as the 𝐁𝐁{\\bf B}-inner product and define ‖x‖𝐁=x⊤​𝐁​xsubscriptnorm𝑥𝐁superscript𝑥top𝐁𝑥\\|x\\|_{{\\bf B}}=\\sqrt{x^{\\top}{\\bf B}x} as the (semi)-norm induced by it. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review some key results related to the stochastic reformulation of linear systems and describe the synchronous parallel method by Richtárik and Takáč, in . Next in Section 3, we present our asynchronous parallel SGD. We compare the convergence rates of the asynchronous SGD with the synchronous parallel method in Section 4."
