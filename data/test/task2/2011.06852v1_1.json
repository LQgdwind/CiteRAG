    "iv-c performance comparison on veri-776": "The proposed DFR-ST is compared with state-of-the-art methods on a large-scale public dataset, i.e., VeRi-776, and the results are presented in Table II. Note that we\ndirectly copy state-of-the-art algorithms’ performance from the original papers instead of reproducing all methods. On VeRi-776, we compare our proposed DFR-ST with the following methods.\nLocal Maximal Occurrence Representaion (LOMO)  and Bag of Words with Color Name  (BOW-CN) are based on hand-craft features which are first proposed for person re-ID  .\nFACT  is based on the fusion with colors and attribute features.\nHard-View-EALN 4 and VAMI 3 impose an adversarial network between the generator and the discriminator to obtain more robust cross-view features.\nMoreover, SCCN-Ft + CLBL-8-Ft 2 utilizes two networks to learn the local and global multi-view features.\nOIN  produces region masks based on the clustering of key points and establishes overall features using these region masks and global features.\nSPAN w/ CPDM 7 detects different parts of vehicle images and then generates an attentive feature representation by aggregating the global and three-part attentive features together.\nBesides, RNN-HA (ResNet)  employs RNN to capture hierarchical dependencies for vehicle re-ID.\nHPGN 9 proposes a pyramid of the spatial graph networks to handle multi-scale spatial features.\nPRN + ReRanking  explores partition strategies on three dimensions of feature maps to promote overall performance further.\nMoreover, GRF+GGL 5 designs an efficient group-group loss to accelerate feature learning. QD-DLF 6 defines pooling operations on four directions to compress basic features and concatenates them together as deep quadruple features.\nSAVER 8 focuses on self-supervised attention mechanisms to improve vehicle re-ID algorithm.\nAs for methods using spatio-temporal clues, ReID + query expansion  ensembles multiple informative features from several existing approaches and builds an acquisition module for vehicle locations and timestamps.\nFACT+Plate-SNN+STR  and PROVID  both use a license plate recognition module and a spatio-temporal module based on FACT .\nOIN+ST  constructs a spatio-temporal regularization module in addition to OIN  while VAMI 3 + STR  integrates a spatio-temporal similarity to the original model. Table II illustrates the comparison results with state-of-the-art methods on VeRi-776. The methods listed in the upper part of Table II only use visual appearance information while those appeared in the lower part of Table II take both appearance and spatio-temporal cues into considerations. The proposed DFR-ST obtains the best Top-5 metric of 99.17% and achieves the highest mAP of 91.56% and Top-1 of 97.74% with the re-ranking strategy (DFR-ST + ReRanking). Firstly, compared with the approaches only based on visual appearance features, the proposed DFR-ST acquires the highest mAP of 91.56% and the highest Top-1 of 97.74%. This comparison verifies the intuition on the effectiveness of adding more information from other domains. Specifically, we notice that the Top-5 of PRN  is only a bit higher (0.23%) to our proposed DFR-ST. Although this observation indicates the advantage of the representation from , we show that the unexpected noises frequent in unconstrained environments would degrade the performance of PRN  while our proposed DFR-ST maintain acceptable performance in the ablation studies. This comparison result could validate the superiority of the proposed DFR-ST. Secondly, among six vehicle re-ID methods based on multi-modal information (i.e., FACT + Plate-SNN + STR , PROVID , OIN + ST , Siamese-CNN + Path-LSTM , VAMI 3 + STR , ReID + query expansion ), the proposed DFR-ST consistently outperforms FACT + Plate-SNN+STR , PROVID , OIN + ST  and Siamese-CNN + Path-LSTM  by exceeding over 30% on mAP, 12% on Top-1 and 5% on Top-5 at least.\nThis comparison demonstrates that DFR-ST can take advantage of multi-modal information exceedingly from designed spatio-temporal scheme.\nFig. 6 visualizes the vehicle re-ID results on VeRi-776 dataset qualitatively. The bounding boxes in green describe the true positives, and those in red are false positives."
