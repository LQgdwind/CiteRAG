    "introduction": "Spectrahedra are probably the most well studied shapes after\npolyhedra. We can represent polyhedra as the intersection of the\npositive orthant with an affine subspace. Spectrahedra generalize polyhedra,\nin the sense that they are the intersection of the cone of positive\nsemidefinite matrices —i.e., symmetric matrices with\nnon-negative eigenvalues— with an affine space.\nIn other words, a spectrahedron S⊂ℝn𝑆superscriptℝ𝑛S\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n} is the feasible set\nof a linear matrix inequality. That is, let where 𝑨isubscript𝑨𝑖\\bm{A}_{i} are symmetric matrices in ℝm×msuperscriptℝ𝑚𝑚\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times m}, then\nS={𝒙∈ℝn|𝑭​(𝒙)⪰0}𝑆conditional-set𝒙superscriptℝ𝑛succeeds-or-equals𝑭𝒙0S=\\{\\bm{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\,|\\,\\bm{F}(\\bm{x})\\succeq 0\\}, where ⪰succeeds-or-equals\\succeq denotes\npositive semidefiniteness. We assume throughout that S𝑆S is bounded of dimension\nn𝑛n. Spectrahedra are convex sets (Figures 2 and 4) and every polytope is a spectrahedron, but not the opposite.\nThey are the feasible regions of semidefinite programs  in the\nway that polyhedra are feasible regions of linear programs. Efficient methods for sampling points in spectrahedra are crucial for\nmany applications, such as volume approximation ,\nintegration , semidefinite\noptimization  , and applications in robust\ncontrol\nanalysis 1  . To\nsample in the interior or on the boundary of S𝑆S, we employ geometric\nrandom walks . A geometric random walk on S𝑆S starts\nat some interior point and at each step moves to a ”neighboring” point\nthat we choose according to some distribution, depending only on the\ncurrent point; thus it is a special category of Markov chains. For example, in\nthe so-called ball walk, we move to a point p𝑝p that we choose uniformly at\nrandom in a ball of fixed radius δ𝛿\\delta, if p∈S𝑝𝑆p\\in S. The complexity of a\nrandom walk depends on its mixing time —the number of steps required to bound\nthe distance between the current and the stationary distribution— and the\ncomplexity of the basic geometric operations performed at each step of the walk;\nwe call the latter per-step complexity. The majority of geometric random walks are defined for general convex bodies and\nare based on an oracle; usually the membership oracle. There are also a few walks,\ne.g., Vaidya walk  and the sub-linear ball walk ,\nspecialized for polytopes. Most results on their analysis focus on convergence\nand mixing time, while they define abstractly the operations they perform at\neach step and they enclose them in the corresponding oracle. That is why the\ncomplexity bounds involve the number of oracle calls. To specialize a random walk for a family or representation of convex\nbodies one has to come up with efficient algorithms for the basic\ngeometric operations to realize the (various) oracles. These\noperations should exploit the underlying geometric and algebraic\nproperties and are of independent interest.\nThey depend on efficient (numerical) linear algebra computations.\nMore importantly, they\ndominate the per-step complexity and are hence crucial both for the\noverall complexity to sample a point from the target distribution,\nas well as for an efficient implementation. The study of basic geometric operations to sample from non-linear convex objects\nfinds its roots in non-linear computational geometry. During the last two\ndecades, there are combined efforts   to develop\nefficient algorithms for the basic operations (predicates) that are behind\nclassical geometric algorithms, like convex hull, arrangements, Voronoi\ndiagrams, to go beyond points and lines and handle curved objects. For this, one\nexploits efficiently structure and symmetry in linear algebra computations, and\ndevelops novel algebraic tools. To our knowledge, only the Random Directions Hit and Run (W-HnR) random walk  has been\nstudied for spectrahedra . To exploit the various other\nwalks, like Ball walk , Billiard walk (W-Billard) ,\nand Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with boundary reflections (W-HMC-r) ,\none needs to provide geometric\noperations. For example, we need to compute the reflection of a curve at the\nboundary, and the intersection point of a curve with the boundary (of a\nspectrahedron). We should mention that there is a gap 7  between the\ntheoretical worst case bounds for the mixing times and the practical\nperformance of the random walk algorithms. Furthermore, there are random walks without known\ntheoretical mixing times, such as Coordinate Directions Hit and Run (W-CHnR), W-Billard and W-HMC-r. To study them experimentally,\nit is imperative to provide an efficient realization of the corresponding oracles."
