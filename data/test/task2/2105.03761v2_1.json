    "related work": "Common approaches to explainability of deep learning methods in computer vision are saliency maps [ref]1, attention maps 7, and activation vectors . Saliency and attention maps indicate where a model looks. This may tell us what regions of the image are most important in the decision-making process of a model. Activation vectors are a way to make sense of the inner representation of a model, e.g., by mapping it to human-known concepts. However, these approaches often cover only a fraction of the reasoning of a model. On the contrary, NLEs can convey higher-order reasoning and describe complex concepts. For example, in Figure 1, highlighted image regions or weights for different concepts would not be sufficient to explain the answer. Additionally, it has been shown that numerical or visual explanatory methods, in some cases, can be confusing even for data scientists  and can pose problems even for explaining trivial models . First adoptions of NLEs have been in image classification  and were further extended to self-driving cars [ref]26, VQA , and natural language processing [11; 39; 9; 6; 27; 35; 28; 12]. The most important works in VL-NLE [37; 46; 34] are included in this benchmark. Existing models learn to generate NLEs in a supervised manner and, therefore, require training sets of human-written explanations. Besides the image classification datasets ACT-X  and CUB [43; 23], and the video dataset BDD-X [ref]26, there are currently three VL datasets with NLEs. The VQA-X dataset  was introduced first and provides NLEs for a small subset of questions from VQA v2 . It consists of 33k QA pairs (28k images). However, many of the NLEs in VQA-X are trivial and could be guessed without looking at the image. For example, “because she is riding a wave on a surfboard” is an NLE for the answer “surfing” to the question “What is the woman in the image doing?” that can easily be guessed from the answer, without looking at the image (more examples are given in Figure 6).\nVQA-E  is another dataset that also builds on top of VQA v2. However, its explanations are gathered in an automatic way and were found to be of low quality by Marasović et al. , where the model-generated explanations obtain a human evaluation accuracy111Percentage of explanations that, given the image and question, support the predicted answer. that is only 3% short of the VQA-E ground-truth explanations (66.5%), suggesting that the dataset is essentially solved. It is therefore not used in our benchmark. Finally, the VCR dataset  provides NLEs for VQA instances that require substantial commonsense knowledge (see Figure 1). The questions are challenging, and therefore both the answers and NLEs are given in the form of multiple-choice options. Our proposed dataset, e-SNLI-VE, extends the range of VL-NLE datasets and addresses some of the prior limitations. It contains over 430k instances for which the explanations rely on the image content (see examples in Figure 6). We will describe the dataset in more detail in Section 3. Evaluating NLG is challenging and a much-studied field . Evaluating NLEs is even more difficult, as sentences may not only differ in their syntactic form but also in their semantic meaning, e.g., there can be several different reasons why a sentence contradicts an image. For this reason, current automatic NLG metrics, such as the BLEU score , do not perform well in evaluating NLEs . Hence, several works have used human evaluation to assess their generated explanations [37; 46; 34; 17]. However, they all used different evaluation rules, preventing one from being able to compare existing VL-NLE models. The main differences lie in the datasets used, the questions asked to annotators, whether the assessment is absolute or based on a ranking, and the formula used to calculate the final score. We select the best practices from existing evaluation schemes and develop a unified and re-usable human evaluation framework for VL-NLE."
