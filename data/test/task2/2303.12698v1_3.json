    "results analysis": "For a fair comparison with previous single-actor/single-action methods, we enhance them to work within the new multi-actor/multi-action paradigm.\nSpecifically, we calculate positive evidence by the function ReLU‚Äã(h‚Äã(ùê±;ùúΩ))+1ReLU‚Ñéùê±ùúΩ1\\text{ReLU}(h(\\mathbf{x};\\boldsymbol{\\theta}))+1 (same as described in Section¬†3.2), based on the last layer outputs h‚Äã(ùê±;ùúΩ)‚Ñéùê±ùúΩh(\\mathbf{x};\\boldsymbol{\\theta}).\nWe apply single-actor based DEAR¬† to a bounding volume around each detected actor for a multi-actor setting. According to Table¬†3, our method is compared with existing methods with both ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 backbones on AVA¬†[ref]14.\nThe baseline SlowFast¬†[ref]10 achieves a reasonable closed set mAP score but fails in open set recognition.\nOther state-of-the-art methods including ACAR¬†, AFAC¬†4, and AIA¬† obtain better accuracy in the closed set but are still unsatisfying to detect novel actions.\nCompared with DEAR¬† using ENNs, our method achieves much better performance in both closed set and open set metrics. This is because our network can handle the situation that each actor may contain more than one action.\nIn addition, simple bounding volume strategy is not effective to extract global information in the multi-actor setting.\nIt indicates the effectiveness of the proposed Beta-ENN for multi-label open set action recognition. Furthermore, we observe a similar trend on Charades¬†.\nFrom Table¬†4, our MULE achieves comparable closed set mAP and much better open set performance compared with the state-of-the-art.\nIt is worth mentioning that AFAC¬†4 and CSN¬† achieve the best closed set accuracy by using powerful CSN-152 backbone 5 and IG-65M pre-trained dataset. However, our method using ResNet backbone still obtains a considerable gain in terms of AUROC and FPR at 95% TPR.\nIt is a good fit for the situation that requires lower probability of misclassifying a novel instance as known. As shown in Figure¬†3, we provide several visual results on two datasets, where our method is compared with DEAR¬†, AFAC¬†4 and SlowFast¬†[ref]10.\nThe examples show that other methods output several false predictions of known and novel actions in a multi-actor/multi-action setting.\nIn contrast, our method can handle novelty detection in different situations more accurately."
