    "introduction": "The Travelling salesman problem (TSP) is prevalent in combinatorial optimisation. It requires searching a set of given nodes, which can represent cities or places, to find a route that passes through each node exactly once and has minimal route/tour length. It has numerous applications in telecommunications, circuit board design, DNA sequencing, transportation and in theoretical computer science . It is an NP-Hard problem, which means that there are instances for which finding an optimal solution is a time-taking process. Traditional approaches to tackle such hard optimisation problems employ two main strategies: exact algorithms , and heuristics . Exact algorithms are based around enumeration and can solve TSP optimally, e.g., branch-and-bound or integer programming formulations, but they generally cannot scale to larger instances . Since finding the optimal solutions might not be feasible for a large number of cities, heuristics employ problem-specific knowledge and carefully engineered approaches and parameters to find near-optimal solutions. Therefore, heuristics are effective algorithms which are often fast, but they may be tailored to a specific problem. Application of current search heuristics to new problems or extending to new instances of a similar problem is difficult and challenging. This challenge motivates the level of generalisation at which optimisation systems operate [ref]3, and that is the underlying motivation behind learning to optimise algorithms to solve optimisation problems. Although existing approaches can find reasonable TSP solutions, they need to be restarted for every instance, even where similar instances have been solved before. Instead, the knowledge generated from solving previous instances can be reused and utilised using learning to optimise mechanism, and this can assist in initialising solutions for heuristic and exact solvers for improved and more efficient solution searching. We next describe some related work in learning to optimise area and the open challenges associated with them. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have boosted performance in machine translation and image processing (). In a similar way, deep learning architecture can be trained to predict solutions to many combinatorial optimisation problems. This new field is called Learning to Optimise . Learning to Optimise approaches can be divided into supervised [ref]6 and reinforcement learning-based , , [ref]9, and have learnt to solve classic problems such as Travelling salesman [ref]6, Knapsack  and Vehicle Routing problems 0. In the supervised learning-based approaches, TSP instances and the corresponding ground truth solutions are used to train the DNN [ref]6. The reinforcement learning-based approach has been designed to solve combinatorial optimisation problems where policies are learnt to optimise tour length ,,[ref]9 and can be used as solvers. Although showing good initial promise, learning to optimise for COP suffers challenges. How to predict a solution for general TSP instances? For instance, TSP instances can be characterised by a) the space the points/cities are embedded in, e.g., Euclidean space and b) the difficulty of finding the optimal solution, which is partly related to how the points/cities are distributed within the space. We believe many of the existing approaches focus on training and testing on TSP instances that are embedded in Euclidean space. Also, they focus on generating training and testing instances that are uniformly distributed within a unit hypercube. This can lead to an inability to model, learn on and generalise to TSP instances that are embedded in non-Euclidean spaces and points (nodes) are not uniformly distributed. How to generate appropriate training data to be able to learn to solve different instances of TSP adequately? Though it is difficult to generate training data using various TSP instances, however, it is easy to generate Euclidean TSP instances/easy instances that we can use as training data to solve all types of TSP instances and easy to find optimal solutions (for small size (>50)absent50(>50)) of some Euclidean TSP instances using Concorde 1. Therefore, we consider generating Euclidean TSP instances as training data that are easy to generate and find a solution and predict solutions for any types of instances. The motivation of this paper is to present an approach that can able to solve general (various size and difficulty level) TSP instances, given the greater availability of Euclidean instances considering the above mention challenge. We next describe the various size and difficulty level of TSP instances that never analysed before in learning to optimise area in the next two paragraphs. Studies have been shown that the main property of measure the difficulty of TSP problem related to how the cities are distributed (and the distance space). In 2 studied all the TSP instances do not have the same difficulty level such as difficulty/distribution of points (easy, hard and so on) and in terms of size (instance size). We illustrate two examples of TSP instances, for example, hard (Berlin52) and easy(TSP50). In Fig. 1(a), Berlin52 is an example of a hard problem because of the tightly constrained points; it is hard to search solutions that made the problem hard. In Fig. 1(b), TSP50 is an example of an easy problem as the points are loosely constrained, so it is easy to search for solutions for these problems. Hardness generally relates to the distribution of the normalised areas and the distances between the cities. For example, the number of cities, represented as a dot(.) in Fig. 1], spread in the area covered by the cities of the given problem. This distribution of the cities represent how instances are embedded in the space, and how hard or easy an instance is to solve, as described in 3. In 3, they classified TSP instances according to their hardness such as easy, and hard to solve instances. In Fig. 1(c) and  1(d) is the solution for Fig. 1(a) and  1(b) where we illustrate that although instance size is nearly the same for two problems according to distributions of the problems, the solutions also alter on how the number of cities spread in the place. We define hardness indication details in Section 3.3. In this paper, motivation is not to measure the difficulty level of TSP instance, but, we are using the measure to show our model can learn all types of instances (hard and easy) studied in 3, which is verified in Section 5.3.1. Another types of TSP instances embedded non-uniform manner with various edge-weight types illustrates in Fig. 2. Edge is a property of new measure of the city to city nearness. Every TSP instances can be classified as their edge-weight types (weight means distances), such as Euclidean distance, Haversine distance111The edge weights represent the geographic distances (Haversine) between these locations, and TSP points are distributed on a sphere considering the curvature of the Earth., pseudo-Euclidean distance222Pseudo-Euclidean instances, which is Euclidean distance but breakdown of some properties of Euclidean space since the triangular inequality is not satisfied 4. In Fig. 2, we illustrate that every edge-weight type of TSP instance embedded differently in the space, which formulates in Section 3.2. These instances never analysed before in learning to optimise area. Previous work by the author has evaluated using Euclidean distance TSP instances, and it is anticipated that evaluate other distance types of TSP instances is preferred. Consequently, since we are considering learning general TSP instances so from the TSPLIB library 5, we observe various edge-weight types of instances to evaluate our model. We showed our model able to generalise on the different types of common TSP problems that we want one learning algorithm to generalise over, and that existing works have difficulty in generalising. Subsequently, we show the competitiveness of our approach. In real-world TSP applications, the instances consists of hundreds or thousands of nodes with various structures, and the optimal solution is not able to compute efficiently. We find that the proposed NETSP model generalises well from small-scale TSP problems to larger-scale problems and the various structure of distribution of the problems (cities) and generalisation capacity increases by order of magnitude. Cities may be distributed in a structured or unstructured way, which makes each TSP problem hard 6, 3. We present a new approach to solve the TSPs embedded in different spaces, and consider the distribution of points, also study different difficulty level of instances 3. Subsequently, different edge-weight types 7 of instances from the TSPLIB benchmark dataset 8 and classify them according to their edge-weight types and hardness. Moreover, we presented that we trained our model with smaller instances but can generalised larger instances. This paper introduces a deep learning approach using a combination of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) 9 and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) 0. CNN has been successfully shown to be able to handle different embedding spaces, and as we show in this paper, it is also able to handle TSPs in different spaces. Also, a CNN architecture can discover the inherent micro-patterns within smaller instances that transfer to larger instances and different spaces. In the field of combinatorial optimisation research, we have proposed the Non-Euclidean travelling salesman problem architecture (NETSP-Net) in Fig. 4, which aims to learn various TSP instance representations and capture important features (such as local spatial patterns among coordinates to learn about the pattern between two nodes). The objective of this work is not to outperform the current state-of-the-art TSP learning algorithm but to motivate the research in supervised learning to learn general TSP instances, considering the above difficulties. The main contributions of our work are as follows: We propose a new architecture, that we call NETSP-Net whose model is applied to non-trivial algorithmic problems involving geometry in various travelling salesman problems. Our NETSP-Net is applied to different distributions of TSP instances embedded in the Euclidean plane (hard to solve instances). We show that the learned model generalises to various distributions. We show that our method can generalise on various TSP instances embedded in various spaces. We show that our supervised model is efficient compared to reinforcement learning and can generalise to larger problems and perform consistently compared to other learning models."
