    "related work": "Problems related to Nash equilibrium with constraints have received considerable attention, and a number of results related to their complexity have been published.\nIn contrast to the unconstrained setting, such problems do not necessarily admit a solution. Gilboa and Zemel’s work on equilibrium with constraints such as having a guaranteed payoff or uniqueness shows that many of these problems are NP-complete ; alternate proofs are provided in    . In  and  it is shown that the hardness results also hold for symmetric games. Furthermore, the hardness can be extended to symmetric and win-lose games (that is, all utilities are 00 or 111) . There can potentially be a variety of constraints that can be considered and a wide range of these properties will lead to NP-hard problems. To our knowledge, our work is the first to consider the complexity of equilibria with conditions based on a mutual constraint on players’ strategies. Beyond questions of exact solutions in this setting, a limited amount of progress has been made in approximating Nash equilibrium with certain constraints unless they have a direct relationship to the social welfare of the players   4 . In fact, finding a PTAS for the (unconstrained) Nash equilibrium problem has been challenging with many attempts to address the question using different approaches     8. Finally, in a seminal work 2, it is shown that finding an approximate Nash equilibrium can have no better time complexity than a quasi-polynomial time algorithm introduced in  (assuming ETH.) Surprisingly, considering the application of constrained games defined by Debreu [ref]30 and Rosen  in Economics and other areas, the complexity of these problems has not received much attention until recent work , while to our knowledge, the complexity of constrained bi-matrix games has not been considered. Many researchers from different areas have worked on this notion which in turn explains why it has developed with a number of names in the literature including pseudo-games, social equilibrium, concave games, and common (coupled) constraint equilibrium    5 0. There are standard critiques on the notion of constrained equilibrium , in particular the question of how constraints are enforced. This question may be adequately addressed in a variety of settings, e.g., correlated equilibrium or games with a mediator, and so the notion remains fundamentally interesting. Furthermore, works on finding constrained equilibria focus on the case of convex constraints, where solutions are guaranteed to exist by well-known mathematical facts 6 [ref]30  . It is easy to observe that our problem obviously does not fall into this setting, however, a solution is guaranteed for one of the main problems. There are a variety of works done on constrained (i.e., social or generalized Nash) equilibrium where the focus is on only pure strategies     . A notable exception is constrained games introduced in  in which each player plays a mixture of two pure strategies from the set of admissible strategies."
