    "introduction": "Geometric packing problems have many important\napplications in cutting stock , VLSI\ndesign , logistics , smart-grids\n9, etc. Two-dimensional geometric knapsack (2GK),\na multidimensional generalization of the classical knapsack problem,\nis one of the central problems in this area. We are given a set of\nn𝑛n axis-aligned (open) rectangles (also called items) I:={1,2,…,n}assign𝐼12…𝑛I:=\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\},\nwhere rectangle i𝑖i has integral width 0​p​t​(i)0𝑝𝑡𝑖0pt(i), integral height 0​p​t​(i)0𝑝𝑡𝑖0pt(i) and an associated integral profit p​(i)𝑝𝑖p(i). We\nare also given an axis-aligned square knapsack K:=[0,N]×[0,N]assign𝐾0𝑁0𝑁K:=[0,N]\\times[0,N],\nwhere N∈ℕ𝑁ℕN\\in\\mathbb{N}. The goal is to select a subset of items I′⊆Isuperscript𝐼′𝐼I^{\\prime}\\subseteq I\nof maximum total profit p​(I′):=∑i∈I′p​(i)assign𝑝superscript𝐼′subscript𝑖superscript𝐼′𝑝𝑖p(I^{\\prime}):=\\sum_{i\\in I^{\\prime}}p(i) so\nthat they can be packed in the knapsack. The packing needs to be axis-parallel and non-overlapping, i.e., such packing maps\neach rectangle i∈I′𝑖superscript𝐼′i\\in I^{\\prime} to a new translated open rectangle R​(i):=(l​e​f​t​(i),r​i​g​h​t​(i))×(b​o​t​t​o​m​(i),t​o​p​(i))assign𝑅𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑜𝑝𝑖R(i):=(left(i),right(i))\\times(bottom(i),top(i))\nwhere r​i​g​h​t​(i)=l​e​f​t​(i)+0​p​t​(i)𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖0𝑝𝑡𝑖right(i)=left(i)+0pt(i), t​o​p​(i)=b​o​t​t​o​m​(i)+0​p​t​(i)𝑡𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑖0𝑝𝑡𝑖top(i)=bottom(i)+0pt(i),\nl​e​f​t​(i)≥0,b​o​t​t​o​m​(i)≥0formulae-sequence𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖0𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑖0left(i)\\geq 0,bottom(i)\\geq 0, r​i​g​h​t​(i)≤N,t​o​p​(i)≤Nformulae-sequence𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖𝑁𝑡𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑁right(i)\\leq N,top(i)\\leq N\nand for any i,j∈I′𝑖𝑗superscript𝐼′i,j\\in I^{\\prime}, we must have R​(i)∩R​(j)=∅𝑅𝑖𝑅𝑗R(i)\\cap R(j)=\\emptyset.\nIn 2GK, items are not allowed to be rotated. There is another variant\nwith rotations that we denote by 2GK(R), where items are allowed to be rotated by 909090\ndegrees. 2GK has rich connections with many important problems, such as\nmaximum independent set of rectangles (MISR) , 2-D bin packing\n, strip packing  7, storage\nallocation , unsplittable flow , mixed packing , fair resource allocation , etc.\nLeung et al.  showed that the problem is\nstrongly NP-hard. Jansen and Zhang  gave (2+ε)2𝜀(2+\\varepsilon)-approximation\nalgorithms for both 2GK and 2GK(R), where ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 is an arbitrarily small constant.\nFinally, Gálvez et al. 8\nbroke the barrier of 222 by giving a 1.891.891.89-approximation algorithm\nfor 2GK and (3/2+ε)32𝜀(3/2+\\varepsilon)-approximation algorithm for 2GK(R).\nFurthermore, if the input data is quasi-polynomially\nbounded (i.e., N≤n(log⁡n)c𝑁superscript𝑛superscript𝑛𝑐N\\leq n^{(\\log n)^{c}} for some c>0𝑐0c>0 ) then there exists a quasi-polynomial\ntime approximation scheme (QPTAS) for both problems . Polynomial\ntime approximation schemes (PTASs) are known for many special cases:\nif all items are small 4, if all items are squares\n8 5, if the profit of each item equals\nits area , and if we allow resource augmentation\n(i.e., the size of the knapsack can be slightly increased) 5 7.\nHowever, it is an open problem to construct a PTAS, even with pseudo-polynomial running time. One can view geometric packing as a cutting problem where we are given\na large sheet or stock unit (maybe metal, glass, wood, rubber, or\ncloth), which should be cut into pieces out of the given input set.\nCutting technology often only allows axis-parallel end-to-end\ncuts called guillotine cuts. See  \nfor practical applications and software related to guillotine packing.\nIn this setting, we seek for solutions in which we can cut out\nthe individual objects by a recursive sequence of guillotine cuts that\ndo not intersect any item of the solution.\nThe related notion of k𝑘k-stage packing was originally introduced\nby Gilmore and Gomory . Here each stage\nconsists of either vertical or horizontal guillotine cuts (but not\nboth). On each stage, each of the sub-regions obtained on the previous\nstage is considered separately and can be cut again by using horizontal\nor vertical guillotine cuts. In k𝑘k-stage packing, the number of\ncuts to obtain each rectangle from the initial packing is at most\nk𝑘k, plus an additional cut to trim (i.e., separate the rectangles\nitself from a waste area). Intuitively, this means that in the\ncutting process we change the orientation of the cuts k−1𝑘1k-1 times.\nThe case where k=2𝑘2k=2, usually referred to as shelf packing, has\nbeen studied extensively. [subfigure]justification=centering       \n{subfigure}[t].23 \n\n {subfigure}[t].23\n\n\n {subfigure}[t].2\n\n\n {subfigure}[t].23\n\n\n In this paper, we study the two-dimensional knapsack problem under\nguillotine cuts (2GGK). The input is the same as for 2GK,\nbut we require additionally that the items in the solution can be\nseparated by a sequence of guillotine cuts, and we say that then they\nare guillotine separable. NP-hardness of 2GGK follows from a reduction from the (one-dimensional) knapsack problem.\nChristofides et al.  studied the\nproblem in 1970s. Since then many heuristics have been developed to\nefficiently solve benchmark instances, based on tree-search ,\nbranch-and-bound 3, dynamic optimization\n, tabu search , genetic\nalgorithms [ref]47, etc. Despite a staggering number\nof recent experimental papers 2 4   1  6 ,\nthere was little theoretical progress for 2GGK, due to limitations\nof past techniques. Since 2004, the (3+ε)3𝜀(3+\\varepsilon)-approximation for\n2GK by Jansen and Zhang  has been the best-known\napproximation algorithm for 2GGK. Recently, Abed et al. \nhave studied approximation algorithms for the cardinality cases of 2GGK and 2GGK(R) and have given a QPTASs, assuming the input data to be quasi-polynomially\nbounded.\n Most algorithms for 2GK utilize a container packing (see\nSection 2) which arranges the items in the knapsack\nsuch that they are packed inside a constant number of axis-aligned\nboxes (containers). The best sizes and locations of these containers\ncan be guessed efficiently since there are only a constant number\nof them. Then inside each container the items are packed either\nin one-stage packings or in two-stage packings  (if items are small). However, Gálvez\net al. 8 show that one cannot obtain a better approximation\nratio than 222 with container-based\npackings with only O​(1)𝑂1O(1) many containers, due to interaction between horizontal (wide and thin)\nand vertical (tall and narrow) items. To break this barrier,\nthey use a corridor-decomposition where the knapsack is divided\ninto axis-parallel polygonal regions called corridors with\nconstant number of regions called subcorridors.\nVertical (resp. horizontal) items are packed in only vertical (resp.\nhorizontal) subcorridors. After simplifying the interaction between\nvertical and horizontal items, they define two types of packings.\nIn one packing, they process the subcorridors to obtain a\ncontainer-based packing. In the other, a profitable subset of long\nhorizontal and long vertical items are packed in an \\boldsymbol​𝖫\\boldsymbol𝖫\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{L}}-shaped\nregion. They prove that the best of these two packings achieves\na better approximation ratio than 222. However, it is not clear how\nto use this approach for 2GGK: even if we start with an optimal\nguillotine packing, the rearrangements of items may not preserve guillotine\nseparability, and hence they might not lead to a feasible solution\nto 2GGK."
