    "evaluation of crbnet": "We use PyTorch library to train 100 epochs. Input of CRBNet is a patch with size of 32 √ó\\times 32 pixels. The batch size is 1024 and the optimization is done by Adam optimizer  with Œ±ùõº\\alpha = 0.01, Œ≤1subscriptùõΩ1\\beta_{1} = 0.9 and Œ≤2subscriptùõΩ2\\beta_{2} = 0.999. Similar to the previous work , a dropout layer with 0.1 dropout rate is employed before the last convolutional layer and 8 nearest neighboring pairs are selected for a given pair to calculate ‚Ñõs‚Äão‚Äãssubscript‚Ñõùë†ùëúùë†\\mathcal{R}_{sos}. UBC Phototour dataset  is one of the most popular datasets for local descriptor learning. It contains three subsets: Liberty, Notre Dame, and Yosemite.\nWe follow the standard evaluation protocol of  and train our models on one subset and test on the other two. Then we report the false positive rate at 95% recall in the 100K pairs provided by . For the real-valued descriptors, we compare our descriptor with the state-of-art descriptors, including TFeat [ref]24, L2Net , HardNet [ref]25, DOAP [ref]29, SOSNet , on UBC Phototour dataset . For the binary part, we compare binary CRBNet with BinBoost , binary L2Net , DOAP [ref]29, SOSNet . As SOSNet is a real-valued descriptor, we use ITQ  to create binary parts. ITQ uses an iterative approach to minimize the binarization error when mapping real-valued descriptors to binary descriptors and we refer the readers to  for the details. We use the network of L2Net to produce 128-D outputs while 256-D outputs are based on the network described on Section 3.1. CRBNet(N) means the weighted Hamming distance regularization is not used. Comparison results are shown in Table 1, where the results of SIFT provided by  are regarded as a baseline. For the binary part, we can see the binary descriptors of 256-D are better than the ones of 128-D. That is to say that increasing output dimension can improve performance of the binary descriptor. No matter the output is 128-D or 256-D, our binary descriptors get the best results compared with the same dimension methods. We also implement an ablation study, i.e., we remove the weighted Hamming distance from CRBNet, and then get CRBNet(N), its results are also listed in Table 1. Compared with CRBNet(N), the performance of CRBNet gets a significant boost with the help of weighted Hamming network. Last but not least, our method achieves the best performance in binary form meanwhile still keeps excellent performance in real-valued form for most cases. In order to further evaluate our weighted Hamming loss and network, we also evaluate the binary CRBNet on HPatches dataset .\nThis dataset contains 116 sequences and every sequence consists of 6 images. 69 of these sequences have great variations in viewpoint while the others have great changes in illumination. Keypoints in HPatches are detected by DoG, Harris and Hessian detectors. In each of the sequences, according to level of geometric noise, matching patches are divided into three groups: Easy, Hard, and Tough. HPatches dataset also defines three evaluation tasks: patch verification, image matching, and patch retrieval. In this benchmark, we compare the binary part with ORB, BinBoost , SIFT  and SOSNet+ITQ. Because we don‚Äôt find the pretrained model of DOAP and CS L2Net, so we cannot compare binary CRBNet with them in HPatches. The results of three tasks are shown in Fig. 5. As we can see, for 128-D, our CRBNet is better than SOSNet+ITQ; For 256-D, CRBNet with weighted Hamming distance regularization is better than the one without weighted Hamming distance regularization, which indicates that the weighted Hamming distance regularization is effective when learning binary descriptors."
