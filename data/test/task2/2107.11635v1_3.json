    "contrastive learning": "Despite many recent successes in learning representations, the idea\nof contrastive learning appeared long time ago. In 2006, Hadsell et.\nal. 5 proposed a max-margin contrastive\nloss and linked it to a mechanical spring system. In fact, from a\nprobabilistic view, contrastive learning arises naturally when working\nwith energy-based models. For example, in many problems, we want to\nmaximize log‚Å°p‚Äã(y|x)=log‚Å°ef(y,x))‚àëy‚Ä≤‚ààùí¥ef‚Äã(y‚Ä≤,x)\\log p(y|x)=\\log\\frac{e^{f(y,x))}}{\\sum_{y^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{Y}}e^{f(y^{\\prime},x)}}\nwhere yùë¶y is the output associated with a context xùë•x and ùí¥ùí¥\\mathcal{Y}\nis the set of all possible outputs or vocab. This is roughly equivalent\nto maximizing f‚Äã(y,x)ùëìùë¶ùë•f(y,x) and minimizing f‚Äã(y‚Ä≤,x)ùëìsuperscriptùë¶‚Ä≤ùë•f(y^{\\prime},x) for all y‚Ä≤‚â†ysuperscriptùë¶‚Ä≤ùë¶y^{\\prime}\\neq y\nbut in a normalized setting. However, in practice, the size of ùí¥ùí¥\\mathcal{Y}\nis usually very large, making the computation of p‚Äã(y|x)ùëùconditionalùë¶ùë•p(y|x) expensive.\nThis problem was addressed in [ref]32 2\nby using Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) \nto approximate p‚Äã(y|x)ùëùconditionalùë¶ùë•p(y|x). The basic idea of NCE is to transform the\ndensity estimation problem into a binary classification problem: ‚ÄúWhether\nsamples are drawn from the data distribution or from a known noise\ndistribution?‚Äù. Based on NCE, Mikolov et. al. \nand Oord et. al.  derived a simpler\ncontrastive loss which later was referred to as the InfoNCE loss \nand was adopted by many subsequent works      \nfor learning representations. Recently, there have been several attempts to leverage inter-sample\nstatistics obtained from clustering to improve representation learning\non a large scale   .\nPCL  alternates between clustering data\nvia K-means and contrasting samples based on their views and their\nassigned cluster centroids (or prototypes). SwAV \ndoes not contrast two sample views directly but uses one view to predict\nthe code of assigning the other view to a set of learnable prototypes.\nInterCLR 4 and ODC 1 avoid\noffline clustering on the entire training dataset after each epoch\nby storing a pseudo-label for every sample in the memory bank (along\nwith the feature vector) and maintaining a set of cluster centroids.\nThese pseudo-labels and cluster centroids are updated on-the-fly at\neach step via mini-batch K-means."
