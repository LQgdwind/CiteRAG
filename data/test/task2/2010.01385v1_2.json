    "preliminaries": "In this section, we present necessary definitions and notations. For more details, reader is referred to excellent surveys by Shpilka and Yehudayoff  and by Saptharishi et al. . Let X={x1,…,xn}𝑋subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛X=\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\} be a set of variables.\nAn arithmetic circuit C𝐶C over a field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} with input X𝑋X is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the nodes have in-degree zero or two. The nodes of in-degree zero are called input gates and are labeled by elements from X∪𝔽𝑋𝔽X\\cup\\mathbb{F}. Non-input gates of C𝐶C are called internal gates and are labeled from {+,t​i​m​e​s}𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠\\{+,times\\}. Nodes of out degree zero are called output gates. Typically, a circuit has a single output gate. Every gate v𝑣v in C𝐶C naturally computes a polynomial fv∈𝔽​[X]subscript𝑓𝑣𝔽delimited-[]𝑋f_{v}\\in\\mathbb{F}[X]. The polynomial computed by C𝐶C is the polynomial represented at its output gate.\nThe size of a circuit denoted by size​(C)size𝐶\\text{size}(C), is the number of gates in it, and depth is the length of the longest root to leaf path in C𝐶C, denoted by depth​(C)depth𝐶\\text{depth}(C). An arithmetic formula is a circuit where the underlying undirected graph is a tree. For a gate v𝑣v in C𝐶C, let 𝗏𝖺𝗋​(v)𝗏𝖺𝗋𝑣{\\sf var}(v) denote the set of all variables that appear as leaf labels in the sub-circuit rooted at v𝑣v. Multilinear polynomials are polynomials such that in every monomial, the degree of a variable is either 00 or 111. Multilinear circuits, where every gate in the circuit computes a multilinear polynomial, are natural models of computation for multilinear polynomials. A circuit C𝐶C is said to be syntactic multilinear if for every product gate v=v1×v2𝑣subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2v=v_{1}\\times v_{2} in C𝐶C, we have 𝗏𝖺𝗋​(v1)∩𝗏𝖺𝗋​(v2)=∅𝗏𝖺𝗋subscript𝑣1𝗏𝖺𝗋subscript𝑣2{\\sf var}(v_{1})\\cap{\\sf var}(v_{2})=\\emptyset. By definition, a syntactic multilinear circuit is also multilinear and computes a multilinear polynomial. An arithmetic formula F𝐹F is said to be a read-once formula (ROF in short) if every input variable in X𝑋X labels at most one input gate in F𝐹F. Algebraic branching program (ABP in short) is a model of computation of polynomials defined as analogous to the branching program model of computation for Boolean functions. An ABP P𝑃P is a layered DAG with layers L0,…,Lmsubscript𝐿0…subscript𝐿𝑚L_{0},\\ldots,L_{m} such L0={s}subscript𝐿0𝑠L_{0}=\\{s\\} and Lm={t}subscript𝐿𝑚𝑡L_{m}=\\{t\\} where s𝑠s is the start node and t𝑡t is the terminal node.\nEach edge is labeled by an element in X∪𝔽𝑋𝔽X\\cup\\mathbb{F}. The output of the ABP P𝑃P is the polynomial p=∑ρ​is a s to t path𝗐𝗍​(ρ)𝑝subscript𝜌is a s to t path𝗐𝗍𝜌p=\\sum_{\\rho\\text{is a $s$ to $t$ path}}{\\sf wt}(\\rho), where 𝗐𝗍​(ρ)𝗐𝗍𝜌{\\sf wt}(\\rho) is the product of edge labels in the path ρ𝜌\\rho. Further, for any two nodes u𝑢u and v𝑣v let [u,v]Psubscript𝑢𝑣𝑃[u,v]_{P} denote the polynomial computed by the subprogram Pu​vsubscript𝑃𝑢𝑣P_{uv} of P𝑃P with u𝑢u as the start node and v𝑣v as the terminal node. Let Xu​vsubscript𝑋𝑢𝑣X_{uv} denote the set of variables that appear as edge labels in the subprogram Pu​vsubscript𝑃𝑢𝑣P_{uv}. The size of an ABP P𝑃P, denoted by size​(P)size𝑃\\text{size}(P) is the number of nodes in P𝑃P. In a syntactic multilinear ABP (smABP), every s𝑠s to t𝑡t path reads any input variables at most once. An ABP is oblivious if every layer reads at most one variable. A read-once oblivious ABP (ROABP) is an oblivious syntactic multilinear ABP where every variable can appear in at most one variable i.e., for every i𝑖i, there is at most one layer jisubscript𝑗𝑖j_{i} such that xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} occurs as a label on the edges from Ljisubscript𝐿subscript𝑗𝑖L_{j_{i}} to Lji+1subscript𝐿subscript𝑗𝑖1L_{j_{i}+1}. An interval on the set {1,…,n}1…𝑛\\{1,\\ldots,n\\} with end-points i,j∈[n]𝑖𝑗delimited-[]𝑛i,j\\in[n], can be defined as I=[i,j],i<jformulae-sequence𝐼𝑖𝑗𝑖𝑗I=[i,j],\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ i<j, where I={ℓ∣i,j∈[n],i≤ℓ≤j}𝐼conditional-setℓformulae-sequence𝑖𝑗delimited-[]𝑛𝑖ℓ𝑗I=\\{\\ell\\mid i,j\\in[n],i\\leq\\ell\\leq j\\}. An interval of variables Xi​jsubscript𝑋𝑖𝑗X_{ij} is defined such that Xi​j⊆{xℓ∣ℓ∈I,I=[i,j]}subscript𝑋𝑖𝑗conditional-setsubscript𝑥ℓformulae-sequenceℓ𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑗X_{ij}\\subseteq\\{x_{\\ell}\\mid\\ell\\in I,\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ I=[i,j]\\}, where I𝐼I is an interval on the set {1,…,n}1…𝑛\\{1,\\dots,n\\}. For an ordering π∈Sn𝜋subscript𝑆𝑛\\pi\\in S_{n}, we define a π𝜋\\pi-interval of variables, Xi​j⊆{xπ​(i),xπ​(i+1),…,xπ​(j)}subscript𝑋𝑖𝑗subscript𝑥𝜋𝑖subscript𝑥𝜋𝑖1…subscript𝑥𝜋𝑗X_{ij}\\subseteq\\{x_{\\pi(i)},x_{\\pi(i+1)},\\ldots,x_{\\pi(j)}\\}.\nIn [ref]4, Arvind and Raja defined a sub-class of syntactically multilinear ABPs known as interval ABPs and proved lower bounds against the same. Later,  defined a further restricted version of interval ABPs, denoted by strict-interval ABPs, defined as follows. ()\nA strict interval ABP P𝑃P is a syntactically multilinear ABP where we have the following: For any pair of nodes u𝑢u and v𝑣v in P𝑃P, the indices of variables occurring in the sub-program [u,v]Psubscript𝑢𝑣𝑃[u,v]_{P} is contained in some π𝜋\\pi-interval Iu​vsubscript𝐼𝑢𝑣I_{uv} called the associated interval of [u,v]Psubscript𝑢𝑣𝑃[u,v]_{P}; and for any pairs of sub-programs of the form [u,v]P,[v,w]Psubscript𝑢𝑣𝑃subscript𝑣𝑤𝑃[u,v]_{P},\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ [v,w]_{P}, the associatedπ𝜋\\pi-intervals of variables are disjoint,\ni.e., Iu​v∩Iv​w=∅subscript𝐼𝑢𝑣subscript𝐼𝑣𝑤I_{uv}\\cap I_{vw}=\\emptyset. It may be noted that in a strict interval ABP, intervals associated with each sub-program need not be unique. We assume that the intervals associated are largest intervals with respect to set inclusion such that condition 2 in the definition above is satisfied. We need the notion of partial derivative matrices introduced by Raz  and Nisan [ref]26 as primary measure of complexity for multilinear polynomials. The partial derivative matrix of a polynomial f∈𝕏𝑓𝕏f\\in\\mathbb{X} defined based on a partition φ:X→Y∪Z:𝜑→𝑋𝑌𝑍\\varphi:X\\to Y\\cup Z of the X𝑋X into two parts. We follow the definition in : (Raz ) Let φ:X→Y∪Z:𝜑→𝑋𝑌𝑍\\varphi:X\\to Y\\cup Z be a partition of the input variables in two parts. Let ℳYsubscriptℳ𝑌\\mathcal{M}_{Y}, ℳZsubscriptℳ𝑍\\mathcal{M}_{Z} be the sets of all possible multilinear monomials in the variables in Y𝑌Y and Z𝑍Z respectively. Then we construct the partial derivative matrix Mfφsubscript𝑀superscript𝑓𝜑M_{f^{\\varphi}} for a multilinear polynomial f𝑓f under the partition φ𝜑\\varphi such that the rows of the matrix are indexed by monomials mi∈ℳYsubscript𝑚𝑖subscriptℳ𝑌m_{i}\\in\\mathcal{M}_{Y}, the columns by monomials sj∈ℳZsubscript𝑠𝑗subscriptℳ𝑍s_{j}\\in\\mathcal{M}_{Z} and entry Mfφ​(i,j)=ci​jsubscript𝑀superscript𝑓𝜑𝑖𝑗subscript𝑐𝑖𝑗M_{f^{\\varphi}}(i,j)=c_{ij}, ci​jsubscript𝑐𝑖𝑗c_{ij} being the coefficient of the monomial mi⋅sj⋅subscript𝑚𝑖subscript𝑠𝑗m_{i}\\cdot s_{j} in f𝑓f. We denote by 𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗄φ​(f)subscript𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗄𝜑𝑓{\\sf rank}_{\\varphi}(f) the rank of the matrix Mfφsubscript𝑀superscript𝑓𝜑M_{f^{\\varphi}}. We call φ𝜑\\varphi an equi-partition when |X|=n𝑋𝑛|X|=n, n𝑛n even and |Y|=|Z|=n/2𝑌𝑍𝑛2|Y|=|Z|=n/2. Raz  showed the following fundamental property of 𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗄φsubscript𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗄𝜑{\\sf rank}_{\\varphi}: Let g𝑔g and hℎh be multilinear polynomials in 𝔽​[X]𝔽delimited-[]𝑋\\mathbb{F}[X]. Then, ∀φ:X→Y∪Z:for-all𝜑→𝑋𝑌𝑍\\forall\\varphi:X\\to Y\\cup Z, we have the following. 𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗄φ​(g+h)≤𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗄φ​(g)+𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗄φ​(h)subscript𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗄𝜑𝑔ℎsubscript𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗄𝜑𝑔subscript𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗄𝜑ℎ{\\sf rank}_{\\varphi}(g+h)\\leq{\\sf rank}_{\\varphi}(g)+{\\sf rank}_{\\varphi}(h), and 𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗄φ​(g​h)≤𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗄φ​(g)×𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗄φ​(h)subscript𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗄𝜑𝑔ℎsubscript𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗄𝜑𝑔subscript𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗄𝜑ℎ{\\sf rank}_{\\varphi}(gh)\\leq{\\sf rank}_{\\varphi}(g)\\times{\\sf rank}_{\\varphi}(h), In both the cases, equality holds when 𝗏𝖺𝗋​(g)∩𝗏𝖺𝗋​(h)=∅𝗏𝖺𝗋𝑔𝗏𝖺𝗋ℎ{\\sf var}(g)\\cap{\\sf var}(h)=\\emptyset. Polynomials that exhibit maximum rank ofthe partial derivative matrix under all or a large fraction of equi-partitions can be thought of as high complexity or hard polynomials. We need two such families found in the literature. Raz and Yehudayoff  defined a multilinear in \\VP\\VP\\VP. To define this polynomial we denote an interval {a∣i≤a≤j,a∈ℕ},i,j∈ℕconditional-set𝑎formulae-sequence𝑖𝑎𝑗𝑎ℕ𝑖𝑗ℕ\\{a\\mid i\\leq a\\leq j,a\\in\\mathbb{N}\\},\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ i,j\\in\\mathbb{N} by [i,j]𝑖𝑗[i,j], and consider the sets of variables X={x1,…,x2​n}𝑋subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥2𝑛X=\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{2n}\\}, W={wi,ℓ,j}i,ℓ,j∈[2​n]𝑊subscriptsubscript𝑤𝑖ℓ𝑗𝑖ℓ𝑗delimited-[]2𝑛W=\\{w_{i,\\ell,j}\\}_{i,\\ell,j\\in[2n]}. We denote it as the Raz-Yehudayoff polynomial and define it as follows. Let us consider fi​j∈𝔽​[X,W]subscript𝑓𝑖𝑗𝔽𝑋𝑊f_{ij}\\in\\mathbb{F}[X,W] defined over the interval [i,j]𝑖𝑗[i,j].\nFor i≤j𝑖𝑗i\\leq j, the polynomial fi​jsubscript𝑓𝑖𝑗f_{ij} is defined inductively as follows.\nIf j−i=0𝑗𝑖0j-i=0, then fi​j=0subscript𝑓𝑖𝑗0f_{ij}=0. For |j−i|>0𝑗𝑖0|j-i|>0, where we assume without loss of generality, lengths of [i,ℓ],[ℓ+1,j]𝑖ℓℓ1𝑗[i,\\ell],\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ [\\ell+1,j] are even and smaller than [i,j]𝑖𝑗[i,j]. We define f1,2​nsubscript𝑓12𝑛f_{1,2n} as the Raz-Yehudayoff polynomial f𝖱𝖸subscript𝑓𝖱𝖸f_{{\\sf RY}}. Note that, f𝖱𝖸subscript𝑓𝖱𝖸f_{\\sf RY} can be defined over any subset X′⊆Xsuperscript𝑋′𝑋X^{\\prime}\\subseteq X such that |X′|superscript𝑋′|X^{\\prime}| is even, by considering the induced ordering of variables in X′superscript𝑋′X^{\\prime} and considering intervals accordingly. We denote this polynomial as f𝖱𝖸​(X′)subscript𝑓𝖱𝖸superscript𝑋′f_{\\sf RY}(X^{\\prime}) for X′⊆Xsuperscript𝑋′𝑋X^{\\prime}\\subseteq X.\nRaz and Yehudayoff showed:  ()\nLet 𝔾=𝔽​(W)𝔾𝔽𝑊\\mathbb{G}=\\mathbb{F}(W) be the field of rational functions over the field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} and the set of variables W𝑊W. Then for every equi-partition φ:X→Y∪Z:𝜑→𝑋𝑌𝑍\\varphi:X\\to Y\\cup Z, 𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗄φ​(f𝖱𝖸)=2n/2subscript𝗋𝖺𝗇𝗄𝜑subscript𝑓𝖱𝖸superscript2𝑛2{\\sf rank}_{\\varphi}(f_{{\\sf RY}})=2^{n/2}. Dvir et al.  defined a polynomial that is hard i.e., full rank with respect to a special class of partitions called arc-partitions. Suppose X={x0,…,xn−1}𝑋subscript𝑥0…subscript𝑥𝑛1X=\\{x_{0},\\ldots,x_{n-1}\\} be identified with the set V={0,…,n−1}𝑉0…𝑛1V=\\{0,\\ldots,n-1\\}. For i,j∈V𝑖𝑗𝑉i,j\\in V, the set [i,j]={i,(i+1)modn,(i+2)modn,…,j}𝑖𝑗𝑖modulo𝑖1𝑛modulo𝑖2𝑛…𝑗[i,j]=\\{i,(i+1)\\mod n,(i+2)\\mod n,\\ldots,j\\} is called the arc from i𝑖i to j𝑗j.\nAn arc pairing is a distribution on the set of all pairings (i.e., perfect matchings) on V𝑉V obtained in n/2𝑛2n/2 steps as follows.\nAssuming a pairing (P1,…,Pt)subscript𝑃1…subscript𝑃𝑡(P_{1},\\ldots,P_{t}) constructed in t<n/2𝑡𝑛2t<n/2 steps, where P1=(0,1)subscript𝑃101P_{1}=(0,1), [Lt,Rt]subscript𝐿𝑡subscript𝑅𝑡[L_{t},R_{t}] is the interval spanned by ∪i∈[t]Pisubscript𝑖delimited-[]𝑡subscript𝑃𝑖\\cup_{i\\in[t]}P_{i} and the random pair Pt+1subscript𝑃𝑡1P_{t+1} is constructed such that and therefore, [Lt+1,Rt+1]=[Lt,Rt]∪Pt+1subscript𝐿𝑡1subscript𝑅𝑡1subscript𝐿𝑡subscript𝑅𝑡subscript𝑃𝑡1[L_{t+1},R_{t+1}]=[L_{t},R_{t}]\\cup P_{t+1}. Given a pairing 𝒫={P1,…,Pn/2}𝒫subscript𝑃1…subscript𝑃𝑛2{\\cal P}=\\{P_{1},\\ldots,P_{n/2}\\} of V𝑉V, there are exactly 2n/2superscript2𝑛22^{n/2} partitions of X𝑋X, by assigning φ​(xi)∈Y𝜑subscript𝑥𝑖𝑌\\varphi(x_{i})\\in Y and φ​(xj)∈Z𝜑subscript𝑥𝑗𝑍\\varphi(x_{j})\\in Z or φ​(xi)∈Z𝜑subscript𝑥𝑖𝑍\\varphi(x_{i})\\in Z and φ​(xj)∈Y𝜑subscript𝑥𝑗𝑌\\varphi(x_{j})\\in Y independently for each pair (i,j)∈𝒫𝑖𝑗𝒫(i,j)\\in{\\cal P}. An arc partition is a distribution on all partitions obtained by sampling an arc pairing as defined above and sampling a partition corresponding to the pairing uniformly at random. We denote this distribution on partitions by 𝒟𝒟{\\mathcal{D}}. For a pairing 𝒫={P1,…,Pn/2}𝒫subscript𝑃1…subscript𝑃𝑛2{\\cal P}=\\{P_{1},\\ldots,P_{n/2}\\} let M𝒫subscript𝑀𝒫M_{{\\cal P}} be the degree n/2𝑛2n/2 polynomial ∏i=1n/2(xℓi+xri)superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑖1𝑛2subscript𝑥subscriptℓ𝑖subscript𝑥subscript𝑟𝑖\\prod_{i=1}^{n/2}(x_{\\ell_{i}}+x_{r_{i}}) where Pi=(ℓi,ri)subscript𝑃𝑖subscriptℓ𝑖subscript𝑟𝑖P_{i}=(\\ell_{i},r_{i}). Dvir et al.  defined the arc full rank polynomial f^=∑𝒫∈𝒟λ𝒫​M𝒫^𝑓subscript𝒫𝒟subscript𝜆𝒫subscript𝑀𝒫\\widehat{f}=\\sum_{{\\cal P}\\in{\\cal D}}\\lambda_{{\\cal P}}M_{{\\cal P}}, where λ𝒫subscript𝜆𝒫\\lambda_{\\cal P} is a formal variable.

Now that we are familiar with most of the definitions required for an understanding of the results in this paper, we proceed to discuss our results."
