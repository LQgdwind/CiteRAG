    "formulation of the preconditioned rectangular central moment lbe": "For this purpose, we will utilize the independently supported bare central moments defined in Eq. (10) for the D2Q9 lattice and collect them in the form of the following vectors: Now, the raw moments defined in Eq. (9) can be related to the central moments in Eq. (10) via straightforward binomial expansions involving the former in combinations with monomials of the fluid velocity components at different order (of the form uxp​uyqsuperscriptsubscript𝑢𝑥𝑝superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑦𝑞u_{x}^{p}u_{y}^{q}). Thus, the mappings from the raw moments to central moments (and vice versa) can be formally expressed as where 𝗙𝗙\\bm{\\mathsf{F}} is referred to as the frame transformation matrix reflecting the binomial transforms of moments at different orders supported by the D2Q9 lattice. Such a formulation to represent the transformations between the raw moments and central moments for the complete set supported by the lattice in the form of a shift matrix was first introduced by Fei and Luo in  . It is given by Also, as noted in Ref. [ref]34, its inverse 𝗙−1superscript𝗙1{\\bm{\\mathsf{F}}}^{-1} can be read off directly from the elements of 𝗙=𝗙​(ux,uy)𝗙𝗙subscript𝑢𝑥subscript𝑢𝑦{\\bm{\\mathsf{F}}}={\\bm{\\mathsf{F}}}(u_{x},u_{y}) with minor changes by exploiting the following property that exists for such transforms: 𝗙−1=𝗙​(−ux,−uy)superscript𝗙1𝗙subscript𝑢𝑥subscript𝑢𝑦{\\bm{\\mathsf{F}}}^{-1}={\\bm{\\mathsf{F}}}(-u_{x},-u_{y}). Thus, and thus naturally both of them are lower triangular matrices. Then, by an analogy with Eq. (60), we can write the following preconditioned rectangular central moment LBE by involving relaxations of central moments 𝐦csuperscript𝐦𝑐\\mathbf{m}^{c} under collision (rather than raw moments 𝐦𝐦\\mathbf{m}) and including the additional transforms between them and the raw moments (via 𝗙𝗙\\bm{\\mathsf{F}} and 𝗙−1superscript𝗙1\\bm{\\mathsf{F}}^{-1}) : It may be noted that this Eq. (65) has some similarities with those presented by Luo and collaborators  , where they presented the cascaded central moment LB method in a generalized MRT framework on a square lattice. Our notations follow from those presented in an earlier work of the second author  for the frame transformation matrix 𝗙𝗙\\bm{\\mathsf{F}}. This matrix as shown in Eq. (64) is identical to the shift matrix used in  . Nevertheless, there are some key differences: Eq. (65) also involves the forward and inverse scaling transformations (via diagonal matrices) related to the grid aspect ratio r𝑟r to accommodate the use of a rectangular lattice in a modular fashion. Moreover, for the collision step, Refs.   combine the relaxation parameters of the second order moments similar to that in . By contrast, here, to execute the collision step, the second order moments are combined prior to collision, which are then relaxed at independent rates to their equilibria (with appropriate corrections based on r𝑟r and γ𝛾\\gamma) and then segregated post collision. Such a strategy for performing collision was presented by Geier et al. , and present work can be considered as an extension of such an approach for performing flow simulations on rectangular lattices with preconditioning. Also, it should be noted that not all collision models admit interpretations based on matrices. For example, the highly sophisticated and nonlinear cumulant LB scheme cannot be represented in the form of matrices. Hence, the algorithms (including the special cases for raw moments and central moments) presented in  are given only as series of substeps and no matrices are utilized in this regard. Thus, to maintain generality of our approach, in what follows, we will represent our PRC-LBM in the form of a sequence of operations that conveys the essence of Eq. (65). This last equation (Eq. (65)) can then be more conveniently split up into various sub-steps, which then results into the following preconditioned rectangular central moment LBM or PRC-LBM: This PRC-LBM is a numerically more robust formulation than its raw moment counterpart given earlier in Eq. (61). The algorithmic details of the PRC-LBM to facilitate its implementation are discussed in A."
