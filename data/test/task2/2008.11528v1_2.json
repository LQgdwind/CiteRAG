    "beams": "In line with the assumptions for the Euler-Bernoulli beam displacement theory, the aspect ratio of the beam was chosen to be L/h=100𝐿ℎ100L/h=100 for the current study. The width of the beam was chosen as 2×h2ℎ2\\times h. The critical loads reported here were non-dimensionalized as follows: Before presenting the results for the critical loads, we make an important remark on the convergence of the f-FEM. As discussed in , convergence of the 1D f-FEM depends on the ’dynamic rate of convergence’. This parameter, which controls the accuracy of the numerical approximation of the convolution integral corresponding to the nonlocal interactions, is defined as 𝒩i​n​f=lf/lesuperscript𝒩𝑖𝑛𝑓subscript𝑙𝑓subscript𝑙𝑒\\mathcal{N}^{inf}=l_{f}/l_{e}, where lesubscript𝑙𝑒l_{e} is the size of the uniform FE mesh. The convergence of the f-FEM used in this study is analysed for a clamped-clamped case for different values of the fractional-order parameters and the results are reported in Table 1. The study illustrates the excellent convergence of the normalized eigenvalues that achieve differences of <<1% between successive refinements of the FE mesh. Following these results, we used Ni​n​f=24superscript𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑓24N^{inf}=24 for all the simulations presented in this section. The critical loads of fractional-order beams subject to doubly clamped (CC) and simply supported (SS) boundary conditions at x1=0,Lsubscript𝑥10𝐿x_{1}=0,L are tabulated in Table 2 for various fractional-order parameters (α𝛼\\alpha and lfsubscript𝑙𝑓l_{f}). A non-monotonic variation of the critical load with increasing degree of nonlocality, obtained by reducing α𝛼\\alpha and/or increasing lfsubscript𝑙𝑓l_{f}, is clearly evident from the table. This observation is unlike the monotonous reduction in critical load noted from similar studies based on classical integer-order nonlocal theories   . This difference is a direct result of the effect of the nonlocal response on the geometric stiffness. This aspect is discussed in further detail in the following. As discussed in §3, contrary to the classical approaches to nonlocal elasticity, adopting the fractional-order kinematic approach to determine the critical load of a nonlocal solid affects both the material and geometric stiffness terms. With the increasing degree of nonlocality, both these stiffness terms are reduced. The decrease in material stiffness (often referred to as softening effect) as a result of the fractional-order kinematics was already documented in [ref]31 , and is in agreement with similar observations from classical strain-driven integral approaches to nonlocal elasticity. The reduction of the geometric stiffness due to fractional-order kinematics was not reported in either the fractional- or integer-order studies. We merely note that, with regards to the fractional-order studies [ref]31  [ref]32 , the effect of the nonlocality on the geometric stiffness was not reported simply because of the nature of the problems (static and free vibration response) treated in the same studies. Recall however that, the constitutive modeling of the slender structures in this study and the other fractional-order studies in [ref]31  [ref]32  is still the same. In this regard, as evident from Eq. (13), the reducing material stiffness (numerator) would result in decreasing the critical load, and the reducing geometric stiffness (denominator) would result in increasing critical load. It follows that the effect of an increasing degree of nonlocality on the critical load is non-monotonic due to an interplay between these contrasting effects, resulting from a simultaneous decrease in the material and geometric stiffness. To better illustrate the above aspects, we present a numerical study that isolates the effects of nonlocal interactions, modeled by the fractional-derivatives, on the material and geometric stiffness of the nonlocal solid. In an attempt to isolate the effects of the nonlocality produced by the fractional-order kinematics on both stiffness terms, we artificially replace the fractional-derivatives present in their definitions with integer-order derivatives. This process is carried out individually for either the material or the geometric stiffness matrices. For this purpose, the different stiffness matrices in the algebraic equations of the eigenvalue problem developed in Eq. (24) are modified for the two different parametric studies in the following manner: Note that [B~□]delimited-[]subscript~𝐵□[\\tilde{B}_{\\square}] are the nonlocal strain-displacement matrices employing fractional-order derivatives, and the matrices [B□]delimited-[]subscript𝐵□[{B}_{\\square}] are their local elastic analogue evaluated using integer-order derivatives as shown in . It is clear that the stiffness terms evaluated using integer-order matrices corresponds to local elasticity. For the case of isolated material nonlocality with geometric stiffness terms being local, the softening effect introduced in [Kb]delimited-[]superscript𝐾𝑏[K^{b}] by the fractional-order derivatives is expected to lead to lower values of critical load. In contrast, for the case of isolated geometric nonlocality with material stiffness terms being local, increasing the nonlocal effects would reduce the geometric stiffness, hence it will increase the critical load. These observations simply follow from the Rayleigh-Ritz expression in Eq. (13). In obtaining the above results we assumed a constant length scale throughout: lA=lB=lfsubscript𝑙𝐴subscript𝑙𝐵subscript𝑙𝑓l_{A}=l_{B}=l_{f}. The results for the above mentioned parametric studies, conducted for different boundary conditions, are presented in Tables 3 and 4. For isolated material nonlocality ([Kb]delimited-[]superscript𝐾𝑏[K^{b}]: Nonlocal & [Gb]delimited-[]superscript𝐺𝑏[G^{b}]: Local), the critical load decreases monotonically as the degree of nonlocality increases (which is achieved either by decreasing α𝛼\\alpha or by increasing lfsubscript𝑙𝑓l_{f}), irrespective of the boundary conditions. Similarly, for isolated geometric nonlocality ([Kb]delimited-[]superscript𝐾𝑏[K^{b}]: Local & [Gb]delimited-[]superscript𝐺𝑏[G^{b}]: Nonlocal), the critical load increases with an increasing degree of nonlocality. It immediately follows that, when nonlocality is considered simultaneously in both these stiffness terms, the critical load (Table 2) is the result of the net effect of these competing terms. This analysis explains the non-monotonic variation of the critical load with an increasing degree nonlocality. Additional observations may be drawn for the non-monotonic results in Table 2 following the parametric studies in Tables 3 and 4. As observed in previous works using fractional-order approaches [ref]31  and strain-driven integral approaches , the decrease in material stiffness of a SS beam, due to nonlocal elasticity, is less pronounced when compared to a CC beam. This suggests that the reduction in the material stiffness matrix [Kb]delimited-[]superscript𝐾𝑏[K^{b}] due to the fractional-order parameters (i.e. to the nonlocal effect) is offset, and subsequently dominated, by the simultaneous decrease in geometric stiffness matrix [Gb]delimited-[]superscript𝐺𝑏[G^{b}] (see Eq. (24)). The above observations are in contrast with the classical integer-order models for nonlocal elasticity. As discussed in the introduction, classical theories predict a consistent reduction in the critical load with increasing degree of nonlocality. This observation was drawn for both the integral   and differential   models of nonlocal elasticity. While in the case of integral-models, this effect was attributed to the reduction in material stiffness (numerator in Eq. (13)), in differential models, it was caused by the the increase in geometric stiffness (denominator in Eq. (13)). The current study highlights that the fractional-order continuum theory for nonlocal elasticity does not present such a monotonic decrease in critical load due to the competing effect resulting from simultaneous decrease in material and geometric stiffness terms, upon increasing the degree of nonlocality. We emphasize that the parametric studies in Tables 3 and 4 that illustrate that the non-monotonic trends in Table 2 are unlike the paradoxical observations noted in literature for integer-models for nonlocal elasticity  . The paradoxical results for Eringen’s integral and differential models stem from a non positive-definite deformation energy density which leads to ill-posed and non self-adjoint governing equations . However, the fractional approach is based on a positive-definite deformation energy density and well-posed self-adjoint governing equations, which directly overcomes this issue. Thus, a consistent reduction of the stiffness (both material and geometric), with increasing degree of nonlocality and independently of the loading and boundary conditions[ref]31 [ref]32, is obtained.\nIn addition to the above quantitative discussion, a more detailed qualitative comparison of the current approach, based on fractional-order continuum theory, with existing classical nonlocal approaches is provided in §5.3. Before proceeding further, we present the transverse mode shapes corresponding to the critical load of the beam and calculated by either integer-  or fractional-order approaches are compared in Fig. 4. While slight changes are noted in the curvature of buckling mode shapes for nonlocal beams, this effect is marginal even for very a pronounced degree of nonlocality, such as for α=0.7𝛼0.7\\alpha=0.7 and lf/L=1subscript𝑙𝑓𝐿1l_{f}/L=1. These results highlight that the inclusion of the nonlocal effects via fractional-order modeling presents minimal effects on the buckling mode shape."
