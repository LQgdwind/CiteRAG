    "discussion and questions": "Our k𝑘k-bounded model is equivalent to SM instances defined on (bipartite) graphs with maximum degree at most k𝑘k. Thus Theorem 4.2 implies that #​SM#SM\\mathrm{\\#SM} remains #​BIS#BIS\\mathrm{\\#BIS}-complete even when restricted to graphs with maximum degree 333. Since graphs with maximum degree 222 (i.e., 222-bounded instances) are disjoint unions of paths and cycles, #​SM#SM\\mathrm{\\#SM} can be solved on 222-bounded instances in polynomial time. (Paths have unique stable matchings, and each cycle can support 111 or 222 stable matchings.) Thus #​SM#SM\\mathrm{\\#SM} has a sharp hardness threshold in the k𝑘k-bounded model at k=3𝑘3k=3. Interestingly, #​BIS#BIS\\mathrm{\\#BIS} shows a similar threshold around k=6𝑘6k=6: counting independent sets in bipartite graphs of maximum degree k≥6𝑘6k\\geq 6 is #​BIS#BIS\\mathrm{\\#BIS}-complete , while instances of maximum degree k≤5𝑘5k\\leq 5 admit an FPRAS, even if vertices on only one side of the bipartition obey the degree bound . Recently, Curticapean et al.  considered other parameterized variants of #​BIS#BIS\\mathrm{\\#BIS}, and showed that the variants admit efficient fixed-parameter algorithms in bounded-degree graphs. It would be interesting to see if #​SM#SM\\mathrm{\\#SM} becomes easy in any “natural” restricted graph class. For what families of (bipartite) graphs can #​SM#SM\\mathrm{\\#SM} be computed or approximated efficiently? Can #​SM#SM\\mathrm{\\#SM} be efficiently computed in planar graphs? Graphs of bounded genus? What rotation posets can be realized by these restricted instances? It seems likely that planar SM instances (i.e., instances where the graph G𝐺G of acceptable partners is planar) realize a restricted family of rotation posets. To see why, note that every rotation corresponds to a cycle in G𝐺G, and a rotation ρ𝜌\\rho can be immediate predecessor of ρ′superscript𝜌′\\rho^{\\prime} only if either the corresponding cycles intersect, or there is an edge connecting a node in one cycle to a node in another. This restriction seems to limit what rotation posets are realizable by planar instances. For example, we believe that a poset 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} whose Hasse diagram is a sufficiently large complete bipartite graph minus a perfect matching cannot be realized by any planar instance. Does the family of rotation posets realized by planar SM instances admit a clean description? Can such a characterization be used to solve structural SM problems more efficiently than the general case? The k𝑘k-attribute, (k1,k2)subscript𝑘1subscript𝑘2(k_{1},k_{2})-list, and k𝑘k-range preference models can also be used to describe SMI instances—that is, SM instances with incomplete preferences. Specifically, an SMI instance arising from one of these models is an instance for which every preference list is a sub-list of an instance in the model with complete preferences. Our construction for the (k1,k2)subscript𝑘1subscript𝑘2(k_{1},k_{2})-list model in Section 5 has the property that there are two master preferences for each gender such that all (incomplete) preference lists are sub-lists of one of the two master lists. Thus, every finite poset is realizable in the SMI variant of the (2,2)22(2,2)-list model. Since complete preferences are a special case of SMI instances, our k𝑘k-attribute construction also implies that SMI k𝑘k-attribute preferences realize all finite posets. What rotation posets can be realized in the SMI variant of the k𝑘k-range model? These restricted preference models can also be generalized to allow for preferences with ties: that is, an agent may be indifferent to a choice of several partners. It is well-known that many stable marriage problems become intractible in instances with both incomplete preferences and ties (see, e.g., ). Consider SM instances with ties and incomplete preferences. What stable matching problems remain NP-hard when restricted to instances arising from the k𝑘k-attribute, (k1,k2)subscript𝑘1subscript𝑘2(k_{1},k_{2})-list, or k𝑘k-range models? Theorem 4.7 characterizes the rotation posets realized in the k𝑘k-attribute model for k≥6𝑘6k\\geq 6, but does not say anything about Attr⁡(k)Attr𝑘\\operatorname{Attr}(k) for k≤5𝑘5k\\leq 5. What rotation posets are realized by Attr⁡(k)Attr𝑘\\operatorname{Attr}(k) for k=2,3,…,5𝑘23…5k=2,3,\\ldots,5? We conjecture that Attr⁡(k)Attr𝑘\\operatorname{Attr}(k) realizes arbitrary rotation posets for any k≥3𝑘3k\\geq 3. This conjecture is consistent with the results of Chebolu et al. , who show that #​SM#SM\\mathrm{\\#SM} is #​BIS#BIS\\mathrm{\\#BIS}-complete in the k𝑘k-attributed model for any k≥3𝑘3k\\geq 3. Our use of cyclic polytopes in Section 4.2 to establish Theorem 4.7 is wasteful in the sense that cyclic polytopes give much stronger guarantees than our result actually requires. Indeed, the construction allows us to embed any 222-dimensional simplicial complex into 𝐑6superscript𝐑6\\mathbf{R}^{6} in convex position. However, our argument only requires that the 222-dimensional faces of the complexes corresponding to preference lists output by 𝖢𝗈𝗇𝗌𝗍𝗋𝗎𝖼𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗇𝖼𝖾𝖢𝗈𝗇𝗌𝗍𝗋𝗎𝖼𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗇𝖼𝖾\\mathsf{ConstructInstance} be embedded in convex position. Thus it seems that a more careful analysis of the output of 𝖢𝗈𝗇𝗌𝗍𝗋𝗎𝖼𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗇𝖼𝖾𝖢𝗈𝗇𝗌𝗍𝗋𝗎𝖼𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗇𝖼𝖾\\mathsf{ConstructInstance} could establish Theorem 4.7 for smaller values of k𝑘k. Chebolu et al.  and Künnemann et al. 2 also consider the k𝑘k-Euclidean preference model defined by Bogomolnaia and Laslier . In this model, each agent is also associated with a point in 𝐑ksuperscript𝐑𝑘\\mathbf{R}^{k}. Preferences are determined by the Euclidean distance between the points: a𝑎a prefers agents in order b1,b2,…,bnsubscript𝑏1subscript𝑏2…subscript𝑏𝑛b_{1},b_{2},\\ldots,b_{n} where b1subscript𝑏1b_{1} is a𝑎a’s nearest agent, b2subscript𝑏2b_{2} the second nearest, and so on. Chebolu et al.  showed that #​SM#SM\\mathrm{\\#SM} is #​BIS#BIS\\mathrm{\\#BIS} complete in the k𝑘k-Euclidean model for k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2. What rotation posets are realized in the k𝑘k-Euclidean model? We suspect that k𝑘k-Euclidean preferences realize arbitrary posets for a relatively small fixed constant k𝑘k. Künnemann et al. 2 also consider an asymmetric version of the k𝑘k-Euclidean model in which each agent a𝑎a has two associated points in Rksuperscript𝑅𝑘R^{k}: a position x→asubscript→𝑥𝑎\\vec{x}_{a} and an opinion y→asubscript→𝑦𝑎\\vec{y}_{a}. The agent a𝑎a ranks agents in order of their position’s distance to a𝑎a’s opinion. That is a𝑎a ranks b1subscript𝑏1b_{1} with y→b1subscript→𝑦subscript𝑏1\\vec{y}_{b_{1}} closest to x→asubscript→𝑥𝑎\\vec{x}_{a} first, and so on. Our 666-attribute construction can be modified to realize arbitrary rotation posets in the asymmetric 666-Euclidean model. In the modified construction, the positions of each m∈M𝑚𝑀m\\in M and w∈W𝑤𝑊w\\in W are the same as the embedding in Section 4.2 (i.e., each agent corresponds to a vertex of a cyclic polytope). If m1,m2,m3subscript𝑚1subscript𝑚2subscript𝑚3m_{1},m_{2},m_{3} appear on w𝑤w’s preference list in the 333-bounded instance constructed by 𝖢𝗈𝗇𝗌𝗍𝗋𝗎𝖼𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗇𝖼𝖾𝖢𝗈𝗇𝗌𝗍𝗋𝗎𝖼𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗇𝖼𝖾\\mathsf{ConstructInstance}, then she can choose her opinion x→wsubscript→𝑥𝑤\\vec{x}_{w} so that (the positions of) x→m1subscript→𝑥subscript𝑚1\\vec{x}_{m_{1}}, x→m2subscript→𝑥subscript𝑚2\\vec{x}_{m_{2}}, and x→m3subscript→𝑥subscript𝑚3\\vec{x}_{m_{3}} are the three closest positions to x→wsubscript→𝑥𝑤\\vec{x}_{w} as follows. Let c→wsubscript→𝑐𝑤\\vec{c}_{w} denote the circumcenter of the triangle in the plane determined by x→m1subscript→𝑥subscript𝑚1\\vec{x}_{m_{1}}, x→m2subscript→𝑥subscript𝑚2\\vec{x}_{m_{2}}, and x→m3subscript→𝑥subscript𝑚3\\vec{x}_{m_{3}}, and let β→w∈𝐑6subscript→𝛽𝑤superscript𝐑6\\vec{\\beta}_{w}\\in\\mathbf{R}^{6} be the vector defined immediately after (1), so that −β→wsubscript→𝛽𝑤-\\vec{\\beta}_{w} is an outward facing normal vector for the plane containing x→m1,m2subscript→𝑥subscript𝑚1subscript𝑚2\\vec{x}_{m_{1}},m_{2}, and m3subscript𝑚3m_{3}. Thus, for any point p∈𝐑6𝑝superscript𝐑6p\\in\\mathbf{R}^{6} of the form y→=c→w−t​β→w→𝑦subscript→𝑐𝑤𝑡subscript→𝛽𝑤\\vec{y}=\\vec{c}_{w}-t\\vec{\\beta}_{w} with t∈𝐑𝑡𝐑t\\in\\mathbf{R}, the points m1,m2subscript𝑚1subscript𝑚2m_{1},m_{2} and m3subscript𝑚3m_{3} are all equidistant from y→→𝑦\\vec{y}. By choosing t𝑡t sufficiently large, we can ensure that, in fact, x→m1subscript→𝑥subscript𝑚1\\vec{x}_{m_{1}}, x→m2subscript→𝑥subscript𝑚2\\vec{x}_{m_{2}} and x→m3subscript→𝑥subscript𝑚3\\vec{x}_{m_{3}} are the three closest points in M𝑀M to y→→𝑦\\vec{y}. By taking y→wsubscript→𝑦𝑤\\vec{y}_{w} to be a slight perturbation of such a y→→𝑦\\vec{y}, we can ensure that for all m≠m1,m2,m3𝑚subscript𝑚1subscript𝑚2subscript𝑚3m\\neq m_{1},m_{2},m_{3}, we have That is, w𝑤w ranks m1subscript𝑚1m_{1}, m2subscript𝑚2m_{2}, and m3subscript𝑚3m_{3} (in that order) ahead of all other men. As with the 666-attribute case, repeating the procedure for all men and women is sufficient to prove that the corresponding asymmetric 666-Euclidean instance realizes the same rotation poset as the underlying 333-bounded instance. While Theorem 5.3 characterizes the rotation posets realizable by (k1,∞)subscript𝑘1(k_{1},\\infty)-list SM instances, it does not say anything about (k1,k2)subscript𝑘1subscript𝑘2(k_{1},k_{2})-list preferences for constant k2subscript𝑘2k_{2}, nor the original k𝑘k-list preference structure of Bhatnagar et al. . What rotation posets can be realized in the (k1,k2)subscript𝑘1subscript𝑘2(k_{1},k_{2})-list model for k1,k2<nsubscript𝑘1subscript𝑘2𝑛k_{1},k_{2}<n? We suspect that for k1=k2=2subscript𝑘1subscript𝑘22k_{1}=k_{2}=2, the rotation poset is restricted, but we are unsure of how to prove even this seemingly simple fact. We note that Künnemann et al. 2 had similar difficulty with the k𝑘k-range model, and posed as an open question whether or not 222-list preferences admit an o​(n2)𝑜superscript𝑛2o(n^{2})-time algorithm for finding a stable matching. Our construction in the proof of Theorem 7.9 shows that every k𝑘k-range instance has a rotation poset whose pathwidth is at most 50​k250superscript𝑘250k^{2}. Can this bound be improved? What is the maximum pathwidth of ℛ​(I)ℛ𝐼\\mathcal{R}(I) for I∈Range⁡(k)𝐼Range𝑘I\\in\\operatorname{Range}(k)? Is it Ω​(k2)Ωsuperscript𝑘2\\Omega(k^{2})? Or can our O​(k2)𝑂superscript𝑘2O(k^{2}) upper bound be imporved to, say, O​(k)𝑂𝑘O(k)? The stable marriage problem has a natural interpretation as a distributed problem, where each agent is represented by a processor and agents communicate via point-to-point communication. In fact, the Gale-Shapley algorithm 5 has a natural interpretation in such a computational model. It is straightforward to show that finding a stable matching requires a number of rounds proportional to the network diameter, even when there are no constraints on local computation and communication (i.e., in the LOCAL model described in 1). If bathdwidth is restricted to O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) bits per edge per communication round (i.e., the CONGEST model 1), finding a stable matching still requires Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(\\sqrt{n}) rounds, even in networks of diameter O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) . Can stable matchings be found faster in distributed models of computation if the preferences are restricted? Consider the distributed stable marriage problem in which each agent is represented by a processor. How many communication rounds are needed to find a stable matching if the preferences are assigned according to the k𝑘k-attribute, (k1,k2)subscript𝑘1subscript𝑘2(k_{1},k_{2})-list, or k𝑘k-range models? We note that “almost stable” matchings can be computed in O​(1)𝑂1O(1) rounds in bounded-degree networks 4 and logO​(1)⁡(n)superscript𝑂1𝑛\\log^{O(1)}(n) rounds in general networks 0. The work of Khanchandani and Wattenhofer  shows that stable matchings in the k𝑘k-range model can be computed with less total communication than the Gale-Shapley algorithm."
