    "probabilistic counters and their applications": "The idea of probabilistic counters, along with the well-known Morris Counter was presented in the seminal paper . The aim was to construct a very small data structure for representing a huge set or events of some kind. In our paper, we concentrate on the Morris Counter analyzed in detail in .\nThe second structure discussed in our paper is MaxGeo Counter introduced and analyzed in . More detailed and precise analysis can be found in 7. The most important application of MaxGeo Counter can be found in , where the authors propose the well-known HyperLogLog algorithm. Its practical applications are widely described in 8. There are several widely used improvements of HyperLogLog algorithm: HyperLogLog+ 8, Streaming HyperLogLog with sketches based either on historic inverse probability 9 or martingal estimator 0 or empirically adjusted HyperBitBit (proposed by R. Sedgewick 1). The main goal of these adjustments is a reduction of the memory requirements (see e.g., 2 or 3).\nFor instance, some of the above solutions are used in database systems for queries’ optimization or for document classification purposes.\nMoreover, MaxGeo counter was used in 4, for an adjustment of ANF tool, developed for data mining from extensive graphs, which enables it to answer many different questions based on some neighborhood function defined on the graph. Unsurprisingly one of the main applications of the approximate counter is to compute the size of a database or its specific subset. A set of such applications can be found in 5. In 6, the authors use Morris Counter for online, probabilistic, and space-efficient counting over streams of fixed, finite length. Authors of 7 proposed an application of a system of Morris Counters for flash memory devices. Another application, presented in 8, is a revisited version of Morris Counter designed for binary floating-point numbers. In 9, Morris Counter is used in a well-known problem of counting the frequency moments of long data streams. Authors of  focused on making probabilistic counters scalable and accurate in concurrent settings. Paper on probabilistic counters in hardware can be found in [ref]31.\nA slightly modified version of Morris Counter called Morris+ was recently introduced in  with the proof of its optimality in terms of accuracy–memory trade-off. In random graphs theory, Morris Counter is usually connected to greedy structures. For instance, in an arrangement of a random labeled graph in Gilbert model G​(n,p)𝐺𝑛𝑝G(n,p), it is possible to construct a greedy stable set Snsubscript𝑆𝑛S_{n}, which size has the same distribution as Morris Counter Mnsubscript𝑀𝑛M_{n} of the base a=(1−p)−1𝑎superscript1𝑝1a=(1-p)^{-1} (see e.g.,  or  for fundamentals of random graph theory). There are many other birth processes that are quite similar to Morris Counter, which are applicable in a variety of disciplines like biology, physics, or the theory of random graphs. Short descriptions of such examples can be found in . When talking about probabilistic counters, it is worth to mention about Bloom filters , which are space-efficient probabilistic data structures that are the representations of sets. There exists a probabilistic counter which approximates the number of elements represented by the given Bloom filter . Other common examples of probabilistic counters are Fpsubscript𝐹𝑝F_{p} counters  , which approximate the p𝑝p-th moments of frequencies of occurrences of different elements in the database. One may note that all the mentioned probabilistic counters have equivalent versions which are consistent with Definition 3 introduced here. Let us also mention a paper [ref]40 where one can find numerous applications of similar constructions for creating pseudorandom sketches in Big Data algorithms. Notice that the variety of possible applications of probabilistic counters creates an opportunity to exploit inherent differential privacy properties. However, a new challenge arises — to calculate the parameters of differential privacy for those counters, which are not connected straightforwardly with Morris or MaxGeo Counters."
