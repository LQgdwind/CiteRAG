    "node classification on real-world datasets": "We now evaluate the performance of BernNet against the competitors on real-world datasets. Following [ref]5, we include three citation graph Cora, CiteSeer and PubMed  [ref]37, and the Amazon co-purchase graph Computers and Photo [ref]20. As shown in [ref]5 these 5 datasets are homophilic graphs on which the connected nodes tend to share the same label. We also include the Wikipedia graph Chameleon and Squirrel , the Actor co-occurrence graph, and webpage graphs Texas and Cornell from WebKB333http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/theo-11/www/wwkb/ . These 5 datasets are heterophilic datasets on which connected nodes tend to have different labels.\nWe summarize the statistics of these datasets in Table 3. Following [ref]5, we perform full-supervised node classification task with each model, where we randomly split the node set into train/validation/test set with ratio 60%/20%/20%. For fairness, we generate 10 random splits by random seeds and evaluate all models on the same splits, and report the average metric for each model. We compare BernNet with 6 baseline models: MLP, GCN , GAT , APPNP , ChebNet , and GPR-GNN [ref]5. For GPR-GNN, we use the officially released code (see the supplementary materials for URL and commit numbers) and set the order of polynomial filter K=10𝐾10K=10. For other models, we use the corresponding Pytorch Geometric library implementations . For BernNet, we use the following propagation process: where f​(𝐗)𝑓𝐗f(\\mathbf{X}) is\na 2-layer MLP with 64 hidden units on the feature matrix 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}.\nNote that this propagation process is almost identical to that of APPNP or GPR-GNN.\nThe only difference is that we substitute the Generalized PageRank polynomial with Bernstein polynomial. We set the K=10𝐾10K=10 and use different learning rate and dropout for the linear layer and the propagation layer. For all models, we optimal leaning rate over {0.001,0.002,0.01,0.05}0.0010.0020.010.05\\{0.001,0.002,0.01,0.05\\} and weight decay {0.0,0.0005}0.00.0005\\{0.0,0.0005\\}. More detailed experimental settings are discussed in Appendix. We use the micro-F1 score with a 95% confidence interval as the evaluation metric.\nThe relevant results are summarized in Table 4.\nBoldface letters indicate the best result for the given confidence interval.\nWe observe that BernNet provides the best results on seven out of the ten datasets.\nOn the other three datasets, BernNet also achieves competitive results against SOTA methods. More interestingly, this experiment also shows BernNet can learn complex filters from real-world datasets with only the supervision of node labels. Figure 4 plots some of the filters BernNet learnt in the training process. On Actor, BernNet learns an all-pass-alike filter, which concurs with the fact that MLP outperforms all other baselines on this dataset. On Chameleon and Squirrel, BernNet learns two comb-alike filters. Given that BernNet outperforms all competitors by at least 1% on these two datasets, it may suggest that comb-alike filters are necessary for Chameleon and Squirrel. Figure 5 shows the Coefficients θksubscript𝜃𝑘\\theta_{k} learnt from real-world datasets by BernNet. When comparing Figures  4 and  5, we observe that the curves of filters and curves of coefficients are almost the same. This is because BernNet’s coefficients are highly correlated with the spectral property of the target filter, which indicates BernNet Bernnet has strong interpretability. Finally, we present the train time for each method in Table  5. BernNet is slower than other methods due to its quadratic dependence on the degree K𝐾K. However, compared to the SOTA method GPR-GNN, the margin is generally less than 222, which is often acceptable in practice. In theory, both ChebNet  and GPR-GNN [ref]5 are linear time complexity related to propagation step K𝐾K, but BernNet is quadratic time complexity related to K𝐾K. Delgado et al.  show that Bernstein approximation can be evaluated in linear time related to K𝐾K using the corner cutting algorithm.\nHowever, BernNet can not use this algorithm directly, because we need to multiply signal 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}. How to convert BernNet to linear complexity will be a problem worth studying in the future."
