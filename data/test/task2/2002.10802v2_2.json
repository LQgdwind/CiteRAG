With polynomials, it is often convenient to switch\nfrom talking about functions f:{0,1}n→{0,1}:𝑓→superscript01𝑛01f\\colon\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\to\\{0,1\\} to talking\nabout functions f:{+1,−1}n→{+1,−1}:𝑓→superscript11𝑛11f\\colon\\{+1,-1\\}^{n}\\to\\{+1,-1\\}.\nNote that by doing a simple variable substitution,\nwe can convert between {0,1}01\\{0,1\\} variables to {+1,−1}11\\{+1,-1\\}\nvariables without changing the degree of the polynomial.\nThat is, we can substitute 1−2​xi12subscript𝑥𝑖1-2x_{i} in place of the variable\nxisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} inside p𝑝p to make it take {0,1}01\\{0,1\\} inputs instead\nof {+1,−1}11\\{+1,-1\\} inputs, and we can substitute\n(1−xi)/21subscript𝑥𝑖2(1-x_{i})/2 to go the other way. We can similarly change\nthe output of p𝑝p from being in the range   [ref]1\nto the range [−1,1]11[-1,1] and vice versa (the error\nchanges by a factor of 222 when switching between\nthese bases). Another well-known observation\nis that to approximate a Boolean function f𝑓f,\nwe only need multilinear polynomials,\nand their degree only needs to be at most n𝑛n. To get our hard distribution, we will use Theorem 5.8.\nWe need to check the four conditions, but using\npolynomials as our “algorithms”. More explicitly,\nthe set 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} will be the set of all real\nn𝑛n-variate multilinear bounded polynomials,\nviewed in the {+1,−1}11\\{+1,-1\\} basis\n(bounded means that p​(x)∈[−1,1]𝑝𝑥11p(x)\\in[-1,1] for all\nx∈{+1,−1}n𝑥superscript11𝑛x\\in\\{+1,-1\\}^{n}).\nFor a polynomial p∈𝒜𝑝𝒜p\\in\\mathcal{A}, we define biasf⁡(p,x)subscriptbias𝑓𝑝𝑥\\operatorname{bias}_{f}(p,x)\nto be f​(x)​p​(x)𝑓𝑥𝑝𝑥f(x)p(x). Then (1) holds,\nas the set of polynomials of a given degree is convex\nand biasf⁡(⋅,x)subscriptbias𝑓⋅𝑥\\operatorname{bias}_{f}(\\cdot,x) is linear over that set.\n(2) holds because every Boolean function\ncan be computed exactly by a polynomial of degree n𝑛n.\nNext, (3) holds because polynomials\nof degree less than 111 have degree 00, and since\nwe’re dealing with bounded polynomials, these are a\nconvex combination of the two constant polynomials\n−11-1 and 111. It remains to show (4). To this end,\nlet P𝑃P be a probability distribution over k𝑘k\npolynomials q1,q2,…,qksubscript𝑞1subscript𝑞2…subscript𝑞𝑘q_{1},q_{2},\\dots,q_{k}, with deg⁡(qi)≤2i​Tdegreesubscript𝑞𝑖superscript2𝑖𝑇\\deg(q_{i})\\leq 2^{i}T.\nLet pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} be the probability P𝑃P assigns to qisubscript𝑞𝑖q_{i},\nand suppose ∑i=1k2i​pi≤5superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑘superscript2𝑖subscript𝑝𝑖5\\sum_{i=1}^{k}2^{i}p_{i}\\leq 5.\nFinally, suppose that biasf⁡(P)≥2−k−1subscriptbias𝑓𝑃superscript2𝑘1\\operatorname{bias}_{f}(P)\\geq 2^{-k-1}.\nOur goal is to find a polynomial q𝑞q of degree\nat most 2k​T⋅poly⁡(k)⋅superscript2𝑘𝑇poly𝑘2^{k}T\\cdot\\operatorname{poly}(k) that computes f𝑓f to\nconstant error. To do so, we’ll need a polynomial\nversion of the amplitude estimation algorithm\nwe did in the quantum case. That is, we’d like\nto estimate the output that polynomial qi​(x)subscript𝑞𝑖𝑥q_{i}(x)\nreturns, and do arithmetic computations on it.\nCrucially, one of the arithmetic computations we’d\nlike to do is comparison, for example, to see if\nqi​(x)>0subscript𝑞𝑖𝑥0q_{i}(x)>0. Such a comparison is not a polynomial operation,\nso we cannot use the polynomial qi​(x)subscript𝑞𝑖𝑥q_{i}(x) itself.\nWhat we’ll do instead is to create polynomials\nthat compute the bits of the binary expansion\nof qi​(x)subscript𝑞𝑖𝑥q_{i}(x), to a certain precision. We will then\ndo arithmetic operations\nusing those bits, and we’ll be able to implement\nthose operations using polynomials. To do so, we’ll need some approximation theory.\nThe following theorem, known as Jackson’s theorem,\nwill be useful. It traces back to Jackson (1911)\n[Jac11], but see also [MMR94] (page 750,\nTheorem 3.1.1) for some discussion and a more thorough\nlist of references. Let α:[−1,1]→ℝ:𝛼→11ℝ\\alpha\\colon[-1,1]\\to\\operatorname{\\mathbb{R}} be a continuous\nfunction, and let n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N}. Then there is\na real polynomial p𝑝p of degree n𝑛n such that\nfor all x∈[−1,1]𝑥11x\\in[-1,1], we have In particular, if α𝛼\\alpha\nhas Lipschitz constant K𝐾K, then for each n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N}\nthere is a polynomial pnsubscript𝑝𝑛p_{n} of degree\nat most n𝑛n which approximates\nα𝛼\\alpha to within an additive 6​K/n6𝐾𝑛6K/n at each point\nin [−1,1]11[-1,1]. Jackson’s theorem\ncan be used to prove the well-known\nresult that polynomials can be amplified with\na linear dependence in the bias.\nFor completeness, we reprove this here\n(see also e.g. [GKKT17]). For each γ∈(0,1)𝛾01\\gamma\\in(0,1),\nthere is a real polynomial p𝑝p of degree at most 13/γ13𝛾13/\\gamma\nsuch that p𝑝p maps [−1,1]11[-1,1] to [−1,1]11[-1,1],\np𝑝p maps [−1,−γ]1𝛾[-1,-\\gamma] to [−1,−1/3]113[-1,-1/3], and\np𝑝p maps [γ,1]𝛾1[\\gamma,1] to [1/3,1]131[1/3,1]. Let α:[−1,1]→ℝ:𝛼→11ℝ\\alpha\\colon[-1,1]\\to\\operatorname{\\mathbb{R}} be the function with\nα​(x)=−2/3𝛼𝑥23\\alpha(x)=-2/3 for x∈[−1,−γ]𝑥1𝛾x\\in[-1,-\\gamma],\nα​(x)=2/3𝛼𝑥23\\alpha(x)=2/3 for x∈[γ,1]𝑥𝛾1x\\in[\\gamma,1], and\nα​(x)=2​x/3​γ𝛼𝑥2𝑥3𝛾\\alpha(x)=2x/3\\gamma for x∈(−γ,γ)𝑥𝛾𝛾x\\in(-\\gamma,\\gamma).\nThen α𝛼\\alpha is continuous and has Lipschitz\nconstant 2/3​γ23𝛾2/3\\gamma. By Theorem 6.1,\nfor every n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N}, there exists a polynomial\npnsubscript𝑝𝑛p_{n} of degree at most n𝑛n which approximates\nα𝛼\\alpha to additive error 4/γ​n4𝛾𝑛4/\\gamma n.\nPicking n=⌈12/γ⌉≤13/γ𝑛12𝛾13𝛾n=\\lceil 12/\\gamma\\rceil\\leq 13/\\gamma,\nwe get a polynomial which approximates α𝛼\\alpha\nto error 1/3131/3, which means it has the desired\nproperties.\n∎ We will also need an amplification polynomial\nthat goes from constant bias to small error.\nWe reprove the following well-known lemma here\nfor completeness (it also appears\nin [BNRW07], and another version appears\nin [She13]). For each ϵ∈(0,2/3)italic-ϵ023\\epsilon\\in(0,2/3), there is a real polynomial\np𝑝p of degree at most 17​log⁡(1/ϵ)171italic-ϵ17\\log(1/\\epsilon) such that p𝑝p maps\n[−1,1]11[-1,1] to [−1,1]11[-1,1], p𝑝p maps [−1,−1/3]113[-1,-1/3] to [−1,−(1−ϵ)]11italic-ϵ[-1,-(1-\\epsilon)],\nand p𝑝p maps [1/3,1]131[1/3,1] to [1−ϵ,1]1italic-ϵ1[1-\\epsilon,1]. We set and set p​(x)=1−2​q​(x)𝑝𝑥12𝑞𝑥p(x)=1-2q(x). Note that for x∈[−1,1]𝑥11x\\in[-1,1],\nthe value q​(x)𝑞𝑥q(x) is exactly the probability that,\nwhen flipping a coin 2​k+12𝑘12k+1 times, less than half\nof the coin flips will come out heads, assuming the probability\nof heads is (1+x)/21𝑥2(1+x)/2. Because of this interpretation,\nwe know that q𝑞q maps [−1,1]11[-1,1] to   [ref]1 and is decreasing\nin x𝑥x, so p𝑝p maps [−1,1]11[-1,1] to [−1,1]11[-1,1] and is increasing in x𝑥x.\nWe also have q​(x)=1−q​(−x)𝑞𝑥1𝑞𝑥q(x)=1-q(-x), which means that\np​(−x)=−p​(x)𝑝𝑥𝑝𝑥p(-x)=-p(x), i.e. p𝑝p is odd. Given these properties,\nthe lemma will follow if we show that p​(1/3)≥1−ϵ𝑝131italic-ϵp(1/3)\\geq 1-\\epsilon,\nor equivalently, that q​(1/3)≤ϵ/2𝑞13italic-ϵ2q(1/3)\\leq\\epsilon/2. We have To get this to be smaller than ϵ/2italic-ϵ2\\epsilon/2, it suffices\nto pick k𝑘k large enough so that (8/9)k≤ϵsuperscript89𝑘italic-ϵ(8/9)^{k}\\leq\\epsilon,\nor equivalently, k≥1log⁡(9/8)​log⁡(1/ϵ)𝑘1981italic-ϵk\\geq\\frac{1}{\\log(9/8)}\\log(1/\\epsilon).\nHence we can pick k=⌈1log⁡(9/8)​log⁡(1/ϵ)⌉≤1log⁡(9/8)​log⁡(1/ϵ)+1𝑘1981italic-ϵ1981italic-ϵ1k=\\lceil\\frac{1}{\\log(9/8)}\\log(1/\\epsilon)\\rceil\\leq\\frac{1}{\\log(9/8)}\\log(1/\\epsilon)+1.\nThe degree of p𝑝p will be\n2​k+1≤2log⁡(9/8)​log⁡(1/ϵ)+32𝑘12981italic-ϵ32k+1\\leq\\frac{2}{\\log(9/8)}\\log(1/\\epsilon)+3.\nNote that ϵ≤2/3italic-ϵ23\\epsilon\\leq 2/3, so log⁡(1/ϵ)≥log⁡(3/2)1italic-ϵ32\\log(1/\\epsilon)\\geq\\log(3/2),\nand hence 2log⁡(9/8)​log⁡(1/ϵ)+3≤(2log⁡(9/8)+3log⁡(3/2))​log⁡(1/ϵ)≤17​log⁡(1/ϵ)2981italic-ϵ32983321italic-ϵ171italic-ϵ\\frac{2}{\\log(9/8)}\\log(1/\\epsilon)+3\\leq\\left(\\frac{2}{\\log(9/8)}+\\frac{3}{\\log(3/2)}\\right)\\log(1/\\epsilon)\\leq 17\\log(1/\\epsilon).\n∎ Equipped with these approximation-theoretic tools,\nwe will now tackle (4), showing that probability\ndistributions over polynomials (which achieve a small\namount of worst-case bias γ𝛾\\gamma for computing f𝑓f) can\nbe amplified to polynomials which compute f𝑓f to constant\nerror, using only a nearly-linear dependence on 1/γ1𝛾1/\\gamma. As in (4), let P𝑃P be a probability distribution\nover k𝑘k bounded multilinear polynomials q1,q2,…,qksubscript𝑞1subscript𝑞2…subscript𝑞𝑘q_{1},q_{2},\\dots,q_{k},\nwhich assigns them probabilities p1,p2,…,pksubscript𝑝1subscript𝑝2…subscript𝑝𝑘p_{1},p_{2},\\dots,p_{k}\nrespectively. Suppose that ∑i=1k2i​pi≤5superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑘superscript2𝑖subscript𝑝𝑖5\\sum_{i=1}^{k}2^{i}p_{i}\\leq 5,\nthat deg⁡(qi)≤2i​Tdegreesubscript𝑞𝑖superscript2𝑖𝑇\\deg(q_{i})\\leq 2^{i}T for some real number T𝑇T,\nand that f​(x)​∑i=1kpi​qi​(x)≥2−k−1𝑓𝑥superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑘subscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝑞𝑖𝑥superscript2𝑘1f(x)\\sum_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}q_{i}(x)\\geq 2^{-k-1}\nfor all x∈Dom⁡(f)𝑥Dom𝑓x\\in\\operatorname{Dom}(f). Then there is a bounded\nmultilinear polynomial q𝑞q which approximates\nf𝑓f with bias at least 1/3131/3 and which satisfies\ndeg⁡(q)≤2k​T⋅poly⁡(k)degree𝑞⋅superscript2𝑘𝑇poly𝑘\\deg(q)\\leq 2^{k}T\\cdot\\operatorname{poly}(k). Recall that in the quantum case, we estimated\nthe bias of the i𝑖i-th algorithm to within\n2−(k−i)/20superscript2𝑘𝑖202^{-(k-i)}/20, with success probability\nat least 1−1/3​k113𝑘1-1/3k. We will do a polynomial version of this.\nWhat does estimating qi​(x)subscript𝑞𝑖𝑥q_{i}(x) mean, for polynomials?\nIt means we will construct polynomials\nwhich approximately compute the bits in the binary expansion\nof the number qi​(x)subscript𝑞𝑖𝑥q_{i}(x). We will have one polynomial\nfor the sign, and an additional k−i+4𝑘𝑖4k-i+4 polynomials\nfor the first k−i+4𝑘𝑖4k-i+4 digits in the binary expansion\nof qi​(x)subscript𝑞𝑖𝑥q_{i}(x). In order to do so, we compose univariate polynomials\nwith qisubscript𝑞𝑖q_{i}. This way, the task reduces to creating\nunivariate polynomials which output the bits in\nthe binary expansion of their input (assuming\nthey all receive the same input). More explicitly,\nthe correctness condition is as follows.\nWe say the binary expansion of a real number\nβ∈[−1,1]𝛽11\\beta\\in[-1,1] is 2−ℓsuperscript2ℓ2^{-\\ell}-robust to t𝑡t bits if\nthe first t𝑡t bits of the binary expansion of\nβ+ϵ𝛽italic-ϵ\\beta+\\epsilon is the same\nas that of β𝛽\\beta for all\nϵ∈[−2−ℓ,2−ℓ]italic-ϵsuperscript2ℓsuperscript2ℓ\\epsilon\\in[-2^{-\\ell},2^{-\\ell}].\nThen we require univariate polynomials\nd0ℓ,d1ℓ,…,dkℓsuperscriptsubscript𝑑0ℓsuperscriptsubscript𝑑1ℓ…superscriptsubscript𝑑𝑘ℓd_{0}^{\\ell},d_{1}^{\\ell},\\dots,d_{k}^{\\ell}\nsuch that if β∈[−1,1]𝛽11\\beta\\in[-1,1] is 2−ℓsuperscript2ℓ2^{-\\ell}-robust to\nat least t𝑡t bits,\nthen dtℓ​(β)superscriptsubscript𝑑𝑡ℓ𝛽d_{t}^{\\ell}(\\beta) is within O​(1/k10)𝑂1superscript𝑘10O(1/k^{10})\nof the t𝑡t-th bit in the binary expansion of β𝛽\\beta.\nThe polynomial d0ℓsuperscriptsubscript𝑑0ℓd_{0}^{\\ell} needs to output\nthe sign of β𝛽\\beta if β𝛽\\beta is 2−ℓsuperscript2ℓ2^{-\\ell}-robust to\nat least 00 bits\n(that is, if the sign of β𝛽\\beta does not change upon adding\nor subtracting 2−ℓsuperscript2ℓ2^{-\\ell}).\nWe will also require all these polynomials to be bounded,\ni.e. they must map [−1,1]11[-1,1] to [−1,1]11[-1,1]. To implement these polynomials, we use Theorem 6.1.\nFor simplicity, let’s represent the bits in the binary\nexpansion using +11+1 and −11-1 instead of 00 and 111\n(converting back is easy). Consider the function\nαisubscript𝛼𝑖\\alpha_{i} which outputs the i𝑖i-th bit\nof the binary expansion of its input (or the sign\nif i=0𝑖0i=0). This i𝑖i is a step function: for i=0𝑖0i=0,\nα0​(β)subscript𝛼0𝛽\\alpha_{0}(\\beta) jumps from −11-1 to 111 at β=0𝛽0\\beta=0;\nfor i=1𝑖1i=1, α1​(β)subscript𝛼1𝛽\\alpha_{1}(\\beta) similarly jumps from\n−11-1 to 111 and back at β=−1/2,0,1/2𝛽12012\\beta=-1/2,0,1/2. More generally,\nαisubscript𝛼𝑖\\alpha_{i} has 2i+1superscript2𝑖12^{i+1} different plateaus of\n111 or −11-1 on its domain [−1,1]11[-1,1].\nNow, since we only care about getting the i𝑖i-th bit correct\nif the i𝑖i-th bit is robust to β𝛽\\beta changing\nby 2−ℓsuperscript2ℓ2^{-\\ell}, consider the continuous functions\nαiℓsuperscriptsubscript𝛼𝑖ℓ\\alpha_{i}^{\\ell} which make the jumps from −11-1 to 111\ncontinuous by starting from 2−ℓsuperscript2ℓ2^{-\\ell} before\nthe jump point, ending 2−ℓsuperscript2ℓ2^{-\\ell} after the jump point,\nand drawing a continuous line in between\n(the slope of the line will be ±2−ℓplus-or-minussuperscript2ℓ\\pm 2^{-\\ell}).\nThis is well-defined as long as ℓℓ\\ell is sufficiently\nlarger than i𝑖i, say ℓ≥i+2ℓ𝑖2\\ell\\geq i+2. Note that αiℓsuperscriptsubscript𝛼𝑖ℓ\\alpha_{i}^{\\ell} has Lipschitz constant\n2−ℓsuperscript2ℓ2^{-\\ell}. This means we can use Theorem 6.1\nto estimate αiℓsuperscriptsubscript𝛼𝑖ℓ\\alpha_{i}^{\\ell} by a polynomial of degree\nO​(2ℓ)𝑂superscript2ℓO(2^{\\ell}) which achieves constant additive error\n(say, 1/101101/10). We can scale down these polynomials slightly\nto ensure they remain bounded in [−1,1]11[-1,1]. We then plug them\ninto a single variate bounded polynomial of degree\nO​(log⁡k)𝑂𝑘O(\\log k) that we get from Lemma 6.3,\nin order to amplify the error down to O​(1/k10)𝑂1superscript𝑘10O(1/k^{10}).\nThe result are polynomials dtℓsuperscriptsubscript𝑑𝑡ℓd_{t}^{\\ell} (for ℓ≥t+2ℓ𝑡2\\ell\\geq t+2)\nthat have degree O​(2ℓ​log⁡k)𝑂superscript2ℓ𝑘O(2^{\\ell}\\log k) and, on input\nβ𝛽\\beta which is 2−ℓsuperscript2ℓ2^{-\\ell}-robust to bit at least t𝑡t,\ncorrectly output the t𝑡t-th bit of β𝛽\\beta\nexcept with additive error O​(1/k10)𝑂1superscript𝑘10O(1/k^{10}). Now, to get an estimate of qi​(x)subscript𝑞𝑖𝑥q_{i}(x) to k−i+5𝑘𝑖5k-i+5\nbits, we set ℓ=k−i+O​(log⁡k)ℓ𝑘𝑖𝑂𝑘\\ell=k-i+O(\\log k) and compose\ndtℓ​(qi​(x))superscriptsubscript𝑑𝑡ℓsubscript𝑞𝑖𝑥d_{t}^{\\ell}(q_{i}(x)) for t=0,1,2,…,k−i+5𝑡012…𝑘𝑖5t=0,1,2,\\dots,k-i+5.\nActually, we scale down qi​(x)subscript𝑞𝑖𝑥q_{i}(x) and\nadd an extra variable yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i}\nrepresenting a noise term for qi​(x)subscript𝑞𝑖𝑥q_{i}(x);\nthe final estimating polynomials will be\nthe n+1𝑛1n+1 variate polynomials\nri,t​(x,yi)≔dtℓ​((9/10)​qi​(x)+yi)≔subscript𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑥subscript𝑦𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑑𝑡ℓ910subscript𝑞𝑖𝑥subscript𝑦𝑖r_{i,t}(x,y_{i})\\coloneqq d_{t}^{\\ell}((9/10)q_{i}(x)+y_{i}).\nNote that the degree of ri,tsubscript𝑟𝑖𝑡r_{i,t} is\nO​(2k−i+O​(log⁡k)​log⁡k⋅deg⁡(qi))=O​(2k​T​poly⁡(k))𝑂superscript2𝑘𝑖𝑂𝑘⋅𝑘degreesubscript𝑞𝑖𝑂superscript2𝑘𝑇poly𝑘O(2^{k-i+O(\\log k)}\\log k\\cdot\\deg(q_{i}))=O(2^{k}T\\operatorname{poly}(k)). Next, consider the function which takes binary\nrepresentations (to k+5𝑘5k+5 bits each) of numbers\nλi∈[−1,1]subscript𝜆𝑖11\\lambda_{i}\\in[-1,1],\nand outputs the sign of ∑i=1kpi​λisuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑘subscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝜆𝑖\\sum_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}\\lambda_{i}, where\npisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} are known non-negative constants which sum to 111.\nThis is a Boolean function of O​(k2)𝑂superscript𝑘2O(k^{2}) variables,\nso it can be computed exactly by a multilinear polynomial\nof degree O​(k2)𝑂superscript𝑘2O(k^{2}). Call this polynomial s𝑠s.\nNext, plug in the polynomials ri,tsubscript𝑟𝑖𝑡r_{i,t} into the inputs\nof s𝑠s, so that s𝑠s calculates the sign of the sum\n∑i=1kpi​β~isuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑘subscript𝑝𝑖subscript~𝛽𝑖\\sum_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}\\tilde{\\beta}_{i} where each\nβ~isubscript~𝛽𝑖\\tilde{\\beta}_{i} is the estimate of (9/10)​qi​(x)+yi910subscript𝑞𝑖𝑥subscript𝑦𝑖(9/10)q_{i}(x)+y_{i}\nthat is computed by the polynomials dtk−i+10subscriptsuperscript𝑑𝑘𝑖10𝑡d^{k-i+10}_{t}.\nCall this composed polynomial u​(x,y)𝑢𝑥𝑦u(x,y). Observe that u​(x,y)𝑢𝑥𝑦u(x,y) is a polynomial in n+k𝑛𝑘n+k variables\n(n𝑛n variables from x𝑥x and k𝑘k variables yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i}),\nand has degree O​(2k​T​poly⁡(k))𝑂superscript2𝑘𝑇poly𝑘O(2^{k}T\\operatorname{poly}(k)).\nThis polynomial attempts to compute the sign of\n(9/10)​∑i=1kpi​qi​(x)+∑i=1kpi​yi910superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑘subscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝑞𝑖𝑥superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑘subscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖(9/10)\\sum_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}q_{i}(x)+\\sum_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}y_{i}.\nSince we know that\n∑i=1kpi​qi​(x)⋅f​(x)≥2−k−1superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑘⋅subscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝑞𝑖𝑥𝑓𝑥superscript2𝑘1\\sum_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}q_{i}(x)\\cdot f(x)\\geq 2^{-k-1},\nthis sign computed by u​(x,y)𝑢𝑥𝑦u(x,y) will equal f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x)\nso long as |∑i=1kpi​yi|≤2−k−2superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑘subscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖superscript2𝑘2\\left|\\sum_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}y_{i}\\right|\\leq 2^{-k-2}.\nRecall that ∑i=1k2i​pi≤5superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑘superscript2𝑖subscript𝑝𝑖5\\sum_{i=1}^{k}2^{i}p_{i}\\leq 5.\nHence to guarantee that\n|∑i=1kpi​yi|≤2−k−2superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑘subscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖superscript2𝑘2\\left|\\sum_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}y_{i}\\right|\\leq 2^{-k-2},\nit suffices to choose each yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i} such that |yi|≤2−(k−i+5)subscript𝑦𝑖superscript2𝑘𝑖5|y_{i}|\\leq 2^{-(k-i+5)}.\nNow, let’s call qi​(x)+yisubscript𝑞𝑖𝑥subscript𝑦𝑖q_{i}(x)+y_{i} good if it\nis 2−(k−i+O​(log⁡k))superscript2𝑘𝑖𝑂𝑘2^{-(k-i+O(\\log k))}-robust to k−i+5𝑘𝑖5k-i+5 bits.\nIf all qi​(x)+yisubscript𝑞𝑖𝑥subscript𝑦𝑖q_{i}(x)+y_{i} are good for all i𝑖i, then ri,tsubscript𝑟𝑖𝑡r_{i,t}\ncorrectly compute the bits to additive error O​(1/k10)𝑂1superscript𝑘10O(1/k^{10}),\nthen a multilinear polynomial of degree O​(k2)𝑂superscript𝑘2O(k^{2}) in O​(k2)𝑂superscript𝑘2O(k^{2})\nvariables will still correctly compute its output to\nsmall error, certainly O​(1/k)𝑂1𝑘O(1/k). Hence if all qi​(x)+yisubscript𝑞𝑖𝑥subscript𝑦𝑖q_{i}(x)+y_{i}\nare good for all i𝑖i and if yi≤2−k−2/ksubscript𝑦𝑖superscript2𝑘2𝑘y_{i}\\leq 2^{-k-2}/k for all i𝑖i,\nu​(x,y)𝑢𝑥𝑦u(x,y) outputs f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x) to error O​(1/k)𝑂1𝑘O(1/k). To ensure that qi​(x)+yisubscript𝑞𝑖𝑥subscript𝑦𝑖q_{i}(x)+y_{i} are good, we pick yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i} at random.\nThat is, we have an allowed range [−2−(k−i+5),2−(k−i+5)]superscript2𝑘𝑖5superscript2𝑘𝑖5[-2^{-(k-i+5)},2^{-(k-i+5)}]\nfor yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i}; we fit poly⁡(k)poly𝑘\\operatorname{poly}(k) evenly spaced points into\nthis range, so that the gap between the points is\n2−(k−i+O​(log⁡k))superscript2𝑘𝑖𝑂𝑘2^{-(k-i+O(\\log k))}. Note that for all but a constant\nnumber of choices of yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i} among these poly⁡(k)poly𝑘\\operatorname{poly}(k) options,\nthe resulting number qi​(x)+yisubscript𝑞𝑖𝑥subscript𝑦𝑖q_{i}(x)+y_{i} will be\n2−(k−i+O​(log⁡k))superscript2𝑘𝑖𝑂𝑘2^{-(k-i+O(\\log k))}-robust to k−i+5𝑘𝑖5k-i+5 bits. Hence\nby randomly selecting yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i}, the probability that qi​(x)+yisubscript𝑞𝑖𝑥subscript𝑦𝑖q_{i}(x)+y_{i}\nis not good is at most O​(1/poly⁡(k))𝑂1poly𝑘O(1/\\operatorname{poly}(k)). By the union bound,\nthis choice means that all qi​(x)+yisubscript𝑞𝑖𝑥subscript𝑦𝑖q_{i}(x)+y_{i} are good except\nwith constant probability.\nHence u​(x,y)𝑢𝑥𝑦u(x,y) computes f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x) to O​(1/k)𝑂1𝑘O(1/k) error with high\nprobability when y𝑦y is chosen at random according to the above\nprocedure. Finally, we let q​(x)𝑞𝑥q(x) be the average of the polynomials\nu​(x,y)𝑢𝑥𝑦u(x,y) for all possible choices of y𝑦y in the above procedure.\nSince u​(x,y)𝑢𝑥𝑦u(x,y) outputs a number very close to f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x)\nwhen y𝑦y is good, and since it is always bounded in [−1,1]11[-1,1],\nand since y𝑦y is good with high probability, we conclude that\nq​(x)𝑞𝑥q(x) computes f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x) to bounded error. It is also bounded\noutside the promise of f𝑓f. The degree of q​(x)𝑞𝑥q(x)\nwas O​(2k​T​poly⁡(k))𝑂superscript2𝑘𝑇poly𝑘O(2^{k}T\\operatorname{poly}(k)). We note that q​(x)𝑞𝑥q(x)\nas we constructed it here can actually be viewed\nas a polynomial ρ𝜌\\rho in k𝑘k variables composed with the polynomials\nq1,q2,…,qksubscript𝑞1subscript𝑞2…subscript𝑞𝑘q_{1},q_{2},\\dots,q_{k}.\n∎ The above amplification theorem allows us to conclude the\nfollowing theorem. let f:{+1,−1}n→{+1,−1}:𝑓→superscript11𝑛11f\\colon\\{+1,-1\\}^{n}\\to\\{+1,-1\\} be a (possibly partial)\nBoolean function. Then there is a vector ψ∈[−1,1]Dom⁡(f)𝜓superscript11Dom𝑓\\psi\\in[-1,1]^{\\operatorname{Dom}(f)}\nsuch that ‖ψ‖1=1subscriptnorm𝜓11\\|\\psi\\|_{1}=1, ⟨ψ,f⟩=1𝜓𝑓1\\langle\\psi,f\\rangle=1,\nand for any polynomial p𝑝p which is bounded\n(i.e. |p​(x)|≤1𝑝𝑥1|p(x)|\\leq 1 for x∈{+1,−1}n𝑥superscript11𝑛x\\in\\{+1,-1\\}^{n}), we have Here adeg⁡(f)adeg𝑓\\operatorname{adeg}(f) denotes the minimum degree of a bounded polynomial\np𝑝p which computes f𝑓f to bounded error. The constants in the\nΩ~~Ω\\tilde{\\Omega} notation are universal. This follows immediately by taking ψ𝜓\\psi to be defined by\nψ​(x)=f​(x)​μ​[x]𝜓𝑥𝑓𝑥𝜇delimited-[]𝑥\\psi(x)=f(x)\\mu[x], where μ𝜇\\mu is the hard distribution\nwe get from Theorem 5.8.\n∎"
