  "sections": {
    "background and related work": "Cooperation is defined as several self-interested agents performing actions that jointly improve the welfare of an entire group. The natural world is filled with examples of cooperation between self-interested organisms that enable the pursuit of goals beyond the reach of isolated individuals [ref]1. However, cooperating can often appear illogical for individuals, especially in situations known as social dilemmas that embody conflicts between individual-payoff maximising choices and group-payoff maximising choices  . Social dilemmas are ubiquitous throughout human society, with examples including choosing whether to obey fishing quotas , pay taxes  or reduce carbon emissions . Therefore, socially intelligent AI agents designed for integration within human societies must learn to navigate these complex social dilemmas . Social dilemmas are defined as situations where each individual’s payoff for a non-cooperative choice is higher than their payoff for a cooperative one, but if too many individuals choose not to cooperate a societal collapse might occur and the entire group could receive a lower payoff than if they had all cooperated   . This results in the first-order free rider problem, where individuals are motivated to maximise their reward by receiving the group benefit generated by cooperators, whilst not cooperating themselves . Social mechanisms, such as punishment, partner selection and reputation, are powerful tools for influencing the behaviours of populations towards socially responsible choices instead of free-riding. As a result, a variety of social mechanisms have been proposed for the development of cooperative AI systems in recent years [ref]1  6. While the social mechanisms of reputation and partner selection have been shown to facilitate the emergence of cooperation within small groups, previous work within the domains of evolutionary psychology and game theory have illustrated that these mechanisms fail to scale to the size and complexity of the cooperation observed within large human populations. Therefore, the use of punishment against norm violators has been proposed as the explanation for the emergence of large-scale non-kin cooperation observed within human societies  6 7  8 0."
