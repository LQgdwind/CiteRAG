    "our contribution.": "For the generalized version of\ndependency constrained problems, together with graph G𝐺G and (di)graph\nD𝐷D, we also consider functions ℓℓ\\ell and u𝑢u that assign, to each\ne∈E​(G)𝑒𝐸𝐺e\\in E(G), a lower and an upper bound on the number of dependencies\nthat must be ensured for e𝑒e. This means that a subgraph\nH⊆G𝐻𝐺H\\subseteq G satisfies the imposed constraints if and only if the\nnumber of edges in E​(H)∩𝖽𝖾𝗉​(e)𝐸𝐻𝖽𝖾𝗉𝑒E(H)\\cap{\\sf dep}(e) is at least ℓ​(e)ℓ𝑒\\ell(e) and at\nmost u​(e)𝑢𝑒u(e), for every e∈E​(G)𝑒𝐸𝐺e\\in E(G)111We can always assume that\n0≤ℓ​(e)≤u​(e)≤|𝖽𝖾𝗉​(e)|0ℓ𝑒𝑢𝑒𝖽𝖾𝗉𝑒0\\leq\\ell(e)\\leq u(e)\\leq|{\\sf dep}(e)|, and so ℓ​(e)=u​(e)=0ℓ𝑒𝑢𝑒0\\ell(e)=u(e)=0 if\n𝖽𝖾𝗉​(e)=∅𝖽𝖾𝗉𝑒{\\sf dep}(e)=\\emptyset.; we then say that H𝐻H\n(ℓ,u)ℓ𝑢(\\ell,u)-satisfies D𝐷D. When H𝐻H is asked to be a spanning\ntree, we call the problem the Generalized Dependency\nConstrained Spanning Tree problem, and denote it by\nG-DCST. Also, sometimes we deal with the related optimization\nproblem by considering weights on the edges of G𝐺G;\nthis is called the Generalized Dependency Constrained Minimum\nSpanning Tree problem, and is denoted by G-DCMST. Let us\nobserve that when ℓ​(e)=0ℓ𝑒0\\ell(e)=0 and u​(e)≥|𝖽𝖾𝗉​(e)|𝑢𝑒𝖽𝖾𝗉𝑒u(e)\\geq|{\\sf dep}(e)|, for all\ne∈E​(G)𝑒𝐸𝐺e\\in E(G), then G-DCST is equivalent to deciding whether\nG𝐺G is connected, and G-DCMST corresponds to the classical\nMinimum Spanning Tree problem. Clearly, the feasibility problem G-DCST is a particular case\nof the optimization problem G-DCMST, where the weight of each\nedge is equal to one. This is why, whenever possible, we give preference to prove\n\\NP\\NP\\NP-completeness results for the feasibility problem, and get\npolynomial results for the optimization problem.\nWe use reductions from (3,2,2)322(3,2,2)-SAT to prove our main \\NP\\NP\\NP-completeness results, whereas our polynomial results arise as consequences of the Matroid Intersection Theorem  (cf. Section 2). Considering the generalized version of the spanning tree problem,\ngiven a graph G𝐺G, a digraph D=(E​(G),A)𝐷𝐸𝐺𝐴D=(E(G),A), and functions ℓ,uℓ𝑢\\ell,u,\nwe prove that deciding whether G𝐺G has a spanning tree that\n(ℓ,u)ℓ𝑢(\\ell,u)-satisfies D𝐷D is \\NP\\NP\\NP-complete in the following cases: ℓ​(e)=u​(e)=|𝖽𝖾𝗉​(e)|ℓ𝑒𝑢𝑒𝖽𝖾𝗉𝑒\\ell(e)=u(e)=|{\\sf dep}(e)| for every e∈E​(G)𝑒𝐸𝐺e\\in E(G),\nD𝐷D is a forest of oriented paths of length at most two where all\ncomponents are directed paths, out-stars, or in-stars, and G𝐺G is an\nouterplanar chordal graph with diameter at most two. Furthermore, this\nproblem cannot be solved in time 2o​(n+m)superscript2𝑜𝑛𝑚2^{o(n+m)} unless the ETH fails,\nwhere n=|V​(G)|𝑛𝑉𝐺n=|V(G)| and m=|E​(G)|𝑚𝐸𝐺m=|E(G)|; When ℓ,uℓ𝑢\\ell,u are constant functions, for every pair\nof constant values such that ℓ≤uℓ𝑢\\ell\\leq u; When ℓ​(e)=0ℓ𝑒0\\ell(e)=0, and u​(e)=|𝖽𝖾𝗉​(e)|−1𝑢𝑒𝖽𝖾𝗉𝑒1u(e)=|{\\sf dep}(e)|-1, for every\ne∈E​(G)𝑒𝐸𝐺e\\in E(G). On the positive side, we prove the following: G-DCST can be solved in polynomial time when\nD𝐷D is an oriented matching, and\nℓ​(e)=u​(e)=|𝖽𝖾𝗉​(e)|ℓ𝑒𝑢𝑒𝖽𝖾𝗉𝑒\\ell(e)=u(e)=|{\\sf dep}(e)| for every e∈E​(G)𝑒𝐸𝐺e\\in E(G); G-DCMST can be solved in polynomial time when\nℓ=0ℓ0\\ell=0, D𝐷D is a collection of symmetric complete digraphs\nD1,…,Dksubscript𝐷1…subscript𝐷𝑘D_{1},\\ldots,D_{k}, and u​(e)=u​(e′)𝑢𝑒𝑢superscript𝑒′u(e)=u(e^{\\prime}) whenever e,e′𝑒superscript𝑒′e,e^{\\prime} are within the\nsame component of D𝐷D; G-DCST can be solved in time\nO​(2m⋅(n+m))𝑂⋅superscript2𝑚𝑛𝑚O(2^{m}\\cdot(n+m)), where n=|V​(G)|𝑛𝑉𝐺n=|V(G)| and m=|E​(G)|𝑚𝐸𝐺m=|E(G)|. It is worth observing that a and i define a dichotomy between polynomial and hard cases for G-DCST when regarding D𝐷D as a family of oriented paths. It can be solved in polynomial time if length of the longest path in the underlying graph of D𝐷D is at most one, and it is \\NP-Complete otherwise. We also prove that many of the constrained spanning tree (CST)\nproblems that have been investigated in the literature can be modeled\nwith our general problem, namely the Conflict\nCST , the Forcing\nCST , the At Least One/All\nDependency CST , the Maximum Degree\nCST , the Minimum Degree\nCST , and the Fixed-Leaves Minimum Degree\nCST 2. All our reductions preserve the value of\nthe solutions, which means that also the optimization version of these\nproblems can be modeled within our framework. Notice that the previously mentioned CST problems impose (vertex-wise\nor edge-wise) local constraints to describe their set of feasible\nspanning trees. This contrasts with Maximum Diameter\nCST , Minimum Diameter CST 7 8 (with variations  ) and\nMaximum Leaves CST 5 , examples of\n\\NP\\NP\\NP-hard problems that impose constraints on global tree parameters.\nIn 1, the authors propose an approach that includes also\nthese global constraints, but from a practical point of view."
