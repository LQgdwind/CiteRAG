    "vii related work on optical cnn accelerators": "To accelerate CNN inferences with low latency and low energy consumption, prior works proposed various accelerators based on photonic integrated circuits (PICs) (e.g.,  [ref]12   [ref]14). These accelerators employ PIC-based Vector Dot Product Cores (VDPCs) to perform multiple parallel VDP operations. Some accelerators implement digital VDPCs (e.g., [ref]18 ), whereas some others employ analog VDPCs (e.g.,  [ref]12  ). Different VDPC implementations employ MRRs (e.g.,   [ref]12  ) or MZIs (e.g.,   [ref]14) or both (e.g., [ref]18, ). The analog VDPCs can be further classified as incoherent (e.g.,  [ref]12 ) or coherent (e.g.,      ). To set and update the values of the individual input and kernel tensors used for vector dot product operations, the incoherent VDPCs utilize the analog optical signal power, whereas the coherent VDPCs utilize the electrical field amplitude and phase. The coherent VDPCs achieve low inference latency, but they suffer from control complexity, high area overhead, low scalability, low flexibility, high encoding noise, and phase error accumulation issues . In contrast, the MRRs-enabled incoherent VDPCs based accelerators achieve better scalability and lower footprint, because they use PICs that are based on compact MRRs , unlike the coherent VDPCs that use PICs based on bulky MZIs. Various state-of-the-art PIC-based optical CNN accelerators are well discussed in a survey paper . Because of the inherent advantages of MRR-enabled incoherent VDPCs, there is impetus to design more energy-efficient and scalable CNN accelerators employing MRR-enabled incohorent VDPCs."
