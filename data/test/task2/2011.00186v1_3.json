    "iv-d1 nas results on nasbench-101": "The comparison of different algorithms is illustrated in Fig. 7, and we also demonstrate the quantitative comparison of algorithms in Table I. As illustrated in Fig. 7, the performance of NPENAS-SSCCL is slightly better than NPENAS-SSRL, and NPENAS-NP achieves the best performance. The proposed position-aware path-based encoding is an efficient and effective encoding scheme. The performance of BANANAS [ref]3 with position-aware path-based encoding is better than BANANAS with the path-based encoding. We utilize the position-aware path-based encoding to filter out the isomorphic graphs, while NPENAS employs the path-based encoding to filter out isomorphic graphs. Due to this difference, the performance of NPENAS-NP shown in Table I improves from 5.86%percent5.865.86\\% to 5.83%percent5.835.83\\%.\nTable I also shows our proposed self-supervised pre-trained neural predictors using a small search budget performs better than the unsupervised arch2vec.

As shown in Table I, the performance of NPENAS-NP has a large drop after switching to the fixed version, while NPENAS-SSRL and NPENAS-SSCCL only have a slight drop. We compare the performance of NPENAS-SSRL and NPENAS-SSCCL under differ search budget, and the results are shown in Table II. The performance of NPENAS-SSRL continuously increases with the increase of the search budget, while the NPENAS-SSCCL only using 80 neural architectures to achieve its best performance. From the above findings, the neural predictor SS-CCL is better than SS-RL when applying to the NPENAS.
