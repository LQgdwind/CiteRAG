    "introduction": "Since its very beginning, the area of combinatorial group theory  is tightly connected to algorithmic questions.\nThe word problem for finitely generated (f.g. for short) groups lies at\nthe heart of theoretical computer science itself. Dehn  proved its decidability for certain surface groups (before the notion of decidability\nwas formalized). Magnus  extended this result to all one-relator groups.\nAfter the work of Magnus it took more than 20 years before Novikov  and Boone\n proved the existence of finitely presented groups with\nan undecidable word problem (Turing tried to prove the existence of such groups but could only provide finitely presented cancellative monoids\nwith an undecidable word problem). Since the above mentioned pioneering work, the area of algorithmic group theory has been extended in many different directions. More\ngeneral algorithmic problems have been studied and also the computational complexity of group theoretic problems has been investigated.\nIn this paper, we focus on the decidability/complexity of two specific problems in group theory that have received considerable attention in recent years:\nthe knapsack problem and the power word problem. There exist several variants of the classical knapsack problem over the integers .\nIn the variant that is particularly relevant for this paper, it is asked whether a linear equation\nx1⋅a1+⋯+xd⋅ad=b⋅subscript𝑥1subscript𝑎1⋯⋅subscript𝑥𝑑subscript𝑎𝑑𝑏x_{1}\\cdot a_{1}+\\cdots+x_{d}\\cdot a_{d}=b, with a1,…,ad,b∈ℤsubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑑𝑏ℤa_{1},\\ldots,a_{d},b\\in\\mathbb{Z}, has a solution (x1,…,xk)∈ℕdsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑘superscriptℕ𝑑(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{k})\\in\\mathbb{N}^{d}.\nA proof for the 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-completeness of this problem for binary encoded integers a1,…,ad,bsubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑑𝑏a_{1},\\ldots,a_{d},b can be found in\n. In contrast, if the numbers ai,bsubscript𝑎𝑖𝑏a_{i},b are given in unary notation then the problem falls down into the circuit\ncomplexity class 𝖳𝖢0superscript𝖳𝖢0\\mathsf{TC}^{0} . In the course of a\nsystematic investigation of classical commutative discrete optimization problems\nin non-commutative group theory, Myasnikov, Nikolaev, and Ushakov  generalized the above definition of knapsack\nto any f.g. group G𝐺G: The input for the knapsack problem for G𝐺G (Knapsack​(G)Knapsack𝐺\\textsc{Knapsack}(G) for short) is an equation of the form g1x1​⋯​gdxd=hsuperscriptsubscript𝑔1subscript𝑥1⋯superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑑subscript𝑥𝑑ℎg_{1}^{x_{1}}\\cdots g_{d}^{x_{d}}=h\nfor group elements g1,…,gd,h∈Gsubscript𝑔1…subscript𝑔𝑑ℎ𝐺g_{1},\\ldots,g_{d},h\\in G (specified\nby finite words over the generators of G𝐺G) and pairwise different variables x1,…,xdsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑑x_{1},\\ldots,x_{d} that take values in ℕℕ\\mathbb{N}\nand it is asked whether this equation has a solution\n(in the main part of the paper, we formulate this problem in a slightly more\ngeneral but equivalent way). In this form, Knapsack​(ℤ)Knapsackℤ\\textsc{Knapsack}(\\mathbb{Z}) is exactly the above knapsack problem for unary encoded\nintegers studied in  (a unary encoded integer can be viewed as a word over a generating set\n{t,t−1}𝑡superscript𝑡1\\{t,t^{-1}\\} of ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}). For the case where g1,…,gd,hsubscript𝑔1…subscript𝑔𝑑ℎg_{1},\\ldots,g_{d},h are commuting matrices over an algebraic number field,\nthe knapsack problem has been studied in .\nLet us emphasize that we are looking for solutions of knapsack equations in the natural numbers.\nOne might also consider the variant, where the variables x1,…,xdsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑑x_{1},\\ldots,x_{d} take values in ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}.\nThis latter version can be easily reduced to our knapsack version (with solutions in ℕℕ\\mathbb{N}),\nbut we are not aware of a reduction in the opposite direction.111Note that the problem whether a given system of linear equations\nhas a solution in ℕℕ\\mathbb{N} is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-complete, whereas the problem can be solved in polynomial time (using the Smith normal form) if we ask\nfor a solution in ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}. In other words, if we consider the knapsack problem for ℤnsuperscriptℤ𝑛\\mathbb{Z}^{n} with n𝑛n part of the input, then looking for solutions\nin ℕℕ\\mathbb{N} seems to be more difficult than looking for solutions in ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}.\nLet us also mention that the knapsack problem is a special case of the more general rational subset membership problem 3. We also consider a generalization of Knapsack​(G)Knapsack𝐺\\textsc{Knapsack}(G): An exponent equation is an equation of the form\ng1x1​⋯​gdxd=hsuperscriptsubscript𝑔1subscript𝑥1⋯superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑑subscript𝑥𝑑ℎg_{1}^{x_{1}}\\cdots g_{d}^{x_{d}}=h as in the specification of Knapsack​(G)Knapsack𝐺\\textsc{Knapsack}(G), except that the variables x1,…,xdsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑑x_{1},\\ldots,x_{d}\nare not required to be pairwise different.\nSolvability of exponent equations for G𝐺G (ExpEq​(G)ExpEq𝐺\\textsc{ExpEq}(G) for short) is the problem\nwhere the input is a conjunction of exponent equations (possibly with shared variables) and the question is whether there is a joint\nsolution for these equations in the natural numbers. Let us give a brief survey over the results that were obtained for the knapsack problem in  and successive papers: Knapsack can be solved in polynomial\ntime for every hyperbolic group . Some extensions of this result can be found\nin 1 . There are nilpotent groups of class 222 for which knapsack is undecidable. Examples\nare direct products of sufficiently many copies of the discrete Heisenberg group H3​(ℤ)subscript𝐻3ℤH_{3}(\\mathbb{Z}) ,\nand free nilpotent groups of class 222 and sufficiently high rank . In contrast,\nknapsack for H3​(ℤ)subscript𝐻3ℤH_{3}(\\mathbb{Z}) is decidable . It follows that decidability\nof knapsack is not preserved under direct products. Knapsack is decidable for every co-context-free group , i.e., groups where the set of all words over the generators that do not represent the identity\nis a context-free language. Lehnert and Schweitzer  have shown that the Higman-Thompson groups are\nco-context-free. Knapsack belongs to 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP} for all virtually special groups (finite extensions of subgroups\nof graph groups) . The class of virtually special groups is very rich. It contains all Coxeter groups,\none-relator groups with torsion, fully residually free groups, and fundamental groups of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.\nFor graph groups (also known as right-angled Artin groups) a complete classification of the complexity\nof knapsack was obtained in : If the underlying graph contains an induced path or cycle on 4 nodes, then knapsack\nis 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-complete; in all other cases knapsack can be solved in polynomial time (even in LogCFL). Knapsack is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-complete for every wreath products A≀ℤ≀𝐴ℤA\\wr\\mathbb{Z} with A≠1𝐴1A\\neq 1 f.g. abelian 2\n(wreath products are formally defined in Section 3.2). Decidability of knapsack is preserved under finite extensions, HNN-extensions over finite associated subgroups\nand amalgamated free products over finite subgroups . For a knapsack equation g1x1​⋯​gdxd=hsuperscriptsubscript𝑔1subscript𝑥1⋯superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑑subscript𝑥𝑑ℎg_{1}^{x_{1}}\\cdots g_{d}^{x_{d}}=h we may consider the set of all solutions\n{(n1,…,nd)∈ℕd∣g1n1​⋯​gdnd=g​ in ​G}conditional-setsubscript𝑛1…subscript𝑛𝑑superscriptℕ𝑑superscriptsubscript𝑔1subscript𝑛1⋯superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑑subscript𝑛𝑑𝑔 in 𝐺\\{(n_{1},\\ldots,n_{d})\\in\\mathbb{N}^{d}\\mid g_{1}^{n_{1}}\\cdots g_{d}^{n_{d}}=g\\text{ in }G\\}. In the papers\n   it turned out that in many groups the solution\nset of every knapsack equation is a semilinear set (see Section 2 for a definition).\nWe say that a group is knapsack-semilinear if for every knapsack equation the set of all solutions is semilinear\nand a semilinear representation can be computed effectively (the same holds then also for exponent equations).\nNote that in any group G𝐺G the set of solutions on an equation gx=hsuperscript𝑔𝑥ℎg^{x}=h is periodic and hence semilinear.\nThis result generalizes to solution sets of knapsack instances of the for g1x​g2y=hsuperscriptsubscript𝑔1𝑥superscriptsubscript𝑔2𝑦ℎg_{1}^{x}g_{2}^{y}=h (see Lemma 3.9), but there\nare examples of knapsack instances with three variables where solutions sets (in certain groups) are not semilinear.\nExamples of knapsack-semilinear groups are graph groups  (which include free groups and free abelian groups),\nhyperbolic groups , and co-context free groups\n.222Knapsack-semilinearity of co-context free groups is not stated in\n but follows immediately from the proof for the decidability of knapsack.\nMoreover, the class of knapsack-semilinear groups is closed under finite extensions, graph products,\namalgamated free products with finite amalgamated subgroups, HNN-extensions with finite associated subgroups\n(see 0 for these closure properties)\nand wreath products 2. In the power word problems for a f.g. group G𝐺G (PowerWP​(G)PowerWP𝐺\\textsc{PowerWP}(G) for short)\nthe input consists of an expression u1n1​u2n2​⋯​udndsuperscriptsubscript𝑢1subscript𝑛1superscriptsubscript𝑢2subscript𝑛2⋯superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑑subscript𝑛𝑑u_{1}^{n_{1}}u_{2}^{n_{2}}\\cdots u_{d}^{n_{d}},\nwhere u1,…,udsubscript𝑢1…subscript𝑢𝑑u_{1},\\ldots,u_{d} are words over the group generators and n1,…,ndsubscript𝑛1…subscript𝑛𝑑n_{1},\\ldots,n_{d} are binary encoded integers. The power word problem\narises very natural in the context of the knapsack problem: it allows to verify a proposed solution for a knapsack equation with binary encoded numbers.\nThe power word problem has been first studied in , where it was shown that the power word problem for f.g. free groups has the same complexity as the word problem and hence can be solved in logarithmic space. Other groups with easy power word problems are f.g. nilpotent groups and wreath products A≀ℤ≀𝐴ℤA\\wr\\mathbb{Z} with A𝐴A f.g. abelian . In contrast it is shown in \nthat the power word problem for wreath products G≀ℤ≀𝐺ℤG\\wr\\mathbb{Z}, where G𝐺G is either finite non-solvable or f.g. free, is 𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{coNP}-complete.\nImplicitly, the power word problem appeared also in the work of Ge 3, where it was shown that one can verify in polynomial time an identity\nα1n1​α2n2​⋯​αdnd=1superscriptsubscript𝛼1subscript𝑛1superscriptsubscript𝛼2subscript𝑛2⋯superscriptsubscript𝛼𝑑subscript𝑛𝑑1\\alpha_{1}^{n_{1}}\\alpha_{2}^{n_{2}}\\cdots\\alpha_{d}^{n_{d}}=1, where the αisubscript𝛼𝑖\\alpha_{i} are elements of an algebraic\nnumber field and the nisubscript𝑛𝑖n_{i} are binary encoded integers. Let us also remark that the power word problem is a special case of the compressed\nword problem , which asks whether a grammar-compressed word over the group generators evaluates to the group identity. In this paper, we are mainly interested in the problems PowerWP​(G)PowerWP𝐺\\textsc{PowerWP}(G), Knapsack​(G)Knapsack𝐺\\textsc{Knapsack}(G) and ExpEq​(G)ExpEq𝐺\\textsc{ExpEq}(G) for the case where\nG𝐺G is a wreath product.\nWe start with the following result: Let G𝐺G be a f.g. nilpotent group. Then PowerWP​(G≀ℤ)PowerWP≀𝐺ℤ\\textsc{PowerWP}(G\\wr\\mathbb{Z}) is in 𝖳𝖢0superscript𝖳𝖢0\\mathsf{TC}^{0}. Theorem 1.1 generalizes the above mentioned result from \n(for G𝐺G abelian) in a nontrivial way. Our proof analyzes periodic infinite words over a nilpotent group G𝐺G. Roughly speaking, we show that one can check in 𝖳𝖢0superscript𝖳𝖢0\\mathsf{TC}^{0},\nwhether a given list of such period infinite words pointwise multiplies to the identity of G𝐺G. We believe that this is a result of independent\ninterest. We use this result also in the proof of the following theorem: Let G𝐺G be a finite nontrivial nilpotent group. Then Knapsack​(G≀ℤ)Knapsack≀𝐺ℤ\\textsc{Knapsack}(G\\wr\\mathbb{Z}) is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-complete. Next, we consider iterated wreath products.\nFix a number r≥1𝑟1r\\geq 1 and let us define the iterated wreath products\nW0,r=ℤrsubscript𝑊0𝑟superscriptℤ𝑟W_{0,r}=\\mathbb{Z}^{r} and Wm+1,r=ℤr≀Wm,rsubscript𝑊𝑚1𝑟≀superscriptℤ𝑟subscript𝑊𝑚𝑟W_{m+1,r}=\\mathbb{Z}^{r}\\wr W_{m,r}.\nBy a famous result of Magnus  the free solvable group Sm,rsubscript𝑆𝑚𝑟S_{m,r} of derived length r𝑟r and rank m𝑚m\nembeds into Wm,rsubscript𝑊𝑚𝑟W_{m,r}. Our main results for these groups are: PowerWP​(Wm,r)PowerWPsubscript𝑊𝑚𝑟\\textsc{PowerWP}(W_{m,r}) and hence PowerWP​(Sm,r)PowerWPsubscript𝑆𝑚𝑟\\textsc{PowerWP}(S_{m,r}) belong to 𝖳𝖢0superscript𝖳𝖢0\\mathsf{TC}^{0} for all m≥0𝑚0m\\geq 0, r≥1𝑟1r\\geq 1. It was only recently shown in  that the word problem\n(as well as the conjugacy problem) for every\nfree solvable group belongs to 𝖳𝖢0superscript𝖳𝖢0\\mathsf{TC}^{0}. Theorem 1.3 generalizes this result\n(at least the part on the word problem). ExpEq​(Wm,r)ExpEqsubscript𝑊𝑚𝑟\\textsc{ExpEq}(W_{m,r}) and hence ExpEq​(Sm,r)ExpEqsubscript𝑆𝑚𝑟\\textsc{ExpEq}(S_{m,r}) are 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-complete for all m≥0𝑚0m\\geq 0, r≥1𝑟1r\\geq 1. For the proof of Theorem 1.4 we show that if a given knapsack equation over\nWm,rsubscript𝑊𝑚𝑟W_{m,r} has a solution then it has a solution where all numbers are exponentially bounded in the length of the knapsack instance.\nTheorem 1.4 then follows easily from Theorem 1.3.\nFor some other algorithmic results for free solvable groups see . Finally, we prove a new hardness results for the power word problem and knapsack problem.\nFor this we make use so-called uniformly strongly efficiently non-solvable groups (uniformly SENS groups) that were recently defined\nin . Roughly speaking, a group G𝐺G is uniformly\nSENS if there exists nontrivial nested commutators of arbitrary depth that moreover, are efficiently computable in a certain sense\n(see Section 6.1 for the precise definition). The essence of these groups is that they allow to carry out Barrington’s argument showing the 𝖭𝖢1superscript𝖭𝖢1\\mathsf{NC}^{1}-hardness of the word problem for a finite solvable group .\nWe prove the following: Let the f.g. group G=⟨Σ⟩𝐺delimited-⟨⟩ΣG=\\langle\\Sigma\\rangle be uniformly SENS. Then, PowerWP​(G≀ℤ)PowerWP≀𝐺ℤ\\textsc{PowerWP}(G\\wr\\mathbb{Z}) is 𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{coNP}-hard. This result generalizes a result from  saying that PowerWP​(G≀ℤ)PowerWP≀𝐺ℤ\\textsc{PowerWP}(G\\wr\\mathbb{Z}) is 𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{coNP}-hard for the case that G𝐺G\nis f.g. free or finite non-solvable. Let the f.g. group G=⟨Σ⟩𝐺delimited-⟨⟩ΣG=\\langle\\Sigma\\rangle be uniformly SENS. Then, Knapsack​(G≀ℤ)Knapsack≀𝐺ℤ\\textsc{Knapsack}(G\\wr\\mathbb{Z}) is Σ2psubscriptsuperscriptΣ𝑝2\\Sigma^{p}_{2}-hard. Recall that for every nontrivial group G𝐺G, Knapsack​(G≀ℤ)Knapsack≀𝐺ℤ\\textsc{Knapsack}(G\\wr\\mathbb{Z}) is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard 2. In the main part we also state several corollaries of Theorem 1.5 and 1.6.\nFor instance, we show that for the famous Thompson’s group F𝐹F, PowerWP​(F)PowerWP𝐹\\textsc{PowerWP}(F) is 𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{coNP}-complete and\nKnapsack​(F)Knapsack𝐹\\textsc{Knapsack}(F) is Σ2psubscriptsuperscriptΣ𝑝2\\Sigma^{p}_{2}-hard."
