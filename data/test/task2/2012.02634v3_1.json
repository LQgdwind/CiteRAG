    "state of the art": "The topology of superlevel sets of a function has been a widespread subject of study in different mathematical communities. In the probability theory community, the introduction of trees has key in the understanding of connected components of superlevel sets of random functions on   [ref]1    . This approach allows us to define trees associated to (arbitrarily irregular, but continuous) functions. More recently, so-called merge trees have made their apparition amongst the topological data analysis (TDA) commmunity (cf. the books by Chazal et al. [ref]13 and Oudot’s book  for an introduction to TDA). As in the probabilistic case, these merge trees carry important information about the connected components of superlevel sets and moreover about the persistence diagram of a function f𝑓f defined on a compact space X𝑋X     , which is now required to be a Morse function (an explicit construction and correspondence between trees and barcodes can be found in ). The construction of these trees are different between both communities: the approach of the probabilists is analytic  , whereas the merge trees can be seen as an algebraic construction   . Since these trees capture essentially the same information about the connected components of superlevel sets, one can ask whether both constructions coincide where their regimes of validity intersect. We will show in this paper that they do and that it is possible to retrieve the H0subscript𝐻0H_{0}-persistence diagram of f𝑓f from the constructed tree (constructed from through the probabilistic approach). Parallel to this development, Wasserstein p𝑝p distances on the space of diagrams (denoted dpsubscript𝑑𝑝d_{p}) [29, Chapter VIII.2] have been widely used and studied by the TDA community in different contexts     . Recently, Wasserstein distances have been formalized through the use of optimal partial transport by Divol and Lacombe . In this approach, we look at persistence diagrams as measures, a point of view which had been previously been introduced  [ref]13 and has proved fruitful independently from these considerations. The framework introduced by Divol and Lacombe extends the notion of Wasserstein p𝑝p distance previously defined on persistence diagrams to arbitrary Radon measures on the upper-half plane 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} where persistence diagrams are defined. The extension to all Radon measures comes with certain advantages, such as having an easily definable and computable notion of “average diagram”, defined by duality. This notion was originally introduced by Chazal and Divol in [ref]14 as follows. If f𝑓f is a random function, seeing Dgm⁡(f)Dgm𝑓\\operatorname{Dgm}(f) as a measure, it is possible to define the average diagram of the process by duality in the following way. For every measurable set B⊂𝒳𝐵𝒳B\\subset\\mathcal{X}, From the definition, 𝔼​[Dgm⁡(f)]𝔼delimited-[]Dgm𝑓\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\operatorname{Dgm}(f)\\right] encodes every linear functional of the diagram and is easily computed, motivating its introduction. Note this definition contrasts the Fréchet means approach of other authors (e.g. Turner et al. ), which is non-linear, depends on p𝑝p and requires a proof of existence and unicity, but does not require the extension of the space of persistence diagrams to the space of arbitrary measures on 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}. This dual approach of Chazal and Divol inscribes itself in a more general interest in the persistence diagrams of stochastic processes, which have been studied by a wide variety of authors, for instance    [ref]14   9  [ref]1. Some of the previously cited results discuss different aspects of random field persistence theory, which include, but are not limited to computations for canonical processes  9, stability of certain linear functionals with respect to the bottleneck distance , the Euler characteristic , random complexes  and notions of central tendency [ref]14 . Given the widespread use of Wasserstein p𝑝p distances, it is important to understand whether this notion is continuous (and the nature of this continuity) with respect to perturbations at the level of the filtrating functions on the space X𝑋X. This so-called “Wasserstein stability” of persistence diagrams of functions f:X→ℝ:𝑓→𝑋ℝf:X\\to\\mathbb{R} has been widely discussed by the TDA community, in the context where the space X𝑋X is triangulable. There are many results in this direction   , valid with different degrees of generality, covering both X𝑋X compact   and X𝑋X non-compact , but mainly focusing mainly on Lipschitz functions (note, however, that the work of Chen and Edelsbrunner  does not require the Lipschitz condition). The first result in this direction was obtained by Cohen-Steiner et al.  and depends on the following restriction on X𝑋X. \nA (triangulable) metric space X𝑋X implies bounded q𝑞q-total persistence if, for all k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N}, there exists a constant CXsubscript𝐶𝑋C_{X} that depends only on X𝑋X such that for every tame function f𝑓f with Lipschitz constant Lip⁡(f)≤1Lip𝑓1\\operatorname{Lip}(f)\\leq 1. The PerspsubscriptPers𝑝\\operatorname{Pers}_{p}-functional of the definition above is the usual p𝑝p-persistence used in TDA (a non-exhaustive list of uses of this functional includes     ), defined as the ℓpsuperscriptℓ𝑝\\ell^{p}-norm of the length of the bars of the barcode of f𝑓f.\nThe results obtained thereafter rely heavily on this condition, which is not rendered quantitative (in particular, given X𝑋X, no upper bound for CXsubscript𝐶𝑋C_{X} or lower bound for q𝑞q were known in general). Nonetheless, this condition allowed the authors to show Wasserstein stability, Let X𝑋X be a triangulable space implying bounded q𝑞q-total persistence and let f𝑓f and g𝑔g be two ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}-valued Lipschitz functions on X𝑋X. Then, for all p>q𝑝𝑞p>q, we have where Lip⁡(f)Lip𝑓\\operatorname{Lip}(f) denotes the Lipschitz constant of f𝑓f. Further results in this direction, such as , also rely on the bounded q𝑞q-total persistence condition, but give bounds lower bounds on admissible q𝑞q, finding that q≥d𝑞𝑑q\\geq d, where d𝑑d is the maximal dimension of simplices in the triangulation of X𝑋X. It is also known that, for distance functions to point clouds in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, q=d𝑞𝑑q=d. We will later see that the lower bound for the validity of Wasserstein stability is closely related to a different question regarding the link between the so-called homological dimensions of X𝑋X and the upper-box dimension of X𝑋X, which we will denote dim¯⁡(X)¯dim𝑋\\operatorname{\\overline{dim}}(X) (analogously, we will denote dim¯⁡(X)¯dim𝑋\\operatorname{\\underline{dim}}(X) the lower-box dimension). To the best knowledge of the author, although Yuliy Baryshnikov and Shmuel Weinberger had previously obtained results in this direction (but never published them), this question was first opened and studied by Schweinhart and MacPherson 1 and later studied in more detail by Schweinhart in , but has also been addressed by other authors (cf. [ref]1 and the references therein). Let X𝑋X be a bounded subset of a metric space. The PHksubscriptPH𝑘\\operatorname{PH}_{k}-dimension of X𝑋X is where the supremum is taken over all finite sets of points 𝐱𝐱{\\bf{x}} of X𝑋X. There are open problems stated in Schweinhart’s paper regarding the relation between these notions of dimension and dim¯⁡(X)¯dim𝑋\\operatorname{\\overline{dim}}(X), some of which we will give a partial answer to in this paper. As we will later see, it is suitable to tweak this definition slightly."
