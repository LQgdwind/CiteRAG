  "sections": {
    "introduction": "Scientists have hypothesized that the brain, specifically the neocortex, acquires and updates internal representations\nby invoking learning mechanisms designed to predict incoming sensory\ninput.\nThese predictions are compared with actual sensory input to calculate discrepancies\nbetween input and predictions.\nThese discrepancies,\nknown as prediction errors,\n   9 guide learning in the higher layers to reduce future\nprediction errors. Although many forms of predictive coding have been proposed and found to exist in the brain\n, in regard to the neocortex,\nthere are two main approaches toward building neural architectures for hierarchical predictive coding.\nThe first,\nexemplified by the references cited above, uses a generative Bayesian approach,\nand is called\nBayesian predictive coding .\nIn this approach,\nthe higher layers learn to reconstruct the outputs of the immediately lower layers.\nThus the higher layers, although represented more abstractly, contain the same information\nrepresented in the lower layers.\nThe second approach,\nexemplified by the work of 4\nand  ,\nuses the higher layers to predict the prediction error in the immediately lower layer.\nThis knowledge about the prediction error is used to modify the lower layer representation to reduce\nfuture prediction errors.\nThe acquired representations are presumed to learn spatially and temporally immediate and distant\ncauses or modulations of\nthe input and this gives the representations their ability to predict future inputs.\n Predictive coding models inspired by neocortex invariably use feedback from higher layers to\nlower layers.\nState-of-the-art deep learning models found in applied artificial intelligence\nrarely use feedback connections in their calculations.\nBoth fully connected and convolutional deep networks are purely feedforward (what about semantic\nsegmentation?).\nRecurrent networks, including gated recurrent networks, have lateral connections but not\nfeedback connections 0 but not feedback connections across layers.\nThe models in the deep learning literature which do have feedback connections are actually types\nof predictive coding models 4  3. Feedback connections are ubiquitous in the neocortex.\nVirtually every feedforward connection from one cortical area to another is accompanied\nby a separate feedback connections linking those areas 4.\nBoth the feedforward connections and feedback connections consume significant brain volume\nand would not exist without an important functional reason.\nPredictive coding models, both\nBayesian and non-Bayesian, offer attractive hypotheses for shedding light on the\nthe computational purpose of feedback connections,\nas well as potentially offering significant improvements in deep learning performance. As already mentioned,\nthis type of learning has been called predictive coding,\nor more recently predictive processing [ref]9 7,\nand is usually described using a Bayesian generative model 1\nwhere sensory input is combined with prior expectations, to make better future predictions.\nThe term “predictive coding”\npredates Bayesian predictive coding.\nNon-Bayesian predictive coding has been used for other functions such as\nreducing information transmission requirements and cancelling the effects of\nself-generated actions . Predictive coding can be usefully viewed as a type of representation learning .\nThe learning mechanisms to support Bayesian predictive coding should\nimprove the quality of internal representations as a\nside effect of reducing future prediction errors.\nThe predictive/reconstructive capacity ensures that the acquired representations can\nfully represent information contained in the input.\nSince learning is driven by prediction errors, the learning is unsupervised and simply\nrequires a data stream of information to be predicted.\n has noted that good representations are effective because\nthey, in part, capture\nunderlying “explanatory factors of variation behind the data”,\nand Bayesian predictive coding shares this goal. In regard to applications,\npredictive coding networks can be used for learning overlapping image components ,\nobject classification   3,\nvideo prediction 4,\nvideo anomaly detection 6,\nmodeling biased competition ,\nresponse properties of primate visual cortex  ,\nand EEG evoked brain responses  health concerns7 1.\nIt has also been proposed as a unified theory of neocortical function\n8  7. Its use in deep learning to build large models has so far been limited,\nwith the models of 4, , and 3 being perhaps the only examples.\nMost predictive coding models have been implemented prior to the emergence of deep learning\nframeworks   ,\nso these classical models are small and do not use\nadvanced modules for temporal processing, such as gated recurrent networks 2,\nnow found\nin deep learning frameworks. This survey explains some early predictive coding models and considers the question\nof enhancing them by using modern deep learning tools.\nWe analyze the reasons for their effectiveness and offer proposals for future research.\nWe also introduce a template for module connectivity which we call the Rao-Ballard protocol.\nWe suggest that it can be used as a rubric to assess the fidelity of deep learning models that claim to implement\npredictive coding."
