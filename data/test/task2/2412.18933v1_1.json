  "title": "TINQ: Temporal Inconsistency Guided Blind Video Quality Assessment",
  "sections": {
    "experimental setups": "Benchmark Datasets. We validate TINQ on both super-resolution and user-generated content distortions. For super-resolution, we employ VSR-QAD [ref]48, the only public SR VQA dataset, containing 120 reference videos downsampled by factors of ×2absent2\\times 2, ×4absent4\\times 4, and ×8absent8\\times 8, and upscaled by 10 SR algorithms, resulting in 2,260 videos after outlier filtering. For real world distortions, we use KoNViD-1K 7 (1,200 UGC videos) and LIVE-VQC [ref]33 (585 UGC videos with over 205,000 opinion scores). Competing Methods. For the SR scenario, we evaluate full-reference (FR) methods (PSNR, SSIM , VIF , VMAF , SRIF ), reduced-reference (RR) methods (SpEED-QA , IGTS , DISQ , DR-IQA , STF , VSR-QAD), and no-reference (NR) methods (DeepSRQ , VIDEVAL , VSFA , GSTVQA , STI-VQA 1, 2Bi-VQA , MBVQA ). Among them, SRIF, IGTS, DISQ, STF, DeepSRQ are SR IQA methods, and VSR-QAD is the first SR VQA method. For natural distortions, we use VSFA, TLVQM 9, VIDEVAL, VISION , SimpleVQA , VIQE , 2Bi-VQA, STFR, and MBVQA. Performance Criteria. We evaluate performance using Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (SRCC), Kendall rank-order correlation coefficient (KRCC), Pearson linear correlation coefficient (PLCC), and root mean square error (RMSE). For VSR-QAD, we follow its protocols: randomly splitting videos into 70%percent7070\\% training, 10%percent1010\\% validation, and 20%percent2020\\% testing. VSFA, 2Bi-VQA, and MBVQA are retrained, with other results cited from VSR-QAD. For UGC datasets, we split them into 60%percent6060\\% training, 20%percent2020\\% validation, and 20%percent2020\\% testing, repeating the process 10 times and reporting median results. Implementation Details. Models were trained for 100 epochs on an NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti with PyTorch 1.7.1.\nTemporal inconsistency videos guided both spatial and temporal modules during training, and were removed during testing. The Adam optimizer was used with an initial learning rate of 10−5superscript10510^{-5}, decaying by 0.8 every 10 epochs. Batch size was 16, with no weight decay. The loss combined SRCC and MSE to leverage both ranking and regression."
