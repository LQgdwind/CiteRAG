    "introduction": "A variety of applications, including 3D reconstruction, tracking, pose estimation, and object detection, invoke 3D registration as part of their operation   . To maximize the accuracy and speed of 3D registration, researchers have developed geometric feature descriptors  [ref]11 [ref]41 , pose optimization algorithms  [ref]45  0, and end-to-end feature learning and registration pipelines [ref]41 . In particular, recent end-to-end registration networks have proven to be effective in relation to classical pipelines.\nHowever, these end-to-end approaches have some drawbacks that limit their accuracy and applicability.\nFor example, PointNetLK  uses globally pooled features to encode the entire geometry of a point cloud, which decreases spatial acuity and registration accuracy.\nDeep closest point [ref]41 makes strong assumptions on the distribution of points and correspondences, which do not hold for partially overlapping 3D scans. In this work, we propose three modules for robust and accurate registration that resolve these drawbacks: a 6-dimensional convolutional network for correspondence confidence estimation, a differentiable Weighted Procrustes method for scalable registration, and a robust SE​(3)SE3\\text{SE}(3) optimizer for fine-tuning the final alignment. The first component is a 6-dimensional convolutional network that analyzes the geometry of 3D correspondences and estimates their accuracy.\nOur approach is inspired by a number of learning-based methods for estimating the validity of correspondences in 2D   and 3D .\nThese methods stack coordinates of correspondence pairs, forming a vector [𝐱;𝐲]∈ℝ2×D𝐱𝐲superscriptℝ2𝐷[\\mathbf{x};\\mathbf{y}]\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2\\times D} for each correspondence 𝐱,𝐲∈ℝD𝐱𝐲superscriptℝ𝐷\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D}.\nPrior methods treat these 2×D2𝐷2\\times D-dimensional vectors as a set, and apply global set processing models for analysis. Such models largely disregard local geometric structure. Yet the correspondences are embedded in a metric space (ℝ2×Dsuperscriptℝ2𝐷\\mathbb{R}^{2\\times D}) that induces distances and neighborhood relationships.\nIn particular, 3D correspondences form a geometric structure in 6-dimensional space  and we use a high-dimensional convolutional network to analyze the 6D structure formed by correspondences and estimate the likelihood that a given correspondence is correct (i.e., an inlier). The second component we develop is a differentiable Weighted Procrustes solver. The Procrustes method  provides a closed-form solution for rigid registration in SE​(3)SE3\\text{SE}(3). A differentiable version of the Procrustes method by Wang et al. [ref]41 has been used for end-to-end registration.\nHowever, the differentiable Procrustes method passes gradients through coordinates, which requires O​(N2)𝑂superscript𝑁2O(N^{2}) time and memory for N𝑁N keypoints, limiting the number of keypoints that can be processed by the network.\nWe use the inlier probabilities predicted by our first module (the 6D convolutional network) to guide the Procrustes method, thus forming a differentiable Weighted Procrustes method. This method passes gradients through the weights associated with correspondences rather than correspondence coordinates.\nThe computational complexity of the Weighted Procrustes method is linear in the number of correspondences, allowing the registration pipeline to use dense correspondence sets rather than sparse keypoints. This substantially increases registration accuracy. Our third component is a robust optimization module that fine-tunes the alignment produced by the Weighted Procrustes solver.\nThis optimization module minimizes a differentiable loss via gradient descent on the continuous SE​(3)SE3\\text{SE}(3) representation space 2.\nThe optimization is fast since it does not require neighbor search in the inner loop . Experimentally,\nwe validate the presented modules on a real-world pairwise registration benchmark  and large-scale scene reconstruction datasets   .\nWe show that our modules are robust, accurate, and fast in comparison to both classical global registration algorithms 0  [ref]45 and recent end-to-end approaches  [ref]41 .\nAll training and experiment scripts are available at https://github.com/chrischoy/DeepGlobalRegistration."
