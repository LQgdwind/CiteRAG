    "comparison with baseline methods": "In this section, we report the experimental results of the proposed framework, named GLAN (Graph-based Linear Assignment Network), compared with six state-of-the-art baselines, SH¬†, SD¬†[ref]14, RM¬†, DLASP¬†, BDL¬†, and DHN¬† of which the first three algorithms are traditional learning-free methods and the last three are deep learning approaches. In Tables¬†1 and¬†2, two versions of DLASP¬† are involved in comparison, named DFC and DCNN which are build upon Fully-Connection (FC) layers and CNNs¬† respectively. To evaluate the performance of these methods, we apply Greedy discretization to the solution matrices predicted by these approaches, and define the assignment precision criteria as where t‚Äãr‚Äã(‚ãÖ)ùë°ùëü‚ãÖtr(\\cdot) returns the trace of given matrix. In addition, in order to fairly compare our method with baselines in terms of computation efficiency, all the methods are run on PC with a Intel Core i5-4590 CPU (3.30 GHz), a RAM (16GB) and a GTX 1060Ti GPU (6G). The average precision of each tested algorithm is illustrated in Table¬†1. In addition, Table¬†2 reports the comparisons in terms of computational time. In non-learnable approaches, adopting simple normalization along row and column, SinkHorn¬† can not obtain satisfactory assignment precision, despite of its relative fast inference process. As a variant of SinkHorn¬† with entropic penalization, SD¬†[ref]14 runs with the lowest time cost, and significantly outperforms SinkHorn¬† in assignment precision. However, their performance on assignment precision often deteriorates when the size of problems increases. The RM¬† algorithm employs an elaborate reasoning process to update the solution iteratively and achieves the best assignment precision among the learning-free baselines. However, its computation time grows greatly with the increase of the problem size.\nIn learning-based methods, DFC¬† passes the sub-classification tasks generated from the cost matrix to several FC layers to make decisions for linear assignment problems. Its computational complexity is the lowest than other learning-based methods, but it gets the worst assignment precision. Similar to the DFC¬†, decomposing the linear assignment problem into a sequence of smaller sub-assignment tasks, the RNN-based model BDL¬† achieves a better performance on assignment precision due to its adaptation to problems of varying sizes. However, the relationships between sub-assignment tasks are not taken into account in both of their frameworks. Employing several stacked CNN layers, DCNN¬† also achieves a better performance than the FC-based version of DLASP¬†, i.e., DFC. However, due to the limited receptive field of convolution kennels, it can not makes assignment decisions through global information when the size of the problem is greater than its receptive field. To receive information from the global scope, another RNN-based model, named DHN¬†, transforms the cost matrix into two sequential patterns from column-wise and row-wise respectively to make assignment decisions. The performance of DHN¬† outperforms all the other previous baselines on assignment precision. But same as the RM¬†, the computational time of DHN¬† is also sensitive to the problem size. Devoting to learning the inductive representations and relational structures, that help to make the decisions for linear assignment problems, our graph network achieves the best assignment precisions in general as shown in Table¬†1. Specifically, the average assignment precision of the proposed method superiors the one of DHN¬† by 10.08%percent10.0810.08\\%.\nBy multiple iterations of the convolution module, the receptive field of our model can cover the whole graph no matter how large the graph is.\nAs shown Table¬†1, our method achieves consistently high assignment accuracies with the problem size increasing.\nFurthermore, since the network architecture is independent of the structure and size of the graph, the running time of the proposed method increases very slightly as the problem size expands."
