    "benchmark approaches": "We implement a number of benchmark approaches in the literature. These approaches fall into two types, the first only considers the temporal factors and the second considers both temporal and spatial factors. Approaches with only temporal factors: HM (Historical Mean) predicts the traffic according to the mean value of the historical records. We implement two variants of the HM algorithms. The first considers only the recent time slots (closeness), denoted as HM (TC).  The second averages recent time slots (closeness), the historical records in the same time of last day (daily periodicity) and last week (weekly periodicity), thus considering multiple temporal factors, denoted as HM (TM). ARIMA  is a widely used time series prediction model, which mainly considers temporal closeness. GBRT (Gradient Boosted Regression Trees)  can be applied to predict the traffic for each location. Our GBRT implementation uses historical traffic data as features, not only from recent time slots, but also from last day and last week. Hence, GBRT considers multiple temporal factors. XGBoost  is similar to GBRT, another widely used tree-based machine learning model. LSTM  neural networks take the recent time-slot traffic data as inputs (closeness) and predict the future. Approaches with both temporal and spatial factors: ST-ResNet  leverages residual convolution networks to consider spatial proximity and also considers temporal closeness, daily and weekly periodicity simultaneously. Note that ST-ResNet can only work for grid-based traffic prediction (ridesharing). DCRNN  combines diffusion convolution and recurrent networks for capturing spatio-temporal features. The original DCRNN model only considers the temporal closeness and the spatial proximity graph. STGCN 5 combines graph convolution and gated convolution units to catch spatial and temporal features, respectively. It considers the temporal closeness and spatial proximity graph. GMAN  leverages attention mechanisms to model both temporal closeness and spatial proximity patterns for traffic prediction. Graph-WaveNet [ref]26 designs a data-driven graph convolution method for adaptively learning spatial knowledge in addition to proximity. For temporal knowledge, it considers only recent traffic data. ST-MGCN [ref]8 captures multiple spatial relations with graph convolutions. It also considers temporal closeness, daily and weekly periodicity. Not like STMeta, ST-MGCN concatenates the inputs regarding different temporal factors into one time-series data. ARGCN-CDW purely relies on data-driven graph convolution methods for extracting spatial knowledge . Meanwhile, it considers temporal closeness, daily and weekly periodicity same as ST-MGCN.444The original ARGCN  considers only temporal closeness, but it is hard to converge in our experiments. By modifying its input as the time-series data combined by closeness, daily and weekly periodicity (same as ST-MGCN), the performance of ARGCN is much improved. We denote this model as ARGCN-CDW. The hyperparameters of the above benchmark approaches follow the default settings as their original papers.555 We have also tested some other approaches in Table I, such as ASTGCN [ref]25 and STSGCN ; however, they are hard to converge under certain experiment scenarios."
