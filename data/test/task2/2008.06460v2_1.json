    "automatic hate speech detection": "A majority of contributions have been provided towards the identification of hateful and abusive content in online social media  4  . Applying a keyword-based approach is a fundamental method in hate speech detection task. Although using external sources such as the HateBase lexicon leads to a high-performing system in hate speech detection, maintaining and upgrading these resources are challenging. Furthermore, using specific hateful keywords in training data results in many false negatives related to the hateful samples, which are not containing those keywords . Hence, we do not employ such external resources in this study. Machine learning approach:\nTo detect hateful and abusive contents, different machine learning approaches utilizing distinguishable feature engineering techniques have been employed in the literature  , and it is asserted that surface-level features such as a bag of words, word-level and character-level nùëõn-grams, etc., are the most predictive features in this task. Regarding classification perspective, different algorithms such as Na√Øve Bayes , Logistic Regression , Support Vector Machines8, multi-view tacked Support Vector Machine (mSVM), etc., have been used to train a classifier for predicting the hateful contents. As a baseline, Waseem et al. addressed the problem of hate speech detection in Twitter by making a general definition of hateful content in social media based on guidelines inspired by Gender Studies and Critical Race Theory (CRT). Regarding that, they tried to annotate a corpus of 16,849 tweets as ‚ÄúRacism‚Äù, ‚ÄúSexism‚Äù and ‚ÄúNeither‚Äù by themselves, and the labels were inspected by ‚Äúa 25-year-old woman studying gender studies and a non-activist feminist‚Äù for identifying potential sources of bias. To train their model, they used different sets of features such as word and character nùëõn-grams up to 4, gender, length, and location and investigated the impact of each feature on the classifier performance. Their results indicated that character nùëõn-grams are the most indicative features, and using location or length is detrimental. Furthermore, Davidson et al. studied hateful and offensive contents in Twitter by sampling and annotating a 24‚ÄãK24ùêæ24K corpus of tweets as ‚ÄúHate‚Äù, ‚ÄúOffensive‚Äù and ‚ÄúNeither‚Äù. They developed a variety of multi-class classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc., on a set of features including Term Frequency‚ÄìInverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighted nùëõn-grams, Part Of Speech (POS) tagging, sentiment scores, some tweet-level metadata such as the number of hashtags, mentions, retweets, URLs, etc. Although their results illustrated that Logistic Regression with L2 regularization performs the best in terms of accuracy, precision, and F1-scores, there are some social biases regarding anti-black racism and homophobia in their algorithm. Malmasi et al.8 proposed an ensemble-based system that used some linear SVM classifiers in parallel to distinguish hate speech from general profanity in social media. Recently, MacAvaney et al. discussed different aspects of an automatic hate speech system. They mainly addressed challenges pertaining to the definition of hate speech, dataset collecting and annotation process and its availability, and the characteristics of existing approaches. Furthermore, they proposed a multi-view tacked Support Vector Machine (mSVM) based approach that achieved near state-of-the-art performance; using word and character nùëõn-grams up to 5 as feature vectors. However, the issue of bias in data and trained models were not addressed there. Deep learning approach:\nConcerning the word representation as a dense vector pre-trained on a large amount of data, some basic deep learning approaches proposed to tackle the problem of hate speech 9. The most frequently used word embeddings approaches are Word2Vec0, Glove1 and FastText2. As the first attempt, Djuric et al.3 proposed a neural network-based model advantaging pagraph2vec embeddings to distinguish between hate speech and clean content. The proposed model incorporated two steps: in the first step, paragraph2vec embeddings were extracted from a continuous bag of words model, and in the second step, hateful and non-hateful contents were identified by applying a binary classifier counting on the extracted embeddings. Badjatiya et al., who experimented on the dataset provided by Waseem and Hovy, investigated three deep learning architectures: FastText, CNN, and LSTM. They used a combination of randomly initialized or GloVe-based embeddings with an LSTM neural network and a gradient boosting classifier. Their results outperformed the baseline from Waseem and Hovy. Different feature embeddings such as word embeddings and character nùëõn-grams were defined by Gamb√§ck et al., to solve the problem of identification of hate speech based on a CNN model. Afterward, a CNN+GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit network) neural network model was proposed by Zhang et al.9 in which the model captured both word/character combinations (e. g., nùëõn-grams, phrases) and word/character dependencies (order information) with employing a pre-trained word2vec embeddings. Waseem et al.7 brought a new insight to hate speech and abusive language detection tasks by proposing a multi-task learning framework to deal with datasets across different annotation schemes, labels, or geographic and cultural influences from data sampling. They proposed a transfer learning technique in which solving two hate speech detection tasks simultaneously and utilizing similarities between these two tasks leads to better generalization. Their experiments revealed that the multi-task learning framework produces better performance by switching between using a task as auxiliary and the other as primary. Using raw texts and domain-specific metadata from Twitter, Founta et al.4 proposed a unified classification model at which different types of abusive language such as cyberbullying, hate, sarcasm, etc., were efficiently performed."
