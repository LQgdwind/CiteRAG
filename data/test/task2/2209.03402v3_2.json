    "introduction": "We study the following subgraph counting problem: given two graphs H𝐻H and G𝐺G, compute the number of copies of H𝐻H in G𝐺G. For several decades this problem has received widespread attention from the theoretical community, leading to a rich algorithmic toolbox that draws from different techniques  [ref]3   and to deep structural results in parameterised complexity theory  7. Since it was discovered that subgraph counts reveal global properties of complex networks  , subgraph counting has also found several applications in fields such as biology   genetics [ref]58, phylogeny , and data mining .\nUnfortunately, the subgraph counting problem is in general intractable, since it contains as special cases hard problems such as Clique. This does not mean however that the problem is always intractable; it just means that it is tractable when the pattern H𝐻H is restricted to certain graph families. Identifying these families of patterns that are efficiently countable has been a key question for the last twenty years. A long stream of research eventually showed that, unless standard conjectures fail, subgraph counting is tractable only for very restricted families of patterns  2     7  9. To circumvent this “wall of intractability”, in this work we restrict both the family of the pattern H𝐻H and the family of the host G𝐺G. Formally, given two classes of graphs ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} and 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}, we study the problems #​Sub​(ℋ→𝒢)#Sub→ℋ𝒢\\#\\textsc{Sub}(\\mathcal{H}\\to\\mathcal{G}), #​IndSub​(ℋ→𝒢)#IndSub→ℋ𝒢\\#\\textsc{IndSub}(\\mathcal{H}\\to\\mathcal{G}), and #​Hom​(ℋ→𝒢)#Hom→ℋ𝒢\\#\\textsc{Hom}(\\mathcal{H}\\to\\mathcal{G}), defined as follows. For all of them, the input is a pair (H,G)𝐻𝐺(H,G) with H∈ℋ𝐻ℋH\\in\\mathcal{H} and G∈𝒢𝐺𝒢G\\in\\mathcal{G}. The outputs are respectively the number of subgraphs of G𝐺G isomorphic to H𝐻H, denoted by #​𝖲𝗎𝖻​(H→G)#𝖲𝗎𝖻→𝐻𝐺\\#\\mathsf{Sub}(H\\to G), the number of induced subgraphs of G𝐺G isomorphic to H𝐻H, denoted by #​𝖨𝗇𝖽𝖲𝗎𝖻​(H→G)#𝖨𝗇𝖽𝖲𝗎𝖻→𝐻𝐺\\#\\mathsf{IndSub}(H\\to G), and the number of homomorphisms (edge-preserving maps) from H𝐻H to G𝐺G, denoted by #​𝖧𝗈𝗆​(H→G)#𝖧𝗈𝗆→𝐻𝐺\\#\\mathsf{Hom}(H\\to G).\nOur goal is to determine for which ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} and 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} these three problems are tractable. To formalize what we mean by tractable, we adopt the framework of parameterized complexity 1: we say that a problem is fixed-parameter tractable, or in the class FPTFPT\\mathrm{FPT}, if it is solvable in time f​(|H|)⋅|G|O​(1)⋅𝑓𝐻superscript𝐺𝑂1f(|H|)\\cdot|G|^{O(1)} for some computable function f𝑓f (see Section 2 for a complete introduction). For instance, we consider as tractable a running time of 2O​(|H|)⋅|G|⋅superscript2𝑂𝐻𝐺2^{O(|H|)}\\cdot|G| but not one of |G|O​(|H|)superscript𝐺𝑂𝐻|G|^{O(|H|)}. This captures the intuition that H𝐻H is “small” compared to G𝐺G, and is the main theoretical framework for subgraph counting . Thus, the goal of this work is understanding the fixed-parameter tractability of #​Sub​(ℋ→𝒢)#Sub→ℋ𝒢\\#\\textsc{Sub}(\\mathcal{H}\\to\\mathcal{G}), #​IndSub​(ℋ→𝒢)#IndSub→ℋ𝒢\\#\\textsc{IndSub}(\\mathcal{H}\\to\\mathcal{G}), and #​Hom​(ℋ→𝒢)#Hom→ℋ𝒢\\#\\textsc{Hom}(\\mathcal{H}\\to\\mathcal{G}) as a function of ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} and 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}. Moreover, when those problems are not fixed-parameter tractable we aim to show that they are hard for the complexity class #​W​#Wdelimited-[]1\\#\\mathrm{W}, which can be thought of as the equivalent of NPNP\\mathrm{NP} for parameterized counting. We first briefly discuss which properties of 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} are worthy of attention. When 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is the class of all graphs, it is well known that each of the three problems is either FPTFPT\\mathrm{FPT} or #​W​#W\\#\\mathrm{W}\\text{}-hard depending on whether certain structural parameters of ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} (such as treewidth or vertex cover number) are bounded or not.\nThus, when 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is the class of all graphs, the problem is solved.\nHowever, when 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is arbitrary, no such characterization is known. This is partly due to the fact that “natural” structural properties related to subgraph counting are harder to find for 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} than for ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}; subgraph counting algorithms themselves usually exploit the structure of H𝐻H but not that of G𝐺G (think of tree decompositions).\nThere is however one deep structural property that, if held by 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}, yields tractability: the property of being nowhere dense, introduced by Nešetřil and Ossona de Mendez . In a nutshell 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is nowhere dense if, for all r∈ℕ0𝑟subscriptℕ0r\\in\\mathbb{N}_{0}, its members do not contain as subgraphs the r𝑟r-subdivisions of arbitrarily large cliques; it can be shown that this generalizes several natural definitions of sparsity, including having bounded degree or bounded local treewidth, or excluding some topological minor.\nIn a remarkable result, Nešetřil and Ossona de Mendez proved:222In the realm of decision problems, an even more general meta-theorem is known for first-order model-checking on nowhere dense graphs . If 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is nowhere dense then #​Hom​(ℋ→𝒢)#Hom→ℋ𝒢\\#\\textsc{Hom}(\\mathcal{H}\\to\\mathcal{G}), #​Sub​(ℋ→𝒢)#Sub→ℋ𝒢\\#\\textsc{Sub}(\\mathcal{H}\\to\\mathcal{G}), and #​IndSub​(ℋ→𝒢)#IndSub→ℋ𝒢\\#\\textsc{IndSub}(\\mathcal{H}\\to\\mathcal{G}) are fixed-parameter tractable and can be solved in time\nf​(|H|)⋅|V​(G)|1+o​(1)⋅𝑓𝐻superscript𝑉𝐺1𝑜1f(|H|)\\cdot|V(G)|^{1+o(1)} for some computable function f𝑓f. Thus the case that 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is nowhere dense is closed, and we can focus on its complement — the case where 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is somewhere dense. Hence the question studied in this work is: when are #​Sub​(ℋ→𝒢)#Sub→ℋ𝒢\\#\\textsc{Sub}(\\mathcal{H}\\to\\mathcal{G}), #​IndSub​(ℋ→𝒢)#IndSub→ℋ𝒢\\#\\textsc{IndSub}(\\mathcal{H}\\to\\mathcal{G}), and #​Hom​(ℋ→𝒢)#Hom→ℋ𝒢\\#\\textsc{Hom}(\\mathcal{H}\\to\\mathcal{G}) fixed-parameter tractable, provided 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is somewhere dense?"
