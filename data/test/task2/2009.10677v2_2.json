    "an optimal algorithm for max nae-{3}3\\{3\\}-sat (assuming ugc).": "In Section 4, we tackle the problem of finding an optimal approximation algorithm for MAX NAE-{3}3\\{3\\}-SAT. Our approach follows a similar template to that of  for MAX CUT. Like , we consider the max-min problem of finding an RPR2 rounding function f𝑓f which achieves at least the optimal approximation ratio for any distribution 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} of triples of unit vectors (pairs of unit vectors for MAX CUT). In the case of MAX CUT,  showed that the “most difficult” 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} is a distribution over pairs of identical unit vectors, and pairs of unit vectors with dot product ρ<0𝜌0\\rho<0. Likewise, we show (see Theorem 4.8) that the most difficult 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} come from triples of vectors that are have pairwise dot products (ρ,ρ,1)𝜌𝜌1(\\rho,\\rho,1) or (ρ0,ρ0,ρ0)subscript𝜌0subscript𝜌0subscript𝜌0(\\rho_{0},\\rho_{0},\\rho_{0}), where ρ∈(−1,0]𝜌10\\rho\\in(-1,0] and ρ0=max⁡(ρ,−1/3)subscript𝜌0𝜌13\\rho_{0}=\\max(\\rho,-1/3) or ρ0=1subscript𝜌01\\rho_{0}=1. Once we fix a distribution 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}, the performance of f𝑓f can be expressed using a double integral. Using calculus of variations, we can then produce an integral equation that must be satisfied by the optimal f𝑓f, known as a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind (c.f., [ref]27). If we discretize f𝑓f as a step function, the integral equation becomes a system of linear equations (c.f., Section 6 of the full version of ). Thus, like in , we can efficiently compute an arbitrarily close approximation of the optimal function for MAX NAE-{3}3\\{3\\}-SAT. We found that the optimal approximation ratio is approximately 0.90890.90890.9089. We also observed that the optimal function is very close to an s𝑠s-linear function, that is of the form f​(x)=max⁡(−1,min⁡(1,s​x))𝑓𝑥11𝑠𝑥f(x)=\\max(-1,\\min(1,sx)), but there is a nontrivial error term on the order of O​(x3)𝑂superscript𝑥3O(x^{3})."
