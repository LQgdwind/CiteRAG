    "iv-c crowd localization": "The second experiment is a comparison between our proposed approach with state-of-the-art crowd localization methods: RAZ-Net , Compo-CNN [ref]8, MCNN [ref]3, PSDDN , etc. Table.¬†IV-C reports their performances in terms of Precision and Recall. On ShanghaiTech-A dataset, the proposed approach outperforms other competitors obviously in terms of both Precision and Recall. Similar to , we find that crowd in ShanghaiTech-A is much denser than that in ShanghaiTech-B. On ShanghaiTech-B dataset, the proposed approach is superior to RAZ-Net, Compo-CNN and MCNN. On WorldExpo dataset, the proposed approach achieves the highest Precision=0.820 and Recall=0.812. On the newest and most challenging dataset UCF-QNRF, although most methods have a slight performance decline in their Precision and Recall values, the proposed approach obtains performance improvement over RAZ-Net and Compo-CNN, which are two strong competitors. In addition, some representative localization results are shown in Fig.¬†6 and Fig.¬†7. The red dots represent the ground truth while green dots are the locations detected by the proposed approach. It can be seen that even for very dense crowds, the proposed method still generates precise localization results. Effect of High Crowd Density To further evaluate the existing crowd localization methods, in the third experiment, we investigate a significant issue in crowd analysis: how well the methods work in highly crowded scenes? To clarify the effect of high crowd density, we explore accuracies of five aforementioned crowd localization approaches with respect to varying crowd density. We rank test samples from WorldExpo [ref]7 and UCF-QNRF [ref]8 dataset according to the number of people present, resulting in 14080 images of size 200-by-200. We divide all the test samples into 33 groups, whose average crowd densities increase gradually from extremely sparse to extremely dense. For example: images in the first test sample group have only 1 people; images in the 15th group contain 40.8 people on average. Fig.5 presents the F1-scores of the five crowd localization methods on the 33 test sample groups. In the first 12 groups where average crowd densities are not very high [0-30], RAZ-Net, Compo-CNN, MCNN or PSDDN achieves superior F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1}-scores and outperforms ‚ÄùProposed‚Äù in 4 groups. But when facing the last 21 groups whose average crowd densities are much higher, the ‚ÄùProposed‚Äù obviously preserves the discrimination ability in highly crowded scenes. The relative F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1}-scores gains over the 4 methods increase with a higher average crowd density. More specifically, it is in the range of average crowd density = [60-135] (i.e. 20th to 33th group) that Compo-CNN, MCNN and PSDDN show rapid and obvious performance declines suffering from the increasing average crowd density. In the most crowded group, the F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1}-scores of RAZ-Net, MCNN and PSDDN have drop to the range of 0.40-0.48; in comparison ‚ÄùProposed‚Äù maintains a F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1}-score=0.637. The trend is clear. As the crowd density increases the accuracy gap between ‚ÄùProposed‚Äù and other methods increases, supporting our claim that regression in encoding signal space is better than detecting pixel coordinates of small objects in pixel space for crowd analysis in highly congested scenes."
