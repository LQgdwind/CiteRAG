    "h.3 visual question answering": "We used the VQA-v2 dataset [ref]31 with the standard splits (443K, 214K, and 453K question-image pairs for train/dev/test, the latter subdivided into test-dev, test-standard, test-challenge and test-reserve). We adapted the implementation of [ref]32,101010https://github.com/MILVLG/mcan-vqa consisting of a Modular Co-Attention Network (MCAN). Our architecture is the same as [ref]32 except that we represent the image input with grid features generated by a ResNet [ref]54 pretrained on ImageNet , instead of bounding-box features .\nThe images are resized to 448√ó448448448448\\times 448 before going through the ResNet that outputs a feature map of size 14√ó14√ó20481414204814\\times 14\\times 2048. To represent the input question words we use 300-dimensional GloVe word embeddings , yielding a question feature matrix representation. Table¬†5 shows the hyperparameters used for all the VQA experiments presented. All the models we experimented with use the same features and were trained only on the train set without data augmentation."
