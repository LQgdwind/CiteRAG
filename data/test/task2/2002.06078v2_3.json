    "tight bounds": "In this section we provide two tight bounds concerning odd induced subgraphs and odd colorings. Namely, we first provide in Theorem 5.1 a tight upper bound on the odd chromatic number in terms of tree-width, and then we provide in Theorem 5.2 a tight lower bound on the size of a maximum odd induced subgraph for graphs that admit a join. For every graph G𝐺G with all components of even order we have that χ𝗈𝖽𝖽​(G)≤𝗍𝗐​(G)+1subscript𝜒𝗈𝖽𝖽𝐺𝗍𝗐𝐺1\\chi_{{\\sf odd}}(G)\\leq{\\sf tw}(G)+1, and this bound is tight. Scott proved [42, Corollary 3] that every graph G𝐺G with all components of even order admits a vertex partition such that every vertex\nclass induces a tree with all degrees odd. Consider such a vertex partition, and let G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} be the graph obtained from G𝐺G by contracting each of the trees to a single vertex. Since G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} is a minor of G𝐺G, we have that 𝗍𝗐​(G′)≤𝗍𝗐​(G)𝗍𝗐superscript𝐺′𝗍𝗐𝐺{\\sf tw}(G^{\\prime})\\leq{\\sf tw}(G). Now note that every proper vertex coloring of G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} using q𝑞q colors can be lifted to a partition of V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) into q𝑞q odd induced subgraphs (in fact, odd induced forests). Indeed, with every color i𝑖i of a proper q𝑞q-coloring of V​(G′)𝑉superscript𝐺′V(G^{\\prime}) we associate an induced forest of G𝐺G defined by the union of the trees whose corresponding vertex in G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} is colored i𝑖i; see Fig 6 for an example. Therefore, where we have used the well-known fact that the chromatic number of a graph is at most its tree-width plus one . To see that this bound it tight, consider a subdivided clique Knsuperscriptsubscript𝐾𝑛K_{n}^{\\,\\begin{picture}(-1.0,1.0)(-1.0,-2.5)\\circle*{2.0}\\end{picture}\\ }, that is, the graph obtained from a clique on n𝑛n vertices, with n≡0,3(mod4)𝑛0annotated3pmod4n\\equiv 0,3\\pmod{4}, by subdividing every edge once; see Fig. 7 for an example. Since no pair of original vertices of the clique can get the same color, we have that χ𝗈𝖽𝖽​(Kn)=n=𝗍𝗐​(Kn)+1subscript𝜒𝗈𝖽𝖽superscriptsubscript𝐾𝑛𝑛𝗍𝗐superscriptsubscript𝐾𝑛1\\chi_{{\\sf odd}}(K_{n}^{\\,\\begin{picture}(-1.0,1.0)(-1.0,-2.5)\\circle*{2.0}\\end{picture}\\ })=n={\\sf tw}(K_{n}^{\\,\\begin{picture}(-1.0,1.0)(-1.0,-2.5)\\circle*{2.0}\\end{picture}\\ })+1. Let us mention some consequences of Theorem 5.1. Hou et al. 7 define the following parameter. Let 𝒢ksubscript𝒢𝑘\\mathcal{G}_{k} be the set of all graphs of treewidth at most k𝑘k without isolated vertices, and let ck=minG∈𝒢k⁡𝗆𝗈𝗌​(G)|V​(G)|subscript𝑐𝑘subscript𝐺subscript𝒢𝑘𝗆𝗈𝗌𝐺𝑉𝐺c_{k}=\\min_{G\\in\\mathcal{G}_{k}}\\frac{{\\sf mos}(G)}{|V(G)|}. In 7 the authors prove that c2=2/5subscript𝑐225c_{2}=2/5 and say that the best general lower bound is ck≥12​k+2subscript𝑐𝑘12𝑘2c_{k}\\geq\\frac{1}{2k+2}, which follows from a result of Scott . As an immediate corollary of Theorem 5.1 it follows that ck≥1k+1subscript𝑐𝑘1𝑘1c_{k}\\geq\\frac{1}{k+1}, which improves the lower bound by a factor two. As it is known 7 that, for k∈𝑘delimited-[]4k\\in, ck≤2k+3subscript𝑐𝑘2𝑘3c_{k}\\leq\\frac{2}{k+3}, our lower bound implies that 1/4≤c3≤1/314subscript𝑐3131/4\\leq c_{3}\\leq 1/3 and 1/5≤c4≤2/715subscript𝑐4271/5\\leq c_{4}\\leq 2/7. We now provide a lower bound on 𝗆𝗈𝗌​(G)𝗆𝗈𝗌𝐺{\\sf mos}(G) for every graph that admits a join. For every n𝑛n-vertex graph G𝐺G that admits a join we have and this bound is tight even for cographs. Let V1,V2⊆V​(G)subscript𝑉1subscript𝑉2𝑉𝐺V_{1},V_{2}\\subseteq V(G) define a join of G𝐺G. We proceed to define a coloring c:V​(G)→:𝑐→𝑉𝐺delimited-[]3c:V(G)\\to such that, for some i∈𝑖delimited-[]3i\\in, G​[c−1​(i)]𝐺delimited-[]superscript𝑐1𝑖G[c^{-1}(i)] is an odd subgraph with the claimed order. We distinguish three cases according to the parities of n𝑛n, |V1|subscript𝑉1|V_{1}|, and |V2|subscript𝑉2|V_{2}|. Case 1: n𝑛n is even and both |V1|,|V2|subscript𝑉1subscript𝑉2|V_{1}|,|V_{2}| are odd. Gallai proved (see ) that the vertex set of every graph G𝐺G can be partitioned into two sets A,B𝐴𝐵A,B such that G​[A]𝐺delimited-[]𝐴G[A] is odd and G​[B]𝐺delimited-[]𝐵G[B] is even. We apply this result to both G​[V1]𝐺delimited-[]subscript𝑉1G[V_{1}] and G​[V2]𝐺delimited-[]subscript𝑉2G[V_{2}], yielding four sets V1𝖾,V1𝗈,V2𝖾,V2𝗈superscriptsubscript𝑉1𝖾superscriptsubscript𝑉1𝗈superscriptsubscript𝑉2𝖾superscriptsubscript𝑉2𝗈V_{1}^{{\\sf e}},V_{1}^{{\\sf o}},V_{2}^{{\\sf e}},V_{2}^{{\\sf o}} such that, for i∈𝑖delimited-[]2i\\in, Vi=Vi𝖾⊎Vi𝗈subscript𝑉𝑖⊎superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑖𝖾superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑖𝗈V_{i}=V_{i}^{{\\sf e}}\\uplus V_{i}^{{\\sf o}}, G​[Vi𝖾]𝐺delimited-[]superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑖𝖾G[V_{i}^{{\\sf e}}] is even, and G​[Vi𝗈]𝐺delimited-[]superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑖𝗈G[V_{i}^{{\\sf o}}] is odd. For i∈𝑖delimited-[]2i\\in, the fact that G​[Vi𝗈]𝐺delimited-[]superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑖𝗈G[V_{i}^{{\\sf o}}] is odd implies that |Vi𝗈|superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑖𝗈|V_{i}^{{\\sf o}}| is even, which in turn implies that |Vi𝖾|superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑖𝖾|V_{i}^{{\\sf e}}| is odd since, by assumption, |Vi𝖾|+|Vi𝗈|=|Vi|superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑖𝖾superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑖𝗈subscript𝑉𝑖|V_{i}^{{\\sf e}}|+|V_{i}^{{\\sf o}}|=|V_{i}| is odd. We define c−1​(1)=V1𝖾∪V2𝖾superscript𝑐11superscriptsubscript𝑉1𝖾superscriptsubscript𝑉2𝖾c^{-1}(1)=V_{1}^{{\\sf e}}\\cup V_{2}^{{\\sf e}}, c−1​(2)=V1𝗈∪V2𝗈superscript𝑐12superscriptsubscript𝑉1𝗈superscriptsubscript𝑉2𝗈c^{-1}(2)=V_{1}^{{\\sf o}}\\cup V_{2}^{{\\sf o}}, and c−1​(3)=∅superscript𝑐13c^{-1}(3)=\\emptyset. Since V1,V2≠∅subscript𝑉1subscript𝑉2V_{1},V_{2}\\neq\\emptyset as they define a join of G𝐺G, and both |V1|subscript𝑉1|V_{1}| and |V2|subscript𝑉2|V_{2}| are odd, it follows that, for i∈𝑖delimited-[]2i\\in, Vi𝖾≠∅superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑖𝖾V_{i}^{{\\sf e}}\\neq\\emptyset. This implies that both G​[c−1​(1)]𝐺delimited-[]superscript𝑐11G[c^{-1}(1)] and G​[c−1​(2)]𝐺delimited-[]superscript𝑐12G[c^{-1}(2)] are odd, and therefore one of them has order at least n/2𝑛2n/2. Case 2: n𝑛n is even and both |V1|,|V2|subscript𝑉1subscript𝑉2|V_{1}|,|V_{2}| are even. Let v1∈V1subscript𝑣1subscript𝑉1v_{1}\\in V_{1} and v2∈V2subscript𝑣2subscript𝑉2v_{2}\\in V_{2} be two arbitrary vertices. We define c​(v1)=c​(v2)=3𝑐subscript𝑣1𝑐subscript𝑣23c(v_{1})=c(v_{2})=3 and we apply Case 1 above to the graph G−{v1,v2}𝐺subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2G-\\{v_{1},v_{2}\\} with join given by V1∖{v1}subscript𝑉1subscript𝑣1V_{1}\\setminus\\{v_{1}\\} and V2∖{v2}subscript𝑉2subscript𝑣2V_{2}\\setminus\\{v_{2}\\}, obtaining two odd induced subgraphs of G𝐺G colored 1 and 2, one of which has order at least (n−2)/2𝑛22(n-2)/2. Note that G​[c−1​(3)]𝐺delimited-[]superscript𝑐13G[c^{-1}(3)] is also an odd subgraph (an edge). Case 3: n𝑛n is odd. Assume without loss of generality that |V1|subscript𝑉1|V_{1}| is even and |V2|subscript𝑉2|V_{2}| is odd, and let v1∈V1subscript𝑣1subscript𝑉1v_{1}\\in V_{1} be an arbitrary vertex. We apply again Case 1 to the graph G−{v1}𝐺subscript𝑣1G-\\{v_{1}\\} with join given by V1∖{v1}subscript𝑉1subscript𝑣1V_{1}\\setminus\\{v_{1}\\} and V2subscript𝑉2V_{2}, obtaining two odd induced subgraphs of G𝐺G, one of which has order at least (n−1)/2𝑛12(n-1)/2. Note that since n𝑛n is odd, in this case χ𝗈𝖽𝖽​(G)subscript𝜒𝗈𝖽𝖽𝐺\\chi_{{\\sf odd}}(G) is not defined. Summarizing, we have proved that if n𝑛n is even, then 𝗆𝗈𝗌​(G)≥n−22𝗆𝗈𝗌𝐺𝑛22{\\sf mos}(G)\\geq\\frac{n-2}{2}, and that if n𝑛n is odd, then 𝗆𝗈𝗌​(G)≥n−12𝗆𝗈𝗌𝐺𝑛12{\\sf mos}(G)\\geq\\frac{n-1}{2}. Taking into account that an odd subgraph must have even order, both cases imply that, for every n𝑛n, 𝗆𝗈𝗌​(G)≥2⋅⌈n−24⌉𝗆𝗈𝗌𝐺⋅2𝑛24{\\sf mos}(G)\\geq 2\\cdot\\left\\lceil\\frac{n-2}{4}\\right\\rceil. Let us now see that this bound is tight for both even and odd values of n𝑛n. For even n𝑛n, consider the tripartite graph K2,2,2subscript𝐾222K_{2,2,2}. It can be checked that this graph contains none of K4subscript𝐾4K_{4}, K1,3subscript𝐾13K_{1,3}, and 2​K22subscript𝐾22K_{2} (which are the only odd subgraphs on four vertices) as an induced subgraph, and therefore 𝗆𝗈𝗌​(K2,2,2)=2=2⋅⌈6−24⌉𝗆𝗈𝗌subscript𝐾2222⋅2624{\\sf mos}(K_{2,2,2})=2=2\\cdot\\left\\lceil\\frac{6-2}{4}\\right\\rceil. Finally, for odd n𝑛n, consider C5+superscriptsubscript𝐶5C_{5}^{+}, that is, the graph obtained from C5subscript𝐶5C_{5} by adding (any) two vertex-disjoint chords. Again, it can be checked that this graph contains none of K4subscript𝐾4K_{4}, K1,3subscript𝐾13K_{1,3}, and 2​K22subscript𝐾22K_{2} as an induced subgraph, and therefore 𝗆𝗈𝗌​(C5+)=2=2⋅⌈5−24⌉𝗆𝗈𝗌superscriptsubscript𝐶52⋅2524{\\sf mos}(C_{5}^{+})=2=2\\cdot\\left\\lceil\\frac{5-2}{4}\\right\\rceil.\nNote that both K2,2,2subscript𝐾222K_{2,2,2} and C5+superscriptsubscript𝐶5C_{5}^{+} are cographs; see Fig. 8. Determining a tight lower bound for cographs that are not necessarily connected remains open. The proof of Cases 1 and 2 of Theorem 5.1 together with the fact that χ𝗈𝖽𝖽​(K2,2,2)=3subscript𝜒𝗈𝖽𝖽subscript𝐾2223\\chi_{{\\sf odd}}(K_{2,2,2})=3 (since 𝗆𝗈𝗌​(K2,2,2)=2𝗆𝗈𝗌subscript𝐾2222{\\sf mos}(K_{2,2,2})=2) yield the following corollary. Let G𝐺G be a cograph with every connected component of even order. Then χ𝗈𝖽𝖽​(G)≤3subscript𝜒𝗈𝖽𝖽𝐺3\\chi_{{\\sf odd}}(G)\\leq 3. Moreover, this bound is tight. Note that cographs can be equivalently defined as P4subscript𝑃4P_{4}-free graphs. It is interesting to note that, in contrast to Corollary 1, P5subscript𝑃5P_{5}-free graphs have unbounded odd chromatic number. Indeed, let Hnsubscript𝐻𝑛H_{n} be the graph obtained from the subdivided clique Knsuperscriptsubscript𝐾𝑛K_{n}^{\\,\\begin{picture}(-1.0,1.0)(-1.0,-2.5)\\circle*{2.0}\\end{picture}\\ }, with n≡0,3(mod4)𝑛0annotated3pmod4n\\equiv 0,3\\pmod{4}, by adding an edge between each pair of original vertices of the clique. It can be checked that χ𝗈𝖽𝖽​(Hn)≥nsubscript𝜒𝗈𝖽𝖽subscript𝐻𝑛𝑛\\chi_{{\\sf odd}}(H_{n})\\geq n and, in fact, the proof of Theorem 3.2 implies that χ𝗈𝖽𝖽​(Hn)=nsubscript𝜒𝗈𝖽𝖽subscript𝐻𝑛𝑛\\chi_{{\\sf odd}}(H_{n})=n. Note that Hnsubscript𝐻𝑛H_{n} is a split graph, hence split graphs have unbounded odd chromatic number."
