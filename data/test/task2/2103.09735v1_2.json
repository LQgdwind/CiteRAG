    "other related work": "There are many well-studied geometric packing problems. In the 2D bin packing problem¬†(2BP), we are given a set of rectangular items and unit square bins, and the goal is to pack all the items into a minimum number of bins. The problem is APX-hard  and the currently best\nknown\napproximation ratio is 1.4051.4051.405 . In the 2D strip packing problem (2SP), we are given a set of rectangular items and a fixed-width unbounded-height strip, and the goal is to pack all the items into the strip such that the height of the strip is minimized. Kenyon and R√©mila gave an APTAS for the problem  using a 3-stage packing. Both 2BP and 2SP are well-studied in the guillotine setting .\nCaprara  gave a 2-stage T‚àû(‚âà1.691)annotatedsubscriptùëáabsent1.691T_{\\infty}(\\approx 1.691)-approximation for 2BP.\nAfterwards, Caprara et al.¬† gave an APTAS for 2-stage 2BP and 2-stage 2SP.\nLater, Bansal et al.¬† showed an APTAS for guillotine 2BP.\nBansal et al.¬† conjectured that the worst-case ratio between the best guillotine 2BP and the best general 2BP is 4/3434/3. If true, this would imply a (43+Œµ)43ùúÄ(\\frac{4}{3}+\\varepsilon)-approximation algorithm for 2BP.\nSeiden et al.¬† gave an APTAS for guillotine 2SP. Both the APTAS for guillotine 2BP and guillotine 2SP are based on the fact that general guillotine 2BP or guillotine 2SP can be approximated arbitrarily well by O‚Äã(1)ùëÇ1O(1)-stage packings, and such O‚Äã(1)ùëÇ1O(1)-stage packings can be found efficiently. Interestingly, we showed that this property is not true for 2GGK. Pach and Tardos  conjectured that, for any set of nùëõn non-overlapping axis-parallel rectangles, there is a guillotine cutting sequence separating Œ©‚Äã(n)Œ©ùëõ\\Omega(n) of them.\nRecently, the problem has received attention in  [ref]41 since a proof of this conjecture would imply a O‚Äã(1)ùëÇ1O(1)-approximation for the Maximum Independent Set of Rectangles problem, which is\na long-standing open problem."
