    "i-a motivation and literature review": "To study complex phenomena (e.g., gene selection in cancer classification ) by using big data requires us to characterize the relationships among a large number of variables. In this paper, our focus is on decentralized learning of tree-structured Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) from noisy vertically distributed data set. The noise in the data set is due to the noisy communication between sensors and the FC, the limited power of the sensors, environmental harsh conditions of operation, and straggler sensors: sensors that are significantly slower than the average , . Tree-structured GGM is the special model of unidrected graphical models (UGMs) that are important tools for tractable modeling of multivariate distributions. Furthermore, the factorization properties, associated with the graphical models, are less complex computationally. UGMs are Markov random fields (MRFs), and these models are more natural for some problems such as image analysis and spatial statistics , 6. If the multivariate distributions are also assumed to be Gaussian, then the models will be called GGMs. GGMs are widely used for complex networks such as gene selection for cancer classification , brain connectivity networks , and social networks . Structure learning: finding the allowed dependencies among variables, is a model selection problem where a graph is chosen that corresponds to the dependence structure in a given data set. If the graph is tree structure, the efficient maximum likelihood (ML) method is given by Chow-Liu  to estimate the probability distribution from the data set. The ML estimator is equivalent to maximum weight spanning tree (MWST) problem which can efficiently be solved by Kruskal 7 or Prim algorithm 8. The tree-structured models are practically utilizable because a small sample size and low time complexity are required as compared to graphs with loops for computing the ML . The error exponent of Chow-Liu algorithm is analyzed in  [ref]9, and 3 for tree-structured discrete distribution, continuous distribution, and tree-structured Ising model with side information, respectively.\nThe tree-structured graphical models are learned in the decentralized system 0 with Gaussian random variables and the fully distributed system 5 with binary random variables under communication constraints. Tavassolipour et al. study the structure learning problem where the data set is distributed vertically across machines 0. The inverse covariance matrix estimation in GGMs is studied with the known graphical model 6 7 in the distributed environment where distributed machines collaboratively estimate the inverse covariance matrix using message passing protocols. Tavassolipour et al. 1 study the structure learning of GGM (not tree structure): inferring the non-zero pattern of the precision matrix from the vertically distributed data set. Structure learning has also been performed from noisy data set such as a general graph is learned in 2 from the noisy data set. In addition, the tree-structured GGM recovery is studied in 3 from Gaussian corrupted noisy data set. Similarly, Katiyar et al. studies the problem of recovering tree-structured Ising model from non-identically distributed noises 4. The sample complexity requirement for learning tree-structured Ising model and GGM is studied under reliable data set  and noisy data set 8, 9 based on Chow-Liu algorithm. In addition, it has been proved in 0 that Chow-Liu algorithm gives the ML estimate of the tree for noisy data set where the noise is not necessarily identically distributed. For hidden non-parametric tree structure learning of graphical model, they also provide the lower bounds on the sample complexity for the general alphabet (i.e., countable and finite). Partial recovery of tree-structured graphical model is studied in 1 from noisy data set where the noise is non-identically distributed."
