    "introduction": "Given the opaque, “black-box” nature of complex Machine Learning (ML) systems, their deployment in mission-critical domains is limited by the extent to which they can be interpreted or validated. In particular, predictions, (trained) models and (training) data should be accounted for. One way to achieve this is by “transparency by design”, so that all components of a predictive system are “glass boxes”, i.e., ante-hoc transparency . Alternatively, transparency might be achieved with post-hoc tools, which have the advantage of not limiting the choice of a predictive model in advance . The latter approaches can either be model-specific or model-agnostic . Despite this wide range of available tools and techniques, many of them are non-interactive, providing the explainee (a recipient of an explanation) with a single explanation that has been optimised according to some predefined metric. While some of these methods simply cannot be customised by the end user without an in-depth understanding of their inner workings, others can take direct input from users with a varying level of domain expertise: from a lay audience – e.g., selecting regions of an image in order to query their influence on the classification outcome – to domain experts – e.g., tuning explanation parameters such as the importance of neighbouring data points. A particular risk of a lack of interaction and personalisation mechanisms is that the explanation may not always align with users’ expectations, reducing its overall value and usefulness. Allowing the user to guide and customise an explanation can benefit the transparency of a predictive system by making it more suitable and appealing to the explainee, for example, by adjusting its content and complexity. Therefore, personalisation can be understood as modifying an explanation or an explanatory process to answer user-specific questions. For counterfactual explanations of the form: “had feature X𝑋X been different, the prediction of the model would have been different too”, these can be user-defined constrains on the number and type of features (X𝑋X) that can and cannot appear in the conditional statement. Delegating the task of customising and personalising explanations to the end user via interaction mitigates the need for the difficult process of modelling the user’s mental model beforehand, rendering the task feasible and making the whole process feel more natural, engaging and less frustrating. In human interactions, understanding is naturally achieved via an explanatory dialogue [ref]26, possibly supported with visual aids. Mirroring this explanatory process for ML transparency would make it attractive and accessible to a wide audience. Furthermore, allowing the user to customise explanations extends their utility beyond ML transparency. The explainee can steer the explanatory process to inspect fairness (e.g., identify biases towards protected groups111A protected group is a sub-population in a data set created by fixing a value of a protected attribute such as age, gender or ethnicity, which discriminating upon is illegal.) , assess accountability (e.g., identify model errors such as non-monotonic predictions with respect to monotonic features)  or debug predictive models [ref]20 . In contrast to ML tasks  – where any interaction may be impeded by human-incomprehensible internal representations utilised by a predictive model – interacting with explainability systems is feasible as the representation has to be human-understandable in the first place, thereby enabling a bi-directional communication. Interaction with explanatory systems also allows incorporating new knowledge into the underlying ML algorithm and building a mental model of the explainee, which will help to customise the resulting explanations. Consider the example of explaining an image with a local surrogate method that relies upon super-pixel segmentation (e.g., LIME algorithm introduced by Ribeiro et al. ). While super-pixel discovery may be good at separating colour patches based on their edges, these segments do not often correspond to meaningful concepts such as ears or a tail for a dog image – see Figure 1 for an example. The explanation can be personalised by allowing the explainee to merge and split segments before analysing their influence on the output of a black-box model, thereby implicitly answering what prompted the explainee to alter the segmentation. User input is a welcome addition given the complexity of images; a similar approach is possible for tabular and text data, although user input is often unnecessary in these two cases. For tabular data the explainee may select certain feature values that are of interest or create meaningful binning for some of the continuous features; for text data (treated as a bag of words) the user may group some words into a phrase that conveys the correct meaning in that particular sentence. This exchange of knowledge between the explainee and the explainability system can considerably increase the quality of explanations, but also poses a significant safety, security and privacy risk. A malicious explainee may use such a system to reveal sensitive data used to train the underlying predictive (or explanatory) model, extract proprietary model components, or learn its behaviour in an attempt to game it (see Section 3.2). After Miller’s [ref]26 seminal work – inspired by explanation research in the social sciences – drew attention to the lack of human-aspect considerations in the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) literature – with many such systems being designed by the technical community for the technical community  – researchers started acknowledging the end user when designing XAI solutions. While this has advanced human-centred design and validation of explanations produced by XAI systems, another of Miller’s insights received relatively little attention: the interactive, dialogue-like nature of explanations. Many of the state-of-the-art explainability approaches are static, one-off systems that do not take user input or preferences into consideration beyond the initial configuration and parametrisation  [ref]9    .222To clarify, the notion of interaction is with respect to the explanation, e.g., the ability of the explainee to personalise it, and not the overall interactiveness of the explainability system. While sometimes the underlying explanatory algorithms are simply incapable of a meaningful interaction, others do apply a technique or utilise an explanatory artefact that can support it in principle. Part of this trend can be attributed to the lack of a well-defined protocol for evaluating interactive explanations and the challenging process of assessing their quality and effectiveness, which – in contrast to a one-shot evaluation – is a software system engineering challenge333Building such systems requires a range of diverse components: user interface, natural language processing unit, natural language generation module, conversation management system and a suitable and well-designed XAI algorithm. Furthermore, most of these components are domain-specific and cannot be generalised beyond the selected data set and use case. and requires time- and resource-consuming user studies. Schneider and Handali  noted that bespoke explanations in AI – achieved through interaction or otherwise – are largely absent within the existing literature. Research in this space usually touches upon three aspects of “personalised” explanations. First, there are interactive machine learning systems where the user input is harnessed to improve performance of a predictive model or align the data processing with its operator’s prior beliefs. While the classic active learning paradigm dominates this space, Kulesza et al. [ref]20 designed a system that presents its users with classification explanations to help them refine and personalise the predictive task, hence focusing the interaction on the underlying ML model and not the explanations. Similarly, Kim et al.  introduced an interactive ML system with an explainability component, allowing its users to alter the data clustering based on their preferences. Secondly, the work of Krause et al.  and Weld and Bansal  focused on interactive (multi-modal) explainability systems. Here, the interaction allows the explainee to elicit more information about an ML system by receiving a range of diverse explanations derived from a collection of XAI algorithms such as Partial Dependence (PD)  and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) [ref]9 plots. While this body of research illustrates what such an interaction (with multiple explanatory modalities) might look like and persuasively argues its benefits , the advocated interaction is mostly with respect to the presentation medium itself – e.g., an interactive PD plot – and cannot be used to customise and personalise the explanation per se. Thirdly, Madumal et al.  and Schneider and Handali  developed theoretical frameworks for interactive, personalised explainability that prescribe the interaction protocol and design of such systems. However, these theoretical foundations have not yet been utilised to design and implement an interactive explainability system coherent with XAI desiderata outlined by Miller [ref]26, which could offer customisable explanations. A more detailed overview and discussion of the relevant literature is given in Section 2. In this paper we propose an architecture of a truly interactive explainability system, demonstrate how to build such a system, analyse its desiderata, and examine how a diverse range of explanations can be personalised (Section 3). Furthermore, we discuss lessons learnt from presenting it to both a technical and a lay audience, and provide a plan for future research in this direction (Section 4). As a first attempt to build an XAI system that allows the explainee to customise and personalise the explanations, we decided to use a decision tree as the underlying predictive model. This choice simplifies many steps of our initial study, allowing us to validate (and guarantee correctness of) the explanations and reduce the overall complexity of the explanation generation and tuning process by inspecting the structure of the underlying decision tree. Using ante-hoc explanations derived from a single predictive model also allows us to mitigate engineering challenges that come with combining multiple independent XAI algorithms as proposed by Weld and Bansal . Furthermore, a decision tree can provide a wide range of diverse explanation types, many of which can be customised and personalised. Specifically, for global model explanations we provide model visualisation, and feature importance; while as prediction explanations we provide decision rule – extracted from a root-to-leaf path, counterfactual – achieved by comparing decision rules for different tree leaves, and exemplar – a similar training data point extracted from the tree leaves. When presented to the user, all of these explanations span a wide range of explanatory artefacts in visualisation (images) and textualisation (natural language) domains, thereby allowing us to test the extent to which they can be interactively personalised. Contrastive explanations, in particular class-contrastive counterfactual statements, are the foundation of our system. These take the form of: “had one of the attributes been different in a particular way, the classification outcome would have changed as follows….” Arguably, they are the most suitable, natural and appealing explanations targeted at humans [ref]26 . In addition to all of their desired properties grounded in the social sciences [ref]26 and legal considerations , they can be easily adapted to an interactive dialogue aimed at personalisation, which is not widely utilised. In our system they are delivered in an interactive dialogue – a natural language conversation, which is the most intuitive explanatory mechanism [ref]26. In summary, our approach aims to build a holistic and diverse interactive XAI system where the interaction is focused on personalising explanations (in accordance with Miller’s [ref]26 notion of XAI interactivity) as opposed to simply building an XAI system that provides explanations interactively (to explain different aspects of a black-box system using a range of XAI algorithms) – a subtle but significant difference."
