  "title": "Holistic Combination of Structural and Textual Code Information for Context based API Recommendation",
  "sections": {
    "related work": "This work is closely related to various research on code recommendation.\nIn modern IDE (Integrated Development Environment), type information is often used to recommend API method calls when classes or objects are typed.\nTo enhance the performance of the code recommendation in IDEs, several approaches have been proposed to sort, filter and group API methods for better recommendation   .\nIn comparison, APIRec-CST does not require a developer to write a receiver expression.\nHeinemann et al.  propose an API method recommendation algorithm based on the extracted identifiers (such as variable and type names) in the development context.\nIn comparison, in addition to the textual information (including identifiers), APIRec-CST also takes structural information into consideration.\nBesides, APIRec-CST uses a deep neural network to learn the semantics of the textual information instead of simply using Jaccard similarity.\nSeveral approaches   compute the similarity between the current code context and previous code examples based on a set of API calls or other additional information (such as method names, Java keywords, class or interface names).\nIn comparison, APIRec-CST considers the complete API usage modeled in an API context graph, which contains API calls, Java keywords, and control and data flow among them. Furthermore, APIRec-CST combines textual information which includes method names, parameter names, and variable names. This work is also related to work on mining usage patterns from source code, such as     8.\nThese approaches often apply deterministic mining algorithms to mine usage patterns for code recommendation.\nZhong et al.  propose MAPO to cluster code snippets and mine usage patterns by frequent subsequence mining.\nNguyen et al.  propose GrouMiner to mine usage patterns by representing source code as groums.\nNguyen et al. propose Grapacc 8, which first mines usage patterns based on graphs and then matches these patterns with the code fragment under editing based on graph-based features and token-based features.\nWang et al.  apply a two-step clustering strategy to cluster call sequences and mine usage patterns for each cluster using a frequent closed sequence mining algorithm.\nFowkes et al.  propose a near parameter-free probabilistic algorithm to infer the most interesting usage patterns.\nIn comparison, APIRec-CST learn regularity of the API usage based on deep learning techniques instead of mining usage patterns explicitly. Based on the conjecture that source code is naturally repetitive and predictable , many approaches have been proposed to learn statistical language models from source code for code recommendation.\nHindle et al.  train an n-gram model based on the tokens of the source code to recommend the next token.\nAllamanis et al.  use a large corpus of source code from various domains to train an n-gram model.\nNguyen et al.  enhance the n-gram model with roles and data types of code tokens and global technical concerns/functionality.\nTu et al.  enhance the n-gram model with a cache to capture the localized regularities in the source code to improve the accuracy.\nNguyen et al.  propose a graph-based statistical language model by using Bayesian statistical inference to compute the probabilities of API recommendations based on graphs.\nLiu et al.  propose a re-ranking approach based on the top-10 recommendations of GraLan to improve the top-1 accuracy using API usage paths as features.\nNguyen et al. 0 propose APIRec that learns from fine-grained code changes by developing an association-based change inference model to recommend API calls.\nIn comparison, APIRec-CST learns from the control and data flow in the source code instead of treating the source code as tokens as in the above-mentioned proposals.\nFurthermore, APIRec-CST takes a holistic approach to learn from both structural and textual code information. There are also approaches which apply deep learning techniques for code recommendation. Raychev et al.  treat the source code as sentences and combine the n-gram model with RNN for recommending sentences.\nDam et al.  train an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network based on code tokens.\nNguyen et al.  train a deep neural network called Dnn4C, which not only leverages the local context of lexical code elements, but also syntactic and type contexts.\nIn comparison, APIRec-CST combines a graph-based deep neural network and a token-based deep neural network to capture both structural and textual code information. This work is broadly related to other applications of deep learning techniques on source code for various objectives including code summarization 9, code generation 0 1 2 3 4, code search 5 6, comment generation 7 8 9 0 1 or defect prediction 2 3.\nFor example, Allamanis et al. 9 propose an attentional neural network to give an extreme summary of a sequence of code tokens.\nMou et al. 4 apply a sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network to generate code when given a user intention.\nGu et al. 6 propose a deep neural network called CODEnn to jointly embed code snippets and natural language descriptions.\nHu et al. 7 propose DeepCom which takes AST sequences of source code as input and generates the corresponding comments based on an attentional Seq2Seq model.\nWang et al. 3 apply Deep Belief Network to learn features of tokens extracted from source code for defect prediction.\nThese approaches apply different deep learning models to learn program semantics for different objectives. In comparison, APIRec-CST represents program as an API context graph and a bag of code tokens and designs a novel deep neural network for API recommendation."
