    "introduction": "In 1986, Du, Hsu, and Hwang  conjectured that if a graph on 3​n3𝑛3n vertices is the disjoint union of a Hamilton cycle of length 3​n3𝑛3n and n𝑛n pairwise vertex-disjoint triangles then its independence number is n𝑛n.\nThe conjecture has become known as the ‘cycle plus triangles’ problem and has been strengthened by Erdös 2, who conjectured that such a graph is 333-colorable.\nFleischner and Stiebitz  confirmed these conjectures in a strong form and proved, using an algebraic approach of Alon and Tarsi , that such a graph is in fact 333-choosable.\nTheir proof can also be viewed as an application of Alon’s Combinatorial Nullstellensatz technique . Slightly later, an alternative elementary proof of the 333-coloring result was given by Sachs 4. However, none of these proofs supplies an efficient algorithm that given a graph on 3​n3𝑛3n vertices whose set of edges is the disjoint union of a Hamilton cycle and n𝑛n pairwise vertex-disjoint triangles finds a 333-coloring of the graph or an independent set of size n𝑛n. Questions on the computational aspects of the problem were posed in several works over the years (see, e.g.,    ). A natural extension of the problem of Du et al.  is the following. Let G𝐺G be a cycle and let V1,…,Vmsubscript𝑉1…subscript𝑉𝑚V_{1},\\ldots,V_{m} be a partition of its vertex set into m𝑚m sets.\nWe are interested in an independent set of G𝐺G that (almost) fairly represents the given partition, that is, an independent set S𝑆S of G𝐺G satisfying |S∩Vi|≥12⋅|Vi|−1𝑆subscript𝑉𝑖⋅12subscript𝑉𝑖1|S\\cap V_{i}|\\geq\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot|V_{i}|-1 for all i∈[m]={1,…,m}𝑖delimited-[]𝑚1…𝑚i\\in[m]=\\{1,\\ldots,m\\}. The existence of such an independent set was proved in a work of Aharoni, Alon, Berger, Chudnovsky, Kotlar, Loebl, and Ziv . For the special case where all the sets Visubscript𝑉𝑖V_{i} are of size 333, the proof technique of Aharoni et al.  allowed them to show that there are two disjoint independent sets that fairly represent the partition, providing a new proof of a stronger form of the original conjecture of Du et al. . The results of  were then extended in a work of Alishahi and Meunier . A special case of one of their results is the following. Let G𝐺G be a cycle on n𝑛n vertices and let V1,…,Vmsubscript𝑉1…subscript𝑉𝑚V_{1},\\ldots,V_{m} be a partition of its vertex set into m𝑚m sets.\nSuppose that n𝑛n and m𝑚m have the same parity.\nThen, there exist two disjoint independent sets S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} and S2subscript𝑆2S_{2} of G𝐺G covering all vertices but one from each Visubscript𝑉𝑖V_{i} such that for each j∈{1,2}𝑗12j\\in\\{1,2\\}, it holds that |Sj∩Vi|≥12⋅|Vi|−1subscript𝑆𝑗subscript𝑉𝑖⋅12subscript𝑉𝑖1|S_{j}\\cap V_{i}|\\geq\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot|V_{i}|-1 for all i∈[m]𝑖delimited-[]𝑚i\\in[m]. As shown by Black et al. 0, analogues of Theorem 1.1 for paths and for partitions into sets of odd sizes can also be proved using the approach of Aharoni et al. . It is interesting to mention that although the statements of Theorem 1.1 and of its aforementioned variants are purely combinatorial, all of their known proofs are based on tools from topology. The use of topological methods in combinatorics was initiated by Lovász 6 who applied the Borsuk-Ulam theorem 1 from algebraic topology to prove a conjecture of Kneser 5 on the chromatic number of Kneser graphs. For integers n≥2​k𝑛2𝑘n\\geq 2k, the Kneser graph K​(n,k)𝐾𝑛𝑘K(n,k) is the graph whose vertices are all the k𝑘k-subsets of [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n] where two sets are adjacent if they are disjoint. It was proved in 6 that the chromatic number of K​(n,k)𝐾𝑛𝑘K(n,k) is n−2​k+2𝑛2𝑘2n-2k+2, a result that was strengthened and generalized by several researchers (see, e.g., [39, Chapter 3]).\nOne such strengthening was obtained by Schrijver 6, who studied the subgraph of K​(n,k)𝐾𝑛𝑘K(n,k) induced by the collection of all k𝑘k-subsets of [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n] with no two consecutive elements modulo n𝑛n. This graph is denoted by S​(n,k)𝑆𝑛𝑘S(n,k) and is commonly referred to as the Schrijver graph. It was proved in 6, again by a topological argument, that the chromatic number of S​(n,k)𝑆𝑛𝑘S(n,k) is equal to that of K​(n,k)𝐾𝑛𝑘K(n,k).\nAs for Theorem 1.1, the proof of Alishahi and Meunier  employs the Octahedral Tucker lemma that was applied by Matoušek 8 in an alternative proof of Kneser’s conjecture and can be viewed as a combinatorial formulation of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem (see also 8). The approach of Aharoni et al.  and of Black et al. 0, however, is based on a direct application of the chromatic number of the Schrijver graph.\nAs before, these proofs are not constructive, in the sense that they do not suggest efficient algorithms for the corresponding search problems.\nUnderstanding the computational complexity of these problems is the main motivation for the current work. In 1994, Papadimitriou 3 has initiated the study of the complexity of total search problems in view of the mathematical argument that lies at the existence proof of their solutions.\nLet 𝖳𝖥𝖭𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{TFNP} be the complexity class, defined in 0, of the total search problems in 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}, that is, the class of search problems in which a solution is guaranteed to exist and can be verified in polynomial running-time.\nPapadimitriou has introduced in 3 several subclasses of 𝖳𝖥𝖭𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{TFNP}, each of which consists of the total search problems that can be reduced to a problem that represents some mathematical argument.\nFor example, the class 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA} (Polynomial Parity Argument) corresponds to the simple fact that every graph with maximum degree 222 that has a vertex of degree 111 must have another degree 111 vertex. Hence, 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA} is defined as the class of all problems in 𝖳𝖥𝖭𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{TFNP} that can be efficiently reduced to the Leaf problem, in which given a succinct representation of a graph with maximum degree 222 and given a vertex of degree 111 in the graph, the goal is to find another such vertex.\nThe class 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖣𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖣\\mathsf{PPAD} (Polynomial Parity Argument in Directed graphs) is defined similarly with respect to directed graphs.\nAnother complexity class defined in 3 is 𝖯𝖯𝖯𝖯𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{PPP} (Polynomial Pigeonhole Principle) whose underlying mathematical argument is the pigeonhole principle. Additional examples of complexity classes defined in this way are 𝖯𝖫𝖲𝖯𝖫𝖲\\mathsf{PLS} (Polynomial Local Search) 4, 𝖢𝖫𝖲𝖢𝖫𝖲\\mathsf{CLS} (Continuous Local Search) 5, and 𝖤𝖮𝖯𝖫𝖤𝖮𝖯𝖫\\mathsf{EOPL} (End of Potential Line) . The complexity class 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖣𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖣\\mathsf{PPAD} is known to perfectly capture the complexity of many important search problems.\nNotable examples of 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖣𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖣\\mathsf{PPAD}-complete problems are those associated with Sperner’s lemma 3 2, the Nash Equilibrium theorem 3 4, the Envy-Free Cake Cutting theorem , and the Hairy Ball theorem 0.\nFor 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}, the undirected analogue of 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖣𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖣\\mathsf{PPAD}, until recently no ‘natural’ complete problems were known, where by ‘natural’ we mean that their definitions do not involve circuits and Turing machines. In the last few years, the situation was changed following a breakthrough result of Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg  , who proved that the Consensus Halving problem with an inverse-polynomial precision parameter is 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}-complete (see also ) and used it to derive the 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}-completeness of the classical Splitting Necklace with two thieves and Discrete Sandwich problems. This was obtained building on the 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}-hardness, proved by Aisenberg, Bonet, and Buss , of the search problem associated with Tucker’s lemma. The variant of the problem that corresponds to the Octahedral Tucker lemma was suggested for study by Pálvölgyi 2 and proved to be 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}-complete by Deng, Feng, and Kulkarni 9.\nThe 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}-completeness of the Consensus Halving problem was improved to a constant precision parameter in a recent work of Deligkas, Fearnley, Hollender, and Melissourgos 7.\nAdditional examples of 𝖯𝖯𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖠\\mathsf{PPA}-complete problems can be found, for instance, in the works of Belovs et al. , Schnider 5, and Deligkas et al. 8."
