    "introduction": "Disclaimer: This article uses words or language that is considered profane, vulgar, or offensive by some readers. Owing to the topic studied in this article, quoting offensive language is academically justified but neither we nor PLOS in any way endorse the use of these words or the content of the quotes. Likewise, the quotes do not represent our opinions or the opinions of PLOS, and we condemn online harassment and offensive language. Owning to the recent proliferation of user-generated textual contents in online social media, a wide variety of studies have been dedicated to investigating these contents in terms of hate or toxic speech, abusive or offensive languages, etc.,    [ref]5 . With regard to the mobility and anonymous environment of online social media, suspect users, who generate abusive contents or organize the hate-based activities, exploit these online platforms to propagate hate and offensive contents towards other users and communities [ref]7; where it leads to personal trauma, hate crime, cyber-bullying, and discrimination (mainly racial and sexual discriminations). Therefore, online social media have been persuaded to define policies to remove such harmful content from their platforms since 2015 0. The spread of hate speech and offensive language on online social media has received considerable attention from both academic and industrial environments to detect different types of hatred and toxicities (threats, obscenity, etc.). For example, different workshops and challenges such as the third Workshop on Abusive Language Online1 and Kaggle’s Toxic Comment Classification Challenge2 are conducted to address this issue by proposing different automated tools for identification of hate speech and abusive language on social media. Three main aspects of hate speech detection that rise to some challenges in this task are: 1) Definition of hate speech; 2) Designing and developing an automatic tool for identification of hate speech; 3) Tackling the problem of unintended data-driven and algorithm-driven biases in automatic hate speech detection tools; described as follows. There is considerable disagreement about what exactly hate speech is3 [ref]7, and how different terms can be inferred as hatred or offensive in certain circumstances. For example, some terms such as “n*gga” and “c*on” were used to disparage African American communities, however, they were not known as offensive when used by peoples belonging to these communities4. In this study, we employ a commonly used definition of hate speech as any communication criticizing a person or a group based on some characteristics such as gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, race, etc., with or without using offensive or profane words. To define automated methods with a promising performance for hate speech detection in social media, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been used jointly with classic Machine Learning (ML)   and Deep Learning (DL) techniques5 6 . The majority of contributions in classic supervised machine learning-based methods, for hate speech detection, rely on different text mining-based features or user-based and platform-based metadata 7 8, which require them to define an applicable feature extraction method and prevent them to generalize their approach to new datasets and platforms. However, recent advancements in deep neural networks and transfer learning approaches allow the research community to address these limitations. Although some deep neural network models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)6, Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), etc., have been employed to enhance the performance of hate speech detection tools, the requirement of a sufficient amount of labeled data and the inability of methods to be generalized have remained as open challenges. To address these limitations some transfer learning methods are proposed recently5 9. However these methods enhanced the performance of hate speech detection models, they did not address the existing bias in data and algorithm. From the bias’s perspective, despite previous efforts into generating well-performed methods to detect hate speech and offensive language, the potential biases due to the collection and annotation process of data or training classifiers have raised a few concerns. Some studies ascertain the existence of bias regarding some identity terms (e.g., gay, bisexual, lesbian, Muslim, etc.) in the benchmark datasets and try to mitigate the bias using an unsupervised approach based on balancing the training set0 or debiasing word embeddings and data augmentation. Moreover, some racial and dialectic bias exist in several widely used corpora annotated for hate speech and offensive language1 2 4. Therefore, it is crucial to consider data-driven and algorithm-driven biases included in the hate speech detection system. Additionally, these kinds of race and gender discriminations caused by exciting biases in dataset or classifiers lead to unfairness against the same groups that the classifiers are trained to protect. This study is an extended version of our previous work5 at which we proposed a transfer learning approach for identification of hate speech in online social media by employing a combination of the unsupervised pre-trained model BERT3 and new supervised fine-tuning strategies. Here, we investigate the effect of unintended bias in our pre-trained BERT-based model and use a generalization mechanism proposed by Schuster et.al 6, for debiasing fact verification models, in training data by reweighting samples and then changing the fine-tuning strategies in terms of the loss function to mitigate the racial bias propagated through the model. The main contributions of this work are as follows: Following our previous study5, we conduct a comprehensive experiment to inspect the impact of our transfer learning approach in a shortage of labeled data and in capturing syntactical and contextual information of all BERT transformers’ embeddings. A regularization mechanism is used to mitigate data-driven and algorithm-driven bias by reweighting the training data and improving their generalization apart from their classes. We use two publicly available datasets for hate speech and offensive language detection. New fine-tuning strategy, in terms of the loss function, is employed to fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model by new re-weighted training data. Finally, we perform a cross-domain validation approach to show the efficiency of the proposed bias mitigation mechanism."
