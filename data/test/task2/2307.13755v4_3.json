    "model robustness with reliable pseudo-labels": "Recent advancements have been primarily directed at enhancing the reliability of pseudo-labels (see Table 1). These improvements encompass several approaches, such as:\ni) selecting pseudo-boxes with higher scores ,\nii) employing instant pseudo-labeling and simultaneous training of two models ,\niii) utilizing soft pseudo-labels and teacher ensembles [ref]24,\niv) selecting the most optimal labeled examples [ref]18,\nv) employing a memory module and a two-stage pseudo-label filtering 2,\nvi) using a redistributed mean teacher and proposal self-assignment ,\nvii) applying prediction-guided label assignment and positive-proposal consistency voting ,\nviii) utilizing Teacher-Student mutual learning ,\nix) assessing relative model uncertainties ,\nx) developing two differently structured pseudo-label polishing networks 3, and\nxi) directly generating proposals for consistency regularization between perturbed image pairs .\nThese methods aim to train robust models by imposing an agreement strategy (or consistency) between the predictions of Teacher-Student models using labeled and unlabeled data. However, relying on similar predictions and classical EMA can lead to losing model distinctiveness and early convergence of models. To address this, we introduce a simple yet effective RD strategy, which helps maintain divergence between the models, enabling the exploration of additional patterns in unlabeled data and promoting model generalization. Aside from that, existing methods typically use a confidence threshold to determine the number of bounding boxes. Decreasing this threshold increases the information mined but can introduce noisy pseudo-labels, reducing detection performance. Conversely, using a higher threshold produces a limited number of high-quality boxes, ignoring some objects during the SSL stage.\nIn addition to the Faster-RCNN detector, we assess our TMR-RD approach with the Faster-RCNN equipped with cascade regression, which relies on a multi-stage architecture featuring specialized regressors for precise localization. This evaluation serves to highlight the versatility of our approach, indicating its potential to improve the overall performance and generalization of existing methods."
