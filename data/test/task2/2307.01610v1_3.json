    "iv-a experimental setup": "Datasets.\nWe consider five common benchmark datasets, and we describe them below. Purchase100 [ref]37 includes 197,324 shopping records of customers, each with 600 binary features indicating whether a specific item is purchased.\nThe goal is to predict the customer’s shopping habits (100 different classes in total). Texas100 [ref]37 contains 67,330 hospital discharge records, each containing 6,170 binary features indicating whether the patient has a particular symptom or not.\nThe data is divided into 100 classes, and the goal is to predict the treatment given the patient’s symptoms. Location30 [ref]37 contains the location “check-in” records of different individuals. It has 5,010 data records with 446 binary features, each of which corresponds to a certain loation type and indicates whether the individual has visited that particular location. The goal is to predict the user’s geosocial type (30 classes in total). CIFAR100  is an image classification dataset that has 60,000 images in 100 object classes. Each image has a size of 32×\\times32×\\times3. CIFAR10  is similar to CIFAR100 that also contains 60,000 images but with 10 different object classes. We follow [ref]36 to use the fully-connected (FC) networks on Purchase100, Texas100 and Location30, and a DenseNet-12  on CIFAR100 and CIFAR10 (Appendix A-H conducts evaluation on more network architectures, including ResNet-18 , MobileNet  and ShuffleNet ).\nPurchase100 is trained with 20,000 samples, Texas100 with 15,000 samples, Location30 with 1,500 samples, CIFAR100 and CIFAR10 are with 25,000 samples. Section V-B reports additional experiments on more training sizes (from 2,500 to 50,000). Attacks.\nWe consider all nine attacks as in Section II-C.\nFor NN-based attack, we use the black-box NSH attack from Nasr et al. , which uses the model loss, logit values from the target model, and the ground-truth label to train an attack inference model.\nWe consider the loss-based attack from Yeom et al.  and confidence-, entropy- and modified-entropy-based attacks as in Song et al. .\nFor LiRA [ref]3, we train 128 shadow models for each defense (64 IN and OUT models each), where each shadow model is trained following the same procedure as the targeted defense (as per our threat model).\nE.g., for HAMP, this means the shadow model is trained with the same high-entropy soft labels and the entropy-based regularization as the defense model, and the shadow model also performs the same output modification as HAMP does. We consider the boundary and augmentation attacks from Choquette et al. .\nFor the boundary attack on the two image datasets, we use the CW2 attack  to generate adversarial samples and derive the perturbation magnitude threshold to distinguish members and non-members.\nLikewise, for the other three non-image datasets that contain binary features, we compute the sample’s robustness to random noise instead of adversarial perturbation.\nFor each sample x𝑥x, we generate hundreds of noisy variants of x𝑥x, and the number of correctly classified noisy variants of x𝑥x is used to determine a threshold that best distinguishes between members and non-members.\nFor augmentation attack, we consider image translation as the augmentation method, and we similarly consider different degrees of translation to find the best attack. HAMP configuration.\nγ,α𝛾𝛼\\gamma,\\alpha are the two parameters in configuring HAMP (for generating high-entropy soft labels and controlling the strength of regularization respectively).\nWe perform grid search to select the parameters (γ∈[0.5,0.99],α∈[0.0001,0.5]formulae-sequence𝛾0.50.99𝛼0.00010.5\\gamma\\in[0.5,0.99],\\alpha\\in[0.0001,0.5]), and select the one with small train-validation gap and high validation accuracy.\nWe also conduct evaluation to study how HAMP’s performance varies under different parameters (please see Appendix A-E). For the testing-time defense, we generate random samples (e.g., random pixels in  ) and perform output modification as in Section III-D. There are no any other requirements. Our code is available at https://github.com/DependableSystemsLab/MIA_defense_HAMP. Related defenses.\nWe consider seven major defenses: AdvReg , MemGuard , DMP [ref]36, SELENA , Early stopping  , Label Smoothing (LS)  and DP-SGD .\nWe follow the original work to set up the defenses unless otherwise stated (more details in Appendix A-A). Evaluation metrics.\nAn ideal privacy defense should provide strong protection for both members and non-members, for which we follow the best practice [ref]3 to consider (1) attack true positive rate (TPR) evaluated at 0.1% false positive rate (FPR), which evaluates the protection for members, and (2) attack true negative rate (TNR) at 0.1% false negative rate (FNR), which quantifies the protection for non-members. Result organization.\nTable I reports the model accuracy for every defense.\nFig. 3 compares each defense in terms of their membership privacy and model utility.\nEach defense is evaluated with multiple attacks, and we report the ones that achieve the highest attack TPR or TNR (detailed results for each attack are in Appendix A-K).\nFig. 4 presents the average attack AUC (area under curve) by each defense, and the full ROC curves are in Appendix A-J.\nWe leave the comparison with early stopping in Appendix A-D due to space constraint.\nSection V-A presents an ablation study, and Appendix A-F reports training and inference overhead evaluation.\nWe next discuss the results by comparing HAMP with other defenses."
