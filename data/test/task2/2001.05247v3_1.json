    "adiabatic quantum computation": "The primary purpose of computation is to solve given computational problems efficiently with as fewer resources as possible. Most of the computing devices at present time are in fact programmable machines that perform basic operations mechanically in enormous speed and precision.\nAs a new paradigm founded solely on quantum mechanics, quantum computation has gained large popularity over the past few decades through numerous physical experiments. There are already several important milestones in our time that indicate the supremacy of quantum computation over the existing computers. Shor \ndiscovered a polynomial-time quantum algorithm to factor any positive integer and compute discrete logarithms whereas Grover\n 7\npresented a quantum way to search for a given key in an unstructured database quadratically faster than the traditional search. Early quantum-mechanical models of computation were proposed in the 1980s by Benioff  and Deutsch\n and these computational models were later refined by Yao  and Bernstein and Vazirani  as quantum circuit and quantum Turing machine (QTM), which respectively extend the classical models of Boolean circuit and Turing machine.\nBeyond a single-tape QTM model of Bernstein and Vazirani,\na multi-tape QTM model was further studied in   as well as .\nA recursion-theoretic formulation was also proposed in  with no use of machinery to capture quantum computation.\nThose models are powerful enough to implement the quantum algorithms of Shor and Grover but are hard to realize physically as real-life computing devices.\nQuantum Turing machines seem to be slightly more contrive than quantum circuits but they are a better manifestation of “programmable” computers because they are made of input/work tapes, tape heads, and finite-control units.\nQuantum finite(-state) automata can be seen as quantum Turing machines operating with only constant work space.\nEarly restrictive models of quantum finite automata were studied by Moore and Crutchfield  and by Kondacs and Watrous . There also exists another model for classical computation, known as simulated annealing (or thermal annealing), which has been implemented as a physical system performing various computations based on thermodynamics. Quantum annealing was proposed based on quantum mechanics to extend simulated annealing and a tunneling effect in quantum mechanics makes quantum annealing outperform simulated annealing (see, e.g., ).\nIn quantum annealing, computation is viewed as a process of evolution of a quantum state |ψ​(t)⟩ket𝜓𝑡|\\psi(t)\\rangle at time t𝑡t in a given quantum system according to the Schrödinger equation ı​ℏ​dd​t​|ψ​(t)⟩=H​(t)​|ψ​(t)⟩italic-ıPlanck-constant-over-2-pi𝑑𝑑𝑡ket𝜓𝑡𝐻𝑡ket𝜓𝑡\\imath\\hbar\\frac{d}{dt}|\\psi(t)\\rangle=H(t)|\\psi(t)\\rangle using a specified time-dependent Hamiltonian H​(t)𝐻𝑡H(t) (which is a Hermitian matrix), where ℏPlanck-constant-over-2-pi\\hbar is the reduced Planck constant (i.e., Plank’s constant ≈6.63×10−34absent6.63superscript1034\\approx 6.63\\times 10^{-34} joule/second divided by 2​π2𝜋2\\pi).\nIn early 2000s, Farhi, Goldstone, Gutmann, and Sipser  and Farhi, Goldstone, Gutmann, Lapan, Lundgren, and Preda  developed quantum algorithms based on a variant of quantum annealing, called adiabatic quantum computation, in which an initial quantum system evolves to find a unique solution, which is represented by the ground state (i.e., an eigenstate of the smallest eigenvalue) of a final quantum system. The adiabatic quantum algorithm of Farhi et al. , for instance, solves Search-2SAT (i.e., a search version of the satisfiability problem for 2CNF Boolean formulas). Another paper by Farhi et al.  demonstrated how to solve an NPNP\\mathrm{NP}-complete problem, known as the Exact Cover Problem.\nLater, van Dam, Mosca, and Vazirani  showed an exponential lower-bound for adiabatic quantum computation to solve the Minimum\nHamming Weight Problem. To be more precise, adiabatic quantum computation is dictated by two Hamiltonians Hi​n​isubscript𝐻𝑖𝑛𝑖H_{ini} and Hf​i​nsubscript𝐻𝑓𝑖𝑛H_{fin} of dimension 2nsuperscript2𝑛2^{n} and a closeness bound ε𝜀\\varepsilon such that the start of the system is Hi​n​isubscript𝐻𝑖𝑛𝑖H_{ini}’s unique ground state and the outcome of the system becomes the unique ground state of Hf​i​nsubscript𝐻𝑓𝑖𝑛H_{fin}, provided that the “uniqueness” condition is guaranteed for Hi​n​isubscript𝐻𝑖𝑛𝑖H_{ini} and Hf​i​nsubscript𝐻𝑓𝑖𝑛H_{fin}.\nThe time-dependent Hamiltonian H​(t)𝐻𝑡H(t) is given as a linear combination (1−tT)​Hi​n​i+tT​Hf​i​n1𝑡𝑇subscript𝐻𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑇subscript𝐻𝑓𝑖𝑛(1-\\frac{t}{T})H_{ini}+\\frac{t}{T}H_{fin} of Hi​n​isubscript𝐻𝑖𝑛𝑖H_{ini} and Hf​i​nsubscript𝐻𝑓𝑖𝑛H_{fin}.\nSuch a quantum system starts with the ground state |ψg​(0)⟩ketsubscript𝜓𝑔0|\\psi_{g}(0)\\rangle of the initial Hamiltonian H​(0)=Hi​n​i𝐻0subscript𝐻𝑖𝑛𝑖H(0)=H_{ini} at time t=0𝑡0t=0. If H​(t)𝐻𝑡H(t) changes sufficiently slowly, the evolving quantum state |ψ​(t)⟩ket𝜓𝑡|\\psi(t)\\rangle stays close to the ground state |ψg​(t)⟩ketsubscript𝜓𝑔𝑡|\\psi_{g}(t)\\rangle of H​(t)𝐻𝑡H(t). At time t=T𝑡𝑇t=T, the ground state of the quantum system becomes |ψg​(T)⟩ketsubscript𝜓𝑔𝑇|\\psi_{g}(T)\\rangle of the final Hamiltonian H​(T)=Hf​i​n𝐻𝑇subscript𝐻𝑓𝑖𝑛H(T)=H_{fin}. We demand that this ground state is sufficiently close to the quantum state encoding the desired solution of a target computational problem. For the efficiency of adiabatic quantum computation, we are primarily concerned with the evolution time T𝑇T of the quantum system and the structural complexity of two Hamiltonians Hi​n​isubscript𝐻𝑖𝑛𝑖H_{ini} and Hf​i​nsubscript𝐻𝑓𝑖𝑛H_{fin} of the system. The running time of the system, which is determined by the minimal evolution time of the system as well as the maximal matrix norm of H​(t)𝐻𝑡H(t), is basically proportional to the reciprocal of the spectral gap of Hi​n​isubscript𝐻𝑖𝑛𝑖H_{ini} and Hf​i​nsubscript𝐻𝑓𝑖𝑛H_{fin} according to the so-called adiabatic theorem  . For the details, see Section 3.1. A crucial point is how fast the evolution of the quantum system takes place. Unfortunately, it turns out that the aforementioned algorithm of Farhi et al. requires exponential time to execute . Nevertheless, Aharonov, van Dam, Kemp, Landau, Lloyd, and Regev  demonstrated how adiabatic quantum computation can simulate quantum-circuit computation efficiently.\nIn addition, van Dam, et al.  gave a detailed analysis of adiabatic quantum computation and presented how to simulate adiabatic quantum computation on quantum circuits. The simulations of Aharonov et al. and van Dam et al. together establish the (polynomial) equivalence between adiabatic quantum computation and machine-based quantum computation.\nAlthough adiabatic quantum computation is no more powerful than standard quantum computation, it seems to remain as significant potentials to realize restricted variants of quantum computation. With the current technology, however, it still seems to be difficult to build a large-scale adiabatic quantum computing device since making local evolution in a large system is quite sensitive to decoherence. It is rather better to make global evolution in a small-scale quantum system."
