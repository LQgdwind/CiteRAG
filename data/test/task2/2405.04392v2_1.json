    "ii-b local invariant trajectory-shape descriptors": "Local trajectory-shape descriptors for point trajectories are based on separating the spatio-temporal trajectory into a spatial curve and a time profile along this curve. Fundamentals of the description of spatial curves were established in the 19th century by Frenet  and Serret, leading to the well-known Frenet-Serret (FS) formulas.\nThe FS formulas show that a complete description of a curve up to congruence can be found by defining a pair of functions, i.e., the curvature and torsion, along the curve. These functions are obtained by defining a moving reference frame, referred to as the FS frame, along the curve. The curvature and torsion are then obtained by differentiating this frame. Based on the FS frame, Cartan  introduced the method of the moving frame in differential geometry for the local examination of submanifolds of various homogeneous spaces. The aim of this method is to provide the submanifold and all its geometrical objects with the most general moving frame.\nBy differentiating this frame, differential invariants are obtained that characterize the submanifold apart from transformations embedding it in the surrounding homogeneous space. Bishop  defined another moving frame along a spatial curve as a more robust alternative to the Frenet-Serret frame. The resulting frame is referred to as the Bishop frame or rotation-minimizing frame, since it minimizes the rotation of the frame along the curve. However, the Bishop frame is not a true local frame since it depends on the curve’s history. The FS invariants are best known to describe the trajectory of a moving point in Euclidean space. Nevertheless, similar invariants can be derived for the description of the orientation trajectory of a rotating body.\nThis extension is proposed in , where the extended FS invariants for rigid-body motion are introduced. This extension consists of the definition of two FS frames, one for rotation and one for translation. The descriptor in  is a left-invariant descriptor . That is, it is invariant to the viewpoint, but it still depends on a user-selected reference point to define the translational velocity of the body. This requires some knowledge of the user about the type of motion and the points of interest on the moving body. Another downside of this descriptor is that a high dissimilarity might be detected between similar rigid-body motions with different reference points. The dependency on the reference point for translation can be removed by making use of screw theory  such that the descriptor becomes both left- and right-invariant, also referred to as bi-invariant. From the work of Chasles , it is known that the first-order kinematics of a moving body can be described in a bi-invariant way by its rotation and translation along the instantaneous screw axis (ISA).\nThe location and orientation of the ISA in space can be represented in multiple ways, including Plücker coordinates and dual numbers. Based on dual numbers, the author of  derived a bi-invariant moving frame for rigid-body motion. This moving frame has the same orientation as the FS-frame for orientation in , while its origin coincides with the striction point on the ISA. Differentiating this moving frame results in a set of four differential invariants. Two invariants describe the rotation of the moving frame, while the other two describe its translation. De Schutter  observed that above four differential invariants can be augmented with two additional invariants, describing the rotation and translation of the body along the ISA, to form the minimal and complete ISA descriptor for rigid-body trajectories. The ISA descriptor is complete since it completely describes the evolution of the moving frame and contains just enough information to reproduce the original trajectory of the rigid body up to congruence. In  and  it is shown how the ISA descriptor can be used to define a similarity measure for motion recognition applications. However, the recognition performance of the ISA descriptor remained limited due to its sensitivity to singularities . Veldkamp 5 and Bottema and Roth  observed that above moving frame can also be used as a local reference frame to characterize the kinematics of any point on the moving body in an invariant way. Modeling the kinematics of these points up to first order requires two invariants, the second order requires four additional invariants, and the third require six additional invariants. These twelve invariants are referred to as the instantaneous invariants for spatial motion and provide a complete description of the trajectory shape up to third order. However, in 5 and , no corresponding similarity measures were devised and an approach to reproduce the original motion from the invariants was not discussed. Recent works 1 2    2 6 4 7 8 9 9 propose approaches based on local trajectory-shape descriptors for the recognition and generation of trajectories in diverse contexts. Aimed at practical applications, multiple methods have been developed to robustly calculate the differential invariants in the presence of sensor noise and singularities. In 1 2, the calculation of higher-order derivatives is avoided by approximating the differential invariants using finite differences 0. In    Kalman smoothers are used to robustly estimate higher-order derivatives from noisy measurement data. In 2, discretized invariants are introduced as an alternative to differential invariants by describing the relation between subsequent moving frames using Denavit-Hartenberg parameters. In 6 4 7, integral invariants are used to approximate the differential invariants for point trajectories. Integral invariants are found by calculating area integrals on the osculating and rectifying planes, which are locally determined by the Frenet-Serret frame. The domain of integration is restricted to a local region based on a ball kernel centered at the moving point. In 8 9, differential invariants are calculated by formulating an optimization problem over a window of measurements. This approach ensures a smooth solution for the moving frame by minimizing corresponding regularization terms, and guarantees a driftless trajectory reconstruction by additionally limiting the trajectory reconstruction error. To conclude, recent approaches apply invariant descriptors for the recognition and generation of trajectories in diverse contexts. However, the performance of these invariant descriptors is typically limited due to their sensitivity to singularities.\nFurthermore, to our knowledge, the ISA descriptor is the only bi-invariant descriptor for rigid-body motion that has been applied for trajectory recognition, reproduction and generalization applications."
