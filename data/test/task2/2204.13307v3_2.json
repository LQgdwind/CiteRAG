  "sections": {
    "v-b related work in n-tuple research": "N-tuple networks, which are an important building block of our approach, have shown to work well in many games, e. g., in ConnectFour  [ref]22, Othello , EinStein würfelt nicht (EWN) 0, 2048 [ref]6, SZ-Tetris 1, etc.\nOther function approximation networks (DNN or other) could be used as well in AlphaZero-inspired RL, but n-tuple networks have the advantage that they can be trained very fast on off-the-shelf hardware. There are two papers in the game learning literature that combine n-tuple networks with MCTS:\nSironi et al. 2 use the n-tuple bandit EA to automatically tune a self-adaptive MCTS. This is an interesting approach but for a completely different goal and not related to AlphaZero. Chu et al. 0 use an n-tuple network as a guidance for MCTS in the game EWN. They train an n-tuple network via Monte-Carlo RL and incorporate the trained heuristic with three different approaches into MCTS. Monte Carlo is a special form of temporal difference (TD) learning, namely TD(1). To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to couple n-tuple networks with MCTS using TD(λ𝜆\\lambda)-training with arbitrary λ𝜆\\lambda. Neither Chu et al. 0 nor we use MCTS in the training loop for the main results. However, we compare in Sec. IV-E – at least for some viable settings – MCTS within and outside of self-play training. Finally, we use our approach for other games than those studied in 0."
