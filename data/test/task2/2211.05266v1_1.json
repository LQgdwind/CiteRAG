    "introduction": "Real root isolation of equation systems is a fundamental problem in mathematics and engineering applications. There are many famous symbolic computation methods to solve the problem: the Gröbner basis method  6, the Ritt-Wu characteristic set method , the cylindrical algebraic decomposition(CAD) and the resultant method 6 and so on. Though the size of the polynomial systems that can be solved is limited, symbolic methods can get the algebraic representation(s) of all the complex solutions, even including the multiplicity of the solutions.\nNumerical methods, such as the homotopy continuation method 6, can get all the isolated complex solutions of square polynomial systems (systems with n𝑛n variables and n𝑛n polynomials) with large sizes, even for over-determined systems or positive dimensional systems .\nThough the solutions with traditional homotopy continuation method are lack of certification,\nthe certified homotopy method was proposed   2 3 6 in some literatures to overcome the shortcoming based on the famous α𝛼\\alpha-theory. To ensure that the output results are reliable, certification with interval Newton’s method (see 4 1 7) for possible real roots after homotopy continuation method is applied in 8. Subdivision method is also used to get the real solutions of the given systems, which are not limited to polynomial case   5 1 7 2 8 4 5 9 7. There are many methods to exclude the domains without solutions 5 4 9 9 .\nMore requirements are needed to ensure that the boxes are isolating boxes. There are three main methods for certifying a real root: Miranda theorem with Jacobian test, the interval Newton method, and the α𝛼\\alpha-theory. Miranda theorem 9 and its practical version MK test 5 3 2 is used for checking the existence of a real zero of a system inside a box. The MK test works well for linear systems 2.\nJacobian test  is used for certifying that a system has at most one real zero inside a box, so does the methods in 7. Thus, the termination of the subdivision method based on the MK test and Jacobian test is guaranteed in a theoretical sense for square systems with simple roots.\nWhen MK test is used for systems with more than two variables, it seldom succeeds which can also be found in our experiments. We also analyze the reason in the experiments section.\nBesides that, the interval Newton method 4 1 7 and α𝛼\\alpha-theory 0 can work for testing the uniqueness and existence of the complex (or real) zeros. The interval Newton method can verify that a box is an isolating box. In 1 2 5 8, the authors use the interval Newton method for real root finding. But the termination of the method is not ensured for certifying a box containing a simple zero or not by successive subdivision. Since an isolating box of a square system may not satisfy the existence and uniqueness condition, the termination condition of subdivision is absent. Thus the theory for root isolation of equation systems based on interval Newton method is not complete even for systems with only simple roots. The α𝛼\\alpha-theory is slightly different from the other two methods, which computes derivatives with high orders, and the verified domain of α𝛼\\alpha-theory is a ball, not a box. Similar as the interval Newton method, the termination of the α𝛼\\alpha-theory method for root isolation of a square system is also not complete. In 8, the authors present the concept of the α𝛼\\alpha-inclusion box and use it for seeking the real roots of a square system. In , we presented a new method which was based on the geometrical property, the so-called orthogonal monotonicity inside a box for a bivariate polynomial system to certify the existence and uniqueness of a real root inside the box. We used bounding polynomials to exclude the regions which contained no roots. The termination of the method is guaranteed. Thus it can be used for real root isolation inside a box containing only simple real zeros. The method was extended to bivariate nonlinear systems in the journal version 5. We extend the method to general zero-dimensional equation systems in this paper. In this paper, we present a new existence criterion of a simple real root of a zero-dimensional square system inside a box, which is much easier to succeed than Miranda based criterion. Based on the new criterion, we propose an algorithm to isolate the real roots of a zero-dimensional real nonlinear square system F=(f1,…,fn)𝐹subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑛F=(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{n}) inside a given box B=[a1,b1]×…×[an,bn]𝐵subscript𝑎1subscript𝑏1…subscript𝑎𝑛subscript𝑏𝑛B=[a_{1},b_{1}]\\times\\ldots\\times[a_{n},b_{n}], where fisubscript𝑓𝑖f_{i} and ∂fi∂xjsubscript𝑓𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗\\frac{\\partial f_{i}}{\\partial x_{j}} are well defined in B𝐵B for 1≤i,j≤nformulae-sequence1𝑖𝑗𝑛1\\leq i,j\\leq n. In order to analyze the roots of the system locally inside a box, we give the concept of the opposite monotone system (O-M system for short) in an n−limit-from𝑛n-D box and give a criterion to check the existence and uniqueness of a simple real zero of the given system in the given box based on properties of the opposite monotone system. Though the O-M system is firstly presented in  for 2-D case (It is called orthogonal monotone in ), the O-M condition for n𝑛n-D systems are more complicated than that for 2-D systems. Simply speaking, for a system F𝐹F and an n𝑛n-D box B𝐵B, we transform locally the original system F𝐹F into a new system G=(g1,…,gn)𝐺subscript𝑔1…subscript𝑔𝑛G=(g_{1},\\ldots,g_{n}) with the same zeros as F𝐹F such that the curve S=𝕍​(g1,…,gn−1)𝑆𝕍subscript𝑔1…subscript𝑔𝑛1S={\\mathbb{V}}(g_{1},\\ldots,g_{n-1}) is monotone in B𝐵B and S𝑆S intersects transversally with the hypersurface 𝕍​(gn)𝕍subscript𝑔𝑛{\\mathbb{V}}(g_{n}) in B𝐵B (see Definition 3). The evaluation of the functions of the tangent vector of S𝑆S on B𝐵B does not contain zeros ensures its monotonicity inside B𝐵B. The direction of the tangent vector of S𝑆S and the normal vector of 𝕍​(gn)𝕍subscript𝑔𝑛{\\mathbb{V}}(g_{n}) are almost identical or opposite when evaluating on B𝐵B, which ensures the uniqueness of the root inside B𝐵B. The existence of a real zero of G𝐺G inside the box B𝐵B can be determined by the change of the signs of the evaluations of gnsubscript𝑔𝑛g_{n} on the two endpoints of S𝑆S which are the intersection of S𝑆S and the boundaries of B𝐵B. Some local transformation techniques in MK test 3 2 are modified and used in our method. The new system in MK test is JF​(mB)−1​FTsubscript𝐽𝐹superscriptsubscript𝑚𝐵1superscript𝐹𝑇J_{F}(m_{B})^{-1}F^{T}, here JF​(mB)−1subscript𝐽𝐹superscriptsubscript𝑚𝐵1J_{F}(m_{B})^{-1} is the inverse of the Jacobian matrix of F𝐹F at the middle point of B𝐵B and FTsuperscript𝐹𝑇F^{T} is the transpose of F𝐹F. In our method, G=U​JF​(mB)−1​FT𝐺𝑈subscript𝐽𝐹superscriptsubscript𝑚𝐵1superscript𝐹𝑇G=U\\,J_{F}(m_{B})^{-1}F^{T}, where U𝑈U is an invertible matrix under some requirements.\nWe prove that the termination of the subdivision process for finding all simple real zeros of a system inside a box. So our method is complete for real root isolation of a square nonlinear system inside a bounded box. Since the existence condition based on the opposite monotone method is used recursively, we revise the original conditions for the opposite monotone system and propose the concept of the strong monotone (S-M) system to avoid constructing opposite monotone systems repeatedly.\nFor boxes which contain multiple real zeros of systems, our method is invalid, thus we give a terminate precision for subdivision process. Therefore, we may get some suspected boxes which reach the terminate precision and do not satisfy the conditions of our method. We give a heuristic verification method to deal with those suspected boxes. Based on our theory, we design an algorithm to isolate the real zeros of a multivariate equation system. We also analyze the complexity of our algorithm.\nWe implement our algorithm in C++. Our experiments show the effectivity and efficiency of our method. We compare our method with some existing methods and analyze some aspects of the methods. Notice that our method can be used for complex root isolation since a complex nonlinear system can be transformed into a real nonlinear system.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We introduce some notations and preliminaries in the next section. In Section 3, we give the concepts of O-M system and S-M system in a box and prove the uniqueness and existence theorem, then we show how to match the uniqueness and existence conditions for a given system and a given box. The algorithm of the method is also given in this section. The complexity analysis is also given there. In Section 4,\nsome experiment results are given and an analysis based on the results is shown. We draw a conclusion in the last section."
