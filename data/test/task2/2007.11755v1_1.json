    "related work": "RNN-based human motion prediction.  RNNs have proven highly successful in sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks  . As such, they have been widely employed for human motion prediction [ref]5   .\nFor instance, Fragkiadaki et al. [ref]5 proposed an Encoder-Recurrent-Decoder (ERD) model that incorporates a non-linear multi-layer feedforward network to encode and decode motion before and after recurrent layers. To avoid error accumulation, curriculum learning was adopted during training. In , Jain et al. introduced a Structural-RNN model relying on a manually-designed spatio-temporal graph to encode motion history.\nThe fixed structure of this graph, however, restricts the flexibility of this approach at modeling long-range spatial relationships between different limbs. To improve motion estimation, Martinez et al.  proposed a residual-based model that predicts velocities instead of poses. Furthermore, it was shown in this work that a simple zero-velocity baseline, i.e., constantly predicting the last observed pose, led to better performance than [ref]5 . While this led to better performance than the previous pose-based methods, the predictions produced by the RNN still suffer from discontinuities between the observed poses and predicted ones.\nTo overcome this, Gui et al. proposed to adopt adversarial training to generate smooth sequences . In , Ruiz et al. treat human motion prediction as a tensor inpainting problem and exploit a generative adversarial network for long-term prediction. While this approach further improves performance, the use of an adversarial classifier notoriously complicates training , making it challenging to deploy on new datasets. Feed-forward methods and long motion history encoding.\nIn view of the drawbacks of RNNs, several works considered feed-forward networks as an alternative solution  7 0. In particular, in , Butepage et al. introduced a fully-connected network to process the recent pose history, investigating different strategies to encode temporal historical information via convolutions and exploiting the kinematic tree to encode spatial information. However, similar to , and as discussed in 7, the use of a fixed tree structure does not reflect the motion synchronization across different, potentially distant, human body parts. To capture such dependencies, Li et al. 7 built a convolutional sequence-to-sequence model processing a two-dimensional pose matrix whose columns represent the pose at every time step. This model was then used to extract a prior from long-term motion history, which, in conjunction with the more recent motion history, was used as input to an autoregressive network for future pose prediction. While more effective than the RNN-based frameworks, the manually-selected size of the convolutional window highly influences the temporal encoding. Our work is inspired by that of Mao et al.  0, who showed that encoding the short-term history in frequency space using the DCT, followed by a GCN to encode spatial and temporal connections led to state-of-the-art performance for human motion prediction up to 1s. As acknowledged by Mao et al. 0, however, encoding long-term history in DCT yields an overly-general motion representation, leading to worse performance than using short-term history. In this paper, we overcome this drawback by introducing a motion attention based approach to human motion prediction. This allows us to capture the motion recurrence in the long-term history. Furthermore, in contrast to 7, whose encoding of past motions depends on the manually-defined size of the temporal convolution filters, our model dynamically adapts its history-based representation to the context of the current prediction. Attention models for human motion prediction. While attention-based neural networks are commonly employed for machine translation  , their use for human motion prediction remains largely unexplored.\nThe work of Tang et al.  constitutes the only exception, incorporating an attention module to summarize the recent pose history, followed by an RNN-based prediction network. This work, however, uses frame-wise pose-based attention, which may lead to ambiguous motion, because static poses do not provide information about the motion direction and similar poses occur in significantly different motions. To overcome this, we propose to leverage motion attention. As evidenced by our experiments, this, combined with a feed-forward prediction network, allows us to outperform the state-of-the-art motion prediction frameworks."
