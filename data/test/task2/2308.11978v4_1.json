    "experimental setup": "We use the ZINC-250k  dataset for both pre-training and fine-tuning proposed models for its pharmaceutical relevance, moderate size, and popularity. All molecules are presented in the kekulised form with hydrogen removed. ZINC-250k contains around 250,000 drug-like molecules with 9 atom types and 3 edge types, and with a maximum graph size of 38 sampled from the ZINC database. The molecules in ZINC are readily synthesisable molecules: it contains over 120 million purchasable “drug-like” compounds—effectively all organic molecules that are for sale—a quarter of which are available for immediate delivery. Other datasets, such as QM9  (a subset of GDB9 ), contain, at least to some degree, virtual molecules that are likely to be synthesisable but have not been made yet, including many molecules with complex annulated ring systems 6. In addition, the original works of GCPN, GraphAF, GraphEBM and the benchmark 0 we used to compare graph generative models have also been trained on ZINC-250k. Thus, ZINC-250k is well-suited for models to learn representations of drug-like and synthesisable molecules in de-novo molecule generation. We use the open-source platform TorchDrug [ref]26 and DIG  in dataset preparation and graph generative models training. Advanced GNNs are implemented in PyTorch  in the MPNN framework aligned with TorchDrug [ref]26. The basic architectures of GCPN and GraphAF are implemented in TorchDrug. Note that the original GraphAF cannot allow GNN module to aggregate edge features in the message-passing mechanism, since the intermediate molecular graph generated by the autoregressive flow doesn’t contain edge features. Therefore, we propose an improved version of GraphAF considering edge features, named GraphAF+e. To conduct a fairly analogous evaluation on GCPN, we considered GCPN without considering edge features, named GCPN–e. A detailed description of how to incorporate edge features is in Appendix D. The basic architectures of GraphEBM are implemented in DIG . In the experiments, we replace R-GCN in GCPN (both with and without edge features), GraphAF (both with and without edge features), and GraphEBM with six more expressive GNNs: GIN , GAT , GATv2 , PNA , GSN  and GearNet . We set all GNNs in the experiments to have 3 hidden layers with batch normalisation  and ReLU  activation applied after each layer. We find little improvement when further adding GCN layers. Each GNN uses a linear layer to transform the edge features in the graph to a hidden embedding, and concatenates with the node features for message passing. In addition, they use sum as the READOUT function for graph representations. For PNA and GSN, the MESSAGE and UPDATE functions are parameterised by linear layers. For GSN, we set the graph substructure set to contain cyclic graphs of sizes between 3 and 8 (both inclusive), which are some of the most important substructures in molecules . For GAT and GATv2, we use multi-head attention with k=3𝑘3k=3 after a manual grid search for attention heads. The autoregressive generative models (GCPN and GraphAF), with all different GNNs, are pre-trained on the ZINC-250k dataset for 1 epoch, as we do not observe too much performance gain from increasing pre-training epochs. They are then fine-tuned towards the target properties with RL, using the proximal policy optimisation (PPO) algorithm . The models are fine-tuned for 5 epochs for all goal-directed generation tasks with early stopping if all generation results in one batch collapse to singleton molecules. We set the agent update interval for GCPN and GraphAF models to update their RL agents every 3 and 5 batches respectively, as considering the cost of computing resources. During generating process, we allow our RL agents in all models to make 20 resamplings on the intermediate generated graphs if they cannot generate chemically valid molecular graphs. The max graph size is set as 48 empirically. For GCPN, the collection of proposed scaffold subgraphs C𝐶C for GCPN are sampled from non-overlapping scaffolds in the ZINC-250k dataset. For GraphAF, we define multivariate Gaussian as our base distribution and use node MLPs and edge MLPs which have two fully-connected layers equipped with tanh non-linearity to generate the nodes and edges respectively. We notice limited improvements in performance when increasing the number of MLP layers. Adam  is used as the optimiser for both pre-training and fine-tuning tasks. Reward temperature for each metric, the number of neurons in each hidden layer and the learning rate for fine-tuning) for each model on each task through grid search by Optuna  independently. In the one-shot generative models (GraphEBM), with all different GNNs, we adopt an energy network of L=3𝐿3L=3 layers with hidden dimension d=64𝑑64d=64 for each GNN. For training, we tune the following hyperparameters: the sample step K𝐾K of Langevin dynamics, the standard deviation of the added noise in Langevin dynamics σ𝜎\\sigma and the step size λ𝜆\\lambda. All models are trained for up to 20 epochs. In addition, we clip the gradient used in Langevin dynamics so that its value magnitude can be less than 0.01. The experiments were run with a mix of NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 40GB memory and NVIDIA V100 GPUs with 16GB memory. The total amount of training time for all GCPN, GraphAF and GraphEBM variants under all metrics is around 1650 GPU hours. All details are provided in Appendix D. We compare our proposed models based on the original GCPN (both with and without edge features), GraphAF (both with and without edge features), and GraphEBM on six goal-directed molecule generation tasks: Penalised logP , QED , synthetic accessibility (SA) , DRD2 , Median1 and Median2. All generation metrics are taken from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC) . Due to the practicality of de-novo molecule design, we only consider the single generation objective for all generation tasks. Specifically, SA stands for how hard or how easy it is to synthesise a given molecule. Penalised logP is a logP score that also accounts for ring size and SA, while QED is an indicator of drug-likeness. DRD2 is derived from a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a Gaussian kernel fitting experimental data to predict the bioactivities against their corresponding disease targets. Median1  measures the average score of the molecule’s Tanimoto similarity  to Camphor and Menthol. Median2  measures the average score of the molecule’s Tanimoto similarity to Tadalafil and Sildenafil. Penalised logP has an unbounded range, while QED, DRD2, Median1, Median2 and SA have a range of  01  by definition. Higher scores in Penalised logP, QED, DRD2, Median1 and Median2 and a lower score in SA are desired. Note that all scores are calculated from empirical prediction models. We choose to use DRD2, Median1 and Median2 to evaluate generative models, since they are mature and representative generative metrics 0 6. In addition, some other metrics are data-missing or inappropriate and thus cannot reflect the ability of generative models properly. For example, GSK3 cannot evaluate all the generated molecules; multi-property objectives (MPO) measure the geometric means of several scores, which will be 0 if one of the scores is 0; Valsartan Smarts is implemented incorrectly in TDC: it computes the geometric means of several scores instead of arithmetic means of several scores, which lead to incorrect results in the benchmark 0. We compare the best GCPN variant, GraphAF variant, and GraphEBM variant with eight state-of-the-art approaches for molecule generation 0 on 6 generation metrics: Penalised logP, SA, DRD2, Median1, Median2 and QED. All results of baselines are taken from original papers unless stated."
