    "introduction": "Shortest paths computation is one of the most fundamental graph problems, and as such it has been studied extensively in various computational models. In this work we consider the problem of approximating shortest path distances in the Congested Clique model of distributed computing . This model attracts an increasing amount of attention over the last decade, due to its relation to practical parallel models such as MapReduce  and k𝑘k-machines .\nThe fast evolution of shortest path algorithms in the Congested Clique model\n   [ref]2       [ref]3 is characterized by two main mile-stones. In their influential work , Censor-Hillel et al. presented the first efficient algorithm for fast matrix multiplication in the Congested Clique model, and demonstrated its applicability for exact distance computation.\nSpecifically, they gave an O​(n0.158)𝑂superscript𝑛0.158O(n^{0.158})-round algorithm for computing all-pairs shortest paths (APSP) in unweighted undirected APSP. For weighted and directed graphs, they showed an O​(n0.158)𝑂superscript𝑛0.158O(n^{0.158})-round algorithm for (1+o​(1))1𝑜1(1+o(1))-approximate APSP, and an O~​(n1/3)~𝑂superscript𝑛13\\widetilde{O}(n^{1/3})-round algorithm for exact APSP. In a follow-up work, Le Gall \nextended this algebraic framework, and improved the complexity of exact APSP to O​(n0.2096)𝑂superscript𝑛0.2096O(n^{0.2096}) rounds for weighted directed graphs with constant weights. Izumi and Le Gall showed that using quantum computing, the complexity of APSP can be improved to O~​(n1/4)~𝑂superscript𝑛14\\tilde{O}(n^{1/4}) for weighted directed graphs .\nCensor-Hillel, Leitersdorf and Turner  showed improved algorithms for sparse matrix multiplication. In particular, their algorithm multiplies two n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n matrices, each with O​(n3/2)𝑂superscript𝑛32O(n^{3/2}) non-zero entries, within constant number of rounds. This led to an exact APSP computation in O​(D⋅(m/n)1/3)𝑂⋅𝐷superscript𝑚𝑛13O(D\\cdot(m/n)^{1/3}) rounds where D𝐷D is the (unweighted) diameter of the n𝑛n-vertex graph and m𝑚m is the number of edges. The above mentioned algorithms are all based on matrix multiplication.\nAn alternative natural approach for approximating APSP is obtained by the notion of multiplicative spanners, namely, sparse subgraphs that preserve all distances up to a small multiplicative stretch.\nSpecifically, by computing a sparse k𝑘k-spanner in the graph, and collecting its edges at each vertex, one immediately gets\na k𝑘k-approximation for the APSP problem. Note, however, that due to the size vs. stretch tradeoff of multiplicative spanners, in poly-logarithmic time, the approximation value k𝑘k is at least logarithmic.\nThe problem of obtaining O​(1)𝑂1O(1) distance approximation in poly-logarithmic time was left widely open until the recent works of [ref]2 and . By using the ingenious method of continuous optimization , Becker et al. [ref]2 presented the first poly-logarithmic algorithm for the (1+ϵ)1italic-ϵ(1+\\epsilon)-approximate single-source shortest paths (SSSP) problem in weighted undirected graphs. The starting point of their algorithms is based on the O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n)-approximation provided by spanners. This approximation is then iteratively improved by applying a tailored gradient descent procedure. Their algorithms also have the additional benefit of being implemented in the more stringent Broadcast Congested Clique model111In this model, each vertex is limited to send the same message to all other vertices in a given round.. In a very recent work, Censor-Hillel et al. [ref]3 presented poly-logarithmic time solutions for the more general problems of approximate multi-source shortest paths (MSSP) and APSP. In particular, among other results, they showed an O​(log2⁡n/ϵ)𝑂superscript2𝑛italic-ϵO(\\log^{2}n/\\epsilon)-round algorithm for the (2+ϵ)2italic-ϵ(2+\\epsilon)-approximate APSP problem in unweighted undirected graphs, an O​(log2⁡n/ϵ)𝑂superscript2𝑛italic-ϵO(\\log^{2}n/\\epsilon)-round algorithm for (3+ϵ)3italic-ϵ(3+\\epsilon)-approximate APSP in weighted undirected graphs; as well as O​(log2⁡n/ϵ)𝑂superscript2𝑛italic-ϵO(\\log^{2}n/\\epsilon)-round algorithm for the MSSP problem in weighted undirected graphs with respect to O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(\\sqrt{n}) sources. The approach of [ref]3 is based on a clever reduction to sparse matrix multiplication algorithms from  [ref]3. This reduction is not immediate, for the following reason. The basic approach of using matrix multiplications to compute distances is based on starting with the input matrix of the graph A𝐴A and then iteratively square it O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log{n}) times.\nEven if the original graph is sparse (e.g., with O​(n3/2)𝑂superscript𝑛32O(n^{3/2}) edges), a single multiplication step might already result in a dense matrix. Since one needs to apply O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) multiplication steps, it is required to sparsify the intermediate matrices as well. To overcome this barrier, [ref]3 developed a rich tool-kit for distance computation, that includes hopset constructions, fast computation of the k𝑘k-nearest neighbours and more. The poly-logarithmic time complexity appears to be a natural barrier in the matrix multiplications based algorithms, from the following reason. Basically these algorithms work in iterations, where in iteration i𝑖i, vertices learn about paths that have at most 2isuperscript2𝑖2^{i} edges, hence Ω​(log⁡n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(\\log n) iterations seem to be required in order to capture shortest paths with polynomial number of hops.\nIn this paper we ask if this barrier is indeed fundamental.\n Is it possible to provide (1+ϵ)1italic-ϵ(1+\\epsilon)-approximation for SSSP and (2+ϵ)2italic-ϵ(2+\\epsilon)-approximation for APSP in o​(log⁡n)𝑜𝑛o(\\log n) rounds? Another plausible explanation for viewing the logarithmic time complexity as a natural barrier comes from the following observation.\nThe current state-of-the-art bound of many graph problems in the Congested Clique model is bounded from below by the\nlogarithm of their respective Local time complexities222In the Local model, only vertices that are neighbors in the input graph can communicate in a given round. The messages are allowed to be of unbounded size.. In the more restrictive, yet quite related model of MPC, this limitation was conditionally proven by Ghaffari, Kuhn and Uitto . Since the locality of the shortest path problem is linear, we reach again to the barrier of O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) rounds. Another interesting question left by [ref]3 is whether is it possible to design efficient algorithms for additive or near-additive approximation for APSP. Here, the goal is to get an estimate δ​(u,v)𝛿𝑢𝑣\\delta(u,v) for the distance between u𝑢u and v𝑣v such that δ​(u,v)≤(1+ϵ)​d​(u,v)+β𝛿𝑢𝑣1italic-ϵ𝑑𝑢𝑣𝛽\\delta(u,v)\\leq(1+\\epsilon)d(u,v)+\\beta for some small β𝛽\\beta. Note that such guarantee is closer to (1+ϵ)1italic-ϵ(1+\\epsilon)-approximation for long enough paths, which is much better than a multiplicative (2+ϵ)2italic-ϵ(2+\\epsilon)-approximation, which raises the following question. Can we get near-additive approximation for APSP in sub-polynomial time? We answer both questions in the affirmative by devising a unified tool for computing nearly-additive approximate distances in missingp​o​l​y​(log⁡log⁡n)missing𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑛\\mathop{\\mathrm{missing}}{poly}(\\log\\log n) rounds. This immediately solves Question 2. To address Question 1,\nour approach is based on a mixture of the two current approaches for distance computation, namely, graph sparsification and matrix multiplications.\nWe start by describing our results, and then elaborate on our approach."
