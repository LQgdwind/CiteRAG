    "introduction": "When building a model for probabilistic inference we may not only want to take into account\nproperties and relations which are uncertain and described by (conditional) probabilities,\nbut also “background information” that is certain.\nA common kind of background information is information about a hierarchical structure,\nand such information can be described by a tree.\nAs an example of a tree that represents a hierarchical structure, consider a tree in which the children of the\nroot represent some communities, where the children of a community represent subcommunities, and\nthe children of a subcommunity represent individuals.\nThe height of this hierarchy, or tree, is 3 (or 4, depending on our conventions).\nBut the number of individuals in even the smallest subcommunity that we consider may be much larger than 3.\nThis article considers hierarchical background information represented by a tree such that\nthe height of the tree is very much smaller than the minimal number of children of a nonleaf of the tree. On top of the background information, represented by the example tree described above, we may consider information\nthat is given by (conditional) probabilities and is formally\nrepresented by (parametrized) 0/1-valued (i.e. false/true-valued) random variables.\nSo we may have random variables (also viewed as atomic logical formulas) P1​(x)subscript𝑃1𝑥P_{1}(x), P2​(x)subscript𝑃2𝑥P_{2}(x), and P3​(x)subscript𝑃3𝑥P_{3}(x),\nrepresenting some property that a community, subcommunity, respectively, individual, may have.\nThe probability that a subcommunity has the property P2subscript𝑃2P_{2} may (for example) depend on whether the community which it is part of has\nproperty P1subscript𝑃1P_{1}. Or alternatively, the probability that a community has P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} may depend on the proportion of its\nsubcommunities that have P2subscript𝑃2P_{2} (and/or the proportion of individuals in the community that have P3subscript𝑃3P_{3}).\nWe may also have a random variable R​(x,y)𝑅𝑥𝑦R(x,y), representing some relationship between objects, for example\nthe perception (good/bad) that x𝑥x has of y𝑦y. Now, for an individual x𝑥x, the probability that R​(x,y)𝑅𝑥𝑦R(x,y) holds may\ndepend on properties of the (sub)community that x𝑥x belongs to and on properties of y𝑦y and/or its (sub)community;\nit may also depend on whether x𝑥x and y𝑦y belong to the same (sub)community. Such uncertain, or probabilistic, information as exemplified above can be represented by a so-called (parametrized/lifted)\nProbabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) based on the background knowledge represented by the tree.\n(For introductions or surveys about PGMs, a tool in machine learning and statistical relational artifical intelligence, see for example\n   .)\nA (parametrized/lifted) PGM consists partly of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), the vertices of which are (parametrized/lifted)\nrandom variables.\nThe arcs/arrows of the DAG describes the (in)dependencies between the random variables, by stipulating that\na random variable (a vertex of the DAG), say R𝑅R, is independent from all other vertices of the DAG, conditioned\non knowing the states (true/false) of the parents of R𝑅R in the DAG.\nIn the setup of this article a parametrized random variable will be identified with a relation symbol in the sense of formal logic.\nSo in the example above the vertex set of the DAG would be {P1,P2,P3,R}subscript𝑃1subscript𝑃2subscript𝑃3𝑅\\{P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},R\\},\nwhere P1,P2,P3,Rsubscript𝑃1subscript𝑃2subscript𝑃3𝑅P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},R are relation symbols, and its arcs would\ndescribe the (conditional) (in)dependencies between the vertices. So far, nothing has been said about how to express (conditional) probabilities in a PGM and, indeed, there are\ndifferent ways of doing it.\nIt turns out that a general way of doing it is to use some sort of “probability logic”,\nas was first done (as far as we know) in the contex of PGMs by Jaeger in .\nHere we will use a logic which we call P​L​A∗𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴PLA^{*},\nfor probability logic with aggregation functions\n(Definition 3.4)\nto describe (conditional) probabilities associated to the relation symbols of the DAG of a PGM. (The ‘∗*’ in P​L​A∗𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴PLA^{*} just\nindicates that it is a more general variant of earlier versions of P​L​A𝑃𝐿𝐴PLA considered\nby Koponen and Weitkämper in 1 2.)\nThe resulting type of PGM will be called a P​L​A∗𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴PLA^{*}-network\n(Definition 6.8). P​L​A∗𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴PLA^{*} is a logic such that the (truth) values of its formulas can be any number in the unit interval   ,\nso it is suitable for expressing probabilities.\nP​L​A∗𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴PLA^{*} achieves this partly by considering every c∈ 𝑐01c\\in  as an atomic formula, and partly\nby using aggregation functions which take finite sequences of reals in    as input and outputs a\nreal number in   .\nAn example of an aggregation function is the\narithmetic mean, or average, which returns the average of a finite sequence of reals in the unit interval.\nSo for example, if R𝑅R is a unary relation symbol then there is a P​L​A∗𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴PLA^{*}-formula (without free variables) such that\nits value is the proportion of elements in the domain which satisfy R​(x)𝑅𝑥R(x).\nSince the aggregation functions maximum and minimum are available there is a P​L​A∗𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴PLA^{*} formula which\nexpresses that at least one (alternatively all) element in the domain satisfies R​(x)𝑅𝑥R(x).\nBy using the aggregation functions maximum and minimum one can show that every query on finite structures\nwhich can be expressed by a first-order formula can be expressed by a P​L​A∗𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴PLA^{*}-formula\n(Lemma 3.13).\nHence, P​L​A∗𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴PLA^{*} subsumes first-order logic.\nFor a formula φ​(x1,…,xk)𝜑subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑘\\varphi(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{k}) of P​L​A∗𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴PLA^{*}, finite structure 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} (with matching signature/vocabulary),\nand a1,…,ak∈Asubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑘𝐴a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\in A,\nwe let 𝒜​(φ​(a1,…,ak))𝒜𝜑subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑘\\mathcal{A}(\\varphi(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k})) denote the value of φ​(a1,…,ak)𝜑subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑘\\varphi(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}) in 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}. The precise way that we will mathematically represent the kind of probabilistic (or uncertain) information described above\ntogether with some background information, in the form of a tree, is as follows.\nWe let ΔΔ\\Delta be a fixed positive integer and we let 𝒯nsubscript𝒯𝑛\\mathcal{T}_{n}, where n𝑛n is a positive integer, be a tree\nwith maximum height ΔΔ\\Delta that represents the hierarchical background information.\nSince we are interested in what happens for (arbitrarily) large trees where nonleaves have many children, we assume\nthat, for every positive integer k𝑘k, if n𝑛n is large enough then every nonleaf in 𝒯nsubscript𝒯𝑛\\mathcal{T}_{n} has at least k𝑘k children.\nEach 𝒯nsubscript𝒯𝑛\\mathcal{T}_{n} can be represented by a first-order τ𝜏\\tau-structure where τ={E}𝜏𝐸\\tau=\\{E\\} and E𝐸E is a binary\nrelation symbol of arity 2.\nThen let σ𝜎\\sigma be a finite relational signature that includes τ𝜏\\tau.\nIn the example above we have σ={E,P1,P2,P3,R}𝜎𝐸subscript𝑃1subscript𝑃2subscript𝑃3𝑅\\sigma=\\{E,P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},R\\}.\nThen let 𝐖nsubscript𝐖𝑛\\mathbf{W}_{n} be the set of all expansions of 𝒯nsubscript𝒯𝑛\\mathcal{T}_{n} to σ𝜎\\sigma,\nwhere we think of each such expansion 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} as a “possible world”, and let ℙnsubscriptℙ𝑛\\mathbb{P}_{n} be the probability distribution\non 𝐖nsubscript𝐖𝑛\\mathbf{W}_{n} induced by a P​L​A∗​(σ)𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴𝜎PLA^{*}(\\sigma)-network 𝔾𝔾\\mathbb{G} as defined in\nDefinition 6.9 . So given a sequence 𝐓=(𝒯n:n∈ℕ+)\\mathbf{T}=(\\mathcal{T}_{n}:n\\in\\mathbb{N}^{+}) of trees (of the described kind) and a P​L​A∗​(σ)𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴𝜎PLA^{*}(\\sigma)-network 𝔾𝔾\\mathbb{G},\nwe have a precise mathematical setting of computing the probability of\na query (event) on 𝐖nsubscript𝐖𝑛\\mathbf{W}_{n} that can be expressed by a P​L​A∗𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴PLA^{*}-formula.\nThe probability of a query depends on both on the hierarchical information given by 𝒯nsubscript𝒯𝑛\\mathcal{T}_{n} and by 𝔾𝔾\\mathbb{G}.\nHowever, if we use the brute force way of computing the probability of a query, namely that\nwe compute the probability of every structure in 𝐖nsubscript𝐖𝑛\\mathbf{W}_{n} in which the query is true\nand then add all such probabilities, then the time needed for the computation will be\nexponential in the number of vertices of the\ntree 𝒯nsubscript𝒯𝑛\\mathcal{T}_{n}.\nIn other words, the brute force method of computing the probability of a query does not scale well to large trees 𝒯nsubscript𝒯𝑛\\mathcal{T}_{n}.\nThis motivates the search for other methods of computing, or estimating, the probability of a query in the described context. In this article we identify certain conditions on the sequence of trees 𝐓=(𝒯n:n∈ℕ+)\\mathbf{T}=(\\mathcal{T}_{n}:n\\in\\mathbb{N}^{+})\n(the stronger Assumption 6.3 and the milder Assumption 8.3), certain conditions on the P​L​A∗​(σ)𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴𝜎PLA^{*}(\\sigma)-network 𝔾𝔾\\mathbb{G} used for defining a probability distribution on 𝐖nsubscript𝐖𝑛\\mathbf{W}_{n},\nroughly meaning that all aggregation functions used in the formulas associated to 𝔾𝔾\\mathbb{G} satisfy a continuity property, such that if φ​(x1,…,xk)𝜑subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑘\\varphi(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{k}) (with free variables x1,…,xksubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑘x_{1},\\ldots,x_{k}) is a P​L​A∗​(σ)𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴𝜎PLA^{*}(\\sigma)-formula\nin which all aggregation functions satisfy the continuity property, then there is a simpler, “closure-basic”,\nformula, say ψ​(x1,…,xk)𝜓subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑘\\psi(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{k}), such that,\nfor all n𝑛n and a1,…,ak∈Tnsubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑘subscript𝑇𝑛a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\in T_{n}, the truth value of ψ​(a1,…,ak)𝜓subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑘\\psi(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}) in every structure 𝒜∈𝐖n𝒜subscript𝐖𝑛\\mathcal{A}\\in\\mathbf{W}_{n}\ncan be evaluated by using only (the fixed information defining) 𝐓𝐓\\mathbf{T}, 𝔾𝔾\\mathbb{G}, ψ𝜓\\psi, and\nthe (bounded number of) ancestors of a1,…,aksubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑘a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k} in 𝒯nsubscript𝒯𝑛\\mathcal{T}_{n}, and for every ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, if n𝑛n is large enough, then, with probability at least 1−ε1𝜀1-\\varepsilon\n(with the distribution induced by 𝔾𝔾\\mathbb{G}),\nthe values of φ​(a1,…,ak)𝜑subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑘\\varphi(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}) and ψ​(a1,…,ak)𝜓subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑘\\psi(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}) differ by at most ε𝜀\\varepsilon.\n(We will say that φ𝜑\\varphi and ψ𝜓\\psi are asymptotically equivalent.) This intuitively means that, for large enough n𝑛n, with high probability the value of φ​(a1,…,ak)𝜑subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑘\\varphi(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k})\nis approximated (with as good accuracy as we like) by the value of \nψ​(a1,…,ak)𝜓subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑘\\psi(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}) for all vertices a1,…,aksubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑘a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k} in the tree 𝒯nsubscript𝒯𝑛\\mathcal{T}_{n}.\nMoreover, under the same conditions (1)–(3),\none can find such ψ𝜓\\psi by using only φ𝜑\\varphi, 𝐓𝐓\\mathbf{T} and 𝔾𝔾\\mathbb{G},\nso the time needed to compute the approximation is independent of n𝑛n, that is, of the size of the tree 𝒯nsubscript𝒯𝑛\\mathcal{T}_{n}.\nA corollary of the above result is that (under the same conditions)\nwe get a convergence law for P​L​A∗𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴PLA^{*}-formulas, which of course has to be\nsuitably formulated in the context of many-valued formulas and\ntrees as “background”, or “base”, structures.\nAll three conditions (1)–(3) are necessary for the conclusions described to hold, as we will show. The main results, stated in Section 8.1, have the general form described above.\nWe first prove Theorem 8.1.\nThen we make some observations which allow us to easily obtain some corollaries which are variations of Theorem 8.1.\nThe essence of these corollaries is (i) that if we consider stronger assumptions on the P​L​A∗​(σ)𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴𝜎PLA^{*}(\\sigma)-network 𝔾𝔾\\mathbb{G}\n(i.e. less general probability distributions), then we get results that apply to more queries,\nand (ii) if we loosen the assumptions on the sequence of trees 𝐓𝐓\\mathbf{T} then we get results that apply to less,\nbut still interesting, queries. Related work.\nInstead of bounding the height of the trees, as we do in this article, one could consider trees with a bound on the\nnumber of children that vertices may have.\nSuch sequences of trees are covered by the (more general) context considered by Koponen in 0,\nwhere probability distributions where defined by P​L​A∗​(σ)𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴𝜎PLA^{*}(\\sigma)-networks and queries by P​L​A∗𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴PLA^{*}-formulas.\nOther work that we are aware of on logical convergence laws, and related issues, in the setting of\nexpansions of “base structures” uses first-order logic\n(or L∞,ωωsuperscriptsubscript𝐿𝜔𝜔L_{\\infty,\\omega}^{\\omega}) as the query language.\nBaldwin  and Shelah  considered a base sequence where each ℬnsubscriptℬ𝑛\\mathcal{B}_{n} is a directed path of length n𝑛n.\nIn both cases 𝐖nsubscript𝐖𝑛\\mathbf{W}_{n} consists of all expansions of ℬnsubscriptℬ𝑛\\mathcal{B}_{n} to a new binary relation symbol R𝑅R interpreted as an irreflexive\nand symmetric relation.\nIn  the probability distribution on 𝐖nsubscript𝐖𝑛\\mathbf{W}_{n} is defined by letting an R​(x,y)𝑅𝑥𝑦R(x,y) be true with probability\nn−αsuperscript𝑛𝛼n^{-\\alpha} for some irrational α∈(0,1)𝛼01\\alpha\\in(0,1), independently of whether it is true for other pairs.\nIn  the probability of R​(x,y)𝑅𝑥𝑦R(x,y) is d−αsuperscript𝑑𝛼d^{-\\alpha} where d𝑑d is the distance in ℬnsubscriptℬ𝑛\\mathcal{B}_{n} between x𝑥x and y𝑦y\nand α∈(0,1)𝛼01\\alpha\\in(0,1) is irrational.\nLynch [25, Corollary 2.16] and later\nAbu Zaid, Dawar, Grädel and Pakusa  and Dawar, Grädel and Hoelzel 0\nconsidered the context where ℬnsubscriptℬ𝑛\\mathcal{B}_{n} is a product of finite cyclic groups and the probability distribution considered is the uniform one.\nAhlman and Koponen  considered base structures ℬnsubscriptℬ𝑛\\mathcal{B}_{n} with a (nicely behaved)\npregeometry and a probability distribution defined by a kind of stochastic block model where the “blocks” correspond to subspaces.\nLynch 5 formulated a condition (k𝑘k-extendibility) that makes sense for base sequences 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} in general\nand which guarantees that a\nconvergence law holds for first-order logic and the uniform probability distribution. Besides this article and 0,\nother studies that use a a PGM for generating a probability distribution and that prove some result about asymptic probabilities\ndo not consider background information in the form of a sequence of nontrivial base structures.\nBut in the context of no background information, when we let σ𝜎\\sigma be a finite and relational signature,\n𝐖nsubscript𝐖𝑛\\mathbf{W}_{n} the set of all σ𝜎\\sigma-structures with domain {1,…,n}1…𝑛\\{1,\\ldots,n\\},\nℙnsubscriptℙ𝑛\\mathbb{P}_{n} a probability distribution induced by a PGM, there are some studies.\nThe most closely related to this one are\n1 2 3 by Koponen and Weitkämper and  by Jaeger.\nBut we also have 9 by Koponen, 8 9 by Weitkämper, and \nby Cozman and Maua.\nThe first result about “asymptotic equivalence” between complex first-order formulas and simpler formulas was probably\ngiven by Glebskii et. al. 3 and was used to prove the classical zero-one law for first-order logic,\nalso proved independently by somewhat different methods by Fagin 2.\nSince the pioneering work in 3 and 2 a large number of studies on logical convergence laws and related\nissues have been conducted in the fields of finite model theory and probabilistic combinatorics, but those studes consider\nless flexible ways of generating probability distributions than PGMs (most often the uniform distribution). Organization.\nSection 2 specifies some notation and terminology that will be used, as well as\na couple of probability theoretic results.\nSection 3\ndefines the formal logic P​L​A∗𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴PLA^{*}, and some related notions, that will be used in PGMs and for defining queries (events).\nSection 4 describes a general method (introduced in 3)\nfor “asymptotically eliminating aggregation functions”.\nSection 5\ngives the necessary background about directed acyclic graphs and trees,\nand some other notions related to trees, that will be used in the rest of the article.\nSection 6\nspecifies the assumptions on the sequence of trees 𝐓=(𝒯n:n∈ℕ+)\\mathbf{T}=(\\mathcal{T}_{n}:n\\in\\mathbb{N}^{+}) that we make\nand also explains why we make these assumptions.\nIt then defines the notion of a P​L​A∗𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴PLA^{*}-network, which is the kind of PGM that we use, and how it induces a\nprobability distribution on the set 𝐖nsubscript𝐖𝑛\\mathbf{W}_{n} of all expansions to σ𝜎\\sigma of 𝒯nsubscript𝒯𝑛\\mathcal{T}_{n}.\nIn section 7 we prove technical results that imply that the assumptions of\nTheorem 4.8\nin Section 4 are satisfied.\nTherefore we can, in the last subsection of Section 7,\nuse Theorem 4.8\nand the results from earlier subsections of Section 7\nto prove a result about “asymptotic elimination of aggregation functions”.\nIn Section 8 we use induction on the height of the P​L​A∗𝑃𝐿superscript𝐴PLA^{*}-network\nand the results from Section 7 to prove our main results."
