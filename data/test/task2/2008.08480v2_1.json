  "sections": {
    "related work": "Gale and Shapley  first proved that all stable marriage problem (SMP) instances admit stable matchings, and described an efficient algorithm for finding one. Knuth posed the question of characterizing the structure of the set of stable matchings as Research Problem 6 in 1 (also in English translation ). Irving and Leather’s work  introduced the notion of the rotation poset and showed how it determines the structure of the set of stable matchings. Using this structural characterization of the set of stable matchings, Irving and Leather showed that #​SM#SM\\mathrm{\\#SM} is #​P#P\\mathrm{\\#P}-complete, implying that #​SM#SM\\mathrm{\\#SM} cannot be solved in polynomial time unless P=NPPNP\\mathrm{P}=\\mathrm{NP} . Specifically, Irving and Leather demonstrated that counting stable matchings is equivalent to #​DOWN#DOWN\\mathrm{\\#DOWN} (counting downsets in posets), a problem which was shown to be #​P#P\\mathrm{\\#P}-complete by Provan and Ball . #​DOWN#DOWN\\mathrm{\\#DOWN} was also shown to be #​BIS#BIS\\mathrm{\\#BIS}-complete by Dyer et al. , hence Irving and Leather’s proof also implies the #​BIS#BIS\\mathrm{\\#BIS}-completeness of #​SM#SM\\mathrm{\\#SM}.444The class #​BIS#BIS\\mathrm{\\#BIS} is the class of counting problems reducible to counting independent sets in bipartite graphs under polynomial-time approximation-preserving transformations. In , Dyer et al. call this class #​RH​Π1#RHsubscriptΠ1\\#\\mathrm{RH\\Pi}_{1}. However we adopt the convention, common in recent works, to associate the class #​RH​Π1#RHsubscriptΠ1\\#\\mathrm{RH\\Pi}_{1} with its canonical complete problem, #​BIS#BIS\\mathrm{\\#BIS}. Dyer et al. conjecture that no #​BIS#BIS\\mathrm{\\#BIS}-complete problem has a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS), and prove that #​DOWN#DOWN\\mathrm{\\#DOWN} is #​BIS#BIS\\mathrm{\\#BIS}-complete. The structural properties of stable matchings revealed by Irving and Leather’s work have been exploited in numerous subsequent works to understand the complexities of various tasks related to the SMP. The classical book of Gusfield and Irving  (and references therein) describes some early applications, while the more recent book of Manlove  gives an expansive overview of the SMP and its variants. Recently, Karlin et al.  analyzed novel features of the rotation poset in order to show that any SM instance of size n𝑛n has at most cnsuperscript𝑐𝑛c^{n} stable matchings for some constant c𝑐c, thereby making significant progress towards another of Knuth’s longstanding open problems. Bhatnagar et al.  introduced the k𝑘k-attribute and k𝑘k-range preference models we study, as well as the k𝑘k-list model which our (k1,k2)subscript𝑘1subscript𝑘2(k_{1},k_{2})-list model generalizes. When k1=1subscript𝑘11k_{1}=1 or k2=1subscript𝑘21k_{2}=1, our (k1,k2)subscript𝑘1subscript𝑘2(k_{1},k_{2})-model corresponds to “master preference lists” (cf. Irving et al. ). Chebolu et al.  show that counting stable matchings is #​BIS#BIS\\mathrm{\\#BIS} complete in the k𝑘k-attribute model for any k≥3𝑘3k\\geq 3, as well as the k𝑘k-Euclidean model of Bogomolnaia and Laslier . Thus our Theorem 4.7 gives an alternative (arguably simpler) proof of Chebolu et al.’s #​BIS#BIS\\mathrm{\\#BIS}-hardness result, albeit for the weaker condition k≥6𝑘6k\\geq 6. Finding (and verifying) stable matchings with restricted preferences has also been studied in the centralized 2 and distributed  settings. Künnemann et al. 2 showed that for some instances of k𝑘k-attribute, k𝑘k-list, k𝑘k-Euclidean preference models, stable matchings can be computed in o​(n2)𝑜superscript𝑛2o(n^{2}) time when k=O​(1)𝑘𝑂1k=O(1). For k=ω​(log⁡n)𝑘𝜔𝑛k=\\omega(\\log n), however, k𝑘k-attribute and k𝑘k-Euclidean preferences require Ω​(n2)Ωsuperscript𝑛2\\Omega(n^{2}) time, assuming the strong exponential time hypothesis. In the distributed setting, Khanchandani and Wattenhofer  study a preference model equivalent to the k𝑘k-range model. They show that in this model, a stable matching can be computed in Θ​(k⋅n)Θ⋅𝑘𝑛\\Theta(k\\cdot n) distributed rounds (with each node sending or receiving a single O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) bit message each round). The parameterized complexity of two NPNP\\mathrm{NP}-hard variants of the SMP were studied by Marx and Schlotter 6 7. The first paper 6 studies the SMP with incomplete preferences and ties, a problem for which finding a maximum size stable matching is NPNP\\mathrm{NP}-hard 5. The second paper 7 analyzes the Hospital/Residents problem with couples, for which it is NPNP\\mathrm{NP}-hard to determine if a stable matching exists. Marx and Schlotter show that the two problems are fixed-parameter tractable (parameterized by the number of ties, the maximum length, or overall length of ties for the former problem, and the number of couples in the latter problem). That is, these problems can be solved in polynomial time whenever the relevant parameter is a fixed constant (independent of n𝑛n). For an overview of parameterized complexity, see 1. Recently, Gupta et al. 9 considered the parameterized complexity of several other hard variants of the SMP, parameterized by the treewidth of the “primal graph” (i.e., the graph of acceptable partners), and the treewidth of the Hasse diagram of the rotation poset of an instance. In particular, they give FPT algorithms for computing sex-equal and balanced stable matchings parameterized by treewidth of the Hasse diagram. Combined with our characterization of the rotation posets arising from k𝑘k-range preferences in Theorem 7.9, Gupta et al.’s results immediately imply FPT algorithms for finding sex-equal and balanced stable matchings parameterized by the range of an instance (cf. Corollary 8.8). In , Gupta et al. studied the parameterized complexity of finding a balanced stable matching, parameterized by the maximum balance that can be achieved."
