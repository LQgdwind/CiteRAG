    "i introduction": "Skeleton is a kind of representative visual descriptor, which contains rich information about object topology, constituting an explicated abstraction of object shape. Object skeletons can be converted to descriptive features and/or spatial constraints, promoting computer vision tasks such as human pose estimation , hand gesture recognition , text detection , and object localization , in an explainable fashion. In the deep learning era, object skeleton detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has made unprecedented progress. State-of-the-art approaches commonly utilize side-output architectures to integrate feature pyramid as a countermeasure for variations from object appearances, poses, and scales. This is intrinsically based on the observation that low-level features focus on detailed structures while high-level features are rich in semantics [ref]5. As a pioneer work, the holistically-nested edge detection (HED)  used a deeply supervised strategy to take full use of the hierarchical multi-scale features in a parallel manner. Fusing scale-associated deep side-outputs (FSDS) [ref]7 adopted a divided-and-conquer approach to supervise network side-outputs given scale-associated ground-truth. SRN [ref]8 and RSRN [ref]5 investigated the multi-layer association problem by utilizing side-output residual units to pursue the complementarity among multi-scale features in a deep-to-shallow fasion. HiFi  introduced a bilateral feature integration mechanism to incorporate the low-level details and high-level semantics. Despite the encouraging progress, one limitation lies in that most of the existing network architectures for skeleton detection are hand-crafted and lack the theoretical backup. Although such networks incorporating rich human knowledge are somewhat effective, they experience difficulty in maximizing representation complementarity for objects/parts in different granularity. This hinders further performance optimization of object skeleton detection in complex scenes. In this paper, we formulate the pixel-wise binary classification tasks as linear reconstruction problems within the linear span framework 0 and conclude that the key for network design is to perform feature space expansion. Accordingly, we propose a systematical approach, termed adaptive linear span network (AdaLSN), to transform and integrate hierarchical scale-aware features for object skeleton detection, Fig. 1. AdaLSN is driven by neural architecture search (NAS), which optimizes the network operations and connections to push the features towards scale-aware configuration. This improves the feature versatility towards higher accuracy and latency trade-off compared to the state-of-the-arts. Under the guidance of the linear span theory 1, we find out that not only should we expand feature subspace in each stage, but also adaptively reduce structure redundancy to compress their intersection space. Specifically, we design the linear span unit (LSU) to explicitly transform the input features towards complementary with customized operations. Based on LSUs, we construct an explainable search space, termed the linear span pyramid (LSP), to perform subspace and sum-space expansion. LSP is a unit-pyramid mixed search space, which pursues feature complement spaces with a complementary learning strategy. At the unit level, the feature space is expanded by the LSU. At the pyramid level, we progressively pose intermediate supervision to each expanded feature subspace to reduce their semantic overlap and expand the sum-space. With a genetic search algorithm, AdaLSN automatically optimizes the network operations and connections in each area of the search space, including multiple side-outputs, short connections, feature transform, and intermediate supervision, to push the features towards scale-aware configuration. Linear Span Network (LSN) was proposed in our previous study 0, while is promoted by introducing a well-designed architecture search space and the adaptive search algorithm. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: We propose the adaptive linear span network (AdaLSN), opening up a promising direction to learn complementary scale-aware features within the framework of linear span. We design a unit-pyramid mixed search space, where competitive network architectures evolve via properly defined genetic operations for search. We improve the state-of-the-arts of object skeleton detection, and demonstrate the general effectiveness of AdaLSN to image-to-mask tasks including edge detection and road extraction."
