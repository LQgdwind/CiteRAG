    "ii related work": "Attention: The attention mechanism originated in the natural language processing field to create long-term dependencies between different parts of a sentence. [ref]16 showed that extending the conventional recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder-decoder architecture for transduction tasks with attention encourages long-term dependencies between different hidden representations at different sequence locations.  maintained the encoder-decoder approach but replaced the RNN model with a Transformer consisting of a multi-head self-attention mechanism. Several works have extended attention with convolution for the purposes of modeling sentence pairs , relation classification , and re-identification . These approaches do not attend jointly to the feature, 2D spatial, and temporal subspaces, and, thus, are not directly applicable to spatiotemporal prediction tasks.  applied attention as a stand-alone vision operator by computing attention over local regions within an image. However, the lack of hardware-accelerated operations generally limits its application.  improved efficiency by reformulating self-attention to augment the convolution operation for visual tasks. We build on their approach for the task of occupancy grid prediction. We propose temporal attention and self-attention extensions to the ConvLSTM mechanism, whereby we redefine visual attention to apply it in the spatiotemporal setting, i.e. attention over the feature, 2D spatial, and temporal subspaces. Concurrently to our work,  developed an architecture that introduces a self-attention-based memory component to the ConvLSTM, but does not enable direct temporal attention across different time steps as does our TAAConvLSTM architecture. Video Prediction:  proposed a sequence-to-sequence LSTM approach to video prediction.\n extended the LSTM model to capture spatial correlations by adding a convolution operator, thus forming the ubiquitous ConvLSTM.  addressed the multimodality of the prediction task by considering an action-conditioned video prediction model termed CDNA.  introduced the PredRNN++ architecture, which augments the ConvLSTM with zigzag connections and increases recurrence depth to model complex short-term dynamics. 0 proposed the Predictive Coding Network (PredNet), where the error signal between the prediction and the observation is propagated laterally and vertically within the recurrent architecture. These approaches focus on deterministic predictive models. A separate category of work tackles stochastic modelling (e.g. variational latent variable models , adversarial training regimes , or normalizing flows ), which is beyond the scope of this paper. In this work, we apply deterministic video prediction techniques to occupancy grid prediction due to clear parallels between both tasks. Occupancy Grid Prediction: Various adaptations of the RNN architecture with convolutions are commonly used for occupancy grid prediction tasks.  proposed a Deep Tracking approach where an RNN with a Spatial Transformer was used for binary occupancy grid prediction.  tested a ConvLSTM to predict occupancy grids for a stationary ego-vehicle in urban settings, such as intersections.  employed a difference learning approach assuming a high refresh rate of the LiDAR sensor and high map similarity between frames.  repurposed the PredNet architecture 0 for ego-centric occupancy grid prediction. This approach captured the relative dynamics of static and moving objects well but experienced significant blurring and the gradual disappearance of obstacles. In this paper, we formulate two attention-augmented ConvLSTM mechanisms and validate them on the best performing architecture for this task, PredNet 0 . Concurrent work by [ref]34 addressed these issues with a double-prong architecture that assumes the static and dynamic objects in the scene to be known a priori. Unlike [ref]34, we do not require access to highly accurate object detection and tracking capabilities."
