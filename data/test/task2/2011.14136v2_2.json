    "main results": "Basically, our main result is to provide a new algorithm solving\nProblem (1) when ⟨𝒇⟩delimited-⟨⟩𝒇\\langle{\\bm{f}}\\rangle is radical and\nassumption (A) holds. Under some genericity assumptions, we\nprove that it outputs formulas involing polynomials of degree in O​(dn)𝑂superscript𝑑𝑛O(d^{n}) with a\nbetter arithmetic complexity than what was previously known. Let ℂ​[𝐱,𝐲]dℂsubscript𝐱𝐲𝑑\\mathbb{C}[{\\bm{x}},{\\bm{y}}]_{d} be the set of polynomials in ℂ​[𝐱,𝐲]ℂ𝐱𝐲\\mathbb{C}[{\\bm{x}},{\\bm{y}}]\nhaving total degree bounded by d𝑑d and set 𝔇=n​(d−1)​dn𝔇𝑛𝑑1superscript𝑑𝑛\\mathfrak{D}=n(d-1)d^{n}. There exists a non-empty Zariski open set ℱ⊂ℂ​[𝐱,𝐲]dnℱℂsuperscriptsubscript𝐱𝐲𝑑𝑛\\mathscr{F}\\subset\\mathbb{C}[{\\bm{x}},{\\bm{y}}]_{d}^{n} such that for 𝐟=(f1,…,fn)∈ℱ∩ℚ​[𝐱,𝐲]n𝐟subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑛ℱℚsuperscript𝐱𝐲𝑛{\\bm{f}}=(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{n})\\in\\mathscr{F}\\cap\\mathbb{Q}[{\\bm{x}},{\\bm{y}}]^{n}, the following holds: There exists an algorithm that computes a solution for the\nweak-version of Problem (1) within arithmetic operations in ℚℚ\\mathbb{Q}. There exists a probabilistic algorithm that returns\nthe formulas of a collection of semi-algebraic sets solving\nProblem (1) within arithmetic operations in ℚℚ\\mathbb{Q} in case of success. The semi-algebraic descriptions output by the above\nalgorithm involves polynomials in ℚ​[𝒚]ℚdelimited-[]𝒚\\mathbb{Q}[{\\bm{y}}] of degree bounded by\n𝔇𝔇\\mathfrak{D}. We note that the binomial coefficient (t+𝔇t)binomial𝑡𝔇𝑡\\binom{t+\\mathfrak{D}}{t} is\nbounded from above by 𝔇t≃nt​dn​t+tsimilar-to-or-equalssuperscript𝔇𝑡superscript𝑛𝑡superscript𝑑𝑛𝑡𝑡\\mathfrak{D}^{t}\\simeq n^{t}d^{nt+t}. Therefore,\nthe complexities given in the items i) and ii) of\nTheorem I can be bounded by O​~​(23​t​n3​t​d3​n​t)𝑂~absentsuperscript23𝑡superscript𝑛3𝑡superscript𝑑3𝑛𝑡O\\ {\\widetilde{\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ }}\\left(2^{3t}\\ n^{3t}d^{3nt}\\right) and O​~​(23​t​n3​t​d4​n​t)𝑂~absentsuperscript23𝑡superscript𝑛3𝑡superscript𝑑4𝑛𝑡O\\ {\\widetilde{\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ }}\\left(2^{3t}\\ n^{3t}d^{4nt}\\right) respectively. We also implemented this algorithm to illustrate its practical behaviour\nand compare it with the state-of-the-art software within the Maple\npackages RootFinding[Parametric] and RegularChains[ParametricSystemTools]. We report on experiments showing that\nour implementation outperforms these packages, which is justified by our\ncomplexity result. The key ingredient on which one relies to obtain these results is a set of\nwell-known properties of Hermite quadratic forms to count the real roots\nof zero-dimensional ideals. The use of such quadratic forms for counting the\nnumber of real solutions was introduced in  and then later on\ngeneralized by  and used in . We refer\nto [4, Theorem 4.102] for the explicit relation between the number of\nreal roots of a zero-dimensional algebraic set and the signature of these\nquadratic forms and to [4, Algo. 8.43] for an algorithm computing\nthese signatures. We first slightly extend the definition of Hermite’s quadratic forms\nand Hermite’s matrices to the context of parametric systems; we call\nthem parametric Hermite quadratic forms and parametric Hermite\nmatrices. This is easily done since the ideal of ℚ​(𝒚)​[𝒙]ℚ𝒚delimited-[]𝒙\\mathbb{Q}({\\bm{y}})[{\\bm{x}}]\ngenerated by 𝒇𝒇{\\bm{f}}, considering ℚ​(𝒚)ℚ𝒚\\mathbb{Q}({\\bm{y}}) as the base field, has\ndimension zero. We also establish natural specialization properties\nfor these parametric Hermite matrices. Hence, a parametric Hermite matrix, similar to its zero-dimensional\ncounterpart, allows one to count respectively the number of distinct\nreal and complex roots at any parameters outside a strict algebraic\nsets of ℝtsuperscriptℝ𝑡\\mathbb{R}^{t} by evaluating the signature and rank of its\nspecialization. Based on this specialization property, we design two algorithms for\nsolving Problem (1) and also its weak version for the\ninput system 𝒇𝒇{\\bm{f}} which satisfies Assumption (A) and\ngenerates a radical ideal. Our algorithm for the weak version of Problem (1)\nreduces to the following main steps. Compute a parametric Hermite matrix ℋℋ{\\mathcal{H}} associated to 𝒇⊂ℚ​[𝒚]​[𝒙]𝒇ℚdelimited-[]𝒚delimited-[]𝒙{\\bm{f}}\\subset\\mathbb{Q}[{\\bm{y}}][{\\bm{x}}]. Compute a set of sample points {η1,…,ηℓ}subscript𝜂1…subscript𝜂ℓ\\{{\\eta}_{1},\\ldots,{\\eta}_{\\ell}\\} in the connected components of the semi-algebraic set of\nℝtsuperscriptℝ𝑡\\mathbb{R}^{t} defined by 𝒘≠0𝒘0\\bm{w}\\neq 0 where 𝒘𝒘\\bm{w} is derived from ℋℋ{\\mathcal{H}}. This is done through the so-called critical point method (see e.g.\n[4, Chap. 12] and references therein) which are adapted to\nobtain practically fast algorithms following . We will\nexplain in detail this step in Section 3. This algorithm takes as input s𝑠s polynomials of degree D𝐷D involving\nt𝑡t variables and computes sample points per connected components in\nthe semi-algebraic set defined by the non-vanishing of these\npolynomials using Compute the number risubscript𝑟𝑖r_{i} of real points in 𝒱∩π−1​(ηi)𝒱superscript𝜋1subscript𝜂𝑖{\\mathcal{V}}\\cap\\pi^{-1}({\\eta}_{i}) for 1≤i≤ℓ1𝑖ℓ1\\leq i\\leq\\ell. This is done by simply evaluating the signature of the specialization\nof ℋℋ{\\mathcal{H}} at each ηisubscript𝜂𝑖{\\eta}_{i}. It is worth noting that, in the algorithm above, we obtain through\nparametric Hermite matrices a polynomial 𝒘𝒘\\bm{w} that plays the same\nrole as the discriminant varieties of  or the border\npolynomials of . We will see in the section reporting\nexperiments that our approach outperforms the other two on every\nexample we consider. To return semi-algebraic formulas, our routine is basically the same except\ninstead of computing sample points in the set {w≠0}𝑤0\\{w\\neq 0\\}, one needs to\nconsider all principal minors of the matrix ℋℋ{\\mathcal{H}} and compute sample points\noutside the union of the vanishing sets of all these polynomials. Another contribution of this paper is to make clear how to perform the step (a).\nFor this, we rely on the theory of Gröbner bases. More precisely, we use\nspecialization properties of Gröbner bases, similar to those already proven in\n. This leaves some freedom when running the algorithm: since we\nrely on Gröbner bases, one may choose monomial orderings which are more\nconvenient for practical computations. In particular, the monomial basis of the\nquotient ring ℚ​(𝒚)​[𝒙]/Iℚ𝒚delimited-[]𝒙𝐼\\mathbb{Q}({\\bm{y}})[{\\bm{x}}]/I where I𝐼I is the ideal generated by 𝒇𝒇{\\bm{f}} in\nℚ​(𝒚)​[𝒙]ℚ𝒚delimited-[]𝒙\\mathbb{Q}({\\bm{y}})[{\\bm{x}}] depends on the choice of the monomial ordering used for\nGröbner bases computations. We describe the behavior of our algorithm when\nchoosing the graded reverse lexicographical ordering whose interest for\npractical computations is explained in [ref]5. Further, we denote by\ngrevlex​(𝒙)grevlex𝒙\\mathrm{grevlex}({\\bm{x}}) the graded reverse lexicographical ordering applied to the sequence\nof the variables 𝒙=(x1,…,xn)𝒙subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛{\\bm{x}}=(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}) (with x1≻⋯≻xnsucceedssubscript𝑥1⋯succeedssubscript𝑥𝑛x_{1}\\succ\\cdots\\succ x_{n}).\nFurther, we also denote by ≻l​e​xsubscriptsucceeds𝑙𝑒𝑥\\succ_{{lex}} the lexicographical ordering. We report, at the end of the paper, on the practical behavior of this\nalgorithm. We compare with two Maple packages RootFinding[Parametric] and RegularChains[ParametricSystemTools] which respectively implement the\nalgorithms of  and . In particular, our\nalgorithm allows us to solve instances of Problem (1)\nwhich were not tractable by the state-of-the-art as well as the actual\ndegrees of the polynomials in the output formula which are bounded by\nn​(d−1)​dn𝑛𝑑1superscript𝑑𝑛n(d-1)d^{n}. We actually prove such a statement under some generic assumptions. Our\nmain complexity result is stated below. Its proof is given in\nSubsection 6.2, where the generic\nassumptions in use are given explicitly."
