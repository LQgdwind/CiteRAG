  "title": "Kyrix-S: Authoring Scalable Scatterplot Visualizations of Big Data",
  "sections": {
    "introduction": "Scatterplots are an important type of visualization used extensively in data science and visual analytic systems. Objects in a dataset are visualized on a 2D Cartesian plane, with the dimensions being two quantitative attributes from the objects. Each object can be represented as a point, polygon or other mark. Aggregation-based marks (e.g. pie chart, heatmap) can also be used to represent groups of objects. The user of a scatterplot can perform a variety of tasks to provide insights into the underlying data, such as discovering global trends, inspecting individual objects or characterizing distributions. Despite the usefulness of static scatterplots, they suffer from significant overdraw problem on big datasets[ref]43 . Here, we focus on scatterplots with millions to billions of objects, where significant overlap of marks is unavoidable, making the visualization ineffective. To address this issue in scatterplots, there has been substantial research    on devising aggregation-based scatterplots using visual aggregates such as contours or hexagon bins. While avoiding visual clutter, these approaches do not support inspecting individual objects, which is a fundamental scatterplot task. Prior works also used transparency , animation and displacements of objects   to ease the overdraw problem. However, due to limited screen resolution, these methods have scalability limits. On the other hand, the use of zooming in scatterplots has the potential to effectively mitigate visual clutter. By expanding the 2D Cartesian plane into a series of zoom levels with different scales, more screen resolution becomes available, allowing for object layouts that avoid occlusion and excessive density. Inspecting large amounts of objects thus becomes feasible. Aggregation-based marks such as circles or heatmaps can still be used to visualize groups of objects.\nFigure Kyrix-S: Authoring Scalable Scatterplot Visualizations of Big Data shows such a visualization created by the system we introduce in this paper, which shows one billion comments made by users on Reddit.com, where XùëãX is the posting time and YùëåY is the number of characters in the comments. Additional examples are in Figure 1. For simplicity, we term such visualizations scalable scatterplot visualizations, or SSV. There has been significant work on building systems/toolkits to aid the creation of SSVs (e.g.  [ref]23 ). Specifically, prior systems can be classified into two categories: general pan/zoom systems and specialized SSV systems.\nGeneral pan/zoom systems are typically expressive, supporting not only SSVs, but also pan/zoom visualizations of other types of data (e.g. hierarchical and temporal data) or that connect multiple 2D semantic spaces111A 2D semantic space consists of zoom levels sharing the same coordinate system and visualizing the same type of objects. An SSV has only one semantic space. General pan/zoom systems typically allow ‚Äúsemantic jumping‚Äù from one semantic space to another  (e.g. from a space of Reddit comments to a space of Reddit forums). .\nSpecialized SSV systems (e.g. [ref]23 ), on the other hand, generally have a narrow focus on SSVs. While these systems have been shown to be effective, they can suffer from some drawbacks that limit their ability to support general SSV authoring at scale. In particular, limited scalability is a common drawback of both types of systems. As often as not, implementations assume all objects reside in the main memory of a computer   [ref]23    . General pan/zoom systems, while being flexible, generally incur too much developer work due to their low-level nature. When authoring an SSV, the developer needs to manually generate the layout of visual marks on zoom levels. In very large datasets, there will be many levels (e.g. Google Maps has 20). Individually specifying the layout of a set of levels is tedious and error-prone. In particular, big or skewed data can make it challenging for the developer to specify a layout that avoids occlusion and excessive density in the visualization. Another drawback of specialized SSV systems is low flexibility.\nOftentimes systems are hardcoded for specific scenarios (e.g., supporting specific types of visual marks such as heatmaps[ref]43  or points , enforcing a density budget but not removing overlap, etc.) and are not extensible to general use cases. The developer cannot make free design choices when using these systems, and is forced to constantly switch tools for different application requirements. In this paper, we describe Kyrix-S 222The birth of Kyrix-S is driven by the limitations we see when we use Kyrix, a general pan/zoom system we have developed, to build real-world SSV-based applications. The name Kyrix-S here suggests that we implement Kyrix-S as an extension of Kyrix for SSVs, rather than a replacement. S may suggest scale, scatterplots or spatial partitioning. More detailed discussion on the relationship between the two systems can be found in Sections 2 and 7. , a system for SSV authoring at scale which addresses all issues of existing systems.\nTo enable rapid authoring, we present a high-level declarative grammar for SSVs. We abstract away low-level details such as rendering of visual marks so that the developer can author a complex SSV in a few tens of lines of JSON. We show that compared to a state-of-the-art system, this is 4X‚Äì9X reduction in specification on several examples. In addition, we build a gallery of SSVs to show that our grammar is expressive and that the developer can easily extend it to add his/her own visual marks. This grammar for SSVs is supported by an algorithm that automatically chooses the layout of visual marks on all zoom levels, thereby freeing the developer from writing custom code.\nWe store objects in a multi-node parallel database using multi-node spatial indexing. As we show in Section 8, this allows us to respond to any pan/zoom action in under 500ms on datasets with billions of objects. To summarize, we make the following contributions: An integrated system called Kyrix-S for declarative authoring and rendering of SSVs at scale.333Code available at https://github.com/tracyhenry/kyrix A concise and expressive declarative grammar for describing SSVs (Section 4). A framework for offline database indexing and online serving that enables interactive browsing of large SSVs (Sections 5 and 6)."
