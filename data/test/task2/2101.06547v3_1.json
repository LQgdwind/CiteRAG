    "related work": "The autonomy pipeline composed of cascading detection, motion forecasting and motion planning modules offers great advantages over black-box end-to-end models      such as safety, interpretability, error tracing, and data efficiency.\nMoreover, it has been recently shown that it can be learned end-to-end    5 .\nBecause of this, we focus our literature review on this approach.\nFor object detection, we simply leverage recent advances in 3D voxel-based object detection from LiDAR point clouds     , which have been shown to achieve great speed-accuracy tradeoffs.\nIn the following paragraphs, we dive deep into recent advances in motion forecasting and motion planning, given that the main contributions of our work reside on these modules. A common approach for actor modeling has been to independently predict the trajectory of each actor 2 0 [ref]4   0 . These predictions can be represented as closed-form gaussian distributions 0 [ref]4 , a classification or energy over a discrete grid/graph/set structure   0 , or trajectory samples of a stochastic model 2 .\nOne approach to tractably model the traffic multimodality jointly across actors is to stochastically sample one possible future scenario at a time, by sampling latent variables that encode the joint scene dynamics, and then decode the future trajectories 3 8 . These are mainly divided into autoregressive models 3 8, and implicit latent variable models . However, these methods require a high number of samples to characterize the scene. In contrast, work in diverse motion forecasting has focused on achieving high sample-efficiency to cover the main modes of the distribution. This is especially important in self-driving as SDVs need to be able to anticipate rare or dangerous behavior by other actors on the road in order to plan safe responses. Recent work   has explored how to encourage more diverse predictions from pretrained variational inference models 7. They train new encoders that output a fixed number of jointly diverse samples of latent variables. The formulation in  directly outputs the set of latent codes, and evaluates their diversity based on determinantal point processes (DPP).\nIn the work of , a set of multivariate gaussian distributions are sampled jointly via reparameterization trick with a shared noise, and a diversity loss based on the L2-distance between motion forecast samples is used to increase diversity in the predictions.\nAlternatively,  trains a conditional GAN to output diverse samples using Farthest Point Sampling on the latent space to spread out over more modes of the latent space. Finally,  trains their trajectory samples to stay within the drivable area, allowing for greater diversity while retaining admissibility. While these works achieve greater diversity and accuracy in motion prediction, it is unclear how these improvements translate into better motion planning for autonomous agents. In motion planning the goal is to generate a trajectory for the self-driving vehicle to drive safely, comfortably, and progressing toward the goal . A popular approach to achieve this task is to design a cost function that encodes all the objectives above and find a minimum-cost trajectory. Such optimizations have been solved using continuous-optimization 3, sampling 6 5, or search . These methods achieve safety by including a collision cost in the objective function which is computed with respect to\nthe predicted trajectories of actors in the scene. However, in probabilistic settings where the predictions take the form of trajectory distributions, the above methods compute the collision cost in expectation, minimizing the expected cost over all future predicted scenarios with a single plan.\nGiven a set of joint diverse predictions, it is possible that the SDV will need to plan for a greater number of unlikely, but safety-critical future scenarios that will require it drive defensively (e.g. yield, change lanes). However, it is undesirable to always brake preemptively for such rare scenarios, or ignore them altogether. Work in optimization-based motion planning  4 0 9 plan for such rare scenarios by picking trajectory plans that ensure it can react to them safely, while also optimizing for objectives such as progress and comfort. 4 splits the planned trajectory into an initial shared section, and a set of branched plans that could be taken from the end of the shared section.\n0 9 predict the probability that a defensive maneuver will be necessary in the near future, and decide whether to postpone the decision to the future (where more information will be available)."
