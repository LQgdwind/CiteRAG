    "a computationally feasible algorithm": "Below the BBP threshold , i.e., when p/n>(1+Ω​(1))​‖θ‖4𝑝𝑛1Ω1superscriptnorm𝜃4p/n>(1+\\Omega(1))\\|\\theta\\|^{4}, consistent clustering is, in general, information theoretically impossible  . To circumvent this issue it is necessary to take the additional information that θ𝜃\\theta is sparse into account. We modify the low-dimensional clustering algorithm proposed by Vempala and Wang . Their approach consists of computing the SVD of the data matrix, projecting the data onto the low-dimensional space spanned by the first left singular vector and then running a clustering algorithm such as k𝑘k-means. We propose to modify the first step of this algorithm by running a sparse PCA algorithm. In particular, we use a variant of a semidefinite program which was initially proposed by d’Aspremont et al.  and further developed and analyzed in   7. Other theoretically investigated approaches to solve the sparse PCA problem include diagonal thresholding , iterative thresholding 9, covariance thresholding 2  and axis aligned random projections 0. In spirit, Algorithm 1 is similar to the two-stage selection methods proposed in  0 , and we discuss differences below. In the following theorem we show that Algorithm 1 achieves an exponentially-small misclustering error when the squared sparsity is of smaller order than the sample size. We emphasize that Algorithm 1 does not require an impractical sample splitting111Sample splitting would split the data into two copies with independent noise (as in the proof of Theorem 2.4) and use one for each of the steps 1 and 3 of Algorithm 1. This would make the analysis easier but yields an algorithm that would be less natural to use in practice. step. This makes the proof of Theorem 2.1 more difficult as u^^𝑢\\hat{u} and each Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} are not independent. We overcome this difficulty by using the leave-one-out method combined with a careful analysis of the KKT conditions of the SDP estimator P^^𝑃\\hat{P}. Assume that log⁡(p)≤n𝑝𝑛\\log(p)\\leq n and ‖θ‖∞≤κ≤log⁡(p)subscriptnorm𝜃𝜅𝑝\\|\\theta\\|_{\\infty}\\leq\\kappa\\leq\\sqrt{\\log(p)} for some κ>0𝜅0\\kappa>0. Moreover, suppose that for some large enough constant C>0𝐶0C>0, λ=C​(1+κ)​log⁡(p)/n𝜆𝐶1𝜅𝑝𝑛\\lambda=C(1+\\kappa)\\sqrt{\\log(p)/n} and that for some small enough constant c>0𝑐0c>0 Then the output of Algorithm 1 satisfies with probability at least 1−8​p−1−2​e−‖θ‖/218superscript𝑝12superscript𝑒norm𝜃21-8p^{-1}-2e^{-\\|\\theta\\|/2} that for another constant c′>0superscript𝑐′0c^{\\prime}>0, Lu and Zhou 8 prove a minimax lower bound in the analogous setting without sparsity. Their result implies the following minimax lower bound in our setting (even if θ𝜃\\theta is known to the algorithm): Hence, when ‖θ‖=ω​(1)norm𝜃𝜔1\\|\\theta\\|=\\omega(1) and s2/n=o​(‖θ‖4/(log⁡(p)​(1+κ2)))superscript𝑠2𝑛𝑜superscriptnorm𝜃4𝑝1superscript𝜅2s^{2}/n=o(\\|\\theta\\|^{4}/(\\log(p)(1+\\kappa^{2}))), the convergence rate in (5) is minimax optimal. It was previously shown by 8  that this rate is achievable when p/n=o​(‖θ‖2)𝑝𝑛𝑜superscriptnorm𝜃2p/n=o(\\|\\theta\\|^{2}) (which is above the BBP transition , where the sparsity assumption is not needed). Algorithm 1 is the first clustering procedure to provably achieve this minimax optimal misclustering error in the regime where sparsity must be exploited. When p/n=o(∥θ∥4p/n=o(\\|\\theta\\|^{4}) and p/n=ω​(‖θ‖2)𝑝𝑛𝜔superscriptnorm𝜃2p/n=\\omega(\\|\\theta\\|^{2}) only a slower convergence rate is achievable in the setting without sparsity   . This corresponds to a regime where it is impossible to consistently estimate the direction of θ𝜃\\theta, but where consistent clustering is possible. By contrast, such a regime does not exist in the sparse high-dimensional setting when p/n=ω​(‖θ‖4)𝑝𝑛𝜔superscriptnorm𝜃4p/n=\\omega(\\|\\theta\\|^{4}). This is due to the fact that is necessary to exploit the sparsity of θ𝜃\\theta and estimate its direction in the clustering process . We now discuss existing theoretical results in high-dimensional sparse clustering. The articles   8 focus on estimating classification rules from unlabeled data and study the risk of misclassifying a new observation. This risk measure is easier to analyze because the classification rule is independent of the new observation. Moreover, their setting is slightly different. For instance, Cai et al. 8 assume that ‖θ‖=O​(1)norm𝜃𝑂1\\|\\theta\\|=O(1) and consider the more general case with arbitrary covariance matrix ΣΣ\\Sigma and sparsity of Σ−1​θsuperscriptΣ1𝜃\\Sigma^{-1}\\theta. They propose a sparse high-dimensional EM-algorithm and prove sharp bounds on the excess prediction risk, provided that they have a sufficiently good initializer. They (and Azizyan et al. , too) obtain this initializer by using the Hardt-Price algorithm 4 and penalized estimation. Ultimately this requires that s12/n=o​(1)superscript𝑠12𝑛𝑜1s^{12}/n=o(1). Similarly to the present article,  0  propose two-stage algorithms, selecting first the relevant coordinates and then performing clustering. In 0 and , suboptimal polynomial rates of convergence are shown for the misclustering error. In particular, Jin et al.  assume that θj​∼i.i.d.​(1−ϵ)​δ0+ϵ​δκ/2+ϵ​δ−κ/2\\theta_{j}\\overset{i.i.d.}{\\thicksim}(1-\\epsilon)\\delta_{0}+\\epsilon\\delta_{\\kappa}/2+\\epsilon\\delta_{-\\kappa}/2 where κ=o​(1),ϵ=o​(1)formulae-sequence𝜅𝑜1italic-ϵ𝑜1\\kappa=o(1),\\epsilon=o(1) and give precise bounds for which regimes of (p,n,κ,ϵ)𝑝𝑛𝜅italic-ϵ(p,n,\\kappa,\\epsilon) consistent clustering is possible and for which it is not. Most relevant to the present work, they prove, ignoring log-factors, that ‖θ‖2=ω​(1+s/n)superscriptnorm𝜃2𝜔1𝑠𝑛\\|\\theta\\|^{2}=\\omega(1+s/n) is a necessary and sufficient condition for consistent clustering. However, the algorithm that achieves this performance bound is based on exhaustive search which is not computationally efficient. By contrast, ignoring log-factors, we require in addition that ‖θ‖2=ω​(1+s/n)superscriptnorm𝜃2𝜔1𝑠𝑛\\|\\theta\\|^{2}=\\omega(1+s/\\sqrt{n}) for consistent recovery when θ𝜃\\theta is sampled from their prior, matching the requirements of a polynomial-time algorithm they propose. Observing this discrepancy between the performance of their polynomial-time algorithm and the exhaustive search algorithm, they conjecture computational gaps, for which we give evidence in Section 2.2. In contrast to the above work, our results apply for arbitrary θ𝜃\\theta and z𝑧z from a given parameter parameter space (instead of a specific prior), we do not assume κ=o​(1)𝜅𝑜1\\kappa=o(1), and we achieve optimal exponential convergence rates. The assumption κ=O​(log⁡p)𝜅𝑂𝑝\\kappa=O(\\sqrt{\\log p}) is less restrictive than typical assumptions on θ𝜃\\theta used in the literature. For instance,  5 both assume that θ∈{−κ,κ,0}p𝜃superscript𝜅𝜅0𝑝\\theta\\in\\{-\\kappa,\\kappa,0\\}^{p} and 0  assume that κ=o​(1)𝜅𝑜1\\kappa=o(1). We show next that in fact no assumption on ‖θ‖∞subscriptnorm𝜃\\|\\theta\\|_{\\infty} is needed at all: if ‖θ‖∞≥κsubscriptnorm𝜃𝜅\\|\\theta\\|_{\\infty}\\geq\\kappa for some large enough constant κ>0𝜅0\\kappa>0, then clustering becomes much easier. In particular,\nit is possible to achieve exponential convergence rates in ‖θ‖2superscriptnorm𝜃2\\|\\theta\\|^{2} as soon as s/n=o​(‖θ‖2/log⁡(e​p/s))𝑠𝑛𝑜superscriptnorm𝜃2𝑒𝑝𝑠s/n=o(\\|\\theta\\|^{2}/\\log(ep/s)). Hence, in this regime no computational gap exists. Suppose that log⁡(p)≤n𝑝𝑛\\log(p)\\leq n and that ‖θ‖∞≥κsubscriptnorm𝜃𝜅\\|\\theta\\|_{\\infty}\\geq\\kappa for some κ>0𝜅0\\kappa>0 such that for some small enough constant c>0𝑐0c>0, Then there exists a polynomial time algorithm with output z^^𝑧\\hat{z} and a constant c′>0superscript𝑐′0c^{\\prime}>0 such that with probability at least 1−(3​s)/p−2​e−‖θ‖/413𝑠𝑝2superscript𝑒norm𝜃41-(3s)/p-2e^{-\\|\\theta\\|/4},"
