    "related work": "We divide the related work into three categories following the stages of standard registration pipelines that deal with real-world 3D scans: feature-based correspondence matching, outlier filtering, and pose optimization. Feature-based correspondence matching.\nThe first step in many 3D registration pipelines is feature extraction. Local and global geometric structure in 3D is analyzed to produce high-dimensional feature descriptors, which can then be used to establish correspondences. Traditional hand-crafted features commonly summarize pairwise or higher-order relationships in histograms   0  .\nRecent work has shifted to learning features via deep networks  . A number of recent methods are based on global pooling models  1 , while others use convolutional networks  . Our work is agnostic to the feature extraction mechanism. Our modules primarily address subsequent stages of the registration pipeline and are compatible with a wide variety of feature descriptors. Outlier filtering.\nCorrespondences produced by matching features are commonly heavily contaminated by outliers.\nThese outliers need to be filtered out for robust alignment.\nA widely used family of techniques for robust model fitting is based on RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC)     9, which iteratively samples small sets of correspondences in the hope of sampling a subset that is free from outliers.\nOther algorithms are based on branch-and-bound , semi-definite programming  , and maximal clique selection 4.\nThese methods are accurate, but commonly require longer iterative sampling or more expensive computation as the signal-to-noise ratio decreases. One exception is TEASER 4, which remains effective even with high outlier rates.\nOther methods use robust loss functions to reject outliers during optimization  . Our work uses a convolutional network to identify inliers and outliers. The network needs only one feed-forward pass at test time and does not require iterative optimization. Pose optimization.\nPose optimization is the final stage that minimizes an alignment objective on filtered correspondences.\nIterative Closest Points (ICP)  and Fast Global Registration (FGR)  use second-order optimization to optimize poses. Makadia et al.  propose an iterative procedure to minimize correlation scores.\nMaken et al.  propose to accelerate this process by stochastic gradient descent. Recent end-to-end frameworks combine feature learning and pose optimization. Aoki et al.  combine PointNet global features with an iterative pose optimization method 4. Wang et al. 1 2 train graph neural network features by backpropagating through pose optimization. We further advance this line of work. In particular, our Weighted Procrustes method reduces the complexity of optimization from quadratic to linear and enables the use of dense correspondences for highly accurate registration of real-world scans."
