    "introduction": "Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a population-based metaheuristic\ninspired by the social behavior of ants .\nIt has been successfully applied in solving many NP-hard problems,\nincluding the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),\nthe Quadratic Assignment Problem,\nand the Sequential Ordering Problem   .\nBeing metaheuristic, the ACO does not guarantee\nfinding an optimum solution, however it is often able to offer\nsatisfactory approximate solutions within an acceptable\ntime compared to exact methods .\nHowever, even metaheuristics can be prohibitively time consuming\nif faced with a large enough problem instance.\nFor this reason, a lot of research attention has been devoted both to\nimproving the effectiveness of the ACO search process,\nand to speeding up its execution .\nThe idea of applying GPU-based computing to the ACO\nis an example of the latter.\nIn recent years, the use of graphics processing units (GPUs)\nto speed up scientific computations has become commonplace.\nThis has been, in part, dictated by the slow-down in Moore’s law,\nand the progress made in the GPU architecture development, which has resulted\nin more computing capacity, flexibility, and ease-of-use .\nIn fact, currently a significant proportion of the world’s fastest supercomputers\nis equipped with GPUs to accelerate their computations .\nStill, the efficient use of the computing capacity offered by GPUs\nremains a difficult task . In an ACO, a population of agents (ants) construct, in parallel,\na set of solutions to the optimization problem begin tackled.\nUnfortunately, the inherent parallel nature of the ACO\ndoes not translate easily into an efficient GPU-based parallel\nimplementation   [ref]39.\nThe difficulties arise partly from the fact that not all of the ACO\ncomputations are independent, e.g., pheromone trail updates; as well as from the\ncomputing restrictions inflicted by GPU architectures.\nAlthough considerable research attention has been devoted to using GPUs to\nspeed up the ACO-based algorithms, both the improved computational capabilities\nof successive generations of GPUs as well as novel algorithmic ideas, offer new\nopportunities for greater progress. In this paper, we present a GPU-based parallel implementation of the MAX-MIN\nAnt System (MMAS), which is one of the best-performing ACO\nvariants for solving various optimization problems including\nthe production-distribution scheduling problem ,\nthe blocks relocation problem ,\nthe routing and scheduling of home health care caregivers\nproblem , and the traveling purchaser\nproblem .\nBuilding on existing research we show how each of\nthe essential MMAS components can be parallelized to allow the efficient use of\nthe significant computing power offered by the current generation of GPUs. The main contributions presented in this paper can be summarized as follows: We present a novel parallel implementation of the next node (proportional) selection\nprocedure used in the MMAS and other ACO algorithms.\nThe implementation is based on the weighted reservoir sampling algorithm and\nfits well within the parallel computing model of contemporary GPU architectures. We present a novel, memory-efficient implementation of the tabu list structure\nused by the ACO solution construction process. The implementation\nallows for the better utilization of fast, but very size limited, shared memory\nof GPUs. Combining these novel ideas and the solutions from the literature, we\npresent a total of six MMAS variants and evaluate\ntheir computational efficiency based on two subsequent generations\nof Nvidia GPUs, namely Pascal and Volta. The computational evaluation based on a set of TSP instances ranging from 198\nto 3,795 cities\nshows that the proposed GPU-based MMAS is competitive with\nstate-of-the-art GPU-based   \nand multi-core CPU-based  parallel ACO implementations.\nThe times obtained were up to 7.18x and 21.79x smaller, respectively. Acknowledging, that the ACO algorithms are typically paired with\nan efficient, problem-specific local search (LS) method, we\ncombine the proposed GPU-based MMAS with a parallelized 2-opt heuristic.\nThe computational experiments that consider the TSP instances of up to 18,512\nnodes show that the proposed implementation is able to generate\nhigh-quality solutions, i.e., within 1% from an optimum, in a relatively\nshort time. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2\nwe provide a brief description of the MAX-MIN Ant System and short piece on the\ncharacteristics of\ngeneral-purpose GPU computations. Section 3 summarizes the existing\nwork on applying GPUs in speeding up ACO computations, including the MMAS.\nOur main ideas on the efficient implementation of the GPU-based MMAS are presented\nin Section 4; while\nSection  presents an analysis of the computational\nexperiments we conducted in order to evaluate the proposals, and compare them with the work\ndescribed in the literature.\nFinally, we summarize our findings and provide a few ideas for future work\nin Section 6."
