  "title": "Knowledge Graph-Augmented Language Models for Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Generation",
  "sections": {
    "introduction": "Dialogue systems aim to engage in ongoing conversations with humans by generating human-like responses. While pre-trained language models (PLMs) [ref]29  are capable of generating fluent responses, they often generate factually incorrect responses due to a lack of explicit knowledge 8.\nTo overcome such limitations, recent methods access external knowledge sources such as Wikipedia [ref]6, Web , Freebase   and Wikidata  to retrieve the relevant knowledge for the dialogue context.\nIn this work, we focus on the Knowledge Graphs (KGs)-based dialogue generation as existing works 9      . KGs represent facts in the most compact and effective symbolic structured form (See the leftmost of Figure 1), consisting of entities as nodes and their relation as an edge. Each of them is formed with a triplet, which can help generate knowledge-grounded responses. Most of the dialogue generation models with KGs   utilize all the triplets associated with entities in the dialogue context. However, through observation, we found not all of the facts are actually relevant to the conversation (e.g., Jane Austen was born in Steventon in Figure 1), which could mislead the models to generate factually incorrect responses.\n87% of facts from 1-hop KG are irrelevant to the context in the OpendialKG dataset . Moreover, encoding all the facts including the unnecessary ones is computationally inefficient  6.\nOn the other hand, even after correctly retrieving the relevant facts, it is not straightforward to combine two heterogeneous modalities: the dialogue context is represented as a text; the knowledge is represented as a graph.\nIn other words, since PLMs already have tons of pre-trained parameters trained on the unstructured texts, properly conditioning the structured graph to PLMs is highly challenging. Otherwise, PLMs may generate inconsistent responses disregarding the knowledge from the retrieved subgraph, which is a phenomenon known as hallucination 4, where they generate responses with their own memorized yet incorrect knowledge. In this work, we tackle such challenging and fundamental issues of knowledge-grounded dialogue generation with the KGs. We propose an end-to-end dialogue generation framework that considers all aspects from knowledge retrieval, encoding, and reflection along the generation process.\nAs a first step, we propose a context-relevant subgraph retriever that retrieves only the relevant triplets from KGs to prevent the model from generating context-irrelevant responses.\nNotably, our subgraph retrieval method embeds the KG considering it relational structure with the Graph Neural Network (GNN)  instead of using PLMs as in previous work .\nFurthermore, without any labels for pairs of dialogue contexts and their relevant subgraphs, our method is end-to-end trainable jointly with the generation objective by marginalizing the likelihood of the generated sentences over the latent retrieved subgraph  .\nThen, to encode the retrieved subgraph along with the input text sequence, we propose a graph encoding that is permutation and relation inversion invariant yet efficient. Specifically, we devise the graph encoding method that reflects the graph structure onto the representation space of PLMs, instead of prepending them in front of the text sequence to avoid the computational burden.\nFurthermore, to ensure that the model does make use of the encoded knowledge when generating responses, we propose a multi-modal contrastive learning objective between two different graph-text modalities to enforce consistency across the retrieved facts and the generated texts.\nWe call our framework SUbgraph Retrieval-augmented GEneration (SURGE). We validate our SURGE framework on the OpendialKG  and KOMODIS  datasets.\nNote that, when evaluating the generated responses from dialogue models, conventional metrics (e.g., BLEU ; Rouge ) can not measure how faithfully the generated responses reflect the related knowledge in KGs.\nThus, in evaluation, we further introduce an additional performance metric, referred to as Knowledge-verifying Question Answering (KQA), which evaluates whether the generated responses contain the correct knowledge with an additional extractive question answering scheme. The experimental results show that SURGE generates responses that not only agree with the gold knowledge but are also consistent with the retrieved knowledge from KGs. Our contributions are summarized as follows: We propose a GNN-based context-relevant subgraph retriever that extracts the context-relevant piece of knowledge from KGs, for generating appropriate responses to the ongoing conversation. We propose an invariant yet efficient graph encoder and a graph-text contrastive learning objective to ensure that the generated responses faithfully reflect the retrieved knowledge. We validate our SURGE framework against relevant baselines, demonstrating its efficacy in generating responses that are more informative by retrieving and reflecting the relevant knowledge."
