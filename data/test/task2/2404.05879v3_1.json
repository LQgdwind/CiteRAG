    "merge trees distance": "Many distances on merge trees exist:\ninterleaving [ref]32 , edit\ndistance  , functional\ndistortion , and the universal distance . While these distances are valuable for their\nstability and\ndiscriminatory capabilities, computing these distances often becomes impractical\ndue to their NP-Hard nature  0. Recent efforts aim to define more computationally feasible distances for merge trees.\nFor instance, the edit distance on merge trees, as discussed\nin [ref]44 [ref]45, identifies the\noptimal edit operations between merge trees and has been experimentally shown to be more\ndiscriminative than both the bottleneck and one-Wasserstein 7 distances. The latter\nreference [ref]45 introduced the local merge tree edit distance, specifically designed\nto analyze local similarities within merge trees. Despite the work\nin  demonstrating greater discriminative power than the\npreviously proposed edit distances for merge trees, by employing a new set of improved\nedit operations, the computational cost is significantly higher, which hinders\ntheir practical application. The interleaving distance requires an initial labeling of the\nmerge trees, followed by the identification of the optimal matching between the labeled merge\ntrees. This process, which establishes a computable metric known as the labeled\ninterleaving distance, is introduced in . Yan et\nal.  adapted this distance for practical use and\nincorporated geometric information into the labeling strategy\nin .\nSimilarly, Curry et al. 5 employed the\nGromov–Wasserstein distance to label merge trees and compute the labeled interleaving\ndistance. Branch decomposition trees (BDTs) represent another method that first converts\nmerge trees into BDTs (i.e., transferring edges of merge trees as nodes in a new tree), and then\nfinds pairwise matching between these transformed\ntrees      .\nThis process adds extra computational steps, further increasing complexity. Applications utilizing merge trees distances, such as sketching \nor encoding merge trees  , primarily operate\nin the original space, necessitating optimal matching between merge trees or their BDT\nvariants. Machine learning has been used for merge trees in the work of Pont et al. , who applied neural\nnetworks to merge trees for compression and dimensionality reduction. Our work focuses\non fast comparison. The previous work also uses a novel but classic auto-encoder with merge trees and BDTs\nas input, requiring a transformation step. In addition, their model is not designed to be\ngeneralizable across datasets, and their use of Wasserstein distance in training\nis computationally more intensive than our approach. In summary, existing work either proposes a rigorous definition of distance with\ntheoretical guarantees but with NP-Hard computation or describes a similarity\nmeasure with practical applications that still require optimal matching between\nmerge trees. No existing work focuses on mapping merge trees into vector space for efficient\ncomparison. The closest approach is the work of Qin et al.  who map topological\npersistence diagrams to a hash for fast comparison. Merge trees are a more expressive and\nmore complex topological abstraction than these diagrams. \nIn our work, we utilize GNNs to map the merge trees into a vector space and\nre-frame merge tree comparison as a learning task."
