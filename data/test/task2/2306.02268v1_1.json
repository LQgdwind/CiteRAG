    "comparison on ms-coco:": "Partially labeled data setting:\nThis section compares our network with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) SSOD methods under the partially labeled data setting. The corresponding average mAP measures of 5 folds are noted in Table 2.\nFrom the table, we can observe that the proposed network outperforms all other methods and obtain +0.25%, and +1.34% higher mAP values than previous best performing SOTA methods  0 on 1%, and 10% labeled data, respectively. While in case of 5% labeled data setting, it performs slightly inferior than SOTA methods  0. \n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\nRemarks\n 1%\n 5%\n 10%\n\n\n\nSoft-teacher\nICCV 2021\n20.46 ± 0.39\n30.74 ± 0.08\n34.04 ± 0.14\n\nACRST \nArxiv 2021\n26.07 ± 0.46\n31.35 ± 0.13\n34.92 ± 0.22\n\nDDT [ref]36\nAAAI 2022\n19.44 ± 0.32\n29.92 ± 0.12\n33.46 ± 0.18\n\nCST 4\nACM MM 2022\n22.73 ± 0.14\n30.83 ± 0.08\n33.90 ± 0.17\n\nActive Teacher 7\nCVPR 2022\n22.20\n30.07\n32.58\n\nMA-GCP [ref]8\nCVPR 2022\n21.31 ± 0.28\n31.67 ± 0.16\n35.02 ± 0.26\n\nDCST \nIJCAI 2022\n23.02 ± 0.23\n32.10 ± 0.15\n35.20 ± 0.20\n\nPseCo 0\nECCV 2022\n22.43 ± 0.36\n32.50 ± 0.08\n36.06 ± 0.24\n\nLabelMatch \nCVPR 2022\n25.81 ± 0.28\n32.70 ± 0.18\n35.49 ± 0.17\n\nPolishing Teacher \nAAAI 2023\n23.55 ± 0.25\n32.10 ± 0.15\n35.30 ± 0.15\n\nOurs\n—\n26.32 ± 0.35\n32.21 ± 0.08\n37.40 ± 0.15\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\nRemarks\n Extra Dataset\n mAP\n\n\n\nSelf-training \nNIPS 2020\nImageNet+OpenImages\n41.1 →+0.80.8→\\xrightarrow{+0.8} 41.9\n\nSoft-teacher \nICCV 2021\nunlabeled2017\n40.9 →+3.63.6→\\xrightarrow{+3.6} 44.5\n\nMA-GCP [ref]8\nCVPR 2022\nunlabeled2017\n40.9 →+5.05.0→\\xrightarrow{+5.0} 45.9\n\nLabelMatch \nCVPR 2022\nunlabeled2017\n40.3 →+5.05.0→\\xrightarrow{+5.0} 45.3\n\nDDT [ref]36\nAAAI 2022\nunlabeled2017\n37.6 →+4.64.6→\\xrightarrow{+4.6} 42.2\n\nCST 4\nACM MM 2022\nunlabeled2017\n37.6 →+5.75.7→\\xrightarrow{+5.7} 43.3\n\nDTG-SSOD \nArxiv 2022\nunlabeled2017\n40.9 →+4.84.8→\\xrightarrow{+4.8} 45.7\n\nPseCo 0\nECCV 2022\nunlabeled2017\n41.0 →+5.15.1→\\xrightarrow{+5.1} 46.1\n\nDCST \nIJCAI 2022\nunlabeled2017\n40.9 →+3.73.7→\\xrightarrow{+3.7} 44.6\n\nOurs\n—\nunlabeled2017\n37.9 →+6.1+6.1→\\xrightarrow{\\textbf{+6.1}} 44.0\n\n\n Fully labeled data setting:\nHere, we compare our network with other methods in the fully labeled data setting.
