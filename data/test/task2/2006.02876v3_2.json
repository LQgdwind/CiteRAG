    "back-translation": "It is expected, as shown in many studies (e.g. [ref]4, ), that a better synthetic data generated using a good backward model will result in an improved forward model. We used the outputs of the backward models – synth-A and synth-B – to train final forward models. We expected the quality of synth-B to be better since it was generated using the best backward model among those trained in the experiments above. Both of the models trained using the standard back-translation and the pre-training and fine-tuning approaches performed better than the models trained using the same approaches but with synth-A (see Fig.  3). Table  4 shows the performance of the models trained: without synthetic data; with synth-A and; with synth-B. The best model was obtained through pre-training and fine-tuning using authentic data and synth-B. The model out-performed the baseline forward model by a BLEU score of 7.78 (28.73 BLEU). Although using synth-A improved the performance of the forward model over the baseline (+4.92 and +5.08 BLEUs using standard back-translation and pre-training and fine-tuning respectively), the effect of the backward model self-training ensured that the quality of synth-B was superior and the model trained using this data improved the forward model further by over +2 BLEU."
