This probability is the worst case success probability over all possible pairs (x,i)𝑥𝑖(x,i) of input string x∈{−1,1}n𝑥superscript11𝑛x\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{n} and recoverable bit i∈{1,…,n}𝑖1…𝑛i\\in\\{1,\\dots,n\\}. Many different resources can be used during the encoding and decoding, e.g. private randomness (PR), shared randomness (SR), shared entanglement, and even super-quantum correlations like Popescu-Rohrlich boxes . Regarding the classical RAC, Ambainis et al.  proved that there is no 2​↦𝑝​12𝑝maps-to12\\overset{p}{\\mapsto}1 RAC (and 2m​↦𝑝​msuperscript2𝑚𝑝maps-to𝑚2^{m}\\overset{p}{\\mapsto}m RAC by extension) with PR and worst case success probability p>1/2𝑝12p>1/2. On the other hand, Ambainis et al. [ref]5 showed that RACs with SR can achieve success probability p>1/2𝑝12p>1/2. The optimal n​↦𝑝​1𝑛𝑝maps-to1n\\overset{p}{\\mapsto}1 RAC with SR has success probability For a general number of encoded bits, Ambainis et al.  developed a RAC with PR using a specific code from  which matches their classical lower bound m≥(1−H​(p))​n𝑚1𝐻𝑝𝑛m\\geq(1-H(p))n up to an additive logarithmic term, where H​(p)=−p​log2⁡p−(1−p)​log2⁡(1−p)𝐻𝑝𝑝subscript2𝑝1𝑝subscript21𝑝H(p)=-p\\log_{2}{p}-(1-p)\\log_{2}(1-p) is the binary entropy function. There is an n​↦𝑝​m𝑛𝑝maps-to𝑚n\\overset{p}{\\mapsto}m RAC with PR and m≤(1−H​(p))​n+7​log2⁡n𝑚1𝐻𝑝𝑛7subscript2𝑛m\\leq(1-H(p))n+7\\log_{2}{n} for any p>12𝑝12p>\\frac{1}{2}. As for QRACs, Ambainis et al.  showed the existence of a 2​↦𝑝​12𝑝maps-to12\\overset{p}{\\mapsto}1 QRAC with PR111Usually private randomness is already assumed in QRACs under the encoding onto density matrices. and p=12+12​2≈0.85𝑝121220.85p=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\approx 0.85, and the existence of a 3​↦𝑝​13𝑝maps-to13\\overset{p}{\\mapsto}1 QRAC with PR and p=12+12​3≈0.79𝑝121230.79p=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\approx 0.79 (the second attributed to Chuang). Later Hayashi et al.  showed the impossibility of a 4​↦𝑝​14𝑝maps-to14\\overset{p}{\\mapsto}1 QRAC (and 4m​↦𝑝​msuperscript4𝑚𝑝maps-to𝑚4^{m}\\overset{p}{\\mapsto}m QRAC by extension) with PR and success probability p>1/2𝑝12p>1/2. Similarly to the classical case, Ambainis et al. [ref]5 showed that QRACs can also benefit from SR. There is an n​↦𝑝​1𝑛𝑝maps-to1n\\overset{p}{\\mapsto}1 QRAC with SR and 222Ambainis et al. [ref]5 do not give the high order terms, but these can be calculated by following their procedure together with [30, Equation 2.198]. The specific case of m=2𝑚2m=2 encoding qubits was explored in   . For the general case of m>1𝑚1m>1, Iwama et al.  constructed an (4m−1)​↦𝑝​msuperscript4𝑚1𝑝maps-to𝑚(4^{m}-1)\\overset{p}{\\mapsto}m QRAC with PR and p=12+12​(2m−1)​2m+1𝑝1212superscript2𝑚1superscript2𝑚1p=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2(2^{m}-1)\\sqrt{2^{m}+1}} (such construction also works for all n<4m𝑛superscript4𝑚n<4^{m}). On the other hand, Ambainis et al.  proved that if an n​↦𝑝​m𝑛𝑝maps-to𝑚n\\overset{p}{\\mapsto}m QRAC with PR and p>1/2𝑝12p>1/2 exists, then m=Ω​(n/log⁡n)𝑚Ω𝑛𝑛m=\\Omega(n/\\log{n}), which was later improved to m≥(1−H​(p))​n𝑚1𝐻𝑝𝑛m\\geq(1-H(p))n by Nayak 3, thus matching the same classical lower bound from . The idea of decoding a function of the initial bits instead of a single bit was already considered by Ben-Aroya, Regev and de Wolf  (who also considered recovering multiple bits rather than just one). More specifically, they defined an n​↦𝑝​m𝑛𝑝maps-to𝑚n\\overset{p}{\\mapsto}m XORksubscriptXOR𝑘\\operatorname{XOR}_{k}-QRAC, where n𝑛n bits are encoded into m𝑚m qubits such that the parity of any k𝑘k initial bits can be recovered with success probability at least p𝑝p.333In their definition the success probability is the average over random k𝑘k-subsets and random inputs, which, in our context, is equivalent to using SR. Using their hypercontractive inequality for matrix-valued functions, they proved the following upper bound on the success probability. For any η>2​ln⁡2𝜂22\\eta>2\\ln{2} there is a constant Cηsubscript𝐶𝜂C_{\\eta} such that, for any n​↦𝑝​m𝑛𝑝maps-to𝑚n\\overset{p}{\\mapsto}m XORksubscriptXOR𝑘\\operatorname{XOR}_{k}-QRAC with SR and k=o​(n)𝑘𝑜𝑛k=o(n), They conjectured that the factor η>2​ln⁡2𝜂22\\eta>2\\ln{2} can be dropped from the above bound, and thus extended to m/n>1/(2​ln⁡2)≈0.72𝑚𝑛1220.72m/n>1/(2\\ln{2})\\approx 0.72, although it might require a strengthening of their hypercontractive inequality. The use of shared entanglement in random access codes was first considered by Klauck  . Here the encoding and decoding parties are allowed to use an arbitrary amount of shared entangled states (note that shared entanglement can be used to obtain both private and shared randomness). The figure of merit in this generalization is the relation between n𝑛n, m𝑚m and p𝑝p, while the amount of shared entanglement is not taken into account. Klauck   considered an n​↦𝑝​m𝑛𝑝maps-to𝑚n\\overset{p}{\\mapsto}m QRAC with shared entanglement and, by its equivalence to the quantum one-way communication complexity for the index function, proved the lower bound m≥(1−H​(p))​n/2𝑚1𝐻𝑝𝑛2m\\geq(1-H(p))n/2, similar to Nayak’s bound. Later Pawłowski and Żukowski 8 coined the term entanglement-assisted random access code (EARAC), which is a RAC with shared entanglement, and studied the case when m=1𝑚1m=1, giving protocols with better decoding probabilities compared to the usual n​↦𝑝​1𝑛𝑝maps-to1n\\overset{p}{\\mapsto}1 QRAC with SR. Recently Tănăsescu et al.  expanded the idea of n​↦𝑝​1𝑛𝑝maps-to1n\\overset{p}{\\mapsto}1 EARACs to recovering an initial bit under a specific request distribution. The optimal n​↦𝑝​1𝑛𝑝maps-to1n\\overset{p}{\\mapsto}1 EARAC with SR has success probability The idea of (Q)RAC was generalized in other ways, e.g. parity-oblivious    and multiparty  versions, encoding on d𝑑d-valued qubits (qudits) [ref]6    , a wider range of information retrieval tasks  and a connection to Popescu-Rohrlich boxes. It was shown  that a Popescu-Rohrlich box can simulate a RAC by means of just one bit of communication, while in  the converse was proven. An object called racbox  was defined, which is a box that implements a RAC when supported with one bit of communication, and it was shown that a non-signaling racbox is equivalent to a Popescu-Rohrlich box. A quantum version of a racbox was later proposed in . Finally, we mention that RACs were also studied within “theories” that violate the uncertainty relation for anti-commuting observables and present stronger-than-quantum correlations ."
