    "evaluation in mot.": "To validate the effectiveness of our framework on real scenarios, we employ the multi-object tracking (MOT) problem as the task and embed our GLAN into MOT architecture as an assignment module. In the following, we will introduce the experimental settings and report the experimental results in detail. MOT can be tackled by exploiting the regression head of a detector to perform temporal alignment of object bounding boxes [ref]36. Based on the tracking pipeline in [ref]36 which adopts the Faster-RCNN [ref]37 as a detector, Xu et al.  embed the differentiable DHN into the MOT architecture to train the detector in an end-to-end manner. Similarly, we also combine the differentiable assignment solvers with the tracker in [ref]36 to verify their effectiveness in MOT tasks. Here, we exclude the DFC  because it is inflexible to cope with cost matrices with varying sizes. For simplicity, we name the tracker in [ref]36 FRT (Faster RCNN Tracker). In training, the matching between predicted bounding boxes and ground truth is viewed as an assignment problem, and the cost matrix is constructed according to center distance and Intersection-over-Union (IOU) between tracks and bounding boxes. Furthermore, we employ the soft MOTA and MOTP (please refer to  for the details of the construction of them) to guide the learning process. In the case of MOT, there can be different numbers of tracks and ground-truth objects, and the objects in the previous frame can be missed in the current frame or a new object can exist in the current frame. Therefore, in training, we remove the constraint loss to prevent the un-assigned track or object from having a high assignment score.\nIn evaluation, following the tracking pipeline in [ref]36, only the trained detector is used to perform tracking and the assignment solvers are not employed to facilitate the tracking process. The performance of each tested method on MOT benchmark MOT17  is evaluated by standard MOT metrics and is reported in Table 6. It is observed that trained along with differentiable assignment solvers, the performance of the tracker has been improved in most metrics.\nSpecifically, the learnable-free differentiable methods, RM , SD [ref]14 and SH , solve the assignment problem directly on the cost matrix, which allows the relationships between each pair of tracks and bounding boxes to be taken into consideration. Therefore, the trackers trained with these solvers have been improved on almost metrics. Despite the improvements achieved by learning-based baselines, there are still several limitations to enhancing the tracker. In detail, the BDL  splits the assignment problem into several classification sub-tasks, but the relationships between these sub-tasks are not involved in solving the original assignment problems. The DHN  transforms the cost matrix to a sequential pattern and passes it to an RNN-based model to extract discriminative representations from the global scope. However, it is unsuitable to solve the time-independent problem with the RNN-based model. Besides, the DCNN  regards the cost matrix as an image and employs stacked CNN layers to obtain the assignment prediction. But the predicted assignments always reach the local optima when the size of problems exceeds the receptive fields. In virtue of the structure of the bipartite graph constructed from the cost matrix, the proposed framework GLAN can well capture the global inductive information through message passing, and the tracker trained with GLAN achieves the best results in terms of most metrics. Specifically, in MOT17, both our model and RM  achieve the best improvement in terms of MOTA (+2.9%percent2.9+2.9\\%), MOTP (+0.9%percent0.9+0.9\\%) and MT (+1.8%percent1.8+1.8\\%) over FRT [ref]36.\nBesides, the tracker combined with our GLAN also obtains the best results in terms of ML and FN, which demonstrates the effectiveness and adaptability of our method for MOT task."
