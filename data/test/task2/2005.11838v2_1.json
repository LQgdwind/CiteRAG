  "sections": {
    "speech and name representation": "In this paper, we propose a novel representation for names, which uses automated speech and deep learning to deal with problems associated with names, such as similar name suggestion  and record linkage .\nMost of the well-known approaches aimed at handling these problems emphasize character or word similarities (e.g., the edit distance string similarity algorithm).\nIn contrast to these approaches, SpokenName2Vec addresses these problems by utilizing the power of speech to find similar names.\nIn addition to the use of speech for conveying ideas and expressing feelings , it has been helpful for other related tasks, such as voice recognition , speaker recognition , analyzing human behavior , Internet communication , name suggestion , and more.\nOften there are several variations of names (e.g., Smith, and Smyt), which are written differently but pronounced the same.\nFocusing on the way names are pronounced instead of how they are written can be a salient advantage for the detection of synonyms.\nFor this, we use open-source and publicly available services for generating automated speech, e.g., the Text2Speech website333https://www.text2speech.org/ and Google Text-to-Speech.444https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech The data science revolution of the last decade has resulted in the development of many products that use machine and deep learning algorithms, including products for filtering spam images, image recognition, and more.\nAmong the pioneers of these algorithms were Mikolov et al. , who in 2013\nintroduced Word2Vec’s architecture for word embedding.\nWord2Vec is a generic method encompassing two representation learning models: continuous bag of words (CBOW) and skip-gram.\nBoth models are simple feed-forward neural network architectures that are used for computing continuous vector representations of words from very large datasets.\nThe vector representations of words learned by Word2Vec held promise for maintaining semantic meanings, a trait that is useful for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification , information retrieval [ref]24, etc.\nIn 2014, Le and Mikolov [ref]25 extended the Word2Vec methodology and suggested Doc2Vec, a fixed-dimensional vector representation for sentences and documents using a paragraph vector.\nThis additional vector remembers the context or the topic of each paragraph, which was shown to be useful for capturing the semantics of paragraphs, sentences, and documents.\nIn recent years, many researchers, inspired by the novel Word2Vec algorithm, have suggested utilizing the power of representation learning on various domains that are not necessarily related to NLP.\nExamples of the models proposed include Node2Vec , App2Vec , Song2Vec [ref]28, and Emoji2Vec , and more. In 2018, Chung and Glass  proposed Speech2Vec, a speech version of Word2Vec.\nTo train their model, they used LibriSpeech, a corpus of 500 hours of English speech, to learn Speech2Vec embeddings.\nThey compared their model with the classic Word2Vec algorithm on word similarity tasks.\nLater that year, Chung et al.  tested the Speech2Vec models on the task of speech-to-text translation.\nIn 2019, Haque et al.  proposed spoken sentence embeddings.\nTheir results demonstrated that the proposed spoken sentence embeddings outperformed phoneme and word-level baselines on speech and emotion recognition tasks.\nIn the same year, Foxcroft et al.  presented Name2Vec, a method for name embeddings that employs the Doc2Vec methodology, where each surname is viewed as a document, and each letter constructing the name is considered a word.\nThey demonstrated the task of record linkage by training a few name embedding models on a dataset containing 250,000 surnames and tested their model on 25,000 verified name pairs from Ancestry.com.\nThey used the Ancestry Records dataset as positive samples and other 25,000 random name pairs as negative samples.\nThe authors concluded that the name embeddings generated can predict whether a pair of names match."
