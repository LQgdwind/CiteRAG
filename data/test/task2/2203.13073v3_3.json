    "our contribution": "The current work aims to determine the largest possible gap between the binary rank of regular 0,1010,1 matrices and the Boolean rank of their complement.\nOur main result is the following. For infinitely many integers k𝑘k, there exists a square regular 0,1010,1 matrix M𝑀M satisfying Theorem 1.1 can be viewed as a regular analogue of the aforementioned result of Balodis et al. [ref]2, showing that their near optimal separation between rankbin(M)subscriptrankbin𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(M) and rank𝔹(M¯)subscriptrank𝔹¯𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(\\overline{M}), which is achieved by irregular matrices M𝑀M, can also be attained by regular ones.\nSince every 0,1010,1 matrix M𝑀M satisfies rankbin(M¯)≥rank𝔹(M¯)subscriptrankbin¯𝑀subscriptrank𝔹¯𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(\\overline{M})\\geq{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(\\overline{M}), Theorem 1.1 settles, in a strong form, the question of Pullman asked in   (and the variants of the question mentioned there) and confirms the conjecture of Hefner et al. .\nWe remark that regular matrices M𝑀M with rank𝔹(M¯)subscriptrank𝔹¯𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(\\overline{M}) larger than rankbin(M)subscriptrankbin𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(M) can also be derived from  (see Section 1.2 for details). While these matrices are sufficient to answer the original question of  , they only achieve a polynomial gap between the quantities. The proof of Theorem 1.1 relies on a modification of the construction of [ref]2 to the regular setting.\nIt involves an extension of the query-to-communication lifting theorem in non-deterministic communication complexity proved by Göös, Lovett, Meka, Watson, and Zuckerman , as well as a two-source extractor studied by Bouda, Pivoluska, and Plesch [ref]4 and by Kothari, Meka, and Raghavendra . For an overview of the proof, see Section 1.2. As alluded to before, matrices M𝑀M with rankbin(M)subscriptrankbin𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(M) much smaller than rank𝔹(M¯)subscriptrank𝔹¯𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(\\overline{M}) are known to imply graphs G𝐺G with bp(G)bp𝐺\\mathop{\\mathrm{bp}}(G) much smaller than χ​(G)𝜒𝐺\\chi(G),\nand thus yield counterexamples to the Alon-Saks-Seymour conjecture (see ).\nAlthough the conjecture is false in general, it is of interest to identify classes of graphs that satisfy a polynomial version of the conjecture.\nIn particular, it was asked in [ref]2 whether the chromatic number of perfect graphs is polynomially upper bounded in terms of their biclique partition number (see  for a related question; see also   ).\nAs an application of Theorem 1.1, we show that this is not the case for the class of regular graphs.\nNamely, we show that the near optimal separation achieved in [ref]2 between the biclique partition number and the chromatic number can also be attained by regular graphs. For infinitely many integers k𝑘k, there exists a simple regular graph G𝐺G satisfying"
