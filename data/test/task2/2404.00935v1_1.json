    "appendix c: a list of recent nisq experiments": "Here is a (partial) list of recent NISQ experiments that can be used for statistical analysis of samples from NISQ computers either based on tools of our papers or additional tools. Fourier methods may be relevant to several theoretical and empirical aspects related to these papers. Random circuit sampling experiments: There are several related experiments on random circuit sampling. Most recently, the Google team presented a study  which is similar to  with larger circuits. Earlier a team from USTC repeated the Google RCS experiment with their Zuchongzhi quantum computer . There are several works stating progress on quantum error correction for both on superconducting quantum computers, ion-trapped quantum computers, and other types of quantum computers: the paper  by the Google team describes realizations of distance-3 and distance-5 surface codes on Sycamore; Quantinuum’s ion trap fault tolerance experiments  ; the Yale group’s experiment ; a recent paper by Harvard/MIT/QuEra group  (See Section 8.6 for prelimimary analysis of data from that paper.) There are various interesting experiments by the Google AI team using the Sycamore quantum computer. The paper 6 describes “time crystals”: The paper  describes simulations of 9-qubit states related to models of wormholes. Several experiments from the IBM team (and other teams working on IBM quantum computers) for demonstrating high quantum volume. See, for example, . A recent work 4 by the IBM quantum team on the Ising model using a 127-qubit computation demonstrating various techniques of error mitigation. Two experiments by Pokharel and Lidar   stating speedup of Bernstein-Vazirani’s and Grover’s algorithms on IBM’s quantum computers. In the paper  by a team from Los Alamos National Laboratory, the authors performed their own series of quantum volume calculations on twenty four NISQ devices offered by IBM, IonQ, Rigetti, Oxford Quantum Circuits, and Quantinuum (formerly Honeywell).\n Majorana zero-mode and Kitaev’s chain based on (ordinary) quantum computers. There is much effort (largely encouraged by Microsoft) to demonstrate Majorana zero modes in physical systems and in parallel there is also some effort to simulate such quantum states on quantum computers. See  (on an IBM quantum computer), [ref]34 (on an IBM quantum computer) and 7 (on Google’s quantum computer). Boson sampling experiments. We already mentioned the experiment described in 2 by a group from USTC. Another experiment by a team from Xanadu is described in 5."
