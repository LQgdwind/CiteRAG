    "ii-b2 uav irs assisted terrestrial communications": "In practice, small lightweight UAVs usually can support only a limited payload, and may not be able to carry bulky RF transceivers in BSs/relays. Besides, such active nodes generally incur high energy consumption, which further aggravates the energy consumption of UAVs and limits endurance. Furthermore, in terrestrial wireless networks, the deployment of IRS is highly restricted by the availability of the existing infrastructure such as building facades, lamp posts, and advertising boards. As such, unlike the case in Fig. 2 (a), it may not be possible to find proper deployment locations for installing an IRS to establish the desired (virtual) LoS links between the transceivers. Compared to terrestrial IRS, a UAV-based IRS (UIRS) is more likely to have strong LoS links with the ground nodes due to the relatively higher altitude and mobility of UAVs, thus reducing the probability of a blockage between them [ref]135. This is particularly important for high frequency mmWave and THz communication systems that are very sensitive to blockage . For example, as shown in Fig. 2 (b), since an IRS only reflects the signals to its front halfspace, deploying an IRS on the building facade only helps to enhance the communication data rate of user 1 and the lack of coverage behind the building remains still unsolved. Although it is possible to connect user 2 to the BS via multi-hop IRS reflections if multiple IRSs are deployed, this requires properly located buildings in the surrounding environment as well as additional multi-IRS coordination and signal processing complexity. In this case, deploying a UAV equipped with an IRS is practically appealing .\nMore importantly, UAVs with high mobility are able to adapt their positions dynamically according to the changes in the communication environment and thus can maintain persistent (virtual) LoS links between transceivers. To provide some insights on UIRS deployment, in Fig. 2 (b), we focus on the UIRS-aided communication for user 2 and the BS-user distance is D𝐷D m. The BS-UIRS horizontal distance is d𝑑d m and the UIRS’s altitude is H𝐻H m. We optimize the horizontal location of the UIRS (d𝑑d) to maximize the achievable rate/signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of user 2. For simplicity, LoS channels are assumed for both the BS-UIRS and UIRS-user links, while the BS-user direct link is assumed to be severely blocked and thus ignored. Then, the receive SNR at user 2 assuming optimal IRS passive beamforming is given by   where P𝑃P denotes the BS transmit power, β0subscript𝛽0\\beta_{0} denotes the channel power gain at a reference distance of 111 m, N𝑁N denotes the number of IRS reflecting elements, and σ2superscript𝜎2\\sigma^{2} denotes the receiver noise power. By setting the first-order derivative of the denominator with respect to d𝑑d to zero, the optimal UIRS placement for maximizing the receive SNR can be easily derived as   It is interesting to note that depending on the values of H𝐻H and D𝐷D, the optimal deployment location changes from the midpoint to locations with equal distances to the transmitter (BS) and the receiver (user 2), as also verified in Fig. 3 for P=20𝑃20P=20 dBm, β0=−30subscript𝛽030\\beta_{0}=-30 dB, N=250𝑁250N=250, σ2=−100superscript𝜎2100\\sigma^{2}=-100 dBm, and D=400𝐷400D=400 m. Considering that D𝐷D in practice is expected to be considerably larger than H𝐻H to obtain effective reflection from the UIRS, the UIRS should be deployed close to the transceivers, which is quite different from the deployment strategy for active relays. Nevertheless, practical UIRS deployment also needs to consider other factors such as LoS versus non-LoS links, channel rank and condition number, and the use of a single large UIRS or multiple smaller cooperative UIRSs  [ref]98 . Furthermore, the physical UIRS elements orientation also has a great effect on the air-ground channel characteristics and hence the system performance, which calls for further investigation in future. However, there has been only limited work in this line of research so far   [ref]133  [ref]135. In [ref]135, the minimum SNR within a given rectangular service area (e.g., a hot spot in a cellular network) was maximized by jointly optimizing aerial IRS placement, the IRS phase shifts, and the transmit beamforming at the BS. To gain useful insights, the authors first derived the optimal UIRS placement and phase shifts for the special case of single-location SNR maximization, where the optimal horizontal location was shown to depend only on the ratio between the UIRS height and the source-destination distance. As for the general case of area coverage enhancement, an efficient two-step method was proposed by decoupling the phase-shift optimization from the UIRS placement design, where a 3D beam broadening and flattening technique was proposed to obtain 3D beam patterns matching the service area size on the ground . For mobile users in practical systems, the dynamic self-positioning of UIRS is required, which motivated the work in . Specifically, to maximize the downlink mmWave communication capacity of a mobile outdoor user, a reinforcement learning (RL) approach based on Q-learning and neural networks was proposed in  to enable efficient deployment and phase-shift optimization for a self-sustained UIRS. The main advantage of this approach lies in that it requires no prior knowledge of the dynamic environment, but learns the characteristics of the environment during the service process of the UIRS, based on data measurements and feedback received during each communication stage. The results showed that significant gains can be achieved by using such a UIRS as compared to a static IRS in terms of the average data rate as well as the LoS probability. Yet, to simplify the system design, it was assumed in  that the BS only transmits, and thus, the UIRS only reflects signals during the hovering state."
