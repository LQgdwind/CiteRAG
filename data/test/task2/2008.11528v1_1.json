    "introduction": "The stability analysis of structures with particular reference to the identification of the critical buckling load is a canonical problem in structural analysis and design. An extensive body of literature is available on this topic in the general area of classical (local) elasticity, which is built upon a point-wise correspondence of the kinematic and material variables via the constitutive relations. Comprehensive reviews of the stability of elastic structures following classical elasticity theories can be found in  . While this class of so-called local approaches has been, and still is, a fundamental tool to model the behavior of solids, experimental observations have shown that the nonlocal interactions between extended areas of the solid (i.e. between distant points) can have a non-negligible effect on the global response of the medium. These effects, which are a macroscopic manifestation of long-distance interactions between distant points, are not accounted for in classical local theories. Although nonlocal effects have been traditionally restricted to the context of micro- and nano-scale systems  , examples can be found in a broader range of applications including macro-scale complex media such as sandwich structures as well as functionally graded and porous materials  . During the past several decades, several theories have been proposed to model the effect of the nonlocal interactions in elastic solids. Prominent theories were proposed by Kron̈er  and Eringen et al.  involving strain-based integral constitutive relations. These approaches accounted for the nonlocal interactions within the constitutive relations via a convolution of the local strain with a kernel defined over the domain of influence. In the context of stability analysis, the critical buckling load of slender structures performed using this strain-based integral formulation  0 predicted a consistent reduction of the critical loads due to the nonlocal effect. While these strain-based integral formulations were powerful and somewhat very intuitive, the integral definition of the constitutive relation  belongs to an ill-posed class of integral equations involving Fredholm integral equations of the first kind, which do not admit unique solutions. Successively, gradient based models of nonlocal elasticity were developed in order to circumvent the issues typical of implicit integral formulations 1. In most cases, the differential equivalent of the single-phase model 2 3 4 0 predicted a consistent reduction of the critical loads caused by the nonlocal effect, however paradoxical observations were noted for certain choices of loading and boundary conditions. These observations could be attributed to the non-self adjoint nature of the linear operators obtained following the differential models for Eringen’s nonlocal elasticity 5 6. Also, note that the differential models are equivalent to their integral counterparts only under certain assumptions for the kernel used in the convolution integral defined assuming an unbounded medium 7. To address this important issue a two-phase definition (i.e. local/non-local) of the constitutive relations was proposed. This definition admits unique solutions and is generally well-posed in nature leading to self-adjoint linear operators 8. The critical load analysis performed using this two-phase formulation 9 also predicted a consistent reduction of the critical loads caused by the nonlocal effects. While the two-phase models present unique solutions with a consistent nonlocal nature across loading and boundary conditions, this characteristic property is lost in the limit of vanishing local fractions, as also noted in 6. More specifically, in the limit of a vanishing local fraction, the inherent ill-posedness of fully strain-driven integral problem is not eliminated in the two-phase model. This consideration is at the basis of restrictions on the parameter space that determines the ratio of the local and nonlocal mixture. Further, these strain-driven integral models also do not satisfy the thermodynamic balance laws in a rigorous manner.\nMore specifically, it has been observed that thermomechanical deformation, obtained via this approach, satisfies the second law of thermodynamics only in a weak (integral) sense and not in a strong (localized) manner 8 0 1. The above observations highlight that there are still some important limitations in the existing nonlocal elasticity theories that affects, although are not limited to, the stability analysis of nonlocal structures. Recall that, in classical elasticity, the critical load is the ratio of the material and the geometric stiffness of the structures (Rayleigh-Ritz coefficient) . In the context of nonlocal elasticity, it is expected that the effects of the nonlocal interactions will be realized upon both of these stiffness terms. However, studies employing the Eringen’s strain-integral models of nonlocal elasticity attributed the consistent decrease in the critical load to a reduction of material stiffness caused by nonlocal effects, while the geometric stiffness was essentially unaffected  0. In contrast, the decrease in critical loads predicted by differential models (for those cases not leading to paradoxical observations) was attributed to an increase in geometric stiffness of the structure while the material stiffness was left unaffected 2 0. A comparison of these contrasting approaches for the calculation of the critical load of nonlocal structures indicates that the strain-integral model predicts a sharper reduction over its equivalent differential model2. Following the above discussion, it is clear that the both the strain-based integral and differential approaches modify either the material or the geometric stiffness2. However, the physical realization of the nonlocal effects should not be limited to either one of these structural stiffness terms. Clearly there is a gap in proper accounting for the nonlocal effects on the structural stiffness terms, and a clear understanding of this would be required for the stability studies of nonlocal structures. Recently, the development of fractional-order continuum theories for nonlocal elasticity has offered alternative methodologies that could potentially help filling this gap 3 4 5. In recent years, fractional calculus has garnered increasing attention thanks to its many applications in different fields of science and engineering. Successful applications include, to name a few, constitutive modeling of viscoelastic materials to study memory effects 6 7, nonlocal effects across multiple spatial scales 3 8, dissipation in heat transfer 9. Numerous models for nonlocal elasticity based on the fractional calculus have also been proposed 0 3 4 5. Among the aforementioned studies, studies based on fractional-order kinematic approaches are particularly exciting since they have been able to address key limitations of both integral and gradient based approaches to nonlocal elasticity 5 8. More specifically, modeling nonlocal interactions at the level of the kinematics in a frame-invariant and dimensionally consistent manner, allows obtaining localized material constitutive relations free from nonlocal residual terms. The resulting nonlocal models allowed the rigorous application of the thermodynamic principles without any physical inconsistency 1. In other terms, the fractional-order kinematic approach allows for a strong (or localized) imposition of the first and second laws of thermodynamics at each point within the continuum 1. This result is unlike the classical nonlocal approaches based on the integral-form of the material constitutive relations that, instead, allow only a weak imposition of the thermodynamic balance laws over the entire domain.\nFurther, the positive-definite deformation energy density achieved with this definition guarantees the uniqueness of the solution and allows the application of variational principles as well as the development of finite element based solutions 1 2. This fractional-order formulation has been employed to study the effects of nonlocal elasticity on both the linear and geometrically nonlinear response of beams and plates 1 3 2 4. Large deformation analysis of nonlocal structures can be effectively carried out using geometrically nonlinear fractional-order kinematic relations 3 4. This framework facilitated by the fractional-order models provide the foundation required for an energy-based stability analysis of nonlocal structures. In this study, building upon the existing geometrically nonlinear fractional-order kinematic approach to nonlocal continuum theory, we develop a framework for the stability analysis of nonlocal slender structures. As will be shown later, the fractional-order kinematic relations allow the nonlocal effects to be accounted for on both the material and the geometric stiffness terms. The objective of the current work is two-fold. First, the conditions necessary to achieve structural stability of fractional-order nonlocal solids are derived following an energy approach. As part of this goal, we establish the Lagrange-Dirichlet theorem for fractional-order continua and apply it to obtain the critical loads for buckling of nonlocal structures. Note that the energy based approach to stability is possible due to the positive-definite potential energy characteristic of the fractional-order models for nonlocal elasticity 1 1. Second, we apply the stability theory to perform a critical load analysis for the linear buckling of fractional-order beams and plates. For this purpose, we make use of the fractional finite element model (f-FEM) for numerical solution of the eigenvalue stability problem and to perform a parametric analysis to assess the effect of the fractional-order nonlocality on the critical buckling load. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: we begin with the development of a framework of stability analysis for the fractional-order models of nonlocal elasticity. Later, we use this framework to derive the theoretical and numerical models for nonlocal beams and plates using variational principles. Finally, we use a f-FEM approach to evaluate the critical loads corresponding to the fractional-order nonlocal structures to determine the effect of the nonlocal interactions on the buckling loads."
