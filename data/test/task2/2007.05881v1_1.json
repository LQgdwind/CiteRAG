    "record linkage": "The goal of record linkage is to identify records in the same or different databases that refer to the same real-world entity, even if the records are not identical . The same task in other domains is referred to as entity matching, entity resolution or database deduplication. It is a crucial task for data integration and data cleaning and it has a massive financial impact on companies that store and work with large databases . The general process of record linkage consists of four steps: data cleaning and standardisation, indexing, record pair comparison and similarity vector classification . The main task of data cleaning and standardisation is the conversion of raw input data into well defined, consistent forms, as well as the resolution of inconsistencies in the way information, is represented and encoded . The indexing step aims to reduce the number of comparisons between the records in the databases by dismissing record pairs who are non-matching. This is done by techniques like blocking , which will not be covered in this thesis. The record pair comparison uses a variety of comparison functions (similarity metrics) appropriate to the content of the record fields. These similarity metrics are divided into four categories: Character-based, Token-based, Phonetic and Numeric similarity metrics . With character-based similarity metrics we measure the distance between fields on character level, with token-based we compare them on the word level and we use numeric similarity metrics if we compare numbers. Phonetic similarity metrics are used when two words are written in different languages, therefore phonetically they are similar but on character level, they would be very dissimilar. Widely used character-based similarity metrics are Edit-distance, Levenshtein distance and Jaro-Winkler distance, while for token-based similarity researchers have used metrics like TF-IDF cosine similarity, Jaccard coefficient and probabilistic analogues . The problem with these similarity metrics is that they are good for specific datasets and task, therefore making them not robust enough. For example, Edit-distance is suitable for common typing mistakes but it may be costly operation for large strings and problematic for specific domains . Only a few attempts for comparative evaluations of some sub-approaches have been made in terms of evaluation of different string similarity metrics, but most published entity resolution evaluations focus on individual approaches and use diverse methodologies, measures, and test problems making it difficult to assess the quality of each approach, not to mention their comparative effectiveness and efficiency . Furthermore,  find that matching product entities from online shops is not sufficiently solved with conventional approaches based on the similarity of attribute values because these approaches have poor classification performance. This means that matching records from online shops is a challenging resolution task. The similarity metrics produce a numerical representation of the similarity between the entities. Non-learning systems have a pre-defined threshold  which decides whether two records are similar. This can be problematic because the data may be noisy or the similarity metric might output values that are not linearly separable. Therefore the system might achieve better performance if it was able to learn the threshold. To create a system that can learn the threshold parameter the system should include machine learning methods in its structure. The similarity metrics produce a similarity coefficient/vector, that is the input of a classifier which decides whether the pair is matching or not. These classifiers are based on supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. Supervised approaches aim at automating the process of record linkage. One of the more famous models is the Fellegi-Sunter model [ref]14, which approaches record linkage as a Bayesian inference problem. Its goal is to approximate the sets of similar and dissimilar item pairs by minimizing the number of matches that we are uncertain about. Other supervised solutions for record linkage include SVM [ref]5 and the CART algorithm  (decision trees) as the similarity vector classifier. However, supervised models require suitable labelled training data and providing such data requires manual effort. The drawback to these classifiers is that they are not robust enough, which means that when the data distribution changes slightly, new methods for feature extraction would be needed. As a solution to this problem, there are unsupervised methods for record linkage that propose different clustering techniques to group similar records together. The result of the clustering is that each cluster corresponds to a single distinct entity. One of the most cited solutions is Canopy clustering  where the dataset is first divided into smaller subsets (canopies) by computing the similarity between pairs with an extremely inexpensive method. After the canopies are built, a standard clustering algorithm is applied to the canopies and they are clustered by using a more expensive distance (similarity) metric. Significant computation is saved by eliminating all of the distance comparisons among points that do not fall within a common canopy . Other clustering algorithms have been explored, like the Star clustering algorithm, Ricochet family of clustering algorithms, Cut Clustering, Articulation Point Clustering, Markov Clustering and Correlation Clustering and what [ref]17 concluded is that none of these clustering algorithms produces perfect clusters. Therefore [ref]17 propose that the best approach is to retrain your model more frequently and keep the important quantitative information produced by these algorithms. This only reinforces the idea that these solutions are not robust enough and their scalability would be problematic since frequent retraining is computationally expensive for large training sets. A more recent unsupervised method was proposed by  where they introduced the idea of incremental graph clustering technique for the record linkage task, meaning that the matching rules evolve through iterations. The problem with unsupervised and supervised models is that there is no comparison between their performances and that they are mostly trained and evaluated on different datasets . For our research we used the Avito Duplicate Ads Detection dataset  and it contains labelled data about which pairs of advertisements (records) are similar and which are not. Because of this we decided to explore supervised modelling techniques. The current state-of-the-art solution for record linkage is Magellan which is an end-to-end EM (entity matching) system, that uses either supervised learning methods, rule-based methods or an ensemble of supervised learning and rule-based algorithms . All of the above-mentioned models work well with structured data, but classical machine learning methods may have difficulties matching textual instances because there are few meaningful features that we can create from raw text .  found that classical learning methods also perform poorly for the classification of matching product entities from online shops. Another issue is that our dataset contains images and a lot of hand-crafted feature engineering would be needed to capture the relevant visual features of each image."
