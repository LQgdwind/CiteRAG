    "related work": "As described before, topological abstractions can be simplified in a post-process (i)\nwith a tailored algorithm specific to each abstraction.\nSuch algorithms have been introduced for\nthe contour tree ,\nReeb graph ,\nand Morse-Smale complex .\nOur approach focuses on the pre-simplification of data\n(ii)—i.e., prior to the computation of any\ntopological abstraction.\nExisting methods for data pre-simplification can be classified in the\nfollowing two categories. Differences between removing undesired maxima (gray discs) while preserving\ndesired maxima (white disc) from an input scalar field f𝑓f via bridging (orange)\nand flattening (red).\nBridging\ncreates a monotone path from an undesired maximum along\nseparatrices towards a desired maximum by elevating the value of the\ncorresponding vertices (orange chains).\nIt modifies the global shape of level sets\nby joining the three super-level set components (dark gray areas above\ndashed line) with a connected path (see also\nSec. 1).\nIn contrast, flattening lowers all the vertices\nof an undesired\nhill to the closest saddle.\nHence, flattening completely removes the contours induced by undesired maxima while preserving the shape and topology of other contours.\nHere, only the unmodified super-level set component in the middle would remain. Numerical methods simplify an input scalar field given some constraints on the extrema to preserve, by computing a numerically optimized solution.\nSuch methods usually incorporate the extrema to preserve as hard constraints, while optimizing a geometrical criterion, such as smoothness.\nBremer et al.  introduced the first technique in\nthis line of work in which a simplified Morse-Smale complex\ndrives a per-cell, iterative simplification of the data via Laplacian\nsmoothing.\nThis method requires computing and simplifying the Morse-Smale complex,\nwhich can be computationally expensive.\nMoreover,\nthe method can require many time-intensive Laplacian\niterations to complete.\n\\jonasRevisionWeinkauf et al.  extend the work of Bremer et al.  by utilizing bi-Laplacian optimization to additionally enforce the continuity of the gradient across the separatrices of the Morse-Smale complex.\nIn geometry processing, several techniques have been introduced for the computation of smooth scalar fields given a small number of critical points serving as constraints  .\nFor instance, Patané et al.  introduce a technique combining least-squares approximation and Tikhonov regularization for the topology-driven simplification of scalar fields.\nThese approaches can also be extended to 3D scalar\nfields \\jonasRevision and to some extent to vector\nfields  . Although numerical methods can produce smooth outputs that respect given topological constraints,\nthey have two primary limitations.\nFirst, the iterative nature of the employed solvers\nresults in long computation times (typically minutes),\nwhich prohibits the interactive exploration of different simplification parameters.\nSecond,\nthey are prone to numerical instabilities that can result from an unsuitable\ntriangulation of the input domain or the numerical sensitivity of the\ngeometrical operators used in the optimization.\nTierny and Pascucci  illustrate that such instabilities frequently occur during Laplacian optimization and result in the presence of additional spurious critical points that prevent the solution from conforming strictly to the input constraints. Combinatorial methods, in contrast, are designed to generate outputs that are guaranteed by construction to conform to the input constraints.\nThis category of techniques can be seen as complementary to numerical\napproaches, as combinatorial methods can be used to fix, in a post-process, the\npossible artifacts generated by numerical methods.\nThe first approach for the combinatorial simplification of scalar data can be\nattributed to Edelsbrunner et al. for their work on\npersistence-driven simplification\n .\nGiven an input function f𝑓f and its persistence diagram \n(Sec. 3.3), the authors\nfirst simplify the diagram by removing all features below a persistence\nthreshold ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon.\nIn addition to showing that a scalar function g𝑔g strictly admitting this simplified diagram exists, they also introduce an algorithm to compute such a function g𝑔g with a bounded error to the input (‖f−g‖∞≤ϵsubscriptnorm𝑓𝑔italic-ϵ||f-g||_{\\infty}\\leq\\epsilon).\nTheir work can be viewed as a generalization of prior works in terrain modeling, where only minimum-saddle persistence pairs were simplified [ref]52  .\nAttali et al.  introduced a simplification algorithm for the case of filtrations of simplicial complexes.\nIn the context of Discrete Morse theory ,\nBauer et al.  showed that persistence-driven simplification\ncould be achieved with a combination of\nflattening\nand bridging that\nresults in a minimized error bound ‖f−g‖∞subscriptnorm𝑓𝑔||f-g||_{\\infty}.\nAlthough these methods were initially\nintroduced\nfor two-dimensional domains, they apply\nreadily for domains of higher dimensions.\nHowever, these methods—as well as our approach—do not support the\nremoval of saddle-saddle pairs in 3D \\julien(see Sec. 6 for\nfurther discussion). Despite the guaranteed correctness of their outputs,\nthese combinatorial\nmethods suffer from several limitations.\nFirst, they all use bridging,\nwhich introduces undesirable visual line\nartifacts in the output, where the bridged integral lines connect simplified\nfeatures and therefore often stand out (Sec. 2, orange).\nThis is particularly detrimental if the simplification is used as a pre-process to data segmentation.\nAs shown in Sec. 1c, this can result in the identification of large regions that include the canceled features through a thin connection.\nIn contrast, flattening-based methods completely remove undesired extrema by flattening their corresponding regions to the value of their paired saddle (Sec. 2, red).\nTherefore, flattening is better suited for data segmentation as simplified features are discarded from post-process segmentations (Sec. 1d).\nSecond, methods that manipulate filtrations  or Discrete Morse functions  require an extra post-processing step to convert their output into a piecewise linear scalar field (which is the traditional\nrepresentation for scalar data). In particular, this step involves the\nsubdivision of the triangulation (one new vertex per d𝑑d-simplex,\nwith d≥1𝑑1d\\geq 1). This can increase the size of the triangulation \\julienup to\nan order of magnitude, which may not be acceptable in certain applications.\nThird,\nthese approaches focus on the special case where the critical points to\ncancel are identified according to topological persistence.\nAs discussed previously, many applications come with their own importance measures.\nTo address this, Tierny and Pascucci  introduced a\nflattening-based approach, directly producing a piecewise linear scalar field on\nits output, and which supports the cancellation of an arbitrary selection of\nextrema.\nHowever,\n\\jonasRevisiontheir technique follows a white-list approach that\nremoves undesired extrema by globally constraining the sub- and superlevel set\ncomponents of the desired extrema.\nThis results in an intrinsically sequential algorithm, processing the data globally.\nIn contrast, LTS follows a black-list approach by only simplifying the regions that correspond to undesired extrema.\nMoreover, the\nLTS approach can be efficiently parallelized, which results in a\nsignificant performance gain that enables interactive topological\nsimplification."
