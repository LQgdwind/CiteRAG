    "introduction": "Rumours on social media are an increasingly critical issue, threatening\nsocieties at a global scale. They fuel misinformation campaigns, reduce the\ncredibility of news outlets, and potentially affect the opinions and, hence,\nactions of large parts of a society. The mechanisms for content sharing and\nuser engagement that form the basis of most social media platforms foster the\npropagation, amplification, and reinforcement of rumours in graph-based\npropagation structures¬†  .\nFig.¬†1 illustrates such a propagation structure for a rumour\nthat emerged about the Las Vegas shooting in 2017, which attracted millions of\nengagements on Twitter and news websites. With rumours emerging as a worldwide phenomenon,\nvarious techniques for their detection have been\nproposed¬†  .\nHowever, existing techniques focus on identifying what entities are\npart of a rumour structure, but provide little support for explaining the\nobtained results¬†. Especially the increasing\npopularity of methods for rumour detection based on deep learning, which\nexploit latent features, calls for explanations on why certain entities\nhave been classified as a rumour.\nSuch explanations are important for various reasons:\n(1) they enable an evaluation of the detected rumours and, hence, serve to\nassess the accuracy of rumour detection techniques; (2) they outline\nopportunities for improving the models adopted by the detection techniques; and\n(3) they enable users to devise and implement countermeasures that slow down\nand prevent the spread of rumours in the future.\n Explanations of rumours may be based on different paradigms.\nSince rumours are shared by humans, it is difficult to extract\ndiscrete rules to serve as explanations, though¬†.\nFeature-based\nexplanations, in turn, cannot capture the graph-based propagation structures of\nrumours¬†[ref]8. Also, counter-factual approaches are not suited\nto understand why entities are classified as being part of a\nrumour, due to their focus on features that may change the\nresult¬†.\nAs such, explanations shall be based on a set of related examples, which\nenable users to generalize their properties¬†0. For a\nrumour represented as a graph, the explanation is then given in terms of\nrelated subgraphs of rumours detected in the past. However, existing example-based explanation methods are still limited by easily overlooked assumptions. First, it is often assumed that the underlying model is stable over time. In practice, ML models are routinely retrained to react to changes in the overall environment and to changes in users‚Äô features. Explanations are often generated by a model-specific approach to identify the decision boundary of a specific model¬†1; and thus, become obsolete quickly when the model changes. Second, it is often assumed that there is no constraint on model access and complexity. Most of existing works generate synthetic data samples and calling the model evaluation on these samples repeatedly to identify the decision boundary to find most similar ones to the original input. However, the model is not always available for such evaluation calls (e.g. software and hardware requirements) and can be very costly in practice (e.g. some models might take minutes, if not hours, to complete a prediction)¬†2. To tackle these issues, we follow a model-agnostic approach to generate examples that are applicable to different types of models. In particular our approach works generally well with various problems and domains and is free from model access requirements. The performance of existing model-specific approaches are not generalized to other settings and even change considerably with a small of change of experimental setups¬†2. Moreover, our approach is not limited to a single example as in many previous works¬†, but include diverse examples to increase the likelihood of returning at least one option that matches the user‚Äôs true interest. Especially, our approach is free of model bias, which can still happen in many modern ML models¬†3 4. A realization of example-based explanations for rumour detection\nfaces diverse challenges. First, social media platforms are highly dynamic.\nThe characteristics\nof rumours evolve over time, hence explanations are instance-specific.\nSecond, rumours on social media materialize along\nmultiple modalities, making traditional textual analysis\ninsufficient¬†. For example, a rumour may be characterized\nby the relations between users and their interactions, not only by some textual\ncontent.\nThird,\nthe representation of rumours as graphs induces computational challenges. It is intractable to query the respective graph structures\ndirectly¬†5. In this paper, we address the above challenges and derive explanations for\nrumours with a query-by-example approach. Given a rumour graph,\nit extracts the kùëòk subgraphs of past rumours that are most useful to explain\nthe rumour, thereby achieving instance-specific explanations. By adopting a\nmodel based on\nfeature-annotated graphs, diverse modalities can be incorporated.\nMoreover, we\npresent a novel graph representation\nlearning technique, which enables us to derive explanations efficiently in a\nstreaming setting. More specifically, our contributions can be summarised as\nfollows: We define the problem of example-based explanation for rumour\ndetection. This is the first formulation of explanations for dynamic,\ngraph-based rumours. We provide a framework to address the explanation problem.\nGiven a rumour, we show how to score the utility of\nsubgraphs of past rumours and select the most useful ones.\n We design a graph representation learning technique to enable an\nefficient computation of explanations.\n We outline how the efficiency and robustness can be\nincreased by indexing and caching schemes. We propose an adaptation mechanism to concept drifts, i.e. when new rumour patterns emerge and are different from past rumour examples. We further report on evaluation experiments with synthetic and\nreal-world data. We show that our approach delivers meaningful\nexplanations for various rumour propagation behaviours. Compared to baseline\ntechniques, selection of explanations with our approach is 4√ó4\\times faster,\nwhile the runtime for graph similarity scoring improves by up to four orders of\nmagnitude. Our approach also accumulates more than 16√ó16\\times higher utility of\nexplanations when a large number of rumours are detected and streamed into the\nsystem. In the remainder, ¬ß¬†2 summarizes related work, before\n¬ß¬†3 introduces a graph-based model for our work.\nThe problem of example-based explanations for rumour detection and our general\napproach for it are introduced in ¬ß¬†4.\nWe first clarify the utility scoring and selection of subgraphs in\n¬ß¬†5, before realizing these steps based on graph\nembeddings in ¬ß¬†6 and presenting further\noptimizations in ¬ß¬†7. We report on experiment results in\n¬ß¬†8, before we conclude in ¬ß¬†9."
