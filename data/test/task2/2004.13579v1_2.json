    "kg embeddings evaluated by link prediction": "We divide existing KG embedding models evaluated by link prediction into three categories, i.e., translational, bilinear and neural models. TransE [ref]2 introduces the translational KG embeddings. It interprets relations as translation vectors operating on entity embeddings. Given a relational triple (h,r,t)ℎ𝑟𝑡(h,r,t), TransE defines the following energy function to measure the error of relation translation: fTransE​(h,r,t)=‖𝐡+𝐫−𝐭‖subscript𝑓TransEℎ𝑟𝑡norm𝐡𝐫𝐭f_{\\text{\\scriptsize TransE}}(h,r,t)=||\\mathbf{h}+\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{t}||, where ||⋅||||\\cdot|| denotes either the L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} or L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} vector norm. To resolve the issues of TransE on modeling complex relations, some improved translational models have been put forward, including TransH , TransR [ref]17 and TransD . Their key idea is to let entities have relation-specific embeddings by transformations operating on entity embeddings, such as the hyperplane projection in TransH and the space projection in TransR and TransD. We argue that such transformations introduce ambiguity to entity embeddings as they separate the original entity embedding into many dispersive relation-specific representations. For example, for each relation r𝑟r, entity hℎh would hold a representation 𝐡rsubscript𝐡𝑟\\mathbf{h}_{r}. These dispersive representations compromise the semantic integrity in KGs as each relation is modeled separately in the relation-specific hyperplane or space. The general entity embeddings 𝐡𝐡\\mathbf{h} and 𝐭𝐭\\mathbf{t} are not explicitly translated by relation vectors. Although our model can also be viewed as a kind of translational KG embedding, we introduce the edge-centric model that contextualizes relations with edge embeddings. Besides, there are some bilinear models that exploit similarity-based functions to compute the energy of relational triples. DistMult [ref]34 and ComplEx  use the bilinear Hadamard product to compute energy. HolE  substitutes the Hadamard product with circular correlation. Analogy  imposes analogical properties on embeddings. SimplE  proposes an enhancement of Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition to compute energy. CrossE  exploits to simulate the crossover interactions between entities and relations. RotatE  defines each relation as a rotation from the head entity to the tail in the complex-valued embedding space. Recently, there are also some neural embedding models including ProjE , ConvE , R-GCN  and ConvKB . These bilinear and neural models achieve superior results on link prediction at the cost of much higher model complexity. Besides, many of these embedding models also have the identified shortcomings, such as HolE and ProjE."
