    "other related work": "The parametrization using Œ±ùõº\\alpha-decisiveness provides an interesting restriction on the underlying metric space, and the special case of Œ±=0ùõº0\\alpha=0 captures settings where the sets of voters and candidates coincide, i.e., V=Cùëâùê∂V=C. This is known as peer selection, which involves a set of individuals voting over themselves. Typically, peer selection is studied under binary votes with a focus on strategic manipulation¬†, whereas our focus is on determining the desired selection rule (disregarding any manipulations) under ranked votes. The case where V=Cùëâùê∂V=C is also widely studied in theoretical computer science under the name of the metric 1-median problem: given a finite metric space (‚Ñ≥,d)‚Ñ≥ùëë(\\mathcal{M},d), find a point in ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} with the least total distance to all points in ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} (think V=C=‚Ñ≥ùëâùê∂‚Ñ≥V=C=\\mathcal{M}). Given all distances, the problem can be solved trivially in O‚Äã(|‚Ñ≥|2)ùëÇsuperscript‚Ñ≥2O(|\\mathcal{M}|^{2}) time, and a (1+œµ)1italic-œµ(1+\\epsilon)-approximation can be computed in O‚Äã(|‚Ñ≥|/œµ2)ùëÇ‚Ñ≥superscriptitalic-œµ2O(|\\mathcal{M}|/\\epsilon^{2}) time through Monte-Carlo search¬† . A different line of inquiry limits the number of pairwise distances the algorithm can query¬† 9 ; like in our metric distortion problem, the goal is to find the best approximation given limited information. Prior work in voting has also considered imposing other well-motivated restrictions on the preferences of the voters, e.g., by considering Euclidean metrics¬†8 , as well as metrics inducing single-peaked¬†3 or single-crossing¬†0  preferences. An alternative way of introducing more structure to the voter preferences is to assume the candidates are representative of the voters, i.e., drawn i.i.d.¬†from the pool of voters¬† . Note that in this case, each candidate is co-located with some voter, which is reminiscent of the special case Œ±=0ùõº0\\alpha=0 discussed above. Pierczynski and Skowron 5 extend the idea of distortion to approval-based preferences, while Borodin et¬†al.  and Filos-Ratsikas et¬†al.  extend it to complex voting paradigms such as district elections and primaries. On the other end, prior work has also studied distortion in less constrained settings, e.g., ones that are not even bound by metric constraints¬†6  . Distortion minimization, at its core, is the simple idea of designing approximation algorithms that have access only to ordinal information about underlying cardinal values. One can therefore leverage the distortion framework to study a diverse set of problems or objectives. As an alternative objective, Fain et¬†al.  focus on minimizing squared distortion of randomized rules, which is a notion that helps bound both the expectation and the variance of the approximation ratio of a rule at the same time. Goel et¬†al.   optimize the fairness ratio, which is a notion that is closely related to and always at least the distortion (in Appendix¬†D, we show that a simple modification of our distortion analysis can also be used to achieve a bound on the fairness ratio of our deterministic rule). The distortion framework has also already been used to study a variety of different problems: Anshelevich and Sekar  , Abramowitz and Anshelevich , and Anshelevich and Zhu   design novel algorithms for problems such as matching, clustering, and facility location using only ordinal information. For the case of matching, recent work by Abebe et¬†al.  also evaluated ordinal mechanisms compared to cardinal ones in strategic settings aiming to design truthful mechanisms. Recent work has also considered moving beyond the cardinal versus ordinal comparison, aiming to get a more refined understanding of the value of information in different settings. Chen et¬†al. 2, Fain et¬†al. , Gross et¬†al.  are interested in rules that elicit even less information from the voters than their full ranked preferences. On the contrary, Abramowitz et¬†al.  consider rules that have access to more information than just the ranked preferences, specifically the ratio of distances of each voter to every pair of candidates. Extending this idea, Kempe 8, Mandal et¬†al. 0, Mandal et¬†al. 1, and Amanatidis et¬†al.  study the explicit tradeoff between communication requirements and distortion of voting rules.\nMore broadly, the quantitative evaluation of social choice rules using distortion, arguably a contribution of computer science to voting theory¬†6 , is a recent approach, and stands in stark contrast to centuries-long study of social choice rules through an axiomatic approach¬†5."
