    "preface: history and matrix products": "The study of probabilistic finite automata was initiated by\nMichael Rabin in 1963 .\nWhile this was an active research area in the 1960’s,\nPFAs are less known today.\nThe first proof that\nPFA Emptiness is undecidable is\ndue to Masakazu\nNasu and Namio\nHonda from 1969\n[13, Theorem 21, p. 270].\nIt\nproceeds through a series of lemmas that involve tricky constructions,\nshowing\nthat more and more classes of languages, including certain types of context-free languages, can be\nrecognized by a PFA.\nEventually,\nthe undecidability of the PFA Emptiness Problem is derived from\nPost’s Correspondence Problem (PCP, see Section 5.2).\nThe proof is reproduced in the final part of a monograph\nby Azaria Paz from 1971\n[18, Theorem 6.17 in Section IIIB, p. 190].\nThe presentation is\nquite close to the original, but very much condensed (and it never\nmentions the PCP by name!).\nI suppose, as the result was still recent when the book was written, it was the culmination point of the treatment. It appears as part of the last\ntheorem of the book, before a brief final chapter on applications and generalizations.\nThe result has often been\nerroneously attributed to Paz, although Paz gave credit\nto Nasu and Honda\n(not very specifically, however)\nin the closing remarks of the chapter\n[18, Section IIIB.7, Bibliographical notes, p. 193].\nA simpler version of\nthis proof appears in the\ntextbook of\nVolker Claus from 1971 [4, Satz 28, p. 157]\nin German. An independent proof was sketched by Anne Condon and Richard Lipton in\n1989 . It arose as an auxiliary result for their\ninvestigation of space-bounded interactive proofs. Condon and Lipton\nbased their reduction on the undecidability of the Halting Problem for 2-Counter\nMachines (2CM),\nsee Section 4 below. As the formulation\n(1)\nshows,\nthe PFA Emptiness Problem is about products of matrices\nthat can be taken from a given set ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}. There are other\nproblems\nof this type, whose\nundecidability comes down to PFA Emptiness: For example,\nthe joint spectral radius of a set\nℳℳ\\mathcal{M} of d×d𝑑𝑑d\\times d matrices is where ∥⋅∥\\|\\cdot\\| denotes an arbitrary norm.\nIn 2000,\nBlondel and Tsitsiklis  proved,\nbased on the PFA Emptiness Problem,\nthat it is\nundecidable\nwhether the\njoint spectral radius of a finite set of rational matrices exceeds 1. This has recently been generalized in the analysis of the growth rate of\nbilinear systems, see\nMatthieu Rosenfeld 0\nand\nVuong Bui\n . The study of bilinear systems was initiated for a special case\nof such a system in\nRote 2 in the context of a combinatorial\ncounting problem.\nCorresponding decidability questions are discussed in\nRosenfeld 1\nand\nBui [3, Chapter 6].\nThese connections were my motivation for\nstarting the investigations about the PFA Emptiness Problem. In fact,\nTheorem 2a,\nwhich strengthens the\nundecidability result of\nPFA Emptiness to positive transition matrices,\ncan be used to\nresolve a conjecture of\nBui [3, Conjecture 6.7], by\nadapting the reduction of\nBlondel and Tsitsiklis :\nAlready for\ntwo positive matrices, it is undecidable to check\nif their joint spectral radius is larger than 111. In 2000,\nBlondel and Tsitsiklis  could arguably complain that\na complete proof that\nPFA Emptiness is undecidable cannot be found in its\nentirety in the published literature.\nSince then, Condon and Lipton’s proof\nhas been published in sufficient detail in other papers, for example by\nMadani, Hanks, and Condon\n[10, Sec. 3.1 and Appendix A] in 2003.\nMoreover, in the publication list on Anne Condon’s homepage,\nthe entry for the Condon–Lipton conference paper  from 1989\nlinks to a\n22-page manuscript, dated November 29, 2005111https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~condon/papers/condon-lipton89.pdf,\naccessed 2024-05-01..\nAccording to the metadata, the file was generated on that date by\nthe dvips program from a file called\n“journalsub.dvi”.\nThis manuscript also gives the proof in detail.\nCondon and Lipton’s proof, which is based on ideas of Freivalds,\nis conceptually simple and illuminating.\nThe current article originated from lecture notes about this proof.\n Meanwhile, I struggled with\nNasu and Honda’s article and tried to penetrate through its rendition in Paz\n8,\nwhich proceeds through a cascade of definitions and lemmas that\nstretch\nover the whole book.\nWhen I had already acquired a rough understanding of some crucial ideas,\nI was lucky to find the undecidability proof in the\ntextbook of\nClaus [4, Satz 28, p. 157],\nwhich is considerably simplified.\nThe result in\n is weaker, because the number of\ninput symbols is the number k𝑘k of string pairs of the PCP, whereas\nNasu and Honda establish undecidability already for an input alphabet\nof size 2.\nIt is, however, easy to\nreduce the input alphabet, see Lemma 7.6.\n(Nasu and Honda’s technique for achieving this reduction is\nconsiderably more involved, see\nSection 10.3 and\nAppendix A.) In this note, I try to present the best parts of both proofs in a\nself-contained way.\nI use slightly\ndifferent terminology, and\nsome details vary from constructions found elsewhere. I have preferred concrete formulations with\nparticular values of the parameters,\nillustrating them with examples. Generalizations\nto arbitrary parameters are treated as an afterthought.\nI have made an effort to streamline the proofs.\nIn particular, the complete Nasu–Honda–Claus proof leading\nto the main undecidability result\nof Proposition 2 takes only 3 pages\n(Section 5, pp. 5.1–2), and I encourage the reader to jump\ndirectly to this section.\nIn later parts, I will incrementally introduce new\nideas that decrease the number of states or deal with variants of\nthe problem, and the treatment\nbecomes more technical.\nFor reference, I review the original Nasu–Honda proof in\nAppendix A. The two proofs\nuse different ideas, and they\nhave different merits:\nCondon and Lipton’s proof leads to an arbitrarily large gap between\naccepting and rejecting probabilities\n(Theorem 4.3.1\nand Section 4.3.3)\nand it is easy to restrict the input alphabet to 2 symbols\n(Theorem 2).\nWhile the constructions in\nCondon and Lipton’s proof use\na high-level description of a PFA\nas a randomized algorithm,\nthe proof of Nasu and Honda encourages to work with the transition matrices directly,\nand consequently, allows a finer control over the number of states.\nMoreover, by looking at the reductions in detail, one can even show undecidability of the\nEmptiness Problem for a fixed PFA with 11 states and an input\nalphabet of size 53, where the only variable input is the starting distribution\n(Theorem 1b). This and similar sharpenings of the undecidability statement are the contributions of this paper in terms of new results,\nand we hope they might find other applications.\nA variation of the problem allows as few as 9 states\n(Theorem 2a). The distinction between the two proof approaches is highlighted for\na particular example, the language\n{ai​bi​#∣i≥0}conditional-setsuperscripta𝑖superscriptb𝑖#𝑖0\\{\\,\\texttt{a}^{i}\\texttt{b}^{i}\\texttt{\\#}\\mid i\\geq 0\\,\\},\nin Section 9.1."
