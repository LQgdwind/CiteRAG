    "expanding posets and the hd-level-set decomposition": "Dikstein, Dinur, Filmus, and Harsha [ref]3 observed that one can use the averaging operators to define a natural extension of spectral expansion to graded posets. Their definition is inspired by the fact that γ𝛾\\gamma-spectral expansion on a standard graph G𝐺G can be restated as a bound on the spectral norm of the adjacency matrix minus its stationary operator: Informally, DDFH’s definition can be thought of as stating that this relation holds for every level of a higher dimensional poset. Let (X,Π)𝑋Π(X,\\Pi) be a measured poset, δ∈ d−1𝛿superscript01𝑑1\\delta\\in ^{d-1}, and γ<1𝛾1\\gamma<1. X𝑋X is an (δ,γ)𝛿𝛾(\\delta,\\gamma)-eposet if for all 1≤i≤d−11𝑖𝑑11\\leq i\\leq d-1: . We note that for a broad range of posets, this definition is actually equivalent (up to constants) to local-spectral expansion, a popular notion of high dimensional expansion introduced by Dinur and Kaufman 8. This was originally proved for simplicial complexes by DDFH [ref]3, and later extended to a more general class of posets by Kaufman and Tessler [ref]32. It is also worth noting that when γ=0𝛾0\\gamma=0, posets satisfying the guarantee in Definition 2.6 are known as sequentially differential, and were actually introduced much earlier by Stanley  in the late 80s. Much of our analysis in this work will be based off of an elegant approximate Fourier decomposition for eposets introduced by DDFH [ref]3. Let (X,Π)𝑋Π(X,\\Pi) be a d𝑑d-dimensional (δ,γ)𝛿𝛾(\\delta,\\gamma)-eposet with γ𝛾\\gamma sufficiently small. For all 0≤k≤d0𝑘𝑑0\\leq k\\leq d, let Then: In other words, every f∈Ck𝑓subscript𝐶𝑘f\\in C_{k} has a unique decomposition f=f0+…+fk𝑓subscript𝑓0…subscript𝑓𝑘f=f_{0}+\\ldots+f_{k} such that fi=Uik​gisubscript𝑓𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑈𝑘𝑖subscript𝑔𝑖f_{i}=U^{k}_{i}g_{i} for gi∈Ker​(Di)subscript𝑔𝑖Kersubscript𝐷𝑖g_{i}\\in\\text{Ker}(D_{i}). It is well known that the HD-Level-Set Decomposition is approximately an eigenbasis for HD-walks on simplicial complex [ref]3 4 5. We show this statement extends to all eposets in Section 4 (extending DDFH’s similar analysis of the upper walk Nk1superscriptsubscript𝑁𝑘1N_{k}^{1}). Finally, before moving on, we will assume for simplicity throughout this work an additional property of eposets we called (approximate) non-laziness. Let (X,Π)𝑋Π(X,\\Pi) be a d𝑑d-dimensional measured poset. We call (X,Π)𝑋Π(X,\\Pi) β𝛽\\beta-non-lazy if for all 1≤i≤d1𝑖𝑑1\\leq i\\leq d, the laziness of the lower walk satisfies: Another way to think about this condition is that no element in the poset carries too much weight, even upon conditioning. All of our results hold for general eposets,131313The one exception is the lower bound of Theorem 1.8. but their form is significantly more interpretable when the poset is additionally non-lazy. In fact, most γ𝛾\\gamma-eposets of interest are O​(γ)𝑂𝛾O(\\gamma)-non-lazy. It is easy to see for instance that any “γ𝛾\\gamma-local-spectral” expander satisfies this condition, an equivalent notion of expansion to γ𝛾\\gamma-eposets under suitable regularity conditions [ref]32. We discuss this further in Appendix A."
