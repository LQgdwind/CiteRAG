    "the baseline fsod model": "As shown in Fig. 2, we mainly follow Fan et al.’s work [ref]3 to build our baseline FSOD model, which adopts a siamese Faster R-CNN (with ResNet [ref]12) with two branches. In one branch, a query image Iqsubscript𝐼𝑞I_{q} is fed into the feature extraction network to extract its feature r​(Iq)𝑟subscript𝐼𝑞r(I_{q}) (output of r​e​s​4𝑟𝑒𝑠4res4 block) for the detection head. Similarly, the other branch extracts the feature r​(Is)𝑟subscript𝐼𝑠r(I_{s}) given an input support image Issubscript𝐼𝑠I_{s}. Then the Attention-RPN [ref]3 is used to produce N𝑁N (N=100𝑁100N=100 by default following [ref]3) class-specific proposals Pc={{pic}i=1N,pic∈U}subscript𝑃𝑐superscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑐𝑖1𝑁superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑐𝑈P_{c}=\\{\\{p_{i}^{c}\\}_{i=1}^{N},p_{i}^{c}\\in U\\} for the novel class c∈Cn​o​v​e​l𝑐subscript𝐶𝑛𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑙c\\in C_{novel}. After that, we use the r​e​s​5𝑟𝑒𝑠5res5 block and RoIPooling [ref]6 to extract the feature f(pic)∈ℝH×W×C(H=W=7,C=2048)f(p_{i}^{c})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H\\times W\\times C}(H=W=7,C=2048) for proposal picsuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑐p_{i}^{c} from the query image feature r​(Iq)𝑟subscript𝐼𝑞r(I_{q}).\nWe apply the same layers to r​(Is)𝑟subscript𝐼𝑠r(I_{s}), and take the average feature of all support images belonging to the novel class c𝑐c as the class prototype f​(c)𝑓𝑐f(c). After that, a multi-relation network [ref]3 is used to calculate similarity score between the proposal feature and the class prototype, and then produce the final detection results for class c𝑐c following . The above process will be applied to each novel class independently. The reason we use [ref]3 as our baseline model is as follows. Firstly, the whole framework is simple and elegant, and is a natural extension of the original Faster R-CNN to the few-shot setting. Secondly, as shown in the Section 6.3, it has achieved SOTA accuracy in major FSOD benchmarks. Although [ref]3 has been demonstrated to be a promising FSOD model, there are three potential limits as discussed in the Section 1, and the primary cause is the separate classification of each proposal and class pair. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel FSOD model with heterogeneous GCNs in the following Section."
