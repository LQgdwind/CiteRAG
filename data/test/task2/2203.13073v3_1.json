    "introduction": "For a 0,1010,1 matrix M𝑀M of dimensions n×m𝑛𝑚n\\times m, consider the following three notions of rank. The (standard) rank of M𝑀M over ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}, denoted by rankℝ(M)subscriptrankℝ𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{R}}(M), is the minimal k𝑘k for which there exist real matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B of dimensions n×k𝑛𝑘n\\times k and k×m𝑘𝑚k\\times m respectively, such that M=A⋅B𝑀⋅𝐴𝐵M=A\\cdot B where the operations are over ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}. The binary rank of M𝑀M, denoted by rankbin(M)subscriptrankbin𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(M), is the minimal k𝑘k for which there exist 0,1010,1 matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B of dimensions n×k𝑛𝑘n\\times k and k×m𝑘𝑚k\\times m respectively, such that M=A⋅B𝑀⋅𝐴𝐵M=A\\cdot B where the operations are over ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}. Equivalently, rankbin(M)subscriptrankbin𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(M) is the smallest number of monochromatic combinatorial rectangles111A (combinatorial) rectangle in a matrix M𝑀M is a set P×Q𝑃𝑄P\\times Q, where P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q are sets of rows and columns in M𝑀M respectively. The rectangle is said to be monochromatic if the entries of the corresponding submatrix of M𝑀M are all equal. in a partition of the ones in M𝑀M. The Boolean rank of M𝑀M, denoted by rank𝔹(M)subscriptrank𝔹𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(M), is the minimal k𝑘k for which there exist 0,1010,1 matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B of dimensions n×k𝑛𝑘n\\times k and k×m𝑘𝑚k\\times m respectively, such that M=A⋅B𝑀⋅𝐴𝐵M=A\\cdot B where the operations are under Boolean arithmetic (namely, 0+x=x+0=x0𝑥𝑥0𝑥0+x=x+0=x, 1+1=1⋅1=111⋅1111+1=1\\cdot 1=1, and x⋅0=0⋅x=0⋅𝑥0⋅0𝑥0x\\cdot 0=0\\cdot x=0). Equivalently, rank𝔹(M)subscriptrank𝔹𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(M) is the smallest number of monochromatic combinatorial rectangles in a cover of the ones in M𝑀M. Note that the binary rank and the Boolean rank are sometimes referred to in the literature as the 111-partition number and the 111-cover number respectively.\nNote further that every 0,1010,1 matrix M𝑀M satisfies rankbin(M)≥rankℝ(M)subscriptrankbin𝑀subscriptrankℝ𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(M)\\geq{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{R}}(M) and rankbin(M)≥rank𝔹(M)subscriptrankbin𝑀subscriptrank𝔹𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(M)\\geq{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(M). The above notions of rank play a central role in the area of communication complexity, introduced in 1979 by Yao .\nIn the communication problem associated with a 0,1010,1 matrix M𝑀M of dimensions n×m𝑛𝑚n\\times m, one player holds a row index i∈[n]𝑖delimited-[]𝑛i\\in[n] and another player holds a column index j∈[m]𝑗delimited-[]𝑚j\\in[m], and their goal is to decide whether Mi,j=1subscript𝑀𝑖𝑗1M_{i,j}=1 while minimizing the worst-case number of communicated bits.\nFor the deterministic setting, the well-known log-rank conjecture of Lovász and Saks [ref]24 suggests that the communication complexity of the problem is polynomially related to log2​rankℝ(M)subscript2subscriptrankℝ𝑀\\log_{2}{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{R}}(M) (see, e.g., ).\nFor the non-deterministic setting, it is not difficult to see that the minimum number of bits that should be communicated is precisely ⌈log2​rank𝔹(M)⌉subscript2subscriptrank𝔹𝑀\\lceil\\log_{2}{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(M)\\rceil.\nFor the unambiguous non-deterministic setting, where each input is required to have at most one accepting computation, the minimum number of bits that should be communicated is precisely ⌈log2​rankbin(M)⌉subscript2subscriptrankbin𝑀\\lceil\\log_{2}{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(M)\\rceil. For a 0,1010,1 matrix M𝑀M, let M¯¯𝑀\\overline{M} denote the complement matrix obtained from M𝑀M by replacing the ones by zeros and the zeros by ones.\nA result of Yannakakis  implies that every 0,1010,1 matrix M𝑀M with rankbin(M)=ksubscriptrankbin𝑀𝑘{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(M)=k satisfies The challenge of determining the largest possible value of rank𝔹(M¯)subscriptrank𝔹¯𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(\\overline{M}) for a 0,1010,1 matrix M𝑀M with rankbin(M)=ksubscriptrankbin𝑀𝑘{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(M)=k has attracted intensive attention in the literature, mostly with the equivalent formulation of the clique vs. independent set problem introduced in  (see [20, Chapter 4.4]).\nThe first non-trivial bound was given by Huang and Sudakov  who provided, building on a construction of Razborov , a family of such matrices M𝑀M satisfying rank𝔹(M¯)≥Ω​(k6/5)subscriptrank𝔹¯𝑀Ωsuperscript𝑘65{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(\\overline{M})\\geq\\Omega(k^{6/5}) (see  for extended constructions).\nThe constant 6/5656/5 in the exponent was improved to 3/2323/2 by Amano  and then to 222 by Shigeta and Amano .\nThe first super-polynomial separation was obtained by Göös 3, who provided a family of such matrices M𝑀M satisfying rank𝔹(M¯)≥kΩ​(log0.128⁡k)subscriptrank𝔹¯𝑀superscript𝑘Ωsuperscript0.128𝑘{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(\\overline{M})\\geq k^{\\Omega(\\log^{0.128}k)}. This was then improved in a work of Ben-David, Hatami, and Tal  to rank𝔹(M¯)≥kΩ​(log0.22⁡k)subscriptrank𝔹¯𝑀superscript𝑘Ωsuperscript0.22𝑘{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(\\overline{M})\\geq k^{\\Omega(\\log^{0.22}k)}. In a recent breakthrough, it was shown by Balodis, Ben-David, Göös, Jain, and Kothari [ref]2 that the bound can be further improved to rank𝔹(M¯)≥kΩ~​(log⁡k)subscriptrank𝔹¯𝑀superscript𝑘~Ω𝑘{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(\\overline{M})\\geq k^{\\widetilde{\\Omega}(\\log k)}, which matches the upper bound in (1) up to log⁡log⁡k𝑘\\log\\log k factors hidden in the Ω~~Ω\\widetilde{\\Omega} notation.\nNote that the result of [ref]2 strengthens an earlier result of Göös, Pitassi, and Watson 5, who provided a near optimal separation between the binary rank of a 0,1010,1 matrix and the deterministic communication complexity of the problem associated with it. Interestingly, the above problem is closely related to a graph-theoretic problem proposed by Alon, Saks, and Seymour in 1991 (see [ref]21).\nFor a graph G𝐺G, let χ​(G)𝜒𝐺\\chi(G) denote its chromatic number, and let bp(G)bp𝐺\\mathop{\\mathrm{bp}}(G) denote its biclique partition number, that is, the smallest number of edge-disjoint bicliques (i.e., complete bipartite graphs) needed for a partition of the edge set of G𝐺G.\nA classic result of Graham and Pollak 6 asserts that the complete graph Knsubscript𝐾𝑛K_{n} on n𝑛n vertices satisfies bp(Kn)=n−1bpsubscript𝐾𝑛𝑛1\\mathop{\\mathrm{bp}}(K_{n})=n-1. Inspired by this result, Alon, Saks, and Seymour conjectured that every graph G𝐺G satisfies bp(G)≥χ​(G)−1bp𝐺𝜒𝐺1\\mathop{\\mathrm{bp}}(G)\\geq\\chi(G)-1. The conjecture was disproved by Huang and Sudakov in , where it was shown that for infinitely many integers k𝑘k there exists a graph G𝐺G satisfying bp(G)=kbp𝐺𝑘\\mathop{\\mathrm{bp}}(G)=k and χ​(G)≥Ω​(k6/5)𝜒𝐺Ωsuperscript𝑘65\\chi(G)\\geq\\Omega(k^{6/5}). These graphs were used there to derive the aforementioned separation between rankbin(M)subscriptrankbin𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(M) and rank𝔹(M¯)subscriptrank𝔹¯𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(\\overline{M}) for 0,1010,1 matrices M𝑀M (see [19, Section 4]).\nIn a work of Bousquet, Lagoutte, and Thomassé , the two problems were shown to be essentially equivalent, allowing the authors of [ref]2 to derive, for infinitely many integers k𝑘k, the existence of a graph G𝐺G satisfying bp(G)=kbp𝐺𝑘\\mathop{\\mathrm{bp}}(G)=k and χ​(G)≥kΩ~​(log⁡k)𝜒𝐺superscript𝑘~Ω𝑘\\chi(G)\\geq k^{\\widetilde{\\Omega}(\\log k)}.\nAs in the matrix setting, the gap is optimal up to log⁡log⁡k𝑘\\log\\log k factors in the exponent. A 0,1010,1 matrix M𝑀M is said to be d𝑑d-regular if every row and every column in M𝑀M has precisely d𝑑d ones.\nIn 1986, Brualdi, Manber, and Ross  proved that for every d𝑑d-regular 0,1010,1 matrix M𝑀M of dimensions n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n where 0<d<n0𝑑𝑛0<d<n, the rank of M𝑀M over the reals is equal to that of its complement, that is, rankℝ(M)=rankℝ(M¯)subscriptrankℝ𝑀subscriptrankℝ¯𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{R}}(M)={\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{R}}(\\overline{M}).\nFollowing their work, Pullman  asked in 1988 whether every such matrix M𝑀M satisfies rankbin(M)=rankbin(M¯)subscriptrankbin𝑀subscriptrankbin¯𝑀{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(M)={\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathrm{bin}}(\\overline{M}). In 1990, Hefner, Henson, Lundgren, and Maybee 8 conjectured that the answer to this question is negative (see [18, Conjecture 3.2]).\nThe question was asked again in 1995 in a survey by Monson, Pullman, and Rees  (see [26, Open problem 7.1]).222The question of  8  was originally formulated using the notion of non-negative integer rank, which coincides with the binary rank for 0,1010,1 matrices (see, e.g., [17, Lemma 2.1]).\nNote that for the Boolean rank, such a statement does not hold in general. For example, the 111-regular identity matrix Insubscript𝐼𝑛I_{n} satisfies rank𝔹(In)=nsubscriptrank𝔹subscript𝐼𝑛𝑛{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(I_{n})=n and yet rank𝔹(In¯)=(1+o​(1))⋅log2⁡nsubscriptrank𝔹¯subscript𝐼𝑛⋅1𝑜1subscript2𝑛{\\mathop{\\mathrm{rank}}}_{\\mathbb{B}}(\\overline{I_{n}})=(1+o(1))\\cdot\\log_{2}n (see 2)."
