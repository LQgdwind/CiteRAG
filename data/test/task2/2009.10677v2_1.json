    "background": "In a seminal paper, Goemans and Williamson  introduced the paradigm of obtaining an approximation algorithm for a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) by first solving a Semidefinite Programming (SDP) relaxation of the problem, and then rounding the solution. They used this paradigm to obtain an Œ±G‚ÄãW‚âà0.87856subscriptùõºùê∫ùëä0.87856\\alpha_{GW}\\approx 0.87856-approximation algorithm for MAX CUT and some approximation algorithms for MAX DI-CUT (maximum directed cut), MAX 2-SAT and MAX SAT. Khot et al.¬† showed that the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) of Khot  implies that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio of Œ±G‚ÄãW+Œµsubscriptùõºùê∫ùëäùúÄ\\alpha_{GW}+\\varepsilon for MAX CUT, for any Œµ>0ùúÄ0\\varepsilon>0, thus showing that the Goemans-Williamson MAX CUT algorithm is probably optimal. Improved approximation algorithms for MAX DI-CUT and MAX 2-SAT were obtained by Feige and Goemans , Matuura and Matsui , and then by Lewin et al.¬† who gave a 0.940160.940160.94016-approximation algorithm for MAX 2-SAT and a 0.874010.874010.87401-approximation algorithm for MAX DI-CUT. Austrin  showed that the MAX 2-SAT algorithm of Lewin et al.¬† is optimal, assuming the UGC. Austrin  showed that the MAX DI-CUT algorithm of Lewin et al.¬† is close to being optimal, again under the the UGC. MAX NAE-SAT and MAX SAT are natural extensions of the MAX CUT and MAX 2-SAT problems. An instance of MAX SAT is composed of a collection of clauses. Each clause is a set (or, equivalently, a disjunction) of literals, where each literal is a variable or its negation. The goal is to assign Boolean values (00 or¬†111) to the variables so as to maximize the number of clauses that contain a literal that evaluates to¬†111. In the MAX NAE-SAT problem the goal is to maximize the number of clauses that contain at least one literal that evaluates to 111 and at least one literal that evaluates to¬†00. In both MAX SAT and MAX NAE-SAT, clauses may be weighted. The approximability thresholds of MAX SAT and MAX NAE-SAT are not well understood, even under UGC. What makes them hard is that clauses are allowed to be of varying size. For an integer kùëòk we let MAX {k}ùëò\\{k\\}-SAT and MAX NAE-{k}ùëò\\{k\\}-SAT be the versions of MAX SAT and MAX NAE-SAT in which all clauses are of size exactly¬†kùëòk, and by MAX [k]delimited-[]ùëò[k]-SAT and MAX NAE-[k]delimited-[]ùëò[k]-SAT the versions in which clauses are of size at most kùëòk.\nNote that MAX NAE-{2}2\\{2\\}-SAT is a natural generalization of MAX CUT in which negations are allowed. The Goemans-Williamson algorithm also achieves a ratio of Œ±G‚ÄãWsubscriptùõºùê∫ùëä\\alpha_{GW} for MAX NAE-{2}2\\{2\\}-SAT. H√•stad 5, relying on the PCP theory developed by Arora et al.¬† , and others, proved that for every k‚â•3ùëò3k\\geq 3, obtaining an approximation ratio of (1‚àí12k)+Œµ11superscript2ùëòùúÄ(1-\\frac{1}{2^{k}})+\\varepsilon for MAX {k}ùëò\\{k\\}-SAT, for any Œµ>0ùúÄ0\\varepsilon>0, is NP-hard. Similarly, for every k‚â•4ùëò4k\\geq 4, obtaining a ratio of (1‚àí12k‚àí1)+Œµ11superscript2ùëò1ùúÄ(1-\\frac{1}{2^{k-1}})+\\varepsilon for MAX NAE-{k}ùëò\\{k\\}-SAT\nis also NP-hard. Intriguingly, these ratios are obtained, in expectation, by simply choosing a random assignment. Thus, as mentioned in the abstract, while it is known that an approximation ratio of at least 7878\\frac{7}{8} can be obtained for each individual clause size, for both MAX SAT and MAX NAE-SAT, it is not known whether an approximation ratio of 7878\\frac{7}{8} can be obtained for all clause sizes simultaneously (e.g., 31113 cites that the best known upper bound on the approximation ratio of MAX NAE-SAT is that of MAX CUT, ‚âà0.87856absent0.87856\\approx 0.87856, but a hardness of 7/8787/8 follows from the upper bound of 7/8787/8 for MAX NAE-{4}4\\{4\\}-SAT, which follows from H√•stad‚Äôs 7/8787/8‚Äôs hardness of MAX {3}3\\{3\\}-SAT¬†5.).(For MAX NAE-SAT we resolve this problem.) For MAX delimited-[]3-SAT (and MAX NAE-delimited-[]4-SAT), Karloff and Zwick  obtained a 7878\\frac{7}{8}-approximation algorithm whose computer assisted analysis appears in 6. A 7878\\frac{7}{8}-approximation algorithm is not known even for MAX {1,4}14\\{1,4\\}-SAT, i.e., when all clauses are either of size 111 or¬†444. (See Halperin and Zwick .) Avidor et al.¬†[ref]7, improving results of Andersson and Engebretsen , Asano and Williamson  and Zhang et al.¬†3, obtained a MAX SAT algorithm with a conjectured approximation ratio of 0.84340.84340.8434 and a MAX NAE-SAT algorithm with a conjectured approximation ratio of 0.82790.82790.8279. (We discuss below why most approximation ratios claimed for MAX SAT and MAX NAE-SAT are only conjectured.) For satisfiable instanced of MAX NAE-SAT, Zwick 5 gave an algorithm with a conjectured approximation ratio of 0.8630.8630.863. (We improve on this conjectured ratio, see below.) In a breakthrough result, Raghavendra 9 0 (see also Brown-Cohen and Raghavendra ), showed that under UGC, the best approximation ratio achievable for a maximum constraint satisfaction problem is essentially equal to the integrality ratio of a natural SDP relaxation of the problem. Furthermore, Raghavendra 9 0 shows that the optimal approximation ratio can be obtained using a rounding procedure selected from a specific family of rounding functions. (For more on finding almost optimal rounding procedures, see Raghavendra and Steurer 1.) Raghavendra‚Äôs result 9 0 does not solve the MAX SAT and MAX NAE-SAT problems, as it does not tell us what are the optimal approximation ratios achievable for these problems. It only tells us which SDP relaxations are sufficient to obtain the optimal results and that the optimal ratios are equal to the integrality ratios of these relaxations. This is certainly important and useful information, but it does not tell us what the integrality ratios are."
