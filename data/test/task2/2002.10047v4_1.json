    "related work": "Theory. A trivial algorithm can compute all k𝑘k-cliques\nin O​(nk)𝑂superscript𝑛𝑘O(n^{k}) work. Using degree-based thresholding enables\nclique counting in O​(mk/2)𝑂superscript𝑚𝑘2O(m^{k/2}) work, which is asymptotically\nfaster for sparse graphs. Chiba and Nishizeki give an\nalgorithm with improved complexity for sparse graphs,\nin which all k𝑘k-cliques can be found in O​(m​αk−2)𝑂𝑚superscript𝛼𝑘2O(m\\alpha^{k-2})\nwork , where α𝛼\\alpha is the arboricity of the graph. For arbitrary graphs, the fastest theoretical algorithm uses matrix\nmultiplication, and counts 3​l3𝑙3l cliques in O​(nl​ω)𝑂superscript𝑛𝑙𝜔O(n^{l\\omega}) time\nwhere ω𝜔\\omega is the matrix multiplication\nexponent . The k𝑘k-clique problem is a\ncanonical hard problem in the FPT literature, and is known to be\nW​[ref]1𝑊delimited-[]1W[ref]1-complete when parametrized by k𝑘k . We\nrefer the reader to , which surveys\nother theoretical algorithms for this problem. Recent work by Dhulipala et al.  studied k𝑘k-clique counting in the parallel batch-dynamic setting. One of their\nalgorithms calls our arb-count as a\nsubroutine. Practice. The special case of counting and listing\ntriangles (k=3𝑘3k=3) has received a huge amount of attention over the\npast two decades (e.g., 5   , among many\nothers). Finocchi et al.  present parallel k𝑘k-clique counting algorithms for MapReduce. Jain and Seshadri 7\nprovide algorithms for estimating k𝑘k-clique counts. The state-of-the-art\nk𝑘k-clique counting and listing algorithm is kClist by Danisch\net al. , which is based on the\nChiba-Nishizeki algorithm, but uses the k𝑘k-core\nordering (which is not parallel) to rank vertices.\nIt achieves O​(m​αk−2)𝑂𝑚superscript𝛼𝑘2O(m\\alpha^{k-2}) work, but\ndoes not have polylogarithmic span due to the ordering\nand only parallelizing one or two levels of recursion.\nConcurrent with our work, Li et al.  present an ordering heuristic for k𝑘k-clique counting based on graph coloring, which they show improves upon kClist in practice. It would be interesting in the future to study their heuristic applied to our algorithm. Additionally, many algorithms have been designed for finding 4-\nand 5-vertex subgraphs\n(e.g.,     )\nas well as estimating larger subgraph counts\n(e.g.,  ), and these algorithms can be\nused for counting exact or approximate k𝑘k-clique counting as a special case.\nWorst-case optimal join algorithms from the database\nliterature [ref]1    can also be used\nfor k𝑘k-clique listing and counting as a special case, and would require\nO​(mk/2)𝑂superscript𝑚𝑘2O(m^{k/2}) work. Very recently, Jain and Seshadri 8 present a sequential\nand a vertex parallel Pivoter algorithm for counting all cliques in a\ngraph.\nHowever, their algorithm cannot be used for\nk𝑘k-clique listing as they avoid processing all cliques, and requires much\nmore than O​(m​αk−2)𝑂𝑚superscript𝛼𝑘2O(m\\alpha^{k-2}) work in the worst case. Low Out-degree Orientations. A canonical technique in the\ngraph algorithms literature on clique counting, listing, and related\ntasks 0 8  is the\nuse of a low out-degree orientation. Matula and Beck  show that k𝑘k-core\ngives an O​(α)𝑂𝛼O(\\alpha) orientation.\nHowever, the problem of computing this ordering is\n𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{P}-complete , and thus unlikely to have\npolylogarithmic span. More recent work in the distributed and\nexternal-memory literature has shown that such orderings can be\nefficiently computed in these settings. Barenboim and Elkin give a\ndistributed algorithm that finds an O​(α)𝑂𝛼O(\\alpha)-orientation in O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) rounds . Goodrich and Pszona give a similar\nalgorithm for external-memory 5. Concurrent with our work,\nBesta et al.  present a parallel algorithm for generating\nan O​(α)𝑂𝛼O(\\alpha)-orientation in O​(m)𝑂𝑚O(m) work and O​(log2⁡n)𝑂superscript2𝑛O(\\log^{2}n) span,\nwhich they use for parallel graph coloring. Vertex Peeling and k𝑘k-clique Densest Subgraph. An\nimportant application of k𝑘k-clique counting is its use as a subroutine\nin computing generalizations of approximate densest subgraph.\nIn this paper, we study parallel algorithms for k𝑘k-clique densest subgraph, a\ngeneralization of the densest subgraph problem\nintroduced by Tsourakakis 3. Tsourakakis presents\na sequential 1/k1𝑘1/k-approximation algorithm based on iteratively\npeeling the vertex with minimum k𝑘k-clique-count, and a parallel\n1/(k​(1+ϵ))1𝑘1italic-ϵ1/(k(1+\\epsilon))-approximation algorithm based on a parallel\ndensest subgraph\nalgorithm of Bahmani et al. .\nSun et al. 2 give additional approximation algorithms that converge to produce\nthe exact solution over further iterations; these algorithms are more sophisticated and demonstrate\nthe tradeoff between running times and relative errors.\nRecently, Fang et al. 1 propose algorithms for finding\nthe largest (j,Ψ)𝑗Ψ(j,\\Psi)-core of a graph, or the largest subgraph\nsuch that all vertices have at least j𝑗j subgraphs ΨΨ\\Psi incident on\nthem.\nThey propose an algorithm for ΨΨ\\Psi being a k𝑘k-clique that peels vertices with larger clique counts first and show\nthat their algorithm gives a 1/k1𝑘1/k-approximation to the k𝑘k-clique densest subgraph."
