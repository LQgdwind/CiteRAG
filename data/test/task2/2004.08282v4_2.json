    "ruling sets": "Ruling sets have been introduced by Awerbuch et al. , where the authors showed how to construct (α,O​(α​log⁡n))𝛼𝑂𝛼𝑛(\\alpha,O(\\alpha\\log n))-ruling sets in O​(α​log⁡n)𝑂𝛼𝑛O(\\alpha\\log n) deterministic rounds in the LOCAL model. Since then, there have been several works in this direction both in the deterministic and randomized setting. As far as deterministic algorithms are concerned, Schneider, Elkin, and Wattenhofer showed how to get (2,β)2𝛽(2,\\beta)-ruling sets in O​(β​Δ2/β+log∗⁡n)𝑂𝛽superscriptΔ2𝛽superscript𝑛O(\\beta\\Delta^{2/\\beta}+\\log^{*}n) rounds in the LOCAL model . It is then easy to obtain an (α,(α−1)​β)𝛼𝛼1𝛽(\\alpha,(\\alpha-1)\\beta)-ruling set of a graph G𝐺G in the LOCAL model by just computing a (2,β)2𝛽(2,\\beta)-ruling set on the power graph Gα−1superscript𝐺𝛼1G^{\\alpha-1}. If randomness is allowed, Gfeller and Vicari showed how to compute a version of (1,O​(log⁡log⁡Δ))1𝑂Δ(1,O(\\log\\log\\Delta))-ruling sets where each node in the ruling set is allowed to have at most O​(log5⁡n)𝑂superscript5𝑛O(\\log^{5}n) neighbors also in the ruling set, in O​(log⁡log⁡Δ)𝑂ΔO(\\log\\log\\Delta) rounds 1, and by then applying the algorithm of  on the graph induced by selected nodes, we can obtain an algorithm for (2,log⁡log⁡n)2𝑛(2,\\log\\log n)-ruling sets running in O​(log⁡log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log\\log n) time.\nKothapalli and Pemmaraju showed how to compute (2,2)22(2,2)-ruling sets in O​(log⁡Δ(log⁡n)ε+(log⁡n)1/2+ε)𝑂Δsuperscript𝑛𝜀superscript𝑛12𝜀O\\left(\\frac{\\log\\Delta}{(\\log n)^{\\varepsilon}}+(\\log n)^{1/2+\\varepsilon}\\right) rounds, for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 . One year later, Bisht, Kothapalli, and Pemmaraju provided a sparsifying procedure that can be used, together with some MIS algorithm, to obtain (2,β)2𝛽(2,\\beta)-ruling sets (in a runtime that depends on the respective MIS algorithm) . For instance, by combining this sparsifying procedure with the MIS algorithm by Barenboim et al. , a (2,β)2𝛽(2,\\beta)-ruling set can be computed in O​(β​log1/(β−1/2)⁡Δ)+2O​(log⁡log⁡n)𝑂𝛽superscript1𝛽12Δsuperscript2𝑂𝑛O(\\beta\\log^{1/(\\beta-1/2)}\\Delta)+2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log\\log n})} rounds. By using the improved MIS algorithm by Ghaffari 2 instead, we obtain a runtime of O​(β​log1/β⁡Δ)+2O​(log⁡log⁡n)𝑂𝛽superscript1𝛽Δsuperscript2𝑂𝑛O(\\beta\\log^{1/\\beta}\\Delta)+2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log\\log n})} rounds, which can in turn be improved to O​(β​log1/β⁡Δ)+poly⁡(log⁡log⁡n)𝑂𝛽superscript1𝛽Δpoly𝑛O(\\beta\\log^{1/\\beta}\\Delta)+\\operatorname{poly}(\\log\\log n) rounds by making use of the poly⁡(log⁡n)poly𝑛\\operatorname{poly}(\\log n)-round network decomposition algorithm by Rozhoň and Ghaffari .\nRuling sets have been investigated also in the more restrictive CONGEST model (e.g., see 8  )."
