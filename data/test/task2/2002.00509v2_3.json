    "simulating dreams": "In order to simulate dreams, we first have to record photos 𝐏isubscript𝐏𝑖\\mathbf{P}_{i} when being awake and store them in a semantic network . Then, dreams will use that information 𝐏:𝐏i∈𝐏:𝐏subscript𝐏𝑖𝐏\\mathbf{P}:\\mathbf{P}_{i}\\in\\mathbf{P} to generate a sequence of images 𝐃i∈𝐃subscript𝐃𝑖𝐃\\mathbf{D}_{i}\\in\\mathbf{D}. We define a dream as a function d𝑑d that converts a subset of a sequence of images 𝒫∈𝐏𝒫𝐏\\mathcal{P}\\in\\mathbf{P} and a subset of a sequence of style images 𝒮∈𝐒𝒮𝐒\\mathcal{S}\\in\\mathbf{S} in a new set of images 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}, that is 𝒟=d​(𝒫,𝒮)𝒟𝑑𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{D}=d(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{S}). In order to generate this procedure, we propose two processes for this simulator: First, we classify images 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} into a semantic network R𝑅R. We assume that a previous categorized semantic network R𝑅R exists and that a robot has already learned to classify images 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} into that network R𝑅R. An implementation of this process can have ImageNet  as semantic network. ImageNet is a resource with more than 14.000.00014.000.00014.000.000 images 𝒟​(𝐗)𝒟𝐗\\mathcal{D}(\\mathbf{X}) and more than 21.00021.00021.000 categories 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y}. ImageNet uses the hierarchy of WordNet  to classify photos, having each category yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i} a semantic meaning and being organized as a graph G=V,E𝐺𝑉𝐸G={V,E} that can be traversed, where v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V is the node representing category yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i}. Convolutional neural networks [ref]39 or advanced neural models as Efficient Net L2 [ref]64 or ResNet  neural models can classify photos into ImageNet. Let N​N𝑁𝑁NN be the neural model that implements the robot, the robot will classify each input image P𝑃P to category yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i}, inserting it in the graph G𝐺G through the N​N𝑁𝑁NN trained on the ImageNet dataset 𝒟​(𝐗,𝐲)𝒟𝐗𝐲\\mathcal{D}(\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{y}), that is: yi=N​N​(P|𝒟​(𝐗,𝐲))subscript𝑦𝑖𝑁𝑁conditional𝑃𝒟𝐗𝐲y_{i}=NN(P|\\mathcal{D}(\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{y})). To feed images in the neural model N​N𝑁𝑁NN to be classified in the graph G𝐺G, we need a robot with an integrated camara to take the photos 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P} and define a period of being awake Tasubscript𝑇𝑎T_{a} and asleep Tssubscript𝑇𝑠T_{s}. These parameters can be configured differently for every robot. We suggest to save additional images 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} that will represent different styles seen like for example dark places or broad landscapes in a different semantic network Rssubscript𝑅𝑠R_{s}. Second, we need to define the dreaming state given by time Tssubscript𝑇𝑠T_{s}. We suggest to use a random walk  like the one performed in the Metropolis Hastings algorithm  to simulate movement into the semantic networks of images R𝑅R and styles Rssubscript𝑅𝑠R_{s} that are related by semantic distance ds​(yi,yj)subscript𝑑𝑠subscript𝑦𝑖subscript𝑦𝑗d_{s}(y_{i},y_{j}) in their graphs G,Gs𝐺subscript𝐺𝑠G,G_{s} given by the number of edges that connect each category. At each step, we select two images 𝐏i,𝐏issubscript𝐏𝑖superscriptsubscript𝐏𝑖𝑠\\mathbf{P}_{i},\\mathbf{P}_{i}^{s} and invoke Deep Style neural networks  to generate a new image with the selected photo and an style applied 𝐃i=D​Sn​n​(𝐏i,𝐏si)subscript𝐃𝑖𝐷subscript𝑆𝑛𝑛subscript𝐏𝑖superscriptsubscript𝐏𝑠𝑖\\mathbf{D}_{i}=DS_{nn}(\\mathbf{P}_{i},\\mathbf{P}_{s}^{i}). Models such as a Generative Adversarial Network  can be used. The robot will then attend the photo and save it. We can observe examples of generated photos using the Deep Dream Generator by this procedure in Figure 1. Initial categories yi​n​i​t,yi​n​i​tssubscript𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑠y_{init},y_{init}^{s} are chosen randomly. To select the new categories, we perform a random walk in the graph G𝐺G and Gssubscript𝐺𝑠G_{s} given by some uniform distribution with a lower llsubscript𝑙𝑙l_{l} and upper ulsubscript𝑢𝑙u_{l} limit, whose sampled value we will call step size ω𝜔\\omega. If we set those parameters to a high number, dreams will contain different concepts and viceversa. We repeat the mentioned process by performing an iteration of the random walk. We store each generated image 𝐃isubscript𝐃𝑖\\mathbf{D}_{i}. The sequence of recreated images 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} recreates the dream. After dreaming, the robot will be awake, iterating both processes."
