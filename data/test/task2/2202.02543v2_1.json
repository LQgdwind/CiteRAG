    "i introduction": "A3D point cloud is typically represented by a set of sparse 3D points, which is an essential type of geometric data structure . Point cloud has drawn increasing attention due to its wide range of applications , such as localization and navigation , animation, autonomous driving , augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR) . Learning discriminative and transferable point cloud feature representations is a crucial problem in the area of 3D shape understanding  , as it allows efficient training on downstream tasks such as 3D object detection and tracking, segmentation, object synthesis and reconstruction, classification, registration, and even using 3D data to validate 2D depth estimation. With the help of extensive supervised information, recent deep learning-based techniques   0 1 have achieved promising results in point cloud classification, detection, and segmentation 2. However, they all require intense manual labeling to provide the full supervised information. Annotating point clouds is challenging for several reasons: (1) Sparse, low resolution, and irregular spatial distribution of point cloud poses great challenges to annotation 3; (2) The large numbers of points that are contained in point clouds greatly increase the labeling costs and reduce efficiency 3. When there are no sufficient labels available, these models cannot learn proper visual feature representations for downstream 3D understanding tasks. Therefore, learning from unlabeled or partially labeled data to alleviate human labeling is an emerging research topic in 3D modeling. Along this line, unsupervised representation learning is an attractive alternative method to auto-extract features without human intervention 4. Several studies have tried to develop methods for unsupervised representation learning on point clouds. These approaches can roughly be categorized as either generative or discriminative 5. Most methods, such as self-reconstruction or auto-encoding 6, generative adversarial network (GAN) 7, and auto-regressive, fall into the first category. They mainly work by mapping an input point cloud into a global latent representation 8 9 or a latent distribution in the variational case 0 1 through an encoder and then attempt to reconstruct the input by a decoder. Generative models have proved to be effective in modeling the high-level and structural properties. However, many of these approaches usually assume that all 3D objects have the same pose in an given category 2. They are therefore sensitive to rotation and translation. Unlike generative approaches, discriminative models learn to predict or discriminate data augmentations. Such approaches preserve the input semantics and have recently been shown to yield rich latent representations for downstream tasks.\nAmong the discriminative models, contrastive methods 8 2 have shown remarkable results among the recent unsupervised approaches of point cloud representation learning. Contrastive methods further allow the creation of rotation invariant representations 3 via data augmentation and contrasting. The critical idea in contrastive learning is to predict a representation that is closer to the positive examples and farther from the negatives 4. However, to achieve a better performance, these algorithms require many negative samples to compare and heavily depend on the choice of the negative ones and their pairings with the positives 5 5. Usually, such an unsupervised mechanism is computationally expensive, and needs a careful treatment of the negative pairs by either depending on large batch sizes, memory banks, or customized mining strategies to retrieve the negative pairs 5. Furthermore, most of these unsupervised learning methods adopt a global pooling layer to generate a global embedding, which discounts the spatial structures and the local information to some degree 8 1. Thus, extracting high-level semantic information and reducing the dependence on the negative samples of contrastive learning is an open problem in 3D point cloud data analysis. Therefore, this paper proposes an unsupervised representation learning method of 3D point clouds to mitigate these issues. Our framework consists of instance-level contrasting and point-level clustering, and it can be applied to any off-the-shelf network architecture. The point-level clustering softly segments the 3D points of each point cloud into a discrete number of geometric partitions. The local features can then be learned by implementing an Expectation-Maximization 6 (EM) like algorithm. The instance-level contrasting directly maximizes the similarity of the two global features extracted from two augmentations of one point cloud for the global feature learning. Our instance-level contrasting, which is inspired by 2D image unsupervised approaches BYOL 5, and SimSiam 5 provides supervision to extract global geometry. The instance-level contrasting excludes negative pairs in contrastive learning. It can be treated as a particular case of contrastive learning that only depends on the positive pairs. For the local geometry, we use the observation that humans understand a 3D scene not in terms of points but by assembling it into perceptual groups and structures that are the basic building blocks of recognition 7. This observation motivates us to propose an end-to-end soft clustering approach that mimics this process to extract discriminating local semantic information. Our key contributions are summarized as follows: To learn the point-wise features, we propose an EM-like soft clustering algorithm, point-level clustering, to boost the network and extract the discriminating local semantic information. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply the optimal transport-based clustering method to learn point-wise features for the 3D point clouds in an unsupervised manner. To learn the global features, we propose an architecture agnostic instance-level contrastive learning method which operates on point clouds by maximizing the similarity of the two global features extracted from the two augmented views of one point cloud. We conduct thorough experiments, and our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance. In addition, the experiments on the downstream tasks successfully demonstrate the efficacy of our method."
