    "v-b2 automatic evolution of models/descriptors for feature extraction": "GP-based methods have been widely used for feature extraction and learning from raw images by automatically evolving solutions from scratch. In other words, the input of a GP system is an image, while the output is a single feature or a set of image features. Early works on using GP for evolving descriptors can be found in     . Texture is an important image property considered in EC-based applications. Al-Sahaf et al.  propose a GP-based method to automatically evolve texture descriptors to extract rotation-invariant texture features from images. This method uses a tree-based representation, where the leaf nodes are pixel statistics computed from a small region of the image and internal nodes are arithmetic operators. The root node of the tree is a special one having a predefined number of child nodes to output a binary vector. The way of using the evolved GP trees for texture description is similar to LBP, i.e., transforming the pixel values by applying a rule (i.e., the GP tree) and generating a histogram as features. The GP-evolved descriptor improves the classification performance over the traditional texture descriptors, such as LBP and its variants, on several texture classification tasks. However, the descriptors can only generate a fixed number of texture features. Therefore, in  an improved GP method is developed to extract a flexible number of texture features. Specifically, the method uses a root node accepting a flexible number of child nodes. This method shows its superiority in classifying several datasets in comparison to other texture descriptors. Al-Sahaf et al.  use a multi-tree GP method instead of a special root node to automatically evolve texture descriptors for classification, where only two instances per class are used in the learning process. Rodriguez-Coayahuitl et al.  propose a structured layered GP method for representation learning. This method uses two GP forests, i.e., an encoding forest and a decoding forest. The representation of the image data is learned from the encoding forest. Rodriguez-Coayahuitl et al.  investigate different population dynamics and genetic operators in GP-based autoencoders for representation learning. Rodriguez-Coayahuitl et al.  propose a cooperative co-evolutionary GP method to automatically construct features from raw pixels. This method considers co-evolution at genotype, feature, and output levels. The results show that the co-evolution at the output level is the most effective. In recent years, many GP methods with image-related operators have been developed to automatically learn/extract different types of image features. Liu et al.  propose a multi-objective GP method with a multi-layer representation to learn spatio-temporal features for action recognition. The results show that the features learned by GP are more effective than manually extracted ones and other machine-learned features for action recognition. Liu and Shao  present a GP method to learn models that generate a low-dimensional representation for image hashing. This method evolves multiple GP trees to transform features into binary codes by optimising the empirical risk with a boosting strategy on the training set. This method achieves promising results on two large datasets. Bi et al.  investigate the use of Gaussian filters in GP for image feature learning for classification. In  and , two GP methods with well-developed image descriptors as functions are proposed to automatically learn global and/or local features for image classification. The methods are very effective in different image classification tasks. Bi et al.  propose a GP method with a flexible program structure and many image-related operators to learn various types and numbers of features from raw images for classification. Similar to feature selection, feature extraction can also be formulated as a multi-objective optimisation problem. In  and , multi-objective GP methods are proposed to automatically learn features for face recognition. These methods simultaneously maximise the classification accuracy and minimise the number of features. A potential issue with using EC methods for automatic feature extraction is the high computational cost due to a large number of fitness evaluations. Bi et al.  propose a divide-and-conquer GP method using multiple small populations to learn features from small subsets of the original large training set. This method not only reduces the computational cost but also improves the generalisation performance. In [ref]106, an instance selection-based surrogate method is developed to use multiple well-selected subsets of the large training set to perform fitness evaluation in GP for image feature learning. These methods can significantly reduce the training time without affecting, or even improving, their performance. To sum up, in recent years, many EC-based methods, particularly GP-based methods, have been developed for image feature extraction and learning for different tasks including texture classification, image classification and action recognition. Compared with traditional methods, the EC-based methods require less domain knowledge and are easier to adapt to different tasks. These methods can find optimal parameter values of existing solutions or automatically evolve effective image descriptors for feature extraction from scratch. Therefore, EC-based feature extraction methods typically improve the performances of the tasks being solved. Image feature extraction can often be treated as the multi-objective problem of maximising the performance of the task and minimising the number of features. However, very few EMO methods have been developed to address this problem. In addition, the high computational cost of using EC for image feature extraction needs further attention in the future."
