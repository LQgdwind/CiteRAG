  "title": "HINT: Hierarchical Interaction Network for Clinical Trial Outcome Prediction",
  "sections": {
    "input embedding module": "In this section, we describe the raw data and input representation learning.\nRaw data used for trial outcome prediction come from three different sources, namely (1) drug molecules, (2) disease information and (3) trial protocols. 1. Drug molecules are important for predicting trial outcomes. The drug molecules are represented by SMILES strings or molecule graphs. There are many existing works in embedding drug molecules into latent vectors including knowledge base approach such as Morgan fingerprint and its variants , or representation learning methods for SMILES strings [ref]43 and molecule graphs    .\nHINT supports all three types of molecule embeddings. Formally, we represent all molecules 𝕄={m1,⋯,mNm}𝕄subscript𝑚1⋯subscript𝑚subscript𝑁𝑚\\mathbb{M}=\\{m_{1},\\cdots,m_{N_{m}}\\} as drug (molecule) embedding where fm​(⋅)subscript𝑓𝑚⋅f_{m}(\\cdot) is the molecule embedding function and we average all molecule embeddings from a trial to get the drug embedding vector.\nOur experiments show that average is a better aggregation function than summation for drug embedding.\nThe molecule embedding function fmsubscript𝑓𝑚f_{m} can be any of the above drug embedding methods. HINT supports Morgan fingerprint , SMILES encoder [ref]43, graph message passing neural network (MPNN) 6  for creating the drug embedding. 2. Disease information can also affect the trial outcome.\nFor example, drugs in oncology have much lower approval rate than ones in infectious diseases .\nThe disease information comes from its description and its corresponding ontology such as disease hierarchies like International Classification of Diseases (ICD) . Formally, we represent all diseases 𝔻={d1,⋯,dNd}𝔻subscript𝑑1⋯subscript𝑑subscript𝑁𝑑\\mathbb{D}=\\{d_{1},\\cdots,d_{N_{d}}\\} (Eq. 2) as disease embedding, where GRAM​(di)GRAMsubscript𝑑𝑖\\text{GRAM}(d_{i}) represent an embedding of disease disubscript𝑑𝑖d_{i} using GRAM (graph-based attention model) .\nGRAM is designed to leverage the hierarchical information inherent to medical ontologies and succesfully used in predictive phenotyping  [ref]18. Specifically, the representation of current disease disubscript𝑑𝑖d_{i} is a convex combination of the basic embeddings (𝐞∈ℝd𝐞superscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbf{e}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}) of itself and its ancestors, i.e, where αj​i∈ℝ+subscript𝛼𝑗𝑖subscriptℝ\\alpha_{ji}\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+} represents the attention weight and we have where g1​(⋅)subscript𝑔1⋅g_{1}(\\cdot) is a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer, following . Ancestors​(i)Ancestors𝑖\\text{Ancestors}(i) represents the set of all the ancestors of i𝑖i.\nAn ancestor of code represent a higher-level category of the current code.\nFor example, in ICD 10 code , “D41” (urinary organs neoplasm) and “D41.2” (ureter neoplasm) are the ancestors of “D41.20” (right ureter neoplasm).\n“C34” (malignant neoplasm of bronchus and lung) and “C34.9” (malignant neoplasm of unspecified part of bronchus or lung) are the ancestors of “C34.91” (malignant neoplasm of unspecified part of right bronchus or lung). 3. Trial protocol is a document that describes how a clinical trial will be conducted, includes eligibility criteria, which describes the patient recruitment requirements.\nEligibility criteria contain both inclusion and exclusion criteria denoted by Eq. (3), where 𝐜iIsubscriptsuperscript𝐜𝐼𝑖{\\bm{\\mathbf{c}}}^{I}_{i} and 𝐜jEsubscriptsuperscript𝐜𝐸𝑗{\\bm{\\mathbf{c}}}^{E}_{j} denote the i𝑖i-th and j𝑗j-th sentence in inclusion and exclusion criteria, respectively. To convert the criteria sentences into embedding vectors, we apply\nClinical-BERT  5 which is a domain-specific version of BERT . Then we use 4 one-dimensional convolutional layers  0 (denoted Conv1d) with different kernel sizes (k1,⋯,k4subscript𝑘1⋯subscript𝑘4k_{1},\\cdots,k_{4}) to capture semantics at 4 different granularity level. Specifically, 𝐒Isuperscript𝐒𝐼\\mathbf{S}^{I} and 𝐒Esuperscript𝐒𝐸\\mathbf{S}^{E} are fed into four one-dimensional convolutional layers and the output are concatenated as Then a one-layer fully connected neural network (denoted by FC​(⋅)FC⋅\\text{FC}(\\cdot)) is used to build the protocol embedding 𝐡psubscript𝐡𝑝\\mathbf{h}_{p} based on the concatenation of 𝐩Isuperscript𝐩𝐼\\mathbf{p}^{I} and 𝐩Esuperscript𝐩𝐸\\mathbf{p}^{E}, Thus, the protocol embedding is written as"
