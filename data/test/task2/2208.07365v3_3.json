  "title": "Unsupervised Video Domain Adaptation for Action Recognition: A Disentanglement Perspective",
  "sections": {
    "introduction": "Over the past decades, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has attracted extensive research attention [ref]41. Numerous UDA methods have been proposed and successfully applied to various real-world applications, e.g., object recognition 8  [ref]47, semantic segmentation    , and object detection   . However, most of these methods and their applications are limited to the image domain, while much less attention has been devoted to video-based UDA, where the latter is undoubtedly more challenging. Compared with image-based UDA, the source and target domains also differ temporally in video-based UDA. Images are spatially well-structured data, while videos are sequences of images with both spatial and temporal relations. Existing image-based UDA methods can hardly achieve satisfactory performance on video-based UDA tasks as they fail to consider the temporal dependency of video frames in handling the domain gaps. For instance, in video-based cross-domain action recognition tasks, domain gaps are presented by not only the actions of different persons in different scenarios but also the actions that appear at different timestamps or last at different time lengths. Recently, few works have been proposed for video-based UDA.\nThe key idea is to achieve domain alignment by aligning both frame- and video-level features through adversarial learning  , contrastive learning 7 1, attention , or combination of these mechanisms, e.g., adversarial learning with attention  . Though they have advanced video-based UDA, there is still room for improvement. Generally, existing methods follow an all-in-one way, where both spatial and temporal domain divergence are handled together, for adaptation (Fig. 1, ■■\\blacksquare□□\\square). However, cross-domain videos are highly complex data containing diverse mixed-up information, e.g., domain, semantic, and temporal information, which makes the simultaneous elimination of spatial and temporal divergence insufficient. This motivates us to handle the video-based UDA from a disentanglement perspective (Fig. 1, ■■\\blacksquare□□\\square) so that the spatial and temporal divergence can be well handled separately. To achieve this goal, we first consider the generation process of cross-domain videos, as shown in Fig. 2, where a video is generated from two sets of latent factors: one set consists of a sequence of random variables, which are dynamic and incline to encode the semantic information for downstream tasks, e.g., action recognition;\nanother set is static and introduces some domain-related spatial information to the generated video, e.g., style or appearance. Specifically, the blue / red nodes are the observed source / target videos 𝐱𝒮superscript𝐱𝒮\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathcal{S}} / 𝐱𝒯superscript𝐱𝒯\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathcal{T}}, respectively, over t𝑡t timestamps. Static latent variables 𝐳d𝒮superscriptsubscript𝐳𝑑𝒮\\mathbf{z}_{d}^{\\mathcal{S}} and 𝐳d𝒯superscriptsubscript𝐳𝑑𝒯\\mathbf{z}_{d}^{\\mathcal{T}} follow a joint distribution and combining either of them with dynamic latent variables 𝐳tsubscript𝐳𝑡\\mathbf{z}_{t} constructs one video data of a domain. With the above generative model, we develop a Transfer Sequential Variational AutoEncoder (TranSVAE) for video-based UDA. TranSVAE handles the cross-domain divergence in two levels, where the first level removes the spatial divergence by disentangling 𝐳dsubscript𝐳𝑑\\mathbf{z}_{d} from 𝐳tsubscript𝐳𝑡\\mathbf{z}_{t}; while the second level eliminates the temporal divergence of 𝐳tsubscript𝐳𝑡\\mathbf{z}_{t}. To achieve this, we leverage appropriate constraints to ensure that the disentanglement indeed serves the adaptation purpose. Firstly, we enable a good decoupling of the two sets of latent factors by minimizing their mutual dependence. This encourages these two latent factor sets to be mutually independent. We then consider constraining each latent factor set. For 𝐳d𝒟superscriptsubscript𝐳𝑑𝒟\\mathbf{z}_{d}^{\\mathcal{D}} with 𝒟∈{𝒮,𝒯}𝒟𝒮𝒯\\mathcal{D}\\in\\{\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{T}\\}, we propose a contrastive triplet loss to make them static and domain-specific. This makes us readily handle spatial divergence by disentangling 𝐳d𝒟superscriptsubscript𝐳𝑑𝒟\\mathbf{z}_{d}^{\\mathcal{D}} out. For 𝐳tsubscript𝐳𝑡\\mathbf{z}_{t}, we propose to align them across domains at both frame and video levels through adversarial learning so as to further eliminate the temporal divergence. Meanwhile, as downstream tasks use 𝐳tsubscript𝐳𝑡\\mathbf{z}_{t} as input, we also add the task-specific supervision on 𝐳tsubscript𝐳𝑡\\mathbf{z}_{t} extracted from source data (w/ ground-truth). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that tackles the challenging video-based UDA from a domain disentanglement view. We conduct extensive experiments on popular benchmarks (UCF-HMDB, Jester, Epic-Kitchens) and the results show that TranSVAE consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies and disentanglement analyses to verify the effectiveness of the latent factor decoupling. The main contribution of the paper is summarized as follows: We provide a generative perspective on solving video-based UDA problems. We develop a generative graphical model for the cross-domain video generation process and propose to utilize the sequential VAE as the base generative model. Based on the above generative view, we propose a TranSVAE framework for video-based UDA. By developing four constraints on the latent factors to enable disentanglement to benefit adaptation, the proposed framework is capable of handling the cross-domain divergence from both spatial and temporal levels. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets to verify the effectiveness of TranSVAE. A comprehensive ablation study also demonstrates the positive effect of each loss term on video domain adaptation."
