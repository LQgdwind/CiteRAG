    "introduction": "The Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) has attracted much attention from researchers\nin various disciplines. One direction of the CSP research has been greatly motivated by the so-called Dichotomy Conjecture of Feder and Vardi   that concerns the computational complexity of CSPs over finite relational structures.\nThe Constraint Satisfaction Problem over a finite relational structure 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} of finite signature (also called a template), in its logical formulation, is the problem of deciding the validity of a given primitive positive sentence (pp-sentence), i.e., a sentence that is an existentially quantified conjunction of atomic formulas over 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} – the constraints. Examples of problems in this class include satisfiability problems, graph coloring problems, and solving systems of equations over finite algebraic structures (see   [ref]9 ). The CSP is also ubiquitous in artificial intelligence . A classic result in the field is a theorem by Schaefer  that completely classifies the complexity of CSPs over relational structures with a two-element domain, so-called Boolean structures, by providing a dichotomy theorem: each such a CSP is either solvable in polynomial time or is NP-complete. The Dichotomy Conjecture of Feder and Vardi states that Schaefer’s result extends to arbitrary finite domains. This conjecture inspired a very active research program\nin the last 20 years, culminating in a positive resolution independently obtained by Bulatov 8 and Zhuk 9 . The exact borderline between tractability and hardness can be formulated as follows   [ref]9. Let 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} be a finite relational structure over a finite signature. If every finite structure is homomorphically equivalent to a finite structure pp-interpretable in 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A}, then the CSP over 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} is NP-hard, otherwise it is solvable in polynomial time. It was already recognized in Schaefer’s work (in fact, it was the basis of his approach) that the complexity of a CSP depends only on the set of relations that are pp-definable (i.e., definable by a primitive positive formula) from the template. Such sets of relations are now usually referred to as relational clones.\nThe impetus of rapid development in the area after Feder and Vardi’s seminal work  was a series of papers   that brought to attention and applied a Galois connection between operations and relations studied in the sixties  , which gives a bijective correspondence between relational clones and clones – sets of term operations of algebras. One way to phrase this core fact is as follows: for any finite algebra 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}, its set of invariant relations (subuniverses of powers or subpowers in algebraic terminology) is always a relational clone; every relational clone is of this form; and two algebras have the same relational clone of subpowers if and only if they have the same set of term operations (see Subsection 2.1). For instance, a Boolean CSP, say over the domain {0,1}01\\{0,1\\}, is solvable in polynomial time if and only if the relations of the template are subpowers of one of four types of algebras – an algebra with a single constant operation, a semilattice, the majority algebra, or the affine Mal’cev algebra of ℤ/2ℤ2\\mathbb{Z}/{2} (see Subsection 2.2). This connection between relations and operations allowed researchers to apply techniques from Universal Algebra. Application of these techniques became known as the algebraic approach to the CSP, although one may argue that the name misses the point a little – the success of the approach lies mostly in combining and moving back and forth between the relational and algebraic side, and this is the case for this paper as well.\nThe general theory of the CSP was further refined in subsequent papers  \nand turned out to be an efficient tool in other types of constraint problems including the\nQuantified CSP   ,\nthe Counting CSP  , some optimization problems, e.g. the Valued\nCSP  and robust approximability ,\ninfinite-domain CSPs  ,\nrelated promise problems such as\n“approximate coloring” and the Promise CSP  , and many others. One useful technical finding of  is that every CSP is equivalent to a CSP over an idempotent template, i.e. a template that contains all the singleton unary relations. This allows us to use parameters in pp-definitions\nand omit homomorphic equivalence in the first item of Theorem 1.1. On the algebraic side, this allows us to concentrate on so-called idempotent algebras (see Subsection 7.2). Another important contribution of that paper was a conjecture postulating, for idempotent structures, the exact borderline between polynomial solvability and NP-hardness, which coincides with the borderline stated in Theorem 1.1. The hardness part was already dealt with in the same paper and what was left was the tractability part. Within the realm of idempotent structures, the algebras corresponding to the second item of Theorem 1.1 are so-called Taylor algebras (see Subsection 2.3). The following theorem is therefore the core of the two proofs of the Dichotomy Conjecture. Let 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} be an idempotent structure. If there exists an idempotent Taylor algebra 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} such that all relations in 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} are subpowers of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}, then the CSP over 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} is solvable in polynomial time. Partial results toward Theorem 1.2 include dichotomies for various classes of relational structures and algebras (e.g. the class of 3-element algebras 3 and the class of structures containing all unary relations 4), understanding of the limits of algorithmic techniques (e.g. local consistency methods  and finding generators for the set of solutions ), and finding potentially useful characterizations of Taylor algebras (e.g. by means of weak near-unanimity operations 4 and by means of cyclic operations ). The papers  and  initiated a technique which is now referred to as the absorption theory . Absorption theory is one of the fruits of CSP-motivated research which also impacted other CSP-related problems as well as universal algebra (e.g. ) and it is one of the three theories this paper is concerned with. Bulatov and Zhuk in their resolution of the Dichotomy Conjecture (and their prior and subsequent work) developed novel techniques, which we refer to as Bulatov’s theory and Zhuk’s theory in this paper.\nThese theories are (understandably) mostly focused on the task at hand, to prove Theorem 1.2, and as such have several shortcomings. First, some of the new concepts are still evolving as the need arises and they do not yet feel elegant and settled. Moreover, the theories are technically complex which makes it difficult to master them and to apply them in different contexts. This is best witnessed by the absence of results which employ these theories from different authors (needless to say they have already witnessed their potential).\nSecond, they both employ the following trick. Instead of studying a general, possibly wild Taylor algebra, one can first tame it by taking a certain Taylor reduct – an algebra whose operations are only some of the term operations but which is still Taylor.\nTaking reducts does not result in any loss of generality in Theorem 1.2, since reducts keep all the original invariant relations, so proving tractability for a reduct is sufficient for tractability for the original problem. However, taking reducts does result in loss of generality of the theory and it is not yet clear to which natural classes of algebras the theories apply. Moreover, these reducts are different in the two approaches.\nThird, connections between Bulatov’s and Zhuk’s theories were not understood at all. While Zhuk’s theory and absorption theory at least had some concepts in common, Bulatov’s theory seemed quite orthogonal to the rest. The contributions of this paper unify, simplify, and extend parts of these three theories, making them, we hope, more accessible and reducing the prerequisites for the dichotomy proofs.\nIn particular, we initiate a systematic study of minimal Taylor algebras, i.e., those algebras that are Taylor but such that none of their proper reducts is Taylor. Thus, we employ the above trick to the extreme and study, in a sense, the tamest algebras or, in other words, “hardest” tractable CSPs. This restriction, on the one hand, limits the scope of the theory but, on the other hand, gives us a framework in which the three theories do not look separate at all anymore. Indeed, the authors find the extent to which the notions of the three theories simplify and unify in minimal Taylor algebras to be truly striking.\nEven though our results\ndo not cover some advanced parts of the three theories, we believe that they have the potential to evolve into one coherent theory of finite algebras that would make the CSP Dichotomy Theorem an exercise (albeit hard) and that would have applications well beyond constraint problems.\n The contributions can be divided into two groups, results for (all finite) Taylor algebras stated in Section 4 and results for minimal Taylor algebras in Sections 5 and 6. We now describe them in more detail together with more background."
