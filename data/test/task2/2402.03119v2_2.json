  "sections": {
    "introduction": "Knowledge Distillation (KD)  has proven to be an effective scheme for improving classification accuracies of relatively small ‘student’ models, by training them to match the logit distribution of larger, more powerful ‘teacher’ models. Despite its simplicity, this approach can be sufficient for the students to match the teacher’s accuracy, while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources of the teacher .\nRecent findings, however, show that\nwhile the students might match the teacher’s accuracy,\nthe knowledge is nonetheless not distilled faithfully 0. Faithful KD, i.e. a distillation that ensures that the teacher’s and the student’s functions share properties beyond classification accuracy, is however desirable for many reasons.\nE.g., the lack of agreement between models 0\ncan\nhurt the user experience when updating machine-learning-based applications [ref]3 2. Similarly, if the students use different input features than the teachers, they might not be right for the right reasons [ref]35. Further, given the recent AI Act proposal by European legislators , it is likely that the interpretability of models will play an increasingly important role and become an intrinsic part of the model functionality.\nTo maintain the full functionality of a model, KD should thus ensure that the students allow for the same degree of model interpretability as the teachers. To address this, in this work we study if promoting explanation similarity using commonly used model explanations such as GradCAM  or those of the recently proposed B-cos models [ref]5 can increase KD fidelity. This should be the case if such explanations indeed reflect meaningful aspects of the models’ ‘internal reasoning’. Concretely, we propose ‘explanation-enhanced’ KD (e2KD),\na simple, parameter-free, and model-agnostic addition to KD in which we train the student to also match the teacher’s explanations. Interestingly, despite its simplicity, we find e2KD to significantly improve distillation fidelity in a variety of settings (Good Teachers Explain: Explanation-Enhanced Knowledge Distillation). Specifically, e2KD improves student accuracy by ensuring that the students learn to be right for the right reasons and inherently promotes consistent explanations between teachers and students. Moreover, the benefits of e2KD are robust to limited data, approximate explanations, and across model architectures. In summary, we make the following contributions: We propose explanation-enhanced KD (e2KD)\nand train the students to not only match the teachers’ logits, but also their explanations (Sec. 3.1). This not only yields highly competitive students in terms of accuracy, but also significantly improves KD fidelity on the ImageNet , Waterbirds-100  , and PASCAL VOC  datasets. We discuss three desiderata for measuring KD fidelity. In particular, we (a) evaluate whether the student is performant and has high agreement with the teacher (Sec. 3.2.1),\n(b) examine whether students learn to use the same input features as a teacher that was guided to be ‘right for the right reasons’ even when distilling with biased data (Sec. 3.2.2),\nand (c) explore whether they learn the same explanations and architectural priors as the teacher (Sec. 3.2.3). We show e2KD to be a robust approach for improving knowledge distillation, which provides consistent gains across model architectures and with limited data.\nMoreover, e2KD is even robust to using cheaper ‘approximate’ explanations.\nSpecifically, for this we propose using\n‘frozen explanations’\nwhich are only computed once and, during training, we apply any augmentations simultaneously to the image and the explanations (Sec. 3.3)."
