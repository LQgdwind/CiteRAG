    "related works": "Model-based methods. Recently, a new category of methods is explored in the active learning paradigm where a separate model from the learner is trained for selecting a sub-set of the most representative data. Our method is based on this category. One of the first approaches [ref]42 attached a loss-learning module so that loss can be predicted offline for the unlabelled samples. In , another task-agnostic solution deploys a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to map the available data on a latent space. Thus, a discriminator is trained in an adversarial manner to classify labelled from unlabelled. The advantage of our method over this approach is the exploitation of the relative relationship between the\nexamples by sharing information through message-passing operations in GCN. GCNs in active learning.\nGCNs   have opened new active learning methods that have been successfully applied in  [ref]38 [ref]6 1. In comparison to these methods, our approach has distinguished learner and sampler. It makes our approach task-agnostic and also\ngets benefited from model-based methods mentioned just before. Moreover, none of these methods is trained in a sequential manner.\n [ref]38 proposes K-Medoids clustering for the feature propagation between the labelled and unlabelled nodes. A regional uncertainty algorithm is presented in  by extending the PageRank  algorithm to the active learning problem. Similarly, [ref]6 combines node uncertainty with graph centrality for selecting the new samples. A more complex algorithm is introduced in 1 where a reinforcement scheme with multi-armed bandits decides between the three query measurements from [ref]6.\nHowever, these works [ref]6 1 [ref]38 derive their selection mechanism on the assumption of a Graph learner. This does not make them directly comparable with our proposal where a GCN is trained separately for a different objective function than the learner. Uncertainty-based methods. Earlier techniques for sampling unlabelled data have been explored through uncertainty exploration of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A Bayesian approximation introduced in  produce meaningful uncertainty measurements by variational inference of a Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout) adapted architecture. Hence, it is successfully integrated into active learning by 0 6 9 .\nWith the rise of GPU computation power,  ensemble-based method outperformed MC Dropout.\nGeometric-based methods. Although there have been studies exploring the data space through the representations of the learning model (0  4), the first work applying it for CNNs as an active learning problem, CoreSet, has been presented in . The key principle depends on minimising the difference between the loss of a labelled set and a small unlabelled subset through a geometric-defined bound. We furthermore represent this baseline in our experiments as it successfully over-passed the uncertainty-based ones."
