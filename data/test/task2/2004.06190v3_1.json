    "neural text summarization": "Closely following the advances in neural machine translation    and language modeling   and, fueled by the increased availability of computational resources as well as large annotated datasets   , neural summarization is nowadays achieving state-of-the-art results. Extractive methods aim to select the salient sentences from the input and combine them, typically by concatenation, in order to generate a summary. This is usually approached as a binary classification problem, where for each sentence the model decides whether it should be included in the summary or not   [ref]6. On the other hand, abstractive methods try to encode the input into a hidden representation and then use a decoder conditioned on that representation to generate the summary    [ref]6    . In addition to these two main categories, there also exist hybrid approaches that combine both extractive and abstractive methods either by using pointer-generators  [ref]5  5 0 or by fusing extractive and abstractive models [ref]16 . In order to encode the input text, different methods are using different variations of encoders based on RNNs   [ref]5 5   or convolutional networks [ref]16. One notable addition here is 6 which introduces the Rotational Unit of Memory (RUM). RUM is a different type of RNN unit that can be superior to conventional LSTMs in some summarization scenarios. Finally, given the increased popularity and success of large pre-trained Transformers  in various NLP tasks, many recent methods employ Transformer models [ref]6. Towards that direction a variety of pre-training objectives have been suggested that are better suited for the task of abstractive summarization    . In an effort to enhance performance and address some common shortcomings of neural summarization models, policy learning 7 has been proposed [ref]5 5 [ref]16 8 9 to further improve summarization performance."
