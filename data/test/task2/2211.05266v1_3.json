    "experiments": "We implement our algorithm in C++, and we do some experiments under Linux with a computer of 64 AMD 3990X 2.90GHz CPU and 64 GB RAM. We also realize the parallel computation with MPI. Our code can be downloaded from http://mmrc.iss.ac.cn/ ~jcheng/pai/RootFinding.tar.gz as well as a simple user guider from http://mmrc.iss.ac.cn/ ~jcheng/pai/Pai User Guide.pdf.\nWe compare our algorithm with MK test    and Bertini . There are two other famous homotopy continuation softwares: PHCpack  and Hom4ps 0. We choose Bertini to compare just because it derives real roots directly. For systems with small sizes, we check their roots with symbolic methods such as  and we will point out if the results of some methods are not correct. We use NiDj to represent the systems formed by polynomials with iùëñi variables and degree jùëój in the tables. NiDjE means we scaling back the coordinates of the variables. For example, the polynomials in N2D5E case is got by substituting variables (x1,x2)subscriptùë•1subscriptùë•2(x_{1},x_{2}) with (100‚àóx1,100‚àóx2)100subscriptùë•1100subscriptùë•2(100*x_{1},100*x_{2}), and then we can just compute the roots in [‚àí1,1]2superscript112[-1,1]^{2} to get the roots in [‚àí100,100]2superscript1001002[-100,100]^{2} of the original system, which is more efficient in some cases. In the tables, Case means the type of systems. Terms means the number of terms of each polynomial in the system. Coef means the maximal absolute value of the coefficients of the polynomials in the systems. Range means the box to search the real roots for our method and MK test. But Bertini finds all the complex roots of the given systems, including the real roots out of the given box. Roots means the number of real roots of the systems. For our method, there are three parameters: The first one is the number of certified real roots of the system inside the box; The second one is the number of the suspected boxes of the system inside the box; The last one is the number of possible real roots of the system in all the suspected boxes with the method mentioned in Remark 6 of Algorithm 2.\nMK contains only the first two parameters for their roots. Bertini shows only the real roots among all its complex roots, including the real roots out of the box. Times means the computing times for the related examples in seconds. We take 5 systems for each case to get their average computing time.\n‚Äú~‚Äù means we do not compute the examples. For Bertini, it means the example is out of its computing ability or the computing time is larger than 10000 seconds or their cases are NiDjE. For MK, there are no certified real roots, thus we do not compute the examples. In the examples, we usually set the precision œÅ=10‚àí6ùúåsuperscript106\\rho=10^{-6}. See the data in Table LABEL:tab-ex. Remarks for Table 1: In case N2D51, one example has 7 roots and we get 5 of them and miss finding the other 2 from the suspected boxes. In the related case N2D51E, we directly find 7 certified roots for the example but another example miss one root from the suspected boxes. In case N3D9, the number of the total average roots is 13.4. Bertini misses one root, one of whose coordinate is around 3,000,000. Our code finds all the real roots of the systems inside the box [‚àí100,100]3superscript1001003[-100,100]^{3}. There are totally 3 roots out of the box. In case N3D101, the computing times for 3 of the 5 systems are less than 100 seconds. But one example takes 20157 seconds and there are 11 certified solutions and no suspected boxes. We find that several roots are very close to each other. One example has 17 certified roots and 162 suspected boxes, which takes 112.398 seconds. In Table LABEL:tab-ex, the examples above N3D51 does not use parallel computing and the results are proved by symbolic computation. From N3D51, we use MPI parallel computing with 30 cores and the results are without proof with symbolic computation. In order to analyse the influence of the number of the terms to our method, we design the examples in Table 2. The systems all have the same solutions but the number of the terms of the polynomials are different. We can find that our method is sensitive to the number of terms of the polynomials in the systems. When the terms of the polynomials increase, the computing times increase and the suspected roots increase. This claim matches the complexity analysis in Lemma 17. The examples in Table 3 shows the influence of the bit size of the coefficients of the polynomials in the systems to our method. Increasing the bit size of the coefficients does not influence a lot to our method or to MK method but does influence a lot to Bertini since the trick step in Bertini is sensitive to the bit size of the coefficients. This phenomenon matches the bit complexity analysis of our algorithm, see Theorem 18. We can also find that Bertini can not work for systems with large coefficients. We also check the influence of the number of real roots inside a box to our method, see Table 4. If a system has more real roots inside a box, then our methods will take more times. It is reasonable since more roots mean that there are more boxes need to do the existence checking which is time-consuming. The number of real roots of a system almost does not influence the computing times of Bertini since the number of the total complex roots is unchanged under the situation. We also check the systems with multiple zeros, see Table 5. Usually, systems with multiple real zeros will take more computing time since near the multiple zeros there exist many suspected boxes. To exclude the ones without real roots with the method mentioned in Remark 6 of Algorithm 2 is time-consuming. And in Case multiN3D12, when excluding suspected boxes, one root is counted twice since it is very close to the boundaries of two suspected boxes.\nSome multiple roots of the systems may be computed as several roots by Bertini, so the numbers of roots in Cases multiN2D6 and multiN2D12 are not exactly the numbers of the exact roots of the systems. We test the five systems N2D9 in Table LABEL:tab-ex with our method for different precisions, see Table 6. We can find that the higher precision we use, the less suspected boxes we get and the more computing times we need. We check our implementation of parallel computing with MPI on N4D9 in Table LABEL:tab-ex. We use 4, 8, 16, 32, 60 cores to compute the 5 systems and get the average computing time. The related data is given in Table 7. It shows the speedup of the parallel computing of our code. From Table LABEL:tab-ex, we can find that our method is sensitive to the number of variables and the degree of the polynomials also influence the computing times, this suits for the complexity analysis in Theorem 18. For some examples whose roots are distributed in a very bad position, our method may take much time. Compared to the three related methods, our method is complete for square nonlinear systems with only simple roots, as the MK method. But the interval Newton‚Äôs method and the Œ±ùõº\\alpha-theory method are not complete. Since the exclusion test of MK method and our method are the same, the computing times of two methods are very close if we do not exclude the suspected roots. But we have more certified roots. The existence checking method of MK seldom works for systems with more than two variables. But our method works for systems with 6 variables as shown in Table LABEL:tab-ex. The reason is that Miranda theorem works for evaluating the functions of the systems directly on some of the boundaries of the boxes to require that the result interval does not contain zero. For certifying a simple root, the MK method, our method and the interval Newton‚Äôs method need only to compute the evaluations of the functions in the system and their order-one derivatives. The Œ±ùõº\\alpha-theory method needs compute higher order derivatives of each function in the system. The existence criteria of the interval Newton method, the Œ±ùõº\\alpha-theory method and our method, all need the information of order-one derivatives of the functions. But the Miranda based method needs only the evaluation of the functions. When the box which contains a zero of the system becomes small, the functions are very close to zero. When evaluated on the boundaries of the box, which are also a box (or an interval), the intervals derived from the functions contain zero with high probability, especially for functions with more than two variables. The deeper subdivision does not change the situation and even makes it worse in practice because of the interval calculus. This is the reason why the Miranda based method works only for less variables systems with lower degrees. Our experiments support the claim. Our method avoids using functions directly but using order-one derivatives of the functions for the existence of a zero. It works for systems with more variables and high degrees. Compared to Bertini, our method works well for polynomial systems with larger B√©zout bound, higher degrees and less variables. Bertini works well for systems with many variables but not so larger B√©zout bound. Our method can find roots of non-polynomial systems but Bertini can not. There are two other advantages of our method: One is that it can find roots of a system in a fixed local region. The other is that each of our certified root box contains exactly one real root of the system. Currently, our method can work only for systems with only several variables. To overcome this shortcoming is our future work. We will use our code to solve two problems in applications. The equations of this example is from robotics and describes the inverse kinematics of an elbow manipulator. One can find the problem in  . We solve directly the original one without transforming it to an algebraic system. Thus we have only 6 variables but there are 12 variables in  . The following is the system given in  . We replace s‚Äãi,c‚Äãiùë†ùëñùëêùëñsi,ci with sin‚Å°(6.3‚Äãxi),cos‚Å°(6.3‚Äãxi)6.3subscriptùë•ùëñ6.3subscriptùë•ùëñ\\sin(6.3\\,x_{i}),\\cos(6.3\\,x_{i}) for i=1,‚Ä¶,6ùëñ1‚Ä¶6i=1,\\ldots,6 in (7). Thus we can consider xisubscriptùë•ùëñx_{i} in    such that 6.3‚Äãxi6.3subscriptùë•ùëñ6.3x_{i} covers [0,2‚ÄãœÄ]02ùúã[0,2\\pi]. Doing so, we get all the solutions of the system. Computing the real roots of the new system in  6superscript016 ^{6} with precision œÅ=10‚àí3ùúåsuperscript103\\rho=10^{-3} and 32 cores with MPI parallel computing, we can get 10 certified roots: Furthermore, we get 4116 suspected boxes and find none roots from them. We miss 6 real roots. The computing time is 843.994 seconds. If we set œÅ=10‚àí6ùúåsuperscript106\\rho=10^{-6}, we get exactly 16 certified roots and no suspected boxes which takes 2133.05 seconds: The following problem is the inverse\nposition problem for a six-revolute-joint problem in mechanics, one can find it in  .\nThe defining equations in the reference are as below. There are 8 equations and 8 variables. The values of ai,j,j=1,‚Ä¶,17formulae-sequencesubscriptùëéùëñùëóùëó1‚Ä¶17a_{i,j},j=1,\\ldots,17 can be found in .\nWe replace xi,xi+1subscriptùë•ùëñsubscriptùë•ùëñ1x_{i},x_{i+1} with sin‚Å°(6.3‚Äãyi+12),cos‚Å°(6.3‚Äãyi+12)6.3subscriptùë¶ùëñ126.3subscriptùë¶ùëñ12\\sin(6.3\\,y_{\\frac{i+1}{2}}),\\cos(6.3\\,y_{\\frac{i+1}{2}}) for i=1,3,5,7ùëñ1357i=1,3,5,7 in the first equation above.\nThen we can get a system with 4 equations and 4 variables. Computing its real roots in  4superscript014 ^{4} with precision œÅ=10‚àí3ùúåsuperscript103\\rho=10^{-3} and 32 cores with MPI parallel computing, we get 9 certified roots: and 2143 suspected boxes. We did not find roots from the suspected boxes. It takes 322.695 seconds. If we set œÅ=10‚àí6ùúåsuperscript106\\rho=10^{-6}, we get exactly 12 certified roots and no suspected boxes which takes 902.642 seconds: This two examples show that our method works for non-polynomial systems and gives certified solutions.\n"
