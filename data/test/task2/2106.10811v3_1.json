    "related-work": "Surface reconstruction.\nReconstructing surfaces from point clouds is a difficult problem that has been studied for many years. Its main challenges include (1) nonuniform point sampling, (2) noisy point positions and normals due to sampling inaccuracy, scan registration misalignment and normal estimation errors, and (3) missing data in parts of the surface due to occlusions. Reconstruction methods attempt to overcome these challenges and infer the unknown underlying surface. Classical combinatorical approaches for reconstruction include triangulation methods  , alpha shapes  and Voronoi diagrams . Classical implicit function based approaches include piecewise polynomial functions  , summing radial basis functions 2, and solving a Poisson equation to find a global indicator function  . For a more in depth survey of classical surface reconstruction methods we refer the reader to Berger et al.¬†.\nRecently, and more relevant to this work, learning based approaches with neural networks have been proposed. These include parameteric methods that learn mappings from a parametric space to a region of the surface 8 , methods that learn an implicit volumetric function on regular grids  , methods that learn implicit neural representations (INRs) for the shape and recently a differentiable point-to-mesh optimisation layer . Shape implicit neural representations (INRs).\nNeural networks have shown to be very efficient in representing shapes as implicit functions¬†  7 [ref]2 [ref]3  [ref]39    , and scenes    . These networks are trained to output either a signed distance function  [ref]2 [ref]3 7       , an occupancy function   [ref]39, or recently a representation that unifies the two . Our method uses a signed distance function (SDF) to represent the shape. SDFs were popularised for shape INRs by DeepSDF . However, for off surface points they require the ground truth for whether they are inside/outside the shape (i.e. the sign of the SDF), which is unrealistic. SAL [ref]2 improves upon this by using a sign agnostic training method that requires no extra 3D supervision, and SALD [ref]3 shows that using ground truth normals for points on the surface greatly improves performance. IGR 7 introduce an important eikonal equation based loss term to regularise the learnt function towards being an SDF, which can be used with or without normals. NSP  frame the task as a kernel regression problem where the kernel chosen is equivalent to the limit of infinitely wide, shallow ReLU networks. FFN [ref]39 and SIREN  demonstrate that INRs using conventional MLPs bias toward low-frequency solutions, and thus explicitly introduce high frequencies into their architecture. FFN (which learn an occupancy implicit function) use a ReLU MLP with a Fourier feature layer, while SIREN uses periodic (specific sine) activation functions. The benefit of the latter is that second derivatives (and in fact all orders) are defined and continuous, which allows for higher order supervision as we use in this paper. On the other hand, DeepSDF, SAL use ReLU for activation, so the same cannot be done with those methods. Ground truth normal information is not usually available in real world, raw scan data, and must be noisily estimated. Note that all these methods, except SAL (and DeepSDF which uses other unrealistic ground truth information), report results with ground truth normal information. Technically IGR and SIREN can operate without such information by dropping the corresponding loss term in their overall loss, but our experimental results in Section¬†6 show that performance significantly drops in their absence. On the other hand, we show that without normal information our method does not reduce performance as significantly, and in fact does on par with methods that use normals. Concurrent work include IDF  and PHASE . IDFs extend SIRENs to explicitly decompose learning the high and low frequencies of a shape, and combine by having the local high frequency as a displacement in the low frequency SIREN‚Äôs normal direction. PHASE introduce a loss that learns a density function whose limit is an occupancy, and whose log transform is a SDF. They also introduce a version without ground truth normal supervision, PHASE+FF, which uses the Fourier features of FFN [ref]39. Initializing shape INRs.\nAs finding good shape implicit representations is hard due to the ill-posed nature of the task¬†, many methods introduce initialization or regularization to bias toward favourable solutions¬†[ref]2 [ref]3 7. SAL¬†[ref]2 introduce a geometric initialization for ReLU MLPs, which carefully chooses the initial weights (or the distribution of the initial weights) in particular layers to make the initial function be approximately the signed distance function to a rùëür-radius sphere. This initialization has shown to have favourable properties for reconstruction, such as in-object and out-object sign consistency. For SIRENs, to allow for training deeper networks for general INRs, Sitzmann et al.¬† proposed an initialization that preserves the distribution of activations through its layers. However for shape INRs, this initialization lacks a geometric grounding and sometimes causes unwanted ghost geometries. In this paper, we propose two novel initializations for SIRENs that extend the notion of geometric initialization to periodic activations and show that initializing with high frequencies is important for capturing fine detail."
