NFs with this structure have successfully solved various inverse problems in imaging¬† [ref]40 [ref]45  [ref]43. SRFlow¬† has achieved excellent performance on super-resolution space generation by adapting Glow¬† as its backbone. It has also been extended to many variants such as\n    [ref]40.\nIn low-light image enhancement, LLFlow¬†[ref]45 and TSFlow¬†[ref]43 have successfully utilized conditional NF to reconstruct normally exposed images from low-quality inputs.\nSome studies dealt with other inverse problems such as inpainting¬†, dehazing¬†, denoising¬† and colorization¬†."
