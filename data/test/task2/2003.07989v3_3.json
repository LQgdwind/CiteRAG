    "related persistent homology computation software": "In Section 2.4, we briefly introduce several software to compute persistent homology, paying special attention on computing Vietoris-Rips barcodes. In this section, we elaborate more on this topic. The basic algorithm upon which all such software are based on is given in Algorithm 1. Many optimizations are used by these software, and have made significant progress over the basic computation of Algorithm 1. Amongst all such software, Ripser is known to achieve state of the art time and memory performance in computing Vietoris-Rips barcodes  . Thus it should suffice to compare our time and memory performance against Ripser alone. We overview a few, and certainly not all, of the related software besides Ripser. Gudhi  is a software that computes persistent homology for many filtration types. It uses a general data structure called a simplex tree  [ref]12 for general simplicial complexes for storage of simplices and related operations on simplices as well as the compressed annotation matrix algorithm [ref]11 for computing persistent cohomology. It can compute Vietoris-Rips barcodes. Eirene  is another software for computing persistent homology. It can also compute Vietoris-Rips barcodes. One of its important features is that it is able to compute cycle representatives. Paper  details how Eirene can be optimized with GPU. Hypha (a hybrid persistent homology matrix reduction accelerator)  is a recent open source software for the matrix reduction part of computing persistent homology for explicitly represented boundary matrices, similar in style to  . Hypha is one of the first publicly available softwares using GPU. A framework based on the separation of parallelisms is designed and implemented in Hypha due to the existence of atleast two very different execution patterns during matrix reduction. Hypha also finds apparent pairs on GPU and subsequently forms a submatrix on multi-core similar to in Ripser++."
