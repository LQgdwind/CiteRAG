    "transfer learning": "In the machine learning domain, transfer learning is a concept in which prior knowledge gained from one domain and task will be applied to solve another problem from a different domain and task but related one somehow. In NLP tasks, the word embeddings models that encode and represent an entity such as word, sentence, document, etc., to a fixed-length vector, were the first attempts toward applying the transfer learning approach to adjust to the best performance. Using pre-trained word embeddings such as Word2Vec, Glove[ref]31, and FastText exploited from a large text corpus such as Wikipedia, news articles, etc., result in great advances in different NLP tasks especially for problems at which there may not be enough training data. However, these pre-trained models suffer for their disability to better disambiguate between the correct sense of a given word regarding different contexts in which it appears. To address this issue, different contextual-based pre-trained models such as Universal Language Model Fine-Tuning (ULMFiT), Embedding from Language Models (ELMO), OpenAI’ s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)[ref]37, and Google’s BERT model3 emerged. In these models, a universal language model is pre-trained on a general-domain corpus by applying different techniques such as bi-directional LSTM, unidirectional transformer[ref]37, and bidirectional transformer3 and then a downstream task will be fine-tuned using discriminative methods. For the first time, Waseem et al. applied a multi-task learning strategy as a transfer learning model to transfer knowledge between two different hateful and offensive datasets. Their results indicated the ability of multi-task learning to generalize to new datasets and distributions in hate speech detection tasks. Afterward, using a combination of GloVe and pre-trained ELMO words embeddings, Rizoiu et al. proposed a transfer learning approach for hate speech and abusive language detection (two datasets provided by ). To adjust the ELMo representation to the hate speech detection domain, they applied a bi-LSTM layer independently trained left-to-right and right-to-left on both tasks simultaneously and then extracted sentence embedding using a max-pooling approach. At the end, a specific classifier was trained for each task. Due to the jointly solving both tasks, the insights learned from one task can be transferred to the other task. Comparing the results from these two transfer learning-based studies indicates that the approach of Waseem et al. outperforms Rizoiu et al., therefore, we consider the approach of Waseem et al. as our baseline here and compare our proposed method with that. Due to the lack of undoubted labeled data and the inability of surface features to capture the subtle semantics in text, identification of hateful and offensive content is an intricate task8. To address this issue, we use the pre-trained language model BERT for hate speech classification and try to fine-tune a specific task by leveraging information from different transformer encoders."
