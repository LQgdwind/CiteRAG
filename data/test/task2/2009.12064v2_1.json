  "title": "Attention Meets Perturbations: Robust and Interpretable Attention with Adversarial Training",
  "sections": {
    "i introduction": "Attention mechanisms [ref]1 are widely applied in natural language processing (NLP) field through deep neural networks (DNNs).\nAs the effectiveness of attention mechanisms became apparent in various tasks      , they were applied not only to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but also to convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\nMoreover, Transformers  which make proactive use of attention mechanisms have also achieved excellent results.\nHowever, it has been pointed out that DNN models tend to be locally unstable, and even tiny perturbations to the original inputs  or attention mechanisms can mislead the models [ref]10.\nSpecifically, Jain and Wallace [ref]10 used a practical bi-directional RNN (BiRNN) model to investigate the effect of attention mechanisms and reported that learned attention weights based on the model are vulnerable to perturbations.111In Jain and Wallace [ref]10, the vulnerability of attention mechanisms to perturbations is confirmed with an RNN-based model [ref]10. In this paper, we focus on the model, and Transformer -based model such as BERT  and their successor models   will be future work. The Transformer  and its follow-up models   have self-attention mechanisms that estimate the relationship of each word in the sentence.\nThese models take advantage of the effect of the mechanisms and have shown promising performances.\nThus, there is no doubt that the effect of the mechanisms is extremely large.\nHowever, they are not easy to train, as they require huge amounts of GPU memory to maintain the weights of the model.\nRecently, there have been proposals to reduce memory consumption , and we acknowledge the advantages of the models.\nOn the other hand, the application of attention mechanisms to DNN models, such as RNN and CNN models, which have been widely used and do not require relatively high training requirements, has not been sufficiently studied. In this paper, we focus on improving the robustness of commonly used BiRNN models (as described detail in Section III) to perturbations in the attention mechanisms.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the result of overcoming the vulnerability of the attention mechanisms is an improvement in the prediction performance and model interpretability. To tackle the models’ vulnerability to perturbation, Goodfellow et al.  proposed adversarial training (AT) that increases robustness by adding adversarial perturbations to the input and the training technique forcing the model to address its difficulties.\nPrevious studies   in the image recognition field have theoretically explained the regularization effect of AT and shown that it improves the robustness of the model for unseen images. AT is also widely used in the NLP field as a powerful regularization technique [ref]18  0 1.\nIn pioneering work, Miyato et al. [ref]18 proposed a simple yet effective technique to improving the text classification performance by applying AT to a word embedding space.\nLater, interpretable AT (iAT) was proposed to increase the interpretability of the model by restricting the direction of the perturbations to existing words in the word embedding space .\nThe attention weight of each word is considered an indicator of the importance of each word 2, and thus, in terms of interpretability, we assume that the weight is considered a higher-order feature than the word embedding.\nTherefore, AT for attention mechanisms that adds an adversarial perturbation to deceive the attention mechanisms is expected to be more effective than AT for word embedding. From motivations above, we propose a new general training technique for attention mechanisms based on AT, called adversarial training for attention (Attention AT) and more interpretable adversarial training for attention (Attention iAT).\nThe proposed techniques are the first attempt to employ AT for attention mechanisms.\nThe proposed Attention AT/iAT is expected to improve the robustness and the interpretability of the model by appropriately overcoming the adversarial perturbations to attention mechanisms 3 4 5.\nBecause our proposed AT techniques for attention mechanisms is model-independent and a general technique, it can be applied to various DNN models (e.g., RNN and CNN) with attention mechanisms.\nOur technique can also be applied to any similarity functions for attention mechanisms, e.g, additive function [ref]1 and scaled dot-product function , which is famous for calculating the similarity in attention mechanisms. To demonstrate the effects of these techniques, we evaluated them compared to several other state-of-the-art AT-based techniques [ref]18  with ten common datasets for different NLP tasks.\nThese datasets included binary classification (BC), question answering (QA), and natural language inference (NLI).\nWe also evaluated how the attention weights obtained through the proposed AT technique agreed with the word importance calculated by the gradients 6.\nEvaluating the proposed techniques, we obtained the following findings concerning AT for attention mechanisms in NLP: AT for attention mechanisms improves the prediction performance of various NLP tasks. AT for attention mechanisms helps the model learn cleaner attention (as shown in Figure 1) and demonstrates a stronger correlation with the word importance calculated from the model gradients. The proposed training techniques are much less independent concerning perturbation size in AT. Especially, our Attention iAT demonstrated the best performance in nine out of ten tasks and more interpretable attention, i.e., resulting attention weight correlated more strongly with the gradient-based word importance 6.\nThe implementation required to reproduce these techniques and the evaluation experiments are available on GitHub.222https://github.com/shunk031/attention-meets-perturbation"
