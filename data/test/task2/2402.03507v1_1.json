  "title": "Neural networks for abstraction and reasoning: Towards broad generalization in machines",
  "sections": {
    "introduction": "For the past fifty years, researchers in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have been striving to replicate human abilities of abstraction and reasoning - developing computer systems that can learn new concepts from a small number of examples, something that humans find relatively easy [ref]1. While most recent AI research has focused on narrow intelligence (solving specific tasks given large amounts of data), we revisit whether new advances can allow computers to extrapolate to new concepts rather than merely interpolate. This concept has been referred to as broad generalization: humans do this through abstraction and reasoning; drawing analogies to previous situations and thinking logically. While AI systems such as neural networks excel at a wide range of tasks, from protein folding  to playing Go , their inability to broadly generalize has precluded deployments in the real world, such as in self-driving cars [5, badgeneralization]. To enable safer AI, we must understand how to build systems that can reason in unusual situations. To systematically build and evaluate computer systems that can solve abstract reasoning problems in a human-like intelligent way, we turn to a concrete benchmark. In 2019, the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) was introduced, as an attempt to codify a benchmark of intelligence  - a sort of ‘IQ Test’ for AI. The ARC contains a series of human-designed tasks on grids, which require learning some transformation from a small number of demonstrations. Despite three international competitions with over $100,000 in prize money, performance on ARC has proved elusive, with no single system surpassing 50% accuracy on the ARC-Easy dataset or 20% on the test set . With only a handful of training examples per ARC task, and 10900superscript1090010^{900} possible answers (of which exactly one gains credit), traditional machine learning (ML) methods that require large datasets have so far been unable to make progress. Current state-of-the-art approaches to ARC make use of complex hand-crafted algorithms based on brute force search, without harnessing any ML . This work looks at whether novel machine learning systems that focus on abstraction and reasoning can achieve broad generalization, using ARC as a focal point. We investigate two new approaches to ARC, focusing on novel ways to incorporate neural networks to build better abstraction and reasoning solvers. Specifically: We adapt the DreamCoder algorithm, a recent state-of-the-art algorithm for program induction, to solve ARC tasks. DreamCoder writes programs in a domain-specific language; we design the Perceptual Abstraction & Reasoning Language (PeARL) pure functional language for this purpose. Our DreamCoder implementation solves 3×3\\times more tasks than existing work [ref]9. We introduce a new framework for solving ARC tasks using large-language models (LLMs), transforming these visual tasks into a textual domain. A detailed evaluation of three model classes [ref]10   shows that LLMs can achieve competitive performance with human-crafted systems with the right augmentation and domain transformation. We build an ensemble of multiple ARC solvers, accounting for heterogeneous performance. This ensemble approach leverages multiple complimentary techniques and represents an improvement over the current state-of-the-art . We publish an open-source Python library for working with ARC to stimulate work in this field."
