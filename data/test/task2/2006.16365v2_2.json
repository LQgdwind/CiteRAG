In general, MEI strongly outperforms the baselines. MEI and ConvE both aim to learn the interaction between the embedding vectors, and interestingly, the multi-partition embedding interaction used in MEI can achieve better results than the convolutional neural networks used in ConvE. MEI also outperforms the general bilinear model RESCAL and other recent state-of-the-art bilinear models DistMult, ComplEx, and SimplE, which is explained by the fact that they are special cases of MEI with specific interaction patterns, as shown in Section 3.2. Compared with TorusE, the results show that an expressive interaction mechanism can help a smaller model outperform a much larger model. There are some recent techniques that help to improve the performance of old models, but we show that MEI can still outperform retuned ComplEx and RotatE reported with comparable settings. Moreover, note that MEI is highly general and potentially preferable for sophisticated datasets. Empirical results agree very well with the predictions of Theorem 1 about the optimal parameter efficiency. On WN18 and WN18RR, MEI1√ó200 consistently outperforms MEI3√ó100 using fewer parameters. On FB15K and FB15K-237, the model sizes are reversed due to different numbers of entities and relations, with MEI1√ó200 having two times more parameters than MEI3√ó100. On FB15K, as predicted, MEI3√ó100 consistently outperforms MEI1√ó200. On FB15K-237, MEI3√ó100 outperforms MEI1√ó200 most of the time, although not by a large margin, but uses only half the number of parameters. These results are particularly interesting because they suggest that when the embedding size Dùê∑D is large enough, MEI with K>1ùêæ1K>1 can both scale to larger embedding sizes and have better results than MEI with K=1ùêæ1K=1 partition."
