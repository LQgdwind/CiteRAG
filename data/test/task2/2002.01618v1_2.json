    "introduction": "As machine learning and artificial intelligence become more present in everyday applications, so do efforts to better capture, understand, and imagine this coexistence. Experts from diverse disciplines are working together and critically examining the impact of algorithmic decisions, their assumptions, and their biases¬†    . Error-prone, computationally complex, and failing in ways unexpected by humans, such algorithms called early on for transparency, interpretability, accountability, and control¬†    2. More recently, these efforts have redoubled (surveyed in¬† 3), fueled by funding and legal initiatives such as the DARPA Explainable Artificial Intelligence¬†5 and the European Union‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation¬†, while feeding into future initiatives such as the Algorithmic Accountability Act¬†. Machine teaching¬† 5 lies at the core of these efforts as it enables end-users and domain experts with no machine learning expertise to innovate and build AI-infused111A term in Amershi et al., 2019¬† for ‚Äúsystems that have features harnessing AI capabilities that are directly exposed to the end user.‚Äù systems. Beyond helping to democratize machine learning, it offers an opportunity for a deeper understanding of how people perceive and interact with such systems to inform the design of future interfaces and algorithms¬† ‚Äì a perspective this paper shares. Within this paradigm, teachable interfaces¬†9  explore applications where users can explicitly train a model with their generated data and labels. While facilitating user control, the effectiveness of these applications can be hindered by the lack of expertise or misconceptions about machine learning. Though personalization is often the ultimate goal (e.g.,¬†), the interactive nature of these interfaces can help users in return to uncover basic machine learning concepts (e.g.,¬†8). In this paper, we examine how people conceptualize, experience and reflect on their engagement with machine teaching in the context of a supervised image classification task, a task where humans are extremely good compared to machines, especially when they possess prior knowledge of the image classes. Using a teachable interface for object recognition, we recruit participants (N=100ùëÅ100N=100) through Amazon Mechanical Turk222https://www.mturk.com/ to choose three objects in their environment and train a model to distinguish between them in real-time using the camera on their mobile phones, as shown in Figure¬†1. Why crowdsourcing. Beyond being utilized as a platform for obtaining labeled data quickly at low cost, crowdsourcing is also employed for behavioral and perception studies (e.g.,¬†7  3) including those for understanding people‚Äôs interactions with machine learning systems, surveyed in¬†0. Allowing us to quickly recruit a large participant pool for this study, it also enables data collection outside a laboratory to obtain high variability and real-world illumination, backgrounds, and camera manipulations in the user‚Äôs environment. We build a web-based testbed for a mobile teachable object recognizer and ask participants to train and evaluate it on three objects of choice within an object category (Figure¬†1). Categories represent daily objects that span different characteristics such as size, shape, color, material, and function. Through a performance-based payment scheme¬†9, participants are called to iterate and reflect over their efforts with the goal of making their recognition models more robust. Serving as an oracle, they are tasked with delivering a teaching set to the recognition model to help it learn the classification task. We conduct a contextualized quantitative analysis on the participants photos, their written responses, as well as their model performance. We find that diversity, important in machine learning, is deemed important by a majority of participants and incorporated in teaching strategies, drawing from parallels to how humans generalize across object size, viewpoint, location, and illumination¬†6. Many misconceptions relate to consistency; few think that it is good to be consistent and teach with almost identical examples; others failed to be consistent on incorporating diversity across classes. While participants have good intuition on importance of discriminatory features in teaching but on evaluating their models, we observe susceptibility to missing edge cases. Last, we see that the majority of participants do not change strategies on a second attempt even though possess a reasonable intuition on what would be important. We see how our findings and insights can help better understand non-experts‚Äô interactions with machine teaching and guide the design of future teachable interfaces that can anticipate users misconceptions and assumptions."
