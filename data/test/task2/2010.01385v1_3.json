    "strict-interval abps": "A strict-interval ABP, defined in  (See Definition  2.1), is a restriction of the notion of interval ABPs introduced by [ref]4. In the original definition given by , every sub-program in a strict-interval ABP P𝑃P is defined on a π𝜋\\pi-interval of variables for some order π𝜋\\pi, however, without loss of generality, we assume π𝜋\\pi to be the identity permutation on n𝑛n variables. Therefore, an interval of variables [i,j],i<j𝑖𝑗𝑖𝑗[i,j],\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ i<j here is the set {xi,…,xj}subscript𝑥𝑖…subscript𝑥𝑗\\{x_{i},\\ldots,x_{j}\\}. In this section we show that strict-interval ABPs are equivalent to ROABPs upto a polynomial blow-up in size. The class of strict-interval ABPs is equivalent to the class of ROABPs. The proof of Theorem 5.1 involves a crucial observation that in a strict-interval ABP, variables are read in at most two orders and the nodes that correspond to paths that read in different orders can be isolated. We start with some observations on intervals in [1,n]1𝑛[1,n] and the intervals involved in a strict interval ABP. Let P𝑃P be a strict-interval ABP over the variables X={x1,…,xn}𝑋subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛X=\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\}. For any two nodes u𝑢u and v𝑣v in P𝑃P, let Iu,vsubscript𝐼𝑢𝑣I_{u,v} be the interval of variables associated with the sub-program of P𝑃P with u𝑢u as the start node and v𝑣v as the terminal node. For two intervals I=[a,b],J=[c,d]formulae-sequence𝐼𝑎𝑏𝐽𝑐𝑑I=[a,b],J=[c,d] in [1,n]1𝑛[1,n], we say I⪯Jprecedes-or-equals𝐼𝐽I\\preceq J, if b≤c𝑏𝑐b\\leq c. Note that any two intervals I𝐼I and J𝐽J in [1,n]1𝑛[1,n] are comparable under ⪯precedes-or-equals\\preceq if and only if either they are disjoint or the largest element in one of the intervals is the smallest element in the other. This defines a natural transitive relation on the set of all intervals in [1,n]1𝑛[1,n].\nThe following is a useful property of ⪯precedes-or-equals\\preceq: Let I,J𝐼𝐽I,J and J′superscript𝐽′J^{\\prime} be intervals over [1,n]1𝑛[1,n] such that I⪯Jprecedes-or-equals𝐼𝐽I\\preceq J and J′⊆Jsuperscript𝐽′𝐽J^{\\prime}\\subseteq J. Then I⪯J′precedes-or-equals𝐼superscript𝐽′I\\preceq J^{\\prime}. Let I=[a,b],J=[c,d]formulae-sequence𝐼𝑎𝑏𝐽𝑐𝑑I=[a,b],J=[c,d] and J′=[c′,d′]superscript𝐽′superscript𝑐′superscript𝑑′J^{\\prime}=[c^{\\prime},d^{\\prime}]. As I⪯Jprecedes-or-equals𝐼𝐽I\\preceq J, we have b≤c𝑏𝑐b\\leq c. Further, since J′⊆Jsuperscript𝐽′𝐽J^{\\prime}\\subseteq J, we have c≤c′𝑐superscript𝑐′c\\leq c^{\\prime} and d′≤dsuperscript𝑑′𝑑d^{\\prime}\\leq d. Therefore, b≤c′𝑏superscript𝑐′b\\leq c^{\\prime} and hence I⪯J′precedes-or-equals𝐼superscript𝐽′I\\preceq J^{\\prime}. We begin with an observation on the structure of intervals of the sub-programs of P𝑃P.\nLet v𝑣v be a node in P𝑃P. We say v𝑣v is an ascending node, if Is,v⪯Iv,tprecedes-or-equalssubscript𝐼𝑠𝑣subscript𝐼𝑣𝑡I_{s,v}\\preceq I_{v,t} and a descending node if Iv,t⪯Is,vprecedes-or-equalssubscript𝐼𝑣𝑡subscript𝐼𝑠𝑣I_{v,t}\\preceq I_{s,v}. Let P𝑃P be a strict-interval ABP and v𝑣v any node in P𝑃P. Then, v𝑣v is either ascending or descending and not both. Let I=Is,v𝐼subscript𝐼𝑠𝑣I=I_{s,v} and J=Iv,t𝐽subscript𝐼𝑣𝑡J=I_{v,t}. Since P𝑃P is a strict-interval ABP, the intervals I𝐼I and J𝐽J are disjoint and hence either I⪯Jprecedes-or-equals𝐼𝐽I\\preceq J or J⪯Iprecedes-or-equals𝐽𝐼J\\preceq I as required. Consider any s𝑠s to t𝑡t path ρ𝜌\\rho in P𝑃P. We say that ρ𝜌\\rho is ascending if every node in ρ𝜌\\rho except s𝑠s and t𝑡t is ascending. Similarly, ρ𝜌\\rho is called descending if every node in ρ𝜌\\rho except s𝑠s and t𝑡t is descending. Let P𝑃P be a strict interval ABP and let ρ𝜌\\rho any s𝑠s to t𝑡t path in P𝑃P. Then either ρ𝜌\\rho is ascending or descending. We prove that no s𝑠s to t𝑡t path in P𝑃P can have both ascending and descending nodes. For the sake of contradiction, suppose that ρ𝜌\\rho has both ascending and descending nodes. There are two cases. In the first, there is an edge (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) in ρ𝜌\\rho such that u𝑢u is an ascending node and v𝑣v is a descending node. Let I=Is,u,J=Iu,t,I′=Is,vformulae-sequence𝐼subscript𝐼𝑠𝑢formulae-sequence𝐽subscript𝐼𝑢𝑡superscript𝐼′subscript𝐼𝑠𝑣I=I_{s,u},J=I_{u,t},I^{\\prime}=I_{s,v} and J′=Iv,tsuperscript𝐽′subscript𝐼𝑣𝑡J^{\\prime}=I_{v,t}.\nSince Ps,usubscript𝑃𝑠𝑢P_{s,u} is a sub-program of Ps,vsubscript𝑃𝑠𝑣P_{s,v}, we have I⊆I′𝐼superscript𝐼′I\\subseteq I^{\\prime}, similarly J′⊆Jsuperscript𝐽′𝐽J^{\\prime}\\subseteq J. By the assumption, we have I⪯Jprecedes-or-equals𝐼𝐽I\\preceq J and J′⪯I′precedes-or-equalssuperscript𝐽′superscript𝐼′J^{\\prime}\\preceq I^{\\prime}. By Observation 2, we have I⪯J′precedes-or-equals𝐼superscript𝐽′I\\preceq J^{\\prime} and J′⪯I′precedes-or-equalssuperscript𝐽′superscript𝐼′J^{\\prime}\\preceq I^{\\prime}. By transitivity, we have I⪯I′precedes-or-equals𝐼superscript𝐼′I\\preceq I^{\\prime}. However, by the definition of ⪯precedes-or-equals\\preceq, I𝐼I and I′superscript𝐼′I^{\\prime} are incomparable, which is a contradiction. The second possibility is u𝑢u being a descending node and v𝑣v being an ascending node. In this case, J⪯Iprecedes-or-equals𝐽𝐼J\\preceq I and I′⪯J′precedes-or-equalssuperscript𝐼′superscript𝐽′I^{\\prime}\\preceq J^{\\prime}. Then, by Observation 2, we have J′⪯Iprecedes-or-equalssuperscript𝐽′𝐼J^{\\prime}\\preceq I as J′⊆Jsuperscript𝐽′𝐽J^{\\prime}\\subseteq J. Therefore, J⪯J′precedes-or-equals𝐽superscript𝐽′J\\preceq J^{\\prime} by the transitivity of ⪯precedes-or-equals\\preceq, a contradiction. This completes the proof. Lemma 5.4 implies that the set of all non-terminal nodes of P𝑃P can be partitioned into two sets such that there is no edge from one set to the other. Formally: Let P𝑃P be an interval ABP. There exist two strict-interval ABPs P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} and P2subscript𝑃2P_{2} such that All non-terminal nodes of P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} are ascending nodes and all non-terminal nodes of P2subscript𝑃2P_{2} are descending nodes; and P=P1+P2𝑃subscript𝑃1subscript𝑃2P=P_{1}+P_{2}. Let P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} be the sub-program of P𝑃P obtained by removing all descending nodes from P𝑃P and P2subscript𝑃2P_{2} be the sub-program of P𝑃P obtained by removing all ascending nodes in P𝑃P. By Lemma 5.4, the non-terminal nodes in P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} and P2subscript𝑃2P_{2} are disjoint and every s𝑠s to t𝑡t path ρ𝜌\\rho in P𝑃P is either a s𝑠s to t𝑡t path in P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} or a s𝑠s to t𝑡t path in P2subscript𝑃2P_{2} but not both. Thus P=P1+P2𝑃subscript𝑃1subscript𝑃2P=P_{1}+P_{2}. Next we show that any strict-interval ABP consisting only of ascending or only of descending nodes can in fact be converted into an ROABP. Let P𝑃P be a strict-interval ABP consisting only of ascending nodes or only of descending nodes. Then the polynomial computed by P𝑃P can also be computed by a ROABP P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime} of size polynomial in 𝗌𝗂𝗓𝖾​(P)𝗌𝗂𝗓𝖾𝑃{\\sf size}(P). The order of variables in P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime} is x1,…,xnsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛x_{1},\\dots,x_{n} if P𝑃P has only ascending nodes and xn,…,x1subscript𝑥𝑛…subscript𝑥1x_{n},\\ldots,x_{1} if P𝑃P has only descending nodes. We consider the case when all non-terminal nodes of P𝑃P are ascending nodes. Let ρ𝜌\\rho be any s𝑠s to t𝑡t path in P𝑃P. We claim that the edge labels in ρ𝜌\\rho are according to the order x1,…,xn.subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}. Suppose that there are edges (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) and (u′,v′)superscript𝑢′superscript𝑣′(u^{\\prime},v^{\\prime}) occurring in that order in ρ𝜌\\rho such that (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) is labelled by xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} and (u′,v′)superscript𝑢′superscript𝑣′(u^{\\prime},v^{\\prime}) is labelled by xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j} with j<i𝑗𝑖j<i. Let I′=Is,u′superscript𝐼′subscript𝐼𝑠superscript𝑢′I^{\\prime}=I_{s,u^{\\prime}} and J′=Iu′,tsuperscript𝐽′subscript𝐼superscript𝑢′𝑡J^{\\prime}=I_{u^{\\prime},t}. Since i∈I′𝑖superscript𝐼′i\\in I^{\\prime}, j∈J′𝑗superscript𝐽′j\\in J^{\\prime} and I′∩J′=∅superscript𝐼′superscript𝐽′I^{\\prime}\\cap J^{\\prime}=\\emptyset, it must be the case that J′⪯I′precedes-or-equalssuperscript𝐽′superscript𝐼′J^{\\prime}\\preceq I^{\\prime} and hence u′superscript𝑢′u^{\\prime} must be a descending node, a contradiction. This establishes that P𝑃P is an one ordered ABP. By the equivalence between one ordered ABPs and ROABPs (, ), we conclude that the polynomial computed by P𝑃P can also be computed by a ROABP of size polynomial in the size of P𝑃P. The argument is similar when all non-terminal nodes of P𝑃P are descending. In this case, we have i<j𝑖𝑗i<j in the above argument and hence I′⪯J′precedes-or-equalssuperscript𝐼′superscript𝐽′I^{\\prime}\\preceq J^{\\prime}, making u′superscript𝑢′u^{\\prime} an ascending node leading to a contradiction. This concludes the proof. A permutation π𝜋\\pi of [1,n]1𝑛[1,n] naturally induces the order xπ​(1),…,xπ​(n)subscript𝑥𝜋1…subscript𝑥𝜋𝑛x_{\\pi(1)},\\ldots,x_{\\pi(n)}. The reverse of π𝜋\\pi is the order xπ​(n),xπ​(n−1),…,xπ​(1)subscript𝑥𝜋𝑛subscript𝑥𝜋𝑛1…subscript𝑥𝜋1x_{\\pi(n)},x_{\\pi(n-1)},\\ldots,x_{\\pi(1)}. Since branching programs are layered, any multilinear polynomial computed by a ROABP where variables occur in the order given by π𝜋\\pi can also be computed by a ROABP where variables occur in the reverse of π𝜋\\pi. Let P𝑃P be a ROABP where variables occur in the order induced by a permutation π𝜋\\pi. The polynomial computed by P𝑃P can also be computed by a ROABP of same size as P𝑃P that reads variables in the reverse order corresponding to π𝜋\\pi. Let P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime} be the ROABP obtained by reversing the edges of P𝑃P and swapping the start and terminal nodes. Since P𝑃P is a layered DAG, there is a bijection between the set of all s𝑠s to t𝑡t paths in P𝑃P and the set of all s𝑠s to t𝑡t paths in P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime}, where the order of occurrence of nodes and hence the edge labels are reversed. This completes the proof. The above observations immediately establish Theorem 5.1. Let P𝑃P be a strict-interval ABP of size S𝑆S computing a multilinear polynomial f𝑓f. By Lemma 5.6 there are strict interval ABPs P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} and P2subscript𝑃2P_{2} such that P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} has only ascending non-terminal nodes and P2subscript𝑃2P_{2} has only descending non-terminal nodes such that f=f1+f2𝑓subscript𝑓1subscript𝑓2f=f_{1}+f_{2} where fisubscript𝑓𝑖f_{i} is the polynomial computed by Pisubscript𝑃𝑖P_{i}, i∈{1,2}𝑖12i\\in\\{1,2\\}. By Lemma 5.8 and Observation 4, f1subscript𝑓1f_{1} and f2subscript𝑓2f_{2} can be computed by a ROABPs that read the variables in the order x1,…,xnsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}. Then f1+f2subscript𝑓1subscript𝑓2f_{1}+f_{2} can also be computed by an ROABP.\nIt remains to bound the size of the resulting ROABP. Note that 𝗌𝗂𝗓𝖾​(Pi)≤S𝗌𝗂𝗓𝖾subscript𝑃𝑖𝑆{\\sf size}(P_{i})\\leq S. A ROABP for fisubscript𝑓𝑖f_{i} can be obtained by staggering the reads of Pisubscript𝑃𝑖P_{i} which blows up the size of the ABP by a factor of n𝑛n (, ). Therefore size of the resulting ROABP is at most 2​n​S≤O​(S2)2𝑛𝑆𝑂superscript𝑆22nS\\leq O(S^{2}). Using Theorem 5.1, we can design the following white-box PIT for strict-interval ABPs. Given a strict-interval ABP P𝑃P of size s𝑠s, we can check whether the polynomial computed by P𝑃P is identically zero in time O​(poly​(S))𝑂poly𝑆O(\\text{poly}(S)). The proof follows from Theorem 5.1 and the polynomial time white-box PIT algorithm given by  for non-commutative ABPs, since the variables in X𝑋X are read only once, in a fixed order, in a ROABP. The notion of intervals of variables corresponding to every sub-program can be applied to formulas in the form of Interval Formulas, where every sub-formula corresponds to an interval. In the following section we explore how such a model can be used to generalize the model of ROFs, and in what ways it differs from ROFs."
