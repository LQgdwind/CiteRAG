    "scenario 𝖦𝖦𝖦𝖦\\mathsf{gg}: task identity information given during train and inference": "Datasets, Models & Training  In this experiment we validate the performance of SupSup on SplitCIFAR100 and SplitImageNet. Following Wen et al. [ref]51, SplitCIFAR100 randomly partitions CIFAR100  into 20 different 5-way classification problems.\nSimilarly, SplitImageNet randomly splits the ImageNet [ref]5 dataset into 100 different 10-way classification tasks.\nFollowing [ref]51 we use a ResNet-18 with fewer channels for SplitCIFAR100 and a standard ResNet-50  for SplitImageNet. The Edge-Popup algorithm from [ref]39 is used to obtain supermasks for various sparsities with a layer-wise budget from . We either initialize each new mask randomly (as in [ref]39) or use a running mean of all previous learned masks. This simple method of “Transfer” works very well, as illustrated by Figure 2. Additional training details and hyperparameters are provided in Section D. Computation  In Scenario 𝖦𝖦𝖦𝖦\\mathsf{GG}, the primary advantage of SupSup from Mallya et al.  or Wen et al. [ref]51 is that SupSup does not require the base model W𝑊W to be stored. Since W𝑊W is random it suffices to store only the random seed. For a fair comparison we also train BatchE [ref]51 with random weights. The sparse supermasks are stored in the standard scipy.sparse.csc222https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html format with 16 bit integers. Moreover, SupSup requires minimal overhead in terms of forwards pass compute. Elementwise product by a binary mask can be implemented via memory access, i.e. selecting indices. Modern GPUs have very high memory bandwidth so the time cost of this operation is small with respect to the time of a forward pass. In particular, on a 1080 Ti this operation requires ∼1%similar-toabsentpercent1\\sim 1\\% of the forward pass time for a ResNet-50, less than the overhead of BatchE (computation in Section D). Baselines  In Figure 2, for “Separate Heads” we train different heads for each task using a trunk (all layers except the final layer) trained on the first task. In contrast “Separate Heads - Rand W” uses a random trunk. BatchE results are given with the trunk trained on the first task (as in [ref]51) and random weights W𝑊W. For “Upper Bound”, individual models are trained for each task. Furthermore, the trunk for task i𝑖i is trained on tasks 1,…,i1…𝑖1,...,i. For “Lower Bound” a shared trunk of the network is trained continuously and a separate head is trained for each task. Since catastrophic forgetting occurs we omit “Lower Bound” from Figure 2 (the SplitCIFAR100 accuracy is 24.5%)."
