    "iii-b search algorithms": "Given a search space, the search algorithm (i.e., the controller) describes the child neural network architecture. To accomplish this, as discussed, the search algorithm composes a single Normal cell and a single Reduction cell from the search space. Each cell consists of a number of nodes (i.e., 4, which is empirically deduced and configurable), as shown in Figure 5. For each node, the search algorithm makes the following decisions: Choose Input 1 and Input 2 from the output of the previous nodes. If it is the first node, choose from the inputs of the cell. Choose the operation for Input 1 and Input 2 from: (i) identity, (ii) separable convolution hyper-layer with kernel size 3 or 5, and (iii)\naverage or max pooling with kernel size 3. These choices are inspired from . Add output of the two operations and return as the output of the node. A separable convolution hyper-layer consists of sequentially connected layers of ReLU, separable convolution, batch normalization, and dropout.\nWe found that using a high-rate dropout layer (e.g., 0.4) during search alleviates overfitting to training data, leading to a more generalizable model. Furthermore, similar to , we employ two sequentially connected separable convolution hyper-layers every time the search algorithm chooses this operation. Such a structure for convolution layers has also been extensively used for deep ETC models   , and has been shown to achieve high classification accuracy. Importantly, the search algorithm may not choose the output from a node as an input to other nodes in the same cell. We call these unused outputs Loose Ends. Because Loose Ends may contain useful information\n, they are fed to the add operation in the output of the last node of the cell. Numerous state-of-the-art search algorithms have been proposed and evaluated in a setting with abundant resources (e.g., in excess of 400 GPUs 5  ) and, or minimal to no time constraint (e.g., up to 50,000 trials , 310 epochs for architecture search 0). Indeed, in a resource- or time-constrained environment, these algorithms may not converge to their optimal performance. Moreover, simple Random Search (RS) has proven very competitive against its more complex counterparts.\nIn 3, the authors compared a variation of EA and MCTS to RS with the spectrum of measured accuracy ranging between 94.1% and 94.2%. Similarly, authors in  0 5 showed RS performance to be within 1% of other search algorithms. The modularity of AutoML4ETC allows to choose any search algorithm independently from the search space. Therefore, we investigate different state-of-the-art neural architecture search algorithms, and evaluate their impact on the performance and complexity of the best child model. Specifically, in AutoML4ETC, we experiment with RL 0, MCTS 3, and EA 5, and compare them against the baseline RS algorithm. With the exception of RS, these search algorithms were developed and evaluated on the NASNet or ENAS Micro search spaces, which were an inspiration for our novel search space in AutoML4ETC. Therefore, comparing these searching algorithms in AutoML4ETC is particularly relevant (cf. Section IV-E)."
