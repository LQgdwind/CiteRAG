    "labeling a feature space basis": "We define basis labeling as the procedure of assigning a concept label name to each one of its vectors. When the basis vectors have been learned in a supervised way, the concept label to attribute to the each vector is actually known before learning the vector’s direction. However, when the basis is learned without annotations (such as the current work) or if the natural feature space basis is considered (as in [ref]11 or [ref]12), attributing meaning to each basis vector requires to put the vector under test. In the testing procedure, each basis vector is accompanied with a (possibly learned) bias (threshold) to form a linear classifier. Then, for all possible concepts, the suitability of the classifier to separate the representations of one concept (positive samples) with respect to the representations of other concepts (negative samples) is evaluated. Finally, each basis vector is assigned a concept label name based on the evaluation metrics of the aforementioned procedure. It is evident, that labeling a basis requires access to a dataset containing concept annotations, such as [ref]11 [ref]17, or . Bau et al. [ref]11 assigned one concept label to each vector of the natural feature space basis based on the Broden dataset (which was also introduced in the same work). Later, Mu et al. [ref]12 used the same dataset to label the natural basis with logical compositions of concepts (e.g. the concept of “blue AND (NOT water)”). In this work, we use [ref]11 to label the bases extracted with our method, while [ref]12 or other potential future works could also be considered."
