    "error functionals": "While the approaches presented above are based on heuristics, some works try to deduce an optimal¬†kùëòk for the¬†kùëòk nearest neighborhoods based on error functions.\nFor instance, the authors of¬† work in the context of the Moving Least Squares (MLS) framework (see¬† 6 7 ) for function approximation.\nThe authors perform an extensive error analysis to quantify the approximation error both independent and depending on the given data.\nFinally, they obtain an error functional.\nThis is then evaluated for different neighborhood sizes¬†kùëòk.\nThe neighborhood¬†ùí©ksubscriptùí©ùëò\\mathcal{N}_{k} yielding the smallest error is finally chosen to be used in the actual MLS approximation. In contrast, the authors of¬† deduce an error bound on the normal estimation obtained from different neighborhood sizes.\nUtilizing this error functional, they obtain the best suited neighborhood size for normal computation.\nThe work of¬† heavily depends on the MLS framework in which the error analysis is deduced, while the work of¬† depends on the framework of normal computation. The authors of¬† take a more general approach in the context of segmentation of 3D point sets. They also use the concept of combinatorial neighborhoods, going back to results of¬† 0.\nIn order to choose an optimal value for¬†kùëòk, the authors turn to the covariance matrix, which is symmetric and positive-semi-definite.\nThus, the matrix has three non-negative eigenvalues.\nFollowing an idea of¬†2, in the work of¬†[ref]26, the authors grow a neighborhood and consider a surface variation as a measure to grow a neighborhood around each point¬†pisubscriptùëùùëñp_{i}.\nThe same quantity is used by¬†.\nHowever, the authors of¬†[ref]26 do not grow a neighborhood, but choose a size¬†kùëòk for it according to a consistent curvature level.\nThe authors of¬† do not stop at these information, but proceed to consider three more quantities derived from the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix reflecting point set features, see¬†0 .\nAfterwards, following the concept of entropy by Shannon¬†, they evaluate combinatorial and geometric neighborhood sizes via two error measures (see Section¬†4 for a detailed discussion)."
