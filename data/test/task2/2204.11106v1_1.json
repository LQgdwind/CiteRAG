    "introduction": "In recent years, there is an increasing interest in adopting the Stackelberg competition model  to address the critical security concern that arises in protecting our ports, airports, transportation, and other critical national infrastructures (see, e.g.,   ). In these problems, the attacker’s target is to maximize the illicit gain, while the defender tries to mitigate the attack by minimizing the attacker’s objective through deploying defending resources. In this paper, we consider an abstract model for general defending problems called interdiction with packing constraints (IPC). In IPC, given are a set of items, together with a leader and a follower. Both the leader and the follower have their own (multi-dimensional) budgets, respectively. Each item is associated with a profit, which is the same to the leader and the follower, and will consume the leader’s (follower’s) budget if it is selected by the leader (follower). The leader and the follower will select items in a sequential way: First, the leader selects items within the leader’s budget. Then the follower selects items from the remaining items within the follower’s budget. The goal of the leader is to minimize the maximum profit that the follower can obtain. IPC captures the general setting where the follower is the attacker who gets profit by attacking items, and the leader is the defender who tries to minimize the attacker’s gain by protecting a subset of items. IPC can be formulated as a bilevel integer program (IP) as follows. Denote by I={1,2,⋯,n}𝐼12⋯𝑛I=\\{1,2,\\cdots,n\\} the set of items. Each item j∈I𝑗𝐼j\\in I is associated with a profit pj∈ℚ>0subscript𝑝𝑗subscriptℚabsent0p_{j}\\in\\mathbb{Q}_{>0}, an sAsubscript𝑠𝐴s_{A}-dimensional cost vector 𝐀j∈ℚ≥0sAsubscript𝐀𝑗superscriptsubscriptℚabsent0subscript𝑠𝐴\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf A$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf A$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf A$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf A$}}_{j}\\in\\mathbb{Q}_{\\geq 0}^{s_{A}} to the leader and an sBsubscript𝑠𝐵s_{B}-dimensional weight vector 𝐁j∈ℚ≥0sBsubscript𝐁𝑗superscriptsubscriptℚabsent0subscript𝑠𝐵\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf B$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf B$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf B$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf B$}}_{j}\\in\\mathbb{Q}_{\\geq 0}^{s_{B}} to the follower. The leader and the follower have their own budget vectors, denoted by 𝐚∈ℚ≥0sA𝐚superscriptsubscriptℚabsent0subscript𝑠𝐴{\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf a$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf a$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf a$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf a$}}}\\in\\mathbb{Q}_{\\geq 0}^{s_{A}} and 𝐛∈ℚ≥0sB𝐛superscriptsubscriptℚabsent0subscript𝑠𝐵{\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf b$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf b$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf b$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf b$}}}\\in\\mathbb{Q}_{\\geq 0}^{s_{B}}, respectively. We introduce 0-1 variables xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j} and yjsubscript𝑦𝑗y_{j} for each j∈I𝑗𝐼j\\in I as the decision variables for the leader and the follower. More precisely, if the leader chooses item j𝑗j, then xj=1subscript𝑥𝑗1x_{j}=1, otherwise xj=0subscript𝑥𝑗0x_{j}=0. Similarly, yj=1subscript𝑦𝑗1y_{j}=1 if the follower chooses item j𝑗j and yj=0subscript𝑦𝑗0y_{j}=0 otherwise.

IPC can be formulated as a bilevel program IPC(I,𝐚,𝐛)𝐼𝐚𝐛(I,{\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf a$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf a$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf a$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf a$}}},{\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf b$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf b$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf b$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf b$}}}) as follows: where 𝐀=(𝐀1,⋯,𝐀n)𝐀subscript𝐀1⋯subscript𝐀𝑛\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf A$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf A$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf A$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf A$}}=(\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf A$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf A$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf A$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf A$}}_{1},\\cdots,\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf A$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf A$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf A$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf A$}}_{n}) and 𝐁=(𝐁1,⋯,𝐁n)𝐁subscript𝐁1⋯subscript𝐁𝑛\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf B$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf B$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf B$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf B$}}=(\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf B$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf B$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf B$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf B$}}_{1},\\cdots,\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf B$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf B$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf B$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf B$}}_{n}) are sA×nsubscript𝑠𝐴𝑛s_{A}\\times n and sB×nsubscript𝑠𝐵𝑛s_{B}\\times n non-negative rational matrices, respectively. The most relevant prior work to our IPC model is the well-known knapsack interdiction problem introduced by DeNegre 3, which is the special case of IPC where sA=1subscript𝑠𝐴1s_{A}=1 and sB=1subscript𝑠𝐵1s_{B}=1. Very recently, Caprara et al.  proved that DeNegre’s knapsack interdiction problem is ∑2psuperscriptsubscript2𝑝\\sum_{2}^{p}-complete and strongly NP-hard, which also implies the ∑2psuperscriptsubscript2𝑝\\sum_{2}^{p}-completeness and strongly NP-hardness for IPC. Caprara et al. showed a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for a special case of knapsack interdiction problem where the profit of an item is equal to its weight to the follower. Except for the knapsack interdiction problem, we are not aware of any approximation algorithms for other special cases of IPC. However, if we relax the follower’s problem by allowing 𝐲𝐲\\textstyle\\bf y to take fractional value, then there are several research works in the literature. The most relevant work is the packing interdiction problem studied by Dinitz and Gupta 4, where the follower’s problem is given by max⁡{∑jpj​(1−xj)​yj:B​𝐲≤𝐛,𝐲≥𝟎}:subscript𝑗subscript𝑝𝑗1subscript𝑥𝑗subscript𝑦𝑗formulae-sequence𝐵𝐲𝐛𝐲0\\max\\{\\sum_{j}p_{j}(1-x_{j})y_{j}:B{\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf y$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf y$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf y$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf y$}}}\\leq{\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf b$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf b$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf b$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf b$}}},{\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf y$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf y$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf y$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf y$}}}\\geq\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf 0$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf 0$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf 0$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf 0$}}\\}, while the leader’s constraints are the same as (1b) and (1c) except that sA=1subscript𝑠𝐴1s_{A}=1. Dinitz and Gupta provided an approximation algorithm whose ratio depends on the sparsity of the matrix B𝐵B. Their techniques crucially rely on the fact that 𝐲𝐲\\textstyle\\bf y can take fractional value, and therefore duality theory can be applied to the follower’s problem, allowing the bilevel problem to be transformed to a single level problem. Besides the packing interdiction problem, quite a few graph interdiction problems have been studied in the literature, where the follower’s problem is a standard graph optimization problem, and the leader can remove edges or vertices to minimize the follower’s optimal objective value on the graph after edge-removal or vertex-removal. On planar graphs, polynomial time approximation schemes (PTASs) were obtained for network flow interdiction  and matching interdiction . On general graphs, approximation algorithms were also obtained for, e.g., connectivity interdiction 8, minimum spanning tree interdiction , matching interdiction 4, network flow interdiction [ref]8  , etc. All of these algorithms crucially rely on the follower’s specific graph optimization problem and do not apply directly to IPC. The main contribution of this paper is an (sB+ϵ)subscript𝑠𝐵italic-ϵ(s_{B}+\\epsilon)-approximation polynomial time algorithm for IPC when sAsubscript𝑠𝐴s_{A} and sBsubscript𝑠𝐵s_{B} are both constant. In particular, when sB=1subscript𝑠𝐵1s_{B}=1, our algorithm is a PTAS. Since the knapsack interdiction problem is a special case of IPC when sA=sB=1subscript𝑠𝐴subscript𝑠𝐵1s_{A}=s_{B}=1, our result gives the first 𝒪​(1)𝒪1{\\mathcal{O}}(1)-approximation algorithm for this problem. To complement our result, we also show that IPC does not admit any (4/3−ϵ)43italic-ϵ({4}/{3}-\\epsilon)-approximation algorithm even if sB=2subscript𝑠𝐵2s_{B}=2 and sA=1subscript𝑠𝐴1s_{A}=1, assuming P≠N​P𝑃𝑁𝑃P\\neq NP. This implies that the PTAS for sB=1subscript𝑠𝐵1s_{B}=1 cannot be further extended to the case of sB≥2subscript𝑠𝐵2s_{B}\\geq 2. We also consider a natural variant of IPC where the leader’s budget can be violated. For this variant we obtain a (ρ1−α,1α)𝜌1𝛼1𝛼(\\frac{\\rho}{1-\\alpha},\\frac{1}{\\alpha})-bicriteria approximation algorithm for any α∈(0,1)𝛼01\\alpha\\in(0,1), which runs in polynomial time when sAsubscript𝑠𝐴s_{A} and sBsubscript𝑠𝐵s_{B} are arbitrary (not necessarily polynomial in the input size). More precisely, the algorithm takes as input two oracles, a ρ𝜌\\rho-approximation algorithm to the follower’s optimization problem max⁡{𝐩𝐲:𝐁𝐲≤𝐛,𝐲∈{0,1}n}:𝐩𝐲formulae-sequence𝐁𝐲𝐛𝐲superscript01𝑛\\max\\{{\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf p$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf p$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf p$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf p$}}}{\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf y$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf y$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf y$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf y$}}}:\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf B$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf B$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf B$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf B$}}{\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf y$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf y$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf y$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf y$}}}\\leq{\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf b$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf b$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf b$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf b$}}},{\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf y$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf y$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf y$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf y$}}}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\}; and a separation oracle for the leader’s problem that given any 𝐱=𝐱0𝐱superscript𝐱0{\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf x$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf x$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf x$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf x$}}}={\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf x$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf x$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf x$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf x$}}}^{0}, it either asserts that 𝐀𝐱0≤𝐚superscript𝐀𝐱0𝐚\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf A$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf A$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf A$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf A$}}{\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf x$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf x$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf x$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf x$}}}^{0}\\leq{\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf a$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf a$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf a$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf a$}}} or returns a violating constraint. Then in polynomial oracle time the algorithm returns a solution 𝐱∗superscript𝐱{\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf x$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf x$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf x$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf x$}}}^{*} for the leader such that 𝐀𝐱∗≤1α​𝐚superscript𝐀𝐱1𝛼𝐚\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf A$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf A$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf A$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf A$}}{\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf x$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf x$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf x$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf x$}}}^{*}\\leq\\frac{1}{\\alpha}{\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf a$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf a$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf a$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf a$}}}, and the objective value is at most ρ​T∗1−α𝜌superscript𝑇1𝛼\\frac{\\rho T^{*}}{1-\\alpha}, where T∗superscript𝑇T^{*} is the optimal objective value with the leader’s budget being 𝐚𝐚\\textstyle\\bf a. When we take, e.g., α=1/2𝛼12\\alpha=1/2, we achieve an objective of 2​ρ​T∗2𝜌superscript𝑇2\\rho T^{*} with the leader’s budget augmented to 2​𝐚2𝐚2{\\mathchoice{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\displaystyle\\bf a$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\textstyle\\bf a$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\bf a$}}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\scriptscriptstyle\\bf a$}}}. In terms of techniques, our main contribution is a general method for bilevel optimization problems where the leader’s and follower’s decision variables are both integral. Most prior works on bilevel optimization require follower’s decision variables to take fractional values, which accommodates the application of LP duality to transform the bilevel optimization problem to a standard (single level) optimization, and are thus inapplicable when the follower’s decision variables become integral. A common technique used in many single level optimization problems is to first classify items into large and small based on whether they can make a significant contribution to the objective value, then guess out large items via enumeration, and handle small items fractionally via LP (see, e.g.,   . However, such a technique encounters a fundamental challenge in IPC: we can guess out all large items selected by the leader, however, the follower may still select arbitrarily from the remaining large items. In other word, the follower’s choice on large items can never be guessed out, and therefore we cannot apply duality to the follower’s problem. We overcome the challenge based on the following two ideas: First, we show that given leader’s choice on large items, there is a fixed number of ”dominant choices” such that the follower’s choice on remaining large items always belong to the dominant choices. Second, we show that there exists a subset of ”critical items” such that the follower’s choice on small items can be characterized through linear constraints given that these critical items are known. The two observations allow us to transform the bilevel program for IPC to an LP without utilizing duality. The characterization of dominant choices and critical items become sophisticated in the general case when sBsubscript𝑠𝐵s_{B} is an arbitrary constant, but is much simpler in the special case sB=1subscript𝑠𝐵1s_{B}=1. Hence, for ease of presentation, in the main part we present our algorithm for the special case to give an overview on the technical insights, and meanwhile provide a proof sketch towards generalizing the algorithm for the general case. Our techniques may be of separate interest to other bilevel optimization problems. Our IPC problem lies generally in the area of bilevel optimization, which has received extensive research in the literature. Jeroslow  showed that in general, bilevel optimization problems are NP-hard even when the objectives and the constraints are linear. We refer readers to Colson et al. 0 for a comprehensive survey on bilevel optimization. Within the area of bilevel optimization, Mixed-Integer Bilevel Linear Problem (MIBLP) is related to our IPC. MIBLP is a bilevel optimization problem where the objective functions and the constraints for the leader and follower are both linear. MIBLP has been studied extensively in the literature, see, e.g., 5 9 8. We also refer the reader to 7 for an overview on MIBLP solvers and related applications. Most of these algorithmic results are for finding exact solutions through, e.g., branch and bound based approach. For DeNegre’s knapsack interdiction problem, an improved exact algorithm was derived by Federico Della Croce and Rosario Scatamacchia 1. It is worth mentioning that besides DeNegre’s knapsack interdiction problem (i.e., sA=sB=1subscript𝑠𝐴subscript𝑠𝐵1s_{A}=s_{B}=1 in IPC), other variants of bilevel knapsack problems have also been studied in which the leader interferes the follower’s program in a different way. One kind of bilevel knapsack problem was introduced by Dempe and Richter 2 where two players hold one knapsack, the leader determines the knapsack’s capacity while the follower picks items into the knapsack to maximize his own total profit. The goal is to maximize the objective of the leader. Brotcorne et al.  gave a dynamic programming algorithm for both cases of this model. Chen and Zhang [ref]7 proposed a bilevel knapsack variant where two players hold their own knapsacks and the leader can only influence the profit of the items. The follower is interested in his own revenue while the leader aims at maximizing the total profit of both players. The improved approximation results for this problem were derived by Xian Qiu and Walter Kern 4. Another bilevel knapsack variant occurred in the work of Pferschy et al. 0 where the leader controls the weights of a subset of the follower’s items and the follower aims at maximizing his own profit. The leader’s payoff is the total weight of the items he controls and selected by the follower. Very recently, Pferschy et al.1 tackled a “symmetrical” problem in which the leader can control the profits instead of item weights. In addition to these works, a matrix interdiction problem was studied by Kasiviswanathan and Pan 4. It is also worth mentioning that the continuous version of DeNegre’s knapsack interdiction problem, where the leader and the follower can both fractionally choose an item, has also been studied in recent years. Carvalho et al.  gave the first polynomial time optimal algorithm. Later on, a faster optimal algorithm was proposed by Woeginger and Fischer 6.
