    "i-b related work": "We review some of the related work in the context of\nbi-level optimization, compositional optimization, and projection-free algorithms. Bi-level optimization has had a long history, with the earliest applications in economic game theory . Bi-level optimization has recently received great attention from the machine learning community due to the number of applications in the area . A series of works that proposed to solve the problem of the form (1) has appeared recently [ref]7  [ref]19 [ref]9   . Of these, the seminal works in [ref]7  proposed a class of double-loop approximation algorithms to iteratively approximate the stochastic gradient of the outer objective and incurred a sample complexity of 𝒪​(ϵ−2)𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2}) in order to achieve the ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-stationary point. The double loop structure of these approaches made them impractical for large-scale problems; [ref]7 required solving an inner optimization problem to a predefined accuracy, while  required a large batch size of 𝒪​(ϵ−1)𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ1\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-1}) at each iteration. To address this issue, various single-loop methods, involving simultaneous update of inner and outer optimization variables, have been developed [ref]19 [ref]9  . A single-loop two-time scale stochastic algorithm proposed in [ref]19 incurred a sub-optimal sample complexity of 𝒪​(ϵ−2.5)𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ2.5\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2.5}). This is further improved recently in [ref]9  , in which the authors have utilized the momentum-based variance reduction technique from  to obtain optimal convergence rates. While all of the above-mentioned works seek to solve (1), they are projection-based and require a projection on to 𝒳𝒳{{\\mathcal{X}}} at every iteration. In this work, we are interested in developing projection-free stochastic optimization algorithms for bi-level problems, which is still an open problem and the subject of the work in this paper. Compositional optimization problems have been recently studied and various algorithms have been proposed in       . The seminal work in  proposed a quasi-gradient method called stochastic compositional gradient descent (CGD) to solve the problem via a two time-scale approach. In , the authors proposed an accelerated SCGD method that achieved an improved sample complexity of 𝒪​(ϵ−2)𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2}) for convex objectives and 𝒪​(ϵ−2.25)𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ2.25\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2.25}) for non-convex objectives. Further, different variance-reduced SCGD variants have been proposed, such as SCVR , VRSC-PG , SARAH-Compositional  , and STORM-Compositional . In the literature, we can also find some single time-scale algorithms to solve compositional problems  . Work in  presented a nested averaged stochastic approximation (NASA) and proved a sample complexity of 𝒪​(ϵ−2)𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2}). Recently, another single time-scale algorithm called the stochastically corrected stochastic compositional gradient method (SCSC) is proposed in  that converges at the same rate as the SGD methods for non-compositional stochastic optimization. It further adopted the Adam-type adaptive gradient approach and achieved the optimal sample complexity of 𝒪​(ϵ−2)𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2}). Again, all the above-mentioned algorithms either solve an unconstrained problem or use projection operation at each iteration to deal with the constraints. In this work, we developed a projection-free algorithm for compositional problems as well. Note that even-though compositional problems are a special case of bi-level problems, we have studied them separately in this work and proposed a novel projection-free algorithm specifically for compositional problems to achieve the optimal sample complexity. Projection-free algorithms have been extensively studied to solve the single-level optimization problems of the form (1) in the literature   . A number of first-order projection-free algorithms have been developed for stochastic optimization problems as well     . The stochastic FW method proposed in  achieves a sample complexity of 𝒪​(ϵ−3)𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ3\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3}) but requires an the batch size b=𝒪​(t)𝑏𝒪𝑡b=\\mathcal{O}(t), where t𝑡t is the iteration index. The need for increasing batch sizes was dropped in , which worked with a standard mini-batch but still achieved the same sample complexity. Finally, an improved stochastic recursive gradient estimator-based algorithm called ORGFW was proposed in  and achieved a sample complexity of 𝒪​(ϵ−2)𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2}). For non-convex problems,  proposed an approach where the batch-size depends on the total number of iterations, resulting in a sample complexity of 𝒪​(ϵ−4)𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ4\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-4}). Later, work in  came up with a two-sample strategy and achieved 𝒪​(ϵ−3)𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ3\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3}) sample complexity. We remark that the idea of projection-free algorithms is limited only to single-level optimization problems in the existing literature. Therefore, there are no corresponding oracle complexity bounds for projection-free algorithms in bilevel settings, and our work fills this crucial gap. We present our main contributions as follows."
