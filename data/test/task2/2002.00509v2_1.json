  "sections": {
    "introduction": "Several reviews have been written about machine consciousness   [ref]25 that\ntry to sum up all the ideas that literature has proposed about the potential arisal of consciousness in machines . These ideas come from different areas such as artificial intelligence , neuroscience  or philosophy . Although consciousness can not be measured directly, there exist approaches that have provided potential measures of consciousness in machines  9. Although the field generates controversy  as it lies in the margin of the scientific method, it has recently attracted the attention of relevant researchers of computer science such as Yoshua Bengio, who has provided an approach for how machine consciousness may arise with deep learning . As deep learning 0 has generated machines that implement attention mechanisms , a new focus have emerged with the field of machine consciousness based in the astonishing hypothesis  that our intelligence and consciousness may arise from very simple principles. Computational approaches for machine consciousness are based in the functionalism theory of consciousness . This theory claims that while mental states correspond to brain states, they are mental states due to their functionality, not due to their physical composition. Hence, consciousness may appear in machines that implement behaviors observed in humans that are correlated with consciousness. Throughout the recent years, there has been amazing advances in the artificial intelligence and machine learning community 5 that does not only include deep learning models. In the machine consciousness literature, it has been hypothesized that consciousness, or phenomenal states 1, may arise from machines that are able to perform tasks that humans are able to do when they are conscious  [ref]25. This is based in the hypothesis that if humans are conscious when producing complex behaviours, then, machines may be conscious when they produce them too . We know, and have measured, that humans are conscious when performing these behaviours thanks to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and related techniques [ref]34 . These behaviours can include imagination , emotions [ref]55, language communication and social relations  or awareness of the environment . Machine learning recent models are able to generate art  that deviate from what they are fed to learn, are able to learn how to learn , learn from a few examples  and are able to transfer knowledge from a different task to behave better in a new one . The applications of these abilities include natural language generation , understanding emotions  or generating videos . We believe that if the philosophical theory that consciousness arises as a flux of information in any machine  is true, if we create a cognitive architecture  that is able to produce as many behaviours as possible that are correlated with consciousness in humans, then, the machine may as well arise, up to some extent, consciousness or phenomenal states. We attempt to provide a bridge between the machine learning and the machine consciousness communities by providing the design of a cognitive architecture with machine consciousness behaviours through machine learning models. Several architectures have been proposed before  but none of them include both deep learning, generative processes and gaussian processes to generate interior cognitive processes and exterior behaviour and content. Section 2 will discuss related work. Then, in Section 3, we provide a detailed explanation of the modules of our architecture. Section 4 then provides the architecture that unifies these modules. We conclude our work with a section of conclusions and further work."
