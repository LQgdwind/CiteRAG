    "ii related work": "Recent years have shown huge progress in representation learning for graph-based data with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [ref]25 [ref]18  . GNNs follow a message passing scheme, where node feature vectors aggregate information from their neighbors  and capture local structural information.\nTo obtain a graph-level representation these\nfeature vectors are pooled .\nGNNs differ in their neighborhood node information as well as in their graph-level aggregation procedure   [ref]18 [ref]25   .\nGraph generation can be addressed globally by relaxing the adjacency matrix   or sequentially by adding nodes and edges alternately using recurrent networks   or GNNs [ref]38. Our decoder model is similar to [ref]38 in the aggregation procedure. Yet, while [ref]38 treat forward and backward pass equally, our model aggregates node information for both separately to account for the order of network operations and the information flow. Zhang et al.  propose a less efficient, alternating message passing scheme for this purpose and reinstall the validity of decoded architectures using a heuristic which employs prior knowledge on the search space. The proposed method differs in both encoder and decoder. Our encoder employs an efficient bi-directional model and the proposed bi-directional decoding facilitates highly accurate reconstructions without constraining the search space. Predicting the performance of neural networks based on features such as the network architecture, training hyperparameters or learning curves has been exploited previously via MCMC methods , Bayesian neural networks  or regression models .  and  manually construct features to regress neural networks or support vector regressors. More recent work utilizes GNN encodings by adapting message passing to simulate operations in either edges or nodes in the graph  or using a semi-supervised approach by training GNNs on relation graphs in the latent space .  train a GNN surrogate performance prediction model and show the ability of zero-shot performance prediction. To apply Bayesian Optimization (BO) for NAS, high dimensional and discrete architecture configurations need to be embedded into continuous search spaces.  use a distance metric obtained through an optimal transport program to enable Gaussian process (GP)-based BO.  encode architectures with a high-dimensional path-based scheme and employ BO on an ensemble surrogate.  propose a graph kernel with GP-based BO to capture the topological structure of architecture graphs. GNN-based encodings have been used in   to fit a Bayesian linear regressor as a surrogate in BO.\nVery recently, Yan et al.  learn neural architecture representations using  in combination with a multilayer perceptron graph decoder. The model employs a combination of the adjacency matrix and a one-hot operation encoding matrix as input for the encoder and improves over previous approaches to NAS though. Their results indicate that highly informed encoding is crucial for the task.\n\nOur model focuses on learning an accurate architecture mapping into a smooth latent space using GNNs. It allows competitive performance to highly optimized approaches using BO . Due to its smoothness, it can further directly extrapolate the performance prediction outside the space of seen architectures and thus to propose high-performing, deeper networks without using BO."
