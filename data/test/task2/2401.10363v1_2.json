    "the notion of strongk𝐾k-step opacity": "In , the authors proposed a notion of strong K𝐾K-step opacity (K𝐾K-SSO) for a DFA G𝐺G to overcome the limitation that the notion of standard K𝐾K-SO is not sufficiently strong (i.e., the standard K𝐾K-SO cannot guarantee that the visit of a secret state cannot be inferred within the last K𝐾K observable steps).\nNow we generalize the definition of K𝐾K-SSO proposed in  in nondeterministic finite-state automata (NFAs). Given a system G=(X,Σ,δ,X0)𝐺𝑋Σ𝛿subscript𝑋0G=(X,\\Sigma,\\delta,X_{0}), a projection map P𝑃P w.r.t. a set ΣosubscriptΣ𝑜\\Sigma_{o} of observable events, a set XS⊆Xsubscript𝑋𝑆𝑋X_{S}\\subseteq X of secret states, and a non-negative integer K𝐾K,\nG𝐺G is said to be strongly K𝐾K-step opaque (K𝐾K-SSO)333In this paper, the terminology “K𝐾K-SSO” is the acronym of both “strong K𝐾K-step opacity” and “strongly K𝐾K-step opaque”, which depends on the context. w.r.t.

In plain words, K𝐾K-SSO in Definition 1 implies that in the last at most K𝐾K observable steps, an intruder cannot make sure whether some secret states have been visited.\nNote that, the notion of K𝐾K-SSO studied in [ref]46 is equivalent to Definition 1 when system G𝐺G is deterministic.\nCurrently, the most efficient verification algorithm for K𝐾K-SSO in Definition 1 has been designed in our previous work [ref]17. Recently, in  we proposed another type of K𝐾K-SSO notion (see Definition 2.25 therein), which can be regarded as strengthening of SCSO notion (see Definition 5 below).\nNow we recall the notion of K𝐾K-SSO formulated by Definition 2.25 in . Given a system G=(X,Σ,δ,X0)𝐺𝑋Σ𝛿subscript𝑋0G=(X,\\Sigma,\\delta,X_{0}), a projection map P𝑃P w.r.t. a set ΣosubscriptΣ𝑜\\Sigma_{o} of observable events, a set XS⊆Xsubscript𝑋𝑆𝑋X_{S}\\subseteq X of secret states, and a non-negative integer K𝐾K,\nG𝐺G is said to be strongly K𝐾K-step opaque (K𝐾K-SSO) w.r.t. ΣosubscriptΣ𝑜\\Sigma_{o} and XSsubscript𝑋𝑆X_{S} if By Definitions 2 and 5, it is not difficult to see that K𝐾K-SSO in Definition 2 reduces to SCSO in Definition 5 when string t=ϵ𝑡italic-ϵt=\\epsilon.\nFurther, K𝐾K-SSO in Definition 2 can be directly checked using our concurrent-composition structure presented in , see the Theorem 2.152.152.15 of  for details. Next, in this subsection we propose another new notion of K𝐾K-SSO, which is weaker than both two notions of K𝐾K-SSO proposed in  and  but stronger than standard K𝐾K-SO. Given a system G=(X,Σ,δ,X0)𝐺𝑋Σ𝛿subscript𝑋0G=(X,\\Sigma,\\delta,X_{0}), a projection map P𝑃P w.r.t. a set ΣosubscriptΣ𝑜\\Sigma_{o} of observable events, a set XS⊆Xsubscript𝑋𝑆𝑋X_{S}\\subseteq X of secret states, and a non-negative integer K𝐾K,\nG𝐺G is said to be strongly K𝐾K-step opaque (K𝐾K-SSO) w.r.t. ΣosubscriptΣ𝑜\\Sigma_{o} and XSsubscript𝑋𝑆X_{S} if 1) For K𝐾K-SSO in Definition 3, if no such a run x0′→s1′x1′→s2′x2′superscript→superscriptsubscript𝑠1′superscriptsubscript𝑥0′superscriptsubscript𝑥1′superscript→superscriptsubscript𝑠2′superscriptsubscript𝑥2′x_{0}^{\\prime}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle s_{1}^{\\prime}}}{{\\rightarrow}}{x_{1}^{\\prime}}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle s_{2}^{\\prime}}}{{\\rightarrow}}{x_{2}^{\\prime}} exists,\nwe call x0→s1x1→s2x2superscript→subscript𝑠1subscript𝑥0subscript𝑥1superscript→subscript𝑠2subscript𝑥2x_{0}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle s_{1}}}{{\\rightarrow}}x_{1}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle s_{2}}}{{\\rightarrow}}x_{2} a leaking-secret run.\nSimilarly, we also define a leaking-secret run for other notions of opacity. 2) If a system G𝐺G is K𝐾K-SSO in Definition 3, then an intruder cannot be sure whether the system is/was in a secret state within the last K𝐾K observable steps.\nWe compare these aforementioned three notions of K𝐾K-SSO.\nFrom their definitions, we conclude readily that: 1) K𝐾K-SSO in Definition 2 implies K𝐾K-SSO in Definition 1, but the converse is not true; 2) K𝐾K-SSO in Definition 1 implies K𝐾K-SSO in Definition 3, but the converse is also not true.\nHowever, these three notions of K𝐾K-SSO are obviously stronger than the standard K𝐾K-SO proposed in ."
