    "ii-c citation bias detection methods and their limitations": "Research on citation bias usually follows a similar workflow of data collection, data pre-processing, and statistical analysis. \nData Collection: there are three main types of approaches to data collection: Collect metadata on papers from top journals; this approach is popular in research which focuses on a single field (e.g.,    ). Collect metadata on a large set of papers from a variety of journals; this is an approach used for research interested in global citation patterns (e.g.,  [ref]1). Collect papers based on a research topic; Duyx et al. , followed that approach that allows them to compile all papers which report on the association between article results and citation frequency. Data Pre-processing: This usually allows labelling authors and authors cited within each paper based on some interest criteria i.e attributes. Studies on gender bias used databases such as the US Census, Wikipedia, and Social Security Administration to match names to gender   [ref]1   . Bertolero et al.  assigned race using probabilistic databases and neural networks trained on American Voter and Census data. Geographic bias studies such as the one of Gomez et al.  extracted author location information. Duyx et al.  extracted information from the papers content, which included information such as the number of positive articles, the number of negative articles, the number of citations to positive articles, and the number of citations to negative articles. Note that, at this stage, the removal of self-citations from reference lists is common practice      .\n\nStatistical Analysis: Several studies (e.g.,    ) on citation analysis used/adapted Dworkin et al. ’s statistical approach. Thus, most of them created a model to determine expected citation rate by gender/race and compared them to actual rates to identify any citation biases. Gomez et al.  analyzed global citation behaviour using a three-layer network (citation, text similarity, and distortion) to understand how countries cite each other and the similarities between their research topics. Duyx et al.  examined the relationship between citation frequency and the statistical significance, direction, hypothesis conformity, and authors’ conclusions of the article results.\n\nLimitations: Studies which extract data from top journals must be careful with generalizing bias within the field as a whole   . Dworkin et al.  state that they did not account for authors’ institutional prestige, potentially introducing bias due to gender imbalance in hiring and prestige-based citation behaviour. Gender-based papers such as Dworkin et al.  caution that gender determination methods are binary, excluding intersex, transgender, and non-binary identities. Bertolero et al.  investigated race bias, which is limited by probabilistic racial and ethnic identity analyses based on limited racial categories and outdated census data that may inaccurately assign categories. Furthermore, Gomez et al.  acknowledge that their citational lensing framework is limited in accuracy as the textual similarity between countries is inherently noisy, which impacts comparisons with citation data. Duyx et al. ’s meta-study on result-biased citations acknowledges the need for caution in making broad conclusions about citation bias across all sciences due to the high heterogeneity in their analyses."
