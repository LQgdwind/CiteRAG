  "sections": {
    "v experiments": "We validate our proposed attention operators as part of the PredNet¬†0 architecture on real-world data.\nThe PredNet architecture was selected for direct comparison with prior environment prediction work¬†. We use the relative learned positional encoding defined by [ref]19 in the attention calculation (Eq.¬†2). Our experiments demonstrate that the TAAConvLSTM and SAAConvLSTM mechanisms significantly reduce the vanishing of moving objects, improve static environment prediction, and outperform other state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence prediction architectures, specifically PredNet¬†0, PredRNN++¬†1, and CDNA¬†2.\nThe TAAConvLSTM is further examined in an ablation study where we investigate how each head of the temporal attention in the proposed TAAConv mechanism affects the predictions. Input Ground truth TAAConvLSTM SAAConvLSTM PredNet PredRNN++ CDNA Experimental Setup: We evaluate the capabilities of our proposed methods to make effective long-term predictions and compare them with other state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence video prediction architectures on the real-world KITTI dataset¬†3 and the Waymo Open Dataset¬†4. Train-validation-test splits for the datasets are 0.9-0.02-0.08 and 0.75-0.10-0.15, respectively. In all experiments, we follow the procedure defined by , where we provide 5 past DST occupancy grids (0.5¬†stimes0.5second0.5\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{s}) sequentially as input and make predictions for 15 future frames accounting for 1.5¬†stimes1.5second1.5\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{s} into the future. We consider occupancy grids of dimension H√óW=128√ó128ùêªùëä128128H\\times W=128\\times 128, corresponding to 42.7¬†mtimes42.7meter42.7\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m} √ó\\times 42.7¬†mtimes42.7meter42.7\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m} with a 0.3¬Ø¬†mtimesformulae-sequence0¬Ø3meter0.\\overline{3}\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m} resolution. All our models were trained using the PyTorch¬† library with the Adam¬† optimizer. Models were optimized for 200 epochs with 500 samples per epoch on an Nvidia RTX 2080Ti. We used the training procedure for multiple time step prediction defined by¬†0 that optimizes the L‚Äã1ùêø1L1 loss. We consider a four-layer PredNet architecture with TAAConvLSTM and SAAConvLSTM implemented in the top one and two layers, respectively. We selected the layers to place our mechanism from the top of the architecture, where the representation has the smallest size, until memory limitations were reached. All baselines were scaled in size to enable fair comparison between models. Evaluation Metrics: We validate our prediction results using the traditional Mean Square Error (MSE) metric. However, evaluating the environment prediction task is challenging due to its multimodal output. Unobserved latent variables, such as intent, influence human decisions resulting in a multimodal future. Hence, we also consider the Image Similarity (IS) metric¬†. IS calculates the smallest Manhattan distance between two grid cells with the same occupancy class assignment (free, occupied, and unknown). Thus, contrary to the MSE metric, which focuses on exact precision, IS successfully captures the variability in object positions between the ground truth and the predicted occupancy grids in the calculation of the score. Additionally, we construct a Moving Object Bounding Box Metric (MOBBM) to validate the reduced vanishing of moving objects over time. MOBBM evaluates the ratio of occupied cells present inside a vehicle‚Äôs ground truth bounding box between the predicted and target frames for each time step."
