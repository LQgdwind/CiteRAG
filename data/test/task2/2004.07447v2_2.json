    "introduction": "In the metric distortion problem, we are given two finite (potentially non-disjoint) sets V𝑉V and C𝐶C that lie in the same metric space. If we had access to the distance metric d𝑑d over V∪C𝑉𝐶V\\cup C, we could compute a point c∗∈Csuperscript𝑐𝐶c^{*}\\in C that minimizes its total distance to the points in V𝑉V, i.e., c∗∈arg​minc∈C​∑i∈Vd​(i,c)superscript𝑐subscriptargmin𝑐𝐶subscript𝑖𝑉𝑑𝑖𝑐c^{*}\\in\\operatorname*{arg\\,min}_{c\\in C}\\sum_{i\\in V}d(i,c). However, rather than having access to the exact distances, we are given, for each point i∈V𝑖𝑉i\\in V, a ranking σisubscript𝜎𝑖\\sigma_{i} over the points in C𝐶C by their distance to i𝑖i (with ties broken arbitrarily). Given only this collection of rankings σ=(σi)i∈V𝜎subscriptsubscript𝜎𝑖𝑖𝑉\\sigma=(\\sigma_{i})_{i\\in V}, we need to design an algorithm (a social choice rule) that picks a point c^∈C^𝑐𝐶\\widehat{c}\\in C (possibly in a randomized fashion), and we are interested in its worst-case approximation ratio 𝔼[∑i∈Vd​(i,c^)]/∑i∈Vd​(i,c∗)𝔼delimited-[]subscript𝑖𝑉𝑑𝑖^𝑐subscript𝑖𝑉𝑑𝑖superscript𝑐\\mathop{\\mathbb{E}}[\\sum_{i\\in V}d(i,\\widehat{c})]/\\sum_{i\\in V}d(i,c^{*}), where the expectation is over randomization of the algorithm. This worst-case approximation ratio is known as the distortion of the algorithm in this framework. Note that the need for approximation stems not from computational constraints, but from the lack of full information. Our main question is: To what extent can we minimize the total distance using only ordinal information regarding pairwise distances? An interesting motivating example for this question stems from voting theory, where V𝑉V is a set of voters, C𝐶C is a set of candidates, and the distance between voters and candidates corresponds to the distance of their ideologies with respect to different issues. This model, inspired by spatial models of voting from the political science literature, such as the Downsian proximity model [ref]26, has recently become popular in the computer science literature   [ref]44. An alternative, possibly more concrete, interpretation of these distances can also be derived through the well-studied problem of facility location [ref]21  . In this case V𝑉V corresponds to a set of customers and C𝐶C is the set of feasible locations for a new facility to be opened; the distance measure between customers and locations could correspond to the actual physical distance between them, or the time or cost required for a customer to reach each location. In both cases, the most common way to elicit the preferences of the voters, or customers, is in the form of a ranking of the available options (e.g., see [15, Part I] or ), and the goal is to pick an outcome that minimizes the total distance. Centuries of research on voting theory has produced a plethora of voting rules that choose an outcome using the ranked preferences of voters as input. In recent work, starting with Anshelevich et al. , researchers have analyzed the performance of these voting rules using the metric distortion framework described above, which enables a quantitative comparison among them.\nAnshelevich et al.  showed that no deterministic algorithm\ncan achieve a distortion better than 333, while a popular voting rule known as Copeland’s rule comes close, by achieving distortion 555. Informally, Copeland’s rule measures the strength of each candidate c𝑐c as the number of candidates c′superscript𝑐′c^{\\prime} defeated by c𝑐c in a pairwise election (i.e., the candidates c′superscript𝑐′c^{\\prime} that are ranked below c𝑐c by the majority of voters), and picks a candidate with the greatest strength. They also analyzed the distortion of other popular voting rules such as plurality, Borda count, k𝑘k-approval, and veto, and showed that their distortion increases linearly with the number of voters or candidates.\nSubsequently, Skowron and Elkind  analyzed another popular voting rule, known as single transferable vote (STV), and showed that its distortion grows logarithmically in the number of candidates. The first deterministic algorithm to break the bound of 555 was very recently proposed by Munagala and Wang [ref]44, who designed a novel deterministic algorithm that achieves a distortion of 2+5≈4.236254.2362+\\sqrt{5}\\approx 4.236. Their algorithm does not even require access to voters’ full ordinal preferences. It takes as input only the weighted tournament graph, which contains, for every pair of candidates, the number of voters that prefer one over another. They proved that 2+5252+\\sqrt{5} is the best distortion of any deterministic algorithm with this limited input, and they conjectured that with full ordinal preferences, the best possible distortion should be 333, outlining a sufficient condition for achieving distortion 333. However, they were unable to prove that there always exists a candidate satisfying their sufficient condition.\nIndependently, Kempe  derived the same bound of 2+5252+\\sqrt{5} using a linear programming duality framework, and provided several alternative formulations of the sufficient condition outlined by Munagala and Wang [ref]44. He used the linear programming duality framework to show that the distortion of two social choice rules, the ranked pairs and Schulze’s rule, grows as the square root of the number of candidates, thus disproving a conjecture by Anshelevich et al.  that ranked pairs might have distortion 333 (this conjecture was also earlier disproved by Goel et al. ).\nThe main result of our paper is a culmination of this line of work in the form of a novel deterministic algorithm that guarantees the optimal distortion of 3."
