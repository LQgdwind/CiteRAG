  "sections": {
    "models": "Existing VL-NLE models follow a common high-level structure (Figure 3). First, a VL model learns a joint representation of the image and language inputs and predicts the answer. The models in this work then condition their explanation on different combinations of the question, image, their joint representation, and the answer. Details on PJ-X¬†, FME¬†[ref]46, and RVT¬†[ref]34 are given in Appendix¬†C, as well as in their respective papers. Marasoviƒá et¬†al. [ref]34 generate convincing explanations, but out of various MTsubscriptùëÄùëáM_{T} modules tested, including complex visual reasoning models, it obtains the best explanation accuracy when using object labels as the sole image information. We address this limitation by proposing e-UG, a model that enables a stronger image conditioning by combining GPT-2 with UNITER¬†[ref]15, a powerful transformer-based VL model.\nThe outputs of UNITER are contextualized embeddings of the word tokens and image regions in the image-text pair. Words are embedded by tokenizing them into WordPieces and adding their position embedding. Images are embedded by extracting visual features of regions with Faster R-CNN  and encoding their location features. UNITER achieves SOTA on many downstream tasks when fine-tuned on them. For e-UG, we leverage these contextualized embeddings to condition GPT-2 on an efficient representation of the image and question. The embeddings of the image regions and question words are simply prepended to the textual question and predicted answer, and then fed to GPT-2. GPT-2 is a decoder-only architecture that is pre-trained on conventional language modeling and therefore well-suited for language generation¬†. We follow Marasoviƒá et¬†al. [ref]34 and do greedy decoding during inference."
