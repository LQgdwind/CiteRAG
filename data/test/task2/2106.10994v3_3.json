    "related work": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) can be broadly divided into spectral-based GNNs and spatial-based GNNs [ref]33. Spectral-based GNNs design spectral graph filters in the spectral domain.\nChebNet  uses Chebyshev polynomial to approximate a filter.\nGCN 3 simplifies the Chebyshev filter with the first-order approximation.\nGraphHeat [ref]34 uses heat kernel to design a graph filter.\nAPPNP  utilizes Personalized PageRank (PPR) to set the filter weights.\nGPR-GNN  learns the polynomial filters via gradient descent on the polynomial coefficients.\nARMA  learns a rational filter via the family of Auto-Regressive Moving Average filters 1.\nAdaGNN  learns simple filters across multiple layers with a single parameter for each feature channel at each layer.\nAs aforementioned, these methods mainly focus on designing low- or high-pass filters or learning filters without any constraints, which may lead to misspecified even ill-posed filters. On the other hand, spatial-based GNNs directly propagate and aggregate graph information in the spatial domain.\nFrom this perspective, GCN 3 can be explained as the aggregation of the one-hop neighbor information on the graph.\nGAT  uses the attention mechanism to learn aggregation weights.\nRecently, Balcilar et al.  bridge the gap between spectral-based and spatial-based GNNs and unify GNNs in the same framework.\nTheir work shows that the GNNs can be interpreted as sophisticated data-driven filters.\nThis motivates the design of the proposed BernNet, which can learn arbitrary non-negative spectral filters from real-world graph signals."
