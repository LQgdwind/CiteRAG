    "paraphrasing attacks on non-watermarked ai-generated texts": "Non-watermarking detectors such as trained classifiers [ref]3, retrieval-based detectors [ref]4, and zero-shot classifiers  4 3 2 use the presence of LLM-specific signatures in AI-generated texts for their detection.\nNeural network-based trained detectors such as RoBERTa-Large-Detector from OpenAI [ref]3 are trained or fine-tuned for binary classification with datasets containing human and AI-generated texts. Zero-shot classifiers leverage specific statistical properties of the source LLM outputs for their detection. Retrieval-based methods search for a candidate passage in a database that stores the LLM outputs. Here, we perform experiments on these non-watermarking detectors to show they are vulnerable to our paraphrasing attack. We use a pre-trained GPT-2 Medium\nmodel  with 355M parameters to evaluate our attack on 200 passages from the XSum dataset . We use a T5-based paraphrasing model  with 222M parameters to rephrase the output texts from the target GPT-2 Medium model. Figure 4 shows the effectiveness of the paraphrasing attack over these detectors. The AUROC scores of DetectGPT  drop from 96.5%percent96.596.5\\% (before the attack) to 59.8%percent59.859.8\\% (after the attack). Note that AUROC of 50%percent5050\\% corresponds to a random detector. The rest of the zero-shot detectors 2 4 3 also perform poorly after our attack. Though the performance of the trained neural network-based detectors [ref]3 is better than that of zero-shot detectors, they are also not reliable. For example, the true positive rate of OpenAI‚Äôs RoBERTa-Large-Detector drops from 100%percent100100\\% to around 80%percent8080\\% after our attack at a practical false positive rate of 1%percent11\\%. With multiple queries to the detector, an adversary can paraphrase more efficiently to bring down the true positive rate of the RoBERTa-Large-Detector to 60%percent6060\\%.\nTable 4 shows an example of outputs from the GPT-2 model before and after paraphrasing.\nThe output of the paraphraser reads well and means the same as the detected GPT-2 text. We measure the perplexities of the GPT-2 output text before the attack, after the paraphrase attack, and after multiple query paraphrase attack to be 16.3, 27.2, and 18.3, respectively. We also examine the effectiveness of recursive paraphrasing on these detectors. Here we use the DIPPER paraphraser i times recursively (ppi) to generate i paraphrases of the GPT-2 generated text. We select the paraphrased text with the worst detection score out of the i paraphrased versions assuming black-box access to the detector. We present the ROC curves in Figure 5. We observe a substantial decline in the AUROC values for all the detectors, highlighting the fragility of these detection methods with recursive paraphrasing.\nFor instance, the AUROC curve values drops from ùüñùüê%percent82\\mathbf{82\\%} to ùüèùüñ%percent18\\mathbf{18\\%} for DetectGPT  after attack."
