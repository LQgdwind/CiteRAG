  "title": "BenchTemp: A General Benchmark for Evaluating Temporal Graph Neural Networks",
  "sections": {
    "introduction": "Temporal graphs provide a natural abstraction for many real-world systems, in which the topology structure and node/edge attributes change over time.\nOften, a temporal graph can be modeled as an interaction stream, and it is critical to capture the latent evolution pattern in many domains, such as social network, transportation system, and biology.\nRecently, researchers have proposed a range of temporal graph neural network (TGNN) models, e.g.,\nJODIE , DyRep , TGN [ref]3, TGAT [ref]4, CAWN , NeurTW , and NAT [ref]7.\nAs shown in Table 1,\nthese models introduce different techniques,\nsuch as memory, attention, RNN, and temporal walk, to detect temporal changes and update node representations. Limitation of Prior Works.\nIn the presence of different paradigms of TGNNs,\nit is therefore meaningful to compare their performance in various tasks.\nAlthough each of the above methods has provided an evaluation study,\nnone of them has covered a wide spectrum of the literature.\nA few premier works have tried to compare these models ;\nhowever,\nif we look at those TGNN benchmarks, we find that: The scope of current benchmarks is limited to some specific tasks.\nWorse, their evaluation of the existing TGNN models shows controversial and inconsistent results, mainly due to the lack of standard datasets and processing pipeline. For example, EdgeBank  compares a set of TGNNs only on link prediction task and does not unify the data loaders (e.g., train/validation/test split and inductive masking);\nsome works choose different dimensions of initial node features for the evaluated temporal graphs   [ref]7; some works use different seeds for edge samplers [ref]3 [ref]4 .\nWithout unifying the datasets and evaluation pipeline, previous work unsurprisingly reports different relative performance for the same set of TGNNs [ref]3 [ref]4   [ref]7 . Our Goals.\nDespite the efforts of previous works,\nthe landscape of TGNN has not been fully explored.\nWe try to achieve the following goals, which are vital, yet unsolved, for a mature TGNN benchmark. Benchmark datasets.\nA vital reason for the inconsistent results in previous work is that the temporal graph models are not compared using the same datasets.\nThe original graph is preprocessed in different manners, and the temporal order is handled from different perspectives.\nWithout standard datasets and their preprocessing steps, it is not possible to compare different TGNN models fairly. A unified pipeline.\nThe execution of a TGNN model naturally contains multiple phases, including but not limited to data loader, graph sampler, trainer, etc.\nUnfortunately, there is no benchmark library that establishes a general processing pipeline for temporal graphs. Diverse workloads.\nTemporal graphs evolve over time, and therefore there exist diverse workloads.\nFor example, there are transductive and inductive tasks, and the inductive task has New-Old and New-New scenarios (see Section 3.2.1).\nA solid benchmark should include diverse workloads. Efficiency comparison.\nIn addition to model quality, it is also indispensable to compare the efficiency performance of models to help us understand their performance trade-offs.\nHowever, this issue has not been well studied in the literature. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark on the state-of-the-art TGNN models.\nTo avoid orange-to-apple comparison, we first study how to construct standard datasets,\nand then study how to build a framework that evaluates various TGNN models in a unified pipeline.\nThe major contributions of this work are summarized below. We present BenchTemp, the first general benchmark for evaluating temporal graph neural network (TGNN) models over a wide range of tasks and settings. We construct a set of benchmark temporal graph datasets and\na unified benchmark pipeline.\nIn this way, we standardize the entire lifecycle of benchmarking TGNNs. On top of BenchTemp, we extensively compare representative TGNN models on the benchmark datasets, regarding different tasks, settings, metrics, and efficiency. We thoroughly discuss the empirical results and draw insights for TGNN.\nFurther, we have released the datasets, PyPI, and leaderboard.\nPlease refer to our github project and appendix for details."
