    "assessing model bias": "The result from an inductive learning process, i.e. the function f∗superscript𝑓f^{*} in Eq. 1), is often referred to as a ‘model’. As described in the previous sections, bias may propagate from the biased world, through a biased data generation, to the learning step with its inevitable inductive bias and other biases. The observed bias of a resulting model is often simply denoted ‘bias’    .\nTo distinguish this from other types of bias discussed in this paper, we propose using the term model bias to refer to bias as it appears and is analyzed in the final model.\nAn alternative would be the existing term algorithmic bias . However, typical usage of that term usually refers to the societal effects of biased systems , while our notion of bias is broader. Nevertheless, most suggestions on how to define model bias statistically consider such societal effects: how classification rates differ for groups of people with different values on a protected attribute such as race, color, religion, gender, disability, or family status .\nAs we will see in the following, classification rates may differ in very many respects, and a large number of bias types have been defined based on the condition that should hold for a model not to have that particular type of bias.\nFor a binary classifier we can for example require that the overall misclassification rate (OMR) is independent of a certain protected attribute A𝐴A (that takes the values 0 or 1). The corresponding condition for a classifier not being biased in this respect is : where Y^^𝑌\\widehat{Y} is the classifier output f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x) (see Eq. 2), and y𝑦y is the correct classification for input x𝑥x. Both Y^^𝑌\\widehat{Y} and y𝑦y take the values 0 or 1.\nFor example, the fact that a person is female (A=0𝐴0A=0) should not increase or decrease the risk of incorrectly being refused, or allowed, to borrow money at the bank.\nSeveral similar conditions can be defined to describe other types of unwanted bias in a classifier model : false positive rate (FPR): false negative rate (FNR): false omission rate (FOR): false discovery rate (FDR): Each one of these equations focuses on that an incorrect (Y^≠y)^𝑌𝑦(\\widehat{Y}\\neq y) classification should be independent of A𝐴A and a specific value of Y^^𝑌\\widehat{Y} or y𝑦y.\nThe advantageous classifier output (for example being accepted a loan) is here coded as 1.\nA classifier that does not satisfy one of these equations is said to be biased in the corresponding sense777In practise, the requirement is usually that the left and right hand side of the equation should be approximate equal..\nFor example, a classifier is biased with respect to FDR if the value of A𝐴A affects the probability of incorrectly being allowed to borrow money. A related condition is the equalized odds, which appears in the literature with slightly different definitions (see  and ). In , equalized odds is defined by the following two conditions (slightly modified notation): and Note that Eq. 8 is equivalent to FPR in Eq. 4, and Eq. 9 is equivalent to TPR in Eq. 5. Several other indicators of model bias have been proposed. Loftus et al.  define Calibration, Demographic Parity/Disparate Impact, and Individual Fairness.\nFor a binary classification Y^^𝑌\\widehat{Y}, and a binary protected group A𝐴A, demographic parity is defined as follows: That is, Y^^𝑌\\widehat{Y} should be independent of A𝐴A, such that the classifier in average gives the same predictions to different groups. If the equality does not hold, this is referred to as disparate impact.\nAn example is a software company that wants to reach a better gender balance among their, mainly male, programmers. By following the principle of demographic parity, when recruiting, the same proportion of female applicants as male applicants are hired. Taken all together we conclude that there is a large number of different types of model biases, each one with its own focus on unwanted behavior of a classifier. Furthermore, many of these biases are related, and it can also be shown that several of them are conflicting in the sense that they cannot be avoided simultaneously   .\nHence, it is problematic to talk about ‘fair’ or ‘unbiased’ classifiers, at least without clearly defining the meaning of the terms. It can also be argued that a proper notion of fairness must be task-specific [ref]16."
