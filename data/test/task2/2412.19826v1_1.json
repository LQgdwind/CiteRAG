    "context": "The Bayesian approach to probabilistic reasoning is known as Bayesian Inference, and is an increasingly popular method to perform machine learning that enjoys strong mathematical foundations111Section 1.1, 1.2, 2.1 (intro) and 2.1.1, are loosely based on – but not directly copied, from my IRR/IPP.. Bayesian Inference has useful properties, compared to deep learning based machine learning, such as interpretability, explainability and expressiveness with respect to various forms of uncertainty  . At the heart of the Bayesian paradigm is the notion of a generative model. Generative models can account for the expressiveness of uncertainty and interpretability. In order to perform probabilistic modelling, knowledge about a domain and the uncertainty associated with that knowledge is encoded into a generative model, using expert knowledge. Inference algorithms estimate parameters of the model, that generate the observed data, by conditioning models on associated observed data. For instance, a climate researcher may create a basic model of a city when studying urban heat islands. The climate researcher would condition the model of the city with empirical data, such as the observed temperatures of the city, in order to infer values of interest such as latent city temperatures or factors that influence the temperature of a city. Probabilistic programming languages provide a generic framework to perform inference. \n To highlight the importance of probabilistic programming languages, large multinational technology companies such as Microsoft, Google and Uber have recently started to invest in their own probabilistic programming languages (Infer.NET [ref]3, Edward [ref]4 and Pyro  respectively). Increasingly, machine learning use cases find their way into areas as diverse as critical defense national infrastructure  or medical diagnostics . Society is therefore increasingly in a position that relies on programmers to produce correct machine learning related code. As probabilistic programming becomes more important, the code that underlies probabilistic programming languages will face increasing scrutiny. Fortunately, there are two important programming language research goals which aim to ensure the correctness of code; modularity and type-safety. In particular, they ensure that programmers can be certain early on – at compile time – that composing code will not cause programs to crash or introduce unintended (inference) algorithmic bias. These research goals have two effects; as programming libraries become safer and more modular, machine learning models will become cleaner, simpler and easier to maintain, which will additionally make machine learning more trusted, and perhaps more widely adopted. \n Algebraic effects are a recently discovered abstraction which enable modular programming . However, algebraic effects do not use monads 0; an abstraction derived from a branch of mathematics known as category theory. Monads are known to be both unintuitive as well as not being closed under composition. Monad Bayes is a library for modular probabilistic programming published only last year, that makes essential use of types. However, whilst it is based off a denotational validation 1, it suffers from the issues associated with monads 2. These issues motivate a previously unachieved construction, of a modular probabilistic programming language, that also uses this same denotational validation, to perform Bayesian inference using algebraic effects with expressive effect-types."
