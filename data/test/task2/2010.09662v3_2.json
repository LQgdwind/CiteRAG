    "i introduction": "Environment prediction is critical for developing intelligent agents capable of safe interaction with the surroundings, such as autonomous vehicles. Urban driving involves a multitude of complex scenarios that contain cluttered and obscured environments with a variety of moving and static obstacles. Experienced human drivers understand the semantics of the scene and can anticipate the future motion of other traffic participants. They implicitly use this knowledge to ensure the safety and comfort of their resulting maneuvers. Likewise, decision-making frameworks and trajectory planning algorithms must consider the inherent temporality of the perceived state and plan proactively to facilitate safe and comfortable transportation  . Environment prediction architectures fall into two paradigms. A classical robotics approach involves multiple sequential stages such as object detection and classification, state estimation, and motion modeling     . However, this approach often requires full observability and operates on heavily preprocessed information. In contrast, a neural network-based approach uses minimally processed information from sensors to directly perform environment prediction [ref]8  .\nWe focus on the latter and exploit the rich perception data provided by LiDAR sensors. The task is posed as self-supervised sequence-to-sequence learning 0 in which a single scenario is decomposed into an input history sequence and a target prediction sequence. For the environment representation, we use a discrete map in the form of an occupancy grid 1 due to its robustness to partial environment observability . This approach enables the use of uncertainty-aware occupancy state estimation, modeled using either Bayesian methods 1 or Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) 2, to update our belief about the surroundings. Prior work used Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) frameworks 3 to tackle occupancy grid prediction onboard both fixed 4 and moving   platforms. These architectures are capable of capturing the dynamics of the environment, but they often suffer from mode-averaging and limited long-term dependencies between sequence elements 5. Both issues lead to the blurriness of the predicted occupancy grid and, more importantly, the gradual disappearance of moving obstacles, which is a critical aspect of environment prediction  5. Our method extends the approach for occupancy grid prediction defined by  with attention 6 7 8 9 in order to improve the long-term dependencies captured by the prediction model. We propose attention-based extensions to the ConvLSTM architecture that aim to reduce prediction blurring and obstacle disappearance in longer time horizon predictions (see Fig. 1). We hypothesize that prediction quality can be improved by strengthening the learned dependencies both across time and between different spatial regions in the environment. There are three subspaces to consider: feature (what is present in the environment), 2D spatial (where the object is in the environment), and temporal (when the object is present in the sequence). We introduce the Temporal Attention Augmented Convolution (TAAConv) operator, which\nto our knowledge, is the first operator that successfully applies attention jointly to all three subspaces. We investigate two attention-based extensions of the ConvLSTM network where we replace convolution with our TAAConv operator and a self-attention equivalent (SAAConv). We compare the performance of the proposed architectures with other common spatiotemporal prediction models. The key contributions in this work are as follows: We develop the novel Temporal Attention Augmented Convolution (TAAConv) operator that enables joint attention over the feature, 2D spatial, and temporal subspaces in a sequence of frames. We introduce the Temporal Attention Augmented ConvLSTM (TAAConvLSTM) and the Self-Attention Augmented ConvLSTM (SAAConvLSTM) architectures which encourage long-range dependencies between hidden representations and improve prediction quality for sequence-to-sequence environment prediction tasks. We apply the proposed mechanisms to local occupancy grid prediction for a moving ego-vehicle, and demonstrate superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art architectures, such as PredNet 0, PredRNN++ 1, and CDNA 2. We evaluate the proposed mechanisms on two real-world datasets: KITTI 3 and the Waymo Open Dataset 4. We show that our architectures generate higher quality predictions by reducing blurring and moving obstacle disappearance, while better maintaining static environment structure in the predictions."
