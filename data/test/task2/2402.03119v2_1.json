  "title": "Good Teachers Explain: Explanation-Enhanced Knowledge Distillation",
  "sections": {
    "related work": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been introduced to compress larger models into smaller, more efficient models for cost-effective deployment . Various approaches for KD have since been proposed, which we group into three types for the following discussion:\nlogit-   , feature- [ref]34 5  , and explanation-based KD 9 . Logit-based KD , which optimizes the logit distributions of teacher and student to be similar, can suffice to match their accuracies, as long as the models are trained for long enough (‘patient teaching’) and the models’ logits are based on the same images (‘consistent teaching’), see .\nHowever,\n0 showed that despite such a careful setup, the function learnt by the student can still significantly differ from the teacher’s by comparing the agreement between the two. We expand on 0 and\nintroduce additional evaluation settings\nto better evaluate KD fidelity, and show that it can be significantly improved by\na surprisingly simple explanation-matching approach. While  reports that\nKD does seem to transfer additional properties to the student, by showing that GradCAM explanations of the students are more similar to the teacher’s than those of an independently trained model, we show that explicitly optimizing for explanation similarity not only significantly improves this w.r.t. vanilla KD, but also yields important additional benefits such as a higher robustness to distribution shifts. Feature-based KD approaches [ref]34 5   provide additional information to the students by optimizing some of the students’ intermediate activation maps to be similar to those of the teacher. For this, specific choices regarding which layers of teachers and students to match need to be made and these approaches are thus architecture-dependent. In contrast, our proposed e2KD is architecture-agnostic as it matches only the explanations of the models’ predictions. Explanation-based KD approaches have only recently begun to emerge 9  and these are conceptually most related to our work. In CAT-KD 9, the authors match class activation maps (CAM 8) of students and teachers. As such, CAT-KD can also be considered an ‘explanation-enhanced’ KD (e2KD) approach. However, the explanation aspect of the CAMs plays only a secondary role in 9, as the authors even reduce the resolution of the CAMs to 2×\\times2 and fidelity is not considered. In contrast, we explicitly introduce e2KD to improve distillation fidelity and evaluate fidelity across multiple settings. Further, similar to our work,  argues that explanations can form part of the model functionality and should be considered in KD. To do so, the authors train an additional autoencoder to mimic the explanations of the teacher model; explanations and predictions are thus produced by separate models. In contrast, we optimize the students directly to yield similar explanations as the teachers in a simple and parameter-free manner. Fixed Teaching.\n4  5 explore pre-computing the logits at the start of training to limit the computational costs due to the teacher.\nIn addition to pre-computing logits, we pre-compute explanations and show how they can nonetheless be used to guide the student model during distillation. Explanation Methods.\nTo better understand the decision making process of DNNs, many explanation methods have been proposed in recent years    .\nFor our e2KD experiments, we take advantage of the differentiability of attribution-based explanations and train the student models to yield similar explanations as the teachers. In particular, we evaluate both a popular post-hoc explanation method (GradCAM ) as well as the model-inherent explanations of the recently proposed B-cos models  . Model Guidance. e2KD is inspired by recent advances in\nmodel guidance  8 7  ,\nwhere models are guided to focus on desired input features via human annotations. Analogously, we also guide the focus of student models, but using knowledge (explanations) of a teacher model instead of a human annotator. As such, no explicit guidance annotations are required in our approach. Further, in contrast to the discrete annotations typically used in model guidance (e.g. bounding boxes or segmentation masks), we use the real-valued explanations as given by the teacher model.\nOur approach thus shares additional similarities with , in which a model is guided via the attention maps of a vision-language model. Similar to our work, the authors show that this can guide the students to focus on the ‘right’ input features. We extend such guidance to KD and discuss the benefits that this yields for KD fidelity."
