    "introduction": "The q𝑞q-state Potts model is a classical model of ferromagnetism in statistical physics   which generalises the well-known Ising model. On a (multi)graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E), configurations of the model are all possible assignments σ:V→[q]:𝜎→𝑉delimited-[]𝑞\\sigma:V\\rightarrow[q] where [q]={1,…,q}delimited-[]𝑞1…𝑞[q]=\\{1,\\ldots,q\\} is a set of q𝑞q spins with q≥2𝑞2q\\geq 2. The model is parameterised by y𝑦y, which is a function of the temperature of the model and is also known as the edge interaction. Each configuration σ𝜎\\sigma is assigned weight ym​(σ)superscript𝑦𝑚𝜎y^{m(\\sigma)} where m​(σ)𝑚𝜎m(\\sigma) denotes the number of monochromatic edges of G𝐺G under σ𝜎\\sigma. The partition function of the model is the aggregate weight over all configurations, i.e., When q=2𝑞2q=2, this model is known as the Ising model, and we sometimes use the notation ZIsing​(G;y)subscript𝑍Ising𝐺𝑦Z_{\\mathrm{Ising}}(G;y) to denote its partition function. The Ising/Potts models have an extremely useful generalisation to non-integer values of q𝑞q via the so-called “random-cluster” formulation and the closely related Tutte polynomial. In particular, for numbers q𝑞q and γ𝛾\\gamma, the Tutte polynomial of a graph G𝐺G is given by where k​(A)𝑘𝐴k(A) denotes the number of connected components in the graph (V,A)𝑉𝐴(V,A) (isolated vertices do count). When q𝑞q is an integer with q≥2𝑞2q\\geq 2, we have ZPotts​(G;q,y)=ZTutte​(G;q,y−1)subscript𝑍Potts𝐺𝑞𝑦subscript𝑍Tutte𝐺𝑞𝑦1Z_{\\mathrm{Potts}}(G;q,y)=Z_{\\mathrm{Tutte}}(G;q,y-1), see, for instance, . The Tutte polynomial on planar graphs is particularly relevant in quantum computing since it corresponds to the Jones polynomial of an “alternating link” [44, Chapter 5], and polynomial-time quantum computation can be simulated by additively approximating the Jones polynomial at a suitable value, as we will explain later in more detail, see also  for details. In this paper, we study the complexity of approximating the partition function of the Potts model and the Tutte polynomial on planar graphs as the parameter y𝑦y ranges in the complex plane. Traditionally, this problem has been mainly considered in the case where y𝑦y is a positive real, however recent developments have shown that for various models, including the Ising and Potts models, there is a close interplay between the location of zeros of the partition function in the complex plane and the approximability of the problem, even for positive real values of y𝑦y. The framework of viewing partition functions as polynomials in the complex plane of the underlying parameters has been well-explored in statistical physics and has recently gained traction in computer science as well in the context of approximate counting. On the positive side, zero-free regions in the complex plane translate into efficient algorithms for approximating the partition function  2 and this scheme has lead to a broad range of new algorithms even for positive real values of the underlying parameters 9   0   8 9 0. On the negative side, the presence of zeros poses a barrier to this approach and, in fact, it has been demonstrated that zeros mark the onset of computational hardness for the approximability of the partition function 6 2  . These new algorithmic and computational complexity developments stemming from the complex plane mesh with the statistical physics perspective where zeros have long been studied in the context of pinpointing phase transitions, see e.g.,   1 8 5 . For the problem of exactly computing the partition function of the Potts model, Jaeger, Vertigan and Welsh 3, as a corollary of a more general classification theorem for the Tutte polynomial, established #​𝖯#𝖯\\#\\mathsf{P}-hardness unless (q,y)𝑞𝑦(q,y) is one of seven exceptional points, see Section 6.3 for more details; Vertigan 2 further showed that the same classification applies on planar graphs with the exception of the Ising model (q=2𝑞2q=2), where the problem is in 𝖥𝖯𝖥𝖯\\mathsf{FP}. For the approximation problem, the only known result that applies for general values y𝑦y in the complex plane is by Goldberg and Guo 2, which addresses the case q=2𝑞2q=2; the case q≥3𝑞3q\\geq 3 is largely open apart from the case when y𝑦y is real which has been studied extensively even for planar graphs 4 3 4 6 7 2. We will review all these results more precisely in the next section, where we also state our main theorems."
