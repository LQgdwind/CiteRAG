    "heterogeneous scheduling algorithms": "Among various heterogeneous runtimes,\nwork stealing is a popular strategy to reduce the complexity of\nload balancing  \nand has inspired the designs of many\nparallel runtimes     .\nA key challenge in work-stealing designs is worker management.\nInstead of keeping all workers busy most of the time   ,\nboth oneTBB  and BWS 3 have developed sleep-based strategies.\noneTBB employs a mixed strategy of fixed-number worker notification,\nexponential backoff, and noop assembly.\nBWS modifies OS kernel to alter the yield behavior.\n takes inspiration from BWS and oneTBB to develop an\nadaptive work-stealing algorithm to minimize the number of wasteful steals.\nOther approaches, such as  that targets a space-sharing environment,\n that tunes hardware frequency scaling,\n2  that balance load on distributed memory,\n1 7   that deal with data locality,\nand  that focuses on memory-bound applications\nhave improved work stealing in certain performance aspects, but their results\nare limited to the CPU domain.\nHow to migrate the above approaches to a heterogeneous target remains an open question. In terms of GPU-based task schedulers,\nWhippletree [ref]50 design a fine-grained resource scheduling algorithm\nfor sparse and scattered parallelism atop a custom program model.\n leverages reinforcement learning to place machine learning workloads\nonto GPUs.\nHipacc  introduces a pipeline-based optimization for CUDA graphs\nto speed up image processing workloads.\n[ref]55 develops a compiler to transforms OpenMP directives to a CUDA graph.\nThese works have primarily focused on scheduling GPU tasks in various applications,\nwhich are orthogonal to our generic heterogeneous scheduling approaches."
