    "related work": "Simulation and Its Variants.\nIn this paper, we focused on four simulation variants: simple simulation  , bisimulation , degree-preserving simulation  and bijective simulation. The original definition of simulation  only considered out-neighbors, but Ma et al.’s redefinition in 2011  takes in-neighbors into account and hence is the definition we used. Reverting to the original definition is as easy as setting w−=0superscript𝑤0w^{-}=0 in our framework. Additionally, we discussed a variant of approximate bisimulation, namely k𝑘k-bisimulation 0 1 2 0, and investigated its relation to our framework (Section 4.3). There are other variants that have not yet included in the framework, including bounded simulation  and weak simulation . These variants consider the k𝑘k-hop neighbors (k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1) in addition to the immediate neighbors. As an interesting future work, we will study to incorporate them in our framework. There are also some algorithms that aim to compute simulation (variants) efficiently and effectively, e.g., a hash-based algorithm in 0, external-memory algorithms in  2, a distributed algorithm in 1 and a partition refinement algorithm in 8. However, all these algorithms compute the “yes-or-no” simulation (or its variant) and cannot provide fractional scores as proposed in this paper. Node Similarity Measures.  We have shown that 𝖥𝖲𝗂𝗆𝖻𝗃subscript𝖥𝖲𝗂𝗆𝖻𝗃{\\mathsf{FSim}}_{{\\mathsf{bj}}} is qualified for node similarity measurement. Thus, we review node similarity measures on labeled graphs. 𝖲𝗂𝗆𝖱𝖺𝗇𝗄𝖲𝗂𝗆𝖱𝖺𝗇𝗄\\mathsf{SimRank} 8 and 𝖱𝗈𝗅𝖾𝖲𝗂𝗆𝖱𝗈𝗅𝖾𝖲𝗂𝗆\\mathsf{RoleSim} 9 are two representative measures, and their relations to our 𝖥𝖲𝗂𝗆χsubscript𝖥𝖲𝗂𝗆𝜒{\\mathsf{FSim}}_{\\chi} have been discussed in Section 4.3. As these two measures are less effective in computing node similarity on labeled graphs 3 1, similarity measures 3 9 1 2 were proposed. 𝖯𝖺𝗍𝗁𝖲𝗂𝗆𝖯𝖺𝗍𝗁𝖲𝗂𝗆\\mathsf{PathSim} 1, for instance, uses a ratio of meta-paths connecting two nodes as the measure. 𝖩𝗈𝗂𝗇𝖲𝗂𝗆𝖩𝗈𝗂𝗇𝖲𝗂𝗆\\mathsf{JoinSim} 2 is similar to 𝖯𝖺𝗍𝗁𝖲𝗂𝗆𝖯𝖺𝗍𝗁𝖲𝗂𝗆\\mathsf{PathSim}, but it satisfies the triangle inequality. 𝗇𝖲𝗂𝗆𝖦𝗋𝖺𝗆𝗇𝖲𝗂𝗆𝖦𝗋𝖺𝗆\\mathsf{nSimGram} 3 computes node similarity based on q-grams instead of meta-paths to capture more topology information. Note that these measures cannot substitute our work as their scores are not related to simulation and thus are not suitable to quantify the extent of simulation. Similarity-based Applications. There are a number of works on pattern matching and graph alignment that are based on node similarity techniques. These works may differ in measuring node similarities. Specifically, 𝖨𝗌𝗈𝖱𝖺𝗇𝗄𝖨𝗌𝗈𝖱𝖺𝗇𝗄\\mathsf{IsoRank} 3 computes the similarity between two nodes based on an weighted average of their neighbors’ scores. 𝖭𝖾𝖬𝖺𝖭𝖾𝖬𝖺\\mathsf{NeMa} 4 defines a vector that encodes the neighborhood information for each node. The distance between two nodes is then computed from these vectors. 𝖭𝖠𝖦𝖠𝖭𝖠𝖦𝖠\\mathsf{NAGA} 5 leverages statistical significance through chi-square measure to compute node similarity. 𝖱𝖤𝖦𝖠𝖫𝖱𝖤𝖦𝖠𝖫\\mathsf{REGAL} 0 measures the similarity of two nodes by taking the information of k𝑘k-hop neighbors into account. 𝖥𝖨𝖱𝖲𝖳𝖥𝖨𝖱𝖲𝖳\\mathsf{FIRST} 1 and 𝖥𝖨𝖭𝖠𝖫𝖥𝖨𝖭𝖠𝖫\\mathsf{FINAL} 6 use a Sylvester equation to compute similarities, which encodes structural consistency and attribute consistency of two networks. For similar reasons, these works are also not suitable to quantify the degree of simulation."
