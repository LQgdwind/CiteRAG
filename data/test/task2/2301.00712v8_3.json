    "the assumptions for nonconvex-pl bilevel problems": "Without the typical lower-level strong convexity assumption, it is difficult to directly analyze the implicit gradient as Equation 4 since we can not directly use the implicit function theorem. Recently, Kwon et al.  proposed a novel way to study the differentiability of φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x) for nonconvex-PL bilevel problems. Instead of directly studying the original hyper-objective φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x), they studied the\nfollowing value-function penalized hyper-objective as a bridge: where g∗​(x)=miny∈𝒴⁡g​(x,y)superscript𝑔𝑥subscript𝑦𝒴𝑔𝑥𝑦g^{*}(x)=\\min_{y\\in{\\mathcal{Y}}}g(x,y) is the lower-level value-function and 𝒴⊆ℝdy𝒴superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑦{\\mathcal{Y}}\\subseteq{\\mathbb{R}}^{d_{y}}. They first studied the differentiability of φσ​(x)subscript𝜑𝜎𝑥\\varphi_{\\sigma}(x) and then showed the limit of σ→0+→𝜎superscript0\\sigma\\rightarrow 0^{+} exists. However, the PL condition on g𝑔g is not sufficient to guarantee the differentiability of φσ​(x)subscript𝜑𝜎𝑥\\varphi_{\\sigma}(x). Below, we give a concrete example to illustrate this. Consider Problem (1) with dx=1subscript𝑑𝑥1d_{x}=1, dy=2subscript𝑑𝑦2d_{y}=2. Let the upper-level function f​(x,y)=x​y𝑓𝑥𝑦𝑥subscript𝑦delimited-[]1f(x,y)=xy_{}, and the lower-level function g​(x,y)=12​y2𝑔𝑥𝑦12superscriptsubscript𝑦delimited-[]22g(x,y)=\\frac{1}{2}y_{}^{2}. The lower-level function is 111-PL in y𝑦y. Consider the penalized hyper-objective φσ​(x)subscript𝜑𝜎𝑥\\varphi_{\\sigma}(x) in Equation 6. For any σ≥0𝜎0\\sigma\\geq 0,\nif taking minimum in y𝑦y over all the domain y∈ℝ2𝑦superscriptℝ2y\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^{2}, φσ​(x)subscript𝜑𝜎𝑥\\varphi_{\\sigma}(x) is not well-defined since φσ​(x)=−∞subscript𝜑𝜎𝑥\\varphi_{\\sigma}(x)=-\\infty for any x≠0𝑥0x\\neq 0; if taking minimum in y𝑦y over a compact domain such as 𝒴=[ref]0 ×[ref]0 𝒴0101{\\mathcal{Y}}=[ref]0 \\times[ref]0 , φσ​(x)=min⁡{x,0}subscript𝜑𝜎𝑥𝑥0\\varphi_{\\sigma}(x)=\\min\\{x,0\\} is not differentiable at the point x=0𝑥0x=0. To guarantee the differentiability of φσ​(x)subscript𝜑𝜎𝑥\\varphi_{\\sigma}(x), Kwon et al.  assumed the PL condition not only holds for g𝑔g, but also holds for the penalty function hσ=σ​f+gsubscriptℎ𝜎𝜎𝑓𝑔h_{\\sigma}=\\sigma f+g uniformly for all σ𝜎\\sigma near zero. In addition to this assumption, the authors also imposed other standard smoothness assumptions which are typically required in previous works. These assumptions, as stated in Kwon et al. , are formally presented below. Recall the bilevel problem defined in Equation 1, where f𝑓f is the upper-level problem, g𝑔g is the lower-level problem. Let hσ=σ​f+gsubscriptℎ𝜎𝜎𝑓𝑔h_{\\sigma}=\\sigma f+g be the penalty function. Suppose that The penalty function hσ​(x,y)subscriptℎ𝜎𝑥𝑦h_{\\sigma}(x,y) is μ𝜇\\mu-PL in y𝑦y for any 0≤σ≤σ¯0𝜎¯𝜎0\\leq\\sigma\\leq\\overline{\\sigma}; The upper-level function f​(x,y)𝑓𝑥𝑦f(x,y) is Cfsubscript𝐶𝑓C_{f}-Lipschitz in y𝑦y and has Lfsubscript𝐿𝑓L_{f}-Lipschitz gradients; The lower-level function g​(x,y)𝑔𝑥𝑦g(x,y) has Lgsubscript𝐿𝑔L_{g}-Lipschitz gradients; The upper-level function f​(x,y)𝑓𝑥𝑦f(x,y) has ρfsubscript𝜌𝑓\\rho_{f}-Lipschitz Hessians; The lower-level function g​(x,y)𝑔𝑥𝑦g(x,y) has ρgsubscript𝜌𝑔\\rho_{g}-Lipschitz Hessians. Under this assumption, we define the largest smoothness constant ℓ=max⁡{Cf,Lf,Lg,ρg}ℓsubscript𝐶𝑓subscript𝐿𝑓subscript𝐿𝑔subscript𝜌𝑔\\ell=\\max\\{C_{f},L_{f},L_{g},\\rho_{g}\\} and the condition number κ:=ℓ/μassign𝜅ℓ𝜇\\kappa:=\\ell/\\mu. Note that all the assumptions are the same as Kwon et al. , except (a) may seem different from the Prox-EB assumption (Assumption 1 in Kwon et al. ). However, in Appendix D we show these two assumptions can imply each other. Our narrative uses the PL condition and is therefore more convenient. As a by-product, we show the proximal operator in Kwon et al.  is unnecessary, and the original F2BA [ref]8 can also converge under PL conditions. Because we focus on the behavior when σ𝜎\\sigma is close to zero, whenever we mention σ𝜎\\sigma in the context, we always assume that σ∈[0,σ¯]𝜎0¯𝜎\\sigma\\in[0,\\overline{\\sigma}] even when this condition is not explicitly stated. Assumption 4.1 ensures that the solution set Y∗superscript𝑌Y^{*} is stable under perturbations of σ𝜎\\sigma and x𝑥x. Let Yσ∗:=arg⁡miny∈ℝdy⁡hσ​(x,y)assignsubscriptsuperscript𝑌𝜎subscript𝑦superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑦subscriptℎ𝜎𝑥𝑦Y^{*}_{\\sigma}:=\\arg\\min_{y\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^{d_{y}}}h_{\\sigma}(x,y) denote the set of minima for the penalty function hσ​(x,y)=σ​f​(x,y)+g​(x,y)subscriptℎ𝜎𝑥𝑦𝜎𝑓𝑥𝑦𝑔𝑥𝑦h_{\\sigma}(x,y)=\\sigma f(x,y)+g(x,y). Under Assumption 4.1, we have that Then we can use Theorem 3.1 to get the continuity of hyper-objective φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x)."
