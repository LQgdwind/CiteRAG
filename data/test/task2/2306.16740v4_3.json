    "ix-b existing social navigation datasets": "In this section we review some of the existing dataset in the context of our social navigation characteristics. These are presented in Table V. We review the following datasets. jrdb [ref]138 is a multi-modal dataset containing stereo 360 RGB video, 3D lidar scans, audio, and wheel encoder measurements from both indoor and outdoor environments. It provides annotations for human tracking and detection along with a benchmark and metrics to compare different algorithms. thor  is a public dataset providing motion trajectories of robots and humans in a range of curated scenarios of humans visiting and inspecting areas or carrying objects. scand  [ref]145 is a public dataset providing socially compliant navigation demonstrations recorded via teleoperating two different mobile robots in a socially compliant manner by human demonstrators. The objective behind the scand dataset is to study the social navigation behavior of robots in the presence of human crowds. Similar to scand, MuSohu  includes 3D lidar scans, RGBD camera images, 360°  camera images, IMU data, and ambient sound collected from a sensor suite mounted on a helmet worn by humans walking around public spaces (instead of on a teleoperated robot), from which social robot navigation can be learned. This allows social human navigation data to be collected in the wild with a low setup cost, making MuSoHu easily extendable. Also like scand, lcas  is a public dataset containing 3D lidar scans collected using a mobile robot teleoperated in heavily crowded environments. Unlike scand, the robot is not necessarily teleoperated in a socially compliant manner. The focus of lcas is to solve perception-related challenges in social navigation, such as online human detection. The eth/ucy   dataset consists of human trajectories recorded in public spaces from a bird’s eye view vantage point using an RGB camera. The trajectories are extracted by tracking humans from the bird’s eye view images. The motivation behind the eth/ucy dataset is to provide real-world trajectories of humans navigating among other humans in the scene so one can replicate-by-copying such trajectories in a simulator. Trajectories from the eth/ucy dataset can be used to simulate a diverse set of realistic social scenarios.  propose conditioning the predicted future trajectory also on scene knowledge and social interactions among agents. The Trajnet++  dataset is composed of several existing datasets such as eth/ucy  , CFF crowd dataset [ref]153 with other synthetic data generated with ORCA. Kothari et al.  have shared a benchmark and challenge focusing on agent-agent scenarios. They provide proper sampling of trajectories and a unified extensive evaluation system to test the gathered methods for a fair comparison. The Ediburgh Informatics Forum Pedestrian Database (eifpd)  is again similar to eth/ucy, while providing a much higher number of humans captured in the dataset, the camera is fixed overhead roughly about 23 meters from the floor. Humans are detected by processing this bird’s eye view image from the scene and tracking them in the scene. Stanford Drone Dataset (sdd)  is similar to eth/ucy since it also provides a bird’s eye view frame, recorded using a drone (unlike eth/ucy that uses a statically mounted camera). Compared to eth/ucy, the unique selling point of this dataset is large-scale images and videos of diverse scenarios including bicyclists, skateboarders, cars, buses, and golf carts navigating in the real world. Egocentric Future Localization (efl)  provides RGBD sequences of frames from the perspective of a human in various indoor and outdoor scenes such as Parks, Malls, and a Campus, with various activities such as walking, shopping, and social interaction. efl’s focus is human trajectory prediction in novel scenes. wildtrack  is similar to eth/ucy. A GoPro camera is mounted in an outdoor environment scene consisting of crowds of people walking around. This dataset focuses on person detection in the presence of severe obstacles such as other humans and static obstacles in the scene. The CrowdBot  consists of egocentric RGBD and point-cloud data from a Qolo robot , captured in autonomous and teleoperated modes in outdoor scenes. Several datasets present synthetic trajectories for benchmark comparison. SocNav1  and SocNav2  are datasets of human-labeled simulated human-robot interactions used for both benchmarking algorithms and as training datasets for learning algorithms. DynaBARN  includes 300 synthetic environments with agents with different motion profiles. The SACSoN  dataset is a collection of egocentric RGB, RGBD, LIDAR, odometry and bumper data from a policy-controlled iRobot Roomba navigating autonomously under policy control in indoor human environments. The dataset was created by a scalable system wrapping the policy control with a help-and-rescue module enabling long-term data collection, resulting in 75 hours of data and 58 kilometers of interaction with over 4000 individual human-robot interactions. The dataset supported a continual-learning architecture which showed the ability to learn from collected data. Interestingly, the experimenters collected an “interaction-rich” subset of data in which the robot was encouraged to drive closer from humans - then negated this objective and used this data to train a socially-compliant policy. The sg-lstm  dataset is a curated dataset designed to provide insight into pedestrian behavior collected on Purdue University’s West Lafayette, Indiana campus using a GO1 Edu robot by Unitree Robotics navigating unobtrusively among pedestrians. SG-LSTM focuses on the interactions, movements, and group formations of pedestrians in a variety of scenarios including campus thoroughfares, gatherings, dining and study areas, green spaces, and inclement weather events."
