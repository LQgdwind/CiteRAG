    "introduction": "Epistemic logic investigates knowledge and belief, and change of knowledge and belief, in multi-agent systems. Since  it has developed into multiple directions. Knowledge change was extensively modelled in temporal epistemic logics  [ref]27  and more recently in dynamic epistemic logics , where action model logic was particularly successful . Modelling asynchrony and concurrency in epistemic logic has been investigated in many works in a temporal or dynamic setting  [ref]27  7    and more recently in dynamic epistemic logic   8. Combinatorial topology has been used to great effect in distributed computing to model concurrency and asynchrony since the early works    that identified one-dimensional connectivity invariants, and the higher dimensional topological properties discovered in the early 1990’s e.g. 3 4. A recent overview is 2. The basic structure in combinatorial topology is the simplicial complex, a collection of subsets of a set of vertices closed under containment. The subsets, called\nsimplices, can be vertices, edges, triangles, tetrahedrons, etc. Geometric manipulations that preserve some of the topology of an initial simplicial complex, such as subdivision, correspond in a natural and transparent way to the evolution of a distributed computation by a set of agents.\nIn turn, the topological invariants preserved, determine the computational power of the distributed computing\nsystem (defined by the possible failures, asynchrony, and communication media). Recently, an epistemic logic interpreted on simplicial complexes has been proposed [ref]25  . There is a categorical correspondence between the usual Kripke model frames to interpret epistemic logic and models based on simplicial complexes. The epistemic logic of  is also a dynamic epistemic logic: the action models of  correspond to simplicial complexes in the same way as Kripke models, but then with a dynamic interpretation, such that action execution is a product operation on simplicial complexes. In this way,  models distributed computing tasks and algorithms in their combinatorial topological incarnations as simplicial complexes. As their knowledge operators can be interpreted for typical asynchronous algorithms (e.g. when processes communicate by writing and reading shared variables), this is a relevant notion of asynchronous knowledge, as it reasons over indistinguishable asynchronous sequences of events, although differently so than . Predating  the work of Porter 2 already established a relation between multi-agent epistemic models and simplicial complexes by way of the logic of knowledge. In that work the dynamics were based on the runs-and-systems approach of [ref]27  and not on a dynamic epistemic logic as in . In this work we further explore and survey what the logic of knowledge can contribute to the description of simplicial complexes and their dynamic evolution. The goal is to present an introduction to a variety of issues that arise when using simplicial complexes in epistemic logic; each one can be studied in more detail, and many problems remain open."
