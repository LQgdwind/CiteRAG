    "previous work": "Many attempts have been made to computationally solve ARC, primarily through the Kaggle Abstraction & Reasoning Challenge hosted in 2019¬† with a $20,000 prize pool, where the current state-of-the-art was set by Johan Sokrates Wind (a.k.a. Icecuber)¬†. Icecuber implements a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) with 142 handcrafted unary functions on grids. At runtime, the functions are greedily composed on the input grids, with the resulting ‚Äòpieces‚Äô stored in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Finally, a solver combines pieces from the DAG to get as close as possible to matching the training examples. Figure 4 shows an outline of the approach; a detailed description is available in Supplementary Materials. Xu et al. introduced ARGA (Abstract Reasoning with Graph Abstractions)¬†; they extended DSL search by converting ARC grids into an object-graph representation, and operating on these representations instead. Additionally, a series of constraints were derived from the training examples to prune the search space, and a ‚ÄòTabu list‚Äô avoided searching primitives with poor recent performance. Overall, this approach achieved performance comparable to Icecuber limited to a small subset of tasks related to object manipulation. While ARC was designed to be a machine learning benchmark, the state-of-the-art solutions all rely on entirely handcrafted methods similar to Icecuber. There have been attempts to use ML, but these have been limited to small subsets of the ARC dataset. For example, Golubev et al. solved tasks that rely on cropping by extracting features from grids and training a task-specific decision tree classifier to try and predict cropping coordinates (x,y,w,h)ùë•ùë¶ùë§‚Ñé(x,y,w,h) for a task‚Äôs test example¬† . This approach generalized to solve 7% of private test set tasks. In 2021, Alford et al.¬†[ref]9  explored the idea of applying the neurosymbolic solver DreamCoder¬† to the ARC dataset, considered much more challenging than previous DreamCoder applications. They selected a subset of 36 ARC-Easy tasks involving symmetry and basic geometric operations (such as rotations, flips and crops), and provided a DSL with 5 basic primitives on grids. They found that DreamCoder could solve some of the tasks and also successfully created new primitives. However, this solution was limited to a small subset of the ARC-Easy dataset, and did not use neural-network-guided search unlike the original neurosymbolic solver DreamCoder paper¬†. In the next section, we review the DreamCoder algorithm in detail, and then revisit whether DreamCoder can be extended to solve much more of ARC by harnessing a more powerful DSL, neural networks and other improvements."
