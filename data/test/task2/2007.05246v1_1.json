    "introduction": "In the target set selection model (TSS model for short), as formulated by Chen , it is given an undirected graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) and a threshold function τ𝜏\\tau in G𝐺G, which is a function τ:V​(G)→ℕ:𝜏→𝑉𝐺ℕ\\tau:V(G)\\to\\mathbb{N} satisfying 1≤τ​(v)≤d​(v)1𝜏𝑣𝑑𝑣1\\leq\\tau(v)\\leq d(v) for every vertex v𝑣v, where d​(v)𝑑𝑣d(v) is the degree of v𝑣v.\nWe say that a set S0⊆V​(G)subscript𝑆0𝑉𝐺S_{0}\\subseteq V(G) is a target set if the vertex set V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) can be partitioned into non-empty subsets S0,S1,…,Stsubscript𝑆0subscript𝑆1…subscript𝑆𝑡S_{0},S_{1},\\dotsc,S_{t} such that, for i∈{1,…,t}𝑖1…𝑡i\\in\\{1,\\dotsc,t\\}, Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i} contains exactly every vertex v𝑣v outside S0∪⋯∪Si−1subscript𝑆0⋯subscript𝑆𝑖1S_{0}\\cup\\dots\\cup S_{i-1} having at least τ​(v)𝜏𝑣\\tau(v) neighbors in S0∪⋯∪Si−1subscript𝑆0⋯subscript𝑆𝑖1S_{0}\\cup\\dots\\cup S_{i-1}.\nWe say that t𝑡t is the activation time tτ​(S0)subscript𝑡𝜏subscript𝑆0t_{\\tau}(S_{0}) of the target set S0subscript𝑆0S_{0},\nsince this represents an activation process starting with S0subscript𝑆0S_{0}: initially all vertices in the target set S0subscript𝑆0S_{0} become active, the other vertices are inactive, and active vertices remain active forever (that is, it is an irreversible and monotone process). At any step of the process, each inactive vertex gets activated if the number of its active neighbors is at least its threshold. The process is synchronous, that is, all inactive vertices update their status at the same time in each step of the process. The Influence Maximization problem, that consists in finding a subset of vertices of size k𝑘k that maximizes the expected number of vertices activated by the process described above in a given graph, was first studied by Kempe et al.   with thresholds randomly chosen from a given range. The TSS model defined above (with deterministic thresholds) was introduced in , where the considered problem was to find a target set S0subscript𝑆0S_{0} of minimum size. Let us call this problem TSS-size.\nSince then, a number of articles investigated the TSS-size problem      0  . For a TSS model, there may exist different targets sets (of minimum size or not), yielding different activation times.\nMotivated by a recent line of research arising from a question of Bollobás on extremal properties of a closely related model discussed below (see the introduction of  and  for a detailed discussion), we define the following parameter: the maximum activation time tτ​(G)subscript𝑡𝜏𝐺t_{\\tau}(G) of a TSS model (G,τ)𝐺𝜏(G,\\tau) is the maximum tτ​(S0)subscript𝑡𝜏subscript𝑆0t_{\\tau}(S_{0}) among all target sets S0subscript𝑆0S_{0} of G𝐺G.\nWe consider the complexity of the decision version of the problem of determining tτ​(G)subscript𝑡𝜏𝐺t_{\\tau}(G), defined as follows. \n\n\nTarget Set Selection-Time (TSS-time)\nInstance: A graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E), a threshold function τ:V​(G)→ℕ:𝜏→𝑉𝐺ℕ\\tau:V(G)\\to\\mathbb{N},\nand a positive integer k𝑘k.\nQuestion: Is tτ​(G)≥ksubscript𝑡𝜏𝐺𝑘t_{\\tau}(G)\\geq k?\n For an instance (G,τ,k)𝐺𝜏𝑘(G,\\tau,k) of the TSS-time problem, we let τ∗:=maxv∈V​(G)⁡τ​(v)assignsuperscript𝜏subscript𝑣𝑉𝐺𝜏𝑣\\tau^{*}:=\\max_{v\\in V(G)}\\tau(v). To the best of our knowledge, the above problem had not been considered before (we discuss related work in the next paragraph).\nClearly, we may assume G𝐺G as connected, since otherwise we may solve the problem independently in each connected component. Intuition suggests that the maximum time of activation processes might be obtained with minimum target sets, but this is not true in general. For example, Figure 1 depicts a tree T𝑇T formed by a root vertex v𝑣v together with k+1𝑘1k+1 disjoint induced paths on t𝑡t vertices, v𝑣v being adjacent to an endvertex of each path, for positive integers t𝑡t and k>1𝑘1k>1. The thresholds are in red and the target sets are marked in gray. Figure 1(a) represents the (unique) minimum target set S𝑆S of T𝑇T of size one (containing the root v𝑣v) with activation time t𝑡t (achieved at the leaves of T𝑇T). Figure 1(b) shows a target set S′superscript𝑆′S^{\\prime} of size k𝑘k given by any k𝑘k leaves of T𝑇T, with activation time 2​t2𝑡2t (achieved at the leaf labeled ut,k+1subscript𝑢𝑡𝑘1u_{t,k+1}).\nThus, the difference between the cardinalities of a minimum target set and of a target set achieving the maximum activation time can be arbitrarily large. There are several recent articles in the literature dealing with problems similar to TSS-time, but considering different models or different activation processes. For example, the r𝑟r-neighbor bootstrap percolation model        8 2 is almost equivalent to the TSS model with all thresholds being equal to r𝑟r but it accepts thresholds greater than the degree of a vertex.\nMotivated by this, we define a generalized threshold function in a graph G𝐺G as any function τ′:V​(G)→ℕ:superscript𝜏′→𝑉𝐺ℕ\\tau^{\\prime}:V(G)\\to\\mathbb{N}. Thus, a threshold function τ𝜏\\tau is a generalized threshold function satisfying 1≤τ​(v)≤d​(v)1𝜏𝑣𝑑𝑣1\\leq\\tau(v)\\leq d(v) for any vertex v𝑣v of G𝐺G.\nLet the generalized TSS model be the analogous of TSS model with generalized threshold functions, instead of threshold functions.\nHence, for an integer r>0𝑟0r>0, the r𝑟r-neighbor bootstrap percolation model is equivalent to the generalized TSS model with all thresholds equal to r𝑟r.\nThe r𝑟r-Neighbor Bootstrap Percolation-time and Generalized Target Set Seletion-time (GTSS-time for short) problems are defined analogously to TSS-time for the corresponding models. Observe that, for those problems, vertices whose threshold is greater than its degree must be in any target set (activation time 0) and vertices with threshold 0 are always activated at time at most 1. Considering the 222-neighbor bootstrap percolation model and the parameter tP3​(G)subscript𝑡subscript𝑃3𝐺t_{P_{3}}(G) (the analogous to the parameter tτ​(G)subscript𝑡𝜏𝐺t_{\\tau}(G) defined above for our problem), Przykucki  determined the value of the maximum percolation time on the hypercube 2[n]superscript2delimited-[]𝑛2^{[n]} as a function of n𝑛n, and Benevides and Przykucki 3 4 obtained similar results for the square grid [n]2superscriptdelimited-[]𝑛2[n]^{2}.\nIt was also proved that deciding whether tP3​(G)≥ksubscript𝑡subscript𝑃3𝐺𝑘t_{P_{3}}(G)\\geq k is polynomial-time solvable for fixed k≤3𝑘3k\\leq 3 , and \\NP-complete for fixed k≥4𝑘4k\\geq 4 1.\nIn bipartite graphs, it is polynomial-time solvable for fixed k≤4𝑘4k\\leq 4 and \\NP-complete for fixed k≥5𝑘5k\\geq 5 .\nFinally, it was proved in 0 that 222-Neighbor Bootstrap Percolation-time is \\W-hard parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph. Clearly, all these hardness results extend to Generalized TSS-time. However, they cannot be applied directly to TSS-time, since all these hardness reductions use vertices of degree 1, which have an important role in them, and which are not allowed in our setting when all thresholds are equal to 2. In the Geodesic (resp. Monophonic) Convexity-time problem, threshold functions are not taken into account, and at any step of the activation process, each inactive vertex gets activated if it is in a shortest (resp. induced) path between two activate vertices. The maximum activation time obtained in these processes\nhas been studied 0 2 6. For each parameter, deciding if its value is greater or equal to k𝑘k (for fixed k𝑘k) is \\NP-complete when k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2 and k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1, respectively, and the input graph is bipartite 2 6. Both problems are polynomial-time solvable for distance-hereditary graphs 2. With respect to the parameterized complexity of these problems, the published articles mainly focus on the generalized version of the TSS-size problem, for which there are no degree restrictions on the threshold function, denoted by Generalized TSS-size, and the cases in which the maximum threshold is small or the threshold of every vertex is at least half of its degree. Namely, Generalized TSS-size is FPT parameterized by the size of a minimum vertex cover  , and \\W-hard for each of the following parameterizations: distance to cluster , neighborhood diversity 4, and distance to forest and pathwidth .\nThe case when all thresholds are exactly half of the degree for each vertex is also \\W-hard parameterized by pathwidth .\nFor constant thresholds, the problem becomes FPT parameterized by distance to cluster , by neighborhood diversity 4, and by treewidth 0. Ben-Zwi et al. 0 also proved that TSS-size cannot be solved in 𝒪​(n𝗍𝗐​(G))𝒪superscript𝑛𝗍𝗐𝐺\\mathcal{O}(n^{\\sqrt{{\\sf tw}(G)}}) time, where n𝑛n and 𝗍𝗐​(G)𝗍𝗐𝐺{\\sf tw}(G) denote the number of vertices and the treewidth of the input graph G𝐺G, respectively.\nRecently, Hartmann 1 gave an FPT algorithm for TSS-size parameterized by clique-width and the maximum value of the threshold function. Cicalese et al. 4 3 considered the problem in which the number of rounds of the process is bounded. For graphs of bounded clique-width, given parameters a𝑎a, b𝑏b, ℓℓ\\ell, they gave polynomial-time algorithms to determine whether there exists a target set of size b𝑏b, such that at least a𝑎a vertices are activated in at most ℓℓ\\ell time steps. Our results and techniques. In this paper we initiate an analysis of the computational complexity of the TSS-time problem, in particular from the viewpoint of parameterized complexity.\nWe start by showing that reductions of 1 and 0 for the 2-Neighbor Bootstrap Percolation-time problem can be easily adapted in order to prove that TSS-time is \\NP-hard in planar graphs and graphs of bounded degree, and \\W-hard when parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph (Corollary 3.6).\nWe then provide \\NP-completeness results for fixed values of the activation time k𝑘k and the value τ∗=maxv∈V​(G)⁡τ​(v)superscript𝜏subscript𝑣𝑉𝐺𝜏𝑣\\tau^{*}=\\max_{v\\in V(G)}\\tau(v). Namely, by adapting another reduction in 1 from 333-Sat, we prove (Theorem 3.7) that TSS-time is \\NP-complete in general graphs for any fixed k≥4𝑘4k\\geq 4 and τ∗=2superscript𝜏2\\tau^{*}=2. This result is sharp in terms of τ∗superscript𝜏\\tau^{*} since, as we observe in Lemma 3.5, the problem can be easily solved in polynomial time when τ∗=1superscript𝜏1\\tau^{*}=1. By reducing from the Restricted Planar 333-Sat problem 9 instead of 333-Sat and modifying appropriately the planar embedding given by the incidence graph of the formula, we prove (Theorem 3.9) that TSS-time remains \\NP-complete for any fixed k≥4𝑘4k\\geq 4 and τ∗=2superscript𝜏2\\tau^{*}=2 even if the input graph is an apex graph, that is, a graph in which there exists a vertex whose removal yields a planar graph. Finally, by modifying the reduction of Theorem 3.7 by using bipartite gadgets, we prove (Theorem 3.12) that TSS-time\nis \\NP-complete in bipartite graphs for any fixed k≥5𝑘5k\\geq 5 and τ∗=2superscript𝜏2\\tau^{*}=2. Motivated by these \\NP-completeness results, we study the parameterized complexity of the TSS-time problem considering k𝑘k and τ∗superscript𝜏\\tau^{*} as parameters.\nWe manage to provide a dichotomy on the complexity of TSS-time when the input graph G𝐺G belongs to a minor-closed graph class 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C}. Namely, we prove (Theorem 4.9) that if 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C} has bounded local treewidth (cf. Section 2 for the definition), then TSS-time is FPT with parameters k𝑘k and τ∗superscript𝜏\\tau^{*}; otherwise it is \\NP-complete for any fixed k≥4𝑘4k\\geq 4 and τ∗=2superscript𝜏2\\tau^{*}=2. Note that, as discussed above, TSS-time is \\NP-hard in planar graphs (even with τ∗=2superscript𝜏2\\tau^{*}=2), which is a minor-closed graph class of bounded local treewidth, and therefore in our complexity dichotomy, “FPT” cannot be replaced by “solvable in polynomial time”. It is pertinent to mention here that the title of the article of Ben-Zwi et al. 0 is “treewidth governs the complexity of target set selection”, referring to the TSS-size problem. In this spirit, one of the the main conclusions of our article is that “local treewidth governs the complexity of target set selection with maximum activation time”. Let us now discuss how we prove Theorem 4.9. In order to prove this dichotomy, on the positive side we provide (Theorem 4.7) an FPT algorithm for the generalized version of the problem, namely GTSS-time, with parameters k𝑘k and τ∗superscript𝜏\\tau^{*} when the input graph G𝐺G belongs to a graph class 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C} of bounded local treewidth (not necessarily minor-closed). In order to do this, we first observe (Lemma 4.1) that, for any instance (G,τ,k)𝐺𝜏𝑘(G,\\tau,k) of GTSS-time,\ntτ​(G)≥ksubscript𝑡𝜏𝐺𝑘t_{\\tau}(G)\\geq k if and only if there exists a target set activating G𝐺G at time exactly k𝑘k. We then show (Lemma 4.3) that GTSS-time on an n𝑛n-vertex graph G𝐺G can be reduced to solving n𝑛n instances having as input the graph induced in G𝐺G by the k𝑘k-th neighborhood of each vertex of G𝐺G. The crucial observation is that, when G𝐺G belongs to a class of bounded local treewidth, these auxiliary graphs have treewidth bounded by a function of k𝑘k. With this at hand, we show (Lemma 4.5) that GTSS-time can be expressed by a monadic second-order logic formula whose length depends only on k𝑘k and τ𝜏\\tau, and applying Courcelle’s Theorem 7 on the linearly many bounded-treewidth auxiliary graphs yields the desired FPT algorithm. Note that, since we deal with the generalized version of the TSS-time problem, our FPT algorithm also applies to the 2-Neighbor Bootstrap Percolation problem.\nAs particular cases of graph classes with bounded local treewidth, the existence of an FPT algorithm for 2-Neighbor Bootstrap Percolation with parameter k𝑘k in graphs with bounded maximum degree was already known 9, but no FPT algorithm in planar graphs (or, more generally, graphs of bounded genus) existed prior to our work.\nNote that 2-Neighbor Bootstrap Percolation has been proved to be \\NP-complete in planar graphs by Benevides et al. 1. In this \\NP-completeness proof, the authors say that “our proof does not work when the time is fixed”; the FPT algorithm of Theorem 4.7 provides a solid explanation for that. As for the hardness part of our complexity dichotomy, we critically use a result of Eppstein 6 stating that, for minor-closed graph classes, having bounded local treewidth is equivalent to excluding some apex graph. Now, if 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C} is a minor-closed graph class of unbounded local treewidth, the previous result implies that 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C} contains all apex graphs, in particular those originated from our hardness result of Theorem 3.9 for apex input graphs, and therefore the TSS-time problem is\n\\NP-complete in 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C} for any fixed k≥4𝑘4k\\geq 4 and τ∗=2superscript𝜏2\\tau^{*}=2. Again, the same argument applies to 2-Neighbor Bootstrap Percolation-time (Corollary 3.11), hence the dichotomy in minor-closed graph classes holds for this problem as well. Finally, we provide (Theorem 5.5) an 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n)-time algorithm for the maximization version of TSS-time in trees, that is, for finding the maximum activation time of a target selection model (T,τ)𝑇𝜏(T,\\tau) where T𝑇T is a tree. Note that the FPT algorithm of Theorem 4.7 implies that deciding whether tτ​(T)≥ksubscript𝑡𝜏𝑇𝑘t_{\\tau}(T)\\geq k for a tree T𝑇T (which has treewidth one) can be solved in time f​(k,τ∗)⋅n𝒪​(1)⋅𝑓𝑘superscript𝜏superscript𝑛𝒪1f(k,\\tau^{*})\\cdot n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} for some function f𝑓f, but we provide a stronger result by showing that also the maximum activation time of a tree can be computed in polynomial (even linear) time. In order to achieve this, we prove (Lemma 5.3 and Theorem 5.5) that every path such that any internal vertex v𝑣v satisfies τ​(v)<d​(v)𝜏𝑣𝑑𝑣\\tau(v)<d(v) (we say that such a v𝑣v is non-saturated) can be activated one vertex per time step by some target set. With this, we prove that the maximum activation time in a tree is equal to the size of a maximum path such that all internal vertices are non-saturated. One interesting point here is that the threshold values are not important, but only whether a vertex is saturated or not.\nWe generalize this algorithm (Theorem 5.11) to the maximization version of GTSS-time, namely, we provide an 𝒪​(n2)𝒪superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2})-time algorithm for finding the maximum activation time of a tree T𝑇T and a generalized threshold function τ𝜏\\tau in T𝑇T.\nThe main idea is that any target set must contain the set V𝖿subscript𝑉𝖿V_{\\sf f} of “forced” vertices containing any vertex v𝑣v with τ​(v)>d​(v)𝜏𝑣𝑑𝑣\\tau(v)>d(v). With this, we start the activation process from V𝖿subscript𝑉𝖿V_{\\sf f}, obtaining the set H​(V𝖿)𝐻subscript𝑉𝖿H(V_{\\sf f}) containing the vertices that can be activated by V𝖿subscript𝑉𝖿V_{\\sf f}. We then look for certain paths representing an activation sequence, whose first vertices are activated by V𝖿subscript𝑉𝖿V_{\\sf f} and whose last vertices are non-saturated. In this case, the threshold values are important, since H​(V𝖿)𝐻subscript𝑉𝖿H(V_{\\sf f}) depends on them. Organization. In Section 2 we provide basic preliminaries about graphs, convexity, parameterized complexity, graph minors, (bounded local) treewidth, and monadic second-order logic. In Section 3 we present our \\NP-completeness results, and in Section 4 we provide the FPT algorithms for graphs of bounded local treewidth. Altogether, the results in Section 3 and Section 4 yield the complexity dichotomy for graph classes of bounded local treewidth. Section 5 is devoted to the polynomial-time algorithms for trees. We conclude the paper in Section 6 with some directions for further research."
