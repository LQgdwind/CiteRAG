    "transaction ordering": "Searchers extract MEV by manipulating the ordering of their transactions in a block with respect to victim transactions. This ordering is influenced by the incentives, such as priority fees and private transfers, offered to block producers. By offering greater incentives, searchers can prioritize their transactions and increase their profits. To promote fairness and mitigate MEV, various transaction ordering strategies have been proposed. These strategies are based on transaction submission or arrival times   [ref]19, random or deterministic sequencer  , or Market Maker (MM) designs [ref]36 . The most well-known strategy based on submission or arrival times is order fairness mechanisms such as receive order fairness, send order fairness, approximate order fairness, and block order fairness . Receive order fairness mechanism states that if a majority (more than 50%) of the validator nodes receives transaction T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} before T2subscript𝑇2T_{2}, then T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} should precede T2subscript𝑇2T_{2} in the final order of transactions . On the other hand, send order fairness states that if transaction T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} is sent before T2subscript𝑇2T_{2}, then T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} should precede T2subscript𝑇2T_{2} in the final order of transactions. Intel SGX Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)  or ARM Trustzone  could be used to verify and trust the timestamps of these transactions . However, due to network delays, achieving exact transaction ordering under the sender order fairness mechanism may not always be feasible . Consequently, approximate order fairness allows for flexibility, relaxing the strict sequencing of transactions T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} and T2subscript𝑇2T_{2} if validators receive them within a specified time window. If the majority of validator nodes receive T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} at least ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon rounds earlier than T2subscript𝑇2T_{2}, then all honest validator nodes should not deliver T2subscript𝑇2T_{2} until T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} has been delivered . These order fairness mechanisms primarily consider front-running, back-running, sandwich, arbitrage, and liquidation MEV transactions by focusing on transaction-level ordering. To address time-bandit MEV, a block order fairness mechanism is proposed. When transactions T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} and T2subscript𝑇2T_{2} are received by the validators within a specified time window, block order fairness mechanism ensures that the majority of validators receive T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} before T2subscript𝑇2T_{2}, then all honest validator nodes should not deliver T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} at a later block index than it delivers T2subscript𝑇2T_{2}  . Temporal order fairness strategies can be further extended by discretizing the time into periods measured in terms of time units or the number of blocks [ref]19. If multiple searchers submit competing transactions, then the dispute can be resolved using the Solomonic approach . This approach assumes that each transaction initiator (whether searcher or legitimate user) knows its own status. An initiator (selected randomly) is given the opportunity to withdraw their transaction. If the transaction is withdrawn, the other initiator’s transaction is executed, else the transaction amount is burned. If the legitimate initiator is given the opportunity to withdraw, they incur a loss. In contrast, if a searcher withdraws, they do not incur a loss. Both initiators incur transaction fees if they assert their transactions, which discourages searchers from making illegitimate claims. However, this approach is only suitable for mitigating replacement front-running. Furthermore, implementing and managing the random selection and token-burning mechanisms could be complex. In addition, the strategy becomes an iterative process with an increasing number of competing searchers, leading to increased costs and higher latency. The order fairness  [ref]19 strategies rely solely on transaction timestamps, which could create an unfair advantage for searchers with low-latency infrastructure [ref]8. To address this limitation, Mamageishvili et al.  proposed TimeBoost, an ordering strategy based on both transaction timestamps and gas fees. TimeBoost calculates a score for each transaction received within a specific time interval and orders transactions in descending order based on these scores. The score is determined by subtracting the transaction arrival time from a bidding function, which is defined as the ratio of t′​i​m​e​i​n​t​e​r​v​a​l×b​i​d′superscript𝑡′𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑏𝑖superscript𝑑′{}^{\\prime}time\\;interval\\times bid^{\\prime} and ∑′b​i​d​s+c​o​n​s​t​a​n​t′superscript′𝑏𝑖𝑑𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛superscript𝑡′{}^{\\prime}\\sum bids+constant^{\\prime}. The transaction priority increases with the bid. Consequently, searchers may compete by resubmitting transactions with progressively increasing bids, potentially leading to network congestion and instability. Furthermore, TimeBoost could disproportionately favor wealthy searchers who can invest in low-latency infrastructure and afford to place high bids. To prevent favoring wealthy searchers, transaction ordering strategies based on random  or deterministic  sequencers have been proposed. Sinai and Hoh In  proposed the Quantum Random Transaction Ordering Protocol (Q-RTOP), which utilizes a quantum random number generator to finalize the order of transactions within a block. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of Q-RTOP in randomizing over 8000 transactions in under 25 milliseconds. However, Q-RTOP does not guarantee that block producers will refrain from rearranging the randomized transactions to extract MEV, as proving that a block contains truly randomized transactions remains challenging. On the other hand, Doe et al.  proposed a deterministic sequencer strategy for transaction ordering based on transaction confidentiality and delay tolerance. The authors introduced a Weighted Sequencing Service (WSS) that computes the weight for each transaction based on delay tolerance, confidentiality, and transaction workload. Transactions are then ordered based on their weights. However, searchers may manipulate delay tolerance and confidentiality requirements of their transactions to influence the ordering. In the context of transaction ordering based on MM designs, Ciampi et al. [ref]36 proposed Fair Market Maker (FairMM), an AMM based on the ΠΠ\\Pi protocol that utilizes off-chain communication for transaction ordering. In this protocol, a buyer creates a smart contract specifying the required token amount and locks it on the blockchain. The buyer then sends their identity (without token details) to the seller off-chain, and the seller responds with the exchange rate. If the buyer agrees, the contract initiates the trade by forwarding trade details to a MM algorithm. The MM can then accept or decline to trade. If the MM conducts trades with other traders in between, a transaction reordering will be flagged. While FairMM does not explicitly prevent transaction reordering, it discourages malicious activities by publicly flagging any misbehavior. Furthermore, it cannot mitigate back-running transactions since a searcher can execute a transaction that back-runs the victim transaction without requiring any reordering. Empirical analysis shows that, compared to the popular AMM Uniswap, FairMM results in constant gas costs, higher throughput, and faster trade execution. Similarly, Moosavi and Clark  proposed Lissy, an alternative to traditional AMM for fair, efficient, and transparent token trading. Unlike continuous trading in an AMM, Lissy employs a call market mechanism for periodic trading, collecting orders over a set period and executing them simultaneously at a single clearing price. This approach eliminates front-running, where traders exploit timing differences to gain an advantage. However, Lissy faces scalability issues in the main Ethereum network due to periodic execution."
