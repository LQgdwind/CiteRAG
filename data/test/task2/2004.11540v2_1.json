    "pairwise registration": "In this section, we report the registration results on the test set of the 3DMatch benchmark , which contains 8 different scenes as depicted in Fig. 3.\nWe measure translation error (TE) defined in Eq. 6, rotation error (RE) defined in Eq. 7, and recall. Recall is the ratio of successful pairwise registrations and we define a registration to be successful if its rotation error and translation error are smaller than predefined thresholds.\nAverage TE and RE are computed only on these successfully registered pairs since failed registrations return poses that can be drastically different from the ground truth, making the error metrics unreliable. We compare our methods with various classical methods   [ref]45 and state-of-the-art learning based methods [ref]41   .\nAll the experiments are evaluated on an Intel i7-7700\nCPU and a GTX 1080Ti graphics card except for Go-ICP [ref]45 tested on an Intel i7-5820K\nCPU.\nIn Table 1, we measure recall with the TE threshold 30cm which is typical for indoor scene relocalization [ref]30, and RE threshold 15 degrees which is practical for partially overlapping scans from our experiments. In Fig. 4, we plot the sensitivity of recall on both thresholds by changing one threshold and setting the other to infinity. Fig. 5 includes detailed statistics on separate test scenes. Our system outperforms all the baselines on recall by a large margin and achieves the lowest translation and rotation error consistently on most scenes. Classical methods.\nTo compare with classical methods, we evaluate point-to-point ICP, Point-to-plane ICP, RANSAC , and FGR , all implemented in Open3D . In addition, we test the open-source Python bindings of Go-ICP [ref]45 and Super4PCS 9.\nFor RANSAC and FGR, we extract FPFH from voxel-downsampled point clouds.\nThe results are shown in Table 1. ICP variants mostly fail as the dataset contains challenging 3D scan sequences with small overlap and large camera viewpoint change.\nSuper4PCS, a sampling-based algorithm, performs similarly to Go-ICP, an ICP variant with branch-and-bound search. Feature-based methods, FGR and RANSAC, perform better. When aligning 5cm-voxel-downsampled point clouds, RANSAC achieves recall as high as 70%, while FGR reaches 40%.\nTable 1 also shows that increasing the number of RANSAC iterations by a factor of 2 only improves performance marginally.\nNote that our method is about twice as fast as RANSAC with 2M iterations while achieving higher recall and registration accuracy. Learning-based methods.\nWe use 3DRegNet , Deep Closest Point (DCP) [ref]41, PRNet , and PointNetLK  as our baselines. We train all the baselines on 3DMatch with the same setup and data augmentation as ours for all experiments. For 3DRegNet, we follow the setup outlined in , except that we do not manually filter outliers with ground truth, and train and test with the standard realistic setup. We find that\nthe registration loss of 3DRegNet does not converge during training and the rotation and translation errors are consistently above 30 degrees and 1m during test. We train Deep Closest Point (DCP) with 1024 randomly sampled points for each point cloud for 150 epochs [ref]41. We initialize the network with the pretrained weights provided by the authors.\nAlthough the training loss converges, DCP fails to achieve reasonable performance for point clouds with partial overlap.\nDCP uses a singly stochastic matrix to find correspondences, but this formulation assumes that all points in point cloud X𝑋X have at least one corresponding point in the convex hull of point cloud Y𝑌Y. This assumption fails when some points in X𝑋X have no corresponding points in Y𝑌Y, as is the case for partially overlapping fragments.\nWe also tried to train PRNet  on our setup, but failed to get reasonable results due to random crashes and high-variance training losses. Lastly, we fine-tune PointNetLK  on 3DMatch for 400 epochs, starting from the pretrained weights provided by the authors.\nPointNetLK uses a single feature that is globally pooled for each point cloud and regresses the relative pose between objects, and we suspect that a globally pooled feature fails to capture complex scenes such as 3DMatch. In conclusion, while working well on object-centric synthetic datasets, current end-to-end registration approaches fail on real-world data. Unlike synthetic data, real 3D point cloud pairs contain multiple objects, partial scans, self-occlusion, substantial noise, and may have only a small degree of overlap between scans."
