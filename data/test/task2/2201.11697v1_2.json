    "related works": "Current SGG models aim to find better feature extraction architectures [ref]7, [ref]8, , , , , or address the bias of the relationship prediction process, caused by the long-tail data distribution , , , , [ref]28, . Besides [ref]28, which utilizes a causal inference,\nalmost all of them tend to formulate the SGG task using a mean field variational Bayesian framework. Specifically, the unconstrained variational inference objective is generally minimized by means of message-passing neural network structures, while the classical cross-entropy loss is often applied to train the associated learning frameworks. Such formulation has became a universal corner stone for almost all the current SGG tasks. In contrast, our proposed method presents an alternative SGG methodology, which constructs a constrained variational inference objective, and applies generic constrained optimization algorithms, rather than message-passing, to infer the optimum interpretation. It has been developed by investigating generic constrained optimization scenarios and by exploring the alternative inference strategies, which would further improve the applicability and diversity of the SGG methods. Since the explicit variational inference objective is not required in message-passing based MFVB frameworks, the current SGG models do not need to specify the energy function or the scoring function for the input image xùë•x and the output interpretation zùëßz. More specifically, given the input and output variables, energy function measures their dissimilarities, while scoring function gauges the corresponding similarities. Energy-based models (EBMs) ,  aim to capture the dependencies among variables by associating a scalar energy to each potential configuration of the variables, which is generally non-probabilistic and can be converted to a probabilistic model, assuming the partition function can easily be computed or approximated. Such energy-based formulation is rarely investigated in the current SGG literature and it is only explored by one recently proposed method . However, the contrastive divergence loss applied in the above method may have mode collapse issue , which could underestimate the underlying posterior. Unlike the above energy-based algorithm, the proposed method approximates the associated partition function within the proposed MFVB framework. From a broad perspective, scene graph generation is a type of structured prediction tasks, which naturally inherits its unique properties and solutions. Traditional techniques like Conditional Random Field (CRF)  or Structured Support Vector Machine (SSVM)  provide some basic ways to predict structured outputs z‚àósuperscriptùëßz^{*} from the input image xùë•x. However, these techniques are quite outdated in the current deep learning era. Therefore, several modern structured prediction methodologies , ,  have been proposed in recent years, which leverage the powers of both classical structured prediction techniques and modern deep learning architectures. The representation learning capabilities of these techniques are greatly improved, which paves the way for extending them to more challenging applications. Following this direction, we propose a novel constrained structure learning methodology, which demonstrates its superior scalability and efficiency in complex SGG tasks."
