    "time-varying metric spaces": "We now review works which analyze the topological structure of time-varying metric spaces. In the proof-of-concept paper¬†, Topaz et al.¬†develop the crocker plot and apply it to four realizations of numerical simulations arising from the influential biological aggregation models of Vicsek¬† and D‚ÄôOrsogna¬†.\nTraditionally, order parameters derived from physics, such as polarization of group motion, angular momentum, etc., are calculated to assess structural differences in simulations.\nThe authors compare these order parameters to the topological crocker plot approach and discover that the latter reveals dynamic changes of these time-varying systems not captured by the former. Ulmer et al.¬† use crocker plots to analyze the fit of two mathematical, random walk models developed by¬†[ref]47 to experimental data of pea aphid movement.\nOne model incorporates social interaction of the aphids, which is thought to be of importance for pea aphid movement, while the other is a control model.\nThe authors compare time-varying data from the models to time-varying data from the experiments using statistical tests on three metrics (order parameters commonly used in collective motion studies, order parameters that use a priori input knowledge of the models, and the topological crocker plots).\nThe topological approach performs as well as the order parameters that require prior knowledge of the models and better than the ones that do not require prior knowledge, indicating that the topological approach may be useful to adopt when one has little information about underlying model mechanics. Bhaskar et al.¬† use crocker plots coupled with machine learning for parameter recovery in the model of D‚ÄôOrsogna¬†.\nThe authors generate a large corpus of simulations with varying parameters, which result in different phenotypic patterns of the simulation.\nFor instance, over time, the particles may exhibit the structure of a single or double mill, collectively swarm together, or escape.\nEach simulation is then transformed into a feature vector that summarizes the dynamics: either the aforementioned time series of order parameters (polarization, angular momentum, absolute angular momentum, average distance to nearest neighbors, or the concatenation of all four) or vectorized crocker plots corresponding to 0-dimensional homology H0subscriptùêª0H_{0}, 1-dimensional homology H1subscriptùêª1H_{1}, or the concatenation of the two.\nThe feature vectors are then fed into both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms in order to deduce phenotypic patterns or underlying parameters.\nIn all cases, the topological approach gives far more accurate results than the order parameters, even with no underlying knowledge of the dynamics. While these papers highlight that the crocker representation can be effective at modeling time-varying data and is amenable as a feature vector for machine learning tasks, crocker plots do not consider the persistence of topological features.\nAt each time step, a crocker plot summarizes only Betti numbers at each scale independently.\nFor example, while a H1subscriptùêª1H_{1} crocker plot contains the topological information about the number of topological 1-dimensional holes at each scale, it does not encode the information of the scales when holes first appear and subsequently disappear.\nAs a result, crocker plots cannot show if the 1-dimensional holes at two different scales are in fact the same features or different.\nAlso as mentioned above, crocker plots are not stable.\nIn other words, small perturbations in dynamic metric spaces can produce changes of unbounded size in crocker plots, exemplified by Example¬†2.\nWe address this problem and develop a persistent version of crocker plots, a crocker stack, introduced in Section¬†4, which can capture persistent structural features of time-varying systems. In contrast to the crocker plot approach, Corcoran et al.¬† model swarm behavior of fish by computing persistent topological features using zigzag persistent homology¬† .\nBriefly, a zigzag persistence module connects topological spaces via inclusion maps using either forward or backward arrows and tracks topological features through these inclusions.\nThe authors use inclusions from two consecutive time steps to the union of these time steps to track the evolution of features through time.\nThe resulting persistence diagram is transformed to a persistence landscape¬†, which is a stable functional representation related to the rank invariant.\nThe persistence landscape exists in a normed vector space, and as such, the authors of¬† use statistical tests to cluster swarm behavior of fish into frequently occurring behaviors named flock, torus, and disordered.\nHowever, while this method is persistent in time, to compute zigzag persistent homology for a fixed scale parameter requires a priori knowledge of the underlying data to choose an appropriate scale. In a more theoretical exploration, Kim and M√©moli¬†6 develop persistent homology summaries of time-varying data by encoding a finite dynamic metric space as a zigzag persistence module.\nThey prove that the resulting persistence diagram is stable under perturbations of the input dynamic graph in relation to defined distances on the dynamic graphs.\nIn a related research direction, these authors also consider an invariant for dynamic metric spaces in¬†.\nThey introduce a spatiotemporal filtration which can measure subtle differences between pairs of dynamic metric spaces.\nBy producing a 3D persistence module where one of the dimensions is not the real line but a poset, the invariant obtains higher differentiability power than a vineyard representation.\nIntuitively,¬† considers smoothings in both time and space.\nBy contrast, crocker stacks focus on smoothings in space alone, with the goal of obtaining vectorizable summaries as input for machine learning tasks. To a lesser degree, our techniques are also related to multiparameter persistence¬†       as we compare how time-varying metric spaces evolve in both the parameters of time and scale.\nHowever, unlike the scale parameter, there is not inclusion from one time step to the next, and as such, there is not an increasing filtration in time.\nSee also¬† for a functorial model of time, discretized using cellular cosheaves.\nThe papers¬†[ref]1     consider time-varying notions of topology applied to coverage problems in mobile sensor networks."
