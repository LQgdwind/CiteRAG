    "synapse capacity": "The capabilities of fan-in and fan-out within each neuron core profoundly impact the chip‚Äôs overall capacity of synapses, as detailed in Table 3. Darwin3 distinguishes itself with its adaptive axon-out and axon-in memory configuration, coupled with efficient compression mechanisms, enabling remarkable fan-in and fan-out capacities of up to (D1subscriptùê∑1D_{1}-1) * M * N and (D2subscriptùê∑2D_{2}-N) * N2, respectively. In the case of Darwin3, the compression mechanism yields a maximum fan-in improvement of 1024x and a maximum fan-out improvement of 2048x when compared to the physical memory depth. While the previous discussion delved into fan-in and fan-out capabilities, focusing on the synaptic connectivity potential, the challenge of efficiently storing synaptic weight parameters remains crucial. In Figure 4 (a), we present a comparative analysis of weight storage requirements, highlighting the stark contrast between Darwin3 and existing approaches when applied to typical networks converted from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Chips lacking specialized compression mechanisms exhibit dense weight matrices, making memory usage 6.8 to 200 times larger than the original approach. In crossbar designs, neurons consistently occupy their unique space, contributing to additional inefficiencies. Darwin3 employs a versatile mechanism by classifying convolutional connections into weight-sharing multi-to-multi forms and obtains storage parity with the initial parameters, thereby achieving efficiency comparable to Loihi2. Importantly, this advantage extends to non-convolutional connections featuring shared weight parameters. Darwin3 enables instructional access to the complete axon-in, thus realizing the factorized attribute, which is also supported by Loihi2, through multiplication operations. Furthermore, Darwin3 offers compatibility with diverse weight-bit widths, enhancing its adaptability and storage efficiency.
