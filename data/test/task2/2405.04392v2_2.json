    "ii-a similarity measurement approaches": "To deal with motion similarity measurement across diverse contexts, several approaches have been developed in the literature. We divide them into three main categories. 1) Machine learning approaches aim to learn general motion models from different example motions, identifying consistent salient features while disregarding variable contextual features. In these approaches, a motion is deemed similar to the learned model if it shares the same salient features.\nMachine learning approaches are particularly effective when abundant data is available.\nA drawback of these approaches is the limited extrapolation capability of the learned models, hindering generalization to contexts that are not represented in the examples. This issue can be mitigated by providing the learning algorithm with abundant motion examples in various contexts. For example, generalization across different camera viewpoints can be achieved using a multi-camera setup, or by mimicking different viewpoints by artificially rotating the motion examples . Despite the potential, generating abundant motion examples can be laborious, especially within a robot Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) framework, in which a limited number of demonstrations is highly desired. 2) Context alignment approaches aim to learn motion models by initially aligning the contexts of the example motions and subsequently deriving models from these aligned examples. The similarity between a new motion and the learned model is assessed by first aligning the context of the novel motion with that of the learned model and afterwards comparing the aligned motions. Common alignment methods include spatial alignments to address different viewpoints and locations, and temporal alignments to handle different time scales and time profiles.\nSpatial alignment often relies on finding an affine transformation that optimally maps one motion onto another. For example, the approach in  searches for projection matrices to align 2D motion features, while the approach in  seeks orthogonal transformations to align 3D motion features.\nTemporal alignment involves finding the optimal time-warping path. Common algorithms include Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Edit Distance, Longest Common Subsequence, and Fréchet Distance, with recent overviews provided in  and . DTW appears to be the most widely used option given its implementation in many recent works          . However, simultaneously aligning both spatial and temporal features poses a complex problem.\nFor example,  addresses aligning two curves under scaling, Euclidean transformation, and occlusion(s), with the proposed alignment method requiring search space pruning and heuristic search methods due to computational challenges. Another drawback is that assessing the similarity of a motion with previously established motion models requires pairwise context alignments with each model. This results in long computation times, particularly when dealing with a large number of motion models.\nHence, context alignment methods are particularly effective when only a small amount of data is available and the total computation cost to assess the similarity between motions is not prohibitive. 3) Invariant descriptor approaches remove the context from the example motions to obtain context-invariant motion descriptors from which an invariant motion model is derived. The similarity between a new motion and the invariant model is assessed by comparing the invariant description of the new motion to this model. An important advantage of this approach is that the invariant descriptor of one example motion can already be considered as a general motion model. This allows to significantly reduce the number of example motions to learn a model that can generalize across diverse contexts. For example, in , the reproduction of numerous motion variants from one individual invariant descriptor is shown. Invariant descriptor methods can be classified in global and local approaches. The global approach aims to find a global data-driven reference frame in which to express the motion data in an invariant way, for example using a singular value decomposition  or least-squares optimization . Global invariant approaches are particularly effective when only a small amount of data is available, the available data is segmented, and a low computation cost to evaluate the similarity between motions is required.\nThe local approach aims to find a local invariant description of the trajectory by describing its local shape.\nLocal approaches are particularly effective when only a small amount of data is available, the data is unsegmented, and they offer versatility for handling occlusions and performing segmentation tasks. A downside of local descriptors is their sensitivity to sensor noise and singularities in the trajectory, such as a straight line part or an inflection point, making them difficult to calculate in these situations. Originally, invariant descriptors were proposed for motion analysis and recognition applications  . Recently, there is more attention to their use for motion reproduction  and adaptation applications. Descriptors that contain sufficient information to reproduce of the original trajectory from the invariant descriptor are also referred to as complete , generative , or bidirectional  descriptors. Their benefit lies in the formulation of similarity measures that are applicable to both motion recognition and generation applications. The above three approaches to measure motion similarity across diverse contexts are not mutually exclusive. A lot of strategies in recent works combine above approaches to cope with some of the mentioned downsides.\nAs a first example, the approaches in  and  use invariant descriptors to decouple the context-alignment problem. That is, the temporal alignment between the curves is first found using features that are invariant to spatial transformations. Afterwards, based on the found temporal correspondence, the spatial alignment is found. As a second example, invariant descriptors are also used for dataset augmentation[ref]25 in machine learning, such as in  and . As a final example, the invariant descriptor approach can also be used for feature engineering, meaning the conversion of raw data into a feature vector containing invariant and contextual features, providing a richer description of the motion compared to raw data. The method in  combined invariant and contextual features and showed an increase in motion recognition performance, especially when motions with similar invariant features had to be distinguished. To conclude, the three approaches (machine learning, context alignment, and invariant descriptor) have their respective requirements, advantages, and drawbacks. In this paper, we focus on the invariant descriptor approach and aim to alleviate some of its drawbacks. The benefit of alleviating the drawbacks of the invariant descriptor approach is twofold. It supports the further application of the invariant descriptor approach for motion recognition and generation in diverse contexts. Additionally, it supports the further combination with other approaches (machine learning, context alignment) to alleviate some of their mentioned drawbacks."
