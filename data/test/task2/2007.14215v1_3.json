    "iii-b sias": "SIAs are a type of nature-inspired algorithms based on interaction among living organisms . They can be described by the collective behaviors of living organisms working under specific rules. Some commonly used SIAs in CC and EC are discussed in the following: Particle swarm optimization (PSO) was proposed by Kennedy and Eberhart  in 1995. It is inspired by the social behaviors of the groups of population in nature such as animal herds, bird flocking, or schooling of fish. In PSO, a population of particles is first generated. In each iteration, each particle has an adaptable velocity, according to which it moves in the search space to update position and velocity. Moreover, each particle has a memory, remembering the best position it has ever visited. Thus, its movement is an aggregated acceleration toward its best previously visited position and the best position ever detected/visited by the swarm . This process continues until the stopping criterion is met. PSO has been used to tackle issues in CC   . Ant colony optimization (ACO), introduced in the early 1990​s1990𝑠1990s by Dorigo et al.  , is a technique for optimization. The inspiring source of ACO is the foraging behavior of real ant colonies. In ACO, firstly a finite set of solution components is derived. Secondly, one has to define a set of pheromone values called the pheromone model, which is one of the central components of ACO. In each iteration, ACO assigns higher pheromone values to good solution components probabilistically. ACO has been applied to address job scheduling and resource allocation in CC and EC    .\n Bee algorithm (BA), introduced by Pham in 2005, is inspired by the natural foraging behavior of honey bees. In BA, the agent population is divided into a small set of scouts and a larger set of foragers. The scouts randomly sample in the solution space, and evaluate the visited flower patches (i.e., locations). In each iteration, BA compares the new solutions discovered by the scouts with the best-so-far solution. The solutions are ordered according to their fitness values, and the highest ranking ones are selected for local search. BA performs exploitative neighborhood search and random explorative search. BA has been applied to job scheduling in CC and EC   . Cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) is inspired by the living behaviour of a kind of bird named cuckoo and was developed by Yang and Deb in 200920092009 . In CSA, the adult cuckoos lay eggs in the habitat of other birds. If these eggs are not found and thrown by host birds, they grow and become mature cuckoos. CSA begins with a primary population i.e., a group of cuckoos. In each iteration, CSA performs the following steps. First, individuals are generated by making modifications in existing individuals. After that, the new individuals are evaluated by the fitness function. The new individuals are compared with existing individuals, if they are better than existing individuals, they replace existing individuals in the population. Job scheduling in CC and EC has been addressed by using CSA  . Firefly algorithm (FA) was developed by Yang  in 2008. It is inspired by the flashing pattern and behavior of fireflies. In FA, a population of fireflies is generated randomly. In each iteration, one firefly can be fascinated by other fireflies regardless of its sex. The less brighter firefly is fascinated by the brighter one in the population. The brightness of a firefly is set on the landscape of the fitness function . In case there is no brighter one, the fireflies move randomly and form a new population for the next iteration. The light intensity of fireflies is updated by evaluating the new population. Resource allocation and job scheduling in CC and EC have been tackled by using FA   . Bacterial foraging algorithm (BFA) is a swarm optimization algorithm inspired by colonies of escherichia coli and proposed by Passino . In BFA, individuals are first generated randomly. Then, for all individuals, the chemotaxis process is carried out. The process in which an organism moves with the gradient of a substance concentration is called chemotaxis. After the chemotaxis process, individuals are reproduced and dispersed. Elimination-dispersion is applied as a final step, in which many random individuals are eliminated and many new individuals are generated. BFA has been used for job scheduling in CC  [ref]96."
