    "proofs for section 6: omitting types": "This section contains proofs of the theorems stated in Section 6. See 6.1 Combining the results of  [ref]27 and , 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} has bounded width if and only if no subalgebra of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} has a nontrivial abelian quotient. The proof of Theorem 2.8 in 0 shows that this is also equivalent to having wnu term operations of every arity n≥3𝑛3n\\geq 3. Thus, (ii), (iii), and (iv) are equivalent.\nTo show that (ii) implies (i), it suffices to observe that if 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} contains an abelian edge (a,b)𝑎𝑏(a,b) and congruence θ𝜃\\theta witnesses that, then the algebra Sg𝐀⁡(a,b)/θsubscriptSg𝐀𝑎𝑏𝜃\\operatorname{Sg}_{\\mathbf{A}}(a,b)/\\theta is abelian.\nFinally, to show that (i) implies (ii), assume that there is a subalgebra 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and a congruence θ𝜃\\theta on 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} such that 𝐁/θ𝐁𝜃\\mathbf{B}/\\theta is abelian. Then for any a,b𝑎𝑏a,b from different equivalence classes of θ𝜃\\theta, the pair (a,b)𝑎𝑏(a,b) is an abelian edge.\n∎ See 6.2 First, to show that (i) implies (ii) let B​⊴2​𝐀′≤𝐀𝐵subscript⊴2superscript𝐀′𝐀B\\trianglelefteq_{2}\\mathbf{A}^{\\prime}\\leq\\mathbf{A}. If B𝐵B is a nonempty proper subset of A′superscript𝐴′A^{\\prime}, then Proposition 9.7 gives us a minimal semilattice edge in 𝐀′superscript𝐀′\\mathbf{A}^{\\prime} and thus in 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}, a contradiction. By Theorem 2.12. of [ref]12 the existence of a 3-edge term operation is equivalent to a so-called 3-cube operation and then (ii) implies (iii) follows from Theorem 4.5 in  (see also ) which provides a 3-cube operation whenever Clo⁡(𝐀)Clo𝐀\\operatorname{Clo}(\\mathbf{A}) is generated by a single ternary operation (which is the case by Theorem 5.24) and\nno subalgebra of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} has a nontrivial projective subuniverse (which is the case by Proposition 8.2). From [ref]12 it follows that (iii) implies (iv) – it is proved there that the existence of an edge (or cube) term operation is equivalent to having few subpowers. Finally, we show that (iv) implies (i). If 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} contains a semilattice edge, then by Theorem 5.13(a) it also has a subalgebra term equivalent to a 2-element semilattice. It is known from [ref]12  that a semilattice does not have few subpowers.\n∎ See 6.3 To see that (i) implies (ii) recall that 3-absorbing subuniverses and centers are the same by Theorem 5.10, that 3-absorbing subuniverses are stable under abelian and semilattice edges by Theorem 5.21, and that\n2-absorbing subuniverses are exactly those stable under all the edges by Theorem 5.19.\nBy item (4) in Proposition 5.9, (ii) implies (ii’). The fact that every majority edge defines two disjoint 3-absorbing subuniverses shows that (ii’) implies (i).\n∎ Before proving Theorem 6.4, we first verify one of the implications. If 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is a minimal Taylor algebra without majority edges and ℤ/2ℤ2\\mathbb{Z}/{2}-edges, then 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} has a commutative binary term operation. By Lemma 4.4 in  it is enough to show that for any a,b∈𝐀𝑎𝑏𝐀a,b\\in\\mathbf{A} there is a term operation f𝑓f such that f​(a,b)=f​(b,a)𝑓𝑎𝑏𝑓𝑏𝑎f(a,b)=f(b,a), or in other words that the binary symmetric subpower Sg𝐀2⁡((a,b),(b,a))subscriptSgsuperscript𝐀2𝑎𝑏𝑏𝑎\\operatorname{Sg}_{\\mathbf{A}^{2}}((a,b),(b,a)) of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} contains a tuple of the form (c,c)𝑐𝑐(c,c). Observe that, conversely, any symmetric nonempty binary subpower of an algebra with a commutative binary term operation intersects the diagonal. Let 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} be a minimal counterexample to the proposition with respect to |A|𝐴|A| and choose a,b∈A𝑎𝑏𝐴a,b\\in A such that S=Sg⁡{(a,b),(b,a)}𝑆Sg𝑎𝑏𝑏𝑎S=\\operatorname{Sg}\\{(a,b),(b,a)\\} does not intersect the diagonal.\nClearly Sg⁡(a,b)=ASg𝑎𝑏𝐴\\operatorname{Sg}(a,b)=A by minimality.\nIf 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} has a proper congruence θ𝜃\\theta, then there is some c∈𝐀𝑐𝐀c\\in\\mathbf{A} such that S∩(c/θ)2≠∅𝑆superscript𝑐𝜃2S\\cap(c/\\theta)^{2}\\neq\\emptyset (since 𝐀/θ𝐀𝜃\\mathbf{A}/\\theta is not a counterexample), but then S∩(c/θ)2≤c/θ2𝑆superscript𝑐𝜃2𝑐superscript𝜃2S\\cap(c/\\theta)^{2}\\leq c/\\theta^{2} is a binary nonempty symmetric subpower of c/θ𝑐𝜃c/\\theta that avoids the diagonal, a contradiction to the minimality of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}. Suppose now that 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} has a proper 3-absorbing subuniverse B𝐵B. If B∩(B+S)≠∅𝐵𝐵𝑆B\\cap(B+S)\\neq\\emptyset, then there exist d,e𝑑𝑒d,e such that (d,e)∈S∩B2𝑑𝑒𝑆superscript𝐵2(d,e)\\in S\\cap B^{2} (take any e∈B∩(B+S)𝑒𝐵𝐵𝑆e\\in B\\cap(B+S) and then d∈B𝑑𝐵d\\in B such that (d,e)∈S𝑑𝑒𝑆(d,e)\\in S), so since d,e𝑑𝑒d,e generate a proper subalgebra of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} we see by minimality that Sg⁡((d,e),(e,d))≤𝐒Sg𝑑𝑒𝑒𝑑𝐒\\operatorname{Sg}((d,e),(e,d))\\leq\\mathbf{S} contains a diagonal element, a contradiction.\nOn the other hand, if B∩(B+S)=∅𝐵𝐵𝑆B\\cap(B+S)=\\emptyset, then by item (2) in Proposition 5.12 E=B∪(B+S)𝐸𝐵𝐵𝑆E=B\\cup(B+S) must be a subuniverse of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} with congruence θ𝜃\\theta corresponding to the partition B,B+S𝐵𝐵𝑆B,B+S, such that 𝐄/θ𝐄𝜃\\mathbf{E}/\\theta is a two element majority algebra. Any pair in different equivalence classes is then a majority edge, a contradiction. It remains to deal with the case that 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is simple and 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} has no nontrivial 3-absorbing subuniverse. It then follows\nfrom Proposition 9.11 that 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is abelian, so 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is term equivalent to an affine Mal’cev algebra of a group isomorphic to ℤ/pℤ𝑝\\mathbb{Z}/{p}. By the absence of ℤ/2ℤ2\\mathbb{Z}/{2}-edges, p𝑝p is odd.\nMoreover,\nCorollary 4.5 implies that S𝑆S is the graph of a bijection A→A→𝐴𝐴A\\to A – the graph of an automorphism of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}. Since S𝑆S is generated by (a,b)𝑎𝑏(a,b) and (b,a)𝑏𝑎(b,a), the automorphism has order 222. But |A|=p𝐴𝑝|A|=p is odd, so α​(c)=c𝛼𝑐𝑐\\alpha(c)=c for some c𝑐c, therefore S𝑆S contains (c,c)𝑐𝑐(c,c), a contradiction.\n∎ See 6.4 By Proposition 10.1, (i) implies (iii), and\n(iii) implies (iii’) by minimality of the Taylor algebra. That (iii’) implies (i) follows from the fact that the two element majority algebra and the two element affine Mal’cev algebra both have no nontrivial binary operations.\n∎ See 6.5 To prove that (i) implies (ii) assume for contradiction that B𝐵B is a nontrivial absorbing subuniverse of 𝐀′≤𝐀superscript𝐀′𝐀\\mathbf{A}^{\\prime}\\leq\\mathbf{A}. By Corollary 4.13 there exist b∈B𝑏𝐵b\\in B and a∈A′∖B𝑎superscript𝐴′𝐵a\\in A^{\\prime}\\setminus B such that (a,b)𝑎𝑏(a,b) or (b,a)𝑏𝑎(b,a) is a minimal edge. Since 𝐀′superscript𝐀′\\mathbf{A}^{\\prime} is smsm\\mathrm{sm}-free, we get that (b,a)𝑏𝑎(b,a) (and (a,b)𝑎𝑏(a,b)) is necessarily a minimal abelian edge; let θ𝜃\\theta be a witnessing congruence of Sg⁡(b,a)Sg𝑏𝑎\\operatorname{Sg}(b,a). By Theorem 5.21, the set B𝐵B is stable under abelian edges, therefore each θ𝜃\\theta-class intersects B𝐵B, in particular there exists a′superscript𝑎′a^{\\prime} in B∩a/θ𝐵𝑎𝜃B\\cap a/\\theta. But then Sg⁡(b,a′)⊆BSg𝑏superscript𝑎′𝐵\\operatorname{Sg}(b,a^{\\prime})\\subseteq B is strictly contained in Sg⁡(b,a)Sg𝑏𝑎\\operatorname{Sg}(b,a), contradicting the minimality of the edge. Condition (ii) is the property HAF from . By Theorem 1.4 from the same paper 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} has a Mal’cev term operation, so (iii) holds. Finally, if 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} has a semilattice or a majority edge (a,b)𝑎𝑏(a,b) witnessed by a congruence θ𝜃\\theta, then the algebra Sg𝐀⁡(a,b)/θsubscriptSg𝐀𝑎𝑏𝜃\\operatorname{Sg}_{\\mathbf{A}}(a,b)/\\theta (and thus 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}) cannot have a Mal’cev term operation by Theorem 5.13. Therefore (iii) implies (i).\n∎ See 6.6 Let us show that (i) implies (iii’). Since 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} has no abelian and semilattice edges, by Theorem 5.21 every 1-element subset of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is an absorbing subuniverse. By Theorem 5.10 every such subset is also 3-absorbing. Finally, by Theorem 5.23 there exists a ternary operation f𝑓f witnessing all 3-absorptions. Since every singleton is a 3-absorbing subuniverse, f𝑓f is a majority operation. Clearly (iii’) implies (iii). Since both a two-element semilattice and\nan affine Mal’cev algebra do not have a\nnear unanimity term operation,\nby Theorem 5.13 (iii) implies (i).\n∎"
