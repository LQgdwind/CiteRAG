  "title": "Transferable Interactiveness Knowledge for Human-Object Interaction Detection",
  "sections": {
    "introduction": "Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection retrieves human and object locations and infers the interaction classes simultaneously from still image. As a sub-task of visual relationship  , HOI is strongly related to the human body and object understanding    . It is crucial for behavior understanding and can facilitate activity understanding , imitation learning , etc. Recently, impressive progress has been made by utilizing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in this area  0 1 2. Generally, humans and objects need to be detected first in HOI detection. Given an image and its detections, humans and objects are often paired exhaustively 0 2 1. HOI detection task aims to classify these pairs as various HOI categories. Previous one-stage methods  0 2 3 1 directly classify a pair as specific HOIs. These methods predict interactiveness implicitly at the same time, where interactiveness indicates whether a human-object pair is interactive. For example, when a pair is classified as “eat apple”, we can implicitly predict that it is interactive. Though interactiveness is an essential element for HOI detection, previous methods neglected to study how to utilize it and improve its learning.\nIn comparison to various HOI categories, interactiveness conveys more basic information.\nSuch an attribute makes it easier to transfer across datasets.\nBased on this inspiration, we propose a interactiveness knowledge learning method as seen in Fig. 1.\nWith our method, interactiveness can be learned across datasets and applied to any specific datasets.\nBy utilizing interactiveness, we take two stages to identify HOIs: first discriminate a human-object pair as interactive or not and then classify it as specific HOIs.\nCompared to the previous one-stage method  0 2 3 1, we take advantage of powerful interactiveness knowledge that incorporates more information from other datasets. Thus our method can decrease the false positives significantly. Additionally, after the interactiveness filtering in the first stage, we do not need to handle a large number of non-interactive pairs which are overwhelmingly more than interactive ones. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage method to classify pairs hierarchically as shown in Fig. 2. Our model, Transferable Interactiveness Network (TIN), consists of three networks: Representation Network (extractor, referred to as 𝐑𝐑\\mathbf{R}), HOI Network (classifier, referred as 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C}), and Interactiveness Network (discriminator, referred as 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D}).\nThe interactiveness network 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} is creatively utilized for binary classification, i.e., interactive/non-interactive. It benefits the whole model in two aspects. For one thing, the conventional HOI model is only targeted at HOI detection and classification. Our HOI classifier 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C} can be trained together with the interactiveness discriminator 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} to learn the HOIs and interactiveness knowledge together.\nUnder usual circumstances, the ratio of non-interactive edges is dominant within inputs.\nThus, by utilizing binary interactiveness labels converted from HOI labels, the whole model would be trained with a stronger supervised constraint and performs better and more robustly. For another, noting that the interactiveness network 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} only needs binary labels which are beyond the HOI classes, interactiveness is transferable and reusable. Therefore, 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} can be used as a transferable knowledge learner to learn interactiveness from multiple datasets and be applied to each of them respectively. In testing, we adopt the two-stage policy. First, the interactiveness network 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} evaluates the interactiveness of a human-object pair (edge) by exploiting the learned interactiveness knowledge, so we can convert the dense HOI graph to a sparse one (Fig. 2). After this, 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C} will process the sparse graph and classify the remaining edges. To implement TIN, we propose a hierarchical framework.\nFirst, we utilize the human/object appearance and spatial configuration as the instance-level features to learn the interactiveness between instances.\nSecond, we further argue that interactiveness has an important characteristic related to human body parts. That said, when interacting with daily objects, only some parts of our body would get involved. For example, in “read book”, only our head and hands have strong relationships with the book, but not our lower body. We can either stand or lie while reading.\nGiven this, besides the de facto instance-level features, we further define the interactiveness between object and human body parts, i.e., part interactiveness. Then, the human body part feature paired with object feature are used to learn it.\nNotably, instance and part interactivenesses have inherent and implicit relationships.\nTheir relationship is in line with the Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) 4, i.e., the instance interactiveness is false if and only if all part interactivenesses are false.\nTo be more explicit, a human is interacting with an object if and only if at least one human part is interacting with the object.\nThus, when inputting different level features, we can construct this consistency between two levels as an objective in learning.\nMoreover, body parts with higher interactiveness scores should be paid more attention to.\nWe further use the part attention strategy to strengthen the important parts in HOI inference.\nThe experiment (Sec. 5.5.3) verifies our assumption that different HOIs have various part interactiveness patterns.\nFor instance, “ride” is learned to be more related to feet, thighs, and hands than head and hip.\nThus, such an attention policy can greatly benefit HOI learning. We perform extensive experiments on HICO-DET , V-COCO 3\nand a newly constructed dataset PaStaNet-HOI 5.\nOur method cooperated with transferred interactiveness outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 1.53 and 4.35 mAP on the Default set and Rare set of HICO-DET."
