    "simplification of the sums s2​(t)s_{2}(t) and s3​(t)s_{3}(t) using sigma": "Before we apply our summation tools to S2​(t)S_{2}(t) we observe that the sum representation in (4.15) can be rewritten in the form recall that α=π6\\alpha=\\frac{\\pi}{6}.\nIn the following we will focus on the inner sum which reads as Using the summation package Sigma (or alternatively, any other package, like , that can deal with the creative telescoping paradigm  for hypergeometric products) one obtains the linear recurrence Next, we are interested in d’Alembertian solutions of the found recurrence, i.e., in the set of all solutions that can be given in terms of indefinite nested sums defined over hypergeometric products. Using Sigma we find two linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous version of the recurrence (6.1). To this end, we apply a generalized version  of\nPetkovšek’s Hyper algorithm ; we remark that the bases −72−π2+12​36+π2π2\\frac{-72-\\pi^{2}+12\\sqrt{36+\\pi^{2}}}{\\pi^{2}} and −72+π2+12​36+π2π2-\\frac{72+\\pi^{2}+12\\sqrt{36+\\pi^{2}}}{\\pi^{2}}of the powers in (6.2) are the roots of the characteristic polynomial that appears in the underlying algorithm . In the next step, we can apply the algorithm given in  to find the particular solution of the recurrence (6.1) in terms of an indefinite nested double sum over the powers given in (6.2). Then a crucial step for further processing, i.e., for carrying out the estimates in Section 6.2, is the simplification of the found particular solution. Here again the summation package Sigma can assist; for a survey of the used telescoping algorithms we refer, e.g., to 7. However, with the given limitations of the computer algebra system Mathematica, the underlying implementation does not work properly when dealing with algebraic elements such as 36+π2\\sqrt{36+\\pi^{2}}. To overcome this situation, we perform the substitution for a new variable bb; note that the inverse substitution is In this way, the technically challenging element 36+π2\\sqrt{36+\\pi^{2}} vanishes; it simplifies to We remark that such rewritings (also called rationalizing transformations) appear frequently when dealing with nested integrals in the research area of elementary particle physics; for a survey and applications we refer to 7. After this preprocessing step we continue with the sum representation where By construction, if we apply the substitution (6.5) to S~2​(t)\\tilde{S}_{2}(t) one gets S2​(t)S_{2}(t) back. Repeating the above calculations in this new representation we obtain the improved recurrence We remark that the correctness of the recurrence can be verified by the summand recurrence (not printed here) that is provided by the creative telescoping method.\nSolving this recurrence we get now the two linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous version; note that these solutions agree with (6.2) with the substitutions in (6.5), resp. (6.4). Most relevant, using Sigma the found particular solution can be simplified to the form for some rational functions R1​(t,u)R_{1}(t,u), R2​(t,u)R_{2}(t,u) and R3​(t,u)R_{3}(t,u) in the variables b,u,tb,u,t. We remark that correctness of the computed solutions can be verified easily by plugging them into the recurrence, carrying out the shift operator on the indefinite nested sums and products, and by finally simplification by performing simple rational function arithmetic. In summary, using Sigma we found two linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous version together with the a particular solution P~​(t,u)\\tilde{P}(t,u) of the recurrence itself. Due to the linearly independence of the homogeneous solutions, there exist unique constants c1​(t)c_{1}(t) and c2​(t)c_{2}(t) (free of uu) such that holds for all nonnegative integers tt and uu with t≥2t\\geq 2 and 1≤u≤t−21\\leq u\\leq t-2.\nTo determine these cj​(t)c_{j}(t), we consider the two initial values T~​(t,1)\\tilde{T}(t,1) and T~​(t,2)\\tilde{T}(t,2) which can be simplified with the same technology as above (where tt has taken over the role of uu) to the form By setting u=1,2u=1,2 in (6.6) and solving the underlying system we compute the c1​(t)c_{1}(t) and c2​(t)c_{2}(t) (which we do not print here) and\nobtain the desired simplification Finally, we replace in the sum T~​(t,u)\\tilde{T}(t,u) by the right-hand side of (6.7) and apply the substitution (6.4). This yields an expression that agrees with S2​(t)S_{2}(t) for all t≥2t\\geq 2 from which one can read of the splittings (6.15)–(6.16) of S2​(t)S_{2}(t) which in Section 6.2 are used to obtain the estimate (4.29) in Lemma 4.10. As indicated above, all calculations can be verified independently from the steps of their algorithmic derivations and thus lead to a rigorous proof for the correctness of the simplification. However, all the steps are tedious to handle manually.\nTo assist such calculations (that are similarly to those that we frequently tackle in particle physics ),\nwe provide besides Sigma the package EvaluateMultiSums 6 which contains all the experience of the Sigma–developer to carry out these calculations fully automatically. More precisely, after loading the packages\ninto the computer algebra system Mathematica In:= <<𝐒𝐢𝐠𝐦𝐚.𝐦\\tt\\bf\\displaystyle<<Sigma.m \n\nSigma - A summation package by Carsten Schneider\n© RISC-JKU\n In:= <<𝐄𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐒𝐮𝐦𝐬.𝐦\\tt\\bf\\displaystyle<<EvaluateMultiSums.m \n\nEvaluateMultiSum by Carsten Schneider\n© RISC-JKU\n we can insert the sum In:= 𝐓~=∑𝐬=𝟎𝐭−𝐮−𝟐(𝐛𝟐−𝟏)𝐬+𝐮​(−𝐬−𝐮)𝐮​(𝟏𝟐−𝐬−𝐮)𝟏+𝐬+𝐮(𝐬+𝐮)​(𝐬+𝟐​𝐮)!;\\tt\\bf\\displaystyle\\tilde{T}=\\sum_{s=0}^{t-u-2}\\frac{\\big{(}b^{2}-1\\big{)}^{s+u}(-s-u)_{u}\\big{(}\\frac{1}{2}-s-u\\big{)}_{1+s+u}}{(s+u)(s+2u)!}; and get with the command In:= 𝐄𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐒𝐮𝐦​[𝐓~,{},{𝐮,𝐭},{𝟏,𝟐},{𝐭−𝟐,∞}]\\tt\\bf\\displaystyle EvaluateMultiSum[\\tilde{T},\\{\\},\\{u,t\\},\\{1,2\\},\\{t-2,\\infty\\}] Out= \n…\\displaystyle\\tt\\dots  the output ‘​‘​…​”``\\dots\" that is equivalent to (6.7). Actually, one obtains a slight variant of it that one can transform to the version (6.7) using the command SigmaReduce; for a concrete application of such a transformation we refer to In[6.1] and In[6.1] below. Using this technology, we focus now on the more involved triple sum S3​(t)S_{3}(t) defined in (4.17). Similarly to S2​(t)S_{2}(t) we rewrite S3​(t)S_{3}(t) and work with the alternative sum representation When trying to apply the summation tools on these summations, it is reasonable to start with the inner most sum, say U​(t,s,u)U(t,s,u). One finds the representation In the next step, one may deal with the second summation using the simplification of U​(t,u,s)U(t,u,s). Using Sigma one obtains the recurrence with a right-hand side R​(t,u)R(t,u) represented in terms of indefinite nested sums too large for being printed here. Solving the homogeneous version of the recurrence gives the two solutions which are closely related to the solutions (6.2) when dealing with S2​(t)S_{2}(t). Indeed, the algorithm  (and the generalized version  implemented in Sigma) asks again for the roots of the same polynomial (6.3) that establishes the powers involving the algebraic element\n36+π2\\sqrt{36+\\pi^{2}}. Thus using the same rationalizing transformation (6.4) that we used above for the S2​(t)S_{2}(t) one obtains homogeneous solutions that are free of any algebraic elements. This suggests to reconsider the sum S3​(t)S_{3}(t) by applying first the substitution (6.4) leading to i.e., S3​(t)S_{3}(t) equals to S~3​(t)\\tilde{S}_{3}(t) after applying the inverse transformation (6.5). To this end, we insert the double sum In[ref]5:= 𝐓~=∑𝐬=𝟎𝐭−𝐢−𝟐(−𝐬−𝐮)𝐮​(𝟏𝟐−𝐬−𝐮)𝟏+𝐬+𝐮(𝟏+𝐬+𝟐​𝐮)!​∑𝐫=𝟎𝐭−𝐮−𝐬−𝟏(−𝟏)𝐫​(𝐛𝟐𝟏−𝐛𝟐)𝐫​(−𝟏𝟐−𝐫−𝟏−𝐫−𝐬+𝐭−𝐮);\\tt\\bf\\displaystyle\\tilde{T}=\\sum_{s=0}^{t-i-2}\\frac{(-s-u)_{u}\\big{(}\\frac{1}{2}-s-u\\big{)}_{1+s+u}}{(1+s+2u)!}\\sum_{r=0}^{t-u-s-1}(-1)^{r}\\big{(}\\tfrac{b^{2}}{1-b^{2}}\\big{)}^{r}\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}-\\frac{1}{2}-r\\\\\n\\\\\n-1-r-s+t-u\\end{smallmatrix}\\right); and apply our summation toolbox by executing In:= 𝐜𝐥𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐝𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐦​𝐓~=𝐄𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐒𝐮𝐦​[𝐓~,{},{𝐮,𝐭},{𝟎,𝟐},{𝐭−𝟐,∞},𝐒𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐒𝐮𝐦𝐬→𝐅𝐚𝐥𝐬𝐞]\\tt\\bf\\displaystyle closedForm\\tilde{T}=EvaluateMultiSum[\\tilde{T},\\{\\},\\{u,t\\},\\{0,2\\},\\{t-2,\\infty\\},SplitSums\\to False] Out= \n((𝟷−𝚋+𝚋𝟸)​(−𝟷+𝚋)𝟸​𝚞+(𝟷+𝚋+𝚋𝟸)​(𝟷+𝚋)𝟸​𝚞)​(−𝟷+𝚋)𝟷−𝚝−𝚞​(𝟷+𝚋)𝟷−𝚝−𝚞𝟸​𝚋𝟸​(𝟷+𝟸​𝚞)−(−𝟹+𝟸​𝚝)​(−𝟷+𝟸​𝚋𝟸​𝚝)​((−𝟷+𝚋)𝟷+𝟸​𝚞−(𝟷+𝚋)𝟷+𝟸​𝚞)​(−𝟷+𝚋)−𝚞​(𝟷+𝚋)−𝚞​(𝟻𝟸−𝚝)−𝟷+𝚝𝟺​𝚋𝟸​(𝟷+𝟸​𝚞)​𝚝!+𝚋​(−𝟹+𝟸​𝚝)​(−𝟷+𝟸​𝚝)​(−𝟷+𝚋)−𝟷−𝚞​(𝟷+𝚋)𝟷+𝚞​(𝟻𝟸−𝚝)−𝟷+𝚝𝟸​𝚝​(𝟷+𝟸​𝚞)​∑𝚒=𝟷𝚞(−𝟷+𝚋)𝚒​(𝟷+𝚋)−𝚒​(−𝚝)𝚒(−𝟷+𝚒+𝚝)!+𝟹​((−𝟷+𝚋)𝟷+𝟸​𝚞−(𝟷+𝚋)𝟷+𝟸​𝚞)​(−𝟷+𝚋)−𝚝−𝚞​(𝟷+𝚋)−𝚝−𝚞𝟺​𝚋𝟸​(𝟷+𝟸​𝚞)​∑𝚒=𝟷𝚝(−𝟷+𝚋)𝚒​(𝟷+𝚋)𝚒​(𝟻𝟸−𝚒)−𝟷+𝚒𝚒!−𝚋​(−𝟹+𝟸​𝚝)​(−𝟷+𝟸​𝚝)​(−𝟷+𝚋)𝟷+𝚞​(𝟷+𝚋)−𝟷−𝚞​(𝟻𝟸−𝚝)−𝟷+𝚝𝟸​𝚝​(𝟷+𝟸​𝚞)​∑𝚒=𝟷𝚞(−𝟷+𝚋)−𝚒​(𝟷+𝚋)𝚒​(−𝚝)𝚒(−𝟷+𝚒+𝚝)!\\displaystyle\\tt\\frac{\\big{(}\\big{(}1-b+b^{2}\\big{)}(-1+b)^{2u}+\\big{(}1+b+b^{2}\\big{)}(1+b)^{2u}\\big{)}(-1+b)^{1-t-u}(1+b)^{1-t-u}}{2b^{2}(1+2u)}\\newline\n-\\frac{(-3+2t)\\big{(}-1+2b^{2}t\\big{)}\\big{(}(-1+b)^{1+2u}-(1+b)^{1+2u}\\big{)}(-1+b)^{-u}(1+b)^{-u}\\big{(}\\frac{5}{2}-t\\big{)}_{-1+t}}{4b^{2}(1+2u)t!}\\newline\n+\\frac{b(-3+2t)(-1+2t)(-1+b)^{-1-u}(1+b)^{1+u}\\big{(}\\frac{5}{2}-t\\big{)}_{-1+t}}{2t(1+2u)}\\sum_{i=1}^{u}\\frac{(-1+b)^{i}(1+b)^{-i}(-t)_{i}}{(-1+i+t)!}\\newline\n+\\frac{3\\big{(}(-1+b)^{1+2u}-(1+b)^{1+2u}\\big{)}(-1+b)^{-t-u}(1+b)^{-t-u}}{4b^{2}(1+2u)}\\sum_{i=1}^{t}\\frac{(-1+b)^{i}(1+b)^{i}\\big{(}\\frac{5}{2}-i\\big{)}_{-1+i}}{i!}\\newline\n-\\frac{b(-3+2t)(-1+2t)(-1+b)^{1+u}(1+b)^{-1-u}\\big{(}\\frac{5}{2}-t\\big{)}_{-1+t}}{2t(1+2u)}\\sum_{i=1}^{u}\\frac{(-1+b)^{-i}(1+b)^{i}(-t)_{i}}{(-1+i+t)!}  In order to represent the expression in terms of the products u!,(−t)uu!,(-t)_{u} and t!,(t+u)!,(1/2−t)tt!,(t+u)!,(1/2-t)_{t}, one may use the following commands: In:= 𝐜𝐥𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐝𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐦​𝐓~=𝐒𝐢𝐠𝐦𝐚𝐑𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐞​[𝐜𝐥𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐝𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐦​𝐓~,𝐮,𝐓𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫→{𝐮!,(−𝐭)𝐮}]\\tt\\bf\\displaystyle closedForm\\tilde{T}=SigmaReduce[closedForm\\tilde{T},u,Tower\\to\\{u!,(-t)_{u}\\}] In:= 𝐜𝐥𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐝𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐦​𝐓~=𝐒𝐢𝐠𝐦𝐚𝐑𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐞​[𝐜𝐥𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐝𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐦​𝐓~,𝐭,𝐓𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫→{𝐭!,(𝐭+𝐮)!,(𝟏/𝟐−𝐭)𝐭}]\\tt\\bf\\displaystyle closedForm\\tilde{T}=SigmaReduce[closedForm\\tilde{T},t,Tower\\to\\{t!,(t+u)!,(1/2-t)_{t}\\}] Out= \n((−𝟷+𝚋)𝟸​𝚞+(𝟷+𝚋)𝟸​𝚞)𝟸​(𝟷+𝟸​𝚞)​(−𝟷+𝚋)𝚝+𝚞−𝟷​(𝟷+𝚋)𝚝+𝚞−𝟷−((−𝟷+𝚋)𝟸​𝚞+(𝟷+𝚋)𝟸​𝚞)​(−𝟷+𝚋)𝟷−𝚞​(𝟷+𝚋)𝟷−𝚞​(𝟷𝟸−𝚝)𝚝𝟸​(𝟷+𝟸​𝚞)​𝚝!+(𝚝−𝚞)​(𝟸​𝚋𝟸​𝚝−𝚋𝟸−𝟸​𝚝+𝟸​𝚞+𝟸)​(𝟷𝟸−𝚝)𝚝​(−𝚝)𝚞𝚝​(𝟸​𝚝−𝟷)​(𝟸​𝚞+𝟷)​(𝚝+𝚞)!+((−𝟷+𝚋)𝟸​𝚞+(𝟷+𝚋)𝟸​𝚞−𝚋​(−𝟷+𝚋)𝟸​𝚞+𝚋​(𝟷+𝚋)𝟸​𝚞)𝟸​(𝟷+𝟸​𝚞)​(−𝟷+𝚋)𝚝+𝚞​(𝟷+𝚋)𝚝+𝚞​∑𝚒=𝟷𝚝(−𝟷+𝚋)𝚒​(𝟷+𝚋)𝚒​(𝟷𝟸−𝚒)𝚒(−𝟷+𝟸​𝚒)​𝚒!−𝚋​(𝟷+𝚋)𝟷+𝚞​(𝟷𝟸−𝚝)𝚝(𝟷+𝟸​𝚞)​(−𝟷+𝚋)𝚞​∑𝚒=𝟷𝚞(−𝟷+𝚋)𝚒​(𝟷+𝚋)−𝚒​(−𝚝)𝚒(𝚒+𝚝)!−𝚋​(−𝟷+𝚋)𝟷+𝚞​(𝟷𝟸−𝚝)𝚝(𝟷+𝟸​𝚞)​(𝟷+𝚋)𝚞​∑𝚒=𝟷𝚞(−𝟷+𝚋)−𝚒​(𝟷+𝚋)𝚒​(−𝚝)𝚒(𝚒+𝚝)!\\displaystyle\\tt\\frac{\\big{(}(-1+b)^{2u}+(1+b)^{2u}\\big{)}}{2(1+2u)(-1+b)^{t+u-1}(1+b)^{t+u-1}}-\\frac{\\big{(}(-1+b)^{2u}+(1+b)^{2u}\\big{)}(-1+b)^{1-u}(1+b)^{1-u}\\big{(}\\frac{1}{2}-t\\big{)}_{t}}{2(1+2u)t!}\\newline\n+\\frac{(t-u)\\left(2b^{2}t-b^{2}-2t+2u+2\\right)\\big{(}\\frac{1}{2}-t\\big{)}_{t}(-t)_{u}}{t(2t-1)(2u+1)(t+u)!}\\newline\n+\\frac{\\big{(}(-1+b)^{2u}+(1+b)^{2u}-b(-1+b)^{2u}+b(1+b)^{2u}\\big{)}}{2(1+2u)(-1+b)^{t+u}(1+b)^{t+u}}\\sum_{i=1}^{t}\\frac{(-1+b)^{i}(1+b)^{i}\\big{(}\\frac{1}{2}-i\\big{)}_{i}}{(-1+2i)i!}\\newline\n-\\frac{b(1+b)^{1+u}\\big{(}\\frac{1}{2}-t\\big{)}_{t}}{(1+2u)(-1+b)^{u}}\\sum_{i=1}^{u}\\frac{(-1+b)^{i}(1+b)^{-i}(-t)_{i}}{(i+t)!}-\\frac{b(-1+b)^{1+u}\\big{(}\\frac{1}{2}-t\\big{)}_{t}}{(1+2u)(1+b)^{u}}\\sum_{i=1}^{u}\\frac{(-1+b)^{-i}(1+b)^{i}(-t)_{i}}{(i+t)!}  Denoting the result in Out[6.1] by T′​(t,u)T^{\\prime}(t,u) we obtain Finally, applying the substitution (6.5) to the right-hand side of (6.8) yields the simplification of S3​(t)S_{3}(t) that has been used to perform\nthe estimate (4.30) stated in Lemma 4.10; for further details we refer to Section 6.2. To our knowledge this is the first time that rationalizing transformations, usually applied to simplify integrals, have been applied non-trivially to symbolic summation. As pointed out, in our concrete calculations such transformations can be discovered automatically when one looks for “nice” hypergeometric solutions and sum solutions over such products of a given linear recurrence. It would be interesting to see where this extra feature could be also exploited in other applications."
