    "introduction": "The amalgamation of different technologies such as edge computing, IoT, cloud computing, and machine learning has contributed to a rapid proliferation of technological development in many areas such as healthcare and banking   . The increase of cheap pervasive sensing devices has contributed to the rapid growth of IoT, becoming one of the main sources of big data . In the broader spectrum of sensor systems, cyber-physical systems and advanced analysis tools are converged together to provide consolidated services. As a result, a particular system (e.g. healthcare, banking) can now be benefited from multiple sources of data, additionally to what is accumulated by conventional means . This growing availability of different sources of data has been able to revolutionize leading fields such as healthcare technologies to achieve excellent achievements in many areas such as drug discovery, early outbreak detection, epidemic control analysis, which were once considered to be complicated  . However, data related to the fields such as healthcare, banking and policing are massively convoluted with sensitive private data [ref]6  . It is essential to go for extreme measures to protect sensitive data while analyzing them to generate meaningful insights  0. However, it is an extremely challenging task as systems related to fields such as healthcare and banking are often densely distributed. This paper examines the issues related to distributed data sharing and analysis in order to devise an optimal privacy preservation solution towards distributed machine learning 1 in environments such as presented in Figure 1, which represents a typical distributed industry setup (e.g. smart healthcare, open banking) that runs on IoT, edge, fog, and cloud computing. Privacy violations in fields such as healthcare and banking can be catastrophic due to the availability of highly sensitive person-specific data . Among different definitions, privacy for data sharing and analysis can be defined as “Controlled Information Release” 2. It has been shown before that it is easy to identify patients in a database by combining several quasi-identifiers such as age, postcode, and sex 3. Removing just the identifiers from the dataset before releasing is not enough to protect the individuals’ privacy, and leaking personal information to untrusted third parties can be catastrophic 4 5 6 7. Privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) is the area that applies privacy-preserving approaches to data mining methods to protect the private information of the users of the underlying input data during the data mining processes 4. In this paper, we investigate the PPDM solutions that can be applied to limit privacy leaks in distributed machine learning (DML) under big data settings. The area of homomorphic encryption is widely explored for PPDM. However, in terms of big data and DML, homomorphic encryption cannot address the three challenges, (i) efficiency, (ii) high volume, and (iii) massive distribution of data. Furthermore, homomorphic encryption increases the data size during the encryption ( e.g. single bit can be multiplied to 16 bits), which is unreliable for big data and increases the data storage burdens  8. Compared to encryption, data perturbation (data modification) can provide efficient solutions towards privacy preservation with a predetermined error that can result due to the data modification 4 9. Federated Learning (FedML) is a distributed machine approach that is developed to provide efficient privacy-preserving machine learning in a distributed environment 0 1. In FedML, the machine learning model generation is done at the data owners’ computers, and a coordinating server (e.g. a cloud server) is used to generate a global model and share the ML knowledge among the distributed entities (e.g. edge devices). Since the original data never leave the data owners’ devices, FedML is assumed to provide privacy to the raw data. However, ML models show vulnerability to privacy inference attacks such as model memorizing attacks and membership inference, which focus on retrieving sensitive data from trained ML models even under black-box settings 2 3. Model inversion attacks that recover images from a facial recognition system 4 is another example that shows the vulnerability of ML to advanced adversarial attacks. If adversaries gain access to the central server/coordinating server, they can deploy attacks such as model memorizing attacks, which can memorize and extract raw data from the trained models 2. Hence, DML approaches, such as FedML, need additional measures to guarantee that there will not be any unanticipated privacy leaks. Differential privacy is a privacy definition (privacy model) that offers a strong notion of privacy compared to previous models [ref]6. Due to the application of heavy noise, the previous attempt to enforce differential privacy on big data has resulted in low utility in terms of advanced analytics, which can be catastrophic for applications such as healthcare 5. A major disadvantage of other techniques such as random rotation and geometric perturbation is their incapability to process high dimensional data (big data) efficiently. These perturbation approaches spend an excessive amount of time to generate better results with good utility and privacy 6 7. In terms of efficiency, additive perturbation provides good performance. However, the perturbed data end up with a low privacy guarantee  8. Another issue that is often ignored when developing privacy-preserving mechanisms for big data is data capacity issues. The application of privacy preservation (the specific algorithms based on encryption on perturbation) on a large database can be extensive and impossible if the exact resource allocation scenarios are not implemented correctly. A recently developed algorithm named PABIDOT for big data privacy preservation promises to provide high efficiency towards big data 9. The proposed method shows high classification accuracy for big data while providing high privacy. However, PABIDOT cannot be used for DML as it does not address the data distribution and data perturbation using resource-constrained devices (as depicted in Figure 1). We propose a new DISTributed Privacy-preserving Approach for distriButed machine learning in geographically distributed data and systems (DISTPAB). DISTPAB is a distributed privacy-preserving algorithm that employs a data perturbation mechanism. The distributed scenario of data perturbation of DISTPAB allows the perturbation of extensive datasets that need to be shared among distributed entities without leaking privacy. The actual data perturbation is conducted in the distributed entities (in edge/fog devices) locally using the global perturbation parameters generated in a central coordinating node before conducting FedML. This way, DISTPAB restricts original data to be communicated (before perturbation) via the network, which can be attacked by adversaries. The global perturbation parameter generation of DISTPAB ensures that there is no degradation of accuracy or attack resistance of the perturbed data. DISTPAB was first tested using six datasets obtained from the data repository named ”UCI Machine Learning Repository”111http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php. The results show that DISTPAB provides excellent classification accuracy, attack resistance, and excellent efficiency towards distributed machine learning under big data settings. The following sections of the paper are set out as follows. Section 2 includes a summary of related work. Section 3 provides a summary of the fundamentals used in developing DISTPAB. Section 4 provides background information related to DISTPAB. Section 5 presents the experimental evaluations of the the performance and the attack resistance of DISTPAB. Section 6 provides a discussion on the results provided in Section 5. The paper is concluded in Section 7."
