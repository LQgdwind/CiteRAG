    "motivation and literature overview": "Initiated by the seminal works introducing the idea of compressive sensing   , the problem of recovering structured data from an underdetermined system random linear measurements has been subject of intensive study in mathematics, signal processing, and computer science in recent years. Two classes of structural models that have proven particularly useful are variants of sparsity, where the signal is assumed to have only few significant coefficients in an appropriate basis, and low-rank models, where a matrix-valued signal is assumed to be well-approximated by a matrix of rank much less than the dimension. In both cases, the measurements are of the form where 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is a (random) linear operator, which maps the unknown structured object X𝑋X to the observed measurements b𝑏b and w𝑤w is a noise. One typically assumes that the number of measurement is much smaller than the signal dimension, which is why such measurement scenarios (especially in combination with a sparsity assumption) are commonly referred to as compressive sensing. It is not difficult to show that for both the sparsity and the low-rank model, the object that is extremal with regards to the underlying structure, i.e., has fewest non-zero coefficients or smallest rank, respectively, is indeed the correct solution in many cases if there is no additive noise. That is, in case of sparse recovery with w=0𝑤0w=0 one can often recover X𝑋X by solving with ∥Z∥ℓ0subscriptdelimited-∥∥𝑍subscriptℓ0\\left\\lVert Z\\right\\rVert_{\\ell_{0}} denoting the number of non-zero entries of Z𝑍Z, and for noiseless low-rank matrix recovery X𝑋X can typically be recovered via the problem Both these problems, however, are non-convex optimization problems and, in general, NP-hard  . However, tractable reconstruction of X𝑋X via appropriate convex relaxations is provably possible  if 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} possesses the null space property  or the restricted isometry property . If X𝑋X is sparse, one can reconstruct it in the noiseless case (w=0𝑤0w=0) as a minimizer of which can be efficiently solved numerically . If X𝑋X is of low rank, one can find it via the second order cone problem where the nuclear norm ∥⋅∥S1\\|\\cdot\\|_{S_{1}} of a matrix is defined to be the sum of its singular values. Subsequent works in the field gave an answer to the questions that followed: Will the reconstruction work if the assumption of sparsity or low rank is only approximately satisfied  ? Can X𝑋X be reconstructed robustly in the presence of noise with known strength as constraints in (2) or (3) are no longer valid  ? What if the strength is unknown or underestimated  ? Can one blindly apply (2) or (3) in the presence of noise and still obtain reasonable reconstruction   ? The answer the to the first two question is “yes”, if 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} possesses the robust null space property , which is known to be fulfilled for many random matrices with high probability, mostly matrices with independent rows. The last two questions, however, cannot be answered affirmatively in general if 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} fulfills only a suitable restricted isometry property   or robust null space property   with respect to the underlying structure. On the other hand, if in addition 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} fulfills the so-called quotient property   (see Section 1.5 below), the last two questions can be answered with “yes” in the case of the sparse recovery problem, i.e., if X𝑋X is a sparse vector. For low-rank matrix recovery answers to question Q3 are only available in limited classes of scenarios and Q4 has hardly been studied in the literature. For sparse recovery, in contrast, these questions are much better understood, in parts also because the quotient property is closely related to well-studied questions in the field of high-dimensional geometry . As the null space property, the quotient property is typically established via random constructions, and the choice of the random distribution of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is critical. In contrast to the null space property, however, these constructions often rely on the independence of the columns rather than the rows. The quotient property adapted for eq. 2 has been studied in a number of works over the recent years,\nextending the seminal results for Gaussian matrices  to matrices with i.i.d. subgaussian entries such as Bernoulli , Weibull matrices , log-concave distributions , and, more recently, even more heavy-tailed distributions including Cauchy random vectors . When the random matrix has independent entries (and, consequently, both independent rows to yield the quotient property and independent rows to yield the null space property), these results can be combined with results about the null space property to yield noise-blind recovery guarantees, e.g., for Gaussian  and subgaussian random matrices . As such bounds require a logarithmic number of finite moments , the resulting guarantees for noise-blind sparse recovery require slightly stronger conditions on the tail decay of the random matrix entries than the quotient property by itself. Similar results about null space and quotient properties hold for random measurement operators based on independent matrices with i.i.d. subgaussian entries and can be used to characterize the performance of eq. 3 for low-rank matrix recovery. For most application scenarios\nof sparse recovery,\nthe assumption of measurement operators with independent entries is too restrictive. In more realistic measurement scenarios, one encounters structural constraints imposed by the application. Examples for sparse recovery include Fourier structure [ref]58, combinations of Fourier and wavelet structure  3 as motivated, e.g., by magnetic resonance imaging \nand convolutional structure as motivated, e.g., by channel identification   . Such structured scenarios are also preferred for reasons of reduced computational complexity , but their theoretical analysis pose considerable challenges as compared to unstructured random ones 7 . Structural constraints are even more significant in the low-rank matrix recovery as the matrices that constitute the linear operator 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} of eq. 1 are in many applications not modeled very accurately by random matrices with i.i.d. entries. For example, in recommender systems, it is common to model a user-product matrix as approximately low-rank , which is known only through a subset of its entries, often assumed to be revealed at random locations 1 7. This corresponds to a low-rank matrix recovery problem with an operator 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} whose constituent matrices do not have i.i.d. entries, but are outer products of random standard basis vectors. Other relevant structured measurement scenarios for low-rank matrix recovery include symmetric rank-one measurements (see also Section 1.2 below), as related to phase retrieval , often in combination with additional structure such as coded diffraction patterns 0 or non-symmetric rank-one and low-rank measurements as encountered in blind deconvolution  and blind demixing [ref]38, and various structural models related to quantum state tomography  8 . Despite this large variety of relevant structured measurement scenarios, the study of the quotient property with structure is only in its beginnings. To our knowledge, there are two main contributions to mention here:  has provided such an estimate for sparse recovery with Fourier structure, and  observed for low-rank matrix recovery from Pauli measurements the quotient property directly follows from orthogonality. One should mention though that solving (2) is not the only way to attempt noise-blind recovery. For measurement systems satisfying the restricted isometry property, recovery guarantees have been established for various greedy and greedy-type methods such as orthogonal matching pursuit 2 and compressive sampling matching pursuit , which do not require a prior knowledge of the noise level, but instead require an upper bound on the sparsity level, which may also not be available in all cases. Furthermore, the square root lasso, a variant of (2) given by the minimization problem has been shown to yield recovery with a parameter λ𝜆\\lambda independent of the noise level under restricted eigenvalue conditions , and also under the robust null space property . For the low-rank matrix recovery problem, the restricted isometry property has mainly been established for unstructured measurement systems (with the notable exception of Pauli measurements as relevant in quantum information theory ), so the guarantees for greedy and greedy-type methods have limited applicability. While an approach analogous to the square root lasso also allows for noise-blind recovery when the noise is random  – for example for matrix completion – no analysis based on the robust null space property analogous to  is available yet.\nFor the phase retrieval problem, where the solution is known to be positive semidefinite (see below for more details), it has been shown that noise-blind recovery at near-optimal rate can be achieved by completely ignoring the nuclear norm objective of eq. 3 and just optimizing the data fidelity over the positive semidefinite cone 3  . Despite the availability of alternative approaches for a number of scenarios, however, we feel that understanding the quotient property of structured random measurement systems is of interest both from the mathematical point of view – given the fundamental role of algorithms (2) and (3) as a benchmark – and from the viewpoint of applications, given that these approaches form the basis of competitive solution approaches such as Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares 2 9 6 5, and hence their understanding sheds light on these methods as well."
