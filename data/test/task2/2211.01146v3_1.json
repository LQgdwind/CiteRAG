    "b.2 evaluation on low-light recognition": "A more detailed comparison than Table 7 of the main paper is shown\nin Table 10. It is broken down by the level of\nunder-exposure. Our method obtains the highest accuracy among all\nlevels of under-exposure. The dynamic ISP control is able to convert\na broad luminance distribution environment to a preferable distribution\nfor the detector. The visualized comparison is in Fig. 7\nand Fig. 8. We also evaluate the case of real RAW images used for training. The\nreal RAW images are randomly split into training data of 1830 images\nand test data of 400, the same with . The\nresult is shown in Table 11. Our method is confirmed\neffective for small amounts of real RAW training data. SID  Zero DCE  REDI [ref]18 H.
