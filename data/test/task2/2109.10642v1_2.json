    "i-b our contributions": "This paper studies the decentralized learning of tree-structured GGMs from noisy data sets that are corrupted by Gaussian, Erasure, and binary symmetric channel (BSC) noises. Moreover, the proposed results are simulated using synthetic data sets. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. For Nonquantized Data Set: Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 provide the upper bounds on the probability of incorrect recovery of tree-structured GGMs in the presence of (noisy) Gaussian and Erasure channels between sensors and the FC with finite size data set, respectively. These results are obtained using the positive correlation coefficient assumption that has been used previously for learning Ising model , 3 and associative Markov networks 4. For Gaussian channels, the proposed result needs only 𝒪​(log⁡(dδ))𝒪𝑑𝛿\\mathcal{O}(\\log(\\frac{d}{\\delta})) samples for the smallest sample size (n𝑛n) as compared with  that requires 𝒪​(log4⁡(dδ))𝒪superscript4𝑑𝛿\\mathcal{O}(\\log^{4}(\\frac{d}{\\delta})) samples. For Quantized Data Set: We extend the work of [ref]10 by studying the impact of (noisy) BSC on the tree structure learning performance, where BSC can be regarded as the quantized Gaussian. An upper bound on the probability of a crossover event is derived in Lemma 4 for the noisy quantized data set. Furthermore, it is shown empirically that the channel noise heavily degrades the learning performance even for a small tree. Algorithmic Bound: When some knowledge about the tree structure is known, Algorithmic Bound (Algorithm 2) is proposed especially for a small data set. The proposed Algorithmic bound is theoretically in Theorem 3 and empirically analyzed, and it achieves obviously better performance with the small data set (e.g., <2000absent2000<2000) because it utilizes the external knowledge as side information as compared to Theorem 2 for Erasure channel."
