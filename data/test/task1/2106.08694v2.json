  "title": "On the proper role of linguistically-oriented deep net analysis in linguistic theorizing",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nA lively research field has recently emerged that uses experimental\nmethods to probe the linguistic behavior of modern deep\nnetworks. While work in this tradition often reports intriguing\nresults about the grammatical skills of deep nets, it is not clear\nwhat their implications for linguistic theorizing should be. As a\nconsequence, linguistically-oriented deep net analysis has had very\nlittle impact on linguistics at large. In this chapter, I suggest that\ndeep networks should be treated as theories making explicit\npredictions about the acceptability of linguistic utterances. I argue\nthat, if we overcome some obstacles standing in the way of\nseriously pursuing this idea, we will gain a powerful new theoretical\ntool, complementary to mainstream algebraic approaches.",
