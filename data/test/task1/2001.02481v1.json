  "abstract": "Abstract\nWe establish an exactly tight relation between reversible pebblings\nof graphs and Nullstellensatz refutations of pebbling formulas,\nshowing that a graph¬†Gùê∫G can be reversibly pebbled in time¬†tùë°t and\nspace¬†sùë†s if and only if there is a Nullstellensatz refutation of the\npebbling formula over¬†Gùê∫G in size t+1ùë°1t+1 and degree¬†sùë†s\n(independently of the field in which the Nullstellensatz refutation\nis made). We use this correspondence to prove a number of strong\nsize-degree trade-offs for Nullstellensatz, which to the best of our\nknowledge are the first such results for this proof system.",
