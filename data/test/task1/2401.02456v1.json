  "title": "A comprehensive survey of research towards AI-enabled unmanned aerial systems in pre-, active-, and post-wildfire management",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nWildfires have emerged as one of the most destructive natural disasters worldwide, causing catastrophic losses in both human lives and forest wildlife. The increasing severity and frequency of wildfires across the globe have underscored the urgent need to improve public knowledge and advance existing techniques in wildfire management. Recently, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in wildfires, propelled by the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning models, has created an unprecedented momentum to implement and develop more effective wildfire management. Although some of the existing survey papers have explored various learning-based approaches, a comprehensive review emphasizing the application of AI-enabled UAV systems and their subsequent impact on multi-stage wildfire management is notably lacking. This survey aims to bridge these gaps by offering a systematic review of the recent state-of-the-art technologies, highlighting the advancements of UAV systems and AI models from pre-fire, through the active-fire stage, to post-fire management. To this aim, we provide an extensive analysis of the existing remote sensing systems with a particular focus on the UAV advancements, device specifications, and sensor technologies relevant to wildfire management. We also examine the pre-fire and post-fire management approaches, including fuel monitoring, prevention strategies, as well as evacuation planning, damage assessment, and operation strategies. Additionally, we review and summarize a wide range of computer vision techniques in active-fire management, with an emphasis on Machine Learning (ML), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for wildfire classification, segmentation, detection, and monitoring tasks. Ultimately, we underscore the substantial advancement in wildfire modeling through the integration of cutting-edge AI techniques and UAV-based data, providing novel insights and enhanced predictive capabilities to understand dynamic wildfire behavior.",
