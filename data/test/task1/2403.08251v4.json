  "abstract": "Abstract\n22footnotetext: Co-first, equal contributions11footnotetext: Corresponding authors\nThe emergence of social norms has attracted much interest in a wide array of disciplines, ranging from social science and cognitive science to artificial intelligence.\nIn this paper, we propose the first generative agent architecture\nthat empowers the emergence of social norms within a population of large language model-based agents.\nOur architecture, named CRSEC,\nconsists of four modules: Creation & Representation, Spreading, Evaluation, and Compliance.\nOur architecture addresses\nseveral important aspects of the emergent processes all in one:\n(i) where social norms come from, (ii) how they are formally represented, (iii) how they spread through agents’ communications and observations, (iv) how they are examined with a sanity check and synthesized in the long term, and (v) how they are incorporated into agents’ planning and actions.\nOur experiments deployed in the Smallville sandbox game environment demonstrate the capability of our architecture to establish social norms and reduce social conflicts within large language model-based multi-agent systems.\nThe positive outcomes of our human evaluation, conducted with 30 evaluators, further affirm the effectiveness of our approach.",
