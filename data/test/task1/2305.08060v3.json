  "title": "Two is Better Than One: Digital Siblings to Improve Autonomous Driving Testing",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nSimulation-based testing represents an important step to ensure the reliability of autonomous driving software. In practice, when companies rely on third-party general-purpose simulators, either for in-house or outsourced testing, the generalizability of testing results to real autonomous vehicles is at stake.\nIn this paper, we strengthen simulation-based testing by introducing the notion of digital siblings, a novel framework in which the AV is tested on multiple general-purpose simulators, built with different technologies. First, test cases are automatically generated for each individual simulator. Then, tests are migrated between simulators, using feature maps to characterize of the exercised driving conditions. Finally, the joint predicted failure probability is computed and a failure is reported only in cases of agreement among the siblings.\nWe implemented our framework using two open-source simulators and we empirically compared it against a digital twin of a physical scaled autonomous vehicle on a large set of test cases.\nOur study shows that the ensemble failure predictor by the digital siblings is superior to each individual simulator at predicting the failures of the digital twin. We discuss several ways in which our framework can help researchers interested in automated testing of autonomous driving software.",
