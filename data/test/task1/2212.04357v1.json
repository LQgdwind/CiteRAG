  "title": "A Fine-grained Chinese Software Privacy Policy Dataset for Sequence Labeling and Regulation Compliant Identification",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nPrivacy protection raises great attention on both legal levels and user awareness.\nTo protect user privacy, countries enact laws and regulations requiring software privacy policies to regulate their behavior.\nHowever, privacy policies are written in natural languages with many legal terms and software jargon that prevent users from understanding and even reading them.\nIt is desirable to use NLP techniques to analyze privacy policies for helping users understand them.\nFurthermore, existing datasets ignore law requirements and are limited to English.\nIn this paper, we construct the first Chinese privacy policy dataset, namely CA4P-483, to facilitate the sequence labeling tasks and regulation compliance identification between privacy policies and software.\nOur dataset includes 483 Chinese Android application privacy policies, over 11K sentences, and 52K fine-grained annotations.\nWe evaluate families of robust and representative baseline models on our dataset.\nBased on baseline performance, we provide findings and potential research directions on our dataset.\nFinally, we investigate the potential applications of CA4P-483111Our dataset and code are publicly available in https://github.com/zacharykzhao/CA4P-483 combing regulation requirements and program analysis.",
