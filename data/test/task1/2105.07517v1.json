  "title": "A Stress-Free Sum-of-Squares Lower Bound for Coloring",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nWe prove that with high probability over the choice of a random graph G𝐺G from the Erdős-Rényi distribution G​(n,1/2)𝐺𝑛12G(n,1/2), a natural nO​(ε2​log⁡n)superscript𝑛𝑂superscript𝜀2𝑛n^{O(\\varepsilon^{2}\\log n)}-time, degree O​(ε2​log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝜀2𝑛O(\\varepsilon^{2}\\log n) sum-of-squares semidefinite program cannot refute the existence of a valid k𝑘k-coloring of G𝐺G for k=n1/2+ε𝑘superscript𝑛12𝜀k=n^{1/2+\\varepsilon}. Our result implies that the refutation guarantee of the basic semidefinite program (a close variant of the Lovász theta function) cannot be appreciably improved by a natural o​(log⁡n)𝑜𝑛o(\\log n)-degree sum-of-squares strengthening, and this is tight up to a no​(1)superscript𝑛𝑜1n^{o(1)} slack in k𝑘k. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first lower bound for coloring G​(n,1/2)𝐺𝑛12G(n,1/2) for even a single round strengthening of the basic SDP in any SDP hierarchy.\nOur proof relies on a new variant of instance-preserving non-pointwise complete reduction within SoS from coloring a graph to finding large independent sets in it. Our proof is (perhaps surprisingly) short, simple and does not require complicated spectral norm bounds on random matrices with dependent entries that have been otherwise necessary in the proofs of many similar results [BHK+16, HKP+17, KB19, GJJ+20, MRX20].\nOur result formally holds for a constraint system where vertices are allowed to belong to multiple color classes; we leave the extension to the formally stronger formulation of coloring, where vertices must belong to unique colors classes, as an outstanding open problem.",
