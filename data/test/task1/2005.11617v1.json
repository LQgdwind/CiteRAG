  "title": "MeshODE: A Robust and Scalable Framework for Mesh Deformation",
  "abstract": "Abstract.\nWe present MeshODE, a scalable and robust framework for pairwise CAD model deformation without prespecified correspondences. Given a pair of shapes, our framework provides a novel shape feature-preserving mapping function that continuously deforms one model to the other by minimizing fitting and rigidity losses based on the non-rigid iterative-closest-point (ICP) algorithm.\nWe address two challenges in this problem, namely the design of a powerful deformation function and obtaining a feature-preserving CAD deformation.\nWhile traditional deformation directly optimizes for the coordinates of the mesh vertices or the vertices of a control cage, we introduce a deep bijective mapping that utilizes a flow model parameterized as a neural network. Our function has the capacity to handle complex deformations, produces deformations that are guaranteed free of self-intersections, and requires low rigidity constraining for geometry preservation, which leads to a better fitting quality compared with existing methods. It additionally enables continuous deformation between two arbitrary shapes without supervision for intermediate shapes.\nFurthermore, we propose a robust preprocessing pipeline for raw CAD meshes using feature-aware subdivision and a uniform graph template representation to address artifacts in raw CAD models including self-intersections, irregular triangles, topologically disconnected components, non-manifold edges, and nonuniformly distributed vertices. This facilitates a fast deformation optimization process that preserves global and local details.\nOn top of the methodological contributions, we create an evaluation benchmark for unsupervised pairwise shape deformation and find that our deformation results significantly outperform the state-of-the-art deformation algorithms with respect to fitting error.\nWe show that our framework benefits various downstream applications including novel shape design and animation, scan-to-CAD fitting, and texture transfer. Our code is publicly available111https://github.com/hjwdzh/MeshODE.",
