  "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this paper we initiate the study of the temporal graph realization problem with respect to the fastest path durations among its vertices,\nwhile we focus on periodic temporal graphs.\nGiven an n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n matrix D𝐷D and a Δ∈ℕΔℕ\\Delta\\in\\mathbb{N}, the goal is to construct a ΔΔ\\Delta-periodic temporal graph with n𝑛n vertices\nsuch that the duration of a fastest path from visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} to vjsubscript𝑣𝑗v_{j} is equal to Di,jsubscript𝐷𝑖𝑗D_{i,j}, or to decide that such a temporal graph does not exist.\nThe variations of the problem on static graphs has been well studied and understood since the 1960’s, and this area of research remains active until nowadays.\nAs it turns out, the periodic temporal graph realization problem has a very different computational complexity behavior than its static (i.e. non-temporal) counterpart.\nFirst we show that the problem is NP-hard in general, but polynomial-time solvable if the so-called underlying graph is a tree or a cycle.\nBuilding upon those results, we investigate its parameterized computational complexity with respect to structural parameters of the underlying static graph which measure the “tree-likeness”. For those parameters, we essentially give a tight classification between parameters that allow for tractability (in the FPT sense) and parameters that presumably do not.\nWe show that our problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the feedback vertex number of the underlying graph, while we show that it is in FPT when parameterized by the feedback edge number of the underlying graph.",
