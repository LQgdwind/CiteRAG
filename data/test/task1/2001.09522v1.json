  "title": "TaxoExpan: Self-supervised Taxonomy Expansion with Position-Enhanced Graph Neural Network",
  "abstract": "Abstract.\nTaxonomies consist of machine-interpretable semantics and provide valuable knowledge for many web applications.\nFor example, online retailers (e.g., Amazon and eBay) use taxonomies for product recommendation, and web search engines (e.g., Google and Bing) leverage taxonomies to enhance query understanding.\nEnormous efforts have been made on constructing taxonomies either manually or semi-automatically.\nHowever, with the fast-growing volume of web content, existing taxonomies will become outdated and fail to capture emerging knowledge.\nTherefore, in many applications, dynamic expansions of an existing taxonomy are in great demand.\nIn this paper, we study how to expand an existing taxonomy by adding a set of new concepts.\nWe propose a novel self-supervised framework, named TaxoExpan, which automatically generates a set of ⟨⟨\\langlequery concept, anchor concept⟩⟩\\rangle pairs from the existing taxonomy as training data.\nUsing such self-supervision data, TaxoExpan learns a model to predict whether a query concept is the direct hyponym of an anchor concept.\nWe develop two innovative techniques in TaxoExpan:\n(1) a position-enhanced graph neural network that encodes the local structure of an anchor concept in the existing taxonomy, and\n(2) a noise-robust training objective that enables the learned model to be insensitive to the label noise in the self-supervision data.\nExtensive experiments on three large-scale datasets from different domains demonstrate both the effectiveness and the efficiency of TaxoExpan for taxonomy expansion.",
