  "title": "Tabletop Roleplaying Games as Procedural Content Generators",
  "abstract": "Abstract.\nTabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) and procedural content generators can both be understood as systems of rules for producing content.\nIn this paper, we argue that TTRPG design can usefully be viewed as procedural content generator design.\nWe present several case studies linking key concepts from PCG research – including possibility spaces, expressive range analysis, and generative pipelines – to key concepts in TTRPG design.\nWe then discuss the implications of these relationships and suggest directions for future work uniting research in TTRPGs and PCG.",
