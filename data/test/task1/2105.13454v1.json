  "title": "Computational modeling of the nonlinear stochastic dynamics of horizontal drillstrings",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nThis work intends to analyze the nonlinear stochastic dynamics of drillstrings\nin horizontal configuration. For this purpose, it considers a beam theory,\nwith effects of rotatory inertia and shear deformation, which is capable\nof reproducing the large displacements that the beam undergoes. The friction\nand shock effects, due to beam/borehole wall transversal impacts,\nas well as the force and torque induced by bit-rock interaction,\nare also considered in the model. Uncertainties of bit-rock interaction\nmodel are taken into account using a parametric probabilistic approach.\nNumerical simulations have shown that the mechanical system of interest\nhas a very rich nonlinear stochastic dynamics, which generate phenomena\nsuch as bit-bounce, stick-slip, and transverse impacts.\nA study aiming to maximize the drilling process efficiency, varying\ndrillstring velocities of translation and rotation is presented. Also,\nthe work presents the definition and solution of two optimizations\nproblems, one deterministic and one robust, where the objective is to\nmaximize drillstring rate of penetration into the soil respecting its\nstructural limits.",
