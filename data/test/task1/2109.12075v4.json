  "title": "Towards A Measure of General Machine Intelligence",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nTo build general-purpose artificial intelligence systems that can deal with unknown\nvariables across unknown domains, we need benchmarks that measure how well these systems\nperform on tasks they have never seen before. A prerequisite for this is a measure of a\ntask’s generalization difficulty, or how dissimilar it is from the system’s prior\nknowledge and experience. If the skill of an intelligence system\nin a particular domain is defined as it’s ability to consistently generate a set of\ninstructions (or programs) to solve tasks in that domain, current benchmarks do not\nquantitatively measure the efficiency of acquiring new skills, making it possible to\nbrute-force skill acquisition by training with unlimited amounts of data and compute\npower. With this in mind, we first propose a common language of instruction, a\nprogramming language that allows the expression of programs in the form of directed\nacyclic graphs across a wide variety of real-world domains and computing platforms. Using\nprograms generated in this language, we demonstrate a match-based method to both score\nperformance and calculate the generalization difficulty of any given set of tasks. We use\nthese to define a numeric benchmark called the generalization index, or the g-index , to\nmeasure and compare the skill-acquisition efficiency of any intelligence system on a set\nof real-world tasks. Finally, we evaluate the suitability of some well-known models as\ngeneral intelligence systems by calculating their g-index scores.",
