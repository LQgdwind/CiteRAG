  "title": "Nearly-Linear Time Seeded Extractors with Short Seeds",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nSeeded extractors are fundamental objects in pseudorandomness and cryptography, and a deep line of work has designed polynomial-time seeded extractors with nearly-optimal parameters.\nHowever, existing constructions of seeded extractors with short seed length and large output length run in time Ω​(n​log⁡(1/ε))Ω𝑛1𝜀\\Omega(n\\log(1/\\varepsilon)) and often slower, where n𝑛n is the input source length and ε𝜀\\varepsilon is the error of the extractor.\nSince cryptographic applications of extractors require ε𝜀\\varepsilon to be small, the resulting runtime makes these extractors unusable in practice.\nMotivated by this, we explore constructions of strong seeded extractors with short seeds computable in nearly-linear time O​(n​logc⁡n)𝑂𝑛superscript𝑐𝑛O(n\\log^{c}n), for any error ε𝜀\\varepsilon.\nWe show that an appropriate combination of modern condensers and classical approaches for constructing seeded extractors for high min-entropy sources yields strong extractors for n𝑛n-bit sources with any min-entropy k𝑘k and any target error ε𝜀\\varepsilon with seed length d=O​(log⁡(n/ε))𝑑𝑂𝑛𝜀d=O(\\log(n/\\varepsilon)) and output length m=(1−η)​k𝑚1𝜂𝑘m=(1-\\eta)k for an arbitrarily small constant η>0𝜂0\\eta>0, running in nearly-linear time, after a reasonable one-time preprocessing step (finding a primitive element of 𝔽qsubscript𝔽𝑞\\mathds{F}_{q} with q=poly⁡(n/ε)𝑞poly𝑛𝜀q=\\operatorname{poly}(n/\\varepsilon) a power of 222) that is only required when k<2C​log∗⁡n⋅log2⁡(n/ε)𝑘⋅superscript2𝐶superscript𝑛superscript2𝑛𝜀k<2^{C\\log^{*}\\!n}\\cdot\\log^{2}(n/\\varepsilon), for a constant C>0𝐶0C>0 and log∗superscript\\log^{*}\\! the iterated logarithm, and which can be implemented in time polylog⁡(n/ε)polylog𝑛𝜀\\operatorname{polylog}(n/\\varepsilon) under mild conditions on q𝑞q.\nAs a second contribution, we give an instantiation of Trevisan’s extractor that can be evaluated in truly linear time in the RAM model, as long as the number of output bits is at most nlog⁡(1/ε)​polylog⁡(n)𝑛1𝜀polylog𝑛\\frac{n}{\\log(1/\\varepsilon)\\operatorname{polylog}(n)}.\nPrevious fast implementations of Trevisan’s extractor ran in O~​(n)~𝑂𝑛\\widetilde{O}(n) time in this setting.\nIn particular, these extractors directly yield privacy amplification protocols with the same time complexity and output length, and communication complexity equal to their seed length.",
