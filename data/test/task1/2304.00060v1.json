  "title": "Evidential Transactions with Cyberlogic",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nCyberlogic is an enabling logical foundation for building and analyzing\ndigital transactions that involve the exchange of\ndigital forms of evidence.\nIt is based on an extension of (first-order) intuitionistic predicate logic with\nan attestation and a knowledge modality.\nThe key ideas underlying Cyberlogic are extremely simple, as (1) public keys correspond to authorizations,\n(2) transactions are specified as distributed logic programs, and\n(3) verifiable evidence is collected by means of distributed proof search.\nVerifiable evidence, in particular, are constructed from extra-logical elements such as signed documents and cryptographic signatures.\nDespite this conceptual simplicity of Cyberlogic, central features of authorization policies\nincluding trust, delegation, and revocation of authority are definable.\nAn expressive temporal-epistemic logic for specifying distributed authorization policies and protocols\nis therefore definable in Cyberlogic using a trusted time source.\nWe describe the distributed execution of Cyberlogic programs based on the hereditary Harrop fragment in terms of distributed proof search,\nand we illustrate some fundamental issues in the distributed construction of certificates.\nThe main principles of encoding and executing cryptographic protocols in Cyberlogic are demonstrated.\nFinally, a functional encryption scheme is proposed for checking certificates of evidential transactions when policies are kept private.",
