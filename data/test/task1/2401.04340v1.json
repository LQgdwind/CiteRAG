  "title": "Online Allocation with Replenishable Budgets: Worst Case and Beyond",
  "abstract": "Abstract.\nThis paper studies online resource allocation with replenishable budgets,\nwhere budgets can be replenished on top of the initial budget and\nan agent sequentially chooses\nonline allocation decisions without violating the available budget constraint\nat each round. We propose a\nnovel online algorithm, called\nOACP (Opportunistic Allocation with Conservative Pricing), that\nconservatively adjusts dual variables while opportunistically\nutilizing available resources.\nOACP achieves a bounded asymptotic\ncompetitive ratio in adversarial settings as the number of decision rounds TùëáT gets large. Importantly, the asymptotic competitive ratio of OACP is optimal in the absence of additional assumptions on budget replenishment.\nTo further improve the competitive ratio, we\nmake a mild assumption that there is budget replenishment every\nT‚àó‚â•1superscriptùëá1T^{*}\\geq 1 decision rounds and propose\nOACP+ to dynamically adjust the total budget assignment for online allocation.\nNext,\nwe move beyond the worst-case and propose\nLA-OACP (Learning-Augmented OACP/OACP+),\na novel learning-augmented algorithm\nfor online allocation with replenishable budgets.\nWe prove that LA-OACP can improve\nthe average utility compared to OACP/OACP+ when the ML predictor\nis properly trained, while still offering worst-case utility guarantees when the\nML predictions are arbitrarily wrong.\nFinally, we run simulation studies of sustainable AI inference\npowered by renewables, validating our analysis\nand demonstrating the empirical benefits of LA-OACP.",
