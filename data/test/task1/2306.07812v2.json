  "abstract": "Abstract.\nMolecular property prediction is an important problem in drug discovery and materials science.\nAs geometric structures have been demonstrated necessary for molecular property prediction,\n3D information has been combined with various graph learning methods\nto boost prediction performance.\nHowever, obtaining the geometric structure of molecules\nis not feasible in many real-world applications due to the high computational cost.\nIn this work, we propose a novel 3D pre-training framework (dubbed 3D PGT),\nwhich pre-trains a model on 3D molecular graphs, and then fine-tunes it on molecular graphs without 3D structures.\nBased on fact that bond length,\nbond angle, and dihedral angle are three basic geometric descriptors corresponding to a complete molecular 3D conformer,\nwe first develop a multi-task generative pre-train framework based on these three attributes.\nNext, to automatically fuse these three generative tasks,\nwe design a surrogate metric using the total energy to search for weight distribution of the three pretext tasks\nsince total energy corresponding to the quality of 3D conformer.\nExtensive experiments on 2D molecular graphs are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy,\nefficiency and generalization ability of the proposed 3D PGT compared to various pre-training baselines.",
