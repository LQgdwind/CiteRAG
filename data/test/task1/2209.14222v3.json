  "abstract": "Abstract\nWe revisit the classic problem of optimal subset selection in the online learning set-up. Assume that the set [N]delimited-[]𝑁[N] consists of N𝑁N distinct elements. On the t𝑡tth round, an adversary chooses a monotone reward function ft:2[N]→ℝ+:subscript𝑓𝑡→superscript2delimited-[]𝑁subscriptℝf_{t}:2^{[N]}\\to\\mathbb{R}_{+} that assigns a non-negative reward to each subset of [N].delimited-[]𝑁[N]. An online policy selects (perhaps randomly) a subset St⊆[N]subscript𝑆𝑡delimited-[]𝑁S_{t}\\subseteq[N] consisting of k𝑘k elements before the reward function ftsubscript𝑓𝑡f_{t} for the t𝑡tth round is revealed to the learner. As a consequence of its choice, the policy receives a reward of ft​(St)subscript𝑓𝑡subscript𝑆𝑡f_{t}(S_{t}) on the t𝑡tth round. Our goal is to design an online sequential subset selection policy to maximize the expected cumulative reward accumulated over a time horizon. In this connection, we propose an online learning policy called SCore (Subset Selection with Core) that solves the problem for a large class of reward functions. The proposed SCore policy is based on a new polyhedral characterization of the reward functions called α𝛼\\alpha-Core - a generalization of Core from the cooperative game theory literature. We establish a learning guarantee for the SCore policy in terms of a new performance metric called α𝛼\\alpha-augmented regret. In this new metric, the performance of the online policy is compared with an unrestricted offline benchmark that can select all N𝑁N elements at every round. We show that a large class of reward functions, including submodular, can be efficiently optimized with the SCore policy. We also extend the proposed policy to the optimistic learning set-up where the learner has access to additional untrusted hints regarding the reward functions. Finally, we conclude the paper with a list of open problems.",
