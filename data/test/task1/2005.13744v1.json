  "title": "A Theory of Auto-Scaling for Resource Reservation in Cloud Services",
  "abstract": "Abstract.\nWe consider a distributed server system consisting of a large number of servers, each with limited capacity on multiple resources (CPU, memory, disk, etc.).\nJobs with different rewards arrive over time and require certain amounts of resources for the duration of their service.\nWhen a job arrives, the system must decide whether to admit it or reject it, and if admitted, in which server to schedule the job.\nThe objective is to maximize the expected total reward received by the system.\nThis problem is motivated by control of cloud computing clusters, in which, jobs are requests for Virtual Machines or Containers that reserve resources for various services, and rewards represent service priority of requests or price paid per time unit of service by clients.\nWe study this problem in an asymptotic regime where the number of servers and jobs‚Äô arrival rates scale by a factor LùêøL, as LùêøL becomes large.\nWe propose a resource reservation policy that asymptotically achieves at least 1/2121/2, and under certain monotone property on jobs‚Äô rewards and resources, at least 1‚àí1/e11ùëí1-1/e of the optimal expected reward.\nThe policy automatically scales the number of VM slots for each job type as the demand changes, and decides in which servers the slots should be created in advance, without the knowledge of traffic rates.\nIt effectively tracks a low-complexity greedy packing of existing jobs in the system while maintaining only a small number, g‚Äã(L)=œâ‚Äã(log‚Å°L)ùëîùêøùúîùêøg(L)=\\omega(\\log L), of reserved VM slots for high priority jobs that pack well.",
