  "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper investigates the optimization problem of an infinite\nstage discrete time Markov decision process (MDP) with a long-run\naverage metric considering both mean and variance of rewards\ntogether. Such performance metric is important since the mean\nindicates average returns and the variance indicates risk or\nfairness. However, the variance metric couples the rewards at all\nstages, the traditional dynamic programming is inapplicable as the\nprinciple of time consistency fails. We study this problem from a\nnew perspective called the sensitivity-based optimization theory. A\nperformance difference formula is derived and it can quantify the\ndifference of the mean-variance combined metrics of MDPs under any\ntwo different policies. The difference formula can be utilized to\ngenerate new policies with strictly improved mean-variance\nperformance. A necessary condition of the optimal policy and the\noptimality of deterministic policies are derived. We further develop\nan iterative algorithm with a form of policy iteration, which is\nproved to converge to local optima both in the mixed and randomized\npolicy space. Specially, when the mean reward is constant in\npolicies, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the global\noptimum. Finally, we apply our approach to study the fluctuation\nreduction of wind power in an energy storage system, which\ndemonstrates the potential applicability of our optimization method.",
