  "title": "Market Making without Regret",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nWe consider a sequential decision-making setting where, at every round t𝑡t, a market maker posts a bid price Btsubscript𝐵𝑡B_{t} and an ask price Atsubscript𝐴𝑡A_{t} to an incoming trader (the taker) with a private valuation for one unit of some asset.\nIf the trader’s valuation is lower than the bid price, or higher than the ask price, then a trade (sell or buy) occurs.\nIf a trade happens at round t𝑡t, then letting Mtsubscript𝑀𝑡M_{t} be the market price (observed only at the end of round t𝑡t), the maker’s utility is Mt−Btsubscript𝑀𝑡subscript𝐵𝑡M_{t}-B_{t} if the maker bought the asset, and At−Mtsubscript𝐴𝑡subscript𝑀𝑡A_{t}-M_{t} if they sold it.\nWe characterize the maker’s regret with respect to the best fixed choice of bid and ask pairs under a variety of assumptions (adversarial, i.i.d., and their variants) on the sequence of market prices and valuations.\nOur upper bound analysis unveils an intriguing connection relating market making to first-price auctions and dynamic pricing.\nOur main technical contribution is a lower bound for the i.i.d. case with Lipschitz distributions and independence between prices and valuations.\nThe difficulty in the analysis stems from the unique structure of the reward and feedback functions, allowing an algorithm to acquire information by graduating the “cost of exploration” in an arbitrary way.\nKeywords: Regret minimization, online learning, market making, first-price auctions, dynamic pricing.",
