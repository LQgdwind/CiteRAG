  "title": "Applications of Random Algebraic Constructions to Hardness of Approximation",
  "abstract": "Abstract.\nIn this paper, we show how one may (efficiently) construct two types of extremal combinatorial objects whose existence was previously conjectural.\n\n\n•\n\nPanchromatic Graphs: For fixed k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N}, a k𝑘k-panchromatic graph is, roughly speaking, a balanced bipartite graph with one partition class equipartitioned into k𝑘k colour classes in which the common neighbourhoods of panchromatic k𝑘k-sets of vertices are much larger than those of k𝑘k-sets that repeat a colour. The question of their existence was raised by Karthik and Manurangsi [Combinatorica 2020].\n\n\n\n•\n\nThreshold Graphs: For fixed k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N}, a k𝑘k-threshold graph is, roughly speaking, a balanced bipartite graph in which the common neighbourhoods of k𝑘k-sets of vertices on one side are much larger than those of (k+1)𝑘1(k+1)-sets. The question of their existence was raised by Lin [JACM 2018].\n\n\n\nConcretely, we provide probability distributions over graphs from which we can efficiently sample these objects in near linear time. These probability distributions are defined via varieties cut out by (carefully chosen) random polynomials, and the analysis of these constructions relies on machinery from algebraic geometry (such as the Lang–Weil estimate, for example). The technical tools developed to accomplish this might be of independent interest.\nAs applications of our constructions, we show the following conditional time lower bounds on the parameterized set intersection problem where, given a collection of n𝑛n sets over universe [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n] and a parameter k𝑘k, the goal is to find k𝑘k sets with the largest intersection.\n\n\n•\n\nAssuming 𝖤𝖳𝖧𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{ETH}, for any computable function F:ℕ→ℕ:𝐹→ℕℕF\\colon\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N}, no no​(k)superscript𝑛𝑜𝑘n^{o(k)}-time algorithm can approximate the parameterized set intersection problem up to factor F​(k)𝐹𝑘F(k). This improves considerably on the previously best-known result under 𝖤𝖳𝖧𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{ETH} due to Lin [JACM 2018], who ruled out any no​(k)superscript𝑛𝑜𝑘n^{o(\\sqrt{k})} time approximation algorithm for this problem.\n\n\n\n•\n\nAssuming 𝖲𝖤𝖳𝖧𝖲𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{SETH}, for every ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 and any computable function F:ℕ→ℕ:𝐹→ℕℕF\\colon\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N}, no nk−εsuperscript𝑛𝑘𝜀n^{k-\\varepsilon}-time algorithm can approximate the parameterized set intersection problem up to factor F​(k)𝐹𝑘F(k). No result of comparable strength was previously known under 𝖲𝖤𝖳𝖧𝖲𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{SETH}, even for solving this problem exactly.\n\n\n\nBoth these time lower bounds are obtained by composing panchromatic graphs with instances of the coloured variant of the parameterized set intersection problem (for which tight lower bounds were previously known).",
