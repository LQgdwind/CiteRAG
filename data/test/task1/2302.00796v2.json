  "title": "Unsupervised Entity Alignment for Temporal Knowledge Graphs",
  "abstract": "Abstract.\nEntity alignment (EA) is a fundamental data integration task that identifies equivalent entities between different knowledge graphs (KGs).\nTemporal Knowledge graphs (TKGs) extend traditional knowledge graphs by introducing timestamps, which have received increasing attention.\nState-of-the-art time-aware EA studies have suggested that the temporal information of TKGs facilitates the performance of EA.\nHowever, existing studies have not thoroughly exploited the advantages of temporal information in TKGs. Also, they perform EA by pre-aligning entity pairs, which can be labor-intensive and thus inefficient.\nIn this paper, we present DualMatch that effectively fuses the relational and temporal information for EA. DualMatch transfers EA on TKGs into a weighted graph matching problem. More specifically, DualMatch is equipped with an unsupervised method, which achieves EA without necessitating the seed alignment. DualMatch has two steps: (i) encoding temporal and relational information into embeddings separately using a novel label-free encoder, Dual-Encoder; and (ii) fusing both information and transforming it into alignment using a novel graph-matching-based decoder, GM-Decoder.\nDualMatch is able to perform EA on TKGs with or without supervision, due to its capability of effectively capturing temporal information.\nExtensive experiments on three real-world TKG datasets offer the insight that DualMatch\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",
