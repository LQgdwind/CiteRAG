  "title": "Implications of computer science theory for the simulation hypothesis",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nThe simulation hypothesis has recently excited renewed interest, especially in the physics and philosophy communities.\nHowever, the hypothesis specifically concerns computers that simulate physical universes, which\nmeans that to properly investigate it we need to couple computer science theory with physics. Here I\ndo this by exploiting the physical Church-Turing thesis. This allows me to introduce a preliminary\ninvestigation of some of the computer science theoretic aspects of the simulation hypothesis.\nIn particular, building on Kleene’s second recursion\ntheorem, I prove that it is mathematically possible for us to be in a simulation that is being run on a computer by us.\nIn such a case, there would be two identical instances of us; the question of which of those is “really us” is meaningless.\nI also show how Rice’s theorem provides some interesting impossibility results concerning simulation and self-simulation;\nbriefly describe the philosophical implications of fully homomorphic encryption for (self-)simulation; briefly investigate\nthe graphical structure of universes simulating universes simulating universes, among other issues. I end by describing some of the\npossible avenues for future research that this preliminary investigation reveals.",
