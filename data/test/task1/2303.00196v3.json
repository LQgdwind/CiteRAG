  "title": "Transformed Low-Rank Parameterization Can Help Robust Generalization for Tensor Neural Networks",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nMulti-channel learning has gained significant attention in recent applications, where neural networks with t-product layers (t-NNs) have shown promising performance through novel feature mapping in the transformed domain.\nHowever, despite the practical success of t-NNs, the theoretical analysis of their generalization remains unexplored. We address this gap by deriving upper bounds on the generalization error of t-NNs in both standard and adversarial settings. Notably, it reveals that t-NNs compressed with exact transformed low-rank parameterization can achieve tighter adversarial generalization bounds compared to non-compressed models. While exact transformed low-rank weights are rare in practice, the analysis demonstrates that through adversarial training with gradient flow, highly over-parameterized t-NNs with the ReLU activation can be implicitly regularized towards a transformed low-rank parameterization under certain conditions. Moreover, this paper establishes sharp adversarial generalization bounds for t-NNs with approximately transformed low-rank weights. Our analysis highlights the potential of transformed low-rank parameterization in enhancing the robust generalization of t-NNs, offering valuable insights for further research and development.",
