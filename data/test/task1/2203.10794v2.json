  "title": "Human-Centric Artificial Intelligence Architecture for Industry 5.0 Applications",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nHuman-centricity is the core value behind the evolution of manufacturing towards Industry 5.0. Nevertheless, there is a lack of architecture that considers safety, trustworthiness, and human-centricity at its core. Therefore, we propose an architecture that integrates Artificial Intelligence (Active Learning, Forecasting, Explainable Artificial Intelligence), simulated reality, decision-making, and users’ feedback, focusing on synergies between humans and machines. Furthermore, we align the proposed architecture with the Big Data Value Association Reference Architecture Model. Finally, we validate it on three use cases from real-world case studies.",
