  "title": "Active Acquisition for Multimodal Temporal Data: A Challenging Decision-Making Task",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nWe introduce a challenging decision-making task that we call active acquisition for multimodal temporal data (A2MT).\nIn many real-world scenarios, input features are not readily available at test time and must instead be acquired at significant cost.\nWith A2MT, we aim to learn agents that actively select which modalities of an input to acquire, trading off acquisition cost and predictive performance.\nA2MT extends a previous task called active feature acquisition to temporal decision making about high-dimensional inputs.\nWe propose a method based on the Perceiver IO architecture to address A2MT in practice.\nOur agents are able to solve a novel synthetic scenario requiring practically relevant cross-modal reasoning skills.\nOn two large-scale, real-world datasets, Kinetics-700 and AudioSet, our agents successfully learn cost-reactive acquisition behavior.\nHowever, an ablation reveals they are unable to learn adaptive acquisition strategies, emphasizing the difficulty of the task even for state-of-the-art models.\nApplications of A2MT may be impactful in domains like medicine, robotics, or finance, where modalities differ in acquisition cost and informativeness.",
