  "title": "Towards Learning from Graphs with Heterophily: Progress and Future",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nGraphs are structured data that models complex relations between real-world entities.\nHeterophilous graphs, where linked nodes are prone to be with different labels or dissimilar features, have recently attracted significant attention and found many applications.\nMeanwhile, increasing efforts have been made to advance learning from heterophilous graphs.\nAlthough there exist surveys on the relevant topic,\nthey focus on heterophilous GNNs, which are only sub-topics of heterophilous graph learning.\nIn this survey, we comprehensively overview existing works on learning from graphs with heterophily.\nFirst, we collect over 180 publications and introduce the development of this field.\nThen, we systematically categorize existing methods based on a hierarchical taxonomy including learning strategies, model architectures and practical applications.\nFinally, we discuss the primary challenges of existing studies and highlight promising avenues for future research.\nMore publication details and corresponding open-source codes can be accessed and will be continuously updated at our repositories: https://github.com/gongchenghua/Awesome-Survey-Graphs-with-Heterophily.",
