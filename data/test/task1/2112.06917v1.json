  "abstract": "Abstract\nThe two most effective branching strategies LRB and VSIDS perform differently on different types of instances.\nGenerally, LRB is more effective on crafted instances, while VSIDS is more effective on application ones.\nHowever, distinguishing the types of instances is difficult.\nTo overcome this drawback, we propose a branching strategy selection approach based on the vivification ratio.\nThis approach uses the LRB branching strategy more to solve the instances with a very low vivification ratio.\nWe tested the instances from the main track of SAT competitions in recent years.\nThe results show that the proposed approach is robust and it significantly increases the number of solved instances.\nIt is worth mentioning that, with the help of our approach, the solver Maple_CM can solve more than 16 instances for the benchmark from the 2020 SAT competition.",
