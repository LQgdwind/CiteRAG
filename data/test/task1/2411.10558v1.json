  "abstract": "Abstract\nAutonomous multi-agent systems such as hospital robots and package delivery\ndrones often operate in highly uncertain environments and are expected to\nachieve complex temporal task objectives while ensuring safety. While\nlearning-based methods such as reinforcement learning are popular methods to\ntrain single and multi-agent autonomous systems under user-specified and\nstate-based reward functions, applying these methods to satisfy trajectory-level\ntask objectives is a challenging problem. Our first contribution\nis the use of weighted automata to specify trajectory-level objectives, such\nthat, maximal paths induced in the weighted automaton correspond to desired\ntrajectory-level behaviors. We show how weighted automata-based specifications\ngo beyond timeliness properties focused on deadlines to performance properties\nsuch as expeditiousness. Our second contribution is the use of evolutionary game\ntheory (EGT) principles to train homogeneous multi-agent teams targeting\nhomogeneous task objectives. We show how shared experiences of agents and\nEGT-based policy updates allow us to outperform state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods in minimizing path length by nearly 30% in large spaces. We also show that our algorithm is computationally faster than deep RL methods by at least an order of magnitude. Additionally our results indicate that it scales better with an increase in the number of agents as compared to other methods.",
