  "title": "Fast Online Node Labeling for Very Large Graphs",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper studies the online node classification problem under a transductive learning setting. Current methods either invert a graph kernel matrix with 𝒪​(n3)𝒪superscript𝑛3\\mathcal{O}(n^{3}) runtime and 𝒪​(n2)𝒪superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}) space complexity or sample a large volume of random spanning trees, thus are difficult to scale to large graphs. In this work, we propose an improvement based on the online relaxation technique introduced by a series of works (Rakhlin et al., 2012; Rakhlin & Sridharan, 2015, 2017). We first prove an effective regret 𝒪​(n1+γ)𝒪superscript𝑛1𝛾\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n^{1+\\gamma}}) when suitable parameterized graph kernels are chosen, then propose an approximate algorithm FastONL enjoying 𝒪​(k​n1+γ)𝒪𝑘superscript𝑛1𝛾\\mathcal{O}(k\\sqrt{n^{1+\\gamma}}) regret based on this relaxation. The key of FastONL is a generalized local push method that effectively approximates inverse matrix columns and applies to a series of popular kernels. Furthermore, the per-prediction cost is 𝒪​(vol⁡(𝒮)​log⁡1/ϵ)𝒪vol𝒮1italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(\\operatorname{vol}\\left(\\mathcal{S}\\right)\\log 1/\\epsilon) locally dependent on the graph with linear memory cost. Experiments show that our scalable method enjoys a better tradeoff between local and global consistency.",
