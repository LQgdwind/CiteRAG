  "title": "A Survey on Deep Learning Event Extraction: Approaches and Applications",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nEvent extraction is a crucial research task for promptly apprehending event information from massive textual data.\nWith the rapid development of deep learning, event extraction based on deep learning technology has become a research hotspot.\nNumerous methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics have been proposed in the literature, raising the need for a comprehensive and updated survey.\nThis paper fills the research gap by reviewing the state-of-the-art approaches, especially focusing on the general domain event extraction based on deep learning models. We introduce a new literature classification of current general domain event extraction research according to the task definition. Afterwards, we summarize the paradigm and models of event extraction approaches, and then discuss each of them in detail.\nAs an important aspect, we summarize the benchmarks that support tests of predictions and evaluation metrics.\nA comprehensive comparison among different approaches is also provided in this survey.\nFinally, we conclude by summarizing future research directions facing the research area.",
