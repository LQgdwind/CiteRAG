  "title": "On Good 2-Query Locally Testable Codes from Sheaves on High Dimensional Expanders",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nWe expose a strong connection between good 222-query locally testable codes (LTCs) and high dimensional expanders.\nHere,\nan LTC is called good if it has constant rate and linear distance. Our emphasis in this work is on LTCs testable with only 222 queries. These are are harder to construct than general LTCs, and are of particular interest to theoretical computer science.\nThe connection we make between 222-query LTCs and high dimensional expanders is done by introducing a new object called a sheaf that is put on top of a high dimensional expander. Sheaves are vastly studied in topology. Here, we introduce sheaves on simplicial complexes. Moreover, we define a notion of an expanding sheaf that has not been studied before.\nWe present a framework to get good infinite families of 222-query LTCs from expanding sheaves on high dimensional expanders, utilizing towers of coverings of these high dimensional expanders.\nStarting with a high dimensional expander and an expanding sheaf,\nour framework produces an infinite\nfamily of codes admitting a 222-query tester.\nIf the initial sheaved high dimensional expander\nsatisfies some conditions,\nwhich can be checked in constant time,\nthen these codes form a family of good 222-query LTCs.\nWe give candidates for sheaved high dimensional expanders\nwhich can be fed into our framework, in the form of an iterative process\nwhich (conjecturally) produces such candidates given a high dimensional\nexpander and a special auxiliary sheaf. (We could not\nverify the prerequisites of our framework for these candidates\ndirectly because of computational limitations.)\nWe analyze this process experimentally\nand heuristically, and identify some properties\nof the fundamental group of the high dimensional expander at hand\nwhich\nare sufficient (but not necessary) to get the desired sheaf, and consequently\nan infinite family of good 222-query LTCs.",
