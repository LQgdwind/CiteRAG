  "title": "Freeform shape optimization of a compact DC photo-electron gun using isogeometric analysis",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nCompact DC high-voltage photo-electron guns are able to meet the sophisticated\ndemands of high-current applications such as energy recovery linacs. A main\ndesign parameter for such sources is the electric field strength, which depends\non the electrode geometry and is limited by the field emission threshold of the\nelectrode material. In order to minimize the maximum field strength for optimal\ngun operation, isogeometric analysis (IGA) can be used to exploit the\naxisymmetric geometry and describe its cross section by non-uniform rational\nB-splines, the control points of which are the parameters to be optimized. This\ncomputationally efficient method is capable of describing CAD-generated\ngeometries using open source software (GeoPDEs, NLopt,\nOctave) and it can simplify the step from design to simulation. We\nwill present the mathematical formulation, the software workflow, and the\nresults of an IGA-based shape optimization for a planned high-voltage upgrade\nof the DC photogun teststand Photo-CATCH at TU Darmstadt. The software\nbuilds on a general framework for isogeometric analysis and allows for easy\nadaptations to other geometries or quantities of interest. Simulations assuming\na bias voltage of −300 kVtimes-300kilovolt-300\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{kV} yielded maximum field gradients of\n9.06 MV m−1times9.06timesmegavoltmeter19.06\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{MV}\\text{\\,}{\\mathrm{m}}^{-1} on the surface of an inverted insulator\nelectrode and below 3 MV m−1times3timesmegavoltmeter13\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{MV}\\text{\\,}{\\mathrm{m}}^{-1} on the surface of the\nphotocathode.",
