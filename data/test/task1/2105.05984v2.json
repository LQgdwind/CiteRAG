  "abstract": "Abstract\nComputing the convolution A⋆B⋆𝐴𝐵A\\star B of two length-n𝑛n vectors A,B𝐴𝐵A,B is an ubiquitous computational primitive, with applications in a variety of disciplines.Within theoretical computer science, applications range from string problems to Knapsack-type problems, and from 3SUM to All-Pairs Shortest Paths. These applications often come in the form of nonnegative convolution, where the entries of A,B𝐴𝐵A,B are nonnegative integers. The classical algorithm to compute A⋆B⋆𝐴𝐵A\\star B uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and runs in time O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n).However, in many cases A𝐴A and B𝐵B might satisfy sparsity conditions, and hence one could hope for significant gains compared to the standard FFT algorithm. The ideal goal would be an O​(k​log⁡k)𝑂𝑘𝑘O(k\\log k)-time algorithm, where k𝑘k is the number of non-zero elements in the output, i.e., the size of the support of A⋆B⋆𝐴𝐵A\\star B. This problem is referred to as sparse nonnegative convolution, and has received a considerable amount of attention in the literature; the fastest algorithms to date run in time O​(k​log2⁡n)𝑂𝑘superscript2𝑛O(k\\log^{2}n).The main result of this paper is the first O​(k​log⁡k)𝑂𝑘𝑘O(k\\log k)-time algorithm for sparse nonnegative convolution. Our algorithm is randomized and assumes that the length n𝑛n and the largest entry of A𝐴A and B𝐵B are subexponential in k𝑘k. Surprisingly, we can phrase our algorithm as a reduction from the sparse case to the dense case of nonnegative convolution, showing that, under some mild assumptions, sparse nonnegative convolution is equivalent to dense nonnegative convolution for constant-error randomized algorithms. Specifically, if D​(n)𝐷𝑛D(n) is the time to convolve two nonnegative length-n𝑛n vectors with success probability 2/3232/3, and S​(k)𝑆𝑘S(k) is the time to convolve two nonnegative vectors with output size k𝑘k with success probability 2/3232/3, then S​(k)=O​(D​(k)+k​(log⁡log⁡k)2)𝑆𝑘𝑂𝐷𝑘𝑘superscript𝑘2S(k)=O(D(k)+k(\\log\\log k)^{2}).Our approach uses a variety of new techniques in combination with some old machinery from linear sketching and structured linear algebra, as well as new insights on linear hashing, the most classical hash function.",
