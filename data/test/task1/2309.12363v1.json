  "title": "Investigating Online Financial Misinformation and Its Consequences: A Computational Perspective",
  "abstract": "Abstract.\nThe rapid dissemination of information through digital platforms has revolutionized the way we access and consume news and information, particularly in the realm of finance. However, this digital age has also given rise to an alarming proliferation of financial misinformation, which can have detrimental effects on individuals, markets, and the overall economy. This research paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of online financial misinformation, including its types, sources, and impacts. We first discuss the characteristics and manifestations of financial misinformation, encompassing false claims and misleading content. We explore various case studies that illustrate the detrimental consequences of financial misinformation on the economy. These real-world examples demonstrate the extent to which misinformation can disrupt markets, harm investors, and create economic instability. Examples range from fraudulent investment schemes to misleading news articles or social media posts aimed at manipulating stock prices or influencing market sentiment. Such misinformation poses serious risks, including market volatility, investor losses, and erosion of trust in financial institutions. Finally, we highlight the potential impact and implications of detecting financial misinformation. Early detection and mitigation strategies can help protect investors, enhance market transparency, and preserve financial stability. We emphasize the importance of greater awareness, education, and regulation to address the issue of online financial misinformation and safeguard individuals and businesses from its harmful effects. In conclusion, this research paper sheds light on the pervasive issue of online financial misinformation and its wide-ranging consequences. By understanding the types, sources, and impacts of misinformation, stakeholders can work towards implementing effective detection and prevention measures to foster a more informed and resilient financial ecosystem.",
