  "title": "Simulating anisotropic diffusion processes with smoothed particle hydrodynamics",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nDiffusion problems with anisotropic features arise in the various areas of science and engineering fields.\nHowever, the description of these processes has posed\na challenge for many numerical methods because of the appearance of spurious oscillations and negative concentrations.\nAs a Lagrangian mesh-less method,\nSPH has a special advantage in addressing the\ndiffusion problems due to the\nthe benefit of dealing with the advection term.\nBut its application to solving anisotropic diffusion is still limited since a robust and general\nSPH formulation is required to obtain\naccurate approximations of second derivatives.\nIn this paper, we modify a second derivatives model\nbased on the SPH formulation to obtain a full version of Hessian matrix consisting of the Laplacian operator elements.\nFor solving diffusion with the diffusion coefficient being a second order tensor,\na coordinate transformation,\nis applied to conclude the anisotropic Laplacian operator.\nFor solving diffusion in thin structure using the anisotropic kernel,\nthe anisotropic kernel and corresponding gradient functions are considered when employing the Taylor series expansion.\nTo verify the proposed SPH scheme,\nfirstly, the diffusion of a scalar which distributes following a pre-function within a thin structure is performed by using anisotropic resolution coupling anisotropic kernel.\nWith various anisotropic ratios,\nexcellent agreements with the theoretical solution are achieved.\nThen, the anisotropic diffusion of a contaminant in fluid is simulated.\nThe simulation results are very consistent with corresponding analytical solutions,\nshowing that the present algorithm can obtain smooth solution without the spurious oscillations\nfor contaminant transport problems with discontinuities, and achieve second-order accuracy.\nSubsequently, we utilize this newly developed SPH formulation to tackle the problem of the fluid diffusion through a thin porous membrane and the anisotropic transport of transmembrane potential within the left ventricle,\ndemonstrating the capabilities of the proposed SPH framework in solving the complex anisotropic problems.",
