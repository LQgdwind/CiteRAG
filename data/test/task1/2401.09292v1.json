  "title": "Hierarchical Analyses Applied to Computer System Performance: Review and Call for Further Studies",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nWe review studies based on analytic (A) and simulation (S) methods\nfor hierarchical performance analysis of Queueing Network - QN models.\nA at lower and S at higher level have been applied most.\nThe proposed methods result in an order of magnitude reduction\nin performance evaluation cost with respect to simulation.\nThe computational cost at the lower level to obtain an exact solution\nis reduced when the computer system can be modeled as a product-form QN amenable to a low cost solution.\nA Continuous Time Markov Chain - CTMC or discrete-event simulation can then be used at the higher level.\nWe first consider a multiprogrammed transaction - txn processing system\nwith Poisson arrivals and predeclared lock requests.\nTxns with lock conflicts with active txns are held in a FCFS queue\nand txns are activated after they acquire all requested locks.\nTxn throughputs obtained by the analysis of multiprogrammed computer systems\nserve as the transition rates in a higher level CTMC to determine txn response times.\nWe next analyze a task system where task precedence relationships\nare specified by a directed acyclic graph to determine its makespan.\nTask service demands are specified on the devices of a computer system.\nThe composition of tasks in execution determines their processing time and throughputs,\nwhich serve as transition rates among the states of the CTMC model.\nTo reduce memory space requirements the CTMC is built and solved one set of task completions at a time.\nAs a third example we consider the hierarchical simulation\nof a timesharing system with two user classes.\nTxn throughputs in processing various combinations of requests\nare obtained by analyzing a closed product-form QN model.\nA discrete event simulator is provided.\nMore detailed QN modeling parameters, such as the distribution of the\nnumber of cycles of tasks consisting of Fork/Join (F/J) requests affect performance.\nThis detail can be taken into account in Schwetmanâ€™s hybrid simulation method,\nwhich counts remaining number of cycles in CSM-like queueing model.\nWe discuss an extension to hybrid simulation\nto adjust job service demands according to elapsed time, rather than counting cycles.\nA section reviewing related studies is provided.\nEquilibrium Point Analysis to reduce the computational cost\nin applying hierarchical analysis is presented in the Appendix.\nThe discussion is applicable to performance modeling of manufacturing systems.",
