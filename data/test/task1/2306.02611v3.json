  "title": "Stochastic Population Update Can Provably Be Helpful in Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms†1footnote 11footnote 1†A preliminary version of this paper has appeared at IJCAI’23 bian23stochastic .",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nEvolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been widely and successfully applied to solve multi-objective optimization problems, due to their nature of population-based search. Population update, a key component in multi-objective EAs (MOEAs), is usually performed in a greedy, deterministic manner. That is, the next-generation population is formed by selecting the best solutions from the current population and newly-generated solutions (irrespective of the selection criteria used such as Pareto dominance, crowdedness and indicators). In this paper, we question this practice. We analytically present that stochastic population update can be beneficial for the search of MOEAs. Specifically, we prove that the expected running time of two well-established MOEAs, SMS-EMOA and NSGA-II, for solving two bi-objective problems, OneJumpZeroJump and bi-objective RealRoyalRoad, can be exponentially decreased if replacing its deterministic population update mechanism by a stochastic one. Empirical studies also verify the effectiveness of the proposed population update method. This work is an attempt to challenge a common practice in the design of existing MOEAs. Its positive results, which might hold more generally, should encourage the exploration of developing new MOEAs in the area.",
