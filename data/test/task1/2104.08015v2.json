  "title": "On the Complexity of SHAP-Score-Based Explanations: Tractability via Knowledge Compilation and Non-Approximability Results",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nScores based on Shapley values are\nwidely used for providing\nexplanations to classification results over machine learning models. A prime\nexample of this is the influential 𝖲𝖧𝖠𝖯𝖲𝖧𝖠𝖯\\mathsf{SHAP}-score, a version of the Shapley\nvalue that can help explain the result of a learned model on a specific entity\nby assigning a score to every feature.\nWhile in general computing Shapley values is a computationally intractable\nproblem, we prove a strong positive result stating that the 𝖲𝖧𝖠𝖯𝖲𝖧𝖠𝖯\\mathsf{SHAP}-score can be\ncomputed in polynomial time over deterministic and decomposable Boolean\ncircuits under the so-called product distributions on entities.\nSuch\ncircuits are\nstudied in the field of Knowledge Compilation and generalize a\nwide range of Boolean circuits and binary decision diagrams classes, including\nbinary decision trees, Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) and Free Binary Decision Diagrams (FBDDs).\nOur positive result extends even beyond binary classifiers, as it continues to hold if each feature is associated with a finite domain of possible values.\nWe also establish the computational limits of the notion of\nSHAP-score by observing that, under a mild condition, computing it over a\nclass of Boolean models is always polynomially as hard as the model counting\nproblem for that class.\nThis implies that\nboth determinism and decomposability are essential properties for the circuits that we\nconsider, as removing one or the other renders the problem of\ncomputing the 𝖲𝖧𝖠𝖯𝖲𝖧𝖠𝖯\\mathsf{SHAP}-score intractable (namely, #​P#P\\#\\text{{P}}-hard). It also implies that\ncomputing 𝖲𝖧𝖠𝖯𝖲𝖧𝖠𝖯\\mathsf{SHAP}-scores is #​P#P\\#\\text{{P}}-hard even over the class of propositional formulas in DNF.\nBased on this negative result, we look for the existence of fully-polynomial randomized approximation schemes (FPRAS)\nfor computing 𝖲𝖧𝖠𝖯𝖲𝖧𝖠𝖯\\mathsf{SHAP}-scores over such class. In stark contrast to the model counting problem for DNF formulas, which admits an FPRAS, we prove that\nno such FPRAS exists (under widely believed complexity assumptions) for the computation of 𝖲𝖧𝖠𝖯𝖲𝖧𝖠𝖯\\mathsf{SHAP}-scores. Surprisingly, this negative result holds even for the class of monotone formulas in DNF. These techniques can be further\nextended to prove another strong negative result: Under widely believed\ncomplexity assumptions, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that checks, given a monotone DNF formula φ𝜑\\varphi and features x,y𝑥𝑦x,y, whether the 𝖲𝖧𝖠𝖯𝖲𝖧𝖠𝖯\\mathsf{SHAP}-score of x𝑥x in φ𝜑\\varphi is smaller than the 𝖲𝖧𝖠𝖯𝖲𝖧𝖠𝖯\\mathsf{SHAP}-score of y𝑦y in φ𝜑\\varphi.",
