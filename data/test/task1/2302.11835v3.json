  "title": "Reinforcement Learning for Combining Search Methods in the Calibration of Economic ABMs",
  "abstract": "Abstract.\nCalibrating agent-based models (ABMs) in economics and finance typically involves a derivative-free search in a very large parameter space.\nIn this work, we benchmark a number of search methods in the calibration of a well-known macroeconomic ABM on real data, and further assess the performance of ”mixed strategies” made by combining different methods.\nWe find that methods based on random-forest surrogates are particularly efficient, and that combining search methods generally increases performance since the biases of any single method are mitigated.\nMoving from these observations, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme to automatically select and combine search methods on-the-fly during a calibration run.\nThe RL agent keeps exploiting a specific method only as long as this keeps performing well, but explores new strategies when the specific method reaches a performance plateau.\nThe resulting RL search scheme outperforms any other method or method combination tested, and does not rely on any prior information or trial and error procedure.",
