  "title": "On the Trade-off between Over-smoothing and Over-squashing in Deep Graph Neural Networks",
  "abstract": "Abstract.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have succeeded in various computer science applications, yet deep GNNs underperform their shallow counterparts despite deep learning’s success in other domains.\nOver-smoothing and over-squashing are key challenges when stacking graph convolutional layers, hindering deep representation learning and information propagation from distant nodes.\nOur work reveals that over-smoothing and over-squashing are intrinsically related to the spectral gap of the graph Laplacian, resulting in an inevitable trade-off between these two issues, as they cannot be alleviated simultaneously.\nTo achieve a suitable compromise, we propose adding and removing edges as a viable approach.\nWe introduce the Stochastic Jost and Liu Curvature Rewiring (SJLR) algorithm, which is computationally efficient and preserves fundamental properties compared to previous curvature-based methods.\nUnlike existing approaches, SJLR performs edge addition and removal during GNN training while maintaining the graph unchanged during testing.\nComprehensive comparisons demonstrate SJLR’s competitive performance in addressing over-smoothing and over-squashing.",
