  "abstract": "Abstract.\nDeep graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown to be expressive for modeling graph-structured data.\nNevertheless, the over-stacked architecture of deep graph models makes it difficult to deploy and rapidly test on mobile or embedded systems.\nTo compress over-stacked GNNs, knowledge distillation via a teacher-student architecture turns out to be an effective technique, where the key step is to measure the discrepancy between teacher and student networks with predefined distance functions.\nHowever, using the same distance for graphs of various structures may be unfit, and the optimal distance formulation is hard to determine.\nTo tackle these problems, we propose a novel Adversarial Knowledge Distillation framework for graph models named GraphAKD, which adversarially trains a discriminator and a generator to adaptively detect and decrease the discrepancy.\nSpecifically, noticing that the well-captured inter-node and inter-class correlations favor the success of deep GNNs,\nwe propose to criticize the inherited knowledge from node-level and class-level views with a trainable discriminator.\nThe discriminator distinguishes between teacher knowledge and what the student inherits,\nwhile the student GNN works as a generator and aims to fool the discriminator.\nTo our best knowledge, GraphAKD is the first to introduce adversarial training to knowledge distillation in graph domains.\nExperiments on node-level and graph-level classification benchmarks demonstrate that GraphAKD improves the student performance by a large margin. The results imply that GraphAKD can precisely transfer knowledge from a complicated teacher GNN to a compact student GNN.",
