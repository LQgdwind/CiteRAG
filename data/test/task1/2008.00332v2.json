  "abstract": "A data-oblivious algorithm is an algorithm whose memory access pattern is independent of the input values.\nAs secure processors such as Intel SGX (with hyperthreading) become widely adopted, there is a growing appetite for private analytics on big data. Most prior works on data-oblivious algorithms adopt the classical PRAM model to capture parallelism. However, it is widely understood that PRAM does not best capture realistic multicore processors, nor does it reflect parallel programming models adopted in practice.\nWe initiate the study of parallel data oblivious algorithms on realistic multicores, best captured by the binary fork-join model of computation. We\npresent a data-oblivious\nCREW binary fork-join sorting\nalgorithm with optimal total work and optimal (cache-oblivious) cache complexity, and in O​(log⁡n​log⁡log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(\\log n\\log\\log n) span (i.e., parallel time); these bounds match the best-known bounds for binary fork-join cache-efficient\ninsecure algorithms. Using our sorting algorithm as a core primitive, we show how to data-obliviously simulate general PRAM algorithms in the binary fork-join model with non-trivial efficiency, and we present\ndata-oblivious algorithms for several applications including list ranking, Euler tour, tree contraction, connected components, and minimum spanning forest. All of our data oblivious algorithms have bounds that either\nmatch or improve over the best known bounds for insecure algorithms.\nComplementing these asymptotically efficient results, we present a practical variant of our sorting algorithm that is self-contained and potentially implementable.\nIt has optimal caching cost, and it is\nonly a log⁡log⁡n𝑛\\log\\log n factor\noff from optimal work and about a log⁡n𝑛\\log n factor off in terms of span;\nmoreover, it achieves small constant factors in its bounds.\nWe also present\nan EREW variant with optimal work and\ncaching cost, and with the same asymptotic\nspan.",
