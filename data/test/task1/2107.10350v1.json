  "title": "Uncertainty-Aware Task Allocation for Distributed Autonomous Robots",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper addresses task-allocation problems with\nuncertainty in situational awareness for distributed autonomous robots\n(DARs). The uncertainty propagation over a task-allocation process\nis done by using the Unscented transform that uses the Sigma-Point\nsampling mechanism. It has great potential to be employed for generic\ntask-allocation schemes, in the sense that there is no need to modify\nan existing task-allocation method that has been developed without\nconsidering the uncertainty in the situational awareness. The proposed\nframework was tested in a simulated environment where the decision-maker\nneeds to determine an optimal allocation of multiple locations assigned\nto multiple mobile flying robots whose locations come as random variables\nof known mean and covariance. The simulation result shows that the\nproposed stochastic task allocation approach generates an assignment\nwith 30% less overall cost than the one without considering the uncertainty.",
