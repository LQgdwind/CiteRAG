  "title": "How to fit large complexity classes into TFNP",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nSubclasses of TFNP (total functional NP) are usually defined by specifying a complete problem,\nwhich is necessarily in TFNP, and including all problems many-one reducible to it.\nWe study two notions of how a TFNP problem can be reducible to an object,\nsuch as a complexity class, outside TFNP. This gives rise to subclasses of TFNP\nwhich capture some properties of that outside object.\nWe show that well-known subclasses can arise in this way,\nfor example PPA from reducibility to ⊕Pdirect-sumP\\text{\\raisebox{0.5pt}{\\Large{$\\oplus$}}}\\mathrm{P}\nand PLS from reducibility to PNPsuperscriptPNP\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{NP}}.\nWe study subclasses arising from PSPACE and the polynomial\nhierarchy, and show that they are characterized by the propositional\nproof systems Frege and constant-depth Frege, extending\nthe known pairings between natural TFNP subclasses and proof systems.\nWe study approximate counting from this point of view, and look\nfor a subclass of TFNP that gives a natural home to combinatorial principles\nsuch as Ramsey which can be proved using approximate counting.\nWe relate this to the recently-studied Long choice and\nShort choice problems.",
