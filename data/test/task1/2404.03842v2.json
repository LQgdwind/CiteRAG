  "title": "The Low-Degree Hardness of Finding Large Independent Sets in Sparse Random Hypergraphs",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nWe study the algorithmic task of finding large independent sets in sparse Erdős–Rényi random r𝑟r-uniform hypergraphs on n𝑛n vertices having average degree d𝑑d. Krivelevich and Sudakov showed that the maximum independent set has density (rr−1⋅log⁡dd)1/(r−1)superscript⋅𝑟𝑟1𝑑𝑑1𝑟1\\left(\\frac{r}{r-1}\\cdot\\frac{\\log d}{d}\\right)^{1/(r-1)} in the double limit n→∞→𝑛n\\to\\infty followed by d→∞→𝑑d\\to\\infty. We show that the class of low-degree polynomial algorithms can find independent sets of density (1r−1⋅log⁡dd)1/(r−1)superscript⋅1𝑟1𝑑𝑑1𝑟1\\left(\\frac{1}{r-1}\\cdot\\frac{\\log d}{d}\\right)^{1/(r-1)} but no larger. This extends and generalizes earlier results of Gamarnik and Sudan, Rahman and Virág, and Wein on graphs, and answers a question of Bal and Bennett. We conjecture that this statistical-computational gap of a multiplicative factor of r−1/(r−1)superscript𝑟1𝑟1r^{-1/(r-1)} indeed holds for this problem.\nAdditionally, we explore the universality of this gap by examining r𝑟r-partite hypergraphs. A hypergraph H=(V,E)𝐻𝑉𝐸H=(V,E) is r𝑟r-partite if there is a partition V=V1∪⋯∪Vr𝑉subscript𝑉1⋯subscript𝑉𝑟V=V_{1}\\cup\\cdots\\cup V_{r} such that each edge contains exactly one vertex from each set Visubscript𝑉𝑖V_{i}. We consider the problem of finding large balanced independent sets (independent sets containing the same number of vertices in each partition) in random r𝑟r-uniform r𝑟r-partite hypergraphs with n𝑛n vertices in each partition and average degree d𝑑d. We prove that the maximum balanced independent set has density (rr−1⋅log⁡dd)1/(r−1)superscript⋅𝑟𝑟1𝑑𝑑1𝑟1\\left(\\frac{r}{r-1}\\cdot\\frac{\\log d}{d}\\right)^{1/(r-1)} asymptotically, matching that of independent sets in ordinary hypergraphs. Furthermore, we prove an analogous computational threshold of (1r−1⋅log⁡dd)1/(r−1)superscript⋅1𝑟1𝑑𝑑1𝑟1\\left(\\frac{1}{r-1}\\cdot\\frac{\\log d}{d}\\right)^{1/(r-1)} for low-degree polynomial algorithms, answering a question of the first author. We prove more general statements regarding γ𝛾\\mathbf{\\gamma}-balanced independent sets (where we specify the proportion of vertices of the independent set contained within each partition). Our results recover and generalize recent work of Perkins and the second author on bipartite graphs.\nWhile the graph case has been extensively studied, this work is the first to consider statistical-computational gaps of optimization problems on random hypergraphs. Our results suggest that these gaps persist for larger uniformities as well as across many models. A somewhat surprising aspect of the gap for balanced independent sets is that the algorithm achieving the lower bound is a simple degree-111 polynomial.",
