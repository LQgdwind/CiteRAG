  "title": "An Algorithmic Framework for Locally Constrained Homomorphisms",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nA homomorphism f𝑓f from a guest graph G𝐺G to a host graph H𝐻H is locally bijective, injective or surjective if for every u∈V​(G)𝑢𝑉𝐺u\\in V(G), the restriction of f𝑓f to the neighbourhood of u𝑢u is bijective, injective or surjective, respectively. The corresponding decision problems, LBHom, LIHom and LSHom, are well studied both on general graphs and on special graph classes. Apart from complexity results when the problems are parameterized by the treewidth and maximum degree of the guest graph, the three problems still lack a thorough study of their parameterized complexity. This paper fills this gap: we prove a number of new FPT, W[1]-hard and para-NP-complete results by considering a hierarchy of parameters of the guest graph G𝐺G. For our FPT results, we do this through the development of a new algorithmic framework that involves a general ILP model. To illustrate the applicability of the new framework, we also use it to prove FPT results for the Role Assignment problem, which originates from social network theory and is closely related to locally surjective homomorphisms.",
