  "title": "GRIDS: Interactive Layout Design with Integer Programming",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nGrid layouts are used by designers to spatially organise user interfaces when sketching and wireframing.\nHowever, their design is largely time consuming manual work.\nThis is challenging due to combinatorial explosion and complex objectives,\nsuch as alignment, balance, and expectations regarding positions.\nThis paper proposes a novel optimisation approach for the generation of diverse grid-based layouts.\nOur mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model offers a rigorous yet efficient method for grid generation that ensures packing, alignment, grouping, and preferential positioning of elements.\nFurther, we present techniques for interactive diversification, enhancement, and completion of grid layouts (GRIDS: Interactive Layout Design with Integer Programming).\nThese capabilities are demonstrated using Grids111GRIDS: Generating Real-time Interface Design Suggestions, a wireframing tool that provides designers with real-time layout suggestions.\nWe report findings from a ratings study (N=13ùëÅ13N=13) and a design study (N=16ùëÅ16N=16), lending evidence for the benefit of computational grid generation during early stages of design.",
