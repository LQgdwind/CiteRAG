  "title": "Unravelling Interlanguage Facts via Explainable Machine Learning",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nNative language identification (NLI) is the task of training (via\nsupervised machine learning) a classifier that guesses the native\nlanguage of the author of a text. This task has been extensively\nresearched in the last decade, and the performance of NLI systems\nhas steadily improved over the years. We focus on a different facet\nof the NLI task, i.e., that of analysing the internals of an NLI\nclassifier trained by an explainable machine learning\nalgorithm, in order to obtain explanations of its classification\ndecisions, with the ultimate goal of gaining insight into which\nlinguistic phenomena “give a speaker’s native language away”. We\nuse this perspective in order to tackle both NLI and a (much less\nresearched) companion task, i.e., guessing whether a text has been\nwritten by a native or a non-native speaker. Using three datasets of\ndifferent provenance (two datasets of English learners’ essays and a\ndataset of social media posts), we investigate which kind of\nlinguistic traits (lexical, morphological, syntactic, and\nstatistical) are most effective for solving our two tasks, namely,\nare most indicative of a speaker’s L1. We also present two case\nstudies, one on Spanish and one on Italian learners of English, in\nwhich we analyse individual linguistic traits that the classifiers\nhave singled out as most important for spotting these L1s. Overall,\nour study shows that the use of explainable machine learning can be\na valuable tool for the scholar who investigates interlanguage facts\nand language transfer.",
