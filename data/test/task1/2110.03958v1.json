  "title": "Social Recommendation with Self-Supervised Metagraph Informax Network",
  "abstract": "Abstract.\nIn recent years, researchers attempt to utilize online social information to alleviate data sparsity for collaborative filtering, based on the rationale that social networks offers the insights to understand the behavioral patterns. However, due to the overlook of inter-dependent knowledge across items (e.g., categories of products), existing social recommender systems are insufficient to distill the heterogeneous collaborative signals from both user and item side. In this work, we propose Self-Supervised Metagraph Informax Network (SMIN) which investigates the potential of jointly incorporating social- and knowledge-aware relational structures into the user preference representation for recommendation. To model relation heterogeneity, we design a metapath-guided heterogeneous graph neural network to aggregate feature embeddings from different types of meta-relations across users and items, empowering SMIN to maintain dedicated representations for multifaceted user- and item-wise dependencies. Additionally, to inject high-order collaborative signals, we generalize the mutual information learning paradigm under the self-supervised graph-based collaborative filtering. This endows the expressive modeling of user-item interactive patterns, by exploring global-level collaborative relations and underlying isomorphic transformation property of graph topology. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our SMIN model over various state-of-the-art recommendation methods. We release our source code at https://github.com/SocialRecsys/SMIN.",
