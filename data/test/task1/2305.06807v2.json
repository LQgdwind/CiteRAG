  "abstract": "Abstract\nReinforcement learning (RL) is inspired by the way human infants and animals learn from the environment.\nThe setting is somewhat idealized because, in actual tasks, other agents in the environment have their own goals and behave adaptively to the ego agent.\nTo thrive in those environments, the agent needs to influence other agents so their actions become more helpful and less harmful.\nResearch in computational economics distills two ways to influence others directly: by providing tangible goods (mechanism design) and by providing information (information design).\nThis work investigates information design problems for a group of RL agents.\nThe main challenges are two-fold.\nOne is the information provided will immediately affect the transition of the agent trajectories, which introduces additional non-stationarity.\nThe other is the information can be ignored, so the sender must provide information that the receiver is willing to respect.\nWe formulate the Markov signaling game, and develop the notions of signaling gradient and the extended obedience constraints that address these challenges.\nOur algorithm is efficient on various mixed-motive tasks and provides further insights into computational economics.\nOur code is publicly available at https://github.com/YueLin301/InformationDesignMARL.",
