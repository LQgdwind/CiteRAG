  "abstract": "Abstract.\nBuilding a graph neural network (GNN)-based recommender system without violating user privacy proves challenging.\nExisting methods can be divided into federated GNNs and decentralized GNNs.\nBut both methods have undesirable effects, i.e., low communication efficiency and privacy leakage.\nThis paper proposes DGREC, a novel decentralized GNN for privacy-preserving recommendations, where users can choose to publicize their interactions.\nIt includes three stages, i.e., graph construction, local gradient calculation, and global gradient passing.\nThe first stage builds a local inner-item hypergraph for each user and a global inter-user graph.\nThe second stage models user preference and calculates gradients on each local device.\nThe third stage designs a local differential privacy mechanism named secure gradient-sharing, which proves strong privacy-preserving of users’ private data.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets to validate the consistent superiority of our framework.",
