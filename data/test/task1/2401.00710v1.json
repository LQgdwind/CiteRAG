  "abstract": "Abstract.\nInteger sorting is a fundamental problem in computer science.\nThis paper studies parallel integer sort both in theory and in practice.\nIn theory, we show tighter bounds for a class of\nexisting practical integer sort algorithms, which provides a solid\ntheoretical foundation for their widespread usage\nin practice and strong performance.\nIn practice, we design a new integer sorting algorithm,\nDovetailSort, that is theoretically-efficient and has good practical performance.\nIn particular, DovetailSort overcomes a common challenge in existing\nparallel integer sorting algorithms, which is the difficulty of detecting and\ntaking advantage of duplicate keys.\nThe key insight in DovetailSort is to combine algorithmic ideas from\nboth integer- and comparison-sorting algorithms.\nIn our experiments, DovetailSort achieves competitive or better\nperformance than existing state-of-the-art parallel integer and\ncomparison sorting algorithms on various synthetic and real-world\ndatasets.",
