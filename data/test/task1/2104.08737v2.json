  "abstract": "Abstract\nEntity linking is an important problem with many applications.\nMost previous solutions were designed for settings where annotated training data is available, which is, however, not the case in numerous domains.\nWe propose a light-weight and scalable entity linking method, Eigenthemes, that relies solely on the availability of entity names and a referent knowledge base.\nEigenthemes exploits the fact that the entities that are truly mentioned in a document (the “gold entities”) tend to form a semantically dense subset of the set of all candidate entities in the document.\nGeometrically speaking, when representing entities as vectors via some given embedding, the gold entities tend to lie in a low-rank subspace of the full embedding space.\nEigenthemes identifies this subspace using the singular value decomposition and scores candidate entities according to their proximity to the subspace.\nOn the empirical front, we introduce multiple strong baselines that compare favorably to (and sometimes even outperform) the existing state of the art.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets from a variety of real-world domains showcase the effectiveness of our approach.",
