  "abstract": "Abstract\nBased on the recent breakthrough of Huang (2019), we show that for any total Boolean function f𝑓f,\n\n\n1.\n\n𝖽𝖾𝗀(f)=O(𝖽𝖾𝗀~(f)2)\\operatorname{\\mathsf{deg}}(f)=O(\\operatorname{\\mathsf{\\widetilde{deg}}}(f)^{2}): The degree of f𝑓f is at most quadratic in the approximate degree of f𝑓f. This is optimal as witnessed by the OR function.\n\n\n\n2.\n\n𝖣(f)=O(𝖰(f)4)\\operatorname{\\mathsf{D}}(f)=O(\\operatorname{\\mathsf{Q}}(f)^{4}): The deterministic query complexity of f𝑓f is at most quartic in the quantum query complexity of f𝑓f. This matches the known separation (up to log factors) due to Ambainis, Balodis, Belovs, Lee, Santha, and Smotrovs (2017).\n\n\n\nWe apply these results to resolve the quantum analogue of the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture. We show that if f𝑓f is a nontrivial monotone graph property of an n𝑛n-vertex graph specified by its adjacency matrix, then 𝖰⁡(f)=Ω​(n)𝖰𝑓Ω𝑛\\operatorname{\\mathsf{Q}}(f)=\\Omega(n), which is also optimal. We also show that the approximate degree of any read-once formula on n𝑛n variables is Θ​(n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(\\sqrt{n}).",
