  "title": "Keep Your Distance: Land Division With Separation",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper is part of an ongoing endeavor to bring the theory of fair division closer to practice by\nhandling requirements from real-life applications. We focus on two requirements originating from the\ndivision of land estates: (1) each agent should receive a plot of a usable geometric shape, and\n(2) plots of different agents must be physically separated.\nWith these requirements, the classic fairness notion of\nproportionality is impractical, since it may be impossible to attain any multiplicative\napproximation of it. In contrast, the ordinal maximin share approximation, introduced by Budish in\n2011, provides meaningful fairness guarantees. We prove upper and lower bounds on achievable maximin\nshare guarantees when the usable shapes are squares, fat rectangles, or arbitrary axis-aligned rectangles,\nand explore the algorithmic and query complexity of finding fair partitions in this setting.\nOur work makes use of tools and concepts from computational geometry such as independent sets of rectangles and guillotine partitions.",
