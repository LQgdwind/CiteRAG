  "title": "Parameterized Spanning Tree Congestion",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this paper we study the Spanning Tree Congestion problem, where we are given a graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E)\nand are asked to find a spanning tree T𝑇T of minimum maximum congestion.\nHere, the congestion of an edge e∈T𝑒𝑇e\\in T is the number of edges u​v∈E𝑢𝑣𝐸uv\\in E such\nthat the (unique) path from u𝑢u to v𝑣v in T𝑇T traverses e𝑒e. We consider this\nwell-studied NP-hard problem from the point of view of (structural)\nparameterized complexity and obtain the following results:\n\n\n•\n\nWe resolve a natural open problem by showing that Spanning Tree Congestion is not FPT\nparameterized by treewidth (under standard assumptions). More strongly, we\npresent a generic reduction which applies to (almost) any parameter of the form\n“vertex-deletion distance to class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}”, thus obtaining\nW[1]-hardness for parameters more restricted than treewidth, including\ntree-depth plus feedback vertex set, or incomparable to treewidth, such as twin\ncover. Via a slight tweak of the same reduction we also show that the problem\nis NP-complete on graphs of modular-width 444.\n\n\n\n•\n\nEven though it is known that Spanning Tree Congestion remains NP-hard on instances with only\none vertex of unbounded degree, it is currently open whether the problem\nremains hard on bounded-degree graphs. We resolve this question by showing\nNP-hardness on graphs of maximum degree 888.\n\n\n\n•\n\nComplementing the problem’s W[1]-hardness for treewidth, we formulate an\nalgorithm that runs in time roughly (k+w)𝒪​(w)superscript𝑘𝑤𝒪𝑤{(k+w)}^{\\mathcal{O}(w)}, where k𝑘k is the desired\ncongestion and w𝑤w the treewidth, improving a previous argument for parameter\nk+w𝑘𝑤k+w that was based on Courcelle’s theorem. This explicit algorithm pays off\nin two ways: it allows us to obtain an FPT approximation scheme for parameter\ntreewidth, that is, a (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximation running in time roughly\n(w/ε)𝒪​(w)superscript𝑤𝜀𝒪𝑤{(w/\\varepsilon)}^{\\mathcal{O}(w)}; and it leads to an exact FPT algorithm for parameter\nclique-width+k𝑘+k via a Win/Win argument.\n\n\n\n•\n\nFinally, motivated by the problem’s hardness for most standard structural\nparameters, we present FPT algorithms for several more restricted cases,\nnamely, for the parameters vertex-deletion distance to clique; vertex\nintegrity; and feedback edge set, in the latter case also achieving a\nsingle-exponential running time dependence on the parameter.",
