  "abstract": "Abstract\nWe study the complexity of proving that a sparse random regular\ngraph on an odd number of vertices does not have a perfect matching,\nand related problems involving each vertex being matched some\npre-specified number of times.\nWe show that this requires proofs of degree Ω​(n/log⁡n)Ω𝑛𝑛\\Omega(n/\\log n) in\nthe Polynomial Calculus (over fields of characteristic ≠2absent2\\neq 2) and\nSum-of-Squares proof systems, and exponential size in the\nbounded-depth Frege proof system.\nThis resolves a question by Razborov asking whether\nthe Lovász-Schrijver proof system requires nδsuperscript𝑛𝛿n^{\\delta} rounds to\nrefute these formulas for some δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0.\nThe results are obtained by a\nworst-case to average-case reduction of these formulas relying on a\ntopological embedding theorem which may be of independent interest.",
