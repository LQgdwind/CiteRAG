  "abstract": "Abstract\nCognitive theories for reasoning are about understanding how humans come to conclusions from a set of premises. Starting from hypothetical thoughts, we are interested which are the implications behind basic everyday language and how do we reason with them.\nA widely studied topic is whether cognitive theories can account for\ntypical reasoning tasks and be confirmed by own empirical\nexperiments.\nThis paper takes a different view and we do not propose a theory, but instead take findings from the literature and show how these, formalized as cognitive principles within a logical framework, can establish a quantitative notion of reasoning, which we call plausibility.\nFor this purpose, we employ techniques from non-monotonic reasoning and\ncomputer science, namely, a solving paradigm called answer set\nprogramming (ASP).\nFinally, we can fruitfully use plausibility reasoning in ASP to test\nthe effects of an existing experiment and explain different\nmajority responses.\n\n\nKeywords: Answer Set Programming, Human Reasoning, Model\nQuantification, Individual Reasoning, Deduction, Abduction,\nSuppression Task, Non-monotonic Reasoning",
