  "abstract": "Abstract.\nWe look at concatenation hierarchies of classes of regular languages. Each such hierarchy is determined by a single class, its basis: level nùëõn is built by applying the Boolean polynomial closure operator (BPol), nùëõn times to the basis. A prominent and difficult open question in automata theory is to decide membership of a regular language in a given level. For instance, for the historical dot-depth hierarchy, the decidability of membership is only known at levels one and two.\nWe give a generic algebraic characterization of the operator¬†BPol. This characterization implies that for any concatenation hierarchy, if nùëõn is at least two, membership at level nùëõn reduces to a more complex problem, called covering, for the previous level, n‚àí1ùëõ1n-1. Combined with earlier results on covering, this implies that membership is decidable for dot-depth three and for level two in most of the prominent hierarchies in the literature. For instance, we obtain that the levels two in both the modulo hierarchy and the group hierarchy have decidable membership.",
