  "title": "Behavior Trees in Robot Control Systems",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this paper we will give a control theoretic perspective on the research area of behavior trees in robotics.\nThe key idea underlying behavior trees is to make use of modularity, hierarchies and feedback, in order to handle the complexity of a versatile robot control system.\nModularity is a well-known tool to handle software complexity by enabling development, debugging and extension of separate modules without having detailed knowledge of the entire system. A hierarchy of such modules is natural, since robot tasks can often be decomposed into a hierarchy of sub-tasks. Finally, feedback control is a fundamental tool for handling uncertainties and disturbances in any low level control system, but in order to enable feedback control on the higher level, where one module decides what submodule to execute,\ninformation regarding progress and applicability of each submodule needs to be shared in the module interfaces.\nWe will describe how these three concepts come to use in\ntheoretical analysis, practical design, as well as extensions and combinations with other ideas from control theory and robotics.",
