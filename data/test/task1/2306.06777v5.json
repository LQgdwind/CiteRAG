  "abstract": "Abstract\nIn classification and forecasting with tabular data, one often utilizes tree-based models.\nThose can be competitive with deep neural networks on tabular data\n\nand,\nunder some conditions, explainable.\nThe explainability depends on the depth of the tree and the accuracy in each leaf of the tree.\n\nDecision trees containing leaves with unbalanced accuracy can provide misleading explanations. Low-accuracy leaves give less valid explanations, which could be interpreted as unfairness among explanations.\nHere, we train a shallow tree with the objective of\nminimizing the maximum misclassification error across each leaf node.\nThen, we extend each leaf with a separate tree-based model.\nThe shallow tree provides a global explanation, while the overall statistical performance of the shallow tree with extended leaves improves upon\n\ndecision trees of unlimited depth trained using classical methods (e.g., CART) and is comparable to state-of-the-art methods (e.g., well-tuned XGBoost).",
