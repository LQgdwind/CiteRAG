  "title": "Smart Proofs via Smart Contracts: Succinct and Informative Mathematical Derivations via Decentralized Markets",
  "abstract": "Abstract.\nModern mathematics is built on the idea that a proof should be translatable\ninto a formal proof, whose validity is an objective question, decidable\nby a computer. In practice, however, proofs are informal, succinct,\nand omit numerous uninteresting details: their goal is to share insight\namong a community of agents. An agent considers a proof valid if they\ntrust that it could (in principle) be expanded into a machine-verifiable\nproof. A proof’s validity can thus become a subjective\nmatter, possibly leading to a debate; if agents’ incentives\nare not aligned, it may be hard to reach a consensus. Hence, while\nthe concept of valid proof is well-defined in principle, the process\nto establish a proof’s validity is itself a complex\nmulti-agent problem.\nIn this paper, we introduce the SPRIG (Smart Proofs via Recursive\nInformation Gathering) protocol, which allows agents to propose and\nverify succinct and informative proofs in a decentralized fashion;\nthe trust is established by agents being able to request more details\nat steps where they feel there could be problems; debates, if they\narise, need to isolate specific details of proofs; if they persist,\nthey must go down to machine-level details, where they can be settled\nautomatically. A structure of fees, bounties, and stakes is set to\nincentivize the agents to act in good faith, i.e. to not publish problematic\nproofs and to not ask for trivial details.\nWe propose a game-theoretic discussion of SPRIG, illustrating how\nagents with different types of information interact, leading to a\nverification tree with an appropriate level of detail, and to the\ninvalidation of problematic proofs, and we discuss resilience against\nvarious attacks. We then provide an in-depth treatment of a simplified\nmodel, characterize its equilibria and analytically compute the agents’\nlevel of trust.\nThe SPRIG protocol is designed so that it can run fully autonomously\nas a smart contract on a decentralized blockchain platform, without\na need for a central trusted institution. This allows agents to participate\nanonymously in the verification debate, being incentivized to contribute\nwith their information. The smart contract mediates all the interactions\nbetween the agents, and settles debates on the validity of proofs,\nand guarantees that bounties and stakes are paid as specified by the\nprotocol.\nSPRIG also allows for a number of other applications, in particular\nthe issuance of bounties for solving open problems, and the creation\nof derivatives markets, enabling agents to inject more information\npertaining to mathematical proofs.\nIn addition to presenting the key novelties of the SPRIG protocol,\nthis whitepaper is also designed as a brief survey. In order to reach\na broader audience, we recall a variety of historical and technical\ndetails.",
