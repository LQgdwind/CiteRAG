  "abstract": "Abstract\nThe design of many-core neuromorphic hardware is getting more and more complex as these systems are expected to execute large machine learning models.\nTo deal with the design complexity, a predictable design flow is needed to guarantee real-time performance such as latency and throughput without significantly increasing the buffer requirement of computing cores.\nSynchronous Data Flow Graphs (SDFGs) are used for predictable mapping of streaming applications to multiprocessor systems.\nWe propose an SDFG-based design flow for mapping spiking neural networks (SNNs) to many-core neuromorphic hardware with the objective of exploring the tradeoff between throughput and buffer size. The proposed design flow integrates an iterative partitioning approach, based on Kernighan‚ÄìLin graph partitioning heuristic, creating SNN clusters such that each cluster can be mapped to a core of the hardware. The partitioning approach minimizes the inter-cluster spike communication, which improves latency on the shared interconnect of the hardware. Next, the design flow maps clusters to cores using an instance of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), an evolutionary algorithm, exploring the design space of throughput and buffer size. Pareto optimal mappings are retained from the design flow, allowing system designers to select a Pareto mapping that satisfies throughput and buffer size requirements of the design. We evaluated the design flow using five large-scale convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Results demonstrate 63% higher maximum throughput and 10% lower buffer size requirement compared to state-of-the-art dataflow-based mapping solutions.",
