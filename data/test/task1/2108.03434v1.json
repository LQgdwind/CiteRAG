  "title": "NASOA: Towards Faster Task-oriented Online Fine-tuning with a Zoo of Models",
  "abstract": "Abstract\n††footnotetext: ∗ Corresponding Author: xdliang328@gmail.com\nFine-tuning\nfrom pre-trained ImageNet models has been a simple, effective, and\npopular approach for various computer vision tasks. The common practice\nof fine-tuning is to adopt a default hyperparameter setting with a\nfixed pre-trained model, while both of them are not optimized for\nspecific tasks and time constraints. Moreover, in cloud computing\nor GPU clusters where the tasks arrive sequentially in a stream, faster\nonline fine-tuning is a more desired and realistic strategy for saving\nmoney, energy consumption, and CO2 emission. In this paper, we propose\na joint Neural Architecture Search and Online Adaption framework named\nNASOA towards a faster task-oriented fine-tuning upon the request\nof users. Specifically, NASOA first adopts an offline NAS to identify\na group of training-efficient networks to form a pretrained model\nzoo. We propose a novel joint block and macro level search space to\nenable a flexible and efficient search. Then, by estimating fine-tuning\nperformance via an adaptive model by accumulating experience from\nthe past tasks, an online schedule generator is proposed to pick up\nthe most suitable model and generate a personalized training regime\nwith respect to each desired task in a one-shot fashion. The resulting\nmodel zoo1††1The efficient training model zoo (ET-NAS) has been released\nat: https://github.com/NAS-OA/NASOA is more training efficient than SOTA models, e.g. 6x faster than\nRegNetY-16GF, and 1.7x faster than EfficientNetB3. Experiments on\nmultiple datasets also show that NASOA achieves much better fine-tuning\nresults, i.e. improving around 2.1% accuracy than the best performance\nin RegNet series under various constraints and tasks; 40x faster compared\nto the BOHB.",
