  "title": "Considerations on Approaches and Metrics in Automated Theorem Generation/Finding in Geometry",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nThe pursue of what are properties that can be identified to permit\nan automated reasoning program to generate and find new and\ninteresting theorems is an interesting research goal (pun\nintended). The automatic discovery of new theorems is a goal in\nitself, and it has been addressed in specific areas, with different\nmethods. The separation of the “weeds”, uninteresting, trivial\nfacts, from the “wheat”, new and interesting facts, is much\nharder, but is also being addressed by different authors using\ndifferent approaches. In this paper we will focus on geometry.\nWe present and discuss different approaches for the automatic\ndiscovery of geometric theorems (and properties), and different\nmetrics to find the interesting theorems among all those that were\ngenerated. After this description we will introduce the first result\nof this article: an undecidability result proving that having an\nalgorithmic procedure that decides for every possible Turing Machine\nthat produces theorems, whether it is able to produce also\ninteresting theorems, is an undecidable problem. Consequently, we\nwill argue that judging whether a theorem prover is able to produce\ninteresting theorems remains a non deterministic task, at best a\ntask to be addressed by program based in an algorithm guided by\nheuristics criteria. Therefore, as a human, to satisfy this task\ntwo things are necessary: an expert survey that sheds light on what\na theorem prover/finder of interesting geometric theorems is,\nand—to enable this analysis—other surveys that clarify metrics\nand approaches related to the interestingness of geometric\ntheorems. In the conclusion of this article we will introduce the\nstructure of two of these surveys —the second result of this\narticle— and we will discuss some future work.",
