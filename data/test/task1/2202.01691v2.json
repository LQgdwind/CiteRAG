  "title": "Solving Dynamic Principal-Agent Problems with a Rationally Inattentive Principal",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nPrincipal-Agent (PA) problems describe a broad class of economic relationships characterized by misaligned incentives and asymmetric information.\nThe Principal’s problem is to find optimal incentives given the available information, e.g., a manager setting optimal wages for its employees.\nWhereas the Principal is often assumed rational, comparatively little is known about solutions when the Principal is boundedly rational, especially in the sequential setting, with multiple Agents, and with multiple information channels.\nHere, we develop RIRL, a deep reinforcement learning framework that solves such complex PA problems with a rationally inattentive Principal.\nSuch a Principal incurs a cost for paying attention to information, which can model forms of bounded rationality.\nWe use RIRL to analyze rich economic phenomena in manager-employee relationships.\nIn the single-step setting,\n1) RIRL yields wages that are consistent with theoretical predictions; and\n2) non-zero attention costs lead to simpler but less profitable wage structures, and increased Agent welfare.\nIn a sequential setting with multiple Agents, RIRL shows opposing consequences of the Principal’s inattention to different information channels:\n1) inattention to Agents’ outputs closes wage gaps based on ability differences; and\n2) inattention to Agents’ efforts induces a social dilemma dynamic in which Agents work harder, but essentially for free.\nMoreover, RIRL reveals non-trivial relationships between the Principal’s inattention and Agent types, e.g., if Agents are prone to sub-optimal effort choices, payment schedules are more sensitive to the Principal’s attention cost.\nAs such, RIRL can reveal novel economic relationships and enables progress towards understanding the effects of bounded rationality in dynamic settings.111Example code is available at https://github.com/salesforce/RIRL",
