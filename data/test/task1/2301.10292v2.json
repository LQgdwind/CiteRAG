  "title": "Tuning Synaptic Connections instead of Weights by Genetic Algorithm in Spiking Policy Network",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nLearning from the interaction is the primary way biological agents know about the environment and themselves. Modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) explores a computational approach to learning from interaction and has significantly progressed in solving various tasks.\nHowever, the powerful DRL is still far from biological agents in energy efficiency.\nAlthough the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, we believe that the integration of spiking communication between neurons and biologically-plausible synaptic plasticity plays a prominent role.\nFollowing this biological intuition, we optimize a spiking policy network (SPN) by a genetic algorithm as an energy-efficient alternative to DRL. Our SPN mimics the sensorimotor neuron pathway of insects and communicates through event-based spikes.\nInspired by biological research that the brain forms memories by forming new synaptic connections and rewires these connections based on new experiences, we tune the synaptic connections instead of weights in SPN to solve given tasks. Experimental results on several robotic control tasks show that our method can achieve the performance level of mainstream DRL methods and exhibit significantly higher energy efficiency.111The source code, saved checkpoints and results are available at https://github.com/BladeDancer957/SPN-GA.",
