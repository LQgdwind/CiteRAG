  "title": "Verifying Unboundedness via Amalgamation",
  "abstract": "Abstract.\nWell-structured transition systems (WSTS) are an abstract family of\nsystems that encompasses a vast landscape of infinite-state\nsystems. By requiring a well-quasi-ordering (wqo) on the set of\nstates, a WSTS enables generic algorithms for classic verification\ntasks such as coverability and termination. However, even for systems\nthat are WSTS like vector addition systems (VAS), the framework is\nnotoriously ill-equipped to analyse reachability (as opposed to\ncoverability). Moreover, some important types of infinite-state\nsystems fall out of WSTS‚Äô scope entirely, such as pushdown systems\n(PDS).\nInspired by recent algorithmic techniques on VAS, we propose an abstract notion\nof systems where the set of runs is equipped with a wqo and supports\namalgamation of runs. We show that it subsumes a large class of\ninfinite-state systems, including (reachability languages of) VAS and PDS, and\neven all systems from the abstract framework of valence systems, except for\nthose already known to be Turing-complete.\nMoreover, this abstract setting enables simple and general\nalgorithmic solutions to unboundedness problems, which have received\nmuch attention in recent years. We present algorithms for the (i)¬†simultaneous\nunboundedness problem (which implies computability of downward closures and\ndecidability of separability by piecewise testable languages), (ii)¬†computing\npriority downward closures, (iii)¬†deciding whether a language is bounded,\nmeaning included in w1‚àó‚Äã‚ãØ‚Äãwk‚àósuperscriptsubscriptùë§1‚ãØsuperscriptsubscriptùë§ùëòw_{1}^{*}\\cdots w_{k}^{*} for some words w1,‚Ä¶,wksubscriptùë§1‚Ä¶subscriptùë§ùëòw_{1},\\ldots,w_{k}, and\n(iv)¬†effective regularity of unary languages. This leads to either drastically\nsimpler proofs or new decidability results for a rich variety of systems.",
