  "title": "Coresets for Time Series Clustering",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nWe study the problem of constructing coresets for clustering problems with time series data.\nThis problem has gained importance across many fields including biology, medicine, and economics due to the proliferation of sensors for real-time measurement and rapid drop in storage costs.\nIn particular, we consider the setting where the time series data on N𝑁N entities is generated from a Gaussian mixture model with autocorrelations over k𝑘k clusters in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}. Our main contribution is an algorithm to construct coresets for the maximum likelihood objective for this mixture model.\nOur algorithm is efficient, and, under a mild assumption on the covariance matrices of the Gaussians, the size of the coreset is independent of the number of entities N𝑁N and the number of observations for each entity, and depends only polynomially on k𝑘k, d𝑑d and 1/ε1𝜀1/\\varepsilon, where ε𝜀\\varepsilon is the error parameter.\nWe empirically assess the performance of our coresets with synthetic data.",
