  "title": "Using attention methods to predict judicial outcomes",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nThe prediction of legal judgments is one of the most recognized fields in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Law combined. By legal prediction, we mean intelligent systems capable of predicting specific judicial characteristics such as the judicial outcome, the judicial class, and the prediction of a particular case. In this study, we used an artificial intelligence classifier to predict the decisions of Brazilian courts. To this end, we developed a text crawler to extract data from official Brazilian electronic legal systems, consisting of two datasets of cases of second-degree murder and active corruption. We applied various classifiers, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks, and others, to predict judicial outcomes by analyzing text features from the dataset. Our research demonstrated that Regression Trees, Gated Recurring Units, and Hierarchical Attention Networks tended to have higher metrics across our datasets. As the final goal, we searched the weights of one of the algorithms, Hierarchical Attention Networks, to find samples of the words that might be used to acquit or convict defendants based on their relevance to the algorithm.",
