  "title": "Linguistic Typology Features from Text: Inferring the Sparse Features of World Atlas of Language Structures",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nThe use of linguistic typological resources in natural language processing has\nbeen steadily gaining more popularity. It has been observed that the use of\ntypological information, often combined with distributed language representations,\nleads to significantly more powerful models. While linguistic typology\nrepresentations from various resources have mostly been used for conditioning\nthe models, there has been relatively little attention on predicting features\nfrom these resources from the input data. In this paper we investigate whether\nthe various linguistic features from World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS)\ncan be reliably inferred from multi-lingual text. Such a predictor can be used\nto infer structural features for a language never observed in training data.\nWe frame this task as a multi-label classification involving predicting the\nset of non-mutually exclusive and extremely sparse multi-valued labels\n(WALS features). We construct a recurrent neural network predictor based on\nbyte embeddings and convolutional layers and test its performance on 556\nlanguages, providing analysis for various linguistic types, macro-areas,\nlanguage families and individual features. We show that some features from\nvarious linguistic types can be predicted reliably.",
