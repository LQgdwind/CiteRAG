  "title": "FLAC: A Robust Failure-Aware Atomic Commit Protocol for Distributed Transactions (Extended Version)",
  "abstract": "Abstract.\nIn distributed transaction processing, atomic commit protocol (ACP) is used to\nensure database consistency.\nWith the use of commodity compute nodes and networks, failures such as system\ncrashes and network partitioning are common.\nIt is therefore important for ACP to dynamically adapt to the operating\ncondition for efficiency while ensuring the consistency of the database.\nExisting ACPs often assume stable operating conditions,\nhence, they are either non-generalizable to different environments or slow in\npractice.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel and practical ACP, called\nFailure-Aware Atomic Commit (FLAC).\nIn essence, FLAC includes three protocols, which are specifically\ndesigned for three different environments: (i) no failure occurs, (ii)\nparticipant nodes might crash but there is no delayed connection, or (iii) both\ncrashed nodes and delayed connection can occur.\nIt models these environments as the failure-free, crash-failure, and\nnetwork-failure robustness levels.\nDuring its operation, FLAC can monitor if any failure occurs and dynamically\nswitch to operate the most suitable protocol, using a robustness level state\nmachine, whose parameters are fine-tuned by reinforcement learning.\nConsequently, it improves both the response time and throughput, and effectively\nhandles nodes distributed across the Internet where crash and network failures\nmight occur.\nWe implement FLAC in a distributed transactional key-value storage system\nbased on Google Percolator and evaluate its performance with both a micro\nbenchmark and a macro benchmark of real workload.\nThe results show that FLAC achieves up to 2.22x throughput improvement and\n2.82x latency speedup, compared to existing ACPs for high-contention workloads.",
