  "abstract": "Abstract.\nWe develop domain theory in constructive and predicative univalent foundations\n(also known as homotopy type theory). That we work predicatively means that we\ndo not assume Voevodsky‚Äôs propositional resizing axioms. Our work is\nconstructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom\nof (countable) choice.\nDomain theory studies so-called directed complete posets (dcpos) and Scott\ncontinuous maps between them and has applications in a variety of fields, such\nas programming language semantics, higher-type computability and topology.\nA common approach to deal with size issues in a predicative foundation is to\nwork with information systems, abstract bases or formal topologies rather than\ndcpos, and approximable relations rather than Scott continuous functions.\nIn our type-theoretic approach, we instead accept that dcpos may be large and\nwork with type universes to account for this.\nA¬†priori one might expect that iterative constructions of dcpos may result in a need for\never-increasing universes and are predicatively impossible. We show, through a\ncareful tracking of type universe parameters, that such constructions can be\ncarried out in a predicative setting.\nIn particular, we give a predicative reconstruction of Scott‚Äôs D‚àûsubscriptùê∑D_{\\infty}\nmodel of the untyped ŒªùúÜ\\lambda-calculus.\nOur work is formalised in the Agda¬†proof assistant and its ability to infer\nuniverse levels has been invaluable for our purposes.",
