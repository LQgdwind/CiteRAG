  "title": "The Evolutionary Dynamics of Independent Learning Agents in Population Games",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nUnderstanding the evolutionary dynamics of reinforcement learning under multi-agent settings has long remained an open problem.\nWhile previous works primarily focus on 222-player games, we consider population games, which model the strategic interactions of a large population comprising small and anonymous agents.\nThis paper presents a formal relation between stochastic processes and the dynamics of independent learning agents who reason based on the reward signals.\nUsing a master equation approach, we provide a novel unified framework for characterising population dynamics via a single partial differential equation (Theorem 1).\nThrough a case study involving Cross learning agents, we illustrate that Theorem 1 allows us to identify qualitatively different evolutionary dynamics, to analyse steady states, and to gain insights into the expected behaviour of a population.\nIn addition, we present extensive experimental results validating that Theorem 1 holds for a variety of learning methods and population games.",
