  "title": "Massively Parallel Algorithms for Distance Approximation and Spanners",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nOver the past decade, there has been increasing interest in distributed/parallel algorithms for processing large-scale graphs.\nBy now, we have quite fast algorithms—usually sublogarithmic-time and often poly⁡(log⁡log⁡n)poly𝑛\\operatorname{poly}(\\log\\log n)-time,\nor even faster—for a number of fundamental graph problems in the massively parallel computation (𝖬𝖯𝖢𝖬𝖯𝖢\\mathsf{MPC}) model.\nThis model is a widely-adopted theoretical abstraction of MapReduce style settings,\nwhere a number of machines communicate in an all-to-all manner to process large-scale data.\nContributing to this line of work on 𝖬𝖯𝖢𝖬𝖯𝖢\\mathsf{MPC} graph algorithms,\nwe present p​o​l​y​(log⁡k)∈poly⁡(log⁡log⁡n)𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑘poly𝑛poly(\\log k)\\in\\operatorname{poly}(\\log\\log n) round 𝖬𝖯𝖢𝖬𝖯𝖢\\mathsf{MPC} algorithms for computing O​(k1+o​(1))𝑂superscript𝑘1𝑜1O(k^{1+{o(1)}})-spanners\nin the strongly sublinear regime of local memory. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first sublogarithmic-time 𝖬𝖯𝖢𝖬𝖯𝖢\\mathsf{MPC} algorithms for spanner construction.\nAs primary applications of our spanners, we get two important implications, as follows:\n\n\n•\n\nFor the MPC setting, we get an O​(log2⁡log⁡n)𝑂superscript2𝑛O(\\log^{2}\\log n)-round algorithm for O​(log1+o​(1)⁡n)𝑂superscript1𝑜1𝑛O(\\log^{1+o(1)}n) approximation of all pairs shortest paths (APSP) in the near-linear regime of local memory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first sublogarithmic-time 𝖬𝖯𝖢𝖬𝖯𝖢\\mathsf{MPC} algorithm for distance approximations.\n\n\n\n•\n\nOur result above also extends to the Congested Clique model of distributed computing, with the same round complexity and approximation guarantee. This gives the first sub-logarithmic algorithm for approximating APSP in weighted graphs in the Congested Clique model.",
