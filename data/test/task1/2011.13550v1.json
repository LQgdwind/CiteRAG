  "title": "Tight Hardness Results for Training Depth-2 ReLU Networks11footnote 1This work subsumes our earlier manuscript [MR18].",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nWe prove several hardness results for training depth-2 neural networks with the ReLU activation function; these networks are simply weighted sums (that may include negative coefficients) of ReLUs.\nOur goal is to output a depth-2 neural network that minimizes the square loss with respect to a given training set.\nWe prove that this problem is NP-hard already for a network with a single ReLU. We also prove NP-hardness for outputting a weighted sum of k𝑘k ReLUs minimizing the squared error (for k>1𝑘1k>1) even in the realizable setting (i.e., when the labels are consistent with an unknown depth-2 ReLU network).\nWe are also able to obtain lower bounds on the running time\nin terms of the desired additive error ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon. To obtain our lower bounds, we use the Gap Exponential Time Hypothesis (Gap-ETH) as well as a new hypothesis regarding the hardness of approximating the well known Densest κ𝜅\\kappa-Subgraph problem in subexponential time (these hypotheses are used separately in proving different lower bounds).\nFor example, we prove that under reasonable hardness assumptions, any proper learning algorithm for finding the best fitting ReLU must run in time exponential in 1/ϵ21superscriptitalic-ϵ21/\\epsilon^{2}. Together with a previous work regarding improperly learning a ReLU [GKKT17], this implies the first separation between proper and improper algorithms for learning a ReLU. We also study the problem of properly learning a depth-2 network of ReLUs with bounded weights giving new (worst-case) upper bounds on the running time needed to learn such networks both in the realizable and agnostic settings. Our upper bounds on the running time essentially matches our lower bounds in terms of the dependency on ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon.",
