  "abstract": "Abstract\nThe ferromagnetic Ising model is a model of a magnetic material and a central topic in statistical physics. It also plays a starring role in the algorithmic study of approximate counting: approximating the partition function of the ferromagnetic Ising model with uniform external field is tractable at all temperatures and on all graphs, due to the randomized algorithm of Jerrum and Sinclair.\nHere we show that hidden inside the model are hard computational problems. For the class of bounded-degree graphs we find computational thresholds for the approximate counting and sampling problems for the ferromagnetic Ising model at fixed magnetization (that is, fixing the number of +11+1 and −11-1 spins).\nIn particular, letting βc​(Δ)subscript𝛽𝑐Δ\\beta_{c}(\\Delta) denote the critical inverse temperature of the zero-field Ising model on the infinite ΔΔ\\Delta-regular tree, and ηΔ,β,1+superscriptsubscript𝜂Δ𝛽1\\eta_{\\Delta,\\beta,1}^{+} denote the mean magnetization of the zero-field ++ measure on the infinite ΔΔ\\Delta-regular tree at inverse temperature β𝛽\\beta, we prove, for the class of graphs of maximum degree ΔΔ\\Delta:\n\n\n1.\n\nFor β<βc​(Δ)𝛽subscript𝛽𝑐Δ\\beta<\\beta_{c}(\\Delta) there is an FPRAS and efficient sampling scheme for the fixed-magnetization Ising model for all magnetizations η𝜂\\eta.\n\n\n\n2.\n\nFor β>βc​(Δ)𝛽subscript𝛽𝑐Δ\\beta>\\beta_{c}(\\Delta), there is an FPRAS and efficient sampling scheme for the fixed-magnetization Ising model for magnetizations η𝜂\\eta such that |η|>ηΔ,β,1+𝜂superscriptsubscript𝜂Δ𝛽1|\\eta|>\\eta_{\\Delta,\\beta,1}^{+}.\n\n\n\n3.\n\nFor β>βc​(Δ)𝛽subscript𝛽𝑐Δ\\beta>\\beta_{c}(\\Delta), there is no FPRAS for the fixed-magnetization Ising model for magnetizations η𝜂\\eta such that |η|<ηΔ,β,1+𝜂superscriptsubscript𝜂Δ𝛽1|\\eta|<\\eta_{\\Delta,\\beta,1}^{+} unless NP=RP.",
