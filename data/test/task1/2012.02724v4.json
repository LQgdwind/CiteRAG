  "title": "The Treachery of Images in the Digital Sovereignty Debate",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nThis short theoretical and argumentative essay contributes to the\nongoing deliberation about the so-called digital sovereignty, as pursued\nparticularly in the European Union (EU). Drawing from classical political\nscience literature, the essay approaches the debate through paradoxes that arise\nfrom applying classical notions of sovereignty to the digital domain. With these\nparadoxes and a focus on the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, the essay develops a\nviewpoint distinct from the conventional territorial notion of\nsovereignty. Accordingly, the lesson from Westphalia has more to do with the\ncapacity of a state to govern. It is also this capacity that is argued to enable\nthe sovereignty of individuals within the digital realm. With this viewpoint,\nthe essay further advances another, broader, and more pressing debate on\npolitics and democracy in the digital era.\n\nKeywords: digital democracy, conceptual stretching, self-sovereignty, Westphalia, territoriality, strategic autonomy",
