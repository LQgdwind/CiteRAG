  "title": "On a Built-in Conflict between Deep Learning and Systematic Generalization",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we hypothesize that internal function sharing is one of the reasons to weaken o.o.d. or systematic generalization in deep learning for classification tasks.\nUnder equivalent prediction, a model partitions an input space into multiple parts separated by boundaries.\nThe function sharing prefers to reuse boundaries, leading to fewer parts for new outputs, which conflicts with systematic generalization.\nWe show such phenomena in standard deep learning models, such as fully connected, convolutional, residual networks, LSTMs, and (Vision) Transformers.\nWe hope this study provides novel insights into systematic generalization and forms a basis for new research directions.\nSource codes are available at https://github.com/yuanpeng16/BCDLSG.",
