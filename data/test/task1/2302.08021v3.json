  "title": "Fourier Analysis Meets Runtime Analysis: Precise Runtimes on Plateaus",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nWe propose a new method based on discrete Fourier analysis to analyze the time evolutionary algorithms\nspend on plateaus. This immediately gives a concise proof of the classic estimate of the expected runtime of the (1+1)11(1+1) evolutionary algorithm on the Needle\nproblem due to Garnier, Kallel, and Schoenauer (1999).\nWe also use this\nmethod to analyze the runtime of the (1+1)11(1+1) evolutionary algorithm on a\nbenchmark consisting of n/‚Ñìùëõ‚Ñìn/\\ell plateaus of effective size 2‚Ñì‚àí1superscript2‚Ñì12^{\\ell}-1 which\nhave to be optimized sequentially in a LeadingOnes fashion.\nUsing our new method, we determine\nthe precise expected runtime both for static and fitness-dependent\nmutation rates. We also determine the asymptotically optimal static and fitness-dependent mutation rates.\nFor ‚Ñì=o‚Äã(n)‚Ñìùëúùëõ\\ell=o(n), the optimal static mutation rate is approximately 1.59/n1.59ùëõ1.59/n. The optimal fitness dependent mutation rate, when the first kùëòk fitness-relevant bits have been found, is asymptotically 1/(k+1)1ùëò11/(k+1). These results, so far only proven for the single-instance problem LeadingOnes, thus hold for a much broader class of problems. We expect similar extensions to be true for other important results on LeadingOnes. We are also optimistic that our Fourier analysis approach can be applied to other plateau problems as well.",
