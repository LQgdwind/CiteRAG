  "title": "Almost Perfect Mutually Unbiased Bases that are Sparse",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nIn dimension d𝑑d, Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs) are a collection of orthonormal bases over ℂdsuperscriptℂ𝑑\\mathbb{C}^{d} such that for any two vectors v1,v2subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2v_{1},v_{2} belonging to different bases, the dot or scalar product |⟨v1|v2⟩|=1dinner-productsubscript𝑣1subscript𝑣21𝑑|\\braket{v_{1}}{v_{2}}|=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}. The upper bound on the number of such bases is d+1𝑑1d+1. Construction methods to achieve this bound are known for cases when d𝑑d is some power of prime. The situation is more restrictive in other cases and also when we consider the results over real rather than complex. Thus, certain relaxations of this model are considered in literature and consequently Approximate MUBs (AMUB) are studied. This enables one to construct potentially large number of such objects for ℂdsuperscriptℂ𝑑\\mathbb{C}^{d} as well as in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}. In this regard, we propose the concept of Almost Perfect MUBs (APMUB), where we restrict the absolute value of inner product |⟨v1|v2⟩|inner-productsubscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2|\\braket{v_{1}}{v_{2}}| to be two-valued, one being 0 and the other ≤1+𝒪​(d−λ)dabsent1𝒪superscript𝑑𝜆𝑑\\leq\\frac{1+\\mathcal{O}(d^{-\\lambda})}{\\sqrt{d}}, such that λ>0𝜆0\\lambda>0 and the numerator 1+𝒪​(d−λ)≤21𝒪superscript𝑑𝜆21+\\mathcal{O}(d^{-\\lambda})\\leq 2. Each such vector constructed, has an important feature that large number of its components are zero and the non-zero components are of equal magnitude. Our techniques are based on combinatorial structures related to Resolvable Block Designs (RBDs). We show that for several composite dimensions d𝑑d, one can construct 𝒪​(d)𝒪𝑑\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{d}) many APMUBs, in which cases the number of MUBs are significantly small. To be specific, this result works for d𝑑d of the form (q−e)​(q+f),q,e,f∈ℕ𝑞𝑒𝑞𝑓𝑞𝑒𝑓ℕ(q-e)(q+f),\\ q,e,f\\in\\mathbb{N}, with the conditions 0≤f≤e0𝑓𝑒0\\leq f\\leq e for constant e,f𝑒𝑓e,f and q𝑞q some power of prime. We also show that such APMUBs provide sets of Bi-angular vectors which are of the order of 𝒪​(d3/2)𝒪superscript𝑑32\\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2}) in numbers, having high angular distances among them.",
