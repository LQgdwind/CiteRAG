  "abstract": "Abstract.\nThis paper presents computationally feasible rank-one relaxation algorithms for the efficient simulation of a time-incremental damage model with nonconvex incremental stress potentials in multiple spatial dimensions.\nWhile the standard model suffers from numerical issues due to the lack of convexity, the relaxation by rank-one convexification prevents non-existence of minimizers and mesh dependence of the solutions of finite element discretizations.\nBy the combination, modification and parallelization of the underlying convexification algorithms, the novel approach becomes computationally feasible.\nA descent method and a Newton scheme enhanced by step-size control prevent stability issues related to local minima in the energy landscape and the computation of derivatives.\nNumerical techniques for the construction of continuous derivatives of the approximated rank-one convex envelope are discussed.\nA series of numerical experiments demonstrates the ability of the computationally relaxed model to capture softening effects and the mesh independence of the computed approximations.\nAn interpretation in terms of microstructural damage evolution is given, based on the rank-one lamination process.",
