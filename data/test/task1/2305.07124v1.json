  "title": "Complexity of Efficient Outcomes in Binary-Action Polymatrix Games with Implications for Coordination Problems",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nWe investigate the difficulty of finding economically efficient solutions to coordination problems on graphs.\nOur work focuses on two forms of coordination problem: pure-coordination games and anti-coordination games.\nWe consider three objectives in the context of simple binary-action polymatrix games: (i) maximizing welfare, (ii) maximizing potential, and (iii) finding a welfare-maximizing Nash equilibrium.\nWe introduce an intermediate, new graph-partition problem, termed MaximumWeightedDigraphPartition, which is of independent interest, and we provide a complexity dichotomy for it.\nThis dichotomy, among other results, provides as a corollary a dichotomy for Objective (i) for general binary-action polymatrix games.\nIn addition, it reveals that the complexity of achieving these objectives varies depending on the form of the coordination problem.\nSpecifically, Objectives (i) and (ii) can be efficiently solved in pure-coordination games, but are NP-hard in anti-coordination games.\nFinally, we show that objective (iii) is NP-hard even for simple non-trivial pure-coordination games.",
