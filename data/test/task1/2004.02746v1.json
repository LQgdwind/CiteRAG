  "title": "A new approach for generation of generalized basic probability assignment in the evidence theory",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nThe process of information fusion needs to deal with a large number of uncertain information with multi-source, heterogeneity, inaccuracy, unreliability, and incompleteness.\nIn practical engineering applications, Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is widely used in multi-source information fusion owing to its effectiveness in data fusion.\nInformation sources have an important impact on multi-source information fusion in an environment of complex, unstable, uncertain, and incomplete characteristics.\nTo address multi-source information fusion problem, this paper considers the situation of uncertain information modeling from the closed world to the open world assumption and studies the generation of basic probability assignment (BPA) with incomplete information.\nIn this paper, a new method is proposed to generate generalized basic probability assignment (GBPA) based on the triangular fuzzy number model under the open world assumption.\nThe proposed method can not only be used in different complex environments simply and flexibly, but also have less information loss in information processing.\nFinally, a series of comprehensive experiments basing on the UCI data sets are used to verify the rationality and superiority of the proposed method.",
