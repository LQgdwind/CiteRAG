  "title": "A New Conjecture on Hardness of Low-Degree 2-CSP‚Äôs with Implications to Hardness of Densest ùëò-Subgraph and Other Problems",
  "abstract": "We propose a new conjecture on hardness of low-degree 222-CSP‚Äôs, and show that new hardness of approximation results for Densest kùëòk-Subgraph and several other problems, including a graph partitioning problem, and a variation of the Graph Crossing Number problem, follow from this conjecture. The conjecture can be viewed as occupying a middle ground between the dùëëd-to-111 conjecture, and hardness results for 222-CSP‚Äôs that can be obtained via standard techniques, such as Parallel Repetition combined with standard 222-prover protocols for the 3SAT problem. We hope that this work will motivate further exploration of hardness of 222-CSP‚Äôs in the regimes arising from the conjecture. We believe that a positive resolution of the conjecture will provide a good starting point for further hardness of approximation proofs.\nAnother contribution of our work is proving that the problems that we consider are roughly equivalent from the approximation perspective. Some of these problems arose in previous work, from which it appeared that they may be related to each other. We formalize this relationship in this work.",
