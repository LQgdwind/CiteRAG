  "title": "RESEARCH PROPOSAL Toward a traceable, explainable, and fair JD/Resume recommendation system",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the last few decades, companies are interested to adopt an online automated recruitment process in an international recruitment environment. The problem is that the recruitment of employees through the manual procedure is a time and money consuming process. The manual recruitment process could also possibly be erroneous in hiring incompetent individuals. As a result, processing a significant number of applications through conventional methods can lead to the recruitment of clumsy individuals. Different JD/Resume matching model architectures have been proposed and reveal a high accuracy level in selecting relevant candidates for the required job positions.\nHowever, the development of an automatic recruitment system is still one of the main challenges. The reason is that the development of a fully automated recruitment system is a difficult task and poses different challenges. For example, providing a detailed matching explanation for the targeted stakeholders (candidate recruiter, company who posted the job) is needed to ensure a transparent recommendation.\nThere are several ontologies and knowledge bases that represent skills and competencies (e.g, ESCO, O*NET) that are used to identify the candidate and the required job skills for a matching purpose. Besides, modern pre-trained language models are fine-tuned for this context such as identifying lines where a specific feature was introduced. Typically, pre-trained language models use transfer-based machine learning models to be fine-tuned for a specific field. However, a combination of ontologies knowledge bases with modern language models is missing. In this proposal, our aim is to explore how modern language models (based on transformers) can be combined with knowledge bases and ontologies to enhance the JD/Resume matching process.\nOur system aims at using knowledge bases and features to support the explainability of the JD/Resume matching. Finally, given that multiple software components, datasets, ontology, and machine learning models will be explored, we aim at proposing a fair, explainable, and traceable architecture for a Resume/JD matching purpose.\nAs a first step, a systematic literature review is conducted to understand the available models of resume/ job matching architecture, the features used to address the matching, and the evaluation metrics used in the experiences.\nResults of this thesis are targeted to make such e-recruitment become suitable for a fair JD/Resume matching; providing an explanation to the concerned stakeholders and keep a traceable, scalable JD/Resume recommendation system environment. The machine learning models’ performance will be evaluated on a gold dataset provided by Airudi, using the normalized discounted cumulative gain according to the number of recommended candidates.\nKeywords: Job Matching, Traceability, Explainability, Machine Learning.",
