  "title": "Algorithmic recourse under imperfect causal knowledge: a probabilistic approach",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nRecent work has discussed the limitations of counterfactual explanations to recommend actions for algorithmic recourse, and argued for the need of taking causal relationships between features into consideration.\nUnfortunately, in practice, the true underlying\nstructural\ncausal model\nis generally unknown.\nIn this work, we first show that it is impossible to guarantee recourse without access to the true structural equations.\nTo address this limitation, we propose two probabilistic approaches to select optimal actions that achieve recourse with high probability\ngiven limited causal knowledge (e.g., only the causal graph).\nThe first captures uncertainty over structural equations under additive Gaussian noise, and uses Bayesian model averaging to estimate the counterfactual distribution.\nThe second removes any assumptions on the structural equations by instead computing the average effect of recourse actions on individuals similar to the person who seeks recourse, leading to a novel subpopulation-based interventional notion of recourse.\nWe then derive a gradient-based procedure for selecting optimal recourse actions, and empirically show that the proposed approaches lead to more reliable recommendations under imperfect\ncausal knowledge than non-probabilistic baselines.",
