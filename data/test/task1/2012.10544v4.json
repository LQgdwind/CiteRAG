  "title": "Dataset Security for Machine Learning: Data Poisoning, Backdoor Attacks, and Defenses",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nAs machine learning systems grow in scale, so do their training data requirements, forcing practitioners to automate and outsource the curation of training data in order to achieve state-of-the-art performance.\nThe absence of trustworthy human supervision over the data collection process exposes organizations to security vulnerabilities; training data can be manipulated to control and degrade the downstream behaviors of learned models. The goal of this work is to systematically categorize and discuss a wide range of dataset vulnerabilities and exploits, approaches for defending against these threats, and an array of open problems in this space. In addition to describing various poisoning and backdoor threat models and the relationships among them, we develop their unified taxonomy.",
