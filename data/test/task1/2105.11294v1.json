  "title": "Introducing the Talk Markup Language (TalkML)",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nVirtual Personal Assistants like Siri have great potential but such\ndevelopments hit the fundamental problem of how to make computational devices\nthat understand human speech. Natural language understanding is one of\nthe more disappointing failures of AI research and it seems there is something\nwe computer scientists don’t get about the nature of language. Of course\nphilosophers and linguists think quite differently about language and this\npaper describes how we have taken ideas from other disciplines and implemented\nthem. The background to the work is to take seriously the notion of language\nas action austin ; searle69  and look at what people actually do with\nlanguage using the techniques of Conversation\nAnalysis sacks ; HutWoo98 ; tHave99 . The observation has been that human\ncommunication is (behind the scenes) about the management of social relations\nas well as the (foregrounded) passing of information. To claim this is one\nthing but to implement it requires a mechanism. The mechanism described here\nis based on the notion of language being intentional – we think intentionally,\ntalk about them and recognize them in others – and cooperative in that we are\ncompelled to help out tomasello08 .\nThe way we are compelled points to a solution to the ever present problem of\nkeeping the human on topic. The approach has led to a recent success in which\nwe significantly improve user satisfaction independent of task\ncompletion wcl14  and the work described here shows how the approach\nmight impact on commercial interests. VoiceXML is a default industrial\nstandard used to script automated telephone conversations and is based on the\nnotion of using forms to update information state. Talk Markup Language\n(TalkML)\nis a draft alternative to VoiceXML that, we propose, greatly simplifies the\nscripting of interaction. By embracing the intentional nature of language and\nattending to its social side, we provide default behaviour for the two VoiceXML\ngrammar exceptions, nomatch and noinput.",
