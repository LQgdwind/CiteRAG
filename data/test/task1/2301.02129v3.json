  "abstract": "Abstract\nAdversarial team games model multiplayer strategic interactions in which a team of identically-interested players is competing against an adversarial player in a zero-sum game. Such games capture many well-studied settings in game theory, such as congestion games, but go well-beyond to environments wherein the cooperation of one team‚Äîin the absence of explicit communication‚Äîis obstructed by competing entities; the latter setting remains poorly understood despite its numerous applications. Since the seminal work of Von Stengel and Koller (GEB ‚Äò97), different solution concepts have received attention from an algorithmic standpoint. Yet, the complexity of the standard Nash equilibrium has remained open.\nIn this paper, we settle this question by showing that computing a Nash equilibrium in adversarial team games belongs to the class continuous local search (\\ComplexityFont‚ÄãC‚ÄãL‚ÄãS\\ComplexityFontùê∂ùêøùëÜ\\ComplexityFont{CLS}), thereby establishing \\ComplexityFont‚ÄãC‚ÄãL‚ÄãS\\ComplexityFontùê∂ùêøùëÜ\\ComplexityFont{CLS}-completeness by virtue of the recent \\ComplexityFont‚ÄãC‚ÄãL‚ÄãS\\ComplexityFontùê∂ùêøùëÜ\\ComplexityFont{CLS}-hardness result of Rubinstein and Babichenko (STOC ‚Äò21) in potential games. To do so, we leverage linear programming duality to prove that any œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-approximate stationary strategy for the team can be extended in polynomial time to an O‚Äã(œµ)ùëÇitalic-œµO(\\epsilon)-approximate Nash equilibrium, where the O‚Äã(‚ãÖ)ùëÇ‚ãÖO(\\cdot) notation suppresses polynomial factors. As a consequence, we show that the Moreau envelop of a suitable best response function acts as a potential under certain natural gradient-based dynamics.",
