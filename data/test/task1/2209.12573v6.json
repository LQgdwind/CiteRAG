  "title": "Faked Speech Detection with Zero Knowledge",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nAudio is one of the most used ways of human communication, but at the same time it can be easily misused to trick people.\nWith the revolution of AI, the related technologies are now accessible to almost everyone thus making it simple for the criminals to commit crimes and forgeries.\nIn this work, we introduce a neural network method to develop a classifier that will blindly classify an input audio as real or mimicked; the word ’blindly’ refers to the ability to detect mimicked audio without references or real sources.\nThe proposed model was trained on a set of important features extracted from a large dataset of audios to get a classifier that was tested on the same set of features from different audios.\nThe data was extracted from two raw datasets, especially composed for this work; an all English dataset and a mixed dataset (Arabic plus English).\nThese datasets have been made available, in raw form, through GitHub for the use of the research community at https://github.com/SaSs7/Dataset.\nFor the purpose of comparison, the audios were also classified through human inspection with the subjects being the native speakers.\nThe ensued results were interesting and exhibited formidable accuracy.",
