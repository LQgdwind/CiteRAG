  "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this paper we provide oracle complexity lower bounds for finding a point in a given set using a memory-constrained algorithm that has access to a separation oracle. We assume that the set is contained within the unit d𝑑d-dimensional ball and contains a ball of known radius ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0. This setup is commonly referred to as the feasibility problem. We show that to solve feasibility problems with accuracy ϵ≥e−do​(1)italic-ϵsuperscript𝑒superscript𝑑𝑜1\\epsilon\\geq e^{-d^{o(1)}}, any deterministic algorithm either uses d1+δsuperscript𝑑1𝛿d^{1+\\delta} bits of memory or must make at least 1/(d0.01​δ​ϵ2​1−δ1+1.01​δ−o​(1))1superscript𝑑0.01𝛿superscriptitalic-ϵ21𝛿11.01𝛿𝑜11/(d^{0.01\\delta}\\epsilon^{2\\frac{1-\\delta}{1+1.01\\delta}-o(1)}) oracle queries, for any δ∈[0,1]𝛿01\\delta\\in[0,1]. Additionally, we show that randomized algorithms either use d1+δsuperscript𝑑1𝛿d^{1+\\delta} memory or make at least 1/(d2​δ​ϵ2​(1−4​δ)−o​(1))1superscript𝑑2𝛿superscriptitalic-ϵ214𝛿𝑜11/(d^{2\\delta}\\epsilon^{2(1-4\\delta)-o(1)}) queries for any δ∈[0,14]𝛿014\\delta\\in[0,\\frac{1}{4}]. Because gradient descent only uses linear memory 𝒪​(d​ln⁡1/ϵ)𝒪𝑑1italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(d\\ln 1/\\epsilon) but makes Ω​(1/ϵ2)Ω1superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\Omega(1/\\epsilon^{2}) queries, our results imply that it is Pareto-optimal in the oracle complexity/memory tradeoff. Further, our results show that the oracle complexity for deterministic algorithms is always polynomial in 1/ϵ1italic-ϵ1/\\epsilon if the algorithm has less than quadratic memory in d𝑑d. This reveals a sharp phase transition since with quadratic 𝒪​(d2​ln⁡1/ϵ)𝒪superscript𝑑21italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(d^{2}\\ln 1/\\epsilon) memory, cutting plane methods only require 𝒪​(d​ln⁡1/ϵ)𝒪𝑑1italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(d\\ln 1/\\epsilon) queries.",
