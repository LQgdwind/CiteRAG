  "abstract": "Abstract\nWe propose a solution to the novel task of rendering sharp videos from new viewpoints from a single motion-blurred image of a face.\nOur method111Code and data available at https://gmeishvili.github.io/deblur_and_rotate_motion_blurred_faces/index.html. handles the complexity of face blur by implicitly learning the geometry and motion of faces through the joint training on three large datasets: FFHQ and 300VW, which are publicly available, and a new Bern Multi-View Face Dataset (BMFD) that we built.\nThe first two datasets provide a large variety of faces and allow our model to generalize better.\nBMFD instead allows us to introduce multi-view constraints, which are crucial to synthesizing sharp videos from a new camera view.\nIt consists of high frame rate synchronized videos from multiple views of several subjects displaying a wide range of facial expressions.\nWe use the high frame rate videos to simulate realistic motion blur through averaging.\nThanks to this dataset, we train a neural network to reconstruct a 3D video representation from a single image and the corresponding face gaze.\nWe then provide a camera viewpoint relative to the estimated gaze and the blurry image as input to an encoder-decoder network to generate a video of sharp frames with a novel camera viewpoint.\nWe demonstrate our approach on test subjects of our multi-view dataset and VIDTIMIT.",
