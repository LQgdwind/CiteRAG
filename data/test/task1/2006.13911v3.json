  "abstract": "Abstract\nAn acyclic rùëür-coloring of a directed graph G=(V,E)ùê∫ùëâùê∏G=(V,E) is a\npartition of the vertex set VùëâV into rùëür acyclic sets. The dichromatic\nnumber of a directed graph Gùê∫G is the smallest rùëür such that Gùê∫G\nallows an acyclic rùëür-coloring. For symmetric digraphs the dichromatic number equals\nthe well-known chromatic number of the underlying undirected graph.\nThis allows us to carry over the W‚Äã[1]Wdelimited-[]1\\mbox{W}[1]-hardness and lower bounds for running times\nof the chromatic number problem parameterized by clique-width\nto the dichromatic number problem parameterized by directed\nclique-width.\nWe introduce the first polynomial-time algorithm for the acyclic coloring problem\non digraphs of constant directed clique-width.\nFrom a parameterized point of view our algorithm shows that\nthe Dichromatic Number problem is in XP when parameterized by directed clique-width\nand extends the only known structural parameterization by directed modular width for this problem.\nFurthermore, we apply defineability within monadic second order logic\nin order to show that Dichromatic Number problem is in FPT when parameterized by the directed clique-width\nand rùëür.\nFor directed co-graphs, which is a class of digraphs of directed clique-width 2, and several\ngeneralizations we even show linear time solutions for computing the\ndichromatic number. Furthermore, we conclude that directed co-graphs and\nthe considered generalizations lead to subclasses of perfect digraphs.\nFor directed cactus forests, which is a set of digraphs of directed tree-width 1,\nwe conclude an upper bound of 222 for the\ndichromatic number and we show that an optimal acyclic coloring\ncan be computed in linear time.\n\nKeywords:\nacyclic coloring; directed clique-width; directed co-graphs; polynomial time algorithms",
