  "abstract": "Abstract\nGiven a set PP of nn points in the plane, its unit-disk graph G​(P)G(P) is a graph with PP as its vertex set such that two points of PP are connected by an edge if their (Euclidean) distance is at most 11. We consider several classical problems on G​(P)G(P) in a special setting when points of PP are in convex position. These problems are all NP-hard in the general case. We present efficient algorithms for these problems under the convex position assumption.\n\n\n•\n\nFor the problem of finding the smallest dominating set of G​(P)G(P), we present an O​(k​n​log⁡n)O(kn\\log n) time algorithm, where kk is the smallest dominating set size. We also consider the weighted case in which each point of PP has a weight and the goal is to find a dominating set in G​(P)G(P) with minimum total weight; our algorithm runs in O​(n3​log2⁡n)O(n^{3}\\log^{2}n) time. In particular, for a given kk, our algorithm can compute in O​(k​n2​log2⁡n)O(kn^{2}\\log^{2}n) time a minimum weight dominating set of size at most kk (if it exists).\n\n\n\n•\n\nFor the discrete kk-center problem, which is to find a subset of kk points in PP (called centers) for a given kk, such that the maximum distance between any point in PP and its nearest center is minimized.\nWe present an algorithm that solves the problem in O​(min⁡{n4/3​log⁡n+k​n​log2⁡n,k2​n​log2⁡n})O(\\min\\{n^{4/3}\\log n+kn\\log^{2}n,k^{2}n\\log^{2}n\\}) time, which is O​(n2​log2⁡n)O(n^{2}\\log^{2}n) in the worst case when k=Θ​(n)k=\\Theta(n). For comparison, the runtime of the current best algorithm for the continuous version of the problem where centers can be anywhere in the plane is O​(n3​log⁡n)O(n^{3}\\log n).\n\n\n\n•\n\nFor the problem of finding a maximum independent set in G​(P)G(P), we give an algorithm of O​(n7/2)O(n^{7/2}) time and another randomized algorithm of O​(n37/11)O(n^{37/11}) expected time, which improve the previous best result of O​(n6​log⁡n)O(n^{6}\\log n) time. Our algorithms can be extended to compute a maximum-weight independent set in G​(P)G(P) with the same time complexities when points of PP have weights.\n\n\n\n\n–\n\nIf we are looking for an (unweighted) independent set of size 33, we derive an algorithm of O​(n​log⁡n)O(n\\log n) time; the previous best algorithm runs in O​(n4/3​log2⁡n)O(n^{4/3}\\log^{2}n) time (which works for the general case where points of PP are not necessarily in convex position).\n\n\n\n–\n\nIf points of PP have weights and are not necessarily in convex position, we present an algorithm that can find a maximum-weight independent set of size 33 in O​(n5/3+δ)O(n^{5/3+\\delta}) time for an arbitrarily small constant δ>0\\delta>0. By slightly modifying the algorithm, a maximum-weight clique of size 33 can also be found within the same time complexity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n•\n\nFor the dispersion problem, which is to find a subset of kk points from PP for a given kk, such that the minimum pairwise distance of the points in the subset is maximized. We present an algorithm of O​(n7/2​log⁡n)O(n^{7/2}\\log n) time and another randomized algorithm of O​(n37/11​log⁡n)O(n^{37/11}\\log n) expected time, which improve the previous best result of O​(n6)O(n^{6}) time.\n\n\n\n\n–\n\nIf k=3k=3, we present an algorithm of O​(n​log2⁡n)O(n\\log^{2}n) time and another randomized algorithm of O​(n​log⁡n)O(n\\log n) expected time; the previous best algorithm runs in O​(n4/3​log2⁡n)O(n^{4/3}\\log^{2}n) time (which works for the general case where points of PP are not necessarily in convex position).",
