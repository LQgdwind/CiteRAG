  "title": "A New Information Complexity Measure for Multi-pass Streaming with Applications",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nWe introduce a new notion of information complexity for multi-pass streaming problems and use it to resolve several important questions in data streams:\n\n\n1.\n\nIn the coin problem, one sees a stream of n𝑛n i.i.d. uniform bits and one would like to compute the majority with constant advantage. We show that any constant pass algorithm must use Ω​(log⁡n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(\\log n) bits of memory, significantly extending an earlier Ω​(log⁡n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(\\log n) bit lower bound for single-pass algorithms of Braverman-Garg-Woodruff (FOCS, 2020).\nThis also gives the first Ω​(log⁡n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(\\log n) bit lower bound for the problem of approximating a counter up to a constant factor in worst-case turnstile streams for more than one pass.\n\n\n\n2.\n\nIn the needle problem, one either sees a stream of n𝑛n i.i.d. uniform samples from a domain [t]delimited-[]𝑡[t],\nor there is a randomly chosen “needle\" α∈[t]𝛼delimited-[]𝑡\\alpha\\in[t] for which each item independently is chosen to equal α𝛼\\alpha with probability p𝑝p, and is otherwise uniformly random in [t]delimited-[]𝑡[t]. The problem of distinguishing these two cases is central to understanding the space complexity of the frequency moment estimation problem in random order streams. We show tight multi-pass space bounds for this problem for every p<1/n​log3⁡n𝑝1𝑛superscript3𝑛p<1/\\sqrt{n\\log^{3}n}, resolving an open question of Lovett and Zhang (FOCS, 2023); even for 111-pass our bounds are new. To show optimality, we improve both lower and upper bounds from existing results.\n\n\n\nOur information complexity framework significantly extends the toolkit for proving multi-pass streaming lower bounds, and we give a wide number of additional streaming applications of our lower bound techniques, including multi-pass lower bounds for ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p}-norm estimation, ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p}-point query and heavy hitters, and compressed sensing problems.",
