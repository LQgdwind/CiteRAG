  "title": "Detecting Severity of Diabetic Retinopathy from Fundus Images using Ensembled Transformers",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nDiabetic Retinopathy (DR) is considered one of the primary concerns due to its effect on vision loss among most people with diabetes globally.\nThe severity of DR is mostly comprehended manually by ophthalmologists from fundus photography-based retina images.\nThis paper deals with an automated understanding of the severity stages of DR. In the literature, researchers have focused on this automation using traditional machine learning-based algorithms and convolutional architectures. However, the past works hardly focused on essential parts of the retinal image to improve the model performance.\nIn this paper, we adopt transformer-based learning models to capture the crucial features of retinal images to understand DR severity better.\nWe work with ensembling image transformers, where we adopt four models, namely\nViT (Vision Transformer),\nBEiT (Bidirectional Encoder representation for image Transformer),\nCaiT (Class-Attention in Image Transformers), and\nDeiT (Data efficient image Transformers),\nto infer the degree of DR severity from fundus photographs.\nFor experiments, we used the publicly available APTOS-2019 blindness detection dataset, where the performances of the transformer-based models were quite encouraging.",
