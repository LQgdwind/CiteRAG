  "title": "Various Properties of Various Ultrafilters, Various Graph Width Parameters, and Various Connectivity Systems",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nFilters are collections of sets that are closed under supersets and finite intersections, serving as fundamental tools in topology and set theory. An ultrafilter, a maximal filter on a set, plays a crucial role in these fields by rigorously handling limits, convergence, and compactness. A connectivity system is defined as a pair (X,f)𝑋𝑓(X,f), where X𝑋X is a finite set and f𝑓f is a symmetric submodular function. Understanding the duality in these parameters elucidates the relationship between different decompositions and measures of a graph’s complexity. In this paper, we delve into ultrafilters on connectivity systems, applying Tukey’s Lemma to these systems. Additionally, we explore prefilters, ultra-prefilters, and subbases within the context of connectivity systems. Furthermore, we introduce and investigate new parameters related to width, length, and depth, enhancing our understanding of these mathematical structures. We also investigate and compare various graph width parameters and their related parameters. (It also includes information similar to that found in surveys, aiming to promote future research on graph width parameters.)",
