  "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper deals with the applications of stochastic spectral methods\nfor structural topology optimization in the presence of uncertainties.\nA non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion is integrated into a topology\noptimization algorithm to calculate\nlow-order statistical moments of the mechanical-mathematical model response.\nThis procedure, known as robust topology optimization, can optimize the mean of the\ncompliance while simultaneously minimizing its standard deviation.\nIn order to address possible variabilities in the loads applied to the\nmechanical system of interest, magnitude and direction of the external forces are assumed to be uncertain.\nIn this probabilistic framework, forces are described as a random field or a set of random variables.\nRepresentation of the random objects and propagation of load uncertainties through the model\nare efficiently done through Karhunen–Loève and polynomial chaos expansions.\nWe take advantage of using polygonal elements, which have been shown to be effective in suppressing checkerboard patterns and reducing mesh dependency in the solution of topology optimization problems.\nAccuracy and applicability of the proposed methodology are demonstrated by means\nof several topology optimization examples.\nThe obtained results, which are in excellent\nagreement with reference solutions computed via Monte Carlo method, show that load uncertainties play\nan important role in optimal design of structural systems, so that they must be taken into account to\nensure a reliable optimization process.",
