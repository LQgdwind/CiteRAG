  "abstract": "Abstract\nWe give new and efficient black-box reconstruction algorithms for some classes of depth-333 arithmetic circuits. As a consequence, we obtain the first efficient algorithm for computing the tensor rank and for finding the optimal tensor decomposition as a sum of rank-one tensors when then input is a constant-rank tensor. More specifically, we provide efficient learning algorithms that run in randomized polynomial time over general fields and in deterministic polynomial time over ‚Ñù‚Ñù{\\mathbb{R}} and ‚ÑÇ‚ÑÇ{\\mathbb{C}} for the following classes:\n\n\n1.\n\nSet-multilinear depth-333 circuits of constant top fan-in (Œ£‚ÄãŒ†‚ÄãŒ£{‚äîjXj}‚Äã(k)Œ£Œ†subscriptŒ£subscriptsquare-unionùëósubscriptùëãùëóùëò\\Sigma\\Pi\\Sigma_{{\\left\\{\\sqcup_{j}X_{j}\\right\\}}}(k) circuits). As a consequence of our algorithm, we obtain the first polynomial time algorithm for tensor rank computation and optimal tensor decomposition of constant-rank tensors. This result holds for dùëëd dimensional tensors for any dùëëd, but is interesting even for d=3ùëë3d=3.\n\n\n\n2.\n\nSums of powers of constantly many linear forms (Œ£‚àßŒ£‚Äã(k)Œ£Œ£ùëò\\Sigma\\!\\wedge\\!\\Sigma(k) circuits). As a consequence we obtain the first polynomial-time algorithm for tensor rank computation and optimal tensor decomposition of constant-rank symmetric tensors.\n\n\n\n3.\n\nMultilinear depth-3 circuits of constant top fan-in (multilinear Œ£‚ÄãŒ†‚ÄãŒ£‚Äã(k)Œ£Œ†Œ£ùëò\\Sigma\\Pi\\Sigma(k) circuits). Our algorithm works over all fields of characteristic 0 or large enough characteristic. Prior to our work the only efficient algorithms known were over polynomially-sized finite fields [KS09a].\n\n\n\nPrior to our work, the only polynomial-time or even subexponential-time algorithms known (deterministic or randomized) for subclasses of Œ£‚ÄãŒ†‚ÄãŒ£‚Äã(k)Œ£Œ†Œ£ùëò\\Sigma\\Pi\\Sigma(k) circuits that also work over large/infinite fields were for the setting when the top fan-in kùëòk is at most 222 [Sin16, Sin20].",
