  "title": "The Impact of Heterogeneity and Geometry on the Proof Complexity of Random SatisfiabilityThis work is partially funded by the project Scale-Free Satisfiability (project no. 416061626) of the German Research Foundation (DFG).",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nSatisfiability is considered the canonical NP-complete problem and\nis used as a starting point for hardness reductions in theory, while\nin practice heuristic SAT solving algorithms can solve large-scale\nindustrial SAT instances very efficiently. This disparity between\ntheory and practice is believed to be a result of inherent\nproperties of industrial SAT instances that make them tractable.\nTwo characteristic properties seem to be prevalent in the majority\nof real-world SAT instances, heterogeneous degree distribution and\nlocality. To understand the impact of these two properties on SAT,\nwe study the proof complexity of random kùëòk-SAT models that allow to\ncontrol heterogeneity and locality. Our findings show that\nheterogeneity alone does not make SAT easy as heterogeneous random\nkùëòk-SAT instances have superpolynomial resolution size. This\nimplies intractability of these instances for modern SAT-solvers.\nOn the other hand, modeling locality with an underlying geometry\nleads to small unsatisfiable subformulas, which can be found within\npolynomial time.\nA key ingredient for the result on geometric random kùëòk-SAT can be\nfound in the complexity of higher-order Voronoi diagrams. As an\nadditional technical contribution, we show an upper bound on the\nnumber of non-empty Voronoi regions, that holds for points with\nrandom positions in a very general setting. In particular, it\ncovers arbitrary ùî≠ùî≠{\\mathfrak{p}}-norms, higher dimensions, and weights\naffecting the area of influence of each point multiplicatively. Our\nbound is linear in the total weight. This is in stark contrast to\nquadratic lower bounds for the worst case.",
