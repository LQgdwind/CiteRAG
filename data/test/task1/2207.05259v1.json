  "title": "Language-Based Causal Representation Learning",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nConsider the finite state graph that results from a simple, discrete, dynamical system\nin which an agent moves in a rectangular grid picking up and dropping packages.\nCan the state variables of the problem, namely, the agent location and the package\nlocations, be recovered from the structure of the state graph alone\nwithout having access to information about the objects, the structure of the states, or any background knowledge?\nWe show that this is possible provided that the dynamics is learned over a suitable\ndomain-independent first-order causal language that makes room for objects\nand relations that are not assumed to be known. The preference for the\nmost compact representation in the language that is compatible with the data provides\na strong and meaningful learning bias that makes this possible.\nThe language of structured causal models (SCMs) is the standard language for representing (static) causal models\nbut in dynamic worlds populated by objects, first-order causal languages such as those used\nin “classical AI planning” are required. While “classical AI” requires handcrafted representations,\nsimilar representations can be learned from unstructured data over the same languages.\nIndeed, it is the languages and the preference for compact representations in those languages\nthat provide structure to the world, uncovering objects, relations, and causes.∗00footnotetext: The paper was written for a workshop on causal representation learning.\nA valid criticism of “classical AI”, mentioned in the call, from the perspective of the\n“new AI” based on deep learning, is that representations should be learned and not handcrafted.\nOne of the aims of the paper was to distinguish representation languages from the actual\nrepresentations that they support, as it is only the latter that should be learned. Another aim\nwas to emphasize that structural causal models (SCMs) provide one language to talk about causal\nmodels but not the only one. Action and planning languages have been used to describe causal\nmodels in AI for a long time too. Our attempt, however, was not successful, as the paper was\nrejected. Not clear if reviewers agreed with these two premises, or found them irrelevant or\nvacuous. For us, the two premises are direct but their implications, explored in this and other\npapers, are not.",
