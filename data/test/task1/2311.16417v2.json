  "abstract": "Abstract\nFast-evolving artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as large language models have been driving the ever-increasing computing demands in today’s data centers.\nHeterogeneous computing with domain-specific architectures (DSAs) brings many opportunities when scaling up and scaling out the computing system.\nIn particular, heterogeneous chiplet architecture is favored to keep scaling up and scaling out the system as well as to reduce the design complexity and the cost stemming from the traditional monolithic chip design.\nHowever, how to interconnect computing resources and orchestrate heterogeneous chiplets is the key to success.\nIn this paper, we first discuss the diversity and evolving demands of different AI workloads.\nWe discuss how chiplet brings better cost efficiency and shorter time to market.\nThen we discuss the challenges\nin establishing chiplet interface standards, packaging, and security issues.\nWe further discuss the software programming challenges in chiplet systems.",
