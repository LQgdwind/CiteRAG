  "title": "Modularising Verification of Durable Opacity",
  "abstract": "Abstract.\nNon-volatile memory (NVM), also known as persistent memory, is an emerging paradigm for memory that preserves its contents even after power loss.\nNVM is widely expected to become ubiquitous, and hardware architectures are already providing support for NVM programming.\nThis has stimulated interest in the design of novel concepts ensuring correctness of concurrent programming abstractions in the face of persistency and in the development of associated verification approaches.\nSoftware transactional memory (STM) is a key programming abstraction that supports concurrent access to shared state. In a fashion similar to linearizability as the correctness condition for concurrent data structures, there is an established notion of correctness for STMs known as opacity.\nWe have recently proposed durable opacity as the natural extension of opacity to a setting with\nnon-volatile memory. Together with this novel correctness condition, we designed a verification technique based on refinement. In this paper, we extend this work in two directions.\nFirst, we develop a durably opaque version of NOrec (no ownership records), an existing STM algorithm proven to be opaque.\nSecond, we modularise our existing verification approach by separating the proof of durability\nof memory accesses from the proof of opacity. For NOrec, this allows us to re-use an\nexisting opacity proof and complement it with a proof of the durability of accesses to shared state.",
