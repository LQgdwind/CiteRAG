  "title": "Backdoor Attack on Hash-based Image Retrieval via Clean-label Data Poisoning",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nA backdoored deep hashing model is expected to behave normally on original query images and return the images with the target label when a specific trigger pattern presents.\nTo this end, we propose the confusing perturbations-induced backdoor attack (CIBA). It injects a small number of poisoned images with the correct label into the training data, which makes the attack hard to be detected.\nTo craft the poisoned images, we first propose the confusing perturbations to disturb the hashing code learning. As such, the hashing model can learn more about the trigger. The confusing perturbations are imperceptible and generated by\noptimizing the intra-class dispersion and inter-class shift in the Hamming space.\nWe then employ the targeted adversarial patch as the backdoor trigger to improve the attack performance.\nWe have conducted extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed CIBA.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/KuofengGao/CIBA.",
