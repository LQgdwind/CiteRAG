  "title": "Fair Machine Learning Under Partial Compliance",
  "abstract": "Abstract.\nTypically, fair machine learning research\nfocuses on a single decision maker\nand assumes that the underlying population is stationary.\nHowever, many of the critical domains motivating this work\nare characterized by competitive marketplaces\nwith many decision makers.\nRealistically, we might expect only a subset of them\nto adopt any non-compulsory fairness-conscious policy,\na situation that political philosophers\ncall partial compliance.\nThis possibility raises important questions:\nhow does partial compliance and the consequent\nstrategic behavior of decision subjects\naffect the allocation outcomes?\nIf kùëòk% of employers were to\nvoluntarily adopt a fairness-promoting intervention,\nshould we expect kùëòk% progress (in aggregate)\ntowards the benefits of universal adoption,\nor will the dynamics of partial compliance\nwash out the hoped-for benefits?\nHow might adopting a global (versus local) perspective\nimpact the conclusions of an auditor?\nIn this paper, we propose\na simple model of an employment market,\nleveraging simulation as a tool\nto explore the impact of both interaction effects\nand incentive effects on outcomes and auditing metrics.\nOur key findings are that at equilibrium:\n(1) partial compliance by k%percentùëòk\\% of employers\ncan result in far less than proportional (k%percentùëòk\\%) progress\ntowards the full compliance outcomes;\n(2) the gap is more severe when fair employers\nmatch global (vs local) statistics;\n(3) choices of local vs global statistics\ncan paint dramatically different pictures\nof the performance vis-a-vis fairness desiderata\nof compliant versus non-compliant employers;\nand (4) partial compliance\nbased on local parity measures\ncan induce extreme segregation.\nFinally, we discuss implications for auditors\nand insights concerning the design\nof regulatory frameworks.",
