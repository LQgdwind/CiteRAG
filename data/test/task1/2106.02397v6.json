  "title": "On Classifying Continuous Constraint Satisfaction Problems",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nA continuous constraint satisfaction problem (CCSP) is a\nconstraint satisfaction problem (CSP)\nwith the real numbers as domain.\nWe engage in a systematic study to classify CCSPs that are complete for the\nExistential Theory of the Reals, i.e., ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R}-complete.\nTo define this class, we first consider the problem ETR, which also\nstands for Existential Theory of the Reals.\nIn an instance of this problem we are given a sentence of the form\n∃x1,…,xn∈ℝ:Φ​(x1,…,xn):subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛ℝΦsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\exists x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\in\\mathbb{R}:\\Phi(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}),\nwhere ΦΦ\\Phi is a well-formed quantifier-free formula consisting of the symbols {0,1,x1,…,xn,+,⋅,≥,>,∧,∨,¬}01subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛⋅\\{0,1,x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n},+,\\cdot,\\geq,>,\\wedge,\\vee,\\neg\\}.\nThe goal is to check whether this sentence is true.\nNow the class ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R} is the family of all problems that admit a polynomial-time many-one reduction to ETR.\nIt is known that NP⊆∃ℝ⊆PSPACENPℝPSPACE\\textrm{NP}\\subseteq\\exists\\mathbb{R}\\subseteq\\textrm{PSPACE}.\nWe restrict our attention on CCSPs with addition constraints (x+y=z𝑥𝑦𝑧x+y=z)\nand which satisfy another mild technical condition.\nPreviously, it was shown that multiplication constraints (x⋅y=z⋅𝑥𝑦𝑧x\\cdot y=z), squaring constraints (x2=ysuperscript𝑥2𝑦x^{2}=y),\nor inversion constraints (x⋅y=1⋅𝑥𝑦1x\\cdot y=1) are sufficient to establish ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R}-completeness.\nWe extend this in the strongest possible sense for equality constraints as follows.\nWe show that CCSPs (with addition constraints and that satisfy another mild technical condition) that have any one well-behaved curved equality constraint (f​(x,y)=0𝑓𝑥𝑦0f(x,y)=0) are ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R}-complete.\nWe further extend our results to inequality constraints.\nWe show that together any well-behaved convexly curved and any well-behaved concavely curved inequality constraint\n(f​(x,y)≥0𝑓𝑥𝑦0f(x,y)\\geq 0 and g​(x,y)≥0𝑔𝑥𝑦0g(x,y)\\geq 0)\nimply ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R}-completeness on the class of such CCSPs.\nHere, we call a function f:U→ℝ:𝑓→𝑈ℝf\\colon U\\to\\mathbb{R} well-behaved if it is a C3superscript𝐶3C^{3}-function, f​(0,0)=0𝑓000f(0,0)=0, all its first and second partial derivatives fxsubscript𝑓𝑥f_{x}, fysubscript𝑓𝑦f_{y}, fx​xsubscript𝑓𝑥𝑥f_{xx}, fx​ysubscript𝑓𝑥𝑦f_{xy}, fy​ysubscript𝑓𝑦𝑦f_{yy} are rational in (0,0)00(0,0), fx​(0,0)≠0subscript𝑓𝑥000f_{x}(0,0)\\neq 0 or fy​(0,0)≠0subscript𝑓𝑦000f_{y}(0,0)\\neq 0, and another mild technical constraint.\nFurthermore, we call f𝑓f curved if the curvature of the curve given by f​(x,y)=0𝑓𝑥𝑦0f(x,y)=0 is nonzero at the origin.\nIn this case we call f𝑓f either convexly curved if the curvature is negative, or concavely curved if it is positive.",
