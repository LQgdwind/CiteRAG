  "title": "Generalized Independent Noise Condition for Estimating Causal Structure with Latent Variables",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nWe investigate the challenging task of learning causal structure in the presence of latent variables, including locating latent variables and determining their quantity, and identifying causal relationships among both latent and observed variables. To address this, we propose a Generalized Independent Noise (GIN) condition for linear non-Gaussian acyclic causal models that incorporate latent variables, which establishes the independence between a linear combination of certain measured variables and some other measured variables. Specifically, for two observed random vectors\n𝐘𝐘\\bf{Y} and 𝐙𝐙\\bf{Z}, GIN holds if and only if ω⊺​𝐘superscript𝜔⊺𝐘\\omega^{\\intercal}\\mathbf{Y} and 𝐙𝐙\\mathbf{Z} are statistically independent, where ω𝜔\\omega is a non-zero parameter vector determined by the cross-covariance between 𝐘𝐘\\mathbf{Y} and 𝐙𝐙\\mathbf{Z}. We then give necessary and sufficient graphical criteria of the GIN condition in linear non-Gaussian acyclic causal models. From a graphical perspective, roughly speaking,\nGIN implies the existence of an exogenous set 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} relative to the parent set of 𝐘𝐘\\mathbf{Y} (w.r.t. the causal ordering), such that 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} d-separates 𝐘𝐘\\mathbf{Y} from 𝐙𝐙\\mathbf{Z}.\nInterestingly, we find that the independent noise condition (i.e., if there is no confounder, causes are independent of the residual derived from regressing the effect on the causes) can be seen as a special case of GIN. With such a connection between GIN and latent causal structures, we further leverage the proposed GIN condition, together with a well-designed search procedure, to efficiently estimate Linear, Non-Gaussian Latent Hierarchical Models (LiNGLaHs), where latent confounders may also be causally related and may even follow a hierarchical structure.\nWe show that the underlying causal structure of a LiNGLaH is identifiable in light of GIN conditions under mild assumptions.\nExperimental results on both synthetic and three real-world data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",
