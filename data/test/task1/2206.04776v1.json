  "title": "What Should AI See? Using the Public‚Äôs Opinion to Determine the Perception of an AI",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nDeep neural networks (DNN) have made impressive progress in the interpretation of image data, so that it is conceivable and to some degree realistic to use them in safety critical applications like automated driving.\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the AI algorithm should take into account the vulnerability of objects or subjects on the street that ranges from ‚Äúnot at all‚Äù, e.g.¬†the road itself, to ‚Äúhigh vulnerability‚Äù of pedestrians. One way to take this into account is to define the cost of confusion of one semantic category with another and use cost-based decision rules for the interpretation of probabilities, which are the output of DNNs.\nHowever, it is an open problem how to define the cost structure, who should be in charge to do that, and thereby define what AI-algorithms will actually ‚Äúsee‚Äù.\nAs one possible answer, we follow a participatory approach and set up an online survey to ask the public to define the cost structure. We present the survey design and the data acquired along with an evaluation that also distinguishes between perspective (car passenger vs.¬†external traffic participant) and gender. Using simulation based FùêπF-tests, we find highly significant differences between the groups. These differences have consequences on the reliable detection of pedestrians in a safety critical distance to the self-driving car. We discuss the ethical problems that are related to this approach and also discuss the problems emerging from human‚Äìmachine interaction through the survey from a psychological point of view. Finally, we include comments from industry leaders in the field of AI safety on the applicability of survey based elements in the design of AI functionalities in automated driving.",
