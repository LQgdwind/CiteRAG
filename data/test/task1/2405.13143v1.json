  "abstract": "Abstract\nWe prove several new results about bounded uniform and small-bias distributions. A main message is that, small-bias, even perturbed with noise, does not fool several classes of tests better than bounded uniformity. We prove this for threshold tests, small-space algorithms, and small-depth circuits. In particular, we obtain small-bias distributions that\n\n\n‚Ä¢\n\nachieve an optimal lower bound on their statistical distance to any bounded-uniform distribution. This closes a line of research initiated by Alon, Goldreich, and Mansour in 2003, and improves on a result by O‚ÄôDonnell and Zhao.\n\n\n\n‚Ä¢\n\nhave heavier tail mass than the uniform distribution. This answers a question posed by several researchers including Bun and Steinke.\n\n\n\n‚Ä¢\n\nrule out a popular paradigm for constructing pseudorandom generators, originating in a 1989 work by Ajtai and Wigderson. This again answers a question raised by several researchers. For branching programs, our result matches a bound by Forbes and Kelley.\n\n\n\nOur small-bias distributions above are symmetric. We show that the xor of any two symmetric small-bias distributions fools any bounded function. Hence our examples cannot be extended to the xor of two small-bias distributions, another popular paradigm whose power remains unknown.\nWe also generalize and simplify the proof of a result of Bazzi.",
