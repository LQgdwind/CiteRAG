  "title": "Coherence in Property Testing: Quantum-Classical Collapses and Separations",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nUnderstanding the power and limitations of classical and quantum information, and how\nthey differ, is an important endeavor.\nOn the classical side, property testing of distributions is a fundamental task:\na tester, given samples of a distribution over a typically large domain such as\n{0,1}nsuperscript01𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{n}, is asked to verify properties of the distribution.\nA key property of interest in this paper is the support size both of distributions,\na central problem classically [Valiant and Valiant STOC’11], as well, as of quantum states.\nClassically, even given 2n/16superscript2𝑛162^{n/16} samples, no tester can distinguish between\ndistributions of support size 2n/8superscript2𝑛82^{n/8} from 2n/4superscript2𝑛42^{n/4} with probability better than 2−Θ​(n)superscript2Θ𝑛2^{-\\Theta(n)}, even\nwith the promise that they are flat distributions.\nIn the quantum setting, quantum states can be in a coherent superposition of many states of\n{0,1}nsuperscript01𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{n}, providing a global description of probability distributions.\nOne may ask if coherence can enhance property testing. A natural way to encode a flat\ndistribution is via the subset states, |ϕS⟩=1/|S|∑i∈S|i⟩\\lvert\\phi_{S}\\rangle=1/\\sqrt{\\lvert S\\rvert}\\sum_{i\\in S}\\lvert i\\rangle.\nWe show that coherence alone is not enough to improve the testability of support size.\n\n\n1.\n\nCoherence limitations. Given 2n/16superscript2𝑛162^{n/16} copies, no tester can distinguish between subset states of size 2n/8superscript2𝑛82^{n/8}\nfrom 2n/4superscript2𝑛42^{n/4} with probability better than 2−Θ​(n)superscript2Θ𝑛2^{-\\Theta(n)}.\n\n\n\nOur result is more general and establishes the indistinguishability between the subset states and the Haar random states\nleading to new constructions of pseudorandom and pseudoentangled states, resolving an open problem of [Ji, Liu and Song, CRYPTO’18].\nThe hardness persists even when allowing multiple public-coin AM provers for a classical tester.\n\n\n2.\n\nClassical hardness with provers. Given 2O​(n)superscript2𝑂𝑛2^{O(n)} samples from a classical distribution and 2O​(n)superscript2𝑂𝑛2^{O(n)} communication with multiple independent AM provers,\nno classical tester can estimate the support size up to factors 2Ω​(n)superscript2Ω𝑛2^{\\Omega(n)} with probability better than 2−Θ​(n)superscript2Θ𝑛2^{-\\Theta(n)}. Our hardness result is tight.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, coherent subset state proofs suffice to improve testability exponentially,\n\n\n3.\n\nQuantum advantage with certificates. With polynomially many copies and subset state proofs, a tester can\napproximate the support size of a subset state of arbitrary size.\n\n\n\nSome structural assumption on the quantum proofs is required since we show that\n\n\n4.\n\nCollapse of QMA. A general proof cannot\nimprove testability of any quantum property whatsoever.\n\n\n\nOur results highlight both the power and limitations of coherence in\nproperty testing, establishing exponential quantum-classical separations across various parameters. We also show several connections\nand implications of the study of property testing, in particular, in establishing quantum-to-quantum state transformation lower bounds,\nand to disentangler lower bounds.",
