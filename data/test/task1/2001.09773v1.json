  "title": "Algorithmic Fairness from a Non-ideal Perspective",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nInspired by recent breakthroughs in predictive modeling,\npractitioners in both industry and government\nhave turned to machine learning with hopes\nof operationalizing\npredictions to drive automated decisions.\nUnfortunately, many social desiderata concerning\nconsequential decisions, such as justice or fairness,\nhave no natural formulation within a purely predictive framework.\nIn efforts to mitigate these problems,\nresearchers have proposed a variety of metrics\nfor quantifying deviations from various statistical parities\nthat we might expect to observe in a fair world\nand offered a variety of algorithms\nin attempts to satisfy subsets of these parities or\nto trade off the degree to which they are satisfied against utility.\nIn this paper, we connect this approach to fair machine learning\nto the literature on ideal and non-ideal\nmethodological approaches in political philosophy.\nThe ideal approach requires positing the principles\naccording to which a just world would operate.\nIn the most straightforward application of ideal theory,\none supports a proposed policy by arguing that\nit closes a discrepancy between the real and the perfectly just world.\nHowever, by failing to account for the mechanisms\nby which our non-ideal world arose,\nthe responsibilities of various decision-makers,\nand the impacts of proposed policies,\nnaive applications of ideal thinking\ncan lead to misguided interventions.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate a connection\nbetween the fair machine learning literature\nand the ideal approach in political philosophy,\nand argue that the increasingly apparent shortcomings\nof proposed fair machine learning algorithms\nreflect broader troubles faced by the ideal approach.\nWe conclude with a critical discussion\nof the harms of misguided solutions, a reinterpretation of impossibility results, and directions for future research.111A version of this paper was accepted at the AAAI/ACM Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Ethics, and Society (AIES) 2020.",
