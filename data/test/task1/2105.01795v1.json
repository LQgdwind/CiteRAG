  "title": "NeuroXplorer 1.0: A Fast and Extensible Framework for Spiking Neural Network Simulation and Hardware Mapping",
  "abstract": "Abstract.\nRecently, both industry and academia have proposed many different neuromorphic architectures to execute applications that are designed with Spiking Neural Network (SNN).\nConsequently, there is a growing need for an extensible\nsimulation framework\nthat can perform architectural explorations with SNNs, including both platform-based design of today’s hardware, and hardware-software co-design and design-technology co-optimization of the future. We present NeuroXplorer, a fast and extensible framework that is based on a generalized template for modeling a neuromorphic architecture that can be infused with the specific details of a given hardware and/or technology. NeuroXplorer can perform both low-level cycle-accurate architectural simulations and high-level analysis with data-flow abstractions. NeuroXplorer’s optimization engine can incorporate hardware-oriented metrics such as energy, throughput, and latency, as well as SNN-oriented metrics such as inter-spike interval distortion and spike disorder, which directly impact SNN performance.\nWe demonstrate the architectural exploration capabilities of NeuroXplorer through case studies with many state-of-the-art machine learning models.",
