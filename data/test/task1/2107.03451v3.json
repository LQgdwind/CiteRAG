  "title": "Anticipating Safety Issues in E2E Conversational AI: Framework and Tooling",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nWarning: this paper contains example data that may\nbe offensive or upsetting.\n\nOver the last several years, end-to-end neural conversational agents have vastly improved in their ability to carry a chit-chat conversation with humans. However, these models are often trained on large datasets from the internet, and as a result,\nmay learn undesirable behaviors from this data, such as toxic or otherwise harmful language.\nResearchers must thus wrestle with the issue of how and when to release these models. In this paper, we survey the problem landscape for safety for end-to-end conversational AI and discuss recent and related work. We highlight tensions between values, potential positive impact and potential harms, and provide a framework for making decisions about whether and how to release these models, following the tenets of value-sensitive design. We additionally provide a suite of tools to enable researchers to make\nbetter-informed decisions about training and releasing end-to-end conversational AI models.",
