  "abstract": "Abstract\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are a powerful technology that augment human skill to create new opportunities, akin to the development of steam engines and the internet.\nHowever, LLMs come with a high cost.\nThey require significant computing resources and energy to train and serve. Inequity in their control and access has led to concentration of ownership and power to a small collection of corporations.\nIn our study, we collect training and inference requirements for various LLMs.\nWe then analyze the economic strengths of nations and organizations in the context of developing and serving these models.\nAdditionally, we also look at whether individuals around the world can access and use this emerging technology.\nWe compare and contrast these groups to show that these technologies are monopolized by a surprisingly few entities.\nWe conclude with a qualitative study on the ethical implications of our findings and discuss future directions towards equity in LLM access.",
