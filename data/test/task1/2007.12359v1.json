  "title": "Home, SafeHome: Smart Home Reliability with Visibility and Atomicity",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nSmart environments (homes, factories, hospitals, buildings) contain an increasing number of IoT devices, making them complex to manage. Today, in smart homes where users or triggers initiate routines (i.e., a sequence of commands), concurrent routines and device failures can cause incongruent outcomes. We describe SafeHome, a system that provides notions of atomicity and serial equivalence for smart homes. Due to the human-facing nature of smart homes, SafeHome offers a spectrum of visibility models which trade off between responsiveness vs. incongruence of the smart home state. We implemented SafeHome and performed workload-driven experiments. We find that a weak visibility model, called eventual visibility, is almost as fast as today‚Äôs status quo (up to 23% slower) and yet guarantees serially-equivalent end states.",
