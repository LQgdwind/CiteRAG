  "title": "A Generalized Projected Bellman Error for Off-policy Value Estimation in Reinforcement Learning",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nMany reinforcement learning algorithms rely on value estimation, however, the most widely used algorithms—namely temporal difference algorithms—can diverge under both off-policy sampling and nonlinear function approximation.\nMany algorithms have been developed for off-policy value estimation based on the linear mean squared projected Bellman error (PBE¯¯PBE\\overline{\\text{PBE}}) and are sound under linear function approximation.\nExtending these methods to the nonlinear case has been largely unsuccessful.\nRecently, several methods have been introduced that approximate a different objective—the mean-squared Bellman error (BE¯¯BE\\overline{\\text{BE}})—which naturally facilitate nonlinear approximation.\nIn this work, we build on these insights and introduce a new generalized PBE¯¯PBE\\overline{\\text{PBE}} that extends the linear PBE¯¯PBE\\overline{\\text{PBE}} to the nonlinear setting.\nWe show how this generalized objective unifies previous work and obtain new bounds for the value error of the solutions of the generalized objective.\nWe derive an easy-to-use, but sound, algorithm to minimize the generalized objective, and show that it is more stable across runs, is less sensitive to hyperparameters, and performs favorably across four control domains with neural network function approximation.",
