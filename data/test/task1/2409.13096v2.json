  "abstract": "Abstract\nWe connect the problem of properly PAC learning decision trees to the parameterized Nearest Codeword Problem (kùëòk-NCP). Despite significant effort by the respective communities, algorithmic progress on both problems has been stuck: the fastest known algorithm for the former runs in quasipolynomial time (Ehrenfeucht and Haussler 1989) and the best known approximation ratio for the latter is O‚Äã(n/log‚Å°n)ùëÇùëõùëõO(n/\\log n) (Berman and Karpinsky 2002; Alon, Panigrahy, and Yekhanin 2009). Research on both problems has thus far proceeded independently with no known connections.\nWe show that any improvement of Ehrenfeucht and Haussler‚Äôs algorithm will yield O‚Äã(log‚Å°n)ùëÇùëõO(\\log n)-approximation algorithms for kùëòk-NCP, an exponential improvement of the current state of the art. This can be interpreted either as a new avenue for designing algorithms for kùëòk-NCP, or as one for establishing the optimality of Ehrenfeucht and Haussler‚Äôs algorithm. Furthermore, our reduction along with existing inapproximability results for kùëòk-NCP already rule out polynomial-time algorithms for properly learning decision trees. A notable aspect of our hardness results is that they hold even in the setting of weak learning whereas prior ones were limited to the setting of strong learning.",
