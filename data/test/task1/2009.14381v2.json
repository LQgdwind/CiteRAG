  "title": "AutoDSE: Enabling Software Programmers to Design Efficient FPGA Accelerators",
  "abstract": "Abstract.\nAdopting FPGA as an accelerator in datacenters is becoming mainstream for customized computing, but the fact that FPGAs are hard to program creates a steep learning curve for software programmers. Even with the help of high-level synthesis (HLS), accelerator designers still have to manually perform code reconstruction and cumbersome parameter tuning to achieve the optimal performance. While many learning models have been leveraged by existing work to automate the design of efficient accelerators, the unpredictability of modern HLS tools becomes a major obstacle for them to maintain high accuracy. To address this problem, we propose an automated DSE framework—A​u​t​o​D​S​E𝐴𝑢𝑡𝑜𝐷𝑆𝐸AutoDSE— that leverages a bottleneck-guided coordinate optimizer to systematically find a better design point. A​u​t​o​D​S​E𝐴𝑢𝑡𝑜𝐷𝑆𝐸AutoDSE detects the bottleneck of the design in each step and focuses on high-impact parameters to overcome it.\nThe experimental results show that A​u​t​o​D​S​E𝐴𝑢𝑡𝑜𝐷𝑆𝐸AutoDSE is able to identify the design point that achieves, on the geometric mean, 19.9×\\times speedup over one CPU core for Machsuite and Rodinia benchmarks. Compared to the manually optimized HLS vision kernels in Xilinx Vitis libraries, A​u​t​o​D​S​E𝐴𝑢𝑡𝑜𝐷𝑆𝐸AutoDSE can reduce their optimization pragmas by 26.38×\\times while achieving similar performance. With less than one optimization pragma per design on average, we are making progress towards democratizing customizable computing by enabling software programmers to design efficient FPGA accelerators.",
