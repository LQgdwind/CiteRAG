  "title": "A review of Deep Learning Methods for Photoplethysmography Data",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground and objectives: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a highly promising device due to its advantages in portability, user-friendly operation, and non-invasive capabilities to measure a wide range of physiological information, such as heart rate and blood oxygen saturation. Recent advancements in deep learning have demonstrated remarkable outcomes by leveraging PPG signals collected from a variety of PPG devices for tasks related to personal health management and other multifaceted applications.\nMethods: We systematically reviewed papers that applied deep learning models to process PPG data between January 1st of 2017 and July 31st of 2023 from Google Scholar, PubMed and Dimensions. Each paper is analyzed from three key perspectives: tasks, models, and data.\nResults: We finally extracted a total of 193 papers where different deep learning frameworks were used to process PPG signals. Based on the tasks addressed in these papers, we categorized them into two major groups: medical-related, and non-medical-related. The medical-related tasks were further divided into seven subgroups, including blood pressure analysis, cardiovascular monitoring and diagnosis, sleep health, mental health, respiratory monitoring and analysis, blood glucose analysis, as well as others. The non-medical-related tasks were divided into four subgroups, which encompass signal processing, biometric identification, electrocardiogram reconstruction, and human activity recognition.\nConclusions: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of using deep learning methods to process PPG data. This allows for a more thorough exploration and utilization of the information contained in PPG signals. Compared to traditional machine learning approaches that rely on manual features, deep learning methods offer higher accuracy and a more convenient model building process. However, challenges remain, such as limited quantity and quality of publicly available databases, a lack of effective validation in real-world scenarios, and concerns about the interpretability, scalability, and complexity of deep learning models. Moreover, there are still emerging research areas that require further investigation.",
