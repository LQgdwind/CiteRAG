  "title": "TroLLoc: Logic Locking and Layout Hardening for IC Security Closure against Hardware Trojans",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nDue to cost benefits, supply chains of integrated circuits (ICs) are largely outsourced nowadays.\nHowever, passing ICs through various third-party providers gives rise to many security threats, like piracy of IC intellectual\nproperty or insertion of hardware Trojans, i.e., malicious circuit modifications.\nIn this work, we proactively and systematically protect the physical layouts\nof ICs\nagainst post-design insertion of\nTrojans.\nToward that end, we propose TroLLoc, a novel scheme for IC security closure that employs, for the first time, logic locking and layout hardening in unison.\nTroLLoc is fully integrated into a commercial-grade design flow, and\nTroLLoc is shown to be effective, efficient, and robust.\nOur work provides in-depth layout and security analysis considering the challenging benchmarks of the ISPD’22/23 contests for security closure.\nWe show that TroLLoc successfully renders layouts resilient, with reasonable overheads, against\n(i) general prospects for Trojan insertion as in the ISPD’22 contest,\n(ii) actual Trojan insertion as in the ISPD’23 contest, and\n(iii) potential second-order attacks where\nadversaries would first (i.e., before Trojan insertion) try to bypass the locking defense, e.g.,\nusing advanced machine learning attacks.\nFinally, we release all our artifacts for independent verification [2].",
