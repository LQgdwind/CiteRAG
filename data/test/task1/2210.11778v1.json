  "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we consider a transformation of k𝑘k disjoint paths in a graph. For a graph and a pair of k𝑘k disjoint paths 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} and 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} connecting the same set of terminal pairs, we aim to determine whether 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} can be transformed to 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} by repeatedly replacing one path with another path so that the intermediates are also k𝑘k disjoint paths. The problem is called Disjoint Paths Reconfiguration. We first show that Disjoint Paths Reconfiguration is 𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤\\mathsf{PSPACE}-complete even when k=2𝑘2k=2. On the other hand, we prove that, when the graph is embedded on a plane and all paths in 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} and 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} connect the boundaries of two faces, Disjoint Paths Reconfiguration can be solved in polynomial time. The algorithm is based on a topological characterization for rerouting curves on a plane using the algebraic intersection number. We also consider a transformation of disjoint s𝑠s-t𝑡t paths as a variant. We show that the disjoint s𝑠s-t𝑡t paths reconfiguration problem in planar graphs can be determined in polynomial time, while the problem is 𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤\\mathsf{PSPACE}-complete in general.",
