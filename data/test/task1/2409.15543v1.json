  "title": "Investigations of effect of temperature and strain dependent material properties on thermoelastic damping - A generalized 3-D finite element formulation",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nA comprehensive 3-D finite element formulation for the coupled thermoelastic system is proposed based on the Total Lagrangian framework to study the thermoelastic damping (TED) in small scale structures. The proposed formulation takes into account geometric nonlinearity because of large deformation and material nonlinearity where material parameters are functions of temperature and strain field. Using the proposed finite element formulation, the TED quality factor is obtained for 1-D rod undergoing longitudinal vibrations using the eigenvalue analysis. We first validate the accuracy of the finite element implementation with previously known theoretical and numerical results. Subsequently we demonstrate the utility of the proposed numerical framework to study the effect of geometric nonlinearity, temperature and strain dependent material nonlinearity on the thermoelastic damping.In addition, the effect of internal/ external heating and different thermal boundary conditions on TED is discussed",
