  "title": "SquirrelFS: using the Rust compiler to check file-system crash consistency",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nThis work introduces a new approach to building crash-safe file systems for persistent memory.\nWe exploit the fact that Rust’s typestate pattern allows compile-time enforcement of a specific order of operations.\nWe introduce a novel crash-consistency mechanism, Synchronous Soft Updates, that boils down crash safety to enforcing ordering among updates to file-system metadata.\nWe employ this approach to build SquirrelFS, a new file system with crash-consistency guarantees that are checked at compile time.\nSquirrelFS avoids the need for separate proofs, instead incorporating correctness guarantees into the typestate itself.\nCompiling SquirrelFS only takes tens of seconds; successful compilation indicates crash consistency,\nwhile an error provides a starting point for fixing the bug.\nWe evaluate SquirrelFS against state of the art file systems such as NOVA and WineFS, and find that SquirrelFS achieves similar or better performance on a wide range of benchmarks and applications.",
