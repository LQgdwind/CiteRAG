  "abstract": "Abstract\nOne of the first and easy to use techniques for proving run time bounds for evolutionary algorithms is the so-called method of fitness levels by Wegener. It uses a partition of the search space into a sequence of levels which are traversed by the algorithm in increasing order, possibly skipping levels. An easy, but often strong upper bound for the run time can then be derived by adding the reciprocals of the probabilities to leave the levels (or upper bounds for these). Unfortunately, a similarly effective method for proving lower bounds has not yet been established. The strongest such method, proposed by Sudholt (2013), requires a careful choice of the viscosity parameters γi,jsubscript𝛾𝑖𝑗\\gamma_{i,j}, 0≤i<j≤n0𝑖𝑗𝑛0\\leq i<j\\leq n.\nIn this paper we present two new variants of the method, one for upper and one for lower bounds. Besides the level leaving probabilities, they only rely on the probabilities that levels are visited at all. We show that these can be computed or estimated without greater difficulties and apply our method to reprove the following known results in an easy and natural way. (i) The precise run time of the (1+1) EA on LeadingOnes. (ii) A lower bound for the run time of the (1+1) EA on OneMax, tight apart from an O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) term. (iii) A lower bound for the run time of the (1+1) EA on long k𝑘k-paths. We also prove a tighter lower bound for the run time of the (1+1) EA on jump functions by showing that, regardless of the jump size, only with probability O​(2−n)𝑂superscript2𝑛O(2^{-n}) the algorithm can avoid to jump over the valley of low fitness.",
