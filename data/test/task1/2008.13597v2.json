  "title": "Classifier Combination Approach for Question Classification for Bengali Question Answering System",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nQuestion classification (QC) is a prime constituent of automated question answering system.\nThe work presented here demonstrates that the combination of multiple models achieve better classification performance than those obtained with existing individual models for the question classification task in Bengali.\nWe have exploited state-of-the-art multiple model combination techniques, i.e., ensemble, stacking and voting, to increase QC accuracy.\nLexical, syntactic and semantic features of Bengali questions are used for four well-known classifiers, namely Naïve Bayes, kernel Naïve Bayes, Rule Induction, and Decision Tree, which serve as our base learners.\nSingle-layer question-class taxonomy with 8 coarse-grained classes is extended to two-layer taxonomy by adding 69 fine-grained classes.\nWe carried out the experiments both on single-layer and two-layer taxonomies.\nExperimental results confirmed that classifier combination approaches outperform single classifier classification approaches by 4.02% for coarse-grained question classes.\nOverall, the stacking approach produces the best results for fine-grained classification and achieves 87.79% of accuracy.\nThe approach presented here could be used in other Indo-Aryan or Indic languages to develop a question answering system.",
