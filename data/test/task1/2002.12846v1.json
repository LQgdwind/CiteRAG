  "title": "Exact artificial boundary conditions of 1D semi-discretized peridynamics",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nThe peridynamic theory reformulates the equations of continuum mechanics in terms of integro-differential\nequations instead of partial differential equations. It is not trivial to directly apply naive approach in artificial boundary conditions for continua to peridynamics modeling, because it usually involves semi-discretization scheme. In this paper, we present a new way to construct exact boundary conditions for semi-discretized peridynamics using kernel functions and recursive relations. Specially, kernel functions are used to characterize one single source are combined to construct the exact boundary conditions. The recursive relationships between the kernel functions are proposed, therefore the kernel functions can be computed through the ordinary differential system and integral system with high precision. The numerical results demonstrate that the boundary condition has high accuracy. The proposed method can be applied to modeling of wave\npropagation of other nonlocal theories and high dimensional cases.",
