  "title": "Speech representation learning: Learning bidirectional encoders with single-view, multi-view, and multi-task methods",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nRepresentation learning refers to the problem of transforming high-dimensional and possibly noisy raw inputs to compact and informative representations of the data. Unlike traditional hand-engineered features, representation learning can automatically capture the underlying structure and patterns hidden in the surface features, which can be useful for improving performance on downstream tasks and improving generalization.\nThis thesis focuses on representation learning for sequence data over time or space, aiming to improve downstream sequence prediction tasks by using the learned representations. This problem is challenging because the sequences can be very diverse. For example, if the series is a continuous signal like a speech recording, sources of variation include (but are not limited to) linguistic material, different speakers, and distinct recording environments. Supervised learning has been the most dominant approach for training deep neural networks for learning good sequential representations. However, one limiting factor to scale supervised learning is the lack of enough annotated data.\nMotivated by this challenge, it is natural to explore representation learning methods that can utilize large amounts of unlabeled and weakly labeled data, as well as an additional data modality. I describe my broad study of representation learning for speech data. Unlike most other works that focus on a single learning setting, this thesis studies multiple settings: supervised learning with auxiliary losses, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and multi-view learning. Besides different learning problems, I also explore multiple approaches for representation learning. In this thesis, I focus on speech data, but the methods can also be applied to other domains.\nIn Chapter 3, I systematically study autoencoders for acoustic representation learning, and I show that speech recognition can benefit from the representations learned by a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a feedforward encoder when the VAE is trained using a much larger unlabeled dataset. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first work to experimentally show that VAEs learn representations that significantly improve speech recognition and outperform autoencoding approaches that do not use variational inference. I also explore in depth what makes VAEs powerful for representation learning. I find that their KL divergence term provides regularization effects which may play a critical role in representation learning.\nIn Chapter 4, I contribute new techniques for variational representation learning models in a multi-view learning setting. Specifically, I extend variational canonical correlation analysis (VCCA), an unsupervised multi-view representation learning method, with more informative sample-specific priors. My proposed extension of VCCA learns representations that improve speech recognition performance, when we have access to multi-view training data consisting of audio paired with articulatory measurements. I also explore two specific problems in multi-view learning — cross-domain multi-view learning and label embedding. I investigate learning an acoustic encoder using an additional modality (view) when we don’t have access to paired in-domain multi-view data. I explore multiple transfer learning techniques and optimization techniques to exploit the learned acoustic-articulatory mapping in the dataset where acoustic-articulatory pairs are accessible. I show that such acoustic-articulatory mapping information can improve speech recognition, especially with small training datasets. For label embedding, I directly treat the label as a second view and use the structural information hidden in the label to assist the representation learning.\nIn Chapter 5, I study multitask recurrent representation learning, combining supervised and unsupervised losses, and present several technical improvements to variational sequential models. Unlike other variational sequential models developed prior to my work that focus on generation tasks and typically use unidirectional recurrent layers as their encoders, I propose to use variational bidirectional recurrent layers as an encoder to learn better-performing representations for downstream tasks. I also propose to factor the representation into a discriminative component and a reconstruction-specific component. I also propose to update the priors dynamically, discuss the resulting benefits and limitations in depth, and propose potential extensions. My experimental results show that the proposed multitask representation learning framework works well for speech recognition, and also text tasks like entity recognition and text chunking.\nIn Chapter 6 I focus on unsupervised sequential representation learning. I compare multiple unsupervised learning approaches, including autoencoding, contrastive learning, and masked reconstruction. I also contribute a new approach, multi-view masked reconstruction. My experimental study shows that making representations invariant to different domains and robust to distortions can improve speech recognition performance and generalization to unseen data.\nOverall, the field of representation learning is developing rapidly. State-of-the-art results on speech related tasks are typically based on Transformers pre-trained with large-scale self-supervised learning, which aims to learn generic representations that can benefit multiple downstream tasks. Since 2020, large-scale pre-training has been the de facto choice to achieve good performance. This delayed thesis does not attempt to summarize and compare with the latest results on speech representation learning; Instead, it presents a unique study on speech representation learning before the Transformer era, that covers multiple learning settings. I believe some of the findings in this thesis can still be useful today, and in Chapter 7 I conclude those findings and discuss potential future work.",
