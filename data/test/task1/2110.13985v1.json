  "title": "Combining Recurrent, Convolutional, and Continuous-time Models with Linear State-Space Layers",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs), temporal convolutions, and neural differential equations (NDEs) are popular families of deep learning models for time-series data,\neach with unique strengths and tradeoffs in modeling power and computational efficiency.\nWe introduce a simple sequence model inspired by control systems that generalizes these approaches while addressing their shortcomings.\nThe Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL) maps a sequence u‚Ü¶ymaps-toùë¢ùë¶u\\mapsto y by simply simulating a linear continuous-time state-space representation xÀô=A‚Äãx+B‚Äãu,y=C‚Äãx+D‚Äãuformulae-sequenceÀôùë•ùê¥ùë•ùêµùë¢ùë¶ùê∂ùë•ùê∑ùë¢\\dot{x}=Ax+Bu,y=Cx+Du.\nTheoretically, we show that LSSL models are closely related to the three aforementioned families of models and inherit their strengths.\nFor example, they generalize convolutions to continuous-time, explain common RNN heuristics,\nand share features of NDEs such as time-scale adaptation.\nWe then incorporate and generalize recent theory on continuous-time memorization to introduce a trainable subset of structured matrices Aùê¥A that endow LSSLs with long-range memory.\nEmpirically, stacking LSSL layers into a simple deep neural network obtains state-of-the-art results across time series benchmarks for long dependencies in sequential image classification, real-world healthcare regression tasks, and speech.\nOn a difficult speech classification task with length-16000 sequences, LSSL outperforms prior approaches by 24 accuracy points, and even outperforms\nbaselines that use hand-crafted features on 100x shorter sequences.",
