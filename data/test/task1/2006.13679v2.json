  "title": "Approximation of the Diagonal of a Laplacian’s Pseudoinverse for Complex Network Analysis",
  "abstract": "Abstract\nThe ubiquity of massive graph data sets in numerous applications requires fast algorithms for extracting\nknowledge from these data.\nWe are motivated here by three electrical measures for the analysis of large small-world\ngraphs G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) – i. e., graphs with diameter in 𝒪​(log⁡|V|)𝒪𝑉\\mathcal{O}(\\log|V|),\nwhich are abundant in complex network analysis.\nFrom a computational point of view, the three measures have in common that their crucial component is the\ndiagonal of the graph Laplacian’s pseudoinverse, 𝐋†superscript𝐋†\\mathbf{L}^{\\dagger}.\nComputing diag⁡(𝐋†)diagsuperscript𝐋†\\operatorname{diag}(\\mathbf{L}^{\\dagger}) exactly by pseudoinversion, however, is as expensive as dense matrix multiplication – and the standard tools in practice even require\ncubic time. Moreover, the pseudoinverse requires quadratic space – hardly feasible for large graphs. Resorting to approximation by, e. g., using the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform, requires the solution of 𝒪​(log⁡|V|/ϵ2)𝒪𝑉superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\mathcal{O}(\\log|V|/\\epsilon^{2})\nLaplacian linear systems to guarantee a relative error, which is still very expensive for large inputs.\nIn this paper, we present a novel approximation algorithm\nthat requires the solution of only one Laplacian linear system.\nThe remaining parts are purely combinatorial –\nmainly sampling uniform spanning trees, which we relate to diag⁡(𝐋†)diagsuperscript𝐋†\\operatorname{diag}(\\mathbf{L}^{\\dagger})\nvia effective resistances. For small-world networks, our algorithm\nobtains a ±ϵplus-or-minusitalic-ϵ\\pm\\epsilon-approximation with high probability, in a time that is\nnearly-linear in |E|𝐸|E| and quadratic in 1/ϵ1italic-ϵ1/\\epsilon.\nAnother positive aspect of our algorithm is its parallel nature due to independent sampling.\nWe thus provide two parallel implementations of our algorithm: one using OpenMP, one MPI + OpenMP.\nIn our experiments against the state of the art, our algorithm (i) yields more accurate approximation results\nfor diag⁡(𝐋†)diagsuperscript𝐋†\\operatorname{diag}(\\mathbf{L}^{\\dagger}), (ii) is much faster and more memory-efficient, and (iii) obtains good parallel speedups,\nin particular in the distributed setting.",
