      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting Class Imbalance for End-to-end Semi-Supervised Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe semi-supervised learning (SSL) theory provides a useful illustration of how the vast amount of unlabeled data can be exploited using a small labeled data set . In this work, we revisit the problem of SSL-based object detection (SSOD), in which an object detector is trained with a large amount of unlabeled data and a small amount of labeled bounding boxes. To achieve this, existing SSOD methods typically use two strategies: consistency-based SSOD [ref]24  and pseudo-tagging-based SSOD    [ref]29 [ref]8 . Consistency-based approaches train their detector by minimizing the inconsistency between the predictions of unlabeled data with different perturbations. Their performance is highly dependent on the design of the perturbations and the consistency measurement.\nRecently, pseudo-labeling-based frameworks    [ref]29 [ref]8  have become popular. These methods follow teacher-student scheme in which the teacher network generates pseudo-labels using unlabeled data. Concurrently, the student network is trained at each iteration with the predicted pseudo-labels and few labeled data.\nThe benefit of such learning is that as the network converges during training, the quality of the pseudo-labels increases. However, a high-quality pseudo-label requires both precise classification and localization [ref]29. In this paper, we examine the root cause of the negative impact of low-quality pseudo labels. Low-quality pseudo-labeling can aggravate class imbalance issues, resulting in a high false-negative rate (i.e., failing to identify objects from the less prevalent classes) and a low precision rate (i.e., incorrectly identifying objects from the less common classes). To address this, the existing pseudo-label-based SSOD frameworks    use a hand-crafted threshold to distinguish pseudo-bounding boxes for student training. However, the hard threshold as a hyperparameter must be carefully tuned and dynamically adjusted according to the model capability in different time steps . To carefully discriminate pseudo-bounding boxes, we introduce an adaptive threshold filter mechanism that adjusts the threshold based on background/foreground bounding boxes at each time step. From experimental analysis, we also proved the effectiveness of adaptive threshold mechanism over static hand-crafted threshold. Applying pseudo-labels directly to object detection raises the problem of imprecise bounding box localization [ref]29. Xu et al.  also analyzed this effect and found\nthat bounding boxes with high foreground scores may not provide accurate localization information and therefore not suitable for box regression tasks. To address this issue, we introduce a Jitter-Bagging module to estimate the reliable bounding boxes by measuring the consistency of its regression prediction.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed Jitter-Bagging is also validated in the experimental section.\n Another problem is the low recall rate of pseudo-labels, which impairs model training and causes many candidate boxes to be mistaken for a background category due to poor matching of pseudo-labels [ref]29. To address this issue, weâ€™re introducing two new losses that will help to improve foreground classification accuracy. The first loss is the background similarity loss, which helps the network to match the teacher-generated pseudo-boxes and the predicted boxes. Minimizing this loss ensures that the pseudo-boxes generated by the teacher and predicted by the students become as similar as possible. Another loss function is the foreground-background dissimilarity loss to separate the foreground bounding box from the background boxes. These losses help the proposed network to improve the pseudo-label recall rate, so that it can improve detection performance. In addition, we analyzed impact of the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) update mechanism and found that it faces a lag issue that limits its performance in sudden weight fluctuations. To address this, we employed Double EMA (DEMA) 9, which gives more weight to the latest observations and removes the lag compared to EMA. As per our knowledge, the DEMA is being used in the SSOD weight update mechanism for the first time, and its effectiveness in detail is discussed in the Section 4.5. Our scheme also applies strict supervision to the teacher network and feeds strong and weak augmented data into the teacher network to generate accurate pseudo-labels. Interestingly, the proposed network can accurately detect the foreground bounding boxes even for small and highly complex objects. This can be verified using Figure 1, where some results generated by the proposed network on challenging scenarios are visualized. We perform extensive experiments with benchmark datasets, namely MS-COCO 3 and Pascal VOC  to validate the proposed method. The experimental analysis not only confirms the significant performance gain over SOTA methods, but also shows that the proposed method allows the baseline network to achieve 100% supervised performance with much less (i.e., 20%) annotated images in the MS-COCO dataset as shown in Figure 2. Finally, the key contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows: The existing class imbalance can significantly hinder the efficacy of pseudo-label generators. This issue can be alleviated by incorporating suitable learning mechanisms in end-to-end manner. The high false negative and low precision rates can be improvised by carefully distinguishing the pseudo-bounding boxes. To handle this, we propose an adaptive thresholding mechanism that adjusts the threshold based on background/foreground bounding boxes and helps to filter out optimal bounding boxes. To provide accurate localization information, we introduce a Jitter-Bagging module for the regression task that helps the proposed network to refine optimal bounding boxes. To improve pseudo-label recall rate and detect blurry and distorted small objects as foreground objects, we introduce two new losses: background similarity loss and foreground-background dissimilarity loss.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: detector is trained with a large amount of unlabeled data and a small amount of labeled bounding boxes.
