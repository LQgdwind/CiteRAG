      "content": "Paper Title: MizAR 60 for Mizar 50\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNaive Bayes and k𝑘k-nearest neighbors\nwere the strongest selection\nmethods in the Mizar40 evaluation .\nIn this work, we improve them and apply them together with newer methods. k-NN (𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K}): The k𝑘k-nearest neighbours algorithm, when applied to premise selection,\nchooses k𝑘k facts closest to the conjecture in the feature space and selects their dependencies.\nAlready known modifications of the standard k𝑘k-NN include considering the number of dependencies of facts (proofs with more dependencies\nare longer and thus less important) as well as TF-IDF (rare features are more important) .\nAdditionally, we realize that we do not need to fix the k𝑘k. Instead,\nwe consider a small k𝑘k and if the number of scored dependencies is too low,\nwe increase the k𝑘k and update the dependencies. This is\nrepeated until the requested number of predictions is obtained. The\nk𝑘k-NN-based predictions with fixed k𝑘k will be denoted, e.g., by 𝒦512subscriptsuperscript𝒦512\\mathcal{K}^{\\textrm{}}_{\\textrm{512}}, while\nwith variable k𝑘k this will be 𝒦varfeasubscriptsuperscript𝒦feavar\\mathcal{K}^{\\textrm{fea}}_{\\textrm{var}}, where fea specifies the features used. Naive Bayes (𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N}): The sparse Naive Bayes algorithm estimates the relevance of a fact F𝐹F\nby the conditional probability of F𝐹F being useful (estimated from past proof statistics)\nunder the condition of the features being present in the conjecture (again estimated from\nstatistics). We also consider extended\nfeatures of F𝐹F, i.e., features of F𝐹F and features of facts proved using F𝐹F.\nTogether with premise selection-specific weights this improves on the basic Naive Bayes\nand has already been used in HolyHammer and later Sledgehammer. A complete derivation\nof the algorithm is discussed in .\nThe Naive Bayes predictions will be denoted by 𝒩feasubscript𝒩fea\\mathcal{N}_{\\textrm{fea}}. These algorithms can be parametrized by\nmore complex features. We considered:\ncp for constants and paths (Section 3.2) in the term graph,\nsub for subterms,\nau for anti-unification features ,\neni for online ENIGMA features discussed in Section 3.2\nand uni for the union of all above.\nFinally, these algorithms also support the chronological mode, which in the learning\nphase discards proofs that use facts introduced after the current conjecture in the Mizar\ncanonical order (MML.LAR). This slightly weakens the algorithms, but is compatible\nwith the previous Mizar40 premise selection evaluation . These will be marked by chrono. Dependent Selection with RNNs (ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}):\nPremise selection methods were originally mainly based on ranking the facts independently\nwith respect to the conjecture. The highest ranked facts\nare then used as axioms and given to the ATP systems together with the\nconjecture. Such approaches (used also with GBDTs), although useful and successful, do not take into\naccount\nthat the premises are\nnot independent of each other. Some premises complement each other better when proving a\nparticular conjecture, while some highly-ranked premises might be just minor\nvariants of one another. Recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder-decoder\nmodels [ref]9\nand transformers 1 (language models) turn out to be suitable ML architectures for modeling such implicit dependencies. Such models have been traditionally developed for natural language processing,\nhowever, recently they are also increasingly used in symbolic\nreasoning tasks  2  [ref]38 , including premise selection\n.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: each other better when proving a\nparticular conjecture, while some highly-ranked premises might be just minor\nvariants of one another.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
