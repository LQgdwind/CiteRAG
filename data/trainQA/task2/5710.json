Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: AdPE: Adversarial Positional Embeddings for Pretraining Vision Transformers via MAE+\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile it is natural to extend the contrastive learning approaches that achieve tremendous successes in pretraining the CNNs to pretrain the Vision Transformers (ViTs), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) [ref]3 provides an alternative way inspired by the success in the NLP domain [ref]4. This is expected to unify the transformer pretraining in computer vision, NLP and multmodality domains. The idea is simple â€“ it aims to unsupervisedly train a transformer encoder by masking out some tokens and reconstructing them at the decoder end. Such a pretext task aims to learn a useful transformer backbone as its encoder to learn representations that are useful\nto predict the masked contents. It is demonstrated that by masking out a large portion of input images (e.g., 75% masked out [ref]3), a hard MIM task is formulated that forces the encoder to learn useful clues in the long-range contexts to predict the missing patches. Masked tokens will be added either before  or after [ref]3 the encoder. By only feeding the unmasked tokens through the encoder, the Masked Auto-Encoder (MAE) is able to reduce the computing costs for its encoder during the pretraining [ref]3. However, it still needs to feed the masked tokens through the decoder to predict the missing patches.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: While it is natural to extend the contrastive learning approaches that achieve tremendous successes in pretraining the CNNs to pretrain the Vision Transformers (ViTs), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) [ref]3 provides an alternative way inspired by the success in the NLP domain [ref]4.
