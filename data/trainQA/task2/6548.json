Compared to other measures such as the Kullback-Leibler Divergence  or Maximum Mean Discrepancies , OT enjoys advantageous analytical properties (is a valid metric; compatible with sparse-support distributions; stable with respect to deformations of the distributions’ supports  ).\nGiven probability measures μt,μvsubscript𝜇𝑡subscript𝜇𝑣\\mu_{t},\\mu_{v} over the space 𝒵𝒵\\mathcal{Z}, the OT distance is defined as \nOT​(μt,μv):=minπ∈Π​(μt,μv)​∫𝒵2𝒞​(z,z′)​𝑑π​(z,z′)assignOTsubscript𝜇𝑡subscript𝜇𝑣subscript𝜋Πsubscript𝜇𝑡subscript𝜇𝑣subscriptsuperscript𝒵2𝒞𝑧superscript𝑧′differential-d𝜋𝑧superscript𝑧′\\text{OT}(\\mu_{t},\\mu_{v}):=\\min_{\\pi\\in\\Pi(\\mu_{t},\\mu_{v})}\\int_{\\mathcal{Z}^{2}}\\mathcal{C}(z,z^{\\prime})d\\pi(z,z^{\\prime}),\nwhere Π(μt,μv):={π∈𝒫(𝒵×𝒵)∣∫𝒵π(z,z′)dz=μt,\\Pi(\\mu_{t},\\mu_{v}):=\\left\\{\\pi\\in\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{Z}\\times\\mathcal{Z})\\mid\\int_{\\mathcal{Z}}\\pi(z,z^{\\prime})dz=\\mu_{t},\\right.\n∫𝒵π(z,z′)dz′=μv}\\left.\\int_{\\mathcal{Z}}\\pi(z,z^{\\prime})dz^{\\prime}=\\mu_{v}\\right\\} denotes a collection of couplings between two distributions μtsubscript𝜇𝑡\\mu_{t} and μvsubscript𝜇𝑣\\mu_{v}, 𝒞:𝒵×𝒵→ℝ+:𝒞→𝒵𝒵superscriptℝ\\mathcal{C}:\\mathcal{Z}\\times\\mathcal{Z}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{+} is a symmetric positive-definite cost function (with 𝒞​(z,z)=0𝒞𝑧𝑧0\\mathcal{C}(z,z)=0), respectively. A popular choice of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is given in  by considering z𝑧z as the feature-label pair (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y). The computation of the OT distance usually relies on the Sinkhorn algorithm , which attains almost linear time complexity and memory overhead with the state-of-the-art implementations and applies to large scales with parallel computing  .\nGiven Dt={(xi,yi)}i=1Nsubscript𝐷𝑡superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖𝑖1𝑁D_{t}=\\{(x_{i},y_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N} of size N𝑁N, and Dv={(xi′,yi′)}i=1Tsubscript𝐷𝑣superscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖′superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖′𝑖1𝑇D_{v}=\\{(x_{i}^{\\prime},y_{i}^{\\prime})\\}_{i=1}^{T} of size T𝑇T, one can construct discrete probability measures μt​(x,y):=1N​∑i=1Nδ(xi,yi)assignsubscript𝜇𝑡𝑥𝑦1𝑁superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑁subscript𝛿subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖\\mu_{t}(x,y):=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\delta_{(x_{i},y_{i})} and μv​(x,y):=1T​∑i=1Tδ(xi′,yi′)assignsubscript𝜇𝑣𝑥𝑦1𝑇superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑇subscript𝛿superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖′superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖′\\mu_{v}(x,y):=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{i=1}^{T}\\delta_{(x_{i}^{\\prime},y_{i}^{\\prime})}, where δ𝛿\\delta is the Dirac delta function. With slight abuse of notation, we use OT​(Dt,Dv)OTsubscript𝐷𝑡subscript𝐷𝑣\\text{OT}(D_{t},D_{v}) to denote the OT distance between their corresponding discrete measures OT​(μt​(x,y),μv​(x,y))OTsubscript𝜇𝑡𝑥𝑦subscript𝜇𝑣𝑥𝑦\\text{OT}(\\mu_{t}(x,y),\\mu_{v}(x,y)). Extensive theoretical studies show that the OT distance between two distributions provides an upper bound on the difference of a model’s performance when evaluated on the two distributions [ref]36 [ref]37 [ref]8. Largely built upon Kantorovich-Rubinstein Duality , existing theoretical results require assumptions on the Lipschitz constant of the model with respect to the input space. However, the constant is rarely known in practice, nor can it be bounded tightly for complex models such as deep neural networks. As a result, despite its widespread popularity as a performance proxy [ref]8 [ref]36 , one cannot directly apply the existing theoretical results to directly estimate the model performance based on the OT distance, posing an important gap.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: Extensive theoretical studies show that the OT distance between two distributions provides an upper bound on the difference of a model’s performance when evaluated on the two distributions [ref]36 [ref]37 [ref]8.
