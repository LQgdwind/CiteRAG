      "content": "Paper Title: Dress Code: High-Resolution Multi-Category Virtual Try-On\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBaselines and Competitors.\nIn this set of experiments, we compare with CP-VTON¬†[ref]40, CP-VTON+¬†[ref]28, CIT¬†, VITON-GT¬†[ref]8, WUTON¬†, ACGPN¬†, and PF-AFN¬†, that we re-train from scratch on our dataset using source codes provided by the authors, when available, or our re-implementations. In addition to these methods, we implement an improved version of¬†[ref]40 (i.e.¬†CP-VTON‚Ä†) and of¬† (i.e.¬†CIT‚Ä†) in which we use, as an additional input to the model, the person representation mùëöm. To validate the effectiveness of the Pixel-level Semantic Aware Discriminator (PSAD), we also test a model trained with a patch-based discriminator¬† (Patch), a model trained by removing in our discriminator the NùëÅN semantic channels and only keeping the real/fake one¬† (Binary), and a baseline trained without the adversarial loss (NoDisc). Low-Resolution Results and Ablative Analysis.\nIn this experiment, we compare our complete model (PSAD) with state-of-the-art architectures for virtual try-on and with the Patch, Binary, and NoDisc baselines. For these comparisons, we consider the standard resolution for virtual try-on (256√ó192256192256\\times 192). In Table¬†2, we report numerical results on the Dress Code test set. As it can be seen, our model obtains better results than competitors on all clothing categories in terms of almost all considered evaluation metrics. Quantitative results also confirm the effectiveness of PSAD in comparison with a pixel-level discriminator without semantics and with a standard patch-based discriminator, especially in terms of the realism of the generated images (i.e.¬†FID and KID). PSAD is second to the Patch model only in terms of SSIM, and by a very limited margin. All discriminator-based configurations outperform the NoDisc baseline, thus showing the importance of incorporating a discriminator in a virtual try-on architecture.\nWe also test the effect of using different representations for the body pose (human keypoints and dense pose). When comparing the two versions of our model, we find out that using dense pose helps to deal with full-body clothes (i.e.¬†dresses), but does not bring a consistent improvement over the use of human keypoints in our architecture. For this reason, we keep the latter model version for all the next experiments.\nIn Fig.¬†4, we report a qualitative comparison between the results obtained with our Patch model and the PSAD version.\nIn Fig.¬†5, we compare our results with those obtained by state-of-the-art competitors. Overall, our model with PSAD can better preserve the characteristics of the original clothes such as colors, textures, and shapes, and reduce artifacts and distortions, increasing the realism and visual quality of the generated images. High-Resolution Results.\nFor this experiment, we train and test our models and competitors using higher-resolution images (512√ó384512384512\\times 384 and 1024√ó76810247681024\\times 768). We compare with CP-VTON¬†[ref]40 and its improved version (CP-VTON‚Ä†). Quantitative results for this setting are reported in Table¬†3 and refer to the entire test set of the Dress Code dataset. As it can be seen, our method outperforms the competitors. When generating images with resolution 1024√ó76810247681024\\times 768, PSAD achieves the best results in terms of FID, KID, and IS with respect to the competitors and the Patch baseline. Multi-Garment Try-On Results.\nAs an additional experiment on the Dress Code dataset, we propose a novel setting in which the try-on is performed twice: first with an upper-body garment, and then with a lower-body item. This fully-unpaired setting aims to push further the difficulty of image-based virtual try-on, as it doubles the number of operations required to generate the resulting image. We remind that this experiment would have not been possible on the standard VITON dataset¬†, as it contains only upper-body clothes. In Table¬†4, we report numerical results at varying image resolution.\nWe can observe that PSAD outperforms the competitors and baselines on almost all the metrics for all the different image resolutions, with the only exception of the IS metric. Notably, the improvement of PSAD with respect to the Patch baseline ranges from 2.342.342.34 to 5.005.005.00 and from 0.160.160.16 to 0.460.460.46 in terms of FID and KID respectively. User Study.\nWhile quantitative metrics used in the previous experiments can capture fine-grained variations in the generated images, the overall realism and visual quality of the results can be effectively assessed by human evaluation.\nTo further evaluate the quality of generated images, we conduct a user study measuring both the realism of our results and their coherence with the input try-on garment and reference person. In the first test (Realism test), we show two generated images, one generated by our model and the other by a competitor, and ask to select the more realistic one. In the second test (Coherency test), in addition to the two generated images, we include the images of the try-on garment and the reference person used as input to the try-on network. In this case, we ask the user to select the image that is more coherent with the given inputs. All images are randomly selected from the Dress Code test set. Overall, this study involves a total of 30 participants, including researchers and non-expert people, and we collect more than 3,000 different evaluations (i.e.¬†1,500 for each test). Results are shown in Table¬†5. For each test, we report the percentage of votes obtained by the competitor / by our model. We also include a comparison with the Patch baseline. Our complete model is always selected more than 50% of the time against all considered competitors, thus further demonstrating the effectiveness of our solution.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: Baselines and Competitors.\nIn this set of experiments, we compare with CP-VTON¬†[ref]40, CP-VTON+¬†[ref]28, CIT¬†, VITON-GT¬†[ref]8, WUTON¬†, ACGPN¬†, and PF-AFN¬†, that we re-train from scratch on our dataset using source codes provided by the authors, when available, or our\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
