      "content": "Paper Title: Spot-adaptive Knowledge Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge distillation has attracted widespread attention due to its importance in deploying DNNs to low-capacity edge devices. The main idea is leveraging the dark knowledge in a bulky teacher to craft a compact student model, of which the performance is expected to be on par with the teacher. Over the last several years, most works devote themselves to the exploration of “what to distill”, i.e., forms of knowledge for distillation. Representative forms include soft targets [ref]1, features [ref]6 , attention , factors , activation boundary , sample relationship    and so on. By imitating the teacher to behave in a similar way, the student model achieves comparable performance to the teacher model even with much fewer parameters. In this work, we focus on “where to distill” instead of “what to distill”, which is largely overlooked by existing works. Moreover, as “where to distill” is orthogonal to “what to distill”, the proposed method can be seamlessly integrated into existing distillation methods to further improve their performance. Existing KD methods can be divided into different categories according to different taxonomies. Based on the number of spots where distillation happens, we roughly divide existing KD methods into one-spot [ref]1 [ref]2    and multi-spot [ref]6      distillation. The proposed distiller is a spot-adaptive approach where the number of spots for distillation is automatically determined rather than pre-defined. Based on the similarity between the teacher and the student in architectures, KD can also be categorized into homogeneous distillation  [ref]2 and heterogeneous distillation  [ref]2 , where the heterogeneous distillation is deemed more challenging due to the large architecture difference [ref]2. The proposed method in this work makes few assumptions about the architectures of the teacher and the student, and thus it can be applied to both homogeneous and heterogeneous distillation scenarios. KD has derived a variety of different problem settings except the canonical teacher-student distillation, including mutual distillation  , self-distillation   , knowledge amalgamation   and data-free distillation    . In mutual distillation, an ensemble of student models learn collaboratively and teach each other throughout the training process, enabling the teacher and the student models progress together. Self distillation assumes no teacher network available and distills knowledge within the student network itself by using outputs of deeper layers to supervise shallower layers. Knowledge amalgamation aims to craft a single multi-task student model by fusing the knowledge from multiple teacher models. Data-free distillation relaxes the assumption that the training data of the teacher model is available for training the student, i.e., the knowledge should be distilled to the student without any original training data. In this work, we follow the canonical distillation settings where both the teacher network and the original training data are available for training the student network. However, we believe the general idea can be also applied to various KD settings, which is left for future work.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: the teacher.
