[ref]5 suggest 10 different real-valued symbolic regression problems (functions) and create the corresponding dataset (a.k.a. Nguyen dataset).\nThe suggested functions consist of either 1 or 2 variables e.g., f​(x)=x6+x5+x4+x3+x2+x𝑓𝑥superscript𝑥6superscript𝑥5superscript𝑥4superscript𝑥3superscript𝑥2𝑥f(x)=x^{6}+x^{5}+x^{4}+x^{3}+x^{2}+x and f​(x,y)=sin⁡(x)+sin⁡(y2)𝑓𝑥𝑦𝑥superscript𝑦2f(x,y)=\\sin(x)+\\sin(y^{2}).\nThey generate each dataset by randomly sampling 20 - 100 data points.\nLa Cava et al. 1 design a symbolic regression benchmark, named SRBench, and conduct a comprehensive benchmark experiment, using existing symbolic regression datasets such as FSRD and ODE-Strogatz repository .\nIn SRBench, SR methods are assessed by 1) an error metric based on squared error between target and estimated values, and 2) solution rate that shows a percentage of the estimated symbolic regression models that match the true models based on sympy .\nHowever, these datasets and evaluations are not necessarily designed to discuss the potential of SRSD.\nIn Sections 3.1 and 4.1, we further describe potential issues in prior studies.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: 120 equations.\nThe ODE-Strogatz repository  contains two-state dynamic models of first-order, ordinary differential equations sourced from .\nInspired by Hoai et al. , Keijzer , Johnson , Uy et al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
