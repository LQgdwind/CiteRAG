      "content": "Paper Title: Medical Image Captioning via Generative Pretrained Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince image captioning is a multimodal problem, it draws a significant attention of both computer vision and natural language processing communities.\nThe latest surveys in the medical image captioning task   offer a detailed description of domain knowledge from radiology and deep learning. The first architectures to address this problem were CNN-RNN models from  and . However, the latter show satisfactory results only on the single-pathology tasks. With the new concept of attention approach, more papers began to use visual attention [ref]11,  and , being the first to use attention on medical images. Authors of [ref]11 presented the model that can fix its attention on salient objects while generating the corresponding words in the output sequence. Shortly after the visual-attention concept was exposed, text-attention was introduced by authors of  [ref]15 [ref]16. They used both semantic and visual attention, that allowed them to get high natural language generation (NLG) metrics on medical datasets. Authors of [ref]15 introduced a framework generating natural reports for the Chest-Xray14 dataset  - TieNet. It was trained for solving several tasks such as classification, localization, and text generation. It used a non-hierarchical CNN-LSTM approach together with the attention to semantic and visual features, as it allowed to beat the current state-of-the-art results. In the , bone fracture X-Ray reports were generated by identifying image features and filling text templates. Authors of [ref]16 suggested a multi-task framework, that can both predict tags and generate texts using co-attention mechanism. This model is still not sufficient for producing accurate diagnosis from X-Rays as the produced texts still contained repeated sentences due to a lack of contextual coherence in the hierarchical models.\nThe authors of  took advantage of a sentence-level attention mechanism in a late fusion fashion. They took advantage of the multi-view images using both frontal and lateral views from the Open-I dataset . Authors of  proposed to utilize a pre-constructed knowledge graph embedding module (extracted from the Open-I images using Chexnet models ) on multiple disease findings to assist the report generation process. Authors of  exposed an anomaly detection method for detecting abnormalities on chest X-Rays with deep perceptual autoencoders. The authors of  first generated topics for sentences using reinforcement learning (RL) followed by the word decoder sequence generation from the topic with attention to the original images. RL was used for tuning to optimize readability. We solve this problem in a simpler method without losing in quality. To extract topics, we use the NegBio labeller  , which provides topics from clinical reports. We add these topics to the beginning of the medical report, for our model to understand where exactly the text should be generated. The paper in  dives into reporting abnormal findings on radiology images. The proposed method learns conditional visual-semantic embeddings in radiology images and reports further used to measure the similarity between image regions and medical reports. This by optimizing a triplet ranking loss. The authors of  developed an algorithm that learns fine-grained description of findings from images and uses their pattern of occurrences to retrieve and customize similar reports from a large report database. The work in  proposed a Contrast Induced Attention Network (CIA-Net), using contrastive learning on the aligned positive and negative samples for the disease localization on the chest X-Ray images. The work in  studies the cross-domain performance, agreement between models, and model representations for X-Rays diagnostic prediction tasks. The authors test for concept similarity by regularizing a network to group tasks across multiple datasets together and observe variation across the tasks. The model in  generates a short textual summary with essential information on the found pathologies along with their location and severity. The model is trained on only 2% of the MIMIC-CXR dataset, and generates short reports. Although, in this work, we train on whole MIMIC-CXR and generate full-text report. Authors of      attempted to use transformer-based models as decoders in the image captioning domain. The  affirmed affirmed to generate radiology reports through the custom transformer with additional memory-driven unit. Another model was introduced in  where encoder detects regions of interest via a bottom-up attention module and extracts top-down visual features. In this study, the decoder is presented as a custom transformer. For example, the paper in  proposes an approach called ”pseudo self-attention”. Its main idea is to incorporate the conditioning input as a pseudo history to a pretrained transformer. They add a new key and value weights in the self-attention module to be projected onto the decoder’s self-attention space, while  focuses on visual and weighted semantic features.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: CNN-RNN models from  and .
