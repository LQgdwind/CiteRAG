      "content": "Paper Title: Contrastive Learning for Compact Single Image Dehazing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSingle image dehazing aims to generate the haze-free images from the hazy observation images, which can be categorized into prior-based methods  [ref]17   and learning-based methods [ref]5 [ref]25   . Prior-based Image Dehazing Methods.\nThese methods depend on the physical scattering model  and usually remove the haze using handcraft priors from empirical observation, such as contrast maximization , dark channel prior (DCP) [ref]17, color attenuation prior  and non-local prior .\nAlthough these prior-based methods achieve promising results, the priors depend on the relative assumption and specific target scene, which leads to less robustness in the complex practical scene. For instance, DCP [ref]17 cannot well dehaze the sky regions, since it does not satisfy with the prior assumption. Learning-based Image Dehazing Methods.\nDifferent from prior-based methods, learning-based methods are data-driven, which often use deep neural networks to estimate the transmission map and atmospheric light in the physical scattering model [ref]5  [ref]25  or directly learn hazy-to-clear image translation     . Early works [ref]5  [ref]25  focus on directly estimating the transmission map and atmospheric light. However, these methods may cause a cumulative error to generate the artifacts, since the inaccurate estimation or some estimation bias on the transmission map and the global atmospheric light results in large reconstruction error between the restored images and the clear ones. Besides, it is difficult or expensive to collect the ground-truth about transmission map and global atmospheric light in the real world. Recently, various end-to-end methods        have been proposed to directly learn hazy-to-clear image translation without using atmospheric scattering model.\nMost of them     focus on strengthening the dehazing network and adopt clear images as positive samples to guide the dehazing network via image reconstruction loss without any regularization on images or features. For instance, Qin et al.  proposed a feature fusion attention mechanism network to enhance flexibility by dealing with different types of information, which only uses L1 based reconstruction loss between the restored image and ground-truth.\nDong et al.  proposed a boosted decoder to progressively restore the haze-free image by only considering the reconstruction error using ground-truth as supervision. To better use the knowledge from positive samples, Hong et al.  introduced an additional teacher network to transfer knowledge from the intermediate representation of the positive image extracted by the teacher to the student/dehazing network.\nAlthough these methods utilize the information of positive images as an upper bound, the artifacts or unsatisfied results still happen due to the unexploited information of negative images as an lower bound. Moreover, these methods are also performance-oriented to significantly increase the depth of the dehazing network, which leads to heavy computation and parameter costs. Different from these methods, we propose a novel contrastive regularization to exploit both the information of negative images and positive images via contrastive learning. Furthermore, our dehazing network is compact by reducing the number of layers and spatial size based on autoencoder-like framework.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: Single image dehazing aims to generate the haze-free images from the hazy observation images, which can be categorized into prior-based methods  [ref]17   and learning-based methods [ref]5 [ref]25   .
