PP.This research was partially supported by the ERC AdG project 787914 FRAPPANT, the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 101008233 (MISSION), the DFG Research Training Group 2236 UnRAVeL, and the DFF project AuRoRa.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVerifying programs written in more general probabilistic programming languages than Prism – think: with unbounded variable domains – is arguably harder than ordinary program verification  .\nIn particular, those programs correspond to infinite-state MDPs , just like arbitrary programs correspond to infinite transition systems.\nHence, model checking by explicit state space exploration becomes infeasible. To reason about non-probabilistic programs, one may use deductive verification approaches, such as Hoare logic or weakest preconditions.\nFor probabilistic programs, Kozen was the first to propose a dynamic logic   for reasoning about expected values of probabilistic programs with unbounded loops.\nMcIver and Morgan [ref]37 extended Kozen’s approach by incorporating nondeterministic choices.\nThey also coined the term weakest preexpectation calculus in reminiscence of Dijkstra’s weakest preconditions.\nIntuitively, the weakest preexpectation 𝗐𝗉⟦C⟧(X)\\mathsf{wp}\\llbracket C\\rrbracket\\left(X\\right) of a program C𝐶C and a random variable X𝑋X maps every initial program state σ𝜎\\sigma to the (minimal or maximal) expected value of X𝑋X after termination of C𝐶C on σ𝜎\\sigma.\nThe main advantage of such 𝗐𝗉𝗐𝗉\\mathsf{wp}-style calculi is that they can be defined as symbolic – and even entirely syntactic  – expressions by induction on the program structure.\nThey are in that sense compositional.\nFor example, the weakest preexpectation of the program {C1}[p]{C2}delimited-[]𝑝subscript𝐶1subscript𝐶2\\left\\{\\,{C_{1}}\\,\\right\\}\\mathrel{\\left[\\,p\\,\\right]}\\left\\{\\,{C_{2}}\\,\\right\\}, which executes C1subscript𝐶1C_{1} with probability p𝑝p and C2subscript𝐶2C_{2} with probability (1−p)1𝑝(1-p), is given by That is, if we already know the expected value of random variable X𝑋X after termination of the subprograms C1subscript𝐶1C_{1} and C2subscript𝐶2C_{2}, respectively, then the expected value of X𝑋X after termination of {C1}[p]{C2}delimited-[]𝑝subscript𝐶1subscript𝐶2\\left\\{\\,{C_{1}}\\,\\right\\}\\mathrel{\\left[\\,p\\,\\right]}\\left\\{\\,{C_{2}}\\,\\right\\} is a weighted sum of those expected values.\nHence, 𝗐𝗉𝗐𝗉\\mathsf{wp}-style calculi enable formal reasoning about probabilistic programs. Joost-Pieter’s works on PP verification feature advanced 𝗐𝗉𝗐𝗉\\mathsf{wp}-style calculi for reasoning about, amongst others, conditioning , expected runtimes  , probabilistic pointer programs [ref]11, and amortized expected runtimes .\nJoost-Pieter also pushed for automating verification, e.g. through techniques for learning loop invariants  [ref]6, specialized proof rules   , novel verification algorithms  , and by developing an automated verification infrastructure . Throughout those works, probabilistic programs turned out to be full of subtleties.\nFor example, the semantics of allowing observations inside of loops is non-trivial . The same holds for allowing variables with mixed-sign data domains .\nJoost-Pieter thus always strongly advised that the developed calculi must be proven sound with respect to an intuitive operational model. More technically put, a 𝗐𝗉𝗐𝗉\\mathsf{wp}-style calculus should be accompanied by a soundness theorem stating that, for every initial program state, the value obtained from the calculus corresponds to the (minimal or maximal) expected reward of an MDP representing the program’s operational semantics.111There are of course other reasonable semantical models of probabilistic programs that one could consider as a “ground truth”, such as\nprobabilistic Turing machines ,\nstochastic Petri nets ,\nmeasure transformers ,\nprobabilistic control flow graphs ,\nstochastic lambda calculi ,\nor even formal approaches where one assumes that the de facto semantics is the sampler , to name only a few.\nBut – borrowing from the Rifleman’s Creed :\nMDPs are Joost-Pieter’s operational model.\nThere are many like it, but this one is Joost-Pieter’s. When attempting to connect 𝗐𝗉𝗐𝗉\\mathsf{wp}-style calculi to expected rewards of suitable MDPs, one encounters the following (solved) issue: An operational semantics models how a program is executed, i.e. it moves forward through a program, whereas 𝗐𝗉𝗐𝗉\\mathsf{wp}-style calculi push suitable objects (usually random variables) backward through a program.\nIn particular, for nondeterministic choices, a semantics based on MDPs resolves all nondeterminism upfront (through a scheduler), whereas 𝗐𝗉𝗐𝗉\\mathsf{wp}-style calculi resolve nondeterminism on demand. A similar issue arises when reasoning about unbounded loops. Both approaches deal with loops by unfolding them, i.e. they treat the following two programs as equivalent: As is standard for operational semantics , the MDP semantics unfolds loops on demand.\nBy contrast, 𝗐𝗉𝗐𝗉\\mathsf{wp} calculi capture all unfoldings at once through taking the least fixed point of the above equivalence, as is standard for denotational semantics .\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: preconditions.\nFor probabilistic programs, Kozen was the first to propose a dynamic logic   for reasoning about expected values of probabilistic programs with unbounded loops.\nMcIver and Morgan [ref]37 extended Kozen’s approach by incorporating nondeterministic choices.\nThey also coined the term weakest preexpectation calculus in reminiscence of Dijkstra’s weakest\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1.
