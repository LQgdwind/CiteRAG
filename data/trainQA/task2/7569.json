      "content": "Paper Title: Deployment Challenges of Industrial Intrusion Detection Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe number of cyberattacks on Industrial Control Systems, ranging from manufacturing over power grids to water and gas distribution, exploded in recent years  .\nThe protection of such facilities is, however, not trivial as many systems rely on insecure legacy communication protocols, replacement of which is cumbersome, expensive, and often unrealistic due to high uptime requirements .\nConsequently, recent research focuses on easily retrofittable Industrial Intrusion Detection Systems specifically designed to take advantage of the unique characteristics of each ICS by searching for anomalous behavior in largely predictable networking patterns and physical processes 0. The foundation of these detection mechanisms is mostly rooted in classical supervised machine-learning or One-Class Classifiers 0 1.\nIn supervised approaches, the IIDS is trained on labeled samples of genuine behavior and attacks to learn classifiers, e.g., Random Forests or Support Vector Machines .\nMeanwhile, OCCs are trained only on genuine ICS behavior, e.g., to identify the operational boundaries of physical measurements 0, and deviations from this learned behavior are classified as potential attacks. Research demonstrates the alleged effectiveness of hundreds of newly proposed IIDSs by evaluating them on dedicated datasets and publishing achieved detection performances [ref]6 0.\nIn vitro, these IIDSs achieve excellent results    0.\nHowever, when it comes to real-world deployments, these solutions are challenging to configure  and then cannot perform as promised  7.\nConsequently, the performance derived by current evaluation methodologies seems hardly representative of the actual quality of an IIDS if deployed in the real world.\nWhile the scientific literature already identifies various challenges for transferring IIDSs from research into practice  7, we proclaim that two crucial aspects impacting IIDSs’ deployability remain unaddressed. First, it remains unclear how much training data is required to maximize detection performance.\nThis question is especially critical in the case of supervised IIDSs, where the collection of attack samples in a testbed might still be relatively easy, but collecting real-world attack samples is much harder .\nOCCs’ genuine training data, on the other hand, is easily collectable, but they still require hyperparameter tuning .\nYet, hyperparameter tuning is rarely intuitive, especially with often-employed custom classifiers, and it remains unknown whether it is possible to transfer good hyperparameters between ICS deployments as considered feasible in other machine-leraning domains 6.\nIn research, the authors thus may optimize them for a given dataset (with attacks), which is, however, unfeasible in practice due to lack of attack samples. Machine-learning for intrusion detection in the ICS domain is especially challenging because of hard to obtain attack samples from cyberattacks in real systems, as their collection would expose, disrupt, and potentially damage sensitive critical infrastructure and manufacturing facilities.\nFor artificial datasets and testbeds as used in research [ref]6, on the other hand, it is relatively easy to generate such attack samples.\nThus far, IIDS proposals do, however, all require custom training phases for the concrete deployment with hardly any model transferability across scenarios  1.\nWe thus observe a large discrepancy between training data availability for research activities and real-world deployments, which may be the culprit for the reported challenging deployment of current research proposals . Contributions. To investigate the potential influence of training data availability on IIDSs’ deployability, we make the following contributions: We demonstrate that the amount of attack samples in training significantly influences the performance of IIDSs based on supervised machine-learning. We show that the influence of hyperparameters for OCC-based IIDSs varies tremendously.\nWhile some may depend on attack samples for tuning, others are largely hyperparameter-agnostic and even generalize across deployments. Based on our findings, we advocate for more expressive IIDS evaluation procedures to close the gap between research and real-world IIDS deployments.
