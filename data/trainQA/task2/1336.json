      "content": "Paper Title: KVL-BERT: Knowledge Enhanced Visual-and-Linguistic BERT for Visual Commonsense Reasoning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAfter the success of pre-training for computer vision ([ref]23, ) and natural language processing ([ref]13, , ) tasks, a series of cross-modal pre-training models are designed. These models utilize self-supervised setting to get joint image-text embedding, gaining appealing results on various visual-linguistic tasks. Masked Language Model [ref]13 and similar Masked Region Prediction  tasks are utilized in cross-modal pre-training. And similar to Next-Sentence Prediction [ref]13, Image-Text Matching (, [ref]16, ) task in also widely used.  also adds extra scene graph prediction tasks (object prediction, attribute prediction and relationship prediction) in the pre-training phase, where the scene graph is constructed by parsing the text sentence into object nodes, attribute nodes and relationship nodes. These latest models are based on different variables of Transformers. VideoBERT  uses off-the-shelf networks to process video clips that are assigned to different clusters, whose ids will be predicted during pre-training. In ViLBERT , LXMERT  and ERNIE-ViL , two-stream architecture is introduced. Two single-modal networks process the input image and sentence respectively, then a cross-modal Transformer combines two kinds of information. On the contrary, VisualBERT , Unicoder-VL , VL-BERT [ref]16, B2T2  UNITER  and VILLA  propose the single-stream architecture, where a single Transformer is applied to both image and text contents. Compared to the two-stream architecture, it fuses cross-modal information earlier and more flexibly. In our paper, we adopt the single-stream VL-BERT as the backbone to incorporate external commonsense knowledge.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: After the success of pre-training for computer vision ([ref]23, ) and natural language processing ([ref]13, , ) tasks, a series of cross-modal pre-training models are designed.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
