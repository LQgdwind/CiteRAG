      "content": "Paper Title: High Definition Map Mapping and Update: A General Overview and Future Directions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe LIDAR odometry can be estimated from the successive point cloud scans over time, like visual odometry. There are three common methods to estimate LIDAR odometry, 3D registration based (dense), 3D feature based (sparse), and 3D deep learning method. The first method relies on all the point cloud data, which means the calculation burden is very high, and the real-time capability is hard to be achieved . The classic method to perform point association is iterative closest point (ICP), including point-line ICP , point-plane ICP [ref]162, and generalized ICP .  proposes loop closure algorithm together with ICP and pose graph process to reduce the drift caused by consecutive registration. [ref]165 uses IMU data to compensate for bad initial guesses to achieve an accurate localization. [ref]166 proposed downsampling via normal covariance filter (NCF) method and outlier rejection via geometric correspondence rejector to achieve an accurate odometry result.  use an elastic trajectory, which allows pose continuity intrascan and discontinuity in between scans to make sure the robustness in high-frequency movements.  proposed a health monitoring approach where it feeds on IMU, wheel inertial odometry (WIO), kinematics inertial odometry (KIO), and VIO to select the priority reference localization to supplement LIDAR odometry result.  proposed a direct alignment of dense point clouds which is down-sampled to achieve computational tractability.\nIn 2014, LOAM  began to popularize the 3D feature-based method as it reached the top of the KITTI LIDAR odometry benchmark and stayed at the top for seven years. Features based method relies on the handcrafted features such as planes, lines , edges, and ground points. These works utilize the knowledge gained from VO techniques and translate it into the 3D domain. TVL-SLAM  proposes an independent channel for visual and LIDAR frontend and optimizes the measurement results in the backend optimizations.  proposes a method to efficiently register point cloud by using non-ground spherical images and birds-eye-view maps to exclude ground points.\n proposed a novel approach called continuous-time ICP (CT-ICP) with loop closure steps that can work in real-time mode. This method improves the precision and robustness in high-frequency motions by allowing elastic distortion in between scan registration. Some researchers approached the problem by using a deep learning algorithm to solve the LIDAR odometry problem.  is the first method to use the deep learning approach by transferring the 3D point cloud into the image domain and feeding the data into the network. The network will output the displacement and changes in orientation between two input frames.  uses panoramic depth images as the representation of LIDAR data. LORAX  introduces super-points which is a subset of points positioned inside of a sphere-like local surface. LocNet  handcrafted a rotational invariant representation (RIR) which is generated from the ring distribution of the point clouds.  proposed a spherical coordinate system to project the LIDAR frames to 2D representation. Deep CLR  proposed a new architecture that applies flow embedding to generate features that describe the motions of each feature point.  extends the previous network by adding a plane point extraction. This increases the computational time by reducing the point cloud size by up to 40% - 50%.
