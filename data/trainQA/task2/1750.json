      "content": "Paper Title: Compacting Deep Neural Networks for Internet of Things: Methods and Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe lightweight DNNs can be used for IoT, which has been deployed for environmental sensing and surveillance. Huynh et al. [ref]189 developed a framework called DeepMon to optimize diverse CNNs on mobile GPUs and proposed an efficient and energy-saving DL inference system for mobile devices. First, they leveraged the similarity between consecutive frames of the video to design an intelligent caching mechanism for the convolutional layer. Second, they accelerated the high-dimensional matrix multiplication in the convolutional layer through matrix decomposition, which is the bottleneck in running convolutional layers on GPUs. DeepMon uses the adjusted Tucker-2  decomposition to further reduce the cut-down time of the convolutional layer. Regarding sensing applications, Yao et al.  developed a new general compression method for neural networks after absorbing the idea of dropout to drop hidden elements. Specifically, the redundant nodes are deleted as much as possible to reduce the size of the network after finding the optimal dropout probability of each hidden element in the network. Moreover, this framework also compresses sparse neural networks into dense structures with smaller sizes. Furthermore, the proposed model can be directly used in IoT devices without extra modifications. Extensive experiments also verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Moreover, lightweight DNNs can also be used in other sensing and surveillance scenarios. In particular, Wang et al.  combined the structure of the inverted residuals in MobileNetV2 and the SE module in SENet to design a lightweight neural network for weather monitoring. This model can effectively reduce the memory cost. Moreover, Yang et al.  combined the depth-wise separable convolution unit and SE Module to design a lightweight neural network for fire detection. Since fire detection is mainly based on color and different color channels have different sensitivity levels, the authors introduced a channel multiplier to emphasize the color channels to get a better detection result. Zhao et al.  proposed a DL technique for intelligent-edge surveillance. They utilized depth-wise separable convolution to reduce computational cost and combine edge computing with cloud computing to reduce network traffic. This method reaches 16 frames per second at the edge device and the cost at the edge device is only one-tenth of that of the centralized server. Experiments show the convincing results of the proposed technique in terms of computational cost and accuracy. To achieve good accuracy and comparative precision, Yassine et al.  adopted MobileNet with transfer-learning approach to construct a DL model for human detection for video surveillance. for tree= draw, semithick, rounded corners,\ntext width = 31mm, text badly centered,edge = draw, semithick, -stealth,\nanchor = north,\ngrow = south,\nforked edge, s sep = 4mm, l sep = 6mm, fork sep = 3.5mm, tier/.option=level,\nfill=red!5,\n\n[Upper Applications\n[ITS applications\n ]\n[UAV-enabled IoT \n\n[ref]185[ref]187\n]\n[Sensing and surveillance \n\n[ref]189\n]\n[Wearable IoT applications \n\n\n]\n[Miscellaneous \n \n]\n]\n\nReference markers found: [189]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]189: The lightweight DNNs can be used for IoT, which has been deployed for environmental sensing and surveillance.
