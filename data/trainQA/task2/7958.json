Sound Generation from Text and Video\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent generative models have developed dramatically, making content creation easier for people, including images, videos, and audio, based on text prompts.\nEspecially, text-to-video generation models such as Make-a-Video  and Sora  show the impressive emergence of generative models in the video domain, showing remarkable utility in film and advertising.\nWhile we are fully immersed in the video content by watching and listening, unfortunately, these generated videos are silent.\nGenerating the sound of a video is a challenging task requiring both a contextual and temporal understanding of the video.\nFigure 1 shows an actual example of when both text and video controls are required for generating realistic audio for the given video. In the video, a dog is growling while holding a toy in his mouth. A human can imagine the sound of the video; the dog growls lowly, and the growling sounds like the dog is biting something. When the person grips and pulls the toy, the dog will treat the human by growling louder. Finally, when the dog shakes his head, the growling will become louder.\nIf the generated audio does not understand the visual information, it will be a random growling sound, and it will not sound like the dog bites something. If the audio is not controlled by the text, the generated audio might be only related to the dog, e.g., a barking sound. Table 1 shows the recent attempts to generate an audio sample from the given video or the given text context. As shown in the table, there are two major directions to generate an audio sample from the given video directly. For example, there have been studies of a sound effect (SFX) generation with short moments for video editing tasks  [ref]7 3, known as Foley. These methods are restricted to the pre-defined sound effect classes and can only control discrete information, such as onset. As another attempt, video-to-audio (V2A) generation methods have been proposed recently  4 8 . They hardly generate sounds from multiple objects together but likely generate only simple sounds. Furthermore, both SFX and V2A methods cannot take text controls, which provide more rich control by users. Figure 1 shows the example when there is no text control; a V2A method just generates audio of “barking” rather than “growling” by focusing on the dog in the video. Our work aims to generate general sounds conditioned on both video and text for user control. As another line of research, text-to-audio (T2A) generation has been actively studied 7 5  0 6. Despite their diverse and high-quality audio generation quality, they lack a temporal understanding of video-only information. For example, like the example in Figure 1, text-only condition can make irrelevant audio to the video, namely, it might not be aligned with the given video, and it might not consider information only implied by visual information (e.g., the dog holds something in the mouth). To tackle the problem, we may need more controllability to the T2A model, such as AudioLDM 5.\nRecently, a few studies 1 2 tried to control the pre-trained AudioLDM more precisely based on ControlNet 6. Although they can control the pitch, temporal order, energy, or rhythm of the generated audio, their generation process needs expensive timestamp-wise annotations for each control feature.\nNamely, the existing T2A works cannot reflect the visual information hidden from the given text or pre-defined control features, and requires expensive timestamp-wise control features. In this work, we propose a novel video-and-text-to-sound generation approach, named Read, Watch and Scream (ReWaS), by integrating video as a conditional control for a well-established text-to-audio model.\nOur method is based on a state-of-the-art text-to-audio generation method, AudioLDM 5. While a text prompt specifies the subject, we additionally employ a control feature extracted from the video.\nMore specifically, our method presents an energy adapter on AudioLDM motivated from ControlNet 6, an efficient structure control method for text-to-image generation. Since a video feature does not directly imply the structure of the audio, we estimate the temporal energy information, a basic audio structural information, from the video. The energy operates as a time-varying control to complement the sound according to the dynamics of the given video.\nAs shown in Figure 1, ReWaS successfully understands complex information from both text and video.\nHere, we define energy as the mean of frequency in each audio frame, which is related to both visual dynamics and semantics  2.\nIt is relatively simple to estimate from a video rather than complex acoustic features (e.g., MFCC, mel-spectrograms).\nTherefore, our energy control facilitates connecting video for T2A model.\nLastly, our method offers a more flexible and effective solution thanks to the efficient training 6. We compare our method and other state-of-the-art video-to-audio generation models [ref]7 3  8  on two video-audio aligned datasets, VGGSound  and GreatestHits 8. In the experiments, ReWaS shows a superior audio generation performance quantitatively and qualitatively. For example, our method shows the best fidelity score (FID) and structure prediction (energy MAE) on both datasets. Furthermore, ReWaS outperforms V2A methods in human evaluation for three categories (audio quality, relevance to the video, and temporal alignment between audio and video) with a significant gap (almost +1 point for every category in 5-scale MOS). Also, as shown in the qualitative study, our method successfully deals with the temporal alignment of the visual information. For example, our method can capture the “short transition” of the skateboarding video when the boarder jumps into the air, and no skateboarding sound appears in the video.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: two major directions to generate an audio sample from the given video directly.
