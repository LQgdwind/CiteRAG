Extracting features varying to the number of cycles\nfor which the battery has operated attracts much attention. A critical\nprinciple is that the extracted features are expected to be of strong\ncorrelation with SoH . Point features can be simply extracted\nbased on the charging/discharging profiles during cycling, such as\nthe peaks of Incremental Capacity (IC) curves during the CC charging\n. Point features can be conveniently extracted mainly\ncharacterizing the transient state in each cycle. Interval features\ncan represent characteristics in a period, and they can also be easily\nextracted by intercepting values on the profiles at certain intervals.\nTherefore, information related to SoH may be over-simplified since\nonly values on the endpoints of the intervals are paid attention to.\nInterval features can be extracted as the charge time during the CC\ncharging  and time intervals of equispaced charge current/voltage\nchanging   for the instance. To capture the trend\nvariation of charging/discharging profiles during cycling, trend features\nare designed focusing on parameters varying upon a specific prior\nfunction modeling the profiles during a cycle. The trend of charging\ncurrent during CV charging is approximately exponential, and the parameter\nof the fitted exponential function can be used as a trend feature\n. Within a certain range of discharging voltage, differences\nin discharging capacity show a quadratic-function-formed trend to\ndischarging capacity. Parameters of the quadratic polynomial can be\naccordingly estimated as the trend feature as well .\nOther statistical features computed based on the whole profile of\na cycle can also be employed such as the mean  ,\nenergy [ref]54, Skewness [ref]54, and Kurtosis [ref]54,\netc. Following , we also extracted the trend feature based\non the quadratic model: Eq. (23) is defined for the profile of each\ncycle.

Other employed features include\naverage temperature, internal resistance, and charging time. To reduce\nthe measurement noise, the moving average is then applied to the extracted\nfeatures for better representative capability. All the extracted features\nfrom cell #124 are illustrated in Fig. 5 as an\nexample, and it should be noted that the features are 0-1 normalized\nin this figure for better illustration.\n\nReference markers found: [54]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]54: polynomial can be\naccordingly estimated as the trend feature as well .\nOther statistical features computed based on the whole profile of\na cycle can also be employed such as the mean  ,\nenergy [ref]54, Skewness [ref]54, and Kurtosis [ref]54,\netc. Following , we also extracted the trend feature based\non the quadratic model: Eq.
