      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey on Graph Neural Networks and Graph Transformers in Computer Vision: A Task-Oriented Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe input to visual question answering (VQA) is an image and a question expressed as text in a natural language, and the output is an answer to the question.\nSince questions usually describe not only the appearances and attributes of the visual constituents of the image, but also their relations, capturing the relations and aligning them with the question plays a vital role in VQA. Visual Question Answering.\nTeney et al.  introduce the graph representations of images and questions and further align the constructed graphs for VQA.\nSpecifically, in the image graph, visual objects become nodes, and relative spatial relations between objects become edge weights, while the question graph represents the dependencies among words via a dependency parser .\nA recurrent unit [ref]143 followed by an attention mechanism similar to cosine similarity with learnable transformations is used to process and align the two graphs for prediction. Instead of the language-irrelevant image graph construction, Norcliffe et al. [ref]144 use a graph learner to generate a sparse graph representation conditioned on the question for the image, followed by a graph CNN  to capture language-relevant spatial relations between objects in the image. Unlike previous methods that construct a static graph, Hu et al.  generate a dynamic visual graph where the edges between objects are updated during each GNN-based massage-passing iteration. The update is conditioned on the textual command vector extracted for each iteration (see Fig. 8). Jing et al.  adopt a similar architecture to answer multiple questions for compositional VQA.\nLi et al.  propose three graphs for representing semantic relations, spatial relations, and implicit relations between objects, respectively. A GAT is run on each graph to assign importance to nodes and learn relation-aware node representations.\nResults from the GATs are aggregated to predict the answer.\nInstead of feature-based graph representation,\nKim et al.  suggest using symbolic graphs generated through the scene graph parser  and dependency parser, respectively, to represent the image and question.\nNodes of such symbolic graphs represent semantic units (e.g., attributes and objects) in a textual form, and edges represent relations (e.g., predicates) between semantic units.\nThe message passing neural network  is applied to the two symbolic graphs to obtain informative representations and align their sub-graphs.\nSaqur et al.  further utilize the graph isomorphism network  to perform graph matching.\nAn accuracy comparison of these GNN-based methods on the VQA v2.0  and the GQA  datasets are shown in Tab. IV.\nIn addition, GNNs have been applied to TextVQA  and visual commonsense reasoning  , which extend the VQA task by reading texts in images and enabling commonsense reasoning, respectively. Fact-/Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering. Compared to classical VQA, fact-based VQA  involves an external knowledge base of facts to conduct joint reasoning with the image and question. A supporting fact is required to predict the correct answer for a pair of image and question. Narasimhan et al.  first parse and retrieve relevant facts from the external knowledge base using the image and question, and the retrieved facts are used to construct a fact graph. Then, they utilize a GCN to perform reasoning over the retrieved facts to identify the supporting fact and answer.\nIn addition to fact-based VQA, Singh et al.  extend the classical gated GNN  to integrate information from the knowledge base, question and image for knowledge-enabled VQA. They further conduct reasoning using the knowledge base to interpret text in the image for VQA.\nMarino et al.  construct a symbolic knowledge graph from the knowledge base and perform explicit reasoning on the graph via a relational GCN .\nThen, the results of such explicit reasoning and Transformer-based implicit reasoning are integrated for answer prediction. Video Question Answering.\nSimilar to the VQA approach in , Park et al.  represent the question as a parse question graph.\nTo capture temporal interactions in a video,\nthey also construct a frame-based appearance graph and a motion graph.\nThen, GCNs  are used to learn question-appearance and question-motion interactions on the three graphs.\nUnlike previous methods that use GNNs to learn relation-embedded node representations,\nYu et al.  utilize GNNs to adaptively propagate predicted probabilities among samples in the video to obtain consistent results for samples with high visual similarity. Instead of exploiting frame or motion-level information, some works [ref]166  suggest constructing object-level visual graphs.\nIn particular, Liu et al. [ref]166 combine GNNs and memory networks  to perform dynamic relation reasoning on visual and semantic graphs at the object level.\n\nReference markers found: [143]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]143: objects become nodes, and relative spatial relations between objects become edge weights, while the question graph represents the dependencies among words via a dependency parser .\nA recurrent unit [ref]143 followed by an attention mechanism similar to cosine similarity with learnable transformations is used to process and align the two graphs for prediction.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
