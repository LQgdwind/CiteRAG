      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Sign Language Translation with Monolingual Data by Sign Back-Translation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSign language serves as the primary communication method among the deaf community.\nHowever, in a society where the spoken language is primarily used, the deaf people face issues of social isolation and communication barrier in daily lives .\nDue to the significant social impact and the cross-modality challenge, sign language understanding has been attracting more and more research attention [ref]1  [ref]10    7 8.\nIn this paper, we concentrate on sign language translation (SLT),\nwhich aims to automatically generate the spoken language translation from a continuous sign video. Considering the different grammar rules and vocabularies of sign language and spoken language, SLT is typically treated as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem.\nExisting SLT systems typically rely on the encoder-decoder architectures [ref]10  .\nDespite the success of encoder-decoder networks in neural machine translation (NMT), the translation quality in SLT is limited, which is partially attributed to the huge gap in the training data size.\nWhile the News Translation task  provides over 77M English-German data,\nthe only suitable SLT dataset PHOENIX-2014T [ref]10 has less than 9K Sign-German data.\nTo alleviate it, there are two possible solutions, \\ie, collecting millions of parallel pairs or introducing monolingual data.\nThe high charge of sign video collection and annotation makes the former a luxury.\nIn contrast, making good use of accessible monolingual texts is a promising direction for SLT. In this work, we propose to generate synthetic parallel data with monolingual texts for SLT training.\nOur method is inspired by the success of text-to-text back-translation in NMT 6.\nThey train an inverse model with available pairs and use it to back-translate the monolingual data.\nHowever, when it goes to SLT,\nthe key challenge becomes how to bridge the huge domain gap between text and vision signals.\nA straightforward idea is to generate the sign video from a sentence, which,\nhowever is a more challenging task involving various immature techniques, such as skeleton prediction 5, gesture generation  and temporal coherence fidelity 8.\nA compromise option is to regress the feature sequence of video frames from a sentence.\nUnfortunately, it is an indeterminate problem and hard to formulate, because one sentence may correspond to numerous possible feature sequences, since the feature space of sign videos is far larger than the combination space of text vocabulary. To avoid the above problems, we propose a two-stage sign back-translation (SignBT) approach: text-to-gloss and gloss-to-sign.\nIt is formulated as an inverse problem of SLT with an additional signal “gloss” (see Figure 1).\nGloss is a token of sign language word, which is annotated along with the order of signs in a video with no clear boundaries.\nWe first train a text-to-gloss translator with available text-gloss pairs and predict the gloss sequence for each monolingual text.\nThen, to achieve the sequence-level gloss-to-sign conversion, we adopt a primitive but effective method, splicing sign pieces from features of segmented videos, which is somewhat analogous to concatenative text-to-speech synthesis  3.\nTo acquire the precise boundary of each gloss, we train a sign-to-gloss network with connectionist temporal classification (CTC)  and find the most likely alignment path for segmentation.\nThe sign pieces could be segmented and stored as a sign bank in advance.\nFinally, we simplify the whole process into a text-to-text back-translation problem and a sequence splicing operation from pieces in the bank. The key reason that the synthetic data benefits SLT training lies in the two aspects of realism,\n\\ie, the target text from the real language corpus and the source sign sequence spliced from the real feature bank.\nThough the fake pair may not be perfect as a real training data, it helps regularize the decoder when speaking target language and improve the robustness of extracting information from the source.\nThrough extensive experiments, we verify the significant improvement of SLT models brought by monolingual data. Acquiring high-quality corpus is always crucial for SLT. In this paper, we provide the first large-scale Chinese Sign Language Translation benchmark, CSL-Daily.\nThe native expression, compact annotation and clear hand details make our corpus suitable for a series of sign language research,\n\\eg, sign language recognition, translation and generation.\nThe evaluations on CSL-Daily of various SLT baselines are reported with in-depth analysis. Our main contributions are summarized as follows, We propose a sign back-translation approach to tackle parallel data shortage in SLT. We contribute a new large-scale SLT benchmark with rich contents and compact annotations. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our SignBT mechanism.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: and communication barrier in daily lives .\nDue to the significant social impact and the cross-modality challenge, sign language understanding has been attracting more and more research attention [ref]1  [ref]10    7 8.\nIn this paper, we concentrate on sign language translation (SLT),\nwhich aims to automatically generate the spoken language translation from a continuous sign video.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
