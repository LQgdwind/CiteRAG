      "content": "Paper Title: Circuits and Backdoors: Five Shades of the SETH\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe line of work summarized above\ncan be fairly considered quite successful: for many of the most famous\nproblems, not only do we know how to solve them in time ck‚ÄãnO‚Äã(1)superscriptùëêùëòsuperscriptùëõùëÇ1c^{k}n^{O(1)} for some\nconstant cùëêc and parameter kùëòk, but we know the precise value of the optimal\nconstant cùëêc, assuming the SETH. This is great, if one believes the SETH, but\nit is important to keep in mind that the SETH¬†is not universally believed and\nindeed, there seem to be serious reasons to doubt its validity, much more than\nthat of more standard assumptions (we refer the reader to the argumentation\ngiven by Williams  who, somewhat provocatively, assigns the\nSETH¬†a rather low probability of being true; see also ).\nAlthough SETH-based lower bounds are still useful (as pointed out in\n they show that before improving, for instance, the\n3-Coloring algorithm we mentioned, we should first try to disprove the\nSETH), it is somewhat problematic if SETH-based arguments are the only\nevidence of hardness we have for the most important problems. This line of reasoning has in fact already been well-developed in the\n(non-parameterized) fine-grained complexity community. In particular, there are\nseveral works which reprove (and improve) lower bounds based on the SETH¬†using a more plausible assumption, such as the NC-SETH, which states the same\nlower bound but for circuits of poly-logarithmic depth, rather than CNF\nformulas. We refer the reader to the work of Abboud, Hansen, Vassilevska\nWilliams, and Williams  for a more extensive discussion of\nwhy the NC-SETH¬†is a preferable hypothesis, or equivalently why falsifying the\nNC-SETH¬†would have far more surprising consequences than disproving the SETH.\nThe advantages of the NC-SETH¬†over the SETH¬†are taken into account in\nseveral other works in this area, for example\n[ref]1  . In contrast, in parameterized complexity\nthe SETH¬†is often referred to as an ‚Äúestablished‚Äù hypothesis, though in\nfairness this is mostly done in comparison to (even more) wide open hypotheses,\nsuch as the Set Cover Conjecture . Given the\nimportance of such lower bounds for the wider field, it would be useful if some\nmore convincing evidence could be provided.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: the\nNC-SETH¬†would have far more surprising consequences than disproving the SETH.\nThe advantages of the NC-SETH¬†over the SETH¬†are taken into account in\nseveral other works in this area, for example\n[ref]1  .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
