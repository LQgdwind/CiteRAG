The second factor represents the impact of rebuffering on the quality.\nIt is split into an initial buffering time Tinit​(s)∈[0,∞)subscript𝑇init𝑠0T_{\\text{init}}(s)\\in[0,\\infty) when starting the stream and the rebuffering time during playback Treb​(s)∈[0,∞)subscript𝑇reb𝑠0T_{\\text{reb}}(s)\\in[0,\\infty) with coefficients λinit,λreb≥0subscript𝜆initsubscript𝜆reb0\\lambda_{\\text{init}},\\lambda_{\\text{reb}}\\geq 0.\nRebuffering significantly affects the perceived quality and should be avoided at all times by switching to lower bitrates when necessary.
