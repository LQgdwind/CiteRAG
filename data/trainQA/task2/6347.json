      "content": "Paper Title: TopP&R: Robust Support Estimation Approach for Evaluating Fidelity and Diversity in Generative Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImproved Precision & Recall (P&R). Existing metrics such as IS and FID assess the performance of generative models with a single score while showing usefulness in determining performance rankings between models and are still widely used. These evaluation metrics have problems that they cannot provide detailed interpretations of the evaluation in terms of fidelity and diversity. Sajjadi et al.  tried to solve this problem by introducing the original Precision and Recall, which however has a limitation as it is inaccurate due to the simultaneous approximation of real support and fake support through “k𝑘k-means clustering”. For example, if we evaluate the fake images having high fidelity and large value of k𝑘k, many fake features can be classified in a small cluster with no real features, resulting in a low fidelity score (p​r​e​c​i​s​i​o​nP≔Q​(s​u​p​p​(P))≔𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜subscript𝑛𝑃𝑄𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑃precision_{P}\\coloneqq Q(supp(P))). Kynkäänniemi et al. [ref]13 focuses on the limitation from the support estimation and presents an P&R that allows us to more accurately assess fidelity and diversity by approximating real support and fake support separately: Here, s​u​p​p​(P)𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑃supp(P) is defined as the union of spheres centered on each real feature Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} and whose radius is the distance between k𝑘kth nearest real features of Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} Density & Coverage (D&C). Naeem et al. [ref]14 has reported that P&R cannot stably provide accurate fidelity and diversity when real or fake features are present through experiment. This limitation of P&R is that it has a problem with approximating overestimated supports by outliers due to the use of \"k𝑘k-nearest neighborhood\" algorithm. For a metric that is robust to outlying features, Naeem et al. [ref]14 proposes a new evaluation metric that only relies on the real support, based on the fact that a generative model often generates artifacts which possibly results in outlying features in the embedding space: In the equation, N​N​Dk​(Xi)𝑁𝑁subscript𝐷𝑘subscript𝑋𝑖NND_{k}(X_{i}) means the k𝑘kth-nearest neighborhood distance of Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} and ℬ​(Xi,N​N​Dk​(Xi))ℬsubscript𝑋𝑖𝑁𝑁subscript𝐷𝑘subscript𝑋𝑖\\mathcal{B}(X_{i},NND_{k}(X_{i})) denotes the hyper-sphere centered at Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} with radius N​N​Dk​(Xi)𝑁𝑁subscript𝐷𝑘subscript𝑋𝑖NND_{k}(X_{i}). However, D&C is only a partial solution because it still gives an inaccurate evaluation when a real outlying feature exists. Unlike coverage, density is not upper-bounded which makes it unclear exactly which ideal score a generative model should achieve. Geometric Evaluation of Data Representations (GCA). Poklukar et al. [ref]27 proposes a metric called GCM that assesses the fidelity and diversity of fake images. GCM uses the geometric and topological properties of connected components formed by vertex 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V} (feature) and edge ℰℰ\\mathcal{E} (connection). Briefly, when the pairwise distance between vertices is less than a certain threshold ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon, a connected component is formed by connecting two vertices with an edge. This set of connected components can be thought of as a graph 𝒢=(𝒱,ℰ)𝒢𝒱ℰ\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E}), and each connected component separated from each other in 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is defined as a subgraph 𝒢isubscript𝒢𝑖\\mathcal{G}_{i} (i.e., 𝒢=∪i𝒢i𝒢subscript𝑖subscript𝒢𝑖\\mathcal{G}=\\cup_{i}\\mathcal{G}_{i}). GCA uses the consistency c​(𝒢i)𝑐subscript𝒢𝑖c(\\mathcal{G}_{i}) and the quality q​(𝒢i)𝑞subscript𝒢𝑖q(\\mathcal{G}_{i}) to select the important subgraph 𝒢isubscript𝒢𝑖\\mathcal{G}_{i} that is formed on both real vertices and fake vertices (𝒱=𝒳∪𝒴𝒱𝒳𝒴\\mathcal{V}=\\mathcal{X}\\cup\\mathcal{Y}). c​(𝒢i)𝑐subscript𝒢𝑖c(\\mathcal{G}_{i}) evaluates the ratio of the number of real vertices and fake vertices and q​(𝒢i)𝑞subscript𝒢𝑖q(\\mathcal{G}_{i}) computes the ratio of the number of edges connecting real vertices and fake vertices to the total number of edges in 𝒢isubscript𝒢𝑖\\mathcal{G}_{i}. Given the consistency threshold ηcsubscript𝜂𝑐\\eta_{c} and quality threshold ηqsubscript𝜂𝑞\\eta_{q}, the set of important subgraphs is defined as 𝒮​(ηc,ηq)=∪q​(𝒢i)>ηq,c​(𝒢i)>ηc𝒢i𝒮subscript𝜂𝑐subscript𝜂𝑞subscriptformulae-sequence𝑞subscript𝒢𝑖subscript𝜂𝑞𝑐subscript𝒢𝑖subscript𝜂𝑐subscript𝒢𝑖\\mathcal{S}(\\eta_{c},\\eta_{q})=\\cup_{q(\\mathcal{G}_{i})>\\eta_{q},\\;c(\\mathcal{G}_{i})>\\eta_{c}}\\mathcal{G}_{i}. Based on this, GCA precision and recall are defined as follows: In above, 𝒮𝒴superscript𝒮𝒴\\mathcal{S}^{\\mathcal{Y}} and 𝒢𝒴superscript𝒢𝒴\\mathcal{G}^{\\mathcal{Y}} represent a subset (𝒱=𝒴,ℰ)𝒱𝒴ℰ(\\mathcal{V}=\\mathcal{Y},\\mathcal{E}) of each graph 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} and 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}, respectively. One of the drawbacks is that the new hyper-parameters ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon, ηcsubscript𝜂𝑐\\eta_{c}, and ηqsubscript𝜂𝑞\\eta_{q} need to be set arbitrarily according to the image dataset in order to evaluate fake images well. In addition, even if we use the hyper-parameters that seem most appropriate, it is difficult to verify that the actual evaluation results are correct because they do not approximate the underlying feature distribution. Manifold Topology Divergence (MTD). Barannikov et al.  proposes a new metric that uses the life-length of the k𝑘k-dimensional homology of connected components between real features and fake features formed through Vietoris-Rips filtration . MTD is simply defined as the sum of the life-length of homologies and is characterized by an evaluation trend consistent with the FID. Specifically, MTD constructs the graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} by connecting edges between features with a distance smaller than the threshold ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon. Then the birth and death of the k𝑘k-dimensional homologies in 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} are recorded by adjusting the threshold ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon from 0 to ∞\\infty. The life-length li​(h)subscript𝑙𝑖ℎl_{i}(h) is obtained through d​e​a​t​hi−b​i​r​t​hi𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡subscriptℎ𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑟𝑡subscriptℎ𝑖death_{i}-birth_{i} of any k𝑘k-dimensional homology hℎh, and let life-length set of all homologies as L​(h)𝐿ℎL(h). MTD repeats the process of obtaining L​(h)𝐿ℎL(h) on randomly sampled subsets 𝒳′∈𝒳superscript𝒳′𝒳\\mathcal{X^{\\prime}}\\in\\mathcal{X} and 𝒴′∈𝒴superscript𝒴′𝒴\\mathcal{Y}^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{Y} at each iteration, and defined as the following: However, MTD has a limitation of only considering a fixed dimensional homology for evaluation. In addition, MTD lacks interpretability as it evaluates the model with a single assessment score.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: in a small cluster with no real features, resulting in a low fidelity score (p​r​e​c​i​s​i​o​nP≔Q​(s​u​p​p​(P))≔𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜subscript𝑛𝑃𝑄𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑃precision_{P}\\coloneqq Q(supp(P))).
