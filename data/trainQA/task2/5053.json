      "content": "Paper Title: HGV4Risk: Hierarchical Global View-guided Sequence Representation Learning for Risk Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAiming at predicting the probability of future events, such as whether a patient will develop a disease or not, the risk prediction modeling is commonly used in the world of medicine   to help guide clinical decision-making but are also used in other fields such as finance and insurance  [ref]5 . As a typical time series modeling task [ref]7, risk prediction models usually make decision by learning trends of marker  or sequential behavior  from historical data. Recent studies show that some deep learning techniques, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants 0 1, have achieved impressive performance in such a sequence data representation learning task 2. Beyond plain RNNs, some studies have started to utilize attention mechanism to characterize the importance of the individualization in some general tasks such as computer vision 3 and natural language processing 4. Inspired by this, others have employed attention-based models 5 for structured data representation learning. Such typical time-aware models focus on learning weights for each time interval and capturing the long-term temporal dependencies at instance level. However, they fail to explore more granular information encoded in the original channel-level signal. To solve such problem, models in another branch such as RETAIN 6 and RetainEX 7 are proposed by exploring both temporal relationships and variable significance with a two-level neural attention framework. In this context, however, the irregularity of time intervals in historical sequence has not been addressed. To this end, some works 8 have been proposed to introduce decay modules for jointly learning time-decay and contextual dependencies during the representation learning with irregular time series data, achieving better prediction performance. Although aforementioned studies have addressed both long-term dependencies and time irregularity, the effect is still far from satisfactory. Self-attention architecture has been introduced in models such as SAnD 9 and HiTANet [ref]7 to further capture the sequential dependencies in time series data, thus achieving better prediction performance. To explore the relationship between dynamic information and static information, ConCare 0 has further improved the performance by modeling both channel-wise sequential dependencies and feature-dependencies while utilizing statics information. Most of the above-mentioned temporal modeling work rely on progressive manners, which typically captures the sequential dependencies merely from the time series data. From this perspective, although dynamic and static information is available, some existing studies are yet to be done in capturing inherent patterns other than sequential dependencies in time series data over long time spans. This will to some extent help to reveal the temporal rhythmic variation of the observed status in time series, which can be characterized by the temporal correlation graph induced from dynamic time series data, as shown in Fig. 1. For these heterogeneous data, a representation learning framework should be established for jointly modeling both sequential dependencies in time series data and the global status correlation in temporal correlation graph data, meanwhile adopting static information. In general, the major difference between our work and the above models is that we provide a new perspective for risk prediction modeling with the help of hierarchical representations learned from heterogeneous data. Given the limitations of existing methods, a workable model needs to meet three main challenges: 1) how to learn the temporal correlation among status in sequence data at instance level; 2) how to capture the specific patterns against long-term decay from channel-level irregular time series data in an explicit and end-to-end manner; 3) how to aggregate the channel-wise representations and instance-wise representations together with static information by a union hierarchical heterogeneous representation learning framework. Therefore, to address these issues, this paper makes the following contributions: For the purpose of obtaining sequential clip-aware representation from temporal correlation graph data at instance level, a global graph embedding method is proposed. A novel key-query attention, i.e., the harmonic β𝛽\\beta-attention, is proposed to learn a global trade-off between time-aware decay and observation significance for irregular time series data at channel level adaptively. To coordinate the hierarchical representation learned from both instance-level and channel-level data, a heterogeneous information aggregation strategy is introduced for modeling dependencies among the multi granularity information. We advance the representation learning framework HGV by testing it on two real-world risk prediction tasks across both healthcare and financial domains, and show its effectiveness.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: a disease or not, the risk prediction modeling is commonly used in the world of medicine   to help guide clinical decision-making but are also used in other fields such as finance and insurance  [ref]5 .
