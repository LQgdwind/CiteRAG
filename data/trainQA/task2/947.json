      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Few-Shot Learning through Multi-task Representation Learning Theory\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnderstanding meta-learning. While a complete theory for meta-learning is still lacking, several recent works aim to shed light on phenomena commonly observed in meta-learning by evaluating different intuitive heuristics. For instance,  investigate whether Maml¬†works well due to rapid learning with significant changes in the representations when deployed on target task, or due to feature reuse where the learned representation remains almost intact.\nIn , the authors explain the success of meta-learning approaches by their capability to either cluster classes more tightly in feature space (task-specific adaptation approach), or to search for meta-parameters that lie close in weight space to many task-specific minima (full fine-tuning approach). Finally, the effect of the number of shots on the FSC\naccuracy was studied in  for ProtoNet¬†. More recently, [ref]56 studied the impact of the permutation of labels when training Maml.\nOur paper investigates a new aspect of meta-learning that has never been studied before and, unlike , ,  and [ref]56, provides a more complete experimental evaluation with the two different approaches of meta-learning. \nNormalization. Multiple methods in the literature introduce a normalization of their features either to measure cosine similarity instead of Euclidean distance  [ref]39  or because of the noticed improvement in their performance  9 .\nIn this work, we proved in Section¬†3.3 above that for ProtoNet¬†prototypes normalization is enough to achieve a good coverage of the embedding space, and we empirically show in Section¬†4.2 below that it leads to better performance. Since we only normalize the prototypes and not all the features, we do not measure cosine similarity. Moreover, with our Theorem¬†3.1, we give explanations through MTR theory regarding the link between the coverage of the representation space and performance. \nCommon regularization strategies.\nIn general, we note that regularization in meta-learning (i) is applied to either the weights of the whole neural network  , or (ii) the predictions   or (iii) is introduced via a prior hypothesis biased regularized empirical risk minimization     .\nContrary to the first group of methods and weight decay approach , we do not regularize the whole weight matrix learned by the neural network but the linear predictors of its last layer. While weight decay is used to avoid overfitting by penalizing large magnitudes of weights, our goal is to keep the classification margin unchanged during the training to avoid over-/under-specialization to source tasks. Similarly, spectral normalization proposed by  does not affect the condition number Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa. Second, we regularize the singular values of the matrix of linear predictors obtained in the last batch of tasks instead of the predictions used by the methods of the second group (e.g., using the theoretic-information quantities in ). Finally, the works of the last group are related to the online setting with convex loss functions only and do not specifically target the spectral properties of the learned predictors.\n\nReference markers found: [56]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]56: that lie close in weight space to many task-specific minima (full fine-tuning approach). Finally, the effect of the number of shots on the FSC\naccuracy was studied in  for ProtoNet¬†.
