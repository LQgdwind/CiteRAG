Traditional Methods. The traditional methods have been fully researched since the RDBMS is proposed, the common core idea of these methods is to build a sketch for the data. The most representative methods include Sampling  [ref]21    , Sorting , Histograms        , and BloomFilter   . These methods usually have a low accuracy since introducing independent assumptions or losing too much information during sketching. However, a significant advantage of these methods is they do not rely on the query workloads since they learn directly from the data. There are also traditional methods that learn from queries rather than data , however, such methods are not commonly used in existing DBMS. Query-driven Methods. As the field of machine learning evolves, the regression methodology of the learned method was used for estimating cardinality . These query-driven methods        model cardinality estimation as a regression problem and train machine learning models from certain query workloads. Compared to traditional methods, learning from queries can achieve higher accuracy. However, when the query workloads drift from the training workloads, the model’s performance drops severely. Although there are some drift detection and updating algorithms are proposed , this type of method still suffers from workload drift and high training costs. Recently, a novel query-driven method [ref]45 that uses query masking to improve its robustness was proposed. However, its accuracy improvement relative to MSCN is still smaller than that of other advanced data-driven and hybrid methods relative to MSCN [ref]45   [ref]12. Data-driven Methods. To solve the workload drift problem, a few works use unsupervised machine learning to model the data. Probabilistic graphical models (PGM)   use Bayesian networks to model the joint data distribution, however, it also relies on conditional independence assumptions. Other works use kernel density estimation (KDE)  to avoid the conditional independence assumptions, but their performance is not satisfying enough. DeepDB  proposed Relational Sum Product Networks (RSPN) to model the data distribution. Although it still involves the conditional independent assumption, it can achieve better accuracy due to the RSPN design. An SPN-based method FLAT  has removed the conditional independent assumption and achieves relatively higher accuracy. Naru  is a pioneering work that has become a cornerstone of many other data-driven and hybrid cardinality estimation methods such as NeuroCard and UAE  [ref]12. It learns the joint data distribution with the autoregressive model and makes estimations through progressive sampling. But it has limited scalable ability, long-tail distribution on high-dimensional tables, and can’t use the information of queries to enhance the training as discussed in section I. FACE  is an autoregressive method based on a flow model. It can remove the progressive sampling and outperforms Naru in scalability, but its efficiency depends on whether there are already converged buckets. If not, it still takes an expensive iteration to sample. The recently proposed pre-training-based method  shows a very high performance in their experiments, which suggests its great potential. However, such a method highly relies on the assumption that most real-world datasets have common patterns in the frequency and correlation distributions. Hybrid Methods. In recent years, UAE [ref]12 has proposed modifying the progressive sampling used by Naru into differentiable to achieve hybrid training. By doing so, UAE can outperform Naru in most scenarios. Since UAE still needs to do progressive sampling to deal with range queries, UAE not only suffers from the scalable problem, but it also costs much higher memory and computational costs during training.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: traditional methods have been fully researched since the RDBMS is proposed, the common core idea of these methods is to build a sketch for the data.
