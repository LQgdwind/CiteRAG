      "content": "Paper Title: RepoFusion: Training Code Models to Understand Your Repository\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) of code  [ref]7  [ref]34    have gained significant popularity. The demand for these models has further increased with their integration into code assistants like GitHub Copilot \\@footnotemark and TabNine 222https://www.tabnine.com/, and their popularity is anticipated to grow further as more developer-assistance products are developed around them. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs of code often struggle to generalize effectively in unforeseen or unpredictable situations, resulting in undesirable predictions. Instances of such scenarios include code that uses private APIs or proprietary software, work-in-progress code, and any other context that the model has not seen while training. To address these limitations, one possible approach is to enhance the predictions of these models by incorporating the wider context available in the repository. Leveraging the structure and context of the repository can take into consideration dependencies between files, such as imports and parent classes, and provide valuable insights into coding patterns that may be specific to the organization or user. Recent works [ref]31   have shown promising results in utilizing repository-level context in conjugation with LLMs of code. It was also shown in  Shrivastava et al. [ref]31 that without specialized training, it is challenging to integrate multiple relevant contexts from the repository. Building upon these findings we propose RepoFusion, a training framework for learning to combine multiple relevant contexts from the repository in order to generate more accurate and context-aware code completions. In this work, we focus on the task of single-line code completion   which simulates real-world scenarios where users are editing existing files in an IDE. With reference to Figure 1, this means that we have to predict the missing section, referred to as the target hole (highlighted in green), starting from the cursor’s position until the end of the line. We see that the completion of this target hole will benefit from context not just in the current file (the variable name token), but also from other files in the repository. Specifically, the context from the imported file Account.java provides insight into the usage of the getTier method, while the sibling file Subscription.java offers guidance on the usage of Auth.user(\"bearer\", with the definition of Auth found in the imported file Auth.java. Given these relevant code snippets from across the repository which we call Repo Contexts (RCs), RepoFusion uses the Fusion-in-Decoder  architecture to combine these. Specifically, each repo context is appended with the surrounding context i.e., a window around the target hole excluding the target hole (highlighted in gray) and encoded separately. A decoder jointly attends to the concatenated encoded representations to produce a prediction for the target hole (highlighted in red). The key contributions of our paper can be listed as follows: We propose RepoFusion, a framework that helps code models to make better predictions by learning to combine relevant contextual cues from the repository. Through extensive experiments we establish that RepoFusion, a 220M parameter model, significantly outperforms several larger models trained on the next-token prediction objective such as CodeGen-16B . Furthermore, despite being approximately 70 times smaller in size, our model closely matches the performance of StarCoderBase , a 15.5B parameter LLM trained with the Fill-in-the-Middle  objective. We conduct thorough ablation studies to gain insights into the key factors influencing RepoFusion, such as the nature of repository contexts, their lengths, the number of repository contexts, and other training configurations. One of the crucial findings is that leveraging information from diverse sources within a repository is the key to RepoFusion’s effectiveness. We create and release Stack-Repo, a dataset of 200 Java repositories with permissive licenses and near-deduplicated files that are augmented with three types of repository contexts. Our released resources can be found at: https://huggingface.co/RepoFusion.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Large Language Models (LLMs) of code  [ref]7  [ref]34    have gained significant popularity.
