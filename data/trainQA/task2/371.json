      "content": "Paper Title: Off-Policy Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPolicy often gets overfitted over one task and thus become harder to re-train during transfer learning task. Different techniques such as early stopping or regularization can be helpful in this case. An alternative solution is provided by [ref]14 through using variational bottleneck technique to control over the information that is fed to the discriminator using mutual information theory, which allows more controlled update in the generator. But this technique is highly dependent on hyper-parameter of the bottleneck itself, thus performance can be varied vastly if not tuned properly for each task. We want to learn a policy that gives a good performance during transfer learning without being dependent on exact hyper-parameter tuning. We propose using Multiplicative Compositional Policy (MCP)  to improve policy performance in transfer learning task. MCP was introduced to combine multiple primitive skills in RL setting and these primitve skills are controlled using a gating function. We propose using multiple primitive networks to learn single skill in IRL setting. Using a weighted multiplicative composition of Gaussian primitives improves imitation performance and allows more flexibility in composing into new policy in transfer learning. MCP  tries to learn different skills with different primitive policies and then reuse those learned skills by combining them to do a more sophisticated task. In hierarchical learning     it is common to learn premitives and then find a composite policy œÄ‚Äã(a|s)ùúãconditionalùëéùë†\\pi(a|s) by weighted sum of distribution from premitives œÄi‚Äã(a|s)subscriptùúãùëñconditionalùëéùë†\\pi_{i}(a|s). A gating function computes the weight wisubscriptùë§ùëñw_{i}, that determines the probability of activating each premitive for a given state, sùë†s. Composite policy can be written as: Here k denotes the number of primitives and this can be referred as additive model. Standard hierarchical learning models can sequentially select particular skill over time. In other words, can activate single primitive at each timestep. MCP  proposes an multiplicative model, where multiple primitives are activated at a given time-step. This allows an agent to learn a complex task requiring to perform more than one sub-task at a time. MCP  decomposes agent‚Äôs policy into premitives, train those primitive policies on different sub-tasks and then obtain a composite-policy by multiplicative composition of these premitives. Here each primitive is considered as distribution over actions and the composite policy is a multiplicative composition of these distribution. Thus, MCP enables an agent to activate multiple primitives simultaneously with each primitive specializing in different behaviors that can be composed to produce a continuous spectrum of skills, whereas, standard hierarchical algorithm only activate single primitive at a time.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: and thus become harder to re-train during transfer learning task.
