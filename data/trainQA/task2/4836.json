      "content": "Paper Title: Token-Label Alignment for Vision Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVision Transformer.\nTransformers have been widely used in natural language processing and achieved great success on many language tasks.\nRecently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have aroused extensive interest in computer vision due to their competitive performance compared with CNNs 6 [ref]40 [ref]29 .\nDosovitskiy et al. 6 firstly introduced transformers into the image classification task.\nThey split the input image into non-overlapped patches and then feed them into the transformer encoders.\nLiu et al. [ref]29 proposed a shifted windowing scheme to produce hierarchical feature maps suitable for dense prediction tasks.\nThe great potential of vision transformer has motivated its adaptation to many challenging tasks including object detection   , segmentation  , image enhancement   and video understanding  . Recently, some efforts have been devoted to producing better training targets to improve the performance of vision transformers  .\nFor example, DeiT [ref]40 introduces a knowledge distillation procedure to reduce the training cost of ViTs and achieves a better accuracy/speed trade-off.\nTokenLabeling  employs a pretrained teacher annotator to predict a label for each token for dense knowledge distillation.\nDifferently, we do not require a pretrained network to obtain the training targets.\nOur TL-Align maintains an aligned label for each token layer by layer and can be trained efficiently in an end-to-end manner. Data Mixing Strategy.\nAs an important type of data augmentation, data mixing strategies have demonstrated a consistent improvement in the generalization performance of CNNs.\nZhang et al. 0 first proposed to combine a training pair to create augmented samples for model regularization.\nThey perform linear interpolations on both the input images and associated targets.\nFollowing MixUp, CutMix  also utilizes the mixture of two input images but adopts a region copy-and-paste operation.\nLater methods including Puzzle Mix , SaliencyMix  and Attentive CutMix  leverage the salient regions for informative mixture generation.\nRecently, Yang et al.  proposed a RecursiveMix strategy which employs the historical input-prediction-label triplets for scale-invariant feature learning.\nDespite the better performance, a drawback of these methods is the heavily increased training cost due to the saliency extraction or historical information exploitation. Most existing data mixing methods are originally designed for CNNs, and their effectiveness on ViTs has not been well explored.\nTransMix  uses the class attention map at the last layer to re-weight the mixing targets and assumes the output tokens to keep spatial correspondence with the input tokens.\nHowever, we identify a token fluctuation phenomenon for ViTs which may cause a mismatch between tokens and labels, leading to inaccurate label assignments in both the original CutMix and TransMix.\nTo address this, we propose to align the label and token space by tracing their correspondence in a layerwise manner.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: and achieved great success on many language tasks.\nRecently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have aroused extensive interest in computer vision due to their competitive performance compared with CNNs 6 [ref]40 [ref]29 .\nDosovitskiy et al. 6 firstly introduced transformers into the image classification task.\nThey split the input image into non-overlapped patches and then feed them into the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
