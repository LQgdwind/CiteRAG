      "content": "Paper Title: Leveraging the Video-level Semantic Consistency of Event for Audio-visual Event Localization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe show the visualization results of the attention module since AVEL , PSP [ref]5, and the proposed VSCG adopt the same auditory-guided visual attention module (AGVA) . The results show that the proposed VSCG is better able to focus on the visual areas that are closely related to the sound source. As shown in Figure 4, the sample event itself is elementary, but the presence of occlusion makes it difficult for the machine to utilize the visual information. For the “church bell ringing” event, VSCG can always focus on the area within the visual area that is closely related to the “bell ringing”, e.g., the area where the bell that emits the ringing is located. In contrast, even though the video content and the auditory content presented in the video are continuously stable, the area of interest of PSP [ref]5 is scattered and changes over time. The AGVA module in [ref]5 even completely focuses on the independent area in the 5th and 6th segments. For AVEL , the sound is incorrectly located in the “sky” area of the background all the time due to the influence of the occlusion. In the example of “church bell ringing” shown in Figure 4, even with the introduction of auditory modality, it is still challenging to locate the obscured sound source (bell) in the visual area. However, in the proposed VSCG network, the ESCM module enables the model to capture the visual representation of the “church bell ringing” event as the dependency structure of the “bell tower and bell”. This verifies that our approach learns deep semantic information about the event rather than just the features of modalities. Thus, the actual location of the sounding object can be better localized based on the audio information by our method. As shown in Figure 5, the proposed method is able to locate more accurately when there are multiple sound-emitting regions in the image. The “flush” event in the lower panel of Figure 5, due to the vertical structure of the sink, causes the water flowing out to collide with the upper wall first and then downward to impact the lower wall to make a sound. We argue that due to ISCE introducing video-level semantic information as prior knowledge for temporal modeling, the model can more accurately locate the sound-emitting region and learn the changes over time, thereby behaving more correctly to physical laws. As shown in Figure 5, AVEL  and PSP [ref]5 do not have such a property.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: We show the visualization results of the attention module since AVEL , PSP [ref]5, and the proposed VSCG adopt the same auditory-guided visual attention module (AGVA) .
