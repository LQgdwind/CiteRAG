      "content": "Paper Title: Link Prediction with Contextualized Self-Supervision\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLink prediction is an increasingly important task on graph-structured data with broad applications, such as friend recommendation [ref]1, knowledge graph completion , entity resolution [ref]3, and targeted advertising , etc. A straightforward solution to link prediction is to calculate some heuristic metrics, such as Common Neighbors , Adamic-Adar Index  and Katz Index , etc., to infer the link existence. Recently, learning based link prediction methods  [ref]8  have been proved more effective, as they are able to leverage not only richer structure semantics but also essential node attributes of networks. Nevertheless, the success of learning based link prediction methods relies heavily on the quality and static property of targeted networks. However, performing link prediction on real-world networks are usually confronted with three key challenges as follows: Link sparsity. Due to access restrictions or privacy concerns, most of real-world networks are sparse in the sense that the number of unconnected node pairs in an observed network grows quadratically as the number of links grows linearly . Akin to supervised learning for non-relational data, link sparsity incurs insufficient supervision for link prediction, resulting in poor performance. Node attribute noise. Real-world networks are often corrupted with node attribute noise, for example, inaccurate user profiles in social networks. This compromises the link prediction accuracy, particularly for learning based methods that highly rely on node attributes, for which incorrect mappings from node attributes to link existence could be learned. Dynamic changes. In many cases, networks are not static but dynamically changing with new nodes joining constantly, where no or only few links are observed. For these out-of-sample nodes, the absence or sparsity of their neighborhood structure makes it difficult for many learning based methods to perform link prediction accurately. As a paradigm of semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning (SSL)  has been leveraged as an effective strategy in computer vision to favor the supervised learning task through learning high-quality data representations from the unlabeled data. This has motivated us to exploit self-supervision to tackle the link sparsity challenge for link prediction. Although recent attempts have been made to exploit self-supervision on graphs for node classification via node-oriented pretext tasks such as node attribute prediction , they are not designed in an effective way to capture structural patterns that are essential for link prediction. To address the node attribute noise challenge, we propose to bridge self-supervised learning with structural context modeling to reinforce link prediction, as structural context has been proved beneficial to node representation learning  and attribute selection . To effectively predict the links of out-of-sample nodes (addressing the dynamic changes challenge), we design the main link prediction task as an end-to-end learning framework that leverages attributes of paired nodes to infer their link existence probability. With the structural context modeling based self-supervised learning, we can learn the link prediction model as an accurate mapping from node attributes to link existence, with stronger generalization ability for handling out-of-sample nodes. As such, the links of out-of-sample nodes can be accurately predicted by applying the trained model to the attributes of out-of-sample nodes, which effectively overcomes the negative impact caused by the absence or sparsity of their neighborhood structure. Based on the above insights, we propose a new contextualized self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for link prediction. The proposed CSSL framework exploits the power of structural context prediction based self-supervision to enable context-aware link prediction. Specifically, CSSL formulates a general learning framework that learns a link encoder to infer the link existence probability from paired node embeddings constructed from node attributes. The link encoder predicts the link existence probability through constructing edge embeddings from node embeddings, which effectively capture the attribute difference/similarity between connected nodes. This new formulation enables us to exploit the power of the homophily property  for link prediction—the fact that connected node pairs usually have similar attributes. The structural context prediction is modeled as a self-supervised learning task to boost the link prediction performance. We investigate two types of contextualized self-supervised learning tasks—context node prediction and context subgraph prediction, where context nodes and context subgraphs are sampled through short random walks. The proposed CSSL framework can be trained efficiently with stochastic gradient descent by sampling a minibatch of edges at each iteration and thus have a time complexity linear to the number of edges. As CSSL learns a mapping function from node attributes to the link existence, it has the ability to inductively predict the links for out-of-sample nodes, by applying the learned mapping function to the attributes of out-of-sample nodes. Besides, CSSL can be naturally extended to non-attributed networks through using one-hot encodings as node attributes. Fig. 1 provides an illustration to elaborate how the proposed CSSL framework addresses the three aforementioned link prediction challenges. To handle the link sparsity challenge,\nCSSL trains a probabilistic link prediction model more effectively via\ncontextualized self-supervision. This is accomplished by leveraging\nthe auxiliary link existence\nevidence conveyed in structural context,\nwhich can help train a high-quality embedding encoder to generate informative node embeddings for link prediction.\nTo tackle the attribute noise challenge, CSSL makes the best of structural context to rectify the discrepancy in noisy node attributes for robust link inference. In case of predicting the link existence between nodes 2 and 3, where attributes of node 3 are corrupted with noise, the well-trained embedding encoder allows CSSL to generate similar node embeddings from their common structural context, thereby alleviating the adverse impact of attribute noise on link prediction. To address the dynamic changes challenge, CSSL can inductively infer the link existence between out-of-sample nodes (e.g., node 6) and in-sample nodes (e.g., node 5) from their attributes, without the dependence on their neighborhood structure. We conduct extensive experiments on seven real-world attributed networks, which show that the proposed CSSL framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by large margins, under both transductive and inductive settings. This proves the advantages of CSSL in making the best of network structure and extracting useful information from noisy node attributes towards high-quality link prediction. In addition, we verify its scalability to large-scale networks and its significant advantages over competitive baselines for link prediction on non-attributed networks. The contribution of this paper is threefold: We analyze the negative impact of link sparsity, node attribute noise and dynamic changes on link prediction, which motivates the design of structural context prediction based self-supervised learning task for link prediction. We propose the first end-to-end contextualized self-supervision based link prediction framework that is inductive with the ability to predict the links for both in-sample and out-of-sample nodes and has the flexibility to handle both attributed and non-attributed networks. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies show the superiority of our approach over competitive baselines under both transductive and inductive settings, as well as its robustness to node attribute noise and scalablity to large-scale networks.\n The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review related work on link prediction. The link prediction problem is then formally defined in Section 3. In Section 4, we elaborate our proposed self-supervision based link prediction framework. Extensive experimental results are then reported in Section 5 to evaluate the proposed algorithm. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Link prediction is an increasingly important task on graph-structured data with broad applications, such as friend recommendation [ref]1, knowledge graph completion , entity resolution [ref]3, and targeted advertising , etc. A straightforward solution to link prediction is to calculate some heuristic metrics, such as Common\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
