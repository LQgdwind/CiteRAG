      "content": "Paper Title: Time Series as Images: Vision Transformer for Irregularly Sampled Time Series\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComparison to state-of-the-art. \nWe compare our approach with several state-of-the-art methods that are specifically designed for irregularly sampled time series, including Transformer [ref]38, Trans-mean (Transformer with an imputation method that replaces the missing value with the average observed value of the variable), GRU-D [ref]3, SeFT , mTAND [ref]34, IP-Net , and Raindrop . In addition, we also compared our method with two approaches initially designed for forecasting tasks, namely DGM2-O  and MTGNN . The implementation and hyperparameter settings of these baselines were kept consistent with those used in Raindrop . Specifically, a batch size of 128 was employed, and all compared models were trained for 20 epochs.\nTo ensure fairness in our evaluation, we averaged the performance of each method over 5 data splits that were kept consistent across all compared approaches. As shown in Table 2, our proposed approach demonstrates strong performance against the specialized state-of-the-art algorithms on all three datasets. Specifically, on the P19 and P12 datasets, ViTST achieves improvements of 2.2% and 0.7% in absolute AUROC points, and 1.3% and 2.9% in absolute AUPRC points over the state-of-the-art results, respectively. For the PAM dataset, the improvement is even more significant, with an increase of 7.3% in Accuracy, 6.3% in Precision, 6.2% in Recall, and 6.7% in absolute F1 score points. Leaving-sensors-out settings. \nWe conducted additional evaluations to assess the performance of our model under more challenging scenarios, where the observations of a subset of sensors (variables) were masked during testing. This setting simulates real-world scenarios when some sensors fail or become unreachable. Following the approach adopted in , we experimented with two setups using the PAM dataset: (1) leave-fixed-sensors-out, which drops a fixed set of sensors across all samples and compared methods, and (2) leave-random-sensors-out, which drops sensors randomly. It is important to note that only the observations in the validation and test sets were dropped, while the training set was kept unchanged. To ensure a fair comparison, we dropped the same set of sensors in the leave-fixed-sensors-out setting as in . The results are presented in Fig. 3, from which we observe that our approach consistently achieves the best performance and outperforms all the specialized baselines by a large margin. With the missing ratio increasing from 10% to 50%, our approach maintains strong performance, staying above 80%. In contrast, the comparison baseline shows a marked drop. The advantage of ViTST over the comparison baselines becomes increasingly significant. Even when half of the variables were dropped, our approach was still able to achieve acceptable performance over 80, surpassing the best-performing baseline Raindrop by 33.1% in Accuracy, 40.9% in Precision, 39.4% in Recall, and 42.8% in F1 score in the leave-fixed-sensors-out setting (all in absolute points). We also notice that the variances in our results are notably lower compared to the baselines. These results suggest that our approach is highly robust to varying degrees of missing observations in time series.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: Comparison to state-of-the-art. \nWe compare our approach with several state-of-the-art methods that are specifically designed for irregularly sampled time series, including Transformer [ref]38, Trans-mean (Transformer with an imputation method that replaces the missing value with the average observed value of the variable), GRU-D [ref]3, SeFT , mTAND [ref]34, IP-Net , and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
