      "content": "Paper Title: Pruning Adversarially Robust Neural Networks without Adversarial Examples\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial attacks has been the subject of extensive research recently [ref]1 [ref]2   . Such attacks are intentionally crafted to mislead DNNs towards incorrect predictions, e.g., by adding delicately but visually imperceptible perturbations to original, natural examples . Adversarial robustness, i.e., the ability of a trained model to maintain its predictive power despite such attacks, is an important property for many safety-critical applications  [ref]8 . The most common and effective way to attain adversarial robustness is via adversarial training    , i.e., training a model over adversarially generated examples. Adversarial training has shown reliable robustness performance against improved attack techniques such as projected gradient descent (PGD) , the Carlini & Wagner attack (CW)  and AutoAttack (AA) . Nevertheless, adversarial training is computationally expensive  , usually 3×3\\times–30×30\\times  longer than natural training, precisely due to the additional cost of generating adversarial examples. As noted by Madry et al. , achieving adversarial robustness requires a significantly wider and larger architecture than that for natural accuracy. The large network capacity required by adversarial training may limit its deployment on resource-constrained hardware or real-time applications.\nWeight pruning is a prominent compression technique to reduce model size without notable accuracy degradation        . While researchers have extensively explored weight pruning, only a few recent works have studied it jointly with adversarial robustness. Ye et al. , Gui et al. , and Sehwag et al.  apply active defense techniques with pruning in\ntheir research. However, these works require access to adversarial examples during pruning. Pruning is itself a laborious process, as effective pruning techniques simultaneously finetune an existing, pre-trained network; incorporating adversarial examples to this process significantly hampers training efficiency. Moreover, adversarial pruning techniques tailored to specific adversarial training methods need to be continually revised as new methods develop apace. In this paper, we study how take a dense, adversarially robust DNN, that has already been trained over adversarial examples, and prune it without any additional adversarial training. As a motivating example illustrated in Figure 1(a), a DNN publicly released by researchers or a company, trained adversarially at a large computational expense, could be subsequently pruned by other researchers to be made executable on a resource-constrained device, like an FPGA. Using our method, the latter could be done efficiently, without access to the computational resources required for adversarial pruning. Restricting pruning to access only natural examples poses a significant challenge. As shown in Figure 1(b), naïvely pruning a model without adversarial examples can be catastrophic, obliterating all robustness against AutoAttack. In contrast, our PwoA is notably robust under a broad range of pruning rates. Overall, we make the following contributions:\n We propose PwoA, an end-to-end framework for pruning a pre-trained adversarially robust model without generating adversarial examples, by (a) preserving robustness from the original model via self-distillation    and (b) enhancing robustness from natural examples via Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) as a regularizer  . Our work is the first to study how an adversarially pre-trained model can be efficiently pruned without access to adversarial examples. This is an important, novel challenge: prior to our study, it was unclear whether this was even possible. Our approach is generic, and is neither tailored nor restricted to specific pre-trained robust models, architectures, or adversarial training methods. We comprehensively evaluate PwoA on pre-trained adversarially robust models publicly released by other researchers. In particular, we prune five publicly available models that were pre-trained with state-of-the-art (SOTA) adversarial methods on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets. Compared to SOTA adversarial pruning methods, PwoA can prune a large fraction of weights while attaining comparable–or better–adversarial robustness, at a 4×\\times–7×\\times training speed up. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. We review related work in Section II. In Section III, we discuss standard adversarial robustness, knowledge distillation, and HSIC. In Section V, we present our method. Section VI includes our experiments; we conclude in Section VII.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial attacks has been the subject of extensive research recently [ref]1 [ref]2   .
