      "content": "Paper Title: Layer-wise Feedback Propagation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent decades, gradient-based optimization techniques, as described by  have become the preferred method for optimizing complex machine learning (ML) models, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). This fundamental concept continues to drive groundbreaking advancements in AI, as the works of [ref]2 [ref]3  demonstrate, among others. However, several issues have been identified with gradient-based training over the years. One such issue is the tendency for gradients to shatter in very deep models, resulting in behavior similar to white noise and making the training of deep models increasingly challenging . Additionally, the utility of gradients for training is limited to scenarios where they are not undefined and at least provide meaningful information rather than returning zero or infinite values, which render optimization impossible. Although this leaves a broad range of functions, there are still important cases where direct application of gradients is impractical. For example, models that employ discrete activation functions (such as step functions), e.g., SNNs  . Regarding training behavior, gradient-based optimization aims to identify the direction in the parameter space that results in the most significant reduction of the loss function. However, when dealing with large parameter spaces and complex loss landscapes, this approach can lead to unstable training behavior and high sensitivity to hyperparameters such as the learning rate. At the same time, previous research [ref]8  has demonstrated that even randomly initialized models with sufficient capacity often contain subnets that — when trained in isolation — are capable of achieving satisfactory performance on a given task. This suggests that deep models tend to be highly overparameterized in general. Given this observation, updating all parameters without discrimination towards a local optimum appears inefficient and unnecessarily unstable. It may be more advantageous to focus on identifying and extracting well-parameterized subnets that can be further optimized with minimal adjustments. Due to the aforementioned limitations of gradient-based optimization, several alternative training methods have recently emerged. For instance, a number of studies 0 1 2 3 4 formulate neural network training as alternating minimization problems. Another set of approaches 5 6 7 involves training models through evolutionary strategies, by making random alterations to the model’s parameters and selecting the best-performing version. 8 propose modeling each synapse as a reinforcement learning agent using Q-learning, with a discrete action space consisting of increase, decrease, or no action. Another novel approach, introduced by 9, is the Forward-Forward Method, which employs a contrastive approach where the traditional backward pass is replaced with a second forward pass that operates on (generated) negative data. Each layer’s objective is to maximize the goodness on positive data while minimizing it on negative data. These alternative methods offer new perspectives and techniques for training neural networks, addressing the limitations of gradient-based optimization and exploring different optimization paradigms. In recent years, the field of explainability has gained significant importance in the realm of AI. Within this field, a subset of methods      focuses on obtaining local explanations, which assign importance scores to individual features or groups of features in specific samples, based on the model’s behavior. These attribution scores provide insights into how the model responds to different features, offering a concise representation of its behavior. It is important to note that these methods are not limited to attributing importance solely to input features but can also determine the significance of individual units within a model. Previous studies have demonstrated the meaningfulness of these importance assignments, particularly in the case of LRP . LRP has been successfully applied to a variety of tasks, including pruning  or quantizing  models, or to mitigate catastrophic forgetting . LRP is a method that — after inference — is able to compute the contribution of network components to the prediction outcome. It achieves this by decomposing an initial relevance value at the output layer through a modified backward pass. Building upon this concept, we propose a novel approach called Layer-wise Feedback Propagation (LFP), which leverages LRP to distribute a reward (or feedback) to individual connections during training, based on an initial evaluation of the current prediction that measures its “goodness”. Through LFP, this feedback is distributed to each neuron and connection, assigning credit and providing a basis for updating parameters (see Figure 1). Fundamentally, while gradient-based optimization shifts all parameters towards the estimated direction of the largest decrease in loss, LFP distributes a reward to parameters, updating them based on their current contribution to solving the given task, thus implicitly working on a contributing subnet, relating it to the lottery ticket hypothesis [ref]8 . Rewards have shown great potential and have even been discussed as potential solutions for general AI , since they offer increased flexibility compared to the specificity of loss functions, potentially expanding the range of problems to which LFP can be applied. Since LFP is a novel training paradigm, our primary objective is to demonstrate that it provides a valid training signal and converges to a local optimum. However, complex learning problems often require careful hyperparameter tuning and additional techniques for optimizing convergence, which have been extensively researched for gradient descent, the established method for training neural networks. For LFP, such optimizations do not yet exist and further research is needed to refine and improve its performance. Nevertheless, gradient descent serves as our baseline, and we compare it to LFP in our experiments by restricting evaluations to simpler toy settings. If LFP performs well in toy settings, this is likely to extend to more complex scenarios as well, with appropriate parameterization and further research. It is important to note that we do not advocate for or against favoring one method over the other. Rather, our focus lies in examining the similarities and differences between LFP and gradient descent — as both are backpropagation-based methods — as well as exploring potential applications for LFP. The current work serves as a foundation for understanding the fundamental aspects of LFP, with future investigations expected to address optimization challenges and explore its applicability in more complex scenarios. To this end, we make the following contributions: We propose LFP, a novel paradigm for gradient-free training of DNNs. We demonstrate the performance of LFP theoretically via a convergence proof, as well as empirically on several different models and datasets. We investigate properties and potential applications of LFP beyond gradient-based training. Specifically, we look into the application of LFP to step-function-activated SNNs and of LFP as an efficient (in the sense of relevant parameters) transfer learning method. To restrict the scope of this work, we select the well understood task of classification, using DNN models with one output neuron per class and no Batchnorm  layers. This fits well to our choice of feedback function (cf. Section 2.2) and to the implicit assumption of LRP with 0 as a reference value that is inherited by LFP as well. While more general formulations of LRP exist , exploring these for LFP is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: method for optimizing complex machine learning (ML) models, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).
