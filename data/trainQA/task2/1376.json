      "content": "Paper Title: On the eigenvector bias of Fourier feature networks: From regression to solving multi-scale PDEs with physics-informed neural networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we present a brief overview of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) [ref]4. In general, we consider partial differential equations of the following form where 𝒩​[⋅]𝒩delimited-[]⋅\\mathcal{N}[\\cdot] is a differential operator and ℬ​[⋅]ℬdelimited-[]⋅\\mathcal{B}[\\cdot] corresponds to Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, or periodic boundary conditions. In addition, 𝒖:Ω¯→ℝ:𝒖→¯Ωℝ\\bm{u}:\\overline{\\Omega}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} describes the unknown latent quantity of interest that is governed by the PDE system of equation 2.1. For\ntime-dependent problems, we consider time t𝑡t as a special component of 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x}, and ΩΩ\\Omega then also contains the temporal domain. In that case, initial conditions can be simply treated as a special type of boundary condition on the spatio-temporal domain. Following the original work of Raissi et al. [ref]4, we proceed by approximating 𝒖​(𝒙)𝒖𝒙\\bm{u}(\\bm{x}) by a deep neural network 𝒖𝜽​(𝒙)subscript𝒖𝜽𝒙\\bm{u}_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\bm{x}), where 𝜽𝜽\\bm{\\theta} denotes all tunable parameters of the network (e.g., weights and biases). Then, a physics-informed model can be trained by minimizing the following composite loss function where and Nrsubscript𝑁𝑟N_{r} and Nbsubscript𝑁𝑏N_{b} denote the batch-sizes of training data {𝒙bi,𝒈​(𝒙bi)}i=1Nbsuperscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝒙𝑏𝑖𝒈superscriptsubscript𝒙𝑏𝑖𝑖1subscript𝑁𝑏\\{\\bm{x}_{b}^{i},\\bm{g}(\\bm{x}_{b}^{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N_{b}} and {𝒙ri,𝒇​(𝒙ri)}i=1Nrsuperscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝒙𝑟𝑖𝒇superscriptsubscript𝒙𝑟𝑖𝑖1subscript𝑁𝑟\\{\\bm{x}_{r}^{i},\\bm{f}(\\bm{x}_{r}^{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N_{r}}, respectively, which are randomly sampled in the computational domain at each iteration of a gradient descent algorithm. Notice that all required gradients with respect to input variables 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x} or parameters 𝜽𝜽\\bm{\\theta} can be efficiently computed via automatic differentiation .\nMoreover, the parameters {λr,λb}subscript𝜆𝑟subscript𝜆𝑏\\left\\{\\lambda_{r},\\lambda_{b}\\right\\} correspond to weight coefficients in the loss function that can effectively assign a different learning rate to each individual loss term. These weights may be user-specified or tuned automatically during network training [ref]29 [ref]6. Despite a series of early promising results 2 6 , the original formulation of Raissi et al. [ref]4 often struggles to handle multi-scale problems. As an example, let us consider a simple 1D Poisson’s equation subject to the boundary condition Here the fabricated solution we consider is and f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x) can be derived using equation 2.6. Though this example is simple and pedagogical, it is worth noting that the solution exhibits low frequency in the macro-scale and high frequency in the micro-scale, which resembles many practical scenarios. We represent the unknown solution u​(x)𝑢𝑥u(x) by a 5-layer fully-connected neural network u𝜽​(x)subscript𝑢𝜽𝑥u_{\\bm{\\theta}(x)} with 200 units per hidden layer. The parameters of the network can be learned by minimizing the following loss function where the batch sizes are set to Nb=Nr=128subscript𝑁𝑏subscript𝑁𝑟128N_{b}=N_{r}=128 and all training points {xbi,u​(xbi)}i=1Nbsuperscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑏𝑖𝑢superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑏𝑖𝑖1subscript𝑁𝑏\\{x_{b}^{i},u(x_{b}^{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N_{b}}, {xri,f​(xri)}i=1Nrsuperscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑟𝑖𝑓superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑟𝑖𝑖1subscript𝑁𝑟\\{x_{r}^{i},f(x_{r}^{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N_{r}} are uniformly sampled for the boundary and residual collocation points at each iteration of gradient descent. Figure 1 summarized the results obtained by training the network for 107superscript10710^{7} iterations of gradient descent using the Adam optimizer  with default settings. We observe that the network is incapable of learning the correct solution, even after a million training iterations. In fact, it is not difficult for a conventional fully-connected neural network to approximate that function u𝑢u, given sufficient data inside the computational domain. However, as shown in figure 1, solving high-frequency or multi-scale problems presents great challenges to PINNs. Although there has been recent efforts to elucidate the reasons why PINN models may fail to train [ref]29 [ref]6, a complete understanding of how to quantify and resolve such pathologies is still lacking. In the following sections, we will obtain insights by studying Fourier feature networks through the lens of their neural tangent kernel (NTK), and present a novel methodology to tackle multi-scale problems with PINNs.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: In this section, we present a brief overview of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) [ref]4.
