We say a real-valued random variable X𝑋X is σ𝜎\\sigma-sub-Gaussian if it its mean is zero and for all ε∈ℝ𝜀ℝ\\varepsilon\\in\\mathbb{R} we have At every round t𝑡t, the learner selects xt∈Dsubscript𝑥𝑡𝐷x_{t}\\in D and observes the noisy function evaluation where we assume {ηt}t=1Tsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝜂𝑡𝑡1𝑇\\{\\eta_{t}\\}_{t=1}^{T} are σ𝜎\\sigma-sub-Gaussian random variables that are independent over time steps. Such assumptions on the noise variables are frequently used in bandit optimization. Typically, in kernelized bandits, we assume that unknown f∈ℱk​(𝒟;B)={f∈ℋk​(𝒟):‖f‖k≤B}𝑓subscriptℱ𝑘𝒟𝐵conditional-set𝑓subscriptℋ𝑘𝒟subscriptnorm𝑓𝑘𝐵f\\in{\\cal F}_{k}({\\cal D};B)=\\{f\\in{\\cal H}_{k}({\\cal D}):\\|f\\|_{k}\\leq B\\}, where ℋk​(𝒟)subscriptℋ𝑘𝒟{\\cal H}_{k}({\\cal D}) is the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of functions associated with the given positive-definite kernel function. Typically, the learner knows ℱk​(𝒟;B)subscriptℱ𝑘𝒟𝐵{\\cal F}_{k}({\\cal D};B), meaning that both k​(⋅,⋅)𝑘⋅⋅k(\\cdot,\\cdot) and B𝐵B are considered as input to the learner’s algorithm. Example kernel functions.\nWe outline some commonly used kernel functions k:𝒟×𝒟→ℝ:𝑘→𝒟𝒟ℝk:{\\cal D}\\times{\\cal D}\\to\\mathbb{R}, that we also consider: Linear kernel: klin​(x,x′)=xT​x′subscript𝑘lin𝑥superscript𝑥′superscript𝑥𝑇superscript𝑥′k_{\\text{lin}}(x,x^{\\prime})=x^{T}x^{\\prime}, Squared exponential kernel: kSE​(x,x′)=exp⁡(−‖x−x′‖22​l2)subscript𝑘SE𝑥superscript𝑥′superscriptnorm𝑥superscript𝑥′22superscript𝑙2k_{\\text{SE}}(x,x^{\\prime})=\\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{\\|x-x^{\\prime}\\|^{2}}{2l^{2}}\\right), Matérn kernel: kMat​(x,x′)=21−νΓ​(ν)​(2​ν​‖x−x′‖l)​Jν​(2​ν​‖x−x′‖l)subscript𝑘Mat𝑥superscript𝑥′superscript21𝜈Γ𝜈2𝜈norm𝑥superscript𝑥′𝑙subscript𝐽𝜈2𝜈norm𝑥superscript𝑥′𝑙k_{\\text{Mat}}(x,x^{\\prime})=\\frac{2^{1-\\nu}}{\\Gamma(\\nu)}\\Big{(}\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\nu}\\|x-x^{\\prime}\\|}{l}\\Big{)}J_{\\nu}\\Big{(}\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\nu}\\|x-x^{\\prime}\\|}{l}\\Big{)}, where l𝑙l denotes the length-scale hyperparameter, ν>0𝜈0\\nu>0 is an additional hyperparameter that dictates the smoothness, and J​(ν)𝐽𝜈J(\\nu) and Γ​(ν)Γ𝜈\\Gamma(\\nu) denote the modified Bessel function and the Gamma function, respectively [ref]34. Maximum information gain.\nMaximum information gain is a kernel-dependent quantity that measures the complexity of the given function class. It has first been introduced in , and since then it has been used in numerous works on Gaussian process bandits. Typically, the upper regret bounds in Gaussian process bandits are expressed in terms of this complexity measure. It represents the maximum amount of information that a set of noisy observations can reveal about the unknown f𝑓f that is sampled from a zero-mean Gaussian process with kernel k𝑘k, i.e., f∼G​P​(0,k)similar-to𝑓𝐺𝑃0𝑘f\\sim GP(0,k). More precisely, for a set of sampling points S⊂𝒟𝑆𝒟S\\subset{\\cal D}, we use fSsubscript𝑓𝑆f_{S} to denote a random vector [f​(x)]x∈Ssubscriptdelimited-[]𝑓𝑥𝑥𝑆[f(x)]_{x\\in S}, and YSsubscript𝑌𝑆Y_{S} to denote the corresponding noisy observations obtained as YS=fS+ηSsubscript𝑌𝑆subscript𝑓𝑆subscript𝜂𝑆Y_{S}=f_{S}+\\eta_{S}, where ηS∼𝒩​(0,λ​I)similar-tosubscript𝜂𝑆𝒩0𝜆𝐼\\eta_{S}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\lambda I). We note that under this setup after observing YSsubscript𝑌𝑆Y_{S}, the posterior distribution of f𝑓f is a Gaussian process with posterior mean and variance that correspond to Eq. 8 and Eq. 9. The maximum information gain (about f𝑓f) after observing t𝑡t noisy samples is defined as (see ): where I​(⋅,⋅)𝐼⋅⋅I(\\cdot,\\cdot) denotes the mutual information between random variables, |⋅||\\cdot| is used to denote a matrix determinant, and Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t} is a kernel matrix [k​(xs,xs′)]s,s′≤t∈ℝt×tsubscriptdelimited-[]𝑘subscript𝑥𝑠subscript𝑥superscript𝑠′𝑠superscript𝑠′𝑡superscriptℝ𝑡𝑡[k(x_{s},x_{s^{\\prime}})]_{s,s^{\\prime}\\leq t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{t\\times t}. Under the previous setup (GP prior and Gaussian likelihood), the maximum information gain can be expressed in terms of predictive GP variances: The proof of this claim can be found in [40, Lemma 5.3]. It also allows us to rewrite Eq. (12) from Lemma 1 in the following frequently used form: Next, we outline an important relation (due to ) frequently used to relate the sum of GP predictive standard deviations with the maximum information gain. We use the formulation that follows from Lemma 4 in : Consider some kernel k:𝒟×𝒟→ℝ:𝑘→𝒟𝒟ℝk:{\\cal D}\\times{\\cal D}\\to\\mathbb{R} such that k​(x,x)≤1𝑘𝑥𝑥1k(x,x)\\leq 1 for every x∈𝒟𝑥𝒟x\\in{\\cal D}, and let f∼G​P​(0,k)similar-to𝑓𝐺𝑃0𝑘f\\sim GP(0,k) be a sample from a zero-mean GP with the corresponding kernel function. Then for any set of queried points {x1,…,xt}subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑡\\{x_{1},\\dots,x_{t}\\} and λ>0𝜆0\\lambda>0, it holds that Finally, we outline bounds on γt​(k,𝒟)subscript𝛾𝑡𝑘𝒟\\gamma_{t}(k,{\\cal D}) for commonly used kernels as provided in . An important observation is that the maximum information gain is sublinear in terms of number of samples t𝑡t for these kernels. Let d∈ℕ𝑑ℕd\\in\\mathbb{N} and 𝒟⊂ℝd𝒟superscriptℝ𝑑{\\cal D}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{d} be a compact and convex set. Consider a kernel k:𝒟×𝒟→ℝ:𝑘→𝒟𝒟ℝk:{\\cal D}\\times{\\cal D}\\to\\mathbb{R} such that k​(x,x)≤1𝑘𝑥𝑥1k(x,x)\\leq 1 for every x∈𝒟𝑥𝒟x\\in{\\cal D}, and let f∼G​P​(0,k)similar-to𝑓𝐺𝑃0𝑘f\\sim GP(0,k) be a sample from a zero-mean Gaussian Process (supported on 𝒟𝒟{\\cal D}) with the corresponding kernel function. Then in case of Linear kernel: γt​(klin,𝒟)=O​(d​log⁡t)subscript𝛾𝑡subscript𝑘lin𝒟𝑂𝑑𝑡\\gamma_{t}(k_{\\text{lin}},{\\cal D})=O(d\\log t), Squared exponential kernel: γt​(kSE,𝒟)=O​((log⁡t)d+1)subscript𝛾𝑡subscript𝑘SE𝒟𝑂superscript𝑡𝑑1\\gamma_{t}(k_{\\text{SE}},{\\cal D})=O((\\log t)^{d+1}), Matérn kernel: γt​(kMat,𝒟)=O​(td​(d+1)/(2​ν+d​(d+1))​log⁡t)subscript𝛾𝑡subscript𝑘Mat𝒟𝑂superscript𝑡𝑑𝑑12𝜈𝑑𝑑1𝑡\\gamma_{t}(k_{\\text{Mat}},{\\cal D})=O(t^{d(d+1)/(2\\nu+d(d+1))}\\log t). We also note that the previous rates in case of the Matérn kernel have been recently improved to:\nO​(td2​ν+d​(log⁡t)2​ν2​ν+d)𝑂superscript𝑡𝑑2𝜈𝑑superscript𝑡2𝜈2𝜈𝑑O\\Big{(}t^{\\tfrac{d}{2\\nu+d}}(\\log t)^{\\tfrac{2\\nu}{2\\nu+d}}\\Big{)} in .\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: ν>0𝜈0\\nu>0 is an additional hyperparameter that dictates the smoothness, and J​(ν)𝐽𝜈J(\\nu) and Γ​(ν)Γ𝜈\\Gamma(\\nu) denote the modified Bessel function and the Gamma function, respectively [ref]34.
