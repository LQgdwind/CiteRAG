Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Open-Vocabulary DETR with Conditional Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets.\nWe evaluate our approach on two standard open-vocabulary detection benchmarks modified from LVIS [ref]14 and COCO 2 respectively. LVIS [ref]14 contains 100K images with 1,203 classes. The classes are divided into three groups, namely frequent, common and rare, based on the number of training images. Following ViLD [ref]13, we treat 337 rare classes as novel classes and use only the frequent and common classes for training. The COCO 2 dataset is a widely-used benchmark for object detection, which consists of 808080 classes. Following OVR-CNN , we divide the classes in COCO into 48 base categories and 17 novel categories, while removing 15 categories without a synset in the WordNet hierarchy. The training set is the same as the full COCO but only images containing at least one base class are used. We refer to these two benchmarks as OV-LVIS and OV-COCO hereafter. Evaluation Metrics.\nFor OV-LVIS, we report the mask mAP for rare, common and frequent classes, denoted by APrmsubscriptsuperscriptAPmr\\rm{AP^{m}_{r}}, APcmsubscriptsuperscriptAPmc\\rm{AP^{m}_{c}} and APfmsubscriptsuperscriptAPmf\\rm{AP^{m}_{f}}. The rare classes are treated as novel classes (APnovelmsubscriptsuperscriptAPmnovel\\rm{AP^{m}_{novel}}). The symbol APmsuperscriptAPm\\rm{AP^{m}} denotes to the mAP of all the classes. For OV-COCO, we follow previous work that only reports the AP50bsuperscriptAP50b\\rm{AP50^{b}} metric, which means the box mAP at IoU threshold 0.50.50.5. Extension for Instance Segmentation.\nFor OV-LVIS, instance segmentation results are needed for the evaluation process. Although DETR  and its follow-ups  4 are developed for the object detection task, they can also be extended to the instance segmentation task. We follow DETR  to add an external class-agnostic segmentation head to solve the instance segmentation task. The segmentation head employs the fully convolutional network (FCN 3) structure, which takes features extracted from the Transformer decoder as input and produces segmentation masks. Implementation Details.\nOur model is based on Deformable DETR .\nFollowing ViLD [ref]13, we also use the open-source CLIP model 7 based on ViT-B/32 for extracting text and image embeddings.\nPlease refer to our supplementary material for more training details.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: Datasets.\nWe evaluate our approach on two standard open-vocabulary detection benchmarks modified from LVIS [ref]14 and COCO 2 respectively. LVIS [ref]14 contains 100K images with 1,203 classes. The classes are divided into three groups, namely frequent, common and rare, based on the number of training\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
