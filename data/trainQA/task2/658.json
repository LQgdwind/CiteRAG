Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Instead of checking consistency for a single execution of a shared-memory implementation, there were efforts in verifying that all executions are consistent under a certain memory model.\nAlur et al. show in  that for \\SC\\SC\\SC, the problem is undecidable.\nThis also holds for \\ComplexityFont​C​C\\ComplexityFont𝐶𝐶\\ComplexityFont{CC} .\nUnder data-independence, the problem becomes decidable for \\ComplexityFont​C​C\\ComplexityFont𝐶𝐶\\ComplexityFont{CC} .\nVerifying Eventual Consistency  was shown to be decidable by Bouajjani et al. in .\nThere has also been work on other verification problems like reachability and robustness.\nAtig et al. show in  that, under \\ComplexityFont​T​S​O\\ComplexityFont𝑇𝑆𝑂\\ComplexityFont{TSO} and \\ComplexityFont​P​S​O\\ComplexityFont𝑃𝑆𝑂\\ComplexityFont{PSO}, reachability is decidable.\nIn [ref]10 the authors extend their results and present a relaxation of \\ComplexityFont​T​S​O\\ComplexityFont𝑇𝑆𝑂\\ComplexityFont{TSO} with decidable reachability problem.\nRobustness against \\ComplexityFont​T​S​O\\ComplexityFont𝑇𝑆𝑂\\ComplexityFont{TSO} was considered in  and shown to be \\PSPACE\\PSPACE\\PSPACE-complete.\nThis also holds for \\ComplexityFont​P​O​W​E​R\\ComplexityFont𝑃𝑂𝑊𝐸𝑅\\ComplexityFont{POWER}  , as shown in , and for partitioned global address spaces . Parameterized complexity has been applied to other verification problems as well.\nBiswas and Enea  study the complexity of transactional consistency and obtain an \\FPT\\FPT\\FPT-algorithm in the size and the width of a history.\nThis also yields an algorithm for the serializability problem, proven to be \\NP\\NP\\NP-hard by Papadimitriou  in 1979.\nA fine-grained algorithm for serializability under \\ComplexityFont​T​S​O\\ComplexityFont𝑇𝑆𝑂\\ComplexityFont{TSO} was given in .\nThe authors of  present an \\FPT\\FPT\\FPT-algorithm for predicting atomicity violations as well as an intractability result.\nThe parameterized complexity of data race prediction was considered in .\nFine-grained complexity analyses were conducted for reachability under bounded context switching on finite-state systems [ref]18, and for reachability and liveness on parameterized systems  .\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: et al. show in  that, under \\ComplexityFont​T​S​O\\ComplexityFont𝑇𝑆𝑂\\ComplexityFont{TSO} and \\ComplexityFont​P​S​O\\ComplexityFont𝑃𝑆𝑂\\ComplexityFont{PSO}, reachability is decidable.\nIn [ref]10 the authors extend their results and present a relaxation of \\ComplexityFont​T​S​O\\ComplexityFont𝑇𝑆𝑂\\ComplexityFont{TSO} with decidable reachability problem.\nRobustness against\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
