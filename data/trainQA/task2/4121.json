      "content": "Paper Title: SI𝜒O: Smoothing Inference with Twisted Objectives\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGood references for SMC include Doucet and Johansen [ref]1, Naesseth et al. , and Del Moral  which provides a theoretical treatment of a generalization of SMC called Feynman-Kac formulae. Pitt and Shephard [ref]17 introduced the auxiliary particle filter, an early smoothing SMC method which constructs an estimate of the one-step backwards message p𝜽​(𝐲t+1∣𝐱t)subscript𝑝𝜽conditionalsubscript𝐲𝑡1subscript𝐱𝑡p_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{y}_{t+1}\\mid\\mathbf{x}_{t}) using simulations from the model. Smoothing SMC in general is discussed thoroughly in Briers et al.  and Del Moral et al. 4. Later, Whiteley and Lee [ref]13 introduced twisted particle filters, which perform SMC on a twisted model that approximates the smoothing distributions by multiplying the model’s filtering distributions with “twisting” functions. Our work extends the theoretical framework in Whiteley and Lee [ref]13 by proposing practical and effective methods for learning parametric twisting functions. To make smoothing SMC computationally tractable, fixed-lag techniques use information from only a fixed window of future observations, as introduced in Clapp and Godsill  and surveyed in Lin et al. 0. For example, Park and Ionides 5 use simulations from the model to estimate fixed-lag twisting functions and Doucet et al. 6 sample blocks of latents conditional on their observations via various Monte Carlo methods. These methods suffer from computational complexity that grows with the window size, and fail to take advantage of all future observations. Other methods use twisting functions which depend on all observations. Most similar to our approach are Guarniero et al.  and Heng et al. 7 which learn parametric twists using a Bellman-type decomposition of the lookahead distributions p​(𝐲t+1:T∣𝐱t)𝑝conditionalsubscript𝐲:𝑡1𝑇subscript𝐱𝑡p(\\mathbf{y}_{t+1:T}\\mid\\mathbf{x}_{t}) in terms of the same distributions one step into the future. Del Moral and Murray 8 use Gaussian processes to approximate the twists, Lindsten et al.  use traditional graphical model techniques such as loopy belief propagation and expectation propagation, and Ruiz and Kappen 9 use optimal control techniques. None of these approaches consider model learning and their twist learning techniques are highly specialized to their problem settings. Fitting model parameters via stochastic gradient ascent on an evidence lower bound (ELBO) was introduced in Ranganath et al. 0, Hoffman et al. 1, Kingma and Welling 2, and later generalized to the Monte Carlo objectives (MCO) framework by Mnih and Rezende . Since then, works have considered optimizing lower bounds defined by the normalizing constant estimators from multiple importance sampling 3, rejection sampling and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo , filtering SMC   , and smoothing SMC  4 5. The prior work on smoothing SMC used an objective defined by forward filtering backwards smoothing  which suffers from the same particle degeneracy issues as filtering SMC and cannot become tight. Kim et al. 6 optimize the importance weighted autoencoder (IWAE) bound 3 using a gradient estimator that incorporates a baseline derived from future likelihood estimates, but do not use SMC or resampling in their bound.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Good references for SMC include Doucet and Johansen [ref]1, Naesseth et al. , and Del Moral  which provides a theoretical treatment of a generalization of SMC called Feynman-Kac formulae.
