      "content": "Paper Title: Faked Speech Detection with Zero Knowledge\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe output of voice impersonation must be convincing, both to humans and machines, in being naturally uttered by the target speaker.\nThis requires mimicking the signal qualities, like pitch, as well as the speaking style of the target .\nIn this age of deep fakes, seamless machine-based impersonation is a reality.\nThe method in  relies on using a neural network-based framework that uses Griffin-Lim method  which can learn to mimic a person’s voice and style and then produce a voice that mimics the persons’ voice. Voice cloning technologies can learn the characteristics of the target speaker and utilize prepared models to mimic a person’s voice from only a few sound samples.\nThe developments in cloned speech generation technologies can create a fake machine speech that is similar to the real voice of the target speaker .\nThere have been research efforts focusing on how to detect this kind of audio and how to enable systems to recognize them, such as the anti-Spoofing works [ref]29   . In this context, the ASVspoof series of challenges are an important mention in dealing with spoofing in automatic speaker verification systems. ASVspoof baseline systems are based in modern deep learning architectures and having deep- and handcrafted features. although related, the problem we are dealing here is yet to be taken up in these challenges, to the best of our knowledge at least.\nVoice disguise refers to altering one’s voice deliberately to conceal one’s identity.\nImpersonation is concerned with a voice disguise aimed at sounding like another person who exists .\nWhile impersonation may be easily detectable, it is a hard task to trace back a disguised voice, of presumably a person who never existed, to the original speaker.\nA study in  reaffirms the importance of phonetically trained specialists in subjective voice disguise identification after an untrained audience failed to identify known speakers in case of falsetto disguise.\nAnother study along similar lines , reports that naive listeners can better distinguish between an impersonator and a target rather than identifying voice disguise.\nReaders are recommended a review of similar studies .\nThe system proposed in  relies on the magnetic field produced by loudspeakers to detect machine-based voice impersonation attacks.\nThe reported results in combination with a contemporary system against human impersonation attacks, are incredible, viz. 100%percent100100\\% accuracy and 0%percent00\\% Equal Error Rate (EER) . Even an extensive work, like , does little to touch the subject of impersonation, especially the human mimicry, i.e., mimicking someone’s voice to attribute to him/her something which was neither ever said nor uttered in one go.\nHere, we are talking of an audio that has never been tampered; other than the usual pre-processing, filtering and compression etc.\nAs of datasets, there exist quite a few forensic databases , but even these don’t touch the aspect of impersonation in the form of human mimicking. Human attempted voice impersonation (or voice imitation) is mimicry of another speaker’s voice characteristics and speech behavior  without relying on computer related spoofing; a fact ruling out the quest for technical artefacts in the suspected audio.\nThe focus is mainly on voice timbre and prosody of the target .\nBeing a “technically valid speech”, mimic attacks may not be detectable, especially in Automatic Speaker verification (ASV) environments.\nA professional impersonator is likely to target all lexical, prosodic  and idiosyncratic aspects of the subject speaker; exaggeration may be inevitable .\nThe study reported in  states that speech patterns, pitch contours, formant contours, and spectrograms etc. from speech signals of maternal twins are at least almost identical, if not exactly the same.\nHence even a mere verification may be a difficult task in the case of identical twins.\nTherefore, more exploration of discriminating speech features is needed, as suggested about half a century ago . Even a paternal twin may be hand, as in a recent incident related to phone banking  , a non-identical twin mimic the voice of his brother, a BBC reporter, to deceive the system .\nThe literature contains many such incident of fraud . The problem of human mimicry may be the earliest one addressed in the literature and can be traced back to as far as 1970’s.\nFor example, an old study  employed four professional experts to identify voice disguises from the spectrogram of two sentences uttered by a sample of 30 subjects (15 reference + 15 matching) in undisguised as well as five disguised modes.\nEven without any disguise, the experts could go as far as 56%percent5656\\% accuracy in matching the speakers.\nTo classify speakers, another early days’ simulation in  uses such parameters as fundamental frequency, word duration, vowel/nasal consonant spectra, voice onset time and glottal source spectrum slope.\nThe parameters were estimated at manually identified locations from speech events within utterances.\nA later study , on a professional impersonator and one of his voice impersonations, showed that the impersonator not only focused on the voice of the target, but also matched the speech style and intonation pattern as well as the accent and pronunciation peculiar to the target. A voice impersonator may be identified by finding the features a typical impersonator chooses to exploit and what he ignores in the targeted voice, as had been tried in  whereby two professional and one amateur impersonators were asked to mimic the same target in order to observe whether they have chosen the same features to change with the same degree of success.\nThe work described in  used professional impersonators111One interesting aspect of mimicry detection, in addition to employing professionals, could be to employ twins , at least of reference to mimic a person’s voice to identify the acoustic characteristics that each impersonator attempts to change to match the target.\nA comparison of the impersonated voices and the actual voice of the impersonator affirmed the importance of the pitch frequencies and vocal/glottal acoustics of the target speaker and impersonator.\nA similar work in , involving three voice impersonators with nine distinct voice identities, recorded synchronous speech and Electro Glotto Graphic (EGG) signals.\nAn analysis based on the EGG and the vocal traces - including speech rate, vowel formant frequencies, and timing characteristics of the vocal folds - led to the conclusion that each impersonator modulated every parameter during imitation.\nIn addition, vowel pronunciations were observed to have a high dependency on the vowel category. More recently, the method in  uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to create speaker models based on the prosodic features (intonation, loudness, pitch dependent rhythm, intensity and mimic duration in addition to jitter, shimmer, energy change, and various duration measures) from the original speech of celebrities and professional mimicry artists; as well as the original speech of the latter.\nA related effort  uses Bayesian interpretation in combination with SVM.\nA similar prosodic features-based method , analyzes the ability of impersonators to estimate the prosody of their target voices while using both intra-gender and cross-gender speeches.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: to the real voice of the target speaker .\nThere have been research efforts focusing on how to detect this kind of audio and how to enable systems to recognize them, such as the anti-Spoofing works [ref]29   .
