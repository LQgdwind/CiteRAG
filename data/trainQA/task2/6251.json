      "content": "Paper Title: Toward Understanding Why Adam Converges Faster Than SGD for Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we describe the setting of our full experiments.\nWe demonstrate our findings with two types of experiments, as described in Sections 3 and 4.\nWe explore several different tasks and settings and show our results hold in various setting.\nFurther discussions of the results are in Section C.3 Optimization algorithms. We select a variety of optimization algorithms.\nThe algorithms all uses momentum in their update steps for a fair comparison.\nThe baseline algorithm is SGD momentum, which we compare the sharpness of other algorithms with.\nFor the class of adaptive algorithms, we choose Adam , Adafactor , and Lion [ref]7.\nAdam is the most popular adaptive algorithm, and Adafactor and Lion both claim to be the state-of-the-art optimization algorithm on some specific tasks  [ref]7.\nWe also include signSGD due to its similarity with the Lion optimizer [ref]7 and having probably the simplist form of adaptive algorithm.\nNote that signSGD is just SGD with clipping threshold 100%.\nTo show that the improvement in directional sharpness and convergence speed is more related to coordinate-wise scaling than weight-matrix-wise scaling, we also design an algorithm which we call normalized SGD, that normalizes the square of Frobenius norm of each weight matrix to be proportional to the size of the matrix.\nBy comparing normalized SGD with SGD clipping, we can see the importance of coordinate-wise scaling in adaptive algorithms and clipping. Tasks.\nWe run our experiments on two tasks, including machine translation and autoregressive language modeling, which are two popular tasks in language processing and can be solved efficiently with transformers.\nFor machine translation, we train a small t5 [ref]39 model on the opus books English-French dataset .\nFor autoregressive, we train a GPT-Neo [ref]3  model on the stack dataset  for Python code generation.\nThe code generation task is slightly different from natural language tasks such as machine translation since it deals with programming languages.\nWe will show that most of our results still holds in the setting, suggesting that the observation is more related to properties of the transformer architectures. Directional Sharpness and Landscape.\nWe compute the directional sharpness of a variety of optimization algorithms, including SGD, normalized SGD, signSGD, Adam , Adafactor , and Lion [ref]7, and visualize the corresponding loss landscape direction, under different local geometry.\nWe show that SGD has bad sharpness under all of the settings, regardless of the task, model, or local geometry.\nIn addition, we demonstrate clipping can always improve the directional sharpness of optimization algorithms, and often result in better local loss reduction in the update direction. Global Convergence.\nWe also implement clipping algorithms and use them to train different models, and demonstrate that clipping algorithms converge faster in practice.\nThe result matches the goodness of the direction as measured by the landscape visualization and directional sharpness, that algorithms with better directional sharpness and better local loss reduction in the update direction in the SGD geometry generally converges faster.\nWe conclude that the performance of optimization algorithms in local geometry can be a good indicator of speed of global convergence.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: for a fair comparison.\nThe baseline algorithm is SGD momentum, which we compare the sharpness of other algorithms with.\nFor the class of adaptive algorithms, we choose Adam , Adafactor , and Lion [ref]7.\nAdam is the most popular adaptive algorithm, and Adafactor and Lion both claim to be the state-of-the-art optimization algorithm on some specific tasks  [ref]7.\nWe also include signSGD due to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
