      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network for Traffic Prediction: Benchmark and Solution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare DGCRN\nwith traditional statistic-based methods and recently proposed GNN based models for traffic prediction task, which can fully reflect the latest progress in this field. The baselines are introduced as follows: HA: Historical Average (HA) method is used to predict the future speed using the average value of historical speed data. VAR¬†: Vector Auto-Regression (VAR) can be used for time series forecasting. SVR: Support Vector Regression (SVR) is another classical time series analysis model which uses linear support vector machine for the regression task. FNN: This is a feed forward neural network for time series prediction. ARIMAkal¬†[ref]27: This is a traditional and widely used method in time series prediction, which integrates auto-regression with moving average model. FC-LSTM¬†: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network with fully connected hidden units is a well-known network architecture which is powerful in capturing sequential dependency. DCRNN¬†[ref]5: This is a GNN-based and RNN-based model which integrates GRU with dual directional diffusion convolution. STGCN¬†: It is a GNN-based and CNN-based model which incorporates graph convolutions with 1D convolutions Graph WaveNet¬†: It is a GNN-based and CNN-based model which integrates diffusion graph convolutions with gated 1D dilated convolutions and propose self-adaptive adjacency matrix. ST-MetaNet¬†: It is a GNN-based and RNN-based model which employs meta learning to generate parameters of GAT and GRU. AGCRN¬†: This is a GNN-based and RNN-based model which employs adaptive graph and integrates GRU with graph convolutions with node adaptive parameter learning. GMAN¬†: This is an attention-based model with spatial, temporal and transform attentions. MTGNN¬†[ref]14: It is a GNN-based and CNN-based model which employs adaptive graph, mix-hop propagation layers and dilated inception layers to capture spatio-temporal correlations. For all the baselines, we use the default settings from their original proposals. The performances of all methods are evaluated by three commonly used metrics in traffic prediction, including (1) Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which is a basic metric to reflect the actual situation of the prediction accuracy. (2) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which is more sensitive to abnormal value, and (3) Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) which can eliminate the influence of data unit to some extent, defined as follows: where x=x1,‚ãØ,xnùë•subscriptùë•1‚ãØsubscriptùë•ùëõ{x}=x_{1},\\cdots,x_{n} denotes the ground truth, x^=x^1,‚ãØ,x^n^ùë•subscript^ùë•1‚ãØsubscript^ùë•ùëõ\\hat{{x}}=\\hat{x}_{1},\\cdots,\\hat{x}_{n} represents the predicted values, and Œ©Œ©\\Omega denotes the indices of observed samples. In our experiments, the |Œ©|Œ©|{\\Omega}| is 12.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: is another classical time series analysis model which uses linear support vector machine for the regression task.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
