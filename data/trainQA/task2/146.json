      "content": "Paper Title: Sketchformer: Transformer-based Representation for Sketched Structure\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate the performance of the proposed transformer embeddings for three common tasks; sketch classification, sketch reconstruction and interpolation, and sketch based image retrieval (SBIR). We compare against two baseline sketch embeddings for encoding stroke sequences; SketchRNN [ref]12 (also used for search in ) and LiveSketch . We evaluate using sketches from QuickDraw50M [ref]19, and a large corpus of photos (Stock10M). QuickDraw50M [ref]19 comprises over 50M sketches of 345 object categories, crowd-sourced within a gamified context that encouraged casual sketches drawn at speed. Sketches are often messy and complex in their structure, consistent with tasks such as SBIR. Quickdraw50M captures sketches as stroke sequences, in contrast to earlier raster-based and\nless category-diverse datasets such as TUBerlin/Sketchy. We sample 2.5M sketches randomly with even class distribution from the public Quickdraw50M training partition to create training set (QD-2.5M) and use the public test partition of QuickDraw50M (QD-862k) comprising 2.5k Ã—345=862k\\times 345=862k sketches to evaluate our trained models. For SBIR and interpolation experiments we sort QD-862k by sequence length, and sample three datasets (QD345-S, QD345-M, QD345-L) at centiles 10, 50 and 90 respectively to create a set of short, medium and long stroke sequences. Each of these three datasets samples one sketch per class at random from the centile yielding three evaluation sets of 345 sketches. We sampled an additional query set QD345-Q for use in sketch search experiments, using the same 345 sketches as LiveSketch . The median stroke lengths of QD345-S, QD345-M, QD345-L are 30, 47 and 75 strokes respectively (after simplification via RDP [ref]10). Stock67M is a diverse, unannotated corpus of photos\nused in prior SBIR work  to evaluate large-scale SBIR retrieval performance. We sample 10M of these images at random for our search corpus (Stock10M).\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: sketch classification, sketch reconstruction and interpolation, and sketch based image retrieval (SBIR).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
