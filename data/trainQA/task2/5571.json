      "content": "Paper Title: Generative Models of Huge Objects\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn many of the applications of generative models, such as modeling the Web or a social network, the objects being modeled are huge. In this paper, we aim at a systematic theory of efficiently learning and implementing huge generative models. Our models will generate a distribution of objects satisfying some global properties that are indistinguishable from a fixed combinatorial object. Such a theory presents non-trivial challenges that do not manifest themselves neither when generating huge pseudorandom objects, nor in generative models of polynomial-size objects. Concretely, we assume that we have access to an object B∗superscript𝐵B^{*} with exponential size. For example, B∗superscript𝐵B^{*} could be a function with an exponentially large domain, or a graph with exponentially many vertices and edges. We are most interested in the case where the object B∗superscript𝐵B^{*} is too large to read or process as a whole, and we have to access it by sampling: for example, when B∗superscript𝐵B^{*} represents a function f:X→{0,1}:𝑓→𝑋01f:X\\to\\{0,1\\} with |X|𝑋|X| being exponentially large, we may access B∗superscript𝐵B^{*} by asking for random pairs (x,f​(x))∈X×{0,1}𝑥𝑓𝑥𝑋01(x,f(x))\\in X\\times\\{0,1\\} (sample access) or random inputs x∈X𝑥𝑋x\\in X conditioned on f​(x)=1𝑓𝑥1f(x)=1 (support access). Given access to the huge object B∗superscript𝐵B^{*}, our goal is to create a generative model M𝑀M for B∗superscript𝐵B^{*}. Here, our model M𝑀M represents a distribution over objects, and we want to ensure that this distribution is indistinguishable from B∗superscript𝐵B^{*} to all distinguishers D𝐷D in a class 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}. Specifically, if we use DB∈{“accept”,“reject”}superscript𝐷𝐵“accept”“reject”D^{B}\\in\\{\\textup{``accept''},\\textup{``reject''}\\} to denote the output of distinguisher D𝐷D given sample/support access to object B𝐵B, our indistinguishability requirement is that for every D∈𝒟𝐷𝒟D\\in\\mathcal{D}, We aim for building an efficient learner L𝐿L that can output a model M𝑀M satisfying the indistinguishability requirement above when given sample/support access to the true object B∗superscript𝐵B^{*}.\nWhen B∗superscript𝐵B^{*} is exponentially large (which is the case we are interested in), the output model M𝑀M also needs to generate exponentially large objects, and thus we cannot expect an efficient learner to directly output M𝑀M.\nInstead, we want our learner to output an efficient implementation of M𝑀M, which, roughly speaking, is a randomized algorithm that can efficiently provide sample/support access to objects drawn from M𝑀M (Definitions 2.9 and 2.10). Our goal of learning a generative model M𝑀M indistinguishable from the true object B∗superscript𝐵B^{*} is analogous to the problem addressed by Goldreich, Goldwasser and Nussboim [GGN10] in the area of pseudorandomness.\nThey study the problem of efficiently implementing a distribution of huge objects, satisfying some global properties, that are indistinguishable from the uniform distribution of such objects.\nFollow-up works of [GGN10] such as [NNT05, NN07] study efficient implementations that are indistinguishable from certain distributions of huge random graphs.\nAll these works aim to achieve indistinguishability from a known distribution of objects, whereas in our problem of learning a generative model, we assume that\nthe true object B∗superscript𝐵B^{*} is initially unknown, and to collect information about B∗superscript𝐵B^{*}, we additionally need a learner L𝐿L that can use sample/support access to B∗superscript𝐵B^{*} to efficiently construct an implementation of an indistinguishable model. Beyond indistinguishability, we also aim to achieve the notion of truthfulness introduced in [GGN10]. To demonstrate this notion, consider pseudorandom permutations fs:{0,1}n↦{0,1}n:subscript𝑓𝑠maps-tosuperscript01𝑛superscript01𝑛f_{s}:\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\mapsto\\{0,1\\}^{n} [LR88]. A distribution of permutations is pseudorandom if it is indistinguishable from the uniform distribution of permutations. It should be noted that a pseudorandom {0,1}n↦{0,1}nmaps-tosuperscript01𝑛superscript01𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\mapsto\\{0,1\\}^{n} function [GGM86] is also indistinguishable from a random permutation over {0,1}nsuperscript01𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{n} (as long as the number of queries are sufficiently smaller than 2n/2superscript2𝑛22^{n/2}). Nevertheless, insisting that the pseudorandom objects satisfy the global condition of being a permutation is critical in the applications of pseudorandom permutations. This motivates the distinction of [GGN10] between indistinguishability (that the pseudorandom objects are indistinguishable from a uniform object to a class of distinguishers) and truthfulness which is a global property that needs to hold exactly or approximately in a statistical sense. In our setup, a generative model M𝑀M is truthful if every object B𝐵B drawn from the distribution represented by M𝑀M satisfies a certain global property. For example, when the true object B∗superscript𝐵B^{*} is a function f∗:X→{0,1}:superscript𝑓→𝑋01f^{*}:X\\to\\{0,1\\} with support size |{x∈X:f∗​(x)=1}|conditional-set𝑥𝑋superscript𝑓𝑥1|\\{x\\in X:f^{*}(x)=1\\}| being k𝑘k, a truthful requirement on a generative model M𝑀M for B∗superscript𝐵B^{*} may restrict M𝑀M to always generate functions with support size k𝑘k. The study of implementing huge pseudorandom objects [NR02, GGN10, NNT05, NN07] has pseudorandom functions and permutations as vital building blocks.\nBesides these building blocks, our techniques for learning generative models of huge objects also come from connections to the regularity lemma and especially the work of Trevisan, Tulsiani and Vadhan [TTV09]. In [TTV09], they construct an efficiently-implementable function f:X↦ [ref]1:𝑓maps-to𝑋01f:X\\mapsto [ref]1 which is indistinguishable from some f∗:X↦ [ref]1:superscript𝑓maps-to𝑋01f^{*}:X\\mapsto [ref]1 to a family of distinguishers represented by functions g:X↦ [ref]1:𝑔maps-to𝑋01g:X\\mapsto [ref]1. Indistinguishability here means that |𝔼⁡[f​(x)​g​(x)]−𝔼⁡[f∗​(x)​g​(x)]|𝔼𝑓𝑥𝑔𝑥𝔼superscript𝑓𝑥𝑔𝑥|\\operatorname{\\mathbb{E}}[f(x)g(x)]-\\operatorname{\\mathbb{E}}[f^{*}(x)g(x)]| is smaller than some error parameter ε𝜀\\varepsilon.\nAfter [TTV09], the problem of creating indistinguishable functions and its applications to cryptography are further studied in [VZ13, JP14, Skó16a, Skó16b, Skó17, CCL18].\nThese works assume that the true function f∗superscript𝑓f^{*} is known and they do not explicitly deal with the problem of learning f∗superscript𝑓f^{*}, but the corresponding learning task has been studied in the algorithmic fairness literature through the notions of multi-accuracy, multi-calibration, and outcome indistinguishability [HJKRR18, KGZ19, DKR+21, GKSZ22, DLLT23].\nWhen applying techniques from these works to solve some problems in our setting, we need to deal with additional challenges such as the truthfulness requirement that we want our generative model to satisfy.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: objects also come from connections to the regularity lemma and especially the work of Trevisan, Tulsiani and Vadhan [TTV09].
