      "content": "Paper Title: Salient Feature Extractor for Adversarial Defense on Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning enjoys great popularity in both academic and industrial application for its superior performance, ranging from the field of image classification to object detection, natural language processing and bioinformatics analysis.\nHowever, deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, imperceptible to humans, easily lead to misclassification, as proved by Szegedy . In the process of independent decision-making, the vulnerability of deep models to adversarial examples has posed non-negligible threat to data and information security. This problem, furthermore, impedes the application in mission-critical areas, such as face recognition and auto pilot. Therefore, it is crucial to study defense against adversarial attacks and further improve the robustness of deep models. In the field of image classification, numerous adversarial attacks have been proposed to discover vulnerabilities of DNNs. Based on the knowledge degree of the target model, adversarial attacks are categorized into white-box attacks and black-box attacks. One of the typical white-box attacks is gradient-based attack, e.g., fast gradient sign method (FGSM) [ref]11, basic iterative method (BIM) 2, momentum-based iterative FGSM (MI-FGSM)  and decision boundary-based attack DeepFool . Those attacks require less time to compute perturbations but a thorough knowledge of the targeted model should be given in advance. Black-box attacks are mainly decision-based and score-based, such as the zeroth-order optimization attack (ZOO) , point wise attack (PWA)  and local search attack (LSA) . Only knowing the output of the targeted model, black-box attacks can still be carried out, usually with a larger size of perturbation. Meanwhile, the profound implications of DNN’s vulnerability have motivated a wide range of investigations into defense for DNNs. Depending on different defense purposes, they can be categorized as re-identification defense and adversarial detector. Re-identification defenses, known as complete defenses, are now developed along three main directions. Training/input modification includes adversarial training [ref]11 and input pre-processing; model modification includes defense distillation  and reverse cross-entropy loss ; defense of network add-on contains methods based on generative adversarial network(GAN) [ref]10 and autoencoder . Re-identification defense can provide correct class labels of adversarial examples while adversarial detector only determines whether the input is benign or adversarial. The ACT-detector , perturbation detection 7, GAT 1 are three of those available defenses. Another novel angle to study the adversarial example is from MIT , they first claimed that the adversarial example is not a bug, concluding that the existence of adversarial examples arise from the non-robust features learned from the original dataset by the model. They gave interpretation of adversarial example from the machine’s angle instead of man. From that point of view, the adversarial example takes advantage of non-robust feature to fool DNN while the robust feature is still working for man since the adversarial perturbation is imperceptible. Inspired by this, we propose the concepts of salient feature(SF) and trivial feature(TF), then compare visualization of these features for benign and adversarial examples via Grad-CAM , heatmaps on ImageNet VGG19  model shown in Figure1. From red to blue, the weight that the model allocates decreases. By comparing heatmaps, we find that the red area of SF in the benign example is similar to the heatmap of original map, but different from that of the adversarial. Correct labels, consistent with human prediction, can be gained when the model pays attention to SF. On the contrary, misclassification occurs when TF is focused. Since the SF captures the salient features of the adversarial examples, we proposed a novel defense method, salient feature extractor, SFE for short. It extracts and reconstructs SF and TF to defend against adversarial attacks. It has been proved that generative adversarial network (GAN) [ref]10 is a well-designed optimizer on basis of game player. We adopt a coupled GAN model to extract SF and TF respectively. Adversarial examples are distinguished by calculating difference between SF and TF. Consequently, correct classification labels are obtained by recognition of reconstructed and strengthened SF in adversarial examples. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We propose concepts of salient features(SF) and trivial features(TF). Observation is obtained that the correct classification of examples attributes to the model’s concentration on SF. Moreover, consistent with human semantics, SF and TF could be adopted for detection and defense strategy. We design a feature extraction method of SF and TF, namely SFE, which can effectively achieve the detection of benign and adversarial examples by feature separation and calculation of distribution difference. By reconstructing SF and TF of adversarial examples on the basis of coupled GAN framework, both detection and re-identification defense of adversarial examples can be completed. Extensive experiments are implemented on various models and datasets to demonstrate the detection and defense effect of SFE, including within and among-class distance, transferability, parameter sensitivity and time complexity. Besides, interpretable defense via visualization is provided for better understanding. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.\nThe related works are discussed in Section 2, the SFE method and critical techniques are introduced in Section 3. Experiments and analysis are detailed in Section 4 respectively. At last, we conclude limitations and future works.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: target model, adversarial attacks are categorized into white-box attacks and black-box attacks.
