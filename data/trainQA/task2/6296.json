      "content": "Paper Title: On the Design Fundamentals of Diffusion Models: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGeneralizing diffusion models to a wide range of applications requires adaptations according to data properties [ref]30. Data in tasks such as text generation and speech generation are represented with different types . Furthermore, the data manifold itself is different in some areas like scientific computing [ref]84. Latent features are also important in large scale tasks for more compacted representations [ref]85. Different data types require adaptations of the transition chain. Essentially, different data types have varying characteristics. For instance, categorical data are represented as discrete distributions, while continuous data are modeled as arbitrary values  . Although both discrete and continuous data are compatible with diffusion models, their generic pipeline has an inductive bias of continuous data . The inherent data difference requires effort to adapt the transition chain to improve the modeling accuracy for different data types  . Some efforts focus on converting discrete data to continuous representations before they are calculated  . This is straightforward but accuracy may be lost. Others concentrate on re-designing the transitions with discrete distributions    such as the Bernoulli distribution. Despite their superior performance, their derivations sometimes are task-specific and expensive to be adapted to other tasks. Data manifolds also demand modifications of the transition chain in the generic pipeline. Apart from the commonly used Euclidean manifold, the Riemannian manifold is also explored for handling some scientific data . Riemannian manifold-based diffusion models are motivated by their ability to preserve geometric structures of the underlying data, which are important in many scientific fields . Riemannian manifold-based diffusion models have shown promising results in various applications such as medical imaging and neuroscience . Latent representation is another feasible choice for transitions, as illustrated in Figure 7. Despite positive generation results achieved in the original space, the high dimensionality of data often leads to considerable computational cost and redundancy . Empirical evidence has shown that some transitions in diffusion models are responsible for learning latent representations, which are usually in low-dimensional space  and semantically meaningful  . They implicitly learn semantically meaningful features . Mapping to latent space also enables multi-modality . A pre-trained encoder is developed to map x0subscriptùë•0x_{0} into latent code z0subscriptùëß0z_{0} ahead of diffusion models and its corresponding decoder maps the generated latent code z0subscriptùëß0z_{0} back to x0subscriptùë•0x_{0} . Usually latent features are more densely represented by filtering less relevant information. Therefore, all the capacity of diffusion models are encouraged to learn more abstract, semantical relationships effectively [ref]85.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Generalizing diffusion models to a wide range of applications requires adaptations according to data properties [ref]30.
