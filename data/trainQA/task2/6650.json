      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Directly-Trained Spiking Neural Networks for Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo explore the potential of our EMS-ResNet to enable deep training, we analyze the feasibility from a theoretical perspective. According to Gradient Norm Equality (GNE) theory , our EMS-ResNet could avoid exploding and vanishing gradients. Consider a neural network that can be represented as a series of blocks as and the j𝑗jth block’s\njacobian matrix is denoted as Jjsubscript𝐽𝑗J_{j}. If ∀j;ϕ​(Jj​Jj𝖳)≈1for-all𝑗italic-ϕsubscript𝐽𝑗superscriptsubscript𝐽𝑗𝖳1\\forall j;\\phi(J_{j}J_{j}^{\\mathsf{T}})\\approx 1 and\nφ​(Jj​Jj𝖳)≈0𝜑subscript𝐽𝑗superscriptsubscript𝐽𝑗𝖳0\\varphi(J_{j}J_{j}^{\\mathsf{T}})\\approx 0 , the network achieves “Block Dynamical\nIsometry” and can avoid gradient vanishing or explosion. Here, Jjsubscript𝐽𝑗{J}_{j} means the Jacobian matrix of the block j𝑗j, j𝑗j is the index of the corresponding block. ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi means the expectation of the normalized trace. φ𝜑\\varphi means ϕ​(𝑨2)−ϕ2​(𝑨)italic-ϕsuperscript𝑨2superscriptitalic-ϕ2𝑨\\phi(\\boldsymbol{A}^{2})-\\phi^{2}(\\boldsymbol{A}). Briefly, the theory ensures the gradient of the network will not decrease to 00 or explode to ∞\\infty since every block have ϕ​(Jj​Jj𝖳)≈1italic-ϕsubscript𝐽𝑗superscriptsubscript𝐽𝑗𝖳1\\phi(J_{j}J_{j}^{\\mathsf{T}})\\approx 1. And φ​(Jj​Jj𝖳)≈0𝜑subscript𝐽𝑗superscriptsubscript𝐽𝑗𝖳0\\varphi(J_{j}J_{j}^{\\mathsf{T}})\\approx 0 makes sure that accident situation won’t happen. And in most cases[ref]48[ref]17, ϕ​(Jj​Jj𝖳)≈1italic-ϕsubscript𝐽𝑗superscriptsubscript𝐽𝑗𝖳1\\phi(J_{j}J_{j}^{\\mathsf{T}})\\approx 1 is enough for avoiding gradient vanish or exploding. Detailed description of the notation and the theory are in . (General Linear Transform) Let 𝐟​(𝐱)𝐟𝐱\\boldsymbol{f}(\\boldsymbol{x}) be a transform whose Jacobian matrix is 𝐉𝐉\\boldsymbol{J}. f is called general linear transform when it satisfies: According to the random matrix and mean field theory , the data flow propagating in the network can be regarded as random variables. Thus, 𝒙𝒙\\boldsymbol{x} is considered as a random variable. We denote the notation E​[‖𝒙‖22len⁡(𝒙)]𝐸delimited-[]superscriptsubscriptnorm𝒙22len𝒙E\\left[\\frac{\\|\\boldsymbol{x}\\|_{2}^{2}}{\\operatorname{len}(\\boldsymbol{x})}\\right] as the 2t​hsuperscript2𝑡ℎ2^{th} moment of input element. The definition is useful for analysis the gradient. Because once the output of an EMS-Block is normalized by the BN layer, the 2t​hsuperscript2𝑡ℎ2^{th} moment E​[‖𝒇​(𝒙)‖22len⁡(𝒇​(𝒙))]𝐸delimited-[]superscriptsubscriptnorm𝒇𝒙22len𝒇𝒙E\\left[\\frac{\\|\\boldsymbol{f}(\\boldsymbol{x})\\|_{2}^{2}}{\\operatorname{len}(\\boldsymbol{f}(\\boldsymbol{x}))}\\right] which we denote as α2subscript𝛼2\\alpha_{2} is clear. (Theorem 4.1 in )\nGiven 𝐉:=∏j=L1𝐉jassign𝐉superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑗𝐿1subscript𝐉𝑗\\boldsymbol{J}:=\\prod_{j=L}^{1}\\boldsymbol{J}_{j}, where {𝐉j∈ℝmj×mj−1}subscript𝐉𝑗superscriptℝsubscript𝑚𝑗subscript𝑚𝑗1\\{\\boldsymbol{J}_{j}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m_{j}\\times m_{j-1}}\\} is a series of independent random matrices. If (∏j=L1𝐉j)​(∏j=L1𝐉j)Tsuperscriptsubscriptproduct𝑗𝐿1subscript𝐉𝑗superscriptsuperscriptsubscriptproduct𝑗𝐿1subscript𝐉𝑗𝑇(\\prod_{j=L}^{1}\\boldsymbol{J}_{j})(\\prod_{j=L}^{1}\\boldsymbol{J}_{j})^{T} is at least the 1s​tsuperscript1𝑠𝑡1^{st} moment unitarily invariant, we have (Theorem 4.2 in ) Given 𝐉:=∏j=L1𝐉jassign𝐉superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑗𝐿1subscript𝐉𝑗\\boldsymbol{J}:=\\prod_{j=L}^{1}\\boldsymbol{J}_{j}, where {𝐉j∈ℝmj×mj−1}subscript𝐉𝑗superscriptℝsubscript𝑚𝑗subscript𝑚𝑗1\\{\\boldsymbol{J}_{j}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m_{j}\\times m_{j-1}}\\} is a series of independent random matrices. If at most one matrix in 𝐉jsubscript𝐉𝑗\\boldsymbol{J}_{j} is not a central matrix, we have The multiplication and addition principle provide us a technique for analysising the network with serial connections and parallel connections. Discussion for General Linear Transform. Since the Jacobian matrix of pooling can be regarded as a matrix 𝑱𝑱\\boldsymbol{J} that the element of matrix [𝑱]i​k∈{0,1}subscriptdelimited-[]𝑱𝑖𝑘01\\left[\\boldsymbol{J}\\right]_{ik}\\in\\{0,1\\}, 00 for the element not chosen while 111 for element chosen. Thus the pooling layer can be regarded as a general linear transform. Similarly, the UpSampling layer in the detection head is also a generalized linear transformation. Concatenation is general linear transform too, because the function of 𝒇​(𝒙)=[𝒙,𝒇​(𝒙)~]𝒇𝒙𝒙~𝒇𝒙\\boldsymbol{f(x)}=[\\boldsymbol{x},\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{f(x)}}] can be expressed as 𝒇​(𝒙)=[𝑰𝑱~]​𝒙𝒇𝒙𝑰~𝑱𝒙\\boldsymbol{f(x)}=[\\boldsymbol{I}\\quad\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{J}}]\\boldsymbol{x} if the function 𝒇~~𝒇\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{f}} is general linear transform. Since the BN and CONV layers are already discussed in , so we only need to assume that the LIF layer satisfy general linear transformation, which is already used in proof by [ref]48. Since the EMS-ResNet is a serial of basic EMS-Blocks and MS-Blocks, we can separately analysis those blocks and multiply them together. For EMS-Block1 and EMS-Block2, the Jacobian matrix of the block can be represented as ϕ​(𝐉𝐣​𝐉𝐣𝐓)=2α2j−1italic-ϕsubscript𝐉𝐣superscriptsubscript𝐉𝐣𝐓2superscriptsubscript𝛼2𝑗1\\phi(\\boldsymbol{J_{j}J_{j}^{T}})=\\frac{2}{\\alpha_{2}^{j-1}}. It is detailed in Supplementary Material Proof A.1 and Proof A.2.\n∎ For the EMS-ResNet, ϕ​(𝐉​𝐉𝐓)≈1italic-ϕ𝐉superscript𝐉𝐓1\\phi(\\boldsymbol{JJ^{T}})\\approx 1 can be satisfied by control the 2t​hsuperscript2𝑡ℎ2^{th} moment of the input. It is detailed in Supplementary Material Proof A.3.\n∎ Discussion about the proposition. According to , ϕ​(𝑱​𝑱T)≈1italic-ϕ𝑱superscript𝑱𝑇1\\phi(\\boldsymbol{J}\\boldsymbol{J}^{T})\\approx 1 is the formal expression for GNE which ensures gradient vanishing or explosion will not happen. However, it is enough for solving gradient problems by just avoiding the exponential increase or decrease . In our backbone, the MS-Block, the only factor to evoke exponential increase of gradient, whose increasing is stopped by the interspersing of EMS-Blocks. Even if the initialize of BN do not satisfy the constant for ϕ​(𝑱​𝑱T)≈1italic-ϕ𝑱superscript𝑱𝑇1\\phi(\\boldsymbol{J}\\boldsymbol{J}^{T})\\approx 1, the gradient of each block will not increase as the network goes deeper. Briefly, we improve the property of network at a structural level by our EMS-Blocks.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: 1. And φ​(Jj​Jj𝖳)≈0𝜑subscript𝐽𝑗superscriptsubscript𝐽𝑗𝖳0\\varphi(J_{j}J_{j}^{\\mathsf{T}})\\approx 0 makes sure that accident situation won’t happen. And in most cases[ref]48[ref]17, ϕ​(Jj​Jj𝖳)≈1italic-ϕsubscript𝐽𝑗superscriptsubscript𝐽𝑗𝖳1\\phi(J_{j}J_{j}^{\\mathsf{T}})\\approx 1 is enough for avoiding gradient vanish or exploding.
