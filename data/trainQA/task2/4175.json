      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforcement Learning-enhanced Shared-account Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare RL-ISN with the following baseline methods from five categories: traditional, shared-account, cross-domain, sequential, and shared-account cross-domain sequential recommendations. 1) Traditional recommendations: Item-KNN¬†[ref]15: This method recommends the items that are similar to the actual item, and defines the item-to-item similarity as the cosine similarity between the vector of their sequences. BPR-MF¬†[ref]15: This is a traditional matrix factorization-based method. We apply it for SR via representing the sequence feature vector by averaging the feature vectors of items that had occurred in the sequence so far. NCF¬†[ref]50: This method treats users as sequences, and learns their embeddings by a MLP-based collaborative filtering mechanism. Light-GCN¬†: This is a GCN-based collaborative filtering method, which learns sequence and item ebmeddings through aggregating the representations of their neighbors. 2) Shared-account recommendations: VUI-KNN¬†: This method is proposed for IP-TV recommendation task that first cuts the logs of each account into slices via dividing a day into three time periods; each log slice is assumed to be generated by a virtual user. Then, latent users are further formed by merging virtual users according to their cosine similarities. After that, the User-KNN method is applied to make recommendations for the latent users.\n Note that, we do not compare with the shared-account recommendation methods¬†   that need extra information, such as explicit ratings or textual descriptions for items, which are not available in our datasets. 3) Cross-domain recommendations: NCF-MLP++¬†[ref]50: This method is based on the traditional NCF, which makes recommendations on a single domain. We use it for CR by sharing the collaborative filtering in different domains. Conet¬†[ref]5: This is a neural transfer model for CR, which proposes a neural collaborative filtering network for information sharing. 4) Sequential recommendations: GRU4REC¬†[ref]15: This is one of the most representative sequential recommenders that exploits GRU to encode sequence and optimizes a ranking-based loss function. HGRU4REC¬†: This method further improves GRU4REC via taking user‚Äôs identity and auxiliary features into sequential recommendation. NAIS¬†: This is an item-to-item collaborative filtering algorithm that uses an attention mechanism to distinguish the importance of different historical courses. But it is proposed for traditional SR, and has limited ability to deal with the cross-domain and shared-account challenges. 5) Shared-account cross-domain sequential recommendations: œÄùúã\\pi-net¬†: This is a state-of-the-art recommendation method for SCSR, which devises a gating mechanism to transfer the information to other domains and addresses the shared-account challenge via learning user-specific representations. PSJ-net¬†: This method further improves œÄùúã\\pi-net by changing the splitting and joining methods of learning the cross-domain representations. DA-GCN¬†: This is another recent state-of-the-art recommendation method for SCSR, which leverages a domain-aware graph convolutional network to model the cross-domain knowledge. For the shared-account challenge, this work also learns user-specific node representations as its solution. ISN-RL: This is a variant of RL-ISN that removes the fine tuning process within it, that is, removing the RL-based domain filter component. This is to demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL-based knowledge transfer process.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: baseline methods from five categories: traditional, shared-account, cross-domain, sequential, and shared-account cross-domain sequential recommendations. 1) Traditional recommendations: Item-KNN¬†[ref]15: This method recommends the items that are similar to the actual item, and defines the item-to-item similarity as the cosine similarity between the vector of their sequences.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
