      "content": "Paper Title: Hypernetworks build Implicit Neural Representations of Sounds\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe field of Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) is a rapidly growing area of research, which aims to obtain functional, coordinate-based representations of multimedia signals through the use of neural networks. These representations are decoupled from the spatial resolution, so the signal can be resampled at any arbitrary frequency without incurring additional memory storage requirements. Applications of INRs include super-resolution [ref]30 [ref]22, compression [ref]30 [ref]22, 3D rendering , and missing data imputation . Furthermore, INRs can be used to synthesise data , and they show promise as an alternative to the traditional feature extraction techniques used in neural networks [ref]8. INRs are a promising research direction in audio processing, yet so far their applications in this domain remain limited. As the size of INR networks can be significantly smaller than the size of the represented signal, they can be used as a compression method . They also provide an alternative to super-resolution algorithms such as ProGAN , which often require hand-crafting complex architectures for selected resolution. In contrast, in INRs the signal resolution is given by the granularity of input coordinates, so a single network represents the signal for any resolution we might require while remaining constant in size. Moreover, as   show that INRs can be used as features in other algorithms, this representation can be an alternative for current deep audio processing models that primarily operate on features obtained from mel spectrograms or raw audio waves . In practice, architectures typically used for INRs struggle with modeling high frequencies inherent in audio signals  and require training a new model for every incoming data point, which is wasteful and greatly reduces their applicability. This issue is usually addressed by obtaining generalizable INRs through meta-learning methods, such as hypernetworks  – models that produce the weights for other models. The hypernetwork framework can be leveraged to obtain generalizable INRs for a variety of data types, including images [ref]30 [ref]22 , point clouds [ref]22   3D objects  , videos [ref]22 and time series . However, obtaining generalizable INRs for audio signals remains an unsolved task due to the high dimensionality and variance of this type of data, which makes the standard methods for this task insufficient. In our work, we propose a method that learns a general recipe for creating INRs for arbitrary audio samples not present in the training dataset. We adapt the hypernetwork framework for sound processing by introducing a domain-specific loss function and hypernetwork weight initialization. Additionally, we investigate various variants of the hypernetwork framework in order to achieve improved compression while maintaining audio quality. To our knowledge, our method, named HyperSound, is the first application of hypernetwork-based INR generation to the audio domain. The main contributions of our work are: We introduce HyperSound, to our knowledge the first INR method for audio processing that builds functional representations of unseen audio signals, which eliminates the need of retraining the INR for each new data point. We show a successful adaptation of the hypernetwork paradigm to the audio processing through domain-specific modifications such as the spectral loss function. We empirically evaluate various approaches of using hypernetworks to build INRs for audio generation, e.g. by leveraging SIREN architecture or Fourier mapping.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: from the spatial resolution, so the signal can be resampled at any arbitrary frequency without incurring additional memory storage requirements.
