      "content": "Paper Title: XIRL: Cross-embodiment Inverse Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe ability to learn new tasks from third-person demonstrations holds the potential to enable robots to leverage the vast quantities of tutorial videos that can be gleaned from the world-wide web (e.g., YouTube videos). However, distilling diverse and unstructured videos into motor skills with vision-based policies can be daunting – as the videos themselves are often not only captured from different camera viewpoints in different environments, but also with different experts that may use different tools, objects, or strategies to perform the same task. Perhaps most critically, there often exists a clear embodiment gap between the human expert demonstrator, and the robot hardware that executes the learned policies. One approach to close this gap is to learn a mapping between the human and robot embodiment , which is a non-trivial intermediate problem in itself. Despite considerable progress in learning policies with paired observations and actions (e.g., collected via teleoperation) [ref]2 , much less work has been done in getting robots to learn policies from tasks defined only by third-person observations of demonstrations [ref]4  [ref]6.\nThis is a surprisingly challenging problem, as different embodiments are likely to use unique strategies that suit them and allow them to make progress on a given task. For example, if asked to “place five pens into a cup”, a human hand is likely to scoop up all pens before slipping them into the cup, whereas a two-fingered gripper might instead need to pick and place each pen individually. Both strategies complete the task, but generate different state-action trajectories. In this setting, it may be difficult to acquire labeled frame-to-frame correspondences between expert demonstration videos and learned embodiments [ref]6, particularly across a multitude of embodiments or experts. The approach we investigate instead is whether we can successfully learn tasks through a learned notion of task progress that is invariant to the embodiment performing the task. In this work, we propose to enable agents to imitate video demonstrations of experts – including ones with different embodiments – by using a task-specific, embodiment-invariant reward formulation trained via temporal cycle-consistency (TCC) . We demonstrate how we can leverage an encoder trained with TCC to define dense rewards for downstream reinforcement learning (RL) policies via simple distances in the learned embedding space.\nSimulated experiments across four different embodiments show that these learned rewards are capable of generalizing to new embodiments, enabling unseen agents to learn the task via reinforcement, and surprisingly in some cases, exceeding the sample efficiency of the same agent learned with ground truth sparse rewards. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for learning robot policies using human demonstrations on the State Pusher environment from [ref]6, where our reward is first learned on real-world human demonstrations, then used to teach a Sawyer arm how to perform the task in simulation. Our contributions are as follows: (i) We introduce Cross-embodiment Inverse Reinforcement Learning (XIRL), an effective, label-free framework for tackling cross-embodiment visual imitation learning. Our core contribution is to use self-supervised learning on third-person demonstration videos to define dense reward functions amenable for downstream reinforcement learning policies, (ii) Along with XIRL, we release a cross-embodiment imitation learning benchmark, X-MAGICAL, which features multiple simulated agents with different embodiments performing the same manipulation task, including one thousand expert demonstrations for each agent, (iii) We show that XIRL significantly outperforms alternative methods on both the X-MAGICAL benchmark and the human-to-robot transfer benchmark from [ref]6, and discuss our observations, which point to interesting areas for future research, (iv) Finally, we introduce a real-world dataset, X-REAL (Cross-embodiment Real demonstrations), of a manipulation task performed with nine different embodiments, which can be used to evaluate cross-embodiment reward learning methods111For more details regarding X-REAL, please see Appendix C..\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: robot embodiment , which is a non-trivial intermediate problem in itself.
