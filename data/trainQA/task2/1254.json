      "content": "Paper Title: From Goals, Waypoints & Paths To Long Term Human Trajectory Forecasting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe use a total of three datasets to study Y-net’s performance – the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD) [ref]32 (for both short & long term), the Intersection Drone Dataset (InD) [ref]5 (for long term only) and the ETH  / UCY  forecasting benchmark (for short term only). Stanford Drone Dataset: We benchmark our proposed model on the popular Stanford drone dataset\n[ref]32 where several recently proposed methods have improved state-of-the-art performance significantly in the past few years . The dataset is comprised of more than 11,0001100011,000 unique pedestrians across 202020 top-down scenes captured on the Stanford university campus in bird’s eye view using a flying drone. It has over 40,0004000040,000 agent-scene interactions and has enjoyed very popular usage in trajectory prediction literature in the short temporal horizon setting.\nFor short term prediction, we follow the well-established preprocessed data and splits from the TrajNet benchmark  setup used by [ref]14   , sampling at FPS=2.5FPS2.5\\texttt{FPS}=2.5 yielding an input sequence of length np=8subscript𝑛𝑝8n_{p}=8 (3.23.23.2 seconds) and output of length nf=12subscript𝑛𝑓12n_{f}=12 (4.84.84.8 seconds). In our proposed long term setting, we split the raw data of Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD) in the same fashion as proposed in TrajNet benchmark  evaluating on the same scenes, all of which are not seen during training. The raw data is recorded in FPS=30FPS30\\texttt{FPS}=30 and we first downsample the data to our proposed FPS=1FPS1\\texttt{FPS}=1, thus yielding a np=5subscript𝑛𝑝5n_{p}=5 for tf=5subscript𝑡𝑓5t_{f}=5 seconds in the past and predicting upto one minute into the future. We use the middle point of the raw bounding boxes to get the same coordinate representation as the preprocessed short term setting. The data contains various types of agent beyond pedestrians (bicyclists, skateboarders, cars, buses, and golf carts), we filter out all non-pedestrians and short trajectories below np+nfsubscript𝑛𝑝subscript𝑛𝑓n_{p}+n_{f} out. As the raw data is noisy and contains temporal discontinuities, we split the trajectories at those discontinuities. We use a sliding window approach without overlap to split up long trajectories, resulting in our final dataset. After those steps, the dataset contains 1502 trajectories for np=5subscript𝑛𝑝5n_{p}=5 and nf=30subscript𝑛𝑓30n_{f}=30. Further, we label the scenes with semantic segmentation maps consisting of the following Nc=5subscript𝑁𝑐5N_{c}=5 “stuff” classes  depending on the affordability of class to pedestrians: pavement, terrain, structure, tree and road. Intersection Drone Dataset: We propose to use the Intersection drone dataset [ref]5 for benchmarking trajectory forecasting in long horizon settings. The dataset comprises over 101010 hours of measurements over 444 distinct intersection in an urban environment. We use similar steps for the Intersection Drone Dataset as for SDD. To evaluate Y-net and the baselines performance on unseen scenes during training, we only use location ID 4 during testing. The raw video and detection are in FPS=25FPS25\\texttt{FPS}=25, and again, we downsample the data to FPS=1FPS1\\texttt{FPS}=1. We then filter out non-pedestrians and short trajectories and use a sliding window approach without overlap to split long trajectories. Since the data lies in world coordinates, we convert it into pixel coordinates by scaling with the provided scale factors from the authors. After the preprocessing steps, inD contains 1,396 long term trajectories with np=5subscript𝑛𝑝5n_{p}=5 and nf=30subscript𝑛𝑓30n_{f}=30. To evaluate performance on unseen environments, we are using location ID 444 only during testing time. The scene is labeled with the same Nc=5subscript𝑁𝑐5N_{c}=5 classes as in SDD. ETH & UCY datasets: The ETH/UCY benchmarks have been widely used for benchmarking trajectory forecasting models in the short horizon setting in the recent years . Forecasting performance has improved by over ∼64%similar-toabsentpercent64\\sim 64\\% on average, within the last two years itself [ref]14. It comprises of five different scenes all of which report position in world coordinates (in meters). We follow the leave one out validation strategy as outlines in prior works [ref]14   . We use the preprocessed data from [ref]14 111https://github.com/agrimgupta92/sgan, also used by state-of-the-art methods  . Similar to SDD, the frames are sampled at FPS = 2.5 predicting nf=12subscript𝑛𝑓12n_{f}=12 frames, tf=4.8subscript𝑡𝑓4.8t_{f}=4.8 seconds into the future given last np=8subscript𝑛𝑝8n_{p}=8 frames comprising of tp=3.2subscript𝑡𝑝3.2t_{p}=3.2 seconds of the past. Our model represents trajectories as heatmaps and hence needs the coordinates in pixel space. The ETH/UCY data lie in world coordinates. To project the data from meter into pixel space we use the provided homography matrices from the original dataset for the ETH  scenes ETH and HOTEL and create our own homography matrices for the UCY scenes UNIV, ZARA1 and ZARA2. To enable fair comparisons, we convert our predictions back to world coordinates using the inverse homography matrices and calculate our errors with the untouched raw data in world coordinates, to avoid any errors from our projection. For all ETH and & UCY datasets, since the classes of affordances furnished by the surfaces present is small, we use Nc=2subscript𝑁𝑐2N_{c}=2, identifying each pixel as either belonging to class ‘road’ or ‘not road’.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: We use a total of three datasets to study Y-net’s performance – the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD) [ref]32 (for both short & long term), the Intersection Drone Dataset (InD) [ref]5 (for long term only) and the ETH  / UCY  forecasting benchmark (for short term only).
