      "content": "Paper Title: An Efficient and Multi-private Key Secure Aggregation for Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we list the comparison of the privacy and fault tolerance for the state-of-the-art secure aggregation schemes in Table II, where ✓and ✕ denote satisfied and unsatisfied, respectively. Before discussing the comparison result, we would like to briefly introduce these five schemes. Specifically, the schemes  and [ref]30 are designed by the (t,n)𝑡𝑛(t,n)-threshold secret sharing technique, while both the scheme  and our scheme are presented based on the additive homomorphic encryption technique. The scheme [ref]32 is introduced by combining these two techniques, where the (t,n)𝑡𝑛(t,n)-threshold secret sharing technique and the additive homomorphic encryption technique are used for private key distribution and secure additive aggregation, respectively.\nFirst of all, since the main purpose of secure aggregation in federated learning is to protect the local gradient, all schemes naturally meet the confidentiality of individual clients. For three secret sharing-based schemes  and [ref]30, since the (t,n)𝑡𝑛(t,n)-threshold secret sharing technique allows clients to select their own private keys and distribute the shares of the private key to other clients, both schemes meet the properties of no trusted third-party participation and client-defined private key. Besides, as long as receiving t𝑡t encrypted gradients, the aggregated result can be obtained. Thus, neither of the two schemes considers the decryption right of the aggregated result, i.e., anyone who obtains t𝑡t encrypted gradients can recover the aggregated result. As we all know, the (t,n)𝑡𝑛(t,n)-threshold secret sharing-based schemes have to face the trade-off between privacy guarantee against colluding clients (i.e., up to t−1𝑡1t-1 colluding clients) and robustness against dropped clients (i.e., up to N−t𝑁𝑡N-t clients). That is, these schemes increase the privacy guarantee by reducing the robustness against dropped clients and vice versa. For two homomorphic encryption-based schemes  and [ref]32, the scheme  needs to select the private key s​k𝑠𝑘sk shared among all clients, and thus the simplest way is to introduce a trusted third party to complete. The scheme  needs to select a pair of public and private keys shared among all clients, and thus the simplest way is to introduce a trusted third party to complete. The system initialization of scheme [ref]32 selects a private key s​k𝑠𝑘sk and computes the corresponding N𝑁N shares {s​k1,s​k2,…,s​kN}𝑠subscript𝑘1𝑠subscript𝑘2…𝑠subscript𝑘𝑁\\{sk_{1},sk_{2},\\ldots,sk_{N}\\} by the secret sharing technique, and then distribute s​ki𝑠subscript𝑘𝑖sk_{i} to the client 𝒞isubscript𝒞𝑖\\mathcal{C}_{i}. Obviously, in order to ensure privacy, it has to introduce a trusted third party to complete this operation. As a result, both schemes cannot satisfy the property without trusted third-party participation. Since all clients share a private key, the scheme  cannot satisfy the property of the client-defined private key, while similar to schemes  and [ref]30, the scheme [ref]32 meets this property. In addition, similar to  and [ref]30, the scheme [ref]32 cannot meet the decryption right of the aggregated result, while facing the trade-off between privacy guarantee against colluding clients and robustness against dropped clients. In [ref]32, only clients have the shared private key, and thus only clients can decrypt the aggregation result, which means that the decryption right of the aggregated result is the clients. However, due to the shared private key, [ref]32 cannot tolerate the collusion between the server and clients. That is, as long as one client is compromised, then other clients’ privacy cannot be guaranteed. Fortunately, this scheme can achieve robustness against up to N−2𝑁2N-2 dropped clients, which is more flexible than the other three schemes. As shown in Section 3, the system initialization of our scheme is conducted by the server, and clients are free to choose their own public and private keys. Thus, our scheme satisfies the properties of no trusted third-party participation and client-defined private key. As analyzed in Section 4, the Theorem 2 demonstrates that only the server can decrypt the aggregated result, which implies that the decryption right of the aggregation result is the server. Besides, the Theorems 3 and 4 show that our scheme can resist up to N−2𝑁2N-2 colluded clients and tolerate up to N−2𝑁2N-2 dropped clients. Most notably, compared with the secret sharing-based schemes  [ref]30 [ref]32, our scheme would not face the trade-off between privacy and dropout-tolerant robustness.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Table II, where ✓and ✕ denote satisfied and unsatisfied, respectively.
