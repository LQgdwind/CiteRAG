      "content": "Paper Title: Semi-Supervised Hierarchical Graph Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHierarchical graph representation\nIn the literature, most graph representation methods focus on node-level representations [ref]16 or graph-level representations . One connection between these two kinds of representations is that graph-level representations could be obtained by integrating node-level representations with graph pooling operations, e.g., DIFFPOOL , SAGPool , Attention-Pool [ref]25, MinCut-Pool . Until recently Li et al. [ref]25 firstly formulate the hierarchical graph representation problem and evaluate the effectiveness of hierarchical graph representation on social network classification tasks. Wang et al.  propose a Graph of Graphs Neural Network (GoGNN) and evaluate the proposed GoGNN on entity interaction prediction tasks. Xu et al.  consider city-level graph representations and station-level graph representations to facilitate the air quality forecasting tasks. MIRACLE  utilizes the multi-view contrast learning method to derive hierarchical graph representations and validated its effectiveness on Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI). However, currently there are still several problems within the hierarchical graph representation research. Firstly, most previous works are based on heuristics and lack the theoretical derivations of consistent representations among different levels of the hierarchical graph. Secondly, most works mildly evaluate the expressness of hierarchical graph representations on one task, which makes the whole story less convincing.  Graph mutual information maximization\nThere has been a surging interest in using MI to derive unsupervised graph representations recently. For node-level representations, DGI\n maximizes MI between a graph summery representation and node-level representations and shows that maximizing this kind of MI is equivalent to maximizing the one between the node features and node-level representations. Later, GMI  directly approaches MI computation by comparing the node input and node-level representations, without the overheads of an extra graph summery representation. For graph-level representations, INFOGRAPH [ref]15 and MVGRL  extend the idea of DGI to the field of graph-level representation and contrasts graph-level and subgraph-level representations. Our work advances this research area by proposing hierarchical graph MI and develops an tractable computation method with guarantees. Semi-supervised graph learning\nIn many graph applications, the size of labeled instances is typically limited. In addition to labeled instances, semi-supervised graph learning seeks to leverage unlabeled instances within the network structure to obtain gains in performance. In the literature, semi-supervised graph learning techniques can be generally classified into two groups. The first group is consistency regularization. Representative works include graph Laplacian regularizationÂ , graph contrastive regularization [ref]15. This group aims to learn a representation function that gives consistent predictions for similar data points. The second group is pseudo-label. As the name indicates, this group uses a trained model on the labeled set to produce additional training examples by labeling instances of the unlabeled set . Representative works include ICA , Cautious Iteration . In ICA, for each node a local classifier takes the estimated labels of its neighborhood and its own features as input, and outputs a new pseudo label. The iteration continues until adjacent estimations stabilize. In this work, our proposed method SEAL-CI connects the idea of both consistency regularization and pseudo-label. We show our algorithm has a convergence property w.r.t. the empirical risk.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: Hierarchical graph representation\nIn the literature, most graph representation methods focus on node-level representations [ref]16 or graph-level representations .
