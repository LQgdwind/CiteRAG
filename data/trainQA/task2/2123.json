      "content": "Paper Title: When in Doubt: Neural Non-Parametric Uncertainty Quantification for Epidemic Forecasting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStatistical models for Epidemic Forecasting\nIn the recent years, statistical models have been the most successful in several forecasting targets, as noted in multiyear assessments  . In influenza forecasting, various recent statistical approaches have been proposed.\nOn one hand, we have models designed to model the details on the underlying generative distribution of the data. Among these,  proposed a semiparametric Empirical Bayes framework that constructs a prior of the current season’s epidemic curve from the past seasons and outputs a distribution over epidemic curves.  opts for a non-parametric approach based on kernel density estimation to model the probability distribution of the change between consecutive predictions. Closely related, Gaussian processes have been recently explored for influenza forecasting 4. Other popular methods rely on ensembles of mechanistic and statistical methods  . More recently, the deep learning community has take interest in forecasting influenza [ref]1 2 and COVID-19 . Indeed, deep learning enables to address novel situations where traditional influenza models fail such as adapting a historical influenza model to pandemic . Deep learning is also suitable because it provides the capability of ingesting data from multiple sources, which better informs the model of what is happening on the ground. However, for most of this body of work uncertainty quantification is either non existent or has been explored with simple techniques that lack of proper knowledge representation. Our work aims to close this gap in the literature. Uncertainty Quantification for Deep Learning Recent works have shown that deep neural networks are over-confident in their predictions  [ref]20.\nExisting approaches for uncertainty quantification can be categorized into three lines. The first line is based on\nBayesian Neural Networks (BNNs)   . They are realized by first imposing prior distributions over neural network parameters, then infer parameter posteriors\nand further integrate over them to make predictions. However, as exact inference of parameter posteriors is often\nintractable, approximation methods have also been proposed, including variational inference  , Monte\nCarlo dropout [ref]10 and stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC)  3.\nSuch BNN approximations tend to underestimate the uncertainty . Moreover, specifying parameter priors for BNNs is challenging because the parameters of DNNs are huge in size and uninterpretable  . The second line tries to combine the stochastic processes and DNNs. Neural Process (NP)\n defines a distribution over a global latent variable to capture the functional uncertainty, while Functional neural process (FNP)  use a dependency graph to encode the data correlation uncertainty. However, they are both for the static data. Recently, recurrent neural process (RNP) 1  has been proposed to incorporate RNNs into the NP to capture the ordering sequential information. The third line is based on model ensembling  which trains multiple DNNs with different initializations and use their predictions for uncertainty quantification. However, training multiple DNNs require extensive computing resources.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: for influenza forecasting 4.
