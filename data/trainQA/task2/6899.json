      "content": "Paper Title: Fine-Tuning Llama 2 Large Language Models for Detecting Online Sexual Predatory Chats and Abusive Texts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA comparative summary of the performance metrics for different methods used in detecting online sexual predatory chats is displayed in Table III. The methods are evaluated based on their accuracy, F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1} score, and F0.5subscriptùêπ0.5F_{0.5} score, which provide insights into their effectiveness. The most recent work on this topic, i.e., Borj et al. , achieved a high accuracy of 0.99, an F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1} score of 0.97, and an F0.5subscriptùêπ0.5F_{0.5} score of 0.98 (i.e., values in the row ‚ÄúBorj et al.  ‚Äì Fusion‚Äù in Table III). Our method based on Llama 2 fine-tuning stands out with excellent accuracy with a rounded value of 1.00, and strong F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1} and F0.5subscriptùêπ0.5F_{0.5} scores both of 0.98, although it has to deal with noisier and more imbalanced training and testing datasets compared with the studies in Borj et al. [ref]39 . The performance measures reported in Table III for the method in  (row ‚ÄúBorj et al.  ‚Äì Fusion‚Äù) are the best result of trialling three fusion approaches at both score-level fusion and decision-level fusion (i.e., sum rule, product rule, and majority voting) on outcomes of 16 individual models. The best performance for an individual model is actually that of the combination of SimCSE-Base RoBerta and SVM, which resulted in an accuracy of 0.99, whilst F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1} and F0.5subscriptùêπ0.5F_{0.5} scores are both of 0.96 (i.e., values in the row ‚ÄúBorj et al.  ‚Äì Individual‚Äù in Table III). In contrast to the method in , our approach does not have to exhaust various models or all possible combinations of those models. Based on the power of Llama 2 LLMs, our method is deemed a one-shot approach without an exhaustive search among various options. Another method performing highly in this domain is the work in [ref]39, which achieved an accuracy of 0.99, F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1} and F0.5subscriptùêπ0.5F_{0.5} scores of 0.99 and 0.94, respectively. That study attempted to address the imbalance nature of the PAN12 dataset. Because predatory data are scarcer than the non-predatory data, proposed algorithms normally must deal with the data imbalance. The work in [ref]39 introduced a hybrid sampling and class re-distribution method to augment the data. Along with the augmentation process, the data are also perturbed iteratively to enhance the diversity of classifiers and features in an ensemble approach. Although that method obtained an F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1} score of 0.99, its F0.5subscriptùêπ0.5F_{0.5} score was just 0.94. The lower F0.5subscriptùêπ0.5F_{0.5} score means that more false positives are flagged. This is not ideal in predator detection and less applicable in law enforcement because it may overwhelm the police agents with so many possible suspects rather than help to optimize their time towards the ‚Äúright‚Äù suspect . Compared with results in¬†[ref]39, our method has lower F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1} score (0.98 vs 0.99) but higher accuracy (1.00 vs 0.99), and more importantly, higher F0.5subscriptùêπ0.5F_{0.5} score (0.98 vs 0.94), which is more applicable in the law enforcement practice.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1} and F0.5subscriptùêπ0.5F_{0.5} scores both of 0.98, although it has to deal with noisier and more imbalanced training and testing datasets compared with the studies in Borj et al.
