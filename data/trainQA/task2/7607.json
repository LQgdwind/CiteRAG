      "content": "Paper Title: AO-DETR: Anti-Overlapping DETR for X-Ray Prohibited Items Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSECURITY inspection is one of the most vital and crucial measures to uncovering the potential risks in public spaces, such as airports, train stations, subway stations, and sensitive departments.\nCurrently, a predominant approach to contraband detection involves the acquisition of X-ray images of luggage through security scanning machine, followed by a meticulous manual inspection conducted by security staff who have undergone specialized training.\nWith the advancement of computer vision technology, researchers [ref]1   [ref]4      have attempted to apply models from the general field of image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation to the realm of X-ray prohibited item detection, aiming to assist security staff in auxiliary inspections. However, as shown in Fig. 1, X-ray images exhibit the overlapping phenomenon, leading to the coupling of foreground and background information and issues of edge blurring. This overlapping phenomenon reduces the detection accuracy of general detectors. To enhance the performance of object detectors in X-ray images, two mainstream approaches have been generally utilized, accurate label assignment and multi-stage regression.\nIn the accurate label assignment approach, there are several studies, such as GADet , CLCXray , and Xdet [ref]4, which have introduced precise label assignment methods like IAA, LAreg, and HSS. These methods aim to enhance the capacity of networks to discern features of foreground objects amidst overlapping foreground and background.\nHowever, they all endeavor to directly augment the capacity of the model to discern features of all foreground categories amidst overlapping features, which is evidently too optimistic, given that the nature and pattern of coupling between each category and background differs.\nIn the multi-stage regression approach, in an effort to refine edge localization accuracy, numerous models have adopted a sophisticated multi-stage regression framework. Notable examples of such models include the likes of Faster R-CNN , Cascade R-CNN , and Libra R-CNN .\nHowever, some concepts of them are not fully applicable to the iterative refinements boxes scheme in more advanced detector architectures, i.e., Detection Transformer (DETR) , Deformable DETR , and DINO [ref]17. In this paper, we try to improve the anti-overlapping capability of the detector without changing the architecture of model DINO [ref]17 and without adding any computational complexity.\nIn addition, to pursue the optimal performance in X-ray image prohibited item detection field, we introduce a novel object detection model named Anti-Overlapping DETR (AO-DETR), based on DINO, which is the SOTA DETR-like model in natural image object detection field. Specifically, to alleviate the adverse effects caused by the ambiguity of category semantics in object queries due to the overlapping of foreground and background in X-ray images, as illustrated in Fig 2(b), we propose a category-specific one-to-one assignment strategy (CSA).\nThrough CSA, the category-specific object queries will be stably assigned to ground truth labels and reference boxes of the specific category of prohibited items, enabling it to specialize in extracting feature of specific category of prohibited items from overlapping foreground and background.\nIn addition, to mitigate the blurred boundary problem caused by overlapping phenomena, after conducting a detailed analysis of why look forward twice (LFT) is more suitable for precise boundary localization than Look Forward Once (LFO), we propose the Look Forward Densely (LFD) scheme, which can localize the edges of foreground objects more accurately.\nLFD is capable of transmitting gradients densely to multiple decoder layers, allowing low-level decoder layers to provide more reliable reference boxes to deformable attention in high-level decoder layers. This helps high-level decoder layers focus on learning how to predict accurate location information from blurry edges.\n To prove the efficiency of our proposed methods, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the\nPIXray dataset and OPIXray dataset. The evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed model is superior to the state-of-the-art object detector. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We propose a powerful end-to-end object detector for overlapping phenomena in X-ray images, AO-DETR. To our knowledge, this is the first DETR-like model in the field of prohibited item detection. Experimental results show that our model achieved the best performance on multiple datasets. We propose a CSA strategy, which enhances the anti-overlapping feature extraction capability for specific category foregrounds by constraining the object classes assigned to category-specific queries during the training phase. The proposed LFD scheme improves the accuracy of reference boxes predicted by mid-level and high-level decoder layers through dense gradient transmission, ultimately enhancing the perception ability of blurry edges of models. The remainder of this paper is as follows. Initially, Section II provides a review of the relevant methods. This is followed by Section III, where we describe our proposed method in detail. Section IV then presents and discusses the results of our experiments. The paper concludes with Section V, summarizing our key findings and observations.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: scanning machine, followed by a meticulous manual inspection conducted by security staff who have undergone specialized training.\nWith the advancement of computer vision technology, researchers [ref]1   [ref]4      have attempted to apply models from the general field of image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation to the realm of X-ray prohibited item detection, aiming\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
