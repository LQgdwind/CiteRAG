      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Transformer GANs for Graph-Constrained House Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerative Adversarial Networks\n[ref]12 have been widely used for image generation [ref]19   .\nThe vanilla GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator.\nThe generator aims to synthesize photorealistic images from a noise vector, while the discriminator aims to distinguish between real and generated samples.\nTo create user-specific images, the conditional GAN (CGAN)  was proposed.\nA CGAN combines a vanilla GAN and external information, such as class labels , text descriptions   , object keypoints , human skeletons , semantic maps   , edge maps , or attention maps .\nThis paper mainly focuses on the challenging graph-constrained generation task, which aims to transfer an input graph to a realistic house. Graph-Constrained Layout Generation\nhas been a focus of research recently   3 .\nFor example, Wang et al. 3 presented a layout generation framework that plans an indoor scene as a relation graph and iteratively inserts a 3D model at each node.\nHu et al.  converted a layout graph along with a building boundary into a floorplan that fulfills both the layout and boundary constraints.\nAshual et al.  and Johnson et al.  tried to generate image layouts and synthesize realistic images from input scene graphs via GCNs.\nNauata et al. 6 proposed a graph-constrained generative\nadversarial network, whose generator and discriminator are built upon\na relational architecture.\nOur innovation is a novel graph Transformer GAN, where the input constraint is\nencoded into the graph structure of the proposed graph Transformer-based generator and node classification-based discriminator.\nExperimental results show the effectiveness of GTGAN over all the leading methods. Transformers in Computer Vision.\nThe Transformer was first proposed in  for machine translation\nand has established state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks.\nRecently, the Vision Transformer (ViT)  equipped with global self-attention has achieved state-of-the-art results on the classification task.\nSince then, Transformer-based approaches have been shown to be efficient in many computer vision tasks including image segmentation   , object detection   , depth estimation , pose estimation 1 2, video inpainting , vision-and-language navigation , video classification 8, human reaction generation , 3D pose transfer  .\nDifferent from these methods, in this paper, we adopt a Transformer-based network to tackle the graph-constrained house generation task.\nHowever, integrating graph convolutional networks and ViTs is not trivial.\nTo this end, we propose a graph Transformer-based generator to capture both local and global relations across nodes in a graph.\nTo the best of our knowledge, GTGAN is the first Transformer-based house generation framework.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Generative Adversarial Networks\n[ref]12 have been widely used for image generation [ref]19   .\nThe vanilla GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator.\nThe generator aims to synthesize photorealistic images from a noise vector,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
