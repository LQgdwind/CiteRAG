      "content": "Paper Title: Collaborative Knowledge Graph Fusion by Exploiting the Open Corpus\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge graphs, which are a structurally organized form of information,\nhave supported a variety of downstream tasks,\nincluding recommender systems [ref]1, NLP tasks , question answering  , and entity-linking .\nExisting open source knowledge graphs such as Wikidata , WordNet  and Freebase  contain billions of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples [ref]9 in the form of (subject, relation, object) relations, where both the subject and object represent the named entities , and the relation models the relationship between these two named entities. However, since open source knowledge graphs\nare designed for general purposes, they contain only limited factuaL knowledge\nfor particular tasks [ref]11 in restricted domais such as finance or medicine. To adapt to multiple domains, it is crucial to construct high-quality domain specific knowledge graphs. In order to construct new knowledge graphs from unstructured textual sources, existing work mainly consists of several pipelined sub-tasks, e.g., named entity recognition , relation extraction  or relation alignment .\nThese methods are designed as separate subtasks and not as a unified system . Thus they do not fully address the issue of how to effectively leverage the information hidden in the connections between the subtasks  to improve the quality of a knowledge graph built from a text corpus.\nTo this end, recent work has combined named entity recognition with relation extraction as a single joint-event-extraction  task that can jointly obtain the entities and relations from text sources. However, since the current work does not focus on the resulting process to build an integrated knowledge graph from the extracted results, there still exists much scope for constructing a high-quality domain-oriented knowledge graph from test documents. Knowledge graph fusion    is a possible route by which to construct a knowledge graph from the extracted event factors in an open corpus. Early work applied the traditional data fusion method 0 while considering only fusing the data under a global or compatible data schema 1. This work evaluates the quality of data by checking whether or not a triple is contained in the extended set of a ground-truth knowledge graph 2. However, this type of method may ignore the\nimplications of knowledge that is indirectly contained in the ground-truth knowledge graph. It may thus discard many meaningful triples from different and potentially valuable sources. In order to overcome this problem, recent knowledge graph embedding 3 methods have leveraged network embedding technology 4 to infer the possibilities of the existence of triples in a given knowledge graph. This is done by representing the triples as latent vectors 5 6 7. Specifically, with the representation vectors of the triples to hand, these methods use statistical models 8 or neural networks 9 0 to predict plausible scores for the potential triples. Although much existing work discusses the potential triple evaluation problem for the knowledge graph fusion task, little considers generating the candidate triples from open text sources and linking candidate generation with the evaluation process to automatically. fuse the obtained triples to a prior knowledge graph. The main challenges that hinder progress in this direction are routed in the following shortcomings in the knowledge extraction and a knowledge graph fusion tasks.\n(1) Difficulties in aligning RDF triples. Since open text sources may contain relations outside the scope of a prior knowledge graph, it is a challenge to align the relations from the open texts to those in the knowledge graph.\nAlthough current work discusses the entity alignment 2 between sources, little focusses on relation alignment.\nThis leads to the difficulty of aligning the extracted RDF triples from the text sources to a prior knowledge graph.\n(2) Difficulties maintaining knowledge graph quality.\nMerging the unaligned RDF triples from the open text sources to a knowledge graph can mislead the knowledge graph embedding model and may result in unreliable plausible scores for potential triples. Moreover, a misleading knowledge graph can result in the the extractor\nrelying on low-quality triples. This may further lower the quality of the knowledge graph. (3) Difficulties sharing knowledge between sub-tasks. Without a reliable way of aligning the RDF triples, it becomes difficult to share knowledge between the sub-tasks (e.g. event extraction and knowledge fusion). This leads to error propagation 3 between sub-tasks and thus degrade the performance for each sub-task. To address the aforementioned limitations, in this paper, we formulate a new method that combines event extraction (extractor) with knowledge graph fusion as a Collaborative Knowledge Graph Fusion process. Specifically, we propose a unified framework to build a domain-oriented knowledge graph by enriching an open-source knowledge graph with knowledge extracted automatically from a text corpus. Since our new method provides a mechanism to share the knowledge between sub-tasks, our enriched knowledge graph grows larger by incorporating facts of knowledge from the texts. In addition, the new method also leverages the enriched knowledge graph to assist our event extraction sub-task to obtain more reliable entities and relations from documents.\n As illustrated in Figure 1, the collaborative knowledge graph fusion method consists of two interacting processes, an explorer and a supervisor. That is, by referring to the principles (e.g. the possible entity pairs) from a supervisor, an extractor explores new RDF triples from the available open text sources. After the extractor submits the newly discovered triples to the supervisor, the supervisor evaluates their quality and extends the existing set of triples using the highest quality newly discovered triples. Specifically, our framework guides the extractor with the entity pairs from a prior seed knowledge graph, and then iteratively increments the seed knowledge graph with the extracted triples from the extractor.\nIn this process, both the performance of the extractor and the quality of the enriched knowledge graph are improved.\nTo this end, in our extractor, we propose a benchmark-based supervision mechanism to supervise the extraction process with the entity pairs from the seed knowledge graph maintained by the supervisor.\nThis is implemented by a contrastive learning method which considers both the positive and negative entity pairs.\nThese entity pairs are sampled from the prior knowledge graph with a neural Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) scoring function trained by the supervisor process.\nOn the other hand, to the supervisor, the KGE scoring function is trained by the triples in the seed or the enriched knowledge graph and it evaluates the matching degree of the extracted RDF triples from the extractor to the knowledge of the supervisor.\nConsequently, the supervisor merges the high-ranked triples from the extracted results into the prior knowledge graph. We conduct exhaustive experiments on real-world corpora and knowledge graphs. Experimental results show that our system achieves higher performance than state-of-the-art baselines, both on the joint-event-extraction and the knowledge-graph-embedding tasks.\nThis verifies not only that the proposed benchmark-based supervision mechanism guides the extractor well in our system, and but that it also implies that the knowledge graph of the supervisor maintains a high quality by being enriched with the triples evaluated by the supervisor. In summary, our main contributions are as follows: We formalize the knowledge graph fusion with open corpora as an alternating process consisting of extracting the RDF triples from documents and then fusing a prior knowledge graph with the obtained triples. As far as we know, our work is the first to discuss a unified architecture to conduct the knowledge fusion directly based on the text sources. We propose the “Collaborative Knowledge Graph Fusion” framework as a solution for the aforementioned problem. In this framework, we propose the Benchmark-based Supervision Mechanism to further supervise the performance of our JEE process (in the explorer process) with positive and negative entity pairs sampled from a prior KG provided by the supervisor. We propose an unsupervised metric, Translated Relation Alignment Scoring (TRAS), to assist align and translate the extracted triples from the JEE process to those in the proper form to the prior KG. With the proposed Benchmark-based Supervision Mechanism and TRAS to hand, we implement the “Collaborative Knowledge Graph Fusion” as a unified process. It automatically extracts the triples from an open corpus and enriches them to a given prior KG in an alternative process. Our experiments on several real-world datasets show that, with the proposed framework, our system achieves better performance both on the JEE and KGF tasks than the related alternatives. This verifies that our method not only improves the JEE process but also yields a high-quality enriched KG. Specifically, our case study shows that our system could translate the extracted triples from a text corpus to the facts consistent with a prior KG with the assistance of the proposed TRAS score. This improves the quality of the prior KG and also explains the reason for the performance improvement of the KGF task. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the preliminaries concerning the joint event extraction and knowledge graph fusion processes and then also formalize the problem of knowledge graph fusion with an open corpus. Section 3 presents in detail our proposed framework and fusion mechanism. Section 4 verifies the effectiveness of our model and compares it with recent methods on real-world datasets. Section 5 summarizes recent related work. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 6 where we offer suggestions for further work in this direction.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Knowledge graphs, which are a structurally organized form of information,\nhave supported a variety of downstream tasks,\nincluding recommender systems [ref]1, NLP tasks , question answering  , and entity-linking .\nExisting open source knowledge graphs such as Wikidata , WordNet  and Freebase  contain billions of Resource Description Framework (RDF)\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
