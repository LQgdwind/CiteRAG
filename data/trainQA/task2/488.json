      "content": "Paper Title: Estimating semantic structure for the VQA answer space\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModel-agnosticity — \nTable 1 shows the effectiveness of our semantic loss on VQAv2-CP\nwith three models. The proposed approach improves accuracy by +2.02.0+2.0, +0.90.9+0.9 and\n+0.50.5+0.5 points on, respectively, MCAN, BAN and UpDn models when using the Glove semantic space. The gain is in general even higher when using Co-oc semantic space, leading to improvements of of +2.92.9+2.9 (MCAN), 0.80.80.8 (BAN) and +0.10.1+0.1 (UpDn).\nThe on-par performance of Co-oc with respect to Glove (or arguably superior), despite the estimation of Glove from large-scale datasets, illustrates the strength of the goal-directed estimation strategy of Co-oc and the thus learning signal directly derived from human annotations. We observe that the impact of the semantic loss on the UpDn architecture is less significant than on BAN and MCAN, both for the Co-oc and Glove semantic spaces.\nWe conjecture that this is due to the higher dependency of UpDn on the question bias.\nTo further investigate this, we performed experiments combining the semantic loss with a state-of-the-art bias reduction method. Complementarity of gains with bias-reduction methods — \nWe combine the semantic loss with RUBi [ref]5,\na state-of-the-art method designed to reduce language biases in VQA models. RUBi combines standard VQA models with a second question-only branch, whose objective is the explicit estimation of language biases. During training time, the prediction of the question-only branch is used as a mask combined with the VQA branch by element-wise multiplication, which drives the VQA model to overcome the inherent language bias. The masking is removed during testing. As shown in Table 2, the semantic loss (in the using Glove variant) improves upon the combination of UpDn model architecture + RUBi training with a margin of +3.33.3+3.3 points and reaches an accuracy of 47.5%percent47.547.5\\% on the VQAv2-CP test split444We observe an instability when using UpDn+RUBi which occasionally prevents the model from converging. As a consequence, we provide the average accuracy over four converged models with random seeds along with the standard deviation..\nThis indicates that the proposed loss is complementary to existing bias-reduction approaches and improves the generalization and reasoning abilities of the model. Impact on VQAv2 dataset —  As discussed before, the VQAv2-CP dataset has been proposed by   with the goal to evaluate the performance of VQA models in a condition where they cannot fully rely on question biases.\nIndeed, as shown in , the original VQAv2  dataset contains numerous question biases (e.g. the question \\saywhat color is the banana in the picture can be correctly answered as \\sayyellow without even analyzing the picture in VQAv2).\nAt the same time, it is very important to verify that our semantic loss, which is effective for training VQA models on the unbiased VQAv2-CP dataset, does not hinder the model’s performances when the training is done on the biased VQAv2 dataset. Therefore, Table 3 analyzes the impact of our semantic loss on the VQAv2 dataset and compares it with recent approaches designed to remove the language bias in VQA.\nMore precisely, we compare the accuracies on the VQAv2 validation dataset of baseline VQA models (the original baselines from the respective works are taken) with and without one of the SOTA approaches aiming to reduce the question biases.\nFor a fair comparison, we only compare with methods which does not rely on extra annotated supervision such as HINT  and SCR(VQA-X) [ref]17.\nThe impacts of the compared approaches on the respective baselines are highlighted in the \\sayΔΔ\\Delta column of Table 3. When combining the semantic loss with MCAN  in the Co-oc variant, we observe a marginal drop of −0.10.1-0.1 in accuracy.\nOn the contrary, SCR (QA) [ref]17 and RUBi [ref]5 cause significant drops of performance of respectively −1.21.2-1.2 and −2.62.6-2.6 points.\nThe drop of the recent DLR  method is even more impressive reaching almost −55-5 accuracy points.\nAll in all, contrary to other SOTA methods, our semantic loss allows to reduce the dependency on question biases (cf. results presented in Table 1) without sacrificing accuracy on the biased VQAv2 dataset. Comparison with the state-of-the-art — \nWe compare our method with SOTA approaches on the VQAv2-CP dataset in Table 4. For a fair comparison, we divide Table 4 into two groups: methods based on the UpDn [ref]7 architecture and the others. When combining the proposed loss along with another bias reduction method – namely RUBi [ref]5 – using the UpDn architecture, we achieve a SOTA-level accuracy of 47.5%percent47.547.5\\%.\nNote that, contrary to HINT  or SCR(VQA-X) [ref]17, our approach does not require any additional annotations.\nDLR  achieves a high accuracy (48.5%percent48.548.5\\%) on VQAv2-CP. However, unlike our approach, DLR causes a significant drop in accuracy (of −4.94.9-4.9 points) on the biased VQAv2 dataset as highlighted in Table 3.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: we performed experiments combining the semantic loss with a state-of-the-art bias reduction method.
