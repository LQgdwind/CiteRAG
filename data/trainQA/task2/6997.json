      "content": "Paper Title: Panoptic Vision-Language Feature Fields\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo the best of our knowledge, no previous method is capable of open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation for 3D scenes. Therefore, we compare our method with previous closed-set 3D panoptic segmentation methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. Data. We test on three public datasets for 3D scenes: Replica , ScanNet  , and HyperSim  . Following the same setting as [ref]5, we remap 212121 COCO  panoptic classes (999 thing + 121212 stuff) into the same class set of all datasets for evaluation. To fit a scene, we use posed RGB and depth images to optimize PVLFF, while the ground-truth semantic and instance labels are only used for evaluation. Metrics. Panoptic Quality (PQ) is introduced by  to evaluate panoptic segmentation on the image level. To account for the consistency of segmentation across views in a scene, [ref]5 proposed Scene-level Panoptic Quality (PQscene), by merging segments that belong to the same instance identifier for a certain scene, and computing PQ on the merged segmentation for evaluation. In our experiments, we report PQscene of our model on the benchmarks and additionally report the mean Intersection over Union (mIoUmIoU\\mathrm{mIoU}) of semantic segmentation. Results. We compare our model against the state-of-the-art 3D panoptic systems: DM-NeRF [ref]41, Panoptic Neural Fields (PNF) , Panoptic Lifting [ref]5, and Contrastive Lift [ref]22.\nTab. I shows the evaluation results of our model and the baselines.\nWhile still not fully on-par with the best baselines [ref]5 [ref]22, our method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods [ref]41 . Crucially, however, while all the baselines in Tab. I are supervised, closed-set methods, PVLFF does not use any semantic or instance labels during training.\nMore in detail, our method produces\nsimilar mIoUmIoU\\mathrm{mIoU} scores in semantic segmentation, but\nlower PQscene scores in panoptic segmentation than, e.g., [ref]5 and [ref]22.\nWe observe that\nthis is largely due to the fact that unlike these closed-set systems, which are trained on the specific classes evaluated, PVLFF relies on the universal segmenter SAM to precompute instance masks. Due to its object-agnostic nature, SAM is subject to over-segmentation, which causes the predicted instance masks to not match the ground-truth ones. More in general, we note that defining the boundaries of a previously unseen instance (as is the case in open-vocabulary segmentation) is inherently an ill-posed problem. Consider for example the ceiling in the first row of Fig. 4: Without previously defining whether each tile should be considered as a part of a “ceiling” instance or as a separate instance, it is not possible to guarantee that the detected boundaries will reflect those defined in the ground-truth data. An important observation is that despite the inherent ambiguity of the problem, as we show in Sec. IV-D, PVLFF predicts continuous instance features which are hierarchically structured. This hierarchy could potentially be used to produce panoptic segmentations of different granularities.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: panoptic segmentation methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
