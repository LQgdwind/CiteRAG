      "content": "Paper Title: Cost–effective Variational Active Entity Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEntity Resolution (ER), or the process of identifying different representations of the same real–world entity, has been the subject of more than 70 years of research. Yet, practitioners often opt for ad hoc ER approaches mainly due to deficiencies in adapting existing solutions to new and specialized datasets. In practice, adapting an ER solution to a new use–case often translates to (1) mapping the types of features that govern the comparison of two entities and are expected by the adopted solution to the case at hand, i.e., feature engineering; (2) identifying local examples of duplicates and non–duplicates, i.e., data labeling; and (3) learning a task–specific similarity function that discriminates between duplicates and non–duplicates, i.e., similarity learning. Despite the sheer number of ER methods available [ref]1, few solutions manage to reduce the costs incurred by the above triple, costs often paid in active user involvement and long configuration and training times. With respect to (1) and (3) above, recent proposals (e.g.,  [ref]3) resort to deep learning techniques  to adapt general–purpose features (e.g., word–embeddings [ref]5) to new ER use–cases and learn a task–specific similarity function concomitantly. However, this is done at the expense of (2), since the resulting solutions tend to have a voracious appetite for labeled data (e.g., up to thousands of labeled instances [ref]3), and at the expense of training time, since such approaches can take up to hours to generalize. With respect to (2) above, recent deep ER–focused active learning proposals (e.g., ) aim to generate labeled data for merely adapting an existing and already trained entity matching model to the case at hand.\nTherefore, there is limited support for manually labeling the volumes of training data often required by deep learning ER. In this paper, we aim to reduce the costs associated with performing deep learning–based ER in practice by pioneering the use of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs)  for automatically generating entity representations. This allows us to decouple feature engineering from similarity learning, perform the former without user supervision (step 1 in Figure 1), and only rely on supervised learning for the latter (step 2 in Figure 1).\nAdditionally, we support the data labeling effort for the supervised step through a proposed active learning technique (step 3 in Figure 1), facilitated by the above–mentioned decoupling. Therefore, our central contribution in this paper is an ER method that learns similarity functions over an unsupervised feature space and we show its cost–effectiveness potential through: An unsupervised and transferable representation learning method for producing similarity–preserving feature vectors for tuples (i.e., entities). Unsupervised because it builds on deep generative models (e.g., VAE) to automatically generate the feature vectors. Transferable because the resulting model is reusable without re–training across different ER scenarios and data domains. An adaptable matching method for learning task–specific similarity functions. Adaptable because it builds on Siamese neural networks  to fine–tune previously learned tuple representations to better reflect the notion of similarity derived from given training data. An active–learning scheme for assisting the user in labeling supervised matching training instances. Our contribution here is the exploitation of the generative property of VAEs to identify tuple pairs that are informative, diverse, and balanced with respect to the match/non–match classes. An empirical evaluation of the above on a multitude of domains, demonstrating their collective potential for ER cost reduction in terms of (i) feature engineering and similarity learning; (ii) training times; and (iii) data labeling efforts.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: labeling; and (3) learning a task–specific similarity function that discriminates between duplicates and non–duplicates, i.e., similarity learning.
