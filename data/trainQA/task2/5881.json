In Natural Language Processing (NLP), n𝑛n-gram models are probabilistic models that aim to predict the next word in a text using a limited amount of previous context. The value of n𝑛n indicates the number of words that are used to establish this context. Mathematically speaking, the goal of an n𝑛n-gram model is to estimate the probability P​(tn|t1,⋯,tn−1)𝑃conditionalsubscript𝑡𝑛subscript𝑡1⋯subscript𝑡𝑛1P(t_{n}|t_{1},\\cdots,t_{n-1}) of a particular token (word), tnsubscript𝑡𝑛t_{n}, occurring based on the history of words that have come before it, specifically t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} through tn−1subscript𝑡𝑛1t_{n-1}. We estimate these probabilities by counting the number of times that a sequence of tokens arise in a large corpus. We may consider, for instance, that we intend to estimate the probability of the word “mountains” after the history “These mist covered” that comes from the first sentence “These mist covered mountains\nare a home now for me” of the song “Brothers in Arms” of the British band Dire Straits. In order to estimate this probability, we have to count the number of times the sequence of tokens t1subscript𝑡1t_{1}=“These”, t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}= “mist”, t3subscript𝑡3t_{3}= “covered” arise before t4subscript𝑡4t_{4}=“mountains”. Thus, we may estimate P​(t4|t1,t2,t3)𝑃conditionalsubscript𝑡4subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2subscript𝑡3P(t_{4}|t_{1},t_{2},t_{3}) as P​(t1,t2,t3,t4)P​(t1,t2,t3)𝑃subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2subscript𝑡3subscript𝑡4𝑃subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2subscript𝑡3\\frac{P(t_{1},t_{2},t_{3},t_{4})}{P(t_{1},t_{2},t_{3})}, where P​(t1,t2,⋯,tn)𝑃subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2⋯subscript𝑡𝑛P(t_{1},t_{2},\\cdots,t_{n}) is the frequency of the n𝑛n-gram t1,⋯,tnsubscript𝑡1⋯subscript𝑡𝑛t_{1},\\cdots,t_{n} in the corpus. Most popular language models today are based neural network models. Although there are many different types of neural network models, all share some ingredients with the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).\nAn MLP consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, called “neurons”, where each neuron receives input from the neurons in the previous layer and produces an output that is sent to the neurons in the next layer. The input to the first layer is typically a vector of features and the output of the last layer is the desired output. Each neuron in an MLP computes a linear combination of its inputs and applies a nonlinear function, called “activation function”, to the result. The weights on the inputs determine the strength of the connections between neurons. The nonlinear activation function is necessary to ensure a neural network is able to approximate any continuous function . We may describe mathematically the outputs of the neurons of layer l𝑙l of MLP as where nlsubscript𝑛𝑙n_{l} is the number of neurons of layer l𝑙l, wi​jsubscript𝑤𝑖𝑗w_{ij} is the weight associated with the input i𝑖i of the (previous) layer l−1𝑙1l-1 and the neuron j𝑗j of layer l𝑙l, yi(l−1)superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑙1y_{i}^{(l-1)} is the i𝑖ith output of the (previous) layer l−1𝑙1l-1, Mlsubscript𝑀𝑙M_{l} is the number of neurons of layer l𝑙l, and hlsuperscriptℎ𝑙h^{l} is the activation function of layer l𝑙l111Common types of activation functions are tanh, sigmoide and Relu.. We call the term aj(l)=∑i=1Ml−1wi​j(l)​yi(l−1)+w0​j(l)superscriptsubscript𝑎𝑗𝑙superscriptsubscript𝑖1subscript𝑀𝑙1superscriptsubscript𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑙superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑙1superscriptsubscript𝑤0𝑗𝑙a_{j}^{(l)}=\\sum_{i=1}^{M_{l-1}}w_{ij}^{(l)}y_{i}^{(l-1)}+w_{0j}^{(l)} activation of the neuron j𝑗j222It is also denoted as aj(l)=∑i=0Ml−1wi​j(l)​yi(l−1)superscriptsubscript𝑎𝑗𝑙superscriptsubscript𝑖0subscript𝑀𝑙1superscriptsubscript𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑙superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑙1a_{j}^{(l)}=\\sum_{i=0}^{M_{l-1}}w_{ij}^{(l)}y_{i}^{(l-1)}, where we associate the bias (constant) w0​j(l)superscriptsubscript𝑤0𝑗𝑙w_{0j}^{(l)} with the input y0(l−1)=1superscriptsubscript𝑦0𝑙11y_{0}^{(l-1)}=1.. The input of the first layer is yi0=xisuperscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖0subscript𝑥𝑖y_{i}^{0}=x_{i}, which is actually the input of the neural network with M0subscript𝑀0M_{0} attributes. The output of the neural network is\nyin​l=yi0superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑙superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖0y_{i}^{nl}=y_{i}^{0}, for i=1,⋯​Mn​l𝑖1⋯subscript𝑀𝑛𝑙i=1,\\cdots M_{nl}. Thus, the neural network has Mn​l=Mosubscript𝑀𝑛𝑙subscript𝑀𝑜M_{nl}=M_{o} outputs. In order to estimate the weights (parameters) of a MLP, we need a dataset with a pairs of inputs and outputs. Since the outputs provide a reference for what the neural network should learn for each input, we call this kind of learning as supervised learning.\nWe use the gradient descent (ascent) to minimize (maximize) the output square error (maximal likelihood associated to the problem). Since we have only the errors (or the likelihoods) associated with the last layer, we use the chain rule of calculus to evaluate the gradients associated with the weights of the other layers. This is the so-called backpropagation algorithm. A crucial development towards the creation of large language models has been the use of word embeddings to represent words. Word embeddings are vectors that represent words in high dimensional Euclidean spaces . The concept of word embeddings originates from the idea that the meaning of a word can be inferred from the context in which it appears. We may generate word embeddings using neural network models that learn to predict a word based on its surrounding context. One of the most common neural network models used to generate word embeddings is the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model . The CBOW model consists of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer encodes the context words as one-hot vectors333A one-hot vector is a vector that has the same dimensionality as the vocabulary size and has exactly one element set to 1 and all other elements set to 0. The position of the 1 corresponds to the index of the word in the vocabulary., while the output layer predicts the probability distribution over the vocabulary for the target word. The hidden layer maps the input vectors to a lower-dimensional representation, which is the word embedding. The input layer has C𝐶C inputs (the size of the context used), the intermediate layer has size N𝑁N (the size of the word embedding vectors) and the output layer has NVsubscript𝑁𝑉N_{V} outputs. The size of the hidden layer, as well as the number of context words used as input (denoted by C𝐶C), are hyperparameters that we need to tune for each application. Thus, we have to estimate C𝐶C context matrices of size NV×Nsubscript𝑁𝑉𝑁N_{V}\\times N and one output matrix of size N×NV𝑁subscript𝑁𝑉N\\times N_{V}.\nNote that the problem we solve here is very similar to the one considered by the n𝑛n-grams models. Consider, for instance, the first sentence of the song “All by myself” of Eric Carmen “When I was young I never needed anyone”. Suppose that we consider a context of size 6. Thus, we use the tokens t1subscript𝑡1t_{1}=“I” ,t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}=“was”, t3subscript𝑡3t_{3}=“young ”, t5subscript𝑡5t_{5}=“never”, ,t6subscript𝑡6t_{6}=“needed” and ,t7subscript𝑡7t_{7}=“anyone” to predict ,t4subscript𝑡4t_{4}=“I”.\nTo generate the word embeddings, the model is trained on a large corpus of text in a supervised fashion. During training, the weights of the network are updated to minimize the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the actual distribution of the target word. The actual word embedding vector that is supposedly to represent a word is the average of the rows of the context matrices corresponding to the word and the corresponding column of the output matrix. Transformers form the foundation of ChatGPT and other contemporary large language models.\nThey are neural network models that consist of three ingredients 3: a layer that represent the words using word embedding vectors, a position encoding, and a mechanism of attention. The position encoding informs the position of each token in the input sequence and it is added to the corresponding word embedding vectors. This is achieved through a sinusoidal function that creates a unique encoding for each position in the sequence. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence depending on the task at hand. Self-attention operates by representing the input sequence as a set of queries, keys, and values444These concepts come from the field of information retrieval. The query is a short piece of text, such as a keyword or phrase, that the user enters into a search engine. The key is the piece of information associated with the object that is being searched. The value is the object itself the user is looking for., that are matrices that should be learned. The resulting attention scores are then used to weight the values, producing an output that is a weighted sum of the values, with the weights determined by the attention scores. There is today a large list of transformers that have been used in successful NLP tasks such as\nGoogle’s BERT [ref]1, PEGASUS , T5 , and Switch , Facebook’s BART , and Open AI’s Generative Pre-Training (GPT) ,\nGPT-2 , and GPT-3 [ref]8. ChatGPT is built on GPT-3 [ref]8, that were trained using a large amount of internet data. In general, we train language models to predict the next word, but not to deal with questions of users. A language model may invent facts, may present toxic behavior, or simply do not follow commands. In this case, we say that a language model is poorly aligned. In order to deal with that Open AI uses reinforcement learning from human feedback to align this model based on three steps, based on the feedback of 40 people hired to label the data 6: (1) They collect a dataset of human-labeled comparisons between outputs of the models; (2) They train a reward model on this dataset to predict the output the humans prefer; (3) They use this reward model to fine tune the model using a proximal policy optimization algorithm 4 that is type of reinforcement learning algorithm555A reinforcement learning problem explores a situation where the objective is to map states to actions in order to maximize a numerical reward signal. A Policy gradient method is a reinforcement learning algorithm that learns a parametric representation of the policy and use gradient ascent to iteratively improve it. The proximal policy gradient algorithm constrains the magnitude of the policy update at each iteration reducing the risk of the policy diverging.  5.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: is a weighted sum of the values, with the weights determined by the attention scores.
