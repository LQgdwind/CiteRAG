      "content": "Paper Title: IllumiNet: Transferring Illumination from Planar Surfaces to Virtual Objects in Augmented Reality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIllumination estimation from a scene is a long-standing topic and has been extensively studied. The problem is complicated, even ill-posed sometimes, since it depends on multiple factors, including lighting, scene geometry, surface material, reflectance, etc. Direct capture methods were first proposed by Debevec   by taking photographs of a polished metal ball in the scene. An omnidirectional HDR radiance map with great dynamic range of luminosity was then reconstructed, and could be used to render virtual objects into the scene. However inserting such an additional tool into the scene is infeasible for most scenarios and difficult to scale. Other than HDR environment map, spherical harmonics (SH) were often used to parameterize incident illumination   [ref]19 . Due to the high computational cost of SH, usually only the low-frequency part was used during the optimization, e.g. 2nd-order SH in  and 5th-order in [ref]13. Even though the use of SH could simplify the formulation of incident illumination, it still required the computation of visibility map and the estimation of albedo. It actually took a considerable amount of time especially for a dense mesh . Therefore in , rather than recovering the lighting of the whole scene, Xu et al. introduced a novel term named vertex overall illumination vector to represent the overall effect of all incident lights at each individual 3D point of the object. However its improvement over SH was only showed in term of shape-from-shading. Meanwhile, lighting estimation is also studied as an intermediate result for specific purposes. For example in  and 6, authors estimated the lighting for the purpose of image enhancement. While  proposed to normalize the illumination on human faces, in order to improve the performance of face recognition. Thanks to the rapid development of deep learning, recent works tried to directly estimate illumination from a single LDR image with limited FOV. Garder et al.  first proposed an end-to-end CNN to recover environment maps from a single view-limited LDR image in an indoor scene. Their approach first used a large number of LDR panoramas with source light position labels to train and predict the position of the light source, and then used a small number of HDR panoramas to fine-tune the network to estimate light intensity. Hold-Geoffroy et al.  learned to predict the parameters of the Hosek-Wilkie sky model from a single image to get the outdoor scene illumination. Zhang et al.  used a more sophisticated Lalonde-Matthews(L-M) outdoor light model to predict model parameters from LDR images for an outdoor HDR panorama. Cheng et al.  proposed utilizing two pictures taken from the front and back of the phone to estimate low-frequency lighting.   used a special camera device to take scene photos and polished steel balls of three different materials to collect pairs of image and HDR environment map data. Calian et al.  used the Sun+Sky model and face prior to estimate the HDR light probe from the LDR face, but it is prone to local minima. When the light source is behind the person, the model estimates the wrong result because it is unable to get enough illumination information from the backlit face. Song et al. 8 designed three sub-neural networks to progressively estimate geometry, LDR panoramas and final HDR environment map based on input image and locale. Garon et al. [ref]13 proposed a method for estimating the spatially-varying indoor illumination in real time, which combines global features and local features to predict spherical harmonics coefficients. However, due to the complexity and unknownness of the real scene, especially when the light sources are not captured in the input image, inconsistent illumination of predicted panoramic HDR is inevitable. Essentially, these previous works get the mapping of input images to environment maps or SH coefficients. While our proposed approach directly predicts the illumination effects of the inserted virtual object itself, making the problem less error-prone. In their recent work [ref]11, Gardner et al. proposed to replace the HDR environment maps with parametric representations. The idea is somewhat similar to ours, but there are two major differences. Firstly their lighting model is a set of discrete 3D lights describing the entire science, while our proposed approach directly transfer the vertex overall illumination from detected planes to the virtual objects. Secondly, as indicated in its title, the method in [ref]11 only applies to the indoor illumination, which is less robust compared to our method that works for both indoor and outdoor scenes. Some recent works also proposed to estimates the HDR lighting environment maps from more complicated inputs. For example, Gkitsas et al. presented a data-driven model that estimates lighting from a spherical panorama . Srinivasan et al. proposed to estimate a 3D volumetric RGB model, and then the\nincident illumination, using narrow-baseline stereo pairs of images 9. While their methods both achieved realistic results, the inputs are usually more difficult to obtain compared to standard RGB images.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: tool into the scene is infeasible for most scenarios and difficult to scale.
