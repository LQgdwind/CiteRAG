Recently, lot of works that focus on explanation models, one of that is image captioning for basic explanation of an image     5       .   has proposed an exemplar-based explanation method for generating question based on the image. Similarly,   has suggested a discriminator based method to obtain an explanation for paraphrase generation in text. In VQA,  have proposed interesting methods for improving attention in the question. Work that explores image and question jointly and is based on hierarchical co-attention is  .      have proposed attention-based methods for the explanation in VQA, which use question to attend over specific regions in an image.     have suggested exciting works that advocate multimodal pooling and obtain close to state of the art results in VQA.   has proposed an exemplar-based explanation method to improve attention in VQA. We can do systematic comparison of image-based attention while correlating with human annotated attention maps as shown by . Recently a lot of researchers have focused on estimating uncertainty in the predictions using deep learning.  has proposed a method to learn uncertainty in the weights of the neural network. Kendall et.al.  has proposed method to measure model uncertainty for image segmentation task. They observed that the softmax probability function approximates relative probability between the class labels, but does not provide information about the model’s uncertainty. The work by   estimates model uncertainty of the deep neural networks (CNNs, RNNs) with the help of dropout .  has estimated uncertainty for batch normalized deep networks.   0 have mainly decomposed predictive uncertainty into two major types, namely aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, which capture uncertainty present in the data and uncertainty about in model respectively. 1 suggested a method to measure predictive uncertainty with the help of model and data uncertainty. Recently, 2 proposed a certainty method to bring two data distributions close for the domain adaption task. In our previous work  3, our objective is to analyze and minimize the uncertainty in attention masks to predict answers in VQA. To accomplish this, we are proposing gradient-based certainty explanation masks, which minimize the uncertainty in attention regions for improving the correct answer’s predicted probability in VQA. Our method also provides a visual explanation based on uncertainty class activation maps, capturing and visualizing the uncertainties present in the attention maps in VQA. We extend our work  3 to generalise uncertainty based class activation map for the VQA system. We start with a simple VQA model without attention, and then we compare with our Gradient based Certainty Attention mask (GCA) method in section-V. We also have analysed the role of data uncertainty in a multimodal setting in section-VI. We conduct an experiment to analyse both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in section-VII-B2 and section-VII-B3. In section-VII-B5, we perform Statistical Significance Analysis for variants of our model. Finally, we provide more qualitative results and visualise the attention mask of our model using Monte Carlo Simulation in section-VII-C and our project webpage111https://delta-lab-iitk.github.io/U-CAM/.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: The task of Visual question answering   [ref]9   is well studied in the vision and language community, but it has been relatively less explored for providing explanation[ref]3 for answer prediction.
