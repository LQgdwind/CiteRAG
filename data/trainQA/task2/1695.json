      "content": "Paper Title: Touchless Palmprint Recognition based on 3D Gabor Template and Block Feature Refinement\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBiometric identification has been widely used in modern society,\nsuch as electronic payment, entrance control, and forensic identification.\nIn the last decade,\nwe have witnessed the successful cases of biometric system using fingerprint  ,\niris  [ref]4 and face  [ref]6 .\nWith the development of computer vision,\nbiometric based on image analysis become popular.\nAs a representative biometric technology,\npalmprint recognition provides a reliable and efficient solution for recognizing a person’s identity with high confidence    0 1 2.\nEven in low resolution,\npalmprint images contain rich biometric information and have high antispoof capability,\nwhich is desired for person identification .\nBased on the image capture manner,\npalmprint images could be divided into two categories: touch-based and touchless.\nIn a real application,\npeople prefer to use touchless manner which is more hygienic and convenient,\nespecially under the current epidemic situation.\nWith this trend,\na growing number of works turn to more challenged touchless palmprint recognition tasks. Starting from PalmCode ,\na large number of works 3 4 5 6 develop coding based methods.\nIn these methods,\nthe orientation information or the texture information on the palm are encoded into a feature map.\nWith well-designed matching algorithms,\ncoding based approaches are usually efficient.\nHowever, the scheme of pixel-to-pixel comparison decreases their robustness.\nRecently more and more methods depending on machine learning techniques emerge.\nFei et al. 7 proposes a learned binary palmprint descriptor,\ntargeting to minimize the intra-class distance and maximize the inter-class distance.\nZhang et al. 6 uses collaborative representation which learns the feature distribution in the training gallery,\nachieving high performances in identity recognition.\nWith the significant achievement of deep learning in computer vision,\na lot of works 8 9 0 employ convolutional neural network (CNN) as feature extractor.\nZhao et al. 1 designs a network which is suitable for hyperspectral palmprint feature extraction.\nIn 2,\nan end-to-end deep learning algorithm is proposed for accurate palmprint identification.\nThe framework has different parts which are responsible for hand image alignment and feature extraction respectively.\nGenovese et al. 3 adopts adaptive Gabor filters and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in a three-layer CNN\nthat can learn discriminative features without class labels. Though the research study of touchless palmprint recognition has been carried out for a long period,\nthe lack of large-scale palmprint datasets limits the further development of this domain to some extent.\nMoreover,\nmost existing methods are designed and verified on medium-scale datasets,\nsuch as PolyU 4, TongJi 6 and IITD 5,\nwhile the performance on a larger dataset remains unclear.\nTo address the above concerns,\nwe build a large-scale touchless palmprint dataset that contains 2334 palms from 1167 individuals.\nThe embedded binocular camera in the acquisition device can capture palmprint image and palm vein image simultaneously.\nIn the dataset,\neach palm has 6 RGB images and 6 infra-red (IR) images with different postures and there are totally 28,008 images.\nTo the best of our knowledge,\nit is the largest touchless palmprint image benchmark ever collected with regard to the number of individuals and palms. We also notice that most existing CNN based methods leverage traditional neural architectures or simply embed handcrafted filters,\nwhile the potential of the Gabor filter is not fully exploited.\nBased on our observation,\nthe lines on the palm are the most important parts in deep feature learning.\nAs a consequence,\na issue that degrades the recognition performance is the ROI misalignment.\nIn order to extract highly discriminative features,\nwe propose a novel deep learning framework named 3DCPN that takes full advantage of low-level Gabor features.\nIn the first layer of 3DCPN,\nmulti-scale, multi-direction Gabor filters and curved Gabor filters are embedded.\nLeveraging the steerability of Gabor filters,\npalmprint images are convolved with 3D Gabor templates that generate low-level features.\nThen the features are reformatted to three spatial dimensions which involve width, height, and direction.\nSeveral 3D convolution modules are designed for generating high-level palmprint descriptors.\nBesides,\na part of a palmprint is also a palmprint,\nutilizing the local region information in palmprint recognition is an unavoidable topic.\nIn our method,\ninstead of simply extracting and fusing features in other methods 5,\nwe regard each subregion as a real palmprint.\nConsidering this local characteristic of palmprint,\nwe use a region-based loss function named block loss on the top of the network to enhance the block features.\nThe region-based learning scheme avoids the ROI misalignment issue to some extent.\nFinally,\nexperimental results on three palmprint datasets and ablation analysis show the superiority of our method. To summarize, the contribution of our paper is four-fold: We have established a large-scale touchless palmprint dataset containing 2334 palms from 1167 individuals,\nwhich will benefit the development of the community. We propose a novel deep learning framework comprising novel curved Gabor filters and well-designed 3D convolution,\nwhich foucus on line features and can generate a high discriminative palmprint descriptor. We develop a training supervision scheme that considers both the global descriptor and local descriptors,\nemploying a block loss to enforce their robustness and discriminative ability. Extensive experiments show that the designed CNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance,\nproving the efficiency of palmprint recognition on large-scale person verification scenarios. The organization of this paper is shown as follows.\nThe related works about Gabor filter,\ntouchless palmprint dataset and recognition methods are briefly described in Section II.\nThe newly established dataset are introduced in Section III.\nSome visualization results are shown in Section IV and the motivation behind our method is also introduced.\nOur proposed framework 3DCPN as well as its components and inference are analyzed in Section V,\nfollowed by the experimental analysis in Section VI.\nThis paper is finally concluded in Section VII.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: modern society,\nsuch as electronic payment, entrance control, and forensic identification.\nIn the last decade,\nwe have witnessed the successful cases of biometric system using fingerprint  ,\niris  [ref]4 and face  [ref]6 .\nWith the development of computer vision,\nbiometric based on image analysis become popular.\nAs a representative biometric technology,\npalmprint recognition provides a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
