      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-task Learning for Concurrent Prediction of Thermal Comfort, Sensation, and Preference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe quality of indoor environment effects health, well-being, and productivity of the residents/occupants.\nIn the absence of adequate indoor thermal comfort, the performance of occupant is likely to deteriorate as their ability to make decisions and/or execute professional tasks depreciates [ref]1. Thus, ensuring satisfactory levels of thermal comfort is necessary and estimating and/or predicting indoor thermal comfort is an important problem in academia and industry. The advancements in the domain of machine learning   and the continually lowering cost of computational resources, has made it possible to solve complex thermal comfort prediction problems.\nRecent studies show that ML-based models are more precise and accurate     in predicting thermal comfort of occupants, as compared to the conventional numerical models such as the Predicted Mean Vote-Percentage of Dissatisfied (PMV-PPD) model  and the Adaptive model (AM) . Further, ML models can be designed and trained for predicting both, individual thermal comfort  and group thermal comfort . Further, ML-based predictive solutions are data-driven and more suited to ensure energy efficiency while providing indoor thermal comfort (TC). Typically, buildings are designed to meet the thermal comfort needs of residents in three ways, i.e., through smart Heating, Ventilation And Cooling (HVAC) systems, natural ventilation, and mixed ventilation systems. Though HVAC systems are the most effective in ensuring high TC, their energy consumption is up to 50% of the energy budget of a building, amounting to a staggering 20% of the total energy consumption in USA . Despite smart HVAC control strategies for energy-conservation , this solution is not ecologically sustainable in the long-term. Moreover, HVACs and mixed systems are not affordable in most developing countries, where the bulk of indoor spaces including classrooms are naturally ventilated . From the perspective of energy efficiency and conservation, naturally ventilated building seem ideal . However, natural ventilation also renders occupants more vulnerable to the temporal changes in the weather, making thermal comfort estimation and prediction a challenging task. This work tries to address this problem. Most importantly, the current ML-based thermal comfort prediction models often offer partial or conflicting solutions. This happens because thermal comfort perception of an individual is highly subjective and personal. It has several dimensions specific to an occupant, such as, sensation, preference, current level of comfort, etc. These dimensions are captured through corresponding subjective metrics, viz., Thermal Sensation Vote (TSV), Thermal Preference Vote (TPV), and Thermal Comfort Vote (TCV), shown in Figure 1. However, the current ML-based solutions either focus on just one of these metrics, such as TSV  , or propose a different prediction model for each metric . This leads to confusing or contradictory predictions, rendering practical real-world implementation infeasible. For practical implementation of TC prediction models, occupant data must be gathered through field experiments. Schools and classrooms are an ideal real-world setting as\nschool students, spend more time in classrooms as compared to any other built environment outside their homes. It is well established that higher levels of indoor thermal comfort and air quality\nfacilitate improved concentration and enhance scholastic learning . Moreover, school children exhibit lower metabolism than adults , limited cognitive abilities to evaluate their environments, and limited opportunities for adaptation in naturally ventilated classrooms. Thus, understanding and predicting students’ thermal comfort needs in naturally ventilated classrooms is a challenging problem that needs to be solved for better learning outcomes, health, and energy efficiency. To remedy these challenges, this work proposes a Multi-task learning inspired solution, that simultaneously predicts the three most important thermal comfort metrics for primary school students in naturally ventilated classrooms. The high-level research problems and specific contributions are presented ahead.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: the absence of adequate indoor thermal comfort, the performance of occupant is likely to deteriorate as their ability to make decisions and/or execute professional tasks depreciates [ref]1.
