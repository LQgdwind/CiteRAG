      "content": "Paper Title: FlaKat: A Machine Learning-Based Categorization Framework for Flaky Tests\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFlaky tests that pass and fail arbitrarily with the same software-under-test are common phenomena in modern-day software development. They cause unnecessary wasted efforts during continuous integration and regression testing, which are widely adopted in both industry and the open-source community¬†. Additionally, failures due to test case flakiness also hinders the reliability and validity of methodologies proposed by researchers, especially in areas such as fault localization¬† and mutation testing¬†[ref]3. The fact that flaky tests are frequently encountered makes the situation worse with 59% of respondents from a survey of industrial developers claiming to experience it at least monthly. Moreover, 91% of the developers claimed to deal with flaky tests at least a few times in a year¬†. Researchers have studied flaky tests since 2009 and developed numerous solutions for flaky test detection¬†. The traditional approaches usually adopt dynamic analysis that executes test suites repeatedly¬†. For certain flaky tests, it may require hundreds, sometimes thousands, of executions for the failure to occur, which makes them more troublesome to identify¬† . Some other flaky tests may only pass or fail if the test suites are executed in a specific order, which requires formulating randomized execution plans and collecting the results from all attempts¬† 0. Despite being effective in detecting flaky tests, these tools are also relatively expensive in terms of computational power and runtime. Some flakiness detection tools take the static analysis approach¬†1 2 and recent studies also incorporated machine learning tools into detecting test case flakiness with promising results¬†3. Compared to the traditional methods, machine learning solutions are much faster at locating flaky tests in the test suites. Once identified, flaky tests can be repaired according to their categories and root causes manually¬† 4. Recent studies also developed automated solutions to repair flaky tests for certain categories of flaky tests¬†5 6 but there exists a gap between the tools for flaky test detection and category-specific flaky test fixes. Motivated by the prior works applying machine learning models in the area of flaky test detection¬† and¬†8, we propose a novel framework named FlaKat that adopts the machine learning approach to predict the category of flaky tests. Our work explores the effectiveness of three different source code vectorization methods: doc2vec¬†9, code2vec¬†0, and term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf)¬†1. Several dimensionality reduction techniques are experimented and the machine learning classifier used in the framework is also selected after careful evaluation and comparison in terms of F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1} score and a new evaluation metric named Flakiness Detection Capacity (FDC). F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1} score is an effective and popular indicator of model quality since it reflects both precision and recall¬†2. FDC is derived from intrusion detection capacity for intrusion detection systems¬†3 and can measure the performance of a classifier from the perspective of information-theoretic analysis. The development of FlaKat also served as the foundation of the Master thesis of the author¬†4. The rest of this paper is divided into the following sections. Section¬†II describes the methodology and implementation details behind the proposed FlaKat framework as well as the research questions answered. Section¬†III illustrates the evaluation of the framework via two metrics, F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1} score and FDC. Section¬†IV provides related work, including both studies on flaky tests and their state-of-the-art solutions. Section¬†V goes through the threats to the validity of this research. Section¬†VI concludes the paper as well as points out some future directions.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: failures due to test case flakiness also hinders the reliability and validity of methodologies proposed by researchers, especially in areas such as fault localization¬† and mutation testing¬†[ref]3.
