      "content": "Paper Title: SGD_Tucker: A Novel Stochastic Optimization Strategy for Parallel Sparse Tucker Decomposition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTensors are a widely used data representation style for interaction data in the Machine Learning (ML) application community , e.g,\nin Recommendation Systems ,\nQuality of Service (QoS) ,\nNetwork Flow ,\nCyber-Physical-Social (CPS) , or\nSocial Networks .\nIn addition to applications in which the data is naturally represented in the form of tensors,\nanother common used case is the fusion in multi-view or multi-modality problems¬†.\nHere, during the learning process,\neach modality corresponds to a feature and the feature alignment involves fusion.\nTensors are a common form of feature fusion for multi-modal learning   [ref]9 0.\nUnfortunately, tensors can be difficult to process in practice.\nFor instance, an NùëÅN-order tensor comprises of the interaction relationship between NùëÅN kinds of attributes and\nif each attribute has millions of items,\nthis results in a substantially large size of data 1.\nAs a remedy,\ndimensionality reduction can be used to represent the original state using much fewer parameters 2. Specifically in the ML community,\nTensor Factorization (TF), as a classic dimensionality reduction technique, plays a key role for low-rank representation.\nXu et al., 3 proposed a Spatio-temporal multi-task learning model via TF and in this work,\ntensor data is of 555-order, i.e., weather, traffic volume, crime rate, disease incidents, and time.\nMeanwhile, this model made predictions through the time-order for the multi-task in weather, traffic volume, crime rate, and disease incidents orders and the relationship construction between those orders is via TF.\nIn the community of Natural Language Processing (NLP),\nLiu et al., 4 organized a mass of texts into a tensor and each slice is modeled as a sparse symmetric matrix.\nFurthermore, the tensor representation is a widely-used form for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), e.g., in the popular TensorFlow¬†5 framework, and\nKossaifi et al., 6 took tensorial parametrization of a CNNs and pruned the parametrization by Tensor Network Decomposition (TND).\nMeanwhile, Ju, et al., 7 pruned and then accelerated the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) coupling with TF.\nIn the Computer Vision (CV) community,\nWang et al., 8 modeled\nvarious factors, i.e., pose and illumination, as an unified tensor and make disentangled representation by adversarial autoencoder via TF.\nZhang et al., 9 constructed multi subspaces of multi-view data and then abstract factor matrices via TF for\nthe unified latent of each view. High-Order, High-Dimension, and Sparse Tensor (HOHDST) is a common situation in the big-data processing and ML application community 0 1.\nDimensionality reduction can also be used to find the low-rank space of HOHDST in ML applications 2,\nwhich can help to make prediction from existing data.\nTherefore, it is non-trivial to learn the pattern from the existed information in a HOHDST and then make the corresponding prediction.\nSparse Tucker Decomposition (STD) is one of the most popular TF models for HOHDST, which can find the NùëÅN-coordinate systems and those systems are tangled by a core tensor between each other 3.\nLiu et al., 4 proposed to accomplish the visual tensor completion via STD.\nThe decomposition process of STD involves the entanglement of NùëÅN-factor matrices and core tensor and\nthe algorithms follow one of the following two directions:\n1) search for optimal orthogonal coordinate system of factor matrices, e.g., High-order Orthogonal Iteration (HOOI)¬†5;\n2) designing optimization solving algorithms¬†6.\nHOOI is a common solution for STD¬†7 and\nable to find the NùëÅN orthogonal coordinate systems which are similar to Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), but requires frequent intermediate variables of Khatri-Rao and Kronecker products 8. An interesting topic is that\nstochastic optimization¬†9, e.g., Count Sketch and Singleshot¬†0 1, etc. can alleviate this bottleneck to a certain extent, depending on the size of dataset.\nHowever, those methods depend on the count sketch matrix, which cannot be easily implemented in a distributed environment and is notoriously difficult to parallelize.\nThe Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method can approximate the gradient from randomly selected subset and\nit forms the basis of the state of art methods, e.g.,\nvariance SGD 2,\naverage SGD 3,\nStochastic Recursive Gradient 4, and\nmomentum SGD 5.\nSGD is adopted to approximate the eventual optimal solver with lower space and computational complexities;\nmeanwhile, the low data-dependence makes the SGD method amenable to parallelization 6.\nThe idea of construction for the computational graph of the mainstream platforms, e.g., Tensorflow¬†5 and Pytorch¬†7, is\nbased on the SGD¬†8 and\npractitioners have already demonstrated its powerful capability on large-scale optimization problems.\nThe computational process of SGD only needs a batch of training samples rather than the full set which gives\nthe ML algorithm the low-dependence between each data block and low communication overhead 9. There are three challenges to process HOHDST in a fast and accurate way:\n1) how to define a suitable optimization function to find the optimal factor matrices and core tensor?\n2) how to find an appropriate optimization strategy in a low-overhead way and then reduce the entanglement of the factor matrices with core tensor which\nmay produce massive intermediate matrices?\n3) how to parallelize STD algorithms and make distributed computation with low communication cost?\nIn order to solve these problems, we present the main contributions of this work which are listed as follows: A novel optimization objective for STD is presented.\nThis proposed objective function not only has a low number of parameters via coupling the Kruskal product (Section¬†4.1) but also is approximated as a convex function; A novel stochastic optimization strategy is proposed for STD, SGD__\\_Tucker,\nwhich can automatically divide the high-dimension intermediate variables\ninto small batches of intermediate matrices that only follows the index of the randomly selected small samples;\nmeanwhile, the overall accuracy and convergence are kept (Section 4.3); The low data-dependence of SGD__\\_Tucker creates opportunities for fine-grained parallelization,\nwhich makes SGD__\\_Tucker obtaining lower computational overhead with the same accuracy.\nMeanwhile, SGD__\\_Tucker does not rely on the specific compressive structure of a sparse tensor (Section 4.4). To our best knowledge,\nSGD__\\_Tucker is the first work that can divide the high-dimension intermediate matrices\nof STD into small batches of intermediate variables, a critical step for fine-grained parallelization with low communication overhead.\nIn this work,\nthe related work is presented in Section¬†2.\nThe notations and preliminaries are introduced in Section¬†3.\nThe SGD__\\_Tucker model as well as parallel and communication overhead on distributed environment for STD are showed in Section¬†4.\nExperimental results are illustrated in Section¬†5.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: problems¬†.\nHere, during the learning process,\neach modality corresponds to a feature and the feature alignment involves fusion.\nTensors are a common form of feature fusion for multi-modal learning   [ref]9 0.\nUnfortunately, tensors can be difficult to process in practice.\nFor instance, an NùëÅN-order tensor comprises of the interaction relationship between NùëÅN kinds of attributes and\nif each\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
