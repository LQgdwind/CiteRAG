      "content": "Paper Title: Rule Mining over Knowledge Graphs via Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe second set of experiments aim to evaluate the quality of mined rules of our approach.\nPrevious works  [ref]31 evaluated the quality of mined rules by examining the new facts they discover.\nFollow that criterion, we first evaluate the discovered new facts of mined rules in DBpedia and Wikidata, and then conduct experiments of link prediction task on FB15K-237 dataset.\nFor a fair comparison, we use the CWA confidence as the statistical rule evaluation measure for all the methods.\nWe tune the hyper-parameter λ=0.9𝜆0.9\\lambda=0.9 via link prediction performance on the FB15K-237 validation set and apply it to all experiments. First, we evaluate the quality of mined rules by examining the precision of new facts they discover for large knowledge bases, such as DBpedia and Wikidata.\nApplying the previous setting, we randomly select 30% of facts from each dataset as the held-out set and check the precision of predicted facts by applying rule mining methods on the remaining facts.\nWe use the same 30 predicates and the same settings as previous experiments.\nDue to various limitations, many rule mining methods only employ on benchmark datasets instead of full-size KGs.\nThus, in this set of experiments, we only compare our methods against state-of-the-art scalable rule mining systems, such as AMIE+ , RLvLR  , RuDik [ref]31, and AnyBURL .\nFurthermore, we only mine closed-path rules for those baselines.\nThus, we only use positive rules for RuDik and constraint them to be closed and connect and without literal values, which is the same as the experiment setting of AMIE+.\nWe rank the predicted facts by descending order of C​D𝐶𝐷CD scores from Eq. (18) for each method, and examine their precision (whether the predicted fact is in the held-out set or not).\nThe results in Figure 6(a) and Figure 6(b) show that the performance of our method is superior to other competitors.\nIn the DBpedia dataset, RLvLR has comparable performance, though our method has the best performance when the number of predicted facts is smaller than 10000 or larger than 15000.\nIn the setting of Wikidata, our method outperforms competitors marginally but steadily.\nThe performance of RuDik is not comparable to these methods, so we exclude it from this figure to make the difference of presented methods prominent. We also evaluate the quality of mined rules by their performance on the link prediction task in benchmark datasets.\nGiven a KG, the task of link prediction is to identify for each predicate P𝑃P and each entity s𝑠s, an entity o𝑜o such that (s,P,o)𝑠𝑃𝑜(s,P,o) is in the KG; or alternatively, to identify for each predicate P𝑃P and each entity o𝑜o, an entity s𝑠s such that (s,P,o)𝑠𝑃𝑜(s,P,o) is in the KG.\nFB15K-237 and WN18RR are two challenging and widely used benchmarks for link prediction.\nWe include the methods in rule learning literature       , and others     [ref]35  [ref]37 for comparison.\nSince we focus on evaluating the quality of the rules, we mainly compare with methods in the rule mining literature.\nThese baselines usually satisfy two conditions.\nFirst, they must produce explicit and explainable rules for prediction.\nThere are many embedding-based  [ref]35 or graph neural network-based  methods with high performance but low interpretability.\nSecond, they must produce inductive prediction (i.e. not rely on the head or tail entities).\nMany methods produce high performance with dependence on the information of entities learned in the training phase  [ref]37.\nAlthough those methods show better performance on the benchmark, their ability of generalization for large-scaled KGs is limited compared to the inductive methods.\nThe experimental results are summarized in Table 6.\nOur method shows prominent performance among rule learning methods on FB15K-237 dataset, while it only presents competitive results on WN18RR dataset.\nThis is because our method focuses on pruning the search space of rule discovery procedure.\nFor a complex dataset like FB15K-237 (237 relations), the search space is relatively large and the advantages of our method are prominent.\nHowever, for a relatively simple dataset like WN18RR (11 relations), the search space is relatively small and the utility of our method is limited.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: The second set of experiments aim to evaluate the quality of mined rules of our approach.\nPrevious works  [ref]31 evaluated the quality of mined rules by examining the new facts they discover.\nFollow that criterion, we first evaluate the discovered new facts of mined rules in DBpedia and Wikidata, and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
