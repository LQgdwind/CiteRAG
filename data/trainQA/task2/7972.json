      "content": "Paper Title: Evaluating Large Language Models with Grid-Based Game Competitions: An Extensible LLM Benchmark and Leaderboard\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLLMs produce outputs such that their responses can vary even with identical input . Traditional metrics like accuracy, precision, F1 score, and mean squared error (MSE) are not suitable for evaluating LLM performance. Instead, specialized datasets and benchmarks are needed to assess LLM capabilities comprehensively . Benchmarks such as GLUE , SuperGLUE , HELM [ref]20, MMLU [ref]21, BIG-bench , ARC , TruthfulQA , HellaSwag , and LiveBench [ref]26 provide diverse tasks that test various aspects of LLMs. GLUE, introduced in 2018, includes tasks like sentiment analysis and question-answering to evaluate natural language understanding. SuperGLUE, launched in 2019, extends GLUE with more demanding tasks such as multi-sentence reasoning and complex reading comprehension. The Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark tests LLMs across a wide array of subjects, including mathematics, history, computer science, and law, requiring extensive world knowledge and problem-solving abilities [ref]21. BIG-bench offers 204 varied tasks in areas such as linguistics, mathematics, reasoning, biology, and software development, allowing researchers to evaluate LLMs comprehensively while managing operational costs . HELM emphasizes transparency and performance in specific tasks, using a multi-metric approach that includes fairness, bias, and toxicity assessments. It continually adapts to add new scenarios, metrics, and models [ref]20. The AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence assesses AI systemsâ€™ complex reasoning capabilities through multiple-choice questions. The ARC includes an Easy Set for basic retrieval methods and a Challenge Set for advanced reasoning, pushing AI towards deeper knowledge-based understanding . The TruthfulQA benchmark assesses the accuracy and truthfulness of LLM responses, specifically designed to measure how well models can generate accurate answers and avoid hallucinations . The HellaSwag benchmark tests common sense reasoning by presenting models with sentences and multiple possible endings, requiring them to choose the most logical continuation . LiveBench addresses the test set contamination issue in LLM evaluation by offering a benchmark immune to such contamination and biases from human or LLM judging [ref]26. It features frequently updated questions from recent sources, automatic scoring against objective ground-truth values, and diverse tasks spanning math, coding, reasoning, language, instruction following, and data analysis [ref]26. The recent survey papers have provided comprehensive frameworks and methodologies that are invaluable for developing robust benchmarks. One such paper, \"A Survey on Evaluation of Large Language Models,\" presents a detailed review focusing on three key dimensions: what to evaluate, where to evaluate, and how to evaluate . It encompasses a broad spectrum of tasks, including general natural language processing, reasoning, medical applications, ethics, education, and more. This survey emphasizes the critical role of evaluation methods and benchmarks in assessing LLM performance, summarizing both successes and failures across different tasks, and highlighting future challenges in the field . Similarly, \"Evaluating Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey\" categorizes LLM evaluation into knowledge and capability, alignment, and safety . This survey underscores the importance of rigorous assessment and the development of comprehensive evaluation platforms to ensure the safe and beneficial development of LLMs. It aims to guide responsible LLM advancement, ensuring that their evolution maximizes societal benefits while minimizing potential risks . Both surveys stress the necessity of treating evaluation as an essential discipline to aid the development of more proficient and ethically sound LLMs .\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: (MSE) are not suitable for evaluating LLM performance.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
