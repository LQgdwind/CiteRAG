      "content": "Paper Title: CCGL: Contrastive Cascade Graph Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith data augmentation for cascade graph in place, we now introduce the CCGL framework for learning generalized cascade representations without label supervision. Data augmentation.\nWe first use one of the augmentation strategies to create related views of the same cascade graph. Given 𝒢isubscript𝒢𝑖\\mathcal{G}_{i}, we augment this graph twice to create two different but similar views, denoted as 𝒢~i1superscriptsubscript~𝒢𝑖1\\tilde{\\mathcal{G}}_{i}^{1} and 𝒢~i2superscriptsubscript~𝒢𝑖2\\tilde{\\mathcal{G}}_{i}^{2}. These two augmented graphs are considered as a positive pair (𝒢~i1,𝒢~i2)superscriptsubscript~𝒢𝑖1superscriptsubscript~𝒢𝑖2(\\tilde{\\mathcal{G}}_{i}^{1},\\tilde{\\mathcal{G}}_{i}^{2}) in the subsequent contrastive learning. Cascade graph encoding.\nWe then encode to represent a cascade graph to a vector while capturing temporal and structural information in the graph. The choice of cascade graph encoder is not confined to a particular approach. Any encoder that can map the sparse cascade graph into a dense representation vector is qualified. We employ a graph encoder from a state-of-the-art cascade prediction model VaCas [ref]14, which has two main components: (i) a graph embedding based on spectral graph wavelets;\nand (ii) a bi-directional GRU-based network to learn contextualized user behaviors in cascade data. Note that this model is equivalent to Cas-RNN as described in [ref]14.\nThese two components map the cascade graph 𝒢isubscript𝒢𝑖\\mathcal{G}_{i} to a fixed-length representation 𝐡i∈ℝd𝐡subscript𝐡𝑖superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝐡\\mathbf{h}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathbf{h}}}. To further understand the relations among latent factors and avoid possible noises in representation, we follow a prior study [ref]23 and add a MLP-based projection head to project 𝐡isubscript𝐡𝑖\\mathbf{h}_{i} to a new representation 𝐳i∈ℝd𝐳subscript𝐳𝑖superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝐳\\mathbf{z}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathbf{z}}}. This has been demonstrated a significant improvement for some applications  , as well as ours. We experiment with different designs of projection head (cf. Section 5.4). Note that the projection head only takes part in an unsupervised learning stage, i.e., we still use 𝐡isubscript𝐡𝑖\\mathbf{h}_{i} for subsequent downstream task fine-tuning, and use 𝐳isubscript𝐳𝑖\\mathbf{z}_{i} for computing the contrastive loss and optimizing the CCGL framework. Contrastive loss.\nIn order to train our CCGL framework, following [ref]23, the contrastive learning loss is defined to maximize the latent similarity between two augmented views of the same cascade graph, and discriminate between a positive pair (𝒢~i1,𝒢~i2)superscriptsubscript~𝒢𝑖1superscriptsubscript~𝒢𝑖2(\\tilde{\\mathcal{G}}_{i}^{1},\\tilde{\\mathcal{G}}_{i}^{2}) and all other negative pairs in a mini-batch.\nSpecifically, CCGL first randomly samples B𝐵B cascade graphs, and then augments each graph twice to obtain 2​B2𝐵2B augmented cascade graphs. For a pair of positive graphs in a mini-batch, we leave the remaining 2​B−22𝐵22B-2 cascade graphs as negative samples. Given a similarity function sim​(⋅,⋅)sim⋅⋅\\text{sim}(\\cdot,\\cdot) over two vectors (in our case the cosine similarity), the contrastive loss function for a positive pair (𝒢~i1,𝒢~i2)superscriptsubscript~𝒢𝑖1superscriptsubscript~𝒢𝑖2(\\tilde{\\mathcal{G}}_{i}^{1},\\tilde{\\mathcal{G}}_{i}^{2}) is defined as: where 𝟙​(⋅)1⋅\\mathds{1}(\\cdot) is an indicator function, τ𝜏\\tau is a temperature parameter.\nThis contrastive loss function for unsupervised learning is noted as InfoNCE  or NT-Xent [ref]23, that has been widely used in previous SSL models [ref]16  . During pre-training, positive samples (two new views drawn from the original cascade graph) are attracted together in the representation space, while negative samples are repelled away from positive samples. In this way, we learn cascade graph representations in an abstract way, without linking them to any specific downstream task labels/signals. Discussion of loss mechanism.\nSince contrastive learning often requires a large number of negative samples to contrast, maintaining larger mini-batches/dictionaries and building larger network architectures are non-economic and limited by computational resources, although improve the model performance. For example, SimCLR [ref]23 uses a batch size as large as 8,192 (with 16,382 negative samples per positive pair) in a platform of 128 TPU v3 cores. The learning ability of end-to-end models is constrained by batch sizes. Some of them rely on special pretext tasks, which may change the network architecture, such as constraining the receptive field size  , patching the graph into sub-structures , and limiting their generalization performance.\nMemory bank  and momentum update [ref]16 are another line of contrastive mechanisms that decouple the number of negative samples from the mini-batch size, while providing smooth and consistent encoder update.\nPrevious works have discussed the impact of end-to-end and memory mechanisms. For example, [ref]16 found that end-to-end models have competitive performance when the batch size is small.  and  concluded that memory mechanism only provides marginal improvement when a large batch size is used. However, larger mini-batch requires more GPU/TPU memory and longer training time.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: approach. Any encoder that can map the sparse cascade graph into a dense representation vector is qualified. We employ a graph encoder from a state-of-the-art cascade prediction model VaCas [ref]14, which has two main components: (i) a graph embedding based on spectral graph wavelets;\nand (ii) a bi-directional GRU-based network to learn contextualized user behaviors in cascade data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
