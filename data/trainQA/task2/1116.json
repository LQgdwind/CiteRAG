      "content": "Paper Title: Less is More: Data-Efficient Complex Question Answering over Knowledge Bases\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe NS-CQA model is inspired by two lines of work: semantic parsing and neural-symbolic systems.\nSemantic parsing mainly focuses on reformulating natural language questions into logic forms, which are then executed on knowledge bases (KBs) to compute answers¬†  .\nMore recent approaches employ sophisticated deep learning models to search entities and predicates that are most relevant to the question¬†[ref]21  . Many of these works tackle simple one-hop questions that are answerable by a single triple.\nOthers address the multi-hop task, in which answers are entities that can be retrieved by a path of connected triples.\nIn both cases, a model only retrieves entities as answers in a fixed search space, i.e., the KB.\nOur model addresses a more challenging problem, where answers come from a much larger search space, involving not only entities in the KB but also their logical combinations and aggregations (numbers). The complex KBQA dataset, such as CQA¬†, requires the execution of discrete actions rather than merely searching for entities in KB.\nMemory network¬†    is used to store facts in KB and makes it possible to solve complex questions.\nLuo et¬†al.  encodes complex questions into vectors to represent the semantics and structure of the input sentence contemporaneously, by which the similarity between the question and the graph could be computed.\nDialog-to-Action (D2A)¬† incorporates dialog memory management in generating logical forms that would be executed on a large KBs to answer complex questions.\nIt labels all training samples with pseudo-gold actions and trains the model by imitation learning.\nIt is worth noting that D2A aims to answer context-dependent questions, where each question is part of a multiple-round conversation.\nOn the other hand, in this paper, we consider answering the single-turn questions.\nTherefore we do not include D2A as a baseline method in the evaluation as it is not directly comparable to our problem setup.\nThe semantic parsing approaches mentioned so far all require the annotation of the entire training dataset to learn the models.\nDifferent from these approaches, our model can be learned from a small number of pseudo-gold annotations only. Some recent studies in KBQA focus on semi-supervised learning, in which models are trained solely on denotations, e.g., the execution results of queries, the state of the final time step, etc.\nIn¬†, a semantic parser is trained by learning from question-answer pairs rather than annotated logical forms to query the knowledge graph.\nFurthermore, the parser could be trained without manual annotations or question-answer pairs by treating denotations of natural language questions and related KB queries as weak-supervision¬†[ref]29.\nSimilarly, queries automatically generated from knowledge graph triples and paraphrased questions without answers are used in weak-supervision to train subgraph embedding models¬†.\nTo fully understand the intention of questions, STAGG¬†[ref]5 is proposed to generate a staged query graph and directly map the graph into ŒªùúÜ\\lambda-calculus. Neural-symbolic models integrate neural networks with logic-based symbolic executors to conduct non-differentiable computations.\nNeural Turing Machines (NTMs)¬† pioneer the neural-symbolic methods, in which REINFORCE is employed to train the model in the RL Neural Turing Machines (RL-NTMs)¬†.\nWhen answering natural language questions on relational tables, some approaches¬†  predict discrete symbolic operations by neural networks and obtain answers by executing them.\nGuu et¬†al.  marry RL and maximum marginal likelihood (MML) to avert the spurious problems.\nThe neural-symbolic visual question answering (NS-VQA) system¬† combines deep representation learning and symbolic program execution to solve visual question answering problems over a synthetic image dataset. Most relevant to this work are two state-of-the-art techniques on complex KBQA: Neural Symbolic Machines (NSM)¬† and CIPITR¬†.\nNSM deals with multi-hop questions in the WebQuestionsSP dataset¬†7 with two components: the programmer and the computer.\nBy employing an EM-like mechanism, NSM iteratively finds the pseudo-gold trials for the training questions.\nNSM then assigns the pseudo-gold trials with a deterministic probability, therefore, to anchor the model to the high-reward trials.\nIn a similar vein, CIPITR translates a natural-language complex question into a multi-step executable program using the Neural Program Induction (NPI) technique.\nCIPITR does not require gold annotations and can learn from auxiliary rewards, KB schema, and inferred answer types. Our neural-symbolic model is different from them in that we augment our RL-based model with a memory buffer to record the successful trials.\nWith the help of the memory buffer, we could compute the extra reward bonus to encourage the model to generate new trials, imitate successful trials, and reshape the sparse reward to provide dense feedback.\nAs can be seen in Table¬†3, our NS-CQA model outperforms all the baseline models, and the performance difference is prominent on the more complex categories of questions.\nAlso, in Table¬†4, we can find that NS-CQA is better than other baseline models.\nThe superiority of NS-CQA in both the datasets verified the effectiveness and generalization ability of the model.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: executed on knowledge bases (KBs) to compute answers¬†  .\nMore recent approaches employ sophisticated deep learning models to search entities and predicates that are most relevant to the question¬†[ref]21  . Many of these works tackle simple one-hop questions that are answerable by a single triple.\nOthers address the multi-hop task, in which answers are entities that can be retrieved by a path\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
