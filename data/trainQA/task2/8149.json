Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: \\system: Blockchain Fault Tolerance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe impairments and remedies of dependability of software systems have been studied for more than four decades  [ref]43. In particular, various books discuss reliability of distributed systems as programming abstraction  or to provide high assurance to applications . A long series of work studied in particular the Byzantine fault tolerance  as the tolerance to arbitrary failures.\nIt is more recently that blockchain security flaws   were identified and that the research community started studying blockchain dependability [ref]49. A long series of blockchain security vulnerabilities can now be found in surveys and books   . Interestingly, two recent works  \nobserved vulnerabilities in\nthe only two blockchains, Avalanche and Solana, that failed during our experiments.\nFirst, a theoretical analysis of Avalanche consensus protocols, Snowball and Snowflake, indicate that they do not offer a “decent” trade-off between security and performance .\nSecond, previous experiments showed that Solana could fork permanently , however, our observation is different as we noticed that all the nodes of Solana crash after an injection of transient communication delays. Unfortunately, as of today there is no tool\nthat allows to systematically compare the fault tolerance of blockchain systems.\nMost blockchain evaluation frameworks are focused on performance in fault-free executions     .\nThey usually measure the latency and throughput of blockchain systems in ideal executions but do not automate the injection of faults to study the sensitivity of these blockchain systems.\nAlthough recent blockchain results were found after injecting crash faults  or Byzantine faults [ref]52 in blockchain executions, these injections are typically tailored for a specific blockchain design.\nSome results focus exclusively on Byzantine consensus  and ignore other components of a blockchain system.\nOther results consider fuzzing    but require the blockchain code to be analyzed and instumented, making the approach hard to maintain.\nAs these results do not consider blockchains as blackboxes they cannot be used to compare the fault tolerance of different blockchains on the same ground.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: The impairments and remedies of dependability of software systems have been studied for more than four decades  [ref]43.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
