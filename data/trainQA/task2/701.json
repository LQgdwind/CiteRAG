      "content": "Paper Title: Improving One-stage Visual Grounding by Recursive Sub-query Construction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExperiment settings.\nTable 1 reports visual grounding results on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg (the upper table), and ReferItGame, Flickr30K Entities (the lower table). The top part of each table contain results of the state-of-the-art two-stage visual grounding methods [ref]29     [ref]27      . The “Feature” column lists the backbone and pretrained dataset used for proposal feature extraction. COCO-trained Faster-RCNN  detector is used for region proposal generation for the experiments on RefCOCO , RefCOCO+  and RefCOCOg [ref]29. We quote the two-stage methods’ results on ReferItGame and Flickr30K Entities reported by SSG  and One-Stage-BERT [ref]47 where Edgebox 3 is used for proposal generation. The bottom part of Table 1 compares the performance of our method to other state-of-the-art one-stage methods   [ref]47. The “Feature” column shows the adopted visual backbone and its pretrained dataset, if any. For a fair comparison, we modify One-Stage-BERT [ref]47 to have the exact same training details as ours, and observe a small accuracy improvement by the modification. Specifically, we 1). encode the query as the averaged BERT word embedding instead of the BERT sentence embedding at the first token’s position ([CLS]delimited-[]CLS\\left[\\textrm{CLS}\\right]), 2). remove the feature pyramid network, and 3). follow the implementation details in Section 4.2. We refer to the modified version “One-Stage-BERT*.” Other than the state-of-the-art, we design and compare to additional alternatives to our methods such as “single/ multi-head attention query modeling,” “per-word sub-query,” etc., in Section 4.5 and Table 3. We obtain our main results by the method described in Section 3 and refer to it as “Ours-Base” in Table 1. Furthermore, we observe that a larger input image size of 512512512 and a ConvLSTM   grounding module increase the accuracy, but meanwhile slightly slow the inference speed. We refer to the corresponding model as “Ours-Large” and analyze each modification in supplementary materials. Visual grounding results.\nOur proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art one-stage grounding methods [ref]47   by over 5%percent55\\% absolute accuracy on all experimented datasets. The two-stage methods  [ref]27     also show good performance on COCO-series datasets (i.e., RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg) by using the COCO-trained detector . For example, we notice that MAttNet  achieves comparable performance with our best model in RefCOCO+, though our best model obviously surpasses MAttNet on RefCOCO, RefCOCOg, and the testB of RefCOCO+. However, in the ReferItGame dataset, as listed in the lower part of Table 1, MAttNet’s accuracy drops dramatically. The findings of previous one-stage work  [ref]47  show that two-stage visual grounding methods rely highly on the region proposals quality.\nSince RefCOCO/ RefCOCO+/ RefCOCOg are subsets of COCO and have shared images and objects, the COCO-trained detector generates nearly perfect region proposals on COCO-series datasets. When used in other datasets, e.g., ReferItGame and Flickr30K Entities datasets, their proposal quality and grounding accuracy drop, such as the MAttNet’s degraded performance in ReferItGame. Nonetheless, our method performs stably across all datasets and, meanwhile being significantly faster. Inference time.\nThe real-time inference speed is one major advantage of the one-stage visual grounding method. We conduct all the experiments on a single NVIDIA 1080TI GPU. We observe our method achieves a real-time inference speed of 26​m​s26𝑚𝑠26ms. The method is more than 101010 times faster than typical two-stage methods such as the MattNet  of 320​m​s320𝑚𝑠320ms.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg (the upper table), and ReferItGame, Flickr30K Entities (the lower table).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
