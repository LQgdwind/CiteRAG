The semi-regularity is characterized by equivalent conditions in Proposition 2.1.2 below.\nIn particular, the fourth condition enables us to compute the Hilbert–Poincaré series of each A(i)superscript𝐴𝑖A^{(i)}. With notation as above, the following are equivalent: The sequence (f1,…,fm)subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}) is semi-regular. For each 1≤i≤m1𝑖𝑚1\\leq i\\leq m and for each t≥di𝑡subscript𝑑𝑖t\\geq d_{i}, the multiplication map ψfi|At−di(i−1)evaluated-atsubscript𝜓subscript𝑓𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝐴𝑖1𝑡subscript𝑑𝑖\\psi_{f_{i}}|_{A^{(i-1)}_{t-d_{i}}} is injective or surjective, namely dimKAt(i)=max⁡{0,dimKAt(i−1)−dimKAt−di(i−1)}subscriptdimension𝐾subscriptsuperscript𝐴𝑖𝑡0subscriptdimension𝐾subscriptsuperscript𝐴𝑖1𝑡subscriptdimension𝐾subscriptsuperscript𝐴𝑖1𝑡subscript𝑑𝑖\\dim_{K}A^{(i)}_{t}=\\max\\{0,\\dim_{K}A^{(i-1)}_{t}-\\dim_{K}A^{(i-1)}_{t-d_{i}}\\}.

When K𝐾K is an infinite field, Pardue also conjectured in [34, Conjecture B] that generic polynomial sequences are semi-regular. We next review the notion of cryptographic semi-regular sequence, which is defined by a condition weaker than one for semi-regular sequence.\nThe notion of cryptographic semi-regular sequence is introduced first by Bardet et al. (e.g., , [ref]3) motivated to analyze the complexity of computing Gröbner bases.\nDiem  also formulated cryptographic semi-regular sequences, in terms of commutative and homological algebra.\nThe terminology “cryptographic” was named by Bigdeli et al. in their recent work , in order to distinguish such a sequence from a semi-regular one defined by Pardue (see Definition 2.1.1). Let f1,…,fm∈Rsubscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚𝑅f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}\\in R be homogeneous polynomials of positive degrees d1,…,dmsubscript𝑑1…subscript𝑑𝑚d_{1},\\ldots,d_{m} respectively, and put I=⟨f1,…,fm⟩R𝐼subscriptsubscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚𝑅I=\\langle f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}\\rangle_{R}.\nFor each integer d𝑑d with d≥max​{di:1≤i≤m}𝑑maxconditional-setsubscript𝑑𝑖1𝑖𝑚d\\geq\\mathrm{max}\\{d_{i}:1\\leq i\\leq m\\}, we say that a sequence (f1,…,fm)subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}) is d𝑑d-regular if it satisfies the following condition: For each i𝑖i with 1≤i≤m1𝑖𝑚1\\leq i\\leq m, if a homogeneous polynomial g∈R𝑔𝑅g\\in R satisfies g​fi∈⟨f1,…,fi−1⟩R𝑔subscript𝑓𝑖subscriptsubscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑖1𝑅gf_{i}\\in\\langle f_{1},\\ldots,f_{i-1}\\rangle_{R} and deg​(g​fi)<ddeg𝑔subscript𝑓𝑖𝑑\\mathrm{deg}(gf_{i})<d, then we have g∈⟨f1,…,fi−1⟩R𝑔subscriptsubscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑖1𝑅g\\in\\langle f_{1},\\ldots,f_{i-1}\\rangle_{R}.\nIn other word, the multiplication map At−di(i−1)⟶At(i−1);g↦g​fiformulae-sequence⟶subscriptsuperscript𝐴𝑖1𝑡subscript𝑑𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝐴𝑖1𝑡maps-to𝑔𝑔subscript𝑓𝑖A^{(i-1)}_{t-d_{i}}\\longrightarrow A^{(i-1)}_{t}\\ ;\\ g\\mapsto gf_{i} is injective for every t𝑡t with di≤t<dsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑑d_{i}\\leq t<d. Diem  determined the (truncated) Hilbert series of d𝑑d-regular sequences as in the following proposition: With the same notation as in Definition 2.1.3, the following are equivalent for each d𝑑d with d≥max​{di:1≤i≤m}𝑑maxconditional-setsubscript𝑑𝑖1𝑖𝑚d\\geq\\mathrm{max}\\{d_{i}:1\\leq i\\leq m\\}: The sequence (f1,…,fm)subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}) is d𝑑d-regular.\nNamely, for each (i,t)𝑖𝑡(i,t) with 1≤i≤m1𝑖𝑚1\\leq i\\leq m and di≤t<dsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑑d_{i}\\leq t<d, the equality dimKAt(i)=dimKAt(i−1)−dimKAt−di(i−1)subscriptdimension𝐾subscriptsuperscript𝐴𝑖𝑡subscriptdimension𝐾subscriptsuperscript𝐴𝑖1𝑡subscriptdimension𝐾subscriptsuperscript𝐴𝑖1𝑡subscript𝑑𝑖\\dim_{K}A^{(i)}_{t}=\\dim_{K}A^{(i-1)}_{t}-\\dim_{K}A^{(i-1)}_{t-d_{i}} holds.\n We have H1​(K∙​(f1,…,fm))≤d−1=0subscript𝐻1subscriptsubscript𝐾∙subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚absent𝑑10H_{1}(K_{\\bullet}(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}))_{\\leq d-1}=0. With the same notation as in Definition 2.1.3, let D𝐷D and i𝑖i be natural numbers.\nAssume that  Hi​(K​(f1,…,fm))≤D=0subscript𝐻𝑖subscript𝐾subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚absent𝐷0H_{i}(K(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}))_{\\leq D}=0.\nThen, for each j𝑗j with 1≤j<m1𝑗𝑚1\\leq j<m, we have\n Hi​(K​(f1,…,fj))≤D=0subscript𝐻𝑖subscript𝐾subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑗absent𝐷0H_{i}(K(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{j}))_{\\leq D}=0. A finitely generated graded R𝑅R-module M𝑀M is said to be Artinian if there exists a sufficiently large D∈ℤ𝐷ℤD\\in\\mathbb{Z} such that Md=0subscript𝑀𝑑0M_{d}=0 for all d≥D𝑑𝐷d\\geq D. For a homogeneous ideal I𝐼I of R𝑅R, we define its degree of regularity dreg​(I)subscript𝑑reg𝐼d_{\\rm reg}(I) as follows:\nIf the finitely generated graded R𝑅R-module R/I𝑅𝐼R/I is Artinian, we set dreg​(I):=min​{d:Rd=Id}assignsubscript𝑑reg𝐼minconditional-set𝑑subscript𝑅𝑑subscript𝐼𝑑d_{\\rm reg}(I):=\\mathrm{min}\\{d:R_{d}=I_{d}\\}, and otherwise we set dreg​(I):=∞assignsubscript𝑑reg𝐼d_{\\rm reg}(I):=\\infty. As for an upper-bound on the degree of regularity, we refer to [21, Theorem 21]. In Definition 2.1.7, since R/I𝑅𝐼R/I is Noetherian, it is Artinian if and only if it is of finite length.\nIn this case, the degree of regularity dreg​(I)subscript𝑑reg𝐼d_{\\rm reg}(I) is equal to the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity reg​(I)reg𝐼\\mathrm{reg}(I) of I𝐼I (see e.g., [15, §20.5] for the definition), whence dreg​(I)=reg​(I)=reg​(R/I)+1subscript𝑑reg𝐼reg𝐼reg𝑅𝐼1d_{\\rm reg}(I)=\\mathrm{reg}(I)=\\mathrm{reg}(R/I)+1. A sequence (f1,…,fm)∈(R∖K)msubscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚superscript𝑅𝐾𝑚(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m})\\in(R\\smallsetminus K)^{m} of homogeneous polynomials is said to be cryptographic semi-regular if it is dreg​(I)subscript𝑑reg𝐼d_{\\rm reg}(I)-regular, where we set I=⟨f1,…,fm⟩R𝐼subscriptsubscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚𝑅I=\\langle f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}\\rangle_{R}. The cryptographic semi-regularity is characterized by equivalent conditions in Proposition 2.1.10 below. With the same notation as in Definition 2.1.3, we put D=dreg​(I)𝐷subscript𝑑reg𝐼D=d_{\\rm reg}(I).\nThen, the following are equivalent: (f1,…,fm)∈(R∖K)msubscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚superscript𝑅𝐾𝑚(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m})\\in(R\\smallsetminus K)^{m} is cryptographic semi-regular. We have H1​(K∙​(f1,…,fm))≤D−1=0subscript𝐻1subscriptsubscript𝐾∙subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚absent𝐷10H_{1}(K_{\\bullet}(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}))_{\\leq D-1}=0. By the definition of degree of regularity, if (f1,…,fm)subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}) is cryptographic semi-regular, then dreg​(I)subscript𝑑reg𝐼d_{\\rm reg}(I) coincides with deg⁡(HSR/I​(z))+1degreesubscriptHS𝑅𝐼𝑧1\\deg({\\rm HS}_{R/I}(z))+1, where we set I=⟨f1,…,fm⟩R𝐼subscriptsubscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚𝑅I=\\langle f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}\\rangle_{R}. In 1985, Fröberg had already conjectured in 0 that, when K𝐾K is an infinite field, a generic sequence of homogeneous polynomials f1,…,fm∈Rsubscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚𝑅f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}\\in R of degrees d1,…,dmsubscript𝑑1…subscript𝑑𝑚d_{1},\\ldots,d_{m} generates an ideal I𝐼I with the Hilbert–Poincaré series of the form (2.1.2), namely (f1,…,fm)subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}) is cryptographic semi-regular.\nIt can be proved (cf. ) that Fröberg’s conjecture is equivalent to Pardue’s one [34, Conjecture B].\nWe also note that Moreno-Socías conjecture  is stronger than the above two conjectures, see [34, Theorem 2] for a proof. It follows from the fourth condition of Proposition 2.1.2 together with the second condition of Proposition 2.1.10 that the semi-regularity implies the cryptographic semi-regularity.\nNote that, when m≤n𝑚𝑛m\\leq n, both ‘semi-regular’ and ‘cryptographic semi-regular’ are equivalent to ‘regular’. Finally, we define an affine semi-regular sequence. A sequence 𝑭=(f1,…,fm)∈(R∖K)m𝑭subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚superscript𝑅𝐾𝑚\\bm{F}=(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m})\\in(R\\smallsetminus K)^{m} of not necessarily homogeneous polynomials f1,…,fmsubscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m} is said to be semi-regular (resp. cryptographic semi-regular) if 𝑭top=(f1top,…,fmtop)superscript𝑭topsuperscriptsubscript𝑓1top…superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑚top\\bm{F}^{\\rm top}=(f_{1}^{\\rm top},\\ldots,f_{m}^{\\rm top}) is semi-regular (resp. cryptographic semi-regular).\nIn this case, we call F𝐹F an affine semi-regular (resp. affine cryptographic semi-regular) sequence.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: semi-regular sequence, which is defined by a condition weaker than one for semi-regular sequence.\nThe notion of cryptographic semi-regular sequence is introduced first by Bardet et al. (e.g., , [ref]3) motivated to analyze the complexity of computing Gröbner bases.\nDiem  also formulated cryptographic semi-regular sequences, in terms of commutative and homological algebra.\nThe terminology\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
