      "content": "Paper Title: On the Intersection of Signal Processing and Machine Learning: A Use Case-Driven Analysis Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs mentioned earlier, the process of signal denoising involves eliminating noise while preserving the important features of the signal. The first step in signal processing-ML pipelines is to remove noise and outliers. Thus, the effectiveness of subsequent steps depends heavily on the efficiency of the employed signal denoising technique. For impulse and burst noise, Order-Statistic Filtering (OSF)  is particularly effective; it is based on replacing each sample in the signal with a statistic (like the median, minimum, or maximum) calculated from the samples in its neighborhood, defined by a sliding window of a certain size that moves across the signal. The median filter    , a specific type of OSF, is widely used to remove impulsive noise. OSF is highly robust to outliers such as impulse noise since order statistics are less sensitive to extreme values than linear operations such as averaging. Moreover, the median filter is highly effective in preserving signal edges (sudden changes in signal amplitude) while reducing noise, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the signal’s features. The efficiency of the median filter is significantly influenced by the selection of the window size. A larger window size will include more samples, improving the ability to remove impulsive noise. However, a larger window could over-smooth the signal, potentially erasing important details. Further, it will increase the computational burden. Conversely, a smaller window size preserves more detail since fewer samples are involved in determining the median, but it may be less effective in removing noise as the median value will be influenced by the presence of noise in the window. Additionally, the performance of median filters is limited by the proportion of impulsive noise in the window. Filtering performance decreases as the proportion of impulsive noise increases . Specifically, with low levels of impulsive noise, the noise spikes are likely to be the minority within the window, and the median value computed within the window is likely to be a true signal value, effectively removing the noise. As the proportion of impulsive noise increases, there’s a higher likelihood that the median value computed within the window will itself be a noise value, especially if the noise spikes constitute a considerable part of the samples in the window. In this case, replacing the original signal sample with the median does not remove the noise. Instead, it might even introduce additional distortion, especially if the median value is a noise spike. To overcome these problems, adaptive median filtering is commonly applied where the window size changes adaptively based on impulsive noise content   . For complex noise patterns such as intermittent and continuous noise, several techniques can be used to denoise the signal in the time domain, frequency domain, time-frequency domain, or deep learning (DL) latent space. Time-domain methods involve techniques that directly manipulate the signal in the time domain, aiming to identify and reduce noise components while preserving signal characteristics. Moving average (MA) filter   is a simple yet effective method that smooths the signal by averaging neighboring data points. It is particularly useful for reducing simple random noise while preserving the signal’s shape. Traditional MA filters operate by averaging a set of signal data points (referred to as the window or kernel) and sliding this window across the signal. This process smooths out short-term fluctuations, effectively reducing random noise. However, the primary limitation of a traditional moving average filter is its fixed window size, which may not be optimal for all signal conditions. Adaptive moving average (AMA) filters    address this limitation by dynamically adjusting the window size based on the characteristics of the input signal. Here, the window size changes in response to the variability or other statistical properties of the signal. This adaptivity is critical when dealing with nonstationary signals or when the noise characteristics are inconsistent throughout the signal. The design of the adaptive mechanism involves selecting proper criteria for window size adjustment. Common approaches include the use of local signal variance, rate of change, or other statistical measures that reflect the signal’s nature. The Savitzky-Golay filter (SGF)    While it shares some conceptual similarities with MA filters, it provides a different approach to noise reduction and is particularly useful for preserving higher-order signal properties. Specifically, MA filters give equal weight to all points in the window, which can distort the features of the signal. On the other hand, SGF performs a local polynomial regression on the signal data points present in the moving window to provide a more nuanced smoothing that preserves the original shape and characteristics of the signal. This approach not only smooths the data but also preserves features of the data points, such as relative maxima, minima, and width, which are often obscured by noise. The design of an SGF involves the proper selection of the window size, and the order of the polynomial    . The selection depends on the specific characteristics of the signal being processed and the nature of the noise. A higher polynomial order can better adapt to changes in the signal’s trend, but it may also introduce noise if not chosen appropriately. Adaptive filters leverage adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) techniques to instantly isolate and remove unwanted noise from the signal, making them suitable for real-time applications such as autonomous driving, navigation, control systems, and robotics. ANC involves dynamically adjusting the filter parameters to minimize the difference between the desired signal (primary signal of interest) and the actual signal; the primary goal is to improve the SNR without distorting the primary signal. Common ANC techniques involve the least mean square (LMS) and recursive least square (RLS) adaptive filters    , and Kalman filtering (KF)    . LMS adaptive filtering, a gradient-based method, attempts to minimize the mean square error between the desired and actual output of the filter. To facilitate the generation of an estimate of the unwanted noise, this process entails using a reference signal, highly correlated with the noise contaminating the primary signal and uncorrelated with the primary signal itself. The RLS algorithm provides a recursive solution to the least-squares problem, offering faster convergence than LMS. In contrast to LMS and RLM, which require a prior reference signal, KF estimates the state of the system, represented by the signal of interest, based on noisy measurements. The estimation is based on Bayesian estimation and state-space representation of linear systems , making KF particularly useful in real-time applications involving time-varying signals or systems with inherent uncertainties. KF consists of two main steps: prediction and update. In the prediction phase, KF predicts the next state of the system. In the update phase, the prediction is adjusted using the new measurement data, refining the system’s state estimate. In the context of noise reduction, this process inherently filters out the noise from the measurements, isolating the primary signal. Standard KF assumes that noise is Gaussian and the system has linear dynamics. However, several extensions have been developed to handle more complex scenarios. Such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) . However, the design of KF requires a good understanding of system dynamics and noise characteristics. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA), which is a well-known method to decompose time series into trends, seasonal components, and noise, has been explored within the signal processing field for signal denoising applications        due to its effectiveness in separating useful oscillatory components from noisy signals. SSA works by embedding a signal in multidimensional space, constructing a trajectory matrix by sliding a window over the signal data points. The trajectory matrix is then decomposed using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which separates the signal into a series of matrices associated with singular values. These matrices represent different signal components, including deterministic structures and stochastic noise. Accordingly, the decomposed components are classified into groups that represent the signal and noise, respectively. This involves evaluating singular values and the corresponding eigenvectors to differentiate between signal information and noise components. The denoised signal is then reconstructed by summing the respective groups of matrices that contain signal information. Subsequently, the reconstructed components are transformed back into the time domain. The effective implementation of SSA in the context of signal denoising involves two main aspects: Selecting an appropriate window length and accurately grouping singular values and eigenvectors corresponding to signal information and noise components. These aspects are pivotal as they directly influence the quality and reliability of the signal-denoising process. The choice of window length determines the structure of the trajectory matrix and subsequently affects the decomposition and reconstruction phases. An appropriately chosen length ensures that the resulting trajectory matrix captures the underlying structure of the signal, effectively separating signal components and noise. A window length that is extremely short may not capture the signal’s dynamics adequately, while a window length that is too long may reduce denoising efficiency and increase computational complexity. However, selecting an optimal length is not straightforward; it is highly dependent on the specific characteristics of the signal, including periodicity and stationarity . In practice, selecting an appropriate window length depends on prior knowledge of signals of interest and often ultimately relies on experimentation   where empirical or heuristic methods are often employed to determine a suitable window length for a specific application. Additionally, the accurate grouping of decomposed components is fundamental for effective signal denoising as misclassification of these components can lead to either an inadequate removal of noise or the unintended discarding of useful signal information. There is no general rule for the grouping process; it is mainly determined by the specific requirements of the application, the statistical nature of the signal of interest, and associated noise . Frequency-domain noise reduction is based on the signal’s frequency content, where noise is often more distinguishable due to its distinct spectral characteristics. Common frequency-domain techniques involve frequency-selective filtering and spectral subtraction (SS). Frequency-selective filters include low-pass   , high-pass   , band-pass  , and notch filters (band-stop)  . These filters attenuate noise components that are outside the primary frequency range. Specifically, low-pass filters allow components with frequencies lower than their defined cutoff frequency to pass through while attenuating components with frequencies higher than the cutoff. Conversely, high-pass filters perform the opposite operation, blocking frequencies below the cutoff. Band-pass filters pass frequencies within a certain range and attenuate frequencies outside that range. Notch filters attenuate specified narrow frequency bands. Frequency-selective filtering techniques are useful in applications where noisy frequency characteristics are known, such as noise caused by power-line and equipment interference. SS         relies on estimating the noise spectrum and subtracting it from the noisy signal’s spectrum. In contrast to frequency-selective filtering, which eliminates specific frequencies in the signal spectrum, SS provides global spectrum denoising mechanisms. The main steps in SS involve estimating the power spectrum of noise and subtracting it from the power spectrum of the original signal to obtain a new power spectrum. Negative values are eliminated by setting them to zero. The new power spectrum is combined with the phase of the original signal to reconstruct the denoised signal’s time waveform. The noise spectrum is commonly estimated and updated during signal-inactivity periods where only noise is present. SS generally has moderate computational complexity . Hence, it offers practical solutions in cases where noise is generally characterized as a stationary or a slowly varying process independent of the desired signal. However, in practice, random noise variations can lead to an overestimation of noise’s power spectrum, leading to many negative values in the subtracted spectrum. While these values can be eliminated by replacing them with zeros, this nonlinear rectification process can cause significant distortion in the recovered signal , necessitating the adaptation of enhancement mechanisms   that come at the cost of increased computational complexity. Time-frequency denoising methods are commonly applied for nonstationary signals since their varying spectral contents make traditional time-domain or frequency-domain methods less effective. The main concept of time-frequency denoising methods is centered around discriminating and eliminating noise-related coefficients within the time-frequency domain representations of the noisy signal. Time-frequency denoising involves transforming the signal into the time-frequency domain, representing it by a set of coefficients corresponding to each time-frequency instant. Since each coefficient reflects the signal’s energy at that instant, signal denoising is achieved by screening these coefficients to distinguish between noise and meaningful signal components. Thresholding is a common technique employed in this stage; it involves setting a threshold value, below which coefficients are considered to represent noise and are, therefore, attenuated or set to zero. Coefficients above the threshold, which are assumed to represent the actual signal, are either preserved or adjusted. The key idea here is that small-magnitude coefficients. representing low energy, are more likely to be associated with noise, while larger coefficients are likely to represent actual signal components. After thresholding, the time-domain signal is reconstructed by inversely transforming the modified coefficients to the time-domain. Wavelet-based thresholding          is commonly used for signal denoising, mainly attributed to its unique characteristics of multi-resolution analysis and the availability of a large set of basic functions. Multi-resolution analysis can capture global trends and fine details, making it useful in denoising. The diverse family of wavelet base functions allows the selection of a wavelet that matches signal characteristics. In thresholding-based denoising, the noise level is determined by the threshold value. Hence, excessively large thresholds could filter out some of the useful signal representations; on the other hand, too small thresholds could cause some noise to be retained in the signal. There are several methods to guide the selection of an appropriate threshold, such as universal threshold, minimax threshold, and SURE threshold . Common thresholding functions include hard thresholding and soft thresholding . In hard thresholding, coefficients with absolute values less than the threshold are set to zero, while others remain unchanged. This can sometimes lead to discontinuities in the reconstructed signal. Soft thresholding, on the other hand, shrinks coefficients towards zero by the threshold value, providing a smoother result but potentially introducing bias. The choice of thresholding function and threshold values is influenced by the characteristics of the signal and the specific requirements of the application      . In practice, it is an iterative process where thresholding and signal reconstruction are repeated, and the thresholding is adjusted at each iteration based on denoising performance. The use of DL for signal-denoising applications is an active research field   [ref]363               ; the existing approaches involve a wide range of models and methods, making them too numerous to mention. Nevertheless, the main theme is to use noise-free signals as training targets and corresponding noisy versions as training inputs. From a signal-processing perspective, such an approach can be centered around the concept of tunable denoising filters, Where a trained DL denoising model can be viewed as a tuned denoising filter whose coefficients, represented by model weights, are tuned through the training phase to remove noise from the signal. DL-based approaches are approved to be highly effective in noise removal due to their ability to learn complex, noisy patterns and related dependencies within the signal. Moreover, they can be designed to implement various operations on signal simultaneously, facilitating efficient end-to-end implementation of various signal-processing pipelines. This concept has been demonstrated in , where 1D convolutional autoencoders are utilized to implement a signal processing pipeline that smooths, compresses, denoises, and expands vibration signals. The pipeline is intended to facilitate power-efficient remote condition monitoring. The smoothing and compression operations were implemented simultaneously using a smoothing autoencoder with a μ𝜇\\mu-law compression-based activation function. The simultaneous denoising expansion of the compressed noisy signal is realised by a denoising reconstruction autoencoder. Despite these advantages, the effectiveness of DL-based denoising, in general, is limited to noise profiles that are present in the training set . Furthermore, as they lack inherent capabilities to adapt to varying noise patterns, conventional DL denoising approaches are impractical for real-time applications that involve varying noise characteristics.\n\nReference markers found: [363]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]363: signal reconstruction are repeated, and the thresholding is adjusted at each iteration based on denoising performance.
