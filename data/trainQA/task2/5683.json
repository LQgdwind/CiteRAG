It also functions as a non-maximum suppression mechanism by considering grasps with overlapping centers and similar orientations to be highly simillar, resulting in only one grasp being retained.\nThe grasp centers are detected from heatmap Y∈[ref]0 [ref]10​p​t′×0​p​t′×M𝑌superscript010𝑝superscript𝑡′0𝑝superscript𝑡′𝑀Y\\in[ref]0 [ref]1^{0pt^{\\prime}\\times 0pt^{\\prime}\\times M}, where 0​p​t′0𝑝superscript𝑡′0pt^{\\prime} and 0​p​t′0𝑝superscript𝑡′0pt^{\\prime} represents resolution of downscaled feature map.\nAs we will discuss soon, center-based strategy provides a simple way to group keypoints. It is also straightforward to fuse with features extracted from other modalities, such as language . With grasp centers, the keypoints’ locations {(pi​1m,pi​2m,pi​3m,pi​4m)}subscriptsuperscript𝑝𝑚𝑖1subscriptsuperscript𝑝𝑚𝑖2subscriptsuperscript𝑝𝑚𝑖3subscriptsuperscript𝑝𝑚𝑖4\\{(p^{m}_{i1},p^{m}_{i2},p^{m}_{i3},p^{m}_{i4})\\} are predicted based on offset estimation.\nOur network learns to generate center-keypoint offset vector map O𝑂O, which encodes the displacement from center to keypoints for each center and orientation.\nThe keypoints locations can be obtained from the centers and offsets, and are then fed into IPPE  algorithm specifically designed for coplaner PnP problem to produce 6-DoF grasp pose.\nThe final synthesized grasp set is the collection of results from grasp centers with high confidence. Scale-Normalized Keypoint Prediction\nA natural choice of keypoint design is to define pair-wise distance equal to open width,\nwhich places two keypoints on gripper tips and other two above to form a square.\nIn this way, 2D keypoints on the image are adaptive to the size of graspable part. However, such a design naturally bias towards grasp pose with small scale (in close proximity to camera) in training..\nUnlike human pose or object pose estimation problem ,\ngrasp poses are larger in quantity per image due to multiple grasps feasible for each object, exhibiting a distribution of scales.\nFor fixed size grasps, the keypoints appear closer on the image for further poses as a result of perspective projection.\nHowever, one property for PnP algorithm is that recovered grasp pose for close-by points are prone to larger error under the same level of noise, as keypoint structure is more strongly disrupted.\nHence, same error in Euclidean keypoint space transfers to larger error in pose space for large-scale grasp annotations. To empirically confirm this property, we conduct a synthetic experiment to examine the relationship between scale and pose recovery error.\nWe randomly sample grasp orientation at the origin, and place cameras with various distance along optical axis.\nThen we recover gripper pose with canonical keypoint projections injected by gaussian noise, and calculate the average rotational and translational error, defined in the same way as in §IV-C.\nThe result is shown in Fig. 2, which indicates that both errors increase as a function of scale conditioned on any noise level. We propose to predict image-space keypoints normalized by the scale.\nThe idea is related to human/object keypoints prediction with area-normalization   or object-size-normalization ,\nbut for grasp pose estimation problem we normalize with pose proximity to camera center to introduce scale invariance.\nSpecifically, we scale the offset which determines the proximity of keypoints. For each grasp center c𝑐c and associated actual offset vectors O~csubscript~𝑂𝑐\\tilde{O}_{c} and scale Scsubscript𝑆𝑐S_{c}, our network is tasked to predict: where the predicted scale (see Sec. III-C) is used in the inference.\nThe scale-normalized keypoint design reduces the susceptibility of pose recovery to noise for further grasp poses.\nAssuming the prediction of scaled offsets suffers from zero-mean Gaussian noise ϵ∼𝒩​(0,σ2)similar-toitalic-ϵ𝒩0superscript𝜎2\\epsilon\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2}).\nThen the perturbance of original offsets is reduce to (1/Sc)​ϵ∼𝒩​(0,σ2/Sc2)similar-to1subscript𝑆𝑐italic-ϵ𝒩0superscript𝜎2superscriptsubscript𝑆𝑐2(1/S_{c})\\epsilon\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2}/S_{c}^{2}), whose standard deviation is decreased by the scales, leading to more accurate pose recovery.\nWe show in Sec. IV-C that this design improves the pose estimation accuracy. Single and multi in the paratheneses means trained on single-object or multi-object data. The evaluated model is trained on Acronym  dataset. ⋆ Numbers averaged over three error tolerance levels. sBranch - Scaled branch (§.III-C). sKpt - Scale-normalized keypoints (§III-B).\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: mechanism by considering grasps with overlapping centers and similar orientations to be highly simillar, resulting in only one grasp being retained.\nThe grasp centers are detected from heatmap Y∈[ref]0 [ref]10​p​t′×0​p​t′×M𝑌superscript010𝑝superscript𝑡′0𝑝superscript𝑡′𝑀Y\\in[ref]0 [ref]1^{0pt^{\\prime}\\times 0pt^{\\prime}\\times M}, where 0​p​t′0𝑝superscript𝑡′0pt^{\\prime} and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
