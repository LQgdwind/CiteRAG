We evaluate the mitigative action of victim refresh. Recently, alternative mitigative actions have emerged, such as row migration (Randomized Row-Swap , AQUA , Scalable Row-Swap (SRS) , SHADOW [ref]46) and rate control (Blockhammer ). Of these, SRS caches heavily swapped rows (containing data), while we use LLC to store metadata (row-counters). Moreover, these solutions still need a tracker and can use START as a practical and scalable tracker, as START is compatible with any mitigative action.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: We evaluate the mitigative action of victim refresh.
