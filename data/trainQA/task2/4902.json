      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Universe Model for Partial Matching Networks over Multiple Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning has recently been applied to graph matching on images , whereby CNN is used to extract node features from images followed with spectral matching and is learned using a regression-like node correspondence supervision. This work is improved via introducing GNN to encode structural   or geometric  information, with a combinatorial loss based on cross-entropy loss, and Sinkhorn network  as a differential matching solver. The work  extends PCA (Permutation loss and Cross-graph Affinity GM)  by edge embedding and Hungarian-based [ref]43 attention mechanism to stabilize end-to-end training. BBGM (Blackbox Deep Graph Matching)  proposes a better front-end feature extraction backbone with Spline Convolution [ref]44, and the gradient is backpropagated by fitting linear gradient of the discrete graph matching solver [ref]45. NGM (Neural Graph Matching Nets)   proposes to address the most general Lawler’s QAP form, based on the novel feature extractors e.g.  with the proposed learnable graph matching solver. DLGM (Deep Latent Graph Matching) , based on BBGM, predicts consistent topology of graphs utilizing both deterministic and generative models to improve the matching quality.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: loss based on cross-entropy loss, and Sinkhorn network  as a differential matching solver.
