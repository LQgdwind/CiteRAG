      "content": "Paper Title: Abstract\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, calibration of deep neural networks has become a focus in machine learning research. Although multiple approaches, from temperature scaling [ref]1, MC Dropout [ref]17  to Variational Inference methods   have been explored,\nneural network ensembles have demonstrated that they produce the best-calibrated uncertainty estimates  [ref]3 . An important property of well-calibrated models is whether they still give reasonable uncertainties when encountering dataset shift, as this setting better reflects real-world conditions. Ovadia et al. [ref]3 compared multiple approaches using the CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C and ImageNet-C datasets by Hendrycks et al. 1, coming to the conclusion that Deep Ensembles 2 outperformed every other approach, making them the de-facto standard for uncertainty estimation and robustness. The superiority of ensembles in these task has been partly attributed to the diversity between the individual members .\nEnsemble diversity, in general, has long been a research topic in machine learning with many early works recognizing it as a key principle in the performance of ensembles  .\nRecently, a greater focus has been placed on improving diversity in neural network ensembles by different implicit means, for example by providing each ensemble member with differently augmented inputs , building ensembles out of different neural network architectures   3 or training ensemble members with different hyperparameters . Explicit approaches on the other hand try to maximize the diversity between ensemble members by orthogonalizing their gradients , decorrelating their predictions on all classes   or on randomly sampled noise inputs 4 or orthogonalizing only on non-correct classes .\nAnother strategy is to increase diversity in the internal activations of the ensemble members 5 6, which forms a promising direction but requires computationally expensive adversarial setups. Finally, there are sampling-based methods that try to maximize the diversity of the sampling procedure, for example through Determinantal Point Processes 7 8. The advantage of these explicit approaches is that they can directly control the diversity in the ensemble and do not rely on decisions with indirect and often unclear consequences. As training ensembles is expensive, multiple methods have tried to reduce training costs. Snapshot-based methods 9  save multiple epochs along a training trajectory, Batch Ensembles  generate individual ensemble members by addition of a per-member Rank-1 Hadamard-product and TreeNets  approximate a Deep Ensemble by sharing the lower levels of a network between members. Furthermore, distillation approaches were proposed \nthat try to compress multiple networks into a single one. However, these approaches tend to reduce the diversity between the individual members, by either sharing parameters between them or not training them independently, leading to a reduction in accuracy and calibration. In this work we show that diversity regularization is highly useful in parameter shared ensembles and that diversity regularization can not only help with accuracy and under dataset shift but also with out-of-distribution detection. Taking inspiration from Jain et al. 4 we introduce an explicit diversity regularizer for classification that uses out-of-distribution samples, leaving the predictions on the original data intact.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: In recent years, calibration of deep neural networks has become a focus in machine learning research.
