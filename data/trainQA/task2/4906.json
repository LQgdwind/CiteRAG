      "content": "Paper Title: Black Box Model Explanations and the Human Interpretability Expectations - An Analysis in the Context of Homicide Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe machine learning model used in the analyses performed herein has already been duly validated in [ref]47, being developed on the basis of the data provided by the Office of Intelligence and Criminal Analysis - SIAC of Pará State, Brazil. Such data refer to the police reports registered during the years 2016 to 2018 in the city of Belém, Pará State. The City of Belém, capital of the state of Pará, Brazil, the scenario of this study, is a city with 1,393,399 inhabitants, according to the last census performed in 2010, and has a human development index of 0.746 [ref]29. This city has institutions that carry out several programs in the area of public security, and in recent years there has been a decrease in cases of violent crimes. Nevertheless, Belém featured the third worst homicide rate among all Brazilian capitals (74.3) in a 2017 study . Thus, the data from the police records in this city prove to be interesting sources of information for the herein study. In a recent survey, Pará State ranks together with eight other Brazilian states as having incomplete data regarding homicide cases and solution thereof . Thus, the importance of the study conducted in [ref]47 is hereby emphasized, since the developed model proved capable of carrying out the crime prediction process, even under different circumstances. In the future, the defended methodology may be able to help solve problems related to missing data on violent crimes. As advocated in [ref]47, the machine learning model proposed hereby is based on the dynamics of how different crimes that occur in a city can be explained by different theories in the area of Social Sciences, such as those related to a single person, called “Theory of Understanding the Motivations of Individual Behavior”, and also from the “Theory of Associated Epidemiology”, related to the study of how criminal behavior is distributed and displaced in time and space of a given location . This second theory, presented above, supports the way in which this research understands the relationships between different types of crimes, that is, through a deep analysis of the relationships of the most different crimes and their time and space, the possibility of predicting a specific crime is suggested[ref]47. Thus, for the construction of the model, several transformations were performed on the original database of police reports, in order to allow the quantity of each crime occurring in years, months and neighborhoods to be correlated to the binary class referring to the occurrence or not of homicides in the following month, thus making it possible to analyze how different crimes are dynamically related to homicides in the city of study, since the occurrence of specific crimes is related to a context of the conflict between individuals, and one offense may influence homicides [ref]21  . As seen in [ref]47, the data used as inputs for machine learning models are completely generic, since they are made up of the month variable (1 variable) along with the different numbers of crimes that occurred in neighborhoods in a specific month (34 variables), which makes this methodology of using criminology data for the prediction of homicides easily replicable to other cities that have the same data. Only at the level of curiosity, Figure 2 shows the information gain calculated for the data of the proposed system. It is also noteworthy that all records of different types of crimes (34 types in total) were selected by a public security specialist. By that, only crime types that can be directly or indirectly linked to homicides are found in the final dataset [ref]47. More details about the dataset and analysis of this study can be found at: https://github.com/josesousaribeiro/Pred2Town. According to [ref]47, eleven (11) different algorithms were tested for the homicide prediction problem. However, the results with the best performance and stability were only found by the Random Forest - RF algorithm , thus representing the best machine learning model developed. For this reason, the methodology applied in the study presented herein will use this model for the analyses presented in the topic Materials and Methods.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: The machine learning model used in the analyses performed herein has already been duly validated in [ref]47, being developed on the basis of the data provided by the Office of Intelligence and Criminal Analysis - SIAC of Pará State, Brazil.
