Indeed, many GNN architectures (e.g., GCN , GAT [ref]45, MPNN ) have been proposed. The essential idea of all these architectures is to iteratively update node representations by aggregating the information from their neighbors through multiple rounds of neural message passing. The final node representations can be used for downstream tasks such as node classification or link prediction. For graph classification, an additional readout layer is used to combine all the node representations to calculate the entire graph representation. In general, an effective aggregation (or pooling) function is required to aggregate the information at the level of both local neighborhoods and the entire graph. In practice, some simple aggregation functions are usually used such as sum, mean, and max. Though simple and effective in some applications, the expressiveness of these functions is limited as they only model linear combinations of node features, which can limit their effectiveness in some cases. A recent work, principled neighborhood aggregation (PNA) , aims to design a more flexible aggregation function by combining multiple simple aggregation functions, each of which is associated with a learnable weight. However, the practical capacity of PNA is still limited by simply combining multiple simple aggregation functions. A more expressive solution would be to model high-order non-linear interactions when aggregating node features. However, explicitly modeling high-order non-linear interactions among nodes is very expensive, with both the time and memory complexity being exponential in the size of the neighborhood. This raises the question of whether there exists an aggregation function which can model high-order non-linear interactions among nodes while remaining computationally efficient. In this paper, we propose such an approach based on symmetric tensor decomposition. We design an aggregation function over a set of node representations for graph neural networks, which is permutation-invariant and is capable of modeling non-linear high-order multiplicative interactions among nodes. We leverage the symmetric CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CP)   to design an efficient parameterization of permutation-invariant multilinear maps over a set of node representations. Theoretically, we show that the CP layer can compute any permutation-invariant multilinear polynomial, including the classical sum and mean aggregation functions. We also show that the CP layer is universally strictly more expressive than sum and mean pooling: with probability one, any function computed by a random CP layer cannot be computed using sum and mean pooling. We propose the CP-layer as an expressive mean of performing the aggregation and update functions in GNN. We call the resulting model a tensorized GNN (tGNN).\nWe evaluate tGNN on both node and graph classification tasks. Experimental results on real-world large-scale datasets show that our proposed architecture outperforms or can compete with existing state-of-the-art approaches and traditional pooling techniques. Notably, our proposed method is more effective and expressive than existing GNN architectures and pooling methods on two citation networks, two OGB node datasets, and one OGB graph dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: Graph neural networks (GNNs) generalize traditional neural network architectures for data in the Euclidean domain to data in non-Euclidean domains  [ref]45  [ref]35.\nAs graphs are very general and flexible data structures and are ubiquitous in the real world, GNNs are now widely used in a variety of domains and applications such as social\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
