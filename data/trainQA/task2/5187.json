      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Improving Exploration in Self-Imitation Learning using Intrinsic Motivation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement Learning has captured the attention of the research community due to the manifold applications in which this kind of learning problems can be formulated, including games , healthcare , industry  and robotics , among others. This momentum has flourished from studies reporting the proven superiority of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) over humans in certain tasks  [ref]6, and its potential to train generalist agents . Unfortunately, the large number of samples usually required for DRL makes its application infeasible in some real-world settings. Consequently, Imitation Learning (IL) and Transfer Learning strategies have been proposed over the years to accelerate the learning process and decrease the required amount of training data  . The same strategy of using expert demonstrations has been used to address exploration issues in problems with sparse rewards and help the agent learn without any feedback signal from the environment 0. Nevertheless, such expert demonstrations are not always available in practice. This motivated the idea of the agent interacting with the environment and storing experiences entailing good exploration properties, namely, self-Imitation Learning (self-IL 111For the sake of clarity, in the paper we refer to this kind of methods as self-IL, whereas we use SIL to refer to the approach presented in 1.). Although it effectively alleviates the need for expert demonstrations, self-imitation learning methods have a high sensitivity to the discovery of sufficiently good trajectories in first instance which can be difficult to obtain depending on the scenario. On the other hand, exploration issues have been also tackled from the perspective of Intrinsic Motivation (IM), in which the agent is encouraged to interact with the environment based on its inner curiosity rather than on externally signalled information about the quality of the interaction with respect to the formulated goal. In the absence of expert demonstrations and with the aim of maximizing the sample-efficiency in sparse rewards problems, this work proposes a framework that combines both self-IL and IM towards achieving a better management of the agent’s exploration capabilities in sparse problems. Both strategies are commonly used to address tasks demanding high exploration, yet in a separate fashion. Our research hypothesis is that these strategies can be synergistic: IM can be used to generate intrinsic rewards and foster exploration directly, so that the limitation of discovering diverse and valuable trajectories exposed by self-IL can be alleviated. At the same time, self-IL can be effectively used to replay and prioritize good experiences in the agent’s learning process. We envision that, by combining both approaches, we simultaneously boost generalizable knowledge by reinforcing those experiences attractive in term of objective as well as those novel potentially leading to better outcomes. This is not the first time that both strategies have been mixed to see whether they are complementary 1 2 3. Previous research studies were carried out in singleton environments 1 2 with different kinds of prioritization strategies.\nContrarily, procedurally-generated environments are created depending on specified attributes (or seeds) that govern the characteristics/dynamics of the generated environment (starting point, configuration of the objects, distance to the goal, etc) to measure the sample-efficiency and generalization capabilities. That is why, recently, hybrid IL-IM algorithms were evaluated over these environments yet being analyzed in low to moderate difficulty tasks, leaving the open question whether such algorithms can solve harder exploration tasks 3. Besides, in the absence of an ablation study it is difficult to determine the contribution of each element of the approach to expose their limitations. In this work we evaluate our framework in procedurally-generated environments from MiniGrid 4, where state-of-the-art algorithms and even IM-based solutions have difficulties to learn 5. We build our approach on top of a novel self-IL approach called RAPID 6, which retains good exploration behaviors by inspecting the entire episode, and takes into account both extrinsic and intrinsic feedback signals for replay. We evaluate the performance of our proposal in procedurally-generated hard-exploration environments, beating previously reported state-of-the-art self-IL methods results, and also achieving an equal or better sample efficiency with respect to IM approaches in isolation. In addition, we identify several weaknesses that might well hinder a better performance and spur future research directions. The rest of this manuscript is structured as follows: Section II presents the background related to IL, self-IL and IM. Next, Section III describes how self-IL and IM are combined together to foster a more efficient and synergistic exploration. Section IV follows by detailing the experimental setup. Section V examines the reported results and discusses the limitations. Finally, Section VI draws conclusions and future research work to be developed in this research line.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: , healthcare , industry  and robotics , among others.
