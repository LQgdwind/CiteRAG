Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: A Unified Framework for Biphasic Facial Age Translation with Noisy-Semantic Guided Generative Adversarial Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSemantic guided image synthesis aims to convert an input segmentation mask to a photo-realistic image [ref]20.\nThe advanced methods also use semantic layouts for image manipulation and editing [ref]21-[ref]25.\nPix2Pix [ref]20 first introduces conditional GANs into semantic driven image synthesis.\nCycleGAN  proposes a cycle consistency constraint for unpaired image translation including semantic image synthesis.\nCoCosNet  puts forward a cross-domain correspondence learning for semantic image translation.\nIn addition, Sesame  utilizes local semantic map as the guidance to manipulate masked images.\nSLMNet [ref]25 proposes a high-resolution sparse attention module that effectively transfers visual details to ‘new’ layouts at a resolution up to 512 × 512.\nIn the above methods, semantic layouts are directly used as the network input and transformed by convolutional representation.\nAlthough their results are satisfactory, they still need to improve the details. Different from the above, another part of methods are proposed to inject semantic layouts for image synthesis through redesign of normalization operations, which could enhance the depiction of details.\nSPADE  introduces a spatially-adaptive normalization for semantic-image style transfer.\nSEAN  updates SPADE and proposes to code region-wise features into respective feature vectors.\nThen the vectors are injected into the backbone network for different semantics.\nCLADE  proposes an class-adaptive normalization method for efficient semantic image synthesis.\nFurthermore, Alharbi et al. put forward a structured noise injection method for disentangled face generation, which proves that noise could play an important role in the generation task.\nInspired by SPADE, CLADE and structured noise, in this paper, we apply the semantic injection into the generator and propose the noisy semantic for fine-grained generation, both firstly introduced for face age synthesis.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: Semantic guided image synthesis aims to convert an input segmentation mask to a photo-realistic image [ref]20.\nThe advanced methods also use semantic layouts for image manipulation and editing [ref]21-[ref]25.\nPix2Pix [ref]20 first introduces conditional GANs into semantic driven image\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
