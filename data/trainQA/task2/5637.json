      "content": "Paper Title: PlaNet-ClothPick: Effective Fabric Flattening Based on Latent Dynamic Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep reinforcement learning methods based on the Recurrent State Space Model\n(RSSM), such as PlaNet [ref]1 and Dreamer    have achieved state-of-the-art (SoTA) asymptotic performance and data efficiency in both continuous control dm_control  and discrete-action Atari 2600  benchmark environments. However, many authors have noted that RSSM-based models struggle with a canonical task in cloth-shaping: fabric flattening, where one or more end-effectors operate on a piece of square fabric to unfold it on a surface  [ref]8  . Most successful data-driven methods, such as imitation learning [ref]8  and reinforcement learning    [ref]14  for fabric-flattening focus on quasi-static pick-and-place (P&P) manipulation. Despite pick-and-fling and pick-and-blow primitives being operationally more effective than quasi-static P&P primitives  , P&P is cost-effective as it only requires one robot arm and a camera. Deep Planning Network (PlaNet) [ref]1 is a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that uses model-predictive control (MPC) to plan on a latent dynamic model (LDM) trained based on the RSSM. However, PlaNet keeps failing on fabric flattening   ; it has been argued that this may be due to the blurry observation reconstruction of the LDM  [ref]14. In this paper, we investigate PlaNet’s performance on the domain in simulation benchmark SoftGym  to understand the causes of poor performance on this task. We note four contributions of this paper: (1) We propose a new reward function for fabric flattening, which leads to better performance than the normalised coverage and the reward adopted by Hoque et al. (2022) . (2) Inspired by Lin et al. (2022) [ref]14 and Hoque et al. (2022) , we suggest a domain-specific planning method ClothMaskPick-MPC that samples the first pick action on the cloth-mask to improve planning accuracy and efficiency (Figure 1); this helps to overcome the difficulty in accurately modelling the sharp discontinuity on the article’s contour. (3) LDMs need a large amount of data to overcome the enormity and complexity of the cloth’s dynamic. Apart from the expert, random, corner-biased trajectories , we collect trajectories where the policy samples small dragging actions on an almost flattened fabric. This helps to boost the robustness and performance of the ClothMaskPick-MPC on the LDM. Besides, we employ data augmentation techniques, such as rotation 0 and flipping, to upsample the training trajectories to improve the robustness of the model. (4) We also observe that PlaNet’s LDM cannot learn a good latent prior distribution due to the complex non-linear behaviour of cloth-like deformable objects (CDOs), so we adopt KL balancing  to improve both posterior and prior learning quality. We further improve the planning performance by incorporating prior reward learning. We demonstrate that these four improvements lead to PlaNet-ClothPick achieving SoTA performance compared to mesh-based planning methods regarding primary metrics – normalised coverage (NC) and normalised improvement (NI) against action steps, and it outperforms visual planning and policy learning methods (Figure 4). It also showcases a one-order-of-magnitude advantage regarding the action inference time and transitional model parameters compared to the previous SoTA robotic systems in this domain (Figure 5). The strong inductive biases of our method are introduced in ClothMaskPick-MPC and the specially engineered offline dataset, hence the name PlaNet-ClothPick. This paper shows that RSSM-based algorithms can play an important role in a wider range of application domains.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Deep reinforcement learning methods based on the Recurrent State Space Model\n(RSSM), such as PlaNet [ref]1 and Dreamer    have achieved state-of-the-art (SoTA) asymptotic performance and data efficiency in both continuous control dm_control  and discrete-action Atari 2600  benchmark environments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
