      "content": "Paper Title: Probing Representation Forgetting in Supervised and Unsupervised Continual Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nContinual Learning (CL) is concerned with methods for learners to manage changing training data distributions. The goal is to acquire new knowledge from new data distributions while not forgetting previous knowledge. A common scenario is CL in the classification setting, where the class labels presented to the learner change over time. In this scenario, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting has been observed  . This phenomenon is often described as a loss of knowledge about previously seen data and is observed in the classification setting as a decrease in accuracy. Deep learning has been traditionally motivated as an approach, which can automatically learn representations , forgoing the need to design handcrafted features. Indeed representation learning is at the core of deep learning methods in supervised and unsupervised settings . In the case of many practical scenarios we may not simply be interested in the final performance of the model, but also the usefulness of the learned features for various downstream tasks 2. Although a model’s representation may change, sometimes drastically at task boundaries , this does not necessarily imply a loss of useful information and may instead correspond to a simple transformation. For example, consider a standard multi-head CL setting, where each task shares a representation and only differs through task specific “heads”. A permutation of the features leading into the classification heads leads to total catastrophic forgetting as measured by standard approaches as the task heads no longer match with the representations. However, this does not correspond to a loss of knowledge about the data, nor a less useful representation. Indeed recent works have highlighted the importance of fast remembering versus catastrophic forgetting [ref]17 [ref]14, a looser continual learning requirement where in the task performance may decrease but the agent is able to recover rapidly upon observing a few samples from the previous task. In this light, maintaining a useful representation, which facilitates rapid recovery, is as important as maintaining high performance for the task. CL envisions having learners operate over long time horizons while continually maintaining old knowledge and integrating new knowledge. Hence, in addition to directly measuring the performance on previous tasks using the last layer classifiers, it is sensible to consider the usefulness of their representations for previous tasks. In this paper we highlight that traditional approaches of evaluating forgetting are unable to properly disambiguate trivial changes in the features (e.g. permutation) from abrupt losses of useful representations. We instead use optimal Linear Probes (LP), commonly used to study unsupervised representations  and intermediate layer representations  8, to evaluate CL algorithms and their effectiveness. We revisit several CL settings and benchmarks and measure forgetting using LP. Our focus is particularly on re-evaluating finetuning approaches that do not apply explicit control for the non-iid nature of continual learning. We observe that in many commonly studied cases of catastrophic forgetting, the representations under naive finetuning approaches, undergo minimal forgetting, without losing critical task information. Our major contributions in this work are as follows.\nFirst we bring three new significant insights obtained and demonstrated through extensive experimental analysis: In a number of CL settings the observed accuracy can be a misleading metric for studying forgetting, particularly when compared to finetuning approaches Naive training with SupCon  or SimCLR (in the unsupervised case) have advantageous properties for continual learning, particularly in longer sequences. By using LP based evaluation, forgetting is clearly decreased for wider and deeper models, which is not seen that clearly from earlier observed accuracy. Secondly, we suggest a simple approach to facilitate fast remembering, which does not require using a large memory during training; it relies only on a small memory combined with SupCon based finetuning.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: does not correspond to a loss of knowledge about the data, nor a less useful representation.
