      "content": "Paper Title: Harnessing the Power of Ego Network Layers for Link Prediction in Online Social Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSimilarity-based methods make up the largest class of link prediction algorithms proposed in the literature. The rationale of this approach is that nodes are more likely to form links with nodes that are similar to them. This idea is grounded in the widespread and well-documented social phenomenon of homophily . Algorithms in this class differ in how they define the similarity between nodes. We can broadly distinguish them based on whether they use local information, global information, or a hybrid combination of the two (this approach is one of the least popular, hence we will not treat it further). For a given node pair, local similarity-based solutions rely on node neighborhood-related structural information, such as the number of common neighbors , an inverse function of the degree of common neighbors  , or a Preferential Attachment index . Local similarity-based approaches are very efficient, even on large networks, due to their easy parallelization. Their main theoretical limitation is that they are able to predict only new links between neighbors-of-neighbors.\nTheir counterpart, global similarity-based approaches, rely on metrics computed considering the whole network topology. These metrics focus typically on the possible paths inside the network, such as the shortest paths , paths with different lengths by means of the Katz Index , random walks , or community membership . Algorithmic methods map the link prediction problem into well-known algorithmic approaches. Within this category, classifier-based methods treat the link prediction problem as a binary classification problem    . Each node pair can be characterised with a variety of attributes, including the similarity-based heuristics discussed above. This labelled set can be fed to virtually any classifier (such as decision trees, SVM, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, neural networks). The advantage of this approach is that it can be extended and adapted to any new attribute that one wants to test, and that it generally significantly outperforms purely unsupervised similarity-based methods   . Preprocessing methods are considered meta-approaches, as they are intended to be used in conjunction with other algorithms, for which they provide preprocessing/pre-filtering intended to remove some noise in the network. As an example, the clustering method discussed in  suggests the removal of the weakest links (those between nodes with few or zero common neighbors). The solution that we propose in this paper falls into this category. The meta-approach that we investigate is based on considerations related to how people distribute their social capacity across their relationships, rather than on pure graph-related properties. Orthogonally to the above classification, we can also distinguish between approaches that consider the weights of the links or not.\nAmong the former, we mention  .\nAs discussed in , though, the performance of weighted indices is often worse than their unweighted counterpart. For this reason, in this work we do not consider the weight of links besides what is needed to compute the ego network structure. Besides weights, the signs of links can also be considered for link prediction [ref]40.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: in this work we do not consider the weight of links besides what is needed to compute the ego network structure. Besides weights, the signs of links can also be considered for link prediction [ref]40.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
