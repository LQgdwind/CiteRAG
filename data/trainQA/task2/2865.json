      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge-driven Active Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nActive Learning In the literature, two main approaches have been followed: uncertainty sampling which selects the data on which the model is the least confident;\ncurriculum learning which focuses first on easy samples and then extends the training set to incorporate more difficult ones while also targeting more diversity.\nStandard uncertainty-based strategies choose samples associated to maximal prediction entropy [ref]26 or at minimum distance from the hyperplane in SVM [ref]45 or with the highest variation ratio in Query-by-committee with ensemble methods 5 .\nEstablishing prediction uncertainty is more difficult with DL models. Indeed, they tend to be over-confident, particularly when employing softmax activation functions . Furthermore, as there is no easy access to the distance to the decision boundary, it needs to be computed.\nThis problem has been tackled by devising different uncertain strategies, such as employing Bayesian Neural Network with Monte Carlo Dropout , by calculating the minimum distance required to create an adversarial example , or even predicting the loss associated to unlabelled sample .\nAs pointed out by , however, uncertain strategy may choose the same categories many times and create unbalanced datasets.\nTo solve this, uncertain sample selection can be coupled with diversity sampling strategies. Diversity can be obtained by preferring batches of data maximizing the mutual information between model parameters and predictions , or selecting core-set points , samples nearest to k-means cluster centroids , or even by learning sample dissimilarities in the latent space of a VAE with an adversarial strategy  or by means of a GCN . Hybrid Models It has been pondered that human cognition mainly consists in two different tasks: perceiving the world and reasoning over it . While these two tasks in humans take place at the same times, in artificial intelligence they are separately conducted by machine learning and logic programming. It has been argued that joining these tasks (to create a so-called hybrid model) may overcome some of the most important limits of deep learning, among which the “data hungry” issue 4.\nIn the literature, there exists a variety of proposals aiming to create hybrid models, ranging from Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) 0 and Probabilistic Logic Programming  which focuses on integrating learning with logic reasoning, to enhanced networks focusing on relations or with external memories  .\nRecently, several approaches have been devised to computes and enforce the satisfaction of a given domain knowledge within DL models 3  , (see survey  for a complete list of works in this domain).\nAmong these options, in this work we chose to employ the learning from constraints framework  4 since it provides the great logical expressivity (both universal and existential quantifier) and a straightforward implementation.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: then extends the training set to incorporate more difficult ones while also targeting more diversity.\nStandard uncertainty-based strategies choose samples associated to maximal prediction entropy [ref]26 or at minimum distance from the hyperplane in SVM [ref]45 or with the highest variation ratio in Query-by-committee with ensemble methods 5 .\nEstablishing prediction uncertainty is more\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
