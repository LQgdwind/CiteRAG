      "content": "Paper Title: DyEdgeGAT: Dynamic Edge via Graph Attention for Early Fault Detection in IIoT Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph-based methods are effective tools for modeling complex spatial-temporal dynamics in MTS. Two crucial aspects underlie this process: graph inference, involving the construction of graph structures from MTS, and the application of graph neural networks for subsequent analysis such as forecasting, imputation or anomaly detection . Graph inference is the initial step to transform MTS data into temporal graphs, also referred to as spatial-temporal or dynamic graphs (with no distinction among these terms in our context).\nIn practice, two types of strategies are utilized to construct temporal graphs from MTS data: heuristics or learned from data . Heuristic-based methods extract graph structures from data based on heuristics such as spatial connectivity  and pairwise similarity [ref]29.\nLearning-based methods directly learn the graph structure from the data in an end-to-end fashion. These methods commonly utilize embedding-based , attention-based [ref]15, and sampling-based methods . These learning-based approaches enable the discovery of more complex and potentially more informative graph structures compared to heuristic-based methods . Graph neutral networks are employed to process the spatial-temporal dynamics captured in the inferred temporal graphs.\nWe follow the definition by Gao et al. [ref]33, distinguishing between two primary paradigms: time-and-graph, where graph representations derived from GNNs are integrated with sequence models like RNNs to jointly capture the temporal dynamics of node attributes; and time-then-graph, where sequences that describe node and edge dynamics are first modeled and then incorporated as attributes in a static aggregated graph representation.\n\nExisting GNN methods for MTS mainly follow the time-and-graph approach, dynamically constructing a static graph for each input sequence. For instance, Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN)  applies SpectralGCN and GRU to a predefined static graph for traffic forecasting. Extending this, Graph for Time Series (GTS)  builds upon DCRNN, employing it to a jointly learned probabilistic global graph.\nIn the graph-then-time category, a variation of time-and-graph, Anomaly Detection via Dynamic Graph Forecasting (DyGraphAD) [ref]29 is worth noting. Specifically, it generates a series of dynamic correlation graphs from MTS using dynamic time warping and processes these graphs to create a sequence of latent graph representations for forecasting.\nConversely, time-then-graph has mainly been applied to networks with predefined graph structures such as evolving social networks or traffic systems, where simultaneous graph inference is not required. Notable examples of the time-then-graph frameworks include Temporal Graph Attention Networks (TGAT)  and Temporal Graph Network (TGN) . Given the complex nature of MTS data in the IIoT context, more expressive modeling techniques are crucial to improve fault and anomaly detection performance. Gao et al. [ref]33 have demonstrated the superior expressiveness of the time-then-graph approach for MTS. However, applying it to IIoT settings introduces a research gap: it requires the extraction of edge dynamics to infer the temporal graph, which is different from the static graph inference common in the existing literature.\nWhile some time-and-graph approaches do construct dynamic graphs from windowed MTS data, they typically produce a single static graph per input, failing to track evolving edge dynamics and graph structures.\nConversely, DyGraphAD constructs dynamic graphs based on the correlation of MTS but follows a graph-then-time approach, emphasizing graph embedding changes over the evolution of pairwise relationships which makes them less applicable to detect faults characterized by relationship changes.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: temporal graphs from MTS data: heuristics or learned from data .
