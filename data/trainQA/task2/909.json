      "content": "Paper Title: Enhancing a Neurocognitive Shared Visuomotor Model for Object Identification, Localization, and Grasping With Learning From Auxiliary Tasks The authors gratefully acknowledge partial support from the German Research Foundation DFG under project CML (TRR 169).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe present a follow-up study to the biologically inspired neural model for the robotic task of object identification, localization, and motor action regression, introduced by Kerzel et al. . We enhance the approach on three fronts: 1) Extend the model’s visuomotor capabilities from reaching for objects on a planar surface to reaching objects in a three-dimensional space as this is a required ability for many real-world robotic applications; 2) Address the influence of imbalances in the training data on possible biases in the model’s behavior; 3) Evaluate the model’s performance on the auxiliary tasks of object localization and identification. We examine the effect of training these auxiliary tasks, along with the main task of reaching for an object, to gain a better understanding of the model’s performance and observe possible synergetic effects of learning the three tasks simultaneously. In a developing human, learning the visuomotor task of reaching for an object goes hand-in-hand with the visual tasks of localizing and identifying the object in their visual field [ref]32. On a neurocognitive level, these tasks share an important component, namely the early visual system. In the human brain, visual stimuli are processed through shared initial steps before branching off into the more specialized dorsal where and ventral what pathways . Attention mechanisms modulate this processing of visual information, i.e., pattern, shape, and kinetic information is filtered by spatial or task-driven goal cues in the dorsal pathway , thus realizing the fusion of top-down semantic information into the visual processing stream. It can be hypothesized that this shared component benefits from learning all related tasks. These assumptions about the human brain can be realized in an artificial neurocognitive shared visuomotor model, in terms of having a shared early visual processing stream that branches out into task-specific networks. In previous work, we designed a model for reach-for-grasp actions towards a target object in a scene with multiple objects . The model combined the convolutional component of the Resnet , a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for object classification and localization [ref]29, neurally encoded linguistic labels, and feed-forward layers for a robotic reach-for-grasp task . The model processed an image from the robot’s perspective and predicted joint values to reach for a target object that is specified in terms of semantic features, such as type, color, and shape. We showed that a neurocognitively inspired, unified neural model could learn visuomotor abilities for grasping target objects on a table surface. This model was embodied in a developmental robot, through which grasp failures were observed. These failures were interpreted as grasps targeting the wrong object in a scene, contrary to mis-grasping the correct object. The systematic nature of the observed mis-grasps resembles observations of human grasp development by Libertus et al. , who reported that infants show a reaching preference towards objects with a high general visual salience. We hypothesize that both in the biological as well as our artificial system, the observed behavior can be attributed to the selection of the target object during visual processing, not to the ability to reach for the desired object. For a more detailed analysis of our previous work, see ; for a general discussion on the biological plausibility of supervised learning and backpropagation, we refer the reader to [ref]28. In this follow-up study, we adapt our model to the novel task of three-dimensional reach-for-grasp and also simultaneous training of the auxiliary tasks of object localization and identification with a combined loss function that incorporates all three tasks, as shown in Fig. 1 (left). To this end, a new dataset is generated, based on the Extended Train Robot  dataset, the robotic simulation environment MuJoCo111http://www.mujoco.org/, and augmented reality. Due to the high number of required training samples for this more complex task, realizing a real-world dataset is prohibitive. The dataset features 37,500 samples, each consisting of an image with the following annotations: joint configuration to reach for the target object (primary task), position of the selected object in the image (auxiliary task), classification of the image (auxiliary task) and a natural language specification of the target object. Our model combines indirectly specified object locations with labeled object identifications and reach-for-grasp movements (illustrated in Fig. 1). In addition to extending the model for performing a three-dimensional visuomotor task and developing a novel data set, our main contribution is a detailed analysis of the model: We evaluate for systematic biases in detecting objects based on the distribution of different color and shape combinations, as well as the spatial distribution of objects in the dataset. We compare the achieved detection accuracy for shape color combination and at different positions. Furthermore, we provide a better insight into the effect of training with auxiliary tasks in an integrated visuomotor model by training different combinations of tasks simultaneously. We can show that the primary visuomotor task can be successfully trained simultaneously with one of the two auxiliary tasks.
