Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

The results are compared against base metric learning methods for few-shot classification ( [ref]41 ), and against recently proposed methods ([ref]25 [ref]22 ). As detailed in Table 1, our method outperforms most of the baselines in the 5-way 1-shot setting, getting only lower accuracy than Reptile () and Relation Networks ) when using a ConvNet as Feature extractor, and lower accuracy than Principal Characteristics Net () when using a ResNet-12. For the 5-way 5-shot setting, our method outperforms all the baseline methods and the recent ones using ConvNet and ResNet-12 as feature extractors. When using a ConvNet as the feature extractor, our method achieves an improvement of 8.8% over the baseline (), 5.3% over the Matching Networks ([ref]41) and 0.4% over the base prototypical Networks for the 5-way 1-shot setting. For the setting of 5-way 5-shot, we achieve an improvement of 13.4% over the Matching Networks, 3.4% over the Relation Networks and 0.5% over the prototypical networks. When using a ResNet-12 as the feature extractor, our method achieves an improvement of 5.6% over SNAIL (), 3% over the K-tuplet Net ([ref]25) and 2% over the Category Traversal Module ([ref]22) for the few-shot setting of 5-way 1-shot. On the setting of 5-way 5-shot, we obtained an improvement of 11.6% over SNAIL, 8.1% over the K-tuplets Net and 3.4% over the Principal Characteristics Net ().\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: evaluate our method under the two most common few-shot learning settings: 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot.
