The BOBR project also supported a stay of N.M. at the University of Warsaw, where part of this work was done.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we obtain the first combinatorial characterizations of monadically dependent graph classes,\nwhich open the way to generalizing the results of sparsity theory to the setting of hereditary graph classes.\nOur main results, Theorem 1.3 and Theorem 1.6, may be seen as analogues of the\nresult  characterizing nowhere dense graph classes\nas exactly the uniformly quasi-wide classes , and\nthe result  [ref]49\ncharacterizing nowhere dense classes\nas exactly those, whose monotone closure is monadically dependent. Central results in sparsity theory, characterizing\nnowhere dense classes, can be usually grouped into two\ntypes: qualitative characterizations and quantitative characterizations.\nQualitative characterizations typically say that\nfor every radius r𝑟r, some quantity is bounded by a constant depending on r𝑟r for all graphs in the class.\nOur two main results fall within this category.\n On the other hand, quantitative characterizations of nowhere dense classes\nare phrased in terms of a fine analysis of densities of some parameters,\nsuch as degeneracy, minimum degree, weak coloring numbers,\nneighborhood complexity, or VC-density;\nthose results almost always involve bounds of the form nεsuperscript𝑛𝜀n^{\\varepsilon} or n1+εsuperscript𝑛1𝜀n^{1+\\varepsilon}, where\nn𝑛n is the number of vertices of the considered graph, and ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 can be chosen arbitrarily small.\nFor instance, given a nowhere dense graph class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C},\nfor every fixed r∈ℕ𝑟ℕr\\in\\mathrm{\\mathbb{N}} and ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, all graphs G𝐺G whose r𝑟r-subdivision is a subgraph of a graph in 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}\nsatisfy Similarly, a parameter called the weak r𝑟r-coloring number (for any fixed r∈ℕ𝑟ℕr\\in\\mathrm{\\mathbb{N}}, ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0),\nis bounded by O𝒞,r,ε​(nε)subscript𝑂𝒞𝑟𝜀superscript𝑛𝜀O_{\\mathcal{C},r,\\varepsilon}(n^{\\varepsilon}),\nfor every n𝑛n-vertex graph G𝐺G in a nowhere dense class. Both the qualitative and quantitative results are of fundamental importance in sparsity theory,\nand lifting them to the setting of monadically dependent graph classes is therefore desirable.\nSome of the most elaborate results of sparsity theory combine both aspects of the theory.\nIn particular for nowhere dense model checking ,\nthe splitter game  – a qualitative characterization – is combined with the quantitative characterization in terms of weak coloring numbers.\nThe characterization in terms of the splitter game relies on uniform quasi-wideness, and\nhas been extended to the setting of monadically stable graph classes, in terms of the flipper game , which in turn relies on the characterization in terms of flip-flatness.\nBasing on this, we believe that flip-breakability may be a first step towards obtaining a game characterization of monadic dependence. As we observe now, our results also provide a first quantitative characterization of monadically dependent classes.\nAs an analogue of the notion of containing\nthe r𝑟r-subdivision of a graph as a subgraph, we introduce the following concept of radius-r𝑟r encodings.\nFix an integer r⩾1𝑟1r\\geqslant 1.\nLet G=(A,B,E)𝐺𝐴𝐵𝐸G=(A,B,E) be a bipartite graph with |A|=|B|=n𝐴𝐵𝑛|A|=|B|=n for some n𝑛n,\nand let A={a1,…,an}𝐴subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛A=\\{a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\} and B={b1,…,bn}𝐵subscript𝑏1…subscript𝑏𝑛B=\\{b_{1},\\ldots,b_{n}\\}.\nConsider a graph H𝐻H which is a star/clique/half-graph r𝑟r-crossing\nwith roots a1,…,ansubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n} and b1,…,bnsubscript𝑏1…subscript𝑏𝑛b_{1},\\ldots,b_{n}.\nRecall that V​(H)𝑉𝐻V(H) can be partitioned into r+2𝑟2r+2 layers, and there are n2superscript𝑛2n^{2} distinguished r𝑟r-vertex paths πi,jsubscript𝜋𝑖𝑗\\pi_{i,j}\nconnecting aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i} and bjsubscript𝑏𝑗b_{j}, for i,j∈[n]𝑖𝑗delimited-[]𝑛i,j\\in[n].\nLet H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} be a graph obtained from H𝐻H by: adding arbitrary edges within each layer of H𝐻H, removing all vertices of the paths πi,jsubscript𝜋𝑖𝑗\\pi_{i,j} for i,j∈[n]𝑖𝑗delimited-[]𝑛i,j\\in[n] such that {ai,bj}∉E​(G)subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑏𝑗𝐸𝐺\\{a_{i},b_{j}\\}\\notin E(G), flipping pairs of layers arbitrarily. We call H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} a radius-r𝑟r encoding of G𝐺G.\nIn particular, every flipped star/clique/half-graph r𝑟r-crossing of order n𝑛n\nis a radius-r𝑟r encoding of the complete bipartite graph Kn,nsubscript𝐾𝑛𝑛K_{n,n}.\nMoreover, the comparability grid of order n+1𝑛1n+1 contains as an induced subgraph a radius-111 encoding of the complete bipartite graph Kn,nsubscript𝐾𝑛𝑛K_{n,n},\nwhich can be obtained from the half-graph 111-crossing of order n+1𝑛1n+1\nby adding edges within the three layers. The following result follows easily from our Theorem 13.1,\nand from results of Dvořák 3 4. Let 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} be a hereditary graph class.\nThe following conditions are equivalent: 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is monadically dependent, for every real ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 and integer r⩾1𝑟1r\\geqslant 1,\nfor every bipartite graph G𝐺G\nsuch that 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} contains some radius-r𝑟r encoding of G𝐺G,\nwe have that |E​(G)|⩽O𝒞,r,ε​(|V​(G)|1+ε)𝐸𝐺subscript𝑂𝒞𝑟𝜀superscript𝑉𝐺1𝜀|E(G)|\\leqslant O_{\\mathcal{C},r,\\varepsilon}(|V(G)|^{1+\\varepsilon}), for every integer r⩾1𝑟1r\\geqslant 1\nthere is an integer N⩾1𝑁1N\\geqslant 1 such that for every bipartite graph G𝐺G with |V​(G)|>N𝑉𝐺𝑁|V(G)|>N\nsuch that 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} contains some radius-r𝑟r encoding of G𝐺G,\nwe have that |E​(G)|<|V​(G)|24𝐸𝐺superscript𝑉𝐺24|E(G)|<\\frac{|V(G)|^{2}}{4}. Theorem 3.1 may be a first step towards developing a quantitative theory of monadically dependent classes.\nA challenging goal here is to generalize the characterization of nowhere denseness in terms of weak coloring numbers, to monadically dependent classes. The flip-width parameters were introduced \nwith the aim of obtaining quantitative characterizations of monadic dependence.\nThe flip-width at radius r⩾1𝑟1r\\geqslant 1, denoted\nfwr⁡(⋅)subscriptfw𝑟⋅\\operatorname{fw}_{r}(\\cdot), is an analogue of the weak r𝑟r-coloring number, and the notion of classes of bounded flip-width,\nand almost bounded flip-width, generalize classes of bounded expansion and nowhere dense classes to the dense setting.\nA graph class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} has bounded flip-width\nif for every integer r⩾1𝑟1r\\geqslant 1\nthere is a constant krsubscript𝑘𝑟k_{r} such that fwr⁡(G)⩽krsubscriptfw𝑟𝐺subscript𝑘𝑟\\operatorname{fw}_{r}(G)\\leqslant k_{r} for all graphs G∈𝒞𝐺𝒞G\\in\\mathcal{C}.\nA hereditary graph class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} has almost bounded flip-width\nif for every integer r⩾1𝑟1r\\geqslant 1 and real ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0\nwe have fwr⁡(G)⩽O𝒞,r,ε​(nε)subscriptfw𝑟𝐺subscript𝑂𝒞𝑟𝜀superscript𝑛𝜀\\operatorname{fw}_{r}(G)\\leqslant O_{\\mathcal{C},r,\\varepsilon}(n^{\\varepsilon}) for all n𝑛n-vertex graphs G∈𝒞𝐺𝒞G\\in\\mathcal{C}.\n1.11 – equating monadic dependence with almost bounded flip-width – therefore postulates a quantitative characterization of monadic dependence, parallel to the characterization of nowhere denseness in terms of weak coloring numbers. As mentioned, our results imply the forward implication of 1.11:\nthat every hereditary class of almost bounded flip-width is monadically dependent.\nTheorem 3.1 might be an initial step towards resolving the backwards direction in 1.11, as\nby Theorem 3.1,\n1.11 is equivalent to the following: Let 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} be a hereditary graph class. Then the following conditions are equivalent: for every real ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 and integer r⩾1𝑟1r\\geqslant 1,\nfor every bipartite graph G𝐺G\nsuch that 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} contains some radius-r𝑟r encoding of G𝐺G,\nwe have: (equivalently, by Theorem 3.1, 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is monadically dependent) 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} has almost bounded flip-width: For every real ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 and integer r⩾1𝑟1r\\geqslant 1,\nand graph G∈𝒞𝐺𝒞G\\in\\mathcal{C},\nwe have: Note that the implication (i​i𝑖𝑖ii)→→\\rightarrow(i𝑖i) in 3.2 holds, by Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 1.12.\nThe following conjecture would imply the converse implication. For every r⩾1𝑟1r\\geqslant 1 there are integers s,k⩾1𝑠𝑘1s,k\\geqslant 1 such that for every graph G𝐺G we have: where the maximum ranges over all bipartite graphs H𝐻H such that G𝐺G contains some radius-s𝑠s encoding of H𝐻H as an induced subgraph. An analogue of 3.3 holds in the sparse setting. There, the flip-width parameters are replaced by weak coloring numbers, and the maximum ranges over all graphs H𝐻H such that G𝐺G contains some s𝑠s-subdivision of H𝐻H as a subgraph.\n3.3 would furthermore imply the following characterization of classes of bounded flip-width,\nanalogous to a known characterization of classes with bounded expansion in terms of weak coloring numbers . Let 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} be a hereditary graph class. Then the following conditions are equivalent: for every integer r⩾1𝑟1r\\geqslant 1 there is a constant krsubscript𝑘𝑟k_{r}\nsuch that\nfor every bipartite graph G𝐺G\nsuch that 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} contains some radius-r𝑟r encoding of G𝐺G,\nwe have that |E​(G)|⩽kr⋅|V​(G)|𝐸𝐺⋅subscript𝑘𝑟𝑉𝐺|E(G)|\\leqslant k_{r}\\cdot|V(G)|, 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} has bounded flip-width: For every integer r⩾1𝑟1r\\geqslant 1 there is a constant krsubscript𝑘𝑟k_{r} such that for every\ngraph G∈𝒞𝐺𝒞G\\in\\mathcal{C},\nwe have that fwr⁡(G)⩽krsubscriptfw𝑟𝐺subscript𝑘𝑟\\operatorname{fw}_{r}(G)\\leqslant k_{r}. Note that the implication (i​i𝑖𝑖ii)→→\\rightarrow(i𝑖i)\nfollows from the results\nof  (that every weakly sparse\ntransduction of a class of bounded flip-width\nhas bounded expansion).\nThe converse implication would resolve\nConjecture 11.4 from ,\nwhich predicts that if a class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} has unbounded flip-width,\nthen 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} transduces a weakly sparse class of unbounded expansion. A specific goal, not involving flip-width,\nwhich would be implied by the above conjectures,\ncan be phrased in terms of near-twins.\nSay that two distinct vertices u,v𝑢𝑣u,v in a graph G𝐺G\nare k𝑘k-near-twins, where k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathrm{\\mathbb{N}}, if the symmetric difference\nof the neighborhoods of u𝑢u and of v𝑣v consists of at most k𝑘k vertices.\nIt is known  that every graph G𝐺G with more than one vertex\ncontains a pair of (2​fw1⁡(G))2subscriptfw1𝐺(2\\operatorname{fw}_{1}(G))-near-twins.\nConsequently, for every class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} of bounded flip-width\nthere is a constant k𝑘k such that every graph G∈𝒞𝐺𝒞G\\in\\mathcal{C}\nwith more than one vertex contains a pair of k𝑘k-near-twins.\nSimilarly, if 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} has almost bounded flip-width then\nevery n𝑛n-vertex graph G∈𝒞𝐺𝒞G\\in\\mathcal{C} with n>1𝑛1n>1\ncontains a pair of O𝒞,ε​(nε)subscript𝑂𝒞𝜀superscript𝑛𝜀O_{\\mathcal{C},\\varepsilon}(n^{\\varepsilon})-near-twins. Therefore, a first step towards 1.11 is to\nprove that for all monadically dependent classes, every n𝑛n-vertex graph G∈𝒞𝐺𝒞G\\in\\mathcal{C} with n>1𝑛1n>1\ncontains a pair of O𝒞,ε​(nε)subscript𝑂𝒞𝜀superscript𝑛𝜀O_{\\mathcal{C},\\varepsilon}(n^{\\varepsilon})-near-twins.\nSimilarly, a step towards 3.4\nis to prove the following consequence of Conjecture 3.3\n(in the case r=1𝑟1r=1),\nstated below. There is an integer s⩾1𝑠1s\\geqslant 1 and an unbounded function f:ℕ→ℕ:𝑓→ℕℕf\\colon\\mathrm{\\mathbb{N}}\\to\\mathrm{\\mathbb{N}} such that every graph G𝐺G with\nmore than one vertex\nand no pair of d𝑑d-near twins, for some d∈ℕ𝑑ℕd\\in\\mathrm{\\mathbb{N}}, contains as an induced subgraph\na radius-s𝑠s encoding of some bipartite graph H𝐻H\nwith |E​(H)|/|V​(H)|⩾f​(d)𝐸𝐻𝑉𝐻𝑓𝑑|E(H)|/|V(H)|\\geqslant f(d). Another, related conjecture [20, Conj. 2] bounds the\nneighborhood complexity, or VC-density of set systems defined by neighborhoods in graphs from a monadically dependent graph class, and is phrased as follows. Let 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} be a monadically dependent graph class and let ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 be a real.\nThen for every graph G∈𝒞𝐺𝒞G\\in\\mathcal{C} and set A⊆V​(G)𝐴𝑉𝐺A\\subseteq V(G),\nwe have that This conjecture is confirmed for all nowhere dense classes 6 ,\nfor all monadically stable classes 0,\nand for all classes of bounded twin-width [ref]8 .\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: main results, Theorem 1.3 and Theorem 1.6, may be seen as analogues of the\nresult  characterizing nowhere dense graph classes\nas exactly the uniformly quasi-wide classes , and\nthe result  [ref]49\ncharacterizing nowhere dense classes\nas exactly those, whose monotone closure is monadically dependent.
