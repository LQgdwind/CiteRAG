      "content": "Paper Title: Progress, Justness and Fairness in Modal ùúá-Calculus Formulae\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFormal verification through model checking requires a formalisation of the properties of the modelled system as formulae in some logic, such as LTL , CTL  or the modal Œºùúá\\mu-calculus .\nIn this paper, we focus on the modal Œºùúá\\mu-calculus,\na highly expressive logic used in established model checkers such as mCLR2  and CADP . A frequently encountered problem when checking liveness properties is that spurious violations are found, such as paths on which some components never make progress.\nOften, such paths do not represent realistic executions of the system.\nIt is then a challenge to restrict verification to those paths that do represent realistic system executions.\nFor this, we use completeness criteria [ref]22 : predicates on paths that say which paths are to be regarded as realistic runs of the system. These runs are called complete runs.\nExamples of completeness criteria are progress, justness and fairness. It turns out that writing a modal Œºùúá\\mu-calculus formula for a property being satisfied under a completeness criterion is non-trivial.\nSince the Œºùúá\\mu-calculus is a branching-time logic, we cannot separately formalise when a path is complete and when it satisfies the property, and then combine the two formalisations with an implication.\nInstead, a more intricate integration of both aspects of a path is needed. Our aim is to achieve such an integration for a broad spectrum of liveness properties and establish the correctness of the resulting formulae. To this end, we shall consider a template property that can be instantiated to a plethora of liveness properties and, in particular, covers all liveness property patterns of . Then, we present modal Œºùúá\\mu-calculus formulae integrating the completeness criteria of progress, justness, weak fairness, strong fairness, and hyperfairness with this template property. As discussed in , for the formulation of realistic completeness criteria it is sometimes necessary to give special treatment to a set of blocking actions, i.e., actions that require cooperation of the environment in which the modelled system operates. Our template formulae are therefore parameterised with a set of blocking actions. We shall see that, given a set of blocking actions, there are two different interpretations of hyperfairness; we call these weak and strong hyperfairness. Regarding our presented formulae, the progress formula is similar to those commonly used for liveness properties even when completeness is not explicitly considered.\nOur formulae for justness, weak fairness and weak hyperfairness only subtly differ from each other. We characterise the similarities these three share and give a generic formula that can be adapted to represent all completeness criteria that meet these conditions.\nLastly, we observe that strong fairness and strong hyperfairness do not meet these conditions. We give alternative formulae that are significantly more complex. Whether more efficient formulae for these completeness criteria exist remains an open problem. Modal Œºùúá\\mu-calculus formulae are often hard to interpret. Accordingly, it is not trivial to see that our formulae indeed express the integration of liveness properties with completeness criteria. We have therefore included elaborate correctness proofs in the appendices. Our work is essentially a generalisation along two dimensions (viz., the completeness criterion and the liveness property) of the works of  and  .\nIn , the tool PASS is presented for automatically translating common property patterns into modal Œºùúá\\mu-calculus formulae.\nSome of those patterns integrate an assumption that excludes paths deemed unrealistic, but since the exact assumption is not stated separately, we cannot make a formal comparison with our approach.\nIn , a formula for justness is presented, covering one of the properties we cover. This formula forms the basis for our justness, weak fairness and weak hyperfairness formulae.\nOur formulae for strong fairness and strong hyperfairness are in part inspired by the formula for termination under strong fairness presented in . The organisation of this paper is as follows.\nIn section¬†2 we recap the relevant definitions on labelled transition systems, as well as the syntax and semantics of the modal Œºùúá\\mu-calculus.\nIn section¬†3, we motive our work with an example, and in section¬†4 we give the completeness criteria we cover in this paper.\nIn section¬†5, we formally identify the class of liveness properties we study and relate it to a popular class of properties.\nOur template formulae are presented in section¬†6, combining the completeness criteria from section¬†4 with the property template from section¬†5.\nWe give a small application example in section¬†7 and discuss the scope of our work in section¬†8.\nFinally, we give our conclusions in section¬†9.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: not represent realistic executions of the system.\nIt is then a challenge to restrict verification to those paths that do represent realistic system executions.\nFor this, we use completeness criteria [ref]22 : predicates on paths that say which paths are to be regarded as realistic runs of the system. These runs are called complete runs.\nExamples of completeness criteria are progress, justness\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
