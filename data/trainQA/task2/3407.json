      "content": "Paper Title: Sense: Model-Hardware Co-design for Accelerating Sparse CNNs on Systolic Array\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe implement Sense in Verilog, and conduct functional simulation on Vivado 2021.1. Implementation is run on ZynqZCU102 at 200MHz and we obtain the reports of resource and power from Vivado, as shown in Tab.IV. For DRAM power evaluation, we simulate on CACTI platform according to the number of DRAM accesses. \nThe size of PE array is 32√ó32323232\\times 32, achieving a peak throughput of 1024√ó0.2‚ÄãG‚ÄãH‚Äãz=204.8‚ÄãG‚ÄãM‚ÄãA‚ÄãC/s10240.2ùê∫ùêªùëß204.8ùê∫ùëÄùê¥ùê∂ùë†1024\\times 0.2GHz=204.8GMAC/s. IFMs and weights are encoded in 16bit and the Psum is truncated to 16bit for storage reduction with little accuracy loss through training. To balance data reusing efficiency and resource overhead, we set the IFM tiling unit as 7√ó7777\\times 7. Thus, the buffers in PE array and compress modules are implemented with 64√ó16‚Äãb6416ùëè64\\times 16b LUT RAM to minimize on-chip storage. Seen from the resource utilization breakdown shown in Tab.IV, LUTs and DSPs are mainly used to construct the PE array for MAC operation and the majority of BRAMs are consumed in I&W buffers for data reusing. Besides, the power and resource of channel clustering module only takes up a small proportion, indicating low cost for sparse processing in our architecture. \n To prove the superiority of Sense, we set some baseline accelerators as follows:\n1) Swallow is a systolic architecture that fully utilizes sparsity of both weights and IFMs in CONV and FC layers, and applied a sparse-aware dataflow to optimize data reusing and lower DRAM access. By comparison, Sense achieves higher speedup through load-balancing weight pruning and channel clustering. Additionally, we further lower DRAM access by applying Adaptive Dataflow Configuration.\n2) FESA proposes a software-hardware co-design to address the problem of no-load PEs for sparse networks and reduce the kernel pattern numbers of irregularly pruned networks, greatly improving PE utilization and performance. But it has not yet implemented on complex datasets like ImageNet, for its relatively strict constraints of pruning method. By comparison, we obtain similar performance improvement based on weight sparsity, which is also verified on ImageNet. Moreover, by exploiting sparsity of both IFMs and weights, we achieve 1.95√ó1.95\\times~2.5√ó2.5\\times performance improvement.\n3) SPOTS[ref]31 is a systolic-array-based accelerator for sparse CNNs by building a hardware unit to perform Im2Col transformation of IFMs coupled with GEMM unit. Moreover, a group-wise pruning method is designed to avoid the potential load imbalance caused by irregularity of sparse weights. By comparison, Sense can achieve higher sparsity of pruned weights with a more coarse-grained pruning method.\n4) Zhu e‚Äãtùëíùë°et a‚Äãlùëéùëôal and Lu e‚Äãtùëíùë°et a‚Äãlùëéùëôal are sparsity-aware CNN accelerators based on FPGA. Unlike systolic dataflow, they process sparse computing in independent PE groups with large logic and BRAM resource overhead. By comparison, we achieve approximate performance with less resource consumption.\nAs for benchmarks, we conduct inference on AlexNet, VGG-16[ref]5, ResNet, GoogleNet[ref]6 and compare our design with each baseline.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: based on weight sparsity, which is also verified on ImageNet.
