      "content": "Paper Title: Symbol emergence as interpersonal cross-situational learning: the emergence of lexical knowledge with combinatoriality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe presented a computational model for a symbol emergence system that allows the emergence of lexical knowledge with combinatoriality through category formation within individual agents and the exchange of word sequences among agents. Our proposed model, named Inter-CLS-PGM, was developed by extending the PGM of the M-H naming game  with the PGM of CSL . To investigate whether our proposed model enables the emergence of lexical knowledge with combinatoriality among agents, we conducted two experiments in a simulation environment using humanoid robots.\nIn the experiment of interpersonal cross-situational learning, two agents repeatedly formed categories and exchanged word sequences to learn the relationship between categories in multiple modalities and words in word sequences. We qualitatively evaluated whether our proposed model enables an agent to acquire lexical knowledge with combinatoriality and two agents to share words associated with categories in specific modalities and word sequences representing situations, compared to baseline models.\nIn the experiment of interpersonal cross-modal inference, an agent predicted the sensory-motor information of novel situations from word sequences proposed by another agent. We evaluated whether lexical knowledge facilitated by our proposed model demonstrated generalization performance to novel situations, compared to baseline models. In the experimental results, we clarified the following. The mutual exclusivity constraint, which assigns novel words to unknown situational elements, plays a crucial role in the M-H naming game with CSL for the emergence of lexical knowledge with combinatoriality. The M-H naming game enables the emergence of not only categorical signs but also lexical knowledge with combinatoriality dependent on modalities. The lexical knowledge facilitated by our proposed model exhibits generalization performance to novel situations through interpersonal cross-modal inference. As a future work, our proposed model, which handles word sequences, can be extended to a model that allows agents to communicate in natural language sentences. The ultimate goal of the series of research on symbol emergence systems  [ref]12, including this study, is to elucidate how language emerged during human evolution and how it is acquired during human cognitive development.\nBy developing a model that employs natural language sentences for agent communication, a unique language will emerge among the agents. Moreover, new insights can be gained by analyzing this process. To achieve this goal, models for natural language processing (e.g., NPYLM  and combinatory categorial grammar ) will be integrated into our proposed model to extend it for learning word order and sentence structure.\nWe will conduct experiments of symbol emergence using daily objects with complex features, such as the YCB dataset  and the Fruits 360 dataset 111Fruits 360: https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits. Thus, we are developing a mutual learning model between neural network-based feature extraction using VAE  [ref]62 , Neuro-SERKET , and PGM-based categorization and symbol emergence   .\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: which handles word sequences, can be extended to a model that allows agents to communicate in natural language sentences.
