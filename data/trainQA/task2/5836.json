We use four gradient-based methods as baselines. Since the Integrated Gradients (IG) , Guided Integrated Gradients (GIG) , and Blur Integrated Gradients (BlurIG)  offer distinct paths from the reference point to the image of interest, our approach could be applied independently to any of them because it is orthogonal to any given path. Additionally, we also include the Vanilla Gradient (VG)[ref]36, which takes the gradient of the output fc‚Äã(c)subscriptùëìùëêùëêf_{c}(c) with respect to xùë•x. We use the original implementations222https://github.com/PAIR-code/saliency with default parameters in the authors‚Äô code for IG, GIG, and BlurIG, and implement our method as an additional module that interfaces with the original implementations. Then, same as , we use a step size of 200 as the parameter needed to compute the Riemann integral for all methods except VG since it doesn‚Äôt use Riemann Integration. As is the common practice, we use the black image as the reference point for IG and GIG. Models. We use the TensorFlow (2.3.0) pre-trained models: DenseNet{121, 169, 201} 8, InceptionV3 , MobileNetV2 7, ResNet{50, 101, 151}V2 6, VGG{16, 19} [ref]37, and Xception . Dataset. Following the research    [ref]29, we use the Imagenet 2 validation dataset, which contains 50K test samples with labels and annotations. We test the explanation methods for each model on images that the model predicted the label correctly. Hence, the number of test images varies from 33K to 39K corresponding to different models. Evaluation metrics. We use numerous metrics to quantitatively evaluate our method and compare it with baselines: Insertion score [ref]29 , the Softmax information curves (SIC), the Accuracy information curves (AIC)  , and three Weakly Supervised Localization   metrics. We also introduce a modified version of SIC and AIC with MS-SSIM information level. We implement all the evaluation metrics as they were introduced in the previous works, and we discuss the implementation details in Sec.¬†4.3-4.6.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: point to the image of interest, our approach could be applied independently to any of them because it is orthogonal to any given path.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
