      "content": "Paper Title: ResizeMix: Mixing Data with Preserved Object Information and True Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved great success in a wide range of computer vision applications, \\eg, image classification [ref]24 , object detection  , and semantic segmentation   \\etc. Recent optimization techniques have further promoted the CNN performance to a new level, including data augmentation  [ref]51, optimizer design  , learning rate schedule , and hyper-parameter optimizing  2 \\etc. Notably, the strategy of data augmentation plays a critically important role in broadening the distribution of data, which facilitates the generalization ability of the trained CNN, and effectively promotes the final performance. Advanced data augmentation methods have been widely explored for training stronger neural networks. A series of data augmentation methods   [ref]51 aim at mixing data to increase the data diversity. Meanwhile, the mixed data forces the network to pay attention to multiple objects and locations in the input image, which strengthens the feature extraction ability of the networks. Especially, as shown in Fig. 1(a), CutMix [ref]51 achieves very promising results on image classification by randomly cutting a source patch from a source image and pasting it on the target image at the same location. The ground truth labels are accordingly mixed proportionally to the patch area, which leads to a multi-label training style. However, the mixing strategy with a random manner may mislead the training, as the cropped patch usually does not conform to the label of the whole image. Subsequent researches  [ref]22  make efforts to mix the data more precisely, most of which take full advantages of the saliency information and use the location of the salient regions in the image to guide the mixing. The saliency-guided method facilitates the consistency of the mixed data and the allocated ground truth labels. This alleviates the misleading caused by the random mixing strategy during training, and further promotes the neural network performance. However, the procedure of locating the salient region of the image always requires a complicated module and introduces additional computation cost during training, \\eg, PuzzleMix  proposes to optimize the mixing mask and the saliency discounted transportation, and SaliencyMix  uses a saliency detection module to select the saliency source patch for mixing. In this paper, we systematically check the importance of the image saliency information for data mixing during network training. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the checking is performed mainly from two aspects, \\iewhether the saliency information is necessary for determining (i) where to paste the source patch and (ii) how to obtain the source patch. For evaluating the two questions, we employ a Grad-CAM  module to locate the salient region in the image, and perform a series of studies about the saliency information for mixing. As a consequence, for (i), we find that the saliency-guided location surpasses that in CutMix, which keeps the location consistent in the two mixing images; while randomly determining the pasting location further surpasses the saliency-guided location. This indicates that the saliency information indeed facilitates the pasting location determining, but is defeated by the random location in terms of the data diversity. For (ii), the cropped patch from the salient region only achieves similar performance with the randomly cropped patch. How to obtain a better image patch for mixing still remains an unsolved question. As shown in Fig. 1(a), we deduce the cutting manner for obtaining the image patch is easy to cause label misallocation due to the semantic inconsistency between the cropped patch and the whole source image, and object information missing which is verified in our experiment. Based on the above clues, we propose a novel and effective data mixing method, namely ResizeMix, which directly resizes the image and pastes the resized patch on another image. ResizeMix eliminates the label misallocation issue and preserves substantial information for mixing. The proposed ResizeMix consistently outperforms CutMix [ref]51 and latter saliency-guided methods  [ref]22  on both CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks. When transferred to the MS-COCO object detection task, the model trained on ImageNet with ResizeMix shows evident advantages over CutMix. We summarize our contributions as follows. Considering saliency information is widely used in recent mixing-based augmentation methods, we systematically check the importance of the saliency information, and find that saliency information is not so necessary for mixing data. We verify that cropping the patch for mixing is easy to cause label misallocation and object information missing, and propose a new mixing method ResizeMix, which resolves the two issues by directly resizing the image for mixing. The proposed ResizeMix shows evident advantages over CutMix and the saliency-guided methods on both image classification and object detection tasks without any additional computation cost, which even outperforms most costly search-based automatic augmentation methods.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved great success in a wide range of computer vision applications, \\eg, image classification [ref]24 , object detection  , and semantic segmentation   \\etc. Recent optimization techniques have further promoted the CNN performance to a new level, including data augmentation  [ref]51,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
