      "content": "Paper Title: Tracking Changing Probabilities via Dynamic Learners\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nData streams from a real world application are often the\nresult of the confluence of multiple interacting and changing\n(external) complex processes. But even if we assume there is a\n(stationary) DI ùí´ùí´\\mathcal{P} that is sampled iid, and thus true PRs exist,\nremaining valid for some period of time, see Sect. 2.1.1),\nmost often, we do not have access to ùí´ùí´\\mathcal{P}.\nThis is a major challenge to evaluating probabilistic predictions.\nThere exist much work and considerable published research literature,\nin diverse domains such as meteorology and finance,\naddressing the issues of unknown underlying PRs, when predicting\nwith (estimated) PRs. In particular, the concept of proper\nscoring rules has been developed to encourage reliable\nprobability forecasts999Other terms used in the literature\ninclude calibrated, honest, trust-worthy, and incentive-compatible\nprobabilities. \n     [ref]46. A\nproper scoring rule would lead to the best possible score (lowest if\ndefined as costs, as we do here) if the technique‚Äôs PR outputs\nmatched the true PRs. Not all scoring rules are proper, for\ninstance, plain absolute loss (and linear scoring) is not proper\n. And some are strictly proper, i.e.¬†the true DI is the unique minimizer of the score . Two major\nfamilies of proper scoring rules are either based on (simple functions\nof) the predicted PRs raised to a power, a quadratic variant is named\nafter Brier , or based on the logarithm (log\nprobability ratios)  : log-loss and\nvariants. Propriety may not be sufficient, and a scoring rule also\nimplicitly imposes measures of closeness or (statistical) distance on\nthe space of candidate SDs, and we may prefer one score over\nanother based on their differences in sensitivity. We review proper scoring and the two major proper scorers below,\nlog-loss and quadratic loss, specializing their distance property for\nour more general setting of SDs in particular, and we argue below,\nthat in our utility-based or reward-based application, we strongly\nfavor log-loss over quadratic scoring, for its better support for PRs with different scales and decision theoretic use of the estimations,\nand despite several desirable properties of the quadratic (such as\nboundedness and symmetry) in contrast to log-loss, and that we have\nto do extra work to adapt log-loss for handling 0 PRs (NS items). See also   for other considerations in\nfavor of log-loss .\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: rules has been developed to encourage reliable\nprobability forecasts999Other terms used in the literature\ninclude calibrated, honest, trust-worthy, and incentive-compatible\nprobabilities. \n     [ref]46.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
