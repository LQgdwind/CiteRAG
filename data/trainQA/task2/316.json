Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

An infinite run is 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}-compliant if the\nset of processes that are correct in that run belongs to 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}.\nAn (adversarial) 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}-model 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}-model is thus defined as the set of\n𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}-compliant runs. An adversary is superset-closed [ref]23 if each\nsuperset of a live set of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is also an element of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}, i.e.,\nif ∀S∈𝒜for-all𝑆𝒜\\forall S\\in\\mathcal{A}, ∀S′⊆Πfor-allsuperscript𝑆′Π\\forall S^{\\prime}\\subseteq\\Pi, S⊆S′⟹S′∈𝒜𝑆superscript𝑆′superscript𝑆′𝒜S\\subseteq S^{\\prime}\\implies S^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{A}.\nSuperset-closed adversaries provide a non-uniform\ngeneralization of the classical t𝑡t-resilient adversaries.\nAn adversary 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is symmetric if it only depends on the sizes\nof live sets, and not on process identifiers:\n∀S∈𝒜for-all𝑆𝒜\\forall S\\in\\mathcal{A}, ∀S′⊆Πfor-allsuperscript𝑆′Π\\forall S^{\\prime}\\subseteq\\Pi, |S′|=|S|⟹S′∈𝒜superscript𝑆′𝑆superscript𝑆′𝒜|S^{\\prime}|=|S|\\implies S^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{A}.\nIntroduced as symmetric progress conditions in ,\nsymmetric adversaries provide a generalization of t𝑡t-resilience\nand k𝑘k-obstruction-freedom. The agreement power of a model, i.e.,\nthe smallest k𝑘k such that k𝑘k-set consensus is solvable,\nwas determined for adversaries in \nin order to characterize the power of adversaries in solving\ncolorless tasks . It is formalized as follows: [Agreement power] With 𝒜|Pevaluated-at𝒜𝑃\\mathcal{A}|_{P} the adversary composed of the live sets of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} included in P𝑃P.\nAs previously shown in , for a superset-closed adversary 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}, the agreement power of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}\nis equal to 𝑐𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒​(𝒜)𝑐𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒𝒜\\mathit{csize}(\\mathcal{A}), where 𝑐𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒​(𝒜)𝑐𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒𝒜\\mathit{csize}(\\mathcal{A}) is\nthe size of the minimal hitting set of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}, i.e., a set intersecting with each L∈𝒜𝐿𝒜L\\in\\mathcal{A}.\nFor a symmetric adversary 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}, the agreement power formula reduces to\n𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑛​(𝒜)=|{k∈{1,…,n}:∃S∈𝒜,|S|=k}|𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑛𝒜conditional-set𝑘1…𝑛formulae-sequence𝑆𝒜𝑆𝑘\\mathit{setcon}(\\mathcal{A})=|\\{k\\in\\{1,\\dots,n\\}:\\exists S\\in\\mathcal{A},|S|=k\\}|.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: are correct in that run belongs to 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}.\nAn (adversarial) 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}-model 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}-model is thus defined as the set of\n𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}-compliant runs.
