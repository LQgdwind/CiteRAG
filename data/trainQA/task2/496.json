      "content": "Paper Title: A Formal Language Approach to Explaining RNNsThe source code is available at https://github.com/bishwamittra/LEXR\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, especially in deep neural networks, have shown the great potential of algorithmic decision making in a host of different applications.\nThe inherent black-box nature of today’s complex machine learning models, however, has raised concerns regarding their safety, reliability, and fairness.\nIn fact, the lack of explanations as to why a learning-based system has made a certain decision has not only been identified as a major problem by the scientific community but also by society at large.\nA prominent example for this is the European Union, who considers imposing a “right to explanation” to future algorithmic decision making . The task of explaining the decisions of feed-forward networks has received significant attention in the last years.\nA recent survey by Du, Liu, and Hu  categorizes existing techniques to increase the interpretability of machine learning along two dimensions:\n\n\n(a) whether the techniques are intrinsic   2 (i.e., have explainability build into the model) or post-hoc    (i.e., explain an existing black-box model) and\n\n(b) whether the explanation is local [ref]6  (i.e., specific to an input or a restricted region of the input space) or global  (i.e., explaining the behavior on all possible inputs).\n\n\nHowever, comparatively less attention has been put on explaining recurrent neural networks (RNNs), albeit them being a class of neural networks that is routinely used in many practical applications, such as time series prediction  , speech recognition , and robot control . In this work, we address the problem of generating post-hoc explanations for recurrent neural networks (i.e., we assume the RNN to be given as a black-box).\nAs this problem is extremely challenging in its generality, we focus on so-called RNN acceptors  , which are recurrent neural networks whose output is fed into a binary classifier (e.g., a linear classifier, a deep neural network, etc.) and, hence, either “accept” or “reject” their input.\nThis kind of neural network has close connections to formal languages, and various approaches to extract explanations in the form of deterministic finite automata (DFAs) have been proposed recently  .\nDue to their operational nature, however, DFAs are not always easy to understand—they describe how a language is computed but not what this language is.\nMoreover, the aforementioned DFA extraction techniques tend to produce large automata, containing hundreds of states and transitions, because they search for global explanations of RNN acceptors. To alleviate these practical shortcomings, we propose a method to generate declarative, local explanations in a formal description language called Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) .\nRoughly speaking, LTL is an extension of propositional logic that uses temporal modalities, such as 𝖷𝖷\\operatorname{\\mathsf{X}} (“next”), 𝖥𝖥\\operatorname{\\mathsf{F}} (“finally”), 𝖦𝖦\\operatorname{\\mathsf{G}} (“globally”), and 𝖴𝖴\\operatorname{\\mathsf{U}} (“until”), to express properties about sequences in an intuitive and easy-to-understand way.\nFor instance, the LTL formula 𝖥⁡(a∧𝖷⁡(𝖦⁡b))𝖥𝑎𝖷𝖦𝑏\\operatorname{\\mathsf{F}}(a\\wedge\\operatorname{\\mathsf{X}}(\\operatorname{\\mathsf{G}}b)) states that there exists a position in the sequence (𝖥𝖥\\operatorname{\\mathsf{F}}) where proposition a𝑎a holds and from the next position onwards (𝖷𝖷\\operatorname{\\mathsf{X}}), proposition b𝑏b always holds (𝖦𝖦\\operatorname{\\mathsf{G}}).\nAs can be seen from this example, LTL features a variable-free syntax and is very close to plain English, two properties that have contributed greatly to its adoption as the de facto standard for specifying reactive systems (e.g., see various textbooks on formal verification  ).\nIn addition, Camacho and McIlraith  have recently proposed to use LTL for AI-related tasks, including plan intent recognition, knowledge extraction, and reward function learning. The main contribution of this paper is a novel framework, named LEXR (LTL explains RNNs) for explaining the decision making of RNN acceptors using LTL.\nIn contrast to the existing DFA extraction methods, LEXR allows the user to query regions of the input space (expressed in LTL) and generates local explanations for the behavior of the RNN acceptor inside such a region.\nAt its heart lies an iterative procedure that combines inductive methods from the area of machine learning and deductive constraint satisfaction techniques to infer an LTL formula that is a probably approximately correct (PAC) [ref]37 local explanation.\nMoreover, since the general trend in the literature is to consider smaller formulas to be more interpretable than larger ones    6 , LEXR spends additional computational effort to synthesize formulas of minimal size. To assess the explanatory performance of LEXR, we have implemented a Python prototype and compared it to the DFA extraction method of Mayr and Yovine , which also uses PAC learning.\nOur experimental results on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that LEXR’s explanations are often small and typically more accurate than the DFAs generated by Mayr and Yovine’s approach.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: whether the techniques are intrinsic   2 (i.e., have explainability build into the model) or post-hoc    (i.e., explain an existing black-box model) and\n\n(b) whether the explanation is local [ref]6  (i.e., specific to an input or a restricted region of the input space) or global  (i.e., explaining the behavior on all possible inputs).\n\n\nHowever, comparatively less attention has been put\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
