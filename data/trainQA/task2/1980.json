      "content": "Paper Title: Accuracy-Privacy Trade-off in Deep Ensemble: A Membership Inference Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe explore a wide range of datasets that are often used in deep ensemble literature or membership inference literature: Adult444http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult, Texas, Purchase [ref]15, MNIST [ref]39, FMNIST , SVHN , CIFAR10 , CIFAR100 , and ImageNet . For non-image datasets (Adult, Purchase, and Texas), we use a fully connected neural network consisting of a hidden layer of size 128 and a Softmax layer. All other training parameters for these datasets are set as suggested in [ref]15. For image datasets, we use a wide range of convolutional neural networks depending on the input dimension and the difficulty of the task. We use the model implementations adopted in  https://github.com/bearpaw/pytorch-classification. We train 10 models for each dataset with random initialization and construct an ensemble of 2, 5 and 10 models, respectively. Attack models for Shokri and Watson attacks are NNs with three hidden layers of size 128, 128, and 64, respectively. In this section, we consider a scenario that is most advantageous to the attacker where 80%percent8080\\% of the training dataset is given to the attacker and the goal is to infer the membership of the remaining samples, similar to . This can be construed as an upper-bound for the confidence-based attacks that does not use difficulty calibration. We explore Shokri and Watson attacks in the next sections. For sampling attack, we perturb each sample 50 times and count the number of time the prediction label has changes, as in [ref]12. For ImageNet, we attack a set of samples including 50 member and nonmember images per class. We explore a random set of ten hyper-parameters, including the one proposed in [ref]12, for the noise perturbation and report the highest attack performance. Here, we only report AUC of membership inference attacks. In practice, the attacker needs to train shadow models to estimate the best threshold value which may result in less accurate attack. All other training parameters are set as suggested in .\nSee Appendix A.2 for more results. The results of the weighted averaging, and snapshot ensembles and diversified ensemble networks are shown in Appendix A.4, and Appendix A.3, respectively. Figure 4 shows the results on all datasets. For some datasets, such as Adult, Texas, and MNIST, deep ensemble approach barely changes the accuracy or privacy. That is because the disagreement across models is insignificant in these datasets. For all other datasets, deep ensemble approach improves the accuracy (blue/red curves) as well as the effectiveness of confidence-based membership inference attacks (green curves). As mentioned in Section 4.2, the most salient factor in membership inference effectiveness on deep ensembles is the accuracy gap between train and test set. Figure 4 clearly shows that whenever this generalization gap is large for non-ensemble case, the attack improvement is significant using ensembling. It is worth noting that the ensembling can often reduce the generalization gap and the effectiveness of the gap attack (e.g., CIFAR10-DenseNet-100, CIFAR100-AlexNet, or CIFAR100-ResNet20). However, due to the reasons explained in Section 4.4, the membership inference effectiveness still increases. Interestingly, the effectiveness of sampling attack, unlike confidence-based attacks, often decreases on deep ensembles (brown curves). The main reason is that deeps ensembles are more robust than a single model, as shown in  . Therefore, perturbing target samples to obtain information about its membership status is less effective in deep ensembles. Another observation is that maximum agreed confidence ensembling (yellow curves) can considerably mitigate the effectiveness of confidence-based membership inference. Figure 5 demonstrates the improvement of accuracy and MI attack over various training epochs. For datasets that ensembling outperforms a single model, using an ensemble of underfitted models is less prone to MI attack. However, it leads to lower accuracy. Due to the computational cost of running sampling attack, we only perform the sampling attack on certain epochs in Figure 4.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: We explore a wide range of datasets that are often used in deep ensemble literature or membership inference literature: Adult444http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult, Texas, Purchase [ref]15, MNIST [ref]39, FMNIST , SVHN , CIFAR10 , CIFAR100 , and ImageNet .
