      "content": "Paper Title: Use-Case-Grounded Simulations for Explanation Evaluation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe field of interpretable machine learning has proposed a large and diverse number of techniques to explain model behavior (e.g.,     [ref]29). A growing body of work studies which of these techniques can help humans with practical real-world use cases [ref]2   [ref]18    .\nBecause it is difficult to anticipate exactly which explanations may help humans with a particular use case  , the gold standard to evaluate an explanation’s usefulness to humans is to run a human subject study . These studies ask users a series of questions about the use case and provide the users with relevant information (such as model explanations) to answer each question. Selecting the relevant information, which we call information content, to provide each user in the human subject study comprises an important set of design decisions [ref]18 .\nThe researcher needs to consider the choice of explanation methods, hyperparameters that are used to calculate the model explanations, and whether additional pieces of information should be provided to the user (such as the model’s prediction on the data-point being explained).111We note that there are several additional user study design decisions beyond what information is shown to the user: for example, how the information is presented or visualized, the user study interface design, etc. We consider these additional design decisions to be out-of-scope for our study for reasons discussed in Appendix J.\nWhile a researcher may wish to run several user studies to evaluate many different types of information content, in practice this is often infeasible: user studies are resource intensive and time-consuming, requiring the recruitment and compensation of real users. Due to these constraints, most studies are far from comprehensive in terms of the number of design decisions evaluated.\nFor example, most user studies typically only evaluate a few explanation methods, with default hyperparameter settings, that are often arbitrarily selected based on their perceived popularity (Figure 1, Left). For example, forward simulation is a canonical use case where users are asked “Can you predict what the model’s prediction is for this individual?”   . To answer this question, the user is provided with information content, which may include data-points (e.g., the individual’s features) and model explanations for those data-points (e.g., a SHAP [ref]29 importance score for each feature). The researcher can then measure which set of information content (and consequently which explanation method) enables users to achieve the best performance (e.g. the highest accuracy when answering the use case questions).\nBeyond forward simulation, other user studies have investigated use cases ranging from model debugging to counterfactual reasoning [ref]2   [ref]18 . In this work, we introduce Use-Case-Grounded Simulated Evaluations (SimEvals): a general framework for conducting use-case-grounded, algorithmic evaluations of the information content present in a user study (Figure 1, Right). Each SimEval involves training and evaluating an algorithmic agent, which is an ML model. The agent learns to predict the ground truth label for the use case given the same information that would be presented to a user in a human subject study. The agent’s test set accuracy is a measure of whether the information content provided (which critically includes the model explanation) is predictive for the use case. By comparing the agent’s test set accuracy for different types of information content, the researcher can efficiently identify promising and eliminate unhelpful information content types (e.g. explanation methods as shown in Figure 1) to present to real humans in their final human subject study. Since SimEvals are intended to inform, not replace, human subject evaluations, we note that our algorithmic agent does not incorporate additional factors such as the effects of cognitive biases  , that may affect human decision-making (see Appendix J). In our experiments, we show that using SimEvals to measure predictive information can indeed identify which information content can help a human with a downstream use case. In this work, we focus primarily on the design choice of selecting which explanation methods to evaluate. We conduct an evaluation on a diverse set of use cases and explanation methods: (1) We compare SimEvals with findings from prior user studies, and (2) we run our own user study motivated by use cases studied in prior work. In both cases, we find that SimEval effectively distinguishes between explanations that are ultimately helpful versus unhelpful to human subjects in the user study. Our primary contributions in this work are as follows: 1. Introducing SimEvals Framework. We are the first to propose an automated use-case-grounded evaluation framework to measure the predictive information contained in the information content provided to a user in a human subject study.\nWe instantiate our framework on three diverse use cases to illustrate important differences in how SimEvals can be instantiated, showcasing how the SimEval framework covers a wide variety of real-world use cases and explanation methods. 2. Identifying Promising Explanations for Humans. We demonstrate that SimEvals can distinguish between which explanations are promising versus unhelpful for humans on each of the three use cases we consider.\nSpecifically, we find that when there is a significant gap between SimEval performance for two explanations, we observe a similar significant gap in human performance when using the same explanations.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: The field of interpretable machine learning has proposed a large and diverse number of techniques to explain model behavior (e.g.,     [ref]29).
