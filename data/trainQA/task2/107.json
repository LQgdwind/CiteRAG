      "content": "Paper Title: A Large-Scale Evaluation of Shape-Aware Neighborhood Weights and Neighborhood Sizes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this article, we investigated a family of weights (Eq. (2)) for point set processing.\nThese weights are based on the normal similarity.\nThe family includes common choices such as equal weights or sharp cut-off weights at a given threshold.\nFurthermore, we presented an evaluation model for neighborhood weights based on a Shannon entropy classification error (Eq. (7)).\nWe have performed a large-scale evaluation of our weight family on four data sets.\nThe first set consisted of 1,00010001,000 clean surface meshes from the work of .\nThe second and third set consisted of 100100100 real-world scans taken from each  and .\nAdditionally, we included a scanned model from  with over one million points. A statistical analysis revealed that the optimal weight parameters should lead to a neglect of non-similar normals, yet include mid-range normal points with a low weight.\nSpecifically, equal weights, as used in the literature discussed in Section 2 and in particular in  do not obtain minimal error values.\nFurthermore, sharp cut-off weights as used, e.g., by  do perform well on certain scanned models, but are also generally inferior to more flexible weighting terms.\nFinally, it became obvious in the evaluation that neighborhood sizes have to be variable over a point set as only these variable sizes attain minimal error values.\nThe potential of this variability of neighborhood sizes was shown by incorporating point-wise neighborhood size ranges within a normal filtering stage in a point denoising algorihtm (), yielding smaller mean squared errors compared to the original pipeline. While this article addresses a variety of possible weighting choices and neighborhood sizes, to cover the most widely used versions from the literature, several aspects are left as future work.\nFurther research consists of running the large-scale analysis on a broader range of neighborhood sizes, comparable to . Not only with the publication of the versatile PointNet architecture, machine- and deep learning techniques gradually conquered the realm of point set processing [ref]27.\nSubsequently, a wide variety of publications arose that tackle several problems related to point set processing.\nThese touch on multiple areas discussed in this paper.\nFor instance, the PointCleanNet architecture was designed for denoising and outlier removal of point sets .\nAnother representative of machine learning technology for point sets is the NormNet architecture, which derives point-wise normal estimations for three-dimensional point sets [ref]14.\nA problem naturally approached using normal information on a point cloud is (semantic) segmentation.\nIn a sense, our optimized neighborhood weights do segment the point set into several, small parts with consistent normal information.\nIn contrast, large-scale segmentation approaches via machine learning are available, e.g., utilizing edge-convolution networks .\nAll these machine learning approaches have in common that they depend on large sets of well labeled training data.\nIn its generality, our approach can add to these developments in many ways.\nAside from improving the (semi-)automated generation of training data, it can support the selection of neighborhood weights and sizes that serve as architecture input.\nAdditionally, the direct incorporation of normal information on the neighborhood-level supports topological consistence, outlier resistance, and coherence of both the considered point set as well as the algorithmic procedure applied to it.\nInvestigating these potentials of our methodology in the machine learning context is, however, left for future work. As a closing remark, we would like to point out that several algorithms developed within the geometry processing community are heavily dependent on one or more parameters.\nThese parametric values are often fine-tuned during an experimentation phase that is run on a small and limited data set.\nOur large-scale analysis in this paper highlights the importance of a systematic setup for parameter evaluation.\nIn particular, we were able to show that the usually globally chosen neighborhood size parameter yields better results when used within a bilateral weighting scheme that incorporates normal information and varying neighborhood sizes.\nWe hope that this work encourages further research on the applicability of algorithms and their parameters “in the wild” to ensure applicability and robustness of the developed methods.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: neighborhood sizes, comparable to .
