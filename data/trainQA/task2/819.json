      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Unbiased Representations via R√©nyi Minimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur experiments on real-world data are performed on five data sets.\nIn three data sets, the sensitive and the outcome true value are both continuous: the US Census data set [ref]44, the Motor data set [ref]42 and the Crime data set . On two other data sets, the target is binary and the sensitive features are continuous: The COMPAS data set¬† and the Default data set¬†. For all data sets, we repeat five experiments by randomly sampling two subsets, 80% for the training set and 20% for the test set. Finally, we report the average of the mean squared error (MSE), the accuracy (ACC) and the mean of the fairness metrics HGR_NN , HGR_KDE 3, HGR_RDC 0 and MINE  on the test set. Since none of these fairness measures are fully reliable (they are only estimations which are used by the compared models), we also use the F‚Äãa‚Äãi‚Äãr‚ÄãQ‚Äãu‚Äãa‚Äãn‚ÄãtùêπùëéùëñùëüùëÑùë¢ùëéùëõùë°FairQuant metric , based on the\nquantization of the test samples in 50 quantiles w.r.t. to the sensitive attribute. The metric corresponds to the mean absolute difference between the global average prediction and the mean prediction of each quantile.\n As a baseline, we use a classic, \"unfair\" deep neural network, Standard NN. We compare our approach with state-of-the-art algorithms. We also compare the Fair MINE NN algorithm where fairness is achieved with the MINE estimation of the mutual information as a penalization in prediction retreatment (lower right in Figure 1 in appendix).\nFor all the different fair representation algorithms, we assign the latent space with only one hidden layer with 64 units. Mean normalization was applied to all the outcome true values. Results of our experiments can be found in Table¬†2. For all of them, we attempted to obtain comparable results by giving similar accuracy to all models, via the hyperparameter ŒªùúÜ\\lambda (different for each model). For each algorithm and for each data set, we obtain the best hyperparameters by grid search in five-fold cross validation (specific to each of them). As expected, the baseline, Standard NN, is the best predictor but also the most biased one. It achieves the lowest prediction errors and ranks amongst the highest and thus worst values for all fairness measures for all data sets and tasks. While being better in terms of accuracy, our fair representation algorithm achieves on four data sets (except on the Crime data set) the best level of fairness assessed by HGR estimation, MINE and FairQuant. On the Crime data set, the approach by Mary2019¬†3¬†22footnotemark: 2 gets slightly better results but with a very high volatility. Note, Adel  with the fair adversarial representation obtains (except on the Crime data set) better results than Zhang  which corresponds to the simple adversarial architecture.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: Our experiments on real-world data are performed on five data sets.\nIn three data sets, the sensitive and the outcome true value are both continuous: the US Census data set [ref]44, the Motor data set [ref]42 and the Crime data set .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
