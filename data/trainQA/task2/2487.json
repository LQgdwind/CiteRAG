      "content": "Paper Title: SimROD: A Simple Adaptation Method for Robust Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods leverage unlabeled images from the target domain to explicitly mitigate the domain shift. In contrast to images obtained with augmentation, these unlabeled samples are more similar to the test samples as they are from the same domain. Moreover, leveraging unlabeled samples is practical since they are cheap to collect and do not require laborious annotation. Several approaches have been proposed to solve the UDA problem for object detection. Adversarial training methods such as [ref]6 learn domain-invariant representations of two-stage detector networks. Recent methods improved the performance, by mining important regions and aligning at the region-level [ref]11, by using hierarchical alignment module , by coarse-to-fine feature adaptation , or by enforcing strong local alignment and weak global alignment .  proposed a center-aware alignment method for anchor-free FCOS model. While alignment methods help reduce the domain shift, they require architecture changes since extra modules such as gradient reversal layers and domain classifiers must be added to the network. Alternatively, domain-mapping methods tackle UDA by first translating source images to images that resemble the target domain samples using a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN)  . The model is then fine-tuned with the domain-mapped images and the known source labels. For object detection, [ref]23  combined domain transfer with adversarial training. For instance, [ref]23 generates a diverse set of intermediate domains between the source and target to discriminate and learn domain-invariant features. Batch normalization (BN)  layers are prevalent in most neural\nnetworks because they can accelerate the learning, prevent overfitting\nand enable deeper networks to converge . Recent works\nhave shown that adapting BN layers can improve robustness to adversarial attacks 6 or image corruptions  and reduce domain\nshifts  .\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: since they are cheap to collect and do not require laborious annotation.
