      "content": "Paper Title: DNN-Defender: An in-DRAM Deep Neural Network Defense Mechanism for Adversarial Weight Attack\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe BFA progressively searches for vulnerable bits by first performing a bit ranking within each layer based on gradient . Considering a weight quantized DNN, the weight matrix can be parameterized by two complement representations {𝑩l}l=1Lsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑩𝑙𝑙1𝐿\\{{\\bm{\\mathsfit{B}}}_{l}\\}_{l=1}^{L}, where l∈{1,2,…,L}𝑙12…𝐿l\\in\\{1,2,...,L\\} is the layer index.\nBFA computes the gradient w.r.t. each bit of the model (|∇𝑩lℒ|subscript∇subscript𝑩𝑙ℒ|\\nabla_{{\\bm{\\mathsfit{B}}}_{l}}\\mathcal{L}|) where ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} is the inference loss function. At each iteration, the attacker performs two key attack steps: i) Inter-layer search and ii) intra-layer search; where the goal is to identify a vulnerable weight bit and flip it. Given a sample input x𝑥x and label t𝑡t, the BFA  algorithm tries to maximize the following loss function (ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}): while ensuring the hamming distance between the perturbed weight tensor by BFA (𝑩^l=1Lsuperscriptsubscript^𝑩𝑙1𝐿\\hat{{\\bm{\\mathsfit{B}}}}_{l=1}^{L}) and initial weight tensor ({𝑩l}l=1Lsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑩𝑙𝑙1𝐿\\{{\\bm{\\mathsfit{B}}}_{l}\\}_{l=1}^{L}) remains minimum. Finally, the attack efficiency can be measured by the number of bit-flips required to cause DNN malfunction. Figure 1(b) illustrates how the DNN accuracy degrades under a few (less than 5) targeted bit-flips using DeepHammer attack 7 in an 8-bit quantized ResNet-34 running the ImageNet [ref]18 dataset as opposed to over 100 random bit-flip attacks.\nFigure 3 illustrates how such an adversarial weight attack is conducted in an L𝐿L-layer DNN on the target Wlk​1subscript𝑊subscript𝑙𝑘1W_{l_{k1}} = 1001, i.e., the weight located in the lksubscript𝑙𝑘l_{k} layer. The malicious process continuously hammers the aggressor row in a𝑎a-address and induces bit-flips on adjacent victim rows (a−1𝑎1a-1 and a+1𝑎1a+1) holding Wlk​1subscript𝑊subscript𝑙𝑘1W_{l_{k1}}. As a result, such a single-sided RH attack changes the weight value (herein, 1001→→\\rightarrow0011). Both hardware-level and software-level mitigation mechanisms have been actively followed to eliminate, control, or reduce RH vulnerability on next-generation DDRx systems. The hardware-based efforts can be classified into two categories, i.e., victim-focused and aggressor-focused mechanisms.\nThe system manufacturers consider victim-focused RH defense solutions such as increased refresh rates and hardware RHP 8 9 . Along this line, Target Row Refresh (TRR)  and other counter-based detection methods    require add-on hardware to calculate rows’ activation and record it to other fast-read-memory (SRAM /CAM ). The controller will then refresh the target row if the number reaches the RH threshold (TR​Hsubscript𝑇𝑅𝐻T_{RH}) . However, such proactive refreshing proposals have faced a huge overhead both from latency and power consumption perspectives. Moreover, the system yet relies on a fast-read memory such as SRAM or CAM for storing the activation count table. Recent RH protection mechanisms   consider a uniform attack pattern and set the number of activation needed for bit-flip to a certain value for every row in DRAM. In fact, certain attacks can flip victim rows with significantly fewer activations. Besides, the hardware overhead increases linearly based on the DRAM capacity and the number of protected rows. To solve this issue, the recent literature suggests protecting only a critical part of the memory rather than the complete data . Among the aggressor-focused RH mitigation mechanism, the Randomized Row-Swap (RRS)  swaps the aggressor row with a random row within the same bank in the memory as shown in Fig. 4. A method called Secure Row-Swap (SRS)  has demonstrated the use of fewer counters for crucial data and implemented associated threat mitigation using the swap operation. This approach reduces the swap rate while maintaining security, resulting in higher efficiency and lower latency. The six-step SRS mechanism secures the DRAM not only against the RH attack but also the Juggernaut attack.\nRRS  and SRS  mechanisms can be immensely effective when the attacker does not have knowledge of the internal DRAM organization.\nAssuming the attacker’s access to this information, he/she will not track the aggressor row but the victim row and attacks its adjacent row, making it a new aggressor row. In this case, swapping the aggressor row with another random row is heedless.\nTherefore, our idea is to stop tracking the aggressor row and instead protect the victim row directly when the attacker is capable of tracking the essential data (i.e., the victim row). With this, we not only save the tracking cost in prior works but also ignore the attacker’s tracking and directly protect the victim row. Prior software-based efforts have approached the problem of weight noise mitigation from a software-training optimization perspective, including weight binarization , piece-wise weight clustering , weight encoding  , and DNN architecture modification [ref]16 . Among them, the binarization of the weight and activation  [ref]16 have shown significant improvement in limiting the efficacy of BFA but sacrificing clean accuracy. While our proposed method will not require any software training, it is not a competing method against DNN training algorithms. In other words, any training algorithm or software optimization can be readily incorporated into our protection scheme to boost defense performance.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: DNN malfunction.
