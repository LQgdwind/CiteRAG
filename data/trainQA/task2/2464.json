More specifically, let x=(x1⊤,…,xN⊤)⊤𝑥superscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑥1top…superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑁toptopx=(x_{1}^{\\top},...,x_{N}^{\\top})^{\\top}, where xi∈ℝqisubscript𝑥𝑖superscriptℝsubscript𝑞𝑖x_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{q_{i}} is the state of each agent i𝑖i, and ∑i=1Nqi=qsuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑁subscript𝑞𝑖𝑞\\sum_{i=1}^{N}q_{i}=q. Similarly, let ξ=(ξ1⊤,…,ξN⊤)⊤𝜉superscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝜉1top…superscriptsubscript𝜉𝑁toptop\\xi=(\\xi_{1}^{\\top},...,\\xi_{N}^{\\top})^{\\top}, where ξi∈ℝpisubscript𝜉𝑖superscriptℝsubscript𝑝𝑖\\xi_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p_{i}} denotes the noisy exploratory input applied to agent i𝑖i, and ∑i=1Npi=psuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑁subscript𝑝𝑖𝑝\\sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}=p. Different agents may have different dimensional states and noise vectors, and each agent i𝑖i only has access to a local observation hi​(x𝒩i,ξ𝒩i)subscriptℎ𝑖subscript𝑥subscript𝒩𝑖subscript𝜉subscript𝒩𝑖h_{i}(x_{\\mathcal{N}_{i}},\\xi_{\\mathcal{N}_{i}}), i=1,…,N𝑖1…𝑁i=1,...,N. Here x𝒩i={xj,j∈𝒩i}subscript𝑥subscript𝒩𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗𝑗subscript𝒩𝑖x_{\\mathcal{N}_{i}}=\\{x_{j},j\\in\\mathcal{N}_{i}\\} and ξ𝒩i={ξj,j∈𝒩i}subscript𝜉subscript𝒩𝑖subscript𝜉𝑗𝑗subscript𝒩𝑖\\xi_{\\mathcal{N}_{i}}=\\{\\xi_{j},j\\in\\mathcal{N}_{i}\\} are the vectors composed of the state and noise information of the agents in 𝒩isubscript𝒩𝑖\\mathcal{N}_{i}, respectively, where 𝒩i={j∈𝒱:(j,i)∈ℰ}subscript𝒩𝑖conditional-set𝑗𝒱𝑗𝑖ℰ\\mathcal{N}_{i}=\\{j\\in\\mathcal{V}:(j,i)\\in\\mathcal{E}\\} contains its neighbors determined by the graph222Here graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} can be either undirected or directed. In Section IV where our algorithm is applied to the LQR problem, graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} corresponds to the learning graph. 𝒢=(𝒱,ℰ)𝒢𝒱ℰ\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E}). Note that each vertex in graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is considered to have a self-loop, i.e., i∈𝒩i𝑖subscript𝒩𝑖i\\in\\mathcal{N}_{i}. At this moment we do not impose other conditions for 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}, instead, we give Assumption 2 on those local observations, based on which we propose our distributed RL algorithm. In Section IV, when applying our RL algorithm to a model-free multi-agent LQR problem, the details about how to design the inter-agent interaction graph for validity of Assumption 2 will be introduced. There exist local cost functions fi​(x)=𝔼ξ∼𝒟​[hi​(x𝒩i,ξ𝒩i)]subscript𝑓𝑖𝑥subscript𝔼similar-to𝜉𝒟delimited-[]subscriptℎ𝑖subscript𝑥subscript𝒩𝑖subscript𝜉subscript𝒩𝑖f_{i}(x)=\\mathbb{E}_{\\xi\\sim\\mathcal{D}}[h_{i}(x_{\\mathcal{N}_{i}},\\xi_{\\mathcal{N}_{i}})] such that for any i∈𝒱𝑖𝒱i\\in\\mathcal{V} and x∈𝒳𝑥𝒳x\\in\\mathcal{X}, hi​(⋅,⋅):ℝ∑j∈𝒩iqj×ℝ∑j∈𝒩ipj→ℝ≥0:subscriptℎ𝑖⋅⋅→superscriptℝsubscript𝑗subscript𝒩𝑖subscript𝑞𝑗superscriptℝsubscript𝑗subscript𝒩𝑖subscript𝑝𝑗subscriptℝabsent0h_{i}(\\cdot,\\cdot):\\mathbb{R}^{\\sum_{j\\in\\mathcal{N}_{i}}q_{j}}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{\\sum_{j\\in\\mathcal{N}_{i}}p_{j}}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0} satisfies and Inequality (9) is used to build a relationship between hi​(x,ξ)subscriptℎ𝑖𝑥𝜉h_{i}(x,\\xi) and its expectation w.r.t. ξ𝜉\\xi. Note that (9) is the only condition for the random variable ξ𝜉\\xi, and ξ𝜉\\xi does not necessarily have a zero mean. If hi​(x,ξ)subscriptℎ𝑖𝑥𝜉h_{i}(x,\\xi) is continuous in ξ𝜉\\xi for any x∈𝒳𝑥𝒳x\\in\\mathcal{X}, the assumption (9) holds when the random variable ξ𝜉\\xi is bounded. When ξ𝜉\\xi is unbounded, for example, ξ𝜉\\xi follows a sub-Gaussian distribution, (9) may hold with a high probability, see . A truncation approach can be used when evaluating the local costs to ensure the boundedness of the observation if ξ𝜉\\xi follows a standard Gaussian distribution. To show that Assumption 2 is reasonable, we give a class of feasible examples. Consider where Fi​j​(⋅,⋅,⋅,⋅):ℝqi×ℝqj×ℝpi×ℝpj:subscript𝐹𝑖𝑗⋅⋅⋅⋅superscriptℝsubscript𝑞𝑖superscriptℝsubscript𝑞𝑗superscriptℝsubscript𝑝𝑖superscriptℝsubscript𝑝𝑗F_{ij}(\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot):\\mathbb{R}^{q_{i}}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{q_{j}}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{p_{i}}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{p_{j}} is locally Lipschitz continuous and has a locally Lipschitz continuous gradient w.r.t. xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} and xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j}, ℰℰ\\mathcal{E} is the edge set of a graph characterizing the inter-agent coupling relationship in the objective function, and 𝒟isubscript𝒟𝑖\\mathcal{D}_{i} for each i∈𝒱𝑖𝒱i\\in\\mathcal{V} is a bounded distribution with zero mean. By setting hi​(x𝒩i,ξ𝒩i)=∑j∈𝒩iFi​j​(xi,xj,ξi,ξj)subscriptℎ𝑖subscript𝑥subscript𝒩𝑖subscript𝜉subscript𝒩𝑖subscript𝑗subscript𝒩𝑖subscript𝐹𝑖𝑗subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗subscript𝜉𝑖subscript𝜉𝑗h_{i}(x_{\\mathcal{N}_{i}},\\xi_{\\mathcal{N}_{i}})=\\sum_{j\\in\\mathcal{N}_{i}}F_{ij}(x_{i},x_{j},\\xi_{i},\\xi_{j}), Assumption 2 is satisfied. If we define the domain 𝒳=𝒳1×⋯×𝒳N𝒳subscript𝒳1⋯subscript𝒳𝑁\\mathcal{X}=\\mathcal{X}_{1}\\times\\cdots\\times\\mathcal{X}_{N} as a strategy set, the formulation (1) with (11) can be viewed as a cooperative networking game , where xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} is the decision variable of player i𝑖i, each pair of players aim to minimize Fi​jsubscript𝐹𝑖𝑗F_{ij}, and ξisubscript𝜉𝑖\\xi_{i} is the random effect on the observation of each player. Moreover, the objective function (11) has also been employed in many multi-agent coordination problems  such as consensus  and formation control [ref]27. As a specific example, consider Fi​j​(xi,xj,ξi,ξj)=‖xi+ξi−xj−ξj‖2subscript𝐹𝑖𝑗subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗subscript𝜉𝑖subscript𝜉𝑗superscriptnormsubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝜉𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗subscript𝜉𝑗2F_{ij}(x_{i},x_{j},\\xi_{i},\\xi_{j})=\\|x_{i}+\\xi_{i}-x_{j}-\\xi_{j}\\|^{2}. In this case, the objective is consensus where ξisubscript𝜉𝑖\\xi_{i} and ξjsubscript𝜉𝑗\\xi_{j} model bounded noise effects in the measurement of xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} and xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j}, respectively. A direct consequence of Assumption 2 is that fi​(x)subscript𝑓𝑖𝑥f_{i}(x) is locally Lipschitz continuous and has a locally Lipschitz continuous gradient w.r.t. xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i}. Moreover, the two Lipschitz constants are the same as those of f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x). In this paper, with the help of Assumption 2, we will propose a novel distributed zeroth-order algorithm, in which the local gradient of each agent is estimated based upon the local observations hisubscriptℎ𝑖h_{i}’s directly.\nThe problem we aim to solve is summarized as follows:\n Under Assumptions 1-2, given an initial state x0∈𝒳superscript𝑥0𝒳x^{0}\\in\\mathcal{X}, design a distributed algorithm for each agent i𝑖i based on the local observation333Since x𝒩isubscript𝑥subscript𝒩𝑖x_{\\mathcal{N}_{i}} is composed of partial elements of x𝑥x, for symbol simplicity, we write the local cost function for each agent i𝑖i as hi​(x,ξ)subscriptℎ𝑖𝑥𝜉h_{i}(x,\\xi) and treat hi​(⋅,⋅)subscriptℎ𝑖⋅⋅h_{i}(\\cdot,\\cdot) as a mapping from ℝq×ℝpsuperscriptℝ𝑞superscriptℝ𝑝\\mathbb{R}^{q}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{p} to ℝ≥0subscriptℝabsent0\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0} while keeping in mind that hi​(x,ξ)subscriptℎ𝑖𝑥𝜉h_{i}(x,\\xi) only involves agent i𝑖i and its neighbors. hi​(x,ξ)subscriptℎ𝑖𝑥𝜉h_{i}(x,\\xi) such that by implementing the algorithm, the state x𝑥x converges to a stationary point of f𝑓f.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: the random effect on the observation of each player.
