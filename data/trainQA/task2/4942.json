      "content": "Paper Title: Facial Action Units Detection Aided by Global-Local Expression Embedding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFacial Action Units (AUs), coded by Facial Action Coding System (FACS), include 32 atomic facial action descriptors based on facial muscle groups .\nFace AU detection has attracted lots of research efforts due to its crucial applications in emotion recognition , micro-expression detection , and mental health diagnosis [ref]29. Since AU annotations require sophisticated expertise and are time-consuming, the size of annotated AU datasets is usually limited, especially in terms of identity variations. e.g., less than 50.\nAs a result, most AU detection methods overfit to the training identities and do not generalize well to new subjects.\nTo alleviate the overfitting problem on the small AU datasets, previous methods resort to various auxiliary information as regularization, including facial landmarks   [ref]31 , unsupervised web images , emotion priors , textual AU descriptions and so on.\nHowever, these additional constraints do not directly remove the interference of the training identities from the extracted visual features, thus limiting their performance. Different from the previous works, we aim to make the first attempt to employ an expression embedding extracted from the in-the-wild expression dataset  [ref]36 without AU labels.\nThe embedding can provide a strong prior for AU detection due to the two important properties: continuity and identity-independence.\nFirst, the embedding provides a continuous space for representing the fine-grained expressions. It is beneficial for AU detection since AUs usually show slight variations on the face.\nSecond, the embedding is less sensitive to identities because the semantic similar expressions of different identities are analogous in the embedding space.\nThis important property can be used to alleviate the overfitting problem in AU detection.\nHence, our motivation is to leverage a continuous expression embedding space to represent AUs for accurate AU detection.\n Driven by our motivation, we develop a novel AU detection framework aided by the Global-Local facial Expression Embedding, namely GLEE-Net. Our GLEE-Net consists of three branches that extract identity-independent facial expression features for AU detection.\nTo comprehend the overall facial expressions, we introduce a global branch that modeling the expression information as the deviation from the identity representation.\nIn this way, our global branch would be less sensitive to the identity information.\nConsidering AUs are defined on local face regions, we design a local branch to focus on details of specific face regions.\nIn order to alleviate the problem of limited identities in AU datasets, different from existing methods with global and local branches, we first pretrain the two branches on an expression dataset [ref]36 and then finetune them on the target AU dataset.\nIn this manner, our network has seen various subjects’ expressions although their AU labels are not available and moreover, acquires a compact expression embedding for AU detection.\nIn Figure 1, we sample some images from BP4D and visualize their expression embeddings. As expected, the same AU combinations and similar expressions from different identities are close in our expression embedding space, thus facilitating AU classification. Furthermore, in contrast to existing methods that only rely on auxiliary information of 2D images, we find that 3D facial information also provides important expression clues. Thus, we introduce a 3D global branch to obtain expression coefficients, as 3D expression features, through 3D face reconstruction.\nTo fully exploit all the representations from our global-local branches, we design a Transformer-based multi-label classifier. Benefiting from the powerful global attention mechanism of Transformer , we can effectively fuse different representations and thus explore the correlations among multiple AUs. With the co-occurrence relationships of AUs, our network can predict AUs more accurately.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly achieves superior performance on the widely-used DISFA, BP4D and BP4D+ datasets. In summary, the contributions of our work are three-fold: We propose a novel Global-Local facial Expression Embedding Network (GLEE-Net) for AU detection, which can leverage additional facial expression data (without AU labels) to improve AU detection accuracy. We develop the global and local branches to extract the compact expression embeddings from face regions while paying attention to local facial details.\nTo the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to utilize continuous and compact expression features to represent AUs effectively. It achieves appealing generalization capability in addressing AU classification for unseen identities. We introduce a 3D global branch to extract expression coefficients through 3D face reconstruction for AU detection, and demonstrate that exploiting 3D face priors can further improve 2D AU detection.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: on facial muscle groups .\nFace AU detection has attracted lots of research efforts due to its crucial applications in emotion recognition , micro-expression detection , and mental health diagnosis [ref]29.
