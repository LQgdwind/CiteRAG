      "content": "Paper Title: Evaluating the Robustness of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Policies in a Multi-agent Urban Driving Environment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAutonomous cars (ACs) are complex decision-making systems that are unfortunately prone to errors . They commonly use machine/deep learning algorithms as part of decision-making software, which is known to be difficult to validate [ref]2 . Therefore, ACs need comprehensive training and evaluation in order to minimize risk to the public. For the same reason, autonomous driving (AD) research is nowadays performed within simulated driving environments (also used by the state-of-the-art industrial solutions like Tesla  and Comma ai [ref]5), as they provide flexibility for testing and validating AD without posing any danger to the real world. However, we observe three specific challenges in training and validating ACs in the existing simulation environments. First, while the majority of AD research is focused on using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for training ACs in a simulated urban driving scenario [ref]60, there is a lack of comparison among DRL algorithms for vision-based urban driving scenarios. Having such a benchmark of commonly used DRL algorithms can be useful for understanding why some algorithms perform worse than others in specific driving scenarios, which can lead to the improvements of the state-of-art DRL algorithms for AD. Second, the majority of existing research trains ACs as non-communicating and independent single intelligent agents 12, therefore treating the ACs as a single-agent driving problem. However, in the near future AD will be a complex multi-agent problem 3. By bringing more than one AC into a multi-agent environment we can evaluate how a non-stationary driving scenario affects AC’s control decisions when interacting with other ACs. Existing comparative analyses of RL algorithms for AD are still limited to single-agent driving environments 45, and there is no systematic study performed yet on which DRL models work best for AD in a multi-agent environment. Third, a vast portion of existing research is actively focused on testing ACs trained on vision-based end-to-end systems. While designing a reward function is one of the key requirements in learning an efficient and robust DRL driving agent, we lack evidence of a detailed multi-objective-based reward function that is utilized within independent multi-agent DRL algorithms. There is ongoing research on designing a better reward function 67 which is highly required for better autonomous driving, but so far they are still focused on single-agent driving scenarios. Furthermore, in order to compare which DRL works the best in single and multi-agent-focused scenarios, their reward functions must also be defined in a comprehensive way in order to perform a fair comparison in terms of robustness. As DRL heavily relies on the design of the reward function for active exploration and learning, it is necessary to consider various objectives within a reward function in order to observe and evaluate which objectives are successfully achieved by each DRL-based AC agent within different driving settings. We, therefore, also lack studies on the performance of DRL algorithms that are trying to achieve multiple goals using the reward function. To address these three challenges, in this paper we provide an open and reusable end-to-end benchmarking framework for DRL algorithms in a complex urban multi-agent AD environment. The framework enables us to bring competitive and independent driving agents in both discrete and continuous action space environments. We also propose a comprehensive multi-objective reward function designed for the evaluation of simulation-based learning of DRL AC agents. We validate the framework by performing a comprehensive comparative study of the robustness of DRL algorithms for urban driving policies in both single-agent and multi-agent AD scenarios. The key contributions in this paper are: We provide an end-to-end benchmarking framework for the systematic evaluation of DRL-based AC driving policies in complex vision-based urban driving environments. We propose a multi-objective reward function designed for the evaluation of simulation-based learning of DRL AC agents. The framework supports training and validating AC’s driving policies in both single- and multi-agent driving scenarios. The framework enables evaluating the effectiveness of AC driving agents in different environment configurations. Using the framework, we perform a comprehensive comparative study of four discrete and two continuous action space DRL algorithms for AD in vision-only high fidelity urban driving simulated environments. Drawing from the study results, we suggest some research directions on improving the robustness of DRL algorithms for AD. The implementation of our benchmarking framework, as well as all experimental results, are open and reusable, which supports the reproducibility of research in the AD domain.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: decision-making systems that are unfortunately prone to errors .
