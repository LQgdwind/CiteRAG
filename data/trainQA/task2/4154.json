      "content": "Paper Title: Collaborative Knowledge Graph Fusion by Exploiting the Open Corpus\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nJoint event extraction (JEE) aims to obtain the named entities, trigger mentions and relations simultaneously from a given corpus. Many recent works apply the pipe-lined method to achieve this task. That is to train a series of classifiers for the aforementioned sub-tasks and classify the mentions in sentences as different triggers at first. Then, with the classified triggers to identify the entity mentions or relations. StagedMaxEnt [ref]35 and TwoStageBeam  are such kind pipe-lined systems. Reranking [ref]35 is the state-of-the-art statistical pipe-lined method for the JEE task. Most neural network models apply the embedding method to capture the latent semantic relationships between sentence tokens and try to train different classifiers for different sub-tasks. Joint3EE  is a such model with the multitask learning framework. However, since the separate training for different classifiers increases the sparsity of the efficient samples to each single classifier, the performance improvement of these methods are limited. The sequence-to-sequence methods  train a neural network model to match a sentence in forms of a token sequence to a tag sequence. This kind of method focuses all sub-tasks to a single classifier and thus further improves the performance with the limited training data.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: for the aforementioned sub-tasks and classify the mentions in sentences as different triggers at first.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
