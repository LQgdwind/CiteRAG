We refer the reader to  for\nan extensive discussion of buildings.\nHere we satisfy with saying that a building is a possibly-infinite simplicial complex\nX𝑋X equipped with a collection ℰℰ{\\mathcal{E}} of subcomplexes called apartments\nsatisfying a list of axioms.\nAll the apartments of X𝑋X\nare isomorphic to each other and to a Coxeter complex ΣΣ\\Sigma.\nThe data of ΣΣ\\Sigma (up to isomorphism) is encoded by a Coxeter diagram\nT𝑇T, which is a finite graph with edges labelled by elements from the set\n{3,4,5,…}∪{∞}345…\\{3,4,5,\\dots\\}\\cup\\{\\infty\\} (unlabelled edges are given the label 333 by default).\nWe write T=T​(X)𝑇𝑇𝑋T=T(X) and say that T𝑇T is the type of X𝑋X.\nThere is a labelling of the vertices\nof X𝑋X by the vertices of T𝑇T making X𝑋X into a pure (r+1)𝑟1(r+1)-partite simplicial complex,\nwhere r=dimX=|V​(T)|−1𝑟dimension𝑋𝑉𝑇1r=\\dim X=|V(T)|-1. The type of a face z∈X𝑧𝑋z\\in X is the set t​(z)⊆V​(T)𝑡𝑧𝑉𝑇t(z)\\subseteq V(T) consisting\nof the types of the vertices of z𝑧z.\nIf dimz≤dimX−1dimension𝑧dimension𝑋1\\dim z\\leq\\dim X-1, then the link Xzsubscript𝑋𝑧X_{z} is also a building and its type T​(Xz)𝑇subscript𝑋𝑧T(X_{z}) is the Coxeter diagram\nobtained from T=T​(X)𝑇𝑇𝑋T=T(X) by removing the vertices in t​(z)𝑡𝑧t(z). Let B𝐵B denote the V​(T)×V​(T)𝑉𝑇𝑉𝑇V(T)\\times V(T) real matrix determined by The building X𝑋X is called spherical if B𝐵B is positive\ndefinite, or\nequivalently, if its apartments are finite.\nFollowing [1, Chapter 10],\nwe call X𝑋X affine if B𝐵B is positive semidefinite\nand rank⁡B=|V​(T)|−1rank𝐵𝑉𝑇1\\operatorname{rank}B=|V(T)|-1 (consult [1, Proposition 10.44]).\nSee [1, p. 50, Remark 10.33(b)] for a complete list of the possible\nspherical and affine Coxeter diagrams.\nIf X𝑋X is an affine building and z𝑧z is a face with 0≤dimz<dimX0dimension𝑧dimension𝑋0\\leq\\dim z<\\dim X, then the link Xzsubscript𝑋𝑧X_{z}\nis a spherical building. A building X𝑋X of dimension r𝑟r is called q𝑞q-thick if every (r−1)𝑟1(r-1)-face of X𝑋X is contained in at least q𝑞q r𝑟r-faces. We say that X𝑋X is thick if it\nis 333-thick. Recall from [1, §6.1.1]\nthat an r𝑟r-dimensional building X𝑋X is said to posses a strongly transitive action\nif there is a group G𝐺G acting on X𝑋X via type-preserving simplicial automorphisms\nsuch that G𝐺G takes apartments to apartments\nand acts transitively on the set of pairs (A,x)𝐴𝑥(A,x) consisting of an apartment\nA∈ℰ𝐴ℰA\\in{\\mathcal{E}} and an r𝑟r-face x𝑥x in A𝐴A. Since G𝐺G is type preserving,\nthis means that G𝐺G acts transitively on the set of faces of a fixed type\nt⊆T​(X)​(0)𝑡𝑇𝑋0t\\subseteq T(X)(0).\nMoreover, for every z∈X𝑧𝑋z\\in X of dimension dimX−2dimension𝑋2\\dim X-2 or less, the building Xzsubscript𝑋𝑧X_{z}\nalso possesses a strongly transitive action.\nIt follows from Tits’ classification of thick spherical and affine buildings,\nsee [1, Chapter 9, §11.9] for a survey,\nthat all thick finite buildings of dimension ≥2absent2\\geq 2 and all locally-finite thick affine buildings\nof dimension ≥3absent3\\geq 3 admit a strongly transitive action. Let 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} be a field and let n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N}.\nThe incidence complex of nontrivial subspaces of 𝔽n+1superscript𝔽𝑛1\\mathbb{F}^{n+1},\ndenoted An​(𝔽)subscript𝐴𝑛𝔽A_{n}(\\mathbb{F}), is an (n−1)𝑛1(n-1)-dimensional building of type Ansubscript𝐴𝑛A_{n},\nwhere Ansubscript𝐴𝑛A_{n} is the Coxeter diagram consisting of a single path\nof length n−1𝑛1n-1 with all edges labeled 333. In more detail,\nthe vertices of An​(𝔽)subscript𝐴𝑛𝔽A_{n}(\\mathbb{F}) are the nontrivial subspaces of 𝔽n+1superscript𝔽𝑛1\\mathbb{F}^{n+1}\nand its faces are the sets of vertices which are totally ordered by inclusion.\nThe apartments of An​(𝔽)subscript𝐴𝑛𝔽A_{n}(\\mathbb{F}) are induced from bases of 𝔽n+1superscript𝔽𝑛1\\mathbb{F}^{n+1}\nas follows: If E𝐸E is a basis of 𝔽n+1superscript𝔽𝑛1\\mathbb{F}^{n+1}, then the collection of\nfaces x={V0,…,Vi}∈An​(𝔽)𝑥subscript𝑉0…subscript𝑉𝑖subscript𝐴𝑛𝔽x=\\{V_{0},\\dots,V_{i}\\}\\in A_{n}(\\mathbb{F}) for which each Vjsubscript𝑉𝑗V_{j} is spanned\nby a subset of E𝐸E is an apartment. The group GLn+1​(𝔽)subscriptGL𝑛1𝔽\\mathrm{GL}_{n+1}({\\mathbb{F}}) acts on An​(𝔽)subscript𝐴𝑛𝔽A_{n}(\\mathbb{F}) via its standard\naction on 𝔽n+1superscript𝔽𝑛1\\mathbb{F}^{n+1}. This action is strongly transitive because\nGLn+1​(𝔽)subscriptGL𝑛1𝔽\\mathrm{GL}_{n+1}({\\mathbb{F}}) acts transitively on the set of bases of 𝔽n+1superscript𝔽𝑛1\\mathbb{F}^{n+1}. When n=2𝑛2n=2, the graph A2​(𝔽)subscript𝐴2𝔽A_{2}(\\mathbb{F}) is nothing but the incidence graph\nof points and lines in the 222-dimensional projective plane over 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F}. Let X𝑋X be a building of type T=T​(X)𝑇𝑇𝑋T=T(X).\nWe define Observe that m​(X)≥m​(Xz)𝑚𝑋𝑚subscript𝑋𝑧m(X)\\geq m(X_{z}) for every face z∈X𝑧𝑋z\\in X of dimension <dimX−1absentdimension𝑋1<\\dim X-1.\nThis definition is motivated by the following theorem, which we derive\nfrom results of Evra–Kaufman \n(see also [ref]7)\nand Oppenheim . Let X𝑋X be a (finite) r𝑟r-dimensional simiplicial complex such that one of the following hold: X𝑋X is a q𝑞q-thick spherical building admitting a strongly transitive action; the universal covering of X𝑋X is a q𝑞q-thick affine building of dimension ≥2absent2\\geq 2\nadmitting a strongly\ntransitive action. In both cases, X𝑋X has the structure of a pure (r+1)𝑟1(r+1)-partite simplicial complex.\nLet w𝑤w denote the canonical weight function of X𝑋X (Example 2.2),\nlet T𝑇T denote the Coxeter diagram of the building mentioned in (1) or (2)\nand put m=m​(T)𝑚𝑚𝑇m=m(T). Then (X,w)𝑋𝑤(X,w) is an (r+1)𝑟1(r+1)-partite [−r​λ,λ]𝑟𝜆𝜆[-r\\lambda,\\lambda]-expander\nfor provided q≥r2​(m−2)𝑞superscript𝑟2𝑚2q\\geq r^{2}(m-2). Furthermore, m≤8𝑚8m\\leq 8 when (1) holds, and m≤6𝑚6m\\leq 6\nwhen (2) holds. Suppose first that r=1𝑟1r=1. Then only case (1) is possible. Thus,\nX𝑋X is a 111-dimensional building admitting a strongly transitive action\nby a group G𝐺G.\nThe Coxeter graph of X𝑋X consists of two vertices\nand one edge labelled m𝑚m,\nso each apartment in X𝑋X is a cycle\ngraph of length 2​m2𝑚2m.\nWe label the vertices of T=T​(X)𝑇𝑇𝑋T=T(X) by 00 and 111\nand write X{i}subscript𝑋𝑖X_{\\{i\\}} (i∈{0,1}𝑖01i\\in\\{0,1\\}) for the 00-faces of type\n{i}𝑖\\{i\\} in X𝑋X. Since G𝐺G acts transitively on X{0}subscript𝑋0X_{\\{0\\}} and X{1}subscript𝑋1X_{\\{1\\}},\nX𝑋X is a biregular graph.\nWrite ni=|X{i}|subscript𝑛𝑖subscript𝑋𝑖n_{i}=|X_{\\{i\\}}| and let kisubscript𝑘𝑖k_{i} denote the number of edges\ncontaining a 00-face in X{i}subscript𝑋𝑖X_{\\{i\\}}. Then |X​(1)|=n0​k0=n1​k1𝑋1subscript𝑛0subscript𝑘0subscript𝑛1subscript𝑘1|X(1)|=n_{0}k_{0}=n_{1}k_{1},\nwhich means that w​(e)=1n0​k0=1n1​k1𝑤𝑒1subscript𝑛0subscript𝑘01subscript𝑛1subscript𝑘1w(e)=\\frac{1}{n_{0}k_{0}}=\\frac{1}{n_{1}k_{1}}\nfor all e∈X​(1)𝑒𝑋1e\\in X(1) and\nw​(x)=12​ni𝑤𝑥12subscript𝑛𝑖w(x)=\\frac{1}{2n_{i}} for all x∈X{i}𝑥subscript𝑋𝑖x\\in X_{\\{i\\}}.\nWe may assume without loss of generality that k0≤k1subscript𝑘0subscript𝑘1k_{0}\\leq k_{1}.\nNote also that\nq≤k0𝑞subscript𝑘0q\\leq k_{0}.\nWe now adapt\nthe proofs of [8, Propositions 5.21, 5.22]\nto our weighted graph situation,\nand also improve the expansion constants, in order to show that\n(X,w)𝑋𝑤(X,w) is a bipartite [−m−2q,m−2q]𝑚2𝑞𝑚2𝑞[-\\sqrt{\\frac{m-2}{{q}}},\\sqrt{\\frac{m-2}{{q}}}]-expander. Let f′∈C⋄0​(X,ℝ)superscript𝑓′subscriptsuperscript𝐶0⋄𝑋ℝf^{\\prime}\\in C^{0}_{\\diamond}(X,\\mathbb{R}) (notation as in §2D)\ndenote a nonzero eigenfunction of 𝒜:=𝒜X,wassign𝒜subscript𝒜𝑋𝑤{\\mathcal{A}}:={\\mathcal{A}}_{X,w}\nwith eigenvalue λ𝜆\\lambda. We need to prove that λ2≤m−2qsuperscript𝜆2𝑚2𝑞\\lambda^{2}\\leq\\frac{m-2}{q}.\nIt is enough to consider the case λ≠0𝜆0\\lambda\\neq 0.\nIn this case, f′superscript𝑓′f^{\\prime} cannot vanish on X{0}subscript𝑋0X_{\\{0\\}}. Thus, we may choose\ns∈X{0}𝑠subscript𝑋0s\\in X_{\\{0\\}} with f′​(s)≠0superscript𝑓′𝑠0f^{\\prime}(s)\\neq 0 and put K={g∈G:g​s=s}𝐾conditional-set𝑔𝐺𝑔𝑠𝑠K=\\{g\\in G\\,:\\,gs=s\\}.\nBy applying Lemma 2.8 to f′superscript𝑓′f^{\\prime}, we\nsee that\nthere exists f′′∈C⋄0​(X,ℝ)superscript𝑓′′subscriptsuperscript𝐶0⋄𝑋ℝf^{\\prime\\prime}\\in C^{0}_{\\diamond}(X,\\mathbb{R}) with 𝒜​f′′=−λ​f′′𝒜superscript𝑓′′𝜆superscript𝑓′′{\\mathcal{A}}f^{\\prime\\prime}=-\\lambda f^{\\prime\\prime}\nand f′′​(s)≠0superscript𝑓′′𝑠0f^{\\prime\\prime}(s)\\neq 0. Given 00-faces x,y∈X​(0)𝑥𝑦𝑋0x,y\\in X(0),\nwe\ndenote the K𝐾K-orbit of x∈X​(0)𝑥𝑋0x\\in X(0) by [x]delimited-[]𝑥[x],\nand write d​(x,y)𝑑𝑥𝑦d(x,y) for\nthe length\nof the shortest path from one x𝑥x to y𝑦y in X𝑋X.\nWe claim that following hold (cf. [8, Definition 5.20]): The number of K𝐾K-orbits in X​(0)𝑋0X(0) is exactly m+1𝑚1m+1. For all i∈{0,1}𝑖01i\\in\\{0,1\\}, the 00-faces in X{i}subscript𝑋𝑖X_{\\{i\\}} of maximal distance\nfrom s𝑠s form a G𝐺G-orbit. This maximal distance is m−((m+i)mod2)𝑚modulo𝑚𝑖2m-((m+i)\\bmod 2). If x∈X​(0)−{s}𝑥𝑋0𝑠x\\in X(0)-\\{s\\} is not of maximal distance from s𝑠s,\nthen there is exactly one 00-face y𝑦y adjacent to x𝑥x with d​(s,y)<d​(s,x)𝑑𝑠𝑦𝑑𝑠𝑥d(s,y)<d(s,x). This is similar to the proof of\n[8, Propositions 5.22]:\nTo see (i), fix an apartment E𝐸E containing s𝑠s\nand apply [8, Lemma 5.16]\nto conclude that every K𝐾K-orbit in X​(0)𝑋0X(0) meets E𝐸E. Let x,y∈E​(0)𝑥𝑦𝐸0x,y\\in E(0) be the 00-faces adajcent to s𝑠s.\nBy the strong transitivity of the G𝐺G-action, there is g∈G𝑔𝐺g\\in G such that g​(E)=E𝑔𝐸𝐸g(E)=E\nand g​{s,x}=g​{s,y}𝑔𝑠𝑥𝑔𝑠𝑦g\\{s,x\\}=g\\{s,y\\}. Since G𝐺G preserves types, g​(s)=s𝑔𝑠𝑠g(s)=s, so g𝑔g is a reflection\nof the 2​m2𝑚2m-cycle E𝐸E fixing s𝑠s. This means that all except possibly 222 K𝐾K-orbits\nmeet E𝐸E in at least two vertices, so there can be at most m+1𝑚1m+1 K𝐾K-orbits.\nOn the other hand, since the action of G𝐺G preserves distances and there are 00-faces\nof distance m𝑚m in X𝑋X, the number of K𝐾K-orbits on X​(0)𝑋0X(0) must be at least m+1𝑚1m+1. This proves (i).\nThe first assertion of (ii) is shown exactly as in op. cit.,\nand the second assertion follows from the fact that s∈X{0}𝑠subscript𝑋0s\\in X_{\\{0\\}} and each apartment\nis a cycle of length 2​m2𝑚2m.\nAs for (iii), let D𝐷D be the set of 00-faces y∈X​(0)𝑦𝑋0y\\in X(0)\nadjacent to x𝑥x with d​(s,y)<d​(s,x)𝑑𝑠𝑦𝑑𝑠𝑥d(s,y)<d(s,x). It is shown in\nthe proof [8, Propositions 5.22] that\nthere is an apartment E𝐸E of X𝑋X with s,x∈E𝑠𝑥𝐸s,x\\in E and D⊆E𝐷𝐸D\\subseteq E.\nSince E𝐸E is a cycle graph, D𝐷D must be a singleton. Next, let us regard 𝒜=𝒜X,w𝒜subscript𝒜𝑋𝑤{\\mathcal{A}}={\\mathcal{A}}_{X,w} as an operator from the complex vector space C0​(X,ℂ)superscript𝐶0𝑋ℂC^{0}(X,\\mathbb{C}) to\nitself; this does not affect the spectrum of 𝒜𝒜{\\mathcal{A}}. Put Y=K∖X𝑌𝐾𝑋Y=K{\\setminus}X\nand let C0​(Y,ℂ)superscript𝐶0𝑌ℂC^{0}(Y,\\mathbb{C}) denote the set of functions from Y𝑌Y to ℂℂ\\mathbb{C} (note that Y𝑌Y is not a graph\nin general). We define a linear operator ℬ:C0​(Y,ℂ)→C0​(Y,ℂ):ℬ→superscript𝐶0𝑌ℂsuperscript𝐶0𝑌ℂ{\\mathcal{B}}:C^{0}(Y,\\mathbb{C})\\to C^{0}(Y,\\mathbb{C}) by Note that this does not depend on the representative x𝑥x in the orbit [x]delimited-[]𝑥[x]. We claim that Spec⁡ℬ⊆Spec⁡𝒜SpecℬSpec𝒜\\operatorname{Spec}{\\mathcal{B}}\\subseteq\\operatorname{Spec}{\\mathcal{A}}; in particular, Spec⁡ℬ⊆ℝSpecℬℝ\\operatorname{Spec}{\\mathcal{B}}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}.\nIndeed, given μ∈ℂ𝜇ℂ\\mu\\in\\mathbb{C} and g∈C0​(Y,ℂ)𝑔superscript𝐶0𝑌ℂg\\in C^{0}(Y,\\mathbb{C}) with ℬ​g=μ​gℬ𝑔𝜇𝑔{\\mathcal{B}}g=\\mu g,\nthe function f∈C0​(X,ℂ)𝑓superscript𝐶0𝑋ℂf\\in C^{0}(X,\\mathbb{C}) defined by f​(x)=g​[x]𝑓𝑥𝑔delimited-[]𝑥f(x)=g[x] satsifies\nA​f=μ​f𝐴𝑓𝜇𝑓Af=\\mu f because, for all x∈X​(0)𝑥𝑋0x\\in X(0), We further claim that the 𝒜𝒜{\\mathcal{A}}-eigenvalue λ𝜆\\lambda corresponding\nto f′∈C⋄0​(X,ℝ)superscript𝑓′superscriptsubscript𝐶⋄0𝑋ℝf^{\\prime}\\in C_{\\diamond}^{0}(X,\\mathbb{R}) is in Spec⁡ℬSpecℬ\\operatorname{Spec}{\\mathcal{B}}. Indeed,\ndefine g′∈C0​(Y,ℂ)superscript𝑔′superscript𝐶0𝑌ℂg^{\\prime}\\in C^{0}(Y,\\mathbb{C}) by g′​[y]=∑k∈Kf′​(k​y)superscript𝑔′delimited-[]𝑦subscript𝑘𝐾superscript𝑓′𝑘𝑦g^{\\prime}[y]=\\sum_{k\\in K}f^{\\prime}(ky)\nand note that g′​[s]=|K|​f′​(s)≠0superscript𝑔′delimited-[]𝑠𝐾superscript𝑓′𝑠0g^{\\prime}[s]=|K|f^{\\prime}(s)\\neq 0.
