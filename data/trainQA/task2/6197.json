Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: L-CAD: Language-based Colorization with Any-level Descriptions using Diffusion Priors\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs presented in Sec. 4.1 of the main paper, we comprehensively evaluate our method on language-based colorization datsets, where we make comparisons with language-based colorization methods (e.g., LBIE , ML2018 [ref]27, Xie2018 [ref]49, L-CoDe , L-CoDer , and L-CoIns ) using complete-level and partial level descriptions, and comparisons with automatic colorization methods (e.g., CIC 2, InstColor , ChromaGAN , BigColor , DISCO , and CT2 ) using scarce-level descriptions. Following the evaluation protocol on ImageNet dataset , we evaluate colorization results at the more common resolution of 256×256256256256\\times 256, instead of 224×224224224224\\times 224 resolution in previous works [5; 6; 45]. This higher resolution increases the difficulty of the colorization, resulting in slightly lower scores for the quantitative metrics (see Tab. 1 of the main paper), compared to those reported in previous works [5; 6; 45]. Additionally, we provide more qualitative comparison results with language-based colorization methods and automatic colorization methods in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: in Sec. 4.1 of the main paper, we comprehensively evaluate our method on language-based colorization datsets, where we make comparisons with language-based colorization methods (e.g., LBIE , ML2018 [ref]27, Xie2018 [ref]49, L-CoDe , L-CoDer , and L-CoIns ) using complete-level and partial level descriptions, and comparisons with automatic colorization methods (e.g., CIC 2, InstColor , ChromaGAN\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
