      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe recall that a signed permutation444 Following Knuth , we also use perm to denote a signed permutation. is a signed binary matrix, i.e., with elements 0,1, and −101 and 10,1,\\text{ and }-1, where each row and column has only one element distinct from 00.\nClearly, such a permutation has determinant ±1plus-or-minus1\\pm 1 and therefore forms a member of the special orthogonal group. If Ω=ω​(i,j)Ω𝜔𝑖𝑗\\Omega=\\omega(i,j) is the matrix of order n𝑛n of a signed permutation, then there is a permutation σ𝜎\\sigma of ΣnsubscriptΣ𝑛\\Sigma_{n}, such that σ​(a)=−σ​(−a)𝜎𝑎𝜎𝑎\\sigma(a)=-\\sigma(-a) for a∈Σn𝑎subscriptΣ𝑛a\\in\\Sigma_{n}. Determine σ​(k);k=1,2,…,nformulae-sequence𝜎𝑘𝑘12…𝑛\\sigma(k);k=1,2,\\ldots,n, by the unique 1≤i≤n1𝑖𝑛1\\leq i\\leq n such that ω​(i,k)≠0𝜔𝑖𝑘0\\omega(i,k)\\not=0 and ω​(j,k)=0𝜔𝑗𝑘0\\omega(j,k)=0 for j≠i𝑗𝑖j\\not=i, and define σ​(k)=i∗ω​(i,k)𝜎𝑘∗𝑖𝜔𝑖𝑘\\sigma(k)=i\\ast\\omega(i,k) for 1≤k≤n1𝑘𝑛1\\leq k\\leq n.\nThus, we have sgn⁡(σ​(k))=ω​(|σ​(k)|,k)sgn𝜎𝑘𝜔𝜎𝑘𝑘\\operatorname{sgn}\\big{(}\\sigma(k)\\big{)}=\\omega(|\\sigma(k)|,k), where ω​(m,k)=0𝜔𝑚𝑘0\\omega(m,k)=0 for m≠|σ​(k)|𝑚𝜎𝑘m\\not=|\\sigma(k)| and 1≤k≤n1𝑘𝑛1\\leq k\\leq n.\nFurther, we define σ​(−k)=−σ​(k)𝜎𝑘𝜎𝑘\\sigma(-k)=-\\sigma(k) for 1≤k≤n1𝑘𝑛1\\leq k\\leq n and the condition is fulfilled.\nThen we get σ​(k)=sgn⁡(k)∗ω​(|σ​(k)|,|k|)𝜎𝑘∗sgn𝑘𝜔𝜎𝑘𝑘\\sigma(k)=\\operatorname{sgn}(k)\\ast\\omega(|\\sigma(k)|,|k|) for k∈Σn𝑘subscriptΣ𝑛k\\in\\Sigma_{n}.\nAs an illustration for the above, see eq. 1.\n∎ In Cauchy’s two-line notation555 [22, p. 94], “Cauchy used his permutation notation – in which the arrangements are written one below the other, and both are enclosed in parentheses – for the first time in 1815.”, a permutation looks like\n[xyz⋯abc⋯]matrix𝑥𝑦𝑧⋯𝑎𝑏𝑐⋯\\begin{bmatrix}x&y&z&\\cdots\\\\\na&b&c&\\cdots\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}, where the first row contains elements from the domain, and the second row contains their respective images.\nA signed permutation is also a bijective morphism σ𝜎\\sigma on the alphabet ΣnsubscriptΣ𝑛\\Sigma_{n} with the property σ​(−x)=−σ​(x)𝜎𝑥𝜎𝑥\\sigma(-x)=-\\sigma(x) for x∈Σn𝑥subscriptΣ𝑛x\\in\\Sigma_{n}.\nThus, we use the one-line notation [σ​(1),σ​(2),σ​(3),…,σ​(n)]𝜎1𝜎2𝜎3…𝜎𝑛\\left[\\sigma(1),\\sigma(2),\\sigma(3),\\ldots,\\sigma(n)\\right], by which σ𝜎\\sigma is completely determined.666 Björner et al. [3, p. 246] called this a window notation. Section (8.1) [ref]3 is devoted to the properties of signed permutations and their group. Examples are the identity\nι=[1,2,3,…,n]𝜄123…𝑛\\iota=[1,2,3,\\ldots,n] and its negation −ι=[−1,−2,…,−n]𝜄12…𝑛-\\iota=[-1,-2,\\ldots,-n].\nAs [−2,4,−1,3]2413[-2,4,-1,3] indicates the images of the four unit-vectors, the matrix becomes, Signed permutations\nσ=[σ​(1),σ​(2),…,σ​(n)]𝜎𝜎1𝜎2…𝜎𝑛\\sigma=[\\sigma(1),\\sigma(2),\\ldots,\\sigma(n)] and τ=[τ​(1),τ​(2),…,τ​(n)]𝜏𝜏1𝜏2…𝜏𝑛\\tau=[\\tau(1),\\tau(2),\\ldots,\\tau(n)], have as a product This product follows immediately from σ​(x)=sgn⁡(x)∗σ​(|x|)𝜎𝑥∗sgn𝑥𝜎𝑥\\sigma(x)=\\operatorname{sgn}(x)\\ast\\sigma(|x|) for x∈Σn𝑥subscriptΣ𝑛x\\in\\Sigma_{n}.\n∎ For instance, [−2,4,−1,3]​[3,−1,4,−2]=[−1,−(−2),3,−(4)]=[−1,2,3,−4]2413314212341234[-2,4,-1,3][3,-1,4,-2]=[-1,-(-2),3,-(4)]=[-1,2,3,-4].\nIf we multiply from the right with e.g.,  [ref]3   [ref]3  [ref]4, we swap two values in positions 222 and 333, as in\n[−2,4,−1,3]​ [ref]3  [ref]4=[−2,−1,4,3]241313242143[-2,4,-1,3] [ref]3  [ref]4=[-2,-1,4,3].\nMultiplying from the left swaps the corresponding values, as we see in  [ref]3  [ref]4​[−2,4,−1,3]=[−3,4,−1,2]132424133412 [ref]3  [ref]4[-2,4,-1,3]=[-3,4,-1,2]. From the matrix representation of signed permutations, we know the determinant equals ±1plus-or-minus1\\pm 1. The perms with matrices with positive determinants preserve the orientation of the vector space, and we call them rotations; those with negative determinants alter the orientation in the opposite one, and we call them reflections.\nWe now investigate whether a signed permutation is a reflection by observing its one-line notation. Let σ=[σ​(1),σ​(2),…,σ​(n)]𝜎𝜎1𝜎2…𝜎𝑛\\sigma=[\\sigma(1),\\sigma(2),\\ldots,\\sigma(n)] be a signed permutation. Then, we define the number of negative items  by\n𝐧𝐞𝐠⁡𝟏𝐧𝐞𝐠1\\operatorname{neg}1(σ)=|{1≤i≤n:σ​(i)<0}|𝜎conditional-set1𝑖𝑛𝜎𝑖0(\\sigma)=\\big{|}\\{1\\leq i\\leq n:\\sigma(i)<0\\}\\big{|}, and the number of inversions by 𝐢𝐧𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐯\\operatorname{inv}(σ)=|{(i,j):1≤i<j≤n,|σ​(i)|>|σ​(j)|}|𝜎conditional-set𝑖𝑗formulae-sequence1𝑖𝑗𝑛𝜎𝑖𝜎𝑗(\\sigma)=\\big{|}\\{(i,j):1\\leq i<j\\leq n,\\;|\\sigma(i)|>|\\sigma(j)|\\}\\big{|}. det(σ)=−1neg⁡1​(σ)+inv⁡(σ)𝜎superscript1neg1𝜎inv𝜎\\det(\\sigma)=-1^{\\operatorname{neg}1(\\sigma)+\\operatorname{inv}(\\sigma)}. We know that the number of inversions, inv⁡(σ)inv𝜎\\operatorname{inv}(\\sigma), equals the number modulo 222 of transpositions of two values in the one-line notation.\nSuch a transposition, say σ​(i)𝜎𝑖\\sigma(i) and σ​(j)𝜎𝑗\\sigma(j), corresponds to swapping the two columns i​ and ​j𝑖 and 𝑗i\\text{ and }j in the corresponding matrix, which leads to an additional factor of −11-1 in the determinant.\nMultiplying a value in the one-line notation by −11-1 equals multiplying the corresponding column in the matrix with −11-1.\nTherefore, if we add the inversions and the minus signs in the one-line notation, we get the exponent of −11-1 in the determinant.\nWe refer to the signed permutation μ=[2,3,4,…,n,−1]𝜇234…𝑛1\\mu=[2,3,4,\\ldots,n,-1] as the minimal rotation because neg⁡1​(μ)=1=inv⁡(μ)neg1𝜇1inv𝜇\\operatorname{neg}1(\\mu)=1=\\operatorname{inv}(\\mu).\n∎ A sequence S=⟨s1,s2,…⟩𝑆subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2…S=\\langle{s_{1},s_{2},\\ldots}\\rangle is generally not normalized (c.f. definition 4), but we can easily construct a signed permutation to transform such an array into an isomorphic, normalized sequence.\nFor this, we need the first occurrence |si|=ksubscript𝑠𝑖𝑘|s_{i}|=k in the series for each 0<k∈Σn0𝑘subscriptΣ𝑛0<k\\in\\Sigma_{n}, along with the sgn⁡(si)sgnsubscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{sgn}(s_{i}) of that first occurrence. In that order, these first occurrences for 0<k∈Σn0𝑘subscriptΣ𝑛0<k\\in\\Sigma_{n} constitute the inverse of the normalizing permutation of the original sequence. Given a sequence S=⟨s1,s2,…⟩𝑆subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2…S=\\langle{s_{1},s_{2},\\ldots}\\rangle over ΣnsubscriptΣ𝑛\\Sigma_{n}, define iksubscript𝑖𝑘i_{k} for 1≤k≤n1𝑘𝑛1\\leq k\\leq n such that |sik|=ksubscript𝑠subscript𝑖𝑘𝑘|s_{i_{k}}|=k, and |sj|≠ksubscript𝑠𝑗𝑘|s_{j}|\\not=k for 1≤j<ik1𝑗subscript𝑖𝑘1\\leq j<i_{k}, then we get\n{|si1|,|si2|,…,|sin|}subscript𝑠subscript𝑖1subscript𝑠subscript𝑖2…subscript𝑠subscript𝑖𝑛\\big{\\{}|s_{i_{1}}|,|s_{i_{2}}|,\\ldots,|s_{i_{n}}|\\big{\\}}. This determines the normalizing permutation of S𝑆S to be σ=[si1si2⋯sin12⋯n]𝜎matrixsubscript𝑠subscript𝑖1subscript𝑠subscript𝑖2⋯subscript𝑠subscript𝑖𝑛12⋯𝑛\\sigma=\\begin{bmatrix}s_{i_{1}}&s_{i_{2}}&\\cdots&s_{i_{n}}\\\\\n1&2&\\cdots&n\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}, or σ−1=[si1,si2,…,sin]superscript𝜎1subscript𝑠subscript𝑖1subscript𝑠subscript𝑖2…subscript𝑠subscript𝑖𝑛\\sigma^{-1}=[s_{i_{1}},s_{i_{2}},\\ldots,s_{i_{n}}]. A constant morphism γ:Σn→Σn:𝛾→subscriptΣ𝑛subscriptΣ𝑛\\gamma:\\Sigma_{n}\\to\\Sigma_{n} is such that for x∈Σn𝑥subscriptΣ𝑛x\\in\\Sigma_{n}, we have γ​(x)=c𝛾𝑥𝑐\\gamma(x)=c.\nA constant substitution γ∗:Σn∗→Σn1:superscript𝛾→superscriptsubscriptΣ𝑛subscriptsuperscriptΣ1𝑛\\gamma^{*}:\\Sigma_{n}^{*}\\to\\Sigma^{1}_{n} is a mapping such that for S∈Σn∗𝑆superscriptsubscriptΣ𝑛S\\in\\Sigma_{n}^{*}, we have γ​(S)=⟨c⟩𝛾𝑆delimited-⟨⟩𝑐\\gamma(S)=\\langle{c}\\rangle.\nWe use ΣΣ\\Sigma instead of ΣnsubscriptΣ𝑛\\Sigma_{n} if n𝑛n is evident from the context.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: by which σ𝜎\\sigma is completely determined.666 Björner et al.
