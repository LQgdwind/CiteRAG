      "content": "Paper Title: FedDIP: Federated Learning with Extreme Dynamic Pruning and Incremental Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFederated Learning (FL)  is a prevalent distributed learning paradigm due to its ability to tackle learning at scale. FL plays a significant role in large-scale predictive analytics by enabling the decentralization of knowledge discovery. FL contributes towards privacy preservation, which overcomes fundamental issues of data governance and ownership .\nDistributed training and deploying large-scale Machine Learning (ML) models, i.e., Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), impose significant challenges due to the huge volumes of training data, large models, and diversity in data distributions. Distributed computing nodes, mainly located at the network edge being as close to data sources as possible, collaboratively engineer ML models rather than depending on collecting all the data to a centralized location (data center or Cloud) for training [ref]3. This computing paradigm coined Edge Computing, has been successfully applied to various predictive modeling, mining, and analytics applications, e.g., in finance [ref]4, healthcare [ref]5 and wireless sensor networks . DNNs are characterized by an extremely large number of parameters.\nFor instance, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) ResNet50  and VGG16  consist of 27 and 140 million parameters, respectively, while generative AI models, like GPT-2 have more than 1.5 billion parameters . Evidently, this places a great burden on distributed computing nodes when exchanging model parameters during training, tuning, and inference. Model size reduction (pruning) methods, e.g., 0, 1, 2 aim to retain the prediction accuracy while reducing the communication overhead by decreasing the number of model parameters exchanged among nodes. However, most pruning methods focus on the compression of model gradients. Even though they yield high compression rates, they do not achieve significantly compact models for exchange.\nBut in general, methods that can produce compact models along with significant redundancy in the number of DNN weights by sophisticatedly pruning the weights are deemed appropriate 3.\nIn contrast to model gradient compression, model weight compression significantly shrinks the model size by setting most of the weights to zero. This is desirable for eliminating redundancy in model exchange during distributed knowledge extraction. But often such models result in performance degradation.\nTherefore, the question we are addressing is: How to effectively introduce model pruning mechanisms in a decentralized learning setting that is capable of achieving extremely high compression rates while preserving optimal predictive performance? We contribute with an efficient method based on dynamic pruning with error feedback and incremental regularization, coined FedDIP. FedDIPâ€™s novelty lies in the principle of adapting dynamic pruning in a decentralized way by pushing unimportant weights to zeros (extreme pruning) whilst maintaining high accuracy through incremental regularization. To the best of our knowledge, FedDIP is the first approach that combines incremental regularization and extreme dynamic pruning in FL. The paper is organized as follows: Section II reports on related work and our contribution. Section III provides preliminaries in FL and model pruning methods. Section IV elaborates on the FedDIP framework, while Section V reports on the theoretical properties of FedDIP and convergence analysis. Our experimental results in Section VI showcase the efficiency of FedDIP in distributed learning. Section VII concludes the paper with future research directions.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: edge being as close to data sources as possible, collaboratively engineer ML models rather than depending on collecting all the data to a centralized location (data center or Cloud) for training [ref]3.
