      "content": "Paper Title: Sources of Opacity in Computer Systems: Towards a Comprehensive Taxonomy\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe complexity of computer systems is a source of opacity that is frequently emphasized, but rarely specified. In theoretical computer science, computational complexity refers to the computational resources required to solve a problem. We will return to this aspect when discussing limited resources (see Section III-B3). Computer systems, and especially AI systems, are also complex in the colloquial sense of the word. In this more general sense, the complexity of any system can be characterized by two dimensions: i) the number of the system’s elements222What is considered a distinct element of a complex system is a contextual question. For instance, understanding neural networks on the level of neurons might be useful for some computer scientists while unsuitable for end users., and ii) their interactions . On the one hand, a system can be complex because of scale. For example, a program consisting of hundreds of lines of code cannot be contemplated all at once . Similarly, a decision tree (or one of its decisions) can be complex due to a large number of nodes [ref]3 . This issue is especially severe for the millions of parameters of some neural networks. A variant of this opacity emerges when the relevant information itself is not complex, but is obscured by a vast quantity of surrounding information . If this is done on purpose , it is better described as intentional concealment (see Section III-C3). On the other hand, the interaction of the system’s elements can lead to complexity. Non-linearity is one of the most common properties of complex systems  and is also present in some AI models (e.g., in the activation functions of neural networks). Another type of interaction that gives rise to complexity is feedback loops  which are also present in the context of AI (e.g., in recurrent neural networks).333Analysis of further properties of complex systems (e.g., emergence, self-organization) is beyond the scope of the paper. For discussion, see    . A complex interaction of system elements can also occur in traditional software. For instance, so-called kludges can lead to the (partial) opacity of computer code  . Kludges are unconventional makeshift solutions or workarounds to a programming problem. While effective in the short run, kludges can lead to problems down the line as they are often poorly understood and behave in unexpected ways [ref]27. As kludges often arise during collaborative and iterative software development  they can lead to epistemic dependence (see Section III-C1) and are susceptible to lost knowledge (see Section III-C2). More generally, opacity due to complexity can also be seen as stemming from individual or human cognitive limits, rendering it an analytical issue (see Section III-B). Strategies: The complexity of a model or software can be reduced with methods like feature extraction or by following best practice standards of programming . Explainability approaches that make use of deliberate simplification can also render a complex system tractable . Any explanation that selects contextually relevant pieces of information can be seen as providing such a simplification (e.g., a saliency map highlighting image regions decisive for a classification , or a counterfactual statement describing a way of altering the input to receive a different output [ref]30).\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: For example, a program consisting of hundreds of lines of code cannot be contemplated all at once . Similarly, a decision tree (or one of its decisions) can be complex due to a large number of nodes [ref]3 . This issue is especially severe for the millions of parameters of some neural networks. A variant of this opacity emerges when the relevant information itself is not complex, but is obscured\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
