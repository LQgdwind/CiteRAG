      "content": "Paper Title: A Symbolic Temporal Pooling method for Video-based Person Re-Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we report an extensive comparison between the effectiveness of our solution with respect to the state-of-the-art solutions. Considering that re-id is currently a crowded topic, nine techniques were selected as baselines:\n Chung et al.  : This method111https://github.com/icarofua/siamese-two-stream uses a Siamese network as backbone, temporal pooling as aggregation and a softmax as the loss function. Interestingly, it is the unique method considered state-of-the-art that learns the spatial and temporal features separately. In our experiments, the best results of this model were obtained when using stochastic gradient descent method with the following parameterization: epochs=1000, learning rate=0.0001 and momentum=0.9. The Siamese cost function margin was set to 2 and the Euclidean distance was used as similarity metric. Gao and Nevatia: This method222 https://github.com/jiyanggao/Video-Person-ReID uses 3D ResNet which uses 3D convolution kernels as backbone architecture and triplet as a loss function. It uses RNN and 3D CNN models to obtain the video level representations. The model was trained using Adam optimizer with parameters: epoch=800, learning rate=0.0003, weight decay 5​e−45superscripte4{5\\rm e}^{-4}, Triplet loss margin=0.3. During testing, Euclidean distance is used as a metric to compute the similarity between query and gallery. Rao et al.: This method333 https://github.com/rshivansh/Spatial-Temporal-attention uses a siamese network, hinge loss and softmax loss functions. Also, it proposes a spatial-temporal attention mechanism, based on the attention scores. The model was trained using stochastic gradient descent with learning rate equal to 0.0001. The margin for hinge loss was set to 2 and 16 frames were considered to represent a sequences in the training phase. During testing, the Euclidean distance was used as a metric to obtain the similarity any pair of elements. Spatio Temporal Attention Model (STAM) : This method444 https://github.com/ShuangLI59/Diversity-Regularized-Spatiotemporal-Attention uses the ResNet-50 architecture as backbone, temporal attention as aggregation and an Online Instance Matching Loss function. Essentially, it discriminates between the different parts of the body using spatial-temporal attention. Initially, features are extracted from the local region are organized using the spatial criterion and further combined using temporal attention. This model was trained using stochastic gradient descent method with epoch=800, learning rate=0,1 and it is then dropped to 0.01. During training Restricted Random Sampling is used to select training samples. During testing, the first image from each of N segments as a testing sample and its L2-normalized features are utilized to compute the similarity between query and gallery. Temporal Knowledge Propagation (TKP) : This model555 https://github.com/guxinqian/TKP  uses ResNet-50 as backbone model. The input frames were resized to 256×128256128256\\times 128. The model was trained using Adam optimizer with following parameters: learning rate=0.0003, 150 epochs, learning rate decay=0.1, weight decay=5​e−45superscripte4{5\\rm e}^{-4}. TKP uses four-loss functions: classification loss, Triplet loss, Feature-based TKP loss, and Distance-based TKP loss. During testing, the Euclidean distance was used as similarity measure. Spatial Temporal Mutual Promotion Model (STMPM) : This method666 https://github.com/yolomax/rru-reid  uses the Inception-v3 architecture as backbone model and cross-entropy as a loss function. It handles occlusions by recovering the missing parts and uses a 3D-CNN and global average pooling for temporal aggregation. This model was trained using stochastic gradient descent while number of epochs, learning rate, and momentum set to 800, 0.01, 0.9 respectively. Model parameters N, K and T and m were set to 10, 2, 8 and 0.4, respectively. During test, the cosine distance is used as a metric. CoSAM [ref]30:\nThis model777 https://github.com/InnovArul/vidreid_cosegmentation uses the SE-ResNet50 architecture as backbone and extracts salient spatial features by a co-segmentation based attention model. The input frames were resized to 256×128256128256\\times 128, and the model was trained using the Adam optimizer, learning rate 0.0001 and weight decay 5​e−45superscripte4{5\\rm e}^{-4}. During test, the Euclidean distance is used as similarity metric. GLTR : This model888 https://github.com/kanei1024/GLTR uses ResNet50 as backbone architecture. The input frames were resized to 256×128256128256\\times 128, and the model was trained using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm 400 epochs, learning rate 0.01, momentum 0.9 and weight decay 5​e−45superscripte4{5\\rm e}^{-4}. For DTP and TSA training, 16 adjacent frames compose each sequence and used as input. During test, the Euclidean distance is used as similarity metric. Non-local Video Attention Network (NVAN) [ref]19: This method999 https://github.com/jackie840129/STE-NVAN  uses ResNet50 as a backbone network and plugs two non-local attention layer after Conv3_3, and Conv3_4 convolutional layers and three non-local layers at Conv4_4, Conv4_5, and Conv4_6. It incorporates both spatial and temporal features using the non-local attention operation at multiple feature levels and uses triplet and cross entropy loss functions. The input frames are resized into 256×128256128256\\times 128. The model was trained with the Adam algorithm, with 300 epochs, learning rate=0.0001. During test, the Euclidean distance is used as similarity metric. For the PRID2011 and iLIDS-VID sets we strictly followed the evaluation protocols described in  [ref]14. For the other sets (MARS and P-DESTRE), we used the evaluation protocols described in 2 and , respectively.\nAs performance measures, two widely used evaluation metrics were chosen: the Cumulative Matching Characteristics (CMC) and the Mean Average Precision (mAP) values. Due to the single gallery instance per probe feature of the iLIDS-VID and PRID2011 sets, only the CMC values were used in these cases.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: rate, and momentum set to 800, 0.01, 0.9 respectively. Model parameters N, K and T and m were set to 10, 2, 8 and 0.4, respectively. During test, the cosine distance is used as a metric.
