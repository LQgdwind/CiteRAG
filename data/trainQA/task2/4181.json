      "content": "Paper Title: Understanding Decision-Time vs. Background Planning in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe abstract view that we provide in this study is mostly related to the recent monograph of Bertsekas  in which the recent successes of AlphaZero , a DT planning algorithm, are viewed through the lens of DP. However, we take a broader perspective and provide a unified view that encompasses both DT and B planning algorithms. Also, instead of assuming the availability of an exact model, we consider the scenario in which a model has to be learned by pure interaction with the environment. Another closely related study is the study of Hamrick et al. [ref]14 which informally relates MuZero , another DT planning algorithm, to various other DT and B planning algorithms in the literature. Our study can be viewed as a study that formalizes the relation between the two planning styles. There have also been studies that empirically compare the performances of various DT and B planning algorithms on continuous control domains in the P&L setting , and on MG environments in specific TL settings 2. However, none of these studies provide a general understanding of when will one planning style perform better than the other. Finally, our work also has connections to the studies of Jiang et al.  and Arumugam et al.  which provide upper bounds for the performance difference between policies generated as a result of planning with an exact model and an estimated model. However, rather than providing upper bounds, in this study, we are instead interested in understanding which classes of models will allow for one planning style to perform better than the other. Lastly, another related line of research is the recent studies of Grimm et al. [ref]11  which classify models according to how relevant they are for value-based planning. Although, we share the same overall idea that models should only be judged for how useful they are in the planning process, our work differs in that we classify the models according to how useful they are in the comparison of the two planning styles.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: the availability of an exact model, we consider the scenario in which a model has to be learned by pure interaction with the environment.
