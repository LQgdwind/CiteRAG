      "content": "Paper Title: NTD: Non-Transferability Enabled Backdoor Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBased on when a backdoor behavior is detected, existing countermeasures can be divided into two categories, i.e., offline    and online [ref]14   approaches. We can also categorize the backdoor countermeasures into data-level [ref]24  [ref]25  and model-level   [ref]14   approaches. We describe state-of-the-art defenses and distinguish NTD from them. A qualitative comparison is summarized in Table 1. Neural Cleanse  (S&P’19). \nIt is an offline model-based defense, which observes that there exists an extremely small perturbation that is applicable for all inputs to be misclasified into a victim label. And this perturbation resembles a real trigger. It iterates each label to identify a potential trigger. Among all ponytail triggers, the smallest one generally is chosen based on an outlier detection algorithm and its corresponding label is the attacker-targeted label. As it needs to go through each label, its computational overhead is dependent on the task, e.g., face recognition costs an extremely long time (up to several days). In addition, the performance of Neural Cleanse is contingent on trigger size, pattern, location and other factors . In fact, in some cases, its detection is unstable, e.g., falsely rejecting a clean model or falsely accepting a backdoored model    even when the attack is within its threat model. it is ineffective against source-specific backdoor attacks. The presented NTD eliminates these concerns. ABS [ref]14 (CCS’19). \nABS, short for Artificial Brain Stimulation, is an online model-based defense. It scans an ML model to find the target that significantly activates the neuron. It uses reverse engineering to distinguish between benign neurons and poisoned neurons. If there are more inputs that convert other labels into specific labels, then there is a high probability that the model is considered to be a backdoor attack model with triggers. However, this method assumes that the trigger only stimulates an internal neuron instead of a group of interacting neurons to increase activation.\nThis assumption may not be true in advanced attacks, e.g., multiple patches spread across the whole image as a trigger.\nIn addition, the ABS that is only effective against source-agnostic backdoor attack. The NTD has no these concerns. MNTD  (S&P’21). \nMNTD, short for Meta neural trojan detection, is an offline model-based defense. MNTD trains a meta classifier over a number of benign and backdoored ML models to infer whether an unforeseen model is backdoored or not. It requires training a large number of shadow models on the same task as the target model that will be checked. The MNTD has the advantage of defeating unknown attack strategies and generically being applicable to multiple domains such as vision, speech, and textual. However, it comes with the trade-off of heavy computational overhead. For example, it needs to train 4096 shadow models for the simple MNIST task, which takes about 14 hours. This appears to be magnitude computationally expensive comparing with training a clean model for the MNIST task by the users/defenders themselves. Training both the shadow models and the meta classifier do require ML expertise. Our presented NTD is also an attack strategy independent as the MNTD. Meanwhile, NTD voids the requirements of additional expensive training and ML expertise. SCAn  (USENIX’21). \nSCAn, short for Statistical contamination analyzer, is an offline data-based defense. Though SCAn can defeat the challenging source-specific backdoor attacks, it needs to access the training data that must contain the trigger samples to check and/or sanitize the data, which has a similar assumption to [ref]24 [ref]25. This assumption constrains its applicability [ref]24 [ref]25  as the attacker may not return the manipulated training data to the user or the attacker does not even interfere with the training data  .\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: Based on when a backdoor behavior is detected, existing countermeasures can be divided into two categories, i.e., offline    and online [ref]14   approaches.
