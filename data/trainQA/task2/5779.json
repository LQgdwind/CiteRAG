      "content": "Paper Title: On the link between generative semi-supervised learning and generative open-set recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur results clearly demonstrate the intrinsic connection between SSL and OSR GAN based methods. Classifiers capable of simultaneously detecting unobserved novel categories can now be trained using significantly fewer labeled training samples. Novelty detection in and of itself is very useful within a broad number of applications. For example, contamination, leaks or faults cause unusual patterns in fluid dynamics  5, and novel diseases can appear over time within any medical domain  . In fact, considering that all natural phenomena act over the temporal dimension, novel categories can appear in any inductive setting  . With our results, detecting and separating novel categories can now be conducted using a far more cost-efficient approach. Novelty detection also stands to benefit the general data cleaning process, which is critical for the optimisation of statistical modelling. Consider any general statistical model, e.g. linear regression or k-mean clustering, which are common in data science. These models are easily skewed by anomalies and novel categories. Thus, practitioners should either conduct a similar extensions of these models to OSR, as done in this study, or practitioners should use our proposed model as a pre-processing data-cleaning step. In turn, modelling would improve in accuracy and reduce the cost in domain specialist domains - e.g. material sciences   7, transport and logistics [ref]32, and grid optimisation 9. However, future SSL-OSR research should also take several other factors into consideration. Generally, SSL and OSR research consider balanced data settings. However, in real-world scenarios, it is uncommon for datasets to contain the same number of training samples for every category. Future studies should consider bridging SSL-OSR to label-imbalance settings where the number of labels is heavily skewed towards certain categories. However, GANs also hold promise for such settings since a GAN is able to generate realistic looking data (noting the contrast to this study) to balance the number of labels 1. Another factor that future studies might consider are multi-modal distributions. In the context of classification, multi-modal distributions are described as categories that prescribe to multiple output labels 4. Multi-modal datasets regularly occur in real-world environments, and so SSL-OSR should also consider these cases. It is also important for future research to consider another type of novel category that exists in partially labelled training sets. More specifically, observed novel categories are in contrast to unobserved novel categories since these appear scattered in unlabelled training sets 4 . Although this study focuses on conventional SSL (i.e. without observed novel categories), extending the combined framework of SSL-OSR to also consider observed novel categories would further enhance the practicality and cost-efficiency of classifier development . By detecting multiple novel category types, practitioners could discover new and interesting patterns under a combined framework of class-incremental learning and co-operative artificial intelligence 3 .\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: model as a pre-processing data-cleaning step.
