      "content": "Paper Title: Conjunctive categorial grammars and Lambek grammars with additives\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe translation from conjunctive categorial grammars to grammars based on 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC} (i.e., Lambek grammars with additives) actually uses only one additive operation, namely conjunction. This is unsurprising, since this operation exactly corresponds to the conjunction operation used in conjunctive categorial grammars. In this section, however, we show that a dual result also holds. Namely, for any conjunctive categorial grammar there exists a Lambek grammar with additive disjunction (but without additive conjunction) which describes the same language. The idea is based on the following equivalence: which allows replacing conjunction by disjunction. As usual, E≡F𝐸𝐹E\\equiv F means simultaneous derivability of E→F→𝐸𝐹E\\to F and F→E→𝐹𝐸F\\to E. If E≡F𝐸𝐹E\\equiv F, then replacing E𝐸E with F𝐹F in a sequent derivable in 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC} keeps its derivability, i.e., 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC} enjoys the property of equivalent replacement. Unfortunately, in the conjunctions we want to simulate using disjunction, the formulae are not of the form Ai​\\Bsubscript𝐴𝑖\\𝐵A_{i}\\mathop{\\backslash}B with the same B𝐵B. In order to fit the formulae into the given shape, we shall use the “relative double-negation” construction (see Buszkowski , Kanovich et al.  ): where f𝑓f is a variable. (In a “real” intuitionistic-style negation, f𝑓f should be the falsity constant; however, in 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC} we have no such constant.) The crucial property of this construction is given by the following lemma. If f𝑓f does not occur in A1,…,An→B→subscript𝐴1…subscript𝐴𝑛𝐵A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\to B, then this sequent is equiderivable with A1f​f,…,Anf​f→Bf​f→superscriptsubscript𝐴1𝑓𝑓…superscriptsubscript𝐴𝑛𝑓𝑓superscript𝐵𝑓𝑓A_{1}^{ff},\\ldots,A_{n}^{ff}\\to B^{ff}. As in Theorem 2 above, let the given conjunctive categorial grammar have the following axiomatic propositions: and let s𝑠s be its target category.\nLet f𝑓f be a fresh variable, not occurring in the formulae Ai,jsubscript𝐴𝑖𝑗A_{i,j}, and f≠s𝑓𝑠f\\neq s. This variable will be used in the relative double negation constructions. Let us replace each variable occurrence p𝑝p in each Ai,jsubscript𝐴𝑖𝑗A_{i,j} with its relative double negation pf​fsuperscript𝑝𝑓𝑓p^{ff}, and let us denote the resulting formula by Ai,j′subscriptsuperscript𝐴′𝑖𝑗A^{\\prime}_{i,j}. Since Ai,j∈𝐁𝐂𝐚𝐭∧subscript𝐴𝑖𝑗subscript𝐁𝐂𝐚𝐭A_{i,j}\\in\\mathbf{BCat}_{\\wedge}, it includes the conjunction operation only in conjuncts of the form p1∧…∧pksubscript𝑝1…subscript𝑝𝑘p_{1}\\wedge\\ldots\\wedge p_{k}. After the aforementioned substitution, such a conjunct becomes p1f​f∧…∧pkf​fsubscriptsuperscript𝑝𝑓𝑓1…subscriptsuperscript𝑝𝑓𝑓𝑘p^{ff}_{1}\\wedge\\ldots\\wedge p^{ff}_{k}, which is equivalent (in 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}) to the formula ((p1​\\f)∨…∨(pk​\\f))​\\fsubscript𝑝1\\𝑓…subscript𝑝𝑘\\𝑓\\𝑓((p_{1}\\mathop{\\backslash}f)\\vee\\ldots\\vee(p_{k}\\mathop{\\backslash}f))\\mathop{\\backslash}f. The latter uses disjunction instead of conjunction. Let us apply the equivalent replacement of each p1f​f∧…∧pkf​fsubscriptsuperscript𝑝𝑓𝑓1…subscriptsuperscript𝑝𝑓𝑓𝑘p^{ff}_{1}\\wedge\\ldots\\wedge p^{ff}_{k} with ((p1​\\f)∨…∨(pk​\\f))​\\fsubscript𝑝1\\𝑓…subscript𝑝𝑘\\𝑓\\𝑓((p_{1}\\mathop{\\backslash}f)\\vee\\ldots\\vee(p_{k}\\mathop{\\backslash}f))\\mathop{\\backslash}f in Ai,j′subscriptsuperscript𝐴′𝑖𝑗A^{\\prime}_{i,j} and obtain the formula denoted by Ai,j′′subscriptsuperscript𝐴′′𝑖𝑗A^{\\prime\\prime}_{i,j}. Next, define Bi′=(Ai,1′∧…∧Ai,ki′)f​fsubscriptsuperscript𝐵′𝑖superscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝐴′𝑖1…subscriptsuperscript𝐴′𝑖subscript𝑘𝑖𝑓𝑓B^{\\prime}_{i}=(A^{\\prime}_{i,1}\\wedge\\ldots\\wedge A^{\\prime}_{i,k_{i}})^{ff}, for each i𝑖i. Again, Bi′subscriptsuperscript𝐵′𝑖B^{\\prime}_{i} is equivalent to a formula with only disjunction, not conjunction: Bi′≡Bi′′=((Ai,1′′​\\f)∨…∨(Ai,ki′′​\\f))​\\fsubscriptsuperscript𝐵′𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝐵′′𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝐴′′𝑖1\\𝑓…subscriptsuperscript𝐴′′𝑖subscript𝑘𝑖\\𝑓\\𝑓B^{\\prime}_{i}\\equiv B^{\\prime\\prime}_{i}=((A^{\\prime\\prime}_{i,1}\\mathop{\\backslash}f)\\vee\\ldots\\vee(A^{\\prime\\prime}_{i,k_{i}}\\mathop{\\backslash}f))\\mathop{\\backslash}f. This construction yields the desired equivalence theorem. The Lambek grammar with atomic propositions Bi′′​(ai)subscriptsuperscript𝐵′′𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖B^{\\prime\\prime}_{i}(a_{i}), for i=1,…,n𝑖1…𝑛i=1,\\ldots,n, and the goal category (sf​f)f​fsuperscriptsuperscript𝑠𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓(s^{ff})^{ff} describes the same language as the original conjunctive categorial grammar. Moreover, categories of this Lambek grammar use only \\\\\\mathop{\\backslash}, /\\mathop{/}, and ∨\\vee, but not ∧\\wedge. Before proving this theorem, let us recall the definition of another logical system, namely, multiplicative-additive cyclic linear logic, denoted by 𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{MACLL}. This logic is a non-commutative variant of Girard’s linear logic (see Girard , Yetter ). Moreover, 𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{MACLL} does not include exponential operations of linear logic, because we shall not need them in our arguments. We formulate 𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{MACLL}, following Kanovich et al. [ref]16, as a one-sided sequent calculus with tight negations. Atoms are variables (p,q,r,…𝑝𝑞𝑟…p,q,r,\\ldots, corresponding to primitive categories) and their negations: p¯,q¯,r¯,…¯𝑝¯𝑞¯𝑟…\\bar{p},\\bar{q},\\bar{r},\\ldots Formulae of 𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{MACLL} are built from atoms and constants using operations, taken from the following table: Negation of an arbirary formula A𝐴A, denoted by A⊥superscript𝐴bottomA^{\\bot}, is defined externally as follows: Sequents of 𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{MACLL} are expressions of the form →Γ→absentΓ{}\\to\\Gamma, where Γ=A1,…,AnΓsubscript𝐴1…subscript𝐴𝑛\\Gamma=A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n} is a non-empty sequence of 𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{MACLL} formulae. The notion of substitution of formulae for variables in 𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{MACLL}, in the presence of tight negations, is a bit more involved. Namely, the operation [p:=A]delimited-[]assign𝑝𝐴[p:=A] replaces each occurrence of atom p𝑝p with A𝐴A and each occurrence of atom p¯¯𝑝\\bar{p} with A⊥superscript𝐴bottomA^{\\bot}. Axioms and inference rules of 𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{MACLL} are depicted in Figure 6. Notice that there is no rule for constant 00 (additive falsity); one may only introduce it together with ⊤top\\top, using (ax)ax(\\mathrm{ax}) or (⊤)top(\\top). Two formulae A𝐴A and B𝐵B are called equivalent (notation: A≡B𝐴𝐵A\\equiv B), if the sequents →A⊥,B→absentsuperscript𝐴bottom𝐵\\to A^{\\bot},B and →B⊥,A→absentsuperscript𝐵bottom𝐴\\to B^{\\bot},A are both derivable. Interchanging equivalent formulae does not alter derivability. The following translation maps Lambek formulae with additives to 𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{MACLL} formulae: This translation actually gives an exact (conservative) embedding of 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂∗superscript𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}^{\\boldsymbol{*}} into 𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{MACLL}. The sequent A1,…,An→B→subscript𝐴1…subscript𝐴𝑛𝐵A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\to B is derivable in 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂∗superscript𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}^{\\boldsymbol{*}} if and only if its translation →A^n⊥,…,A^1⊥,B^→absentsuperscriptsubscript^𝐴𝑛bottom…superscriptsubscript^𝐴1bottom^𝐵{}\\to\\widehat{A}_{n}^{\\bot},\\ldots,\\widehat{A}_{1}^{\\bot},\\widehat{B} is derivable in 𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{MACLL}. This theorem is a non-commutative variant of an embedding result by Schellinx  for intuitionistic and classical versions of commutative linear logic. Pentus  proved a weaker version of Theorem E, without additives. Let us first prove Theorem 5 for 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂∗superscript𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}^{\\boldsymbol{*}}.\nAs in Theorem 2, we establish the following statement. For any string ai1​…​aimsubscript𝑎subscript𝑖1…subscript𝑎subscript𝑖𝑚a_{i_{1}}\\ldots a_{i_{m}} the statement s​(ai1​…​aim)𝑠subscript𝑎subscript𝑖1…subscript𝑎subscript𝑖𝑚s(a_{i_{1}}\\ldots a_{i_{m}}) is derivable in the conjunctive categorial grammar if and only if the sequent Bi1′′,…,Bim′′→(sf​f)f​f→subscriptsuperscript𝐵′′subscript𝑖1…subscriptsuperscript𝐵′′subscript𝑖𝑚superscriptsuperscript𝑠𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓B^{\\prime\\prime}_{i_{1}},\\ldots,B^{\\prime\\prime}_{i_{m}}\\to(s^{ff})^{ff} is derivable in 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂∗superscript𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}^{\\boldsymbol{*}}. For convenience, let us replace each Bi′′subscriptsuperscript𝐵′′𝑖B^{\\prime\\prime}_{i} with its equivalent Bi′subscriptsuperscript𝐵′𝑖B^{\\prime}_{i}. These formulae contain conjunction, but this is used only inside the proof, not in the final statement. Due to cut elimination, the goal sequents of the form Bi1′′,…,Bim′′→(sf​f)f​f→subscriptsuperscript𝐵′′subscript𝑖1…subscriptsuperscript𝐵′′subscript𝑖𝑚superscriptsuperscript𝑠𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓B^{\\prime\\prime}_{i_{1}},\\ldots,B^{\\prime\\prime}_{i_{m}}\\to(s^{ff})^{ff} will still have conjunction-free derivations. Let us start with the “if” part. Let the sequent Bi1′,…,Bim′→(sf​f)f​f→subscriptsuperscript𝐵′subscript𝑖1…subscriptsuperscript𝐵′subscript𝑖𝑚superscriptsuperscript𝑠𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓B^{\\prime}_{i_{1}},\\ldots,B^{\\prime}_{i_{m}}\\to(s^{ff})^{ff} be derivable in 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂∗superscript𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}^{\\boldsymbol{*}}. Consider its translation into 𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{MACLL}, →(B^im′)⊥,…,(B^i1′)⊥,(sf​f)f​f^→absentsuperscriptsubscriptsuperscript^𝐵′subscript𝑖𝑚bottom…superscriptsubscriptsuperscript^𝐵′subscript𝑖1bottom^superscriptsuperscript𝑠𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓{}\\to(\\widehat{B}^{\\prime}_{i_{m}})^{\\bot},\\ldots,(\\widehat{B}^{\\prime}_{i_{1}})^{\\bot},\\widehat{(s^{ff})^{ff}}. This sequent is derivable by Theorem E. Now let us substitute the multiplicative falsity constant ⊥bottom\\bot for f𝑓f. The sequent keeps being derivable.\nIt is easy to show that after such substitution each formula of the form Ff​f^^superscript𝐹𝑓𝑓\\widehat{F^{ff}} becomes equivalent to F^^𝐹\\widehat{F}. Indeed,\nFf​f^=(f¯⊗F^)​&f^superscript𝐹𝑓𝑓tensor-product¯𝑓^𝐹&𝑓\\widehat{F^{ff}}=(\\bar{f}\\otimes\\widehat{F})\\mathop{\\raisebox{6.00006pt}{\\rotatebox{180.0}{\\&}}}f transforms into (1⊗F^)​&⊥≡F^limit-fromtensor-product1^𝐹&bottom^𝐹(1\\otimes\\widehat{F})\\mathop{\\raisebox{6.00006pt}{\\rotatebox{180.0}{\\&}}}\\bot\\equiv\\widehat{F} (since 111 is neutral for ⊗tensor-product\\otimes and ⊥bottom\\bot is neutral for &&\\mathop{\\raisebox{6.00006pt}{\\rotatebox{180.0}{\\&}}}). In other words, substituting ⊥bottom\\bot for f𝑓f transforms relative double negation into “real” double negation, which can be removed due to the classical nature of 𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{MACLL}. Thus, after this substitution we get derivability of the sequent →(B^im)⊥,…,(B^i1)⊥,s→absentsuperscriptsubscript^𝐵subscript𝑖𝑚bottom…superscriptsubscript^𝐵subscript𝑖1bottom𝑠\\to(\\widehat{B}_{i_{m}})^{\\bot},\\ldots,\\linebreak(\\widehat{B}_{i_{1}})^{\\bot},s in 𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{MACLL}. By Theorem E, its preimage Bi1,…,Bim→s→subscript𝐵subscript𝑖1…subscript𝐵subscript𝑖𝑚𝑠B_{i_{1}},\\ldots,B_{i_{m}}\\to s is derivable in 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂∗superscript𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}^{\\boldsymbol{*}}. As noticed above, for sequents of this form derivability in 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂∗superscript𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}^{\\boldsymbol{*}} is equivalent to that in 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}. Finally, the “if” part of Theorem 2 gives derivability of s​(ai1​…​aim)𝑠subscript𝑎subscript𝑖1…subscript𝑎subscript𝑖𝑚s(a_{i_{1}}\\ldots a_{i_{m}}) in the conjunctive categorial grammar. The “only if” part is proven using the relative double negation lemma. Let s​(ai1​…​aim)𝑠subscript𝑎subscript𝑖1…subscript𝑎subscript𝑖𝑚s(a_{i_{1}}\\ldots a_{i_{m}}) be derivable in the conjunctive categorial grammar. By the “only if” part of Theorem 2, the sequent Bi1,…,Bim→s→subscript𝐵subscript𝑖1…subscript𝐵subscript𝑖𝑚𝑠B_{i_{1}},\\ldots,B_{i_{m}}\\to s is derivable in 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}, and therefore in 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂∗superscript𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}^{\\boldsymbol{*}}. Let us substitute pjf​fsuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝑗𝑓𝑓p_{j}^{ff} for each variable pjsubscript𝑝𝑗p_{j} (in particular, sf​fsuperscript𝑠𝑓𝑓s^{ff} for s𝑠s). Since Bi=Ai1∧…∧Ai,kisubscript𝐵𝑖subscript𝐴subscript𝑖1…subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝑘𝑖B_{i}=A_{i_{1}}\\wedge\\ldots\\wedge A_{i,k_{i}}, this yields derivability of the following sequent: Now Lemma D yields derivability of its relative double negation translation: or Bi1′,…,Bim′→(sf​f)f​f,→subscriptsuperscript𝐵′subscript𝑖1…subscriptsuperscript𝐵′subscript𝑖𝑚superscriptsuperscript𝑠𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓B^{\\prime}_{i_{1}},\\ldots,B^{\\prime}_{i_{m}}\\to(s^{ff})^{ff}, which is equivalent the desired sequent: In order to cover the case of 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}, we claim that for sequents of the form Bi1′′,…,Bim′′→(sf​f)f​f→subscriptsuperscript𝐵′′subscript𝑖1…subscriptsuperscript𝐵′′subscript𝑖𝑚superscriptsuperscript𝑠𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓B^{\\prime\\prime}_{i_{1}},\\ldots,B^{\\prime\\prime}_{i_{m}}\\to(s^{ff})^{ff} (which are used in the grammar\nconstructed above) their derivability in 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC} is equivalent to the one in 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂∗superscript𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}^{\\boldsymbol{*}}. Indeed, for any subformula F𝐹F of such a sequent, →F→absent𝐹{}\\to F is not derivable. Hence, each 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂∗superscript𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}^{\\boldsymbol{*}} derivation actually obeys Lambek’s non-emptiness restriction, i.e., it is a 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC} derivation.\n∎ Languages with the empty string can also be handled in this setting, yielding the following variant of Theorem 4. Any language described by a conjunctive grammar can be generated by a 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂∗superscript𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}^{\\boldsymbol{*}}-grammar whose categories use only \\\\\\mathop{\\backslash}, /\\mathop{/}, and ∨\\vee. Let us first consider the case where the given language L𝐿L does not include ε𝜀\\varepsilon. If ε∉L𝜀𝐿\\varepsilon\\notin L, one just takes the grammar constructed in Theorem 5 as the desired 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂∗superscript𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}^{\\boldsymbol{*}}-grammar. Now let ε∈L𝜀𝐿\\varepsilon\\in L. Then let us substitute, in the given 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂∗superscript𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}^{\\boldsymbol{*}}-grammar with disjunction, D=((r​\\r)​\\((t​\\t)​\\q))​\\q𝐷𝑟\\𝑟\\𝑡\\𝑡\\𝑞\\𝑞D=\\bigl{(}(r\\mathop{\\backslash}r)\\mathop{\\backslash}((t\\mathop{\\backslash}t)\\mathop{\\backslash}q)\\bigr{)}\\mathop{\\backslash}q for s𝑠s. This substitution adds ε𝜀\\varepsilon to the language and keeps there all the non-empty strings from L𝐿L. It remains to show that no extra non-empty string becomes generated by the grammar. This is proved by the same argument as in the “if” part of Theorem 5. Namely, we replace the sequent Bi1′′​[s:=D],…,Bim′′​[s:=D]→(Df​f)f​f→subscriptsuperscript𝐵′′subscript𝑖1delimited-[]assign𝑠𝐷…subscriptsuperscript𝐵′′subscript𝑖𝑚delimited-[]assign𝑠𝐷superscriptsuperscript𝐷𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓B^{\\prime\\prime}_{i_{1}}[s:=D],\\ldots,B^{\\prime\\prime}_{i_{m}}[s:=D]\\to(D^{ff})^{ff} with the equivalent sequent\nBi1′​[s:=D],…,Bim′​[s:=D]→(Df​f)f​f→subscriptsuperscript𝐵′subscript𝑖1delimited-[]assign𝑠𝐷…subscriptsuperscript𝐵′subscript𝑖𝑚delimited-[]assign𝑠𝐷superscriptsuperscript𝐷𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓B^{\\prime}_{i_{1}}[s:=D],\\ldots,B^{\\prime}_{i_{m}}[s:=D]\\to(D^{ff})^{ff} and translate it into 𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{MACLL}: Next, we substitute ⊥bottom\\bot for f𝑓f and get derivability of →(B^im)⊥​[s:=D^],…,(B^i1)⊥​[s:=D^],D→absentsuperscriptsubscript^𝐵subscript𝑖𝑚bottomdelimited-[]assign𝑠^𝐷…superscriptsubscript^𝐵subscript𝑖1bottomdelimited-[]assign𝑠^𝐷𝐷{}\\to(\\widehat{B}_{i_{m}})^{\\bot}[s:=\\widehat{D}],\\ldots,(\\widehat{B}_{i_{1}})^{\\bot}[s:=\\widehat{D}],D in 𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{MACLL}, and therefore\nderivability of Bi1​[s:=D],…,Bim​[s:=D]→D→subscript𝐵subscript𝑖1delimited-[]assign𝑠𝐷…subscript𝐵subscript𝑖𝑚delimited-[]assign𝑠𝐷𝐷B_{i_{1}}[s:=D],\\ldots,B_{i_{m}}[s:=D]\\to D in 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂∗superscript𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}^{\\boldsymbol{*}}. By construction from Section 7 (Lemma 7), this entails, for m>0𝑚0m>0, derivability of Bi1,…,Bim→s→subscript𝐵subscript𝑖1…subscript𝐵subscript𝑖𝑚𝑠B_{i_{1}},\\ldots,B_{i_{m}}\\to s in 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂∗superscript𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}^{\\boldsymbol{*}}. Hence, the given non-empty string belongs to the original language L𝐿L.\n∎ Finally, as a corollary, we get the following version of Theorem I by Kanazawa . Any finite intersection of context-free languages is described by a 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}-grammar using only \\\\\\mathop{\\backslash}, /\\mathop{/}, and ∨\\vee. The same holds for 𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐂\\mathbf{MALC}, provided the given intersection does not include ε𝜀\\varepsilon.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: 𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐀𝐂𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{MACLL} does not include exponential operations of linear logic, because we shall not need them in our arguments.
