Effective resistances arise for a broad set of graph processing tasks and have multiple equivalent definitions. For example, rG​(a,b)subscript𝑟𝐺𝑎𝑏{r}_{G}(a,b) is proportional to the expected roundtrip commute time between a𝑎a and b𝑏b in the natural random walk induced on the graph and when {a,b}𝑎𝑏\\{a,b\\} is an edge in the graph, it is proportional to the probability that the edge is in a random spanning tree. Effective resistances are also a metric on the vertices  [ref]6 and are a key measure of proximity between vertex pairs. Correspondingly, effective resistances can arise in a variety of data analysis tasks. For example, effective resistances have been used in social network analysis for measuring edge centrality in social networks  as well as for measuring chemical distances . Effective resistances have a broad range of algorithmic implications. Sampling edges of a graph using effective resistance is known to efficiently produce cut and spectral sparsifiers (sparse graphs which approximately preserve cuts, random walk properties, and more) [ref]9  [ref]11. Effective resistance-based graph sparsifiers have also been applied to develop fast graph attention neural networks , to design graph convolutional neural networks for action recognition , to sample from Gaussian graphical models , and beyond  . Effective resistances have been used in algorithms for maximum flow problems,       , sampling random spanning trees   , and graph partitioning  . More recently, effective resistances have also been used to analyze the problem of oversquashing in GNNs and in designing algorithms to alleviate oversquashing    and have been applied to increase expressivity when incorporated as edge features in certain GNNs .\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: the graph and when {a,b}𝑎𝑏\\{a,b\\} is an edge in the graph, it is proportional to the probability that the edge is in a random spanning tree.

Correspondingly, effective resistances can arise in a variety of data analysis tasks. For example, effective resistances have been used\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
