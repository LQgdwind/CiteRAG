      "content": "Paper Title: Strong Algebras and Radical Sylvester-Gallai Configurations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn 1893, Sylvester posed a fundamental question in combinatorial geometry (): given a finite set of distinct points {v1,…,vm}⊂ℝ2subscript𝑣1…subscript𝑣𝑚superscriptℝ2\\{v_{1},\\ldots,v_{m}\\}\\subset{\\mathbb{R}}^{2} such that the line defined by any pair of distinct points vi,vjsubscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑣𝑗v_{i},v_{j} contains a third point vksubscript𝑣𝑘v_{k} in the set, must all points in the set be collinear?\nThis question was answered positively and independently by Melchior and Gallai  , and is now known as the Sylvester-Gallai (SG) theorem. Since then, mathematicians and computer scientists have given considerable attention to generalizations of Sylvester’s question       [ref]50   , and results such as the above are known as Sylvester-Gallai (SG) type theorems.\nIn its most general form, a Sylvester-Gallai (SG) configuration is a finite set of geometric objects which satisfy certain local conditions or dependencies.\nFor instance, in the original question, the geometric objects are points and the local dependencies are collinear dependencies amongst triples from the set.\nThe main theme underlying Sylvester-Gallai type problems is the following local-to-global phenomenon: must these local constraints on the geometric objects imply a global constraint on such configurations?\nMore specifically, the main question of concern is: Are Sylvester-Gallai type configurations always low-dimensional? The answer to this question has turned out to be affirmative for various Sylvester-Gallai type problems with linear algebraic constraints.\nThe above works prove beautiful generalizations of the classical SG theorem such as the colored, robust and higher dimensional linear SG theorems.\nFor a comprehensive survey on earlier works, we refer the reader to . Linear Sylvester-Gallai type theorems have been successfully applied to obtain important consequences in diverse subfields of theoretical computer science.\nIn algebraic complexity theory, linear Sylvester-Gallai theorems were used in algorithms for Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) and reconstruction of depth-3 circuits of bounded top fanin    .\nIn coding theory, linear Sylvester-Gallai theorems were used to prove non-existence of 2-query Locally Correctable Codes over fields of characteristic zero . In this paper we prove a non-linear generalization of the SG theorem, which is at the intersection of algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, algebraic complexity theory and combinatorics.\nMotivated by the PIT problem for depth-4 circuits, we consider Sylvester-Gallai configurations where the geometric objects are hypersurfaces in a projective space, or equivalently homogeneous polynomials in a polynomial ring 𝕂​[x1,⋯,xN]𝕂subscript𝑥1⋯subscript𝑥𝑁{\\mathbb{K}}[x_{1},\\cdots,x_{N}].\nThe local constraint is given by radical dependence of triples of polynomials, which implies the following geometric constraint:\nfor any two distinct hypersurfaces Yi,Yj⊂ℙN−1subscript𝑌𝑖subscript𝑌𝑗superscriptℙ𝑁1Y_{i},Y_{j}\\subset{\\mathbb{P}}^{N-1} in the configuration, there is a third hypersurface Yksubscript𝑌𝑘Y_{k} in the configuration such that Yi∩Yj⊂Yksubscript𝑌𝑖subscript𝑌𝑗subscript𝑌𝑘Y_{i}\\cap Y_{j}\\subset Y_{k}. We now formally describe such SG configurations.\nHenceforth, we adopt the standard notation and use the term form to refer to a homogeneous polynomial.\nWe also let 𝕂𝕂{\\mathbb{K}} be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 00 and denote our polynomial ring by S:=𝕂​[x1,…,xN]assign𝑆𝕂subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑁S:={\\mathbb{K}}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{N}]. Let d𝑑d be a positive integer.\nWe say that a finite set ℱ={F1,…,Fm}⊂Sℱsubscript𝐹1…subscript𝐹𝑚𝑆\\mathcal{F}=\\{F_{1},\\ldots,F_{m}\\}\\subset S of irreducible forms of degree ≤dabsent𝑑\\leq d is a d​-radical-SG𝑑-radical-SG{d}\\textnormal{-radical-SG} configuration if the following conditions hold: Fi∉(Fj)subscript𝐹𝑖subscript𝐹𝑗F_{i}\\not\\in(F_{j}) for any i≠j∈[m]𝑖𝑗delimited-[]𝑚i\\neq j\\in[m],  (pairwise non-associate forms) for every pair Fi,Fjsubscript𝐹𝑖subscript𝐹𝑗F_{i},F_{j}, there is k≠i,j𝑘𝑖𝑗k\\neq i,j such that Fk∈rad⁡(Fi,Fj)subscript𝐹𝑘radsubscript𝐹𝑖subscript𝐹𝑗F_{k}\\in\\operatorname{rad}(F_{i},F_{j}).  (radical SG condition) Note that if d=1𝑑1d=1, the definition above specializes to the dual of the linear Sylvester-Gallai condition for points in ℙN−1superscriptℙ𝑁1{\\mathbb{P}}^{N-1}.\nIn this case, condition (1) is equivalent to the linear forms being pairwise linearly independent.\nFor examples of linear and higher degree radical Sylvester-Gallai configurations, we refer to Section 3.3. Our main result is to prove that such SG configurations must be “low dimensional.”\nMore formally, we prove the following theorem. There exists an increasing function λ:ℕ→ℕ:𝜆→ℕℕ\\lambda:{\\mathbb{N}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{N}} such that\nif ℱ⊂𝕂​[x1,…,xN]ℱ𝕂subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑁\\mathcal{F}\\subset{\\mathbb{K}}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{N}] is a d​-radical-SG𝑑-radical-SG{d}\\textnormal{-radical-SG} configuration, then we have That is, the dimension of the 𝕂𝕂{\\mathbb{K}}-linear span of ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} is bounded above by a function only of d𝑑d, independent of 𝕂𝕂{\\mathbb{K}}, N𝑁N and the number of polynomials m𝑚m. Theorem 1.2 settles a conjecture of Gupta [35, Conjecture 2], which is a fundamental first step towards completing Gupta’s program to solve the PIT problem for depth-4 circuits with bounded top and bottom fanins.\nOur result generalizes the results of  , which proved Gupta’s conjecture for d=2,3𝑑23d=2,3 respectively.\nFor d=1𝑑1d=1, the statement is equivalent to the linear SG theorem over the field 𝕂𝕂{\\mathbb{K}}, which is one of the ingredients of our proof.\nTheorem 1.2 is a consequence of our main technical result (see Theorem 1.8), which works in a more general setting of radical SG-configurations of reducible forms in graded unique factorization domains which are quotients of polynomial rings by strong sequences. Our perspective highlights the geometric aspects of Sylvester-Gallai problems.\nWhen viewed through the algebraic and computational lens (via the algebra-geometry dictionary), one realizes that these problems are intrinsically related to the study of cancellations or syzygies in algebraic problems.\nIn algebraic and computational terms, the Sylvester-Gallai question can be rephrased as: Must Sylvester-Gallai configurations depend only on “few variables”? Thus, from an algebraic point of view, the radical Sylvester-Gallai problem is a question about bounding the syzygies of the configuration of polynomials.\nA key observation is that Sylvester-Gallai problems can be viewed in light of the commutative algebraic principle of Stillman uniformity.\nOne way to quantify the complexity of a set of polynomials {F1,⋯,Fm}⊂𝕂​[x1,⋯,xN]subscript𝐹1⋯subscript𝐹𝑚𝕂subscript𝑥1⋯subscript𝑥𝑁\\{F_{1},\\cdots,F_{m}\\}\\subset{\\mathbb{K}}[x_{1},\\cdots,x_{N}], is to measure various commutative algebraic invariants of the ideal I=(F1,⋯,Fm)𝐼subscript𝐹1⋯subscript𝐹𝑚I=(F_{1},\\cdots,F_{m}), such as the degree, projective dimension and Betti numbers, among others.\nIn general, polynomials in N𝑁N variables will have greater complexity as N𝑁N increases.\nHowever, the following principle of so-called Stillman uniformity  emerges from several recent developments in commutative algebra.\nIf the degree and the number of polynomials is held fixed, then the complexity of polynomials remains bounded even if N𝑁N increases, because they depend on few “variables”   .\nA model case of this phenomenon is the breakthrough work of , which proves Stillman’s conjecture by constructing strong subalgebras of polynomial rings. Even though the Sylvester-Gallai question above has a striking similarity with Stillman uniformity, a major difference is that in the commutative algebraic works mentioned above, the bounds necessarily depend on the number of polynomials defining the ideal.\nOn the other hand, in Sylvester-Gallai type problems the bounds must be independent of the number of polynomials.\nAlso, note that Theorem 1.2 provides an uniform bound (independent of 𝕂𝕂{\\mathbb{K}}, N𝑁N and m𝑚m) on the dimension of the 𝕂𝕂{\\mathbb{K}}-linear span of F1,⋯,Fmsubscript𝐹1⋯subscript𝐹𝑚F_{1},\\cdots,F_{m}, which is much stronger than any Stillman uniformity type bound on other algebraic invariants.\nIndeed, we obtain the following consequence of Theorem 1.2, which provides uniform bounds for several algebraic invariants of a radical Sylvester-Gallai configuration, via Stillman uniformity. There exist functions λdeg,λreg,λp​d​i​m,λβi,j:ℕ→ℕ:subscript𝜆degreesubscript𝜆regsubscript𝜆𝑝𝑑𝑖𝑚subscript𝜆subscript𝛽𝑖𝑗→ℕℕ\\lambda_{\\deg},\\lambda_{\\mathrm{reg}},\\lambda_{pdim},\\lambda_{\\beta_{i,j}}:{\\mathbb{N}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{N}}, such that the following holds. If ℱ={F1,…,Fm}⊂𝕂​[x1,…,xN]ℱsubscript𝐹1…subscript𝐹𝑚𝕂subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑁\\mathcal{F}=\\{F_{1},\\ldots,F_{m}\\}\\subset{\\mathbb{K}}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{N}] is a d​-radical-SG𝑑-radical-SG{d}\\textnormal{-radical-SG} configuration, and I=(F1,⋯,Fm)𝐼subscript𝐹1⋯subscript𝐹𝑚I=(F_{1},\\cdots,F_{m}), then the following invariants of I𝐼I are uniformly bounded by functions independent of 𝕂𝕂{\\mathbb{K}}, N𝑁N and m𝑚m. degree of I𝐼I, i.e. deg⁡(I)≤λdeg​(d)degree𝐼subscript𝜆degree𝑑\\deg(I)\\leq\\lambda_{\\deg}(d). projective dimension of I𝐼I, i.e. pdim​(I)≤λp​d​i​m​(d)pdim𝐼subscript𝜆𝑝𝑑𝑖𝑚𝑑\\mathrm{pdim}(I)\\leq\\lambda_{pdim}(d), Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, i.e. reg​(I)≤λreg​(d)reg𝐼subscript𝜆reg𝑑\\mathrm{reg}(I)\\leq\\lambda_{\\mathrm{reg}}(d), the (i,j)𝑖𝑗(i,j)-th Betti numbers of I𝐼I, i.e. βi​j​(I)≤λβi,j​(d)subscript𝛽𝑖𝑗𝐼subscript𝜆subscript𝛽𝑖𝑗𝑑\\beta_{ij}(I)\\leq\\lambda_{\\beta_{i,j}}(d). In fact, several other invariants of I𝐼I such as the number of minimal or associated primes, degrees and number of generators of minimal primes will also be uniformly bounded. We refer to   for a list of such invariants. On one hand, Sylvester-Gallai problems demand a much stronger uniform bounds than Stillman’s uniformity.\nOn the other hand, SG configurations possess many combinatorial and geometric properties.\nHence the challenges posed by the Sylvester-Gallai problem are novel in nature and require new techniques to overcome them.\nTo that end, we build upon the work of  and generalize their methods to work over quotients of polynomial rings.\nWe also develop several algebraic geometric tools to prove effective quantitative bounds for commutative algebraic questions appearing naturally in SG type problems.\nOur results enable us to carry out an inductive argument by leveraging the combinatorics of the configuration and eventually we reduce the radical SG problem to the robust linear SG theorem.\nWe expect these techniques to be fundamental for the full resolution of Gupta’s program to obtain a polynomial-time deterministic black-box PIT algorithm for dept-4 circuits with bounded top and bottom fanin.\nIn the following subsections we discuss how SG problems are motivated from PIT, our results, technical contributions, key ideas and an overview of the proof, some of which are interesting in their own right.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: Gallai  , and is now known as the Sylvester-Gallai (SG) theorem.
