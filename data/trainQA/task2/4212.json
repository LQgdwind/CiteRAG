We compare the performance of our method to the unstructured MLP + iCEM variant (CEE-US without GNNs) as well as other intrinsic motivation baselines: Disagreement [ref]16 The one-step disagreement of an MLP ensemble is used as an intrinsic reward to train an exploration policy. Random Network Distillation  A predictor network, corresponding to the forward model, tries to match the output of a target network with random weights. The discrepancy between the two networks is used as an intrinsic reward (a type of state visitation count for continuous domains).   CEE-US    MLP + iCEM    Disagreement    RND\n   ICM\n\n relative time ICM [ref]6 The intrinsic reward is defined as the error between an MLP forward model’s next state prediction and the actual next state. As this method needs access to the true next state, the intrinsic reward can only be computed retrospectively. The intrinsic reward is used to train an exploration policy in these methods. We use the implementation from Laskin et al.  that uses DDPG [ref]26.\nIn Fig. 4, we present different metrics quantifying the amount and type of interactions that occur during the free play in the Playground environment.\nIt is eminent that CEE-US is only shortly interacting with the walls and then quickly interacts with one and two objects simultaneously. The next best method is the ablation of our method using MLP models needing about ten times more interactions, as explained in Fig. 3.\nThe baselines are mainly moving in free space and interacting with the walls. RND starts interacting with the objects in at least 10% of the times-steps. In the Construction environment, the situation is even more drastic, as shown in Fig. 5.\nCEE-US starts repeatedly moving one object after only eight iterations (each 2000 environment steps), picks up objects after around 30 iterations, and continues with throwing and flipping objects and moving multiple objects frequently after 50 iterations.\nIn Fig. 2 exemplary behaviors are shown in terms of snapshots at different stages of learning.\nWe believe this sample efficiency is remarkable.\nThe ablation of our method with MLP models is also able to engage in interesting and diverse interactions, but at a much slower rate (Fig. 5).\nThe policy learning baselines rarely interact with objects, even after 300 iterations with 20 episodes each.   CEE-US    MLP + iCEM    Disagreement    RND\n   ICM\n\n relative time\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: during intrinsic free-play.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
