      "content": "Paper Title: Enumeration for MSO-Queries on Compressed Trees\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe paradigm of algorithmics on compressed data (ACD) aims at solving fundamental computational tasks directly on compressed data objects, without prior decompression. This allows us to work in a completely compressed setting, where our data is always stored and processed in a compressed form. ACD works very well with respect to grammar-based compression with so-called straight-line programs (SLPs). Such SLPs use grammar-like formalisms in order to specify how to construct the data object from small building blocks. For example, an SLP for a string w𝑤w is just a context-free grammar for the language {w}𝑤\\{w\\}, which can be seen as a sequence of instructions that construct w𝑤w from the terminal symbols. For instance, the SLP S→A​A→𝑆𝐴𝐴S\\to AA, A→B​B​C→𝐴𝐵𝐵𝐶A\\to BBC, B→b​a→𝐵𝑏𝑎B\\to ba, C→c​b→𝐶𝑐𝑏C\\to cb (where S,A,B,C𝑆𝐴𝐵𝐶S,A,B,C are nonterminals and a,b,c𝑎𝑏𝑐a,b,c are terminals) produces\nthe string b​a​b​a​c​b​b​a​b​a​c​b𝑏𝑎𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑏𝑏𝑎𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑏babacbbabacb. String SLPs are very popular and many results exist that demonstrate their wide-range applicability (see, e. g.,     for some recent publications, and the survey ). Moreover, SLPs achieve very good compression rates in practice (exponential in the best case)\nand are tightly related to dictionary based compression, in particular LZ77 and LZ78  . An important point is that the ACD pradigm may lead to substantial running time improvements over the uncompressed setting. Indeed, the algorithm’s running time only depends on the size of the compressed input, so the smaller size of the input may directly translate into a lower running time. For example, if the same problem can be solved in linear time both in the uncompressed and in the compressed setting, then in the case that the input can be compressed from size n𝑛n to size 𝒪​(log⁡(n))𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\log(n)), the algorithm in the compressed setting is exponentially faster. This is not just hypothetically speaking. In the field of string algorithms several fundamental problems are known with this behaviour, e. g., string pattern matching . Recently, the ACD paradigm has been combined with the enumeration perspective of query evaluation. In   [ref]34, the information extraction framework of document spanners is investigated in the compressed setting, and it has been shown that the results of regular spanners over SLP-compressed text documents can be enumerated with linear preprocessing and constant delay.\nApplying SLP-based ACD in the framework of document spanners suggests itself, since this is essentially a query model for string data (or sequences), and ACD is most famous in the realm of string algorithms. We consider a different classical evaluation problem in the compressed setting: MSO-queries on trees. It is known that MSO-queries can be enumerated with linear preprocessing and output-linear delay\n  4 5. Output linear delay means that the delay is linearly bounded by the size of the next element that is enumerated. If the elements of the solution have constant size (like, e. g., for document spanners), then constant delay and output-linear delay are the same. Our main result extends the work of  4 5 to the setting, where the\ntree is given in a compressed representation. Our data models are unranked forests, and as compression scheme, we consider forest straight-line programs (FSLPs) 1. This is a convenient and versatile grammar-based compression scheme for unranked forests, which also covers other SLP-models from the literature. As usual, MSO-queries are represented by tree automata. Let us now explain the concept of SLP-compression of trees and forests in more detail. Grammar-compression of trees and forests: An advantage of grammar-based compression is that it can be easily extended to other data types. For example, by using a context-free grammar formalism for trees, we can define tree SLPs 9   and use them for the compression of ranked trees. However, in the context of database theory, we are rather interested in unranked trees and forests as data model. A typical example of such data are XML tree structures. Therefore, we use forest straight-line programs (FSLPs) introduced in 1. Let us sketch this model. The set of rules of a string SLP essentially define a DAG (directed acyclic graph) whose inner nodes (resp., leaves) are the non-terminals (resp., terminals)\nof the grammar. The edges of the DAG are defined by the productions of the grammar (e. g., S→A​B→𝑆𝐴𝐵S\\to AB means that from S𝑆S there is a left edge to A𝐴A and a right edge to B𝐵B). This DAG can also be seen as an algebraic circuit over the free monoid Σ∗superscriptΣ\\Sigma^{*} where ΣΣ\\Sigma is the terminal alphabet.\nFSLPs are also DAGs that represent circuits, but the underlying algebraic structure is the forest algebra (see ). The elements of this algebra are forests over the alphabet Σ∪{∗}Σ∗\\Sigma\\cup\\{\\ast\\}\n(i.e., ordered sequences of unranked trees with nodes labelled by symbols from Σ∪{∗}Σ∗\\Sigma\\cup\\{\\ast\\}) with the restriction that the special symbol ∗∗\\ast occurs at most once in a forest and moreover only at a leaf position. Intuitively, ∗∗\\ast represents a substitution point where another\nforest can be plugged in. Such forests can be built from atomic forests of the form a∈Σ𝑎Σa\\in\\Sigma (representing a single node-labelled a𝑎a) and\na∗subscript𝑎∗a_{\\ast} (representing a node-labelled ΣΣ\\Sigma with a single child labelled ∗∗\\ast) using two operations:\nthe operation ⊖⊖\\mathbin{\\varominus} horizontally concatenates two forests (where ∗∗\\ast is allowed to occur in at most one of them) and the operation ⦶⦶\\mathbin{\\varobar} substitutes in a forest F1subscript𝐹1F_{1} containing ∗∗\\ast the unique occurrence of ∗∗\\ast by a second forest F2subscript𝐹2F_{2}. The tree Tesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e} in Figure 1 shows an expression in the forest algebra that evaluates to the tree T𝑇T at the right of Figure 2. Now the DAG D𝐷D at the left of Figure 2 is an FSLP, since it is a natural DAG representation of Tesubscript𝑇𝑒T_{e}. An FSLP produces a unique forest that we denote with\n⟦D⟧delimited-⟦⟧𝐷\\llbracket D\\rrbracket. For the FSLP at the left of Figure 2 it is exactly the tree T𝑇T at the right of Figure 2.\nConsequently, FSLPs follow a two stage approach: A forest is represented as the parse-tree of a forest algebra expression, and this parse-tree is then folded into a DAG. Let us motivate our choice of FSLPs as compression scheme.\nFirst, FSLPs can describe node-labelled unranked forests and therefore cover a large number of tree structures (e.g. XML tree structures). Moreover, FSLPs also cover other popular tree compression schemes like top dags  5 4 and tree straight-line programs 9 . Furthermore, there exist compressors such as TreeRePair that produce FSLPs111Actually, TreeRePair works for ranked trees.\nIt can produce a tree SLP for the first-child-next-sibling of an unranked forest F𝐹F. This tree SLP can be transformed\nin linear time into an equivalent FSLP for F𝐹F 1. and\nshow excellent compression ratios in practice.\nFor a corpus of typical XML documents, the number of edges of the original tree is reduced to approximately 3% using TreeRePair on the first-child next-sibling encoding of the XML tree .\nOther available grammar-based tree compressors are BPLEX 0 and CluX .\nIt is also known that for every forest with n𝑛n nodes one can construct in linear time an FSLP of size 𝒪​(n​log⁡|Σ|/log⁡n)𝒪𝑛Σ𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n\\log|\\Sigma|/\\log n)\n(so 𝒪​(n/log⁡n)𝒪𝑛𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n/\\log n) for a fixed ΣΣ\\Sigma)\n9.\nFinally, notice that FSLPs generalize string SLPs (only use the horizontal concatenation ⊖⊖\\mathbin{\\varominus}). Main result: The following is a preliminary statement of our main result.\nUpper bounds refer to data complexity. For an MSO-query ψ​(X)𝜓𝑋\\psi(X) with a free set variable X𝑋X and a forest straight-line program D𝐷D one can compute in preprocessing time 𝒪​(|D|)𝒪𝐷\\mathcal{O}(|D|) a data structure that allows to enumerate with output-linear delay all S⊆𝗇𝗈𝖽𝖾𝗌(⟦D⟧)S\\subseteq\\mathsf{nodes}(\\llbracket D\\rrbracket) such that ⟦D⟧⊧Ψ(S)\\llbracket D\\rrbracket\\models\\Psi(S). The MSO-query ψ​(X)𝜓𝑋\\psi(X) will be represented by a tree automaton 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} (for an automaton model that is equivalent to MSO on unranked forests).\nWe first reduce the enumeration problem from Theorem 1.1 to the following enumeration problem for\nbinary trees: given a DAG D𝐷D that represents a binary node-labelled tree T𝑇T and a deterministic bottom-up tree automaton ℬℬ\\mathcal{B}, enumerate\nall subsets S⊆𝗅𝖾𝖺𝗏𝖾𝗌​(T)𝑆𝗅𝖾𝖺𝗏𝖾𝗌𝑇S\\subseteq\\mathsf{leaves}(T) such that ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} accepts the tree (T,S)𝑇𝑆(T,S) (obtained by marking all leaves from S𝑆S with a 111). This enumeration problem is then instantiated by the FSLP D𝐷D (a DAG) and the forest algebra parse tree T𝑇T represented by D𝐷D.\nThe nodes of the forest ⟦D⟧delimited-⟦⟧𝐷\\llbracket D\\rrbracket uniquely correspond to the leaves of T𝑇T (see Figures 1 and 2).\nThe bottom-up tree automaton ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} is obtained from the automaton 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}\nusing a known construction 6.\nSince T𝑇T is a binary tree, we could enumerate all sets S⊆𝗅𝖾𝖺𝗏𝖾𝗌​(T)𝑆𝗅𝖾𝖺𝗏𝖾𝗌𝑇S\\subseteq\\mathsf{leaves}(T) such that ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} accepts (T,S)𝑇𝑆(T,S)\nwith linear preprocessing and output-linear delay by one of the algorithms in the literature, e. g., the one by Bagan .\nBut T𝑇T is given by the DAG D𝐷D and we cannot afford to explicitly construct T𝑇T. Consequently, we have to adapt Bagan’s algorithm in such a way that it can be used directly on DAG-compressed trees, which is our main technical contribution. Related results: Forest algebras have been also used in the context of MSO-enumeration on trees in  6 for the purpose of\nenabling updates of the queried tree in logarithmic time by updating and re-balancing a forest algebra expression for the tree (see Appendix I.2 for more details). However no compression is achieved in  6. Working with a DAG-representation of a forest algebra expression (i.e., an FSLP) is a new aspect of our work and requires new algorithmic techniques. We discuss in Section 8 (and Appendix I in more detail) the possibilities and difficulties for also supporting updates in a compressed setting. The arguably most simple way of compressing a tree is to fold it into a DAG. In the context of database theory, this type of compression has been investigated in 6  for XPath and monadic datalog queries, but the enumeration perspective is not investigated. Moreover, the simple DAG-compression has other disadvantages in comparison to the grammar-based approach. In general, DAG-compression can achieve exponential compression, but there are also trees non-compressible by DAGs, but still exponentially compressible by FSLPs,\ne. g., unary trees of the form f​(f​(…​f​(a)​…))𝑓𝑓…𝑓𝑎…f(f(\\ldots f(a)\\ldots)). The experimental study of  also shows that in a practical setting DAG-compression cannot compete with grammar-based tree compression.\nFurther work on the compression performance of DAGs for XML can be found in  . Our work can also be seen as extending the results of   [ref]34 to the case of MSO queries on trees, instead of regular spanners on text documents. In this regard, we also provide an alternative proof for the result that regular spanners can be enumerated with linear preprocessing and constant delay over SLP-compressed texts [ref]34 (the latter uses so-called\nenumerable compact sets with shifts). In addition to Bagan’s algorithm, there are also other enumeration algorithms for MSO queries over uncompressed trees 4 5. However, Bagan’s algorithm seems to be the one that can be extended the best to the compressed setting.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: several fundamental problems are known with this behaviour, e. g., string pattern matching .
