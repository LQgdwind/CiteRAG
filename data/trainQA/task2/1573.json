Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE).\nCTDE is a popular paradigm  which allows for the learning process to utilize additional state information . Agents are trained in a centralized way, i.e., learning algorithms, to access all local action observation histograms, global states, and sharing gradients and parameters. In the execution stage, each individual agent can only access its local action observation history τisuperscript𝜏𝑖\\tau^{i}. QMIX and Monotonicity Constraint. To resolve the credit assignment problem in multi-agent learning, QMIX  learns a joint action-value function Qt​o​tsubscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡Q_{tot} which can be represented in Eq. 2: where ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi is the trainable parameter of the monotonic mixing network, which is a mixing network with monotonicity constraint , and θisuperscript𝜃𝑖\\theta^{i} is the parameter of the agent network i𝑖i. Benefiting from the monotonicity constraint in Eq. LABEL:sections:Q_total_2, maximizing joint Qt​o​tsubscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡Q_{tot} is precisely the equivalent of maximizing individual Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i}, resulting in and allowing for optimal individual action to maintain consistency with optimal joint action. QMIX learns by sampling a multitude of transitions from the replay buffer and minimizing the mean squared temporal-difference (TD) error loss: where the TD target value y=r+γ​maxu′⁡Qt​o​t​(s′,u′;θ−,ϕ−)𝑦𝑟𝛾subscriptsuperscript𝑢′subscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡superscript𝑠′superscript𝑢′superscript𝜃superscriptitalic-ϕy=r+\\gamma\\max_{u^{\\prime}}Q_{tot}\\left(s^{\\prime},u^{\\prime};\\theta^{-},\\phi^{-}\\right) and θ−superscript𝜃\\theta^{-}, ϕ−superscriptitalic-ϕ\\phi^{-} are the target network parameters copied periodically from the current network and kept constant for a number of iterations. However, the monotonicity constraint limits the mixing network’s expressiveness, which may fail to learn in non-monotonic cases  . Table 1 shows a non-monotonic matrix game that violates the monotonicity constraint. This game requires both robots to select the first action 0 (actions are indexed from top to bottom, left to right) in order to catch the reward 12; if only one robot selects action 0, the reward is -12. QMIX may learn an incorrect Qt​o​tsubscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡Q_{tot} which has an incorrect argmax action as shown in Table 1.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: Dec-POMDP.
