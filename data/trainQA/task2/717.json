      "content": "Paper Title: Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning for Functional Split Control in Energy Harvesting Virtualized Small Cells\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs a result of dense deployment of BSs combined with the increasing importance of energy sustainability, intelligent energy management in EH BSs has been the focus of many recent studies. Most of this literature analyzes hierarchical multi-tier networks, the so called HetNets, with an intelligent switching on/off scheduling of BSs. The authors in  apply dynamic programming (DP) to determine the optimal switch on/off policy in a two-tier HetNet with baseline MBS and hot-spot deployed SBSs. The solution shows the performance bound of an intelligent switch on/off policy when all the system dynamics information are known a-priori. Minimizing the grid energy consumption for hybrid powered BSs is also studied in . Here, the authors apply two-stage DP designed to achieve energy saving gains while maintaining the probability of blocking. The authors in [ref]15 study sleep mode coordination between BSs powered by EH and grid energy using DP. However, the DP-based solution is shown to entail high computational complexity. The authors in  apply a ski-rental framework based on-line algorithm for optimal switch on/off scheduling for minimizing the operational costs of a network composed of self-powered BSs. The application of QL for the optimization of an EH system is studied in . The authors in [ref]18 apply distributed QL in the context of HetNets to optimize the harvested energy utilization. Multi-armed bandit based distributed learning is applied in   to allow each SBS to learn its own energy-efficient policy. The authors in  [ref]22 apply layered learning for system wide harvested energy allocation through decomposition of the problem into two layers. The first layer, based on RL, is in charge of local control at each SC, while the second layer, based on neural networks, ensures network wide coordination among the SCs. The authors in  applied deep RL methods for the minimization of energy consumption in HetNets through optimal activation of a subset of the SCs, while maintaining the desired level of QoS. In particular, they have applied actor-critic RL methods where deep neural networks are used as policy and value function approximators. The authors in  proposed a RL-based energy controller for a SC powered by EH, battery and smart grid by considering battery ageing effects. This work is based on FQL and is shown to provide significant extension to the life time of a small cell battery. Renewable energy allocation in edge computing devices with EH is studied in . Here, the authors propose RL-based online solutions for offloading and auto-scaling in edge computing devices that are powered by EH. RL based algorithms for dynamic placement of functional split options is proposed in . It is based on temporal difference (TD) learning methods, namely QL and SARSA for online learning of control policies of a vSC powered by EH with flexible operative modes. On the other hand, the authors in  propose an optimal flexible functional split option selection scheme for a cloud RAN with radio remote units supplied by renewable energy sources. They show that the optimal functional split selection problem can be formulated as convex optimization, and propose a heuristic online algorithm without relying on future energy arrival information. However, the study in  focuses only on throughput maximization for a single remote radio unit. Indeed, most of the literature on EH with MEC focus on a single SC scenario, and the literature on multiple SCs consider only on/off switching policies. Here, we study more configuration options of SCs, in addition to switch on/off and enable higher grid energy savings. In , we propose a MRL solution for the dynamic control of functional split options ensuring scalable solutions. In particular, it is based on distributed tabular RL algorithms, i.e., QL and FQL. This paper extends the work in  by proposing a multi-agent DRL solution that overcomes the limitations of tabular MRL approaches. We propose coordinated control via communication of battery level information among multiple learning agents and a common system wide reward signal. Moreover, we tailor distributed DRL algorithm to our network scenario and evaluate its performance against a benchmark multi-agent FQL controller studied in .\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: consumption for hybrid powered BSs is also studied in .
