      "content": "Paper Title: Concurrent Reference Counting and Resource Management in Constant Time\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we are interested in the management of concurrently shared resources, and in particular in safely destructing them. Resources can include memory, file pointers, communication channels, unique labels, operating system resources, or any resource that needs to be constructed and destructed, and can be accessed concurrently by many threads. The problem being addressed is that when a handle to a resource is stored in a shared location, there can be an unsafe race between a thread that reads the handle (often a pointer) and then accesses its content, and a thread that clears the location and then destructs the content. Such read-destruct races are a common issue in the design of concurrent software. In the context of allocating and freeing memory blocks, the problem has been referred to as the memory reclamation problem¬†  , the repeat offender problem¬†, and read-reclaim races¬†. Elsewhere, read-destruct races come up in managing reference counts¬†, OS resources¬†, and multiversioning¬†. Read-destruct races can be addressed by placing a lock around the reads and destructs, but this comes with all the standard issues with locks. To avoid locks, many lock-free methods have been suggested and are widely used, including read copy update (RCU)¬†, epochs¬†, hazard-pointers¬†, pass-the-buck¬†, interval-based reclamation¬†, and others¬†6 . RCU is implemented in the Linux operating system, and McKenney et. al. point out that it is used in over 6500 places, largely to protect against read-destruct races¬†. Epoch-based reclamation and hazard pointers are also widely used for memory management in concurrent data structure¬†¬†[33, Chapter¬†7.2] to protect against read-destruct races. Our contribution is to solve the read-destruct problem in a constant time (expected) wait-free manner‚Äîthat is to say that both the read sections and the destructs can be implemented safely with expected constant time overhead. Furthermore, our solution is memory efficient, only requires single-word CAS, and ensures timely destruction.\nOur solution is expected rather than worst-case constant time because each process uses a local hash table. Specifically, we support a acquire-retire interface consisting of four operations: acquire, release, retire, and eject. An acquire takes a pointer to a location containing a resource handle, reads the handle and protects the resource, returning the handle. A later paired release, releases the protection. A retire follows an update on a location containing a resources handle, and is applied to the handle that is overwritten to indicate the resource is no longer needed. A later paired eject will return the resource handle indicating it is now safe to destruct the resource (i.e. it is no longer protected). This definition is illustrated in Figure 1. We allow the same handle to be retired multiple times concurrently, each paired with its own eject. This is useful in our reference counting collector where the destruct is a decrement of the reference count.\nAll operations are linearizable¬†, i.e., must appear to be atomic.\nSection¬†2.1 compares the acquire-retire interface to similar interfaces. As an example, Figure¬†2 defines a structure for protecting a resource based on acquire-retire, and uses it for redirecting a file stream. The use function wraps a function call (on fùëìf) in an acquire-retire, while the redirect overwrites the value of the resource. A thread (other) uses the stream concurrently while the main thread redirects the stream. Without acquire-retire, there is a read-destruct race that would allow other to write to a stream that has already been closed. Here, the retire binds a function (the destructor) that is applied when ejected. Protecting a Resource Example Use The acquire-retire interface can be implemented using hazard pointers¬† or pass-the-buck¬†. With these approaches, however, the acquire is only lock-free. In particular after installing\nthe value read from the handle location into a hazard slot, it is necessary to go back and check that the location has not been\nupdated, and repeat if it has.\nEpoch-based reclamation can be used to support the operations in constant time, it provides no bound on the number of delayed retires. We say a retire-eject pair is delayed between the retire and the eject. In this paper we describe an efficient implementation of acquire-retire, which gives the following results. Result 1¬†(Acquire-Retire): \n\nFor an arbitrary number of resources and locations, PùëÉP processes, and at most cùëêc resources protected on each process at a given time, the acquire-retire interface can be supported using: O‚Äã(1)ùëÇ1O(1) time for acquire, release, and retire, O‚Äã(1)ùëÇ1O(1) expected time for eject, O‚Äã(c‚ÄãP2)ùëÇùëêsuperscriptùëÉ2O(cP^{2}) space overhead and O‚Äã(c‚ÄãP2)ùëÇùëêsuperscriptùëÉ2O(cP^{2}) delayed retires, and single-word (at least pointer-width) read, write and CAS. For the space and delayed resources bounds, we assume that every retire comes with at least one eject. We note that O‚Äã(1)ùëÇ1O(1) time for each operation is stronger than wait-free since wait-free only guarantees finite time.\nAlso, for NùëÅN resources and P‚àào‚Äã(N)ùëÉùëúùëÅP\\in o(\\sqrt{N}), the space overhead is a low order term compared to the space for the resources themselves. Limiting ourselves to pointer-width words implies that we do not use unbounded counters.\nSuch counters are used in many other non-blocking data structures to avoid the ABA problem¬† 1. We know of no previous solution that is constant (expected or worst-case) time, bounded space, and does not use much more powerful primitives.\nOur results make use of recent results on atomic copy¬†[ref]3.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: We know of no previous solution that is constant (expected or worst-case) time, bounded space, and does not use much more powerful primitives.\nOur results make use of recent results on atomic copy¬†[ref]3.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
