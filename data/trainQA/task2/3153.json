      "content": "Paper Title: BCD Nets: Scalable Variational Approaches for Bayesian Causal Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe study our model‚Äôs performance in the low-data regime, with n=100ùëõ100n=100 data points. We expect that when there is little data, the maximum-likelihood DAG may not be particularly representative of the DAGs that could have plausibly made the data, and so a Bayesian approach which can assign posterior density to multiple candidates may correctly identify more edges.\nIn this experiment, we draw Erd≈ës-Renyi graphs¬† with average degree equal to 1 or 2, denoted ER1 and ER2. The weights are generated uniformly in {‚àí2,‚àí0.5}‚à™{0.5,2}20.50.52\\left\\{-2,-0.5\\right\\}\\cup\\left\\{0.5,2\\right\\} following¬†.\nThe data is generated in the equal-variance case so that the ground-truth is identifiable and the SHD is meaningful. We evaluate with Gaussian noise as well as with Gumbel noise to test how our method behaves under a misspecified likelihood. The distribution over the weights also induces some misspecification, since the weights are not drawn from the modelled prior of a horseshoe. We compare against GOLEM¬†, which attempts to find the maximum-likelihood solution of equation¬†(1) using the continuous relaxation introduced in¬†[ref]62. We found that the hyperparameters given by the authors did not lead to optimal performance with low data, so we found the best ones via a cross-validation scheme given in appendix B. We also include results from GADGET [ref]58, a recent highly-optimized state-of-the-art Monte Carlo method for Bayesian causal discovery for DAGs, using 300,000 iterations with 48 parallel chains. To compare against a baseline that is widely used in practice, we also evaluate the DirectLiNGAM method¬†, designed for non-Gaussian likelihoods. Also included are two methods designed specifically for Gaussian DAGs, the greedy directed acyclic graph search with equal error variance (GDSEEV) method , and the main method (‚ÄòGhoshal‚Äô) from . For the latter, we were unable to find an implementation by the authors and used our own implementation.\nWe use the equal-variance formulations of GOLEM and BCD Nets. Results are shown in figure¬†2. The null baseline is a method that simply predicts no edges.\nWe observe that we reliably obtain significantly lower SHD than MLE approaches, especially at higher dùëëd and degree where we tend to recover a significant fraction of the edges.\nFor example, in the Gaussian noise case with average degree 2, for dimension 64 we get an SHD of 59¬±14plus-or-minus591459\\pm 14 compared to GOLEM‚Äôs 205¬±30plus-or-minus20530205\\pm 30.\nThis corresponds to double the true positive rate while having a false discovery rate one-third of GOLEM‚Äôs.\nWe give full plots of the true positive rate, false positive rate and false discovery rates in the appendix, Section¬†D.1.\nThe Bayesian GADGET method also obtains better results than MLE methods, with BCD Nets‚Äô match to this exact sampling method suggesting that our approach finds a variational posterior close to the real posterior.\nCompared to GADGET, our method is generally faster (see table 2) and gives an explicit parametric form for the posterior, instead of simply giving samples. Furthermore, the ELBO is a natural metric to evaluate convergence, while for GADGET it is unclear how many iterations are required to mix333An earlier version of this paper reported worse SHDs for GADGET after using 50,000 steps. Increasing the number of iterations by 6 times resulted in much better mixing. DirectLiNGAM is competitive on the Gumbel likelihood, fitting its linear non-Gaussian framework.\n\nReference markers found: [62]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]62: are not drawn from the modelled prior of a horseshoe.
