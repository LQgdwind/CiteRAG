      "content": "Paper Title: High-Level ETL for Semantic Data Warehouses—Full VersionThis journal paper is submitted to Semantic Web – Interoperability, Usability, Applicability an IOS Press Journal\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSemantic Web technologies enable adding a semantic layer over the data; thus, the data can be processed and effectively retrieved by both humans and machines. The Linked Data (LD) principles are the set of standard rules to publish and connect data using semantic links . With the growing popularity of the SW and LD, more and more organizations natively manage data using SW standards, such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), RDF-Schema (RDFs), the Web Ontology Language (OWL), etc. . Moreover, one can easily convert data given in another format (database, XML, JSON, etc.) into RDF format using an RDF wrapper. As a result, a lot of semantic datasets are now available in different data portals, such as DataHub111https://datahub.io/, Linked Open Data Cloud 222https://lod-cloud.net/ (LOD), etc. Most SW data provided by international and governmental organizations include facts and figures, which give rise to new requirements for Business Intelligence (BI) tools to enable analyses in the style of Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) over those semantic data . OLAP is a well-recognized technology to support decision making by analyzing data integrated from multiple sources. The integrated data are stored in a Data Warehouse (DW), typically structured following the Multidimensional Model (MD) that represents data in terms of facts and dimensions to enable OLAP queries. The integration process for extracting data from different sources, translating it according to the underlying semantics of the DW, and loading it into the DW is known as Extract-Transform-Load (ETL). One way to enable OLAP analysis over semantic data is by extracting those data and translating them according to the DW’s format using a traditional ETL process.  outlines such a type of semi-automatic method to integrate semantic data into a traditional RDBMS-centric MD DW. However, the process does not maintain all the semantics of data as they are conveying in the semantic sources; hence the integrated data no more follow the SW data principles defined in . The semantics of the data in a semantic data source is defined by 1) using Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRIs) to uniquely identify resources globally, 2) providing common terminology, 3) semantically linking with published information, and 4) providing further knowledge (e.g., logical axioms) to allow reasoning . Therefore, considering semantic issues in the integration process should be emphasized. Moreover, initiatives such as Open Government Data333https://opengovdata.org/ encourage organizations to publish their data using standards and non-proprietary formats . The integration of semantic data into a DW raises the challenges of schema derivation, semantic heterogeneity, semantic annotation, linking as well as the schema and data management system over traditional DW technologies and ETL tools. The main drawback of a state-of-the-art Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)-based DW is that it is strictly schema dependent and less flexible to evolving business requirements. To cover new business requirements, every step of the development cycle needs to be updated to cope with the new requirements. This update process is time-consuming as well as costly and is sometimes not adjustable with the current setup of the DW; hence it introduces the need for a novel approach. The limitations of traditional ETL tools to process semantic data sources are: (1) they do not fully support semantic-aware data, (2) they are entirely schema dependent (i.e., cannot handle data expressed without pre-defined schema), (3) they do not focus on meaningful semantic relationships to integrate data from disparate sources, and (4) they neither support to capture the semantics of data nor support to derive new information by active inference and reasoning on the data. Semantic Web technologies address the problems described above, as they allow adding semantics at both data and schema level in the integration process and publish data in RDF using the LD principles. On the SW, the RDF model is used to manage and exchange data, and RDFS and OWL are used in combination with the RDF data model to define constraints that data must meet. Moreover, QB [ref]8 and QB4OLAP  vocabularies can be used to define data with MD semantics. 0 refers to an MD DW that is semantically annotated both at the schema and data level as a Semantic DW (SDW). An SDW is based on the assumption that the schema can evolve and be extended without affecting the existing structure. Hence, it overcomes the problems triggered by the evolution of an RDBMS-based data warehousing system. In 0, we proposed SETL (throughout this present paper, we call it SETLPROG), a programmable semantic ETL framework that semantically integrates both semantic and non-semantic data sources. In SETLPROG, an ETL developer has to create hand-code specific modules to deal with semantic data. Thus, there is a lack of a well-defined set of basic ETL constructs that allow developers having a higher level of abstraction and more control in creating their ETL process. In this paper, we propose a strong foundation for an RDF-based semantic integration process and a set of high-level ETL constructs that allows defining, mapping, processing, and integrating semantic data. The unique contributions of this paper are: We structure the integration process into two layers: Definition Layer and Execution Layer. Different to SETL or other ETL tools, here, we propose a new paradigm: the ETL flow transformations are characterized once and for all at the Definition Layer instead of independently within each ETL operation (in the Execution Layer). This is done by generating a mapping file that gives an overall view of the integration process. This mapping file is our primary metadata source, and it will be fed (by either the ETL developer or the automatic ETL execution flow generation process) to the ETL operations, orchestrated in the ETL flow (Execution Layer), to parametrize themselves automatically. Thus, we are unifying the creation of the required metadata to automate the ETL process in the Definition layer. We propose an OWL-based Source-To-target Mapping (S2TMAP) vocabulary to express the source-to-target mappings. We provide a set of high-level ETL constructs for each layer. The Definition Layer includes constructs for target schema444Here, we use the terms “target” and “MD SDW” interchangeably. definition, source schema derivation, and source-to-target mappings generation. The Execution Layer includes a set of high-level ETL operations for semantic data extraction, cleansing, joining, MD data creation, linking, inferencing, and for dimensional data update. We propose an approach to automate the ETL execution flows based on metadata generated in the Definition Layer. We create a prototype SETLCONSTRUCT, based on the innovative ETL constructs proposed here. SETLCONSTRUCT allows creating ETL flows by dragging, dropping, and connecting the ETL operations. In addition, it allows creating ETL data flows automatically (we call it SETLAUTO). We perform a comprehensive experimental evaluation by producing an MD SDW that integrates an EU farm Subsidy dataset and a Danish Business dataset. The evaluation shows that SETLCONSTRUCT improves considerably over SET- LPROG in terms of productivity, development time, and performance. In summary: 1) SETLCONSTRUCT uses 92% fewer NOTC than SETLPROG, and SETLAUTO further reduces NOUC by another 25%; 2) usingSETLCONSTRUCT, the development time is almost cut in half compared to SETLPROG, and is cut by another 27% using SETLAUTO; 3) SETLCONSTRUCT is scalable and has similar performance compared to SETLPROG. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We discuss the terminologies and the notations used throughout the paper in Section 2. Section 3 explains the structure of the datasets we use as a use case. Section 4 gives the overview of an integration process. The description of the Definition Layer and Execution Layer constructs are given in Sections 5 and  6, respectively. Section 7 presents the automatic ETL execution flow generation process. In Section 8, we create an MD SDW for the use case using SETLCONSTRUCT and compare the process with SETLPROG using different metrics. The previous research related to our study is discussed in Section 9. Finally, we conclude and give pointers to future work in Section 10.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: LD principles.
