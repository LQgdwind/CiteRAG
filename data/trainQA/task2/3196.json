      "content": "Paper Title: A Style and Semantic Memory Mechanism for Domain GeneralizationThis work was performed at JD AI Research.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDomain Adaptation (DA) algorithms aim to exploit both annotated training data in the source domain and unlabeled samples in the target domain. Mainstream DA approaches     0 usually penalize distributional misalignment between source and target data via, e.g., maximum mean discrepancy loss   or adversarial loss   8. Given the success of DA algorithms, multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods 3  2 consider scenarios where multiple sources are available for training to better improve generalization. Domain Generalization (DG) algorithms also assume access to multiple labeled training source domains. However, target data is unavailable during training for DG approaches, leading to a more challenging yet a more practical setting than DA problems. Many early DG approaches    borrowed the idea of distribution alignment from DA to reduce the distributional gap between multiple training sources. Some recent DG methods consider generating extra synthetic images given the multiple source domains, so that test data distributed closely to the training data are “in-distribution” with the training data    3. Some methods decompose the network parameters into domain-specific and domain-invariant parts during training, while only the domain-invariant parameters are used for predictions at test time. For instance, 8 develops a low-rank parameterized CNN model where each layer of the network is decomposed into “common” and “specific” components. In 4, only the last layer of the network is decomposed to serve the goal of DG. Several normalization and meta-learning strategies are also considered for domain generalization such as 9 9 5. Contrastive Learning has shown impressive performance in the context of self-supervised learning  0 5 [ref]27   1. Representative contrastive learning 5 proposed efficient memory bank constructions so that the historical features are conveniently stored and reused even if batchsize is small. We feel inspired from these approaches 5 where the memory bank help retain temporal consistency between features, and we introduce such a memory mechanism to best facilitate our motivations. However, our approach is neither targeting a pre-train task nor an unsupervised learning problem, in contrast to 0 5 . Rather, we look into DG problems and we aim to learn the desired feature invariances respecting our unique hypothesis. We notice a related contrastive learning method in [ref]27, that enforces a particular prediction regularizer across augmentations to improve in-class consistency. We argue that the work in [ref]27 is an unsupervised algorithm that completely distinguishes its nature from our DG task, while the loss proposed here also leads to an entirely different interpretation and application. We observe that existing DG methods along the decomposition path either: hinge on inter-domain semantic invariance features assumption, so that the network becomes agnostic to styles; or they rely on style decomposition approaches to synthesize more data. In contrast, our proposed method enjoys two exclusive novel assumptions: 1. We are the first to impose instance level intra-domain style invariance during the training. Having these domain-specific style features at hand, we effectively reduce the degree of freedom of the problem in further learning the useful semantic features. 2. We design a novel “jury” mechanism that is different from any existing DG method, which achieves significant improvement in domain generalization.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: and meta-learning strategies are also considered for domain generalization such as 9 9 5.
