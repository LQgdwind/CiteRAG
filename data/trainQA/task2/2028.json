      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Sign Language Translation with Monolingual Data by Sign Back-Translation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSign Language Recognition.\nSign language recognition (SLR) includes two sub-tasks: isolated SLR and continuous SLR.\nWhile isolated SLR aims to recognize one sign from a trimmed video, continuous SLR tries to recognize an ordered sign gloss sequence from a continuous video.\nEarly works in isolated SLR utilize hand-crafted features   for sign description.\nWith the success of deep learning, 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) [ref]6   achieve favorable performance on action related tasks [ref]6.\nIt inspires more research groups to study continuous SLR with large-scale vocabulary   .\nTo enable end-to-end training, connectionist temporal classification (CTC)  is widely adopted by continuous SLR models     .\nWith the development of neural machine translation, Camgöz et al.formulate a new task, neural sign language translation (SLT) [ref]10, which is becoming an active and promising direction  5. Sign Language Translation.\nSLT is different from SLR mainly in the aspect of sequence learning.\nThe encoder-decoder based methods  8  are adopted to process the difference in word order and vocabulary between sign language and spoken language.\nIn [ref]10, Camgöz et al.propose an SLT dataset PHOENIX-2014T and provide spoken language annotations.\nThey use attention-based encoder-decoder models to learn how to translate from spatial representations or sign glosses.\nRecently, transformer networks  have been popular for neural machine translation (NMT).\nCamgöz et al.  apply transformers into sequence learning of sign language. Their work explores the multi-task formulation of continuous SLR and SLT.\nUnder transformer framework, Li et al. 5 explore the hierarchical structure in sign video representation.\nBesides, some works  4 improve the SLT framework by considering the multi-cue characteristic of sign language. Monolingual Data Exploration.\nThe integration of monolingual data for neural machine translation (NMT) models is first investigated in .\nGulcehre  et al.train the NMT model independently and use a language model from monolingual data for re-scoring during the decoding process.\nTo introduce monolingual data in model training, Sennrich et al.propose a back-translation approach  to generate synthetic parallel data for training without changing the encoder-decoder structure.\nIn , sentences with blank facetracks are utilized to enhance the decoder of lip reading.\nDifferent from previous work, we design a sign back-translation mechanism across domains of video and language, which brings state-of-the-art results in SLT datasets and new insight to approach SLT. Sign Language Dataset.\nHigh-quality datasets are essential in promoting sign language research.\nA summary of publicly available datasets for video-based sign language research is presented in Table 1.\nThe majority of them are composed of word-level sign videos.\nTo achieve continuous SLR evaluation, some datasets provide gloss-level annotations  3 .\nAlthough German translations are provided in SIGNUM, it is not appropriate for SLT tasks, due to its limited vocabulary and sentences.\nHence, PHOENIX-2014T [ref]10 becomes the only suitable dataset for SLT research  5.\nHowever, the frames in 3 are cropped from a specific TV program of the weather forecast and thus in a low resolution.\nIt constrains the exploration of language model and sign language generation in hand details.\nAs a considerable complement,\nour CSL-Daily contains over 20K 1080P sign videos.\nIt provides both gloss and translation annotations and covers diverse topics of daily lives.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: sequence from a continuous video.\nEarly works in isolated SLR utilize hand-crafted features   for sign description.\nWith the success of deep learning, 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) [ref]6   achieve favorable performance on action related tasks [ref]6.\nIt inspires more research groups to study continuous SLR with large-scale vocabulary   .\nTo enable end-to-end training,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
