      "content": "Paper Title: Reducing Language Biases in Visual Question Answering with Visually-Grounded Question Encoder\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFeature extraction: In all our experiments, we use the fixed-sized (36) object-level image features provided by  as V𝑉V (dv=2048subscript𝑑𝑣2048d_{v}=2048). These features are obtained from Faster-RCNN  trained on Visual Genome 4, with ResNet-101  as the backbone. We did not fine-tune the image features.\nWe use the pre-trained Glove  word-embeddings (trained on “Common Crawl”) to extract the object-label and question word features (dw=300subscript𝑑𝑤300d_{w}=300). If the object-label contains two words, we take the sum of the word-embeddings of the individual words as the word-embedding vector. We use a similar question pre-processing as in [ref]7, such as lower-case transformation, removing punctuation, etc. If a question word is not there in the Glove word embedding vocabulary, we use the word embedding of its synonym or other words that give the same meaning. Model parameters: Inside VGQE, we use a Bi-directional GRU with a hidden state dimension of 102410241024 as the RNN cell. We use the fine-tuned question word embedding dimension, d=512𝑑512d=512. In the BLOCK fusion, we use a similar setting as in [ref]7, which consists of 15 chunks, each of rank 15, the dimension of the projection space is 100010001000, and the output dimension is 204820482048. Dataset and training: We use the VQA-CPv2 dataset [ref]1 to train and evaluate the language-bias reduction capacity of the models. We also use the VQAv2 dataset to train and evaluate the models on the standard VQA benchmark. For both VQA-CPv2 and VQAv2, we consider the most frequent 3000 answers as the answer vocabulary as in prior works [ref]1  [ref]7 and the evaluation metric used is the VQA accuracy . We also use the questions from Visual Genome 4 that matches the answer vocabulary, following the prior works  2.\nWe train the models using the Adamw 5 optimizer with w​e​i​g​h​t​d​e​c​a​y=2∗10−5𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑦2superscript105weightdecay=2*10^{-5} and cross-entropy loss.\nFor the baseline model, we set the initial learning rate as 3.5×10−43.5superscript1043.5\\times 10^{-4} and linearly increase it by a factor of 0.250.250.25 till epoch 11. Then we decay the learning rate by a factor of 0.250.250.25 with a step size of 2. For the BAN baseline, we used an initial learning rate of 2×10−42superscript1042\\times 10^{-4} and followed the same scheduling algorithm as above. For the UpDn baseline, we fixed the learning rate as 2×10−42superscript1042\\times 10^{-4} and used the Binary-Cross entropy loss. We use gradient clipping with a norm threshold as 0.250.250.25. We use a batch size of 128 and dropout value as 0.20.20.2. For implementing all the models, we use the PyTorch 9 deep-learning framework.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: If the object-label contains two words, we take the sum of the word-embeddings of the individual words as the word-embedding vector. We use a similar question pre-processing as in [ref]7, such as lower-case transformation, removing punctuation, etc. If a question word is not there in the Glove word embedding vocabulary, we use the word embedding of its synonym or other words\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
