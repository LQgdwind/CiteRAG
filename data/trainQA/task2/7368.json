      "content": "Paper Title: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning with Prior Knowledge\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFew-shot Learning FSL refers to learning knowledge from few-shot training samples, whose data volume is often in single digits [ref]2, [ref]3, , , , , , , . The primary challenge in FSL lies in the unreliability of empirical risk minimization due to very limited sample sizes. Presently, mainstream FSL solutions can be categorized into three types: data augmentation-based approaches , , optimization-based approaches [ref]2, [ref]3, and metric-based approaches , . The data augmentation-based approach is straightforward, as it aims to expand the dataset to provide the model with sufficient knowledge to optimize its parameters. Optimization-based approaches aim at designing networks or algorithms to allow models to be adapted quickly on limited data. The metric-based approaches extract image features by a trained model and select an appropriate metric for image matching. Commonly used metrics include distance metrics, cosine similarity, Deepemd , etc. Our work combines elements of both data augmentation and measurement. Class-incremental Learning CIL is employed to mitigate the issue of catastrophic forgetting induced by the introduction of new classes in data stream , [ref]26, , , , , , , , . Current techniques fall into three main categories: regularization-based methods , , [ref]26, replay-based methods[ref]26, ,  and dynamic network-based methods , , . Regularization methods aim to mitigate the forgetting of old knowledge by introducing constraints into the loss function of the new task, with distillation loss being a common constraint. The replay approach involves retaining some old data to create an example set alongside the new dataset. The example set can be optimized using strategies like herd selection and balancing. Dynamic networks allocate specific parameters to different tasks, allowing the avoidance of forgetting old knowledge when new data arrives by expanding the feature extraction model or classification head. Some recent work has also emerged that addresses CIL from the perspective of pre-trained models. It has been proven that strong pre-trained models can achieve better performance in downstream tasks . Some recent work has also emerged that addresses CIL from the perspective of pre-trained models. In , Wu et al. trains 800 base classes in the pre-training phase to improve the representational ability of the model, while a large amount of base class knowledge provided a more general feature extractor for the subsequent incremental phase. Few-shot Class-incremental Learning FSCIL is recently proposed for solving the problem of scenarios with a small number of samples in CIL. Tao et al.  proposes a Topology-Preserving Knowledge InCrementer (TOPIC) framework to address the problem of forgetting old knowledge and learning new samples by using neural gases. In Deep-EMD , a new perspective from optimal matching between image regions is used to develop a shot-less image classification method. To adopt this approach, Zhang et al. designs a cross-referencing mechanism that effectively mitigates the adverse effects of background clutter and large variations in intra-class appearance. In semantic-aware knowledge distillation for FSCIL 0, Cheraghian et al. introduces word vectors of new classes and uses embedding and attention modules to solve the semantic mapping problem for completing the learning of new classes with few-shot. CEC 1 introduces a graph attention model, combined with incremental learning. They get promising results by the algorithm updating only the parameters of the classification head during the incremental learning process. In , Ji et al. proposes a Memorizing Complementation Network (MCNet) to ensemble multiple models that complement the different memorized knowledge with each other for novel classes. Semi-supervised Learning SSL aims to enhance the performance of a model by utilizing readily available unlabeled data in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data , 2, , 3, 4. SSL is typically implemented in two main approaches: consistency regularization , 2, , 3 and pseudo-labeling 4,  (also known as self-training). The fundamental concept behind consistency regularization is that when two inputs exhibit similarity in the input space, their outputs should also display similarity. This encourages the model to maintain consistency within the input space. On the other hand, pseudo-labeling involves using a model trained on labeled data to predict unlabeled data and assign pseudo-labels. Subsequently, the pseudo-labeled data is employed to augment the original dataset, contributing to the model’s updates.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Few-shot Learning FSL refers to learning knowledge from few-shot training samples, whose data volume is often in single digits [ref]2, [ref]3, , , , , , , .
