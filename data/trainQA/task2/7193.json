      "content": "Paper Title: A Heterogeneous RISC-V based SoC for Secure Nano-UAV Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this subsection, we focus on two real-world 8-bit QNNs fine-tuned for Nano-UAVs application scenarios, namely Tiny-PULP-Dronet [ref]2 and FrontNet , as well as two aggressively quantized mixed-precision QNNs for object detection and classification.\nThe Tiny-PULP-Dronet is a lightweigth QNN based on the ResNet architecture  and it enables autonomous navigation within tight spaces avoiding obstacle collision.\nFrontNet on the other hand is based on the MobileNet architecture and it is used for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI): it allows the nano-drone to recognize a face and follow it.\nThe cluster is able to achieve 320FPS on a Tiny-PULP-Dronet and 260FPS on an optimized 6.7MMAC FrontNet, which is well above the 20FPS needed to achieve autonomous flight [ref]2 .\nThis means that more than 90%percent9090\\% of the cluster’s computational capabilities are actually available to carry out other activities. Stemming the analysis from the QNNs mentioned below, we first benchmark the cluster on a relatively big (325MMAC) 8-bit MobileNetV1 for object classification.\nThen, we extend the analysis to a mixed-precision MobileNetV1 with 8-bit activations and 4-bit (8b4b) weights and an aggressively quantized 4b2b ResNet-20 for object detection.\nThe two MobileNetV1 networks have been trained on ImageNet while the 4b2b ResNet-20 targets CIFAR10.\nAs table VI shows, reducing the operands’ precision does not automatically jeopardize the accuracy: in the case of the MobileNetV1, there is a 47% memory footprint reduction for a negligible 3% accuracy loss, from 69% to 66% , while the ResNet-20 achieves 90.2%percent90.290.2\\% accuracy .\nAs shown in table VI, Flex-V is the only version of Ri5cy able to efficiently deal with mixed precision networks: in terms of MAC/cycles, on the 4b-2b mixed-precision ResNet-20, it achieves 2.3×\\times and 2.5×\\times of speedup with respect to XPulpNN and XPulpV2.\nTable VI also compares the latency and energy consumed by Shaheen over the three networks when running at the maximum frequency at 0.8V, compared to two other 8-core clusters respectively implementing the baseline XPulpV2 instructions or the XPulpNN, namely GAP9 and Kraken.\nOn the uniform-precision MobileNetV1, thanks to the higher frequency and optimized ISA, Shaheen’s cluster provides the smallest latency, but not the lowest energy, due to higher power consumption (70mW) when compared to GAP9 (50mW), being the latter tuned for energy-efficient operation.\nAs soon as the mixed-precision extensions can be exploited, Shaheen’s cluster emerges both as the fastest and most energy-efficient one.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: In this subsection, we focus on two real-world 8-bit QNNs fine-tuned for Nano-UAVs application scenarios, namely Tiny-PULP-Dronet [ref]2 and FrontNet , as well as two aggressively quantized mixed-precision QNNs for object detection and classification.\nThe Tiny-PULP-Dronet is a lightweigth QNN based on the ResNet architecture\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
