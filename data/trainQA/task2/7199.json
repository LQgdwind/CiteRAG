      "content": "Paper Title: Dr2Net: Dynamic Reversible Dual-Residual Networks for Memory-Efficient Finetuning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo transform a network into a reversible one, recently, Re2TAL [ref]45 proposed to rewire the residual connections of a non-reversible network (Fig. 2 (a)) to obtain a reversible architecture. During its rewiring process, though the basic blocks ℱisubscriptℱ𝑖\\mathcal{F}_{i} are maintained, the macro architecture has a significant change. Consequently, the obtained reversible network is mathematically a different function from the original network , and cannot be directly finetuned from the parameters θnsubscript𝜃𝑛\\theta_{n} of the original network on the downstream task. What if we can maintain the macro architecture during the network transformation?\nActually, initializing network parameters from a different network has been studied in the literature  [ref]2. In I3D  and Frozen [ref]2, researchers attempted to initialize video networks from parameters of pretrained image networks. They adopted a parameter initialization mechanism that makes the video network equivalent to the image network before finetuning by initializing the extra parameters in the video network to certain values. Inspired by these, we propose to transform the architecture with minimum modification, and ensure equivalency between the pretrained network and the downstream network at the beginning of finetuning. To obtain a reversible downstream network, instead of rewiring the residual connections in the original network, we add new residual connections, as illustrated in Fig. 2 (b). Note that since most contemporary networks have residual connections, we illustrate the pretrained architecture ℳnsubscriptℳ𝑛\\mathcal{M}_{n} as a residual network following [ref]45, though our method does not restricted ℳnsubscriptℳ𝑛\\mathcal{M}_{n} to residual networks. At each block ℱisubscriptℱ𝑖\\mathcal{F}_{i}, we add a new residual connection, the pink arrow in Fig. 2 (b), that skips two blocks ℱisubscriptℱ𝑖\\mathcal{F}_{i} and ℱi+1subscriptℱ𝑖1\\mathcal{F}_{i+1}. We replicate the original input x0subscript𝑥0x_{0} as the input to the first new residual connection to form a second pathway. The obtained network is a reversible Dual-Residual Network, DrNet for short, whose reversibility will be detailed later in this section and proved in the appendix. DrNet preserves the original residual connections. However, it still has an architectural discrepancy from the original pretrained network ℳnsubscriptℳ𝑛\\mathcal{M}_{n} due to the newly introduced residual connections (pink arrows). To enable initializing the reversible network to be the equivalent of the pretrained ℳnsubscriptℳ𝑛\\mathcal{M}_{n}, we introduce two coefficients on the two types of residual connections respectively. We use α∈ 𝛼01\\alpha\\in  on the original residual connections (green), and β∈ 𝛽01\\beta\\in  on our newly added residual connections (pink). With these two coefficients, we actually obtain a family of reversible networks with α𝛼\\alpha and β𝛽\\beta set to different values. These two coefficients can be dynamically adjusted during finetuning (see Sec. 3.3), so we call the obtained new architecture Dynamic Reversible Dual-Residual Networks, Dr2Net for short, as illustrated in Fig. 2 (c). We use Dr2Net for downstream finetuning with the parameters θnsubscript𝜃𝑛\\theta_{n} of the pretrained network ℳnsubscriptℳ𝑛\\mathcal{M}_{n} as initialization. When initializing Dr2Net, we make α=1𝛼1\\alpha=1 and β=0𝛽0\\beta=0, such that it becomes exactly the same architecture as the pretrained network ℳnsubscriptℳ𝑛\\mathcal{M}_{n}. In this way, we can seamlessly initialize Dr2Net using the parameters θnsubscript𝜃𝑛\\theta_{n} of the pretrained network ℳnsubscriptℳ𝑛\\mathcal{M}_{n}. When we make α=1𝛼1\\alpha=1 and β=1𝛽1\\beta=1, Dr2Net becomes DrNet above; when we make α=0𝛼0\\alpha=0 and β=1𝛽1\\beta=1, Dr2Net becomes an architecture as in Re2TAL [ref]45. We mathematically formulate the computation of the ithsuperscript𝑖thi^{\\textrm{th}} module in Dr2Net as follows where y0=x0subscript𝑦0subscript𝑥0y_{0}=x_{0}, and 𝒢i​(xi−1)=ℱi​(xi−1)+α×xi−1subscript𝒢𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖1subscriptℱ𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖1𝛼subscript𝑥𝑖1\\mathcal{G}_{i}(x_{i-1})=\\mathcal{F}_{i}(x_{i-1})+\\alpha\\times x_{i-1}. If the pretrained network ℳnsubscriptℳ𝑛\\mathcal{M}_{n} doesn’t have residual connections, α=0𝛼0\\alpha=0. We can observe that this Dr2Net module is reversible as long as β≠0𝛽0\\beta\\neq 0. Its reverse computation is formulated as follows Recall that we need to make β=0𝛽0\\beta=0 to make Dr2Net equivalent to the pretrained network ℳnsubscriptℳ𝑛\\mathcal{M}_{n}, which conflicts the β≠0𝛽0\\beta\\neq 0 requirement here. We will discuss this in Sec. 3.3. Due to the reversibility of each module, all the intermediate activations xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} and yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i} can be reconstructed from the output, and hence don’t need to be cached in memory [ref]45  7.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: To transform a network into a reversible one, recently, Re2TAL [ref]45 proposed to rewire the residual connections of a non-reversible network (Fig. 2 (a)) to obtain a reversible architecture.
