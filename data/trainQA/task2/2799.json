      "content": "Paper Title: On the Impact of Stable Ranks in Deep Nets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now study the behaviour of feed-forward neural networks whose layer weights are initialized by the proposed algorithm. We emphasize that, in contrast to the Gaussian initialization, our weight sampling produces non-independent and non-Gaussian entries. Thus, the analysis of the net’s mappings requires further tools such as specialized law-of-large-numbers and central limit theorems. Sequential vs simultaneous limits While investigating large width DNNs, we recall that there are by now two popular ways in the literature to interpret the large width regime: (a) the so-called “sequential limits” where the large width limits are taken iteratively through the layers, as popularized by, e.g.,   \"geometrically\" in  ; (b) the process of “simultaneous limits”, where all layer widths are allowed to go to infinity at the same time  . In particular, the simultaneous limit techniques provide a general framework where one does not require independence of the individual weights, but rather only that the individual neurons are exchangeable within the\nsame layer, which is also true for our initialization. In the statements following henceforth, we will use the nomenclature “in the large width regime” to encompass both the above. It is well-known that i.i.d. Gaussian weight sampling yields DNNs that behave like Gaussian processes provided the layer widths are sufficiently large [ref]22 [ref]17  . However, it is somewhat surprising that even with our non-i.i.d. we are able to recover a similar phenomenon, which seems to give a strong indication that the sampling described by Algorithm 1 is natural and useful for further purposes (e.g. Bayesian inference and kernel analysis ). Moreover, provided the spectral norms are held fixed, the feed-forward dynamics is step-wise linearly influenced by the respective stable ranks - lower stable ranks would yield a decrease in lengths and curvatures as we see below. Our main result in this Section prescribes the feed-forward dynamics at initialization as a Gaussian Process (both in the sequential and simultaneous limit regimes): Let us suppose that 𝐖lsuperscript𝐖𝑙\\mathbf{W}^{l} are sampled as in Algorithm 1 with given target spectral norm slsubscript𝑠𝑙s_{l} and stable rank rlsubscript𝑟𝑙r_{l}, l=1,…,L𝑙1…𝐿l=1,\\dots,L. At initialization, in the sequential limit N1,…,Nl−1↗∞↗subscript𝑁1…subscript𝑁𝑙1N_{1},\\dots,N_{l-1}\\nearrow\\infty the output functions α~kl​(x,𝛉)superscriptsubscript~𝛼𝑘𝑙𝑥𝛉\\tilde{\\alpha}_{k}^{l}(x,\\boldsymbol{\\theta}), and in the simultaneous limit the final output function fθ,k​(x)subscript𝑓𝜃𝑘𝑥f_{\\theta,k}(x)\ntend to centered Gaussian processes of covariance 𝚺lsuperscript𝚺𝑙\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{l} (respectively 𝚺Lsuperscript𝚺𝐿\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{L}), where 𝚺Lsuperscript𝚺𝐿\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{L} is defined in the following recursive way: where γl=1Nl−1superscript𝛾𝑙1subscript𝑁𝑙1\\gamma^{l}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_{l-1}}} for l=1,…,L𝑙1…𝐿l=1,\\dots,L and the expectation in the last step is taken with respect to a centered Gaussian process f𝑓f of covariance 𝚺l−1superscript𝚺𝑙1\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{l-1}. The proof of Theorem 4.1 is rather technical, and we indicate the main steps below. In order to analyze the network’s feed-forward map one first needs to evaluate the covariance of the weight matrices in our sampling scheme. To this end one uses results from representation theory and Weingarten functions : According to the sampling above, let 𝐖l=𝐔​𝚺​𝐕⊺superscript𝐖𝑙𝐔𝚺superscript𝐕⊺\\mathbf{W}^{l}=\\mathbf{U}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{V}^{\\intercal} where 𝐔,𝐕𝐔𝐕\\mathbf{U},~{}\\mathbf{V} are orthogonal matrices independently uniformly sampled w.r.t. Haar measure and where 𝚺∼𝒮rt,stsimilar-to𝚺subscript𝒮subscript𝑟𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\sim\\mathcal{S}_{r_{t},s_{t}}. Then, Second, the main technical step is the single-layer dynamics, summarized in the following: Let us suppose that 𝐖=𝐔𝐒𝐕𝐓∈ℝN0×N1𝐖superscript𝐔𝐒𝐕𝐓superscriptℝsubscript𝑁0subscript𝑁1\\mathbf{W}=\\mathbf{USV^{T}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{0}\\times N_{1}} is sampled as in Section 3. Then, provided the bias’ variance σbsubscript𝜎𝑏\\sigma_{b} is chosen sufficiently small w.r.t. widths N0,N1subscript𝑁0subscript𝑁1N_{0},N_{1}, we have the following convergence properties: Conditioning on 𝐔,𝐒𝐔𝐒\\mathbf{U},\\mathbf{S}, as N0→∞→subscript𝑁0N_{0}\\rightarrow\\infty the outputs f𝜽,k​(𝒙)subscript𝑓𝜽𝑘𝒙f_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta},k}(\\boldsymbol{x}) in distribution approach a centered Gaussian process (indexed by 𝒙𝒙\\boldsymbol{x}) with covariance 𝚺​(𝒙,𝒙′)=⟨𝒙,𝒙′⟩N0​∑a(Uk​a​Sa​a)2+σb2𝚺𝒙superscript𝒙′𝒙superscript𝒙′subscript𝑁0subscript𝑎superscriptsubscript𝑈𝑘𝑎subscript𝑆𝑎𝑎2superscriptsubscript𝜎𝑏2\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime})=\\frac{\\langle\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}\\rangle}{N_{0}}\\sum_{a}(U_{ka}S_{aa})^{2}+\\sigma_{b}^{2}.

If one lets N0,N1→∞→subscript𝑁0subscript𝑁1N_{0},N_{1}\\rightarrow\\infty simultaneously, then the conditioning on 𝐔,𝐒,𝐕𝐔𝐒𝐕\\mathbf{U},\\mathbf{S},\\mathbf{V} does not play a role and the outputs f𝜽,k​(𝒙)subscript𝑓𝜽𝑘𝒙f_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta},k}(\\boldsymbol{x}) approach a centered Gaussian process with covariance 𝚺​(𝒙,𝒙′)=⟨𝒙,𝒙′⟩​s2​rN0​N1+σb2𝚺𝒙superscript𝒙′𝒙superscript𝒙′superscript𝑠2𝑟subscript𝑁0subscript𝑁1superscriptsubscript𝜎𝑏2\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime})=\\langle\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}\\rangle\\frac{s^{2}r}{N_{0}N_{1}}+\\sigma_{b}^{2}. Numerical illustration of the convergence is given in Fig. 2. The above proposition sets up the base case for the induction for multilayer DNNs. In particular, Statement 3. above allows us to carry through the induction for the simultaneous limits regime.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: width regime” to encompass both the above.
