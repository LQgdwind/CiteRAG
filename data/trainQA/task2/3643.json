      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-attention for ViT-backed Continual Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets  ImageNet [ref]8 is set as the initial task. Six widely-used classification benchmarks are adopted as new visual tasks to be added on the ImageNet initialized vision transformers.\nThree fine-grained classification datasets are involved in demonstrating the performance of our method on images with finer granularity than ImageNet, including CUB , Stanford Cars  and FGVC-Aircraft [ref]29. CIFAR-100 , which has a category hierarchy like Imagenet, is also adopted. Sketches , WikiArt  serve as two art-related datasets which contain pictures of different domains from initial tasks. Besides, we further introduce a large-scale dataset, Places365 , to investigate the continually learning ability on large domain shifts data of MEAT. All input images are resized to 224×224224224224\\times 224 pixels. Backbones  In principle, the specially designed meta-attention mechanism can be applied to any vision transformers. In this paper, three popular transformer-based models are used as the backbone: DeiT-Ti [ref]45, DeiT-S [ref]45, T2T-ViT-12 . We follow the official implementations of adopted three ViTs\nand insert our proposed attention masks to self-attention (only added in the MHSA block) and attention masks to FFN (only added in the FFN block) in each encoder layer. The official pre-trained weights on ImageNet serve as the well-initialization weights. Parameters  In the training stage, we basically follow the training strategies used in the official code of DeiT [ref]45. The initial learning rates of new classifiers and the binary MEAT masks are b​a​t​c​h​s​i​z​e1024×5​e−4𝑏𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒10245superscript𝑒4\\frac{batchsize}{1024}\\times 5e^{-4} and b​a​t​c​h​s​i​z​e1024×0.1𝑏𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒10240.1\\frac{batchsize}{1024}\\times 0.1.\nAll ViTs are trained for 303030 epochs with a batch size of 256256256.\nγ𝛾\\gamma, α𝛼\\alpha and λ𝜆\\lambda are set to 444, 222, and 0.90.90.9. All experimental results are averaged over 5 runs on 6 random sequences of new tasks. Competitors  We compare our proposed MEAT on three transformer-based models with the following competitors:\n(1) Individual; (2) Classifier; (3) LwF ; (4) Piggyback ; (5) HAT ; (6) Adaptor-Bert . Among these baselines, Individual denotes that an independent ViT is trained for each task. As this method duplicates the model by the number of the tasks, its performance can serve as the upper bound of continual learning. Classifier is the simple continual learning strategy that finetunes only the classifier layer, i.e., the last fully connected layer, for the new task. LwF, Piggyback, HAT and Adaptor-Bert are four representative existing methods from both computer vision and NLP for continual learing.\nFor the initial ImageNet task, we directly utilize the official open-source pre-trained weights.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
