      "content": "Paper Title: DeViL: Decoding Vision features into Language\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInherently interpretable models. Apart from post-hoc explanation methods, inherently interpretable models or intrinsic explanation methods try to make modifications to the network architecture or loss function to make the deep model more interpretable. For instance, induced alignment pressure on the weights during optimisation either in a linear     or non-linear manner  1 has been shown to produce more interpretable models. While these methods produce more interpretable models they require adaptation and re-training of existing models and cannot always recover the original task performance. With the increasing size of models, this is not always a scalable solution. Post-hoc methods trade-off the guaranteed faithfulness of the explanation with broader applicability. Post-hoc saliency. Saliency attribution is most commonly produced through perturbations  , gradients , activations    or the combination of those  [ref]9.\nClass Activation Mapping (CAM)  and its successors, such as Grad-CAM  and Grad-Cam++ [ref]9 are one of the most popular attribution methods that make use of network activations, similar to our approach, but additionally use the gradients of the target class.\nWe set ourselves apart from these methods by also providing directly related natural language explanations for the saliency maps. Natural Language Explanations. NLEs are another alternative for explaining a network in a human understandable way. One of the first works on NLEs  used a Long short-term memory (LSTM) network with a reinforcement learning-based loss to guide generated image descriptions into more class discriminative explanations. More recently, the availability of large language models (LLMs) has also seen them applied to NLE generation. These approaches are usually divided into predict-explain and explain-predict paradigms: in the first, a language model is finetuned with features and predictions from a pretrained vision model  , while in the latter a single model is jointly trained to explain and predict   . While the aforementioned approaches only provide a single NLE for the whole image, Bau et al.  attempts to label individual highest activated neurons in a network by correlating them with pixel-wise annotations. Building upon that, Hernandez et al.  collect the MILANNOTATIONS datasets where humans labeled sets of images that showed high activations for individual neurons of different network architectures. By training a vision-language model on this data, individual neurons of different layers can be described in natural language. In contrast, DeViL can generate both types of NLEs (global and local), without requiring a dataset of human annotated descriptions per neuron or layer. Nonetheless, we show that when our model is trained on MILANNOTATIONS, we obtain a higher correspondence with human descriptions. Captioning Models. Image captioning models   1 0 [ref]17, on the other hand, use LLMs to generate free-form captions for the input image.\nState-of-the-art in captioning is obtained by large-scale pre-training and subsequently finetuning on target datasets 0 [ref]17. On the other hand, lightweight models such as CLIPCap  perform competitively by relying on pre-trained vision and language models requiring significantly fewer GPU hours to train.\nDeViL is similar to CLIPCap in that both models make use of a translation network between image features and the language model prompt. While CLIPCap is capable of generating high-quality captions for images, it cannot be directly used to interpret a model’s internal representations. In contrast, by extracting features from multiple layers of the vision model and incorporating dropout, DeViL generalizes to more fine-grained descriptions and improves all captioning metrics on CC3M .\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: of the explanation with broader applicability.
