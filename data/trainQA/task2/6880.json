      "content": "Paper Title: Computation-efficient Deep Learning for Computer Vision: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe micro-architecture refers to the individual layers, modules, and neural operators of backbones. These basic components are the foundation for constructing deep networks. Many works seek to attain higher computational efficiency by improving them. Notably, these works usually serve as off-the-shelf plug-in components that can be employed together with other techniques. 1) Split-transform-merge Strategy.\nTypically, deep networks consist of multiple successively stacked layers with dense connection, where all the input neurons is connected to every output neuron. Formally, ℓℓ\\ell-th layer fℓsuperscript𝑓ℓf^{\\ell} with inputs 𝐱ℓ−1superscript𝐱ℓ1\\mathbf{x}^{\\ell-1} and outputs 𝐱ℓsuperscript𝐱ℓ\\mathbf{x}^{\\ell} can be expressed by However, such dense layers tend to computationally intensive. To address this issue, researchers have proposed to replace the dense connection with particularly designed topologies [ref]3  1, which dramatically reduces the computational complexity, yet yields a competitive or stronger representation ability. Among existing works, one of the most popular designs is the split-transform-merge strategy, as shown in the following (as a fundamental component, a residual connection [ref]4 is added here): where 𝐱ℓ−1superscript𝐱ℓ1\\mathbf{x}^{\\ell-1} is split into C𝐶C embeddings 𝐱1ℓ−1,…,𝐱Cℓ−1subscriptsuperscript𝐱ℓ11…subscriptsuperscript𝐱ℓ1𝐶\\mathbf{x}^{\\ell-1}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{x}^{\\ell-1}_{C} with lower dimensions by a cheap operator fsplitℓ​(⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓsplit⋅f^{\\ell}_{\\textnormal{split}}(\\cdot). The low-dimensional embeddings are processed by the transform functions f1ℓ​(⋅),…,fCℓ​(⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓ1⋅…subscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓ𝐶⋅f^{\\ell}_{1}(\\cdot),\\ldots,f^{\\ell}_{C}(\\cdot), whose input/output dimensions are the same. Notably, each of these functions corresponds to a dense layer, but this procedure is efficient due to the reduced input feature dimension. The processed embeddings are merged by fmergeℓ​(⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓmerge⋅f^{\\ell}_{\\textnormal{merge}}(\\cdot). In the following, we will first discuss the design of the transform and split/merge functions respectively, and then introduce recent improvements over the “split-transform-merge” paradigm. Table 1 summarizes some representative split-transform-merge architectures in popular computationally efficient deep networks. a) “Transform” - homogeneous multi-branch architecture.\nA straightforward choice is to let fcℓ​(⋅),c=1,…,Cformulae-sequencesubscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓ𝑐⋅𝑐1…𝐶f^{\\ell}_{c}(\\cdot),c\\!=\\!1,\\dots,C have the same architecture, and differentiate each other only in the values of the learnable parameters. This design is named as grouped convolution  1 when fcℓ​(⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓ𝑐⋅f^{\\ell}_{c}(\\cdot) corresponds to a convolutional layer, and is adopted in many efficient ConvNets 1  . IGCV    further introduces a permutation operation to facilitate the interaction of different groups of embeddings (i.e., 𝐱cℓ−1,c=1,…,Cformulae-sequencesubscriptsuperscript𝐱ℓ1𝑐𝑐1…𝐶\\mathbf{x}^{\\ell-1}_{c},c\\!=\\!1,\\dots,C). In addition to convolution, this design is also widely adopted in the self-attention layers of vision Transformers (ViTs)  5. In ViTs, it is name as multi-head self-attention, where fcℓ​(⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓ𝑐⋅f^{\\ell}_{c}(\\cdot) is the scaled dot-product attention . In particular, the grouped convolution is named as depth-wise separable convolution when C𝐶C is equal to the channel number of 𝐱ℓ−1superscript𝐱ℓ1\\mathbf{x}^{\\ell-1}. Here fcℓ​(⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓ𝑐⋅f^{\\ell}_{c}(\\cdot) typically corresponds to a single convolution operation, where a large kernel size with sufficient receptive fields can be used without dramatically increasing the computational cost. This highly efficient component is first proposed in MobileNet , and adopted adopted in a wide variety of follow-up models      3 4   . b) “Transform” - heterogenous multi-branch architecture.\nAnother line of works focus on developing nonequivalent branches, where each fcℓ​(⋅),c=1,…,Cformulae-sequencesubscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓ𝑐⋅𝑐1…𝐶f^{\\ell}_{c}(\\cdot),c\\!=\\!1,\\dots,C is assigned with a specialized architecture or task. For example, the Inception architectures [ref]3     adopt a varying receptive fields for different branches (e.g., by changing the convolution kernel size), aiming to aggregate the discriminative information at multiple levels. Recent works further extend this idea by feeding the outputs of fcℓ​(⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓ𝑐⋅f^{\\ell}_{c}(\\cdot) to fc+1ℓ​(⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓ𝑐1⋅f^{\\ell}_{c+1}(\\cdot) 2  , and thus integrating multi-scale features into the outputs. c) “Split/merge” functions\nfsplitℓ​(⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓsplit⋅f^{\\ell}_{\\textnormal{split}}(\\cdot) and fmergeℓ​(⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓmerge⋅f^{\\ell}_{\\textnormal{merge}}(\\cdot) are designed to map the features into or back from low-dimension embeddings with minimal cost. Most works adopt similar architectures for these two components: fsplitℓ​(⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓsplit⋅f^{\\ell}_{\\textnormal{split}}(\\cdot) corresponds to 1×1111\\!\\times\\!1 convolution, while fmergeℓ​(⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓmerge⋅f^{\\ell}_{\\textnormal{merge}}(\\cdot) is accomplished by concatenation or concatenation + 1×1111\\!\\times\\!1 convolution. Representative examples include ResNeXt 1, MobileNets    and Inception networks [ref]3    . In particular, ShuffleNet 3 presents a more efficient design by combining 1×1111\\!\\times\\!1 grouped convolution with channel shuffle. d) Improved paradigms over “split-transform-merge”.\nMore recently, some works start to rethink the limitations of the split-transform-merge paradigm, and find that more efficient deep networks can be obtained by breaking this design principle. For example, motivated by the success of ViTs, ConvNeXt  explicitly introduces an multilayer perceptron (MLP) at each layer by reverse fsplitℓ​(⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓsplit⋅f^{\\ell}_{\\textnormal{split}}(\\cdot) and the depth-wise separable convolution (i.e., fcℓ​(⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓ𝑐⋅f^{\\ell}_{c}(\\cdot)). EfficientNetV2  replace fcℓ​(⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓ𝑐⋅f^{\\ell}_{c}(\\cdot) and fsplitℓ​(⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓsplit⋅f^{\\ell}_{\\textnormal{split}}(\\cdot) with a regular dense convolutional layer at earlier layers, achieving higher practical efficiency on GPU devices. MobileNeXt  moves the depth-wise convolution layers to the two ends of the residual path to encode more expressive spatial information. 2) Inverted Bottleneck.\nBottleneck [ref]4 is a widely-used efficient component in ConvNets. Its basic architecture can be understood on top of Eq. (LABEL:eq:split): the total channel number of {𝐱1ℓ−1,…,𝐱Cℓ−1}subscriptsuperscript𝐱ℓ11…subscriptsuperscript𝐱ℓ1𝐶\\{\\mathbf{x}^{\\ell-1}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{x}^{\\ell-1}_{C}\\} will be reduced compared to 𝐱ℓ−1superscript𝐱ℓ1\\mathbf{x}^{\\ell-1} (e.g., by 4×4\\times in ResNet [ref]4). Consequently, the computationally intensive operations f1ℓ​(⋅),…,fCℓ​(⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓ1⋅…subscriptsuperscript𝑓ℓ𝐶⋅f^{\\ell}_{1}(\\cdot),\\ldots,f^{\\ell}_{C}(\\cdot) are performed on the low-dimensional embeddings, and the overall cost is saved. The effectiveness of this bottleneck is validated in both dense layers (C=1𝐶1C\\!=\\!1) [ref]4 and grouped convolution 1. However, it may be sub-optimal in depth-wise separable convolution, where its low-dimensional transform results in information loss . Inspired by this observation, MobileNetV2  achieves an improved efficiency by proposing an inverted bottleneck, i.e., {𝐱1ℓ−1,…,𝐱Cℓ−1}subscriptsuperscript𝐱ℓ11…subscriptsuperscript𝐱ℓ1𝐶\\{\\mathbf{x}^{\\ell-1}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{x}^{\\ell-1}_{C}\\} have more dimensions than 𝐱ℓ−1superscript𝐱ℓ1\\mathbf{x}^{\\ell-1} (e.g., 6×6\\times ). This designed is further adopted by a number of recent works   . 3) Feature Reusing.\nConventionally, the successive linear connection is the dominant topology for network design. The inputs are fed into a layer and transformed to obtained the inputs of the next layer. Any feature will be utilized for only a single time. Although being straightforward, this design is usually sub-optimal from the lens of computational efficiency. An important idea for lighted-weighted models is to reuse the have-been-used features. a) Inter-layer feature reusing.\nA basic idea is to reuse the features from previous layers. The skip-layer residual connection  [ref]4 adds the inputs of each layer to the outputs, contributing the effective training of very deep and computationally more efficient networks. A more general formulation is established by dense connection  , where all the previous features are fed into a next layer. CondenseNets   extend this architecture by automatically learning the inter-layer connection topology. In contrast, other works like ShuffleNetV2 4 and G-GhostNet  focus on manually designing inter-layer interaction mechanisms. b) Intra-layer feature reusing.\nThe idea of feature reusing can also be leveraged within each network layers. For example, GhostNets   demonstrate that there exist considerable redundancy in the outputs of each layer. They first obtain a small set of intrinsic output features, which are not only used as the inputs of the next layer, but also reused to generating other output features using cheap operations like linear transformations. 4) Feature Down-sampling.\nExtracting deep representations from image-based data typically yields feature maps, which inherently have spatial sizes (i.e., height and weight). This property can be leveraged to reduce the computational cost of models e.g., introducing properly configured feature down-sampling modules. a) Processing feature maps efficiently.\nThe cost of processing feature maps grows quadratically with respect to their height/weight. OctConv  finds that processing all the features with the same resolution is not an optimal design. They propose to process a group of features at a down-sampled scale to capture only the low-frequency information, while the remaining features are designed to recognize high-frequency patterns, and the two groups exchange information after each layer. Consequently, the overall computational cost is reduced. This idea is also effective in ViTs . Similarly, HRNets   and HRFormer  maintain multi-resolution features at each layer, aiming to efficiently extract multi-scale discriminative representations for various computer vision tasks in the meantime. b) Facilitating efficient self-attention.\nParticularly, feature down-sampling can be embedded into self-attention operations in ViTs to improve its efficiency. For example, PVTs   and ShuntedViT  propose to compute attention maps efficiently with down-sampled feature maps. Twins  perform self-attention on low-resolution features to aggregate global information efficiently. 5) Efficient Self-attention.\nViTs  have achieved remarkable success in the fields of computer vision. Their self-attention mechanisms enable adaptively aggregating information across the entire image, yielding excellent scalability with the growing dataset scale or model size. However, vanilla self-attention suffers from high computational cost. A considerable number of recent visual backbones focus on developing more efficient self-attention modules without sacrificing their performance. a) Locality-inspired Self-attention.\nIn this direction, an important idea is drawn from the success of ConvNets: exploiting the locality of images, i.e., encouraging the models to aggregate more information from adjacent spatial regions. Swin Transformers  00 achieve this by performing self-attention only within a square windows. Some other works extending this idea by designing different shapes of attention windows 01 02 03 04 05 06 or introducing soft local constraints to attention maps 07 08. An important challenge faced by these works is how to model the interaction of different windows effectively. Possible solutions to address this issue include changing window positions  00, shuffling the channels 09, designing specialized window shapes 01 03 05 06, or further introducing window-level global self-attention modules 10 11 . b) SoftMax-free Self-attention.\nTo reduce the inherent high computation complexity of self-attention, another line of research proposes to replace the SoftMax function in self-attention with separate kernel functions, yielding linear attention 12. As representative examples, Performer 13 approximates SoftMax with orthogonal random features, while Nyströmformer 14 and SOFT 15 attain this goal through matrix decomposition. Castling-ViT 16 measures the spectral similarity between tokens with linear angular kernels. EfficientViT 17 further leverages depth-wise convolution to improve the local feature extraction ability of linear attention. FLatten Transformer proposes a focused linear attention module to achieve high expressiveness. 18.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: be expressed by However, such dense layers tend to computationally intensive.
