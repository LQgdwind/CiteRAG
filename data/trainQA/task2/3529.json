      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Vision-and-Language Pre-training via Retrieval-based Multi-Granular Alignment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVision-and-Language pre-trained (VLP) models  [ref]8 1 9          that learn the joint cross-modal representation have revolutionized the research on various vision-and-language tasks in recent years.\nHowever, the success of VLP models relies on the availability of a large-scale aligned image-text corpora.\nThe widely used crowd-sourced pre-training datasets such as MS COCO   and Visual Genome  require expensive human annotations which are hard to scale up.\nRecently, the web crawled image-text datasets like Conceptual Captions 3M  and CC12M , and SBU Captions , etc. have dramatically reduced the need for massive human annotation but still require heavy post-cleaning procedures to get aligned image-text pairs.\nIn comparison, the language corpora and image collection are readily available from the web.\nThe convenience of getting a large-scale single-modality data has benefited the self-supervised learning of vision    and language  0 domains respectively.\nThis raises a question: Can we take advantage of easily-accessible large-scale single-modality data to perform unsupervised V+L pre-training without parallel text and images (UVLP)? We define UVLP as follows:\ngiven the separately crawled image collection 𝐈={𝐢1,𝐢2,…,𝐢nI}𝐈subscript𝐢1subscript𝐢2…subscript𝐢superscript𝑛𝐼\\mathbf{I}=\\{\\mathbf{i}_{1},\\mathbf{i}_{2},\\dots,\\mathbf{i}_{n^{I}}\\} and text corpus 𝐓={𝐭1,𝐭2,…,𝐭nT}𝐓subscript𝐭1subscript𝐭2…subscript𝐭superscript𝑛𝑇\\mathbf{T}=\\{\\mathbf{t}_{1},\\mathbf{t}_{2},\\dots,\\mathbf{t}_{n^{T}}\\}, we aim to pre-train a multi-modal model from such data.\nU-VisualBERT is the first UVLP work, where the authors have trained their model on un-aligned text and image data in a round-robin fashion and simply use object tags as an anchor point to bridge the gap between the two modalities.\nTheir research demonstrates that a shared multi-modal embedding can be learned by just presenting a single modality at a time.\nThis however introduces an input discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning stages as each downstream V+L task requires both modalities (image, text) as the input.\nIn this work, we investigate (i𝑖i) whether presenting a joint image-text data from non-parallel data would improve the learned joint embedding space.\nFurthermore, (i​i𝑖𝑖ii) if joint image-text data is fed into the model, how does its latent alignment affect the cross-modal representation learning? To explore these two questions, we simply use the images and captions from Conceptual Captions (CC) dataset  as independently collected uni-modal corpus and perform the following analysis.\nFirst, we compare the pre-trained model’s performance between the two data input strategies:\none is presenting one image or text at a time (round-robin) and the other is presenting a concatenation of a pair of randomly sampled image and text (0% alignment ratio).\nSecond, we prepare five sets of image-text pairs from Conceptual Captions with different levels of pairwise alignment by controlling the ratio of original aligned image-text data from 20% to 100% (while the remaining is randomly sampled from each modality).\nA single-stream transformer is used for all experiments with the standard pre-training objectives: masked language modeling (MLM) on language input and masked region modeling (MRM) on vision input. After pre-training, we adapt the model to a series of four downstream V+L tasks, including VQA , NLVR2 8, Visual Entailment (VE) , and RefCOCO+ .\nThe performance is measured as the meta average of all tasks after fine-tuning.\nThe results are summarized in Fig. 1.\nFrom Fig. 1, it is clear that joint MLM+MRM learning outperforms\nround-robin MLM/MRM.\nSuch gains show that joint image-and-text input is necessary for UVLP even when the input is un-aligned.\nWe also observe a strong positive correlation between the alignment of image-text pairs and the meta average of the fine-tuned downstream tasks of the resulting model.\nThis conveys a seemingly intuitive but quite important message that the more aligned the image-text data is the better the pre-trained model performs. Inspired by these analyses, we propose Unsupervised Vision-and-Language Pre-training via Retrieval-based Multi-Granular Alignment (μ𝜇\\mu-VLA), which uses our novel unsupervised V+L pre-training curriculum for non-parallel data.\nWe first construct a weakly-aligned image-text dataset via retrieval.\nGiven an image, we take its detected object tags as the reference sentence and retrieve the closest sentences from the text corpus via sentence BERT embedding 4 similarity.\nThough the constructed pairs are noisy, the mere weak alignment of concepts is key to learning the latent alignment.\nWe propose to let the model gradually learn a multi-granular alignment, i.e., region-to-object tag level, region-to-noun phrase level, and image-to-sentence level to more effectively bridge the gap between the two modalities.\nWe show how each granularity learned from the weakly-aligned pairs contributes to the final pre-trained model’s performance.\nExperiments show our approach achieves the state-of-art performance\n(in Fig. 1), with a clear gain over  on the 4 downstream tasks. Towards practical applications, we also validate the effectiveness of our approach under a more realistic setting, where the images are from CC and the captions are from BookCorpus (BC) 1.\nSimilar performance gains are achieved in this harder setting, showing the robustness of our approach. To summarize, our contributions are three-fold:\n(i) We analyze what leads to a good unsupervised V+L pre-training and found two key factors: joint image-and-text input, and overall alignment between image-text pairs.\n(ii) Accordingly, we propose a novel retrieval-based pre-training curriculum, which applies multi-granular alignment pre-training tasks between weakly aligned image-text pairs to bridge the gap between the two modalities.\n(iii) We provide comprehensive experiments and analyses showing the robustness of our approach when compared to SOTA supervised and unsupervised V+L pre-training methods.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Vision-and-Language pre-trained (VLP) models  [ref]8 1 9          that learn the joint cross-modal representation have revolutionized the research on various vision-and-language tasks in recent years.\nHowever, the success of VLP models relies on\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
