      "content": "Paper Title: All-In-One: Artificial Association Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThus far, various deep learning models have been reported in the literature, e.g., multilayer perceptron(MLP), convolutional, recurrent, recursive, and graph neural networks  [ref]3 , and these different networks achieve good performances in various fields.\nMost previous studies focus on specific datasets or tasks because there are many tasks that only humans can do and neural networks cannot. We analyze human neural network structures and conduct research to imitate this structure and investigating the discrepancy.\nFirst, we describe some difficulties encountered when imitating the human neural network structure, then we summarize our approach towards these problems for developing the artificial association networks (AANs) proposed in this study. Hereafter, let C-[⋅]delimited-[]⋅[\\cdot] denote the characteristics of the human brain and A-[⋅]delimited-[]⋅[\\cdot] denote our approaches to emulating C-[⋅]delimited-[]⋅[\\cdot]. (C-i) Various sensory organs process information, and there are various locations where this information is received in the cerebral cortex.\nSensory organs provide humans with visual, auditory, and olfactory information, and this information is transferred to the cerebral cortex using different information-processing organs.\nFurther, the optic nerve starts with the visual cortex of the occipital lobe, and the auditory nerve with the auditory cortex of the temporal lobe; thus, the two paths have different starting points. (A-i) We define each sensory organ as a feature extraction process to solve the abovementioned problem.\nFeature extraction networks for each domain are stored in a dictionary data structure for creating a multifeature extraction model (Section III-A).\nEach type of data requires a different feature extraction process based on the domain, and they each have a domain bias. (C-ii) The human brain does not independently process various information domains. Instead, the information received from other sensory organs is gathered in the association area. When we receive information, we process it in addition to the information of various domains around us.\nFor example, if we hear the voice domain information on the word “coffee,” we build a relationship between “latte” in the text domain and “mug” in the image domain.\nThis implies that information processing from different domains is not independent.\nFor example, sensory, visual, and auditory information are fused in the somatosensory, visual, and auditory association areas, respectively. In addition, several types of information are associated with each other. The posterior parietal cortex is located at the top of the head as part of the parietal lobe, wherein visual and auditory information are fused and interpreted; further, this information is coordinated in the frontal lobe and humans act accordingly. This structure inspired us; all information has various relationships, and we plan to develop a data structure such as a graph (relational) or tree (hierarchical) to express these relationships.\nHowever, a tree has only one parent node, and it cannot express the relationship between sibling nodes.\nFurthermore, it is difficult to define the starting and ending points when using a graph.\nFinally, the hidden state of the t-th layer cannot be used at layer t+2 because the hidden state is updated at layer t+1. (A-ii) We propose two new data structures: neuronode and neurotree.\nA neuronode represents an entity that can express the characteristics of the graph and tree data structures. It has connections with sibling nodes in a tree structure and can have multiple parent nodes.\nWe consider the relationships between entities and save them as neuronodes; they are used to create a neurotree. This structure can be seen as a graph; however, it is a feed-forward structure that cannot be reversed. Thus, the neurotree includes directional information from leaf nodes to root nodes, and this path is traversed using recursive propagation. (C-iii) The propagation path of the brain is overly complex. In addition, the characteristics of the brain change continuously  ; the brain has various paths, and it processes information from multiple domains within a single structure.\nHowever, most existing models are structurally fixed and designed such that it limits them to specific tasks or datasets.\nStudies on routing networks0 have already discussed these issues and mentioned problems with fixed neural network configurations and module selectors. Therefore, it is problematic to express neural network layers in a fixed structure.\nThe neural networks need to express various structures based on the information being processed.\nIn contrast, most existing models are structurally fixed, and therefore, they are limited to specific tasks or datasets. (A-iii) We do not design layers; however, we express the flow of information delivery using a neurotree (Section III-C).\nWe extract features as in (A-i) and build a neurotree as in (A-ii). (C-iv) The number of neurons and processing depth determine the complexity that neurons can process. In addition, the number of neurons used differs based on the domain and complexity of the data.\nThe higher the number of neurons, the greater is the complexity of the information that can be processed.\nHowever, neurons are pruned as humans get older, which helps to eliminate unnecessary connections1. Here, we consider that the number of convolutions and connections should be flexible.\nFurther, deep neural networks exhibit a related overfitting problem2 that occurs when using deeper layers3; various attempts have been made to solve this using dropout4.\nNasNet5 attempted to automatically design a layer through reinforcement learning and recurrent neural networks (RNNs); thus, there is an appropriate network depth based on the complexity of the dataset. (A-iv) The height of the neurotree in (A-iii) indicates the number of convolutions.\nWe plan to design a network that can adjust the layer depth based on the complexity of each item of data and not that of the dataset, instead of using a fixed depth. (C-v) There are a significant number of human neurons and they process various data domains. In addition, the human brain contains approximately 85 billion neurons6, and this quantity is difficult to express in a network. (A-v) The AANs can train multiple neurons using a single network cell.\nWe propose a depth-first convolution (DFC) methodology (Section III-F), which is a recursive propagation methodology in which AANs can learn all information in the mini-batch neurotree. This network theory states that units of information have a relationship in the form of a graph, which then becomes a larger unit of information and has a relationship with other units of information. Meanwhile, the unit of information is a set of neurons, and we express it as a vector with artificial association networks. This study was conducted to develop connecting models that can combine various neural networks for implementing the human brain as a function of f​(∃x)→y→𝑓𝑥𝑦f(\\exists x)\\rightarrow y that can simultaneously learn for ∀xfor-all𝑥\\forall x.\nThis is a neural network model that can use any information from a real-world environment as input. This approach proposes data structures (neuronode, neurotree) that can represent existing neural networks in trees; furthermore, we propose an artificial association neural network that learns these structures. With this model, it is possible to express complex information structures in neurotree and perform subtasks simultaneously. Most data structures (e.g., tabular, image, sound, text, deep sequence, graph, and tree data) can be expressed as a neurotree. Thus, this model can be a structurally free, data-driven, and domain-general all-in-one model.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of related work. Section 3 discusses the development of artificial association networks, and this can be applied to multidomain deep learning. Section 4 describes experiments performed to validate the performance of the proposed network. Finally, Section 5 provides a discussion of its merits and concludes this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Thus far, various deep learning models have been reported in the literature, e.g., multilayer perceptron(MLP), convolutional, recurrent, recursive, and graph neural networks  [ref]3 , and these different networks achieve good performances in various fields.\nMost previous studies focus on specific datasets or tasks because there are many tasks that only humans can do and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
