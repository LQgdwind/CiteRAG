      "content": "Paper Title: gTLO: A Generalized and Non-linear Multi-Objective Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs described in Section IV-A, an image version of the original DST environment is used to evaluate the MORL methods specified in Section IV-D. The preference is sampled independently per episode from an equal distribution.\nPer method, ten independent runs of 250,000250000250,000 training time steps per run are executed. Every 1,00010001,000 time steps an evaluation phase is carried out as described in Section IV-C. Evaluation results are visualized in Fig. 6 in form of the mean and 0.950.950.95-confidence interval per evaluation phase of the hypervolume metric in Fig. 6(a), the precision in Fig. 6(c), and the recall in Fig. 6(d). Known metric values for the Pareto coverage set and the convex coverage set are drawn as a black line and dashed black line respectively. In addition, we show the frequency in which each solution from the Pareto front is found within the last evaluation phase of each run per method in Fig. 6(b). The mean and standard deviation of each metric at the end of the 250,000250000250,000 time steps are listed in Table I for the three methods and the outer loop variant of gTLO. As expected and repeatedly shown in other publications (e.g. [ref]3 ) for linear MORL methods, gLinear converges to the two extreme solutions which lie on the convex hull of the non-convex Pareto front (compare Fig. 3). gTLO manages to repeatedly identify all Pareto front solutions except for rare occurrences (as shown in Fig. 6(b), the solutions with (2,−3)23(2,-3) and (3,−5)35(3,-5) are not identified in one of the ten runs).\nThe outer loop approach dTLQ also covers the whole range of solutions but has problems identifying some individual solutions (at (3,−5)35(3,-5) and (24,−13)2413(24,-13)) and rarely identifies the two solutions of highest treasure value. Therefore, gTLO clearly outperforms dTLQ regarding the recall and the hypervolume metric. While in the evaluation runs gLinear never wrongly determines a dominated policy at the end of learning and achieve a precision-value of 1.01.01.0, gTLO in rare cases returns policies that are not part of the Pareto front, and thus reaches a mean precision of 0.990.990.99. To investigate the effect of generalization on the sample efficiency of our method, we compare the convergence speed of gTLO and the outer loop variant of gTLO. The mean amount of steps needed by the outer loop variant until the full Pareto front is found for the first time (141,555.55±20,600.97141plus-or-minus555.5520600.97141,555.55\\pm 20,600.97 steps) is more than double the amount of steps needed by default, inner loop, gTLO (61,000±20,600.9761plus-or-minus00020600.9761,000\\pm 20,600.97 steps). In accordance with already published results for linear generalized methods  [ref]10, this shows a positive effect of generalization regarding the sample efficiency also in the non-linear case. As the deep-sea treasure environment and variants are used for over a decade for evaluating linear and non-linear methods, it is possible to put our results into relation. While often the classical vector version of DST is used, where the state is encoded as one-hot-vector of the submarine’s position [ref]27   [ref]3 , some previous deep MORL evaluations are also based on image versions  [ref]10 . Evaluations of linear methods  [ref]10  are based on convex DST variants. They would converge to the same solution as gLinear when applied to the original non-convex DST. The only method that was evaluated on a non-convex image version of DST is dTLQ , which is shown to solve simplified non-convex DST environments with 3 and 5 treasures after about 300,000300000300,000 and 1,000,00010000001,000,000 total steps respectively. When it comes to exact, tabular non-linear MORL methods, there are some  [ref]3  which completely solve the vector-variant of DST. The steps required until convergence are between 75,0007500075,000 for TLQ [ref]3, which requires knowledge about the Pareto front, and 1,250,00012500001,250,000 steps for MPQ-learning . Other non-linear tabular methods don’t completely solve the problem: Q-learning with a Chebyshev scalarization function converges to a hypervolume of 938.29938.29938.29  and a hypervolume-based inner loop approach reaches 1040.241040.241040.24  of the maximum hypervolume of 1,15511551,155. Pareto DQN [ref]27, the only other inner loop non-linear deep MORL method we identified is evaluated on the one-hot-vector version of DST. In contrast to our work, in [ref]27, details about the Pareto front estimation from the perspective of the first state s0subscript𝑠0s_{0} are reported instead of agent performance metrics. This prevents a direct comparison of results. Although the general course of the Pareto front is approximated by Pareto DQN, the distribution of the estimated Pareto front solutions differ greatly from the true Pareto front. Furthermore, the estimation quality of PDQN highly depends on the complexity of the state space [ref]27.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: metric at the end of the 250,000250000250,000 time steps are listed in Table I for the three methods and the outer loop variant of gTLO.
