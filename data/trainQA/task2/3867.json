      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Task Text Classification using Graph Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Low Resource Language\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe effectiveness of our proposed model is evaluated by comparing with traditional features, different word embeddings , deep learning methods, node embeddings, and existing pretrained multilingual transformer models mBERT  and XLM-R [ref]3. The results can be analyzed from the Table II as follows: Traditional Features:\nWe considered the traditional feature representations BoW and TF-IDF generated from the Telugu corpus as the baselines.\nSince our baseline features do not capture the semantic and contextual information, the baseline system achieves lower F1-scores for all tasks, as shown in Table II, block (A). Distributed Word-Embeddings:\nFor each text classification task, we used the pretrained word-embeddings generated from Telugu corpus (Te-W2V, Te-GloVe, Te-FT, and Te-ME)  as input, and results are reported in Table II.\nWith the local (Te-W2V, Te-FT) and global (Te-GloVe) contextual word embeddings, the system achieves an improved F1-score compared to the baseline model for all the four NLP tasks in which Te-FT embeddings has shown better performance than other word-embeddings, as shown in Table II, block (B).\nHowever, from Table II, we observe that the performance of sarcasm task results is deficient and equal to random guessing due to the high class imbalance problem. Deep Learning Methods:\nAlthough the deep learning models such as CNN and LSTM generated from Telugu corpus outperform the baseline setting, CNN with randomly initialized word embedding yields a lower F1-score when compared with different word embeddings, displayed in Table II, block(C).\nThe LSTM-based model outperforms the traditional features and performs better than CNN.\nMoreover, the sequence of tokens with one-hot representation as input to LSTM yields a better F1-score than four pretrained word-embeddings, except for the EI task.\nThese results infer that LSTMs do not address the long-term dependency problems in morphologically rich languages, Telugu, which affects the classification performance of four tasks. Random Walk based Approaches:\nFrom Table II, block(D) describes the results of random walk based models (DW / N2V) generated from Telugu corpus as input to the LightGBM model for four tasks.\nWe make the following observations from Table II: (i) the DW embeddings reports a low F1-score for four tasks when compared to all the methods except baseline setting in Table II.\n(ii) We observe that the N2V embeddings learned from the three context graphs (i.e., varying the different context window sizes: 2, 3, and 4) given as an input, the model displays an increasing F1-score and reports better results with a context window size of 3 & 4.\n(iii) Compared to distributed word embeddings and deep learning methods, N2V-WS3 and N2V-WS4 display higher results in F1 scores for the HS and SAR tasks.\n(iv) These results demonstrate that N2V is ideal for learning both local and global neighbors so that it can construct more semantic vertex neighborhoods, and it is better at classifying the text classification tasks on the imbalanced datasets (HS and SAR), while DW has the limitation of no control over explored neighborhoods. Pretrained Transformers:\nWe evaluate whether fine-tuning the existing pretrained multilingual transformer models mBERT , and XLM-R [ref]3 is useful for adapting each of the NLP tasks.\nFrom Table II, we find that fine-tuning results show better performance than baseline, CNNs, and DW methods.\nHowever, the performance is lower compared to Telugu pretrained word embeddings, N2V embeddings, and our proposed MT-Text GCN reported in Table II, block(E).\nThis is because the average length of sentences in these Telugu NLP tasks is much longer than that in English datasets. Moreover, the graph is constructed using word-sentence statistics, meaning long texts may produce more sentence connections transited via an intermediate word node. This potentially benefits graph mechanisms, leading to better performances with MT-Text GCN multi-lingual Transformers.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: is evaluated by comparing with traditional features, different word embeddings , deep learning methods, node embeddings, and existing pretrained multilingual transformer models mBERT  and XLM-R [ref]3.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
