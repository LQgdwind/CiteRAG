      "content": "Paper Title: Conservative Prediction via Data-Driven Confidence Minimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate DCM on both the standard OOD detection setting and the more challenging near-OOD detection setting.\nWe evaluate three variants of DCM, each using the training objective described in Section 3, but with three different measures of confidence: MSP [ref]21, MaxLogit [ref]23, and Energy score [ref]37.\nWe denote these three variants as DCM-Softmax, DCM-MaxLogit, DCM-Energy, and describe these variants in detail in Appendix C.\nAll experiments in this section use λ=0.5𝜆0.5\\lambda=0.5 and the default hyperparameters from Hendrycks et al. .\nFurther experimental details are in Appendix D. Datasets.\nWe use CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 as our ID datasets and TinyImageNet, LSUN, iSUN and SVHN as our OOD datasets, resulting in a total of 888 ID-OOD pairs.\nWe split the ID data into 40,000 examples for training and 10,000 examples for validation.\nOur uncertainty and test sets are disjoint datasets with 5,000 and 1,000 examples, respectively.\nOn the near-OOD detection tasks, the ID and OOD datasets consist of disjoint classes in the same dataset (i.e., ID is the first 5 classes in CIFAR-10 and OOD is the last 5 classes.)\nThe number of examples per class is the same as in the standard OOD detection setting. Comparisons.\nIn the standard OOD detection setting, we evaluate DCM against 777 representative OOD detection methods: MSP [ref]21, MaxLogit [ref]23, ODIN , Mahalanobis , Energy Score [ref]37, Outlier Exposure , and Energy Fine-Tuning [ref]37.\nIn the more challenging near-OOD detection setting, standard methods such as Mahalanobis perform poorly  , so we compare DCM with Binary Classifier and ERD  , which attain state-of-the-art performance.\nSimilar to DCM, these methods leverage an unlabeled dataset containing ID and OOD inputs. DCM outperforms prior methods.\nFor the standard OOD detection setting, we report aggregated results in Table 1 and full results in Appendix D.\nIn this setting, DCM outperforms all 7 prior methods on all 8 ID-OOD dataset pairs, as shown in Table 1.\nOn the more challenging near-OOD detection task, Table 2 shows that DCM outperforms Binary Classification, and performs similarly to ERD which requires 3×3\\times compute.\nFigure 2 suggests that (1) DCM produces a conservative model that is underconfident only on OOD inputs and (2) DCM results in a better separation in predictive confidence for ID and OOD inputs than the pretrained model and Outlier Exposure. Importance of having OOD examples in the uncertainty dataset.\nWe analyze how the proportion of OOD data in the uncertainty dataset affects the performance of OOD detectors trained with DCM.\nWe expect uncertainty datasets with a larger fraction of OOD examples to result in better separation, with the highest performance achieved when the uncertainty dataset consists only of OOD data.\nIn the near-OOD detection task shown in  Figure 3, we observe improved performance with larger proportions of OOD examples in the uncertainty dataset for all methods, as expected.\nWe note that DCM achieves the highest performance across all proportions.\nThis indicates that the benefits from the data-driven regularization is robust to differences in uncertainty dataset composition. DCM is robust to confidence minimization weight λ𝜆\\lambda.\nWe fix λ=0.5𝜆0.5\\lambda=0.5 for all ID-OOD dataset pairs, following the practice of Hendrycks et al. , DeVries & Taylor , Hendrycks & Gimpel [ref]21.\nWhile some works   tune hyperparameters for each OOD distribution, we do not in order to test the model’s ability to detect OOD inputs from unseen distributions.\nWe plot OOD detection performance for 4 representative ID-OOD dataset pairs with different λ𝜆\\lambda in Figure 3.\nWhile λ=0.5𝜆0.5\\lambda=0.5 is not always optimal, we find that differences in performance due to changes in λ𝜆\\lambda are negligible, suggesting that λ=0.5𝜆0.5\\lambda=0.5 is a suitable default value. DCM still performs competitively when the uncertainty dataset is the test set itself.\nWe report the performance of DCM using the test set as the uncertainty dataset in Table 6 and Table 7.\nWhen examples similar to those encountered at test time are not available, we find that this transductive variant of DCM still performs competitively to prior methods, despite a slight drop in performance compared to the standard DCM due to the lack of additional data.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: and the more challenging near-OOD detection setting.\nWe evaluate three variants of DCM, each using the training objective described in Section 3, but with three different measures of confidence: MSP [ref]21, MaxLogit [ref]23, and Energy score [ref]37.\nWe denote these three variants as DCM-Softmax, DCM-MaxLogit, DCM-Energy, and describe these variants in detail in Appendix C.\nAll experiments in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
