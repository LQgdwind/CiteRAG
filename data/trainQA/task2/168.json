      "content": "Paper Title: First Order Motion Model for Image Animation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets.\nWe train and test our method on four different datasets containing various objects. Our model is capable of rendering videos of much higher resolution compared to¬†[ref]29 in all our experiments. The VoxCeleb dataset [ref]23 is a face dataset of 22496 videos, extracted from YouTube videos. For pre-processing, we extract an initial bounding box in the first video frame. We track this face until it is too far away from the initial position. Then, we crop the video frames using the smallest crop containing all the bounding boxes. The process is repeated until the end of the sequence. We filter out sequences that have resolution lower than 256√ó256256256256\\times 256 and the remaining videos are resized to 256√ó256256256256\\times 256 preserving the aspect ratio. It‚Äôs important to note that compared to X2Face¬†, we obtain more natural videos where faces move freely within the bounding box. Overall, we obtain 19522 training videos and 525 test videos, with lengths varying from 64 to 1024 frames. The UvA-Nemo dataset [ref]9 is a facial analysis dataset that consists of 1240 videos.\nWe apply the exact same pre-processing as for VoxCeleb. Each video starts with a neutral expression. Similar to Wang et al.¬†, we use 1116 videos for training and 124 for evaluation. The BAIR robot pushing dataset  contains videos collected by a Sawyer robotic arm pushing diverse objects over a table. It consists of 42880 training and 128 test videos. Each video is 30 frame long and has a 256√ó256256256256\\times 256 resolution. Following Tulyakov et al.¬†, we collected 280 tai-chi videos from YouTube. We use 252 videos for training and 28 for testing. Each video is split in short clips as described in pre-processing of VoxCeleb dataset. We retain only high quality videos and resized all the clips to 256√ó256256256256\\times 256 pixels (instead of 64√ó64646464\\times 64 pixels in ). Finally, we obtain 3049 and 285 video chunks for training and testing respectively with video length varying from 128 to 1024 frames. This dataset is referred to as the Tai-Chi-HD dataset. The dataset will be made publicly available. Evaluation Protocol.\nEvaluating the quality of image animation is not obvious, since ground truth animations are not available. We follow the evaluation protocol of Monkey-Net¬†[ref]29. First, we quantitatively evaluate each method on the \"proxy\" task of video reconstruction. This task consists of reconstructing the input video from a representation in which appearance and motion are decoupled. In our case, we reconstruct the input video by combining the sparse motion representation in (2) of each frame and the first video frame.\nSecond, we evaluate our model on image animation according to a user-study. In all experiments we use KùêæK=10 as in [ref]29. Other implementation details are given in Sup. Mat. Metrics.\nTo evaluate video reconstruction, we adopt the metrics proposed in Monkey-Net¬†[ref]29: ‚Ñí1subscript‚Ñí1\\mathcal{L}_{1}. We report the average ‚Ñí1subscript‚Ñí1\\mathcal{L}_{1} distance between the generated and the ground-truth videos. Average Keypoint Distance (AKD). For the Tai-Chi-HD, VoxCeleb and Nemo datasets, we use 3rd-party pre-trained keypoint detectors in order to evaluate whether the motion of the input video is preserved. For the VoxCeleb and Nemo datasets we use the facial landmark detector of Bulat et al.¬†. For the Tai-Chi-HD dataset, we employ the human-pose estimator of Cao et al.¬†.\nThese keypoints are independently computed for each frame. AKD is obtained by computing the average distance between the detected keypoints of the ground truth and of the generated video. Missing Keypoint Rate (MKR). In the case of Tai-Chi-HD, the human-pose estimator returns an additional binary label for each keypoint indicating whether or not the keypoints were successfully detected. Therefore, we also report the MKR defined as the percentage of keypoints that are detected in the ground truth frame but not in the generated one. This metric assesses the appearance quality of each generated frame. Average Euclidean Distance (AED). Considering an externally trained image representation, we report the average euclidean distance between the ground truth and generated frame representation, similarly to Esser et al.¬†. We employ the feature embedding used in Monkey-Net¬†[ref]29. Ablation Study.\nWe compare the following variants of our model. Baseline: the simplest model trained without using the occlusion mask (ùí™ùêí‚ÜêùêÉsubscriptùí™‚ÜêùêíùêÉ\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbf{S}\\leftarrow\\mathbf{D}}=1 in Eq.¬†(8)), jacobians (Jk=ùüôsubscriptùêΩùëòdouble-struck-ùüôJ_{k}=\\mathbb{1} in Eq.¬†(4)) and is supervised with Lr‚Äãe‚ÄãcsubscriptùêøùëüùëíùëêL_{rec} at the highest resolution only; Pyr.: the pyramid loss is added to Baseline; Pyr.+ùí™ùêí‚ÜêùêÉsubscriptùí™‚ÜêùêíùêÉ\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbf{S}\\leftarrow\\mathbf{D}}: with respect to Pyr., we replace the generator network with the occlusion-aware network; Jac. w/o Eq.¬†(12) our model with local affine transformations but without equivariance constraints on jacobians Eq.¬†(12); Full: the full model including local affine transformations described in Sec.¬†3.1. In Fig.¬†3, we report the qualitative ablation. First, the pyramid loss leads to better results according to all the metrics except AKD. Second, adding ùí™ùêí‚ÜêùêÉsubscriptùí™‚ÜêùêíùêÉ\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbf{S}\\leftarrow\\mathbf{D}} to the model consistently improves all the metrics with respect to Pyr.. This illustrates the benefit of explicitly modeling occlusions. We found that without equivariance constraint over the jacobians, JksubscriptùêΩùëòJ_{k} becomes unstable which leads to poor motion estimations. Finally, our Full model further improves all the metrics. In particular, we note that, with respect to the Baseline model, the MKR of the full model is smaller by the factor of 2.75. It shows that our rich motion representation helps generate more realistic images. These results are confirmed by our qualitative evaluation in Tab.¬†1 where we compare the Baseline and the Full models. In these experiments, each frame ùêÉùêÉ\\mathbf{D} of the input video is reconstructed from its first frame (first column) and the estimated keypoint trajectories. We note that the Baseline model does not locate any keypoints in the arms area. Consequently, when the pose difference with the initial pose increases, the model cannot reconstruct the video (columns 3,4 and 5). In contrast, the Full model learns to detect a keypoint on each arm, and therefore, to more accurately reconstruct the input video even in the case of complex motion. Comparison with State of the Art.\nWe now compare our method with state of the art for the video reconstruction task as in [ref]29. To the best of our knowledge, X2Face  and Monkey-Net [ref]29 are the only previous approaches for model-free image animation. Quantitative results are reported in Tab.¬†3. We observe that our approach consistently improves every single metric for each of the four different datasets. Even on the two face datasets, VoxCeleb and Nemo datasets, our approach clearly outperforms X2Face that was originally proposed for face generation. The better performance of our approach compared to X2Face is especially impressive X2Face exploits a larger motion embedding (128 floats) than our approach (60=K*(2+4) floats). Compared to Monkey-Net that uses a motion representation with a similar dimension (50=K*(2+3)), the advantages of our approach are clearly visible on the Tai-Chi-HD dataset that contains highly non-rigid objects (i.e.human body). We now report a qualitative comparison for image animation. Generated sequences are reported in Fig.¬†4. The results are well in line with the quantitative evaluation in Tab.¬†3. Indeed, in both examples, X2Face and Monkey-Net are not able to correctly transfer the body notion in the driving video, instead warping the human body in the source image as a blob. Conversely, our approach is able to generate significantly better looking videos in which each body part is independently animated. This qualitative evaluation illustrates the potential of our rich motion description.\nWe complete our evaluation with a user study. We ask users to select the most realistic image animation. Each question consists of the source image, the driving video, and the corresponding results of our method and a competitive method. We require each question to be answered by 10 AMT worker. This evaluation is repeated on 50 different input pairs. Results are reported in Tab.¬†‚Ä¢ ‚Ä£ 4. We observe that our method is clearly preferred over the competitor methods. Interestingly, the largest difference with the state of the art is obtained on Tai-Chi-HD: the most challenging dataset in our evaluation due to its rich motions.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: Datasets.\nWe train and test our method on four different datasets containing various objects.
