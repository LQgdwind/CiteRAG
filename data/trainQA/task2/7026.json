      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Avoidance of Vulnerabilities in Auto-completed Smart Contract Code Using Vulnerability-constrained Decoding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe use an autoregressive transformer language model to auto-complete the SC code. The goal is to fit a model f:‚ÑùN√óD‚Üí‚ÑùN√óD:ùëì‚Üísuperscript‚ÑùùëÅùê∑superscript‚ÑùùëÅùê∑f:\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times D}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times D}, where NùëÅN is the sequence length of tokens of dimension Dùê∑D. An autoregressive model tries to estimate the conditional probability distribution, pùëùp: where xt‚àà‚ÑùDsubscriptùë•ùë°superscript‚Ñùùê∑x_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D} is the tùë°t‚Äôth observation of a discrete token, cùëêc is the initial context (input) sequence, and TùëáT is the length of the sequence of predicted tokens. Several auto-regressive transformer models, e.g.,  and ChatGPT , are described in the literature. However, only a few of them have open-sourced pre-trained weights. Among the open-sourced models, GPT-J  is one of the popular large models that includes code in its pre-training dataset ‚ÄúThe Pile‚Äù , which is an 825 GB open-source dataset. GPT-J was released in June 2021 by EleutherAI  and outperformed existing open-source GPT systems in qualitative programming evaluations [ref]27. GPT-J uses a decoder-only architecture, as shown in Figure¬†1. GPT-J introduces some notable differences from standard transformer models. Firstly, instead of computing attention and feed-forward layers in sequential order, they are computed in parallel, and the results are added together, which decreases communication during distributed training, resulting in increased throughput. Secondly, GPT-J uses Rotary Position Embedding  (RoPE)[ref]28 for position encoding, which is shown to result in better model quality in tasks with long text [ref]28. So, we chose to use GPT-J-6B, which is a GPT-J model with six billion parameters, as the pre-trained model and fine-tune it using the SCs we collected.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: dataset ‚ÄúThe Pile‚Äù , which is an 825 GB open-source dataset.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
