      "content": "Paper Title: CAMERAS: Enhanced Resolution And Sanity preserving Class Activation Mapping for image saliency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA quantum leap in performance with CAMERAS is also observed in our quantitative results. Saliency maps are typically evaluated by measuring their correlation with the semantic annotations of the image. Pointing game [ref]34 is a popular metric for that purpose, which considers the computed saliency for every object class in the image. If the maximal point in the saliency map is contained within the object, it is considered a hit; otherwise, a miss. The performance is measured as the percentage of successful hits. We refer to [ref]34 for more details on the metric.\nTable 1 benchmarks the performance of CAMERAS for pointing game on 4,95249524,952 images of PASCAL VOC test set [ref]7, and ∼50similar-toabsent50\\sim 50K images of COCO 2014 validation set [ref]16. Our technique consistently shows superior performance, achieving up to 27.5%percent27.527.5\\% error reduction. The gain is higher for ResNet as compared to VGG due the better performance of the original ResNet that permits better saliency. The pointing game generally disregards precision of the saliency maps by focusing only on the maximal points. Arguably, crudeness of the saliency maps computed by the earlier methods influenced this evaluation metric. The possibility of precise saliency computation (by CAMERAS) calls for new metrics that account for the finer details of saliency maps. We propose ‘positive map density’ and ‘negative map density’ as two suitable metrics, respectively defined as:\nρmap+=P​(𝒦​(𝑰⊙𝚿))/∑i∑j𝚿(i,j)×(h×w)subscriptsuperscript𝜌map𝑃𝒦direct-product𝑰𝚿subscript𝑖subscript𝑗superscript𝚿𝑖𝑗ℎ𝑤\\rho^{+}_{\\text{map}}=P(\\mathcal{K}(\\boldsymbol{I}\\odot\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}))/\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j}{\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^{(i,j)}}\\times(h\\times w), and ρmap−=P​(𝒦​(𝑰⊙𝟏−𝚿))/∑i∑j(𝟏−𝚿(i,j))×(h×w)subscriptsuperscript𝜌map𝑃𝒦direct-product𝑰1𝚿subscript𝑖subscript𝑗1superscript𝚿𝑖𝑗ℎ𝑤\\rho^{-}_{\\text{map}}=P(\\mathcal{K}(\\boldsymbol{I}\\odot\\boldsymbol{1}-\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}))/\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j}{(\\boldsymbol{1}-\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^{(i,j)}})\\times(h\\times w). Here, P(.)P(.) is the predicted probability of the actual label of the object. Other notations follow the conventions from above.\nFor an estimated saliency map, the value of ρmap+subscriptsuperscript𝜌map\\rho^{+}_{\\text{map}} improves if higher importance is attached to a smaller number of pixels that retain higher confidence of the model on the original label. In the extreme case of all the pixels deemed maximally important (saliency value 1), the score depicts the model’s confidence on the object label. On the other hand, the value of ρmap−subscriptsuperscript𝜌map\\rho^{-}_{\\text{map}} decreases if lesser importance is attached by the saliency method to more pixels that do not influence the prediction confidence on the original label. Lower value of this metric is more desired. Combined ρmap+subscriptsuperscript𝜌map\\rho^{+}_{\\text{map}} and ρmap−subscriptsuperscript𝜌map\\rho^{-}_{\\text{map}} provide a comprehensive quantification of the quality of the saliency map. We provide results of our technique, Grad-CAM  and the recent Norm-Grad  on our metrics in Table 2.  Due to page limits, we provide further discussion on the proposed metrics in the supplementary material.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: performance with CAMERAS is also observed in our quantitative results.
