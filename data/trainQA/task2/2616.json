      "content": "Paper Title: Deep ℒ¹ Stochastic Optimal Control Policies for Planetary Soft-landing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we describe our methodology to solve the ℒ1superscriptℒ1\\mathcal{L}^{1} stochastic optimal control problem described in equation (10). We seek to minimize the expected cost with respect to the set of all admissible controls 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U}. We begin by defining the value function (V𝑉V) (i.e., the minimum cost-to-go) as follows, Using Bellman’s principle of optimality and applying Ito’s lemma, one can derive the HJB-PDE given by, where the subscripts t𝑡t and 𝐱𝐱{\\mathbf{x}} are used to denote partial derivatives with respect to time and state, respectively. The term inside the infimum operator is known as the Hamiltonian (denoted ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}). The HJB-PDE is a backward, nonlinear parabolic PDE and solving it using grid-based methods is known to suffer from the well-known curse-of-dimensionality.\nAmong some of the recent scalable methods to solve nonlinear parabolic PDEs, the Deep FBSDEs [ref]8   based solution is the most promising and has been used successfully for high-dimensional problems in finance [ref]9. Deep FBSDEs leverage the function approximation capabilities of deep neural networks to solve systems of FBSDEs which in turn solve the corresponding nonlinear parabolic PDE. The connection between the soluions of nonlinear parabolic PDEs and FBSDEs is established via the nonlinear Feynman-Kac lemma [12, Lemma 2]. Thus, applying the nonlinear Feynman-Kac lemma yields the following system of FBSDEs, Because of the terminal condition ϕ​(𝐱​(𝒯))italic-ϕ𝐱𝒯\\phi\\big{(}{\\mathbf{x}}(\\mathcal{T})\\big{)}, V​(𝐱​(t),t)𝑉𝐱𝑡𝑡V\\big{(}{\\mathbf{x}}(t),\\,t\\big{)} evolves backward in time while 𝐱​(t)𝐱𝑡{\\mathbf{x}}(t) evolves forward in time yielding a two-point boundary value problem. Thus, simulating 𝐱​(t)𝐱𝑡{\\mathbf{x}}(t) might be trivial, however V​(𝐱​(t),t)𝑉𝐱𝑡𝑡V\\big{(}{\\mathbf{x}}(t),\\,t\\big{)} cannot be naively simulated by backward integration like an ODE. This is because within the Ito integration framework, in order for solutions to be adapted, the process should be non-anticipating; which means that in this case naive backward integration of V​(𝐱​(t),t)𝑉𝐱𝑡𝑡V\\big{(}{\\mathbf{x}}(t),\\,t\\big{)} would result in it depending explicitly\non future values of noise making it an anticipating stochastic process.\nOne solution to solve BSDEs is to backward-propagate the conditional expectation of the process as was done in . However, the least-squares-based algorithm to approximate the conditional expectation suffers from compounding approximation errors at every time step and thus cannot scale. To overcome this, the deep FBSDE method [ref]8 parameterizes the unknown value function V​(𝐱​(0), 0;θ)𝑉𝐱0 0𝜃V\\big{(}{\\mathbf{x}}(0),\\,0;\\,\\theta\\big{)} and the gradient of the value function V𝐱​(𝐱​(t),t;θ)subscript𝑉𝐱𝐱𝑡𝑡𝜃V_{{\\mathbf{x}}}\\big{(}{\\mathbf{x}}(t),\\,t;\\,\\theta\\big{)} using an LSTM-based deep neural network. The parameters θ𝜃\\theta of the network are trained using Adam  or any variant of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. By introducing an initial condition, the BSDE is forward propagated as if it were a forward SDE and the known terminal condition (V​(𝐱​(𝒯),𝒯)=ϕ​(𝐱​(𝒯)))𝑉𝐱𝒯𝒯italic-ϕ𝐱𝒯\\bigg{(}V\\big{(}{\\mathbf{x}}(\\mathcal{T}),\\,\\mathcal{T}\\big{)}=\\phi\\big{(}{\\mathbf{x}}(\\mathcal{T})\\big{)}\\bigg{)} is used as a training loss for the deep neural network. This solution has been demonstrated to be immune to compounding errors and can scale to high-dimensional problems [ref]8  . The Hamiltonian minimization at every time step computes the optimal control (i.e., the optimal thrust) that is used in the drifts of the FSDE and the BSDE. For numerical simulations, the system of FSBDEs is discretized in time using an Euler-Maruyama discretization to yield the following set of equations, where k𝑘k denotes the discrete-time index and Δ​tΔ𝑡\\Delta t denotes the time-interval (in continuous-time) between any two discrete-time indices k𝑘k and k+1𝑘1k+1. For systems with control-affine dynamics and quadratic running control costs (or ℒ2superscriptℒ2\\mathcal{L}^{2} norm of control) as in [ref]8, this minimization step has a closed form expression. For the one dimensional soft-landing problem as in , the closed-form expression yields the well-known bang-bang optimal control solution due to presence of the ℒ1superscriptℒ1\\mathcal{L}^{1} norm in the running control cost. However, for the general soft-landing problem in three dimensions, as presented in this paper, the dynamics are non-affine with respect to the controls. As a result, a closed-form bang-bang optimal control cannot be derived and the Hamiltonian minimization step requires a numerical solution.\nAdditionally, as described in equation (10), the general problem has non-trivial control constraints with non-affine dynamics. In the following section, we build off of recent work [ref]9 that embeds a non-convex optimizer into the deep FBSDE framework to solve non-convex Hamiltonian minimization problems at each time step. We extend this framework to handle the aforementioned control constraints as well as the first-exit problem formulation. Moreover, as stated in [ref]9 this non-convex optimizer is differentiable and can\nfacilitate end-to-end learning making it a good fit to be embedded within the deep FBSDE framework.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: and solving it using grid-based methods is known to suffer from the well-known curse-of-dimensionality.\nAmong some of the recent scalable methods to solve nonlinear parabolic PDEs, the Deep FBSDEs [ref]8   based solution is the most promising and has been used successfully for high-dimensional problems in finance [ref]9.
