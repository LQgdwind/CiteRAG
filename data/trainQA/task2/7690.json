      "content": "Paper Title: (Towards a) Statistical Probabilistic Lazy Lambda Calculus\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRather than consider a separate probabilistic powerdomain construction, there is a line of work that considers types that are already closed under probability. In this spirit,¬†Danos and Harmer  describe a semantics for a probabilistic extension of Idealized Algol; the key enhancement to traditional game semantics is to move from deterministic strategies to probabilistically deterministic strategies. ¬†Danos and Ehrhard  describe probabilistic coherence spaces where types are interpreted as convex sets and programs as power series.¬†Ehrhard et¬†al.  establish a remarkable equational (but not inequational!) full abstraction result for this semantics.¬†Goubault-Larrecq  motivates why such a result holds by showing how to define a ‚Äúpoor mans parallel or‚Äù in a probabilistic language. Sangiorgi and Vignudelli  use environmental bisimulation in a thorough treatment of probabilistic languages. Environmental bisimulation tracks an observer‚Äôs knowledge about values computed during the bisimulation game with aim of simplifying the delicate proofs of congruence in applicative bisimulation. We gratefully acknowledge their impact on the formalization of the operational aspects of the calculus. Both the above lines of research resolve the tension between the probabilistic powerdomain and function spaces. However, they do not account for the normalization of probability distributions. It is plausible that our techniques that study the order theory of simulation can be adapted to these settings. A second line of work is on Quasi Borel Spaces¬†[ref]42 . In our reading of this approach, it diagnoses the problems of modeling statistical probabilistic languages as arising from the interplay of approximating data and approximating probabilities. So, the radical design idea is just to separate them altogether.¬†Heunen et¬†al.  shows that this category is cartesian closed, and¬†Vakar et¬†al. [ref]42 shows how to interpret a rich type theory by exploiting an elegant integration with axiomatic domain theory. This approach addresses the full expressiveness of statistical probabilistic languages. However, since we are forced out of the realm of standard measure theory, we are perforce forced to ‚Äúreinvent the wheel‚Äù for probabilistic reasoning. The full integration with classical reasoning techniques of programming languages remains to be resolved in future work. Our suggested approach for ùñ≤ùóçùñ∫ùóçùñØùóãùóàùñªùñ≤ùóçùñ∫ùóçùñØùóãùóàùñª\\mathsf{StatProb}-languages inherits powerful coinductive reasoning from open bisimulation, approximation techniques from the underlying domain theory and its intimately related metric space, and stays within the confines of classical measure theory. However, as it stands, this paper is merely a promise. Its full realization via a thorough study of a full language with continuous probability distributions in this setting is left to future work.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: of probability distributions.
