      "content": "Paper Title: The Approximate Degree of DNF and CNF Formulas∗\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRepresentations of Boolean functions by real polynomials play a central\nrole in theoretical computer science. Our focus in this paper is on\napproximate degree, a particularly natural and useful complexity\nmeasure. Formally, the ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-approximate degree of a Boolean\nfunction f:{0,1}n→{0,1}:𝑓→superscript01𝑛01f\\colon\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\to\\{0,1\\} is denoted degϵ⁡(f)subscriptdegreeitalic-ϵ𝑓\\deg_{\\epsilon}(f)\nand defined as the minimum degree of a real polynomial p𝑝p that approximates\nf𝑓f within ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon pointwise: |f​(x)−p​(x)|⩽ϵ𝑓𝑥𝑝𝑥italic-ϵ|f(x)-p(x)|\\leqslant\\epsilon for\nall x∈{0,1}n.𝑥superscript01𝑛x\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}. The standard choice of the error parameter is ϵ=1/3,italic-ϵ13\\epsilon=1/3,\nwhich is a largely arbitrary setting that can be replaced by any other\nconstant in (0,1/2)012(0,1/2) without affecting the approximate degree by\nmore than a multiplicative constant. Since every function f:{0,1}n→{0,1}:𝑓→superscript01𝑛01f\\colon\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\to\\{0,1\\}\ncan be computed with zero error by a polynomial of degree at most\nn,𝑛n, the ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-approximate degree is always at most n.𝑛n. The notion of approximate degree originated three decades ago in the\npioneering work of Nisan and Szegedy \nand has since proved to be a powerful tool in theoretical computer\nscience. Upper bounds on approximate degree have algorithmic applications,\nwhereas lower bounds are a staple in complexity theory. On the algorithmic\nside, approximate degree underlies many of the strongest results obtained\nto date in computational learning, differentially private data release,\nand algorithm design in general. In complexity theory, the notion\nof approximate degree has produced breakthroughs in quantum query\ncomplexity, communication complexity, and circuit complexity. A detailed\nbibliographic overview of these applications can be found in [ref]47 . Approximate degree has been particularly prominent in the study of\n𝖠𝖢0,superscript𝖠𝖢0\\operatorname{\\mathsf{AC}}^{0}, the class of polynomial-size constant-depth circuits\nwith gates ∨,∧,¬\\vee,\\wedge,\\neg of unbounded fan-in. The simplest functions\nin 𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖠𝖢0\\operatorname{\\mathsf{AC}}^{0} are conjunctions and disjunctions, which have depth 111,\nfollowed by polynomial-size CNF and DNF formulas, which have depth 222,\nfollowed in turn by higher-depth circuits. Lower bounds on the approximate\ndegree of 𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖠𝖢0\\operatorname{\\mathsf{AC}}^{0} functions have been used to settle the quantum\nquery complexity of Grover search ,\nelement distinctness , and a host\nof other problems 4; resolve the communication\ncomplexity of set disjointness in the two-party quantum model  \nand number-on-the-forehead multiparty model   [ref]28   1  ;\nseparate the communication complexity classes 𝖯𝖯𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{PP} and 𝖴𝖯𝖯𝖴𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{UPP} 3 ;\nand separate the polynomial hierarchy in communication complexity\nfrom the communication class 𝖴𝖯𝖯𝖴𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{UPP} . Despite\nthis array of applications and decades of study, our understanding\nof the approximate degree of 𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖠𝖢0\\operatorname{\\mathsf{AC}}^{0} has remained surprisingly\nfragmented and incomplete. In this paper, we set out to resolve this\nquestion in full. In more detail, previous work on the approximate degree of 𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖠𝖢0\\operatorname{\\mathsf{AC}}^{0}\nstarted with the seminal 1994 paper of Nisan and Szegedy ,\nwho proved that the OR function on n𝑛n bits has approximate degree\nΘ​(n).Θ𝑛\\Theta(\\sqrt{n}). This was the best result until Aaronson and Shi’s\ncelebrated lower bound of Ω​(n2/3)Ωsuperscript𝑛23\\Omega(n^{2/3}) for the element distinctness\nproblem . In a beautiful paper\nfrom 2017, Bun and Thaler  showed that\n𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖠𝖢0\\operatorname{\\mathsf{AC}}^{0} contains functions in n𝑛n variables with approximate\ndegree Ω​(n1−δ)Ωsuperscript𝑛1𝛿\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta}), where the constant δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 can\nbe made arbitrarily small at the expense of increasing the depth of\nthe circuit. In follow-up work, Bun and Thaler 8\nproved an Ω​(n1−δ)Ωsuperscript𝑛1𝛿\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta}) lower bound for approximating 𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖠𝖢0\\operatorname{\\mathsf{AC}}^{0}\ncircuits even with error exponentially close to 1/2,121/2, where once\nagain the circuit depth grows with 1/δ1𝛿1/\\delta. A stronger yet result\nwas obtained by Sherstov and Wu , who\nshowed that 𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖠𝖢0\\operatorname{\\mathsf{AC}}^{0} has essentially the maximum possible threshold\ndegree (defined as the limit of ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-approximate degree as\nϵ↗1/2↗italic-ϵ12\\epsilon\\nearrow 1/2) and sign-rank (a generalization of\nthreshold degree to arbitrary bases rather than just the basis of\nmonomials). Quantitatively, the authors of \nproved a lower bound of Ω​(n1−δ)Ωsuperscript𝑛1𝛿\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta}) for threshold degree\nand exp⁡(Ω​(n1−δ))Ωsuperscript𝑛1𝛿\\exp(\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta})) for sign-rank, essentially matching\nthe trivial upper bounds. As before, δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 can be made arbitrarily\nsmall at the expense of increasing the circuit depth. In particular,\n𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖠𝖢0\\operatorname{\\mathsf{AC}}^{0} requires a polynomial of degree Ω​(n1−δ)Ωsuperscript𝑛1𝛿\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta})\neven for approximation to error doubly (triply, quadruply, quintuply…)\nexponentially close to 1/2121/2. The lower bounds of  8 \nshow that 𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖠𝖢0\\operatorname{\\mathsf{AC}}^{0} functions have essentially the maximum possible\ncomplexity—but only if one is willing to look at circuits\nof arbitrarily large constant depth. What happens at small\ndepths has been a wide open problem, with no techniques to address\nit. Bun and Thaler observe that their 𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖠𝖢0\\operatorname{\\mathsf{AC}}^{0} circuit in \nwith approximate degree Ω​(n1−δ)Ωsuperscript𝑛1𝛿\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta}) can be flattened to\nproduce a DNF formula of size exp⁡(logO​(log⁡(1/δ))⁡n)superscript𝑂1𝛿𝑛\\exp(\\log^{O(\\log(1/\\delta))}n),\nbut this is superpolynomial and thus no longer in 𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖠𝖢0\\operatorname{\\mathsf{AC}}^{0}.\nThe only progress of which we are aware is an Ω​(n3/4−δ)Ωsuperscript𝑛34𝛿\\Omega(n^{3/4-\\delta})\nlower bound obtained for polynomial-size DNF formulas in 4 .\nThis leaves a polynomial gap in the approximate degree for small depth\nversus arbitrary constant depth. Our main contribution is to definitively\nresolve the approximate degree of 𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖠𝖢0\\operatorname{\\mathsf{AC}}^{0} by constructing,\nfor any constant δ>0,𝛿0\\delta>0, a polynomial-size DNF formula with approximate\ndegree Ω​(n1−δ)Ωsuperscript𝑛1𝛿\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta}). We now describe our main result and\nits generalizations and applications.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: approximate degree has produced breakthroughs in quantum query\ncomplexity, communication complexity, and circuit complexity.
