(7))\nis based on the convolution operation,\nand is therefore translation covariant (or equivariant), i.e.,\nit commutes with the translation operator and\nsatisfies the relation Wj​(Tc​f)=Tc​Wj​(f)subscript𝑊𝑗subscript𝑇𝑐𝑓subscript𝑇𝑐subscript𝑊𝑗𝑓W_{j}(T_{c}f)=T_{c}W_{j}(f).\nAt the same time, the wavelet transform, is stable to small deformations,\nwhich is a very important property that\ncan be expressed as a Lipschitz continuity condition: where ‖f‖2=∫|f​(t)|2​𝑑tsubscriptnorm𝑓2superscript𝑓𝑡2differential-d𝑡\\|f\\|_{2}=\\int|f(t)|^{2}dt is the L2​(ℝ)superscript𝐿2ℝL^{2}(\\mathbb{R}) norm, and\n|∇τ​(t)|∇𝜏𝑡|\\nabla\\tau(t)| is a measure of the deformation amplitude\n(it is assumed that |∇τ​(t)|<1∇𝜏𝑡1|\\nabla\\tau(t)|<1, which makes the small deformation an invertible transformation ). We note that, in the\ncontrol theory and signal processing communities,\nconvolutions are associated with systems described by the term\n’linear time-invariant’.\nTo avoid confusion, with the terminology used here,\nthese systems are considered linear covariant (or equivariant) operators\nwith respect to translation in time. To induce invariance with respect to translation,\nit is sufficient to integrate (average) a\ntranslation-covariant representation\nover the translation group.\nThat is to say that\nthe integral ∫Wj​f​(c)​𝑑csubscript𝑊𝑗𝑓𝑐differential-d𝑐\\int W_{j}f(c)dc is translation invariant.\nHowever, it turns out to be\nthe trivial invariant ∫−∞∞Wj​f​(t−c)​𝑑c=0superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑊𝑗𝑓𝑡𝑐differential-d𝑐0\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}W_{j}f(t-c)dc=0, since,\nby definition, ∫−∞∞ψ​(t)​𝑑t=0superscriptsubscript𝜓𝑡differential-d𝑡0\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\psi(t)dt=0.\nTherefore, it is necessary to insert a non-linear operation between the\nwavelet transform and the integration .\nIt has been shown that a point-wise and\nstable non-linear operator ρ𝜌\\rho\n(for stability: ‖ρ​f‖≤‖f‖norm𝜌𝑓norm𝑓\\|\\rho f\\|\\leq\\|f\\| and ‖ρ​f−ρ​g‖≤‖f−g‖norm𝜌𝑓𝜌𝑔norm𝑓𝑔\\|\\rho f-\\rho g\\|\\leq\\|f-g\\|),\nthat also commutes with the translation (and the deformation) group,\nis the L1​(ℝ)superscript𝐿1ℝL^{1}(\\mathbb{R}) norm: ‖f‖1=∫|f​(t)|​𝑑tsubscriptnorm𝑓1𝑓𝑡differential-d𝑡\\|f\\|_{1}=\\int|f(t)|dt,\nwhich acts as a rectifying function, similar to the ReLu function in\ndeep convolutional neural networks.\nThe choice ρ=∥⋅∥1\\rho=\\|\\cdot\\|_{1} also preserves the deformation stability\nproperties of the wavelet transform. The cascade of the wavelet transform, the non-linear operation,\nand the averaging integral, results in the representation\n∫ρ​Wj​(f)​(t)​𝑑t𝜌subscript𝑊𝑗𝑓𝑡differential-d𝑡\\int\\rho W_{j}(f)(t)dt, in every resolution j𝑗j.\nHowever, global invariance is not always desired.\nIn contrast, it is often better to\ncompute locally invariant representations for translations\nup to a scale 2Jsuperscript2𝐽2^{J} for some index J𝐽J.\nThis can be obtained by substituting the integral\nby a convolution with a low-pass filter localized in a spatial\nwindow scaled at 2Jsuperscript2𝐽2^{J}.\nThe result is a representation that belongs to VJsubscript𝑉𝐽V_{J}, and,\nin particular the projection of ρ​Wj​(f)𝜌subscript𝑊𝑗𝑓\\rho W_{j}(f) to VJsubscript𝑉𝐽V_{J}, for J≥j𝐽𝑗J\\geq j,\nwhich can be computed by the pyramid of filters of the wavelet transform,\nas explained above.\nMoreover, during the computation of the wavelet transform, the information\nlost in averaging (projecting to VJsubscript𝑉𝐽V_{J}) is kept in the coefficients\n{cj,n}j<Jsubscriptsubscript𝑐𝑗𝑛𝑗𝐽\\left\\{c_{j,n}\\right\\}_{j<J} of the wavelet transform.\nThis information can be used to build new invariant features by\napplying the wavelet transform again, creating a deep scattering network\nintroduced by Bruna in .\nThe implementation of the\nscattering transform is based on a complex-valued convolutional neural network\nwhose filters are fixed wavelets and ρ𝜌\\rho is a complex modulus operator\nas described above .\nWe note that the features of the scattering transform do not belong to the\nsubspaces {Vj,j∈ℕ}subscript𝑉𝑗𝑗ℕ\\left\\{V_{j},j\\in\\mathbb{N}\\right\\} that define the classical wavelet hierarchy.\nHowever, they define a multi-level\nhierarchy of successively more detailed information that can be used in a similar way.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: very successful in multiple applications,\nespecially in sound and image recognition,\nwhere translation invariance and stability to small\ndeformations are important properties of the representation [ref]24.\nThe translation group is a Lie group of operators\n{Tc}c∈ℝsubscriptsubscript𝑇𝑐𝑐ℝ\\left\\{T_{c}\\right\\}_{c\\in\\mathbb{R}}\nsuch that\nTc​f​(t)=f​(t−c)subscript𝑇𝑐𝑓𝑡𝑓𝑡𝑐T_{c}f(t)=f(t-c), while\nthe\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
