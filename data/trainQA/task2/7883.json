      "content": "Paper Title: SquirrelFS: using the Rust compiler to check file-system crash consistency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe implemented SquirrelFS in Rust with 7500 LOC.\nIt uses bindings from the Rust for Linux project  to connect to the Linux Virtual File System (VFS) layer.\nFigure 4 shows SquirrelFS’s architecture.\nWe also built a model of SquirrelFS in the model-checking language Alloy  to check its design for crash consistency issues.\nWe describe our experience developing SquirrelFS in §4. Overview.\nThe design of SquirrelFS combines aspects of FreeBSD’s FFS [ref]44 and PM file systems such as NOVA [ref]57 and WineFS .\nLike FFS, it has a simple on-storage layout, and uses soft updates.\nLike other PM file systems, SquirrelFS uses volatile index structures that are built when the file system is mounted. SquirrelFS’s design was primarily influenced by two factors.\nFirst, we wanted to keep dependencies as simple as possible and avoid nested persistent structures that are difficult to represent in typestate.\n\nSecond, we assume the x86 PM persistence model in which only aligned updates of 8 bytes (or smaller) are crash atomic .\nUnder the x86 model, persistent addresses can be accessed via regular memory stores, but the corresponding cache line must be flushed before updates become persistent; a memory barrier like a store fence must also be invoked to correctly order stores .\nDurable structures may also be updated via cache-bypassing non-temporal store instructions, which still require a store fence for persistence ordering.\nThis programming model influences the structure of persistent objects and restricts the set of legal orderings. All system calls in SquirrelFS are synchronous, meaning that updates to durable structures made by each system call are durable by the time the system call returns.\nAs such, fsync is a no-op in SquirrelFS.\nMetadata-related operations are also crash-atomic.\nData-related operations are not atomic in the current SquirrelFS prototype, which matches the default behavior of other PM file systems like NOVA [ref]57.\nThese operations could be made atomic by using copy-on-write to update file contents. Persistent layout.\nSquirrelFS uses a simple layout to reduce the complexity of update dependencies.\nSquirrelFS splits the storage device into four sections: the superblock, the inode table, the page descriptor table, and the data pages.\nThe inode table is an array of all of the inodes in the system.\nSquirrelFS reserves enough space for approximately one inode for every 16KB of data (four pages), the same ratio used by the Linux Ext4 file system. The page descriptor array contains page metadata.\nRather than having inodes point to the pages they own, each page descriptor contains a backpointer to its owner (similar to NoFS ) and stores its own metadata (e.g., its offset in the file).\nThis approach simplifies dependency rules for updates involving page allocation and deallocation.\nAll remaining space after the page descriptor table is used for data and/or directory pages. Volatile structures.\nSquirrelFS’s persistent layout simplifies typestate and update dependency rules, but it is not amenable to fast lookups.\nTherefore, SquirrelFS uses indexes in DRAM to speed up lookup and read operations.\nEach inode in the VFS inode cache has a private index for the resources it owns; index data for uncached nodes is stored in the VFS superblock. Like many other PM file systems, SquirrelFS uses volatile allocators: allocation information is not stored in a persistent manner, but rather rebuilt each time the file system is mounted.\nIt uses a per-CPU page allocator and a single shared inode allocator (which could be converted to a per-CPU allocator to improve scalability).\nThe allocators use free lists backed by kernel RB-trees. SquirrelFS’s indexes and allocators are rebuilt by scanning the file system when SquirrelFS is mounted.\nAn inode, directory entry, or page descriptor is considered allocated if any of its bytes are non-zero.\nDirectory entries and page descriptors are only valid if their inode numbers are set; inodes are valid only if they are reachable from the root.\nThus, updates that allocate new structures and set non-inode metadata fields need not be crash-atomic. Synchronous Soft Updates. SquirrelFS uses an implementation of SSU for crash consistency.\nAs shown in Figure 3, operations that involve creation of new objects must first durably allocate and initialize resources before linking them into the file system (setting the directory entry’s inode in the example) to enforce rule 1 (never point to a structure before it has been initialized).\nDeallocation proceeds in reverse; links are first cleared, then the object itself is deallocated by zeroing all of its bytes.\nSquirrelFS enforces rule 2 of soft updates (never re-use a resource before nullifying all previous pointers to it) by treating durable objects that are not completely zeroed out as allocated and by ensuring via typestate that pointers to the object are cleared before the object can be zeroed. Typestate transition functions. SquirrelFS updates the typestate of objects via typestate transition functions.\nThese functions take ownership of the original object, modify it, and return it to the caller with the new typestate.\nThese functions are defined only on certain typestates to ensure they are called in a safe order.\nFor example, the typestate transition function commit_dentry(), shown in Listing 2, is only defined for directory entries with type Dentry<Clean, Alloc>, and also takes ownership of an inode of type Inode<Clean, Init>.\nCalling commit_dentry() out of order – e.g., on a directory entry that has not yet been persistently allocated – is a potential crash-consistency bug and results in a compiler error. Concurrency. SquirrelFS supports concurrent file-system operations.\nIt relies on VFS-level locking on durable resources like inodes.\nThis locking, together with Rust’s type system, ensures that each resource has only one owner – and only one type – at any time, enabling strong typestate-based compile-time checking.\nSquirrelFS uses internal locks to protect its allocators and indexes. Building a model with Alloy.\nWhile the typestate pattern can enforce a given operation order, it cannot verify that this order is crash consistent.\nTo gain more confidence that SquirrelFS’s design is crash consistent, we built a model of SquirrelFS in the Alloy model checking language . Alloy provides a language for specifying transition systems and a model checker to explore possible sequences of states (traces) of these systems.\nAlloy’s implementation is based on a logic of relations; each system is composed of a set of constraints that define a set of structures and the relations between them, and the model checker uses constraint solving to find traces. In SquirrelFS, there is roughly a one-to-one mapping between typestate transitions in the Rust implementation and the next-state predicates in the Alloy model.\nEach next-state predicate specifies the states in which the transition may occur and the changes it makes to the model’s state.\nThe model includes next-state predicates for typestate transitions and persistent updates.\nIt also includes transitions that model crashes and recovery, which let us check SquirrelFS’s design for crash-consistency bugs. Each persistent structure in SquirrelFS is represented by a corresponding structure, also called a signature, in Alloy.\nThe model also includes a Volatile signature that is used to model volatile aspects of the file system like its indexes.\nEach typestate is represented by a signature, and instances of persistent structures are mapped to their current typestate.\nEach file system operation is also represented by a signature, and relations map system calls to instances of persistent objects they are operating on as well as other volatile state (e.g., the locks held by that operation).\nWe use this to model concurrent file-system operations.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: language Alloy  to check its design for crash consistency issues.\nWe describe our experience developing SquirrelFS in §4. Overview.\nThe design of SquirrelFS combines aspects of FreeBSD’s FFS [ref]44 and PM file systems such as NOVA [ref]57 and WineFS .\nLike FFS, it has a simple on-storage layout, and uses soft updates.\nLike other PM file systems, SquirrelFS uses volatile index structures\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
