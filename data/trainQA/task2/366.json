      "content": "Paper Title: Chapter 1 How deep the machine learning can be11footnote 1Submitted to appear in book ”A closer look at deep learning”, by Nova\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe technology of parallelization at that time was at the stage \nthat the performance gain\n(despite that thousands of processors were used in the systems) could not achieve 200. According to that stage,\none considered the major bottleneck to be the software contribution\n(like initialization, thread creation), at that time correctly. It was stated [ref]8 that\n”the serial fraction, s, in most applications does not remain constant but is a diminishing function of the problem size, Amdahl’s law does not apply directly when the problem is scaled”. The benchmarking time in the case of supercomputers is in the order of several hours  (or 1013superscript101310^{13} clock cycles), so the non-parallelizable fraction (the one-time initialization and task creation) becomes small, but remains finite.\nThat small sequential-only fraction, while one processor organizes the work (and talks individually to all fellow processors), shall be multiplied by the total number of processors in the system555One can decrease this number by clustering or more successfully using ’internal clustering’ , so the formerly ’diminishing part’ is amplified strongly. Not\nonly is it non-negligible, but can even dominate. For a detailed discussion see [ref]20. Although that statement was valid at the time of writing paper [ref]8, in the age of several dozens of processors only,\nit must be revised when there are millions of processors in the computing systems. Nowadays, the time when one processor is performing the non-parallelizable activity while the others\nremain idle, shall be multiplied by a factor of 103superscript10310^{3}…106superscript10610^{6} times higher (so much more times idle time). During the past quarter of a century, the number of processors increased, and the efficiency of their parallelization enhanced.\nNow it is time to scrutinize the roles of the different contributions. As it turned out [ref]20,\nthe technical development reordered ranking of the different\ncontributions to the non-parallelizable fraction of computing. In the modern systems, the HW parallelization efficiency (mainly due to the higher interconnection speed) can be smaller than that of the already mentioned software contribution. Due to the larger sizes, one must re-evaluate the role of the physical size and the interconnection. For today,\nthe need of communication between the parallelized parts became a dominant factor  [ref]8. It is well is known that at large core numbers, the efficiency of the supercomputers also depends on the task running on the supercomputer .\nAs experienced for the two popular benchmark programs HPL and HPCG, there are as many efficiencies as many benchmarks.\nThe lack of understanding of the role of the number of processors and the parallelization efficiency leads to explanations that some ’architectural weakness’ is behind the much lower efficiency of Taihulight compared with the K-computer.\nThe real reason is the 30-times higher number of the processors and Amdahl’s law. And, of course: the efficiency depends on the task, more precisely on the amount of communication the task requires. As the careful analysis enabled to conclude [ref]23, the mentioned\n’inherently non-parallelizable contribution’  [ref]20 of the task\neffectively represents a resource that limits the achievable performance, so the popular ’roofline model’ \ncan also be applied [ref]23 to the achievable performance of the parallelized systems, see Fig. 3.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: could not achieve 200. According to that stage,\none considered the major bottleneck to be the software contribution\n(like initialization, thread creation), at that time correctly. It was stated [ref]8 that\n”the serial fraction, s, in most applications does not remain constant but is a diminishing function of the problem size, Amdahl’s law does not apply directly when the problem is scaled”.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
