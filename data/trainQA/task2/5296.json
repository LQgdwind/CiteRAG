Rather than reducing the classification result of a particular node, [ref]54 attacked the overall performance of node classification tasks through meta learning method. Moreover,  0 studied the vulnerability of unsupervised node embedding models. Defense methods against adversarial attacks.\nDefense on neural networks is much harder compared with attacks (). Currently, most of the defense methods are based on (1) changing the architecture of deep learning models:  leveraged distillation training techniques and reduce the magnitude of gradients between the pre-softmax\nlayer (logits) and softmax outputs. 3 used the graph attention network (5) to harness information from a graph of peer samples to improve the robustness of network. (2) adversary training methods: 8 managed to augment the training dataset with adversarial examples.\n(3) data preprocessing: 9 hardened the deep learning models against adversarial perturbations on images through reducing the color depth and smoothing on spatial domain.   attempted to filter the adversarial noise of the input samples with autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) () respectively.\nAlthough those approaches are somehow effective, they still have some limitations and the task of defending against adversarial attacks is still challenging. In this paper we focus on detecting malicious edges in a graph under attack. There are also works aiming to directly defend the attacks and mitigate the effect of malicious edges . Comparisong with defense approaches, our detection approach is superior in two properties: first, detecting the malicious edge can help identify the attacker. For example, in the case of social network we can find out which user is adding the malicious link. Second, the defense approaches are usually more prone to adversarial attack, since they incorporate the defense mechanism in the model and are therefore easier to be attacked as a whole when the attacker has knowledge of such mechanism. Robust Graph Neural Networks.\nConsidering that the threat of adversarial attacks on GNNs is newly emereged, the research with regard to defense methods on graph neural networks is limited.  proposes a certificate for GNN robustness under adversarial attack by changing node features.  proposes adversarial retraining pipeline to improve GNN model robustness and it also deals with node feature attack. The goal of these two works is different from ours since we are defending against graph structure attack. 8 also proposes an adversarial retraining pipeline to defend against graph structure attack. They evaluate over the meta attack and the retrained model still suffers from performance decrease.  proposes a GNN structure where each layer is no longer deterministic but a stochastic transformation layer. They show that using this structure the model performance will increase under adversarial structure attack. However, when the number of added edges increases the model will still fail. Anomaly detection on graphs.\nThere have been various researches on the topic of ‘Anomaly Detection’ or ‘Fraud Detection’ on graphs   . Note that the detection purpose is different from ours: anomaly detection on graphs aims to find nodes/edges that differ a lot from others. While the two proposed subtle adversarial attack on graphs appear to contain too small magnitude of perturbation to be detected, and here we focus on graph neural networks instead of general graph analysis. In addition,  studied on how to fit a good model over graph data when only one graph is available. They focus on the classification performance while our work focuses on the detection of malicious edges, and we have completely no supervision. Our work is going to defend against graphical network models by detecting malicious edges with original approaches.   propose virtual adversarial training on GNNs as a way to improve model performance but they do not evaluate their model against adversarial attack.\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: on edges, since the gradient attacking method is not easy to be used here.\nSo far there are several attacks proposed on graphs: some of the works attempted to attack the graph neural networks  [ref]53 [ref]54, as  proposed three attack methods on both node classification and graph classification problems and [ref]53 developed an attack method targeting on a particular node based on greedy\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
