      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Dynamic Movement Primitives - a survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the most important challenges in robotics is producing accurate trajectories and controlling their dynamic parameters so that the robots can perform different tasks. The ability to provide such motion control is closely related to how such movements are encoded. The researchers explored different representations. First representations relied on spline curves , which were used in tasks such as the recreation of arm movements , or play Kendama . While such representation allowed to reproduce certain movements, it lacked the flexibility to consider the time dimension , take into account perturbations , and learn which control variables should be imitated and why [ref]6. To mitigate such shortcomings, new approaches were developed, using Hidden Markov Models  , Gaussian Mixture Models , Neural Networks , graph representations 0 1, and Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) 2 3. The idea behind the Dynamic Movement Primitives was to develop a set of motion primitives that could be composed of more complex movements. They can be understood as a pattern generator, linear in its parameters, and invariant under rescaling 4. Each primitive is defined so that it can be adjusted without manual parameter tuning or introducing some instability. To that end, they have first defined a set of second-order differential equations to encode motion properties while taking into account possible perturbations 2 3. Furthermore, the equations provided for obstacle avoidance by encoding domain knowledge regarding working areas that must be avoided during the robot movements 5, and provide means to execute the segments of such movements at different speeds  [ref]6. Multiple approaches were researched to determine the Dynamic Movement Primitives’ parameters that determine the desired trajectory and task. One such approach is imitation learning, where an operator teaches the robot to perform a specific movement 6 7 8 9. The system can then generate a similar movement updating the scaling term to change the scope and duration of the movement 0. Another approach is the use of Reinforcement Learning. While an initial set of parameters can be learned from initial demonstrations, Reinforcement Learning can be used to learn how changes in those parameters influence the movements 1. Furthermore, Reinforcement Learning can be used to learn movement shapes without prior knowledge, ensuring the right policies are used. Among such methods we find the Natural Actor-Critic (NAC 4), the Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI2 2), and Policy learning by Weighting Explorations with the Returns, (PoWER, 3). The Dynamic Movement Primitives were successfully applied to encode periodic and discrete movements 4 5, in a wide variety of use cases, such as pick a glass of liquid 7, kick a ball 9, or perform some drumming [ref]6. While Dynamic Movement Primitives have shown value in representing complex movements, it has been noted that while they have been widely researched for trajectory-based skills, they were seldom applied to in-contact tasks 6. Furthermore, it has been shown that the Dynamic Movement Primitives do not generalize well 7, and articulating multiple Dynamic Movement Primitives into complex motion sequences remains a challenge 1 8. This research does not mean to provide an exhaustive survey on Dynamic Movement Primitives. For that purpose, we defer the reader to the survey on this topic by Saveriano et al. 9. Nevertheless, we describe related work that attempts to solve the issues mentioned above by using neural networks and complement the survey regarding the use of neural networks and reinforcement learning for Dynamic Movement Primitives.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: allowed to reproduce certain movements, it lacked the flexibility to consider the time dimension , take into account perturbations , and learn which control variables should be imitated and why [ref]6.
