      "content": "Paper Title: FuSS: Fusing Superpixels for Improved Segmentation Consistency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRemote sensing acquisition technologies have been in constant development since the 1960s, providing sensors with a myriad of new electromagnetic spectral encoding capabilities and leading to a continuous increase in the volume of daily collected data. The development of these technologies, together with an increased capacity to produce relevant information for a wide range of applications, turned the automatic analysis of images into one of the most actively researched fields within the remote sensing community . Since the Gestalt movement, it is known that image segmentation and clustering plays an important role in human perception . Many different applications can benefit from semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, such as: urban planning/mapping and change detection , population estimation , real-estate management [ref]5. Traditional (closed set) semantic segmentation (SSeg) for remote sensing imagery has become a complex, time-consuming, and well-studied task. Many different methods have been developed to solve this problem: FCN [ref]6, U-Net , SegNet , among others. In recent years, many models have significantly improved the quality of semantic segmentation  0. To enable the use of SSeg models in practical situations, it is crucial to improve the semantic and spatial consistency of the resultant segmentation.\nAccording to Sekkal et al. 1, it is important for the regions to remain coherent with the original content and the better detection of contours leads to an efficient pseudo-semantic representation. In closed-set SSeg, both the training and test data share the same label and feature spaces. However, in more realistic scenarios unseen classes may show up on the deploy phase of the model. This is the case for most real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis or treatment, and remote sensing tasks. The existence of unknown classes undermines the robustness of the existing closed set methods, as stated by Geng et al. 2. For the last couple of years, methods that extend traditional closed set SSeg were proposed to automatically recognize samples from unseen classes. This new task, named Open Set Segmentation (OSS),\nmust be able to correctly segment pixels of classes available during training (Known Known Classes – KKCs), while also being able to recognize unknown pixels that come from classes that were not present during training (Unknown Unknown Classes – UUCs) 3. The goal of the current paper is to improve the semantic consistency of previously obtained results OSS algorithms for remote sensing images. In order to improve segmentation consistency, we introduce in this work a novel method called OpenGMM based on previously proposed frameworks for OSR 3 4. Oliveira et al. 3 employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in the OpenPCS method as a generative model, assuming it would be sufficient for the representation of the data. As data in the real world can rarely be represented by unimodal distributions, our proposed approach adopts a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) 5 6 instead of PCA, allowing the use of multimodal distributions for modeling KKCs with the objective of improving the out-of-distribution (OOD) identification. The lack of semantic consistency produced by OpenPCS, specially in objects borders, can be seen in Figure 1. Threshold methods like OpenPCS presents difficulties in correctly delimiting the edges between objects making these kind of OSS approaches not likely to be used in real world scenarios. To address this issue and improve the final results we studied ways to add a post-process using Superpixel Segmentation (SPS) with qualitative results shown in Figure 1, the post processed OSS is closer to the ground truth and many generated artifacts were removed. Superpixels are a oversegmentation of an image and played an important role in the process of traditional segmentation, and acoording to Lin et al. 7 are a low-level image information subdivisions. As stated by 8 9 0 the use of superpixels: allows for a richer feature representation for each segment (textural, color, scatter, gradient-based, statistic, orientation); reduces the size of the classification problem since many pixels could be represented by each cluster; even being an oversegmentation of the image the superpixel clustering produces homogeneous regions that adds semantics to each superpixel. Superpixels are a homogeneous and contiguous group of pixels in an image extracting perceptually relevant regions 8. The segmentation generated with superpixels reduces the input size, while preserving the semantic content needed to address intended tasks 9. Our framework employs a novel superpixel merge procedure using Malahanobis distance 1, called Fusing Superpixels for Segmentation (FuSS). A graphical illustration of our pipeline’s inner workings can be seen in Figure 1. We tested our approach on OSS using three distinct algorithms: OpenPCS 3, CoReSeg 2 and the newly proposed OpenGMM. Our pipeline seeks to improve the semantic consistency of the results in order to make OSS models more suitable for practical use. Our contributions can be summarized as: The proposal of OpenGMM, a novel method aiming to improve upon the previously proposed OSS framework by Oliveira et al. 3; The proposal of a superpixel post-processing method that yielded results with superior semantic consistency and improved Receiver Operating Characteristic metrics in all tested scenarios; A novel superpixel segmentation fusion procedure using Malahanobis distance 1; State of the Art OSS results for the Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets111https://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm2/wg4/benchmark/ using our post-processing segmentation technique; This manucript is organized as follows: Section II presents previous OSS strategies and related work on superpixels for semantic segmentation; Section III describes the proposed methods; Section IV introduces the experimental setup used for this work, along with the employed datasets and metrics; Section V presents exploratory tests executed on Vaihingen dataset; Section VI presents the obtained results; and Section VII exposes the conclusions over the proposed methods and the achieved results.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: .
