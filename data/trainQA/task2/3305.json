      "content": "Paper Title: Quasi-Framelets: Another Improvement to Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe recent decade has witnessed graph neural networks (GNNs), as a deep representation learning method for graph data, have aroused considerable research interests. Duvenaud et al. [ref]7 and Kipf & Welling  delivered the GCN (Graph Convolution Networks) with significantly improved performance on the semi-supervised node classification tasks, since then a large number of GNN variants have been proposed, including GAT [ref]25, GraphSAGE [ref]9, GIN , and DGI . The empirical successes of GNNs in both node-level and graph-level tasks have prompted the need of well understanding in a systematic and theoretical way. For example, PPNP and APPNP  try to establish a connection between\nthe graph convolution operator of GCN and the Graph-regularized graph signal processing. The graph-regularized layer has been recently exploited to signal denoising, node and edge attack .\nHowever, researchers have also found that one of pitfalls of GNNs is its performance degradation due to oversmoothing with deep layers . Hong and Maehara  shew that GNNs only perform low-pass filtering on original node feature vectors. The two main streams of designing GNNs are the graph spatial view (such as message passing see ) and the graph spectral view (such as via graph Laplacian spectral decomposition) . Under the graph spectral view, one makes use of graph convolutions known from spectral graph theory. The graph signals are mapped into the graph spectral domain under the Fourier framework, then appropriate filters either pre-defined or learned are applied on the signals, and finally filtered spectral signals will be either reconstructed back to the spatial or piped straightaway to the next networks for further processing. In the spectral paradigm, different spectral GNNs differs in the way how to regulate signals through spectral filters in spectral domain. All these can be clustered as two major approaches: (1) The learning approach and (2) The approach of applying mathematically designed filters.\nFor example, under the first approach, Defferrard et al.  utilize K-order Chebyshev polynomials to approximate smooth filters in the spectral domain. Kipf and Welling  propose a spectral approach where a graph convolutional network is designed via a localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions. Under the second approach, for example, Li et al.  introduce Haar basis to solve high computational cost of eigen-decompositions of graph Laplacian which allows scalability of graphs. The concept of wavelet frames has been developed for a long time  and shows a wide range of applications like signal processing and filter bank design. The wavelet transformation has been constructed on graphs based on defining scaling using the spectral decomposition of the discrete graph Laplacian  and applied in image processing . In applications, understanding graphs from a multiscale or multiresolution perspective is critical in acquiring structure of graph networks. Ying et al.  proposed a multiresolution graph neural network to build a hierarchical graph representation. For the purpose of multiresolution graph signal representation and analysis, by combining tight wavelet frames and spectral graph theory, Dong  develops tight graph framelets and shows an efficient and accurate representation of graphs. In this approach, the built-in mathematical tight framelets are applied on the spectral domain of graph Laplacian to achieve the filtering purpose. As demonstrated in , the framelets can take care of regulating low-pass and high-pass information from graph signals simultaneously to achieve better than state-of-the-art performance. Both the learning approach and the mathematically designed approach have been successful in many graph learning tasks. However there are couple of explicit limitation in terms of graph signal filtering. The learning approach leaves the filtering capability entirely to the end-to-end learning from data. In some sense this may be too sensitive to data change. While applying those mathematically built-in wavelets or framelets to filtering in spectral domain in the second approach, the power of filters have been fixed due to the mathematical design. This is not flexible in the case when one wishes to clearly cut off certain spectral information. This paper will propose a way in between the above approaches by directly designing filtering functions in the spectral domain. While the new method still has learning capacity through filter learning, thus it does offer the flexibility in cutting-off specific spectral information. All the aforementioned approaches focus on homogeneous graphs where nodes and edges are of the same types respectively. As a matter of fact, the real-world graphs, such as social networks and academic networks, show nodes and edges of multiple types. In order to capture the heterogeneity of these graphs, heterogeneous graph neural networks have been introduced and some research have been explored for mining the information hidden in these heterogeneous graphs. Heterogeneous graphs can characterize complex graphs and contain rich semantics. Most existing heterogeneous GNN models, such as HAN , HGT  and HGCN  extend message-passing graph neural network framework to perform spatial-based graph convolutions on heterogeneous graphs. Through projecting features of various types of nodes onto a common feature space, these heterogeneous GNN models implement message passing directly from spatially close neighbors. Further, measuring the spatially closeness takes semantic information, which are defined by meta-paths or meta-graphs, into consideration. However, the spectral-based methods have been far behind explored on heterogenous graphs. One of typical ways to deal with heterogeneous graphs (as done in literature) is to convert a heterogeneous graph into several homogeneous subgraphs. For example, consider the academic network with authors (A), papers (P), venues (V), organizations (O) as nodes. The meta-path “APA” representing the coauthor relationships on a paper\n(P) between two authors (A) defines a homogeneous subgraph, and similarly the meta-path “APVPA” representing two authors (A) publishing papers (P) in the same venue (V) defines another homogeneous subgraph. Then one simply applies the classic GNNs like GCNs on such subgraphs. This construction can suffer from the fact that a cohort of high frequency Laplacian eigenvectors may contain meaningful information jointly, i.e., multiresolution structures. However the current approaches used in embedding heterogeneous graphs may not be able to access this information. As the homogeneous subgraphs comes from several chosen meta-path types and those relevant graph Laplacian may carry multiresolution structure information. A naïve application of message passing may ingore such mutliresolition pattern. In fact, a framelet-assisted GNN will benefit incorporating such mutliresolution pattern for heterogeneous graphs. This is one of major motivations we explore the application of framelet transformation on heterogeneous graphs. In summary, our contributions in this paper are in five-fold: To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to introduce frametlet-based convolutions on heterogeneous graph neural network. The proposed framelet convolution leverages framelet transforms to decompose graph data into low-pass and high-pass spectra in a fine-tuned multiscale way, which shows superior performance in preserving node feature information and graph geometric information and to achieve a fast decomposition and reconstruction algorithm. We propose a new way of designing multiscale framelets from spectral perspective. The new way offers both learning capacity and flexibility in e.g. cutting-off unwanted spectral information. The experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance. We demonstrate that the framelet construction no longer rely on the multiple finite filter banks in the spatial domain. This leaves the room for designing any specific framelets as appropriate for meaningful frequency suppression. We theoretically prove that the new system has all the theoretical properties of the classic framelets such as the fast algorithm in decomposition and reconstruction. The results of extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of node representation learnt by our model and show the superiority of the model prediction performance against state-of-the-art methods.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: The recent decade has witnessed graph neural networks (GNNs), as a deep representation learning method for graph data, have aroused considerable research interests.
