      "content": "Paper Title: The Annotated Dependency Pair Framework for Almost-Sure Termination of Probabilistic Term Rewriting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTerm rewrite systems (TRSs) are used in many areas of computer science, like symbolic computation, automated theorem proving, and automated analysis ofprograms in different languages.\nTermination is one of the most crucial properties of programs, and numerous tools have been developed to analyze termination of TRSs, e.g., AProVE , Matchbox 9, MultumNonMulta , MU-TERM , NaTT , NTI , TTT2 , etc.\nOne of the most powerful techniques integrated in essentially all current termination tools for TRSs is the dependency pair (DP) framework    1 2 which allows modular proofs that apply different techniques in different sub-proofs. The DP framework also allows for certification of proofs.\nTo this end, its key techniques have been formalized in several proof assistants (e.g.,    ) and there exist several corresponding certification tools, e.g., CeTA . Probabilistic programs describe randomized algorithms and probability distributions, with applications in many areas, see, e.g., 7.\nFor instance, well-known examples are variants of the probabilistic quicksort algorithm, see, e.g., Sect. 6.\nIf one uses a version where every list element has the same probability of becoming the next pivot element, then the algorithm has an expected runtime of 𝒪​(n⋅log⁡(n))\\mathcal{O}(n\\cdot\\log(n)), for every possible input list of length nn.\nIn contrast, for a non-probabilistic version of quicksort, there always exists a “worst-case” input of length nn such that the algorithm takes at least 𝒪​(n2)\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}) steps.\nSeveral probabilistic programming languages have been developed.\nAn example isthe probabilistic guarded command language (pGCL)  [ref]46, whose basic form however cannot express arbitrary data structures.\nIn contrast, TRSs are especially suitable for modeling and analyzing algorithms like quicksort that operate on (user-defined) data structures like lists, and they were first extended to probabilistic term rewrite systems (PTRSs) in  . In the probabilistic setting, there are several notions of “termination”.\nOne of the most important notions is almost-sure termination (𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}), which means that the probability of termination is 11.\nA strictly stronger notion is positive 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} (𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST}), which requires that the expected runtime is finite.\nMoreover, there are several different rewrite strategies.\nFor example, innermost rewriting only allows rewrite steps at innermost positions in a term.\nThis strategy is the easiest to analyze for termination, and it corresponds to a call-by-value strategy as used by many programming languages.\nThus, in this paper we will not only investigate 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} for PTRSs, but we also consider innermost 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} (𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST}, allowing only innermost rewrite sequences). As a running example in the first part of thispaper (Sect. 1 - 4), we transform Alg. 1 on the right (written in pGCL) into an equivalent PTRS and show how our framework proves 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}.\nNote that while Alg. 1 is 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}, its expected runtime is infinite, i.e., it is not 𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST}.111This already holds for the program where only the first possibility of the first while-loop is considered (i.e., where yy is always doubled in its body).\nThen for the initial value y=1y=1, the expected number of iterations of the second while-loop which decrements yy is 12⋅2+14⋅4+18⋅8+…=1+1+1+…=∞\\tfrac{1}{2}\\cdot 2+\\tfrac{1}{4}\\cdot 4+\\tfrac{1}{8}\\cdot 8+\\ldots=1+1+1+\\ldots=\\infty.\nHere, ⊕1/2\\oplus_{\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}} denotes probabilistic choice, and □\\square denotes demonic non-determinism.\nThere exist numerous techniques to prove (𝙿\\mathtt{P})𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} of imperative programs on numbers like Alg. 1 (e.g., 4    3 5 8 6 3   ).\nIn fact, there are proof rules (e.g., ) and tools (e.g., ) that can prove 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} for both loops of Alg. 1 individually, and hence for the whole algorithm.\nMoreover, the tool Caesar \ncan prove 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} if one provides super-martingales for the two loops.\nHowever, there are only few automated methods available to analyze (𝙿)​𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{(P)AST} for programs with complex non-tail recursive structure  5 6.\nThe approaches that are suitable for algorithms on recursive data structures 0  \nare mostly tailored to specific structures, making it challenging to adapt them to other (possibly user-defined) data structures, or are not yet fully automated.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there exist no automatic techniques to handle algorithms similar to Alg. 1\nthat operate on arbitrary algebraic data structures, i.e., (non-deterministic) algorithms that first create a random data object yy in a first loop and then access or modify it in a second loop using auxiliary functions, whereas this is possible with our annotated dependency pair\nframework.222Such examples can be found in our benchmark set, see Sect. 6\nand App. A.\nIn this paper we develop an approach for fully automatic termination analysis of (arbitrary) probabilistic TRSs that can successfully analyze probabilistic programs like the probabilistic quicksort algorithm mentioned above. Up to now, there were only two approaches for automatic termination analysis of PTRSs.\nIn , orders based on interpretations were adapted to prove 𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST}, and we presented a related technique to prove 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} in 6.\nHowever, already for non-probabilistic TRSs such a direct application of orders is limited in power.\nTo obtain a powerful approach, one should combine such orders in a modular way, as in the DP framework.\nThus, we presented a first version of a probabilistic DP framework for innermost rewriting in 6.\nHowever, in contrast to the DP framework for ordinary TRSs, the framework of 6 was incomplete, i.e., there are PTRSs which are 𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST} but where this cannot be proved with DTs.\nMoreover, the framework of 6 is disadvantageous for an extension by transformational processors (see Sect. 5). Therefore, in this paper we introduce the new concept of annotated dependency pairs (ADPs) to analyze termination of PTRSs.\nIn this way, we obtain a novel complete criterion for 𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST} via DPs while maintaining soundness for all processors that were developed in the probabilistic framework of 6.\nMoreover, our improvement allows for additional more powerful “transformational” probabilistic DP processors which were not possible in the framework of 6. In 8 we showed that there exist classes of PTRSs where it suffices to analyze 𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST} in order to prove 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} for full rewriting.\nHowever, these classes are quite restrictive (they exclude PTRSs with non-probabilistic non-determinism and impose linearity restrictions on both sides of the rewrite rules).\nThus, up to now there were no powerful techniques to prove full 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} for more general forms of PTRSs.\nTherefore, in the current paper we show that our ADP framework can also be adapted to analyze full (instead of innermost) 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}.\nIn particular, our novel ADP framework can also be applied to prove 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} for overlapping PTRSs and it weakens the linearity requirements considerably. We start with preliminaries on (probabilistic) term rewriting and recapitulate the most important notions of the DP framework for non-probabilistic TRSs in Sect. 2.\nThen, we present our novel ADPs for probabilistic TRSs in Sect. 3.\nIn Sect. 4, we explain the general idea of the probabilistic ADP framework, and present its fundamental processors.\nIn addition, our framework allows for the definition of new processors which transform ADPs.\nTo increase its power, we extend the probabilistic ADP framework by transformational processors in Sect. 5.\nThe implementation of our approach in the tool AProVE is evaluated in Sect. 6.\nIn App. A,\nwe illustrate our approach on several examples, including PTRSs with non-numerical data structures like lists or trees.\nWe refer to App. B for all proofs. The current paper is based on our earlier conference papers 9\nand , and it extends them by: A unified formalization and presentation of the ADP framework with all processors for both innermost and full rewriting, whereas these strategies were previously handled in different frameworks for innermost 9 and full rewriting . A new more general version of the reduction pair processor\n(Sect. 4.4) that allows us to use arbitrary algebras where addition and the barycentric operation 𝔼\\mathbb{E} are defined (whereas this processor was restricted to polynomial interpretations in 9 ). A new processor based on the subterm criterion of 2 (Sect. 4.6) in the ADP framework for innermost 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}. A new discussion and counterexamples to show why the linearity requirement is needed for the rewriting processor in the ADP framework (Sect. 5.1). A new instantiation processor (Sect. 5.2), which is applicable both in the ADP framework for full and innermost 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}. A new forward instantiation processor (Sect. 5.3), which is also applicable in the ADP framework for full and innermost 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}. A new rule overlap instantiation processor (Sect. 5.4), which is applicable in the ADP framework for innermost 𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}. Numerous additional explanations, examples, and remarks.
