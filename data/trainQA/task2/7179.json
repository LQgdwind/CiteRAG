      "content": "Paper Title: AIGCBench: Comprehensive Evaluation of Image-to-Video Content Generated by AI\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nArtificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) encompasses a wide array of applications that leverage AI technologies to automate the creation or editing of content across different media types, such as text, images, audio, and video. With the rapid advancement of diffusion models [ref]36     and multimodal AI technologies , the AIGC field is experiencing considerable and rapid progress. The explosive growth of AIGC has made its evaluation and benchmarking an urgent task. A representative application of AIGC is video generation [ref]35 [ref]13   . Current video generation includes Text-to-Video (T2V), Image-to-Video (I2V), Video-to-Video (V2V), as well as a few other works that utilize additional information such as depth , pose , trajectory , and frequency  to generate videos. Among these, T2V and I2V are the two most mainstream tasks at present. Early video generation primarily used text prompts to generate videos and achieved good results  [ref]35 [ref]13    . However, using text alone makes it difficult to depict the specific scenes that users want. Recently, I2V has ignited the AIGC community. The I2V task refers to the generation of a dynamic, moving video sequence based on a static input image and is usually accompanied by a text prompt 111However, the community often refers to it as Image-to-Video, rather than Text-Image-to-Video.. Compared to T2V, I2V can better define the content of video generation, achieving excellent results in many scenarios such as film, e-commerce advertising, and micro-animation effects. While benchmarks for the T2V task have seen notable progress   , benchmarks for the I2V task have scarcely advanced.\nPrevious efforts like Latent Flow Diffusion Models (LFDM)  and CATER-GEN  were tested under domain-specific video scenarios. VideoCrafter  and I2VGen-XL 8 only utilized visual comparisons for the I2V task. Seer  and Stable Video Diffusion (SVD)  employed video-text datasets and utilized a few metrics that require reference videos. Existing I2V benchmarks suffer from 1) a lack of diverse, open-domain images222Open-domain images refer to images that cover a wide variety of subjects or topics without specific restrictions on the content or category. with various subjects and styles to test the efficacy of different state-of-the-art algorithms;\n2) an absence of a unified consensus on which evaluation metrics should be used to assess the final generated results. From the perspective of 7, these two shortcomings hinder the capability of capturing stakeholders’ concerns and interests, while also failing to construct equivalent evaluation conditions. To address this gap, we present AIGCBench, a unified benchmark for video generation tasks. AIGCBench aims to encapsulate all mainstream video generation tasks, such as T2V, I2V, V2V, and the synthesis of video from additional modalities like depth, pose, trajectory, and frequency. We present an overview of AIGCBench in Figure 1. Our AIGCBench is divided into three modules: the evaluation dataset, the evaluation metrics, and the video generation models to be assessed. Considering the high relevance and interconnectivity 333The interconnectivity arises because some algorithms have the capability to perform multiple types of video generation tasks. of video generation tasks, our AIGCBench can enable the comparison of different algorithms under equivalent evaluation conditions. This allows for an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of different state-of-the-art video generation algorithms, thereby aiding progress in the field of video generation. In the first version of our AIGCBench, we address the current lack of a reasonable benchmark for I2V tasks by providing a thorough evaluation for them. In subsequent versions, we plan to include more video generation tasks and place them under equivalent evaluation conditions for a fair comparison. Recognizing the limitations of existing benchmarks, AIGCBench is engineered to meet the diverse demands of users looking to animate a broad array of static images. Where previous benchmarks have fallen short, not fully accommodating the expansive range of images users might choose to animate — such as a blue dragon skateboarding in Times Square — AIGCBench rises to the challenge. We address this by deploying a text combiner to generate a rich assortment of text prompts that span a multitude of subjects, behaviors, backgrounds, and artistic styles. Further refining the creative process, we employ the advanced capabilities of GPT-4 7 to enhance the text prompts, rendering them more vivid and intricate. These detailed prompts then guide the generation of images through state-of-the-art Text-to-Image diffusion models. By judiciously blending video-text and image-text datasets, along with our generated image-text pairs, AIGCBench ensures a robust and comprehensive evaluation of an array of I2V algorithms, thus addressing the first major shortcoming identified in existing benchmarks. To establish a comprehensive and standardized set of evaluation metrics for video generation tasks that cater to mainstream tasks such as T2V and I2V, our AIGCBench evaluates four critical dimensions: control-video alignment, motion effects, temporal consistency, and video quality, thereby capturing every aspect of video generation. This integrated framework combines metrics that are both reference video-based and video-free metrics, enhancing the benchmark’s rigor without exclusively relying on video-text datasets or image-text datasets alone. We strengthen this approach by incorporating image-text datasets into our evaluations, which allows us to assess content beyond the scope of existing video-text datasets and add reference video-free metrics for assessment. Considering the complexity and diversity of tasks, we believe that the evaluation metrics should cover at least these four aspects. For each aspect, we aim to use both reference video-based and video-free metrics. After satisfying these categorizations, the benefits of increasing the number of metrics become marginal, while it is insufficient without covering these aspects. The experimental results demonstrate that our evaluation standard correlates well with human ratings, confirming its effectiveness. Following a thorough evaluation, we present the strengths and weaknesses of each model, alongside several insightful findings, in hopes of spurring discussions that advance the I2V field. Our contributions are as follows: We introduce AIGCBench, a benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of diverse video generation tasks, with an initial focus on Image-to-Video (I2V) generation and a commitment to placing these models under equivalent evaluation conditions for fair comparison. We extend our image-text dataset using a text combiner and GPT-4, complemented by state-of-the-art Text-to-Image models to generate high-quality images, enabling a deeper evaluation of I2V algorithm performance; We evaluate I2V algorithms comprehensively using both reference video-based and video-free metrics across four aspects and verify the validity of our proposed evaluation standard with human judgment; We offer several insightful findings to aid the better development of the I2V community.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: that leverage AI technologies to automate the creation or editing of content across different media types, such as text, images, audio, and video.
