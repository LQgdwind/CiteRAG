      "content": "Paper Title: On the Privacy Risks of Algorithmic Recourse\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur first data set is the Adult (A) data set  that originates from the 1994 Census database, consisting of 14 attributes and 48,842 instances. The class label indicates whether an individual has an income greater than 50,000 USD/year. Second, we use the Home Equity Line of Credit (Heloc) (H) data set (d=23ùëë23d=23). Here, the target variable records a score indicating whether individuals will repay the Heloc account within a fixed time window. Across both tasks we consider individuals in need of recourse if their scores lies below the median score across the entire data set, thresholding the scores based on the median to obtain binary target labels.\nThird, we use the Diabetes (D) data set which contains information on diabetic patients from 130 different US hospitals .\nThe patients are described using administrative (e.g., length of stay) and medical records (e.g., test results) (d=42ùëë42d=42), and the prediction task is concerned with identifying whether a patient will be readmitted within the next 30 days.\nIn line with [ref]34, we sub sampled smaller data sets of 10000 points from each of these datasets. 5000 points are left to the model owner to train the their private model, while another 5000 data points are used by the adversary to train their shadow models when applicable. Additionally, we follow Shokri et¬†al. [ref]34 and generate synthetic data sets from the sklearn library.\nFor dùëëd features the method randomly chooses a vertex from the dùëëd-dimensional hypercube as a center for each of the classes, and samples Gaussian distributed random variables centered at the vertex with unit variance. For the linear model experiments, we use d‚àà{100,1000,5000,7000}ùëë100100050007000d\\in\\{100,1000,5000,7000\\} with n=5000ùëõ5000n=5000 training and test samples.\nFor the non-linear models we use d‚àà{50,150}ùëë50150d\\in\\{50,150\\}. Recourse Algorithms and Predictive Models.\nWe apply our techniques to three different methods which aim to generate low-cost recourses using different principles: SCFE is the method suggested by Wachter et¬†al.  and uses a gradient-based objective to find recourses, GS conducts a random search for recourse in the input space [ref]18, and CCHVAE [ref]24 searches for recourse in a lower dimensional latent space using a generative model to encourage recourses to lie on the data manifold.\nAll methods use a ‚Ñì1subscript‚Ñì1\\ell_{1}-regularizer to encourage sparse recourses.\nWe use implementations from the CARLA library .\nFor all data sets, we trained a fully connected neural network with one hidden layer and 1000 nodes.\nThe network uses ReLU activation functions and are trained using the ADAM optimizer.\nThe network is trained for 250 epochs.\nAcross all tasks, we use a learning rate of 0.0001.\nAll recourses were generated with respect to this classifier.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: of stay) and medical records (e.g., test results) (d=42ùëë42d=42), and the prediction task is concerned with identifying whether a patient will be readmitted within the next 30 days.\nIn line with [ref]34, we sub sampled smaller data sets of 10000 points from each of these datasets. 5000 points are left to the model owner to train the their private model, while another 5000 data points are\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
