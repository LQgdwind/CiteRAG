      "content": "Paper Title: Gibbs Sampling with People\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHumans continuously extract semantic representations\nfrom complex perceptual inputs, re-expressing them as meaningful information that can be efficiently communicated to primary cognitive processes such as memory, decision-making, and language   . Effective semantic representation seems to be a prerequisite for intelligent behavior, and is correspondingly a core topic of study in both cognitive science and machine learning 4  . One way of studying semantic representations in humans is to present participants with stimuli that exhaustively sample from a stimulus space (e.g., the space of visible colors) and ask them\nto evaluate these stimuli\n(e.g., ).\nUnfortunately, this method works poorly for high-dimensional stimuli whose parameter spaces are too large to explore exhaustively. An alternative approach is to hand-construct stimulus sets to test specific hypotheses about semantic representations (e.g., that slow melodies tend to sound sad, [ref]28);\nhowever, this approach relies heavily on prior domain knowledge, and is poorly suited to exploratory research. Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People (MCMCP) addresses this problem   .\nMCMCP takes as input a stimulus space (e.g., visible colors)\nand a target semantic category (e.g., ‘danger’).\nIn each trial, participants are presented with two stimuli\nand are asked which comes from the category.\nBy virtue of MCMCP’s adaptive procedure,\nstimulus selection becomes progressively biased\ntowards parts of the stimulus space that represent the category.\nThe resulting process iteratively characterizes the\nsubjective mapping\nbetween the stimulus space and the semantic concept\nfor a given participant or participant group.\nThe technique provides a way for cognitive scientists to systematically quantify subjective aspects of perception,\nfor example the way in which participants from a\nparticular musical culture hear certain chords as ‘consonant’,\nor the way in which participants have certain subjective ideas\nof what a ‘serious’ face looks like.\nThe approach has been shown to outperform reverse correlation, a related non-adaptive method for mapping semantic categories to perceptual spaces . According to the underlying theory, MCMCP converges asymptotically to the participant’s internal probabilistic representation of a given semantic category within a stimulus space . However, its practical convergence rate is limited for several reasons. The first concerns the response interface: MCMCP is traditionally limited to binary choice responses, which can only provide a small amount of information per trial (1 bit), much less than the theoretical limit of other response interfaces (e.g., sliders). The second depends on the proposal function that generates successive stimuli: a too-narrow proposal function makes the process slow to find the modes of the distribution, whereas a too-wide proposal function makes it harder for the process to estimate the mode with much precision 2 . Here we present a new technique for addressing these problems, termed Gibbs Sampling with People (GSP). While MCMCP corresponds to a human instantiation of the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC sampler, GSP corresponds to a human instantiation of a Gibbs sampler.\nCrucially, unlike 3, GSP has participants respond with a continuous slider rather than a binary choice. This has two effects: first, it substantially increases the upper bound of information per trial, and second, it eliminates the need to calibrate a proposal function.\nWe further show how GSP can be formulated in utility theory, thereby generalizing the approach from discrete to continuous semantic representations, and we show how GSP can be shifted towards deterministic optimization through an aggregation process.\n This paper continues with a review of MCMCP and a theoretical account of GSP.\nWe then describe four studies applying GSP to various visual and auditory domains, ranging from simple low-dimensional problems to complex high-dimensional problems parameterized by deep neural networks.\nThese studies include experiments directly implementing GSP and MCMCP, control experiments investigating different hyperparameters, and validation experiments for the generated outputs. All combined, these 25 experiments represent data from 5,178 human participants.111Appendices, code, and raw data are hosted at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/RZK4S.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: too large to explore exhaustively.
