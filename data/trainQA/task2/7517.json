Emotions – intricate mental states crucial in decision-making, planning, reasoning, and other mental activities  – can manifest in physical behaviors such as facial expressions, speech, gestures, and eye movements; as well as in physiological signals obtained from the central and peripheral nervous system  . Electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and cameras are tools for recording data streams potentially conveying emotion-related patterns  . Of particular concern to the present study, incremental learning algorithms and granular neural networks are well-suited approaches to handle the inherent uncertainty and non-stationarity of data stream scenarios  . For example, humans may intentionally conceal emotions or express them in diverse and uncertain ways [ref]8. Moreover, weakly labeled instances, drifts, and noise impose challenges for an accurate and interpretable pattern classification model. The applications based on both non-physiological and physiological data are vast, encompassing various domains where machine learning and adaptive models contribute to decision-making support, mechatronics control, software development, virtual agents, and the enhancement of realism, efficiency, and interaction  . Specific examples include: (i) healthcare, in which emotion-related data are used for detecting fatigue, drowsiness, and pain related to neurological disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia [ref]8; (ii) in marketing, for evaluating the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and understanding consumers responses to products 0; (iii) in education, for obtaining insights into students’ comprehension and engagement 1; (iv) in brain-computer interfaces (BCI), for aiding the development of adaptive human-machine interactions 2; (v) in security, for detecting signs of stress and nervousness in critical situations 3; (vi) in games, for creating emotion-based adaptive scenarios and simulators  4. Developing emotion classifiers can enhance user experiences and facilitate human-machine communication.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: approaches to handle the inherent uncertainty and non-stationarity of data stream scenarios  .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
