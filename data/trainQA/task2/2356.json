Researchers are increasingly considering building complex neural networks on Riemannian space, in which the hyperbolic space with negative constant curvature is an attractive option  [ref]30. In many domains, such as sentences in natural language , social networks , biological protein graph [ref]30, etc., data usually have a tree-like structure or can be represented hierarchically, and hyperbolic space is equipped to model hierarchical structures naturally and effectively . Due to its strong representation ability, hyperbolic space has been applied in many application areas   [ref]35  . For instance, Liu et al.  proposed Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks used for graph representation learning by combining the expressiveness of hyperbolic space and Graph Convolutional Networks. Chen et al. [ref]35 proposed a hyperbolic interaction model for multi-label classification tasks. These works have shown the advantages and effectiveness of hyperbolic space in learning hierarchical structures of complex relational data. Noticing the potential of hyperbolic space in learning complex interactions between users and items, many researchers have tried to apply hyperbolic learning to recommendation systems [ref]38    . Chamberlain et al. [ref]38 proposed a large-scale recommender system based on the hyperbolic space, which can be scaled to millions of users.  considered constructing multiple hyperbolic manifolds to map the representation of user and ad, and proposed a framework that can effectively learn the hierarchical structure in users and ads based on the hyperbolic space. Ma et al.  proposed a recommendation model in the hyperbolic space for Top-K recommendation. Li et al.  presented the Hyperbolic Social Recommender which utilized hyperbolic geometry to boost the performance. Wang et al.  proposed a novel graph neural network framework (HyperSoRec) combing hyperbolic learning for the social recommendation.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: structure  .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
