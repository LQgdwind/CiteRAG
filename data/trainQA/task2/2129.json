      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforced Few-Shot Acquisition Function Learning for Bayesian Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne major challenge in designing an acquisition function for BO is to address the wide variability of black-box functions and accordingly achieve a favorable explore-exploit trade-off for each task.\nTo address this by deep Q-learning as described in Section 3.2, instead of learning a single Q-network as in the standard DQN , we propose to learn a distribution of Q-network parameters from a Bayesian inference perspective to achieve more robust exploration and more stable training.\nInspired by , we adapt the regularized minimization problem to Q-learning in order to connect Q-learning and Bayesian inference as follows.\nLet C​(θ)𝐶𝜃C(\\theta) be the cost function that depends on the model parameter θ𝜃\\theta.\nInstead of finding a single model, the Bayesian approach finds a distribution q​(θ)𝑞𝜃q(\\theta) over θ𝜃\\theta that minimizes the cost function augmented with a KL-regularization penalty, i.e., where q0subscript𝑞0q_{0} denotes a prior distribution over θ𝜃\\theta and α𝛼\\alpha is a weight factor of the penalty and DKL(⋅∥⋅)D_{\\text{KL}}(\\cdot\\;\\|\\;\\cdot) denotes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between two distributions.\nNote that q​(θ)𝑞𝜃q(\\theta) essentially induces a distribution over the sampling policies πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta}, and accordingly q0subscript𝑞0q_{0} can be interpreted as constructing a prior over the policies.\nBy setting the derivative of the objective in (2) with respect to the measure induced by q𝑞q to be zero, one can verify that the optimal solution to (2) is where Z𝑍Z is the normalizing factor.\nOne immediate interpretation of (3) is that q∗​(θ)superscript𝑞𝜃q^{*}(\\theta) can be viewed as the posterior distribution under the prior distribution q0​(θ)subscript𝑞0𝜃q_{0}(\\theta) and the likelihood exp⁡(−C​(θ)/α)𝐶𝜃𝛼\\exp(-C(\\theta)/\\alpha).\nTo adapt the KL-regularized minimization framework to value-based RL for BO, the proposed FSAF algorithm is built on the following design principles for C​(θ)𝐶𝜃C(\\theta) and q0​(θ)subscript𝑞0𝜃q_{0}(\\theta): Use mean-squared TD error as the cost function:\nRecall from Section 2 that the optimal Q-function is the fixed point of the Bellman optimality backup operation. Hence, we have ℬ​Q=Qℬ𝑄𝑄\\mathcal{B}Q=Q if and only if Q𝑄Q is the optimal Q-function.\nBased on this observation, one principled choice of C​(θ)𝐶𝜃C(\\theta) is the squared TD error under the operator ℬℬ\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}, i.e., ∥ℬ⁡Q−Q∥22superscriptsubscriptdelimited-∥∥ℬ𝑄𝑄22\\lVert\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}Q-Q\\rVert_{2}^{2}.\nMoreover, in practice, DQN typically incorporates a replay buffer ℛQsubscriptℛ𝑄\\operatorname{\\mathcal{R}}_{Q} (termed the Q-replay buffer) as well as a target Q-network to achieve better training stability .\nTherefore, we choose the cost function as where ρ𝜌\\rho denotes the underlying sample distribution of the replay buffer and θ−superscript𝜃\\theta^{-} is the parameter of the target Q-network111In (4), the cost function depends implicitly on the target network parameterized by θ−superscript𝜃\\theta^{-}. Despite this, as the target network is updated periodically from Q​(⋅,⋅;θ)𝑄⋅⋅𝜃Q(\\cdot,\\cdot;\\theta), for notational convenience we do not make explicit the dependence of the cost function on θ−superscript𝜃\\theta^{-} in the notation C​(θ)𝐶𝜃C(\\theta)..\nIn practice, the cost C​(θ)𝐶𝜃C(\\theta) is estimated by the empirical average over a mini-batch 𝒟𝒟\\operatorname{\\mathcal{D}} of samples (s,a,r,s′)𝑠𝑎𝑟superscript𝑠′(s,a,r,s^{\\prime}) drawn from the replay buffer, i.e.,\nC​(θ)≈C^​(θ)=1|𝒟|​∑(s,a,r,s′)∈𝒟((r+γ​maxa′∈𝒜⁡Q​(s′,a′;θ−))−Q​(s,a;θ))2𝐶𝜃^𝐶𝜃1𝒟subscript𝑠𝑎𝑟superscript𝑠′𝒟superscript𝑟𝛾subscriptsuperscript𝑎′𝒜𝑄superscript𝑠′superscript𝑎′superscript𝜃𝑄𝑠𝑎𝜃2C(\\theta)\\approx\\hat{C}(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{\\lvert\\operatorname{\\mathcal{D}}\\rvert}\\sum_{(s,a,r,s^{\\prime})\\in\\operatorname{\\mathcal{D}}}((r+\\gamma\\max_{a^{\\prime}\\in\\operatorname{\\mathcal{A}}}Q(s^{\\prime},a^{\\prime};\\theta^{-}))-Q(s,a;\\theta))^{2}. Construct an informative prior with the help of the existing acquisition functions: In (2), the KL-penalty with respect to a prior distribution is meant to encode prior domain knowledge as well as provide regularization that prevents the learned parameter from collapsing into a point estimate.\nOne commonly-used choice is a uniform prior (i.e., q​(θ)=c𝑞𝜃𝑐q(\\theta)=c for some positive constant c𝑐c), under which the KL-penalty reduces to the negative entropy of q𝑞q.\nGiven that BO is designed to optimize expensive-to-evaluate functions, it is therefore preferred to use a more informative prior for better sample efficiency.\nBased on the above, we propose to construct a prior with the help of a demo policy πDsubscript𝜋D\\pi_{\\text{D}} induced by existing popular AFs (e.g., EI or PI), which inherently capture critical information structure of the GP posterior.\nDefine a similarity indicator δ​(πθ,πD)𝛿subscript𝜋𝜃subscript𝜋D\\delta(\\pi_{\\theta},\\pi_{\\text{D}}) of πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta} and πDsubscript𝜋D\\pi_{\\text{D}} as where we slightly abuse the notation and let ρ𝜌\\rho denote the state distribution induced by the replay buffers.\nSince the term log⁡(πθ​(s,a))subscript𝜋𝜃𝑠𝑎\\log(\\pi_{\\theta}(s,a)) in (5) is the log-likelihood of that the action of πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta} matches that of πDsubscript𝜋D\\pi_{\\text{D}} at a state s𝑠s, δ​(πθ,πD)𝛿subscript𝜋𝜃subscript𝜋D\\delta(\\pi_{\\theta},\\pi_{\\text{D}}) reflects how similar the two policies are on average (with respect to the state visitation distribution of πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta}).\nAccordingly, we propose to design the prior q0​(θ)subscript𝑞0𝜃q_{0}(\\theta) to be As it is typically difficult to directly evaluate δ​(πθ,πD)𝛿subscript𝜋𝜃subscript𝜋D\\delta(\\pi_{\\theta},{\\pi_{\\text{D}}}) in practice, we construct another replay buffer ℛDsubscriptℛD\\operatorname{\\mathcal{R}}_{\\text{D}} (termed the demo replay buffer), which stores the state-action pairs produced under the state distribution ρ𝜌\\rho and the demo policy πDsubscript𝜋D{\\pi_{\\text{D}}}, and estimate δ​(πθ,πD)𝛿subscript𝜋𝜃subscript𝜋D\\delta(\\pi_{\\theta},\\pi_{\\text{D}}) by the empirical average over a mini-batch 𝒟′superscript𝒟′\\operatorname{\\mathcal{D}}^{\\prime} of state-action pairs drawn from the demo replay buffer, i.e., δ​(πθ,πD)≈δ^​(πθ,πD)=1|𝒟′|​∑(s,a)∈𝒟′log⁡(πθ​(s,a))𝛿subscript𝜋𝜃subscript𝜋D^𝛿subscript𝜋𝜃subscript𝜋D1superscript𝒟′subscript𝑠𝑎superscript𝒟′subscript𝜋𝜃𝑠𝑎\\delta(\\pi_{\\theta},\\pi_{\\text{D}})\\approx\\hat{\\delta}(\\pi_{\\theta},\\pi_{\\text{D}})=\\frac{1}{\\lvert\\operatorname{\\mathcal{D}}^{\\prime}\\rvert}\\sum_{(s,a)\\in\\operatorname{\\mathcal{D}}^{\\prime}}\\log(\\pi_{\\theta}(s,a)). Update the Q-networks by Stein variational gradient descent: The solution in (3) is typically intractable to evaluate and hence approximation is required.\nWe leverage the Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD), which is a general-purpose approach for Bayesian inference. Specifically, we build up N𝑁N instances of Q-networks (also called particles in the context of the variational methods) and update the parameters via Bayesian inference.\nLet θ(n)superscript𝜃𝑛\\theta^{(n)} denote the parameters of the n𝑛n-th Q-network and use ΘΘ\\Theta as a shorthand of {θ(n)}n=1Nsuperscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝜃𝑛𝑛1𝑁\\{\\theta^{(n)}\\}_{n=1}^{N}.\nUnder SVGD  and the prior described in (6), the Stein variational gradient of each particle can be derived as where k​(⋅,⋅)𝑘⋅⋅k(\\cdot,\\cdot) is a kernel function.\nAs mentioned above, in practice C​(θ)𝐶𝜃C(\\theta) and δ​(πθ,πD)𝛿subscript𝜋𝜃subscript𝜋D{\\delta}(\\pi_{\\theta},\\pi_{\\text{D}}) are estimated by the corresponding empirical C^​(θ)^𝐶𝜃\\hat{C}(\\theta) and δ^​(πθ,πD)^𝛿subscript𝜋𝜃subscript𝜋D\\hat{\\delta}(\\pi_{\\theta},\\pi_{\\text{D}}), respectively.\nLet g^(n)​(Θ)superscript^𝑔𝑛Θ\\hat{g}^{(n)}(\\Theta) denote the estimated Stein variational gradient based on C^​(θ)^𝐶𝜃\\hat{C}(\\theta) and δ^​(πθ,πD)^𝛿subscript𝜋𝜃subscript𝜋D\\hat{\\delta}(\\pi_{\\theta},\\pi_{\\text{D}}).\nAccordingly, the parameters of each Q-network are updated iteratively by SVGD as where η𝜂\\eta is the learning rate.\nFor ease of notation, we use ℳSVGD⁡(Θ,𝒟)subscriptℳSVGDΘ𝒟\\operatorname{\\mathcal{M}}_{\\text{SVGD}}(\\Theta,\\operatorname{\\mathcal{D}}) to denote the subroutine that applies one SVGD update of (8) to all Q-networks parameterized by ΘΘ\\Theta based on some dataset 𝒟𝒟\\operatorname{\\mathcal{D}}.\nNote that the update scheme in (8) serves as a natural candidate for the few-shot adaptation subroutine of the meta-learning framework described in Section 2.\nIn Section 3.3, we will put everything together and describe the full meta-learning algorithm of FSAF. The presented Bayesian DQN bears some high-level resemblance\nto the prior works [ref]29 [ref]30 [ref]31 , which are inspired by the classic principle of Thompson sampling for exploration.\nIn [ref]30 [ref]31, the Q-function is assumed to be linearly parameterized with a Gaussian prior on the parameters such that the posterior can be computed in closed form.\nOn the other hand, without imposing the linearity assumption, [ref]31 approximates the intractable posterior by maintaining an ensemble of Q-networks as a practical heuristic of Thompson sampling to DQN.\nDifferent from [ref]29 [ref]30 [ref]31, we approach Bayesian DQN through the principled framework of KL regularization for parametric Bayesian inference and solve it via SVGD, without any linearity assumption.\n starts from an entropy-regularized formulation for Q-learning and assumes that the target Q-value is drawn from a Gaussian model to obtain a tractable posterior from the perspective of variational inference.\nBy contrast, we do not rely on the Gaussian assumption and directly find the posterior by SVGD, and for more efficient training we consider a prior induced by an acquisition function.\nMore importantly, the presented Bayesian DQN naturally helps substantiate the few-shot learning framework described in Section 2 for BO.\n The regularized formulation in (2) has been extensively applied in the class of policy-based methods in RL.\nFor example, the entropy-regularized policy optimization  has been applied to enable a “soft version” of policy iteration, which gives rise to the popular soft Q-learning  and soft actor-critic algorithms .\nAnother example is the Stein variational policy gradient method , which connects the policy gradient methods with Bayesian inference.\nDifferent from the prior works, we take a different path to connect the value-based RL approach with Bayesian inference.\n The similarity indicator defined in (5) has a similar form as the loss term in some of the classic imitation learning algorithms. For example, given an expert policy πesubscript𝜋𝑒\\pi_{e}, DAgger  is designed to find a policy π′superscript𝜋′\\pi^{\\prime} that minimizes a surrogate loss 𝔼s⁡[ℓ​(s,πe)]subscript𝔼𝑠ℓ𝑠subscript𝜋𝑒\\operatorname{\\mathbb{E}}_{s}[\\ell(s,\\pi_{e})], where ℓ​(⋅,⋅)ℓ⋅⋅\\ell(\\cdot,\\cdot) is some loss function (e.g., 0-1 loss or hinge loss) that reflects the dissimilarity between π′superscript𝜋′\\pi^{\\prime} and πesubscript𝜋𝑒\\pi_{e}.\nDespite this high-level resemblance, one fundamental difference between (5) and imitation learning is that the demo policy πDsubscript𝜋D{\\pi_{\\text{D}}} is not a true expert in the sense that mimicking the behavior of πDsubscript𝜋D{\\pi_{\\text{D}}} is not the ultimate goal of the FSAF learning process.\nInstead, the goal of FSAF is to learn a policy that can better adapt to new tasks and thereby outperform the existing AFs in various domains.\nThe penalty defined in (6) is only meant to provide some prior domain knowledge to achieve more sample-efficient training. We further validate this design by providing training curves in Section 4.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: in Section 2.\nIn Section 3.3, we will put everything together and describe the full meta-learning algorithm of FSAF.
