      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforcement Learning-based Dialogue Guided Event Extraction to Exploit Argument Relations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEvent extraction    is a form of information representation to extract what users are interested in massive data and present it to users in a certain way.\nFor event extraction task, it can be divided into four subtasks: event classification, trigger identification, argument identification, and argument role classification.\nMost recent event extraction works are based on a neural network architecture like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  , Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\n [ref]5, Graph Neural Network (GNN)  , Transformer  , or other networks  .\nThe method of event extraction based on deep learning first adopts pipeline. The pipeline-based method    is the earliest event extraction based on neural networks and extracts event arguments by utilizing triggers.\nIt realizes event trigger identification, event classification, event argument identification, and argument role classification tasks successively  and takes the results of previous tasks as prior knowledge.\nThe first two tasks are usually called event detection and the last two tasks are called argument extraction.\nChen et al.  and Nguyen et al.   use the CNN model to capture sentence-level clues and overcome complex feature engineering compared with traditional feature-based approaches.\nDBRNN [ref]5 have been proved to be influential in introducing graph information into event extraction tasks.\nJMEE  is proposed with an attention-based GCN, learning syntactic contextual node representations through first-order neighbors of the graph.\nAs we all know, an argument usually plays different roles in different events, enhancing the difficulty of the event extraction task.\nYang et al.  propose a pre-trained language model-based event extractor  to learn contextualized representations proven helpful for event extraction. It separates argument predictions according to the roles and overcomes the argument overlap problem.\nHowever, this requires a high accuracy of trigger identification.\nA wrong trigger will seriously affect the accuracy of argument identification and argument role classification.\nTherefore, the pipeline based method considers the event trigger as the core of an event [ref]5   and requires high accuracy of event trigger identification, avoiding an adverse effect on event argument extraction.\nIn order to overcome the propagation of error information caused by event detection, joint-based event extraction methods are proposed.\nThe joint event extraction method avoids the influence of trigger identification error on event argument extraction.\nIt reduces the propagation of error information by combining trigger identification and argument extraction tasks. The existing event extraction corpus has a few labeled data and hard to expand, such as ACE 2005 with only 599 annotated documents .\nExisting deep learning-based approaches usually require lots of manually annotated training data. Consequently, except for the difficulty of event extraction itself, inadequate training data also hinders.\nThe zero-shot learning method is the right choice, which has been widely applied in NLP tasks .\nBased on this, Huang et al.  design a transferable neural architecture and stipulate a graph structure to transfer knowledge from the existing types to the extraction of unseen types.\nIt finds the event types graph structure, which learns representation almost matching representations from the parsed AMR structure .\nExisting event extraction systems, which usually adopt a supervised learning paradigm, have to rely on labelled training data, but the scarcity of high-quality training data is a common problem  . Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) tasks extract a span from text , is a basic task of question answering.\nMRC based event extraction  [ref]7 designs questions for each argument, helps capture semantic relationship between question and input sentence.\nQuestion answering methods are emerging as a new way for extracting important keywords from a sentence  [ref]7. By incorporating domain-knowledge to the question set, one can guide the extraction framework to focus on essential semantics to be extracted from a sentence.\nExisting approaches do not utilize the relations among multiple arguments, leaving much room for improvement.\nOur work aims to close this gap by using the argument relations to infer roles of arguments that are hard to settle in isolation, leading to better performance for argument and event classification. Task-oriented dialogue systems aim to assist the user to complete specific tasks according to existing corpora [ref]9 .\nThe typical task-oriented dialogue system has four components: natural language understanding, dialogue state tracker, dialogue policy learning, and natural language generation .\nRamadan et al.  introduce an approach utilizing semantic correlation in ontology terminologies and dialogue utterances.\nIt easily utilizes history knowledge for current dialogue  [ref]9, aiming to build the connection among dialogue.\nTherefore, there have been some explorations on formulating NLP tasks as a dialogue task.\nIt can overcome the inadequacy problem of historical information utilization in MRC.\nTherefore, there have been some explorations on formulating NLP tasks as a dialogue task.\nWe treat event extraction as a dialogue for capturing relationships among arguments.\nOur work leverages the recent development in task-oriented dialogue systems [ref]9 . Such a system decouples the problem to be solved through a multi-turn dialogue, allowing the system to connect and exploit information obtained during multiple conversations to solve a new task  [ref]9.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: and argument role classification.\nMost recent event extraction works are based on a neural network architecture like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  , Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\n [ref]5, Graph Neural Network (GNN)  , Transformer  , or other networks  .\nThe method of event extraction based on deep learning first adopts pipeline.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
