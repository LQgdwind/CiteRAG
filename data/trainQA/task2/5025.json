      "content": "Paper Title: Outcome-Oriented Prescriptive Process Monitoring Based on Temporal Logic Patterns\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPrescriptive Process Monitoring methods can be categorized according to whether the recommended interventions focus on the control flow, on the resources, or on other perspectives . The interventions involving the control flow usually prescribe a set of activities to perform next   [ref]6    4 .\nThe next best activity can be prescribed in different domains and to different users, e.g., to employment companies to help customers in finding the most suitable job [ref]6, to business analysts to improve the execution time, the customer satisfaction or the service quality of a process , or to doctors in order to identify the most appropriate treatment based on the conditions of a patient . Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently gained popularity in recommending the next best activity(ies). In , an RL approach is used to prescribe the next best activity(ies) to only one of the actors involved in the process, e.g., the bank in a loan request handling process or the police department in a process related to the traffic management. In 4 Prescriptive Process Monitoring is paired with Predictive Process Monitoring for recommending activities to achieve a desired outcome. The activities recommended in  are computed with RL and causal inference in order to estimate the effect of a recommendation. Another group of prescriptions focuses on the resource perspective    , e.g., which resource should perform the next activity. Also in this case, prescriptions can be applied to different domains. For example, in , prescriptions are related to which police officer is best suited for the next task based on their predicted performance in a driving license application process. In , recommendations on the repairs to carry out are provided to mechanics to guarantee that they complete their work within a predefined time. The approach presented in  recommends the most performing resource (i.e., workers in this case) to be assigned with a pending work item. In , the resources are recommended by optimizing the overall resource assignment of a process. Few works prescribe interventions regarding both control flow and resources   2    . For instance, in , an intervention to make an offer to a client together with the specific clerk that is the most suitable one to carry out the task are prescribed. In , the next activity and the specialist that should perform it are recommended to resolve open tickets in an IT service management process. In  , the recommended next activities and resources are extracted from a prototypical trace belonging to the same cluster as the input trace. The approaches presented in   focus on interventions that reduce the cycle time of a case. The former uses a Random Forest to predict the effects of triggering a recommendation for reducing the cycle time; the latter extends the former by considering the cycle time and also binary outcomes of a case and by using explainable Machine Learning techniques to select the recommendations. Finally, a last group of works focus on other types of interventions. For instance, in  , the authors propose a method in which a cost-model is used to control the creation of alerts in order to reduce the projected cost for a particular event log. In 7, the trade-off between the earliness and accuracy of the predictions for proactive process adaptation is discussed. The approach presented in 8 uses online reinforcement learning to learn when to initiate proactive process adjustments based on forecasts and their run-time dependability. In , the authors tackle the problem of recommending interventions for avoiding an undesired outcome when a limited amount of resources is available. This work is extended in 9 by also considering the effects of triggering a recommendation at a certain time. The approach proposed in our work focuses on control flow but, differently from existing works, it does not merely prescribe a sequence of activities to perform next but, rather, a set of temporal constraints that have to be satisfied. Temporal relations among activities provide more sophisticated and flexible recommendations (since they do not require the mandatory execution of a certain activity at a given point in time).\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: recommended interventions focus on the control flow, on the resources, or on other perspectives .
