      "content": "Paper Title: The Computational Complexity of Equilibria with Strategic Constraints\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGame theory provides a means of mathematically modeling strategic interactions between agents, and has grown from its original application areas in the social sciences, showing itself to be relevant for modeling in computer science, particularly in areas such as networking and distributed systems. With the development of these new applications, a new focus has been put on the computational foundations of the field, going beyond the traditional mathematical existence proofs to consider issues of algorithmic feasibility. As part of this shift in focus, deep connections have been established between problems related to the existence of equilibria in games and computational complexity. Nash equilibrium  is a central concept in game theory and much attention has been given to its computational complexity. Nash’s famous result   proved the existence of a mixed equilibrium in any strategic game with two or more players. However, this was purely an existence result and did not address the computational complexity of the associated problem of finding a mixed equilibrium for a given game. Starting with , where it is shown that the problem is unlikely to be NP-complete, there has been a significant line of work showing investigating the hardness of this problem    4, in particular in relation to the class TFNP of total NP search problems. This culminated in the result of , showing that the computational complexity of finding a (mixed) Nash equilibrium for two-player games is as hard as any problem in PPAD, which is a subclass of TFNP capturing the complexity of problems such as Sperner’s Lemma and Brouwer’s fixed-point theorem. In the presence of intractability, it is natural to consider relaxed notions of solutions to a problem. There are multiple constant factor approximation algorithms known for Nash equilibrium  4    however, the problem of finding an approximate solution for any additive approximation error, remains hard   . Beyond the question of the computational complexity of finding a Nash equilibrium, we may consider equilibria in the presence of additional constraints. In this direction, there are two well-known approaches. The goal of the first approach is to find a Nash equilibrium that has certain properties (e.g., achieving a specified social welfare)   . In the second approach, the goal is to find a constrained solution, i.e., one in which no player would deviate assuming all players only play strategies satisfying the given constraint  [ref]30 . More broadly, game theory faces some foundational challenges, including how to make the concept of mixed strategies more useful in practice . In the 1980s, the concept of mixed strategies was criticized as being \"intuitively problematic\", since it weakens the definition of the Nash equilibrium  . There is no generally accepted interpretation of this concept for a variety of practical purposes. According to 2, mixed strategies are employed in games without pure Nash equilibrium, but their primary purpose is to achieve noteworthy mathematical results. The results of this paper are motivated in part by exploring a particular interpretation of strategies as a resource, giving rise to some natural constraints that reflect this interpretation.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: welfare)   .
