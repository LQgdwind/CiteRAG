      "content": "Paper Title: An Efficient Dynamic Resource Allocation Framework for Evolutionary Bilevel Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBilevel optimization problems (BLOPs) are complicated due to their hierarchical structure and the interactive nature of the decision-making process between the upper and lower levels, each with its own objective function involving both the upper- and lower-level decision variables.\nSpecifically, the upper-level decision variables xusubscriptùë•ùë¢x_{u} serve as parameters for the lower-level problem, where only the corresponding lower-level optimal solution xl‚àósuperscriptsubscriptùë•ùëôx_{l}^{*} is considered a valid response.\nDespite their complexity, bilevel problems frequently arise in real-world scenarios.\nExamples include power grid configuration , traffic network scheduling , resource pricing [ref]3, machine learning optimization , and many others , , [ref]7.\nA notable application is hyper-parameter tuning in machine learning, which can be framed as a bilevel optimization problem.\nAt the upper level, the goal is to minimize validation loss by adjusting the hyper-parameters. The lower level, given the hyper-parameters, seeks to find a set of model parameters by minimizing training loss. In turn, the upper level evaluates and adjusts the hyper-parameters based on the performance of the learning model provided by the lower level. As problem scales increase, enhancing the efficiency of bilevel algorithms becomes increasingly essential. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been proven to be effective for solving bilevel optimization problems .\nWithout making assumptions about problem characteristics, bilevel evolutionary algorithms (BLEAs) are considered more versatile than traditional mathematical approaches to handle various difficulties such as non-convexity and non-differentiable .\nHowever, the application of evolutionary algorithms entails both advantages and challenges.\nFor each upper-level individual, the corresponding lower-level problem needs to be fully optimized to ensure the optimality.\nConsequently, a large number of function evaluations (FEs) are required at the lower level, leading to high computational cost.\nAssuming there are 100 upper-level individuals and each corresponding lower-level task evolves 100 individuals, even if only one iteration is performed for each lower-level task, a total of 10,000 FEs would be required. To address these challenges, research on reducing the computational cost of evolutionary bilevel optimization has been active in recent years.\nMeta-modeling methods were introduced to transform bilevel problems into single-level problems by constructing approximate mappings between the upper- and lower-level problems 0.\nHowever, these approximation methods are not always effective.\nThe lower-level reaction set mapping (œàùúì\\psi-mapping) is inaccessible when the lower-level optimal response to the upper-level decision is not single-valued 1, and the lower-level optimal value function mapping (œÜùúë\\varphi-mapping) increases the dimensionality of variables and adds constraints to the transformed single-level problem. In addition, some methods aim to reduce resource costs by exchanging information about optimal individuals.\nThis concept is common in co-evolutionary algorithms 2, where optimal individuals or coding information are shared between sub-populations or between upper- and lower-level populations 3. Recently, knowledge transfer has been implemented to facilitate the convergence of bilevel optimization 4.\nFor instance, marginal distributions are shared from the upper level to the lower level to enhance the quality of the lower-level initial population 5.\nIn 6, 7, and 8, lower-level problems derived from multiple upper-level vectors are treated as similar tasks, where transfer occurs in the concurrent execution. While the aforementioned methods have successfully accelerated the bilevel evolutionary process, they may incur massive resource expense when applied to problems with increased dimensions, which is inevitable in real-world applications 9, 0.\nThe increase in variable dimensions expands the search space, requiring more evolutionary iterations, which leads to a significantly higher demand for function evaluations, especially at the lower level.\nMost existing algorithms have been investigated on problems where both upper- and lower-level variables are fewer than 10, yet even under such conditions, obtaining quality results often requires over 1‚Äãe61superscriptùëí61e^{6} FEs.\nTherefore, improving the efficiency of BLEAs remains a significant challenge. In essence, the inefficiency of BLEAs primarily stems from the large number of iterations executed in lower-level tasks.\nWe can reconsider the rationality of complete lower-level optimization from the perspective of a typical evolution process, which inspires the motivation of this work.\nA key operation in evolutionary computation is environmental selection, which is conducted at both levels.\nFor each upper-level individual xusubscriptùë•ùë¢x_{u}, the lower-level optimizer finds the best lower-level solution xl‚àósuperscriptsubscriptùë•ùëôx_{l}^{*} through iterative function evaluations and environmental selection. Subsequently, all the paired solutions (xusubscriptùë•ùë¢x_{u}, xl‚àósuperscriptsubscriptùë•ùëôx_{l}^{*}) undergo upper-level function evaluation and selection.\nNote that, even if all xusubscriptùë•ùë¢x_{u} individuals are initially considered promising and their corresponding lower-level problems are fully optimized, some (xusubscriptùë•ùë¢x_{u}, xl‚àósuperscriptsubscriptùë•ùëôx_{l}^{*}) pairs are not competitive.\nAs is common in practice, roughly half of these pairs are eliminated during upper-level selection.\nIn this context, the computational resources spent optimizing the lower-level tasks for these eliminated pairs are essentially wasted.\nCurrent methods treat all lower-level problems derived from upper-level individuals equally, fully optimizing each one to find the lower-level optima.\nAs a result, although optimization of each lower-level task can be promoted, significant computational resources are wasted on those without potential. Consequently, we consider the resource waste in the bilevel structure to be a significant obstacle to further improving optimization efficiency.\nWhen handling a new upper-level population, it is more efficient not to execute all corresponding lower-level tasks with complete optimization equally.\nInstead, the benefits of lower-level optimization can be maximized by prioritizing resource allocation to those lower-level tasks that are more likely to generate solutions capable of surviving the subsequent upper-level selection. In this work, we propose a dynamic resource allocation framework for evolutionary bilevel optimization.\nThe lower-level optimization tasks derived from upper-level individuals are executed in a competitive paradigm, in which the execution priority of lower-level tasks is determined by a dynamically updated selection probability.\nGenerally, the contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: ‚àô‚àô\\bullet To eliminate the computational redundancy in BLEAs, we proposed a dynamic resource allocation framework with a competitive quasi-parallel paradigm for bilevel structure, which significantly reduces the resource consumption across problems of varying scales. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet To prioritize execution opportunities to tasks with higher competitiveness, we designed a probability-based task selection mechanism that combines the performance and evolving potential of each task, which enables the algorithm to improve efficiency while achieving competitive accuracy. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet To leverage the inherent similarity of competing tasks and enhance the overall competition quality, we implemented a knowledge transfer strategy based on the sharing of sampling parameters to promote cooperation in competition, which further improves the efficiency and prevents the algorithm from premature convergence. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:\nSection II provides a brief introduction of the preliminaries and related work.\nSection III details the proposed method.\nSection IV presents the experiments and analysis.\nFinally, Section V concludes the paper with a discussion on future work.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: a valid response.\nDespite their complexity, bilevel problems frequently arise in real-world scenarios.\nExamples include power grid configuration , traffic network scheduling , resource pricing [ref]3, machine learning optimization , and many others , , [ref]7.\nA notable application is hyper-parameter tuning in machine learning, which can be framed as a bilevel optimization problem.\nAt the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
