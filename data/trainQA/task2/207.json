Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

This computation is further optimized with four key ingredients . We use and build on top of all of these four optimizations for high performance, which are: 1. The clearing lemma  [ref]7 , 2. Computing cohomology  , 3. Implicit matrix reduction , and 4. The emergent pairs lemma . figure[h]\n\nGeneral computation framework in Ripser++, derived from Ripser, for dimension (d=2) persistence. 1. filtration construction, specifically a simplex-wise refinement of the Vietoris-Rips filtration determined by a distance matrix 2. Matrix reduction on an implicitly represented coboundary matrix. Each algorithmic component is labeled with the respective hardware it runs on. In this section we review these four optimizations as well as the enclosing radius condition. Our contributions follow in the next section, Section 4.
