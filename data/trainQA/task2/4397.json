      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting data augmentation for subspace clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, self-expressive based SC approaches consist of two main steps: Represent the samples using other samples and construct a coefficient matrix, C𝐶C, which encodes the pairwise similarity between samples. Cluster the samples via spectral clustering on the affinity matrix, A=|C|+|C|⊤𝐴𝐶superscript𝐶topA=|C|+|C|^{\\top}. Correct partitioning of samples by spectral clustering depends on the quality of the coefficient matrix computed in the first step. The self-expressive coefficient matrix\nis generally obtained by solving the following optimization problem: where ℛ​(C)ℛ𝐶\\mathcal{R}(C) is a regularizer, λ>0𝜆0\\lambda>0 is a regularization parameter, and ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} is the loss function which measures the self-expressive representation error and is typically the squared Frobenius norm.\nThree regularizers are the most widely used:\n(1) the component-wise ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} norm, ‖C‖ℓ1=∑i,j|C​(i,j)|subscriptnorm𝐶subscriptℓ1subscript𝑖𝑗𝐶𝑖𝑗\\|C\\|_{\\ell_{1}}=\\sum_{i,j}|C(i,j)|, in sparse subspace clustering (SSC) ,\n(2) the nuclear norm, ‖C‖∗=∑i=1nσC​(i)subscriptnorm𝐶superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝜎𝐶𝑖\\|C\\|_{*}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sigma_{C}(i) where σC​(j)subscript𝜎𝐶𝑗\\sigma_{C}(j) is the j𝑗jth singular value of C𝐶C, in low-rank representation (LRR) ; and\n(3) the Frobenius norm, ‖C‖F2superscriptsubscriptnorm𝐶𝐹2\\|C\\|_{F}^{2}, in\nleast square regression (LSR) .\nOut of the existing regularizers, the ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} norm has the strongest theoretical guarantees  . In fact, the ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} norm based SC is subspace preserving when the underlying subspaces are independent, disjoint and even intersecting/overlapping. Whereas, the subspace preserving guarantees for SC algorithms based on the nuclear and Frobenius norms are limited to independent subspaces  . Several approaches in the literature have extended unsupervised SC to the semi-supervised setting where a few labeled samples are available.\nMost approaches use the labels to construct a graph with explicit label smoothness constraint.\nIn particular, graph-based label propagation (LP) approaches, such as the Locally and Globally Consistency based method , are combined with self-expressive based graph construction in SC. The goal is to yield a higher quality graph that respects the label consistency between the adjacent nodes  5 . These approaches mainly differ in the regularizers for the coefficient matrix, the label propagation approach, and the optimization scheme; see  and the references therein. Improving the quality of the coefficient matrix in challenging scenarios such as dealing with data contaminated by noise, outliers or missing entries  9 [ref]30,\ncoming from multiple views/sources  , and\nwith nonlinear structures (see  and the references therein) have formed the main body of the previous studies on SC.\nHowever, almost all of the past studies have considered the data matrix as a fixed input and attempted to improve the performance (under various settings and assumptions) without altering the input data. In this paper, we focus on the effect of data distribution on the quality of the coefficient matrix. Motivated by the significant role of data augmentation in the performance of neural networks,\nwe will propose an SC paradigm relying on data augmentation leading to representations that better respect the subspace preserving property. To the best of our knowledge, there are only a handful number of SC algorithms that incorporate augmented samples for learning the representations. Moreover, these approaches tackle nonlinear SC. The common backbone of these approaches is integrating self-expressive representation as a linear layer within a conventional autoencoder network 2. These approaches typically use data augmentation to obtain consistent representations for different augmentation strategies applied on the data. In other words, the augmented samples are used as different views from the given input data and the goal is to achieve consistent representations among these views. For example,\na subspace consistency loss is proposed in  to enforce consistent subspaces for original samples and their corresponding transformed samples. Later in , the concept of contrast learning was brought in neural network based SC and data augmentation was used to generate positive pairs that are assumed to share the same subspace/cluster. In this paper, we will combine the original and augmented samples as a unified enlarged dictionary, and argue that this provides more information to ensure subspace preserving representations.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: scheme; see  and the references therein. Improving the quality of the coefficient matrix in challenging scenarios such as dealing with data contaminated by noise, outliers or missing entries  9 [ref]30,\ncoming from multiple views/sources  , and\nwith nonlinear structures (see  and the references therein) have formed the main body of the previous studies on SC.\nHowever, almost all of the past\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
