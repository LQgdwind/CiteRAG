      "content": "Paper Title: More Interpretable Graph Similarity Computation via Maximum Common Subgraph Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInitial methods, such as SMPNN , GCNMEAN and GCNMAX  directly encode each graph as a graph-level fixed-length vector via GNNs and then only use graph-level interaction to predict similarity. After that, more models were proposed to exploit node-level or subgraph-level interactions by degrees. GMN [ref]19 uses cross-graph attention to derive node-level embeddings that contain another graph‚Äôs information. SimGNN [ref]1 and GraphSim  derive the corresponding hidden vector differently by applying the convolution operation to the pairwise node similarity matrix or extracting its histogram features.  first partitions graphs and then conducts node-wise comparison among subgraphs. MGMN 1 designs node-graph matching layers by comparing each node‚Äôs representation of one graph with the other whole graph representation. After converting graph to hypergraph via random walk or K-hop neighbourhood, H2MN  utilizes hypergraph convolution and subgraph matching blocks to predict similarity. Compared with previous methods, our proposed INFMCS is simpler. INFMCS does not need to compute node-wise interactions per layer [ref]19 [ref]1 but only uses the last layer of node-level embeddings to capture cross-graph interactions. Second, ours does not need to consider multi-scale matching scores of |ùí¢1|√ó|ùí¢2|subscriptùí¢1subscriptùí¢2|\\mathcal{G}_{1}|\\times|\\mathcal{G}_{2}| pairs 1, only calculates |ùí¢1|subscriptùí¢1|\\mathcal{G}_{1}| matching scores. Third, ours does not need to preprocess graph data, such as graph partition  and hypergraph construction . Although our method avoids the above computational burden, it achieves good performance.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: vector via GNNs and then only use graph-level interaction to predict similarity.
