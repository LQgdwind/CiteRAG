Such a G&C approach is only feasible for targets with sufficient information on their orbital properties in advance, which is not realistic for ISOs visiting our solar system from interstellar space with large state uncertainty. The ISO rendezvous problem can be cast as a robust motion planning and control problem that has been investigated in numerous studies in the field of robotics. The most well-developed and commercialized of these G&C methods is the robust nonlinear MPC [ref]19, which extensively utilizes knowledge about the underlying nonlinear dynamical system to design an optimal control input at each time instant, thereby allowing a spacecraft to use the most updated ISO state information. If the MPC is augmented with feedback control, robustness against the state uncertainty and various external disturbances can be shown using, e.g., Lyapunov and contraction theory (see, e.g.,   and references therein). However, as mentioned earlier, the spacecraft’s onboard computational power is not necessarily sufficient to solve the MPC optimization at each time instant of its TCM, which could lead to failure in accounting for the ISO state that changes dramatically in a few seconds due to the body’s high velocity. Even when we solve the MPC in a discrete-time manner, the computational load of solving it online is not negligible, especially if the computational resource of the agent is limited and not sufficient to perform nonlinear optimization in real time. Learning-based control designs have been considered a promising solution to this problem, as they allow replacing these optimization-based G&C algorithms with computationally-cheap mathematical models, e.g., neural networks . Neural-Rendezvous can be viewed as a novel variant of a learning-based control design with formal optimality, stability, and robustness guarantees, which are obtained by extending the results of  for general nonlinear systems to the case of the ISO rendezvous problem and more.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: planning and control problem that has been investigated in numerous studies in the field of robotics.
