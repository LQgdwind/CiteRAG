Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: Latent reweighting, an almost free improvement for GANs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe first consider two well-known image datasets that are MNIST [ref]22 and FashionMNIST (F-MNIST). We follow  and use a standard CNN architecture composed of a sequence of blocks made of 3x3 convolution layer and ReLU activations with nearest neighbor upsampling. For these datasets, the discriminator is trained using the hinge loss  with gradient penalty (Hinge-GP). Finally, the architecture used for the network wœÜsuperscriptùë§ùúëw^{\\varphi} is very simple: an MLP with 4 fully-connected layers and ReLU activation (with a width=4√ódwidth4ùëë\\text{width}=4\\times d). CelebA [ref]24 is a large-scale dataset of faces covering a variety of poses. We use a pre-trained model of Progressive GAN [ref]17 at 128x128 resolution. The discriminator is trained using a Wasserstein loss with gradient-penalty. Also, the architecture used for the network wœÜsuperscriptùë§ùúëw^{\\varphi} is really standard: a 5 hidden-layer MLP with a width of the same size than the latent space dimension. LSUN Church  is a dataset of church images with a lot of variety. We use a pre-trained model of StyleGAN2  at 256x256 resolution. Similarly to the CelebA dataset, the discriminator is trained using a Wasserstein loss with gradient-penalty. Also, the architecture used for the network wœÜsuperscriptùë§ùúëw^{\\varphi} is a 3 hidden-layer MLP with width equal to the latent space dimension. Note that the StyleGAN architecture already contains an 8-layer MLP network MŒ∏:‚Ñùd‚Üí‚Ñùd:subscriptùëÄùúÉ‚Üísuperscript‚Ñùùëësuperscript‚ÑùùëëM_{\\theta}:\\mathds{R}^{d}\\to\\mathds{R}^{d} that transforms a latent space variable to an intermediate latent variable . We consequently leverage this pre-trained MŒ∏subscriptùëÄùúÉM_{\\theta} and train the network wœÜsuperscriptùë§ùúëw^{\\varphi} on top of it.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: We first consider two well-known image datasets that are MNIST [ref]22 and FashionMNIST (F-MNIST).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
