Tensors are natural generalization of matrices (222-order tensors), which enable to model data with more than two axes of variation. They are characterized by the order, which is the number of their dimensions. Tensors quickly became an important tool in several applications, including data mining and machine learning .\nIt is worth noting that tensors have been used in the context of neural networks, we cite among these works , where the authors focused on relating tensor decompositions to neural networks with product units, instead of summing units. However, this architecture is not so much used in practice. Other tensor-based approaches [ref]34  [ref]41 have been proposed for the compression of neural networks. The aim of these works was to compress neural networks by finding low-rank approximations of the weight tensors. The reasons for this interest in tensors are mainly three. First, being a natural tool that has the ability to model heterogeneous data. Second, having interesting uniqueness properties, which is a real advantage over matrices, and finally the availability of tools to perform tensor decompositions. Different tensor decompositions exist in the literature, we mention among them, the canonical polyadic decomposition  . The CPD decomposes a tensor 𝓧𝓧\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}} into a sum of r𝑟r rank-one tensors. A rank-one tensor of order Q𝑄Q is given by the outer product of Q𝑄Q vectors. The canonical rank r𝑟r of a CPD is the minimum number of rank-one tensors needed for a perfect representation of 𝓧𝓧\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}. A more formal definition of the CPD is given below. The notations used throughout the rest of this paper are now defined. The symbols (⋅)†superscript⋅†(\\cdot)^{\\dagger} and rank​(⋅)rank⋅{\\rm rank}(\\cdot) denote, respectively, the pseudo-inverse and the rank. The outer, Kronecker, Khatri-Rao, Hadamard and n𝑛n-mode products are denoted to by ∘\\circ, ⊗tensor-product\\otimes, ⊙direct-product\\odot, ∗* and ×nsubscript𝑛\\times_{n}. Tensors are represented by 𝓧𝓧\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}. 𝓧​(i,:,:)𝓧𝑖::\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}(i,:,:), 𝓧​(:,j,:)𝓧:𝑗:\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}(:,j,:) and 𝓧​(:,:,k)𝓧::𝑘\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}(:,:,k) are the i𝑖i-th horizontal, j𝑗j-th lateral and k𝑘k-th frontal slices of sizes N2×,N3N_{2}\\times,N_{3}, N1×N3subscript𝑁1subscript𝑁3N_{1}\\times N_{3} and N1×N2subscript𝑁1subscript𝑁2N_{1}\\times N_{2}, respectively, of the tensor 𝓧𝓧\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}} of size N1×N2×N3subscript𝑁1subscript𝑁2subscript𝑁3N_{1}\\times N_{2}\\times N_{3}. The operator vec​(⋅)vec⋅{\\rm vec}(\\cdot) forms a vector by stacking the columns of its matrix argument. The operator diag​(⋅)diag⋅{\\rm diag}(\\cdot) forms a diagonal matrix from its vector argument. unfoldq​𝓧subscriptunfold𝑞𝓧{\\rm unfold}_{q}\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}} refers to the unfolding of tensor 𝓧𝓧\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}} over its q𝑞q-th mode . We now introduce some definitions that will be useful in the sequel. A Q𝑄Q-order tensor 𝓧𝓧\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}} of size N1×…×NQsubscript𝑁1…subscript𝑁𝑄N_{1}\\times\\ldots\\times N_{Q} belonging to the family of rank-r𝑟r CPD can be expressed as:\n where the q𝑞q-th factor 𝐏qsubscript𝐏𝑞{\\mathbf{P}}_{q} is of size Nq×rsubscript𝑁𝑞𝑟N_{q}\\times r, for 1≤q≤Q1𝑞𝑄1\\leq q\\leq Q. An equivalent notation to denote the CP decomposition in (9) is 𝓧=[|𝐏1,⋯,𝐏Q|]\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}=[|{\\mathbf{P}}_{1},\\cdots,{\\mathbf{P}}_{Q}|].\nThe q𝑞q-mode unfolded matrix unfoldq​𝓧subscriptunfold𝑞𝓧{\\rm unfold}_{q}\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}, of size Nq×N1​⋯​NQNqsubscript𝑁𝑞subscript𝑁1⋯subscript𝑁𝑄subscript𝑁𝑞N_{q}\\times\\frac{N_{1}\\cdots N_{Q}}{N_{q}}, is given by: The CP decomposition in (9) is said to be unique (up to trivial scaling and permutation ambiguities) if where k𝐏qsubscript𝑘subscript𝐏𝑞k_{\\mathbf{P}_{q}} is the Kruskal rank  of factor 𝐏qsubscript𝐏𝑞\\mathbf{P}_{q}. The condition in (11) is a sufficient condition. It has been proven in  of 333-order CPDs, and extended to high-order CPDs in .\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: focused on relating tensor decompositions to neural networks with product units, instead of summing units.
