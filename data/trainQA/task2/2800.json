      "content": "Paper Title: HYPER: Learned Hybrid Trajectory Prediction via Factored Inference and Adaptive Sampling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMulti-Modal Trajectory Prediction Trajectory prediction has been studied extensively in the past few years.\nTo account for uncertainty and multi-modality in prediction space, generative adversarial networks (GAN)  and variational autoencoders (VAE)  9 are used to generate multiple trajectory predictions by sampling a latent space. Several works have attempted to improve coverage of the possible outcomes  [ref]3  , yet there is an inherent trade-off between accurately representing the trajectory distribution and covering a diverse set of intents   [ref]3.\nTo account for this trade-off between accuracy and coverage explicitly, hybrid models are proposed to classify discrete intent and generate continuous trajectories conditioned on the intent. The intent is defined by a variety of choices, including driving maneuvers  2 3, goal locations or waypoints [ref]6  4 5 6 7, and target lanes  8 9 , etc.\nIn these hybrid approaches, the intent is assumed to be fixed over time.\nIn practice, however, the agent may change its intent over time, especially over a long horizon, or follow different intents to get to the same target location or lane.\nWhen accounting for evolving discrete intent, 4 leverages a support vector machine to infer discrete intent over specific decision points, and 5 proposes a discrete choice modeling approach to infer discrete anchors over time. Such models either expand discrete predictions at a few selected steps or predict the most-probable intent, to avoid dealing with the exponentially growing discrete space. In this work, we propose a general and expressive hybrid prediction framework that accounts for evolving intent by inferring a sequence of discrete modes over time, and predicting trajectories consistent with the mode sequence. Factored Inference The discrete prediction space suffers from exponential growth as a function of the prediction horizon. This problem has been addressed in the context of factored inference, by approximating the intractable state space through pruning and sampling techniques. For instance,\nmultiple model estimation algorithms estimate the possible operational modes for a system, and filter states from an exponential number of hypotheses, by merging and pruning hypotheses 0 1.\nFurthermore, 3 models the hybrid system through a hybrid Bayesian network, and proposes a sampling-based approximation algorithm to track hybrid states.\nIn parallel,  2   model hybrid systems through a probabilistic hybrid automaton (PHA)  or a switching linear dynamical systems (SLDS) , and apply efficient pruning, search, and sampling methods to maintain reasonable estimation performance.\nExisting factored inference methods often assume a linear system to obtain closed-form or trackable solutions, and do not fully utilize the relevant context information. In this work, we model a hybrid system as deep neural networks, which excel at modeling nonlinear agent dynamics and learning complex environment contexts such as map information. Trajectory Sampling\nMany trajectory prediction methods   9 sample multiple predictions in parallel from a learned distribution. Our approach utilizes a sequential adaptive sampling technique to generate samples through a learned proposal distribution, conditioned on previously generated samples. This allows to provide more coverage with limited samples. The learned adaptive proposal function is inspired by a few ideas from sequential trajectory prediction sampling , sequential Monte Carlo  6 , and adaptive sampling 0 1 2. Compared to existing sequential Monte Carlo methods, our proposal function is used to sample per time step, as opposed to sampling a full trajectory at once, to avoid a large proposal state. In many applications such as autonomous driving, only a small set of prediction samples can be afforded, as evaluating each sample for downstream tasks such as risk assessment is expensive 3. To select a limited number of candidates from all predicted samples, [ref]3  leverage diverse sampling techniques to choose semantically meaningful samples from a latent space; [ref]6 uses non-maximum suppression (NMS) to prune trajectories that are close to each other to improve coverage;  proposes task-specific sub-sampling techniques towards optimizing the evaluation metrics. Similar to [ref]6, our approach selects samples directly over the predicted trajectories, offering better interpretability.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: and variational autoencoders (VAE)  9 are used to generate multiple trajectory predictions by sampling a latent space.
