      "content": "Paper Title: Effects of Safety State Augmentation on Safe Exploration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement learning (RL) is a framework for sequential decision-making that makes minimal prior assumptions about the environment where the agent has to act or make the decisions . The policy for taking actions is learned through interactions with the environment over time. RL has seen recent successes in playing video games with a computer , board games with a human  and is on a path toward real-life applications such as video compression , and plasma control . There are still, however, some unsolved challenges for a successful deployment of RL such as efficient learning of constrained or safe Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) . The constraints are typically modeled by a discounted sum of nonnegative costs that have to be smaller than some pre-defined value we call the safety budget. Exploration is a crucial component of RL and is still an active area of research  0 . In the context of safe RL, while exploring, we do not want to incur the safety cost and constraint violations, making exploration a harder task. We can distinguish two main research directions for minimizing constraint violation in safe RL: a model-based approach (which includes partially and fully known environments) and a model-free approach. In the model-free case, which we focus on, the agent would almost certainly visit unsafe regions to learn the safe policy, and therefore it is next to impossible to avoid constraint violations completely. The general goal, in this case, is to minimize the number of violations during training. For example,  use a conservative safety critic and rejection sampling to choose a “safer” action, 8 design a curriculum learning approach, where the teacher resets the student violating safety constraints, and 1 learns to reset the policy if the safety constraint is violated 1. In this work, we aim to improve model-free safe reinforcement learning by augmenting the state-space with one state encapsulating the safety information. This safety state is initialized with the safety budget and the value of the safety state can serve as a measure of distance to the unsafe region. This form of the safety state was proposed in  and introduced in RL in 3, where a safe RL algorithm with probability one constraints was derived. In this paper, we take a closer look at the purposes of the safety state in a broader context. First, we claim that safety state augmentation is often crucial for the averaged constrained problem as well and provide examples of such occurrences. In some particular problems, the use of safety state augmentation may potentially be avoided, however, this can be said about any state in the environment. Second, our main suggestion is that scheduling the safety budget at different training epochs can improve the algorithm’s performance. Our claim extends equally over averaged and almost surely constrained reinforcement learning problems. In particular, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in some environments in the safety gym benchmark. Further, we claim that scheduling the initial safety budget can lead to reducing safety constraint violations during training for safe RL with probability one constraints. We design two algorithms that automatically tune the safety budget, one is based on a classical control engineering PI controller, while the other uses Q learning to decide on the safety budget. Related work. Many of the current safe RL methods are extensions of the most successful RL algorithms: Trust region policy optimization (TRPO) , proximal policy optimization (PPO) , soft actor-critic (SAC)  etc. Safe versions of TRPO, PPO, and SAC with a Lagrangian approach were first presented in , which is still considered to be one of the major baselines. A direct extension of TRPO by adding constraints to the trust region update was proposed in . Model-based approaches were also considered cf.  [ref]16 7  and most of them took a Bayesian approach to model one-step transitions. To our best knowledge, the most successful approaches for safe reinforcement learning to date are PID-Lagrangian 4 and LAMBDA . The former views the Lagrangian multiplier update as another control problem and employs a PID controller to solve it (cf. ). Specifically, the authors link the multiplier update to integral control and add proportional and derivative controllers to achieve a superior behavior. On the other hand,  is a model-based approach that uses Bayesian world models to enhance safety. A recent work 9 formulated safe RL as inference resulting in a sample efficient off-policy approach. Other formulations of safe RL were considered in the literature. For example,  [ref]16 1 proposed to use conditional-value-at risk (CVaR) constraints, while 3  proposed to enforce constraints with probability one. Further, as we discussed above eliminating the number of constraint violations typically requires strong assumptions, e.g., finite state space 7, 0 2, knowledge of a partial model 8 or initial safe policy . These results are in the spirit of safe RL with control-theoretic notions       2, which make significant prior assumptions to guarantee safety. Finally, the closest algorithm in the literature to our method is the curriculum learning approach to Safe RL from 8. Due to space limitations we discuss this approach in detail in Appendix. We finally mention that 1 proposed a two-player framework with the cooperating task agent and safety agents,  proposed a safety layer that would be applied after the action is computed using a classical policy, 4 defined a probabilistic shield for safety. We also note 2 6 that considered safe deployment of RL policies in real-life settings.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: is still considered to be one of the major baselines.
