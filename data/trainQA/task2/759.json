      "content": "Paper Title: Discovering High Utility-Occupancy Patterns from Uncertain Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDue to sensor or network failure when collecting data in the real world, it is difficult to detect accurate or complete data. However, most algorithms have a preference for precise data and do not consider uncertain data. The above algorithms are all aimed at handling precise data. Therefore, it is essential to develop some algorithms to effectively discover useful patterns in uncertain databases . Chui et al.  first introduced a pioneering work to mine qualified frequent patterns in an uncertain database, and their Apriori-like UApriori algorithm adopts a hierarchical search measure, similar to the Apriori algorithm , by comparing thresholds of support count and the probability to delete useless itemsets. The UApriori algorithm was optimized by Leung et al. 7 using an extended frequent pattern tree structure. This method does not generate candidate itemsets and greatly improves the execution time and the mining performance. After that, Lin et al. 8 developed an algorithm based on a tree structure, called CUFF-tree to efficiently mine frequent patterns. In addition to mining frequent patterns in uncertain databases, it is also important to extract weighted frequent patterns 1 3 or high-utility patterns 0 4 in uncertain databases. Lin et al. 0 proposed a novel framework, which is the potential high-utility itemset mining model. Several efficient algorithms, named PHUI-UP 0, PHUI-List 0, MUHUI 4, CPHUI-List , and HUPNU [ref]9, were developed to find interesting patterns with both high utility and high probability. To summarize, the problem now is that according to what has been learned currently, 1) no work has utilized the concept of utility occupancy and uncertainty together to discover high utility-occupancy patterns in uncertain databases. 2) Besides, the measure of utility-occupancy is different from that of utility, in terms of definition, upper bound, and pruning strategies. Therefore, this paper is aimed at addressing this challenging task.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: Lin et al. 0 proposed a novel framework, which is the potential high-utility itemset mining model.
