      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring Uncertainty in Deep Learning for Construction of Prediction Intervals\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the rapid development of artificial intelligence, deep learning has attracted the interest of many researchers . As a representative tool of deep learning, deep neural networks has achieved impressive performance in many tasks. At present, deep neural networks have important applications in computer vision , speech recognition , natural language processing , bioinformatics  and other fields. Although deep neural networks have achieved high accuracy for many tasks, they still perform poorly in quantifying the uncertainty of predictions and tend to be overconfident. For many real-world applications, it is not enough for a model to be accurate in its predictions. It must also be able to quantify the uncertainty of each prediction. This is especially importance in tasks where wrong prediction has a great negative impact, such as: machine learning auxiliary medical diagnosis [ref]6, automatic driving , fiance and energy system, etc. These high-risk applications require not only point prediction, but also the precise quantification of the uncertainty. So it can be said that in many application scenarios, uncertainty is very important, more important than precision. Moreover, uncertainty plays an important role in determining when to abandon the prediction of the model. Abandoning the inaccurate predictions of the model can handle exceptions and hand over high-risk decisions to humans . As more and more autonomous systems based on deep learning are deployed in our real life that may cause physical or economic harm, we need to better understand when we can have confidence in the prediction of deep neural networks and when we should not be so sure. The development of neural networks precise prediction intervals (PIs)  is a challenging work to explore the uncertainty of prediction, which has just aroused the interest of researchers. PIs directly conveys uncertainty, providing a lower bound and an upper bound for prediction0, but traditional deep neural networks can only provide a point estimation. PIs is of great use in practical applications, and can help people make better decisions. However, although there are some researches on uncertainty estimation 1 2 3 4 5, there are few researches on PIs. In this paper, We will\nexplore the uncertainty in deep learning to construct the prediction intervals. Uncertainty comes from different sources in various forms, and most literature considers two sources of uncertainty: aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty 6 7 8 9 0 1. Aleatory uncertainty describes the irreducible inherent noise of the observed data. This is due to the complexity of the data itself, which can be sensor noise, label noise, class overlap, etc. Aleatory uncertainty is also caused by hidden variables that are not observed or errors in the measurement process, and this type of uncertainty cannot be reduced by collecting more data. Aleatory uncertainty is also known in some literature as data uncertainty, random uncertainty 2, stochastic uncertainty 3. Epistemic uncertainty describes the model errors due to lack of experience in some regions of the feature space4. In some feature spaces, if the training samples do not cover them, the uncertainty will increase in those places. Therefore, the epistemic uncertainty is inversely proportional to the density of the training samples, which can be reduced by collecting more data in the low-density areas. In regions with high-density training samples, epistemic uncertainty will decrease, and aleatory uncertainty caused by data noise will play a major role. Epistemic uncertainty is also known as model uncertainty 9, because it is caused by the limitations of the model. By analyzing the sources and categories of uncertainty, we can deal with and estimate each kind of uncertainty well in practice. The precise prediction intervals of neural network is a difficult task to solve, and its development is closely related to uncertainty estimation. The prediction interval directly reflects the uncertainty. Many literatures have proposed that the loss function can be modified to implicit learning prediction intervals  0 2 5 6. These methods have obvious disadvantages, such as loss function can not be optimized by gradient descent-based algorithm, which is a modern machine learning technology. Or the accuracy of PIs is low. Although there are many confidence interval construction methods with good performance in statistical literature, these methods can not be effectively combined with deep learning. In this paper, we propose a prediction interval construction method from the perspective of statistics which can be used effectively only by slight modification of deep neural networks. We modify the last layer of the general deep neural network so that the network no longer outputs only a point estimation, but the upper bound and lower bound of the interval. And a loss function that can be used to train such a network is derived from the perspective of probability theory. Because most modern deep neural networks can use our loss function with only a few modifications, our method will have more practical use than other methods. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows: i) In this paper, the construction of optimal prediction intervals is associated with uncertainty estimation. We design a novel loss function based on the theory of statistics. We think our work bridges the gap between the construction of prediction intervals and the uncertainty estimation; ii) Unlike bayesian deep learning, our loss function can be seamlessly integrated with current deep learning frameworks such as T​e​n​s​o​r​F​l​o​w𝑇𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑜𝑟𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑤TensorFlow and P​y​T​o​r​c​h𝑃𝑦𝑇𝑜𝑟𝑐ℎPyTorch. Existing deep learning networks can use our loss function with only minor modifications. And it can be optimized efficiently using standard optimization techniques. We believe that our method promotes the development of non-bayesian method to construct prediction interval. iii) Experimental results show that this method can construct compact optimal prediction intervals. It can sensitively capture the epistemic uncertainty. In the low-density data distribution area, the uncertainty increases obviously. Experimental results on some publicly available regression datasets show the effectiveness of the method. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the section 2, we summarize the related work of uncertainty estimation and prediction interval. And we introduce the method of constructing prediction interval based on exploring uncertainty in section 3. In the section 4, we organize some convincing experiments to show the effectiveness of our method. Finally, in the section 5, we make a brief summary of this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: able to quantify the uncertainty of each prediction.
