      "content": "Paper Title: Dark, Beyond Deep: A Paradigm Shift to Cognitive AI with Humanlike Common Sense\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClassic computer vision studies focus on reasoning about appearance and geometry—the highly visible, pixel-represented aspects of images. Statistical modeling  aims to capture the “patterns generated by the world in any modality, with all their naturally occurring complexity and ambiguity, with the goal of reconstructing the processes, objects and events that produced them .” Marr conjectured that the perception of a 2D image is an explicit multiphase information process , involving (i) an early vision system for perceiving 87 88 and textons 89 90 to form a primal sketch 91 92; (ii) a mid-level vision system to form 2.1D 93 94 95 and 2.5D 96 sketches; and (iii) a high-level vision system in charge of full 3D scene formation 97 98 99. In particular, Marr highlighted the importance of different levels of organization and the internal representation . Alternatively, perceptual organization   and Gestalt laws         aim to resolve the 3D reconstruction problem from a single RGB image without considering depth. Instead, they use priors—groupings and structural cues   that are likely to be invariant over wide ranges of viewpoints —resulting in feature-based approaches  . However, both appearance  and geometric  approaches have well-known difficulties resolving ambiguities. In addressing this challenge, modern computer vision systems have started to account for “dark” aspects of images by incorporating physics; as a result, they have demonstrated dramatic improvements over prior works. In certain cases, ambiguities have been shown to be extremely difficult to resolve through current state-of-the-art data-driven classification methods, indicating the significance of “dark” physical cues and signals in our ability to correctly perceive and operate within our daily environments; see examples in Fig. 16 , where systems perceive which objects must rest on each other in order to be stable in a typical office space. Through modeling and adopting physics into computer vision algorithms, the following two problems have been broadly studied: Stability and safety in scene understanding. As demonstrated in Ref. [ref]98, this line of work is mainly based on a simple but crucial observation in human-made environments: by human design, objects in static scenes should be stable in the gravity field and be safe with respect to various physical disturbances. Such an assumption poses key constraints for physically plausible interpretation in scene understanding. Physical relationships in 3D scenes. Humans excel in reasoning about the physical relationships in a 3D scene, such as which objects support, attach, or hang from one another. As shown in Ref. , those relationships represent a deeper understanding of 3D scenes beyond observable pixels that could benefit a wide range of applications in robotics, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR). The idea of incorporating physics to address vision problems can be traced back to Helmholtz and his argument for the “unconscious inference” of probable causes of sensory input as part of the formation of visual impressions . The very first such formal solution in computer vision dates back to Roberts’ solutions for the parsing and reconstruction of a 3D block world in 1963 . This work inspired later researchers to realize the importance of both the violation of physical laws for scene understanding  and stability in generic robot manipulation tasks  . Integrating physics into scene parsing and reconstruction was revisited in the 2010s, bringing it into modern computer vision systems and methods. From a single RGB image, Gupta et al. proposed a qualitative physical representation for indoor  01 and outdoor  scenes, where an algorithm infers the volumetric shapes of objects and relationships (such as occlusion and support) in describing 3D structure and mechanical configurations. In the next few years, other work      09     also integrated the inference of physical relationships for various scene understanding tasks. In the past two years, Liu et al.  inferred physical relationships in joint semantic segmentation and 3D reconstruction of outdoor scenes. Huang et al.  modeled support relationships as edges in a human-centric scene graphical model, inferred the relationships by minimizing supporting energies among objects and the room layout, and enforced physical stability and plausibility by penalizing the intersections among reconstructed 3D objects and room layout 00 . The aforementioned recent work mostly adopts simple physics cues; that is, very limited (if any) physics-based simulation is applied. The first recent work that utilized an actual physics simulator in modern computer vision methods was proposed by Zheng et al. in 2013   [ref]98. As shown in Fig. 17 [ref]98, the proposed method first groups potentially unstable objects with stable ones by optimizing for stability in the scene prior. Then, it assigns an “unsafety” prediction score to each potentially unstable object by inferring hidden potential triggers of instability (the disturbance field). The result is a physically plausible scene interpretation (voxel segmentation). This line of work has been further explored by Du et al.  by integrating an end-to-end trainable network and synthetic data. Going beyond stability and support relationships, Wu et al.  integrated physics engines with deep learning to predict the future dynamic evolution of static scenes. Specifically, a generative model named Galileo was proposed for physical scene understanding using real-world videos and images. As shown in Fig. 18, the core of the generative model is a 3D physics engine, operating on an object-based representation of physical properties including mass, position, 3D shape, and friction. The model can infer these latent properties using relatively brief runs of  markov chain monte carlo (MCMC), which drive simulations in the physics engine to fit key features of visual observations. Wu et al.  further explored directly mapping visual inputs to physical properties, inverting a part of the generative process using deep learning. Object-centered physical properties such as mass, density, and the coefficient of restitution from unlabeled videos could be directly derived across various scenarios. With a new dataset named Physics 101 containing 17 408 video clips and 101 objects of various materials and appearances (i.e., shapes, colors, and sizes), the proposed unsupervised representation learning model, which explicitly encodes basic physical laws into the structure, can learn the physical properties of objects from videos. Integrating physics and predicting future dynamics opens up quite a few interesting doors in computer vision. For example, given a human motion or task demonstration presented as a RGB-D image sequence, et al.  built a system that calculated various physical concepts from just a single example of tool use (Fig. 19), enabling it to reason about the essential physical concepts of the task (e.g., the force required to crack nuts). As the fidelity and complexity of the simulation increased, Zhu et al.  were able to infer the forces impacting a seated human body, using a  finite element method (FEM) to generate a mesh estimating the force on various body parts; Fig. 35(d). Physics-based reasoning can not only be applied to scene understanding tasks, as above, but have also been applied to pose and hand recognition and analysis tasks. For example, Brubaker et al.    estimated the force of contacts and the torques of internal joints of human actions using a mass-spring system. Pham et al.  further attempted to infer the forces of hand movements during human-object manipulation. In computer graphics, soft-body simulations based on video observation have been used to jointly track human hands and calculate the force of contacts  . Altogether, the laws of physics and how they relate to and among objects in a scene are critical “dark” matter for an intelligent agent to perceive and understand; some of the most promising computer vision methods outlined above have understood and incorporated this insight.\n\nReference markers found: [98]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]98: Through modeling and adopting physics into computer vision algorithms, the following two problems have been broadly studied: Stability and safety in scene understanding.
