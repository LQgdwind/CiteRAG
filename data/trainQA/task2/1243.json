      "content": "Paper Title: Occlusion Guided Scene Flow Estimation on 3D Point Clouds\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInspired by the architecture of , our network utilizes a feature pyramid structure and uses the point cloud from two different time frames as its inputs, where each point can have a rich feature vector such as color or normal to the surface. In the examples shown in this paper, we use the RGB color as our input point feature. See Figure 2 for network architecture. In each pyramid level, we first apply a backward warping of the target point cloud T𝑇T towards the source S𝑆S by using the upsampled flow from the previous level. Then, by using the features from the point clouds and the upsampled occlusion mask from the previous level, we construct our cost volume for each point in S𝑆S. The cost volume is a widely used concept in stereo matching [ref]44 . It stores the point-wise matching cost and measures the correlation between the different frames. Finally, we predict the finer flow and mask by using the cost volume, features from S𝑆S, upsampled flow and mask. Feature Pyramid Structure. In order to extract the semantically strong features for the accurate flow and occlusion mask prediction, we construct a 4-level pyramid of features with the input at the top (zeroth) level. For each pyramid level l, we downsample the point clouds for the coarser level (l+1) by using the farthest point sampling (FPS) [ref]33. Followed by a PointConv [ref]52 operation, we create and increase the number of the features for each downsampled point. The finer prediction of flow and mask at each level are made by using the upsampled prediction from its coarser level (except for the bottom level). Warping. At each pyramid level, we first do a backward warping of the target points towards the source by using the upsampled scene flow from the previous coarser level. We use the same Upsample layer as in . Since the warping layer brings the target “closer” to the source, neighborhood searching of the target around the source point would be more accurate during the cost volume construction. Denote the upsampled flow from the coarser layer as {fiu​p}i=1n1superscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑖𝑢𝑝𝑖1subscript𝑛1\\{f_{i}^{up}\\}_{i=1}^{n_{1}}. Inside the warping layer, we first do a forward warping from the source to the target: For each point qjsubscript𝑞𝑗q_{j} in the target T𝑇T, we compute its backward flow by using the weighted average of the upsampled flow: Where NS​w​(qj)subscript𝑁𝑆𝑤subscript𝑞𝑗N_{Sw}(q_{j}) is the K nearest neighbor (k-NN) of qjsubscript𝑞𝑗q_{j} on Swsubscript𝑆𝑤S_{w}, weight w​(pi,qj)=1d​(pi,qj)𝑤subscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝑞𝑗1𝑑subscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝑞𝑗w(p_{i},q_{j})=\\frac{1}{d(p_{i},q_{j})} is simply the inverse of the euclidean distance between pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} and qjsubscript𝑞𝑗q_{j}. Finally, the warped target point will be the element-wise addition of the backward flow and itself: Cost volume with Occlusion mechanism. Traditionally, occlusions play an essential role in the scene flow estimation on the 2D stereo frames. When it comes to the 3D point clouds, occlusion issues still exist due to the motion of the object and the camera position. The main impact of the occlusion is on the cost volume since the matching cost for the occluded point is not available. Similar to the images, the occlusion in the source point cloud relative to the target can be modeled as a map: O​C​CS−T:S→ :𝑂𝐶subscript𝐶𝑆𝑇→𝑆01OCC_{S{-}T}:S\\rightarrow  where 0 stands for the occluded point, 1 stands for the non-occluded. FlowNet3D  uses a flow embedding layer to aggregate the features and spatial relationships for each neighbor in the target around the source. Since their model only finds the neighboring points within a certain radius, it is somehow robust to the occlusion as the relative displacement between the occluded point and target is usually large. PointPWC-Net  suggests a novel cost volume that can aggregate the features of both input point cloud in a patch-to-patch manner. However, for the occluded regions in the source, this feature aggregation operation can be incorrect since they do not have a correspondence in the target frame. Inspired by PWOC-3D , we suggest a novel occlusion mechanism that helps the construction of our cost volume. One of the critical components of cost volume is the matching cost. It measures the similarity between the source point and the target point. Since we believe that the correlation between the points is highly related to their features and relative displacement, for the non-occluded point pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}, the matching cost between pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} and qjsubscript𝑞𝑗q_{j} is calculated by Where h​(⋅)ℎ⋅h(\\cdot) is simply a concatenation of its input followed by 1×1111{\\times}1 convolution layers, cisubscript𝑐𝑖c_{i} and gjsubscript𝑔𝑗g_{j} are the corresponding features of pi∈Ssubscript𝑝𝑖𝑆p_{i}\\in S and qj∈Twsubscript𝑞𝑗subscript𝑇𝑤q_{j}\\in T_{w}. When it comes to the occluded points pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} , we expect to get a matching cost of 0, as they do not have a correspondence in the target frame. As shown in Figure 3, by using our definition of occlusion map, we can calculate our matching cost of pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} with qjsubscript𝑞𝑗q_{j} as: In our case, we use the upsampled predicted occlusion mask from its coarser layer as the occlusion map in Eq. 5. After we calculate the matching cost, we can aggregate them to form the cost volume. Theoretically, we can use all possible pairs of (pi,qj)subscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝑞𝑗(p_{i},q_{j}) in our calculation, but this is inefficient in terms of the computation. With the help of the Warping layer, we can assume that the correct corresponding point pairs between source and target are relatively close to each other. For this reason, we only aggregate the matching cost of the nearest target neighbor for every point in the source. It can be summarized in the following form: where NT​w​(pi)subscript𝑁𝑇𝑤subscript𝑝𝑖N_{Tw}(p_{i}) is the nearest neighborhood of the source point pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} in the warped target Twsubscript𝑇𝑤T_{w}. In the cost volume layer of , they use a learnable weighted sum based on the relative distance as the aggregation function to calculate their Point-to-Patch cost.\nThis implies that the proportion of the matching cost between (pi,qj)subscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝑞𝑗(p_{i},q_{j}) in C​V​(pi)𝐶𝑉subscript𝑝𝑖CV(p_{i}) only depends on their relative displacement (qj−pi)subscript𝑞𝑗subscript𝑝𝑖(q_{j}-p_{i}). However, in many cases, the correlation between the points depends on their features but not their relative displacement, the correct corresponding pairs can have less contribution to the cost volume by using this aggregation design. In our work, we decide to use the max-pooling to aggregate the matching cost. The intuition is that, to make an accurate prediction of the flow and mask, the model needs the matching cost of the correct corresponding pairs to have the highest contribution in the cost volume. Using max-pooling can force their matching cost to have the highest value among the neighborhood NT​w​(pi)subscript𝑁𝑇𝑤subscript𝑝𝑖N_{Tw}(p_{i}) during training. This choice of design also agrees with our definition of the matching cost above. To summarize, we calculate the cost volume for every point pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} by using the following equation: Predictor Layer. In order to make the final prediction of the flow and occlusion mask at each pyramid level, we use a predictor layer. As shown in Figure 4, this layer contains a feature propagation module followed by two predictor branches. In the feature propagation module, we first concatenate all its inputs along the feature dimension. Then by using several PointConv and Multilayer perceptron (MLP), we generate the final features for the flow and mask prediction. The inputs of the feature propagation module are the features of the source, masked cost volume described above, upsampled flow and upsampled occlusion mask. After the feature propagation layer, we connect a flow predictor and occlusion predictor in parallel. Since we believe that the scene flow and occlusion are highly related to each other, we decide to use the shared input features for the two branches. Our flow predictor consists of a single MLP layer such that the output tensor has a dimension of (n1subscript𝑛1n_{1}, 3). Unlike the PointPWC-Net , our flow predictor only predict a residual flow vector such that the final scene flow is the element-wise addition of the upsampled flow from the previous level and the residual flow for every point in the source. By using this residual flow design, we solve the scene flow estimation problem in an iterative approach and we get a stronger correlation between the consecutive pyramid levels. Shifting from multi-scale flow estimation to multi-scale residual improve the results significantly and we show that in the ablation study. For the occlusion branch, we use a 2-layer MLP with leaky-ReLU activation in the middle to process the input features. We also connect a sigmoid activation layer in the end. This ensures the output to be a probability distribution with value in the range  .\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: from the point clouds and the upsampled occlusion mask from the previous level, we construct our cost volume for each point in S𝑆S.
