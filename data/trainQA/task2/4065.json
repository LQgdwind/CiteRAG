      "content": "Paper Title: Anomaly Detection with Test Time Augmentation and Consistency Evaluation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, deep neural networks have shown substantial flexibility and valuable practicality in various tasks  [ref]23. However, when deploying deep learning in reality, one of the most concerning issues is that deep models are known to be overconfident when exposed to unseen data  . That is, although the deep models generalize well on unseen datasets drawn from the same distribution (i.e., test data), it incorrectly assigns high confidence to unseen data drawn from another distribution (i.e., out-distribution data).\nTo solve the problem, anomaly detection [ref]2 aims to separate unseen data from training data. When testing deep neural networks, test time augmentation (TTA) utilizes the property that a well-trained classifier should have a low variance in predictions across augmentations on most data 8 7.\nHowever, this phenomenon is only explored and verified on data drawn from the training distribution (in-distribution). It is still unclear whether this property generalizes to other different distributions (out-distribution). In fact, the answer is No since the model does not see any augmentations of the out-distribution samples in the training phase.\nTo verify, we use t-SNE  to visualize the projected feature space of a ResNet-34  supervisedly trained with CIFAR-10  in Figure 1.\nThe figure contains test samples from CIFAR-10 and SVHN  test sets. For each sample, we plot the raw feature and the feature of its augmented version with a line connecting them.\nIt shows that the relative distance between a CIFAR-10 pair (red-blue pairs with black lines) is statistically smaller than that of an SVHN pair (green-orange pairs with gray lines). Similar observations widely exist across networks, datasets, and augmentation methods (see Appendix A).\nTherefore, a well-trained model is not robust towards augmentations of all distributions; Instead, the property only holds for in-distribution data. Based on this observation, we develop our algorithm, named TTA-AD (Test Time Augmentation Anomaly Detection), which has the following characteristics: Performance. TTA-AD achieves comparable or better detection performance on challenging benchmark vision datasets for both supervised and unsupervised SOTA models.\nEfficiency. TTA-AD is a post-hoc algorithm which can be applied directly to a plain classifier. It only computes two forward passes to obtain the anomaly scores, which is far more efficient than most popular classifier-based algorithms. We provide a clock running time comparison in Figure 2.\nPrior-free. TTA-AD is dataset-agnostic and prior-free. So we do not have to tune the hyper-parameters with out-distribution prior, which may be hard or impossible to obtain during training.\nAdaptability. TTA-AD can not only help a plain classification model to detect anomalies, but also adapt to other representation learning anomaly detection methods 9. Meanwhile, TTA-AD does not require access to internal features and gradients, which is desirable when a white box model is unavailable. We further analyze the reasons for improved performance through empirical observations and theoretical analysis, which previous works often do not provide. Empirically, TTA-AD gains benefits from mutual relations between different augmentations of a single sample. We name all the classes except for the maximum class as remaining classes. Specifically, we verify that the mutual relations between the remaining classes of a single sample’s different augmentations significantly differ for in- and out-distribution data.\nThe idea is different from previous algorithms which focus on maximum probability   , mutual relations between layers of a sample 4, mutual relations between different samples 9 and class-conditional distributions  .\nSection 5.1 provides detailed evidence for the huge statistic difference of the remaining classes on in-distribution and out-distribution data. Theoretically, anomaly detection is essentially a problem of sorting a binary sequence, where the two classes are drawn from in- and out-distributions. In this work, we provide theoretical analysis of TTA-AD’s success based on a theoretical tool named RUNS  , which evaluates the degree of confusion of a binary sequence in statistics. A detailed correlation between RUNS and the performance of TTA-AD is discussed in Section 5.2.\nConsidering the strong connection between anomaly detection and RUNS, RUNS may serve as a theoretical tool in other anomaly detection works as well. To conclude, our contributions are: 1) We observe the significant difference of the mutual relations for in- and out-distribution data and propose a new anomaly detection algorithm, TTA-AD, based on the observation. It achieves comparable or better results on challenging benchmark vision datasets for both supervised and unsupervised dataset-vs-dataset anomaly detection.\n2) We provide both empirical and theoretical evidence to explain how TTA-AD works, which is not addressed by previous algorithms.\n3) TTA-AD is more practical compared to the previous algorithms. Specifically, it is computationally efficient and free both to out-distribution prior and the model’s internal weights/gradients.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: Recently, deep neural networks have shown substantial flexibility and valuable practicality in various tasks  [ref]23.
