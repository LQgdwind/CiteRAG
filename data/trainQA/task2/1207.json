      "content": "Paper Title: Learnable Gabor modulated complex-valued networks for orientation robustness\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMNIST  (CC BY-SA 3.0 license)\nis a standard benchmark for transformation invariance because of its simplicity, interpretability and vast array of variants.\nWe apply a random rotation between [0,2‚ÄãœÄ)02ùúã[0,2\\pi) to yield a rotated MNIST, and train with 5-fold validation.\nOur baseline classification architecture is similar to that used in  [ref]10 [ref]2, with three blocks of increasing channels, representing a hierarchy of feature complexity. Each block contains two learnable Gabor modulated convolutional layers with a kernel size of 3√ó3333\\times 3 followed by max pooling along the orientation axis and average spatial pooling. We use no cyclic Gabor convolutional layers, but these may be included in future experiments. In the final block, features are pooled globally so that a given activation contains one complex value per feature channel. We then concatenate real and imaginary parts into a single vector and use three (real valued) fully connected layers for classification. The Adam optimiser [ref]44 is used for network training, starting at a learning rate of 0.001 and then decaying with an exponential schedule by 0.9 every epoch. L2 weight regularisation is also enforced with a penalty of 10‚àí7superscript10710^{-7}. Exploration of rotation invariance in the feature maps ‚Äì The number of modulation filters UùëàU has a direct effect on the network‚Äôs ability to capture rotation dependent features. We vary this parameter and investigate its effect on network‚Äôs performance and the learned features of the first layer, which are the most directly affected by low-level geometrical transformations of the input image. For this first experiment, we train networks with U‚àà{1,2,4,8,16}ùëà124816U\\in\\{1,2,4,8,16\\}. We measure and compare response magnitudes (measured as the ratio between the average magnitudes of input and output activations) between original and rotated samples, for all rotations in the (discrete) range [0,360‚àòsuperscript360360^{\\circ}], for each network (Fig.¬†2 right).\nThough response magnitude varies slightly, this may be largely due to interpolation artefacts caused by rotation of the input samples. Nonetheless, the pattern remains predictable throughout the rotation interval with decreasing amplitude for increasing UùëàU, indicating that the number of modulating filters has a direct impact on rotation invariance.\nWe also measure classification accuracy as a function of rotation for 1000 samples from the MNIST test set for each network (Fig.¬†2 left). The small difference in accuracy between U=1ùëà1U=1 and others indicates that even a little orientation information is helpful in generating intra-class rotation-invariant features that remain inter-class separable. At U=16ùëà16U=16 there is a detrimental saturation of orientations possibly due to the model becoming too complex for the dataset size and task. Optimal performances are reached for UùëàU between 2 and 8, with LGCN being not very sensitive to the exact value of this hyperparameter. Evaluation of the individual modifications to  ‚Äì We evaluate the performance improvements from our two modifications to  individually, namely the use of complex-valued filters and of learnable Gabor orientation parameters. In these experiments we apply these modifications both in turn and jointly to the model of . The channel sizes for each LGCN variant were adjusted so that the total parameter size is at most equal to all of the compared models: for complex models this required halving the number of feature channels. The final results, shown in Tab.¬†1, show that both modifications improve classification accuracy, demonstrating the additional feature expressivity afforded in comparison to standard CNNs. All variants also outperform GCNs which use real and static Gabor modulation, with an absolute error difference of 0.6 for LGCNs, showing the benefit of our method‚Äôs changes over the previous work. The combination of modifications leads to a large performance increase that may indicate a synergy between the two approaches. One possible explanation for this is that the complex Gabor filter provides smoother gradients with respect to Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta and ŒªùúÜ\\lambda, as opposed to only the real part. We will test this hypothesis in future work. Effect of adjusting learning strategies of Gabor parameters ‚Äì We investigate the effect of learning Gabor parameters other than Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta, and study how changing initialisation methods impacts the model‚Äôs performance.\nThe default training configuration for LGCNs uses fixed œÉùúé\\sigma set at œÄùúã\\pi, and learnable ŒªùúÜ\\lambda initialised using a normal distribution with mean 3‚ÄãU3ùëà3\\sqrt{U} and variance U4ùëà4\\frac{\\sqrt{U}}{4}.\nWe experiment with fixing or learning wavelength ŒªùúÜ\\lambda and scale œÉùúé\\sigma and study how different configurations affect LGCNs.\nIn addition we compare additional weight initialisation strategies for these variables.\nFor wavelength initialisation we apply: fixed Œª=3ùúÜ3\\lambda=3; normal distribution with unit mean and unit variance (not adjusting for UùëàU); and uniform distribution between [‚àí1.5,1.5]1.51.5[-1.5,1.5].\nFor scale, in addition to fixed œÉ=œÄùúéùúã\\sigma=\\pi, we initialise with a normal distribution with mean equal to œÄùúã\\pi and quarter variance, and enable backpropagation.\nFinally, we repeat these experiments with only one Œª,œÉùúÜùúé\\lambda,\\sigma for all modulating Gabor filters per layer. We train parameter restricted models with varying Gabor parameter learning strategies on rotated MNIST for 30 epochs with 5-fold validation, and record the average performance over all splits. Results are shown in Table 2. While initialising with a normal distribution Œª=ùí©‚Äã(3‚ÄãU,U4)ùúÜùí©3ùëàùëà4\\lambda=\\mathcal{N}(3\\sqrt{U},\\frac{\\sqrt{U}}{4}) and fixing œÉ=œÄùúéùúã\\sigma=\\pi achieves the highest average performance, there is no clear strategy for either variable that remains best with the other variable strategy changed. Notably, there is a performance decrease when aliasing of the modulating Gabor filters is forcibly introduced by initialising wavelength ŒªùúÜ\\lambda from a uniform distribution with bounds [‚àí1.5,1.5]1.51.5[-1.5,1.5]. In further tests it was noticed that in this scenario ŒªùúÜ\\lambda values do not recover from this range of aliasing even after training for >100 epochs. For this experiment we conclude that given parameters are not in an aliasing range, LGCNs are not particularly sensitive to learning strategy of wavelength ŒªùúÜ\\lambda and scale œÉùúé\\sigma.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: of variants.\nWe apply a random rotation between [0,2‚ÄãœÄ)02ùúã[0,2\\pi) to yield a rotated MNIST, and train with 5-fold validation.\nOur baseline classification architecture is similar to that used in  [ref]10 [ref]2, with three blocks of increasing channels, representing a hierarchy of feature complexity.
