      "content": "Paper Title: Single Image Super-Resolution via a Dual Interactive Implicit Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, neural networks with periodic activation functions\n [ref]26 exhibit excellent performance in\nreconstructing high-fidelity images and videos. We use a similar dual MLP\narchitecture, also known as a modulated periodic activations neural network\n[ref]26, for our decoder with adjustments to address the SISR\ntask. Our decoder of NùëÅN layers (i.e., NùëÅN layers of modulation and NùëÅN layers of\nsynthesis) can be written recursively as where wùë§w, w‚Ä≤superscriptùë§‚Ä≤w^{\\prime}, bùëèb, and b‚Ä≤superscriptùëè‚Ä≤b^{\\prime} are the weights and biases, zùëßz is the content\nfeatures, and pùëùp is the positional features. The last output of sisubscriptùë†ùëñs_{i} is then\npassed through a final dense layer (without activation) to output the predicted\nSR signal. The two main differences between our method and [ref]26 are\nthe following. The zùëßz vector in the image reconstruction experiment in\n[ref]26 represents a patch while ours represents a pixel in\nthe LR image. Typically, coarse-grain features are associated with higher\nlevels of semantic information and thus may miss low-level details (e.g.,\nedges, corners, etc.), which are crucial for SISR. Additionally,\npixel-level representations have consistently performed well in the SISR\nliterature   [ref]6. Therefore, we\nopt for the finest-grain representation (i.e., pixel-level). The architecture\nof our encoder reflects this choice. In (4), we use a concatenation of the output of the previous\nsynthesis layer (instead of the previous modulation layer in\n[ref]26) and the latent feature vector as inputs for the\nlatter modulation layer. We argue that the outputs of the synthesis network\nare progressively more refined toward different query locations and therefore\nprovide better information to the modulation network while the latent feature\nvector serves as residual feedback. We show the benefits of our modification\nover [ref]26 in Section¬†4. \n\n\n\nDataset\nScale\n√ó2absent2\\times 2\n√ó3absent3\\times 3\n√ó4absent4\\times 4\n\nMethod\nPSNR\nSSIM\nLR-PSNR\nPSNR\nSSIM\nLR-PSNR\nPSNR\nSSIM\nLR-PSNR\n\n\n\nDIV2K\nBicubic\n31.06\n0.8937\n40.38\n28.26\n0.8138\n39.45\n26.7\n0.753\n38.68\n\nMeta-SR \n34.64\n0.938\n57.13\n30.91\n0.8736\n54.93\n28.89\n0.8173\n53.19\n\nLIIF [ref]6\n34.46\n0.9367\n53.63\n30.81\n0.8724\n52.23\n28.88\n0.8163\n50.95\n\nDIINN (ours)\n34.63\n0.938\n55.96\n30.93\n0.8741\n53.65\n28.98\n0.8193\n52\n\nB100\nBicubic\n28.27\n0.8316\n38.54\n25.88\n0.7171\n38.19\n24.64\n0.6411\n37.93\n\nMeta-SR \n29.23\n0.8651\n41.5\n27.51\n0.7823\n48.6\n25.94\n0.701\n47.36\n\nLIIF [ref]6\n30.66\n0.8891\n52.27\n27.68\n0.7862\n51.67\n26.17\n0.7097\n50.61\n\nDIINN (ours)\n30.69\n0.8896\n52.62\n27.73\n0.7873\n52.36\n26.22\n0.7119\n50.82\n\nSet5\nBicubic\n31.81\n0.9097\n40.77\n28.63\n0.8385\n38.79\n26.7\n0.7739\n37.29\n\nMeta-SR \n35.68\n0.9439\n57.21\n31.6\n0.8878\n48.82\n29.95\n0.8605\n53.79\n\nLIIF [ref]6\n35.5\n0.9427\n54.06\n32.15\n0.9008\n52.61\n29.92\n0.8601\n50.52\n\nDIINN (ours)\n35.67\n0.9438\n56.38\n32.26\n0.902\n54.2\n30.06\n0.8631\n51.89\n\nSet14\nBicubic\n28.33\n0.8437\n38.25\n25.74\n0.7413\n37.18\n24.24\n0.6648\n36.57\n\nMeta-SR \n30.9\n0.8897\n52.93\n27.65\n0.8005\n46.51\n26.25\n0.7383\n50.61\n\nLIIF [ref]6\n31.15\n0.8919\n51.57\n28.04\n0.8083\n50.43\n26.34\n0.7407\n49.22\n\nDIINN (ours)\n31.29\n0.8937\n53.92\n28.14\n0.8101\n51.53\n26.43\n0.7437\n50.33\n\nUrban100\nBicubic\n25.44\n0.8284\n35.54\n23.01\n0.7151\n35.02\n21.69\n0.6334\n34.64\n\nMeta-SR \n29.32\n0.907\n47.53\n25.53\n0.8152\n42.79\n24.12\n0.7507\n48.35\n\nLIIF [ref]6\n30.02\n0.9147\n48.92\n26.29\n0.8296\n48.34\n24.29\n0.7555\n47.33\n\nDIINN (ours)\n30.29\n0.9176\n51.2\n26.46\n0.8337\n49.67\n24.49\n0.7624\n48.75\n\n \n\n\n\nScale\n√ó2.5absent2.5\\times 2.5\n√ó3.5absent3.5\\times 3.5\n\nMethod\nPSNR\nSSIM\nLR-PSNR\nPSNR\nSSIM\nLR-PSNR\n\n\n\nBicubic\n29.41\n0.8514\n39.89\n27.39\n0.781\n39.02\n\nMeta-SR \n31.36\n0.8898\n46.1\n29.21\n0.8305\n47.18\n\nLIIF [ref]6\n32.29\n0.9036\n52.93\n29.73\n0.8427\n51.62\n\nDIINN (ours)\n32.34\n0.9046\n53.43\n29.82\n0.845\n52.39\n\n Compared to the closest competing framework, LIIF [ref]6, our\nmethod uses a more expressive neural network for the decoder, which leads to\nbetter performance.
