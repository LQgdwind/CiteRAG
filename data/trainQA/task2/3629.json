      "content": "Paper Title: Transfer Dynamics in Emergent Evolutionary Curricula\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe POET algorithm [ref]1 is a coevolutionary algorithm for simultaneously generating and solving tasks.\nThe approach was first explored on the OpenAI Gym’s Hardcore Bipedal Walker domain;222https://gym.openai.com/envs/BipedalWalkerHardcore-v2/ given rangefinders and joint angle information, agents learn gaits for walking over terrain containing hills, stumps, and pitfalls.\nPOET coevolves agents and terrains through three main processes: 1) periodically generating new offspring environments by mutating existing environments and ensuring that new environments pass a minimal criterion (MC) for reproduction of being neither too easy nor too hard, 2) incrementally optimizing agents paired with generated environments, and 3) occasionally attempting to transfer optimized agents into other environments in the meta-population (Algorithm 1). POET-style algorithms eventually create difficult environment instances that cannot be solved by optimization from scratch (starting from a random policy), indicating that transfer is necessary for high-performing behaviors [ref]1[ref]2. The reward function for biped walkers is continuous, allowing “neither too easy nor to hard” (with respect to the MC) to be defined by minimal and maximal acceptable reward values. This binary approach to fitness, explored recently in the context of artificial life and evolutionary robotics 1, presents a potentially more open-ended alternative to\ntraditional gradient-based evolution 23. After an environment satisfies the difficulty criteria, the new environment is paired with a copy of its parent’s paired agent. Another important and unusual feature of POET is that it periodically evaluates all possible pairs of agents and environments in the meta-population, thereby\nrevealing behaviors that can be easily adapted to multiple environments. Between transfer attempts, agents optimize exclusively on their paired source environment. The best candidate agent for transfer into a level is determined via tournament selection (Algorithm 2) based on each agent’s zero-shot performance on each environment where ties break in the favor of the incumbent agent. Through incremental optimization and regular transfer of agents, POET generates curricula and agents for biped walking. POET’s evolutionary framing of environment generation inherently induces the necessary directed acyclic relationship between the initial specified level and all future levels (see lineage structure in Figure 1) that is required to meet the definition of curriculum learning supplied by Narvekar et al. . However, the automatic generation of new tasks via an evolutionary generative process allows the curriculum to be built by POET itself in an online manner that is reactive to the minimal criterion and agent population.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: The POET algorithm [ref]1 is a coevolutionary algorithm for simultaneously generating and solving tasks.\nThe approach was first explored on the OpenAI Gym’s Hardcore Bipedal Walker\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
