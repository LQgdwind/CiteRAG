      "content": "Paper Title: On the Amplification of Cache Occupancy Attacks in Randomized Cache Architectures\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCaches hide the overall memory access latency by keeping\ndata and instructions close to the processor. It leverages\nthe principle of locality of reference by buffering recently\nused data such that for future references, that data can be\ndirectly served to the processor, saving multiple clock cycles.\nModern processors employ cache memories in slices, sets and ways and are typically based on set-associative design. Depending on the cache hierarchy, either the virtual or the physical address is used to map the incoming memory block into one of the ways of a particular set in the cache. In commercial processors from Intel and AMD, the address to set mapping in the last level cache (LLC) is typically done using complex addressing  on the virtual address.\nDue to the limited size of the cache, multiple memory blocks can be allocated to the same set, thereby creating conflicts. These conflicting addresses that are mapped to the same cache set are called congruent to each other. A number of works in literature exploit this phenomenon to devise a class of cache attacks, called contention-based attacks            . In such attacks, the attacker tries to fill up particular sets in the cache and then monitors those sets to ascertain whether targeted victim address is allocated to the same set. While other forms of cache attacks exist in literature, the attention garnered by contention-based attacks is overwhelming. The Prime+Probe      is the most notable among contention based cache attacks. Here the attacker tries to create a set of congruent addresses, called eviction set, that will potentially contend with the victim’s address for a particular cache set. The success of the attack depends greatly on the efficiency of eviction set generation by the attacker for an unknown target address. In the last few years, multiple works     have proposed efficient creation of eviction sets to increase the success rate of contention-based attacks. Consequently, protecting the cache, especially the LLC, as it is shared among all the cores, against such contention-based attacks has been one of the widely researched directions. A majority of cache protection schemes attempt to scramble the address-to-cache-set mapping by using randomization techniques. Although different designs employ randomization in different ways, the broad idea is to use cryptographic primitives like block ciphers, hash functions, etc., to randomize the mappings in hardware with secret keys. Contemporary randomized cache schemes can be broadly classified into two categories 9 [ref]7  - randomized and partitioned (e.g. ScatterCache) and pseudo fully associative (e.g. MIRAGE). The two widely-acknowledged categories of randomized caches have been subjected to quite a few security evaluations 9   [ref]7 but only from the perspective of a particular attack, the contention-based attack. In other words, the security guarantees of these ingenious cache designs have been envisaged based on the relative degree of resilience they present against formation of eviction set. For example, while  reports successful creation of eviction set in ScatterCache in 210superscript2102^{10} accesses, authors in  claim no eviction in MIRAGE even with 2112superscript21122^{112} accesses, for their respective recommended configurations111Authors of MIRAGE  claim no eviction in 1034≈2112superscript1034superscript211210^{34}\\approx 2^{112} accesses.. These results apparently suggest that MIRAGE is a better design than ScatterCache in the context of contention-based cache attacks. However, there has been no work in literature, to the best of our knowledge, that evaluates these schemes with respect to other important and equally potent cache attack variants. In this work, we take an orthogonal approach to explore the security and performance properties of the two cache randomisation classes, taking MIRAGE and ScatterCache as prime examples of each class. In particular, we check the resilience of MIRAGE and ScatterCache against cache occupancy attack [ref]41 and discover that MIRAGE is more vulnerable to such attack as it gives way by just occupying 10%percent1010\\% of the cache. This observation provides an important insight into the design rationale undertaken for randomized caches as even the traditional set-associative cache fares better than MIRAGE against cache occupancy attacks.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: primitives like block ciphers, hash functions, etc., to randomize the mappings in hardware with secret keys.
