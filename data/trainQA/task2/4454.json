The performance statistics on Something V1 &\\& V2, including the pretrained dataset, classification results, inference protocols, the corresponding FLOPs and parameter numbers are shown in Table 3. The first compartment contains methods based on 3D CNNs or factorized (2+1)D CNNs. Using efficient inference protocol (16 views and center crop×\\times1 clip), ImageNet1K pretrain, PST-T obtains 52.2%percent\\% accuracy on V1 and 65.7%percent\\% on V2, respectively, which outperforms all the CNN-based methods with similar FLOPs. Note that TDN 8 uses a different sampling strategy comparing to other methods, which requires 5 times more frames. Even though, PST-T still outperforms TDN on larger Something-something V2. The second compartment contains transformer-based methods. Our small model PST-T pretrained on Kinetics400 offers competitive performance on SomethingV2 comparing to these methods. PST-B is a larger model and pretrained on ImageNet21K/Kinetics400. PST-B achieves 57.7%percent57.757.7\\% and 69.2%percent69.269.2\\% on V1 &\\& V2, outperforming Timesformer-HR , ViViT-L [ref]1 and MViT-B  at a lower cost on computation or parameter. PST-B also outperforms Mformer-L 9 and X-ViT , which are recently proposed efficient temporal modeling methods. They apply trajectory self-attention and local spatiotemporal self-attention, respectively. Our PST-B††{\\dagger} achieves 58.3%percent58.358.3\\% and 69.8%percent69.869.8\\% on V1 &\\& V2, which outperforms other transformer-based methods. Note that, SIFAR-L  uses larger backbone network Swin-L, however, its performance is less satisfactory. PST-B††{\\dagger} also outperforms Video-Swin 4, which uses full temporal window on this dataset. The performances of PST family on Something-something V1&\\&V2 confirms its remarkable ability for spatiotemporal modeling. Kinetics400. We report our results on scene-focused Kinetics400 in Table 4 and compare them with previous state-of-the-arts. As we can see from Table 4, PST-T achieves 78.2%percent78.278.2\\% top-1 accuracy and outperforms majority of (2+1D) CNN-based methods such as TSM 2, TEINet 6, TEA 0, TDN 8 with less total FLOPs. Our larger model PST-B achieves 81.8%percent81.881.8\\% top-1 accuracy, which outperforms strong 3D-CNN counterparts such as SlowFast [ref]13 and X3D . Comparing to transformer-based methods such as Timesformer  and ViViT-L [ref]1, our PST-B††{\\dagger} achieves 82.5%percent82.582.5\\% with less computation overheads. Specifically, PST-B††{\\dagger} outperforms SIFAR-L  which adopts larger size Swin-L as backbone network. PST-B††{\\dagger} also achieves on par performance with recently developed Video-Swin 5 with less computation cost. Diving-48 V2. In Table 5, we further evaluate our method on fine-grained action dataset Diving-48. As older version of diving-48 has labeling errors, we compare our methods with reproduced SlowFast [ref]13 and Timesformer in  on V2. PST-T achieves competitive 79.2%percent79.279.2\\% top-1 performance with ImageNet-1K pretrain and costs much less computation resources than SlowFast, Timersformer and Timesformer-HR. When PST-T is pretrained on Kinetics400, it also outperforms Timersformer-L. Our larger model PST-B outperforms TimsFormer-L by a large margin of 2.6%percent2.62.6\\% when both are pretrained on ImageNet-21K with 9.7×\\times less FLOPs. When model is pretrained on Kinetic400, PST-B achieves 85.0%percent85.085.0\\% top-1 accuracy. PST-T††{\\dagger} and PST-B††{\\dagger} further boost the performance to 82.1%percent82.182.1\\% and 86.0%percent86.086.0\\%, respectively. Latency, throughput and memory. The inference latency, throughput (videos/second) and inference memory consumption are important for action recognition in practice. We performed measurement on a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. We use batch size of 1 for latency measurement and batch size of 4 for throughput measurement. The accuracy is tested on validation set of Something-something V1&V2 dataset. The results are shown in Table 6. We make three observations: (1) Comparing to baseline “2D Swin-T” that uses 2D transformer with avgpooling for temporal modeling, PST-T has slightly higher latency, same memory consumption, but much better performance (11.6%percent11.611.6\\%, 9.0%percent9.09.0\\% top-1 improvements on Sthv1&v2, respectively). (2) Comparing to “Video-Swin-T” that utilizes full scale temporal information, PST-T uses 76%percent7676\\% less memory and has 2 times faster inference speed, while achieves very competitive performance. (3) For larger model PST-B††{\\dagger}, it achieves better performance than Video-Swin-B while using 50%percent5050\\% less inference memory and 80%percent8080\\% less time.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: methods.
