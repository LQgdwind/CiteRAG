      "content": "Paper Title: Toward collision-free trajectory for autonomous and pilot-controlled unmanned aerial vehicles\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNATS has confirmed that, from their data interpretation, over 1,000 airspace infringements on aerospace law occur each year; this figure sets infringements as one of the highest-risk events that NATS face at this time; As traffic levels increase, it is important that we recognise the more likely need for focused intervention by all stakeholders, to ensure that the potential for mid-air collision does not increase by pursuing and encouraging targeted and continuous improvements in technology and their respective systems . Swarm intelligence algorithms have been utilized in numerous diverse domains for solving optimization problems, e.g., scheduling problems, robots, power systems, parameter optimization, system identification, image processing, and signal processing . Swarms of UAVs equipped with a variety of sensors are commonly deployed to realise a diverse range of missions along with in-situ sensing faster and efficiently due to their flexible use with excellent manoeuvrability [ref]16. The probability of collision risks posed by UAVs is increasing as public use of drones continues to grow and autonomous commercial applications are now becoming a reality. The proposed technology is expected to contribute to swarm intelligence algorithms in solving optimization problems while increasing task performance and safety. In our other funded research, with the same team, we have analysed swarm intelligence with extensive experiments while performing assigned tasks using the technology elaborated in this research with multiple autonomous UAVs within human-robot co-work dialogue . Autonomy is defined as the ability of a system to sense, communicate, plan, make decisions and act without human intervention .\nFA-UAVs as flying autonomous robots determining their course of action with onboard sensor data analysis involving autonomous take-off and landing are taking their place in real-life to accomplish many different tasks . Due to the limitation of payloads, it is infeasible to carry sophisticated heavy sensors, which would lead to increasing power consumption and drastically decrease the flight time . Moreover, due to the limited power available onboard, UAVs must make careful decisions about how to best utilise power for communication  and processing where they both consume high amounts of energy. This paper, aiming both to mitigate the aforementioned concerns and to provide an effective CM system, realises the safe use of FA-UAVs by keeping each UAV well clear of other traffic using effective DAA techniques by which an optimal CA strategy, resulting in minimum deviations from the original trajectory, is implemented based on the relative geometric features of close-range flights. Full automation is anticipated to become a reality in the near future and will bring significant benefits, particularly to the transport and logistics sector. AI will be the key enabler in improving the autonomy of UAV applications. Most AI techniques such as deep neural networks (DNN) requiring prior knowledge and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) requiring less prior knowledge aim to solve the classification problem. Recently, DRL, using Q-learning, has been immensely employed to solve the path planning problem and maze problems of robots. However, these approaches, suffering from high variance and low reproducibility, are not designed to solve the instant CA problem of UAVs under highly dynamic conditions with many uncertainties where RL does not have a fixed training set with ground-truth labels . More specifically, the main goal of Q-learning is to train a general model for the same set of tasks. Q learning algorithm has the problem of a low reuse rate, and different environments need to be re-trained, so reducing the training time is the key to the implementation of RL. Machine learning algorithm has high computational complexity, high resource overhead and dependence on a large number of prior data, which makes it difficult to deal with dynamic and unknown scenarios 1. In this sense, a computationally less intensive multi-agents explainable AI (XAI) methodology considering physical constraints, environmental constraints and current specific characteristics (e.g., velocity vectors) of flights is incorporated into the developed DACM system to build an effective CM policy requiring no prior knowledge and training. Using real-time data provided by the PilotAware system (Table I) including identification, position, speed, heading and altitude, it has been possible to determine if the intruder aircraft is increasing, reducing or maintaining a level altitude with varying velocity vectors, therefore various avoid tactics using AI techniques can then be planned. These can either inform the drone pilot for approval or be autonomously executed depending upon the level of risk determined by the algorithm or operator. Compared with a single platform, cooperative autonomous UAVs offer efficiency and robustness in performing complex tasks 2. In this sense, the development of effective CA systems is of great significance to performing collective and cooperative tasks, in particular, using the global coverage strategy leading to an excellent SA. Many drone applications can benefit from a unified framework that coordinates their access to aerospace and helps them navigate to the points of interest where they have to perform a task 3. Any architecture poised to provide this service must be scalable and be able to provide it to thousands of drones, which will share the congested and limited urban aerospace 3. It is a high priority to deploy FA-UAVs in optimised routes by taking the non-autonomous UAVs and manned aircraft into consideration involving the city structures, facilities and weather conditions to accomplish coordinated and cooperative missions safely. National and supranational authorities (e.g., the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), and International Civil Aviation Organisation) and industry actors (such as Amazon, Google, and drone manufacturer DJI) are now developing systems for UTM 4. The main aim of UTM is to achieve safe and efficient UAV operations 4. The safe integration of UTM systems into ATM systems using intelligent autonomous approaches is an emerging requirement to manage the highly dynamic shared aerospace where the number of wide-scale deployments of public and commercial highly heterogeneous UAV applications is steadily growing owing to their flexible and cost-effective use. This study aims to enable aircraft and drones to share the same aerospace without segregation where there are plans to make EC devices mandatory in UAVs for effective air traffic management in the USA, EU and other parts of the world . The primary motivation behind this study is to help build trust for the use of autonomous UAVs. DACM is expected to be utilised in increasing the efficacy of the UTM system and its integration with the ATM system to autonomously cope with distributed multiple encounters and handle dynamic path planning in integrated aerospace. The viability of the DACM system and the results obtained from the co-simulated and real-world tests suggest that not only can UAVs be safely integrated into ATM systems, but also the standardised size of the MAC avoidance borders as exemplified with the right images in Fig. 16 (Section II) can be reduced significantly without compromising safety to increase the efficient use of aerospace with the deployment of the intelligent systems similar to the proposed system in this research.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: with a variety of sensors are commonly deployed to realise a diverse range of missions along with in-situ sensing faster and efficiently due to their flexible use with excellent manoeuvrability [ref]16.
