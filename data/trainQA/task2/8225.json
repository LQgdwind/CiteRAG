      "content": "Paper Title: Taming Performance Variability caused by Client-Side Hardware Configuration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuantifying variability has been the focus of many works on datacenters, supercomputers and smartphones. Maricq et al.  investigate what is the inevitable variability across nodes of the same architecture in a cluster. They conclude that variability of up-to 10% can be attributed to the underlying hardware. Additionally, they investigate the normality of performance samples across nodes and conclude that the performance samples follow a non-parametric distribution across nodes.\nIn a similar setup, Duplyakin et al.  investigate the variability caused by the execution order of experiments.\nThe rationale is that the sequence in which experiments are conducted can alter the microarchitectural characteristics of the machine, inevitably affecting the performance outcomes of each experiment.\nIf executed in a specific order, this bias will impact the outcome of the experiment. Such variability can be categorized as a form of measurement bias. A measurement bias  is when a technique X speedups a system O by Z but the speedup is not only a result of the technique but is also a bias of the experimental setup. Several works have investigated this phenomenon in various settings, including scheduling algorithms of supercomputers , architectural simulations for multithreaded workloads [ref]2, and O3 optimizations in SPEC CPU2006 workloads . Additionally to measurement bias, other works [ref]47  have identified the network contention as a major contribution to the variability observed by an application. Another work  has developed a methodology using the stress-ng  tests that can estimate the variability across machines of different architecture and as a result can reproduce with some error an experiment outcome on a different machine.\nFinally, Srinivasa et al.  manage to create a methodology that quantifies the process variation of smartphones at system level. Although different sources of performance variability have been investigated there is no mention of the configuration of the client side, even in survey papers   , even though it can affect the accuracy of measurements.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: the experimental setup. Several works have investigated this phenomenon in various settings, including scheduling algorithms of supercomputers , architectural simulations for multithreaded workloads [ref]2, and O3 optimizations in SPEC CPU2006 workloads . Additionally to measurement bias, other works [ref]47  have identified the network contention as a major contribution to the variability\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
