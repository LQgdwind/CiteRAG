      "content": "Paper Title: Prompt-Guided Zero-Shot Anomaly Action Recognition using Pretrained Deep Skeleton Features\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTwo action recognition datasets, RWF-2000 [ref]7 and Kinetics-250 [ref]20, are used for two evaluation settings discussed in Sec. 4.3.\nEach dataset has been examined using the supervised learning-based (SL) and unsupervised learning-based (USL) approaches, respectively.\nNote that our approach does not require any DNN training using normal samples, unlike such methods.\nFurthermore, we use two large-scale action recognition datasets, Kinetics-400  and NTU RGB+D 120 [ref]17, for pretraining the proposed DNNs.\nEach pretraining dataset is chosen respectively, taking into account the difference of the video source from the corresponding evaluation dataset or their domain gaps exist [ref]17, and a larger amount of actions is observed.\nTab. 1 depicts the combination of datasets used during the evaluation (training and testing) and pretraining phases. Kinetics-400.\nKinetics-400  is a large-scale action recognition dataset gathered from YouTube444youtube.com videos with 400 action classes.\nIt contains 250K training and 19K validation 10-second video clips with 30 fps. RWF-2000. RWF-2000 [ref]7 is the violence recognition dataset gathered from YouTube videos.\nThe videos feature two actions, either violent or non-violent, captured by security cameras with a variety of people and backgrounds.\nThere are 1.6K training and 0.4K test 5-second video clips with 30 fps.\nTwo-class labels are annotated for each video. NTU RGB+D 120. NTU RGB+D 120 [ref]17 is a large-scale action recognition dataset comprising videos captured in the laboratory environment.\nIt contains 114k videos with 120 action classes.\nWe use Cross-Setup (X-set) setting for the data split, where the camera setups are different between the training and testing phase [ref]20. Kinetics-250. Kinetics-250 [ref]20 is a subset of the Kinetics-400 dataset and consists of videos with 250 action categories.\nSince the Kinetics-400 dataset contains videos focused on human heads and arms, the accuracy of a skeleton-based approach is significantly impacted by these videos.\nAs a result, Markovitz et al. [ref]20 chose for evaluation the videos with the 250 action categories that performed the best in terms of action classification accuracy and allowed for the accurate detection of the skeleton.\nIn this study, we adopt the evaluation setting proposed by Markovitz et al., which is described in Sec. 4.3.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Two action recognition datasets, RWF-2000 [ref]7 and Kinetics-250 [ref]20, are used for two evaluation settings discussed in Sec. 4.3.\nEach dataset has been examined using the supervised learning-based (SL) and unsupervised learning-based\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
