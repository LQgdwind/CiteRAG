      "content": "Paper Title: Representation Learning on Heterostructures via Heterogeneous Anonymous Walks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNetwork Embedding (NE) [ref]1 [ref]2 has been a rolling network science and representation learning bandwagon in recent years. Researchers’ enthusiasm for NE stems from its ability to transform large-scale unstructured data into low-dimensional structured representations. It brings convenient and efficient solutions to a great number of tasks, such as node classification , link prediction , and knowledge reasoning [ref]5. The outbreak of NE research dates back to DeepWalk  that represents nodes in homogeneous networks. Hitherto, on homogeneous networks, almost all the methods have been devised to individually or simultaneously capture two complementary properties : proximity and structural similarity. The methods on the former, e.g., DeepWalk, aim to preserve the closeness among nodes into embeddings, while the methods capturing the latter, e.g., struc2vec , try to make embeddings discriminative on different structural patterns (or roles) . For example, the red nodes and blue nodes having different structures in Fig. 1(a) are in two structural roles. In recent years, structural role-based NE has attracted increasing attention, as it can be of great help in learning the function and behavior of nodes .\nIn essence, these methods usually rely on or imitate methods of structural feature extraction   and subgraph isomorphism test  . It’s worth noting that a series of them are developed based on anonymous walks (AWs)    to generate structural embeddings or enhance the hot field of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Because it’s theoretically proved that neighborhood structures of a node can be reconstructed with AWs starting from it . In the real world, heterogeneous networks are more common than homogeneous networks. Because the corresponding nodes of entities in real world usually have multiple types. The heterogeneous structures are much more complex, because the status can be amazingly diverse when different connection patterns meet various node types111For simplicity, we borrow the electronics term ”heterostructures” below to refer to the diverse heterogeneous structures.. We give an example via Fig. 1 to demonstrate this fact. The heterogeneous pinwheel has the same connecting patterns as the homogeneous pinwheel. However, with just one more node type, the number of node roles in the former network is three times that of the latter. Therefore, learning representations on heterostructures is a more comprehensive issue, as representing homogeneous structures is only a special case of it. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid on heterogeneous structural NE. Although NE on heterogeneous networks is also thriving , almost all of existing heterogeneous NE methods can be considered as extensions of those proximity-based homogeneous works in the view of topology. For example, metapath2vec  and HIN2vec  extend DeepWalk and explore meta-paths with biased random walks. R-GCN , HetSAGNN  and HGT  are aware of relation types with GNN architectures. Thus, these methods flounder on learning heterostructures. To our best knowledge, node2bits  is the only existing method that tries to fuse both node types and structural features into embeddings. However, it does not consider the combination of node types and underlying structures as a whole (i.e., heterostructure). And its random walk-based feature aggregation and hashing style cannot learn delicate underlying structures. To fill the big void of NE on heterostructures, we present a terrific amount of work in this paper. The key point is to discriminate the structures mixed with various node types. To this end, we firstly propose a novel technology, heterogeneous anonymous walk (HAW), where AW is a special case of it on homogeneous networks. And we prove that one can reconstruct heterogeneous neighborhood heterostructures when the distribution of HAWs is known. However, the number of possible HAWs of a given length is usually excessive and in result estimating the exact distribution is practically impossible. To avert this problem, we provide heterogeneous anonymous walk embedding (HAWE) that samples HAWs to capture heterostructures in a data-dirven manner and learns node embeddings by predicting HAWs starting from each node. Additionally, we design coarse HAW (CHAW) for more applicability, and the coarse HAWE (CHAWE) that employs the metioned embedding mechanism on CHAWs. Finally, we conduct sufficient and intuitive experiments on synthetic and real-world networks222Both the code of our methods and used data in this paper can be found at github.com/naihemeng/HAWE. that we process for building the first benchmark on heterostructure learning. Compared with both classic homogeneous and heterogeneous NE methods, our HAWE and its variant perform outstandinfly on representing heterostructures. In summary, our contributions are listed as follows: As far as we know, we are the first to directly study NE that captures heterostructures. We propose the novel heterogeneous anonymous walk which has theoretical guarantee on reconstructing heterogeneous neighborhood structures, and its more practical variant coarse HAW. We provide an effective heterogeneous structural NE method HAWE. It generates embeddings by predicting HAWs starting from each node. We also give its variant CHAWE which applies the same mechanism on CHAWs. We give the first benchmark on heterostructure learning. The sufficient and intuitive experiments shows that our methods achieves excellent performance on distinguishing heterostructures and can be applied on large-scale networks.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Network Embedding (NE) [ref]1 [ref]2 has been a rolling network science and representation learning bandwagon in recent years.
