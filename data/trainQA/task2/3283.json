      "content": "Paper Title: DeHIN: A Decentralized Framework for Embedding Large-scale Heterogeneous Information Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo show the performance of DeHIN, we compare it with several strong baselines that are designed for HNE task. metapath2vec [ref]7: In-order to capture the heterogeneity, metapath2vec utilizes the node paths generated through guided random walks. These path specifically captures the node context. PTE [ref]37: This method decomposes a heterogeneous network into number of bipartite networks, each representing a relationship type. Its objective function computes the sum of log-likelihood over all bipartite networks. HIN2Vec 0: HIN2Vec is a neural network model that is also based on metapaths. Given a set of relationships specified by meta-paths, HIN2Vec is able to learn expressive node representations from heterogeneous networks. HEER : This method extends PTE by computing the closeness between types of relationships. R-GCN : R-GCN aggregates neighbours having same edge types and considers edge heterogeneity by learning multiple convolution\nmatrices. HAN : HAN uses attention mechanism that learns wights of node neighbourhood, sampled using meta-path generation mechanism. MAGNN : Embeddings are learned in MAGNN using meta-path based neighborhood and edge type information to parametrizes a transformer-based self attention architecture. HGT : Transformer-based self-attention model is used in HGT, parametrized by edge type. TransE : This method models relationship among nodes by interpreting them as translations operating on the node embeddings. DistMult : DistMult develops a simple bilinear model by generalizing NTN  and TransE, for learning low dimensional vector representation of network nodes. ComplEx : ComplEx approach the link prediction problem using latent factorization to compute complex valued embeddings. ConvE : ConvE consists of a single convolution layer, projection layer and an inner product layer, specifically designed for the link prediction in knowledge graphs. The embedding dimensions of all baselines is set to 32, and all other hyperparameters are tuned following the original papers. Implementations of these methods in python package is provided by https://github.com/yangji9181/HNE. The above methods are, however, centralized models. These methods incur memory constraints and are time-consuming on a single computing unit. In order to show the efficiency of DeHIN, we also compare it with the following distributed network embedding frameworks: DeLNE 9: DeLNE adopts data parallelism approach to embed large-scale networks. As it is originally designed for homogeneous graphs, we implement DeLNE on heterogeneous by treating all node and edge types uniformly. PBG : PyTorch-BigGraph is a distributed system that trains on an input graph by ingesting its list of edges and their relation types. It outputs an embedding for each node by placing linked nodes close in the vector space. DDHH: DDHH is a large-scale decentralized HIN embedding framework, we presented in . DDHH adopts centralized partitioning strategy and uses orthogonal alignment mechanism, while only considering the first instance of the node received at the server. DeHIN-Basic: In order to study the effectiveness of our alignment mechanism and ablation study, we remove alignment settings of DeHIN to construct DeHIN-Basic.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: To show the performance of DeHIN, we compare it with several strong baselines that are designed for HNE task. metapath2vec [ref]7: In-order to capture the heterogeneity, metapath2vec utilizes the node paths generated through guided random walks. These path specifically captures the node context. PTE [ref]37: This method\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
