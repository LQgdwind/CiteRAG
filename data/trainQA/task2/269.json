      "content": "Paper Title: TEA: Temporal Excitation and Aggregation for Action Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we first compare TEA with the existing state-of-the-art action recognition methods on Something-Something V1 and Kinetics400. The comprehensive statistics, including the classification results, inference protocols, and the corresponding FLOPs, are shown in Table 2 and 3. In both tables, the first compartment contains the methods based on 3D CNNs or the mixup of 2D and 3D CNNs, and the methods in the second compartment are all based on 2D or (2+1)D CNNs. Due to the high computation costs of 3D CNNs, the FLOPs of methods in the first compartment are typically higher than others. Among all existing methods, the most efficient ones are TSN8f 4 and TSM8f [ref]27 with only 33G FLOPs. Compared with these methods, the FLOPs of our proposed TEA network slightly increases to 35G (1.06×\\times), but the performance is increased by a big margin, a relative improvement of 5.4 % (48.8% vs. 43.4%). 1. “ImgNet” denotes ImageNet dataset   and “None” indicates training models from scratch. 2. “N/A” represents that the authors do not report the inference protocol in their paper. The superiority of our TEA on Something-Something is quite impressive. It confirms the remarkable ability of TEA for temporal modeling. Using efficient inference protocol (center crop×\\times1 clip) and 8 input frames, the proposed TEA obtains 48.8%, which significantly outperforms TSN and TSM with similar FLOPs (19.7%/43.4%). This results even exceeds the ensemble result of TSM, which combines the two models using 8 and 16 frames, respectively (TSMEn, 46.8%). When utilizing 16 frames as input and applying a more laborious accuracy evaluation protocol (full resolution×\\times10 clips), the FLOPs of our method increase to ∼similar-to\\sim2000G, which is similar to NL I3D+GCN 6. But the proposed method significantly surpasses NL I3D+GCN and all other existing methods (52.3% vs. 46.1%) on the validation set. Our performance on the test set (46.6%) also outperforms most of the existing methods. Moreover, we do not require additional COCO images  to pre-train an object detector as in 6. When compared with the methods utilizing both RGB and optical flow modalities, i.e., ECOEn-(RGB+Flow)  (49.5%) and TSM-(RGB+Flow) [ref]27 (50.2%), the obtained result (52.3%) also shows substantial improvements. On Kinetics400, the performance of our method (76.1%) is inferior to that of SlowFast  (79.8%). However, the SlowFast networks adopt the deeper networks (ResNet101) based on 3D CNNs and utilize time-consuming non-local 5 operations. When comparing methods with similar efficiency, such as TSM [ref]27 and STM , TEA obtains better performance. When adopting 8 frames as input, TEA gains ∼similar-to\\sim1% higher accuracy than TSM (75.0% vs. 74.1%). While utilizing 16 input frames, our TEA method outperforms both TSM16f and STM 16f with a large margin (76.1% vs. 74.7%/73.7%). Finally, we report comparison results on HMDB51 and UCF101 in Table 4. Our method achieves 73.3% on HMDB51 and 96.9% on UCF101 with the accuracy inference protocol. The performance of our model (TEA16f) outperforms most of the existing methods except for I3D . I3D is based on 3D CNNs and additional input modality; thus, its computational FLOPs will be far more than ours. 1. MCA denotes mean class accuracy. 2. TSM does not report MCA results, and the listed results are cited from STM .\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: to the high computation costs of 3D CNNs, the FLOPs of methods in the first compartment are typically higher than others.
