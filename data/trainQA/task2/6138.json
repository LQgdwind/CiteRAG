      "content": "Paper Title: On Practical Robust Reinforcement Learning: Adjacent Uncertainty Set and Double-Agent Algorithm\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo address the above challenges, we first design a new uncertainty set by elaborating Huber‚Äôs RùëÖR-contamination uncertainty set [ref]31  in a more practical way. An additional pessimistic agent is presented, which makes it possible to construct DNN-based algorithms for MF-RRL with continuous state spaces. We remark that the pessimistic agent has completely different objective than adversarial agents in [ref]7  [ref]9  . Incorporating the idea of the pessimistic agent into the famous DNN-based RL algorithms, we develop double-agent algorithms consisting of the pessimistic and robust (or original) agents for MF-RRL. Our major contributions are summarized as follows. We propose an adjacent RùëÖR-contamination uncertainty set by excluding implausible MDPs (or state transitions) from the RùëÖR-contamination uncertainty set [ref]31 . Our uncertainty set contains perturbed MDPs that allow state transitions only to neighboring states (i.e., the states with non-zero transition probabilities from a N-MDP). This set is more reasonable given that the training environment (i.e., the N-MDP) is designed by reflecting a practical environment as close as possible. We derive the robust Bellman operator for the proposed uncertainty set. Using this, we develop a sample-based RRL algorithm (named ARQ-Learning) for the tabular setting and characterize its finite-time error bound. Also, we prove that it can converge as fast as the standard Q-Learning  and robust Q-Learning [ref]31 while ensuring better robustness. A pessimistic agent is additionally introduced, which can solve the key maximization in the robust Bellman operator using samples from the training environment. Combining the idea of the pessimistic agent with the famous RL algorithms (e.g., deep-Q network (DQN)  and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) ), we for the first time develop DNN-based algorithms for MF-RRL with continuous state spaces. Remarkably, our idea can be naturally combined with many other model-free RL algorithms such as soft actor critic , twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) , proximal policy optimization (PPO) , and so on. Via experiments, it is shown that our algorithms can achieve higher rewards than the standard RL and robust RL algorithms, when there are some perturbations between the training and testing environments. These results can demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty set.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: To address the above challenges, we first design a new uncertainty set by elaborating Huber‚Äôs RùëÖR-contamination uncertainty set [ref]31  in a more practical way.
