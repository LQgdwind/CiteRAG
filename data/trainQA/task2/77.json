      "content": "Paper Title: Progress Report on Numerical Modeling of a Prototype Fuel Cell: 1. Comparison between Mathematical Formulations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe original mathematical formulation, henceforth denominated Alpha,\ncan be found in [ref]28, but a brief description will be given below\nfollowed by the improvements which are the focus of this work. The momentum transport is described using the (compressible) Darcy-Brinkman\nformulation (DB), which covers both free and porous media flow,\ncoupled to conservation of mass: where ρ𝜌\\rho and μ𝜇\\mu are the fluid’s density and kinematic viscosity,\nrespectively, 𝐮𝐮\\mathbf{u} is the velocity field vector, P𝑃P is the relative\npressure, and ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon and κ𝜅\\kappa are the domain’s porosity and\npermeability, respectively (ϵ=1italic-ϵ1\\epsilon=1 and κ→∞→𝜅\\kappa\\rightarrow\\infty for\nfree flow). As shown in [ref]28, DB provides a better description of\nthis system when compared to a Stokes-Darcy approach, i.e. manually coupling\nthe Navier-Stokes equation for the Ch domain and Darcy’s law for porous media.\nThe parameters are shown in Table 2, chosen in order to describe\nthe materials and conditions used (see  for additional\ninformation). A normal inflow velocity, as inlet, and a constant pressure\nboundary conditions, for the outlet, were used. The species transport was originally modeled using a diluted-species\napproach, coupling the advection-reaction equation: to Fick’s law of diffusion, which defines the molar diffusive flux vector: where DO3subscript𝐷subscriptO3D_{\\mathrm{O_{3}}} and CO3subscript𝐶subscriptO3C_{\\mathrm{O_{3}}} are the diffusion coefficient\nand the concentration of ozone, respectively. Given the inlet concentration of\nthe species of interest, CO3,insubscript𝐶subscriptO3inC_{\\mathrm{O_{3},in}}, of the order 103​ppmsuperscript103ppm10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{ppm}, such an approach was considered reasonable[ref]28. The\ndiffusion was corrected for porous media transport: where fPm=fPm​(ϵ,τ)subscript𝑓Pmsubscript𝑓Pmitalic-ϵ𝜏f_{\\mathrm{Pm}}=f_{\\mathrm{Pm}}\\left(\\epsilon,\\tau\\right), with\nτ𝜏\\tau being the medium’s tortuosity. A common form for fPmsubscript𝑓Pmf_{\\mathrm{Pm}} is: which might be readily used whenever τ𝜏\\tau is available, as is the case of the\nMPS domain. Otherwise, a porous medium model might be used, typically with the\nform τ=τ​(ϵ)𝜏𝜏italic-ϵ\\tau=\\tau\\left(\\epsilon\\right). In this case, for the CL domain, the\nMillington & Quirk model was used, as implemented in the\nsoftware, giving τ=ϵ1/2𝜏superscriptitalic-ϵ12\\tau=\\epsilon^{1/2}. The reaction term was defined by a\nhomogeneous first-order reaction: where the apparent reaction rate constant, kappsubscript𝑘appk_{\\mathrm{app}}, is a free\nparameter to be adjusted against experimental data. Parameters are shown in\nTable 2. Finally, for the sake of reference, the mesh used in [ref]28\nfollowed a custom-made procedure, based on the software’s recommendations, with\nca. 1.7×1061.7superscript1061.7\\times 10^{6} domain elements. The set of equations was solved using a\ntwo-step segregated solver, with each step using an implementation of the\nPARDISO linear solver, to a relative tolerance of 10−3superscript10310^{-3}.\nA parametric solver was used to vary the inlet flow rate, with initial value\nQ=200​cm3​min−1𝑄200superscriptcm3superscriptmin1Q=200\\ \\mathrm{cm^{3}\\ min^{-1}} and a step of δ​Q=50​cm3​min−1𝛿𝑄50superscriptcm3superscriptmin1\\delta Q=50\\ \\mathrm{cm^{3}\\ min^{-1}} up to 450​cm3​min−1450superscriptcm3superscriptmin1450\\ \\mathrm{cm^{3}\\ min^{-1}}, where each solution was used\nas the next step’s initial value.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: The original mathematical formulation, henceforth denominated Alpha,\ncan be found in [ref]28, but a brief description will be given below\nfollowed by the improvements which are the focus of this work.
