Originated from game theory , the work in  reformulates the min-max optimization problem of adversarial learning as Nash equilibrium 8. The game-theory based optimization method [ref]17 can effectively reduce the high computational cost without sacrificing adversarial accuracy. Most of existing approaches only focus on improving robustness but ignore the deterioration of clean accuracy. Especially, the work  has empirically proved the trade-off information between the adversarial accuracy and the clean accuracy. Kannan et al.  and Zhang et al.  construct the surrogate loss function to make the difference of clean images and adversarial counterparts smaller. Madry et al.  conclude that larger capacity size of neural networks can improve the performance under adversarial attacks. it is known that most neural network models running in our electronic devices are very tiny because the devices have constraints on the energy consumption and the amount of storage for the models. Hence, we aim to figure out which kind of tiny neural network architectures can be effective for the resilience of adversarial perturbations. Neural Network Architecture Search aims to replace handcrafted architecture search with automated machine learning technique. Representative search algorithms includes evolutionary algorithms  , reinforcement learning  , and gradient-based methods   . In one-shot NAS , the authors  construct a supernet which can generate every possible architecture in the search space. The work in  train a supernet for once and then at search time, they can obtain various fitness value for different subnets by weight sharing from the supernet. But most of them employ a single-objective optimization approach to search, which is not well suited for solving the trade-off problem . In order to solve the multi-objective optimization problem, we adopt the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II)  as our search algorithm. Inspired by , we try to investigate the influence of neural network depth on network resilience as the adversarial attack. Furthermore, we also investigate the relationship between the supernet and its subnets in our one-shot multi-objective NAS framework and give a hint on how to adversarial train supernet to obtain the better adversarial performance of subnets.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Adversarial Training is the most common defensive mechanism against adversarial attacks [ref]2, which uses both clean and adversarial images for training.
