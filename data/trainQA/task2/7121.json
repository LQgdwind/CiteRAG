With OPP, the coarse in-distribution details have been primarily compensated. However, considering the limited size and quality of the training dataset, the results are still unsatisfying in vivid detail. Thus, to break through such limitation, we turn to the rich out-distribution priors from the diffusion models [ref]2 [ref]3 pre-trained on billions of high-quality images. A naive solution of using such an image diffusion model is to perform super-resolution [ref]2 [ref]3 on each rendered view from the OPP individually. Nevertheless, due to the lack of 3D constraints, this will lead to significant inconsistency between different views. Although the recent zero-shot video editing method [ref]9 has explored maintaining the temporal consistency between edited video frames, it simply assumes the input video to contain very similar contents, and\ndirectly employing it in the 3D NVS task will lead to the following issues: (i) Dispersed sparse keyframes lead to blurry outputs. At the core of  [ref]9 is to first maintain the consistency between several keyframes (e.g., 5) using Inflated Self-Attention (ISA)  and then propagate the U-Net self-attention output tokens of keyframes to nearby ones. A possible naive adaptation is to uniformly disperse the keyframes around the dome, however, due to the large variance of contents from dispersed sparse views, the ISA tends to get blurry outputs, as illustrated by Fig. 9. On the other hand, simply increasing the keyframe number will greatly increase memory usage, which is unaffordable. (ii) Unable to process arbitrary views. A 3D enhancer should support the processing of an arbitrary given view. However, as a video processing method, [ref]9 simply assumes the input videos are consecutive and calculates the propagation weights via the frame index, which is not suitable for the arbitrary view processing case. Diffusion-based 3D Enhancer. Targeting the aforementioned issues, we propose the fine-stage method Diffusion-based 3D Enhancer (Diff3DE), a 3D extension of  [ref]9, as illustrated in Fig. 5. The main idea of Diff3DE is to relax the input of the original ISA from all the keyframes to neighbor keyframe sets selected based on view distance. In detail, we first fix Nksubscript𝑁𝑘N_{k} dense keyframes {Iid}i=1NksuperscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscriptI𝑖𝑑𝑖1subscript𝑁𝑘\\{\\textbf{I}_{i}^{d}\\}_{i=1}^{N_{k}} uniformly dispersed around the dome. Then, given a target view IgsuperscriptI𝑔\\textbf{I}^{g}, we select its 333 neighbors {Ic1d,Ic2d,Ic3d}superscriptsubscriptIsubscript𝑐1𝑑superscriptsubscriptIsubscript𝑐2𝑑superscriptsubscriptIsubscript𝑐3𝑑\\{\\textbf{I}_{c_{1}}^{d},\\textbf{I}_{c_{2}}^{d},\\textbf{I}_{c_{3}}^{d}\\} from {Iid}superscriptsubscriptI𝑖𝑑\\{\\textbf{I}_{i}^{d}\\} using the cosine similarity, which can be calculated by the provided camera poses. After that, the neighbor set {Ic1d,Ic2d,Ic3d}superscriptsubscriptIsubscript𝑐1𝑑superscriptsubscriptIsubscript𝑐2𝑑superscriptsubscriptIsubscript𝑐3𝑑\\{\\textbf{I}_{c_{1}}^{d},\\textbf{I}_{c_{2}}^{d},\\textbf{I}_{c_{3}}^{d}\\} are taken as the input of the ISA to ensure the local consistency, and for each diffusion time step and U-Net attention block layer, their output tokens of the ISA module {ϕc1d,ϕc2d,ϕc3d}superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕsubscript𝑐1𝑑superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕsubscript𝑐2𝑑superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕsubscript𝑐3𝑑\\{\\phi_{c_{1}}^{d},\\phi_{c_{2}}^{d},\\phi_{c_{3}}^{d}\\} are further propagated to the target view using the correspondence calculated with original input frames during the DDIM inversion stage (see [ref]9 for more details), formulating the propagated tokens {ϕc1d→t,ϕc2d→t,ϕc3d→t}superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕsubscript𝑐1→𝑑𝑡superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕsubscript𝑐2→𝑑𝑡superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕsubscript𝑐3→𝑑𝑡\\{\\phi_{c_{1}}^{d\\rightarrow t},\\phi_{c_{2}}^{d\\rightarrow t},\\phi_{c_{3}}^{d\\rightarrow t}\\}. Finally, we perform a weighted sum on the propagated tokens using the barycentric interpolation: where l𝑙l indicates the camera location, B​a​r​y​(⋅,⋅,⋅,⋅)𝐵𝑎𝑟𝑦⋅⋅⋅⋅Bary(\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot) is the function for calculating barycentric weights, and ϕtsuperscriptitalic-ϕ𝑡\\phi^{t} is the final aggregated ISA output tokens for IgsuperscriptI𝑔\\textbf{I}^{g}. With Diff3DE, the processing of each view is determined by its pose instead of the frame index as in [ref]9, making it work in a 3D manner. Notably, though the global consistency between all the keyframes is not explicitly constrained in Diff3DE, i.e., we do not send all the keyframes to ISA considering the computation cost, it is approximately maintained by: 1) the input frames are from the 3D-consistent OPP, which naturally provides certain 3D constraints, and 2) enforcing the local consistency for each neighbor area approximates the global consistency.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: and quality of the training dataset, the results are still unsatisfying in vivid detail.
