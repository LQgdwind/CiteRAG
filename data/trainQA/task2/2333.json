      "content": "Paper Title: ADVANCING CTC-CRF BASED END-TO-END SPEECH RECOGNITION WITH WORDPIECES AND CONFORMERS\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA typical Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system usually consists of acoustic model (AM), language model (LM) and pronunciation model (PM).\nDepending on how to organize the above components during training and inference, current ASR systems can be divided into two main categories, namely hybrid and end-to-end (E2E) systems. Hybrid systems usually optimize each component separately and combine AM and LM with a PM during inference stage. Such modular optimization of hybrid systems can make full use of data (i.e. unpaired-text for LM training), whereas training (i.e. forced alignment, tree-based clustering, etc.) is very complicated. In contrast, E2E systems aim to simplify the training pipeline and fold all the components into a single neural network (NN) to optimize jointly. There are various types of E2E systems, including E2E-LF-MMI-based , CTC-based [ref]2 , Attention-based Seq2Seq   and RNN-T  . Generally, E2E systems can be trained in an elegant way with very promising results but tend to be data-hungry, and require tons of paired speech data. Compared with hybrid and E2E systems, the recently developed CTC-CRF [ref]8 [ref]9 framework inherits the data-efficiency of the hybrid approach and the simplicity of the end-to-end approach.\nIt has been shown that CTC-CRF outperforms regular CTC consistently on a wide range of benchmarks, and is on par with other state-of-the-art end-to-end models [ref]8 [ref]9 0. This work aims to further advance the CTC-CRF based ASR technique with explorations on modeling units and neural architectures. Recently, wordpiece-based modeling units  1 and Conformer neural networks 2 have demonstrated their effectiveness in other ASR architectures (hybrid, RNN-T).\nIt has been shown in [ref]8 that mono-char CTC-CRFs work well, but yield worse results compared with monophone CTC-CRFs. Previous work in CTC-CRFs only use BLSTM [ref]8 and VGG-BLSTM [ref]9 for neural architectures, which are somewhat old-fashioned.\nIt is highly possible that wordpiece modeling units and Conformer neural networks can bring performance gains when coupled with the CTC-CRF loss. This paper tries to answer these questions through technique investigation and extensive experiments. After an overview of related work on wordpiece modeling units and Conformer neural architectures in Section 2.1 and Section 2.2 respectively, we introduce the CTC-CRF framework (Section 3) and present the techniques pertaining to modeling units, neural architectures, data augmentation and the learning rate scheduler to train Conformers in Section 4, which enable the successful application of wordpieces and Conformer in CTC-CRFs. Then, we evaluate the techniques on three datasets (Switchboard, Librispeech and CommonVoice German) respectively in Section 5. The ablation study in Section 5.4 aims to clarify how different techniques affect the recognition performance compared to that of [ref]8 [ref]9. Our main contribution is that we successfully advance CTC-CRF based ASR techniques with wordpieces and Conformers, and the experimental results are very competitive among the state-of-the-art results on the three datastes.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: to simplify the training pipeline and fold all the components into a single neural network (NN) to optimize jointly.
