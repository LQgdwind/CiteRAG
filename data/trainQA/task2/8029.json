      "content": "Paper Title: An Empirical Comparison of Video Frame Sampling Methods for Multi-Modal RAG Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe large language models (LLMs) display surprising emergent abilities [ref]1. The in-context learning ability [ref]2 has enabled the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  pattern which is now widely adopted across industry domains and it involves fact-checking from verified external corpus [ref]4 to ensure that LLM responses are correct. The RAG pattern mostly involves text data where text chunking  is important to ensure external corpus fits into LLM context limit. The development of multi-modal large language models  has facilitated the implementation of the Video RAG pattern (as shown in Figure¬†1) (e.g. ‚Äòsteps to change the fuse on the fuse box in a car‚Äô) which can be utilized for Visual Question Answering (VQA) downstream task. GPT-4 Turbo with Vision (GPT-4V) and GPT-4 Omni can analyse both text and the image data . Moreover, GPT-4V can grasp temporal relationships and interpretation of dynamic visual content . Video key frames cover the content of the whole video . Video frame sampling (through identification of key frames) step for Video RAG plays similar role as text chunking does for document RAG . Numerous video sampling methods exist in the literature, making it difficult to choose the right one without comparing them properly, this challenge has led to the investigative work presented here. The primary goal of our work is to compare the trade-off between quantity of sampled frames and the video-level & frame-level retrieval recall score as the measure of efficacy for various frame sampling methods. RAG pattern involves storing the vector representation of text / image data into a vector database and retrieving the relevant text / image based on text query. Our work focuses on the storage and retrieval of only image data (video frames that are linked to a video) required by the Video RAG pattern. While storing each video frame could seem to be the most obvious and straightforward choice from sampling methods, it may not be the most efficient as videos require more space for storage  which could result in significantly high storage and processing requirements. We aimed to explore relevant sampling methods that may offer video and frame retrieval efficacy of sampling each video frame while requiring comparatively smaller storage footprint with fewer frames required to be added into a vector database. Our investigation indicates that the recall@kùëòk metric for both text-to-video and text-to-frame retrieval tasks using various methods covered as part of this work is comparable to or exceeds that of storing each frame (the 1 FPS baseline explained in Section 3.1), with the additional benefit of reduction in the number of frames required, which would also lead to reduced storage and computational demands. We hope the details of our work as given in subsequent sections will guide the frame sampling method selection for Video RAG use case implementations. The key technical contributions of our paper include: A side-by-side comparison of recall@kùëòk performance for different video frame sampling methods (including concatenation of the embeddings from different models) used in text-to-video and text-to-frame search with results broken down by video category. An examination of how recall@kùëòk relates to the number of frames in videos. A new way to add text annotations to video frames using large language models that understand both text and images. A simplistic approach to adjust similarity score thresholds dynamically to compare result against the static threshold approach.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: The large language models (LLMs) display surprising emergent abilities [ref]1.
