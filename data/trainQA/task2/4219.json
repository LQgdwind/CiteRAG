Their application ranges from conventional multi-core CPUs, e.g., in cloud servers, to massively scaled systems used as low-power neuromorphic edge AI accelerators. In any case, Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) have become the de facto communication infrastructure for their excellent scaling capability. Examples showing the nearly universal use of NoCs are data-flow or parallel processors, e.g., manycores , big data , server-scale AI , edge AI , data bases , in-memory computing [ref]6, genome sequencing , medical applications . Due to the wide use of NoCs, many design tools have been created, e.g.,  0. They are used for design space exploration (DSE) with software simulations or hardware prototypes that evaluate key performance metrics (KPIs) and guide the architect. Traditionally, NoC simulators target multi-core CPUs. With the emergence of edge AI accelerators, there is a need for more versatile tools for changing applications or mappings, as contributed by this work. A typical DSE flow comprises the following: Architectural simulators are fast and flexible, providing early critical insights. After implementing a register transfer level (RTL) model, these can be simulated. This is slow and practically only helpful in verifying or evaluating small parts of any design. Therefore, emulation on FPGAs is highly relevant as of massive speed improvements 1 2 for any architecture optimization 3. One key downside of FPGA emulation is its limited flexibility to adapt to novel use cases 2. In other words, for every new NoC use case, the RTL design of all cores, etc., would be required. The availability of these models is unrealistic in an early design stage, hindering the deployment of NoCs for emerging use cases. This paper provides an effective solution. We contribute an open-source framework111 https://github.com/ICE-RWTH/EmuNoC for NoC hybrid emulation, in which the traffic pattern can easily be switched by software models, but the NoC is emulated on the FPGA for high performance and accuracy (Fig. 1). We propose a novel clock-synchronization method and hardware-only packet generation that improves the emulation speed by more than one magnitude. Specifically, this paper yields the following novelties: We propose a hardware clock halting technique for faster hybrid emulation, which shows a speedup of 79.3×\\times for synthetic traffic and 36.3×\\times for Netrace 4 over the previous state-of-the-art emulation framework. We contribute a novel concept of a single clock synchronous serializer used as a Network Interface (NI) for NoCs with virtual channels (VCs). We evaluate our system for different case studies (multi-core CPUs, edge AI accelerators) to show flexibility. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we will introduce the background for hybrid emulation of NoCs and discuss the related works. In Sec. III, we will explain our architecture. In Sec. IV we will analyze the system performance. Finally, the paper is concluded.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: scaling capability.
