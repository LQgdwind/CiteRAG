      "content": "Paper Title: Attention-based model for predicting question relatedness on Stack Overflow\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe are interested in answering the following research questions: RQ1: How much improvement can ASIM achieve over the two baseline models SOFTSVM and DOTBILSTM, to predict question relatedness? Motivation. ASIM adopts the deep learning technique and can better learn the interaction information between knowledge unit pairs based on the attention mechanism, which is quite different from the SOFTSVM and the DOTBILSTM. Moreover, the DOTBILSTM is the state-of-the-art model on the Knowledge Unit dataset. The answer to this research question will shed light on whether and to what extent ASIM can improve the results on predicting question relatedness on Stack Overflow. Approach. We compare the performance of ASIM on the test set with the SOFTSVM and the DOTBILSTM. We evaluate different models on Precision, Recall, and Micro-F1 metrics. The results of the SOFTSVM and the DOTBISLTM are from the paper , which keeps the results to two decimal places. To present the results more accurately, we keep the results of ASIM to four decimal places. Result. Table II presents the experiment result. We can see that compared with DOTBILSTM and SOFTSVM, ASIM has improved by 7% and 23%, respectively, in terms of the Micro-F1. There is a similar improvement to the Precision and Recall. RQ1: The experiment result shows that ASIM, based on attention mechanism, outperforms the baseline approaches SOFTSVM and DOTBILSTM in all the evaluation metrics and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Knowledge Unit dataset. RQ2: Compared with the SOFTSVM and the DOTBILSTM, how effective is ASIM in predicting knowledge unit pairs of different relatedness classes? Motivation. The semantic relatedness between the knowledge unit pairs of different classes is inconsistent, and the prediction difficulty of the model is also different. We hope to compare ASIM’s prediction performances with that of two baseline models on each class of knowledge unit to study the improvement and advantages of ASIM better. Approach. We compare ASIM’s prediction results on each knowledge unit class with the SOFTSVM and DOTBILSTM on the F1-score metric. The results of the two baseline models are from the paper . Result. It can be seen from Table III that ASIM outperforms DOTBiLSTM and SOFTSVM in all four classes. For the duplicate class, because there is a high degree of semantic relatedness between the two knowledge units, the DOTBILSTM’s performance is well in this class. Hence, ASIM has a slight improvement (1%) compared with DOTBILSTM. For the remaining three classes, ASIM’s improvement is more significant (5%-13%) compared with DOTBILSTM. However, there is a certain degree of semantic relatedness between knowledge units of direct and indirect classes, but the distinction between these two classes is no obvious. Therefore, ASIM performs worse in these two classes than duplicate and isolated classes, and these two classes are also bottlenecks to limit the overall performance of ASIM. For the isolated class, ASIM can predict well and achieve competitive performance because there is no semantic relatedness between the knowledge units, which can be well recognized. RQ2: ASIM outperforms the two baseline models on all four classes. Besides, for direct, indirect, and isolated classes, ASIM’s improvement is more significant. RQ3: How much influence does the attention mechanism contribute to the improvement of ASIM? Motivation. The attention mechanism is a crucial part of ASIM, and it helps the model capture the semantic interaction between knowledge units, which is quite different from the previous models. The answer to this research question helps us understand the importance of the attention mechanism to the ASIM. Approach. We remove the Attention Layer (Attn) and compare the revised model’s performance with the original model on the F1-score. Specifically, we remove the Attention Layer and the Fusion Layer simultaneously and remove the related Shortcut Connections. Although this setup may show the layer importance, it is unclear whether the Fusion Layer or the Attention Layer or the Shortcut Connection is the most important. Thus, we also perform the following ablation studies, consisting in (1) only removing Fusion Layer (FL) and replacing by a concatenation operation; (2) Only removing the Shortcut Connections (SC) related to the Attention Layer and (3) removing both the Fusion Layer and the Shortcut Connections. Then, we measure how much these isolated modifications impact model’s performance. Result. The experimental results are shown in Table IV. After removing the Fusion Layer or Shortcut Connection, respectively, or removing both of them, the revised models’ performance decreases slightly (0.9%, 0.6%, and 1.0% in terms of Micro-F1, respectively). However, after removing the Attention Layer, the model’s performance decreases more obviously (3.8% in Micro-F1), especially in predicting the direct and the indirect classes. This experiment proves the importance of the attention mechanism, which plays an essential role in predicting questions relatedness. The attention mechanism’s introduction has a more prominent effect on the direct class and the indirect class. Furthermore, even if the attention mechanism is removed, our model’s performance still outperforms the two baseline models. RQ3: The attention mechanism improves the performance of ASIM to some extent. Moreover, the attention mechanism plays an essential role in the prediction of direct and indirect classes. RQ4: What is the impact of domain-specific word embeddings on the performance improvement of ASIM?  Motivation. In this work, we built a 15GB corpus based on Stack Overflow data dump and trained word embeddings specific to the domain of software engineering on this corpus. We want to know whether and to what extent the domain-specific word embeddings improve the results compared with the word embeddings in the general domain. The answer to this research question helps us understand the improvement of using our pre-trained word embeddings for this task. Approach. We replaced the word embeddings used in the experiment with the GloVe word embeddings 444http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip consistent with Shirani et al. and experimented. The rest of the model remains unchanged and compared with the original model on the F1-score metric. Result. Table V presents the experiment result. After replacing the word embeddings with GloVe word embeddings, the ASIM’s performance drops slightly, which proves the importance of domain-specific word embeddings. RQ4: Compared with GloVe word embeddings, using the word embeddings specific to the software engineering domain can make ASIM achieve better performance. So, appropriate domain-specific word embeddings are also important in some tasks. RQ5: How is the generalization ability of ASIM?  Motivation. The duplicate question detection in PCQA websites is also a task to study the semantic relatedness in software engineering. Compared with predicting question relatedness, the most significant difference is that this task requires boolean prediction to determine whether a pair of questions is duplicate. We hope to apply ASIM to a similar but different software engineering task to explore the generalization performance and its robustness. Approach. For the experiment dataset, we choose the no-clue version of the AskUbuntu duplicate question detection dataset (hereafter, AskUbuntu dataset) constructed by Rodrigues et al. [ref]16. In the AskUbuntu dataset, 24K question pairs are used for training, 6K for testing, and 1K for validation. The two classes of the AskUbuntu dataset are balanced, thus with an equal number of duplicate and non-duplicate question pairs. We randomly select two question pair samples of each class and list them in Table VI. Since the dataset only contains questions but not answers, we concatenate the question’s title and body as the model’s input and modify the Prediction Layer’s output to 2 classes. The other part of the model remains unchanged. We use the same set of hyper-parameters tuned in the Knowledge Unit dataset’ validation set. The ASIM is trained for 30 epochs and compares the model’s accuracy on the test set with the DOTBILSTM, SOFTSVM, and the baseline models in the paper [ref]16. The results of the DOTBILSTM and SOFTSVM are from the paper , and the results of the other baseline models are from the paper [ref]16. Result. Table VII presents the results. ASIM significantly outperforms other models, including rule-based approaches (Jcrd [ref]34), classifiers (SVM-bas , SVM-adv [ref]16, and SOFTSVM), and neural networks (CNN , DNN , DCNN [ref]16, and DOTBILSTM), achieves an accuracy of 96.25%. Moreover, DCNN is the best model in the paper [ref]16 on the AskUbuntu dataset, which combines the CNN and DNN, and the SOFTSVM is the state-of-the-art model on this dataset. RQ5: ASIM can also achieve good performance in the duplicate question detection task of AskUbuntu, a different software engineering task. ASIM outperforms the SOTA model on this dataset and proves its generalization ability and robustness.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: robustness.
