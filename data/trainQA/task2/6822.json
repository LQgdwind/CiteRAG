      "content": "Paper Title: Vision Relation Transformer for Unbiased Scene Graph Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset. We evaluate our approach on two common SGG datasets: Visual Genome (VG)  and GQA . For VG we adopt the popular VG150 split, which consists of 150 object classes and 50 predicate classes in line with previous SGG work [ref]40 [ref]49    1 0  . For GQA we adopt the GQA200 split used by Dong et al. . For both datasets, depth maps are generated using the monocular depth estimator of Yin et al. . Evaluation protocol. We evaluate our model on the most common SGG tasks [ref]40 [ref]49: (1) Predicate Classification (PredCls) predicts the relationships for all object pairs by using both the ground-truth bounding boxes and classes; (2) Scene Graph Classification (SGCls) predicts both the object classes and their pairwise relationships by using ground-truth bounding boxes; (3) Scene Graph Detection (SGDet) detects, classifies, and predicts the pairwise relationships for all the objects in an image. Evaluation metrics. Following previous work  , we use Recall@k (R@k) and mean Recall@k (mR@k) as our evaluation metrics. We also report the Average of recall and mean recall (A@k) to show the combined performance improvement of R@k and mR@k. The A@k metric is relevant because previous models with improved mR@k have lower R@k and vice-versa (cf. Fig. 2(b)). Implementation details. We implement VETO and MEET in PyTorch on Nvidia A100 GPUs. Following prior work 0 , we adopt a ResNeXt-101-FPN 8 backbone and a Faster R-CNN  object detector. The parameters of backbone and detector are kept frozen. VETO contains 6 relation encoder layers with 6 attention heads for each MSA  component, uses embeddings of size 576, a patch size of 2, and a pooled entity resolution of 8 for entity patch generation. For VETO + Rwt, we use the importance weighting of .\nWe train our model using the Adam optimizer , batch size 121212, and an initial learning rate of 1.2×10−31.2E-31.2\\text{\\times}{10}^{-3}. We apply a linear learning rate warmup over the first 333K iterations and train for 125125125K iterations using a learning rate decay with maximum decay step 333 and patience 222.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: on two common SGG datasets: Visual Genome (VG)  and GQA . For VG we adopt the popular VG150 split, which consists of 150 object classes and 50 predicate classes in line with previous SGG work [ref]40 [ref]49    1 0  .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
