      "content": "Paper Title: Class-Level Logit Perturbation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets and competing methods. In comparison with the conference version of the paper, we supplement the experiments with real-world data sets. In the synthetic data set experiment, the long-tail versions of CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 compiled by Cui et al.  are used and called CIFAR10-LT and CIFAR100-LT, respectively, The training and testing configurations used in [ref]17 are followed. In the real-world data set experiment, large-scale data sets iNaturalist 2017 (iNat2017) and iNaturalist 2018 (iNat2018)[ref]42 with extremely imbalanced class distributions are used. iNat2017 includes 579,184\ntraining images in 5,089 classes with an imbalance factor\nof 3919/9, while iNat2018 is composed of\n435,713 images from 8,142 classes with an imbalance factor of 1000/2. Several classical and state-of-the-art robust loss functions and semantic data augmentation methods are compared: Class-balanced CE loss , Class-balanced fine-tuning , Meta-weight net , Focal loss , Class-balanced focal loss , LDAM , LDAM-DAR , ISDA, and LA. In the synthetic data set experiment, Menon et al. [ref]17 released the training data when the imbalance ratio (i.e., π1/π100subscript𝜋1subscript𝜋100\\pi_{1}/\\pi_{100}) is 100:1; hence, their data and reported results for the above competing methods are directly presented. When the ratio is 10:1, the results of ISDA+Dropout and LA are obtained by running their released codes. The results of the rest methods are from the study conducted by Li et al. . The hyper-parameter λ𝜆\\lambda in LA is searched in {0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5} according to the suggestion in  [ref]17. Similar to the experiments in [ref]17, ResNet-32 [ref]40 is used as the base network. The results of ISDA, LA, and LPL are the average of five repeated runs. In the real-world data set experiment, the results\nof the above competing methods reported in [ref]17 are directly presented. The results of LA on iNat2018 are from the original paper [ref]17. The other results, such as ISDA+dropout and LA on iNat2017, are obtained by running their released codes. Likewise, the hyper-parameter λ𝜆\\lambda in LA is searched in {0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5}. Similar to the experiments in , ResNet-50 [ref]40 is used as the base network. All results are the average of five repeated runs. Our methods have two variants: LPL (varied threshold + fixed bound) and LPL (varied threshold + varied bound). The threshold τ𝜏\\tau is searched in {0.4C𝐶C, 0.5C𝐶C, 0.6C𝐶C}. In the fixed bound version, the value of Δ​εΔ𝜀\\Delta\\varepsilon is set to 0, and ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is searched in {1.5, 2.5, 5}. In the varied bound version, the value of ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is set to 0, and Δ​εΔ𝜀\\Delta\\varepsilon is searched in {1.0, 2.0, 3.0}.\nOnly one meta-based method, Meta-weight net, is involved, because we mainly aim to compare methods that only modify the training loss. In addition, meta-based methods require an auxiliary high-quality validation set . Other methods, such as BBN , which focus on the new network structure are also not included in the comparisons. Results. The Top-1 error is also used. Table III shows the results of all the methods on the CIFAR100-LT data. On the ratios 100:1 and 10:1, LPL (varied τ𝜏\\tau + varied ϵcsubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑐\\epsilon_{c}) yields the lowest Top-1 errors. It exceeds the best competing method LA by 0.36% and 2.63% on the ratios 100:1 and 10:1, respectively. Table IV shows the results of all the methods on the CIFAR10-LT data. LPL (varied τ𝜏\\tau + varied ϵcsubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑐\\epsilon_{c}) still obtains the lowest Top-1 errors on both ratios. Table VI shows the results of all the methods on the iNat2017 and iNat2018. For real-world long-tail datasets, it still exceeds LA 0.89% and 0.97%, respectively. On all the comparisons, the semantic augmentation method ISDA obtains poor results. On CIFAR100-LT, ISDA achieves the worst performances on both ratios. This result is expected because ISDA aims to positively augment all categories equally and does not favor tail categories, which may lead to tail categories suffering from this positive augmentation. Nevertheless, ISDA has a better performance on CIFAR10-LT than on CIFAR100-LT. In Fig. 1 (b), the loss increments of tail categories are larger than those of the head ones. That is, larger augmentations are exerted on tail categories. We listed the Top-1 errors of LA and LPL (varied τ𝜏\\tau + varied ϵcsubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑐\\epsilon_{c}) on Table VII to better present the comparison. When the ratio is smaller, the improvements (error reductions) are relatively larger. This result is reasonable because when the ratio becomes small, the effectiveness of LA will be subsequently weakened. When the imbalance ratio is one, indicating that there is no imbalance, LA will lose effect; however, our LPL can still augment the training data effectively.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: set experiment, the long-tail versions of CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 compiled by Cui et al.  are used and called CIFAR10-LT and CIFAR100-LT, respectively, The training and testing configurations used in [ref]17 are followed.
