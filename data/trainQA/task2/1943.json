      "content": "Paper Title: Pose-driven Attention-guided Image Generation for Person Re-Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPerson re-ID is inhibited by variation in poses across camera networks. The same individual can appear to be a different person when they are captured with a different pose. This affects the appearance and hence the identity of a person which makes re-ID a challenging task. Many previous studies have sought to address the impact of pose variation on re-ID performance.       introduced hand-crafted methods such as estimating the body orientation using a histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) detector; or using front, profile and back pose types to extract features following the pose variation. Recently, the adverse effects of a person’s pose changes on deep learning based person re-ID models has been recognised and researchers have sought to address this.  first divides the human body into six body parts and fourteen body joints. Features are then extracted from the six local body parts. The global and local body part features are concatenated to get the final representation which is used for re-ID. The same idea was also applied in  where fourteen body joints are detected from the whole body which are then assigned to seven body sub regions such as the head-shoulder, upper body, lower body, two arms, and two leg regions. At the feature fusion stage, all the features extracted from the seven body parts are combined to get a final feature vector. In [ref]9, human body parts are also detected to compute representations over\nthe body parts, the calculated similarities are then combined. [ref]9 argue that their approach is more robust to human pose changes as they perform human body part partition. More recent re-ID works 0 1 2 3 4 adopted generative adversarial networks to generate new images with various poses. Both 1 and 2 adopted the method proposed in Cao et al. 2 to generate the pose skeletons from the MARS dataset. The work in 2 is inspired by the conditional GAN 6. The generated samples with pose variations are fed into the re-ID network along-with the real images and a guider sub-network is used with the triplet loss to force intra-class features to lie close to each other. In triplet selection, the positive images are chosen from the real images while the negative images are taken from the generated samples to enhance diversity in the training data. 1 also adopted a conditional GAN based network to generate images from the pose skeleton for cross-view person re-ID. PSE 4 takes the front, back and side as a person’s coarse pose and body joint locations as a set of fine pose constraints. To train the CNN with various pose representations, body joint maps are used as inputs along with the original images. However, the above methods require auxiliary pose information in the inference\nstage. Ge et al. 0 proposed FD-GAN where pose information is no longer required. FD-GAN 0 is based on the Siamese architecture and includes two image encoder for two input images, two generators, an identity discriminator to classify whether the input image is real or fake conditioned on the input identity, and a pose discriminator to classify whether the input image is real or fake conditioned on the target pose. A novel pose loss is also proposed to minimise the difference between\nthe generated images from the two branches. In contrast to these approaches, we propose an attention-guided pose transfer network that sequentially learns and transfers the pose to capture the local details of a person while ensuring the preservation of fine image details and the structure of the target pose with the help of an appearance discriminator and pose discriminators respectively. We also ensure to preserve the identity of a person during pose translation using the semantic-consistency loss. Furthermore, for re-ID, we adopted the quartet loss 8 to minimise the intra-class distance more than the inter-class distance in feature space.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: head-shoulder, upper body, lower body, two arms, and two leg regions.
