      "content": "Paper Title: A Surrogate Objective Framework for Prediction+Optimization with Soft Constraints\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMathematical optimization (a.k.a. mathematical programming), e.g., linear and quadratic programming, has been widely applied in decision-making processes, such as resource scheduling , goods production planning [ref]2, portfolio optimization , and power scheduling . In practice, problem parameters (e.g., goods demands, and equity returns) are often contextual and predicted by models with observed features (e.g., history time series). With the popularity of machine learning techniques and increasing available data, prediction+optimization has become a normal paradigm . Prediction becomes critical to the performance of the full prediction+optimization workflow since modern optimization solvers (e.g., Gurobi  and CPLEX ) can already efficiently find optimal solutions for most large scale optimization problems. Traditionally, prediction is treated separately as a general supervised learning problem and learned through minimizing a generic loss function (e.g., mean squared error for regression). However, studies have shown that minimization of the fitting errors does not necessarily lead to better final decision performance [ref]8  0 1. Recently, a lot of efforts on using optimization objective to guide the learning of prediction models have been made, which are decision-focused when training prediction models instead of using traditional prediction metrics, e.g. mean squared error losses. For linear objectives, the ‚ÄòSmart Predict then Optimize‚Äô (0) proposes the SPO+ loss function to measure the prediction errors against optimization objectives, while direct optimization (2) updates the prediction model‚Äôs parameters by perturbation. For quadratic objectives, OptNet 3 4 implements the optimization as an implicit layer whose gradients can be computed by differentiating the KKT conditions and then back propagates to prediction neural network. CVXPY 5 uses similar technologies with OptNet but extends to more general cases of convex optimization. However, all the above state-of-the-art approaches do not contain the soft constraints in their objectives. In this paper, We consider linear ‚Äòsoft-constraints‚Äô, a penalty in the form of max‚Å°(z,0)ùëß0\\max(z,0), where z=C‚Äãx‚àídùëßùê∂ùë•ùëëz=Cx-d is a projection of decision variable x‚àà‚Ñùnùë•superscript‚Ñùùëõx\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n} and context variables C‚àà‚Ñùm√ón,d‚àà‚Ñùmformulae-sequenceùê∂superscript‚Ñùùëöùëõùëësuperscript‚ÑùùëöC\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n},d\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}. Such soft constraints are often required in practice: for example, they could be the waste of provisioned resources over demands or the extra tax paid when violating regulatory rules. Unfortunately, the max‚Å°(‚ãÖ,0)‚ãÖ0\\max(\\cdot,0) operator is not differentiable and thus cannot be directly handled by these existing approaches. To differentiate soft constraints is a primary motivation of this paper. In this paper, we derive a surrogate objective framework for a broad set of real-world linear and quadratic programming problems with linear soft constraints and implement decision-focused differentiable predictions, with the assumption of non-negativity of hard constraint parameters. The framework consists of three steps: 1) rewriting all hard constraints into piece-wise linear soft constraints with a bounded penalty multiplier; 2) using a differentiable element-wise surrogate to substitute the piece-wise objective, and solving the original function numerically to decide which segment the optimal point is on; 3) analytically solving the local surrogate and obtaining the gradient; the gradient is identical to that of the piecewise surrogate since the surrogate is convex/concave such that the optimal point is unique. Our main contributions are summarized as follows. First, we propose a differentiable surrogate objective function that incorporates both soft and hard constraints. As the foundation of our methodology, in Section 3, we prove that, with reasonable assumptions generally satisfied in the real world, for linear and semi-definite negative quadratic programming problems, the constraints can be transformed into soft constraints; then we propose an analytically differentiable surrogate function for the soft constraints max‚Å°(‚ãÖ,0)‚ãÖ0\\max(\\cdot,0). Second, we present the derived analytical and closed-form solutions for three representative optimization problems extended with soft constraints in Section 4 ‚Äì linear programming with soft constraints, quadratic programming with soft constraints, and asymmetric soft constraint minimization. Unlike KKT-based differentiation methods, our method makes the calculation of gradients straightforward for predicting context parameters in any part of the problem. Finally, we apply with theoretical derivations and evaluate our approach in three scenarios, including synthetic linear programming, portfolio optimization, and resource provisioning in Section 4, empirically demonstrate that our method outperforms two-stage and other predict+optimization approaches.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: optimization (a.k.a. mathematical programming), e.g., linear and quadratic programming, has been widely applied in decision-making processes, such as resource scheduling , goods production planning [ref]2, portfolio optimization , and power scheduling .
