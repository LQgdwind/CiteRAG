      "content": "Paper Title: CLIP-S4: Language-Guided Self-Supervised Semantic Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnsupervised Semantic Segmentation. There are two groups of recent unsupervised semantic segmentation methods. One group of methods learns to generate consistent pixel representations or predictions between different augmentation of images with the guidance of mutual information¬† , clusters¬†, contours¬† , hierarchical groups¬† , and saliency masks¬†[ref]40. The other group of methods extracts dense features from pre-trained models based on saliency maps¬†, augmentations¬†, spectral decomposition¬†, and feature correspondences¬†. While these methods can generate pixel embeddings with semantically meaningful clusters, annotations are needed to assign class labels to the clusters (e.g., kùëòk-nearest neighbor search¬† and Hungarian algorithm¬†[ref]40). Our work combines pixel-segment self-supervision with pre-trained vision-language models to enable semantic segmentation without any human annotations. Language-Driven Semantic Segmentation. Recently, vision-language models (e.g., CLIP¬†) trained on large-scale image-text datasets have shown great potential on various downstream tasks such as image synthesis¬† , out-of-distribution detection¬†, and object detection¬†. To extend vision-language models for semantic segmentation, one active research, language-driven semantic segmentation, aims to segment images with arbitrary unknown classes defined by texts during testing time¬†[ref]25  [ref]46 . Some methods¬†[ref]25  use pixel-wise annotations to train language-guided semantic segmentation models. Other methods¬†[ref]46  perform large-scale pre-training on image-text pairs specifically for semantic segmentation. By contrast, we directly use vision-language models that are pre-trained for classification tasks. Along this line of research, a few approaches have been proposed¬†  . The most relevant approach to our method is MaskCLIP¬†, which extends the embeddings generated by pre-trained vision-language models from image to pixel level, but these embeddings are often coarse and noisy. To address this issue, MaskCLIP+¬† fine-tunes the pixel embeddings by the pseudo-labels of a specific set of classes on top of MaskCLIP. However, it needs unknown class names during training, which may not be possible in real-world cases. Compared with¬†, our method can recognize unknown classes without knowing any unknown class information during training time, and also learns fine-grained and sharper pixel embeddings with self-supervision.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: consistent pixel representations or predictions between different augmentation of images with the guidance of mutual information¬† , clusters¬†, contours¬† , hierarchical groups¬† , and saliency masks¬†[ref]40.
