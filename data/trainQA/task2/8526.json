      "content": "Paper Title: No-Regret Learning in Harmonic Games: Extrapolation in the Face of Conflicting Interests\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo mitigate this undesirable, divergent behavior of (FTRL), a standard approach in the literature is the inclusion of a forward-looking, “extrapolation step”. Instead of updating the algorithm’s “base state” xnsubscript𝑥𝑛x_{n} directly, players first move to an interim “leading state” xn+1/2subscript𝑥𝑛12x_{n+1/2} using payoff information from xnsubscript𝑥𝑛x_{n} (this is the extrapolation step);\nsubsequently, players update xnsubscript𝑥𝑛x_{n} using payoff information from the leading state xn+1/2subscript𝑥𝑛12x_{n+1/2}, and the process repeats.\nIn this way, players attempt to anticipate their payoff landscape and, in so doing, to take a more informed update step at each iteration. The seed of this idea goes back to Korpelevich 2 and Popov  in the context of solving monotone variational inequality problems, and it has since percolated to a wide array of “extra-gradient” or “optimistic” methods, such as the mirror-prox algorithm of Nemirovski , the dual extrapolation variant of Nesterov , the optimistic mirror descent algorithm of Chiang et al.  and Rakhlin & Sridharan , and many others.\nGiven the different operational envelope of each of these methods,\nwe consider below an integrated algorithmic template, which we call extrapolated  (FTRL+), and which is sufficiently flexible to account for a broad range of these schemes. Formally, the proposed algorithmic blueprint unfolds in two phases as follows: In the above,\nηi>0subscript𝜂𝑖0\\eta_{i}>0 is the learning rate of player i𝑖i,\nxnsubscript𝑥𝑛x_{n} and xn+1/2subscript𝑥𝑛12x_{n+1/2} denote respectively the method’s base and leading states at stage n=1,2,…𝑛12…n=1,2,\\dotsc,\nand\nv^i,nsubscript^𝑣𝑖𝑛\\hat{v}_{i,n} and v^i,n+1/2subscript^𝑣𝑖𝑛12\\hat{v}_{i,n+1/2} are sequences of “black-box” payoff models at xnsubscript𝑥𝑛x_{n} and xn+1/2subscript𝑥𝑛12x_{n+1/2} respectively. Specifically, following Azizian et al. , we will assume throughout that In this way, depending on the values of aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i} and bisubscript𝑏𝑖b_{i}, we obtain the following prototypical regularized learning methods as special cases of ( ‣ 4.2): FTRL:\nif ai=bi=0subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑏𝑖0a_{i}=b_{i}=0 for all i∈𝒩𝑖𝒩i\\in\\mathcal{N}, players essentially forego any look-ahead efforts, so we get In turn, this gives xn+1/2=xnsubscript𝑥𝑛12subscript𝑥𝑛x_{n+1/2}=x_{n}, i.e., ( ‣ 4.2) regresses to (FTRL). \\AclExtraFTRL:\nif ai=1subscript𝑎𝑖1a_{i}=1 and bi=0subscript𝑏𝑖0b_{i}=0 for all i∈𝒩𝑖𝒩i\\in\\mathcal{N}, we have i.e., players use payoff information from their current state to generate the leading state xn+1/2subscript𝑥𝑛12x_{n+1/2}.\nThis update structure requires two payoff queries per iteration and its origins can be traced back to the work of Korpelevich 2.\nSpecifically, depending on the choice of hisubscriptℎ𝑖h_{i}, it is essentially equivalent to the mirror-prox  and dual extrapolation  algorithms, it contains as a special case the forward-looking algorithm of [ref]42 , etc. \\AclOptFTRL:\nif ai=0subscript𝑎𝑖0a_{i}=0 and bi=1subscript𝑏𝑖1b_{i}=1 for all i∈𝒩𝑖𝒩i\\in\\mathcal{N}, we have i.e., players reuse the latest available payoff information instead of making a fresh query at xnsubscript𝑥𝑛x_{n} (so the algorithm only requires one payoff query per iteration).\nIn this way, ( ‣ 4.2) recovers the optimistic algorithms of    , the OMW update scheme of   when Q=Λ𝑄ΛQ=\\operatorname{\\Lambda}, etc. Clearly, the list above is not exhaustive:\nmany other configurations are possible, e.g., with different players using different parameter settings for aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i} and bisubscript𝑏𝑖b_{i}, depending on the information they have at hand and any other individual considerations.\nTo avoid needlessly complicating the analysis, our only standing assumption will be that\nai+bi>0subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑏𝑖0a_{i}+b_{i}>0 for all i∈𝒩𝑖𝒩i\\in\\mathcal{N} (since, otherwise, the benefits of the extrapolation step would vanish).\nIn particular, by rescaling the players’ learning rates if needed, we will\nnormalize aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i} and bisubscript𝑏𝑖b_{i} to ai+bi=1subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑏𝑖1a_{i}+b_{i}=1,\nleading to the convex model\n for some arbitrarily chosen ensemble of player-specific extrapolation coefficients λi∈[ref]0 subscript𝜆𝑖01\\lambda_{i}\\in[ref]0 , i∈𝒩𝑖𝒩i\\in\\mathcal{N}. To simplify the presentation of our results, we will assume throughout the rest of our paper that ( ‣ 4.2) is initialized with y1=y1/2=0subscript𝑦1subscript𝑦120y_{1}=y_{1/2}=0.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: depending on the choice of hisubscriptℎ𝑖h_{i}, it is essentially equivalent to the mirror-prox  and dual extrapolation  algorithms, it contains as a special case the forward-looking algorithm of [ref]42 , etc. \\AclOptFTRL:\nif ai=0subscript𝑎𝑖0a_{i}=0 and bi=1subscript𝑏𝑖1b_{i}=1 for all i∈𝒩𝑖𝒩i\\in\\mathcal{N}, we have i.e., players reuse the latest available payoff information instead of making\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
