      "content": "Paper Title: Transformer-based Self-supervised Multimodal Representation Learning for Wearable Emotion Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEmotions are sets of complex physiological, cognitive and behavioral responses that are triggered by internal or external stimuli.\nEmotion recognition is an emerging field of research which attempts to empower computers with the ability to infer human emotions.\nIn recent years, it has been employed in several practical scenarios such as automated driver assistance , health care , social communication , etc, the majority of which are based on physical or physiological indicators of the human body.\nIn contrast to physical signals such as facial expressions and speech , physiological responses under certain emotional states are involuntary and therefore provide more objective decisions for identification systems .\nThe physiological modalities primarily consist of Electroencephalography (EEG) signals and a series of peripheral signals.\nHowever, the acquisition of EEG data is challenging for implementation in real-life scenarios. With the advance of non-invasive technologies, emotion recognition methods based on multiple peripheral signals captured by smartphones/wearable watches have attracted some attention.\nMost recent researches focus on deep neural networks, which can automatically extract complex patterns from multimodal signals.\nHowever, given that most of them are trained in a supervised manner, it is challenging to obtain generalizable models using limited labeled data, especially in daily life, where standard protocols for obtaining accurate emotion labels are not yet well defined.\nBesides, each specific supervised task requires training the deep model from scratch and its knowledge transfer ability on other tasks is not satisfactory [ref]7. Self-supervised learning (SSL), as an emerging learning paradigm, eliminates the need for extensive manual labeling and has demonstrated comparable or even superior performance to supervised learning methods in areas of computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP). Several SSL-based efforts Â   0 have been done for emotion recognition using EEG signal, but they are not suitable for practical scenes.\nOnly one work 1 targeted low-frequency wearable peripheral signals, but they ignored the correlation between multimodal signals.\nIn this paper, we propose a self-supervised multimodal representation learning approach for wearable emotion recognition based on peripheral physiological signals. The first stage is model pre-training with the pretext objective of signal transformation classification, where a large amount of unlabeled multimodal data are automatically assigned labels through a series of transformations.\nConsidering the heterogeneity of multimodal signals, temporal convolution-based modality-specific encoders are first employed separately on the transformed unimodal data to extract low-level features, followed by a transformer-based shared encoder deployed to aggregate unimodal features, enabling the modeling of complementary and collaborative properties between multimodal signals.\nFinally, modality-specific signal transformation recognition is performed to learn effective multimodal representations for downstream tasks that are robust to perturbations in magnitude or temporal domains.\nThe second stage is supervised emotion recognition, where the SSL pre-trained encoder part is retained as a feature extractor to obtain generalized multimodal representations for classification. The overview of the proposed approach is illustrated in Fig. 1.\nTo validate the effectiveness of our method and the knowledge transferability across different datasets,\nwe pre-trained the proposed model on a large-scale unsupervised emotion dataset PRESAGE collected in unrestricted real-life scenarios and evaluated its performance on three public emotion recognition datasets. Overall, our contributions can be summarized as follows: We proposed a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) framework to learn generalized representations from a large number of unlabeled samples to cope with the overfitting problem on small-scale physiological data. We adopted an intermediate fusion strategy based on temporal convolution and transformer, capable of modeling both the heterogeneity and cross-modal correlation of physiological signals to effectively fuse multimodal data. We outperformed state-of-the-art supervised or self-supervised learning-based approaches in various emotion-related classification tasks involving mental stress, affective states, arousal, and valence. Moreover, our model was proven to be more accurate and stable on limited labeled data than fully-supervised models. In addition, multiple ablation studies have been performed to investigate the effectiveness of our method.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: emotion labels are not yet well defined.\nBesides, each specific supervised task requires training the deep model from scratch and its knowledge transfer ability on other tasks is not satisfactory [ref]7.
