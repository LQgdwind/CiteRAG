      "content": "Paper Title: Object-centric proto-symbolic behavioural reasoning from pixels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are two major challenges at the unsupervised learning with object-centric representations: working with complex naturalistic scene images¬†[ref]13 and the generation of meaningful physical actions (i.e., interacting through continuous control) derived from the reasoning process when the input is high-dimensional (i.e., image) and the environment is partially-observable. This work focus on the latter. We show that simple conditional reasoning problems, such as, ‚Äúif there is a heart move squares to the left, otherwise move squares to the right‚Äù ((A‚ÜíB)‚àß(¬¨A‚ÜíC)‚Üíùê¥ùêµ‚Üíùê¥ùê∂(A\\to B)\\land(\\neg A\\to C)) is already unsolvable for non-object-centric representations SOTA algorithms‚ÄîSee Sec. 4.\nAn underlying problem for both challenges is to achieve high performance in world state dynamic estimation (world model learning), but allowing adaptation and generalization. We designed the object-centric backbone architecture to incorporate adaptation, following the free energy principle theory of information brain processing¬†[ref]32 , where the brain estimates the world by continuously approximating its internal model, learn by experience, to the real world through approximate Bayesian computation. To implement it, we opted for an iterative variational inference approach inspired by the IODINE¬†[ref]10 architecture. Whilst iterative methods have shown less performance than amortized approaches (e.g., slot-attention architecture¬†), at least at perceptual tasks, it provides Bayesian filtering and smoothing, thus allowing better counterfactual reasoning. Finally, another relevant challenge, which is not addressed in this work, is to deal with complex non-linearities of physical contact, such as collisions. Physics-based simulation based approaches¬† and Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)¬† is showing the best results but they still provide the ground truth object masks or entail oversimplified segmentation in the visual input respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: There are two major challenges at the unsupervised learning with object-centric representations: working with complex naturalistic scene images¬†[ref]13 and the generation of meaningful physical actions (i.e., interacting through continuous control) derived from the reasoning process when the input is high-dimensional (i.e., image) and the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
