      "content": "Paper Title: Visualizing Quantum Circuit Probability estimating computational action for quantum program synthesis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuantum computing has entered a technological readiness level where quantum processor platforms, albeit limited, are becoming accessible for experimentation.\nThis rapid progress has encouraged researchers to study various real-world industrial/scientific applications¬† using quantum algorithms.\nThe logical formulations of these algorithms are then processed by a quantum computing stack¬† of system abstractions into low-level quantum circuits for a gate-based quantum computing device.\nThe so-called NISQ (noisy intermediate-scale quantum) era¬† [ref]4 characterizes the limitations of current quantum processors in coherence time, gate errors, and qubit connectivity.\nThis has led to explorations from the other end¬†, in devising design strategies and finding use cases for these limited computing power to achieve a computational advantage.\nTo better utilize these limited devices, it is imperative to understand the relations between quantum logic and physical resources.\nThis motivates the research presented in this article. Quantum computation lies at the intersection of quantum physics and computer science.\nIt has allowed a rich exchange of concepts between these two fields.\nSpecific to the interests of this research, (i) physical laws provide fundamental bounds to computation, while (ii) computation provides an information-theoretic explanation of many physical phenomena.\nThe former was first explored in the context of thermodynamic limits¬†, leading to the development of reversible computation¬† , and eventually to define the limits of quantum computation¬†[ref]9 0.\nEfforts of the latter come under the purview of digital physics.\nSome seminal contributions include cellular automaton¬†1 and constructor theory¬†2, informational axioms¬†3 4 of quantum mechanics, a principle of stationary action for computing¬†5 6, and tensor networks, among others.\nThe work presented in this research is foundational and would have applications for both directions of this synergy.\nOur focus is on an empirical demonstration of the consequences of existing theoretical ideas for quantum computing.\nSpecifically, we transport concepts from algorithmic information theory¬†7 (a sub-field of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence¬†8) to gate-based quantum computation¬†9. In this work, we consider an enumeration of the space of quantum circuits (as QASM codes).\nThis is a very small sample of the uncountable infinite quantum processes that can be defined on the Hilbert space of a given dimension.\nThe subset of processes is based on (i) the native gate set (of a quantum processor), (ii) the maximum circuit width (total number of qubits) and, (iii) the bounds on the circuit depth (based on the decoherence time).\nWe investigate how these circuits map a space of classical inputs to classical outputs (via Z-axis measurements).\nOur formalism assumes the QASM/circuits are encoded using a discrete universal gate set.\nThe space of quantum programs constructed in such a matter is enumerable and is thus formally countably infinite.\nHowever, in most practical implementations (with finite and circuit depth), the set of meaningful computations is finite.\nEven for universal gate sets with arbitrary rotation angles, a finite number of control signal configurations in practical quantum computer implementation effectively discretizes the set of native gates.\nWhile any arbitrary unitary can be decomposed to arbitrary precision given a universal gate set (e.g., {R‚Äãx‚Äã(Œ∏x),R‚Äãy‚Äã(Œ∏y),C‚ÄãX}ùëÖùë•subscriptùúÉùë•ùëÖùë¶subscriptùúÉùë¶ùê∂ùëã\\{Rx(\\theta_{x}),Ry(\\theta_{y}),CX\\}), given resource bounds (e.g., in lines of QASM codes before the system decoheres) the space of programs cannot map to any quantum process.\nThis limits us from exploring functional physical processes that can be efficiently described in terms of quantum gates to be simulated on a quantum computer. Since the first quantum algorithms were formulated in the 1990s, the discovery of new algorithms¬†0 has progressed steadily. However, quantum algorithm design involves quantum mechanical phenomena (e.g., superposition, entanglement), which is counter-intuitive to human experience.\nThus, reasoning in terms of mathematical formalism has been a barrier to entry to develop more advanced quantum logic and is thus a bottleneck for broader adoption of quantum accelerated computing.\nThere have been some proposals to remedy these issues via genetic programming¬†1 and circuit synthesis¬†2.\nIn this work, we carry forward this research direction via the principled approach¬†3 of algorithmic information theory.\nA quantum program synthesis framework would require understanding the space of quantum programs and their associated resources, to implement the program search/induction.\nAs discussed in this article, the landscape of resource-bounded quantum circuits and their corresponding classical information processing capability, lay the groundwork towards this. The rest of the article is organized as follows.\nIn ¬ß¬†2, we describe how states are represented as symbols and transformations over these symbols, and how this affects their statistical and algorithmic complexities.\n¬ß¬†3 discusses the subtleties of forming Boolean and quantum circuits from gate sets.\nIn ¬ß¬†4, we present our implementation of the enumeration of state complexities using various gate sets.\nThe results are visualized and analyzed.\n¬ß¬†5 concludes the article with a discussion of various applications of this research.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: processed by a quantum computing stack¬† of system abstractions into low-level quantum circuits for a gate-based quantum computing device.\nThe so-called NISQ (noisy intermediate-scale quantum) era¬† [ref]4 characterizes the limitations of current quantum processors in coherence time, gate errors, and qubit connectivity.\nThis has led to explorations from the other end¬†, in devising design\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
