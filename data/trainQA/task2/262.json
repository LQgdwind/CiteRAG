      "content": "Paper Title: Bodies at Rest: 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation from a Pressure Image using Synthetic Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\ndata: (R)eal, (S)ynth modality: (P)ressure, (D)epth (T)thermal, IRS - infrared selective 3D: (Y)es, (N)o human representation: (S)keleson, (M)esh postures # joints # identities # images Human pose estimation.\nThere is long history of human pose estimation from camera images      and the more recent use of CNNs  . The field has been moving rapidly with the estimation of 3D skeleton models  , and human pose and shape estimation as a 3D mesh  9  using human body models such as SCAPE  and SMPL . These latter methods enforce physical constraints to provide kinematically feasible pose estimates, some via optimization  and others using learned embedded kinematics models 4 9 . Our approach builds on these works both directly through the use of available neural networks (e.g, SMPL embedding) and conceptually. While pressure image formation differs from conventional cameras, the images are visually interpretable and methods developed in the vision community are well suited to pressure imagery  9 . PressureNet’s model of pressure image generation relates to recent work on physical contact between people and objects  5 6. It also relates to approaches that fine-tune estimates based on spatial differences between maps at distinct stages of estimation   0 . Human pose at rest.\nHuman pose estimation has tended to focus on active poses. Poses in bed have attracted special attention due to their relevance to healthcare. Table 1 provides an overview of work on the estimation of human pose for people in bed. These efforts have used a variety of sensors including RGB cameras 1, infrared lighting and cameras for darkened rooms , depth cameras to estimate pose underneath a blanket profile , thermal cameras to see through a blanket [ref]33, and pressure mats underneath a person 0 4 5 9 4 . Researchers have investigated posture classification for people in bed 8 9 2. There has been a lack of consensus on body poses to consider, as illustrated by Table 1. Some works focus on task-related poses, such as eating , and stretching 0. Poses can increase ambiguity for particular modalities, such as lack of contact on a pressure mat (e.g. knee in the air) 4 3 or overlapping body parts facing a thermal camera [ref]33. Large datasets would be valuable for deep learning and evaluation. While some bed pose work has used thousands of images they have either had few participants 1 or poses highly concentrated in some areas due to many frames being captured when there is little motion  0 4. An exception is recent work by Liu et al. [ref]33, which has 109 participants. Generating data in simulation.\nApproaches for generating synthetic data that model humans in the context of deep learning include physics-based simulators such as DART  and PyBullet 7 and position-based dynamics simulators such as PhysX 6 and FleX . Some have used these tools to simulate deformable objects like cloth 3 6. For vision, creating synthetic depth images is relatively straightforward (e.g. ) while RGB image synthesis relies on more complex graphics approaches 2 6 8. Some past works have simulated pressure sensors. One approach is to model the array as a deformable volume that penetrates the sensed object, where force is a function of distance penetrated 7. Others model pressure sensing skin as a mass-spring-damper array 0 7; the former considers separate layers for the skin and the sensor, a key attribute of pressure arrays covering deformable objects.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: variety of sensors including RGB cameras 1, infrared lighting and cameras for darkened rooms , depth cameras to estimate pose underneath a blanket profile , thermal cameras to see through a blanket [ref]33, and pressure mats underneath a person 0 4 5 9 4 .
