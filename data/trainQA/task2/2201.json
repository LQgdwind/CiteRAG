      "content": "Paper Title: Score-Based Explanations in Data Management and Machine Learning: An Answer-Set Programming Approach to Counterfactual Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Shapley value was proposed in game theory by Lloyd Shapley in 1953\n, to quantify the contribution of a player to a coalition game where players share a wealth function.333The original paper and related ones on the\nShapley value can be found in the book edited by Alvin Roth\n[ref]43. Shapley and Roth shared the Nobel Prize in Economic\nSciences 2012. It has been applied in many disciplines. In particular, it has been investigated in computer science under\nalgorithmic game theory [ref]40, and it has been applied to many and\ndifferent computational problems. The\ncomputation of the Shapley value is, in general, intractable. In many\nscenarios where it is applied its computation turns out to be\n#​P#𝑃\\#{\\it P}-hard  .  Here, the class #​P#𝑃\\#{\\it P} contains the problems of counting the solutions for problems in 𝑁𝑃𝑁𝑃{\\it NP}. A typical problem in the class, actually, hard for the class, is #​𝑆𝐴𝑇#𝑆𝐴𝑇\\#{\\it SAT}, about counting the number of satisfying assignments for a propositional formula. Clearly, this problem cannot be easier than 𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑆𝐴𝑇{\\it SAT}, because a solution for #​𝑆𝐴𝑇#𝑆𝐴𝑇\\#{\\it SAT} immediately gives a solution for 𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑆𝐴𝑇{\\it SAT} . In particular, the Shapley value has been used in knowledge\nrepresentation, to measure the degree of inconsistency of a\npropositional knowledge base ; in machine learning to provide explanations for the outcomes of\nclassification models on the basis of numerical scores assigned to the participating feature values  (c.f. Section 13); and in data management to\nmeasure the contribution of a tuple to a query answer [ref]30, which we briefly review in this section. Consider a set of players D𝐷{D}, and a\ngame function, 𝒢:𝒫​(D)→ℝ:𝒢→𝒫𝐷ℝ\\mathcal{G}:\\mathcal{P}(D)\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}, where 𝒫​(D)𝒫𝐷\\mathcal{P}(D) the power set of D𝐷D.  The Shapley value of player p𝑝{p} in D𝐷{D} es defined by: Notice that here, |S|!​(|D|−|S|−1)!𝑆𝐷𝑆1{|S|!(|D|-|S|-1)!} is the number of permutations of\nD𝐷{D} with all players in S𝑆{S} coming first, then p𝑝{p}, and then all the others. That is, this quantity\nis the expected contribution of player p𝑝p under all possible additions of p𝑝p to a partial random sequence of players followed by a random sequence of the rests of the players. Notice the counterfactual flavor, in that there is a comparison between what happens having p𝑝p vs. not having it. The Shapley value is the only function that satisfies certain natural properties in relation to games. So, it is a\nresult of a categorical set of axioms or conditions [ref]43. Back to query answering in databases,  the players are tuples in the database D𝐷{D}. We also have a\nBoolean query  𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q}, which becomes a game function, as follows:  For  S⊆D𝑆𝐷{S\\subseteq D}, With these elements we can define the Shapley value of a database tuple τ𝜏\\tau: If the query is monotone, i.e. its set of answers never shrinks when new tuples are added to the database, which is the case of conjunctive queries (CQs), among others, the difference 𝒬​(S∪{τ})−𝒬​(S)𝒬𝑆𝜏𝒬𝑆\\mathcal{Q}(S\\cup\\{{\\tau}\\})-\\mathcal{Q}(S) is always 111 or 00, and the average in the definition\nof the Shapley value returns a value between 00 and 111.  This value quantifies the contribution of tuple  τ𝜏{\\tau}  to the query result. It was introduced and investigated in [ref]30,\nfor BCQs and some aggregate queries defined over CQs. We report on some of the findings in the rest of this section. The analysis has been extended to queries with negated atoms in CQs . A main result obtained in [ref]30 is about the complexity of computing this Shapley score. The following\nDichotomy Theorem holds:  For 𝒬𝒬{\\mathcal{Q}} a BCQ without self-joins, if  𝒬𝒬{\\mathcal{Q}}  is hierarchical, then 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑦​(D,𝒬,τ)𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑦𝐷𝒬𝜏{{\\it Shapley}(D,\\mathcal{Q},\\tau)} can be computed in polynomial-time\n(in the size of D𝐷D); otherwise, the problem is  #​P#𝑃{\\it\\#P}-complete. Here, 𝒬𝒬{\\mathcal{Q}}  is hierarchical if for every two existential variables x𝑥{x} and y𝑦{y}, it holds:  (a)\n𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠​(x)⊆𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠​(y)𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠𝑥𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠𝑦{\\it Atoms}(x)\\subseteq{\\it Atoms}(y),  or\n𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠​(y)⊆𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠​(x)𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠𝑦𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠𝑥{\\it Atoms}(y)\\subseteq{\\it Atoms}(x),  or\n𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠​(x)∩𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠​(y)=∅𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠𝑥𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠𝑦{\\it Atoms}(x)\\cap{\\it Atoms}(y)=\\emptyset.\n For example, 𝒬:∃x​∃y​∃z​(R​(x,y)∧S​(x,z)):𝒬𝑥𝑦𝑧𝑅𝑥𝑦𝑆𝑥𝑧{\\mathcal{Q}:\\ \\exists x\\exists y\\exists z(R(x,y)\\wedge S(x,z))}, for which  𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠​(x)𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠𝑥{\\it Atoms}(x) ={R(x,y),=\\{R(x,y), S(x,z)}\\ S(x,z)\\},  𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠​(y)={R​(x,y)}𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠𝑦𝑅𝑥𝑦{\\it Atoms}(y)=\\{R(x,y)\\},  𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠​(z)={S​(x,z)}𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠𝑧𝑆𝑥𝑧{\\it Atoms}(z)=\\{S(x,z)\\}, is\nhierarchical.  However,  𝒬𝑛ℎ:∃x​∃y​(R​(x)∧S​(x,y)∧T​(y)):superscript𝒬𝑛ℎ𝑥𝑦𝑅𝑥𝑆𝑥𝑦𝑇𝑦{\\mathcal{Q}^{{\\it nh}}:\\ \\exists x\\exists y({R(x)\\wedge S(x,y)\\wedge T(y)})}, for which  𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠​(x)={R​(x),S​(x,y)}𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠𝑥𝑅𝑥𝑆𝑥𝑦{\\it Atoms}(x)=\\{R(x),\\ S(x,y)\\},  𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠​(y)={S​(x,y),T​(y)}𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠𝑦𝑆𝑥𝑦𝑇𝑦{\\it Atoms}(y)=\\{S(x,y),T(y)\\}, is not hierarchical. These are the same criteria for (in)tractability that apply to evaluation of BCQs over probabilistic databases . However, the same proofs do not apply, at least not straightforwardly.\nThe intractability result uses query 𝒬𝑛ℎsuperscript𝒬𝑛ℎ{\\mathcal{Q}^{{\\it nh}}}  above, and a\nreduction from counting independent sets in a bipartite graph. The dichotomy results can be extended to summation over CQs, with the same conditions and cases. This is because the\nShapley value, as an expectation, is linear.  Hardness extends to aggregates max, min, and avg over non-hierarchical queries. For the hard cases, there is, as established in [ref]30, an approximation result:  For every fixed BCQ 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} (or summation over a CQ), there is a multiplicative fully-polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) , A𝐴A, with A related and popular score, in coalition games and other areas, is the Bahnzhaf Power Index, which is similar to the Shapley value, but the order of players is ignored, by considering subsets of players rather than permutations thereof. It is defined by: The Bahnzhaf-index is also difficult to compute; provably #P-hard in general. The results in [ref]30 carry over to this index when applied to query answering.\n In [ref]30 it was proved that the causal-effect score of Section 3.2 coincides with the Banzhaf-index, which gives to the former an additional justification.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: the contribution of a player to a coalition game where players share a wealth function.333The original paper and related ones on the\nShapley value can be found in the book edited by Alvin Roth\n[ref]43.
