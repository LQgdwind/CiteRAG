      "content": "Paper Title: DeHIN: A Decentralized Framework for Embedding Large-scale Heterogeneous Information Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany real-world interactions recorded via digital medium take the form of heterogeneous information networks (HINs). HINs typically consist of multiple types of nodes connected by a variety of links/relationships. Due to the flexibility and diversity of relationships provided by HINs, heterogeneous network embedding (HNE) is widely adopted to perform several downstream tasks such as item recommendation, link prediction, and node classification. To effectively execute such tasks on an HIN, low-dimensional vector representations (i.e., embeddings) for each node are learned, such that the representations effectively preserve both feature and neighborhood information for each node belonging to that HIN. Advancing the accuracy of downstream tasks for HINs, a large number of centralized HNE approaches have been developed , which learn the low-dimensional representation of the entire network on a single machine. However, in the case of large-scale HINs, these centralized frameworks at large neglect model scalability and efficiency. The centralized HNE paradigm requires the entire network data to be present and all model parameters to be stored and updated on one machine throughout the training phase. Though this assumption suits small networks, it makes centralized HNE models unable to scale to large networks due to multiple constraints from memory, computational cost, and accuracy perspectives. For instance, the graph transformer network (GTN) [ref]50 needs to take the networkâ€™s full adjacency matrix as its input, while a contemporary network can contain up to billions of nodes and edges (e.g. the WDC e-commerce dataset ), making it unable to handle large-scale networks efficiently. Hence, attempts on improving the scalability of centralized HNE methods are made, such as the mini-batch implementation  of graph convolutional network (GCN) , subgraph sampling , and network coarsening . However, the huge time consumption is unavoidable with sampled mini-batches/subgraphs as they need to be iterated over the whole network for model training  , and network coarsening  incurs accuracy loss as the condensed network fails to fully preserve the subtle characteristics of merged nodes/edges. Moreover, most of them   are designed purely for homogeneous networks, thus being inapplicable to HNE. Another natural solution to embedding large-scale HINs is a decentralized HNE paradigm, that exploits model parallelism [ref]32 or data parallelism . In the case of model parallelism, the communication overhead renders it highly inefficient as billions of model parameters need to be shared and synchronized at each iteration to keep all learned node embeddings within the same distribution. In contrast, data parallelism is a more favorable choice for HNE as the network data can be partitioned and assigned to different workers, where each worker can deploy a fully localized model to learn node embeddings for a specific network partition. In our previous work [ref]5, we presented a decentralized architecture DDHH based on data parallelism, that learns low-level vector representations of nodes on partitioned HINs and then align the independently learned representations onto the same space. Although DDHH efficiently computes network embeddings in a decentralized setting, it still suffers from two key challenges, which we will discuss below. Challenge 1: Efficient Partitioning of HIN. DDHH adopts a partitioning strategy where the two hyperedges (i.e., a set of nodes connected via a predefined relation) are contracted based on the number of edges and common nodes between them. This helps preserve the maximum node context within each partition. However, score comparison creates a bottleneck and prevents parallelism during the partitioning phase. Secondly, node links need to be recomputed after every iteration, increasing the search time significantly. Challenge 2: Context-aware Embedding Alignment. Node embeddings learned through different workers need to be aligned onto a unified space to support subsequent tasks. For this purpose, DDHH uses an orthogonal alignment mechanism named Procrustes Alignment. DDHH, however, considers only a single learned representation of a node across multiple HIN partitions when learning the final embedding of each node, ignoring any other representations of that node present across multiple partitions. As each partition carries a specific context, the embedding alignment scheme sacrifices the expressiveness of learned node embeddings. In order to address the above challenges, we propose Decentralized Embedding Framework for Large-scale Heterogeneous Information Networks (DeHIN) that significantly improves the DDHH model in our conference paper with fully distributed partitioning and context-aware alignment.\nIn order to compute partitions efficiently, we put forward a decentralized partitioning strategy based on hyperedges. The partitioning mechanism adopts a binary tree-like pipeline to match the nodes at different workers and a hash table that holds bucket ids for tracing each nodeâ€™s corresponding hyperedges, reducing the lookup time to a constant.\nIn DeHIN, each worker has two buckets of nodes, and it contracts the hyperedges from one bucket into the other depending upon a similarity score. After each iteration, workers share the contracted bucket with their neighbors and the process is repeated until there is only one bucket containing all contracted partitions left. In this way, DeHIN effectively parallelizes the contraction-based HIN partitioning mechanism presented in DDHH while ensuring the quality of each partition. Meanwhile, instead of straightforwardly preserving a nodeâ€™s embedding from one partition during alignment, DeHIN adopts an aggregation strategy to preserve all contexts of each node by accounting for each of the network partitions it appears in. Specifically, as an extension to our conference paper [ref]5, this paper makes the following contributions: We propose a novel, fully parallelizable HNE partitioning algorithm in DeHIN, which preserves the heterogeneity and high-order relationships in each generated partitions with the generated hyperedges while being highly efficient. To maximize the contextual information within each learned node embedding, we design a context-aware alignment scheme. Based on translation matrix approximation, it maps the learned embeddings, received from the distributed workers, onto the a single orthogonal space by jointly considering a nodeâ€™s context in multiple partitions. To show the efficiency and effectiveness of DeHIN, we make use of 4 large-scale datasets, and conduct extensive experimentation on both effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: centralized HNE models unable to scale to large networks due to multiple constraints from memory, computational cost, and accuracy perspectives.
