As proposed in , the goal is to find a complexity measure of networks that is causally informative (predictive) of generalization gaps.\nTo measure this predictive quality,  propose a Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) score,\nwhich measures how informative the complexity measure is about the network‚Äôs generalization given the network‚Äôs hyperparameters (i.e., the information contributed by the measure in addition to the network hyperparameters).\nFor full implementation details of this score, please refer to  and see Appendix A.2, but roughly, higher values of CMI represent greater capability of a complexity score in predicting generalization gaps. In our experiments, we let ùíØŒ±subscriptùíØùõº\\mathcal{T}_{\\alpha} be defined as an interpolation between two points of either different or the same class:\nùíØŒ±‚Äã(x)=(1‚àíŒ±)‚Äãx+Œ±‚Äãx‚Ä≤subscriptùíØùõºùë•1ùõºùë•ùõºsuperscriptùë•‚Ä≤\\mathcal{T}_{\\alpha}(x)=(1-\\alpha)x+\\alpha x^{\\prime},\nFor inter-class interpolation, where x‚Ä≤superscriptùë•‚Ä≤x^{\\prime} is a (random) input from a different class than xùë•x, we range Œ±‚àà[0,0.5)ùõº00.5\\alpha\\in[0,0.5).\nFor the intra-class setup, where xùë•x and x‚Ä≤superscriptùë•‚Ä≤x^{\\prime} are drawn from the same class, we include the upper bound of the magnitude: Œ±‚àà[0,0.5].ùõº00.5\\alpha\\in[0,0.5].\nWhile we explored other varieties of perturbation, such as adding Gaussian noise, we found that this interpolation perturbation was most predictive of generalization gaps for the networks and datasets we tested.\nBoth interpolation perturbations that we test (intra and inter-class) are justifiable for predicting generalization gap.\nWe hypothesize that invariance to interpolation within a class should indicate that a network produces similar representations and ultimately the same class maximum prediction for inputs and latent representations that are within the same class regions.\nInvariance to interpolation between classes up to 50% should indicate that the network has well separated clusters for representations of different classes and is robust to perturbations moving points away from heavily represented class regions in the data.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: The networks from this competition contain the following architectures: VGG , Network-in-Network (NiN) , and Fully Convolutional  (Conv) architectures.\nThe datasets are comprised of CIFAR-10 [ref]28, SVHN , CINIC-10 , Oxford Flowers , Oxford Pets [ref]31, and Fashion MNIST .\nNote, to our knowledge, these datasets are not known to contain personally identifiable information or offensive\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
