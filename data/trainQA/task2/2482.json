It is also known [ref]47 that the solution to a quadratic optimal control (MPC) problem for linear-time invariant system is piecewise-affine. Furthermore, there are good indications that this applies more generally, in particular for non-linear systems [ref]48. This naturally leads to thinking that MLPs with RELU networks are the prime candidates for controlling the attitude with distance to the objective as cost (or reward). In some ways, the resulting piecewise-affine function encodes various proportional gains that should be best adapted to different subdomains of states, so as to reach an optimal cumulated (and discounted, here with discount rate Œ≥=0.99ùõæ0.99\\gamma=0.99111All other parameters, learning rates in particular are the standard ones of Stable Baselines 2.7.0) distance to the target angular rates, until the end of training. In theory , one could find a good indication of the architecture of the neural net in such situations, but the bounds that are derived in  are not convenient for such a highly complex system. It is by no means obvious what architecture will behave best, both for training and for actual controller performance, although a few authors argue that deeper networks should be better, see e.g.\n. Architectures that have been reported in the literature for similar problems are generally alike.\nIn ,\nthe neural net is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with two layers of 64 neurons each, and with tanhtanh\\mathrm{tanh} activation function. In , the part of the controller which is a neural net is a MLP with two layers of 96 neurons each and tanhtanh\\mathrm{tanh} activation function, whose input states (observation space) are all states plus the control.\nIn , the hover mode neural net controller, which is the most comparable to our work, is a MLP with two layers of 400 and 300 neurons respectively, with RELU activation for hidden layers and tanhtanh\\mathrm{tanh} for the last layer.\nIn [ref]19, the resulting architecture is a two layers MLP with 128 neurons on each layer, and RELU activation function. We will report experiments with one to four layers, and with 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64 neurons per layer, with RELU activation function (except for the rescaling of the output, using tanhtanh\\mathrm{tanh}). We limit the reporting of our experiments to these values since we observed that these were enough to find best (and worst) behaviours.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: Neural nets, such as multiple layer perceptrons (MLP) with RELU activation, can efficiently encode all piecewise-affine functions .
