      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Stage Fusion for One-Click Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFollowing , we use MSRA10K 7 for training and partition the dataset into three non-overlapping subsets of 800080008000, 100010001000 and 100010001000 images as our training, validation and test set. We report the mIoU after training for 16K iterations and again after network convergence (at 43k iterations for us, vs. 260k iterations in ) in Table 1. During training, we resize the images to 512×512512512512\\times 512 pixels. This choice of resolution is driven primarily by matching the resolution to that of the training images for the ResNet-101 backbone [ref]21. The -baseline models are trained using only the 333-channel RGB image and the instance ground truth mask without any user click transformations. The -early models use Gaussian guidance maps ; the network input is 333-channel RGB image and Gaussian encoding of the user’s tap on the object of interest (Fig. 2(a)). The -multi models refer to the multi-stage fusion models with Gaussian encoding of user clicks. Note that we do not train a late-fusion model; standalone late-fusion models show inferior performance compared to their early-fusion counterparts [ref]7. From Table. 1, we observe that our trained network converges mostly within 16K iterations. For simplistic datasets such as MSRA10K and ECSSD, the vgg-baseline without user click transformation compares favourably with the approach of  at the same training resolution of 256×256256256256\\times 256. resnet-baseline models trained with 512×512512512512\\times 512 images significantly outperform  reporting absolute mIoU gains of till 7%percent77\\% across the datasets. Based on this result alone, we conclude that one-click (and standard) interactive segmentation approaches should be benchmarked on more challenging datasets. Examples include PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO, which feature cluttered scenes, multiple objects, occlusions and challenging lighting conditions. (see Table 3). Furthermore, with only the Gaussian transformation and ResNet-101 backbone trained on 512×512512512512\\times 512, we are able to achieve mIoU increase in the range of 555-11%percent1111\\% across datasets at convergence w.r.t . Having the multi-stage fusion offers us absolute mIoU gains of 111-4%percent44\\% w.r.t the early fusion variant (resnet-early vs. resnet-multi when trained with 512×512512512512\\times 512 images). Additionally, our resnet models require significantly less memory; 195.8195.8195.8 MB (stored as 323232-bit/444-byte floating point numbers) instead of the 652.45652.45652.45 MB required for the segmentation network of .\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: we resize the images to 512×512512512512\\times 512 pixels.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
