      "content": "Paper Title: OFEI: A Semi-black-box Android Adversarial Sample Attack Framework Against DLaaS\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning algorithms are one of the most vulnerable parts of the DLaaS system [ref]5. Because of the nonlinearity of the deep neural network , a slight disturbance applied to the input by the attacker will cause the output to be changed. In addition, the linear calculation of the high-dimensional space easily enlarges the disturbance to the input [ref]7. Therefore, the existence of deep neural network linear part also leads to vulnerability. Furthermore, the overfitting caused by insufficient model averaging and regularization makes the attack possible. In the image field, there are many adversarial sample attack methods. Goodfellow [ref]7 proposed the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) which performs multiple iterations and adds tiny disturbances to each pixel. Papernot et al.  proposed the jacobian-based saliency map attack (JSMA) method, which constructs adversarial saliency maps through the forward derivative. The JSMA method can effectively explore the feature space of the adversarial sample and modify the feature that has the greatest impact on the output. Moosavi-Dezfooli et al.  proposed the DeepFool method to calculate the minimum necessary disturbance and applied it to the construction of adversarial samples. The L2 norm is used to limit the disturbance scale during the attack. The DeepFool attack on the model is better than the FGSM and JSMA methods. Alzantot et al.  proposed the GenAttack method for the black box, which is based on a genetic algorithm to search for adversarial samples and does not need to know the gradient information of the classifier. Compared with GenAttack, our proposed OFEI greatly reduces the number of queries. In the field of Android malware detection, the attack methods are limited by the application scenarios. Grosse et al.  applied the JSMA method from a continuous differentiable space to discretely restricted malware detection, which proves that adversarial attacks do exist in the domain of malware detection. With the JSMF attack method, the misclassification rate of the classifier reaches 80% in the experiment. Compared with JSMF, our proposed OFEI attack framework has a higher misclassification rate. Li et al.  proposed the pointwise attack, which first adds noise perturbation to the malware to construct an adversarial sample, and then modifies features to generate an adversarial sample with the least perturbation. Compared with the pointwise attack, OFEI has fewer disturbances and fewer query times.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Deep learning algorithms are one of the most vulnerable parts of the DLaaS system [ref]5.
