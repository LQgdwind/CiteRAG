      "content": "Paper Title: D3Feat: Joint Learning of Dense Detection and Description of 3D Local Features\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPoint cloud registration aims to find an optimal transformation between two partially overlapped point cloud fragments, which is a fundamental task in applications such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) [ref]23  and 3D Lidar-based mapping [ref]31. In above contexts, the local keypoint detection and description serve as two keys for obtaining robust point cloud alignment results. The recent research on 3D local feature descriptors has shifted to learning-based approaches. However, due to the difficulty of acquiring ground-truth data, most existing works often overlook the keypoint detection learning in point cloud matching, and instead randomly sample a set of points for feature description.\nApparently, this strategy might suffer from several drawbacks. First, the randomly sampled points are often poorly localized, resulting in inaccurate transformation estimates during geometric verification such as RANSAC .\nSecond, those random points might appear in non-salient regions like smooth surfaces, which may lead to\nindiscriminative descriptors that adversely introduce noise in later matching steps. Third, to obtain a full scene coverage, an oversampling of random points is required that considerably decreases the efficiency of the whole matching process. In essence, we argue that a small number of keypoints suffice to align point clouds successfully,\nand well-localized keypoints can\nfurther improve the registration accuracy. The imbalance of detector and descriptor learning motivates us to learn these two tightly coupled components jointly.\nHowever, the learning-based 3D keypoint detector has not received much attention in previous studies. One attempt made by 3DFeat-Net [ref]14 predicts a patch-wise detection score, whereas only limited spatial context is considered and a dense inference for the entire point cloud is not applicable in practice. Another recent work USIP  adopts an unsupervised learning scheme that encourages keypoints to be covariant under arbitrary transformations. However, without a joint learning of detection and description, the resulting detector might not match the capability of the descriptor, thus preventing the release of the potential for a fully learned 3D feature. Instead, in this paper, we seek for a joint learning framework that is able to not only predict keypoints densely, but also tightly couple the detector with a descriptor with shared weights for fast inference. \nTo this end, we draw inspiration from D2-Net  in 2D domain for a joint learning of a feature detector and descriptor. However, the extension of D2-Net for 3D point clouds is non-trivial. First, a network that allows for dense feature prediction\nin 3D is needed instead of previous patch-based architectures.\nIn this work, we resort to KPConv , a newly proposed convolutional operation on 3D point clouds, to build a fully convolutional network to consume an unstructured 3D point cloud directly.\nSecond, we adapt D2-Net to handle the inherent density variations of 3D point clouds, which is the key to achieve highly repeatable keypoints in 3D domain. Third, observing that the original loss in D2-Net does not guarantee convergence in our context, we propose a novel self-supervised detector loss guided by the on-the-fly feature matching results during training, so as to encourage the detection scores to be consistent with the reliability of predicted keypoints. To summarize, our contributions are threefold: We leverage a fully convolutional network based on KPConv, and adopt a joint learning framework for 3D local feature detection and description, without constructing dual structures, for fast inference.\n We propose a novel density-invariant keypoint selection strategy, which\nis the key to obtaining repeatable keypoints for 3D point clouds.  We propose a self-supervised detector loss that receives meaningful guidance from the on-the-fly feature matching results during training, which guarantees the convergence of tightly coupled descriptor and detector. We demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art methods by conducting extensive experiments on both 3DMatch of indoor settings, and KITTI, ETH of outdoor settings. To our best knowledge, we are the first to handle the Dense Detection and Description of 3D local Features for 3D point clouds in a joint learning framework. We refer to our approach as D3Feat.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: aims to find an optimal transformation between two partially overlapped point cloud fragments, which is a fundamental task in applications such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) [ref]23  and 3D Lidar-based mapping [ref]31.
