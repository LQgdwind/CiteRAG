      "content": "Paper Title: PhishSim: Aiding Phishing Website Detection with a Feature-Free Tool\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPhishing is defined as a cyber-attack which uses social engineering via digital means to persuade victims to disclose their personal information, such as their password or credit card number . The strategies used in phishing attacks exploit human vulnerabilities in distinguishing between authentic and phishing messages or websites [ref]29.  Phishing is a low-cost, yet essential tool to aid various cyber-attacks, as it is often used as the key step in advanced persistent threats. With our ever-increasing reliance on various digital platforms, phishing has become a versatile weapon in the attacker’s arsenal. Despite the general definition of phishing, the term itself has been commonly associated specifically with Web phishing attacks that use emails or SMS as the attack vector to lure victims into submitting personal information via phishing websites or by downloading malicious software. These websites are typically crafted to look professional and convincing as if they are legitimate. As mentioned in their report, the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) recorded a considerable increase in unique phishing attacks from 2014 to 2016 , which caused significant financial losses, estimated to be between $60 million and $3 billion per year in the United States . In another report, the APWG detected around 65,400 phishing websites per month in 2018 , while PhishLabs reported that phishing volume grew by 40.9% in 2018 compared to the previous years [ref]32. PhishLabs also reported how attack volumes continue to increase as actors’ methods evolve and adapt to changes in the digital landscape. Furthermore, the use of free hosting providers has resulted in an increase in phishing attacks during the past four years, from 3.0% in 2015 to 13.8% in 2018. It is also relatively easy to set up phishing websites using phishing toolkits. The availability of these toolkits enables a single actor to create a large number of professional-looking phishing websites in a short period of time. As an example, PhishLabs reported a sharp increase in the number of attacks in August 2018. This phishing campaign used at least 2,000 freely-hosted phishing websites, all created using the same kit [ref]32. With the availability of these phishing kits provided by organized crime groups, it is likely that the number of phishing attacks will increase further in the future. The use of free hosts, phishing kits, and SSL certificates show that there has been a persistent effort by actors to capitalize upon new opportunities, resulting in the continuous growth of the number of phishing attacks from year to year. This makes it challenging to develop a reliable phishing detection method that can deal with the dynamic nature of the attacks . To prevent the negative impacts of phishing, researchers have studied various methods in recent years to build an automated phishing website detection system by investigating the website content, appearance, URL, and other web-related features      . In general, these approaches could be classified into two categories. The first approach finds intrinsic features of phishing websites and attempts to detect these attacks based on these specific characteristics. Many studies in recent years go along with this type of approach, using machine learning and deep learning methods. While these methods have shown to perform well in detecting phishing, their detection are less robust towards concept drift since they are heavily based on certain characteristics assumed to be related to phishing websites (e.g., specific types of web forms or unusual structures in the URLs) which may change and become irrelevant in the future. Meanwhile, the second approach tries to detect phishing by measuring similarities between phishing websites and the targeted legitimate website. This method is less robust to zero-day phishing attacks compared to the first approach. However, the similarity-based methods are effective for quickly filtering a large amount of phishing websites, before being fed into machine learning based methods which typically take more time to perform classification. A number of previous studies have proposed the use of various similarity metrics and models to detect near similar phishing websites. These similarity-based techniques usually require the websites to be modeled into a certain representation space, e.g. using DOM trees, bag-of-words, or Doc2Vec models . In contrast, we attempt to propose a feature-free method for detecting phishing websites which uses the Normalized Compression Distance  to compute website HTML similarity. The rationale of the study is based on the work of Cui et al. , which reveals the commonalities between phishing websites, demonstrating that 90% of the 19,066 confirmed phishing websites from PhishTank  are replicas or variations of other already known phishing websites. In their study, Cui et al. proposes a new distance metric, the proportional distance, to assess website similarities for detecting phishing. This distance metric takes into account the number of occurrences of a predefined set of HTML tags, which are found to provide significant information whether a website is related to phishing attacks. On the other hand, the use of prototypes and the Normalized Compression Distance in our proposed method would eliminate the need of the predefined HTML tags, and uses compression algorithms to universally measure similarities between two streams of data based on the amount of information they have in common. Our proposed method is not limited to a specific kind of phishing attack or phishing campaign, nor a certain type of the phishing email. However, our method is limited to variations of phishing websites which have occurred at least once, and unable to identify a new phishing website with a completely different and distinctive HTML structure. To summarize, this paper makes the following contributions: We introduce a systematic method to perform website similarity measurements for detecting similar phishing websites using Normalized Compression Distance (NCD). We provide an analysis on the similarities and differences between phishing and legitimate website contents and visual appearances, and how content-based methods would effectively detect phishing attacks better than visual-based methods. We propose PhishSim as a tool to effectively detect slightly modified or near-similar phishing websites using prototype-based learning algorithms and the Normalized Compression Distance, which is a parameter-free and application independent distance metric to measure similarities between websites’ HTML content. This tool works by measuring the pairwise similarity between websites in the dataset, clustering these websites, and performing phishing classifications based on whether a website is grouped in the same cluster with a known phishing website.\n We introduce a feature-free phishing detection system architecture that can be deployed within intranet servers or in the cloud. The paper is organized as follows. Section II provides an overview of past studies which are related to our work in phishing detection systems. In section III, we introduce the normalized compression distance (NCD) and some background mathematical concepts which are used in this paper. Section IV describes the overview of our system. Section V provides results on the website similarity analysis to observe the characteristics between a phishing website and its legitimate target website based on the pairwise NCD value. Section VI provides results on the optimal distance threshold selection process. We describe the experimental setup in Section VII, then provide the performance evaluation results in Section VIII and further analysis on these results in Section IX. At the end of the paper, in Section X, we wrap up with conclusions.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: such as their password or credit card number .
