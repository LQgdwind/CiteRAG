      "content": "Paper Title: Latent Evolution Model for Change Point Detection in Time-varying Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTime-varying network has shed a light on the spatio-temporal information of this network (graph), which represents multiple structure of nodes and dynamic changes [ref]1. A stable and gradual development of such network is essential to many real-world applications such as city-wide traffic management, weather detection, and detection of epidemic outbreaks [ref]2  [ref]4  . As one of the anomaly detection tasks, change point detection (CPD) concentrates on identifying the anomalous timestamps in temporal networks, which deviates from the normal network evolution . For example, in the Canadian parliament voting network, there is an anomalous voting pattern in 2013, as shown in the right part of Figure¬†1 (a). The graph in the red box reveals different voting interactions compared with previous two years (2011 and 2012). CPD can identify anomalies like this from the time-varying network sequences. Nowadays, existing methods mainly compare the target network with a learned normal graph pattern  . This normal pattern is extracted from previous networks in a given time-window via a mean or global representation learning method¬†  . Even these methods have achieved encouraging results on the synthetic test, most of them neglect capturing the real-world dynamic evolution patterns. In other words, they are suitable for implementing in a relatively stable environment , but not always able to capture anomalies in temporal networks (e.g., traffic network) , as they do not take into account the evolution trend across the temporal networks   . For example, the upper part of Figure 2 illustrates the temporal changes of crowd flow in the Sydney traffic network. If these traffic maps are embedded into a latent space, their latent representations could be presented in the bottom part of this figure. There is a clear upward trend in the real-world traffic network. Considering the change point detection for the next timestamp, we aim to capture the time-evolving trend and make an accurate prediction to the traffic map at Tn‚Äãe‚Äãx‚Äãtsubscriptùëáùëõùëíùë•ùë°T_{next}. When a prediction (represented by the black dotted circle) is obtained, we can compare it with the real map representation (the green dotted circle) at Tn‚Äãe‚Äãx‚Äãtsubscriptùëáùëõùëíùë•ùë°T_{next}. However, if we use an average or global method to compute the normal graph pattern of previous networks, we can only capture the latent representation as illustrated by the red dotted circle. Apparently, the g‚Äãa‚Äãp2ùëîùëésubscriptùëù2gap_{2} is much larger than g‚Äãa‚Äãp1ùëîùëésubscriptùëù1gap_{1}, suggesting that only extracting the previous normal graph pattern based on the average method leads to a distorted result. Moreover, a time-varying network is not only reflected by the link connections, but also varied in the weight changes. Even though a few of methods can capture the changes for link connections, they do not consider the dynamic weights . Motivated by the above issues, we draw inspiration from several latent space prediction model   and propose a new evolution method for the change point detection. One of the purposes in this paper is to capture the evolution trend of a time-varying network. Once the trend is learned, we can make a prediction of the network with the evolving patterns. Accordingly, the difference between the prediction and the actual network can be recognized as a criteria to identify the change point. After casting the problem as a prediction task, there are two challenges along with that need to be carefully handled. One is how to capture temporal dependencies and evolution trends. The second is how to identify the anomalous network by considering the prediction result. To address these challenges, we have developed a prediction model for the time-varying network, and proposed a trade-off strategy based on the prediction result and the previous normal graph pattern to detect change points. Specifically, we first embedded the original network into latent spaces via matrix factorization model. Then, our method goes a step further to capture the dynamic movements of these latent spaces from current timestamp to the next via the latent transition learning process. When the latent spaces and transition matrices are learned, we can make a prediction to the target network. At second, we choose the Laplacian spectrum strategy to compare the differences between the prediction and the actual network. At last, the normal graph pattern learned from previous networks is taken into consideration as a trade-off strategy to identify whether the target network is a change point. We summarize the main contributions and innovations of this paper as follows: Unlike existing methods detecting change points directly   , we formulate the CPD problem as a temporal network prediction task, and propose a data-driven forecasting method via the latent evolution model, called LEM-CPD, which learns network evolution trends over time. To improve the effectiveness and robustness of the model in various real-world scenarios, we further take long-term and periodic properties into consideration, and propose a novel long-term guidance method based on the weighted multi-view learning. We develop a trade-off strategy to identify change points based on the Laplacian spectrum method, which balances the importance between the\nprediction network and the normal graph pattern extracted from previous networks.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Time-varying network has shed a light on the spatio-temporal information of this network (graph), which represents multiple structure of nodes and dynamic changes [ref]1.
