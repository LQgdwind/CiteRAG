      "content": "Paper Title: TransformerG2G: Adaptive time-stepping for learning temporal graph embeddings using transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the Table 5 we show the comparison of the temporal link prediction task against other embedding algorithms for the six benchmarks. To evaluate the performance of our model, TransformerG2G, in the task of temporal link prediction, we compare the proposed TransformerG2G with other baselines: DynGEM [ref]31, dyngraph2vecAE , dyngraph2vecAERNN , EvolveGCN , ROLAND  and DynG2G . Brief descriptions about these methods are presented below. DynGEM [ref]31: This is a dynamic graph embedding method that uses autoencoders to obtain graph embeddings. The weights of the previous timestamp are used to initialize the weights of the current timestamp, and thereby makes the training process faster. dyngraph2vecAE : This method uses temporal information in dynamic graphs to obtain embeddings using an autoencoder. The encoder takes in the historical information of the graph, and the decoder reconstructs the graph at the next timestamp, and the latent vector corresponds to the embedding of the current timestamp. dyngraph2vecAERNN : This method is similar to dyngraph2vecAE, except that the feed-forward neural network in the encoder is replaced by LSTM layers. This method also incorporates historical information while predicting graph embeddings. EvolveGCN : A graph convolution network (GCN) forms the core of this model. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is used to evolve the GCN parameters along time. ROLAND : A graph neural network is combined with GRU to learn the temporal dynamics. The GNN has attention layers to capture the spatial-level node importance. For this case, we ran the code from the official GitHub repository 999https://github.com/snap-stanford/roland 5 times and the mean and standard deviation of the MAP and MRR are reported. We note the original code did not include MAP computation so we added to the code for comparison with our benchmarks. We also note that the results reported in  are slightly different from our results because the average in  was taken over only 3 times. The reason we ran it 5 times is because we observed a large variability in the results of the individual runs. DynG2G : This method uses the G2G encoder at its core to obtain the embeddings. The weights from the previous timestamp are used to initialize the weights of the next timestamp to make the training faster. Unlike the previous methods, DynG2G includes information about uncertainty of the embeddings. We see that the TransformerG2G model outperforms other methods for all datasets except SBM and Slashdot dataset. The MAP and MRR values for the SBM dataset of TransformerG2G is very close to that of DynG2G and better than other methods. We did not see an improvement in MAP here due to the Markovian nature of the dataset. In the case of Slashdot, TransformerG2G did not perform well because of the low number of timestamps and the high novelty of the dataset. Note that in the multi-step method, the importance given to different historical timestamps is a hyperparameter chosen by the user, whereas in TransformerG2G, the attention mechanism at its core adaptively assigns the importance to the different timestamps. For all the baseline methods, except ROLAND, we have used the MAP and MRR values as reported in  and . However, for the Reality Mining and Slashdot datasets, the MAP and MRR values for all the baselines were not available in the referenced resources or in the articles that introduced these baseline models, hence we did not compare against all the other baseline methods.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: for the six benchmarks.
