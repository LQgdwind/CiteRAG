      "content": "Paper Title: Procrustes: a Dataflow and Accelerator for Sparse Deep Neural Network Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks are known to be vastly overparameterized: pruning techniques can typically reduce the weight count by an order of magnitude [25, 16, 15, 28, 14, 43, 29, etc.]. This sparsity comes at the cost of irregular memory accesses and computation patterns, and several accelerators have been proposed to enable efficient inference on sparse models [13, 50, 36, 7, 11, etc.]. None of these approaches were, however, designed for energy-efficient training. This is because they target a context where pruning occurs after training: a model is first trained with the full parameter set, then pruned, and finally re-trained to recover accuracy . While this saves energy at inference time, training the pruned network takes more time and energy than training an equivalent dense network to the same accuracy. Skipping the pre-training step is not an option: even if oracular knowledge of the pruned model connectivity is assumed, training the pruned model from scratch sacrifices accuracy compared to the original network  [ref]28. Still, the very existence of pruned networks suggests that it must be possible to somehow train them. Recent work has demonstrated that a model pruned by an order of magnitude can be trained provided that the initialization for the unpruned subset of weights is preserved ; this can be achieved either by dynamically selecting the most productive gradient subspace  or by iteratively increasing sparsity  . Ideally, such sparse-from-scratch training can offer significant savings. Figure 1 shows this for VGG-S [ref]46 pruned 5×5\\times (15M→→\\rightarrow3M weights) using the Dropback algorithm , in an idealized 16×\\times16 PEs training system where (i) sparsity is evenly distributed within each layer so all PEs receive the same workload (i.e., perfect load balancing), and (ii) sparse weights are stored in an idealized compressed format with no overhead, and (iii) retained weights selection is instant and cost-free (see Section VI-A for setup details). While the exact improvement varies with the geometry and sparsity of each layer, leveraging 5×5\\times sparsity can yield up to 2.6×2.6\\times speedup with 2.3×2.3\\times less energy consumption over the entire network. In practice, however, none of the existing sparse training methods can reach this potential. Most    require sorting all weights to determine the parameters to retain; with weight counts in the tens of millions, sorting is an expensive proposition. Several   achieve only small pruning factors and suffer accuracy loss. Some   prune the model very gradually; this implies (i) no peak memory footprint reduction, (ii) mediocre energy savings because the average sparsity is low during most of the training process, and (iii) the need to support two weight storage formats (dense and sparse) and switch formats mid-way during training. The remaining technique  maintains the target weight sparsity throughout training, but gives up computation sparsity — a significant drawback for training, where weights are usually 32-bit floating-point numbers that are energetically expensive to multiply. ∂ℒ∂Wℒ𝑊\\frac{\\partial\\!\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial W} ∂ℒ∂Wℒ𝑊\\frac{\\partial\\!\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial W} ∂ℒ∂Wℒ𝑊\\frac{\\partial\\!\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial W} In addition, existing accelerators that support sparse inference are inadequate for sparse training. Weights are represented in formats that directly correspond to the dataflow being used [13, 50, 36, 7, 11, etc.]; this works well when weights are always accessed in the same order during inference, but does not support the different weight access patterns that arise in different phases of training (see Section II-A). Accelerators that perform load balancing (e.g., Sparten [ref]11) do this in software as a preprocessing step; this works for inference where weight sparsity is static, but not for training where weight sparsity changes dynamically. Finally, recent proposals like SCNN  and Sparten [ref]11 use complex hardware to exploit two-sided sparsity (i.e., both weight and activation sparsity); this can be leveraged during the forward-pass phase of training, but usually does not exist in the backpropagation or weight update phases because the ubiquitous batch normalization destroys layer sparsity in the back-propagated gradient ∂ℒ∂yℒ𝑦\\frac{\\partial\\!\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y}, so the additional hardware costs are not warranted for training. (We describe these challenges in more detail in Section II.) In this paper, we tackle the challenges of accelerating sparse training by combining algorithmic adaptation with dataflow and hardware optimizations. The accelerator architecture we propose, Procrustes, relies on four key insights: Two-sided sparsity can only be leveraged in the forward pass, but increases interconnect complexity [36, 7, etc.]. Procrustes therefore exploits one source of sparsity in each training phase: weight sparsity in the forward and backward passes, and activation sparsity in the weight update phase. This maximizes energy and latency improvements while minimizing hardware complexity. While load-balancing a sparse workload across a 2D PE array can destroy spatial reuse, spatial reuse generally arises in only one hardware dimension (either row or column broadcast). Procrustes uses dataflows that distribute the non-sparse minibatch dimension (always available during training) across one hardware dimension and the sparse tensor dimension(s) across the other hardware dimension, load-balancing the workload across the minibatch dimension. This achieves good utilization and preserves spatial reuse without a complex interconnect. While sparse training approaches generally rely on sorting to determine which weights to keep, it actually suffices to partition the weight set into two sets (retained and discarded). Procrustes replaces the sorting with a partitioning scheme based on dynamic quantile estimation , which avoids the computation and storage overheads of sorting. Weight initialization values are only important during early phases of training and quickly outweighed by the accumulated gradients. Therefore, in sparse training algorithms where retained initial weight components prevent computation sparsity , the initial weights can be decayed to zero early in the training process. In the remainder of the paper, we first show how to adapt an existing sparse training algorithm  to make it suitable for hardware accelerator implementation; the adapted algorithm achieves 3.9×3.9\\times–11.7×11.7\\times sparsity while maintaining unpruned accuracy on tasks like CIFAR10 and ImageNet. We then propose a hardware architecture that adapts a standard 2D-PE-array inference accelerator to enable sparse training without incurring the dataflow limitations and interconnect complexity of the only prior sparse training accelerator proposal  and achieves much higher sparsity. Finally, we develop a sparse data representation suitable for training access patterns, and an inexpensive load-balancing technique that preserves maximum spatio-temporal reuse without complicating the on-chip interconnect. Most of the modifications are not specific to the sparse training method we adapt, but rather are necessary for accelerating any existing sparse training approach. Compared to an equivalent accelerator that does not support training-time sparsity, Procrustes uses 2.27×2.27\\times–3.26×3.26\\times less energy and offers 2.28×2.28\\times–4×4\\times speedup without compromising accuracy on state-of-the art networks on ImageNet and CIFAR-10.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: step is not an option: even if oracular knowledge of the pruned model connectivity is assumed, training the pruned model from scratch sacrifices accuracy compared to the original network  [ref]28.
