      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey on Deep Learning-Based Monocular Spacecraft Pose Estimation: Current State, Limitations and Prospects\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section provides a summary of the spacecraft pose estimation datasets, simulators and rendering tools for synthetic image generation, and testbeds for validation. Datasets:\nTable 3 summarises the properties of the major spacecraft pose estimation datasets. The properties of the datasets include the number of images, the target spacecraft model, image resolution, annotations and the rendering tools used for the synthetic image generation. The number of images in the currently available spacecraft pose estimation datasets is between 104superscript10410^{4} and 105superscript10510^{5}. This is relatively low compared to some typical datasets used for other machine learning tasks such as image classification and object detection. The COCO  dataset, one of the standard datasets used for object detection, contains ~300k images. ImageNet dataset  primarily used for classification contains ~14M images. Similarly, YCB dataset , a recent generic dataset for 6 DoF pose estimation, has ~133k images. The target spacecraft model used in the datasets also plays a vital role in determining the dataset characteristics. For example, a smaller target size will lead to a smaller operation range and vice-versa. The TANGO satellite  model used in the multiple datasets [ref]113  [ref]71 [ref]115 [ref]115  has a coarse dimension of 80×75×32cm will lead to the operation range of ~10m. However, for Soyuz or Cygnus models in other datasets increases the operating range to 40 ~ 80 m. Similar constraints will apply to testbed data as well. A 1:1 mockup scale of TANGO spacecraft in SPEED+ [ref]113 leads to a lower range in the lab-generated images due to the size constraint of the facility. Usually, a scaled mock-up is considered a solution to increase the validation range in the testbed scenarios. The level of annotations may vary for different datasets; for spacecraft pose estimation applications, each image in the dataset must be appropriately annotated with corresponding relative 6DoF pose labels. All the datasets mentioned in Table 3 are adequately annotated with 6DoF pose labels. However, the hybrid algorithm approach discussed in Section 2.1 demands secondary annotations such as the bounding boxes and the keypoints. To recover the secondary annotations from pose labels, it is necessary to have 3D information on the edges or vertices of the target. Even for the standard datasets such as SPEED [ref]71 and SPEED+ [ref]113, the only way to use a hybrid approach is to recover the 3D locations of interested keypoints is via the 3D reconstruction methods . These recovered keypoints will be used to construct secondary annotations such as bounding boxes, keypoints, segmentation masks and even ellipse heatmap annotations . The lack of secondary annotations can be an issue for multi-task learning approaches where the annotations (such as segmentation masks) could be used to define auxiliary tasks intended to prevent learning domain-specific features to improve generalisation . Several learning-based approaches are evolving to generate secondary annotation to address the label scarcity, such as depth estimation using a single image depth estimator  and an image segmentation technique . Some self-supervised approaches are evolving as an alternate way to get bounding box annotations for a single target in the image . Though these approaches aid annotations, they cannot replace the properly calibrated annotations recorded during synthetic data generation. Simulators and Rendering Tools: Computer graphics allow us to create realistic images of objects based on high-quality textures using ray tracing. Ray Tracing techniques mimic how light interacts with the real world and rely on evaluating and simulating the path of view lines from the observer camera to objects in the field of view. This simulation enables the calculation of the light intensity of associated pixels. Several efforts were made towards creating simulators for space applications. Realistic image simulation tools were used in previous missions to aid vision-based navigation in space/planetary environments (such as the Lunar environment, Asteroid surface), and it includes the PANGU (Planet and Asteroid Natural scene Generation Utility)  and the SurRender  by Airbus. The University of Dundee has developed the PANGU simulation tool, which generates realistic, high-quality, synthetic surface images of planets and asteroids. PANGU uses a custom GPU-based renderer to render the scene. Airbus’s Surrender can be used in two modes of image rendering, ray tracing and OpenGL9. It can produce physically accurate images providing the known irradiance (each pixel contains an irradiance value expressed in W/m2). Other general rendering tools such as Blender , Unreal Engine , and Mitsuba  were also used to generate synthetic images. The main issue with these tools is that they are designed for general usage and are not customised for space imagery. A brief comparison of rendering tools for synthetic imagery was provided in . Recently, efforts [ref]71,  have been made toward developing simulation tools specific for the purpose of synthetic image generation for spacecraft pose estimation. SPEED and SPEED+ images are obtained using the Optical Simulator , based on an OpenGL rendering pipeline. The images from SPEED and SPEED+ are validated against the real images of TANGO spacecraft from the PRISMA mission using histogram comparison [ref]71. However, to our knowledge, no tool can be considered a de facto standard to generate space imagery for spacecraft pose estimation. Testbeds:\nIn spacecraft pose estimation, collecting images from space for training and evaluating algorithms is extremely difficult and expensive. Laboratory testbeds (see Figure 15) are considered as an alternative to replicate relative motion and orbital lighting conditions. Table 4, summarises different laboratory testbed facilities based on their size, manipulation capabilities, tracking systems,\nperception sensors and orbital motion simulations. Some of the SoTA testbed includes The Robotic Testbed for Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON) at Stanford’s Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB) , STAR Lab at the University of Surrey , SnT Zero-G Lab at the University of Luxembourg , GMV Platform-Art  , German Aerospace Center European Proximity Operations Simulator 2.0 (DLR EPOS)  and European Space Agency’s GNC Rendezvous, Approach and Landing Simulator (GRALS) . These testbeds generally have robotic manipulators to carry the payloads. The payloads can be different target spacecraft mock-up models or mounted cameras mimicking a chaser. Different lighting equipment has been used for simulating space conditions. For instance, in SPEED+ [ref]113, the images collected in a sunlamp setup replicate the sun’s bright light, and those collected with a lightbox setup emulate the diffused light of the earth’s albedo, respectively. Motion capture systems are extensively used to collect pose labels based on the reflective markers attached to the target and cameras. However, these motion capture systems should be carefully calibrated  to generate accurate ground truth data, which can be tedious and time-consuming. The next section discusses the major issue with the current spacecraft pose estimation datasets: the domain gap between synthetic data used for training and the real laboratory/ space-borne images used for testing/ validating and deploying the DL-based algorithms.\n\nReference markers found: [113]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]113: role in determining the dataset characteristics.
