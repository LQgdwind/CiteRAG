      "content": "Paper Title: Generalization in Automated Process Discovery: A Framework based on Event Log Patterns\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs for the datasets, we used the artificial datasets from the AA [ref]5 and NE  papers, in order to showcase the strengths and weaknesses of each generalization measure in a qualitative evaluation. These datasets allow us to highlight specific control structures to explain the differences in the generalization values between the different measures. Furthermore, we used the real-life log-model pairs from  to evaluate the time performance of our measure against that of the two baselines, and provide a drill down of generalization values for the two patterns. The AA dataset contains one event log and nine process models each representing this log with differing levels of generalization. Fig. 13 shows the event log and all process models. The event log (Fig. 13(a)) contains five traces with differing trace counts that were generated by simulating the original process model shown in Fig. 13(b). The two process models with a single trace (Fig. 13(c)) or with four distinct traces have no generalizations for the event log, while the flower model (Fig. 13(d)) has all possible generalizations. All other models have varying degrees of generalization by either using parallel structures or loops for a subset or all activities in the log. Process models from Fig. 13(f) and Fig. 13(g) generalize by modeling activities G and H as concurrent or repeatable, respectively. Fig. 13(h) models activity D as a repeatable activity. The model from Fig. 13(i) uses a parallel structure for all activities. The round-robin model in Fig. 13(j) has a set sequence for all activities that can be started at any activity and be completed once all other activities have been executed. This sequence can also be repeated any number of times.\nSince the event log of the AA dataset AA-original is rather simple and does not contain many patterns, we decided to extend this dataset with three additional logs shown in Fig. 14 to demonstrate the behavior of the pattern-based generalization measure with an increasing amount of patterns: Event log AA-repetitive (Fig. 14(c) in A), where activities G, H and D are repeatable in different cycles; Event log AA-concurrent (Fig. 14(a) in A), where the activities D, F, G and H are present in all different orders, i.e. they are concurrent; Event log AA-composite (Fig. 14(b) in A) that contains all the traces from the original AA log, log AA-repetitive and log AA-concurrent. We compare all four event logs, AA-original, AA-repetitive, AA-concurrent and AA-composite, against all nine process models of the AA dataset. The dataset in  contains one event log and five process models. Similar to the AA dataset, the NE dataset contains a generating model, a single trace model, a distinct traces model and a flower model. The last model is a fully connected model, where every activity can be executed after every other activity. This model from a behavioral viewpoint is equivalent to the flower model. Thus, we decided to discard it from our experiments. To replace this model, we extended the NE dataset by discovering two process models with the Split Miner and Inductive Miner. The total number of log-model pairs for the qualitative dataset is thus 40. For the quantitative evaluation, we used the dataset in , which contains a collection of 17 real-life event logs. They originate from the 4TU Center for Research Data777https://data.4tu.nl/repository/collection:event_logs_real. This dataset was also used in a recent benchmark for process discovery . It consists of logs from the Business Process Intelligence challenge (BPIC) series, i.e. BPIC12 , BPIC13cp , BPIC13inc , BPIC14 , BPIC15 0, BPIC17 1, BPIC18 2, BPIC19 3, the Road Traffic Fines Management process log (RTFMP) 4 and the SEPSIS Cases log (SEPSIS) 5.\nAs in , the logs for BPIC15, BPIC17, BPIC18 and BPIC19 were filtered by removing infrequent events with the filtering technique from 6 since it was not possible to discover process models from the corresponding unfiltered logs. The logs that were filtered are annotated with `​`​f′′``superscript𝑓′′``f^{\\prime\\prime}.\nThese public logs cover process executions from different domains such as finance, healthcare, government and IT service management. For each event log in the quantitative evaluation, we used two process models discovered automatically using SM and IM. This resulted in a total of 34 log-model pairs for the quantitative evaluation.\n Table 1 shows the characteristics of all event logs used in our evaluation as well as the characteristics of all discovered patterns that were investigated in the pattern-based generalization measure. The logs feature a wide range of characteristics, including simple and complex logs. The size of the logs differs in terms of the total number of events (3.7K to 2.5M) and traces (500 to 221K). The number of unique (`​`​U​n​q′′``𝑈𝑛superscript𝑞′′``Unq^{\\prime\\prime}) events varies from 4 to 82, while the number of unique traces varies from 5 to 28K. The number of unique traces relates to how many problems need to be solved by any generalization measure while the unique number of events? correlates with the difficulty of each problem. For the repetitive patterns, we report various measures related to the amount of repetitive behavior present in the event logs and the complexity to compute the generalization. The number of extended traces #Ext (0 to 27K) represents the number of unique traces that contain tandem repeats, i.e. the number of traces for which alignments need to be computed to determine the generalization for repetitive behavior. The number of repetitive patterns #Ps (0 to 150K) demonstrates the amount of repetitive behavior in the event log and relates to the number of extended tandem repeats. The average number of repeated labels ∅\\varnothinglbls (0 to 4) shows how many labels on average are repeated per pattern. The weight of the repetitive patterns (0 to 203K) is the sum of the number of traces related to the repetitive patterns. For the concurrent patterns, the table records various measures for both the global and the local concurrency oracle. For the qualitative evaluation, we applied no filters to either concurrency oracle. For the quantitative evaluation, we observed that infrequent activities would induce concurrencies that would lead to an exponential amount of patterns, sometimes leading to all activities being concurrent. Hence, we decided to apply filters to both concurrency oracles as described in Sec. 3.3: a filter of 5% to the global oracle and an occurrence of 55% and a balance of 10% to the local oracle. For some datasets, these filters were not sufficient and our recording resulted in a timeout (t/out). For both oracles, we recorded the number of partial orders POs that we built from all unique traces (global 0 to 8K; local 0 to 102). It already becomes apparent that the local oracle discovers less concurrency, i.e. it is more precise at pinpointing concurrency. However, the local oracle scales less towards larger datasets as it had more timeouts than the global oracle (global 2; local 8). The number of unique traces #Unq extracted from the partial orders indicates how many alignments need to be computed to determine the generalization for concurrent patterns (global 0 to 1.8M; local 0 to 907). BPIC12 highlights the problem of the exponential explosion of unique traces with 1.8 million traces. For this dataset, a higher filter should be considered. The number of concurrent patterns #Ps indicates how many concurrent structures are being tested to determine the generalization for concurrency (global 0 to 21K; local 0 to 135). Finally, the weight of concurrent patterns is the sum of all trace counts related to the concurrent patterns (global 0 to 48K; local 0 to 4.5K). Table 2 shows the characteristics of the process models from the qualitative and quantitative evaluation. It reports their size, number of places and transitions as well as the number of choices, i.e. places with multiple outgoing arcs, and parallel structures, i.e. transitions with multiple outgoing arcs. The dataset contains process models of various sizes (21 to 537) to test the generalization measures in different settings. Of particular interest are the number of choices and parallel structures since they correspond to the generalizations that are being tested, i.e. choices may indicate cycles and parallel structures can represent concurrencies. One interesting finding is that Split Miner models rarely include parallel structures, but include some more choices in comparison to the Inductive Miner models.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: As for the datasets, we used the artificial datasets from the AA [ref]5 and NE  papers, in order to showcase the strengths and weaknesses of each generalization measure in a qualitative evaluation.
