      "content": "Paper Title: Statistical Modeling of Soft Error Influence on Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent years have witnessed the widespread adoption of neural networks in various applications . Many of the applications such as autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and robot-assisted surgery are safety-critical as failures in these applications can cause threats to human life and dramatic property loss [ref]21  .\nThe reliability of neural network accelerators that are increasingly utilized for their competitive advantages in terms of performance and energy efficiency   becomes critical to these applications, and must be evaluated and verified comprehensively to ensure the application safety. With the continuously shrinking semiconductor feature sizes and growing transistor density, the influence of soft errors on large-scale chip designs becomes inevitable  . A variety of analysis work have been conducted to investigate the influence of soft errors on neural network execution reliability from distinct angles recently    [ref]35      [ref]12 . For instance, Brandon Reagen et al.  investigated the relationship between fault error rate and model accuracy from the perspective of models, layers, and structures. Guanpeng Li et al.  experimentally evaluated the resilience characteristics of deep neural network systems (i.e., neural network models running on customized accelerators) and particularly studied the influence of data types, values, data reuses, and types of layers on neural network resilience under soft errors, which further inspires two efficient protection techniques against soft errors. Yi He et al. [ref]12 had the major neural network accelerator architectural parameters considered to obtain more accurate fault analysis. Dawen Xu et al.  [ref]35 explored the influence of persistent faults on FPGA-based neural network accelerators with hardware emulation. Despite the efforts, they mainly rely on a large number of fault simulation on either software or FPGAs with limited fault injection configurations. The simulation based analysis is relatively accurate on specific neural network models and fault configurations, but the simulation remains rather limited compared to the entire large design space. Hence, there is still a lack of generality using the simulation based fault analysis. In fact, some of the simulation results may lead to contradictory conclusions. For instance, the experiment results in Ares  demonstrate that the model accuracy of typical neural networks drops sharply when the bit error rate reaches 1√ó10‚àí71superscript1071\\times 10^{-7} while the experiments in  reveal that the model accuracy starts to drop when the bit error rate is larger than 1√ó10‚àí51superscript1051\\times 10^{-5}. In fact, both experiments are correct and the difference is mainly caused by the distinct quantization setups. Although this can be fixed with more comprehensive fault simulations, the total number of fault simulations can increase dramatically given more analysis factors, which will lead to rather expensive simulation overhead accordingly. Hence, more general analysis approaches are demanded to gain sufficient understanding of the influence of soft errors on neural networks. Moreover, the simulation based fault analysis can be extremely time-consuming under real-world applications with large neural networks and datasets, which hinders its use in practice. Take neural network vulnerability analysis that locates the most fragile part of an neural network to facilitate selectively protection against soft errors as an example. Suppose we need to select the most fragile kùëòk layers of a neural network with NùëÅN layers. A straightforward simulation based approach needs to conduct CNksuperscriptsubscriptùê∂ùëÅùëòC_{N}^{k} experiments on the target test dataset. When N=153,K=5formulae-sequenceùëÅ153ùêæ5N=153,K=5, CNk=654045930superscriptsubscriptùê∂ùëÅùëò654045930C_{N}^{k}=654045930. Assume the neural network fault simulation speed is 50 frame per second (fps) and 1000 samples are required for accuracy estimation. The evaluation of a single configuration takes 20s and the full evaluation takes around 420 years, which generally can not be afforded. As a result, many existing solutions  can only adopt heuristic algorithms to address this problem approximately. In order to achieve more efficient fault analysis of soft errors on neural network execution, we develop a statistical model to gain insight of the influence of soft errors on neural network models with much less experiments or even no experiments. The basic idea is to view the soft errors randomly distributed across the neural network processing via statistical analysis and investigate the influence of soft errors on the neural network model accuracy. Specifically, we utilize a normal distribution model to characterize the distribution of the neurons in neural networks according to central limit theorem and analyze the computing error distribution induced by the random soft errors first. On top of the models, we further investigate the influence of neural network depth, quantization, classification complexity on the resilience of neural networks under soft errors. At the same time, we verify the proposed modeling and analysis with fault simulation. Finally, we further leverage the statistical models to accelerate the time-consuming fault simulation by performing fault analysis with intermediate data rather than model accuracy directly. The contributions of this work can be summarized as follows. We propose a series of statistical models to characterize the influence of soft errors on neural network processing for the first time. The models enable relatively general analysis of neural network model resilience under soft errors. We leverage the statistical models to investigate how the major neural network parameters such as quantization, number of layers, and number of classification types affect the neural network resilience, which can be utilized to guide the fault-tolerant neural network design. With the proposed statistical models, we can also accelerate conventional fault simulation of neural network processing under soft errors by almost two orders of magnitude through simplifying the fault injection and replacing model accuracy analysis with more cost-effective intermediate parameter analysis. We validate the proposed model based soft error influence analysis of neural networks and demonstrate significant fault simulation acceleration with comprehensive experiments. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly introduces prior fault analysis of neural network models. Section 3 illustrates the proposed statistical models for neural network reliability analysis under soft errors. Section 4 presents the use of the proposed statistical models to characterize the influence of neural network parameters on neural network resilience over soft errors. Section 5 mainly demonstrates how the proposed statistical models can be utilized to accelerate the fault simulation of neural networks under soft errors. Section 6 concludes this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: such as autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and robot-assisted surgery are safety-critical as failures in these applications can cause threats to human life and dramatic property loss [ref]21  .\nThe reliability of neural network accelerators that are increasingly utilized for their competitive advantages in terms of performance and energy efficiency   becomes critical to these\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
