      "content": "Paper Title: GASP: Gaussian Avatars with Synthetic Priors\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCreating high-quality digital humans unlocks significant potential for many applications, including Virtual Reality, gaming, video conferencing, and entertainment. Digital humans must be photorealistic, easy to capture and capable of real-time rendering. The vision and graphics communities have long worked towards this goal, and we are rapidly approaching the point where such digital humans are possible. A series of works based first on NeRFs  raised the bar in creating exceptional visual quality     [ref]2 . However, NeRFs remain slow to render and are unsuitable for real-time applications. Gaussian Splatting-based works have led to significant improvements in both quality and rendering speed    [ref]4 3  [ref]8. Despite these improvements, the list of suitable applications for these methods is small. Each of these models suffers from one of two drawbacks: either they require expensive capture setups with multiple synchronized cameras, which prevents easy user enrollment   [ref]8, or they train on a single camera but exhibit significant quality degradation when rendered from views with more than a minimal variation in camera pose  3 [ref]4. Furthermore, to maximize visual quality, some of these methods use a large CNN after rendering, which prevents real-time rendering without a powerful GPU [ref]8 . For mass adoption, an avatar model should achieve high-quality 360∘ rendering in real-time and require only the amount of data a user can practically provide. In most cases a user can only capture a monocular, frontal image or video using their webcam or smartphone camera. The problem of fitting an avatar to this data is ill-posed; the extreme sides and back of the head are not visible, leading to artifacts in these unseen regions. In order to overcome this, we require a prior model that is able to “fill in the gaps” left by missing data. Such a model has been shown to be effective in other limited data human-centric models, such as visual dubbing 1 and static NeRF models [ref]2. Ideally, we would train such a model on a large, multi-view, perfectly annotated and diverse dataset. However, very few multi-view face datasets exist. Those that do either lack full coverage, particularly around the back of the head , or have only a small number of subjects 9. Furthermore, annotations such as camera calibrations and 3D morphable model (3DMM) parameters associated with these datasets have to be estimated using imperfect methods and are a significant source of error. We propose GASP: Gaussian Avatars with Synthetic Priors. We use a large, diverse dataset of synthetic humans 8  to overcome the difficulties associated with training a prior on real data. This data is generated using computer graphics and has perfectly accurate annotations, including exact correspondence to the underlying 3DMM. This enables the large-scale training of a prior for Gaussian Avatars for the first time. However, the use of synthetic data introduces a domain gap problem. We address this by learning per-Gaussian features with semantic correlations. By learning these correlations on synthetic data and then maintaining them when fitting to real data, using a three-stage fitting process, we can cross this domain gap. Our method even enables rendering the back of the head, having fit to only a single front-facing image or video; see Fig. 1. To summarize, we propose a novel system for creating realistic, real-time animatable avatars from a webcam or smartphone enabled by the following contributions: A prior model over Gaussian Avatar parameters trained using purely synthetic data. A three-stage fitting process, combined with learned per-Gaussian correlations to overcome the synthetic-to-real domain gap and allow for 360∘ rendering. Real-time rendering enabled through use of neural networks only during training and fitting, and not at inference time.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: towards this goal, and we are rapidly approaching the point where such digital humans are possible.
