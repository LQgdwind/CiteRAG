      "content": "Paper Title: Mira: Cracking Black-box Watermarking on Deep Neural Networks via Model Inversion-based Removal Attacks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n∙∙\\bullet Model Watermarks.\nDigital watermarking is originally designed for protecting the copyright of digital media  and recently applied to protect the intellectual property of DNN models.\nA white-box watermarking scheme typically embeds a sequence of secret messages into the parameters or neural activations of the target model, and thus requires white-box access of the suspect model to extract the watermark 8   .\nOn the contrary, a black-box watermark is embedded in the model’s prediction behavior on a set of specially-crafted secret samples. Therefore, the verification process of black-box watermarking only requires the access to the prediction API [ref]3   .\nIn this work, we mainly focus on the robustness of black-box watermarks due to their increasing popularity in industry. Existing black-box watermark schemes have diverse designs in the choices of the watermark data and the target label. In terms of watermark data, some work leverages specially-crafted patterns   or random noise  as watermark patterns.\nOther black-box watermarks may use out-of-distribution samples as watermark data [ref]3 .\nBesides, in-distribution clean samples , adversarial samples near the decision boundary  or images generated by an encoder with exclusive logo embedded indistinguishably [ref]36 can also be exploited as watermark data.\nIn terms of the target label setting, existing black-box DNN watermarks can be categorized into fixed-class watermarks, where all the watermark data are paired with the identical target class (such as   ),\nand non-fixed-class watermarks, where each watermark data is paired with its own target class (such as [ref]3   [ref]36 ). To build a trustworthy ownership verification process, an ideal watermarking scheme should satisfy the following three key requirements  .\n(1) Fidelity. The performance degradation on the target model should be as low as possible after the watermark is embedded.\n(2) Integrity. Models which are trained independently without access to the target model should not be verified as containing the watermark.\n(3) Robustness. The embedded watermark in the target model should be resistant to potential removal attacks. In the extreme settings when the watermark is removed, the utility of the model should decrease dramatically. ∙∙\\bullet Watermark Removal Attacks.\nBlack-box model watermarks are to some extent similar to backdoor attacks, as they both establish connections between some specified data and the target labels.\nTherefore, classical methods in backdoor defense, such as pruning, finetuning or trigger reverse-engineering, are usually considered as potential threats for black-box watermarks [ref]3  .\nRecently, some attacks specially targeting black-box watermarks are also proposed. According to Wang et al. , existing watermark removal attacks are mainly categorized into three types as follows. Pruning-based Attacks: They prune the redundant weights 8 or neurons  in DNNs.\nHowever, to invalidate the underlying watermarks, these methods need to prune a large proportion of weights or neurons, which causes an unacceptable utility loss. Finetuning-based Attacks: They continue to train the target model for a few epochs with some carefully designed finetuning techniques, such as learning rate schedule  , dataset augmentation , weight regularization , or continue learning with attention distraction .\nUnfortunately, these attacks are usually effective only against a subset of watermarks, and might hamper the model’s utility due to the heavy training restrictions. Unlearning-based Attacks: They are mainly designed for black-box watermarks whose watermark data have the fixed pattern and the identical target class  .\nSpecifically, they use conventional backdoor trigger reverse-engineering techniques in e.g., NeuralCleanse , which poses rather strong assumptions on the forms of underlying watermarks and are therefore not watermark-agnostic.\nAlso, current unlearning-based attacks all need access to source training data, which further limits their applicable scenarios. Table 2 summarizes the pros-and-cons of attacks from each category. Note that there also exists another type of attacks aiming at training a new surrogate model using the knowledge transferred from the given watermarked model, i.e., model extraction attacks   .\nHowever, extraction attacks typically requires large query dataset and entails heavy computation costs . Therefore, our current work is not compared with extraction attacks. Our work focuses on the vulnerabilities revealed by model inversion.\nNote that this has also been studied by Zhang et al. .\nHowever, they used a rather naive inversion method from  and only presented the visually-meaningless inverted samples.\nNeither have they delved into the neuron coverage between the inverted samples and the real watermark samples, nor attempted to unlearn the inverted ones for watermark removal.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: embedded in the model’s prediction behavior on a set of specially-crafted secret samples. Therefore, the verification process of black-box watermarking only requires the access to the prediction API [ref]3   .\nIn this work, we mainly focus on the robustness of black-box watermarks due to their increasing popularity in industry.
