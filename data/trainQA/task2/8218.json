      "content": "Paper Title: SoK: Software Compartmentalization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAll abstractions in Table II enforce integrity, a\nprerequisite for other properties (§2.1).\nMost target confidentiality, and some target availability, runtime\nre-compartmentalization, or interface safety. Confidentiality. Since nearly all abstractions provide\nconfidentiality, we focus on the impact of not doing so. Not providing\nconfidentiality does not cause structural changes in abstractions [ref]35.\nIt may benefit performance, as it enables zero-cost read-only data\nsharing, i.e., fewer copies at compartment boundaries. It also simplifies\nseparation: only write-shared data require explicit sharing. On the downside,\nnot providing confidentiality vastly reduces the abstraction’s ability\nto counter information leakages: the only remaining barrier is the\ncompartments’ ability to limit data exfiltration vectors. It may also be\ndetrimental from an interface-safety viewpoint, defeating randomization\n(thus easing cross-compartment exploits). Lastly, avoiding copies at\nboundaries may make the system more prone to shared-memory\nTOCTOU [ref]160. Overall, except for legitimate integrity-only\nuse-cases (e.g., shadow-stack protection ), giving up\nconfidentiality trades security for performance and compatibility. Availability.  Abstractions may go beyond\nfault isolation and target cross-compartment fault tolerance. This brings many\nwell-known challenges from the fault-tolerance and distributed systems\nfields : e.g., avoiding, detecting, recovering from resource\nexhaustion, and from various failures (omission, Byzantine).\nParticularly relevant to compartmentalization are resource ownership\nproblems  (when restarting a domain, can shared resources\nbe released?), and state coherence issues  (the state of\nrestarted domains may be incoherent with that of other components), as\ncompartmentalized components, particularly when retrofitting, are typically\nless encapsulated [ref]160. Overall, availability differs from\nproperties such as integrity and confidentiality in that it is a property of\nthe whole system, not a compartment-local property: to achieve availability\nwith compartmentalization, the interaction (and failure) of all domains\nmust be considered at once, instead of separately. To tackle these challenges, abstractions take a vast variety of approaches,\nwhose exhaustive listing outreaches the scope of this paper: bounded execution\nin resources  or time  , and\ngenerally performance isolation  to tackle resource exhaustion;\nleveraging type systems for resource ownership ; proposing\nmanually-designed interface wrappers  ,\nper-component fault-handlers , careful TCB and interface designs\nto store state outside of domains , or recursive restarting\nof relevant components  for state coherence. Because the problem\nis hard, all require expert understanding of fault domains, rely on a\nvariable amount of manual engineering, and not all approaches are complete;\ne.g., Google SAPI  automatically re-iterates failed\ncalls and restarts faulty components, but does not consider state coherence\nproblems. Runtime Re-Compartmentalization. Some abstractions also\nsupport changing the policy enforced at runtime   , e.g., to adapt policies to evolving requirements in\nperformance and fault isolation. Beyond technical challenges of achieving\ntransparent, fast re-compartmentalization, we observe that this poses\nnon-trivial security challenges in adversarial contexts: assuming attackers can\nwait for the weakest fault-isolation profile to be instantiated, or influence\nworkloads to trigger such profiles (e.g., generate more, or different network\ntraffic), then the overall security properties are that of the weakest\nprofile achievable at any point in time. This may be true even when attackers\ncannot wait; since component states are preserved across policy changes, any\nundetected corruption triggered by an attacker during a “strong” profile will\neventually reach other components when weaker profiles trigger, similar to\ndelay attacks . This limits applications of\nre-compartmentalization to non-adversarial scenarios. Compartment-Interface Hardening.\nAlthough interface safety is a key problem of\ncompartmentalization, most abstractions consider it orthogonal to their mission\n(Table II). Works often transfer the responsibility to\nPDMs by assuming a safe separation policy, or to downstream developers by\nassuming hardened components. Yet, though the purpose of compartmentalization\nabstractions is not to help users defining security policies (this is the role\nof PDMs), they can contribute to interface safety by making it harder to\nimplement unsafe policies, thus ensuring that compartment interfaces are free\nof certain classes of confused deputies. They may do so at various levels, e.g., by enforcing restrictions on interface definitions, such as restricting\ninterface-crossing types   or enforcing points-to\nranges for interface-crossing pointers     ; by forcing the presence of checks on interface-crossing\ndata, forcing users to write checks , or checking\nautomatically when possible   ; or by\nenforcing restrictions on cross-compartment control-flow, providing\nprimitives to specify and enforce API call ordering , and\nenforcing additional properties such as CC-CFI to raise the bar\nfor cross-compartment attacks [ref]211 . These\nmeasures are not orthogonal to the core mission of compartmentalization\nabstractions, as they generally cannot be implemented independently: without\nknowledge of compartments mappings, it may be impossible to verify\npointers and indexes; to check reference types or call ordering; to implement\nCC-CFI; etc. Lefeuvre [ref]160 and\nHu  provide deeper coverage of the topic of interface safety in\ncompartmentalization.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: Confidentiality. Since nearly all abstractions provide\nconfidentiality, we focus on the impact of not doing so. Not providing\nconfidentiality does not cause structural changes in abstractions [ref]35.\nIt may benefit performance, as it enables zero-cost read-only data\nsharing, i.e., fewer copies at compartment boundaries.
