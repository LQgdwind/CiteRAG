Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: Clifford Circuits can be Properly PAC Learned if and only if \"RP\"=\"NP\"\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe also note that we are dealing with the problem of classically PAC learning a classical function (i.e., classical labels) derived from a quantum system. This is as opposed to quantum PAC learning of a classical function as in Arunachalam and de Wolf [ref]6, Arunachalam and de¬†Wolf [ref]7, Arunachalam et¬†al. , Quek et¬†al. [ref]43 where instead of a distribution over samples we receive access to copies of a quantum state. This state results in the same distribution classically when measured in the computational basis but can be measured in other basis to get different results. There is also the attempt to directly learn a quantum process with quantum labels, as in Chung and Lin , Caro . Here, they do not choose to measure the output state, and have samples of the form (œÅ,‚Ñ≥‚Äã(œÅ))ùúå‚Ñ≥ùúå(\\rho,\\mathcal{M}(\\rho)) for quantum process ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M}. Other related quantum learning works, some of which are outside the PAC model, include Yoganathan , Low , Cheng et¬†al. .\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: classically PAC learning a classical function (i.e., classical labels) derived from a quantum system.
