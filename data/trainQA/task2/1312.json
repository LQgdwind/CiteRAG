      "content": "Paper Title: GNN-XML: Graph Neural Networks for Extreme Multi-label Text Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExtreme multi-label text classification (XMTC) aims to assign to each given text its most relevant subset of labels from an extremely large label set, where the number of labels could reach millions or more. Recently, XMTC has attracted increasing attention due to the rapid growth of web-scale data in many applications, such as news annotation, web page tagging , product categorization for e-commerce, Bing’s dynamic search advertising   , to name a few. XMTC poses great computational challenges for developing effective and efficient classifiers due to the extreme number of labels. The huge label space has raised research challenges such as data sparsity and scalability. Figure 1 demonstrates an example of the long-tailed label distribution in the Wiki10-31K dataset , where a large fraction of labels have very few positive training instances, namely tail labels. A variety of approaches have been proposed to address the challenges of scalability and label sparsity in the XMTC problems. Despite One-vs-All (OVA) approaches   that generally achieve strong performance, they suffer from scalability issues. Following a divide-and-conquer paradigm, tree-based methods  3 scale to large label sets in XMTC by hierarchically partitioning the instance or label space. However, they are prone to error propagation in the tree cascade and tend to perform inferiorly on tail labels prediction . Label-embedding methods   reduce the label space by projecting label vectors onto a low-dimensional space based on the assumption that the label matrix is low-rank. Nevertheless, such assumption is violated in real world applications owing to the presence of tail labels  5 1. We refer the readers to Sup. A for details of these approaches. Deep learning models benefiting from their powerful text representation capabilities have also been explored for the XMTC problems 0 2 [ref]5. XML-CNN 0 first applies a dynamic max-pooling scheme and a family of CNN models to learn text representations. AttentionXML 2 uses the attentional bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks to extract embeddings from raw text inputs. X-BERT [ref]5 first incorporates the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT ) for XMTC. Despite the empirical success of these methods, there are still some concerns required to be addressed. For example, the CNN-based models cannot capture the most relevant parts of the input to each label, the RNN-based methods fail to model long-term dependencies due to vanishing gradients. X-BERT simply uses truncation techniques to process the text with a length larger than 512, which may discard the crucial information for classification. As shown in Fig. 1, 83.8% of the training instances have more than 512 words. In addition, the difficulty of scaling to the extreme label space remains in deep learning methods as the output layer scales linearly with the product of label size and feature dimension [ref]5. Data sparsity among tail labels also makes the instance volume much lower than that required by deep models to reach peak performance 4. In this paper, we propose GNN-XML, a scalable graph neural network framework tailored for the XMTC problem. In a nutshell, we achieve the scalability by partitioning the enormous number of labels into smaller number of clusters with a novel label partitioning method. By parsing each input document into a keyword graph, we utilize the graph isomorphism network (GIN) to fully explore the deep semantic context information and learn robust representations for matching input text to a small set of label clusters. We further propose the bilateral-balancing branch learning to gradually place more emphasis on tail labels. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We exploit the correlations between labels via mining their co-occurrence patterns within the dataset and build a label graph based on the correlation matrix. We conduct the attributed graph clustering with a low-pass graph filter to jointly model node/label connectivity and node/label features, which induces dependency-aware and semantic-aware label clusters. The KeyGraph building schema allows flexible integration of various pre-trained language representation models, such as BERT and its variants, which endows GNN-XML with powerful text representational capabilities. We propose an end-to-end bilateral-branch graph isomorphism network to decouple representation learning and classifier learning for tail labels. Ablation studies are performed to demonstrate the significance and effectiveness of reasoning and mining tail labels.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: We refer the readers to Sup. A for details of these approaches.
