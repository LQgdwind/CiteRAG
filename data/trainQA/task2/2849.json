      "content": "Paper Title: SSSNET: Semi-Supervised Signed Network Clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn social network analysis,\nsigned network clustering is an important task which standard community detection algorithms do not address .\nSigns of edges in networks may indicate positive or negative sentiments, see for example\n[ref]43.\nAs an illustration, review websites as well as online news allow users to approve or denounce others .\nClustering time series can be viewed as an instance of signed network clustering ,\nwith the empirical correlation matrix being construed as a weighted signed network.\nFor recommendation systems,\n[ref]47 introduced a principled approach to capturing local and global information from signed social networks mathematically, and proposed a novel recommendation framework.\nRecently interest has grown on the topic of polarization in social media, mainly fueled by a large variety of speeches and statements made in the pursuit of public good, and their impact on the integrity of democratic processes ; our work also contributes to the growing literature of polarization in signed networks. Most competitive state-of-the-art methods\ngenerating node embeddings for signed networks\nfocus on link sign prediction  1     7, and those that pertain to node clustering are\nnot GNN methods    2 4. Here,\nwe introduce a graph neural network (GNN) framework, called SSSNET, with a\nSigned Mixed-Path Aggregation (SIMPA) scheme, to obtain node embeddings for signed clustering. The main novelty of our approach is a new take on the role of social balance theory for signed network embeddings. The standard\nheuristic for justifying the criteria for the embeddings  0 7    hinges on\nsocial balance theory  , or multiplicative distrust propagation as in [ref]20, which asserts that in a social network, in a triangle either all three nodes are friends, or two friends have a common enemy; otherwise it would be viewed as unbalanced. More generally, all cycles are assumed to prefer to contain either zero or an even number of negative edges. This hypothesis\nis difficult to justify for general signed networks.\nFor example, the enemies of enemies are not necessarily friends, see [ref]20 ; an example is given by\nthe social network of relations between 16 tribes in\nNew Guinea\n.\nHence, the present work takes a neutral stance on whether or not the enemy of an enemy is a friend, thus generalizing the\natomic propagation by [ref]20. From a method’s viewpoint, the neutral stance is reflected in the feature aggregation in SIMPA, which provides the basis of the network embedding. Network clustering is then carried out using the node embedding as input and a loss function for training; see Figure 1 for an overview.\nTo train SSSNET,\nthe loss function consists of a self-supervised\nnovel probabilistic balanced normalized cut loss acting on all training nodes, and a supervised loss which acts on seed nodes, if available. Experimental results at different scales demonstrate that our method\nachieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on synthetic data, for a wide range of network densities, while complementing other methods through the possibility of incorporating exogenous information. Tested on real-world data for which ground truth is available,\nour method outperforms its competitors in terms of the\nAdjusted Rand Index . Main contributions. Our main contributions are as follows:\n ∙∙\\bullet (1) An efficient end-to-end\nGNN for semi-supervised signed node clustering,\nbased on a new variant of social balance theory.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first GNN-based method deriving node embeddings for clustering signed networks, potentially with attributes.\nThe advantage of the ability to handle features is that we can incorporate eigen-features of other methods (such as eigenvectors of the signed Laplacian), thus borrowing strength from existing methods.\n ∙∙\\bullet (2)\nA Signed Mixed-Path Aggregation (SIMPA) framework based\non our new take on social balance theory.\n ∙∙\\bullet (3) A\nprobabilistic version of balanced normalized cut to serve as a self-supervised loss function for signed clustering.\n ∙∙\\bullet (4) We achieve state-of-the-art performance on various signed clustering tasks, including a challenging version of a classification task, for which we customize and adapt a general definition of polarized signed stochastic block models (Pol-SSBM), to include an ambient cluster and multiple polarized SSBM communities, not necessarily of equal size, but of equal density.\nCode and preprocessed data are available at https://github.com/SherylHYX/SSSNET_Signed_Clustering. An alternative implementation is available in the open-source library PyTorch Geometric Signed Directed .\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: network clustering is an important task which standard community detection algorithms do not address .\nSigns of edges in networks may indicate positive or negative sentiments, see for example\n[ref]43.\nAs an illustration, review websites as well as online news allow users to approve or denounce others .\nClustering time series can be viewed as an instance of signed network clustering ,\nwith\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
