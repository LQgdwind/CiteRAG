      "content": "Paper Title: Emerging Threats in Deep Learning-Based Autonomous Driving: A Comprehensive Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nArtificial intelligence models are often generated from a certain amount of training data. Some scholars have found that if the training data is not trustworthy, it may lead to the generation of models with \"backdoor\", which can be manipulated by attackers in the subsequent use of the models, causing serious security risks. Currently, the concepts of \"AI backdoor\", \"AI model poisoning\" and \"AI Trojan horse\" have some similarities, but are not expressed in the same way in different literature. One type of attack is called Training-only attacks, or Poisoning Attacks are usually defined as attacker contaminating part of the training data or modifying the labels of the training data. On the contrary, another type of attack is called Backdoor Attacks or AI Trojans, in which attackers must participate in both training and testing. Both poisoning attacks and AI backdoor attacks can cause serious security threats to autonomous driving system, and this paper refers to these two types of attacks as \"AI backdoor attacks\", where a specific malicious modification is made to a target model in a specific way, causing the model to make harmful judgments about a specifically predicted example. There are similarities and differences between backdoor attacks and adversarial example attacks. Adversarial examples usually do not change the model itself and will not damage the integrity of the AI model, but mainly interfere with the test examples and affect the availability and correctness of the machine learning model. On another hand, AI backdoor takes the form of modification of the AI model, poison of the training data, aggregation of the backdoor model, etc., causing tiny changes to the AI model, affecting both the integrity of the AI model. AI backdoor attacks tend to be more hidden, highly universal, and more damaging. So far, there are two major methods to implement AI backdoor, one is Data Poisoning Attack, and the other is Model Poisoning Attack. Data Poisoning Attack means attacker adds a small amount of poisoning data into training dataset, so that the resulting AI model has a backdoor, and the AI model may make a specific judgement when the predicted example contains a \"trigger\". Model Poisoning Attack means the attacker directly modifies the model or indirectly fuses the target model with a harmful model by using model integration, federated learning, and transition learning, causing the model to make a directed and erroneous judgment on a specific prediction example. It has been argued that AI backdoor attacks already exist in traditional machine learning. In 2008, Nelson et al.   proposed the backdoor attack on Bayesian networks. In 2012 Biggio et al. proposed backdoor attack on SVMs. In 2016, Alfeld et al.[ref]151 proposed backdoor on auto-regressive prediction models. In 2017, Gu et al.[ref]3 first proposed backdoor attack on deep learning, then AI backdoor became a promising research topic. The BadNet algorithm adds a small number of training data with the pre-designed pattern into the training data and labels such training examples with a specific target, then the trained model is likely to predict examples with \"Trigger\" according to the attacker. In the same year, Muñoz-González et al. proposed a gradient-based algorithm for AI data poisoning. However, for autonomous driving system, the basic AI backdoor algorithms described above have two limitations. Control right of training data by attacker.As it requires the attacker to be able to contaminate a certain amount of training data, this requires the attacker to have some control over the training data; at the very least the attacker needs to have background knowledge of the target model’s structure, parameters, etc., which places certain requirements on the attacker. Concealment of attack. It relies on contaminating part of the training data by adding a ’pattern’ or changing the label of the data. Although the pattern may be relatively insidious, forcing patterns into normal examples may cause a certain amount of unnaturalness that may be detected by humans, or possibly by automated detection through some anomaly identification method. It may also lead to human feel a sense of inharmonious if the attacker modifies excessive label of the training data. In response to these limitations, researchers have made a number of subsequent improvements. On the one hand, attackers have improved the concealment of poisoning attacks by enhancing the concealment of the patterns in the example or minimizing the impact on the integrity of the label. One of the research directions is \"clean label\", which aims to keep the label of poisoned example semantically correct while realizing data poisoning. In 2018, Shafahi et al. proposed the Poison Frogs algorithm, which was the first to implement the Clean Label attack for deep learning. In the same year, Truner et al. proposed two methods of data generation based on adversarial network and adversarial example to achieve a label-consistent \"clean example\" attack. Another research direction is \"Hidden Trigger\", also known as \"Invisible Trigger\", which aims to optimize the trigger pattern to make it as invisible as possible to escape detection by humans and machines. In 2018, Suciu et al. , and in 2019 Saha et al. put forward \"hidden trigger\" which can generate trigger patterns that humans are unable to directly perceive through the senses. In 2020, Wallace et al. devised a \"hidden trigger\" poisoning attack in the field of natural language processing. In the same year, Li et al. used information hiding and regularization methods to improve the bad net algorithm to improve the invisibility of the trigger pattern. On the other hand, the attacker reduces the proportion of contaminated training data as much as possible, or even implements a black-box attack that does not require contaminating data, thus reducing the background knowledge required for the attack and lowering the threshold for implementing the attack. In 2017, Liu et al.  implemented a black-box approach to generate backdoor by exploiting the migratory nature of the attack, but such backdoor mainly exists in the fully connected layer at the end of the AI model, which can easily fail once the model is fine-tuned; in the same year, Chen et al. proposed a machine learning-based approach to generate AI backdoor, which eliminates the need for attackers to understand the structure of the target system and other information, and reduces the background knowledge requirement; in 2019, Yao et al.[ref]160 proposed \"latent triggers\", which are first generated in the \"teacher model\" and then migrated to the \"student model\" through transition learning. The backdoor is not only found in the last fully connected layer of the student model, but also in all of its layers and thus the difficulty of detecting the \"backdoor\" through analysis is increased. In the same year, Zhu et al. investigated the migratory nature of clean label attacks and used knowledge transition to realize a black-box clean label attack. In the field of autonomous driving, in 2018, Liu et al. realized AI backdoor attacks in a variety of environments, including simulated autonomous driving platforms. In 2019, Rehman et al. implemented an AI backdoor attack on traffic signs in the physical world; Barni et al. conducted a clean label poisoning attack on traffic signs; Ding et al. from Nanjing University designed a \"natural trigger\" for autonomous driving system to trigger AI model backdoor in special weather like a rainy day, to make red lights incorrectly identified as green lights and numbers incorrectly identified in a specific way; Yao et al.[ref]160 from the University of Chicago used their proposed \"latent trigger\" method to generate backdoor traffic signs for a variety of models, generating human-imperceptible triggers on physical traffic signs. In 2021, Tian et al. achieved a clean label attack on 3D cloud point map. In 2022, Udeshi et al. proposed an anti-backdoor attack method that can be used in traffic sign recognition scenarios, which achieved avoiding AI backdoor attacks by filtering the triggers in the captured images and correcting the prediction examples. Algorithm 9. Feature Collisions Feature collision is the more common method of AI backdoor generation, where the attacker first selects a target instance from the test set. To achieve poisoning, the attacker chooses a base class instance from the base class and makes imperceptible changes to it, thereby generating a poisoned instance that is injected into the training data later; then, during the training phase, the model is trained using a poisoned data set consisting of a clean data set plus poisoned instance; in the reasoning phase, this causes the target instance to be mistaken by the misclassification model for being in the base class during testing. It is described formally as follows. f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x) represents the neural network’s prediction on input example x𝑥x. Example x𝑥x colliding with the target is found in the feature space and then computed to be close to the base instance b𝑏b. The target function is p𝑝p is the poisoning instance, which will be misdirected as the attack target.\n\nReference markers found: [151]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]151: exist in traditional machine learning.
