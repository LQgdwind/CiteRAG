      "content": "Paper Title: Minimum Weight Euclidean (1+\"ERROR \\eps\")-SpannersA preliminary version of this paper appears in the Proceedings of the 48th International Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science (WG), LNCS, Springer, 2022.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany algorithms have been developed for constructing Euclidean (1+\\eps)1\\eps(1+\\eps)-spanners for n𝑛n points in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}  4 7 8 9      , each designed for one or more optimization criteria (such as lightness, sparsity, hop diameter, maximum degree, or running time). See    for comprehensive surveys. We briefly review previous constructions pertaining to the minimum weight for n𝑛n points in the unit cube [ref]0 dsuperscript01𝑑[ref]0 ^{d},\nwhere the weight of an EMST is O​(n1−1/d)𝑂superscript𝑛11𝑑O(n^{1-1/d}). The path-greedy spanner algorithm  (abbreviated as “greedy”) generalizes Kruskal’s MST algorithm: Given \\eps>0\\eps0\\eps>0 and n𝑛n points in a metric space, it sorts the (n2)binomial𝑛2{n\\choose 2} edges of the complete graph Knsubscript𝐾𝑛K_{n} on the n𝑛n points by nondecreasing weight, and incrementally constructs a spanner H𝐻H starting from the empty graph; it adds an edge u​v𝑢𝑣uv to the spanner if H𝐻H does not already contain an u​v𝑢𝑣uv-path of weight at most (1+\\eps)​‖u​v‖1\\epsnorm𝑢𝑣(1+\\eps)\\|uv\\|.\nAs noted above, Le and Solomon 0 recently proved that for n𝑛n points in the unit cube, the greedy algorithm returns a (1+\\eps)1\\eps(1+\\eps)-spanner of weight O​(\\eps−d​log⁡\\eps−1⋅n1−1/d)𝑂superscript\\eps𝑑⋅superscript\\eps1superscript𝑛11𝑑O(\\eps^{-d}\\log\\eps^{-1}\\cdot n^{1-1/d}). This bound is weaker than Theorem 1 for n𝑛n points arranged in a grid, for example, but it is unclear whether the analysis of the greedy spanner can be improved to match the tight bound in Theorem 1. A classical method for constructing a (1+\\eps)1\\eps(1+\\eps)-spanners uses well-separated pair decompositions (WSPD) with a hierarchical clustering; see [33, Chap. 3]. Due to a hierarchy of depth Θ​(log⁡n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(\\log n), this technique has been adapted broadly to dynamic, kinetic, and reliable spanners 3 4 [ref]29 . However, the weight of the resulting (1+\\eps)1\\eps(1+\\eps)-spanner for n𝑛n points in [ref]0 dsuperscript01𝑑[ref]0 ^{d} is O​(\\eps−(d+1)⋅n1−1/d⋅log⁡n)𝑂⋅superscript\\eps𝑑1superscript𝑛11𝑑𝑛O(\\eps^{-(d+1)}\\cdot n^{1-1/d}\\cdot\\log n) [ref]29. The O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) factor is due to the depth of the hierarchy; and it cannot be removed for any spanner with hop-diameter O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n)   . Several constructions for (1+\\eps)1\\eps(1+\\eps)-spanners combine hierarchical clustering with a greedy approach 8  (either using approximate distances or running a greedy algorithm on a hierarchical spanner). These “approximate” greedy spanners achieve lightness \\eps−O​(d)superscript\\eps𝑂𝑑\\eps^{-O(d)} in Euclidean d𝑑d-space, hence weight \\eps−O​(d)⋅n1−1/d⋅superscript\\eps𝑂𝑑superscript𝑛11𝑑\\eps^{-O(d)}\\cdot n^{1-1/d} for n𝑛n points in [ref]0 dsuperscript01𝑑[ref]0 ^{d}. They have been generalized to doubling metrics with the same lightness bound 0  . Yao-graphs and ΘΘ\\Theta-graphs are geometric proximity graphs, defined in the plane as follows. For a constant k≥3𝑘3k\\geq 3, consider k𝑘k cones of aperture 2​π/k2𝜋𝑘2\\pi/k around each point p∈S𝑝𝑆p\\in S; in each cone, connect p𝑝p to a “closest” point q∈S𝑞𝑆q\\in S. The two graphs (Yao-graphs and ΘΘ\\Theta-graphs) differ in the metric used for measuring the distance from p𝑝p to q𝑞q: For Yao-graphs, q𝑞q minimizes the Euclidean distance ‖p​q‖norm𝑝𝑞\\|pq\\| from p𝑝p to p𝑝p, and for ΘΘ\\Theta-graphs q𝑞q minimizes the distance from p𝑝p to the orthogonal projection of q𝑞q to the angle bisector of the cone.\nBoth constructions generalize to ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, for all d≥2𝑑2d\\geq 2, where the number of cones is Od​(k1−d)subscript𝑂𝑑superscript𝑘1𝑑O_{d}(k^{1-d}).\nFor ΘΘ\\Theta-graphs, the computation of closest points reduces to orthogonal range searching queries (rather than circular disk ranges for Yao-graphs), and a ΘΘ\\Theta-graph for n𝑛n points in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} can be computed in Od​(n​k1−d​logd−1⁡n)subscript𝑂𝑑𝑛superscript𝑘1𝑑superscript𝑑1𝑛O_{d}(nk^{1-d}\\log^{d-1}n) time [45, Sec. 5.5].\nBoth ΘΘ\\Theta- and Yao-graphs are (1+\\eps)1\\eps(1+\\eps)-spanners if k∈Θ​(\\eps−1)𝑘Θsuperscript\\eps1k\\in\\Theta(\\eps^{-1}), and this bound cannot be improved  7  . Finding the optimal constant factors hidden in the notation Θ​(\\eps−1)Θsuperscript\\eps1\\Theta(\\eps^{-1}) is an active area of research    1 2. However, if we place ⌊n/2⌋𝑛2\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor and ⌈n/2⌉𝑛2\\lceil n/2\\rceil equally spaced points on opposite sides of the unit square, then the weight of both Yao- and ΘΘ\\Theta-graphs with parameter k=Θ​(\\eps−1)𝑘Θsuperscript\\eps1k=\\Theta(\\eps^{-1}) will be Θ​(\\eps−1​n)Θsuperscript\\eps1𝑛\\Theta(\\eps^{-1}\\,n), which substantially exceeds the bound in Theorem 1 for any fixed \\eps>0\\eps0\\eps>0 as n→∞→𝑛n\\rightarrow\\infty. Optimizing various parameters of Euclidean spanners on the integer lattice is a natural problem. Previous work determined the minimum stretch factor in terms of the maximum degree ΔΔ\\Delta for small values of ΔΔ\\Delta. There exist Euclidean (1+2)12(1+\\sqrt{2})-spanners for ℤ2superscriptℤ2\\mathbb{Z}^{2} with maximum degree Δ=3Δ3\\Delta=3, and 22\\sqrt{2}-spanners with Δ=4Δ4\\Delta=4; and these bounds are the best possible  .\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: sparsity, hop diameter, maximum degree, or running time).
