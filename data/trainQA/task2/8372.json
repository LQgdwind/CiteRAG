Transformers represent a class of neural networks that process inputs as sequences of tokens, leveraging a multi-head attention mechanism to capture global relationships within these tokens [ref]37.\nIn this case, the programs are represented as a sequence of tokens and the output bug location (lùëôl) corresponds to the token that causes the bug. While it is possible to train transformers from scratch with randomly initialized weights, they are typically pre-trained on extensive data corpora and subsequently fine-tuned for specific tasks. These pre-trained models are known as pre-trained language models. This paper focuses on encoder-only language models as they are predominantly used in fine-tuning for classification problems¬†[ref]38. Specifically, in our experiments, we use CodeBERT , GraphCodeBERT , and UnixCoder¬†, all of which are pre-trained models specialized in source code. Graph neural networks (GNNs) process graphs with both structural and feature information .\nHence, the programs are depicted as program graphs¬†[ref]14, encompassing details concerning control flows (e.g., branching and loops) and data flows (e.g., last read and last write of a variable). Consequently, the output bug location (lùëôl) corresponds to the node representing the token responsible for the bug. The most frequently used GNNs for bug detection are gated graph neural networks (GGNN)¬†[ref]14 which use a gated recurrent unit (GRU)  to perform the neighbor aggregation¬†. Hybrid approaches\ncombine both transformer and graph neural network approaches. In our study, we explore the Graph-Relational Embedding Attention Transformer (GREAT) architecture proposed by Hellendoorn et al.¬†. GREAT harnesses the capabilities of both transformers and GNNs by enhancing the attention mechanism with biases for different relationship types. The central concept behind GREAT is incorporating edge information into the transformer architecture by using a relation type bias term in the attention computation.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: Transformers represent a class of neural networks that process inputs as sequences of tokens, leveraging a multi-head attention mechanism to capture global relationships within these tokens [ref]37.\nIn this case, the programs are represented as a sequence of tokens and the output bug location (lùëôl) corresponds to the token that causes the bug.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
