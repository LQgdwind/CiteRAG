      "content": "Paper Title: Neighborhood Contrastive Learning for Novel Class Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNovel Class Discovery is a relatively new task that aims to classify the samples in the unlabeled set into different semantic categories. It is different from unsupervised clustering in that one has a labeled set which has completely different classes from the unlabeled set. Typical novel class discovery methods first train a model on the labeled data and use it as an initialization for performing unsupervised clustering on the unlabeled data.\nThe works¬†  in this category utilize the labeled data to train a binary classification model by exploiting the pair-wise similarity of images and then use this trained binary classification model as a supervision for clustering on the unlabeled data. Similarly,  pretrains the model on the labeled data, followed by an end-to-end clustering technique¬†2 on the unlabeled data. Deviating from this two-stage training strategy, Han et. al.¬† propose to leverage labeled data while performing unsupervised clustering on the unlabeled data. Our proposed NCL also builds on the premise of leveraging labeled data in the unsupervised clustering phase. However, in contrast to¬†, NCL uses labeled data not to maintain the basic discrimination of representation, but to aid the contrastive learning process by generating more informative negatives. Unsupervised Clustering is the task to partition an unlabeled dataset into different semantic categories, where the prior knowledge of a labeled set is not available. To this end, many shallow¬†   and deep learning based methods¬†[ref]6    2   have been proposed. The deep learning based methods can be roughly categorized into two kinds where the first kind exploits pairwise similarity of the samples to generate pseudo-labels for clustering¬†[ref]6  . Whereas, the second kind¬†  uses neighborhood aggregation of feature embedding to bring closer the similar instances and simultaneously pushing away the dissimilar instances, thereby achieving a clustering effect. Our method also draws inspiration from these two lines of works. Of notable interest to our work,  uses a non-deterministic k-means algorithm to find a local neighborhood within an iterative optimization process, which however is sensitive to initialization and also computationally expensive.\nInstead, this paper proposes to adopt an end-to-end clustering technique via the use of pairwise similarity of samples and directly explore neighborhood by kùëòk-nearest neighbors, which makes our method much simpler while still retaining the benefits of neighborhood aggregation. Contrastive Learning is an unsupervised feature representation learning technique that has gained significant momentum in the recent years. The crux of contrastive learning based methods¬†  1 4  1 lies in computing a similarity between an input and its correlated view, instead of a fixed target (e.g., one-hot label). Due to the close association between unsupervised learning and NCD, we adopt the contrastive loss¬†1 formulation to harness its power for learning discriminative representations. However, different from the above methods, the contrastive loss formulation in NCL exploits both the labeled data and the unlabeled data into one holistic framework, which is well suited for the NCD task. Moreover, in NCL we propose to amalgamate contrastive learning with neighborhood aggregation by considering kùëòk-nearest neighbors as pseudo-positives, making our formulation unique in the NCD literature. Negative Mining plays a crucial role in contrastive learning because the success of the contrastive loss is pivoted on the presence of useful negatives¬†4. Aside from maintaining a large batch size¬† or a large queue¬†4 for having ample useful negatives, one can draw inspirations from the semi-supervised learning literature and naturally consider using mixup strategy in the pixel space¬†5 or the latent space¬†0 to generate harder negatives¬†8 . We, therefore, capitalize on the fact that the samples of the known classes in the labeled set are true negatives (being disjoint to the novel classes) and their mixing with the farthest features in a queue produces synthetic features which are considerably true negatives and harder than the farthest features for the query. Importantly, in NCD, due to the large population of positives in the queue, mixing of two random samples may lead to the generation of false negatives, which can indeed hurt the performance. Hence, our hard negative generation strategy (see Sec.¬†3.4) alleviates the drawbacks of¬†8  and is tailor-made to NCD.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: task to partition an unlabeled dataset into different semantic categories, where the prior knowledge of a labeled set is not available.
