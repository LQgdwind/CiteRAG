      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBackground \nAmong various application areas of bioinformatics and machine learning,\ndrug design is gathering interest  .\nAccordingly, extensive studies have been done on computational analysis\nof chemical structures.\nThere are two major topics in such studies:\nprediction of the chemical property of a given chemical structure,\nand design of a chemical structure having a desired chemical property.\nThese topics have also been extensively studied in the field of\nchemoinformatics, where the former one is referred to as\nquantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) \nand the latter as\ninverse quantitative structure activity relationship\n(inverse QSAR)   . For the prediction task,\nstatistical methods and machine learning methods have been extensively utilized\n.\nIn most of such studies, there are two phases:\nlearning phase and prediction phase.\nIn the learning phase,\na prediction function is derived from\ntraining data consisting of pairs of chemical structures and their activities\n(or properties),\nwhere each chemical structure is given as an undirected graph (called\na chemical graph) and then is transformed into a vector of real numbers\ncalled features or descriptors.\nIn the prediction phase, the prediction function derived as above\nis simply applied to the feature vector obtained from a given chemical graph.\nTo derive a prediction function,\nregression-based methods have been utilized in traditional QSAR studies\n,\nwhere machine learning-based methods, including\nartificial neural network (ANN)-based methods  [ref]8,\nhave recently been extensively utilized.\nIt is to be noted that when using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) ,\nchemical graphs can be directly handled\nand thus transformation to feature vectors is not necessarily required. For the design task,\nprediction functions are also utilized and are usually derived from\nexisting data as in the above.\nThen, chemical structures are inferred from\ngiven chemical activities through a prediction function\n  \nwhere additional constraints may be imposed to restrict\nthe possible structures.\nIn the traditional approach,\nthis inference task consists of two phases,\n(i) derivation of feature vectors from given chemical activities\nusing the inverse of the prediction function,\nand\n(ii) reconstruction of chemical structures from given feature vectors,\nwhere these two phases are often mixed.\nFor (i),\nsome optimization methods and/or sampling methods are usually\nemployed.\nFor (ii),\nsome enumeration methods are often applied.\nHowever, both are inverse problems and are computationally difficult.\nFor example, it is known that\nthe number of possible chemical graphs is huge 0 and\ninference of a chemical graph from a given feature vector is\nNP-hard in general 1.\nTherefore,\nmost existing methods employ heuristic methods for both (i) and (ii),\nand thus do not guarantee optimal or exact solutions. Recently, different approaches have been proposed for the design task\nusing ANNs.\nOne of the attractive points of ANNs is that generative models are available,\nwhich include autoencoders and generative adversarial networks.\nFurthermore, as mentioned before, chemical structures can be directly\nhandled by using GCNs .\nBy combining these techniques, it might be possible to design novel\nchemical structures without solving the inverse problems 2.\nIndeed, extensive studies have recently been done using various ANN models,\nwhich include\nvariational autoencoders 3,\ngrammar variational autoencoders 4,\ngenerative adversarial networks 5,\nrecurrent neural networks 6 7,\nand invertible flow models 8 9.\nHowever,\nthese are heuristic methods (although based on some statistical models)\nand thus do not guarantee optimality or exactness of the solutions. Framework \nA novel framework for inferring chemical graphs has been developed\n0 1 2 3 based on an idea of formulating\nas a mixed integer linear programming (MILP),\nthe computation process of a prediction function constructed\nby a machine learning method.\nThe unique point of this framework is that\nonce a prediction function is formulated,\nthe inverse problem can be solved exactly by applying an MILP solver.\nIt consists of two main phases: the first phase\nconstructs a prediction function η𝜂\\eta for a chemical property and the second phase\ninfers a chemical graph with a target value of the property based on the function η𝜂\\eta.\nFor a chemical property π𝜋\\pi, let 𝒞πsubscript𝒞𝜋\\mathcal{C}_{\\pi} be a data set of chemical graphs\nsuch that the observed value a​(ℂ)𝑎ℂa(\\mathbb{C}) of property π𝜋\\pi\nfor every chemical graph ℂ∈𝒞πℂsubscript𝒞𝜋\\mathbb{C}\\in\\mathcal{C}_{\\pi} is available.\nIn the first phase, we introduce a feature function f:𝒢→ℝK:𝑓→𝒢superscriptℝ𝐾f:\\mathcal{G}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{K}\nfor a positive integer K𝐾K,\nwhere the descriptors of\na chemical graph are defined based on local graph structures in a special way\ncalled a two-layered model.\nWe then construct a prediction function η𝜂\\eta\nby a machine learning method such as linear regression, decision tree and an ANN\nso that the output y=η​(x)∈ℝ𝑦𝜂𝑥ℝy=\\eta(x)\\in\\mathbb{R} of\nthe feature vector x=f​(ℂ)∈ℝK𝑥𝑓ℂsuperscriptℝ𝐾x=f(\\mathbb{C})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K} for each ℂ∈𝒞πℂsubscript𝒞𝜋\\mathbb{C}\\in\\mathcal{C}_{\\pi}\nserves as a predicted value to the real value a​(ℂ)𝑎ℂa(\\mathbb{C}).\nIn the second phase of inferring a desired chemical graph,\nwe specify not only a target chemical value for property π𝜋\\pi but also\nan abstract structure for a chemical graph to be inferred.\nThe latter is described by a set of rules based on the two-layered model called\na topological specification σ𝜎\\sigma, and denote by 𝒢σsubscript𝒢𝜎\\mathcal{G}_{\\sigma}\nthe set of all chemical graphs that satisfy the rules in σ𝜎\\sigma.\nThe users select topological specification σ𝜎\\sigma and\ntwo reals y¯∗superscript¯𝑦\\underline{y}^{*} and y¯∗superscript¯𝑦\\overline{y}^{*}\nas an interval for a target chemical value.\nThe task of the second phase is\nto infer chemical graphs ℂ∗∈𝒢σsuperscriptℂsubscript𝒢𝜎\\mathbb{C}^{*}\\in\\mathcal{G}_{\\sigma}\nsuch that\ny¯∗≤η​(f​(ℂ∗))≤y¯∗superscript¯𝑦𝜂𝑓superscriptℂsuperscript¯𝑦\\underline{y}^{*}\\leq\\eta(f(\\mathbb{C}^{*}))\\leq\\overline{y}^{*}\n(see Figure 1 for an illustration).\nFor this, we formulate an MILP ℳf,η,σsubscriptℳ𝑓𝜂𝜎\\mathcal{M}_{f,\\eta,\\sigma}\nthat represents\n(i) the computation process of x:=f​(ℂ)assign𝑥𝑓ℂx:=f(\\mathbb{C}) from a chemical graph ℂℂ\\mathbb{C}\nin the feature function f𝑓f;\n(ii) the computation process of y:=η​(x)assign𝑦𝜂𝑥y:=\\eta(x) from a vector x∈ℝK𝑥superscriptℝ𝐾x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K}\nin the prediction function η𝜂\\eta; and\n(iii) the constraint for ℂ∈𝒢σℂsubscript𝒢𝜎\\mathbb{C}\\in\\mathcal{G}_{\\sigma}.\nGiven an interval with y¯∗,y¯∗∈ℝsuperscript¯𝑦superscript¯𝑦ℝ\\underline{y}^{*},\\overline{y}^{*}\\in\\mathbb{R},\nwe solve the MILP ℳf,η,σsubscriptℳ𝑓𝜂𝜎\\mathcal{M}_{f,\\eta,\\sigma}\nto find a feature vector x∗∈ℝKsuperscript𝑥superscriptℝ𝐾x^{*}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K}\nand a chemical graph ℂ†∈𝒢σsuperscriptℂ†subscript𝒢𝜎\\mathbb{C}^{\\dagger}\\in\\mathcal{G}_{\\sigma}\nsuch that f​(ℂ†)=x∗𝑓superscriptℂ†superscript𝑥f(\\mathbb{C}^{\\dagger})=x^{*} and\ny¯∗≤η​(x∗)≤y¯∗superscript¯𝑦𝜂superscript𝑥superscript¯𝑦\\underline{y}^{*}\\leq\\eta(x^{*})\\leq\\overline{y}^{*}\n(where if the MILP instance is infeasible\nthen this suggests that 𝒢σsubscript𝒢𝜎\\mathcal{G}_{\\sigma}\ndoes not contain such a desired chemical graph).\nIn the second phase, we next generate\nsome other desired chemical graphs based on the solution ℂ†superscriptℂ†\\mathbb{C}^{\\dagger}.\nFor this, the following two methods have been designed. The first method constructs\nisomers of ℂ†superscriptℂ†\\mathbb{C}^{\\dagger} without solving any new MILP.\nIn this method, we first decompose the chemical graph ℂ†superscriptℂ†\\mathbb{C}^{\\dagger} into\na set of chemical acyclic graphs T1†,T2†,…,Tq†subscriptsuperscript𝑇†1subscriptsuperscript𝑇†2…subscriptsuperscript𝑇†𝑞T^{\\dagger}_{1},T^{\\dagger}_{2},\\ldots,T^{\\dagger}_{q},\nand next construct a set 𝒯isubscript𝒯𝑖\\mathcal{T}_{i} of isomers Ti∗subscriptsuperscript𝑇𝑖T^{*}_{i} of each tree Ti†subscriptsuperscript𝑇†𝑖T^{\\dagger}_{i}\nsuch that f​(Ti∗)=f​(Ti†)𝑓subscriptsuperscript𝑇𝑖𝑓subscriptsuperscript𝑇†𝑖f(T^{*}_{i})=f(T^{\\dagger}_{i}) by a dynamic programming algorithm\ndue to Azam et al. 4.\nFinally\nwe choose an isomer Ti∗∈𝒯isubscriptsuperscript𝑇𝑖subscript𝒯𝑖T^{*}_{i}\\in\\mathcal{T}_{i} for each i=1,2,…,q𝑖12…𝑞i=1,2,\\ldots,q\nand assemble them into an isomer ℂ∗∈𝒢σsuperscriptℂsubscript𝒢𝜎\\mathbb{C}^{*}\\in\\mathcal{G}_{\\sigma} of ℂ†superscriptℂ†\\mathbb{C}^{\\dagger}\nsuch that f​(ℂ∗)=x∗=f​(ℂ†)𝑓superscriptℂsuperscript𝑥𝑓superscriptℂ†f(\\mathbb{C}^{*})=x^{*}=f(\\mathbb{C}^{\\dagger}).\nThe first method generates such isomers ℂ1∗,ℂ2∗,…superscriptsubscriptℂ1superscriptsubscriptℂ2…\\mathbb{C}_{1}^{*},\\mathbb{C}_{2}^{*},\\ldots\nwhich\nwe call recombination solutions of ℂ†superscriptℂ†\\mathbb{C}^{\\dagger}. The second method constructs new solutions\nby solving the MILP ℳf,η,σsubscriptℳ𝑓𝜂𝜎\\mathcal{M}_{f,\\eta,\\sigma}\nwith an additional set ΘΘ\\Theta of new linear constraints 3.\nWe first prepare arbitrary pdimsubscript𝑝dimp_{\\mathrm{dim}}\nlinear functions θj:ℝK→ℝ,j=1,2,…,pdim:subscript𝜃𝑗formulae-sequence→superscriptℝ𝐾ℝ𝑗12…subscript𝑝dim\\theta_{j}:\\mathbb{R}^{K}\\to\\mathbb{R},j=1,2,\\ldots,p_{\\mathrm{dim}}\nand consider a neighbor of ℂ†superscriptℂ†\\mathbb{C}^{\\dagger}\ndefined by a set of chemical graphs ℂ∗superscriptℂ\\mathbb{C}^{*} that satisfy linear constraints\n(k−0.5)​δ≤|θj​(f​(ℂ∗))−θj​(f​(ℂ†))|≤(k+0.5)​δ,j=1,2,…,pdimformulae-sequence𝑘0.5𝛿subscript𝜃𝑗𝑓superscriptℂsubscript𝜃𝑗𝑓superscriptℂ†𝑘0.5𝛿𝑗12…subscript𝑝dim(k-0.5)\\delta\\leq|\\theta_{j}(f(\\mathbb{C}^{*}))-\\theta_{j}(f(\\mathbb{C}^{\\dagger}))|\\leq(k+0.5)\\delta,j=1,2,\\ldots,p_{\\mathrm{dim}}\nfor a small real δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 and an integer k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1.\nBy changing the integer k𝑘k systematically, we can search for new solutions\nℂ1†,ℂ2†,…∈𝒢σsubscriptsuperscriptℂ†1subscriptsuperscriptℂ†2…subscript𝒢𝜎\\mathbb{C}^{\\dagger}_{1},\\mathbb{C}^{\\dagger}_{2},\\ldots\\in\\mathcal{G}_{\\sigma}\nof MILP ℳf,η,σsubscriptℳ𝑓𝜂𝜎\\mathcal{M}_{f,\\eta,\\sigma}\nwith constraint ΘΘ\\Theta such that the feature\nvectors x∗=f​(ℂ†),x1∗=f​(ℂ1†),x2∗=f​(ℂ2†),…formulae-sequencesuperscript𝑥𝑓superscriptℂ†formulae-sequencesubscriptsuperscript𝑥1𝑓subscriptsuperscriptℂ†1subscriptsuperscript𝑥2𝑓subscriptsuperscriptℂ†2…x^{*}=f(\\mathbb{C}^{\\dagger}),x^{*}_{1}=f(\\mathbb{C}^{\\dagger}_{1}),x^{*}_{2}=f(\\mathbb{C}^{\\dagger}_{2}),\\ldots\nare all slightly different.\nWe call these chemical graphs\nℂ1†,ℂ2†,…subscriptsuperscriptℂ†1subscriptsuperscriptℂ†2…\\mathbb{C}^{\\dagger}_{1},\\mathbb{C}^{\\dagger}_{2},\\ldots neighbor solutions of ℂ†superscriptℂ†\\mathbb{C}^{\\dagger}. The main reason why the framework can infer a chemical compound\nwith 50 non-hydrogen atoms is that the descriptors of\na chemical graph are defined on local graph structures in the two-layered model and\nthereby an MILP necessary to represent\na chemical graph can be formulated\nas a considerably compact form that is efficiently solvable by a standard solver. Contribution \nThe descriptors in the framework\nmainly consists of the frequencies of local graph structures\nbased on the two-layered model\nby which a chemical graph ℂℂ\\mathbb{C} is regarded as a pair\nof interior and exterior structures (see Section 3 for details).\nTo derive a compact MILP formulation to infer a chemical graph,\nit is important to use the current definition of descriptors.\nHowever, there are some chemical properties for which\nthe performance of a prediction function constructed\nwith the feature function f𝑓f remains rather low.\nTo improve the learning performance of prediction functions with the same two-layered model,\nwe propose a method of splitting a given data set with a hyperplane in the feature space\ninto two subsets, where\nwe construct a prediction function to each of the subsets independently before\na prediction function η𝜂\\eta to the original set is obtained by\ncombining these prediction functions (see Section 5 for details).\nBased on the same MILP ℳf,η,σsubscriptℳ𝑓𝜂𝜎\\mathcal{M}_{f,\\eta,\\sigma} formulation\nproposed by Zhu et al. 1,\nwe implemented the framework to treat the newly proposed type of prediction.\nFrom the results of our computational experiments on over some chemical properties\nsuch as odor threshold 0,\nwe observe that our new method of splitting data sets and combining prediction functions\nimproved the performance of a prediction function for these chemical properties.\nIt is to be noted that extensive studies have been done on prediction problems\nusing hyperplanes\nsince the development of support vector machines 5.\nHowever, existing methods can only be applied to prediction problems.\nThe novel and unique point of our study is that\nan efficient MILP formulation for chemical graphs is developed,\nwhich makes the inverse problem (i.e., design problem) tractable. The paper is organized as follows.\nSection 2 introduces some notions on graphs and\na modeling of chemical compounds.\nSection 3 reviews the two-layered model and\ndescriptors defined by the model.\nSection 4\nreviews prediction functions constructed by linear regression.\nSection 5 proposes a method of splitting a data set by a hyperplane\nand a linear programming formulation for finding such a hyperplane.\nSection 6 reports the results on computational\nexperiments conducted for 22 chemical properties\nsuch as autoignition temperature, flammable limits and odor threshold.\nSection 7 makes some concluding remarks.\nSome technical details are given in Appendices:\nAppendix A\nfor all descriptors in our feature function;\nAppendix B\nfor a full description of a topological specification; and\nAppendix C\nfor the detail of test instances used in our computational experiment.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: derive a prediction function,\nregression-based methods have been utilized in traditional QSAR studies\n,\nwhere machine learning-based methods, including\nartificial neural network (ANN)-based methods  [ref]8,\nhave recently been extensively utilized.\nIt is to be noted that when using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) ,\nchemical graphs can be directly handled\nand thus transformation to feature\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
