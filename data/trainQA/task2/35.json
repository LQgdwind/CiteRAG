      "content": "Paper Title: A Study of the Tasks and Models in Machine Reading Comprehension\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComplex-reasoning MRC models usually borrow a lot of architecture designs from simple-reasoning MRC models, and also develop new techniques to provide new functions, such as screening out distracting passages, generating textual answers, and reasoning across passages, to name a few. \nIn most complex-reasoning MRC tasks, only a few passages of each context are relevant to the corresponding question, while the rest are useless and thus could distract MRC models, therefore it is necessary to screen out the distracting passages so as to focus on the relevant ones. To this end, a confidence approach [ref]33 first uses a passage ranking model to select the most relevant passages from each context, then samples a subset from the selected passages for training and the full set for inference, next uses a simple-reasoning MRC model to generate an unnormalized answer span distribution over each sampled passage, and finally uses a shared normalization to generate a normalized answer span distribution over all the sampled passages. A deep cascade approach [ref]34 first uses a document ranking model and a paragraph ranking model to select the most relevant passages (i.e. the most relevant paragraphs in the most relevant documents), then adapts a simple-reasoning MRC model to the question and the selected passages by processing different passages in parallel, and finally performs document extraction and paragraph extraction as two auxiliary tasks of answer extraction. The above approaches screen out a part of the distracting passages in advance through a ranking process, which is necessary when each context consists of many passages. But in cases where the number of passages per context is limited, the ranking process can be skipped and the distracting passages can be screened out by simply performing passage extraction together with answer extraction in a multi-task manner . \nIn some complex-reasoning MRC tasks, golden answers are not necessarily exact spans in contexts but human-generated abstractive summaries of context-question pairs. Although such abstractive answers can be approximated by training MRC models to predict the most similar answer spans [ref]36 , it is more interesting to train MRC models to directly generate textual answers. To this end, an extraction-then-synthesis approach  first trains an MRC model to extract an answer span based on each given context-question pair, and then trains a text generation model to synthesize a textual answer based on the context-question pair and the extracted answer span. A multi-style abstractive summarization approach  solved this problem by proposing an end-to-end MRC model, which applies a Transformer  based pointer-generator mechanism  such that each answer word is either drawn from the vocabulary or copied from the corresponding context-question pair, and also sets special tokens at the answer start position to represent answer styles, such as well-formed sentences and concise phrases. \nIn some complex-reasoning MRC tasks, the answer to each question may appear in multiple passages of the corresponding context, since the passages of the context are independent from each other. Besides, the appearance of the answer in a passage does not imply that the passage alone is sufficient for the question, since locating answer may require information from other passages. Therefore, reasoning across passages to integrate supporting information can usually improve the performance of complex-reasoning MRC models. An answer re-ranking approach  first collects the most probable answer candidates from a baseline MRC model, and then uses two proposed re-rankers, namely strength-based re-ranker and coverage-based re-ranker, to re-score the answer candidates by aggregating evidences from the corresponding passages for each answer candidate. A cross-passage answer verification approach [ref]36 performs answer content modeling and answer verification as two auxiliary tasks of answer extraction, where answer content modeling is estimating whether each word should be included in the answer, and answer verification is verifying the answer from each passage with those from the other passages to estimate its correctness. An answering-while-summarizing approach  uses a proposed query-focused extractor to perform evidence extraction as an auxiliary task of answer extraction, which sequentially extracts evidence sentences from the context sentences with an RNN attending to the question sentence such that the sentence-level relationship is taken into account.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: the rest are useless and thus could distract MRC models, therefore it is necessary to screen out the distracting passages so as to focus on the relevant ones. To this end, a confidence approach [ref]33 first uses a passage ranking model to select the most relevant passages from each context, then samples a subset from the selected passages for training and the full set for inference, next\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
