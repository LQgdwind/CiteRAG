      "content": "Paper Title: Semi-decentralized Inference in Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Demand Forecasting: An Edge-Computing Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph data structures appear naturally in many fields such as user accounts in a social network and vehicles in a traffic system [ref]24. GNNs extend DL to graph data by combining graph structure and node information through message passing and aggregation  [ref]26. This combination enables GNNs to produce node embeddings to serve multiple downstream graph tasks such as node classification (inferring the class label of a node), link prediction (estimating the likelihood of a link to exist between given\nnodes), and graph classification (inferring a property of the graph as a whole). Each node in a graph has a computational graph composed of its LùêøL-hop neighboring nodes. Node embeddings are obtained by alternating between message passing, i.e., communicating local information across nodes, and aggregation where received messages along with previous node information are used to obtain an updated node embedding. Message passing is done according to the topology of the graph, whereas aggregation is done by the neural network layers of the GNN model obtained by training over graph data [ref]27 . As DL methods overlook useful relationships, recent literature considers modeling the traffic system as a graph and applying a GNN approach to problems such as taxi demand and supply forecasting and flow prediction . A city area is divided into many regions and each region is represented by a node in the graph. Several works assume different edges linking these nodes such as having a common origin-destination relationship between two regions if there is a taxi moving from one region (origin) to the other (destination) . A more recent example work  considers dividing a city into non-uniform regions serving as the graph nodes linked with edges representing their road connectivity. Despite the clear advantages of GNNs, the existing research body on their usage for taxi demand and supply forecasting assumes homogeneous graphs. So, (homogeneous) GNNs along with other DL models such as LSTM are mainly used to perform the forecasting. Still, when modeling the traffic system as a graph, it may contain different types of nodes with different relation types. So, restricting the use of GNNs to homogeneous models overlooks this richness of relation types and limits the potential of GNNs. Therefore, it is advantageous to model traffic systems as HINs processed by hetGNNs  where the prediction can be improved by incorporating multiple relationships between the graph nodes. The main challenge hetGNNs face is handling heterogeneity. While some primitive hetGNNs project the HIN on the graph space to eliminate its heterogeneity , others use the metapath concept  111A meta path is a composition of relations linking two nodes. to maintain and utilize the heterogeneity   . This is achieved by decomposing the HIN into multiple metapaths encoded to get node representations under graph semantics. hetGNNs have been shown to outperform their GNN ancestors in many applications such as malicious payment detection , drug/illegal trade detection , and network intrusion attack detection .\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Graph data structures appear naturally in many fields such as user accounts in a social network and vehicles in a traffic system [ref]24.
