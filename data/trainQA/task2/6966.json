      "content": "Paper Title: Effective Multi-Graph Neural Networks for Illicit Account Detection on Cryptocurrency Transaction Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets.\nWe evaluate on 4 real cryptocurrency datasets, including 2 Ethereum datasets and 2 Bitcoin datasets. The statistics of the datasets are listed in Table II. The first three datasets are from existing works, and we create the last largest Bitcoin dataset with more than 20 million nodes and 203 million edges. We obtain ground-truth labels into the datasets by crawling illicit and normal account labels from reliable sources, including Etherscan  and WalletExplorer .\nEthereum-S [ref]51 and Ethereum-P  are two Ethereum transaction networks. In both datasets, every edge has two attributes: transaction amount and timestamp.\nThe labeled illicit nodes are the addresses that conduct phishing scams in these two datasets.\nFor Ethereum-P dataset from , it only contains illicit node labels. We enhance the dataset by identifying the benign accounts (e.g., wallets and finance services) in Ethereum-P from Etherscan  as normal node labels.\nBitcoin-M  is a medium-sized dataset containing the first 1.5 million transactions from June 2015.\nAs explained in Section III-A, a Bitcoin transaction can involve multiple senders and receivers.\nAfter built as a multigraph, Bitcoin-M has about 2.5 million nodes and 14 million edges.\nIn Bitcoin-M, an edge has 5 attributes: input amount, output amount, number of inputs, number of outputs, and timestamp.\nWe build the largest Bitcoin-L based on all transactions happened from June to September 2015. Bitcoin-L has more than 20 million nodes and 200 million edges, and each edge has 8 attributes: input amount, output amount, number of inputs, number of outputs, fee, total value of all inputs, total value of all outputs, and timestamp.\nWe obtain the labeled data in Bitcoin-M and Bitcoin-L by crawling from WalletExplorer .\nBitcoin addresses belonging to gambling and mixing services are regarded as illicit accounts, while the addresses in other types are normal accounts.\nParallel edges between nodes are common in the datasets. For instance, in Ethereum-P, there are 5,353,834 connected node pairs, and 1,287,910 of them have more than one edge (24.06%). Baselines.\nTo comprehensively evaluate our method, we compare with 14 competitors in 3 categories. Cryptocurrency illicit account detection methods, including Pdetector , SigTran , and EdgeProp [ref]15. In particular,\nPdetector leverages GCN and autoencoder to detect Ethereum phishing scams.\nSigTran employs feature engineering and node2vec [ref]26 to learn node representations that are used to train a logistic regression classifier for illicit account detection.\nEdgeProp also uses handcrafted features to train a GNN model to identify illicit accounts. Graph-based anomaly detection methods, including CARE-GNN , DCI , PC-GNN, GDN from AEGIS , and FRAUDRE .\nAs a message passing module in AEGIS, GDN modifies GAT by using feature differences between neighboring nodes in message passing and attention mechanism, to address the discrepancy issue discussed in Section IV-C. Note that AEGIS itself is unsupervised, which is different from the supervised setting in this paper, and thus it is not compared.\nDCI decouples node representation learning and anomaly detection classification, and adopts self-supervised learning for anomaly detection.\nCARE-GNN is based on reinforcement learning for anomaly detection on relation graphs.\nPC-GNN develops node sampler to alleviate class imbalance of fraud detection.\nFRAUDRE considers neighborhood differences and also develops a loss function to remedy class imbalance.\nCARE-GNN, PC-GNN, and FRAUDRE are designed for relation graphs, and we set the number of relations as 1, to run them on the datasets. GNN models, including GCN , Sage , GAT , GATE , GINE , and TransConv . GCN is widely used to learn node representations via graph convolutions. Sage is a general inductive framework to learn embeddings by sampling and aggregating local neighborhood features. GAT employs self-attention to assign importance to neighbors, and GATE extends GAT by edge attributes. GINE also uses edge attributes for message passing. TransConv is a graph transformer network. Since all baselines require initial node features as input, following the way in SigTran , we obtain node features, such as node degree and total received/sent amount, by feature engineering for the baselines. Particularly, in this way, we get 48, 48, 69, and 89 node features for datasets Ethereum-P, Ethereum-S, Bitcoin-M, and Bitcoin-L respectively. In terms of Pdetector, we extract the 8 specific node features suggested in its paper  for its training, in order to make a fair comparison.\nGDN, EdgeProp, as well as the GNN-based models, are not originally designed for the binary classification task in this paper. Therefore, we regard them as the encoder to generate node representations, which are then sent to a 2-layer MLP classifier with the same objective in Section IV-D. Implementation Details.\nWe implement DIAM and GNN-based models using Pytorch and Pytorch Geometric. We also use Pytorch to implement GDN and Pdetector following the respective papers. For the other competitors, we use their original codes provided by the respective authors.\nAll experiments are conducted on a Linux server with Intel Xeon Gold 6226R 2.90GHz CPU and an Nvidia RTX 3090 GPU card. Parameter Settings.\nWe set node representation dimension (c=128𝑐128c=128), the number of GNN layers (2), learning rate (0.001), dropout rate (0.2).\nIn DIAM, we set maximum sequence length Tm​a​x=32subscript𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥32T_{max}=32.\nWe will study the impact of Tm​a​xsubscript𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥T_{max} in Section V-F.\nFor all methods, we adopt Adam optimizer, mini-batch training  with batch size 128, and, if not specified, rectified linear units (ReLU) is used as the activation function.\nFor all GNN models, GDN, EdgeProp, and our method that require neighborhood sampling, given a target node, we randomly sample its 1 and 2-hop neighbors with sample size 25 and 10 respectively. For other settings in baselines, we follow the instructions in their respective papers. The number of training epochs is set as 30 in Ethereum-S, Ethereum-P, and Bitcoin-M, and set as 10 in Bitcoin-L.\n Evaluation Settings.\nWe adopt 4 evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 score, and Area Under ROC curve (AUC for short).\nAll metrics indicate better performance when they are higher.\nFor each dataset, we split all labeled nodes into training, validation, and testing sets with ratio 2:1:1.\nEach model is trained on the training set. When a model achieves the highest F1 score on the validation set, we report the evaluation results on the testing set as the model’s performance.\nFor each method, we train it for 5 times and report the average value of each evaluation metric. We also study the training time in Section V-E and the impact when varying training set size as well as the percentage of illicit node labels in Section V-F.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: nodes and 203 million edges. We obtain ground-truth labels into the datasets by crawling illicit and normal account labels from reliable sources, including Etherscan  and WalletExplorer .\nEthereum-S [ref]51 and Ethereum-P  are two Ethereum transaction networks. In both datasets, every edge has two attributes: transaction amount and timestamp.\nThe labeled illicit nodes are the addresses that\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
