Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

Oxford Flowers [ref]37 for fine-grained flower classification (8,189 images in 102 categories); 2. MIT Scenes [ref]39 for indoor scene classification (15,620 images in 67 categories); 3. Caltech-UCSD Birds  for fine-grained bird classification (11,788 images in 200 categories); 4. Stanford Cars  for fine-grained car classification (16,185 images of 196 categories); 5. FGVC-Aircraft [ref]32 for fined-grained aircraft classification (10,200 images in 70 categories); 6. VOC actions , the human action classification subset of the VOC challenge 2012 (3,334 images in 10 categories); 7. Letters, the Chars74K datasets  for character recognition in natural images (62,992 images in 62 categories); and 8. the Google Street View House Number SVHN dataset  for digit recognition (99,289 images in 10 categories). To have a fair comparison, we use the same AlexNet  architecture pretrained on ImageNet  as Aljundi et al.  , and tested on 8 sequential tasks with a \"multi-head evaluation\", where each task has its own classification layer (introduce same parameter costs for every method) and output space. All methods have a task oracle at test time to decide which classification layer to use. We run the different methods on the following sequence: Flower -> Scenes -> Birds -> Cars -> Aircraft -> Action -> Letters -> SVHM.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: To demonstrate the superior performance of BPN across different datasets and domains, we consider a sequence of eight object recognition datasets: 1.
