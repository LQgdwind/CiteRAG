      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring Large Language Models and Hierarchical Frameworks for Classification of Large Unstructured Legal Documents\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA legal case proceeding cycle111https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/civil_procedure involves analyzing vast amounts of data and legal precedents, which can be a time-consuming process given the complexity and length of the case. The number of legal cases in a country is also proportionally related to its population. This leads to a backlog of cases, especially in highly populated countries, ultimately setting back the progress of its legal system222https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202204/1260044.shtml.\nAutomating such legal case procedures can help speed up and strengthen the decision-making process, saving time and benefiting both the legal authorities and the people involved. One of the fundamental problems that deal with this larger component is the prediction of the outcome based just on the case’s raw texts (which can include facts, arguments, appeals, etc. except the final decision), as in a typical real-life (raw) setting.\n Several machine learning techniques have been applied to legal texts to predict judgments as a text classification problem (, [ref]12). While it seems like a general text classification task, legal texts differ from general texts and are rather more complex, broadly in two ways, i.e. structure and syntax and, lexicon and grammar (, [ref]7, ). The structure of legal case documents is not uniform in most settings and their complex syntax and lexicon make it more difficult and expensive to annotate, requiring only legal professionals. This adds to another challenge of the long lengths of these documents, reaching more than 10000 words (Table 3). This lack of structure information and the long lengths of these legal documents pose a challenge in predicting judgments. In our work we explore this problem on four fronts, by (a) developing a hierarchical framework for the classification of large unstructured legal documents, (b) exploring the adaptability of billion-parameter large language models (LLMs) to this framework, (c) analyzing the performance of these LLMs without this framework and (d) checking the intra-domain(legal) transfer learning capability of domain-specific pre-trained LLMs. This is summarized below:\n We explore the problem of judgment prediction from large unstructured legal documents and propose a hierarchical multi-stage neural classification framework named \\sayMulti-stage Encoder-based Supervised with-clustering (MESc). This works by extracting embeddings from the last four layers of a fine-tuned encoder of a large language model (LLM) and using an unsupervised clustering mechanism to approximate the structure. Alongside the embeddings, these approximated structure labels are processed through another set of transformer encoder layers for final classification. We show the effect of combining features from the last layers of transformer-based LLMs (BERT, GPT-Neo[ref]3, GPT-J), along with the impact on classification upon using the approximated structure. We study the adaptability of domain-specific pre-trained multi-billion parameter LLMs to such documents and study their intra-domain(legal) transfer learning capability (both with fine-tuning and in MESc).  We performed extensive experiments and analysis on four different datasets (ILDC and LexGLUE’s  ECtHR(A), ECtHR(B), and SCOTUS) and achieved a total gain of ≈\\approx 2 points in classification on these datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: except the final decision), as in a typical real-life (raw) setting.\n Several machine learning techniques have been applied to legal texts to predict judgments as a text classification problem (, [ref]12).
