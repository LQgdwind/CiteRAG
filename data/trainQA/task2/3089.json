      "content": "Paper Title: MixSyn: Learning Composition and Style for Multi-Source Image Synthesis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPatch-based Synthesis. Traditional approaches provide semantically guided synthesis using patch similarity [ref]2, graph cuts exploiting repetitions [ref]25, and guided inverse modeling exploiting instances . Their deep generative counterparts flex similarity and repetition coercion, so the synthesis can be much efficient , adaptive , complex , yielding detailed results , due to simplistic part-based similarity  and contrastive  losses. Inspired by patch-based approaches, we propose a novel semantic image synthesis method where patches are replaced with fuzzy semantic regions, shifting our focus from patch selection to patch composition. Style Transfer. Recently, popular image manipulation tasks emerge from applying the style of a source image to a target image by adaptive normalization , with explicit domain labels , utilizing soft masks , transferring segment by segment , for attribute editing , and in multiple domains . In particular for combining multiple sources,   blend features in GAN layers of multiple reference images; however the spatial regions and blended features are provided manually.  conditions hair generation on multi-input; however masks are kept constant.  can translate a collage image to a photorealistic image, but there is no semantic structure and the collage creation is a manual pre-processing step. Conditional Normalization. As semantic synthesis approaches and conditional GANs start to demand more accuracy and realism, supplying masks only as an input to the first layers did not suffice to preserve the contribution of regions as the network grows deeper. Later, the quality of results has been significantly enhanced by injecting style  and structure 4 information in the adaptive normalization layers. 0 took it a step further and introduced region-adaptive normalization, which allows introducing per region styles. Building upon, we introduce MixSyn blocks (MS-block), a slight modification over 4 with 0 normalization, to broadcast styles per learned regions. Semantic Editing. Another semantic image manipulation direction is to modify or create some binary mask for inclusion/exclusion  , manipulate the underlying mask  , generate the mask only with label collections , replace foreground objects , learn binary compositions , use encoder-decoder networks to learn the blending 1, or infill with another image 4 to inpaint the manipulated parts. Although such approaches provide control over semantic labels, (1) generation is not controllable or guided by a certain image, (2) they mostly do inpainting instead of synthesis, and (3) there is no multi-source capability, i.e., all of them utilize source-target pairs. Meanwhile, other approaches push the image-to-image translation to mask-to-mask translation , sketch-to-sketch translation , or scene graph editing 5, where the new mask contains structure of the source and style of the target. Our approach is conceptually similar, but instead of user-defined masks, the mask is a learned composition of regions from multiple masks.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Patch-based Synthesis.
