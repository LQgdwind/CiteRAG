      "content": "Paper Title: PALMAR: Towards Adaptive Multi-inhabitant Activity Recognition in Point-Cloud Technology\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThough, recent advancement of internet-of-things (IoT) sensors and deep learning techniques result significant improvement in HAR, the most accurate Multiple Person Tracking and Human Activity Recognition (MPT-HAR) state-of-arts are still computer vision based techniques [ref]30   [ref]36    [ref]40       . Due to the lower acceptance of privacy-concerned camera-based frameworks, many researchers employed privacy-preserving PCD technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), millimeter Wave (mmWave) and Ultrasound (US) to investigate MPT-HAR problem to reach the closest accuracy to camera-based techniques by introducing extensive signal processing and complex deep learning models [ref]30   [ref]36. In this paper, we propose a novel MPT-HAR system that can transfer the domain knowledge from accurate privacy concerned technology (say Computer Vision) to privacy-preserving PCD technologies by utilizing signal processing and adaptive machine learning techniques. Many PCD technologies, such as Ultrasound, mmWave and LiDAR, have been used by researchers before for gait pattern identification , activity recognition , person tracking . All of the above sensors provide PCD that are, in general, large data sets composed of 3D point data. PCD are derived from raw data scanned from physical objects such as building exteriors and interiors, humans, process plants, topographies, and manufactured items. More specifically for PCD generating systems that emit light pulses outside visible light spectrum and capture the duration of its return. The distance vector of returned pulse is saved as point of cloud which is represented as xùë•x, yùë¶y and zùëßz values in 3D space. Previously, expensive PCD systems have been used to solve different problems such as object detection 4, distance identification , 3D imaging , multiple person tracking  and gait recognition . The above solutions have been applied on many applications such as automated driving , remote health monitoring  and elderly care . In current state-of-art methods, employment of intense signal processing and deep learning techniques on PCD Data resulted maximum accuracy of multiple person tracking with 89%  and multiple person HAR with 75%  which needs significant improvement. In this paper, we argue that privacy preserving PCD data based HAR can be significantly improved by existing computer vision data which needs careful utilization of signal processing as well as novel domain adaptation techniques. In this regard, we propose novel trios: Adaptive Order Hidden Markov Model to track multiple persons, Crossover Path Disambiguation Algorithm (CPDA) to improve tracking and variational autoencoder-based domain adaptation algorithm to improve activity recognition. The core of our proposed architecture is an adaptive deep learning framework that consists of the following modules: Person tracker module combines voxel representator, DBSCAN and BIRCH clustering method to represent LiDAR PCD to reduce data dimension i.e. improve computational efficiency. The feature extractor module, which is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), cooperates with the activity recognizer to recognize person tracker provided multiple-humans‚Äô activities, and simultaneously, minimize the KL divergence of variational autoencoder-based domain adaptation module to diminish environment/subject-independent divergence. Our framework not only improves the performance of MPT-HAR state-of-arts in supervised learning scenario, but also the domain adaptation techniques significantly improve HAR performance to facilitate low or unlabelled target environments/domains without losing any significant performance reduction in the edge computing system. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of PALMAR frameworks and systems in terms of effectiveness and generalizability.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: techniques result significant improvement in HAR, the most accurate Multiple Person Tracking and Human Activity Recognition (MPT-HAR) state-of-arts are still computer vision based techniques [ref]30   [ref]36    [ref]40       .
