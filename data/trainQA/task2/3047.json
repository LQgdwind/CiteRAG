      "content": "Paper Title: Explainable AI for Psychological Profiling from Digital Footprints: A Case Study of Big Five Personality Predictions from Spending Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor explaining model classifications at the local level, we compute counterfactual rules   [ref]43. Compared to local feature relevance methods, such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) [ref]44 and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) , counterfactual rules explain the model’s predicted class instead of the score  . Following Martens & Provost (2014), who defined counterfactuals for document classifications, we define counterfactual rules for a classification as a set of features from the instance that is causal: changing the value of the features causes the system’s decision to change. In other words, the decision would have been different if not for the presence of this set of features.\nThere are multiple ways of defining changes of the feature values. A common approach is to simulate the ‘missingness’ of a feature by replacing the value by the mean value of the feature (for continuous features) or the mode value (for sparse numerical, binary or categorical data). In essence, we are asking ourselves the question if the model would make the same decision if a feature in question would be missing . It is important, both in research and practice, that the choice on how to define ‘changes’ is clearly mentioned, because, depending on this, slightly different explanations may arise. We use counterfactual explanations, first of all, because they point at a set of features without which the AI system would have made a different decision. They help us understand how features affect decisions of AI systems, rather than predicted scores, in terms of domain knowledge, rather than in terms of modeling techniques. Providing a concrete justification for a decision gives data subjects insight into changes to receive a desired result in the future, based on their current behavior, and is consistent with requirements specified in regulatory frameworks [ref]43. Another advantage is that the explanation only comprises a (small) fraction of all features used in a model, which makes it a particularly interesting approach to explain decisions of models with high-dimensional feature dimensions. Prior work showed cases where these explanations can be obtained only in seconds for models on large-scale data, and that explanations typically consisted of a handful to a few dozen of features   . Moreover, in contrast to local feature relevance methods, where it is non-trivial to choose the complexity setting (i.e., how many features to show), the answer for counterfactuals is clear-cut: those features are shown that allow for the creation of a counterfactual rule .\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: For explaining model classifications at the local level, we compute counterfactual rules   [ref]43.
