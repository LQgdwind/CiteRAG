When working with spatial data sets, it is important to study the role of underlying spatial relationships . To illustrate this importance, consider the spatiotemporal dynamics of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case rates, which is one of the key motivations for our work.\nThe spatial adjacencies between the neighborhoods of a city affect the dynamics of disease spread , and it is important to account for them. Researchers have studied a wide variety of spatial data sets, such as gross domestic product (GDP) and life expectancy by country   and voting in elections across different regions of a state . Such data sets often also include temporal information (e.g., daily COVID-19 case rates), and it is also important to take it into account. We develop new methods for using topological data analysis (TDA) to analyze geospatial and geospatiotemporal data sets in a way that directly incorporates spatial information. TDA is a way to study the “shape” of a data set . Using persistent homology (PH), which is an approach from algebraic topology, one can algorithmically find geometric voids of different dimensions in a data set and quantify the “persistence” of these voids 6. Zero-dimensional (0D) voids are connected components and one-dimensional (1D) voids are holes. To quantify the persistence of holes and other voids, one constructs a simplicial complex (which is a combinatorial description of a topological space) and a filtration function (see section 2.1). In our work, we treat geographical data as two-dimensional (2D) data and construct a 2D filtered simplicial complex (FSC) to represent it. The computation of PH has yielded insights into a wide variety of areas, such as dynamical systems  , collective behavior , neuroscience  , materials science , and chemistry [ref]28. Spatial applications that have been examined as 2D data sets using PH include sensor networks , percolation, , and city-street networks and other complex systems [ref]19. When we examine time-dependent data, we use vineyards, which were introduced in  as a way to represent time-varying PH, to incorporate temporal information. One can visualize a vineyard as a continuous stack of persistence diagrams (PDs), with one PD for each time point. The homology classes trace out curves, which are called vines, in ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3}. At any single point in time, a homology class in the PD at that time corresponds to a (birth simplex, death simplex) pair. The birth simplex creates the homology class, and the death simplex destroys the homology class (see section 2.1). In a vineyard, a vine corresponds to a sequence of (birth simplex, death simplex) pairs. See section 2.2 for the definition of a vineyard.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: to represent it.
