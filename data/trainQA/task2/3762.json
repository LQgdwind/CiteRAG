Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Homogeneous Modality Learning and Multi-Granularity Information Exploration for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisible-visible person Re-ID studies typically tackle a single-modality case, that is, both query and gallery images are captured by visible cameras. It usually suffers from the large intra-class variations caused by different views , poses  and occlusions . Nowadays, substantial research efforts [ref]26   [ref]47 [ref]14     have been constructed to extract discriminative features or learn effective distance metrics. For a instance, the work of  exploits attributes as complementary information to help recognize the target person. Self-attention based methods  [ref]47 incorporate attention techniques to let the network concentrate on discriminative regions. Part-based approaches [ref]26 [ref]14  treat person Re-ID as a partial feature learning task, dividing person images into multiple horizontal strips and applying independent classifiers to suprvise each local strips. Other methods are based on metric learning, focusing on desgining proper loss functions for optimizing feature distances between different samples, like the contrastive loss , sphere loss  and triplet loss . The overwhelming majority of techniques in these literature have achieved considerable success in visible-to-visible matching, while they are ill-suited for cross-modality image retrieval in poor lighting environments 4, limiting\napplicability in practical 24-hour surveillance situations.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: gallery images are captured by visible cameras.
