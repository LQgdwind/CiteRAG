      "content": "Paper Title: Use All The Labels: A Hierarchical Multi-Label Contrastive Learning Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe adopt a pre-trained ResNet-50 [ref]14, which was trained on ImageNet [ref]7, as the encoder network. For the ImageNet experiments, we train the model from scratch. We finetune on our datasets for 100 epochs. Specifically, we finetuned the parameters of the fourth layer of the ResNet-50 as well as a multi-layer perceptron header [ref]18 on the seen dataset with the proposed losses. The optimizer is SGD with momentum . The encoder model weights are frozen after the network is trained in this fashion. We train an additional linear classifier for 40 epochs to obtain the classification accuracy. We use the same setup for all models. Although the proposed losses can be trained together with the linear classifier, we find that the performance gap is rather small. The batch size in our experiments is 512, and we use the temperature τ𝜏\\tau as 0.1 in all experiments. We start from the learning rate as 0.1, and decrease it by 10 for every 40 epochs. The augmentations are the same as [ref]18 . The hierarchical relationship, and the batch sampling strategy described in section 3.5 requires a careful implementation of the loss calculation. Since a pairing can be a positive pair at a lower level and a negative pair at a higher level, the loss computation is aggregated by layers, with the highest layers calculated first. Restructuring the losses to be computed at each level and aggregated to form the batch loss allows for direct tensor operations and greatly speeds up the computation. See Algorithm 1 for a PyTorch based pseudo code. Starting from the highest level, a N×N𝑁𝑁N\\times N pairing mask is constructed at each level where l​e​v​e​l​P​a​i​r​i​n​g​[i,j]=1𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑙𝑃𝑎𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑖𝑗1levelPairing[i,j]=1 iflabels[i]==labels[j]atlevellelse 0if\\;labels[i]==labels[j]\\;at\\;level\\;l\\;else\\;0. In the single-level scenario, l​e​v​e​l​P​a​i​r​i​n​g​s𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑙𝑃𝑎𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠levelPairings is only computed once, and all images of the same class will be set, reducing to Khosla et al. [ref]18. The l​e​v​e​l​L​o​s​s𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑙𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠levelLoss is defined in Eq. 4, 6 and 7 individually. In the unlabeled scenario, l​e​v​e​l​P​a​i​r​i​n​g​s𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑙𝑃𝑎𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠levelPairings will be a diagonal matrix, and this implementation reduces to SimCLR . \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeepFashion\nModelNet40\n\n\nSeen\nUnseen\nSeen\nUnseen\n\n\n\nSimCLR\n70.26\n68.12\n77.09\n72.26\n\nCross Entropy\n77.81\n71.94\n85.17\n79.77\n\nSupCon\n81.46\n73.93\n88.33\n79.28\n\nGuided\n79.34\n74.04\n89.01\n82.22\n\nHiMulCon\n80.54\n74.88\n89.28\n84.44\n\nHiConE\n80.67\n75.28\n89.09\n84.40\n\nHiMulConE\n80.52\n75.29\n89.45\n85.37\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: We adopt a pre-trained ResNet-50 [ref]14, which was trained on ImageNet [ref]7, as the encoder network.
