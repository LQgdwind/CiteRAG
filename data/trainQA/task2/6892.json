      "content": "Paper Title: Data-iterative Optimization Score Model for Stable Ultra-Sparse-View CT Reconstruction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComputed Tomography (CT) has garnered extensive utilization in both medical diagnosis due to its ability to provide practical and precise diagnostic outcomes . Sparse-view CT scanning emerges as a promising strategy to decrease radiation dose, wherein only a fraction of projection data is required for image reconstruction[ref]2 . However, the limited number of measurement views leads to a reduced acquisition  of prior information within imaged object, consequently yielding a deterioration in the image quality . Moreover, the diminished rank of the measurement matrix introduces an augmented array of potential solutions, impeding convergence and culminating in a heightened prevalence of uncertainties and inaccuracies  . Traditional reconstruction methods like filtered back-projection (FBP) yield unsatisfactory results, marked by streaking artifacts and poor image quality [ref]2. The advent of artificial intelligence has fostered the creation of advanced deep-learning techniques for enhancing sparse-view CT reconstruction. Notable examples of such techniques encompass FBP-ConvNet , Densenet Deconvolution Network 0, residual encoder-decoder convolutional neural network 1, generative adversarial network (CGAN) 2, and multi-domain integrative swin transformer 3, among others. These deep-learning approaches primarily hinge on supervised training with paired images to yield superior outcomes. Score-based generative models (SGMs) have risen to prominence due to their exceptional capability to precisely sample from intricate distributions 4 5. For example, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM)4, denoising diffusion restoration models (DDRM) 6, Denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) 7, Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) 5, etc. Typical SGMs follow a two-stage process consisting of a forward stage perturbing data to noise and a reverse stage converting noise back to data. The reverse process is usually achieved by parameterized deep neural networks, e.g., an SGM, which can be optimized with the training data. The power of SGM seamlessly extends to various applications within the field of medical image reconstruction 8 9, particularly in scenarios such as sparse-view CT reconstruction with remarkable achievements  . Data consistency in a score-based score-based model is to ensure that the generated samples or images adhere closely to the observed data distribution, which plays an important role for improving reconstructed image quality [ref]22. Data consistency acts as a constraint during the sampling process to align the generated samples with the actual data, improving the quality and realism of the generated samples . For a typical score-based generative model, the data consistency is enforced  by iteratively adjusting the generated samples based on the gradient of the log-likelihood of the observed data 5. This process aims to reduce the discrepancy between the generated samples and the real measurement data, resulting in better alignment and more accurate modeling of the underlying data distribution . By maintaining data consistency , the model becomes more capable of generating samples that are representative of the original data. These existing SGMs for sparse-view CT reconstruction mainly focus on performing the diffusion within sinogram-based and image-domain. In respect to the sinogram-based SGM, the data consistency is formatted by utilizing the generated full sinogram and the sampling location of the original sparse-view data. For instance, a notable advancement involves the integration of a fully unsupervised score-based generative model into the sinogram domain, effectively enhancing sparse-view CT reconstruction capabilities . Furthermore, a patch-based denoising diffusion probabilistic model was tailored and developed . In the image-domain context, the conventional data consistency hinges on a sparse-sampling mask 8. The data consistency process involves employing partial projections derived from the reconstructed image, wherein ùíöt=ùë®‚Äãùíôtsubscriptùíöùë°ùë®subscriptùíôùë°\\bm{y}_{t}=\\bm{Ax}_{t}, signifying the system matrix ùë®ùë®\\bm{A} and reconstructed image ùíôtsubscriptùíôùë°\\bm{x}_{t} at time step tùë°t. However, owing to the inherent imperfections within the interim ùíötsubscriptùíöùë°\\bm{y}_{t}, inaccuracies manifest in the estimated data ùíöùíï‚Ä≤=m‚Äãa‚Äãs‚Äãk‚àóùíö+(1‚àím‚Äãa‚Äãs‚Äãk)‚àóùíötsuperscriptsubscriptùíöùíïbold-‚Ä≤ùëöùëéùë†ùëòùíö1ùëöùëéùë†ùëòsubscriptùíöùë°\\bm{y_{t}^{{}^{\\prime}}}=mask*\\bm{y}+(1-mask)*\\bm{y}_{t} (ùíöùíö\\bm{y} is the sparse-view data), which in turn contributes to data consistency discrepancies, subsequently introducing secondary artifacts in the reconstruction process. Moreover, past investigations frequently updated the data consistency and generative model as separate entities, disregarding the intrinsic link between these modules [ref]22. These approaches not only hinder the model‚Äôs ability to converge to a stable reconstruction outcome but can also exacerbate the inherent instability within the reconstruction process. Overcoming the lack of precise data consistency constraints is a significant challenge when striving for high-quality image reconstructions, especially in the context of ultra-sparse-view CT reconstruction . In this scenario, the sparse-view sampling mask can introduce projection errors, leading to the presence of erroneous artifacts . To mitigate inaccuracies in projection, a more effective approach involves utilizing measurement data solely for establishing data consistency, defined as ‚Äñùíö‚àíùë®‚Äãùíô‚Äñ22superscriptsubscriptnormùíöùë®ùíô22\\|\\bm{y}-\\bm{Ax}\\|_{2}^{2}. This approach ensures the generation of reliable reconstruction outcomes. Importantly, the focus of data consistency should be directed towards ùíô0subscriptùíô0\\bm{x}_{0} rather than ùíôtsubscriptùíôùë°\\bm{x}_{t} at time tùë°t. In simpler terms, when ùíö‚â†ùë®‚Äãùíôtùíöùë®subscriptùíôùë°\\bm{y}\\neq\\bm{Ax}_{t}, it becomes insufficient to drive the generation process towards satisfactory results. A viable solution is to enforce data consistency as ‚Äñùíö‚àíùë®‚Äãùíô0‚Äã(ùíôt)‚Äñ22superscriptsubscriptnormùíöùë®subscriptùíô0subscriptùíôùë°22\\|\\bm{y}-\\bm{Ax}_{0}(\\bm{x}_{t})\\|_{2}^{2}. However, a significant challenge arises in establishing an explicit relationship between ùíôtsubscriptùíôùë°\\bm{x}_{t} and ùíô0subscriptùíô0\\bm{x}_{0}. This is due to the fact that p‚Äã(ùíô0)ùëùsubscriptùíô0p(\\bm{x}_{0}) follows a posterior distribution, which remains unknown during the inference stage [ref]22 . Furthermore, it is imperative to devise a viable approach for augmenting the coherence between the data consistency and generative update. This strategy‚Äôs purpose should encompass the simultaneous constraint of both data consistency and generative outcomes, effectively capturing the intricate correlations inherent to these two modules. To fully harness the potential of data consistency within the score-based model for tackling inverse problems, pursuing a strategy that explores this avenue comprehensively is both valuable and promising. In this paper, we introduce an innovative data consistency component to the SDE, which serves as a valuable constraint in the context of ultra-sparse-view CT reconstruction. We term this framework the Data-iterative Optimization Score-based Model (DOSM). The distinctive aspect of this new data consistency element lies in its utilization of solely the original measurement data to confine the outcomes of generation, effectively sidestepping any undesirable structures. Furthermore, we establish a pioneering inference strategy that traces back from ùíôtsubscriptùíôùë°\\bm{x}_{t} to ùíô^0subscriptbold-^ùíô0\\bm{\\hat{x}}_{0} using a solid theoretical foundation at any time tùë°t. In contrast to prevailing state-of-the-art techniques, our approach exhibits a noteworthy enhancement in both image quality and quantitative outcomes (PSNR and SSIM), as indicated in Fig. 1. The significant contributions made by this study can be succinctly outlined as follows: We ingeniously devise a novel data consistency term that harmoniously balances the constraints from measurement data and the generative model. This seamless integration facilitates the capture of intricate correlations and significantly enhances their alignment. By fusing this innovative data consistency approach with an SDE, we introduce an entirely new score-based model for ultra-sparse-view CT reconstruction. We develop an innovative and adaptable inference strategy that elegantly traces from ùíôtsubscriptùíôùë°\\bm{x}_{t} back to its initial counterpart ùíô^0subscriptbold-^ùíô0\\bm{\\hat{x}}_{0}. Remarkably, as the number of iterations decreases, the accuracy of the estimated ùíô^0subscriptbold-^ùíô0\\bm{\\hat{x}}_{0} improves significantly. The estimated ùíô^0subscriptbold-^ùíô0\\bm{\\hat{x}}_{0} is introduced into the formulated data consistency for formulating a novel unified reconstruction model. We employ a suitable solving algorithm to optimize the established score-based Model. To ensure solution stability, we incorporate the wisdom of the conventional iteration reconstruction technique to optimize the update of data consistency. The efficacy and advantages of our proposed approach are meticulously examined and evaluated. We validate our method using extensive sparse-view CT datasets, encompassing both numerical simulations and real clinical cardiac data, showcasing its superior reconstruction performance in comparison to state-of-the-art alternatives.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: and precise diagnostic outcomes .
