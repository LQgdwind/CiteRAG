Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Align All the Nodes: Scalable Learning of Flexible Latent Structure for Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider a diverse set of datasets for experiments and present detailed dataset information in Appendix¬†D. For implementation, we set œÉùúé\\sigma as sigmoid function and œÑùúè\\tau as 0.25 for all datasets. The output prediction layer is a one-layer MLP. More implementation details are presented in Appendix¬†C.\nAll experiments are conducted on a NVIDIA V100 with\n16 GB memory. As baseline models, we basically consider GCN¬† and GAT¬†[ref]36. Besides, we compare with some advanced GNN models, including JKNet¬†4 and MixHop¬†.\nThese GNN models all rely on input graphs.\nWe further consider DropEdge¬† and\ntwo SOTA graph structure learning methods, LDS-GNN¬†1 and IDGL¬† for comparison. For large-scale datasets, we additionally compare with two scalable GNNs, a linear model SGC¬†[ref]39 and a graph-sampling model GraphSAINT¬†8. More detailed information about these models are presented in Appendix¬†C.\nAll the experiments are repeated five times with different initializations.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: is a one-layer MLP.
