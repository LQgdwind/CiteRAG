      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Feature Learning with Emergent Data-Driven Prototypicality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe design several experiments to show the effectiveness of HACK for the semantic and prototypical organization. First, we first construct a dataset with known prototypicality¬†using the congealing algorithm . Then, we apply HACK to datasets with unknown prototypicality¬†to organize the samples based on the semantic and prototypical structure. Finally, we show that the prototypical structure can be used to reduce sample complexity and increase model robustness.\n Datasets. We first construct a dataset called Congealed MNIST. To verify the efficacy of HACK for unsupervised prototypicality¬†discovery, we need a benchmark with known prototypical examples. However, currently there is no standard benchmark for this purpose. To construct the benchmark, we use the congealing algorithm from  to align the images in each class of MNIST . The congealing algorithm is initially used for one-shot classification. During congealing, the images are brought into correspondence with each other jointly. The congealed images are more prototypical: they are better aligned with the average image. In Figure 2, we show the original images and the images after congealing. The original images are transformed via affine transformation to better align with each other. The synthetic data is generated by replacing 500 original images with the corresponding congealed images. In Section E of the Appendix, we show the results of changing the number of replaced original images. We expect HACK to discover the congealed images and place them in the center of the Poincar√© ball. We also aim to discover the prototypical examples from each class of the standard MNIST dataset  and CIFAR10 . CIFAR10 consists of 60000 from 10 object categories ranging from airplane to truck. CIFAR10 is more challenging than MNIST since it has larger intra-class variations.\n Baselines. We consider several existing metrics proposed in [ref]5 for prototypicality¬†discovery, the details can be found in Section C of the Appendix. Holdout Retraining [ref]5: We consider the Holdout Retraining proposed in [ref]5. The idea is that the distance of features of prototypical examples obtained from models trained on different datasets should be close. Model Confidence: Intuitively, the model should be confident in prototypical examples. Thus, it is natural to use the confidence of the model prediction as the criterion for prototypicality. Implementation Details. We implement HACK in PyTorch and the code will be made public. To generate uniform particles, we first randomly initialize the particles and then run the training for 1000 epochs to minimize the repulsion loss and boundary loss. The learning rate is 0.01. The curvature of the Poincar√© ball is 1.0 and the rùëür is 0.76 which is used to alleviate the numerical issues [ref]15. The hyperparameter kùëòk is 1.55 which is shown to generate uniform particles well. For the assignment, we use a LeNet  for MNIST and a ResNet20  for CIFAR10 as the encoder. We apply HACK to each class separately. We attach a fully connected layer to project the feature into a two-dimensional Euclidean space. The image features are further projected onto hyperbolic space via an exponential map. We run the training for 200 epochs using a cosine learning rate scheduler  with an initial learning rate of 0.1. We optimize the assignment every other epoch. All the experiments are run on a NVIDIA TITAN RTX GPU.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: 10 object categories ranging from airplane to truck.
