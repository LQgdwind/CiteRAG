      "content": "Paper Title: DiverGAN: An Efficient and Effective Single-Stage Framework for Diverse Text-to-Image Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe goal of text-to-image synthesis is to automatically yield perceptually plausible pictures, given textual descriptions. Recently, this topic rapidly gained attention in computer-vision and natural-language processing communities due to its extensive range of potential real-world applications including art creation, computer-aid design, data augmentation for training image classifiers, photo-editing, the education of young children, etc. Nevertheless, text-to-image generation is still an extremely challenging cross-modal task, since it not only requires a thorough semantic understanding of natural-language descriptions, but also requires a conversion of textual-context features into high-resolution images. The common paradigm involves a deep generative model implementing the cross-domain information fusion. Thanks to the recent advances in the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) , current text-to-image approaches have made tremendous progress in image quality and semantic consistency when given natural-language descriptions as inputs.\nExisting text-to-image approaches can be roughly cast into two types. The first category adopts a multi-stage modular architecture  [ref]4  [ref]6    constructed with multiple generators and corresponding discriminators, producing visually realistic samples in a coarse-to-fine manner.\nSimultaneously, the output of the initial-stage network is fed into a next-stage network to generate an image with a higher resolution.\nWhile such a text-to-image procedure has been proven to be useful for the generation task, it requires training of several networks and is thus time-consuming [ref]1. Even worse, the convergence and stability of the final generator network heavily relies on the earlier generators . To address the issues mentioned above, a second category of text-to-image synthesis methods has been recently studied in [ref]1 , merely leveraging a generator/discriminator pair to produce photo-realistic images which semantically align with corresponding textual descriptions.\nThanks to the power of deep generative neural networks, feature fusion and generation process can be integrated into one single-stage procedure. However, the methods in this second category achieve structural simplicity and superior performance, but there still exist two significant issues. Firstly, these approaches suffer from the mode-collapse problem , in which the generator derails and synthesizes an inappropriate image for the text input. In less unfortunate cases of mode collapse, the CGAN generates a set of very similar output images, conditioned on the single natural-language description at the input. As shown in Fig. 1, DF-GAN [ref]1 fails to produce diverse samples, although noise is present on the input.\nThis serious obstacle will drastically degrade the diversity of generated images, limiting their applicability in practice. For instance in data augmentation, robust\nclassification can only be achieved if a wide range of shapes was generated.\nSecondly, existing single-stage approaches modulate the feature map by just adopting a global sentence vector, which lacks detailed and fine-grained information at the word level, and prevents the model from manipulating parts of the image generation according to natural-language descriptions and qualifications  [ref]6. One possible explanation for the lack-of-diversity issue is that the single-stage generator focuses more on the textual-context information that is high-dimensional and structured but ignores the random latent code which is responsible for variations .\nConsidering the fact that single-stage methods usually utilize modulation modules to reinforce the visual feature map for each scale in order to ensure image quality and semantic consistency, the conditional contexts are likely to provide stronger control over the output image than the latent code, and thus, the generator yields nearly identical instances from a single text description. In this paper, we propose to develop an efficient and effective single-stage framework (DiverGAN) for yielding diverse and visually plausible instances that correspond well to the textual contexts.\nDiverGAN consists of four novel components discussed as follows.\n Firstly, in order to stabilize the learning of the CGAN and boost the visual-semantic embedding in the visual feature map, Conditional Adaptive Instance-Layer Normalization (CAdaILN) is introduced to normalize the feature map in the layer and channel while employing the detailed and fine-grained linguistic cues to scale and shift the normalized feature map. Moreover, CAdaILN can help with flexibly controlling the amount of change in shape and texture, allowing for deeper networks and complementing the following modulation modules.\nFor example, a good generator should be able to respond to the requirements specified by textual qualifiers for size (’large’) and/or color (’red’). Secondly,\nwe design two new types of word-level attention modules, i.e., a channel-attention module (CAM) and a pixel-attention module (PAM). These modules\ncapture the semantic affinities between word-context vectors and feature maps in the channels and in the (2D) spatial dimensions. CAM and PAM not only guide the model to focus more on the crucial channels and pixels that are semantically correlated with the prominent words (e.g., adjectives and nouns) in the given textual description, but also alleviate the impact of semantically irrelevant and redundant information. More importantly, with CAM and PAM, DiverGAN can effectively disentangle the attributes of the text description while accurately controlling the regions of synthetic images. Thirdly, we present a dual-residual block constructed with two residual modules, each of which contains convolutional layers, CAdaILN, exploiting a ReLU activation function followed by a modulation module. The dual-residual block not only benefits the CGAN convergence by retaining more original visual features, but also efficiently improves network capacity, resulting in high-quality images, with more details. The text-to-image pipeline built upon the above three ingredients is enough to be capable of producing perceptually realistic images semantically matching with the natural-language descriptions but still suffers from the lack-of-diversity problem. Therefore, as the fourth remedy we propose, on the basis of a variety of experiments, to use a linear layer which significantly boosts the generative ability of the network. This dense layer forces the generator to explore a wider range of modes in the original data distribution. In other words, plugging a linear layer into the single-stage architecture will improve the control of a random latent code over the visual feature map, balancing the trade-off between a random latent code contributing to diversity and modulation modules that modulate the feature map based on word-context vectors. Simultaneously, the experimental results will indicate that inserting a linear layer after the second dual-residual block of the architecture achieves the best performance on visual quality and image diversity. As illustrated in Fig. 1, our DiverGAN equipped with a fully-connected layer is capable of generating birds with different visual appearances of footholds, background colors, orientations and shapes on the CUB bird data set . We perform comprehensive experiments on three benchmark data sets, i.e., Oxford-102 , CUB bird  and MS COCO .\nBoth quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed DiverGAN has the capacity to synthesize impressively better images than current single-stage and multi-stage models including StackGAN++ [ref]4, MSGAN , SDGAN , DMGAN , DF-GAN [ref]1, DTGAN . The contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: ∙∙\\bullet We establish a novel single-stage architecture for the text-to-image synthesis task. Our framework mitigates the lack-of-diversity issue, producing diverse and high-resolution samples that are semantically correlated with textural descriptions. ∙∙\\bullet CAdaILN is introduced to stabilize training as well as help modulation modules flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture. ∙∙\\bullet Two new types of word-level attention modules are designed to reinforce visual feature maps with word-context vectors. ∙∙\\bullet To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to embed one fully-connected layer into the single-stage pipeline to deal with the lack-of-diversity issue in text-to-image generation. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review related works. Section 3 briefly introduces the basic theories of a GAN, a CGAN, mode collapse and dot-product attention. In Section 4, we describe the proposed DiverGAN in detail. Section 5 reports the experimental results and the paper is summarized in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: consistency when given natural-language descriptions as inputs.\nExisting text-to-image approaches can be roughly cast into two types.
