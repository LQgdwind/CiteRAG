      "content": "Paper Title: Dimensionality Reduction for 𝑘-Distance Applied to Persistent Homology\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma\n states that any subset of\nn𝑛n points of Euclidean space can be embedded in a space of\ndimension O​(ε−2​log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝜀2𝑛O({\\varepsilon}^{-2}\\log n) with (1±ε)plus-or-minus1𝜀(1\\pm{\\varepsilon})\ndistortion. We use the notion of an ε𝜀{\\varepsilon}-distortion map with respect to P𝑃P (also commonly called a Johnson-Lindenstrauss map). Given a point set P⊂ℝD𝑃superscriptℝ𝐷P\\subset{\\mathbb{R}}^{D}, and ε∈(0,1)𝜀01{\\varepsilon}\\in(0,1), a mapping f:ℝD→ℝd:𝑓→superscriptℝ𝐷superscriptℝ𝑑f:{\\mathbb{R}}^{D}\\to{\\mathbb{R}}^{d} for some\nd≤D𝑑𝐷d\\leq D is an ε𝜀{\\varepsilon}-distortion map with respect to P𝑃P, if for all x,y∈P𝑥𝑦𝑃x,y\\in P, A random variable X𝑋X with mean zero is said to be subgaussian with subgaussian norm K𝐾K if\n𝔼⁡[exp⁡(X2/K2)]≤2𝔼superscript𝑋2superscript𝐾22\\operatorname{\\mathbb{E}}\\left[\\exp\\left(X^{2}/K^{2}\\right)\\right]\\leq 2. In this case, the tails of the random variable satisfy We focus on the case where the Johnson-Lindenstrauss embedding is carried out via random subgaussian matrices,\ni.e., matrices where for some given K>0𝐾0K>0, each entry is an independent subgaussian random variable with subgaussian norm K𝐾K.\nThis case is general enough to include the mappings of Achlioptas ,\nAilon and Chazelle , Dasgupta and Gupta 4,\nIndyk, Motwani, Raghavan, and Vempala 4, and Matoušek [ref]30\n(see Dirksen for a unified treatment 5). Given 0<ε,δ<1formulae-sequence0𝜀𝛿10<{\\varepsilon},\\delta<1, and a finite point set P⊂ℝD𝑃superscriptℝ𝐷P\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{D} of size |P|=n𝑃𝑛|P|=n.\nThen a random linear mapping f:ℝD→ℝd:𝑓→superscriptℝ𝐷superscriptℝ𝑑f\\colon\\mathbb{R}^{D}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{d}\nwhere d=O​(ε−2​log⁡n)𝑑𝑂superscript𝜀2𝑛d=O({\\varepsilon}^{-2}\\log n) given by f​(v)=Dd​G​v𝑓𝑣𝐷𝑑𝐺𝑣f(v)=\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{d}}Gv\nwhere G𝐺G is a d×D𝑑𝐷d\\times D subgaussian random matrix,\nis an ε𝜀{\\varepsilon}-distortion map with respect to P𝑃P, with probability at least 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta. For ease of recall, we shall refer to a random linear\nmapping f:ℝD→ℝd:𝑓→superscriptℝ𝐷superscriptℝ𝑑f\\colon\\mathbb{R}^{D}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{d}\ngiven by f​(v)=Dd​G​v𝑓𝑣𝐷𝑑𝐺𝑣f(v)=\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{d}}Gv\nwhere G𝐺G is a d×D𝑑𝐷d\\times D subgaussian random matrix, as a\nsubgaussian ε𝜀{\\varepsilon}-distortion map. While in the version given here the dimension of the embedding depends on the number of points in P𝑃P and subgaussian projections,\nthe JL lemma has been generalized and extended in several different directions, some of which are briefly outlined below. The\ngeneralization of the results of this paper to these more general settings is straightforward.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: with subgaussian norm K𝐾K.\nThis case is general enough to include the mappings of Achlioptas ,\nAilon and Chazelle , Dasgupta and Gupta 4,\nIndyk, Motwani, Raghavan, and Vempala 4, and Matoušek [ref]30\n(see Dirksen for a unified treatment 5).

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
