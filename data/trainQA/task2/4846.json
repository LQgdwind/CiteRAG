      "content": "Paper Title: CPSAA: Accelerating Sparse Attention using Crossbar-based Processing-In-Memory Architecture\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAttention-based neural network shows accuracy leaps in machine learning applications, e. g., natural language processing (NLP)  and computer vision [ref]8. Different from the commonly used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, Transformer [ref]30 adopts a pure attention-based neural network to better identify the dependencies between tokens of the input sequence. Following this design, Transformer and its variants achieve great accuracy improvement in NLP tasks , such as machine translation [ref]30 and question answering , etc. Attention is also widely used in computer vision tasks [ref]8 including image classification  and object detection 8, etc. The vanilla attention mechanism [ref]30 is usually implemented as DDMM and softmax operations. By computing an attention score matrix, the attention mechanism can pay attention to these relevant token pairs. There is overwhelming computation pressure in processing these irrelevant token pairs, leading to intolerable execution time [ref]7. Researchers propose sparse attention by adding a sparsity pruning phase before the attention calculation to reduce irrelevant calculations [ref]7 9, since most tokens in the input sequence are unrelated to the current query. There are two types of sparse attention designs, i.e., software-based and software-hardware co-design methods 9. Software-based methods   aim to propose various optimization algorithms to reduce computational overhead by increasing sparsity. Software-hardware co-design solutions accelerate sparse attention by taking advantage of high-parallelism hardware, such as Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)  6 and Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) 9 [ref]7 . The above solutions only achieve limited speedups since both the sparsity pruning and attention calculation phases involve many off-chip data transfers. Emerging crossbar-based architectures are promising to solve the off-chip data transmission problem, such as Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) and ReRAM-based content addressable memory (ReCAM) 2. ReCAM is suitable for high parallel comparison, the core operation of content-based similarity search in the attention mechanism. ReRAM is ideal for vector-matrix multiplication (VMM) operation, which has superior performance handling the DDMM operations of attention-based neural network. Utilizing the in-situ processing ability of ReRAM arrays, there emerge ReRAM-based PIM-featured solutions to accelerate traditional neural network  and the dense attention mechanism  1. However, these PIM-based solutions can hardly extend to accelerate the sparse attention for the following reasons. First, the ReRAM array’s write overhead cannot be ignored as it is in ReRAM-based CNN and RNN accelerators. Solving the ReRAM write overhead is urgent because many matrices in the attention mechanism cannot be reused and need to be written in runtime. Second, the sparse attention involves the sparsity pruning phase, which is not considered by current dense attention accelerators. Using the current software-based pruning algorithm can promote the PIM-based attention accelerator. However, the software-based pruning methods have poor performance because they need to load all input matrices from the off-chip memory to the processor. Moreover, the sparsity of the attention mechanism is pretty unstructured, which will introduce lots of off-chip random memory access to the attention calculation phase. Finally, the sparse attention involves the SDDMM and SpMM operations. Direct application of current ReRAM-based sparse methods 7  to ReRAM-based SDDMM and SpMM operations will achieve inferior performance (for details to see §​IV-C§IV-C\\S~{}\\ref{sdd} and §​IV-D§IV-D\\S~{}\\ref{SpMM}). Given this landscape, we propose CPSAA, a novel Crossbar-based PIM-featured Sparse Attention Accelerator. First, we design the attention calculation mode to increase the parallelism of CPSAA dataflow while hiding ReRAM writing overhead. Second, we design a novel PIM-based sparsity pruning architecture to support our calculation mode while removing the off-chip data transmissions. Finally, we couple ReRAM and ReCAM arrays and propose new PIM-based SDDMM and SpMM methods to utilize the unstructured sparsity. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: We propose CPSAA, a PIM-based sparse attention accelerator, to speed up both the pruning and attention calculation phases of the neural network inference. We design the pruning phase as a novel PIM architecture to eliminate off-chip data transfers. The attention calculation architecture involves novel ReRAM-based SDDMM and SpMM methods to increase the parallelism of sparse attention. We evaluate and compare CPSAA with state-of-the-art attention mechanism solutions. The experimental results show that CPSAA has performance improvement in speedups and energy-saving.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Attention-based neural network shows accuracy leaps in machine learning applications, e. g., natural language processing (NLP)  and computer vision [ref]8.
