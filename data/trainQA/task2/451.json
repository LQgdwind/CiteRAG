      "content": "Paper Title: Enhanced back-translation for low resource neural machine translation using self-trainingSupported by NITDEF PhD Scholarship Scheme 2018.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe neural machine translation (NMT)    is currently the simplest and yet the state-of-the-art approach for training improved translation systems [ref]4 . They out-perform other statistical machine translation approaches if there exists a large amount of parallel data between the languages  . Given the “right” amount of qualitative parallel data only, the models can learn the probability of mapping sentences in the source language to their equivalents in another language – the target language . This “right” amount of qualitative parallel data is usually very large and, therefore, expensive to compile because it requires manual translation. The absence of large amounts of high-quality parallel data in many languages has led to various proposals for leveraging the abundant monolingual data that exists in either or both of the languages. These approaches include the self-training , forward translation 0, back-translation [ref]4 1 2 3, dual learning 5 and transfer learning  6 7 8. The back-translation has been used in current state-of-the-art neural machine translation systems [ref]4 9 0, outperforming other approaches in high resource languages and improving performance in low resource conditions [ref]4 1 2. The approach involves training a target-to-source (backward) model on the available parallel data and using that model to generate synthetic translations of a large number of monolingual sentences in the target language. The available authentic parallel data is then mixed with the generated synthetic parallel data without differentiating between the two 1 to train a final source-to-target (forward) model. The quality of the forward translation model depends on the NMT architecture used in building the models 1, the quality of the backward model 1 3 4, the suitability of the synthetic data generation method used [ref]4 5 and the ratio of the authentic data to the synthetic data 6 7. In low resource NMT, the authentic parallel data available is not sufficient to train a backward model that will generate qualitative synthetic data. Thus, various methods have been proposed to improve the quality of the backward model despite the lack of sufficient parallel data. Hoang et al. 1 and Zhang et al. 3 used an iterative approach to enable the forward model to generate synthetic data that will be used to improve the backward model. Imamura et al. 2 suggest generating multiple synthetic sources through sampling given a target sentence. Niu et al 2 trained a bilingual model for both the backward and forward translations and they reported improvement in low resource translations. Graca et al. 5 proposed that selecting the most suitable synthetic data generation method will help reduce the inadequacies of the backward model. Dabre et al. 7 and Kocmi and Bojar 8 proposed the use of a high-resource parent language pair through transfer learning to improve the backward model. This work proposes the use of self-training – also referred within the document as self-learning and forward translation – 8 0  approach to improve the backward model. The output of the backward model – which is ideally used with the authentic data to train the forward model in back-translation – is used to improve the backward model itself. The self-training approach used is similar to that in 8 0  where a synthetic target-side data is used to improve the performance of the translation model instead of the synthetic source-side data in back-translation. But instead of using the approach to enhance the final model, we aim to enhance the backward model which then generates improved synthetic data for enhancing the final model. We also simplify the approach by removing the need for synthetic data quality estimation  or freezing of training parameters 0. The work is similar to the iterative back-translation of Hoang et al. 1 and Zhang et al. 3. The iterative back-translation requires the use of the monolingual source and target data to improve the backward and forward models respectively. The backward model generates synthetic sources to improve the forward model while the forward does the same for the backward model. This process is repeated iteratively until the required quality of translations are obtained. Instead, this work relies only on the monolingual target data to improve both models. Whereas the approaches above perform iterative back-translation to improve both models, our work uses forward translation (self-learning) to improve the backward model and back-translation to improve the forward model. It was shown by Specia and Shah  and Zhang and Zong 0 that using the monolingual source – or the synthetic target – data will potentially reduce the performance of the decoder. To mitigate this, Ueffing 8 and Specia and Shah  used quality estimation 9 to determine the best-translated sentences to be used to retraining, while Zhang and Zong 0 proposed freezing the parameters of the decoder when training the model on the synthetic data. In this work, we showed that the self-learning approach is capable of improving a translation model even without synthetic data cleaning or freezing any learned parameters. We hypothesize that the amount of parallel data used in retraining the model is sufficient to improve the quality of the model if the model can differentiate between and learn effectively from the synthetic and natural data.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: The neural machine translation (NMT)    is currently the simplest and yet the state-of-the-art approach for training improved translation systems [ref]4 .
