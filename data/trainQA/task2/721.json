      "content": "Paper Title: Coded Elastic Computing on Machines with Heterogeneous Storage and Computation Speed\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCoding is an effective tool to speed up distributed computing networks and has attracted significant attention recently. Examples include Coded Distributed Computing (CDC) for MapReduce-like frameworks [ref]2 [ref]3        \nand coded data shuffling for distributed machine learning   , where code designs minimize the communication load by trading increased computation resources and/or storage on each machine. Another example is to use codes to mitigate the straggler effect in applications such as linear operations    \nand matrix multiplications   , where any subset of machines with a cardinality larger than the recovery threshold can recover the matrix multiplication. This eliminates the need to wait for the computation of slow machines. Moreover, coding has also been applied to the computing problems integrated with optimizations  and with the requirements of security  [ref]24, privacy   [ref]24  and robustness . In this paper, we will consider another important and novel application of coding in order to cope with the elasticity in distributed and cloud computing systems . Coded Elastic Computing (CEC) was introduced by Yang et al. in 2018 to mitigate the impact of preempted machines on a storage limited distributed computing network . As opposed to stragglers, whose identities are unknown when computations are assigned, the preempted (unavailable) machines are known. Hence, while it is necessary to bring computation redundancy into the straggler mitigation problem, it is desired to have no computation redundancy in the elastic computing problem. In elastic computing, computations are performed over many times steps and between each time step an elastic event may occur where machines become preempted or available again. Computations are performed on the same set of data, e.g., a matrix, while the computations change each time step. For example, in each time step the data matrix may be multiplied with a different vector. In each time step, the goal becomes to assign computations among the available machines such that the overall computation time can be minimized. A naive approach is to assign each machine a non-overlapping part of the data. However, this is inefficient as the storage placement has to be redefined with each elastic event. In homogeneous CEC proposed in , where all machines have the same storage space and computing speed, the storage of each machine is placed once using a Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) code and remains unchanged between elastic events. The data is split into LùêøL equal sized, disjoint data sets and each machine stores a coded combination of these sets. For the state-of-the-art design , each machine stores a unique and coded 1L1ùêø\\frac{1}{L} fraction (in size) of the original data library. Furthermore, since all the machines have the same computing speed, in order to minimize the overall computation time,\nall the machines are assigned an equal number of computations (e.g., number of vector-vector multiplications). The requirement for CEC is to allow any computation task (e.g., matrix-vector multiplications) be resolved by combining the coded computation results of LùêøL machines.\nThis means that the computation tasks have to be assigned to these LùêøL available machines while keeping the computation redundancy to a minimum.\nThe authors of  proposed a novel ‚Äúcyclic‚Äù computation assignment such that each machine is assigned by the same number computations and no computation redundancy is present. The recent work  also studies the homogeneous CEC and aims to maximize the overlap of the task assignments between computation time steps. With each elastic event, the computation assignment must change. In the cyclic approach proposed in , the assignments in the current time step are independent of assignments in previous time steps. In , the authors design assignment schemes to minimize the changes in the assignments between time steps. In some cases, the proposed assignment schemes were shown to achieve zero ‚Äútransition waste‚Äù, or no new local computations at the existing machines. The works of  and  only study homogeneous CEC networks. However, in practice, the available computing machines in a cloud system are often heterogeneous due to the fact that even if all the machines are homogeneous, one machine could be used by multiple users simultaneously and each user may have different computation and storage demands. When machines have varying storage space and computing speeds or capabilities, the previous CEC designs are sub-optimal. For example, in  and , each machine is assigned the same amount of computations. If one machine is faster it will be idle waiting for slower machines to finish. The problem of heterogeneous computation assignment is challenging because we must ensure that each computation is performed on LùêøL coded data sets while meeting some optimal computation load of each machine based on the relative computing speeds of the machines such that the overall computation time can be minimized. Moreover, the previous designs assume each machine is capable of storing a 1L1ùêø\\frac{1}{L} fraction of the data, or one coded data set. If machines have varying storage requirements then to use the designs of  and , either machines with less storage are excluded or machines with more storage do not utilize their entire storage. In this paper, we propose a CEC framework optimized for a heterogeneous network where machines have varying computation speeds and storage requirements such that the overall computation time is minimized. We represent the relative speed of the machines by a speed vector ùíî‚àà‚Ñù+Nùíîsuperscriptsubscript‚ÑùùëÅ\\boldsymbol{s}\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N} and the storage capacity of the machines by a storage vector ùùà‚àà‚Ñ§+Nùùàsuperscriptsubscript‚Ñ§ùëÅ\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{+}^{N}. The latter represents an integer number of coded data sets each machine can store and imposes a limit on the amount of computations each machine can be assigned. Under this framework, as much as the storage allows, more computations are assigned to faster machines and less to slower machines in a systematic way to minimize the overall computation time while maintaining MDS code requirements.\n\nThe main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to adopt the performance metric of overall computation time to optimize the computation assignment for CEC networks while making use of MDS codes.\nWe introduce a class of computation assignments for CEC networks in which computations are distributed\nover common row sets (with possibly different sizes) across all machines, and the optimization of computation assignment is performed through an iterative algorithm which identifies the row sets and the machines that compute them. These lead to a novel combinatorial optimization framework that finds\nthe optimal assignment for minimal overall computation time.\n As opposed to other existing works on CEC networks that focus on homogeneous networks, our study applies to general CEC networks in which machines can have both heterogeneous computation speed and storage capacity. We develop a novel approach to solve the optimal computation assignment by utilizing both types of heterogeneity under a unified optimization framework. Particularly, we show that the optimal computation assignment can be determined based on an ordering of each machine‚Äôs storage capacity to computation speed ratio (SCR). The overall computation time of the optimal computation assignment is limited by machines with the largest SCR.\n We solve the proposed combinatorial optimization problem exactly by decomposing it into two sub-problems. The first is a relaxed convex optimization problem to determine the computation load of each machine without specifying the exact computation assignment. The second is a computation assignment problem (or a ‚Äúfilling problem‚Äù) to find the exact computation assignment across machines while meeting the optimal computation load obtained from the first sub-problem and the MDS code requirement. Under the proposed optimization framework, after solving the first sub-problem for the optimal computation load, we can adapt an iterative filling algorithm (previously developed for setting of private information retrieval ) to find the exact computation assignment in the second sub-problem.\nThe adapted algorithm for the new setting of CEC networks\nconverges within a number of iterations no greater than the number of available machines. This leads to a low-complexity design of optimal computation assignment for large CEC networks with an arbitrary set of machine computing speeds and storage requirements.  The paper is organized as follows. In Section¬†II, we present the network model and introduce the proposed problem formulation. Before going into details of the proposed solutions, in Section¬†III, we give examples of the proposed CEC algorithms for two scenarios, which are networks with 1) heterogeneous computing speeds and homogeneous storage space and 2) heterogeneous computing speeds and heterogeneous storage capacity. The proposed combinatorial optimization problem is solved in two steps in Section¬†IV and Section¬†V, where the proposed low-complexity CEC computation assignment algorithms are introduced. The paper is concluded in Section¬†VI.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: is an effective tool to speed up distributed computing networks and has attracted significant attention recently.
