We consider seven state-of-the-art TGNN models — JODIE, DyRep, TGN, TGAT, NeurTW, CAWN, and NAT  [ref]2 [ref]3    [ref]7.\nWe summarize the anatomy results of these models in Table 1.\nJODIE  models the dynamic evolution of user-item interactions through joint user and item embeddings, which are updated by two RNNs.\nFurthermore, JODIE trains a temporal attention layer to predict trajectories.\nDyRep [ref]2 implements a temporal attention mechanism to encode the evolution of temporal structure information into interleaved and nonlinear dynamics over time.\nTGN [ref]3 establishes a memory module to memorize node representations, and uses RNN and graph operators to update the memory.\nTGAT  utilizes self-attention to aggregate temporal-topological structure, and learns the temporal evolution of node embeddings through a continuous-time encoding.\nCAWN  samples a set of causal anonymous walks (CAWs) by temporal random walks, retrieves motifs to represent network dynamics, and encodes and aggregates these CAWs via RNNs.\nNeurTW  introduces a spatio-temporal random walk to retrieve representative motifs and irregularly-sampled temporal nodes, and then learns time-aware node representations.\nNAT [ref]7 constructs structural features using joint neighborhoods of different nodes, and designs a data structure to support parallel access and update of node representations. The Landscape of TGNNs.\nAs seen in Table 1,\nthe abovementioned models choose different techniques and perform different tasks (some do not implement the node classification task [ref]2  [ref]7 ).\nRegarding the datasets,\nthey choose different dimensions (e.g., 2, 4, 32, 128, and 172) for the initial node features and cause potentially inconsistent results.\nRegarding negative edge sampler, both fixed  [ref]2 [ref]3 and random    [ref]7 seeds are used.\nRegarding node visibility,\nJODIE, DyRep, TGN, TGAT, and NAT choose traditional transductive and inductive settings, while\nCAWN and NeurTW further consider inductive New-New and inductive New-Old settings.\nBesides, most models only report model performance metrics and neglect efficiency metrics.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: handle temporal graphs?\nAre there problems and inconsistencies during their processing procedures?

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
