      "content": "Paper Title: ROVER: RTL Optimization via Verified E-Graph Rewriting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatapath synthesis is the process of generating gate level netlists from higher-level arithmetic circuit designs expressed in RTL. Zimmermann decomposes this process into three steps: RTL extraction of arithmetic operations, followed by high-level arithmetic optimizations, and finally netlist generation¬†. Such datapath optimization engines form a core component of all logic and high-level synthesis tools and are essential for generating state-of-the-art circuit designs. Logic synthesis tools implement a range of hardware-specific optimizations, detecting opportunities to merge particular operator sequences and exploit redundant number representations¬†. Synopsys Design Compiler provides datapath coding guidelines, which describe how designers can best exploit the synthesis tool‚Äôs capabilities¬†. Of particular relevance is the front-end logic synthesis pass that performs datapath extraction, which clusters operators into datapath blocks¬†. Extracting larger clusters enables more effective downstream optimization. Datapath clustering can be prevented by datapath leakage in a design, where a designer, possibly intentionally, truncates an arithmetic operation. A key objective of ROVER is to enable logic synthesis datapath extraction to form larger datapath blocks, which in turn results in more efficient circuit implementations. In this work we use a rewrite driven approach to the datapath optimization problem. The most relevant prior academic work is from Verma, Brisk and Ienne¬†, who automatically apply dataflow transformations to combinational circuit designs. This work was inspired by the observation that ASIC logic synthesis tools could effectively deploy carry-save representation when presented with consecutive arithmetic operations, generating optimized netlists. However, when given arithmetic blocks separated by additional logical operations, the tool was not able to move the logical operations to facilitate optimal clustering. To address this issue, the authors designed specific logic arithmetic interchange rewrites that produced circuit designs, which when passed to logic synthesis could maximally cluster arithmetic operators together. By leveraging and extending these rewrites in the e-graph optimization framework, we can reproduce and extend results from this paper [ref]9. In addition to the work of Verma, Brisk and Ienne, a general purpose and verified RTL rewriting framework has been developed by Carl Seger and collaborators¬† . The Voss II framework provides a design visualization environment and proposes a more interactive design space exploration approach, with little emphasis on automation. Datapath rewriting has also been applied to specific design challenges such as the design of large bitwidth multipliers¬†. In datapath verification, rewriting has proven to be an invaluable technique¬†[ref]16  . Although we target general datapath RTL optimization, there are several problem domains that have received particular attention and can be captured in the framework we present. One such instance is the multiple constant multiplication (MCM) problem¬†  , where the design problem is as follows: given a set of integer coefficients {a1,‚Ä¶,an}subscriptùëé1‚Ä¶subscriptùëéùëõ\\{a_{1},...,a_{n}\\}, find an optimal circuit producing all the outputs ai√óxsubscriptùëéùëñùë•a_{i}\\times x for a variable input xùë•x. The challenge presents many non-obvious operator sharing opportunities and is beyond the reach of existing logic synthesis tools. These problems are usually solved by hand or with bespoke tools, which represent constants using a fixed representation¬† such as Canonical Signed Digit (CSD)¬†. Alternative approaches deploy adder graph algorithms¬† or have encoded the problem as an integer linear programming problem¬† [ref]24  or as Boolean satisfiability problem¬†. Owing to the generality of the e-graph rewriting framework, such MCM optimizations are another class of methods that are automatically subsumed within our ROVER framework as a special case. Note that bespoke MCM tools will outperform ROVER on complex MCM problems, as we shall see in Section¬†VII.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: synthesis could maximally cluster arithmetic operators together.
