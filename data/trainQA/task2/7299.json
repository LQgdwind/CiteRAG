      "content": "Paper Title: Accelerating hyperbolic t-SNE\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe analysis of high-dimensional data is of major importance for a wide range of applications across many industry and research fields.\nDimensionality reduction is a key part of processing pipelines to visualize and analyze such data, which has recently been demonstrated in the application settings of sports , literature search [ref]38, machine learning , and e-commerce .\nEffective embeddings of data points preserve structures in the data set, such that a visual inspection of the low-dimensional embedded data can help to gain insights into the structures of the high-dimensional data.\nA widespread technique to create such embeddings is t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) .\nIt is popular because t-SNE preserves local neighborhoods particularly well when embedding the data, see Section 3.\nMost dimensionality reduction algorithms traditionally embed data into flat, Euclidean space.\nThis misses the opportunities provided by other embedding spaces, like negatively curved, hyperbolic spaces. Hyperbolic spaces already find applications in the embedding of trees, graphs, and other hierarchical data.\nFor example, it is possible to embed trees into two-dimensional hyperbolic space with arbitrarily low distortion .\nBy this property, previous works have successfully embedded social networks  or the Internet [ref]6 into hyperbolic space.\nFurthermore, hyperbolic spaces exhibit a natural Focus+Context view of the data  , which significantly increases information foraging .\nFinally, it has recently been suggested that hyperbolic spaces are suitable for navigating higher-dimensional spaces directly . Given the utility of hyperbolic spaces for the visualization of hierarchical data, several methods have been proposed to translate t-SNE to work in hyperbolic space   .\nThese adaptions have shown great potential, when used, for instance, in visualization, clustering, lineage detection, and pseudotime inference tasks .\nWe will discuss these in detail in Section 3.1.\nAlthough they all create useful embeddings of high-dimensional data in hyperbolic spaces, solving their respective optimization problems is costly compared to methods that embed into Euclidean space. The long optimization run time in hyperbolic spaces is mostly because accelerations for the computation of Euclidean embeddings are not directly effective for embeddings in hyperbolic spaces.\nFor Euclidean embeddings, state-of-the-art implementations make use of acceleration methods [ref]50   , which have been developed over the last years to speed up the processing, see Section 3.2.\nHowever, contrary to flat Euclidean spaces, hyperbolic spaces exhibit negative curvature.\nOne consequence is that the circumference and area of a circle in a two-dimensional hyperbolic space grow exponentially with its radius, while they grow polynomially in Euclidean space  .\nOn the one hand, these properties make hyperbolic spaces well-suited for the embedding of structures that also grow exponentially. On the other hand, it also leads to the lack of linear interpolation or averages in these non-linear, hyperbolic spaces.\nEuclidean acceleration structures, including those listed above, rely on these properties and can thus not be translated directly for use in hyperbolic spaces.\nFor example, the Barnes-Hut scheme [ref]50 accelerates the optimization by building a quadtree on the embedding space.\nHere, equal-sized quadrilaterals form the nodes of the tree and their midpoints act as accelerating proxies.\nIn hyperbolic spaces, no direct analog of such a tree can be built due to the exponential growth and non-linear properties of such spaces.\nInstead, existing approaches for hyperbolic t-SNE turn to sampling the data in order to compute the embeddings within a reasonable time frame.\nThis limits the visualization of the data to only a limited portion of the input. This paper introduces the first acceleration structure for hyperbolic embeddings.\nWe use a polar quadtree , designed to operate in hyperbolic spaces.\nHowever, we find that the data structure needs to be adjusted to the specific setting of embeddings by changing its build procedure to provide a reliable speed-up of the optimization.\nBased on this modified data structure, we proceed to formulate an approximation of the cost function gradient used in the optimization of hyperbolic t-SNE embeddings.\nBy analyzing the gradients of current state-of-the-art approaches for hyperbolic embeddings   , we show that our acceleration technique can be adjusted to their respective needs.\nThus, it is a versatile building block for current and future hyperbolic embedding approaches.\nFinally, we present several experiments to validate our findings and conclusions.\nIn summary, the contributions of this paper are: the presentation of a polar quadtree data structure for hyperbolic embedding computations, a new splitting rule for the data structure that enhances performance for embedding computations, a fast approximation scheme of hyperbolic gradient descent iterations using the data structure, and an analysis of how to integrate this approximation into existing approaches for hyperbolic embeddings.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: reduction is a key part of processing pipelines to visualize and analyze such data, which has recently been demonstrated in the application settings of sports , literature search [ref]38, machine learning , and e-commerce .\nEffective embeddings of data points preserve structures in the data set, such that a visual inspection of the low-dimensional embedded data can help to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
