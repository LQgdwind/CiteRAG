More recent works [ref]26  generalize the Ehrenfeucht-Fra√Øss√© games to provide game-theoretic characterizations for other variants of WL algorithms. The Cops-Robber games, initially appearing as an instance of graph searching games, are intensively studied by Seymour and Thomas . The original version of the game includes kùëòk Cops trying to trap a Robber on a graph Gùê∫G, where Robber is only capable of moving along the edges to a Cop-free node. The central result of  is a vital property of the game: if Cops can guarantee to win the game, they can win monotonically, meaning that they can ensure Robber never return to a node they have previously expelled Robber from. One corollary of the property is that Cops can win the Cops-Robber game on Gùê∫G if and only if k‚©ætree-width‚Äã(G)+1ùëòtree-widthùê∫1k\\geqslant\\text{tree-width}(G)+1. The standard textbook  on graph theory provides a simpler proof for the latter result. Several recent works  [ref]26 [ref]27 have revived the Cops-Robber games by relating them to F√ºrer graphs [ref]4, which are standard testers for expressive power. However, none of the existing works have directly examined the relationship between Cops-Robber games and the homomorphism counting power of WL algorithms. As is presented in our main theorem (Theorem 4.10), such a relationship is surprisingly simple and beautiful. We also remark that Appendix A.1 of [ref]27 provides a detailed review of existing approaches to the design of expressive GNNs, which is closely related to our work.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: The Ehrenfeucht-Fra√Øss√© games, named after Ehrenfeucht  and Fra√Øss√© , have been used to analyze the kùëòk-FWL algorithms in [ref]4 .
