Generalized Decision-Making with Dual-Phase Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPretraining Visual Representations for Policy Learning: Recent studies such as R3M , APV  VPT , NRNS , PVR [ref]26 and MVP[ref]29 have shown that pre-trained visual representations can significantly enhance the efficiency of downstream policy learning. However, these works mainly focus on learning object-centric semantics, potentially losing essential control-relevant information. To address this issue, VIP [ref]22 formulates the problem as an offline goal-conditioned RL problem and proposes a visual representation algorithm capable of generating dense reward functions for downstream robotics tasks. On the other hand, COMPASS  introduces a general-purpose pretraining pipeline that effectively integrates multimodal signals for autonomous systems. Transformer-Based Foundational Model: The use of high-capacity transformer architectures trained on large-scale datasets has led to significant breakthroughs in various domains. Examples include language models such as BERT , GPT-3 , T5 , and PaLM , as well as vision and vision-language models such as MAE , Multi-MAE , BiT , MuST , Flamingo , and CLIP . For decision-making tasks, recent work such as SMART 6 has proposed a self-supervised pretraining framework tailored for control tasks. For robotics control problems, PACT  has shown that a pretrained representation could speed up various downstream tasks of mobile agents, such as navigation and localization. A General-Purpose Model for Control: Since the groundbreaking success of GPT , recent research has focused on using Transformer decoder-based models to tackle control tasks in an auto-regressive manner. Decision Transformer (DT)  1 builds on the architecture of GPT to create a generalist agent for sequential decision-making tasks. This has been followed by Multi-game DT 9 and Online-DT 2, which demonstrate the potential of DTs for multi-task and online learning. GATO 2 imitates expert demonstrations from a vast dataset and showcases its ability to handle a large number of tasks. VIMA 7 is an agent that can accept multi-modal prompts for solving various robotics manipulation tasks. In real-life applications, RT-1  has demonstrated the efficacy of this approach in robotic control.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Pretraining Visual Representations for Policy Learning: Recent studies such as R3M , APV  VPT , NRNS , PVR [ref]26 and MVP[ref]29 have shown that pre-trained visual representations can significantly enhance the efficiency of downstream policy learning. However, these works mainly focus on learning\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
