      "content": "Paper Title: REWIND Dataset: Privacy-preserving Speaking Status Segmentation from Multimodal Body Movement Signals in the Wild\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDetection or segmentation of speaking activity in free-standing social settings is a core necessity in building systems capable of interpreting interactions in everyday situations, from networking events to exchanges around the coffee machine at the office. The analysis of a complex conversational scene where dozens of people stand, walk, form groups and converse freely (see Fig. 1) is of particular interest in fields such as computational social science and social signal processing for the development of socially intelligent systems capable of aid . Segmenting speaking status (ie. binary signal indicating voice activity of a target speaker) with time resolutions that are suitable for indicating back-channels is key because of its utility in downstream tasks where it can be used, for example, in the quantification of individual and group measures of experience in conversation like involvement , satisfaction [ref]5, perceived quality  , or affect , and in the forecasting of future events like speaking, gesturing and changes in position and orientation [ref]9 . The audio modality is the obvious choice for the measurement of speaking status. High-quality speaking status signals have been obtained from personal head-mounted and directional microphones in seated meetings . However, individual audio is especially hard to acquire in a mingling setting, or crowded conversational scene. Microphone equipment is hard to scale to large dynamic crowded scenes with synchronization guarantees. Furthermore, recording audio is more likely to raise privacy concerns with event attendees or event organizers. It is our experience from prior data collection efforts that the perception of audio recording, even when using more privacy-preserving low frequencies is a deterrent for participant recruitment. In fact, none of the datasets created for the study of free-standing conversations contain raw high frequency audio 1 . Instead, wearable sensors like the sociometric badge 2 3 and mobile phone sensing 4 have been used in mingling settings to capture lower-fidelity signals that obscure the content of conversations but may still capture speaking status 5. However, the noise introduced by the large number of sound sources in a crowd makes it challenging to distinguish speakers in a low frequency recording 3. For these reasons, the possibility of detecting speaking from body movement alone without access to audio offers an appealing privacy-sensitive solution to these problems. It has long been observed that hand and head gestures frequently co-occur with speech 6 7 while being salient cues with similar motion characteristics across people. The video modality commonly present in most in-the-wild mingling datasets 1 3  offers a convenient way to observe these gestures, with several methods having been proposed to detect speaking status from video 8 9 0. So far, however, none of these methods have been trained using ground truth obtained from high-quality individual audio recordings. Video-based annotation or noisy low-frequency signals have been used instead. While video-based annotations of speaking status do provide a valid supervisory signal, it is currently unclear if audio-based labels would provide higher quality annotations given that shorter turns such as back-channels are not so easily observable. Having access to reliable back-channel annotations is an important step for social involvement detection, for example. In this work, we present the first dataset for the study of speaking status segmentation from body movement in the wild with raw, high-quality audio from personal directional Lavalier-type microphones. REWIND offers for the first time, the possibility to scrutinise the relationship between speech and body movements in this setting, with audio-based ground truth that is more fine-grained (higher temporal resolution) compared to previous datasets. Beyond speaking status, the more general problem of how body movement can be used to infer phenomena observed/annotated in the audio modality opens the door for the cross-modal study of other social cues and signals like laughter and back-channeling. In fact, the REWIND dataset was already used in 1 to study laughter annotation across modalities. In addition to audio, the dataset includes three modalities capturing body movements: video, pose, and wearable acceleration. Video recordings include top-down and side-elevated views. The latter was used to automatically obtain pose tracks for subjects in the scene. Acceleration readings were obtained from wearable devices in a badge-like form factor worn by data subjects on the chest. Our contributions are the following: We introduce the REWIND dataset, the first in-the-wild mingling dataset with high-quality raw audio, video, and acceleration; automatic pose annotations, and automatic speaking status labels. We present results from four body-movement-based speaking status segmentation (SSS) machine learning tasks: 1) video-based SSS, 2) acceleration-based SSS and 3) pose-based SSS, and 4) multimodal (video + acceleration + pose) SSS. In comparison with previous work, we increase the resolution of our outputs by training our models to produce a probability mask for speaking status over an input segment. We analyze the role of the REWIND dataset in the context of speaking status segmentation from body movement, and in the wider field of the computational study of body movements, identifying potential research directions enabled by a dataset such as REWIND.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: key because of its utility in downstream tasks where it can be used, for example, in the quantification of individual and group measures of experience in conversation like involvement , satisfaction [ref]5, perceived quality  , or affect , and in the forecasting of future events like speaking, gesturing and changes in position and orientation [ref]9 .
