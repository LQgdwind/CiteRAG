      "content": "Paper Title: Predicting the Popularity of Micro-videos with Multimodal Variational Encoder-Decoder Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDue to its importance in recommendation, advertising, and many other applications, popularity prediction of UGCs on social media receives considerable attention in both industry and academia. The premiere step to predict the popularity of UGCs is to measure it numerically. Generally, the popularity of a piece of UGC is defined by the volume of positive response it receives, which can be estimated by the number of viewers, likes, comments, and reposts. In practice, the weighted average of any combinations of these indexes could adequately serve as an indicator of popularity levels of UGCs, and they are widely used in researches to construct the groundtruth for UGC popularity prediction tasks. For popularity prediction of online textual contents, such as hashtags, microblogs, and articles, most studies focused on combining the representative features from the textual contents ,  and the social context, such as the way users are linked, to train a popularity predictor. One exemplar work is [ref]14, where several content features from hashtags of the tweets were fused with contextual features from the user social graph to train multiple outside classifiers. Besides, for popularity prediction of Reddit comments, Zayats and Ostendorf  extracted the textual features from the reviews and combined the user interaction graph with a long short term memory (LSTM) network to model the influence of user connections and temporal evolution to the popularity of comments over time. As for predicting the popularity of images and long-videos  (such as those posted on YouTube) where rich information is contained in visual or aural modalities, multimodal learning that fuses information from different views is one of the most commonly used techniques. Li et al.  introduced a novel propagation-based popularity prediction method by considering both intrinsic video attractiveness and the underlying propagation structure. Khosla et al. [ref]18 explored the relative significance of individual features involving multiple visual features, as well as various social context features, including the number of views and contacts. Cao et al.  utilized two coupled neural networks to iteratively capture the cascading effect in information diffusion to predict future popularity. Trzcinski et al.  predicted the popularity of the video with both the visual clues and the early popularity pattern of the video after its publish over a certain period. However, none of these methods considered the cold start scenario. In order to deal with such a challenge, McParlane et al.  took a content-based strategy and utilized only visual appearance and user context for Flickr image popularity prediction. Bielski et al.  predicted the popularity of videos before they are published, by exploiting the spatio-temporal characteristics of videos through a soft self-attention mechanism, and they intuitively interpreted the impact of contents on video popularity by Grad-CAM Algorithm. Although an emerging form of UGC, several pioneer work have been dedicated towards the popularity prediction of micro-videos. Chen et al.  first employed four types of heterogeneous features, i.e., the visual, acoustic, textual, and social features to describe the characteristics of micro-videos, and proposed a transductive multimodal learning model to regress the popularity index of micro-videos after their release. Trzciński\nand Przemysław , on the other hand, focused on using the early popularity pattern of the popularity curve to predict the trend for the time after, which extended the micro-video popularity prediction task to an online manner. Afterwards, Jing et al. 1 thoroughly discussed the detrimental effects of internal noise to the micro-video analysis studies, and they augmented the multi-view learning method with a low-rank constraint, such that only a few principal patterns in micro-video features are allowed to be kept in its representation. The most salient character that distinguishes our methods from the above ones is that we also consider the inherent uncertainty in popularity and treats all external uncertain factors as randomness, which can be properly preserved when we learn the Gaussian embedding of the micro-videos. Besides, compared with 1, which also considered the adverse effect of noise, we resort to combining the representative learning power of the deep neural network and the denoising ability of information bottleneck structure, where for each sample, the information that is allowed to be extracted into the hidden representation is actively learned and dynamically decided. Furthermore, in 1, the popularity was a single numerical value, whereas our model is also suitable for tasks where the popularity is represented by a time-related sequence, which is more difficult since it requires understanding the hidden evolutionary pattern of the popularity trend.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: studies focused on combining the representative features from the textual contents ,  and the social context, such as the way users are linked, to train a popularity predictor.
