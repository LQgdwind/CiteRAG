      "content": "Paper Title: EEG-based Image Feature Extraction for Visual Classification using Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNowadays, digital data consists mainly of visual content such as images or videos. Visual classification is advancing our civilization through applications ranging from facial recognition to improved product discoverability. Humans have evolved to be natural and accurate classifiers, but our ability to categorize objects or create new categories is occasionally limited. We classify a scene using intuition and experience, but only if the distinctive patterns are visible . Machine perception can capture critical classifications and detect small patterns that the human mind ignores. Although deep learning models such as CNN deliver good performance, they lack clear explanations due to a black-box decision-making approach , time-consuming and computationally expensive for prediction and improving classification . Recently, Kaneshiro et al. identified a new approach to visual classification with machine learning using EEG signals from the human brain . It attempts to map human perception to picture data collected from machine classifiers for visual classification tasks. Previous studies have also used EEG signals as images, encoding them into space-time domain [ref]5 and time-frequency domain [ref]6. In this way, we can leverage the EEG cognitive features to aid in further classification of images by using techniques discussed in our methodology section. Representing these EEG signals in multidimensional encoded image space via a single sample provides rich data for classification. As deep learning models require a large amount of data to learn and extract features efficiently, these encodings enable us to do the same. In the following sections, we briefly describe the previous work, our initiatives, and the results with comparisons of various methodologies. The main focused approaches are: Visual classification using only images Visual classification using only EEG data Two-dimensional grayscale EEG encoded image data Visual classification using a multi-modal fusion of EEG and Image data\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: map human perception to picture data collected from machine classifiers for visual classification tasks. Previous studies have also used EEG signals as images, encoding them into space-time domain [ref]5 and time-frequency domain [ref]6. In this way, we can leverage the EEG cognitive features to aid in further classification of images by using techniques discussed in our methodology section.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
