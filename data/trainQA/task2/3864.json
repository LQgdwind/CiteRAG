      "content": "Paper Title: Skeptical binary inferences in multi-label problems with sets of probabilities1footnote 11footnote 1This paper significantly extends the published paper in 12th International Symposium on Imprecise Probabilities: Theories and Applications (ISIPTA).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn contrast to multi-class problems where each instance is associated to one label, multi-label classification consists in associating an instance to a subset of relevant labels from a set of possible labels. Such problems can arise in different research fields, such as the classification of proteins in bioinformatics 0, text classification in information retrieval , object\nrecognition in computer vision , and so on. Considering all possible subsets of relevant labels as possible predictions make the estimation and decision steps of a learning problem significantly more difficult: partial observations are more likely to occur, especially when the number of labels increase, and the output space over which the probability needs to be estimated grows exponentially with the number of labels. This means that in some applications where guaranteeing the robustness and reliability of predictions is of particular importance, one may consider being cautious about such predictions, by predicting a set of possible answers rather than a single one when uncertainties are too high. In the literature, such strategies can be called partial rejection rules , partial abstention 1 or indeterminate classification  . The main goal of this paper 222This paper extends a shorter conference version  by providing additional examples, details and experiments. It also includes significant original content; notably, the study of the imprecise binary relevance with other decision criteria in B, an investigation of how our skeptical approach can address the problem with noisy labels in Section 5.1, and finally, a first comparative investigation of how the partial abstention, rejection threshold and our skeptical approach behave to downsampling in Section 5.2. is to exclusively study the problem of making such set-valued predictions by performing skeptic inferences when our uncertainty is described by a set of probabilities (the more uncertainties, the bigger the set). By skeptic inference, we understand the logical procedure that consists, in the presence of multiple models, to accept only those inferences that are true for every possible model. Such approaches are different from thresholding approaches 1 , and are closer in spirit to distributionally robust approaches, even if these later typically consider precise, minimax inferences, that are cautious yet not skeptic 6 [ref]7. We also make no assumptions about the considered set of probabilities, thus departing from usual distributionally robust approaches, that typically consider precise predictions, or from existing works dealing with sets of probabilities and multi-label problems , that considered specific probability sets and zero/one loss function (which is seldom used in multi-label problems). More precisely, and before detailing the content of our paper, our main contributions are as follows: proposing theoretical procedures to reduce the complexity time of the skeptical inference step when we consider any set of joint probability distributions and the Hamming loss; proposing to generalize the classical binary relevance by using imprecise marginal distributions; proposing additional implications on different type of decision criteria when we consider imprecise marginal distributions and the Hamming loss; providing experiments to compare our exact procedure against the existing outer-approximation; providing experiments to how our skeptical approach can address the problem with missing and noisy labels; providing a first comparative investigation of how the partial abstention, rejection and our skeptical approach can react under downsampling. Section 2 introduces the notations we will use for the multi-label setting, and give the necessary reminders about skeptic inferences made with sets of probabilities. Once this is done, we provide in Section 3 novel theoretical results concerning the Hamming loss and the maximality decision criterion, those results ending in an inference procedure that has an almost linear time complexity with respect to the size of the output space. We also investigate under which conditions the previous results using marginal probability bound (or under the assumption of strong independence on output space) become exact. Besides, under the latter conditions, the set-valued predictions induced by the E-admissible decision criterion match perfectly with that of the maximality criterion. In the B, we provide some additional implications (and a graph with its relations) regarding different types of decision criteria which can be considered as less and more conservatives in terms of skeptical decisions. In other words, the ones which can infer the largest or smallest set-valued of predictions than the other well-known ones, such as the E-admissible and the maximality. In Section 4, we perform a set experiments on simulated data sets to study; (1) the exactness of the existing outer-approximation  against our exact optimal procedure, when we consider sets of joint probability distributions, and (2) the real computation time trend of the naive against the exact optimal procedure. Finally, in Section 5, we perform an additional set of experiments on real data sets, which is divided in two sections; the former aims to study the behaviour of the skeptical inference against its precise counterpart; (1) under an assumption of strong independence and (2) on missing and noisy labels, and the latter aims to compare the partial abstention, the partial rejection rules and our skeptical approach under a downsampling setup. Proofs of technical results as well as complementary experimental results, from this paper, are provided in C, D and E, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: thresholding approaches 1 , and are closer in spirit to distributionally robust approaches, even if these later typically consider precise, minimax inferences, that are cautious yet not skeptic 6 [ref]7.
