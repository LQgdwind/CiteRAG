      "content": "Paper Title: Perfect Matching in Random Graphs is as Hard as Tseitin\\TCSthanks Supported by the Approximability and Proof Complexity project funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProof complexity is the study of certificates of unsatisfiability,\ninitiated by Cook and Reckhow 0\nas a program to separate \\NP\\NP\\NP\nfrom \\coNP\\coNP\\coNP. The main goal of this program is to prove size lower\nbounds on proofs of unsatisfiability of logical formulas. This\nis a daunting job – indeed we are far\nfrom proving general size lower bounds on certificates of\nunsatisfiability.\nAs an intermediate step we study proof\nsystems with restricted deductive power\nand prove size lower bounds for such restricted certificates of\nunsatisfiability.\nThe most studied such proof system is resolution  which is fairly well understood by now, see\ne.g., the proof complexity book by Krajíček\n. But resolution is by far not the only proof\nsystem. A closely related and quite general proof system is the\nbounded depth Frege proof system 0 which\nmanipulates propositional formulas of bounded depth. While we\nhave some results for the bounded depth Frege proof system, in this\nintroduction we instead focus on two other systems as these\nwere the primary motivation behind our work.\nThese are the two proof systems\nPolynomial Calculus (PC)   and\nSum-of-Squares (SoS)\n  [ref]45.\nThese proof systems do not rely on propositional logic, like\nresolution or Frege, but rather on\nalgebraic reasoning and are examples of\nso-called (semi-)algebraic proof systems (see\ne.g. ). Both PC and SoS provide refutations of (satisfiability of) a set of\npolynomial equations 𝒬={qi​(x)=0∣i∈[m]}𝒬conditional-setsubscript𝑞𝑖𝑥0𝑖delimited-[]𝑚\\mathcal{Q}=\\{\\,q_{i}(x)=0\\mid i\\in[m]\\,\\} over\nn𝑛n variables x1,…,xnsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}. In the case of PC, these\npolynomials can be over any field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} (finite or infinite), and in\nthe case of SoS, these polynomials are over ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}.\nA key complexity\nmeasure of a PCF or SoS refutation of 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} is its degree, defined as\nthe maximum degree of any polynomial appearing in the refutation.\nThe degree of refuting\n𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} in PCF or\nSoS, which we denote by 𝖣𝖾𝗀(𝒬⊢PCF⟂)\\operatorname{\\sf{Deg}}(\\mathcal{Q}\\vdash_{\\text{\\tiny PC${}_{\\mathbb{F}}$}}\\,\\perp) and\n𝖣𝖾𝗀(𝒬⊢SoS⟂)\\operatorname{\\sf{Deg}}(\\mathcal{Q}\\vdash_{\\text{\\tiny SoS}}\\,\\perp) respectively, is the minimum degree of\nany PCF or SoS refutation of 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q}. For Boolean systems of\nequations, meaning that 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} contains the equations\nxi2−xi=0superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖2subscript𝑥𝑖0x_{i}^{2}-x_{i}=0 for all i∈[n]𝑖delimited-[]𝑛i\\in[n],\nstrong enough degree lower bounds imply size\nlower bounds in both PCF  \nand SoS , where the size of a\nrefutation is the total number of monomials\nappearing in it. For finite 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} the proof system\nPCF is incomparable\nto SoS 8   whereas SoS\ncan simulate PCR by the recent result of\nBerkholz . There is by now a large number of lower bound results for both\nPC\n8    9 0,\nand SoS\n   [ref]6   5 ,\nwith SoS in particular having received considerable\nattention in recent years due to its close connection to the\nSum-of-Squares hierarchy of semidefinite programming,\na powerful “meta-algorithm” for\ncombinatorial optimization problems . In this paper we study the power (or lack thereof) of these proof\nsystems when it comes to refuting the perfect matching formula\n𝖯𝖬​(G)𝖯𝖬𝐺\\mathsf{PM}(G)\ndefined over\nsparse random graphs G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) on an odd number of vertices.\nThis formula can be viewed as a system of linear equations over ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}\non a set of Boolean variables: for each edge e∈E𝑒𝐸e\\in E there is\na variable xe∈{0,1}subscript𝑥𝑒01x_{e}\\in\\{0,1\\} (indicating whether the edge is used in\nthe matching) and for each vertex v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V there is an equation\n∑e∋vxe=1subscript𝑣𝑒subscript𝑥𝑒1\\sum_{e\\ni v}x_{e}=1.\nApart from being a natural well-studied problem on its own, the\nperfect matching formula is interesting because of its close relation to two\nother widely studied families of formulas, namely the pigeonhole principle (PHP), and\nTseitin formulas. PHP asserts that m𝑚m pigeons cannot fit in n<m𝑛𝑚n<m holes (where each\nhole can fit at most one pigeon). This can be viewed as a bipartite\nmatching problem on the complete bipartite graph with m+n𝑚𝑛m+n vertices,\nwhere each vertex on the large side (with m𝑚m vertices) must be\nmatched at least once, and each vertex on the small side (with n𝑛n\nvertices) can be matched at most once. There are many variants of\nPHP (see e.g. the survey 9),\nand the one closest to the perfect matching formula is the\nso-called “onto functional PHP”, in which each vertex on\nboth sides must be matched exactly once (rather than at least/at most\nonce). Equivalently, this formula is simply the perfect matching formula\non a complete bipartite graph with n+m𝑛𝑚n+m vertices.\nWhile most variants of PHP are hard for PC 8 0, the\nonto functional PHP variant is in fact easy to refute in PC over any field . In SoS, all variants\nof PHP are easy to refute . The Tseitin formula over a graph G𝐺G claims that\nthere is a\nsubgraph of G𝐺G such that each vertex has odd degree. As the\nsum of the degrees of a graph is even, this formula is not\nsatisfiable if G𝐺G has an odd number of vertices. In contrast\nto the PHP, the Tseitin formula is (almost) always hard: for PCF\nover fields 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} of characteristic distinct from 2\n \nand SoS \nthese formulas require linear\ndegree if G𝐺G is a good vertex expander.\nWe cannot hope to prove degree lower bounds over\nfields of characteristic 2 as the constraints become linear\nand we can thus refute\nthe Tseitin formula using Gaussian elimination.\nAs the perfect matching formula 𝖯𝖬​(G)𝖯𝖬𝐺\\mathsf{PM}(G) implies the Tseitin formula,\nPC over fields of characteristic 222 can also easily refute 𝖯𝖬​(G)𝖯𝖬𝐺\\mathsf{PM}(G)\nfor G𝐺G with an odd number of vertices. In summary,\nthe perfect matching formula lies somewhere in between PHP and\nTseitin, of which the former is easy to refute in SoS (and easy to\nrefute in PC in the onto functional variant), and the latter is hard\nto refute in SoS (as well as in PC with characteristic ≠2absent2\\neq 2).\nHence it is natural to wonder whether SoS or PC requires large degree to\nrefute the perfect matching formula over non-bipartite graphs. The case of\nperfect matching in the complete graph on an odd number of vertices\n(sometimes called the “MOD 2 principle”) is well-understood in both\nPC  and SoS  6,\nrequiring degree Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(n) in both proof systems unless the\nunderlying field of PC is of characteristic 2.\nFor sparse graphs, less is known. Buss\net al.  obtained worst-case lower bounds in PC\nshowing that there exist bounded degree graphs on n𝑛n vertices\nrequiring Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(n) degree refutations. This is obtained by a\nreduction from Tseitin formulas and while the work of Buss et\nal. predates the current interest in the SoS system, it is not hard to\nsee that the same reduction yields a similar Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(n) degree lower\nbound for SoS (details provided in Appendix A). However, for random graphs G𝐺G little is known\nabout the hardness of the perfect matching formula and, e.g.,\nRazborov 7\nasked whether it is true that the Lovász-Schrijver hierarchy  (which is weaker than SoS) requires\nnεsuperscript𝑛𝜀n^{\\varepsilon} rounds to refute the perfect matching principle on a random\nsparse regular graph with high probability.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: in this\nintroduction we instead focus on two other systems as these\nwere the primary motivation behind our work.\nThese are the two proof systems\nPolynomial Calculus (PC)   and\nSum-of-Squares (SoS)\n  [ref]45.\nThese proof systems do not rely on propositional logic, like\nresolution or Frege, but rather on\nalgebraic reasoning and are examples of\nso-called (semi-)algebraic proof systems (see\ne.g. ).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
