      "content": "Paper Title: No-Reference Quality Assessment for 360-degree Images by Analysis of Multi-frequency Information and Local-global Naturalness\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhether for traditional objective IQA or objective OIQA, when the originally pristine/reference image is available, full-reference (FR) objective visual quality assessment models are developed. As for conventional FR IQA, the signal fidelity metrics such as mean square error (MSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), measure the visual quality by computing the pixel differences between original and distorted images. Due to the simple calculation and optimization processes, they are widely used in image processing. Nevertheless, their performance is relatively unsatisfactory and cannot predict the human perceived visual quality precisely. Therefore, the characteristics of the HVS are employed to construct perception-based IQA models. For instance, the structural similarity (SSIM) index  and its different variants, including the multiscale SSIM (MS-SSIM) index , the feature similarity (FSIM) index , etc. When coming to practical scenarios, perfect-quality original images are usually difficult to obtain, and thus no-reference objective visual quality assessment approaches are urgently needed. For traditional NR IQA, many methods extract hand-crafted distortion-discriminative features for predicting the perceptual image quality, such as the blind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator (BRISQUE) , the blind multiple pseudo reference images-based (BMPRI) measure , and so on. In recent decades, due to the powerful feature representation learning capacity, deep learning has shown unprecedented success in many image processing and computer vision tasks  . This also presents an opportunity for evaluating the image visual quality. Typical methods contain the deep image quality assessment (DeepQA) [ref]36 and the deep bilinear convolutional neural network (DBCNN)  for FR and NR IQA, respectively. Furthermore, several perception-based pre-processing strategies have been presented in existing works. For example, before training CNN models, saliency maps can be used to assign importance to distorted image patches . The distorted image stream and gradient image stream were both considered in CNN to predict perceptual image quality scores . Although there exist lots of classical objective quality assessment algorithms for FR and NR IQA, they are designed for regular flat 2D images and unsuitable for assessing the perceptual quality of OIs. Yet, limited research works related to objective OIQA methods have been proposed in the literature. In general, existing objective OIQA models can be classified into two categories. The first is to extend conventional FR IQA approaches to FR OIQA      . For example, several PSNR-based FR OIQA models were presented. Yu et al.  proposed the spherical PSNR (S-PSNR), which chose specific points on the spherical surface rather than the projected panoramic image. Sun et al.  developed the weighted-to-spherically-uniform PSNR (WS-PSNR) by combining the error map with the weighted map which was determined by stretched regions. Zakharchenko et al.  presented the craster parabolic projection PSNR (CPP-PSNR), which computed the PSNR on the craster parabolic projection domain. Xu et al.  put forward the non-content-based PSNR (NCP-PSNR) and content-based PSNR (CP-PSNR) via weighting pixels with position information and predicting viewing direction, respectively. Likewise, the performance of PSNR-based FR OIQA methods is insufficient because they do not consider the HVS characteristics. Afterwards, objective FR OIQA methods based on SSIM have been proposed in succession. Similar to WS-PSNR, Zhou et al.  designed the weighted-to-spherically-uniform SSIM (WS-SSIM), where the position weighted map was used to multiply the SSIM. In order to reduce the influence of geometric distortions for the projection, Chen et al.  proposed the spherical SSIM (S-SSIM), which calculated the similarity of each image pixel on the sphere. The second is the deep learning-based NR IQA methods    [ref]49 . Considering the spherical representation of 360-degree content, Kim et al.  proposed a deep learning framework for VR image quality assessment (DeepVR-IQA) based on adversarial learning, in which the quality scores of sampled patches were predicted and then they were weighted according to the patch positions on the sphere. Moreover, in , the head movement (HM) and eye movement (EM) were exploited to weight the quality scores in deep learning models. But the image patches sampled from the projected plane reveal non-negligible geometric deformation, which cannot reflect the actual viewing contents. Thus, viewports were utilized to predict the perceptual quality of OIs. Specifically, Li et al.  proposed a viewport-based CNN (V-CNN), which predicted the quality scores of viewports instead of image patches sampled from projected planes. Sun et al. [ref]49 designed a multi-channel CNN for blind 360-degree image quality assessment (MC360IQA), including 6 parallel hyper-ResNet34 networks to process viewport images and an image quality regression module to aggregate learned features for obtaining the final image quality. Xu et al.  proposed the viewport oriented graph convolution network (VGCN) to tackle the perceptual quality assessment for OIs, which was guided by different viewports. From the above reviewed objective quality assessment models for OIs, it can be concluded that existing objective OIQA methods have achieved success to a certain extent. However, we also notice that they all ignore the important multi-frequency information as well as the statistical regularizations of OIs from both global projection maps and local viewports. To fill the blank, in this work, we try to present a no-reference OIQA method by considering multi-frequency information and local-global naturalness simultaneously.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: in many image processing and computer vision tasks  .
