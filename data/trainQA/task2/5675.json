      "content": "Paper Title: SLCA: Slow Learner with Classifier Alignment for Continual Learning on a Pre-trained Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBenchmark:\nFollowing L2P 6 and DualPrompt , we adopt pre-training from ImageNet-21K dataset 2, also known as the full ImageNet [ref]6 consisting of 14,197,122 images with 21,841 classes. We also consider pre-training from ImageNet-1K dataset , a subset of ImageNet-21K introduced for the ILSVRC2012 visual recognition challenge, consisting of 1000-class images. To evaluate the performance of downstream continual learning, we consider four representative benchmark datasets and randomly split each of them into 10 disjoint tasks:\nThe first two follow previous works 6  and are relatively coarse-grained in terms of classification, while the last two are relatively fine-grained.\nSpecifically, CIFAR-100 dataset  consists of 100-class natural images with 500 training samples per class. ImageNet-R dataset  contains 200-class images, spliting into 24,000 and 6,000 images for training and testing (similar ratio for each class), respectively. Note that although the image categories of ImageNet-R are overlapped with ImageNet-21K, all images are out-of-distribution samples for the pre-train dataset, i.e., hard examples from ImageNet or newly collected data of different styles. It requires considerable adaptations of the pre-trained model, therefore serving as a challenging benchmark for continual learning. CUB-200 dataset  includes 200-class bird images with around 60 images per class, 30 of which are used for training and the rest for testing. Cars-196 dataset  includes 196 types of car images, split into 8,144 and 8,040 images for training and testing (similar ratio for each class), respectively.\nWe present the average accuracy of all classes after learning the last task, denoted as Last-Acc (equivalent to “Avg. Acc” in 6 ). We also compute the average accuracy of the classes ever seen after learning each incremental task and then present their average, denoted as Inc-Acc. Implementation:\nFollowing previous works 6 , we adopt a pre-trained ViT-B/16 backbone for all baselines. In addition to supervised pre-training, we consider representative self-supervised paradigms that provide pre-trained checkpoints on ViT-B/16, i.e., MoCo v3 , BEiT  and MAE . For continual learning of downstream tasks, we follow the previous implementation that employs an Adam optimizer for L2P 6 and DualPrompt  while a SGD optimizer for other baselines, with the same batch size of 128. Our Slow Learner adopts a learning rate of 0.0001 for the representation layer and 0.01 for the classification layer, different from 6  using 0.005 for the entire model. Baseline:\nWe adopt joint training\nas the upper bound performance and consider continual learning baselines with or without replaying old training samples.\nAs for the former, a memory buffer of 1000 images is maintained, and we evaluate three representative replay-based approaches such as BiC 9, GDumb  and DER++ . As for the latter, we evaluate representative regularization-based approaches such as EWC  and LwF 5, and prompt-based approaches such as L2P 6 and DualPrompt .\nNote that sequential fine-tuning usually serves as the lower bound performance of continual learning, but we observe that simply adjusting the learning rate (i.e., using the Slow Learner) makes it a surprisingly strong baseline.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Benchmark:\nFollowing L2P 6 and DualPrompt , we adopt pre-training from ImageNet-21K dataset 2, also known as the full ImageNet [ref]6 consisting of 14,197,122 images with 21,841 classes.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
