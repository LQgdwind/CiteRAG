      "content": "Paper Title: A Higher-order Trace Finite Element Method for Shells\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA shell is a curved, thin-walled structure and due to their high bearing capacity, they occur in many engineering applications such as automotive, aerospace, biomedical- and civil-engineering   . In the mechanical modelling of a shell, a dimensional reduction from the 3D shell body to its midsurface is a key step. The equilibrium equations result into partial differential equations (PDEs) on manifolds embedded in the physical space ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3}. In the classical approach of modelling shells, the midsurface is typically defined by a (piecewise) parametrization which may be called an explicit definition. Then, there exists a map from some two-dimensional parameter space Ω^^Ω\\hat{\\Omega} to ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3}. In the context of the classical Surface FEM, the discrete midsurface is rather defined by an atlas of local element-wise mappings from the reference element to the physical elements. An overview of classical shell theory is given, e.g., in     or in the text books     . Alternatively, the shell geometry may also be defined implicitly following the level-set method [ref]25 [ref]26 8 . The main advantage of implicit geometry descriptions is that the application of recent finite element techniques such as fictitious domain methods (FDM) for shells is enabled. Herein, we propose a higher-order accurate fictitious domain method for implicitly defined Reissner–Mindlin shells. The geometry of the shell is defined implicitly by means of level-set functions. The shell boundary value problem (BVP) is discretized with a higher-order accurate Trace FEM approach. The Trace FEM is a fictitious domain method for solving PDEs on manifolds, see, e.g., 9 4 5 1   . This may also be called Cut FEM which, in the last years, became a popular FDM enabling higher-order accuracy  0 . When using the Cut FEM for the solution of PDEs on manifolds as done herein, the method becomes analogous to the Trace FEM 1 3. This recent finite element technique is fundamentally different compared to standard Surface FEM approaches, see, e.g., 9   [ref]26. In the following, the major differences in, (1) geometry definition, (2) mesh and degrees of freedom (DOFs) and, (3) generation of integration points in these two approaches are outlined and visualized for the Trace FEM in Fig. 1 and for the Surface FEM in Fig. 2, respectively. Firstly, the differences in the geometry definition are emphasized. In Fig. 1(a), an implicitly defined shell by means of level-set functions is presented. In particular, the yellow surface indicates the midsurface of the shell and is defined by the zero-isosurface of a master level-set function. The boundary of the shell is defined by additional slave level-set functions, i.e., the light green, purple and grey surfaces in Fig. 1(a). In contrast to the implicit definition, an explicit representation of the shell midsurface for this example is shown in Fig. 2(a). Then, the surface is given through an atlas of element-wise local mappings, as usual in the context of Surface FEM, implying local curvilinear coordinates. Note that a parametrization is only available in the explicit case and is, in general, not available in implicitly defined geometries. Secondly, the mesh generation and the location of DOFs are considered. In the Trace FEM the domain of interest, i.e., the shell midsurface, is embedded in a three-dimensional background mesh. The 3D background mesh may consist of higher-order Lagrange elements with the only requirement that the domain of interest is completely immersed. Neither the shell surface nor the shell boundary have to conform to the background mesh. There is one master level-set function whose zero-isosurface implies the shell surface and additional slave level-set functions imply the boundaries. The set of cut elements is labelled active mesh and is visualized in Fig. 1(b) where cubic tetrahedral elements are used as an example. For the numerical simulation, the DOFs are located at the nodes of the active mesh, which are clearly not on the midsurface of the shell. The corresponding shape functions are those of the active mesh and are restricted to the trace. This means that for the integration of the weak form, the 3D shape functions are only evaluated on the zero-isosurface of the master level-set function. In contrast, in the Surface FEM a boundary conforming surface mesh, see Fig. 2(b), is defined through an atlas of element-wise local mappings and the DOFs are located at nodes of the surface mesh which are on the discrete midsurface of the shell. The corresponding shape functions are the 2D shape functions living only on the surface mesh. The location of the DOFs and the different dimensionality of the shape functions are the most important differences between the two finite element techniques. Lastly, integration points need to be placed on the shell midsurface for the integration of the weak form. In the case of the Trace FEM, this is not a trivial task especially when a higher-order accurate integration scheme is desired  [ref]25 [ref]26  2 0, further details are given below. Regarding the Surface FEM standard Gauß integration rules are applicable and mapped from the reference to the surface elements in the usual manner. In Fig. 1(c) and Fig. 2(c), integration points in the domain (red) and on the boundary (blue) are visualized for the Trace FEM and Surface FEM, respectively. As mentioned above, the Trace FEM approach is a fictitious domain method and the following three well-known implementational aspects require special attention: (i) integration of the weak form, (ii) stabilization and, (iii) enforcement of essential boundary conditions. Regarding the integration of the weak form, suitable integration points with higher-order accuracy for multiple level-set functions have to be provided. Herein, the approach, which naturally extends to multiple level-set functions as outlined by the authors in  [ref]25 [ref]26  is employed. Other higher-order integration schemes for implicitly defined surfaces with one level-set function are presented, e.g., in 2 0. A stabilization of the stiffness matrix is necessary due to small supports caused by unfavourable cut scenarios and the restriction of the shape functions to the trace. An overview and analysis of the different stabilization techniques in the Trace FEM is presented in 5. Herein, the “normal derivative volume stabilization” first introduced for scalar-valued problems in 0 1 and for vector-valued problems in 1 3 is used. The advantage of this particular stabilization technique is that it is suitable for higher-order accuracy; a straight forward implementation and a rather flexible choice of the stabilization parameter is possible. The essential boundary conditions need to be enforced in a weak manner due to the fact that a strong enforcement by prescribing nodal values does not apply (because the nodes of the background mesh are not on the shell boundary). Therefore, a similar approach as presented by the authors in  is employed. In particular, the non-symmetric version of Nitsche’s method is used, see, e.g.,  0 2 . The Trace FEM approach is applied in a wide range of applications. In particular, transport problems are presented, e.g., in  1  5, flow problems are considered, e.g., in 0 1  3 5 7, moving and evolving manifolds are detailed in 5 7 1. The first application of the Trace FEM to membranes has just recently been achieved for the linear membrane in 3 and for large deformation membranes by the authors in . This is considerably more challenging because in structural mechanics, the governing equations of membranes and shells have been, until recently, only formulated based on curvilinear coordinates. This, however, does not directly apply for an implicit shell definition and the use of the Trace FEM. Therefore, the reformulation of classical (curvilinear) models for shells and membranes during the last years was a crucial preliminary step for the use of the Trace FEM. Most importantly, the use of the Tangential Differential Calculus (TDC) was found highly useful and generalizes the mechanical models in the sense that they become valid for explicit and implicit geometry definitions 3 4 1 2  . In contrast, in flow and transport applications on curved surfaces, the general coordinate-free definition of the boundary value problems is a standard for a long time  9  6 , thus enabling the application of the Trace FEM earlier than in structural mechanics as proposed herein. Herein, to the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first time, that a Trace FEM approach is applied to curved Reissner–Mindlin shells. Furthermore, the proposed approach is also higher-order accurate, thus enabling optimal higher-order convergence rates if the involved fields are sufficiently smooth. Other Trace FEM applications with particular emphasis on higher-order accuracy are rather scarce. If the geometry is defined by multiple level-set functions, we refer to  and for one level-set function, we refer to 0 5 7. The Reissner–Mindlin shell model is suitable to model thin and moderately thick shells and as mentioned above the employed shell model need to be applicable on implicitly defined surfaces, where a parametrization of the midsurface is not existent. Therefore, a formulation of the shell equations in the frame of the TDC is employed herein. The recast of the linear shell equations in the frame of the TDC is presented by the authors in 2. The shell formulation is based on a standard difference vector approach. The tangentiality constraint on the difference vector is accomplished by a projection of a full 3D vector onto the tangent space combined with a consistent stabilization in normal direction. The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the implicit definition of shell geometries is described. Furthermore, the employed differential surface operators and other important quantities in the frame of the TDC are briefly introduced. In Section 3, the TDC-based Reissner–Mindlin shell model is outlined following 2 . The resulting BVP is formulated in strong and weak form including boundary conditions. In Section 4, the higher-order Trace FEM is introduced in detail. Furthermore, the implementational aspects of the Trace FEM, i.e., (i) integration of the weak form, (ii) stabilization and, (iii) enforcement of essential boundary conditions are elaborated. The discrete weak form of the equilibrium is introduced and the discretization of the difference vector is considered. In Section 5, numerical results of the proposed approach are presented with a set of benchmark examples. The results confirm that optimal higher-order convergence rates are achieved when the solution is sufficiently smooth. The paper ends in Section 6 with a summary and conclusions.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: elements.
