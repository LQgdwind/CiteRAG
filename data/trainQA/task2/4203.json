One main challenge for path-based models is the need to account for the correlation between overlapping alternative paths, and numerous methods have been developed to address this issue, including the widely used path size logit (PSL) . In a real-sized network, there can be a large number of possible paths connecting each origin-destination (OD) pair. To estimate path-based models, one has to make assumptions about which paths to consider and generate a finite choice set, typically using some sort of path generation algorithms such as link elimination  and constrained enumeration 2. However, it has been shown that parameter estimates can vary significantly based on the definition of choice sets [ref]11. These issues with path-based models have motivated the development of link-based models in recent years.  proposed the recursive logit model, where a path choice is modeled as a sequence of link choices using a dynamic discrete choice framework. They found that the recursive logit is equivalent to a path-based multinomial logit model with an unrestricted choice set, but can produce more consistent parameter estimates without requiring choice set generation. Later studies proposed several extensions, including the nested recursive logit  and discounted recursive logit 0. However, existing link-based models assume simple linear utility functions and require link-additive features 5, limiting their ability to uncover nonlinear effects of link/path attributes and incorporate context features about the trip/user. We need more flexible model structures to account for more complex effects of diverse features.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: path generation algorithms such as link elimination  and constrained enumeration 2.
