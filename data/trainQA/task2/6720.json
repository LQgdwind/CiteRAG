      "content": "Paper Title: Attribution-Scores in Data Management and Explainable Machine LearningPaper associated to tutorial at ADBIS 2023.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Shap score was introduced in explainable ML in , as an application of the general Shapley value of coalition game theory , which we briefly describe next. Consider a set of players 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}, and a\nwealth-distribution function (or game function), 𝒢:𝒫​(𝒮)→ℝ:𝒢→𝒫𝒮ℝ\\mathcal{G}\\!:\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{S})\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}, that maps subsets of 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} to real numbers.  The Shapley value of player p∈𝒮𝑝𝒮p\\in\\mathcal{S} quantifies the contribution of p𝑝p to the game, for which all different coalitions are considered; each time, with p𝑝p and without p𝑝p: Here, |S|!​(|D|−|S|−1)!𝑆𝐷𝑆1|S|!(|D|-|S|-1)! is the number of permutations of\n𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} with all players in S𝑆S coming first, then p𝑝p, and then all the others.  In other words,\nthis is the expected contribution of p𝑝p under all possible additions of p𝑝p to a partial random sequence of players, followed by random sequences of the rest of the players. The Shapley value emerges as the only quantitative measure that has some specified properties in relation to coalition games . It has been applied in many disciplines.  For each particular application, one has to define a particular and appropriate game function 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}. In particular, it has been applied to assign scores to logical formulas to quantify their contribution to the inconsistency of a knowledge base , to quantify the contribution of database tuples to making a query true  [ref]31, and to quantify contributions to the inconsistency of a database . In different application and with different game functions, the Shapley value turns out to be computationally intractable, more precisely, its time complexity is #​P#𝑃\\#P-hard in the size of the input, c.f., for example, [ref]31. Intuitively, this means that it is at least as hard as any of the problems in the class #​P#𝑃\\#P of problems about counting the solutions to decisions problems (in 𝑁𝑃𝑁𝑃{\\it NP}) that ask about the existence of a certain solution [ref]47 . For example, 𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑆𝐴𝑇{\\it SAT} is the decision problem asking, for a propositional formula, if there exists a truth assignment (a solution) that makes the formula true. Then, #​𝑆𝐴𝑇#𝑆𝐴𝑇\\#\\!{\\it SAT} is the computational problem of counting the number of satisfying assignments of a propositional formula. Clearly, #​𝑆𝐴𝑇#𝑆𝐴𝑇\\#\\!{\\it SAT} is at least as hard as 𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑆𝐴𝑇{\\it SAT} (it is good enough to count the number of solutions to know if the formula is satisfiable), and 𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑆𝐴𝑇{\\it SAT} is the prototypical 𝑁𝑃𝑁𝑃{\\it NP}-complete problem, and furthermore, #​𝑆𝐴𝑇#𝑆𝐴𝑇\\#\\!{\\it SAT} is #​P#𝑃\\#P-hard, actually, #​P#𝑃\\#\\!P-complete since it belongs to #​P#𝑃\\#P. As a consequence, computing the Shapley value can be at least as hard as computing the number of solutions for 𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑆𝐴𝑇{\\it SAT}; a clear indication of its high computational complexity. As already mentioned, the Shap score is a particular case of the Shapley value in (5). In this case, the players are the features F𝐹F in ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, or, more precisely, the values F​(𝐞)𝐹𝐞F(\\mathbf{e}) they take for a particular entity 𝐞𝐞\\mathbf{e}, for which we have a binary classification label, L​(𝐞)𝐿𝐞L(\\mathbf{e}), we want to explain. The explanation takes the form of a numerical score for F​(𝐞)𝐹𝐞F(\\mathbf{e}), reflecting its relevance for the observed label. Since all the feature values contribute to the resulting label, features values can be seen as players in a coalition game. The game function, for a subset S𝑆S of features, is the expected (value of the) label over all possible entities whose values coincide with those of 𝐞𝐞\\mathbf{e} for the features in S𝑆S: where 𝐞S′,𝐞Ssubscriptsuperscript𝐞′𝑆subscript𝐞𝑆\\mathbf{e}^{\\prime}_{S},\\mathbf{e}_{S} denote the projections of 𝐞′superscript𝐞′\\mathbf{e}^{\\prime} and 𝐞𝐞\\mathbf{e} on S𝑆S, resulting in two subrecords of feature values.  We can see that the game function depends on the entity at hand 𝐞𝐞\\mathbf{e}. With the game function in (5), the Shap score for a feature value F⋆​(𝐞)superscript𝐹⋆𝐞F^{\\star}(\\mathbf{e}) in 𝐞𝐞\\mathbf{e} is: (example 8 cont.)  For the same fixed entity 𝐞=⟨john,18,plumber,70K,\\mathbf{e}\\ =\\ \\langle\\mbox{\\sf\\small john},\\mbox{\\sf\\small 18},\\mbox{\\sf\\small plumber},\\mbox{\\sf\\small 70K}, harlem,10K,basic⟩\\mbox{\\sf\\small harlem},\\mbox{\\sf\\small 10K},\\mbox{\\sf\\small basic}\\rangle and feature F⋆=Salarysuperscript𝐹⋆SalaryF^{\\star}=\\mbox{\\sf\\small Salary}, one of the terms in (7) is obtained by considering S={Location}⊆ℱ𝑆LocationℱS=\\{\\mbox{\\sf\\small Location}\\}\\subseteq\\mathcal{F}: with, e.g.,  𝒢𝐞({Location,Salary})=𝔼(L(𝐞′)|𝐞′∈ℰ,Location(𝐞′)=harlem, and \\mathcal{G}_{\\mathbf{e}}(\\{\\mbox{\\sf\\small Location},\\mbox{\\sf\\small Salary}\\})=\\mathbb{E}(L(\\mathbf{e}^{\\prime})~{}|~{}\\mathbf{e}^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{E},\\ \\mbox{\\sf\\small Location}(\\mathbf{e}^{\\prime})=\\mbox{\\sf\\small harlem},\\mbox{ and } Salary(𝐞′)=70K)\\mbox{\\sf\\small Salary}(\\mathbf{e}^{\\prime})=\\mbox{\\sf\\small 70K}),   that is, the expected label over all entities that have the same values as 𝐞𝐞\\mathbf{e} for features Salary and Location.  Then,  𝒢𝐞​({Location,Salary})−𝒢𝐞​({Location})subscript𝒢𝐞LocationSalarysubscript𝒢𝐞Location\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathbf{e}}(\\{\\mbox{\\sf\\small Location},\\mbox{\\sf\\small Salary}\\})-\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathbf{e}}(\\{\\mbox{\\sf\\small Location}\\}) is the expected difference in the label between the case where the values for Location and Salary are fixed as for 𝐞𝐞\\mathbf{e}, and the case where only the value for Location is fixed as in 𝐞𝐞\\mathbf{e}, measuring a local contribution of 𝐞𝐞\\mathbf{e}’s value for Salary. After that, all these local differences are averaged over all subsets S𝑆S of ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, and the permutations in which they participate.   □□\\Box We can see that, so as the Resp score, Shap is a local explanation score, for a particular entity at hand 𝐞𝐞\\mathbf{e}.  Since the introduction of Shap in this form, some variations have been proposed. So as for Resp, Shap depends, via the game function, on an underlying probability distribution on the entity population ℰℰ\\mathcal{E}. The distribution may impact not only the Shap scores, but also their computation . Boolean classifiers, i.e. propositional formulas with binary input features and binary labels, are particularly relevant, per se and because they can represent other classifiers by means of appropriate encodings. For example, the circuit in Figure 1 can be seen as a binary classifier that can be represented by means of a propositional formula that, depending on the binary values for x1,x2,x3,x4subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥3subscript𝑥4x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4}, also returns a binary value. Boolean classifiers, as logical formulas, have been extensively investigated. In particular, much is known about the satisfiability problem of propositional formulas, 𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑆𝐴𝑇{\\it SAT}, and also about the model counting problem, i.e. that of counting the number of satisfying assignments, denoted #​𝑆𝐴𝑇#𝑆𝐴𝑇\\#\\!{\\it SAT}.\n In the area of knowledge compilation, the complexity of #​𝑆𝐴𝑇#𝑆𝐴𝑇\\#\\!{\\it SAT} and other problems in relation to the syntactic form of the Boolean formulas have been investigated   .  Boolean classifiers turn out to be quite relevant to understand and investigate the complexity of Shap computation. The computation of Shap is bound to be expensive, for similar reasons as for Resp. For the computation of both, all we need is the input/output relation of the classifier, to compute labels for different alternative entities (counterfactuals). However, in principle, far too many combinations have to go through the classifier. Actually, under the product probability distribution on ℰℰ\\mathcal{E} (which assigns independent probabilities to the feature values), even with an explicit, open classifier for binary entities, the computation of Shap can be intractable. In fact, as shown in , for Boolean classifiers in the class 𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑒​2​𝐶𝑁𝐹𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑒2𝐶𝑁𝐹{\\it Monotone}2{\\it CNF}, of negation-free propositional formulas in conjunctive normal form with at most two atoms per clause, Shap can be #​P#𝑃\\#\\!P-hard. This is obtained via a polynomial reduction from #​𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑒​2​𝐶𝑁𝐹#𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑒2𝐶𝑁𝐹\\#{\\it Monotone}2{\\it CNF}, the problem of counting the number of satisfying assignments for a formula in the class, which is known to be #​P#𝑃\\#\\!P-complete [ref]47.  For example, if the classifier is  (x1∨x2)∧(x2∨x3)subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥3(x_{1}\\vee x_{2})\\wedge(x_{2}\\vee x_{3}), which belongs to #​𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑒​2​𝐶𝑁𝐹#𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑒2𝐶𝑁𝐹\\#{\\it Monotone}2{\\it CNF}, the entity 𝐞1=⟨1,0,1⟩subscript𝐞1101\\mathbf{e}_{1}=\\langle 1,0,1\\rangle (with values for x1,x2,x3subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥3x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}, in this order) gets label 111, whereas the entity 𝐞2=⟨1,0,0⟩subscript𝐞2100\\mathbf{e}_{2}=\\langle 1,0,0\\rangle gets label 00.  The number of satisfying truth assignments, equivalently, the number of entities that get label 111, is 555, corresponding to ⟨1,1,1⟩111\\langle 1,1,1\\rangle, ⟨1,0,1⟩101\\langle 1,0,1\\rangle, ⟨0,1,1⟩011\\langle 0,1,1\\rangle,\n⟨0,1,0⟩010\\langle 0,1,0\\rangle, and ⟨1,1,0⟩110\\langle 1,1,0\\rangle. Given that Shap can be #​P#𝑃\\#P-hard, a natural question is whether for some classes of open-box classifiers one can compute Shap in polynomial time in the size of the model and input. The idea is to try to take advantage of the internal stricture and components of the classifier -as opposed to only the input/output relation of the classifier- in order to compute Shap efficiently. We recall from results mentioned earlier in this section that having an open-box model does not guarantee tractability of Shap. Natural classifiers that have been considered in relation to a possible tractable computation of Shap are decision trees and random forests . The problem of tractability of Shap was investigated in detail in [ref]4, and with other methods in . They briefly describe the former approach in the rest of this section.\nTractable and intractable cases were identified, with algorithms for the tractable cases. (Approximations for the intractable cases were further investigated in .) In particular, the tractability for decision trees and random forests was established, which required first identifying the right abstraction that allows for a general proof, leaves aside contingent details, and is also broad enough to include interesting classes of classifiers. In [ref]4, it was proved that, for a Boolean classifier L𝐿L (identified with its label, the output gate or variable), the uniform distribution on ℰℰ\\mathcal{E}, and ℱ={F1,…,Fn}ℱsubscript𝐹1…subscript𝐹𝑛\\mathcal{F}=\\{F_{1},\\ldots,F_{n}\\}: This result makes, under the usual complexity-theoretic assumptions, impossible for Shap to be tractable for any circuit L𝐿L for which #​𝑆𝐴𝑇#𝑆𝐴𝑇\\#\\!{\\it SAT} is intractable. (If we could compute Shap fast, we could also compute #​𝑆𝐴𝑇#𝑆𝐴𝑇\\#\\!{\\it SAT} fast, assuming we have an efficient classifier.)  This excludes, as seen earlier in this section, classifiers that are in the class 𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑒​2​𝐶𝑁𝐹𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑒2𝐶𝑁𝐹{\\it Monotone}2{\\it CNF}. Accordingly, only classifiers in a more amenable class became candidates, with the restriction that the class should be able to accommodate interesting classifiers. That is how the class of deterministic and decomposable Boolean circuits (dDBCs) became the target of investigation. Each ∨\\vee-gate of a dDBC can have only one of the disjuncts true (determinism), and for each ∧\\wedge-gate,\nthe conjuncts do not share variables (decomposition). Nodes are labeled with ∨,∧\\vee,\\wedge, or ¬\\neg gates, and input gates with features (propositional variables) or binary constants. An example of such a classifier, borrowed from [ref]4, is shown in Figure 1. It has the ∧\\wedge gate at the top that returns the output label. Model counting is known to be tractable for dDBCs. However, this does not imply (via (8) or any other obvious way) that Shap is tractable. It is also the case that relaxing any of the determinism or decomposability conditions makes model counting #​P#𝑃\\#P-hard , preventing Shap from being tractable. It turns out that 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑝𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑝{\\it Shap} computation is tractable for dDBCs (under the uniform and the product distribution), from which we also get the tractability of 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑝𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑝{\\it Shap} for free for a vast collection of classifiers that can be efficiently compiled into (or represented as) dDBCs; among them we find:  Decision Trees (even with non-binary features), Random Forests, Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) , Deterministic-Decomposable Negation Normal-Forms (dDNNFs), Binary Neural Networks via OBDDs or Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDDs) (but with an extra, exponential, but FPT compilation cost)   , etc. For the gist, consider the binary decision tree (DT) on the LHS of Figure 2. It can be inductively and efficiently compiled into a dDBC [5, appendix A]. The leaves of the DT\nbecome labeled with propositional constants, 00 or 111. Each node, n𝑛n, is compiled into a circuit c​(n)𝑐𝑛c(n), and the final dDBC corresponds to the compilation, c​(r)𝑐𝑟c(r), of the root node r𝑟r, in this case, c​(n​7)𝑐𝑛7c(n7) for node c​7𝑐7c7.  Figure 2 shows on the RHS, the compilation c​(n​5)𝑐𝑛5c(n5) of node n​5𝑛5n5 of the DT.  If the decision tree is not binary, it is first binarized, and then compiled [5, sec. 7].\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: been applied to assign scores to logical formulas to quantify their contribution to the inconsistency of a knowledge base , to quantify the contribution of database tuples to making a query true  [ref]31, and to quantify contributions to the inconsistency of a database .
