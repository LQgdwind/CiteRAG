Skew-Fit [ref]13 improves over RIG  in training efficiency by ensuring the behavioural goals used to explore are diverse and have wide state coverage. However, Skew-Fit has its own limitation in understanding the semantic meaning of the goal-conditioned task. To acquire more meaningful goal‚Äôs and observation‚Äôs latent representation, several approaches apply inductive biases or seek human feedback. ROLL [ref]38 applies object extraction methods under strong assumptions, while WSC  uses weak binary labeled data as the reward function.\nOthers explore the same goal-conditioned RL problem via hindsight experience replay  [ref]40 , unsupervised reward learning , inverse dynamics models , C-learning , goal generation   , goal-conditioned forward models , and hierarchical RL    .\nOur study focus on learning goal-conditioned policies that is invariant of spurious environmental factors. We aim to learn a policy that can generalize to visual goals in unseen test environments. Learning Invariants in RL: Robustness to domain shifts is crucial for real-world applications of RL.    implement the model-bisimulation framework  to acquire a minimal but sufficient representation for solving the MDP problem. However, model-bisimulation for high-dimension problems typically requires domain-invariant and dense rewards. These assumptions do not hold in GBMDPs. Contrastive Metric Embeddings (CME)  instead uses œÄ‚àósuperscriptùúã\\pi^{*}-bisimulation metric but it also requires extra information of the optimal policy. Another line of work tries to address these issues via self-supervised learning.  tests multiple data augmentation methods including RAD  and DrQ  to boost the robustness of the representation as well as the policy. Our work can also apply data augmentation in practice. However, we find that RAD is not very helpful in the Skew-Fit framework. Additionally,   use self-supervised correction during real-world adaptation like sim2real transfer but these methods are incompatible for domain generalization.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: for complicated reward shaping by only rewarding agents for reaching a desired set of goal states.\nRIG  is the seminal work for visual-input, reward-free learning in goal-conditioned MDPs.
