      "content": "Paper Title: AIM 2024 Challenge on Efficient Video Super-Resolution for AV1 Compressed Content\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe growing popularity of video streaming services and social media, combined with the widespread use of mobile devices, has generated a significant demand for efficient video super-resolution solutions. Over the past years, many deep learning-based solutions have been proposed for the VSR problem [ref]7  [ref]6  [ref]42. The primary limitation of these methods is that they were designed to achieve high-fidelity results without being optimized for computational efficiency and mobile-related constraints, which are crucial in many real-world scenarios. For instance methods such as VideoGigaGAN  and BasicVSR [ref]7 achieve outstanding results in terms of fidelity and even perceptual quality, however, these methods do not offer real-time performance (24 FPS) on regular GPUs. Other works have proposed real-time image super-resolution solutions – with hard memory and computational constraints – that could be extended to the video use-cases    . We also find few challenges in the past that tackle mobile super-resolution  . In this challenge, we take one step further in solving this problem: Previous works and challenges use the popular REDS  dataset, which contains 1280×72012807201280\\times 720 24FPS videos. Unlike previous works, we focus on 4K resolution (YCbCr 4:2:0), and we provide higher-quality videos. VMAF   was not used in previous works, although it has better correlation with the subjective perceptual quality (in comparison to simple PSNR and SSIM), for this reason, it is our main quality metric. We compress the videos using modern video codecs such as AV1 . We impose additional efficiency-related constraints on the developed solutions i.e. a limit of 250 GMACs. Our challenge tackles two scenarios: 540p to 4K (x4), and 360p to 1080p (x3); each tailored for different screens and applications. We believe that these improvements in terms of data, evaluation and efficiency constraints, will help to push the boundaries of efficient VSR. This challenge is one of the AIM 2024 Workshop111https://www.cvlai.net/aim/2024/ associated challenges on: sparse neural rendering 8 9, UHD blind photo quality assessment , compressed depth map super-resolution and restoration , efficient video super-resolution for AV1 compressed content , video super-resolution quality assessment 3, compressed video quality assessment  and video saliency prediction 5.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: of mobile devices, has generated a significant demand for efficient video super-resolution solutions.
