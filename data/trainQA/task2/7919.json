Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Initially, the focus was on optimizing objectives for single searchers¬† 2, but with the rise of robotic fleets, multi-searcher problems have gained prominence¬†2 . The linear search problem is a classic example studied extensively for both single¬† 3 and multiple searchers¬†6. Variations aim at minimizing the weighted average of search completion times¬†. Other one-dimensional search settings include searching along rays¬†4, anomalous terrains¬†, graphs¬†, and for multiple objects¬†2 1. In the past decade, attention has shifted to two-dimensional search problems, exploring domains like polygons¬†, disks¬†2, planes¬†, regular polygons¬†6, equilateral triangles and squares¬† 8  , arbitrary triangles¬†, and ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p} unit disks¬†. Variations involve different communication models and searcher specifications, such as face-to-face communication¬†5  [ref]36, varying searcher speeds¬†, searching for multiple exits¬†, and diverse communication capabilities¬†  . Fault tolerance has also been studied, addressing issues like faulty agents and Byzantine faults in¬†0 1 3 9 and in¬†   5. Research has also explored non-standard objectives, including multi-objective search problems¬†7, competitive algorithmic approaches¬†, and trade-offs between information and cost¬†3. Studies have also considered time and energy\ntrade-offs¬†4 5, and search-and-fetch problems in two dimensions¬†5 6.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: The field of search problems dates back to the 1960s and has since developed a robust theoretical framework, detailed in various books and surveys¬†  [ref]3 8  .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
