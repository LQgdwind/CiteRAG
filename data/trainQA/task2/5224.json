      "content": "Paper Title: Fine-tuned CLIP Models are Efficient Video Learners\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVision Language models: Learning multi-modal representations using large-scale image-text pretraining has proved to be effective for a wide range of uni-modal and multi-modal applications      . Foundational VL models like CLIP  and ALIGN  follow such a pretraining paradigm and are trained on large-scale image-caption pairs with contrastive self-supervised objectives. These models are open vocabulary and effectively transfer on downstream vision applications including few-shot and zero-shot recognition [ref]47  , object detection   , and image segmentation   . However, adapting pretrained VL models to videos is a challenging task due to the lack of video-specific temporal cues in the image-level pretraining. Therefore, recent works 0  [ref]17 adapt CLIP for videos by incorporating additional learnable components such as self-attention layers, textual or vision prompts, or dedicated visual decoder, and have demonstrated improvements on video applications. However, it is still unclear how much benefit these relatively complex domain-specific components provide compared to simple alternatives such as fine-tuning on videos. Video Action Recognition:\nDesigning accurate video understanding models inherently requires encoding both spatial and motion cues. Recently, vision transformers based networks  6  proposes to effectively model the long range spatio-temporal relationships and have shown consistent improvements over the 3D CNNs    . While these approaches follow independent uni-modal solutions, works like ActionCLIP , XCLIP 0 and Ju et al. [ref]17 adopt a multi-modal approach by utilizing CLIP and steer it for video-understanding tasks. These methods utilize the rich generalized VL representations of CLIP and fuse them with additional components for temporal modeling. However, we note that such design choices can affect the generalization ability of CLIP and a simple fine-tuning approach performs competitively. Prompt Learning:\nPrompting is a recently adapted paradigm to efficiently transfer a model to downstream tasks without re-learning the trained model parameters. By utilizing a few additional learnable tokens at the inputs, this approach typically aims to retain the model generalization ability in addition to better transferring the model to downstream applications. Inherited from the NLP domain, prompting has been widely used for many vision and V-L models. CoOp [ref]47 and CoCoOp  propose to use continuous learnable text prompts to transfer CLIP for image recognition tasks. Bahng et al.  introduce visual prompts to probe CLIP at its vision branch. MaPLe 0 propose multi-modal prompting to effectively adapt CLIP. By keeping the original model parameters frozen, prompting is considered efficient and requires less computing and training time as compared to conventional full fine-tuning. In video tasks, Ju et al. [ref]17 adapt CLIP via text prompts and transformer layers for temporal modeling. However, this temporal modeling hinders the CLIP generalization, and struggles to perform well in zero-shot setting.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: pairs with contrastive self-supervised objectives.
