      "content": "Paper Title: Structured Scene Memory for Vision-Language Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs a crucial step towards building intelligent embodied agents, autonomous navigation has long been studied in robotics. Since Anderson et al. ​ [ref]3 extended prior efforts​   in instruction based navigation into photo-realistic simulated scenes​ , vision-language navigation (VLN) has recently attracted increasing attention in computer vision community. Towards the goal of enabling an agent to execute navigation instructions in 3D environments, current representative VLN methods made great advances in: i) developing more powerful learning paradigms​  [ref]48; ii) exploring extra supervision signals from synthesized data​    or auxiliary tasks​ [ref]48   ; iii) designing more efficient multi-modal embedding schemes​   ; and iv) making more intelligent path planning   . Despite these progresses, current VLN models typically follow​ [ref]3 to tackle the task through a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) framework, which maps instructions and online observations to navigation actions. With such a design, the perceived information are embedded and mixed in the internal recurrent units. This prohibits the agent from directly accessing to its past observations and understanding the environment layout. Taking Fig.​ 1 as an example. VLN agents execute instructions in a partially observed environment (Fig.​ 1(b)). As current VLN agents simply encode past perceptions (blue area in Fig.​ 1(b)) as hidden network states, their decision-making is only limited within a local action space (i.e., currently navigable directions – green area in Fig.​ 1(b)). Thus they tend to make sub-optimal navigation decisions, failing to perform path planning over the explored environment (i.e., global action space in Fig.​ 1(b)). In robotics, map-building is long studied for facilitating path planning [ref]46 . Inspired by classic simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) models [ref]46 , recent efforts make use of deep learning techniques for constructing more efficient space representations​    .\nOn the other hand, making path planning in VLN, in essence, requires efficiently modeling long-term dependencies within online observation sequences. However, the states (internal memory) in recurrent networks are latent and shown inherently unstable over long timescales . Alternatively, neural networks with external memories provide a feasible solution, which uses a compartmentalized memory to preserve and recall long-term information and has been shown successful in language modeling​  and deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents in 3D environments  . Built off these two lines of previous efforts, we propose an essential, outside memory architecture, called Structured Scene Memory (SSM). SSM online collects and precisely stores the percepts during navigation (see Fig.​ 1(b-c)). It is graph-structured, yielding a topological representation of the environment. Thus SSM is able to perform long-term memorization and capture the environment layouts, allowing our agent to make efficient planning. In addition, SSM delivers a global action space – all the navigable locations within the explored area, enabling flexible decision making. As shown in Fig.​ 1(c), when necessary, our agent can simply move off its current navigation direction (i.e., P1) and travel to another previously visited far location (i.e., P2). Specifically, SSM consists of nodes that embed visual information in explored locations and edges that represent geometric relations between connected locations. As both visual and geometric cues are captured and disentangled, instructions can be better grounded onto the visual world, i.e., correlating perception and action related descriptions with nodes and edges in SSM respectively. SSM is equipped with a collect-read controller, which adaptively reads content from the memory, depending on current navigation context. The controller also mimics iterative algorithms for comprehensive information gathering and long-range reasoning. Hence, SSM brings a global action space but its gradually increased scale will make policy learning harder. We propose a frontier-exploration based decision making strategy that addresses this issue elegantly and efficiently. Extensive experiments on Room-to-Room (R2R)​ [ref]3 and Room-for-Room (R4R)​  datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the full approach and core model designs.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: As a crucial step towards building intelligent embodied agents, autonomous navigation has long been studied in robotics.
