      "content": "Paper Title: Hypercontractivity on High Dimensional Expanders: a Local-to-Global Approach for Higher Moments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNearly 20 years after its introduction, Kahn, Kalai, and Linial  revolutionized the study of boolean functions with hypercontractivity. Not long after, a significant interest grew in the development and application of hypercontractivity beyond the hypercube, with a particular focus on product distributions and especially the pùëùp-biased hypercube [ref]10  [ref]28 . These works offered a general theory of hypercontractivity for such domains, but their strength depended on the underlying distributions in the product space. While this was sufficient for many important applications including a number of sharp threshold theorems [ref]28 [ref]26, the results become meaningless for unbalanced products such as the pùëùp-biased cube for p‚â§on‚Äã(1)ùëùsubscriptùëúùëõ1p\\leq o_{n}(1). This issue was resolved only recently by Keevash, Lifshitz, Long, and Minzer , who showed a hypercontractivity theorem for pseudorandom functions on product spaces that is independent of the underlying distributions. This result offered the missing piece for a number of classical applications, including a tight variant of the KKL Theorem (for monotone functions) , Majority is Stablest , and had a number of other applications in extremal combinatorics . Another line of work has examined hypercontractivity on what are often called ‚Äúexotic‚Äù domains: specific objects beyond products such as the slice , multislice , Grassmannian  (or similarly the degree-two short code ), and symmetric group . Like KLLM‚Äôs improved result for product distributions, most of these examples are only hypercontractive for pseudorandom functions (with the multislice being the only exception).121212We note that higher degrees of the short code are also hypercontractive, but only on low Fourier levels for general functions . The main application of this line of work has been to agreement testing and hardness of approximation. In particular, hypercontractivity for the Grassmannian was used to prove the soundness of an agreement tester in the ‚Äú1% regime‚Äù needed for the proof of the 2-2 Games Conjecture      . It is worth noting that agreement testing theorems are also known for local-spectral expanders    (indeed the objects were originally introduced in this context). These results, however, lie in the ‚Äú99% regime,‚Äù so it is interesting to ask whether our theory of hypercontractivity can be used to build a bounded degree agreement tester in the more difficult 1% regime. Finally, we should note that our overarching proof structure for hypercontractivity builds on KMMS‚Äô work on the slice (i.e.¬†the complete complex). Their techniques, however, rely heavily on the fact that the slice is close in ‚Ñì1subscript‚Ñì1\\ell_{1}-distance to a product. This is far from true on local-spectral expanders, especially those of bounded degree which may essentially be as far as possible from products. As previously discussed, this lack of structure is a challenging barrier broken for the first time in this work.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: a significant interest grew in the development and application of hypercontractivity beyond the hypercube, with a particular focus on product distributions and especially the pùëùp-biased hypercube [ref]10  [ref]28 .
