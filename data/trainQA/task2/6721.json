      "content": "Paper Title: Attribution-Scores in Data Management and Explainable Machine LearningPaper associated to tutorial at ADBIS 2023.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn data management and artificial intelligence, and machine learning in particular, one wants explanations for certain results. For example, for query answers and inconsistency in databases. In machine learning (ML), one wants explanations for automated classification results, and automated decision making. Explanations, that may come in different forms, have been the subject of philosophical enquires for a long time, but, closer to our discipline, they appear under different forms in model-based diagnosis, and in causality as developed in artificial intelligence. In the last few years, explanations that are based on numerical scores assigned to elements of a model that may contribute to an outcome have become popular. These attribution scores attempt to capture the degree of contribution of those components to an outcome, e.g. answering questions like these: What is the contribution of this tuple to the answer to this query? Or, what is the contribution of this feature value for the label assigned to this input entity? In this article, we survey some of the recent advances on the definition, use and computation of the above mentioned score-based explanations for query answering in databases, and for outcomes from classification models in ML. This is not intended to be an exhaustive survey of the area. Instead, it is heavily influenced by our latest research. \nTo introduce the concepts and techniques we will use mostly examples, trying to convey the main intuitions and issues. Different scores have been proposed in the literature, and some that have a relatively older history have been applied. Among the latter we find the general responsibility score as found in actual causality [ref]24  . For a particular kind of application, one has to define the right causality setting, and then apply the responsibility measure to the participating variables. In data management, responsibility has been used to\nquantify the strength of a tuple as a cause for a query result  . ¬†The responsibility score, ùëÖùëíùë†ùëùùëÖùëíùë†ùëù{\\it Resp}, is\nbased on the notions of counterfactual intervention as appearing in actual causality. More specifically,\n(potential) executions of counterfactual interventions on a structural logico-probabilistic model ¬†[ref]24 are considered, with the purpose of answering hypothetical questions of the form: ¬†What would happen if we change ‚Ä¶?. Database repairs are commonly used to define and obtain semantically correct query answers from a database (DB) that may fail to satisfy a given set of integrity constraints (ICs) [ref]6. A connection between repairs and actual causality in DBs has been used to obtain complexity results and algorithms for responsibility  (see Section 2). Actual causality and responsibility can also be defined at the attribute-level in DBs (rather than at the tuple-level) [ref]9. We briefly describe this alternative in Section 2.1. ¬†On the basis of database repairs, a measure (or global score) to quantify the degree of inconsistency of a DB was introduced in . We give the main ideas in Section 3. The Resp¬†score has also been applied to define scores for binary attribute values in classification . However, it has to be generalized when dealing with non-binary features . We describe this generalization in Section 4.1. The Shapley value of coalition game theory   can be (and has been) used to define attribution scores, in particular in DBs. The main idea is that several tuples together, much like\nplayers in a coalition game, are necessary to produce a query result. Some may contribute more than others to the wealth distribution function (or simply, game function), which in this case becomes the query result, namely 111 or 00 if the query is Boolean, or a number in the case of an aggregation query. This use of Shapley value was developed in  . See also  for a more recent and general discussion of the use of the Shapley value in DBs. The Shapley value has also been used to define explanation scores to feature values in ML-based classification, taking the form of the Shap¬†score . Since its computation is bound to be intractable in general, there has been recent research on classes of models for which Shap¬†becomes tractable   8. See Section 4.2. There hasn‚Äôt been much research on the use or consideration of domain knowledge (or domain semantics) in the definition and computation of attribution scores. In Section 5, we describe some problems that emerge in this context. This article has  as a companion, which concentrates mostly on data management. It delves into the Resp¬†score under ICs, and on the use of the\nShapley value for query answering in DBs. That paper also discusses the\nCausal Effect score applied in data management 2. It is also based on causality, as it appears mainly in observational studies 1  .\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: scores have been proposed in the literature, and some that have a relatively older history have been applied. Among the latter we find the general responsibility score as found in actual causality [ref]24  . For a particular kind of application, one has to define the right causality setting, and then apply the responsibility measure to the participating variables.
