      "content": "Paper Title: Multiple Instance Learning Framework with Masked Hard Instance Mining for Whole Slide Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHard sample mining is a popular technique to speed up convergence and enhance the discriminative power of the model in many deep learning areas, such as face recognition [ref]30, object detection  , person re-identification  [ref]39 [ref]33 , and deep metric learning  . The main idea behind this technique is to select the samples which are hard to classify correctly (i.e., hard negatives and hard positives) for alleviating the imbalance between positive and negative samples and facilitating model training.\nThere are generally three groups of approaches for evaluating sample difficulty: loss-based 8, similarity-based , and learnable weight-based .\nTypically, these strategies require complete sample supervision information.\nDrawing on the ideas of the above works, we propose a hard instance mining approach in MIL, mining hard examples at the instance level.\nIn this, there are no complete instance labels, only the bag label is available.\nSimilar to our approach, Li et al. utilized attention scores to identify salient instances from false negative bags to serve as hard negative instances and used them to compose the hard bags for improving classification performance .\nA key difference is that we indirectly mine hard instances by masking out the most salient instances rather than directly locating hard negative instances.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Hard sample mining is a popular technique to speed up convergence and enhance the discriminative power of the model in many deep learning areas, such as face recognition [ref]30, object detection  , person re-identification  [ref]39 [ref]33 , and deep metric learning  .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
