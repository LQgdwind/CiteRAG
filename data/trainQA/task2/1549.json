      "content": "Paper Title: Deep View Synthesis via Self-Consistent Generative Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMulti-view synthesis. Synthesizing a novel view from multiple view images has long been studied.\nDebevec et al.  combines both image-based and geometry-based techniques to render novel views from multiple views.\nSagonas et al. [ref]19 considers frontal facial image synthesizing as an optimization problem.\nTraditional methods fail in occlusion situations and may generate artifacts in synthesized views.\nThus, some approaches that combine different learning methods are proposed to tackle such bottlenecks. Learning-based approaches tackle multi-view synthesis task via training a prediction model, e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)   [ref]20 [ref]21.\nDosovitskiy et al.  trains CNN to render images of chairs with different poses, lighting, etc.\nDeepStereo [ref]21 synthesizes a novel view by interpolating from neighboring posed views of a scene. However, it is difficult to composite occluding content under large baselines.\nSimilarly, Multi2Novel  and StereoMagnification  use multi-plane or multi-view to construct a plane-sweep volume. They have the same problem as DeepStereo.\nConsidering the correlation among different views, Zhou et al.  proposes View Synthesis by Appearance Flow (VSAF) to synthesize new images of the same object from arbitrary viewpoints.\nHowever, VSAF requires viewpoint transformation information (in addition to the input images) and may lead to incorrect content due to occlusion.\nPark et al.  and Ji et al.  seek to improve VSAF by addressing these problems.\nDisocclusion-aware Appearance Flow Network (DOAFN)  is proposed to predict not only a novel view but also a visibility map to improve performance.\n\nMulti-Scale Adversarial Correlation Matching (MS-ACM)  models structures as self-correlation coefficients extracted from multi-scale feature maps.\n\nUnfortunately, both DOAFN and MS-ACM are not suitable for the multi-view synthesis task studied in this paper due to the limitation of a single view input.\n\nTo render a novel view, View Independent Generative Adversarial Network (VI-GAN)  and Extreme View Synthesis  input additional camera pose, which is not required in our multi-view synthesis task.\n\nDVM  aims to synthesize novel views from multiple views without additional information beyond input image pairs.\nOur model outperforms DVM when dealing with a large baseline image pair. Generative adversarial networks (GANs). Recently, many GANs    have been proposed to generate images, such as DCGANs , WGANs , and progressive GANs .\nInspired by GANs, Huang et al.  proposed a Two-Pathway Generative Adversarial Network (TP-GAN) to synthesize a facial view image from one side view while preserving the symmetric structure of faces.\nHowever, TP-GAN ignores data consistency and may result in meaningless images.\nRegarding this issue, Zhu et al. proposed cycle-consistency loss to preserve the content in image translation by enforcing double-sided consistency during training  .\nBetter than Pix2Pix , the double forward-backward processes qualify it for unsupervised tasks.\nHowever, unlike image translation, the multi-view synthesis task is often a supervised task in which we should exactly recover a novel view from two or more view images (or videos) obtained by cameras at distinct positions with more strict constraints.\nFocusing on addressing the multi-view synthesis task, in this paper, we use self-consistency (one cycle mapping from the synthesized view to side views) to ensure the input views (which may contain occluded contents) can be reconstructed.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: a novel view from multiple view images has long been studied.\nDebevec et al.  combines both image-based and geometry-based techniques to render novel views from multiple views.\nSagonas et al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
