      "content": "Paper Title: Uncertainty-Aware Performance Prediction for Highly Configurable Software Systems via Bayesian Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany complex modern software systems, such as database management systems, image processing tools, video encoders and code optimizers are highly configurable. They provide different configuration options for users to customize to meet their specific requirements, and thus improving the usability of the systems. Different configurations could lead to different performance, therefore it is necessary to understand the performance of a system under all configurations before configuring and deploying the system. This helps users to make rational decisions in configurations and avoid misconfiguration, which could lead to system performance issues, negatively affecting their experience. In fact, some empirical studies found that 59 percent of performance issues are related to configuration errors [ref]1 , and it is well known that performance issues can damage user experience [ref]1     . In reality, it is almost impossible to measure the performance of a configurable software system under all configurations as the number of possible configurations could be prohibitively large even for small-scale systems. For example, the popular file archive utility 7z has 44 configuration options, giving rise to 244superscript2442^{44} possible configurations with approximately 70,000 valid configurations . To address the problem of the explosion of the number of configurations, researchers aims to build a prediction model from the performance data of a small number of configurations, and then predict the performance of the system under a new configuration     . Recently, it has been suggested that this approach neglects numerous sources of uncertainty, such as the measurement bias, the model representation and learning process, and the limited training data . Due to these uncertainties, the scalar predictions provided by existing prediction models are highly impossible to be 100% accurate. A sensible approach is to develop prediction models that can account for these sources of uncertainty, and can provide both scalar predictions and confidence intervals of these scalar predictions . Figure 1 illustrates a simple example of this research problem, where the prediction model provides both scalar predictions (green line) and the corresponding confidence intervals (green shaded region). In practice, confidence intervals help users to manage risk better as it provides the range where the true performance value likely falls in, thus helps users to understand the worst case and best case scenarios when choosing a specific configuration. This is particularly important in safety-critical application domains where many systems are configurable, e.g., automotive systems, cloud-computing systems, cyber-physical systems . To incorporate different sources of uncertainty into a prediction model and generate the confidence intervals, the standard approach is to perform Bayesian inference on the prediction model [ref]14 [ref]15   . For the configurable software performance prediction problem, recently, Dorn et al.  proposed to use a linear regression model, and perform Bayesian inference on this model to generate the confidence intervals. However, it is known that linear regression does not work well in the scenarios when the relationship between the system performance and the configuration options are non-linear and complex  . In practice, these scenarios generally occur when the configurable software systems are large and complex. Therefore, their technique generally does not work well for complex configurable software systems. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that can generate better confidence intervals for configurable software system performance, especially the complex systems. We suggest to use a deep neural network as the prediction model and develop techniques to perform Bayesian inference on the model in an effective manner given a limited training data. The motivation behind this idea is that deep neural networks are known to be effective in approximating non-linear complex functions  0 1 2 3, including highly configurable software systems . To perform Bayesian inference on the deep neural network, we combine the variational inference 4 and the ensemble method , and thus, creating an ensemble of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) 5 6 [ref]14. Besides, for a configurable software system, it is known that only a small number of configuration options and their interactions have substantial impact on the system performance 7  8, we then construct sparse BNNs so as to incorporate this knowledge into the model. In general, Bayesian inference techniques can generate confidence intervals of the scalar predictions, however, it is well known that these confidence intervals are often inaccurate  9. For example, a generated 95% confidence interval might not contain the ground truth 95% of time. This issue is particularly severe in the configurable software performance prediction problem where the amount of training data is limited, causing the generated confidence intervals even more inaccurate. To tackle this issue, we therefore propose an uncertainty calibration technique inspired by the Platt scaling technique 0 9, but develop it to work with the limited training data scenario. Our uncertainty calibration method is model-diagnostic, i.e. it is general and can be applied to different types of prediction model. Finally, as with any deep learning methods, hyperparameter tuning is a critical process to ensure the deep networks achieve high prediction accuracy within a reasonable training time. In this work, we also propose an efficient and effective hyperparameter tuning technique via Bayesian Optimization, a powerful black-box global optimization method 1. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, BDLPerf, we conduct an extensive set of experiments with ten real-world configurable software systems from different application domains. Our experimental results show that, for both scalar performance prediction and confidence interval estimation, BDLPerf outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on most of the subject systems. In summary, our key contributions are: We propose a Bayesian deep learning model that can generate both scalar predictions and confidence intervals for configurable software performance, and work well with the limited training data scenario. We develop an effective uncertainty calibration method to calibrate the confidence intervals generated by the Bayesian inference techniques for configurable software performance, and an efficient hyperparameter tuning strategy for our proposed model. We implement our proposed method, namely BDLPerf, and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its effectiveness on ten real-world systems and various sampling strategies. Our experimental results show that BDLPerf outperforms existing methods on most subject systems.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: which could lead to system performance issues, negatively affecting their experience.
