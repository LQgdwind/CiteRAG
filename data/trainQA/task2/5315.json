      "content": "Paper Title: Improved NP-Hardness of Approximation for Orthogonality Dimension and Minrank\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA graph G𝐺G is said to be k𝑘k-colorable if its vertices can be colored by k𝑘k colors such that every two adjacent vertices receive distinct colors.\nThe chromatic number of G𝐺G, denoted by χ​(G)𝜒𝐺\\chi(G), is the smallest integer k𝑘k for which G𝐺G is k𝑘k-colorable.\nAs a fundamental and popular graph quantity, the chromatic number has received a considerable amount of attention in the literature from a computational perspective, as described below. The problem of deciding whether a graph G𝐺G satisfies χ​(G)≤3𝜒𝐺3\\chi(G)\\leq 3 is one of the classical twenty-one 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-complete problems presented by Karp  in 1972.\nKhanna, Linial, and Safra  proved that it is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard to distinguish between graphs G𝐺G that satisfy χ​(G)≤3𝜒𝐺3\\chi(G)\\leq 3 from those satisfying χ​(G)≥5𝜒𝐺5\\chi(G)\\geq 5. This result, combined with the approach of Garey and Johnson [ref]15 and with a result of Stahl , implies that for every k≥6𝑘6k\\geq 6, it is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard to decide whether a graph G𝐺G satisfies χ​(G)≤k𝜒𝐺𝑘\\chi(G)\\leq k or χ​(G)≥2​k−2𝜒𝐺2𝑘2\\chi(G)\\geq 2k-2.\nBrakensiek and Guruswami  proved that for every k≥3𝑘3k\\geq 3, it is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard to distinguish between the cases χ​(G)≤k𝜒𝐺𝑘\\chi(G)\\leq k and χ​(G)≥2​k−1𝜒𝐺2𝑘1\\chi(G)\\geq 2k-1, and the 2​k−12𝑘12k-1 bound was further improved to 2​k2𝑘2k by Barto, Bulín, Krokhin, and Opršal .\nFor large values of k𝑘k, it was shown by Khot  that it is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard to decide whether a graph G𝐺G satisfies χ​(G)≤k𝜒𝐺𝑘\\chi(G)\\leq k or χ​(G)≥kΩ​(log⁡k)𝜒𝐺superscript𝑘Ω𝑘\\chi(G)\\geq k^{\\Omega(\\log k)}, and the latter condition was strengthened to χ​(G)≥2k1/3𝜒𝐺superscript2superscript𝑘13\\chi(G)\\geq 2^{k^{1/3}} by Huang .\nA substantial improvement was recently obtained by Wrochna and Živný 0, who proved that for every k≥4𝑘4k\\geq 4, it is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard to decide whether a given graph G𝐺G satisfies χ​(G)≤k𝜒𝐺𝑘\\chi(G)\\leq k or χ​(G)≥(k⌊k/2⌋)𝜒𝐺binomial𝑘𝑘2\\chi(G)\\geq\\binom{k}{\\lfloor k/2\\rfloor}.\nThe proof of this result combined the hardness result of  with the construction of line digraphs  and with a result of Poljak and Rödl .\nNote that under certain variants of the Unique Games Conjecture, stronger hardness results are known to hold, namely, hardness of deciding whether a given graph G𝐺G satisfies χ​(G)≤k1𝜒𝐺subscript𝑘1\\chi(G)\\leq k_{1} or χ​(G)≥k2𝜒𝐺subscript𝑘2\\chi(G)\\geq k_{2} for all integers k2>k1≥3subscript𝑘2subscript𝑘13k_{2}>k_{1}\\geq 3  (see also ). The present paper studies the computational complexity of algebraic variants of the chromatic number of graphs.\nA k𝑘k-dimensional orthogonal representation of a graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) over a field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} is an assignment of a vector uv∈𝔽ksubscript𝑢𝑣superscript𝔽𝑘u_{v}\\in\\mathbb{F}^{k} with ⟨uv,uv⟩≠0subscript𝑢𝑣subscript𝑢𝑣0\\langle u_{v},u_{v}\\rangle\\neq 0 to each vertex v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V, such that for every two adjacent vertices v𝑣v and v′superscript𝑣′v^{\\prime} it holds that ⟨uv,uv′⟩=0subscript𝑢𝑣subscript𝑢superscript𝑣′0\\langle u_{v},u_{v^{\\prime}}\\rangle=0. Here, for two vectors x,y∈𝔽k𝑥𝑦superscript𝔽𝑘x,y\\in\\mathbb{F}^{k}, we consider the standard inner product defined by ⟨x,y⟩=∑i=1kxi​yi𝑥𝑦superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑘subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖\\langle x,y\\rangle=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}{x_{i}y_{i}} with operations over 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F}.\nThe orthogonality dimension of G𝐺G over 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F}, denoted by ξ¯𝔽​(G)subscript¯𝜉𝔽𝐺\\overline{\\xi}_{\\mathbb{F}}(G), is the smallest integer k𝑘k for which G𝐺G admits a k𝑘k-dimensional orthogonal representation over 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} (see Remark 2.2).\nIt can be easily seen that for every graph G𝐺G and for every field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F}, it holds that ξ¯𝔽​(G)≤χ​(G)subscript¯𝜉𝔽𝐺𝜒𝐺\\overline{\\xi}_{\\mathbb{F}}(G)\\leq\\chi(G). In addition, if 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} is a fixed finite field or the real field ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}, it further holds that ξ¯𝔽​(G)≥Ω​(log⁡χ​(G))subscript¯𝜉𝔽𝐺Ω𝜒𝐺\\overline{\\xi}_{\\mathbb{F}}(G)\\geq\\Omega(\\log\\chi(G)).\nBoth bounds are known to be tight in the worst case (see Claim 2.8 and [33, Chapter 10]).\nThe study of orthogonal representations and orthogonality dimension was initiated in the seminal work of Lovász  on the ϑitalic-ϑ\\vartheta-function and has found applications in various areas, e.g., information theory , graph theory , and quantum communication complexity [9, Chapter 8.5]. The interest in the hardness of determining the orthogonality dimension of graphs dates back to a paper of Lovász, Saks, and Schrijver , where it was noted that the problem seems difficult.\nThe aforementioned relations between the chromatic number and the orthogonality dimension yield that hardness of deciding whether a graph G𝐺G satisfies χ​(G)≤k1𝜒𝐺subscript𝑘1\\chi(G)\\leq k_{1} or χ​(G)≥k2𝜒𝐺subscript𝑘2\\chi(G)\\geq k_{2} implies the hardness of deciding whether it satisfies ξ¯𝔽​(G)≤k1subscript¯𝜉𝔽𝐺subscript𝑘1\\overline{\\xi}_{\\mathbb{F}}(G)\\leq k_{1} or ξ¯𝔽​(G)≥Ω​(log⁡k2)subscript¯𝜉𝔽𝐺Ωsubscript𝑘2\\overline{\\xi}_{\\mathbb{F}}(G)\\geq\\Omega(\\log k_{2}), provided that 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} is a finite field or ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}.\nIt therefore follows from  that assuming certain variants of the Unique Games Conjecture, it is hard to decide whether a graph G𝐺G satisfies ξ¯𝔽​(G)≤k1subscript¯𝜉𝔽𝐺subscript𝑘1\\overline{\\xi}_{\\mathbb{F}}(G)\\leq k_{1} or ξ¯𝔽​(G)≥k2subscript¯𝜉𝔽𝐺subscript𝑘2\\overline{\\xi}_{\\mathbb{F}}(G)\\geq k_{2} for all integers k2>k1≥3subscript𝑘2subscript𝑘13k_{2}>k_{1}\\geq 3.\nThis reasoning, however, does not yield 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hardness results for the orthogonality dimension (without additional complexity assumptions), even using the strongest known 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hardness results of the chromatic number.\nYet, a result of Peeters  implies that for every field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F}, it is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard to decide if a given graph G𝐺G satisfies ξ¯𝔽​(G)≤3subscript¯𝜉𝔽𝐺3\\overline{\\xi}_{\\mathbb{F}}(G)\\leq 3, hence it is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard to approximate the orthogonality dimension of a graph over 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} to within any factor smaller than 4/3434/3. Over the reals, the hardness of approximation for the orthogonality dimension was recently extended in  to any factor smaller than 3/2323/2. Another algebraic quantity of graphs is the minrank parameter that was introduced in 1981 by Haemers  in the study of the Shannon capacity of graphs.\nThe minrank parameter was used in   to answer questions of Lovász  and was later applied by Alon [ref]1, with a different formulation, to disprove a conjecture of Shannon .\nThe minrank of a graph G𝐺G over a field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F}, denoted by minrk𝔽(G)subscriptminrk𝔽𝐺{\\mathop{\\mathrm{minrk}}}_{\\mathbb{F}}(G), is closely related to the orthogonality dimension of the complement graph G¯¯𝐺\\overline{G} over 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} and satisfies minrk𝔽(G)≤ξ¯𝔽​(G¯)subscriptminrk𝔽𝐺subscript¯𝜉𝔽¯𝐺{\\mathop{\\mathrm{minrk}}}_{\\mathbb{F}}(G)\\leq\\overline{\\xi}_{\\mathbb{F}}(\\overline{G}).\nThe difference between the two quantities comes, roughly speaking, from the fact that the definition of minrank involves the notion of orthogonal bi-representations rather than orthogonal representations (for the precise definitions, see Section 2.1).\nThe study of the minrank parameter is motivated by various applications in information theory and in theoretical computer science. A prominent one is the well-studied index coding problem, for which the minrank parameter perfectly characterizes the optimal length of its linear solutions, as was shown by Bar-Yossef, Birk, Jayram, and Kol [ref]3 (see Section 2.2). Similarly to the situation of the orthogonality dimension, it was proved in  that for every field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F}, it is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard to decide if a given graph G𝐺G satisfies minrk𝔽(G)≤3subscriptminrk𝔽𝐺3{\\mathop{\\mathrm{minrk}}}_{\\mathbb{F}}(G)\\leq 3. It was further shown by Dau, Skachek, and Chee  that it is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard to decide whether a given digraph G𝐺G satisfies minrk𝔽2(G)≤2subscriptminrksubscript𝔽2𝐺2{\\mathop{\\mathrm{minrk}}}_{\\mathbb{F}_{2}}(G)\\leq 2. Note that for (undirected) graphs, the minrank over any field is at most 222 if and only if the complement graph is bipartite, a property that can be checked in polynomial time.\nMotivated by the computational aspects of the index coding problem, Langberg and Sprintson  related the minrank of a graph to the chromatic number of its complement and derived from  that assuming certain variants of the Unique Games Conjecture, it is hard to decide whether a given graph G𝐺G satisfies minrk𝔽(G)≤k1subscriptminrk𝔽𝐺subscript𝑘1{\\mathop{\\mathrm{minrk}}}_{\\mathbb{F}}(G)\\leq k_{1} or minrk𝔽(G)≥k2subscriptminrk𝔽𝐺subscript𝑘2{\\mathop{\\mathrm{minrk}}}_{\\mathbb{F}}(G)\\geq k_{2}, provided that k2>k1≥3subscript𝑘2subscript𝑘13k_{2}>k_{1}\\geq 3 and that 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} is a finite field.\nSimilar hardness results were obtained in  for additional settings of the index coding problem, including the general (non-linear) index coding problem over a constant-size alphabet.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: to distinguish between graphs G𝐺G that satisfy χ​(G)≤3𝜒𝐺3\\chi(G)\\leq 3 from those satisfying χ​(G)≥5𝜒𝐺5\\chi(G)\\geq 5.
