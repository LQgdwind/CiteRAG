Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Reconstructive Sequence-Graph Network for Video Summarization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNowadays, huge amounts of video data are captured and shared online as the result of the ubiquitous cameras  [ref]48. There is an imperative requirement for automatic tools to handle the large-scale video data, so that the viewers can browse them efficiently. Video summarization is the typical task raised under this background . Video summarization condenses the original video into a short summary meanwhile preserves the main content. There are several summary formats, including storyboard , skimming , and synopsis [ref]21. In this paper, we focus on the most popular one, i.e., video skimming, which is formed by several key-shots. It provides a viewer-friendly way for video browsing and can be used for many subsequent video analysis tasks  [ref]22. Lots of video summarization approaches have been proposed in the literature. Among them, RNN-based approaches have gained significant attention recently 2 [ref]48  . In general, these approaches cast the video data as a sequence of frames, and summarize the video by exploiting the temporal dependencies lying in the sequence. Although RNN-based approaches have made tremendous progress, these sequence models have inherent drawbacks. Specifically, they are capable of capturing the local neighborhood dependencies, but usually fail to handle the global long-distance ones and are easily distracted by noise  .\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: Nowadays, huge amounts of video data are captured and shared online as the result of the ubiquitous cameras  [ref]48.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
