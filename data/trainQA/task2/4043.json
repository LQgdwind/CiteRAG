In general, RNNs with simple output distributions often struggle to capture highly variable and structured sequential data (e.g., multimodal behaviors) .\nRecent work in sequential generative models addressed this issue by injecting stochastic latent variables into the model and optimization using amortized variational inference to learn the latent variables (e.g.,  [ref]17 ). Among these methods, a variational RNN (VRNN)  has been widely used in base models for multi-agent trajectories [ref]51  [ref]19 with unknown governing equations.\nA VRNN is essentially a variational autoencoder (VAE) conditioned on the hidden state of an RNN and is trained by maximizing the (sequential) evidence lower-bound (ELBO), described in Appendix A. Next, we overview a graph neural network (GNN) based on .\nLet vksubscript𝑣𝑘v_{k} be a feature vector for each node k𝑘k of K𝐾K agents.\nNext, a feature vector for each edge e(k,j)subscript𝑒𝑘𝑗e_{(k,j)} is computed based on the nodes to which it is connected.\nThe edge feature vectors are sent as “messages” to each of the connected nodes to compute their new output state oksubscript𝑜𝑘o_{k}.\nFormally, a single round of message passing operations of a graph net is characterized below: where N​(k)𝑁𝑘N(k) is the set of neighbors of node k𝑘k, and fesubscript𝑓𝑒f_{e} and fvsubscript𝑓𝑣f_{v} are neural networks.\nIn summary, a GNN takes in feature vectors v1:Ksubscript𝑣:1𝐾v_{1:K} and outputs a vector for each node o1:Ksubscript𝑜:1𝐾o_{1:K}, i.e., o1:K=GNN​(v1:K)subscript𝑜:1𝐾GNNsubscript𝑣:1𝐾o_{1:K}={\\mathrm{GNN}}(v_{1:K}).\nThe operations of the GNN satisfy the permutation equivariance property as the edge construction is symmetric between pairs of nodes and the summation operator ignores the ordering of the edges . Next, we describe GVRNN [ref]51, which models the interactions between them at each step using GNNs.\nLet x≤T={x1,…,xT}subscript𝑥absent𝑇subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑇x_{\\leq T}=\\{x_{1},\\dots,x_{T}\\} denote a sequence of locations.\nIn this paper, GVRNN update equations are as follows: where htsubscriptℎ𝑡h_{t} and ztsubscript𝑧𝑡z_{t} are deterministic and stochastic latent variables.\npθ​(xt∣z≤t,x<t)subscript𝑝𝜃conditionalsubscript𝑥𝑡subscript𝑧absent𝑡subscript𝑥absent𝑡p_{\\theta}(x_{t}\\mid z_{\\leq t},x_{<t}), qϕ​(zt∣x≤t,z<t)subscript𝑞italic-ϕconditionalsubscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑥absent𝑡subscript𝑧absent𝑡q_{\\phi}(z_{t}\\mid x_{\\leq t},z_{<t}), and pθ​(zt∣x<t,z<t)subscript𝑝𝜃conditionalsubscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑥absent𝑡subscript𝑧absent𝑡p_{\\theta}(z_{t}\\mid x_{<t},z_{<t}) are generative model, the approximate posterior or inference model, and the prior model, respectively.\n𝒩(⋅|μ,σ2)\\mathcal{N}(\\cdot|\\mu,\\sigma^{2}) denotes a multivariate normal distribution with mean μ𝜇\\mu and covariance matrix diag(σ2superscript𝜎2\\sigma^{2}), and The prior network GNNprisubscriptGNNpri{\\mathrm{GNN_{pri}}}, encoder GNNencsubscriptGNNenc{\\mathrm{GNN_{enc}}}, and decoder GNNdecsubscriptGNNdec{\\mathrm{GNN_{dec}}} are GNNs with learnable parameters ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi and θ𝜃\\theta.\nHere we used the mean value μt+1,1:Kdecsubscriptsuperscript𝜇dec:𝑡11𝐾\\mu^{\\mathrm{dec}}_{t+1,1:K} as input variables x^t+1l′subscriptsuperscript^𝑥superscript𝑙′𝑡1\\hat{x}^{l^{\\prime}}_{t+1} in the following theory-based computation.\nGVRNN is trained by maximizing the sequential ELBO in a similar way to VRNN as described in Appendix 0.C.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: sequential generative models addressed this issue by injecting stochastic latent variables into the model and optimization using amortized variational inference to learn the latent variables (e.g.,  [ref]17 ).
