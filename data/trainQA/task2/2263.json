      "content": "Paper Title: Counterfactual Explanations for Arbitrary Regression Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnlike existing work [ref]55  [ref]14, we take a global optimisation perspective on the\nproblem of finding CFEs by leveraging Bayesian optimisation   ,\na technique that is sample-efficient and has known convergence guarantees.\nBO can be applied to non-differentiable models as it searches over\nthe posterior distribution of a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate,\nand is thus applicable to models outside\nCFX-Potental-Globalopt, like decision trees. However, as we show in Section 4, taking a naïve approach to using BO in this setting can lead to very poor performance. This can be attributed to the following question: should the surrogate just predict f𝑓f\nor the entire composition ρ∘f𝜌𝑓\\rho\\circ f?\nWe argue that the former is better ,\nsince it makes our algorithm more effective and parallelisable by leveraging structure in the potential. Suppose we have a model f𝑓f that is continuous over ℝℝ\\operatorname{\\mathbb{R}}\nand have sampled f​(0)=0𝑓00f\\!\\left(0\\right)=0 and f​(1)=2𝑓12f\\!\\left(1\\right)=2 under a potential\nρ​(y)=y2​e−y2𝜌𝑦superscript𝑦2superscript𝑒superscript𝑦2\\rho\\!\\left(y\\right)=y^{2}e^{-y^{2}}, yielding ρ​(0)=0𝜌00\\rho\\!\\left(0\\right)=0 and ρ​(2)=4​e−4𝜌24superscript𝑒4\\rho\\!\\left(2\\right)=4e^{-4}.\nThe intermediate value theorem now implies that that there exists some z∈(0,1)𝑧01z\\in\\left(0,1\\right) with f​(z)=1𝑓𝑧1f\\!\\left(z\\right)=1 such that (ρ∘f)​(z)𝜌𝑓𝑧(\\rho\\!\\circ\\!f)\\!(z) attains its maximum value of e−1superscript𝑒1e^{-1}.\nA surrogate that models the composition ρ∘f𝜌𝑓\\rho\\circ f\nwill not be guaranteed to attain this maximum.\nFigure 3 shows corroborating numerical evidence\nfrom a simple experiment, searching for\ncounterfactuals for a logistic regression model with two features.\nWe formulate the CF search using two different Bayesian optimisation problems,\n(a) using the explicit form of our EP potential ρ𝜌\\rho and modeling f𝑓f with the surrogate,\nand (b) modeling the composition ρ∘f𝜌𝑓\\rho\\circ f with the surrogate.\nThe former shows rapid convergence to the target set (red line),\nwith the acquisition function recovering the desired set with just 7 or 8 samples.\nIn contrast, the acquisition function of (b) does not show any meaningful\nconvergence even after 8 samples. To formalise our proposed method as a Bayesian optimisation problem we first take a scalar regression model f:𝒳→ℝ:𝑓→𝒳ℝf:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\operatorname{\\mathbb{R}} and define the surrogate\nf^^𝑓\\hat{f} as being drawn from a GP prior, 𝒢​𝒫​(μ,K)𝒢𝒫𝜇𝐾\\mathcal{GP}\\!\\left(\\mu,K\\right),\nwith mean function μ:𝒳→ℝ:𝜇→𝒳ℝ\\mu:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\operatorname{\\mathbb{R}} and covariance function K:𝒳×𝒳→ℝ:𝐾→𝒳𝒳ℝK:\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{X}\\to\\operatorname{\\mathbb{R}}. Given a dataset 𝒟n≐{(xi,f​(xi))}i∈[n]approaches-limitsubscript𝒟𝑛subscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑓subscript𝑥𝑖𝑖delimited-[]𝑛\\mathcal{D}_{n}\\doteq\\left\\{\\left(x_{i},f(x_{i})\\right)\\right\\}_{i\\in[n]} we can also compute the\nposterior distribution 𝒢​𝒫​(μn,Kn)𝒢𝒫subscript𝜇𝑛subscript𝐾𝑛\\mathcal{GP}\\!\\left(\\mu_{n},K_{n}\\right),\nwhere the conditioned mean and covariance functions, μn:𝒳→ℝ:subscript𝜇𝑛→𝒳ℝ\\mu_{n}:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\operatorname{\\mathbb{R}} and Kn:𝒳×𝒳→ℝ:subscript𝐾𝑛→𝒳𝒳ℝK_{n}:\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{X}\\to\\operatorname{\\mathbb{R}}, can be evaluated in closed\nform [ref]44.\nOur novel acquisition function for performing (potential-based)\ncounterfactual search then follows by a refinement of the well-known expected\nimprovement function  . As shown in\nProposition 3.1 and Figure 3,\nthis function admits “well-behaved,”\nclosed-form expressions for its value and derivative. For a surrogate-potential pair (f^,ρ)^𝑓𝜌(\\hat{f},\\rho), define the expected\ncounterfactual improvement as where 𝔼n[X]≐𝔼[X|𝒟n]\\mathbb{E}_{n}\\!\\left[X\\right]\\doteq\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[X~{}\\middle|~{}\\mathcal{D}_{n}\\right]\nis an expectation conditioned on a set of n𝑛n samples\n𝒟n≐{(xi,f​(xi))}i∈[n]approaches-limitsubscript𝒟𝑛subscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑓subscript𝑥𝑖𝑖delimited-[]𝑛\\mathcal{D}_{n}\\doteq\\left\\{\\left(x_{i},f(x_{i})\\right)\\right\\}_{i\\in[n]},\nρn⋆≐maxi⁡{ρ​(f​(xi)):(xi,f​(xi))∈𝒟n}approaches-limitsubscriptsuperscript𝜌⋆𝑛subscript𝑖:𝜌𝑓subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖𝑓subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝒟𝑛\\rho^{\\star}_{n}\\doteq\\max_{i}\\left\\{\\rho(f(x_{i})):(x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\in\\mathcal{D}_{n}\\right\\}\nis the maximum potential observed over these samples,\nand ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi is the standard normal probability density function. EI-CFX and ∇EI-CFX∇EI-CFX\\nabla\\textrm{EI-CFX} are continuous functions of 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} for any ρ∈{ρAEP+,ρAEP−,ρSEP}𝜌superscript𝜌subscriptAEPsuperscript𝜌subscriptAEPsuperscript𝜌SEP\\rho\\in\\{\\rho^{\\textrm{AEP}_{+}},\\rho^{\\textrm{AEP}_{-}},\\rho^{\\textrm{SEP}}\\} or n≥1𝑛1n\\geq 1. Identify the 0-superlevel sets and replace the max\\max operation with refined limits of integration. The rest follows through routine analysis of Gaussian integrals; see Appendix B.\n∎ Under our composite structure of modeling just f𝑓f with the surrogate,\nwe can show that Bayesian optimisation using EI-CFX converges\nasymptotically to a globally optimal counterfactual. In other words, assuming\nthat the counterfactual sets 𝒮ρεsubscriptsuperscript𝒮𝜀𝜌\\mathcal{S}^{\\varepsilon}_{\\rho} are non-empty for\nall ε≥0𝜀0\\varepsilon\\geq 0, our proposed algorithm is guaranteed to find a point\nc∈𝒮q0𝑐subscriptsuperscript𝒮0𝑞c\\in\\mathcal{S}^{0}_{q} in the limit of infinitely many observations, n→∞→𝑛n\\rightarrow\\infty. This\nresult, which we state informally below, establishes our algorithm as the first\nmethod for finding CFEs for regression models with\nglobal convergence guarantees. This proof holds even for\nnon-differentiable models,\nwhich is a key advantage over past approaches [ref]55  [ref]14,\nand motivates a wider adoption of Bayesian optimisation for solving\ninstances of CFX-Potential-Globalopt and related problems in this area. The EI-CFX acquisition function is asymptotically consistent. Follows directly from Theorem 1 of Astudillo and Frazier ; see Appendix C.\n∎ Global convergence and improved use of information are not the only advantages\nof exploiting composition structure. With this approach, we are also able\nto generate multiple counterfactuals in a single pass by treating the search\nas a multi-objective problem 1 [ref]14, as the\nn𝑛n-sample dataset 𝒟nsubscript𝒟𝑛\\mathcal{D}_{n} is entirely\nindependent of the particular choice of potential. This contrasts with\nthe alternative approach in which the potential is treated as part of the\nblack-box, is modelled end-to-end by the surrogate, and leaves us with a set of\nsamples that pertain only to a single counterfactual question. Here we can\nsolve an arbitrary number of acquisition functions at each step and make use of\nthe wider, shared dataset to bootstrap the search process,\nwhich can lead to improved convergence rates and fewer samples being needed.\n\nReference markers found: [55]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]55: Unlike existing work [ref]55  [ref]14, we take a global optimisation perspective on the\nproblem of finding CFEs by leveraging Bayesian optimisation   ,\na technique that is sample-efficient and has known convergence\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
