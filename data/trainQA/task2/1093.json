      "content": "Paper Title: XLVIN: eXecuted Latent Value Iteration Nets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nValue iteration is a successive approximation method for finding the optimal value function of a discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs) as the fixed-point of the so-called Bellman optimality operator [ref]35. A discounted MDP is a tuple (𝒮,𝒜,R,P,γ)𝒮𝒜𝑅𝑃𝛾({\\cal S},{\\cal A},R,P,\\gamma) where s∈𝒮𝑠𝒮s\\in{\\cal S} are states, a∈𝒜𝑎𝒜a\\in{\\cal A} are actions, R:𝒮×𝒜→ℝ:𝑅→𝒮𝒜ℝR:{\\cal S}\\times{\\cal A}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} is a reward function, P:𝒮×𝒜→Dist​(𝒮):𝑃→𝒮𝒜Dist𝒮P:{\\cal S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\text{Dist}(\\mathcal{S}) is a transition function such that P​(s′|s,a)𝑃conditionalsuperscript𝑠′𝑠𝑎P(s^{\\prime}|s,a) is the conditional probability of transitioning to state s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} when the agent executes action a𝑎a in state s𝑠s, and γ∈ 𝛾01\\gamma\\in  is a discount factor which trades off between the relevance of immediate and future rewards. In the infinite horizon discounted setting, an agent sequentially chooses actions according to a stationary Markov policy π:𝒮×𝒜→ :𝜋→𝒮𝒜01\\pi:{\\cal S}\\times{\\cal A}\\rightarrow  such that π​(a|s)𝜋conditional𝑎𝑠\\pi(a|s) is a conditional probability distribution over actions given a state. The return is defined as Gt=∑k=0∞γk​R​(at+k,st+k)subscript𝐺𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑘0superscript𝛾𝑘𝑅subscript𝑎𝑡𝑘subscript𝑠𝑡𝑘G_{t}=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\gamma^{k}R(a_{t+k},s_{t+k}).

In the infinite horizon discounted setting, we know that there exists an optimal stationary Markov policy π∗superscript𝜋\\pi^{*} such that for any policy π𝜋\\pi it holds that Vπ∗​(s)≥Vπ​(s)superscript𝑉superscript𝜋𝑠superscript𝑉𝜋𝑠V^{\\pi^{*}}(s)\\geq V^{\\pi}(s) for all s∈𝒮𝑠𝒮s\\in{\\cal S}. Furthermore, such optimal policy can be deterministic – greedy – with respect to the optimal values. Therefore, in order to find a π∗superscript𝜋\\pi^{*} it suffices to find the unique optimal value function V⋆superscript𝑉⋆V^{\\star} as the fixed-point of the Bellman optimality operator. Value iteration is in fact the instantiation of the method of successive approximation method for finding the fixed-point of a contractive operator. The optimal value function V⋆superscript𝑉⋆V^{\\star} is such a fixed-point and satisfies the Bellman optimality equations : The TransE  loss for embedding objects and relations can be adapted to RL. State embeddings are obtained by an encoder z:𝒮→ℝk:𝑧→𝒮superscriptℝ𝑘z:{\\cal S}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{k}\nand the effect of an action in a given state is modelled by a translation model T:ℝk×𝒜→ℝk:𝑇→superscriptℝ𝑘𝒜superscriptℝ𝑘T:\\mathbb{R}^{k}\\times{\\cal A}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{k}. Specifically, T​(z​(s),a)𝑇𝑧𝑠𝑎T(z(s),a) is a translation vector to be added to z​(s)𝑧𝑠z(s) in order to obtain an embedding of the resulting state when taking action a𝑎a in state s𝑠s.111For stochastic MDPs, the resulting embedding should be understood as an expectation under P​(s′|s,a)𝑃conditionalsuperscript𝑠′𝑠𝑎P(s^{\\prime}|s,a). Such embeddings should also be far away from all other states z​(s~)𝑧~𝑠z(\\tilde{s}). Therefore, the embedding functions are optimized using the following variant of the triplet loss: where ξ𝜉\\xi is the hyperparameter of the hinge loss, (s,a,s′)𝑠𝑎superscript𝑠′(s,a,s^{\\prime}) is a transition in a given MDP and s~~𝑠\\tilde{s} is a negative sample state. Trajectories sampled from the MDP can be used as a training set of positive triplets (s,a,s′)𝑠𝑎superscript𝑠′(s,a,s^{\\prime}), whereas negative triplets (s,a,s~)𝑠𝑎~𝑠(s,a,\\tilde{s}) are obtained by sampling s~~𝑠\\tilde{s} uniformly at random. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been intensively studied as a tool to process graph-structured inputs, and were successfully applied to various RL tasks   . GNN operations are commonly expressed through the message passing framework 8. For each node i𝑖i in the graph, a set of messages is computed—one message for each neighbouring node j𝑗j, derived by applying a message function M𝑀M to the relevant node and edge features (h→i,h→j,e→i​j)subscript→ℎ𝑖subscript→ℎ𝑗subscript→𝑒𝑖𝑗(\\vec{h}_{i},\\vec{h}_{j},\\vec{e}_{ij}). Incoming messages in a neighbourhood 𝒩​(i)𝒩𝑖\\mathcal{N}(i) are then aggregated through a permutation-invariant operator ⨁direct-sum\\bigoplus (such as sum or max), obtaining a summarised message m→isubscript→𝑚𝑖\\vec{m}_{i}: The features of node i𝑖i are then updated through a function U𝑈U applied to these summarised messages: An important research direction explores the use of neural networks for learning to execute algorithms—which was recently extended to algorithms on graph-structured data . In particular,  establishes algorithmic alignment between GNNs and dynamic programming algorithms. Furthermore,  show that supervising the GNN on the algorithm’s intermediate results is highly beneficial for out-of-distribution generalization. As VI is, in fact, a dynamic programming algorithm, a GNN executor is a suitable choice for learning it, and good results on executing VI have emerged on synthetic graphs 1.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: iteration is a successive approximation method for finding the optimal value function of a discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs) as the fixed-point of the so-called Bellman optimality operator [ref]35.
