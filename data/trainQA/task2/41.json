      "content": "Paper Title: Towards a Framework for Certification of Reliable Autonomous Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTables 1 to 5 present\nsome standards grouped by domains where autonomy potentially plays a crucial\nrole. The most sophisticated illustrative examples in Section 4\nare taken from these domains. We do not claim this to be either exhaustive or\nsystematic: this section is only meant to give the reader an idea of the\ncomplexity and wide variety of existing standards by providing examples issued\nby different organisations. It is important to note that there is a vast\narray of standards, many of which are never used by any regulator. Table 1 illustrates some standards in the robotics domain. Most of them come from ISO. A Technical Committee of the ISO created in 2015  is in charge of the standardisation of different robotics fields, excluding toys and military applications. In 2015, IEEE developed an ontology for agreeing on a shared terminology in robotics, and delivered it as a standard. Table 2 summarises some facts of one IEC standard dealing with medical equipment. Many standards in this domain exist, also delivered by ISO which issued more than 400 standards focusing on health  thanks to three Technical Committees dealing with medical equipment    and one dealing with health informatics . We selected  as an example from the medical technologies domain, because it focusses on equipments with ‘a degree of autonomy’. Nearly 900 ISO standards have been developed for the automotive sector . One of the influential is the ISO 26262 , born as an adaptation of the Functional Safety standard IEC 61508 for Automotive Electric/Electronic Systems . Published in 12 individual parts, ISO 26262 has been updated in 2018 to keep abreast of today’s new and rapidly evolving technologies, and be relevant to even more applications. IEEE is also developing standards in the automotive sector, ranging from public safety in transportation-related events  to system image quality . More than three dozen IEC technical committees and subcommittees cover the standardisation of equipment used in and related to road vehicles as well as of other associated issues. As an example, the IEC TC 69  is preparing international standards for road vehicles, totally or partly electrically propelled from self-contained power sources, and for electric industrial trucks. Table 3 presents one standard for each of the three organisations above, ISO, IEEE, and IEC. Compared to other domains, railway homologation and operation is strictly regulated. The IEC Technical Committee 9  is responsible for the international standardisation of the electrical equipment and systems used in railways. The ISO Technical Committee 269  complements IEC TC 9 by addressing the standardisation of all systems, products and services specifically related to the railway sector, not already covered by IEC TC 9.\nBoth work in close relationship with the International Union of Railways (UIC, ) and the International Association of Public Transport (UITP, ).\nThrough the CENELEC 50128 standard [ref]49, CENELEC assesses the conformity of software for use in railway control which may have impact on safety, i.e., software whose failures can affect safety functions.\nTable 4 exemplifies standards in the railway sector by presenting one standard from ISO dealing with project management, one series from IEC dealing with reliability, availability, maintainability and safety, and the CENELEC 50128 standard. The quantity of existing standards in the aerospace domain is huge. Established in 1947,\nISO/TC 20  is one of the oldest and\nmost prolific ISO technical\ncommittees.\nIEEE has published nearly 60 standards dealing with aerospace electronics, and IEC has two Technical Committees dealing with avionics-related issues  : these committees developed about 30 standards.\nOther relevant standards bodies must be mentioned as well. The mission of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA, ) is to ensure the highest common level of safety protection for EU citizens and of environmental protection; to provide a single regulatory and certification process among Member States; to facilitate the internal aviation single market and create a level playing field; and to work with other international aviation organisations and regulators.\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA, ) summarises its mission as ‘to provide the safest, most efficient aerospace system in the world’. Finally, the US Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA, ) aims at being ‘the premier Public-Private Partnership venue for developing consensus among diverse and competing interests on resolutions critical to aviation modernisation issues in an increasingly global enterprise’.\nIn Table 5 we present standards from EASA, FAA, and RTCA, including two standards dealing with Unmanned\nAircraft Systems and drones. Having reviewed relevant standards in various domains, we next turn to briefly reviewing techniques for certification of software systems.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: by IEC TC 9.\nBoth work in close relationship with the International Union of Railways (UIC, ) and the International Association of Public Transport (UITP, ).\nThrough the CENELEC 50128 standard [ref]49, CENELEC assesses the conformity of software for use in railway control which may have impact on safety, i.e., software whose failures can affect safety functions.\nTable 4 exemplifies\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
