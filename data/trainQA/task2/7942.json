Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Fast-OverlaPIM: A Fast Overlap-driven Mapping Framework for Processing In-Memory Neural Network Acceleration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nChen et al.  reduce DNN latency by proposing the row-stationary mapping of Eyeriss to minimize data movement with weight sharing and data fusion. Parashar et al  explore a large design space and develop the Timeloop framework to accommodate flexible architectures while searching for the optimal mapping. Timeloop employs a near-exhaustive search strategy to identify efficient mappings, taking into account the size of operation spaces to calculate mapping latencies. Other works [ref]22 [ref]20 also propose ASIC frameworks for mapping optimization through searching. Huang et al. [ref]23 and Zhao et al.  improve machine learning latency by solving optimization problems. Although the above approaches increase performance, their emphasis lies on single-layer mapping optimization without considering data movement between consecutive layers. Consequently, their designs may not fully support the spatial architecture of PIM.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: the optimal mapping.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
