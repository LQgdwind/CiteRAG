      "content": "Paper Title: Intrinsically motivated option learning: a comparative study of recent methods\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEmpowerment [ref]4 has been studied throughout various fields, ranging from behavioral science, across evolutionary biology to artificial intelligence. According to [ref]4, empowerment encapsulates both the amount of influence the agent can exert on the environment, as well as how much of that influence it can perceive. Compared to standard RL state values, which encapsulate the environment-provided reward benefit, it shares the same exploitative nature, but instead measures state value by the agent’s ability to reliably influence its own future. It is thus fundamentally a state value estimate, which has the benefit of having the success criterion independent of any particular environment-defined reward structure. Salge et al. [ref]4 originally express empowerment as the mutual information (MI) between the agent’s actuators and percepts obtained by acting out the actuator output, and assume an open-loop policy, whereby the agent chooses its actions with no regard to the current state. Gregor er al. [ref]5 introduce the concept of empowerment to the closed-loop policy RL setting, and replace actuators with options ΩΩ\\Omega, and percepts with terminating states sfsubscript𝑠𝑓s_{f}. Empowerment is formalised by (1). It should express how much influence the agent has over the environment, which (1) achieves by maximizing the entropy of reachable final states sfsubscript𝑠𝑓s_{f} given that the option was initiated in s0subscript𝑠0s_{0}, ℋ​(sf|s0)ℋconditionalsubscript𝑠𝑓subscript𝑠0\\mathcal{H}(s_{f}|s_{0}). Agents should further be able to determine which option has brought them to sfsubscript𝑠𝑓s_{f}, corresponding to the conditional entropy ℋ​(sf|Ω,s0)ℋconditionalsubscript𝑠𝑓Ωsubscript𝑠0\\mathcal{H}(s_{f}|\\Omega,s_{0}) minimization. The final objective of [ref]5 is to maximize the MI\n Gregor et al. [ref]5 exploit the fact that mutual information is symmetric to obtain (1b), which contains the conditional probability of options given states that can be interpreted as a policy. More specifically, ℋ​(Ω|s0)ℋconditionalΩsubscript𝑠0\\mathcal{H}(\\Omega|s_{0}) in (1b) involves the controllability distribution pC​(Ω|s0)superscript𝑝𝐶conditionalΩsubscript𝑠0p^{C}(\\Omega|s_{0}) [ref]5, which roughly corresponds to the policy over options [ref]2 that reasons in a coarser temporal domain. Once an option ΩΩ\\Omega is drawn from pC​(Ω|s0)superscript𝑝𝐶conditionalΩsubscript𝑠0p^{C}(\\Omega|s_{0}), the corresponding intra-option policy π​(a|s,Ω)𝜋conditional𝑎𝑠Ω\\pi(a|s,\\Omega) is followed until sfsubscript𝑠𝑓s_{f} is reached. Together with the option-conditioned transition model pJ​(sf|Ω,s0)superscript𝑝𝐽conditionalsubscript𝑠𝑓Ωsubscript𝑠0p^{J}(s_{f}|\\Omega,s_{0}) it allows for drawing a close connection to the policy gradient theorem , which translates (1) to the RL setting. The empowered agent reasoning across multiple time scales proposed in [ref]5 is given in Algorithm 1. Instead of using extrinsic, environment-provided reward structure, it maximizes rIsubscript𝑟𝐼r_{I}, which is obtained as a direct consequence of the connection of objective (1) to the policy gradient theorem , and defined in the algorithm below. Finally, both pC​(Ω|s0)superscript𝑝𝐶conditionalΩsubscript𝑠0p^{C}(\\Omega|s_{0}) and p​(Ω|sf,s0)𝑝conditionalΩsubscript𝑠𝑓subscript𝑠0p(\\Omega|s_{f},s_{0}) are represented as neural networks with parameters θ𝜃\\theta and ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi, respectively, where the latter is written as qϕ​(Ω|sf,s0)subscript𝑞italic-ϕconditionalΩsubscript𝑠𝑓subscript𝑠0q_{\\phi}(\\Omega|s_{f},s_{0}) to signify that it is formally obtained using a variational approach 1 applied to (1). The principal issue reported in [ref]5 is the problem of exploration. Namely, the term log⁡qϕ​(Ω|sf,s0)subscript𝑞italic-ϕconditionalΩsubscript𝑠𝑓subscript𝑠0\\log q_{\\phi}(\\Omega|s_{f},s_{0}) will penalize the agent when it encounters previously unseen states, as the discriminator has not yet learned to associate those states with options that have just discovered them, actively discouraging exploration. This is not surprising however, as according to the empowerment principle agents should be aware of their influence over the environment, which in this concrete realization of empowerment refers to being able to determine options from states they visit. According to the other postulate of empowerment, agents should maximize their influence over the environment, which should push the agents to explore in order to balance out the previous penalty. This should be achieved by maximizing the second term −log⁡pθC​(Ω|s0)superscriptsubscript𝑝𝜃𝐶conditionalΩsubscript𝑠0-\\log p_{\\theta}^{C}(\\Omega|s_{0}), but according to [ref]5 this does not happen when non-linear function approximators are used to estimate intrinsic reward terms. This is because both estimators would need to have converged in order to adequately represent the true empowerment objective, which is not the case during training. The intrinsic reward is thus a noisy learning signal and leads to unstable training. In   the modified empowerment principle is relatively successfully applied to challenging continuous control tasks , with the introduction of a fixed uniform prior p​(Ω)𝑝Ωp(\\Omega) instead of the learned pθC​(Ω|s0)subscriptsuperscript𝑝𝐶𝜃conditionalΩsubscript𝑠0p^{C}_{\\theta}(\\Omega|s_{0}). This solves both problems reported in [ref]5, as the controllability distribution is no longer a neural network and assures the maximum entropy of the second term in rIsubscript𝑟𝐼r_{I}. Unfortunately, this also completely changes the original motivation that has lead to the introduction of options [ref]2. Agents no longer reason on multiple time-scales, as no reasonable composition of options can be achieved since p​(Ω)𝑝Ωp(\\Omega) has no state dependence and is never reinforced. Solutions proposed by   diverge from this point into two separate directions, which we present in the following two subsections.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Empowerment [ref]4 has been studied throughout various fields, ranging from behavioral science, across evolutionary biology to artificial intelligence.
