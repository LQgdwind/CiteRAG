Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

However, when frequent data exchange is met, PS might not be a good choice as it can be overwhelmed by the huge volume of communications , as mentioned above. Later work focus more on all-reduce together with other MPI primitives to form different types of parallization techniques including model parallism [ref]13 , pipeline parallism [ref]15 , and hybrid parallism    . The development of distributed training techniques has substantially accelerated the pace of training larger models  . In Nebula-I, the training environment contains two parts, i.e. intra-cluster and inter-cluster. For the intra-cluster part, existing well-designed parallization techniques such as Megatron  and DeepSpeed  can still be applied. For the inter-cluster part, as the bandwidth limitation exists, specific parallization techniques should be designed to consider both the interactions on computation between different clouds and the overlap between computation and network transfer. In Nebula-I, we have already supported data parallism, pipeline parallism, and model parallism. These techniques can also be assembled to form hybrid parallism. In our following demonstrations that show how Nebula-I works, the overall architecture of parallization for inter-cluster is pipeline parallism.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Using PS is a direct way for distributed training especially data parallelism  [ref]12.
