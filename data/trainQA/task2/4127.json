      "content": "Paper Title: EnergyMatch: Energy-based Pseudo-Labeling for Semi-Supervised Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSemi-Supervised Learning. Research in SSL emerged a few decades ago  4. Since then various directions have been proposed including entropy minimization [ref]9, graph-based methods  4 , and virtual adversarial training . Recent advances in self-training   and consistency regularization   have significantly pushed its frontier. In particular, MeanTeacher  proposes a teacher-student framework where the teacher is updated with an exponential moving average of a student model. Mixup-based methods   incorporate Mixup  into consistency regularization. FixMatch  and UDA  predict pseudo-labels on weakly-augmented views of unlabeled images and train the model to predict those pseudo labels on strongly-augmented views. Most of these state-of-the-art methods use confidence thresholding to retain high-quality pseudo-labels  . Few works have attempted to revise the design of the pseudo-labeling approach. FlexMatch  uses curriculum learning to dynamically adjust the confidence thresholds for different classes, while UPS 9 uses an uncertainty estimation with MC-Dropout , in addition to the confidence score to select pseudo-labels. Our work proposes a different approach for pseudo-labeling. While prior works consider the confidence or uncertainty of model predictions, ours is the first to view the pseudo-labeling process from an “in-distribution vs. out-of-distribution” perspective. In particular, unlike UPS 9, which uses the disagreement between a model ensemble to measure uncertainty in the pseudo-label for an unlabeled instance, we instead use the energy score from a single model’s output to estimate its likelihood of occurrence. We show that this leads to better performance for SSL while being more computationally efficient. Class-Imbalanced Semi-Supervised Learning. While SSL has been extensively studied in the balanced setting in which all categories have (roughly) the same number of instances, class-imbalanced SSL has only begun to be explored recently. A key challenge is to avoid overfitting to the majority classes while capturing the minority classes. Prior works have devised different approaches tailored for this setting.\nDARP 5 refines the pseudo-labels through convex optimization targeted specifically for the imbalanced scenario. CReST  achieves class-rebalancing by pseudo-labeling unlabeled samples with frequency that is inversely proportional to the class frequency. ABC 1 introduces an auxiliary classifier that is trained with class-balanced sampling. Our method is in parallel to these developments; it can be easily integrated into those prior approaches by replacing the confidence-based thresholding with an energy-based one, and achieve significant performance gain. Out-of-Distribution Detection. OOD detection aims to detect outliers that are substantially different from the training data, and is important when deploying ML models to ensure safety and reliability in real-world settings. The softmax score was used as a baseline for OOD detection in 3 but has since been proven to be an unreliable measure by subsequent work 2 3. Improvements have been made in OOD detection through temperatured softmax 2 and the energy score 3. Exploring new methods in OOD detection is not the focus of our work. Instead, we show that leveraging the concept of OOD detection, and in particular, the energy score 9 3 for pseudo-labeling, provides a new perspective in SSL that results in competitive and robust performance.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: Semi-Supervised Learning.
