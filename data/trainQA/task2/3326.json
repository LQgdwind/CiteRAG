      "content": "Paper Title: Impact of Stop Sets on Stopping Active Learning for Text Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOverall, given the large amount of research on stopping methods, there has been relatively less attention given to the impact of different stop sets than to the design and testing of the stopping method computations performed on the stop sets. To our knowledge there is no past work that focuses on investigating the impact of different stop sets on stopping method performance. There has been some consideration of ideas related to stop set impact as an auxiliary topic in several past works, which we explain here. In contrast to all of this past work, the current paper is focused on clarifying the importance and the impact of stop set selection on stopping method performance. A widely applicable stopping method based on model confidence is presented in . The method is intended to be used in AL settings where uncertainty sampling is the query strategy and there is an expectation of a rise-peak-drop pattern in model confidence as AL proceeds. The method in  stops AL based on model confidence measured on a large separate representative set of examples. After each iteration of AL, this method runs the newly learned model over the large set of examples and estimates its confidence. When model confidence consistently drops on the large set of examples, this method indicates AL should stop. Although the term stop set is not used, in  there is some discussion of the set of examples that should be used for measuring model confidence and it is indicated that the set should be a separate large set of examples to minimize the risk of not being representative. There are little concrete details about the set of examples used in the experiments reported in ; it appears the test set might have been used, which would not be ideal as it could lead to overestimating the effectiveness of the stopping method. We experiment with this method using different stop sets and measure the impact of the different stop sets on performance. We refer to this method as Declining Confidence (DC). A widely applicable stopping method based on stabilizing predictions is presented in . This is a particularly important method to investigate because it is widely applicable with few if any restrictions on when it can be used, and it has been found to work well in many settings      [ref]22  . The method stops when successively trained models have high agreement in terms of their predictions on the examples in a large randomly selected set of examples. The authors call this set of examples a stop set . In the main experiments, a large randomly selected fixed set of examples is used as the stop set. There is a small section of the paper that explores how stopping performance is impacted if the stop set is made smaller and it’s found that if the set becomes too small the performance could begin to degrade, but it’s concluded that the size required to be representative could vary depending on dataset and task so future work is needed to determine how large the stop set should be. We experiment with this method using different stop sets and measure the impact of the different stop sets on performance. We refer to this method as Stabilizing Predictions (SP). A theoretical analysis of SP stopping is presented in [ref]15. An equation for the variance in the agreement estimator between successive models is derived, which shows that the variance is inversely proportional to the size of the stop set. The variance estimator is suggested as a principled way to check stop set size in order to make sure reliable estimates of agreement can be obtained. Using labeled data versus using unlabeled data to inform the stopping decision is considered in . The tradeoff is that although the labels might give some extra information, that has to be balanced with the fact that using a stop set of labeled data for many applications will by necessity have to be kept relatively small whereas a stop set of unlabeled data can be large. It has been found that stopping methods that use unlabeled data in their decision are more effective than methods that use labeled data. Two stopping methods are presented in . They are similar to the Declining Confidence (DC) method from . The difference is that whereas the DC method requires a consistent drop in confidence, the methods from  require a consistent period where confidence is not increasing, i.e., it could be staying the same or dropping. Another difference is that the methods were implemented with two different stop sets: the batch set, B𝐵B, and the unlabeled pool, U𝑈U, instead of a large representative set as suggested by . We refer to these methods as Non-increasing Confidence (NC). In  the performance of the NC methods are compared with current state-of-the-art methods, including SP, on a private technology assisted sensitivity review dataset. The conclusion reached in  is that the leading method, SP, stops too aggressively on their private dataset and does not produce a model as well-learned as when using their NC methods. However, it is important to observe that SP was not implemented correctly in the experiments in . Instead of using a large unbiased representative stop set, the remaining unlabeled pool was used as the stop set. We hypothesize that this choice can cause SP to stop more aggressively and confidence-based methods such as DC and NC to stop more conservatively. In the current paper, we show that this is indeed the case and explain the reasons why. We compare the performance of NC with DC, which is not considered in , and quantify how much more conservative DC is on several datasets. We also compare the performance of NC with SP implemented in the normal way, which is not considered in , and find that then SP has compellingly stronger performance.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: .
