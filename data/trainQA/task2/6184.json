      "content": "Paper Title: Pre-RMSNorm and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformers: Equivalent and Efficient Pre-LN Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTransformers have become a successful architecture for a wide range of machine learning applications, including natural language 9, computer vision 3, and reinforcement learning [ref]7.\nIt is one of the foundation models , and pretrained Transformers 9 demonstrated impressive generalization results.\nAmong the components of Transformers, normalization plays a critical role in accelerating and stabilizing the training process 1.\nLayer Normalization (LayerNorm, LN)  and Root Mean Square Normalization (RMSNorm)  are two common normalization layers in Transformers.\nLayerNorm is in the original Transformer architecture 9, recentering and rescaling the input vector in ‚Ñùdsuperscript‚Ñùùëë{\\mathbb{R}}^{d} to obtain a zero-mean and unit-variance output.\nRMSNorm only rescales the input vector with its RMS value, offering greater computational efficiency than LayerNorm. The machine learning community does not reach a consensus regarding the preferred normalization technique for Transformers.\nLayerNorm demonstrates remarkable success in the milestone Transformers, such as GPT   and ViT 3.\nIt is still the default normalization layer when building a new Transformer.\nOn the contrary, RMSNorm is reported to accelerate the training and inference with similar performance as LayerNorm in Transformers.\nIt has gained popularity in recent large language models, such as T5 , Gopher , Chinchilla 6, and LLaMA .\nHowever, concerns persist regarding the potential negative impact of RMSNorm on the representation ability of Transformers.\nIt remains an open question to determine the preferred normalization type for Transformers, requiring further theoretical and empirical investigation. In this work, we aim to mitigate the discrepancy between LayerNorm and RMSNorm in Transformers.\nWhen delving into the prevalent Transformer architectures, Pre-LN and Pre-RMSNorm Transformers,\nwe identify an opportunity to unify them by removing the inherent redundancy in Pre-LN models.\nIn particular, the main branch vectors in the Pre-LN Transformers are always normalized before they are used, implying that the mean information is redundant.\nWe can recenter the main branch without impact on the functionality of the models, which allows us to reduce LayerNorm to RMSNorm. We further propose Compressed RMSNorm (CRMSNorm), which takes a vector in ‚Ñùd‚àí1superscript‚Ñùùëë1{\\mathbb{R}}^{d-1} as input, decompresses it to a zero-mean vector in ‚Ñùdsuperscript‚Ñùùëë{\\mathbb{R}}^{d}, and applies the RMSNorm on the decompressed vector.\nBuilding upon this new normalization, we propose Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer that employs lossless compression on the zero-mean vectors.\nWe apply such compression to zero-mean activations and parameters in Pre-RMSNorm Transformers, enhancing the efficiency of Pre-RMSNorm Transformers while preserving the equivalent arithmetic functionality. We formally claim that Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformers are equivalent for both training and inference.\nFigure 1 visualizes the overview of their equivalence.\nSuch equivalence directly enables more efficient training and deployment of Pre-LN Transformers.\nWe can translate a Pre-LN model into an equivalent Pre-(C)RMSNorm model, which can be readily deployed or adapted to downstream tasks.\nThe conversion process incurs minimal costs.\nWe can also train a Pre-(C)RMSNorm model directly as if we train an equivalent Pre-LN Transformer counterpart. Although our relative improvement in the training and inference efficiency seems not large (up to 10%percent1010\\% time reduction), we have the following arguments to support its significance.\n(1) Our proposed method can guarantee arithmetic equivalence and is a free lunch for Pre-LN Transformers.\nThe efficiency improvement originates from removing the inherent redundancy in Pre-LN Transformers without introducing any fine-tuning or calibration.\nOur work can strictly push the performance-efficiency Pareto frontier of Pre-LN Transformers.\n(2) The modest relative improvement can be translated into significant absolute improvement given that Pre-LN Transformers are foundation models for the current and future data-centric  and generative  artificial intelligence.\nFor instance, reducing the ChatGPT inference cost by 1%percent11\\% may save $7,000currency-dollar7000\\$7,000 per day 5.\n(3) Our method is orthogonal and complementary to most work improving efficiency, such as efficient Transformer variants , quantization 2 , and distillation to smaller models 4. We highlight our contributions as follows. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZixuanJiang/pre-rmsnorm-transformer. We achieve the first-ever unification of LayerNorm and RMSNorm in pre-normalization Transformers with proven arithmetic equivalence. We propose two variants: Pre-RMSNorm and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformers.\nThe original Pre-LN Transformer and our proposed two variants are equivalent and can seamlessly interchange without affecting functionality. Our proposed architectures are 1%‚àí10%percent1percent101\\%-10\\% more efficient than the original Pre-LN Transformer for both training and inference.\nSuch efficiency gains are effortlessly obtained without the need for fine-tuning or calibration.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Transformers have become a successful architecture for a wide range of machine learning applications, including natural language 9, computer vision 3, and reinforcement learning [ref]7.\nIt is one of the foundation models , and pretrained Transformers 9 demonstrated impressive generalization results.\nAmong the components of Transformers, normalization plays a critical role in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
