      "content": "Paper Title: Explainability in Process Outcome Prediction: Guidelines to Obtain Interpretable and Faithful Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBoth in operations research (OR) and business process management (BPM), prevalent topics include the modelling of processes in order to identify possible problems such as bottlenecks caused by a mismanagement or lack of resources  with the goal to find root causes in the process flow . Over the past two decades, the BPM domain has seen a strong uptake of data-driven process analysis, coined under the term process mining, which uses process data generated by executed processes for cases within an information system . This follows a similar trend in OR, where research shifted because of the access to large databases on (operational) transactions and a lack of back testing [ref]4. The focus of this study lies with predictive process monitoring , the umbrella term geared towards process mining for predictive activities. It allows identifying process-related trends regarding particular outcomes (e.g., will customers be awarded credit?), impeding bottlenecks (e.g., how long will it take to process my credit application?), and whether particular activities will occur in the future (e.g., will a credit check be necessary for this application?). When the concrete objective is to predict the outcome of an incoming, incomplete case, the field of study is referred to as Process Outcome Prediction (POP). The process data used in this research field is also referred to as event logs, as the occurrence of a single activity in a process (case) is referred to as ‘event’. Moreover, an event log consists of traces, each a sequence of events produced in the context of one case. In the situation of a loan application process, each event records the occurrence of an activity (with the activity label being the control flow attribute) up until the loan request is either accepted or rejected. Each activity can have complementary case attributes and event attributes such as the requested loan amount (case) and the current officer (event) respectively. These case attributes remain unchanged (i.e. static) within each case and hence in the whole trace, while the event attributes have varying values (i.e. dynamic) for every event. This means that an event possibly has three different attribute types: event, case, and control flow attributes.\nIn recent years, a wide array of traditional machine learning models have been used for process outcome prediction . An often anticipated trend is the introduction of computationally complex models in order to improve the predictive performance [ref]6. The use of such complex black box models comes at the cost of obfuscating their inner workings and therefore being unable to provide insights into why a certain business process prediction was made. The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) focuses on gaining insights into how and why certain predictions were made, while trying to maintain the predictive performance of these highly performant models . However, many XAI proponents state that trying to explain these black box models comes with a loss of faithfulness (or fidelity) due to the fact that the relationship between input and output is only an approximation   0. Nonetheless, the use of increasingly complex models has been widely adopted in high stake decision-making processes throughout society 1. This paper identifies and addresses two main issues that arise at the intersection of POP and XAI.\nFirst, the existing POP research is constrained to the predictive performance while neglecting the interpretation, actionability, and implications of the results. Many of the existing explainability metrics are either not model-agnostic (i.e. dependent on model parameters), not able to compare transparent versus black box models, or not adapted to a process-based analysis (i.e., do not take into account the different dimensions of process data).\nIn addition, recent literature pointed out that the post-hoc explainability techniques should uncover, apart from an interpretable explanation, the true reasons for model predictions. Hence, a more comprehensive study about the faithfulness and interpretability of XAI techniques in POP is missing, which impedes the selection of the most appropriate predictive algorithms and explainability models to achieve an interpretable outcome. We address this issue by introducing model-agnostic explainability metrics based on the properties interpretability and faithfulness, which are able to assess and compare transparent models versus black box models that require post-hoc model-agnostic (or model-dependent) explainability methods.\nThese metrics are not yet available in the field of XAI, and are analysed along the event, case, and control flow perspective, making them suitable for evaluation purposes in the field of POP. We perform a benchmarking study with five machine learning (ML) and two deep learning (DL) algorithms with different explainability approaches. In this sense, this paper is complementary with the study of  and [ref]6, as it compares the experimental set-up with both deep learning and newly-introduced interpretable models, i.e., the Logit Leaf Model (LLM) 2 and the Generalized Linear Rule Models (GLRM) 3.\nWe also provide generic, model-agnostic implementations for the XAI metrics which are also compatible with the latter models.\nHence, this study adds the XAI aspect and reconsiders what models excel in terms of predictive accuracy, interpretability, and faithfulness.\nSecond, the main focus of this field is to verify its conformance with respect to the business requirements and goals 4 5, but there remains a need for a set of guidelines towards obtaining faithful and interpretable explanations in the context of business process monitoring. We provide a framework to obtain accurate and eXplainable Methods for process Outcome Prediction (X-MOP). This framework of guidelines is based on the evaluation of a wide benchmark of preprocessing, traditional machine learning, deep learning and explainability approaches. This work extends the initial work of 6, focused on comparing inherently created explanations with post-hoc explanations in the context of POP. This paper is a considerable extension with new event logs, new algorithms and new XAI metrics. Next, we further adapt the original metrics along the control, case, and event perspective, which is typical for a process-based analysis. Finally, this papers has bundled the insights obtained from the wide benchmark into a framework of guidelines to obtain accurate and explainable models for POP. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, a review of the literature regarding explainability in predictive process monitoring is given in Section 2, together with the motivation for this line of research. This is followed by preliminaries defined in Section 3. Next, a definition for explainability is given, together with the introduced metrics in Section 4. The benchmark study and implementation details can be found in Section 5, after we clarify the research questions in Subsection 5.1. In Section 6, the insights obtained from the research questions are incorporated into the framework of guidelines named X-MOP. Finally, the results and obtained insights are concluded in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: for cases within an information system .
