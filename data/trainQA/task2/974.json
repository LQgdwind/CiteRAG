      "content": "Paper Title: Learning 3D Face Reconstruction with a Pose Guidance Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMonocular 3D face reconstruction with precise geometric details serves as a foundation to a myriad of computer vision and graphics applications, including face recognition  , digital avatars  [ref]4, face manipulation  , etc. However, this problem is extremely challenging due to its ill-posed nature, as well as difficulties to acquire accurate 3D face annotations. Most successful attempts to tackle this problem are built on parametric face models, which usually contain three sets of parameters: identity, expression, and pose. The most famous one is 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) [ref]7 and its variants    0. Recently, CNN-based methods that directly learn to regress the parameters of 3D face models 1 2 3 4, achieve state-of-the-art performance. Are these parameters well disentangled and can they be accurately regressed by CNNs?\nTo answer this question, we conduct a careful study on the AFLW2000-3D dataset 5.\nFig. 1(a) illustrates our setting. We first train a neural network that takes an RGB image as input to simultaneously regress the identity, expression and pose parameters. The Baseline 3DMM model is obtained by minimizing the 3D vertex error.\nThen, we independently replace the predicted identity, expression, and pose parameters with their corresponding ground truth parameters (denoted as GT Identity, GT Expression, and GT Pose), and recompute the 3D face reconstruction error shown in Fig. 1(b). Surprisingly, we found that GT Pose yields almost 5 times more performance gain than its two counterparts.\nThe improvement is even more significant when the face orientation degree increases. We posit that there are two reasons causing this result: (1)\nThese three sets of parameters are heavily correlated, and predicting a bad pose will dominate the identity and expression estimation of the 3D face model;\n(2) 3D face annotations are scarce especially for those with unusual poses. To address these issues, we propose a pose guidance network (PNG) to\nisolate the pose estimation from the original 3DMM parameters regression by estimating a UV position map 6 for 3D face landmark vertices.\nUtilizing the predicted 3D landmarks help to produce more accurate face poses compared to joint parameters regression (i.e., Baseline in Fig. 1), and the predicted 3D landmarks also contain valuable identity and expression information that further refines the estimation of identity and expression. Moreover, this enables us to learn from both accurate but limited 3D annotations, and unlimited in-the-wild images with pseudo 2D landmarks (from off-the-shelf landmark extractor like 7) to predict more accurate 3D landmarks. Consequently, with our proposed PGN, the performance degradation brought by inaccurate pose parameter regression is significantly mitigated as shown in Fig. 1(b). To further overcome the scarcity of 3D face annotations, we leverage the readily available in-the-wild videos by introducing a novel set of self-consistency loss functions to boost the performance. Given 3D face shapes in multiple frames of the same subject, we render a new image for each frame by replacing its texture with that of commonly visible vertices from other images. Then, by forcing the rendered image to be consistent with the original image in photometric space, optical flow space and semantic space, our network learns to avoid depth ambiguity and predicts better 3D shapes even without explicitly modeling albedo. We summarize our key contributions as follows: (1) We propose a PGN to solely predict the 3D landmarks for estimating the pose parameters based on a careful study (Fig. 1). The PGN effectively reduces the error compared to directly regressing the pose parameters and provides informative priors for 3D face reconstruction. (2) The PGN allows us to utilize both fully annotated 3D landmarks and pseudo 2D landmarks from unlabeled in-the-wild data. This leads to a more accurate landmark estimator and thus helping better 3D face reconstruction. (3) Built on a visible texture swapping module, our method explores multi-frame shape and texture consistency in a self-supervised manner, while carefully handling the occlusion and illumination change across frames. (4) Our method shows superior qualitative and quantitative results on ALFW-2000-3D 5, Florence 8 and FaceWarehouse 9 datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Monocular 3D face reconstruction with precise geometric details serves as a foundation to a myriad of computer vision and graphics applications, including face recognition  , digital avatars  [ref]4, face manipulation  , etc. However, this problem is extremely challenging due to its ill-posed nature, as well as difficulties to acquire accurate 3D face annotations.
