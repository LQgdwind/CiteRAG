      "content": "Paper Title: Topology Optimization of Multiscale Structures Considering Local and Global Buckling Response\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe multifield method by  is used in this work to generate the physical design field 𝝆msuperscript𝝆𝑚\\boldsymbol{\\rho}^{m}. It provides control over the minimum density of porous regions while also allowing fully void regions in the design. This is essential as both the buckling resistance and buckling stress limit goes to zero for ρ→0→𝜌0\\rho\\rightarrow 0. If nothing is done to deal with this issue the optimization will always require some amount of material in every elements to comply with the constraint. This essentially means that the method will not allow topology changes and is only useful for infill optimization of already known geometries. However, using the multifield method by  solves this issue as the stress limits are interpolated using the density field 𝒙~~𝒙\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{x}} while the stiffness interpolation is performed on the physical design field 𝝆msuperscript𝝆𝑚\\boldsymbol{\\rho}^{m}. The construction procedure for the physical design field 𝝆msuperscript𝝆𝑚\\boldsymbol{\\rho}^{m} is illustrated in Figure 3. It shows how the indicator field, 𝒔𝒔\\boldsymbol{s}, is filtered through ℱ​(𝒔)ℱ𝒔\\mathcal{F}(\\boldsymbol{s}) then projected using a Heaviside function ℋm​(𝒔~)subscriptℋ𝑚~𝒔\\mathcal{H}_{m}(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{s}}) at three different threshold levels. The density field is only filtered through ℱ​(𝒙)ℱ𝒙\\mathcal{F}(\\boldsymbol{x}). The product of these two fields form the physical design field 𝝆msuperscript𝝆𝑚\\boldsymbol{\\rho}^{m}. The purpose of the density filter is to eliminate numerical artifacts such as checker boarding and make the design mesh-independent .\nThe definition of the density filter is   where Nj,isubscript𝑁𝑗𝑖N_{j,i} is the set of neighborhood elements within the filter radii Rssubscript𝑅𝑠R_{s} and Rxsubscript𝑅𝑥R_{x} for the indicator field 𝒔𝒔\\boldsymbol{s} and density field 𝒙𝒙\\boldsymbol{x} respectively. In this work Rx=1.5​Δ​xsubscript𝑅𝑥1.5Δ𝑥R_{x}=1.5\\Delta x and Rs=4.5​Δ​xsubscript𝑅𝑠4.5Δ𝑥R_{s}=4.5\\Delta x is used throughout. The densities are weighted through w​(𝒏i)𝑤subscript𝒏𝑖w(\\boldsymbol{n}_{i}), where 𝒏isubscript𝒏𝑖\\boldsymbol{n}_{i} are the element center points, i.e. The smoothed Heaviside function ℋm​(𝒔~)subscriptℋ𝑚~𝒔\\mathcal{H}_{m}(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{s}}) (see  ) is defined as where ηmsubscript𝜂𝑚\\eta_{m} is the threshold value. In this work ηb=0.5subscript𝜂𝑏0.5\\eta_{b}=0.5 and the eroded and dilated values are determined by ηb±Δ​ηplus-or-minussubscript𝜂𝑏Δ𝜂\\eta_{b}\\pm\\Delta\\eta, where Δ​ηΔ𝜂\\Delta\\eta is specified explicitly for each of the numerical examples. The steepness of the projection is determined by β𝛽\\beta. When β𝛽\\beta increases the Heaviside function gets more and more non-linear. Therefore, a continuation method is used on β𝛽\\beta implying that it is initialized as β=2𝛽2\\beta=2 and slowly increased throughout the optimization process to βm​a​x=256subscript𝛽𝑚𝑎𝑥256\\beta_{max}=256 to ensure a clear representation of void regions. The specific continuation scheme used in this work is stated in Section 3. As discussed in the introduction, the stiffness of the considered triangular microstructure is very close to the theoretical optimum provided by the HS bounds. Therefore, instead of performing numerical homogenization to compute its properties, we may with just small errors use the stiffness propeties provided by the bounds. Hence, the HS upper bound is employed for elemental stiffness interpolation [ref]22, i.e., where μ​(ρjm)𝜇superscriptsubscript𝜌𝑗𝑚\\mu({\\rho}_{j}^{m}) and κ​(ρjm)𝜅superscriptsubscript𝜌𝑗𝑚\\kappa({\\rho}_{j}^{m}) are the effective shear and bulk moduli, respectively. The subscripts 00 and min\\min refer to the base material and void. The shear and bulk modulus for the base material are defined as μ0=E0/(2​(1+ν0))subscript𝜇0subscript𝐸021subscript𝜈0\\mu_{0}=E_{0}/(2(1+\\nu_{0})) and κ0=E0/(2​(1−ν0))subscript𝜅0subscript𝐸021subscript𝜈0\\kappa_{0}=E_{0}/(2(1-\\nu_{0})) and the stiffness of the void is determined similarly using Em​i​n=10−6​E0subscript𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑛superscript106subscript𝐸0E_{min}=10^{-6}E_{0}. The interpolation functions are used to build both the linear stiffness and stress stiffness matrices as Here 𝑲0,μjsubscriptsuperscript𝑲𝑗0𝜇\\boldsymbol{K}^{j}_{0,\\mu} and 𝑲0,κjsubscriptsuperscript𝑲𝑗0𝜅\\boldsymbol{K}^{j}_{0,\\kappa} are the finite elemental shear and bulk stiffness matrices for element j𝑗j with unit shear and bulk moduli. 𝑮0,μj​(𝒖j)subscriptsuperscript𝑮𝑗0𝜇subscript𝒖𝑗\\boldsymbol{G}^{j}_{0,\\mu}(\\boldsymbol{u}_{j}) and 𝑮0,κj​(𝒖j)subscriptsuperscript𝑮𝑗0𝜅subscript𝒖𝑗\\boldsymbol{G}^{j}_{0,\\kappa}(\\boldsymbol{u}_{j}) are the finite elemental base stress stiffness matrices for unit shear and bulk modulus respectively.  The definition of these matrices are based on the choice of finite element, hence they are not defined here for generality. For the 4-node quadrilateral elements used here we refer to the public Matlab code provided by . To avoid artificial buckling modes in the low stiffness regions, the stress stiffness matrix interpolation uses μmin=κmin=0subscript𝜇subscript𝜅0\\mu_{\\min}=\\kappa_{\\min}=0 (see [ref]17  ).\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: to compute its properties, we may with just small errors use the stiffness propeties provided by the bounds.
