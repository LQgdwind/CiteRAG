      "content": "Paper Title: Identification of Systematic Errors of Image Classifiers on Rare Subgroups\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe review related work in the computer vision domain while noting that identification of systematic errors and harmful behaviour is an important topic in other fields such as large language models as well (“red teaming”)  [ref]16. Building upon Subgroup Annotation.\nSeveral prior works have investigated performance on datasets where information on certain semantic dimensions is available for each datapoint and thus direct evaluation of subgroup error is feasible.\nFor instance, Hendrycks et al. [ref]22 collected four real-world datasets containing semantic dimensions like artistic renditions (ImageNet-R), country, year, and camera (StreetView StoreFronts), or object size, object occlusion, camera viewpoint, and camera zoom (DeepFashion Remixed). The influence of image background can be studied based on ImageNet-9  and Waterbirds 3. WildDash  allows studying the impact of different visual hazards. ImageNet-X  adds sixteen human annotations\nof semantic dimensions such as pose, background, or lighting to each ImageNet-1k validation sample. Such approaches require large efforts in data collection and subgroup annotation and have thus limited scalability and flexibility. Moreover, if there are several interacting semantic dimensions, then the number of datapoints required to achieve a full coverage of the design domain grows exponentially. One partial remedy to this combinatorial explosion is combinatorial t-wise testing   . Alternatively, synthetic corruptions can be applied to existing images resulting in a semantic corruption dimension (ImageNet-C) . However, not all semantic dimensions can be simulated. Failure Identification without Subgroup Annotation.\nSince explicit annotation of semantic dimension is costly, recent works have focused on automating the process of identifying systematic errors. One line of work resorts to a labeled hold-out set. Coherent groups of errors on the hold-out set can be identified by error-aware soft-clustering on the final feature space of the classifier . However, this does not provide an interpretation of the subgroup. Leveraging the text-image embedding alignment in CLIP 0, both  and  operated in the latent space of CLIP to identify semantically coherent subgroups and generate human interpretable subgroup annotation. The main disadvantage of these works is that they require the availability of a labeled hold-out set. Since systematic errors are more likely to occur on untypical/rare data , identifying them requires a hold-out dataset containing such cases, which is unrealistic.\nAdaVision  introduced a human-in-the-loop process to discover systematic errors by adaptively querying real images from LAION-5B 5 (via CLIP similarity). In contrast to AdaVision, our procedure does not require a human-in-the-loop, which can be preferred if model auditing needs to be done regularly or for a large number of models. The most similar line of work to ours is built on top of text-to-image synthesis models 1 2 4 . For instance, in   9, counterfactual examples are generated according to the input text, which indicates the semantic shift, e.g., background, lighting, or style. These works considered a single semantic shift, whereas systematic errors can result from compounding shifts in multiple semantic factors. Wiles et al.  did not pre-specify the semantic shift but iteratively synthesize samples based on a text description, cluster the failure cases, and refine the text description. In contrast to such an “open-ended” search, our work focuses on finding failures within an operational design domain and achieves high coverage of that domain (see Section 4.1). Moreover, our approach is conceptually more simple and does not require clustering and captioning of failure cases. Both approaches can be seen as complementary.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: in the computer vision domain while noting that identification of systematic errors and harmful behaviour is an important topic in other fields such as large language models as well (“red teaming”)  [ref]16.
