The main motivation behind the proposed formulation is the ability to yield matrices that are well-posed independently of the cut location. Some previous analyses on the robustness of AgFE methods are obtained for self-adjoint operators [ref]3. This is not the case for the time-dependent problems considered in this work. The resulting linear system matrix is nonsymmetric. However, one can consider a preconditioning technique to end up with a preconditioned symmetric linear system. We refer the reader to  for a preconditioning technique for DG time discretisations and fixed spatial domains. We are not aware of preconditioning techniques for time-varying domains. It is not the aim of this section to design effective preconditioner for this more general case. Instead, following , we prove that such preconditioner is effective in the time-constant domain for the unfitted formulation proposed in this work. The effectiveness of the preconditioner in  relies on the condition number of the following mass and stiffness matrices: for ​a,b∈𝒩h,i​nnfor 𝑎𝑏superscriptsubscript𝒩ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑛\\text{ for }a,b\\in\\mathcal{N}_{h,in}^{n}, the set of internal nodes in Jnsuperscript𝐽𝑛J^{n}.\nWe prove below that the condition numbers of these two matrices do not depend on the cut location. The condition number of the system matrices 𝐌𝐌\\boldsymbol{M} and 𝐀𝐀\\boldsymbol{A} in (30) associated with the AgFE space Vh,a​gnsubscriptsuperscript𝑉𝑛ℎ𝑎𝑔V^{n}_{h,ag} are bounded by C𝐶C and C​h−2𝐶superscriptℎ2Ch^{-2}, resp., for some positive constant C𝐶C. Let 𝒖𝒖\\boldsymbol{u} denote the nodal vectors of uhsubscript𝑢ℎu_{h}, which is constant in time.\nCombining the tensor product expression in (1) for the space-time extension operator and the continuity of the discrete extension operator for all time values in Jnsuperscript𝐽𝑛J^{n}(see, [3, Lemma 5.2.]), we get Using the coercivity of the spatial bilinear form for all t∈(0,T]𝑡0𝑇t\\in(0,T] in Prop. 4.1, (1), [3, Lemma 5.8.] and (31), we have Using (1) and [3, Cor. 5.9.], we get It proves the proposition.\n∎\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: formulation is the ability to yield matrices that are well-posed independently of the cut location.
