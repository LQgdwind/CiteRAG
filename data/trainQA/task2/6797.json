      "content": "Paper Title: PDPK: A Framework to Synthesise Process Data and Corresponding Procedural Knowledge for Manufacturing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo evaluate the link prediction performance, we rely on established evaluation metrics, i.‚Äâe. hits@k and adjusted (arithmetic) mean rank index (AMRI).\nhits@k, which describes the fraction of hits for which the entity appears under the first kùëòk entries of the sorted list , is defined for the set of individual rank scores ‚Ñê‚Ñê\\mathcal{I} as with a value of 1 indicating an optimal score, whereas 0 is worst.\nAMRI is better suited to compare different methods since it is not limited by kùëòk, taking the full sample into account.\nIt is defined as with ùíÆùíÆ\\mathcal{S} being the list of scores and rùëür the achieved rank.\nResults of AMRI range in [‚àí1,1]11[-1,1], where 0 indicates a performance similar to assigning random scores, 1 indicates optimal performance and values below 0 indicate worse than random performance .\nThe link prediction metrics are applied to the test set as described in Section¬†3.1.4. To evaluate whether the procedural knowledge contained in the graph is represented in the embeddings, we utilise a metric called matches@k, which is ‚Äòbased on the amount of overlap between the k closest quality characteristics in embedding and graph space‚Äô .\nIn graph space, the closest quality characteristics are determined by ranking them according to their overlap in adjusted parameters, whereas in embedding space the euclidean distance is used on the associated sub-graphs.\nThese are achieved in a sum-based manner (see ) by propagating from the quality node for a representation specific number of steps.\nAlso, one has the option whether to include, h‚Ñéh, the quality characteristic or not, h¬Ø¬Ø‚Ñé\\bar{h}.\nWe evaluate matches@k for k=3ùëò3k=3, which has been experimentally shown to be a good indicator for the FDM dataset.\nIts results range in [ref]0 1[ref]0 , where 111 indicates the best performance.\nIn the downstream scenario, generalisation of the learnt embeddings to previously unseen knowledge is not required as domain knowledge is unlikely to change.\nTherefore, matches@k is evaluated in-sample. For the link prediction setting, we investigate a set of well established knowledge graph embedding methods, namely TransE , ComplEx 7, ComplEx-LiteralE, DistMult-LiteralEgsubscriptDistMult-LiteralEg\\text{DistMult-LiteralE}_{\\text{g}} 8, DistMult , RotatE 5 and BoxE 6, which includes embedding methods of different complexity that could be able to capture indirections and other specific properties of the representations.\nAdditionally, we evaluate the downstream metric on RDF2Vec . We chose to train 46-dimensional embeddings, since this dimension allows its direct use in a downstream predictive scenario in our case.\nThe training was conducted using PyKEEN\n with an Adam optimizer with learning rate 4√ó10‚àí44E-44\\text{\\times}{10}^{-4} and weight decay 1√ó10‚àí51E-51\\text{\\times}{10}^{-5} for the link prediction methods and pyRDF2Vec\n for RDF2Vec as well as the default parametrisations of the embedding methods.\nThe number of epochs‚ÄîTransE: 400, ComplEx: 1000, ComplEx-LiteralE: 650, RotatE: 700, DistMult: 800, DistMult-LiteralEgsubscriptDistMult-LiteralEùëî\\text{DistMult-LiteralE}_{g}: 200, BoxE: 1500 and RDF2Vec: 1000‚Äîwas chosen individually for each embedding method by inspecting its convergence on the train set.\n30 runs were conducted to mitigate effects that could occur due to the random initialisation.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
