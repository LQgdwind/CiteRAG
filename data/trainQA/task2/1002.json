      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Theoretically Understanding Why Sgd Generalizes Better Than Adam in Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStochastic gradient descent (Sgd)   has become one of the most popular algorithms for training deep neural networks       . In spite of its simplicity and effectiveness, Sgd uses one learning rate for all gradient coordinates and could suffer from unsatisfactory convergence performance, especially for ill-conditioned problems . To avoid this issue, a variety of adaptive gradient algorithms have been developed that adjust learning rate for each gradient coordinate according to the current geometry curvature of the objective function    . These algorithms, especially for Adam, have achieved much faster convergence speed than vanilla Sgd in practice. Despite their faster convergence behaviors, these adaptive gradient algorithms usually suffer from worse generalization performance than Sgd   . Specifically, adaptive gradient algorithms often show faster progress in the training phase but their performance quickly reaches a plateaus on test data. Differently, Sgd usually improves model performance slowly but could achieve higher test performance.\nOne empirical explanation [ref]1  0 1 for this generalization gap is that adaptive gradient algorithms\ntend to converge to sharp minima whose local basin has large curvature and usually generalize poorly, while Sgd prefers to find flat minima\nand thus generalizes better.\nHowever, recent evidence  2 shows that (1) for deep neural networks, the minima at the asymmetric basins/valleys where both steep and flat directions exist also generalize well though they are sharp in terms of their local curvature, and (2) Sgd often converges to these minima. So the argument of the conventional “flat\" and “sharp\" minima defined on curvature cannot explain these new results. Thus the reason for the generalization gap between adaptive gradient methods and Sgd is still unclear. In this work, we provide a new viewpoint for understanding the generalization performance gap. We first formulate Adam and Sgd as Lévy-driven stochastic differential equations (SDEs), since the SDE of an algorithm shares similar convergence behaviors of the algorithm and can be analyzed more easily than directly analyzing the algorithm. Then we analyze the escaping behaviors of these SDEs at local minima to investigate the generalization gap between Adam and Sgd, as escaping behaviors determine which basin that an algorithm finally converges to and thus affect the generalization performance of the algorithm. By analysis, we find that compared with Adam, Sgd is more locally unstable and is more likely to converge to the minima at the flat or asymmetric basins/valleys which often have better generalization performance over other type minima. So our results can explain the better generalization performance of Sgd over Adam. Our contributions are highlighted below. Firstly, this work is the first one that adopts Lévy-driven SDE which better characterizes the algorithm gradient noise in practice, to analyze the adaptive gradient algorithms. Specifically, Fig. 1 shows that the gradient noise in Adam and Sgd, i.e. the difference between the full and stochastic gradients, has heavy tails and can be well characterized by systemic α𝛼\\alpha-stable (𝒮​α​𝒮𝒮𝛼𝒮\\mathcal{S}\\alpha\\mathcal{S}) distribution 4.\nBased on this observation, we view Adam and Sgd as discretization of the continuous-time processes and formulate the processes as Lévy-driven SDEs to analyze their behaviors. Compared with Gaussian gradient noise assumption in Sgd 5 6 7, 𝒮​α​𝒮𝒮𝛼𝒮\\mathcal{S}\\alpha\\mathcal{S} distribution assumption can characterize the heavy-tailed gradient noise in practice more accurately as shown in Fig. 1, and also better explains the different generalization performance of Sgd and Adam as discussed in Sec. 3.\nThis work extends 3 8 from Sgd on the over-simplified one-dimensional problems to much more complicated adaptive algorithms on high-dimensional problems. It also differs from 9, as 9 considers escaping behaviors of Sgd along several fixed directions, while this work analyzes the dynamic underlying structures in gradient noise that plays an important role in the local escaping behaviors of both Adam and Sgd. Next, we theoretically prove that for the Lévy-driven SDEs of Adam and Sgd, their escaping time ΓΓ\\Gamma from a local basin 𝛀𝛀\\bm{\\Omega}, namely the least time for escaping from the inner of 𝛀𝛀\\bm{\\Omega} to its outside, is at the order of 𝒪​(ε−α/m​(𝓦))𝒪superscript𝜀𝛼𝑚𝓦\\mathcal{O}({\\varepsilon^{-\\alpha}}\\!/m(\\bm{\\mathcal{W}})), where the constant ε∈(0,1)𝜀01{\\varepsilon}\\!\\in\\!(0,1) relies on the learning rate of algorithms and α𝛼\\alpha denotes the tail index of 𝒮​α​𝒮𝒮𝛼𝒮\\mathcal{S}\\alpha\\mathcal{S} distribution. Here m​(𝓦)𝑚𝓦m(\\bm{\\mathcal{W}}) is a non-zero Radon measure on the escaping set 𝓦𝓦\\bm{\\mathcal{W}} of Adam  and Sgd  at the local basin 𝛀𝛀\\bm{\\Omega} (see Sec. 4.1), and actually negatively relies on the Radon measure of 𝛀𝛀\\bm{\\Omega}. So both Adam and Sgd have small escaping time at the “sharp\" minima whose corresponding basins 𝛀𝛀\\bm{\\Omega} have small Radon measure. It means that Adam and Sgd are actually unstable at “sharp\" minima and would escape them to “flatter\" ones. Note, the Radon measure of 𝛀𝛀\\bm{\\Omega} positively depends on the volume of 𝛀𝛀\\bm{\\Omega}. So these results also well explain the observations in [ref]1  0 1 that the minima of deep networks found by Sgd often locate at the flat or asymmetric valleys, as their corresponding basins have large volumes and thus large Radon measure. Finally, our results can answer why Sgd often converges to flatter minima than Adam in terms of Radon measure, and thus explain the generalization gap between Adam and Sgd. Firstly, our analysis shows that even for the same basin 𝛀𝛀\\bm{\\Omega}, Adam often has smaller Radon measure m​(𝓦)𝑚𝓦m(\\bm{\\mathcal{W}}) on the escaping set 𝓦𝓦\\bm{\\mathcal{W}} at 𝛀𝛀\\bm{\\Omega} than Sgd, as the geometry adaptation in Adam via adaptively scaling each gradient coordinate well diminishes underlying anisotropic structure in gradient noise and leads to smaller m​(𝓦)𝑚𝓦m(\\bm{\\mathcal{W}}).\nSecondly, the empirical results in Sec. 5 and Fig. 1 show that Sgd often\nhas much smaller tail index α𝛼\\alpha of gradient noise than Adam for some optimization iterations and thus enjoys smaller factor ε−αsuperscript𝜀𝛼{\\varepsilon^{-\\alpha}}.\nThese results together show that Sgd is more locally unstable and would like to converge to flatter minima with larger measure m​(𝓦)𝑚𝓦m(\\bm{\\mathcal{W}}) which often refer to the minima at the flat and asymmetric basins/valleys, according with empirical evidences in  0 1 . Considering the observations in [ref]1  0 1 that the minima at the flat and asymmetric basins/valleys often generalize better, our results well explain the generalization gap between Adam and Sgd. Besides, our results also show that Sgd benefits from its anisotropic gradient noise on its escaping behaviors, while Adam does not.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: phase but their performance quickly reaches a plateaus on test data.
