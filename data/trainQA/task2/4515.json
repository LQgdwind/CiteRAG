      "content": "Paper Title: RadSegNet: A Reliable Approach to Radar Camera Fusion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCurrent radar and camera fusion approaches can be classified into one of the following categories: projection based (perspective projection or inverse projection or radar-based region proposals), multi-view feature aggregation, and uncertainty based fusion. A common way to do camera-radar fusion is to project radar 3D points to camera 2D perspective view using camera matrices. Felix et al.  [ref]26 project the radar point on the camera plane and augment them into vertical lines and pillars respectively to encode height. Chang et al.  use a spatial attention network to process projected radar image. Grimm et al. [ref]13 use a differentiable warping function to warp radar tensor to camera image for using camera labels for training. However, operating in perspective view makes it harder to distinguish between small objects close to the sensor and large objects at a longer range, hence achieving sub-optimal performance. Another way to fuse data is by projecting camera to radar’s bird’s eye view. Lim et al. [ref]21 use planar homography transformation to project camera image to radar BEV. However, an inverse mapping of camera to BEV plane is ill-defined due to the lack of depth information in camera images causing ambiguities in detection. This class of methods tend to use radars for generating region proposals for performing object detection. Nabati et al.  use radars to generate 2D proposals for object detectors like Faster-RCNN that improve the performance for autonomous driving cases. The authors further extends the approach to 3D proposals and utilizes both radar and camera features to refine the proposals and detection . These methods also operate in perspective view which makes the detection task harder. Kowol et al.  use radar detections to generate an uncertainty measure. This measure is used to prune the 2D predictions generated by standard object detectors like Faster RCNN to improve their performance. However, they only use radar to assist camera, thereby not utilising its complete advantages. Kim et al.  use an AVOD  type architecture where a set of proposals are projected independently to camera and radar plane to extract features. Object proposal wise features are fused together to obtain final predictions. These approaches yield SOTA results for camera-radar fusion but the performance is not reliable in adverse conditions. RadSegNet uses the SPG representation, which combines the benefits of BEV with camera information in a reliable way. This allows RadSegNet to achieve more accurate results along with reliablity in all conditions.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: multi-view feature aggregation, and uncertainty based fusion.
