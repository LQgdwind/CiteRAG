      "content": "Paper Title: Boosting ship detection in SAR images with complementary pretraining techniques\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe select two representative methods: Faster R-CNN¬†[ref]7 and YOLOv3¬†[ref]36, as the benchmarks in our work. Here we only introduce the critical architecture of these two detection benchmarks, and we refer to their original paper¬†[ref]7 [ref]36 to see a more detailed introduction. It is noted that our OSD pretraining technique, OSM pretraining technique and the WBF strategy¬† can be easily applied to other state-of-the-art object detection benchmarks. Faster R-CNN¬†[ref]7, as the behalf of the two-stage object detection methods, consists of three modules: feature embedding network as the backbone to extract high-level features from the original images, region proposal network (RPN) generating the ship proposals for preliminarily predicting the location of ships and box regression network such as Fast R-CNN¬† finishing the binary classification and bounding box regression. We adopt ResNet50¬†[ref]13 as the backbone for better feature extraction. Besides, to handle the detection of multi-scale ships in multi-resolution SAR images, we use the feature pyramid network (FPN)¬† to combine low-resolution, semantically strong features with high-resolution, semantically weak features. We initially set 3 anchor boxes with one scale of size 8 and three aspect ratios of size {0.5,1,2.0}0.512.0\\left\\{0.5,1,2.0\\right\\} at each spatial location of each feature map. After RPN generates ship proposals, we adopt the RoIAlign¬† operation to fix the misalignment of feature maps caused by coarse spatial quantization. Furthermore, we select the cross entropy and s‚Äãm‚Äão‚Äão‚Äãt‚Äãhùë†ùëöùëúùëúùë°‚Ñésmooth L1 loss function to optimize the classification and regression task, respectively. YOLOv3¬†[ref]36 is a representative one-stage object detection method comprising two modules: feature extraction network and box detection network. The feature extraction network is set as Darknet53¬†[ref]36 containing 53 convolutional layers and some shortcut connections as used in ResNet¬†[ref]13, making YOLOv3 more powerful and efficient. As similarly used in Faster R-CNN, FPN is adopted in the feature extraction network to enhance multi-scale object detection capabilities. The box detection network predicts bounding boxes on three different scales following the feature extraction network. Feature maps with small sizes are used to detect large-size ships, while feature maps with large sizes are utilized to detect small-size ships. The predefined anchor boxes in Faster R-CNN are leveraged because learning the offsets between anchor boxes and the predictions will make the network easier to train. Considering this convenience, YOLOv3 also presets 9 anchors with 3 different sizes on each scale to predict bounding boxes more accurately. The anchor sizes are set according to the dataset and we use the same initial anchor sizes as¬†[ref]36. Moreover, instead of fixing the input image size, we use the multi-scale training strategy to resize the input image into one size of\n{320√ó320,416√ó416}320320416416\\left\\{320\\times 320,416\\times 416\\right\\} randomly in each iteration, forcing the network to perform prediction well across different resolutions. Cross entropy and mean square error loss functions are utilized to optimize this network end-to-end.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: We select two representative methods: Faster R-CNN¬†[ref]7 and YOLOv3¬†[ref]36, as the benchmarks in our work.
