      "content": "Paper Title: Neural-Swarm2: Planning and Control of Heterogeneous Multirotor Swarms using Learned Interactions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe ongoing commoditization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires robots to fly in much closer proximity to each other than before, which necessitates advanced planning and control methods for large aerial swarms  .\nFor example, consider a search-and-rescue mission where an aerial swarm must enter and search a collapsed building.\nIn such scenarios, close-proximity flight enables the swarm to navigate the building much faster compared to swarms that must maintain large distances from each other.\nOther important applications of close-proximity flight include manipulation, search, surveillance, and mapping.\nIn many scenarios, heterogeneous teams with robots of different sizes and sensing or manipulation capabilities are beneficial due to their significantly higher adaptability. For example, in a search-and-rescue mission, larger UAVs can be used for manipulation tasks or to transport goods, while smaller ones are more suited for exploration and navigation. A major challenge of close-proximity control and planning is that small distances between UAVs create complex aerodynamic interactions.\nFor instance, one multirotor flying above another causes the so-called downwash effect on the lower one, which is difficult to model using conventional model-based approaches .\nWithout accurate downwash interaction modeling, a large safety distance between vehicles is necessary, thereby preventing a compact 3-D formation shape, e.g., 60 cmtimes60cm60\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{c}\\mathrm{m} for the small Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor (9 cmtimes9cm9\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{c}\\mathrm{m} rotor-to-rotor) [ref]4. Moreover, the downwash is sometimes avoided by restricting the relative position between robots in the 2-D horizontal plane .\nFor heterogeneous teams, even larger and asymmetric safety distances are required .\nHowever, the downwash for two small Crazyflie quadrotors hovering 30 cmtimes30cm30\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{c}\\mathrm{m} on top of each other is only 9 gtimes9g9\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{g}, which is well within their thrust capabilities, and suggests that proper modeling of downwash and other interaction effects can lead to more precise motion planning and dense formation control. In this paper, we present a learning-based approach, Neural-Swarm2, which enhances the precision, safety, and density of close-proximity motion planning and control of heterogeneous multirotor swarms.\nIn the example shown in Fig. 1, we safely operate the same drones with vertical distances less than half of those of prior work [ref]4.\nIn particular, we train deep neural networks (DNNs) to predict the residual interaction forces that are not captured by the nominal models of free-space aerodynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model for aerodynamic interactions between two or more multirotors in flight.\nOur DNN architecture supports heterogeneous inputs in a permutation-invariant manner without reducing the expressiveness.\nThe DNN only requires relative positions and velocities of neighboring multirotors as inputs, similar to the existing collision-avoidance techniques [ref]7, which enables fully-decentralized computation.\nWe use the predicted interaction forces to augment the nominal dynamics and derive novel methods to directly consider them during motion planning and as part of the multirotors’ controller. From a learning perspective, we leverage and extend two state-of-the-art tools to derive effective DNN models.\nFirst, we extend deep sets [ref]8 to the heterogeneous case and prove its representation power.\nOur novel encoding is used to model interactions between heterogeneous vehicle types in an index-free or permutation-invariant manner, enabling better generalization to new formations and a varying number of vehicles.\nThe second is spectral normalization , which ensures the DNN is Lipschitz continuous and helps the DNN generalize well on test examples that lie outside the training set.\nWe demonstrate that the interaction forces can be computationally efficiently and accurately learned such that a small 32-bit microcontroller can predict such forces in real-time. From a planning and control perspective, we derive novel methods that directly consider the predicted interaction forces.\nFor motion planning, we use a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we extend an existing kinodynamic sampling-based planner for a single robot to the interaction-aware multi-robot case.\nIn the second stage, we adopt an optimization-based planner to refine the solutions of the first stage.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate that our interaction-aware motion planner both avoids dangerous robot configurations that would saturate the multirotors’ motors and reduces the tracking error significantly.\nFor the nonlinear control we leverage the Lipschitz continuity of our learned interaction forces to derive stability guarantees similar to our prior work 0 1.\nThe controller can be used to reduce the tracking error of arbitrary desired trajectories, including ones that were not planned with an interaction-aware planner. We validate our approach using two to sixteen quadrotors of two different sizes, and we also integrate ground effect and other unmodeled dynamics into our model, by viewing the physical environment as a special robot.\nTo our knowledge, our approach is the first that models interactions between two or more multirotor vehicles and demonstrates how to use such a model effectively and efficiently for motion planning and control of aerial teams.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: preventing a compact 3-D formation shape, e.g., 60 cmtimes60cm60\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{c}\\mathrm{m} for the small Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor (9 cmtimes9cm9\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{c}\\mathrm{m} rotor-to-rotor) [ref]4.
