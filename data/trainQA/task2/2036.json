      "content": "Paper Title: Detecting Backdoor in Deep Neural Networks via Intentional Adversarial Perturbations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo date, some defense methods have been proposed to detect and mitigate the backdoor attacks.\nLiu et al.  adopted a pre-trained auto-encoder to preprocess the input image in order to disable the trigger.\nThey also retrain the backdoored model with clean images so as to remove the hidden backdoor.\nXu et al. [ref]5 generates a set of backdoor instances as the query set.\nThen, they inputs the query set into backdoored models and clean models to extract representation vectors from those models.\nThey use the resulting vectors as input to train a meta-classifier which can predict whether a model is backdoored [ref]5.\nHowever, the method needs the knowledge of the trigger size to craft those backdoor instances.\nLiu et al. [ref]16 demonstrated that the functionality of the backdoor depends on some specific neurons in the model.\nThese specific neurons are usually dormant when the model is queried with clean images [ref]16.\nDefenders can find these neurons by inputting clean images into the model.\nThen these malicious neurons can be pruned so as to remove the backdoor.\nHowever, the pruned model suffers from the degradation in classification accuracy on clean inputs due to the pruning [ref]16.\nZhang et al.  training a large number of backdoored models and clean models to generate corresponding universal perturbations .\nThen they use the UAPs  as the input to train a two-class classifier as the Trojan detector.\nHowever, the computational cost to generate those large number of backdoored models and clean models is high, which is unaffordable to most users.\nChen et al.  analyze the neuron activations to the training data to determine whether it has backdoor instances.\nIt separates the activations of all training data into two clusters by applying 2-means clustering.\nThe high silhouette score means that this cluster corresponds to the backdoor instances .\nGao et al. [ref]12 add a set of other images from different classes to the input image separately so as to generate a set of blended images.\nThen, the entropy of the predicted results on these blended images is calculated.\nThe lower the entropy, the input image is more likely to carry a trigger [ref]12.\nHowever, the trigger in the blended image may be destroyed. As a result, the backdoor instance will be incorrectly considered to be a clean one by STRIP.\nWang et al.  proposed a defense method named Neural Cleanse (NC) to reverse engineer the trigger from the backoored model.\nFor each class, NC computes the minimized amount of modification to make the model predict images from different classes as this class.\nAmong these modifications, if a modification is substantially smaller than the others, NC will consider it as a trigger .\nHowever, this method is computationally expensive considering the reverse-engineering process, especially when the model has a large number of output classes.\nMoreover, the reversed trigger is just similar to the true trigger.\nIn addition, when the true trigger is big or discrete, the reversed trigger even will not be similar to the true trigger.\nQiao et al.  proposed a max-entropy staircase approximator (MESA) algorithm to reverse a set of candidate triggers.\nThen, backdoor instances are generated by separately adding these candidate triggers to clean images.\nThe model is fine-tuned on these backdoor instances with correct labels to remove the backdoor .\nHowever, the MESA algorithm requires the information of the trigger size, which is difficult to obtain by the defender in realistic scenarios.\nChen et al.  proposed a GAN-based defense method called DeepInspect.\nDeepInspect reconstructs the potential trigger and generates the backdoor instances by patching these reconstructed trigger to the clean images with ground truth labels.\nThen, the backdoored model is fine-tuned on these generated backdoor instances to remove the backdoor . The main advantages of the proposed approach over the existing defenses are summarized as follows. Compared with [ref]5 , which both need to know the trigger size, the proposed method does not require any backdoor attack information.\nMoreover, Liu et al.  requires a large number of trusted images to remove the backdoor (10,000 ∼similar-to\\sim 60,000 images for MNIST).\nIn comparison, the proposed method only requires a small set of clean images (300 clean images) to generate the universal adversarial perturbation. The detection process of the work  requires training a large number of shadow models (backdoored models and clean models).\nNevertheless, the computational resources for training such a large number of shadow models are unaffordable for most of the users.\nIn contrast, the proposed method only needs to generate one single universal perturbation and only needs the model to make predictions on the unperturbed image and the perturbed image, which requires low computational overhead. STRIP [ref]12 directly superimposes a number of images from different classes to the input image.\nThis will not only destroy the main content of the input image, but may also accidentally break the trigger.\nOnce the trigger is destroyed, the entropy of this backdoor instance will be similar to the entropy of a clean image.\nHence STRIP [ref]12 will fail to detect this backdoor instance.\nIn contrast, the proposed method perturbs the untrusted image with universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) .\nThis will not destroy the trigger and ensures that the predicted label of the backdoor instance keeps unchanged even after perturbation.\nMoreover, for each input image, STRIP [ref]12 needs to predict a set of blended images in order to estimate the entropy of the predicted labels of those blended images.\nIn comparison, for each image, the proposed method only needs to predict two images (the perturbed image and the unperturbed image).\nTherefore, the backdoor detection efficiency of the proposed method is higher than that of STRIP.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: a pre-trained auto-encoder to preprocess the input image in order to disable the trigger.\nThey also retrain the backdoored model with clean images so as to remove the hidden backdoor.\nXu et al. [ref]5 generates a set of backdoor instances as the query set.\nThen, they inputs the query set into backdoored models and clean models to extract representation vectors from those models.\nThey use\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
