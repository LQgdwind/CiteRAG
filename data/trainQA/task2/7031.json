      "content": "Paper Title: AR-TTA: A Simple Method for Real-World Continual Test-Time Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate the methods on four image classification tasks: CIFAR10-to-CIFAR10C, ImageNet-to-ImageNet-C, CLAD-C continual learning benchmark [ref]36 adapted to the test-time adaptation setting, and the benchmark created from the SHIFT dataset [ref]34. CIFAR10-to-CIFAR10C and ImageNet-to-ImageNet-C are widely used tasks in TTA. They involve training the source model on train split of clean CIFAR10/ImageNet datasets   and test-time adaptation on CIFAR10C/ImageNet-C. CIFAR10C and ImageNet-C consist of images from clean datasets which were modified by 15 types of corruptions with 5 levels of severity. They were first used for evaluating the robustness of neural network models and are now widely utilized for testing the adaptation capabilities of TTA methods. We test the adaptation on a standard sequence of the highest corruption severity level 5, frequently utilized by previous approaches [ref]39  . For ImageNet-C we utilize a subset of 5000 samples for each corruption, based on RobustBench library , following [ref]39.\n CLAD-C [ref]36 is an online classification benchmark for autonomous driving with the goal to introduce a more realistic testing bed for continual learning. Even though, to the best of our knowledge, it has not yet been used for testing TTA before, we chose this benchmark inspired by its realistic nature and the goal to simulate more real-world application setup. It consists of natural, temporal correlated, and continuous distribution shifts created by utilizing the data from SODA10M dataset . The images taken at different locations, times of day, and weathers, are chronologically ordered, inducing distribution shifts in labels and domains. The classification task was created by cutting out the annotated 2D bounding boxes of six classes and using them as separate images for classification. Since it is designed for testing the continual learning setup and the model is originally supposed to be trained sequentially on the train sequences, we slightly modify the setup and pre-train the source model on the first train sequence. TTA is continually tested on the 5 remaining ones with the total number of 17092 images. The SHIFT dataset is a synthetic autonomous driving dataset designed for continuous multi-task domain adaptation. It provides multiple types of data from the perspective of a car, including RGB images with various types of annotations. Images are taken in numerous types of realistic domains simulated in a virtual environment, including different weather and times of day. This dataset is not designed for a classification task. However, satisfied with the amount of data and the realism of the dataset, we decided to create the classification setup, using the same procedure as for the CLAD-C dataset, utilizing the 2D bounding box annotations. We train the source model on images taken at clean weather during the day and test the adaptation methods for various weather combinations and times of day. We end up with 14 different domains resulting in total of 380667 images. The high number of test samples provides a good simulation of what could happen during model deployment in a real world, ever-changing environment. We called our original continual test-time adaptation benchmark on SHIFT dataset SHIFT-C.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: We evaluate the methods on four image classification tasks: CIFAR10-to-CIFAR10C, ImageNet-to-ImageNet-C, CLAD-C continual learning benchmark [ref]36 adapted to the test-time adaptation setting, and the benchmark created from the SHIFT dataset [ref]34.
