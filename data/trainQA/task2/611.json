      "content": "Paper Title: Data-Efficient Ranking Distillation for Image Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInstance level image retrieval have dramatically improved with the advent of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  [ref]30 [ref]12 . The improvement in performance is particularly driven by deeper networks such as VGG , ResNet  family of networks. However, with the increased accuracy also comes higher inference time and computational burden at test time. There are two main ideas that have been proposed to address this challenge. One is to quantize(and/or prune) the trained bigger network to a lighter version with reduced precision and weights but with the same depth . The other direction is to transfer knowledge from the bigger network (teacher model) to a different but much smaller and lighter network (student model). In this paper, we focus on the second direction, popularly known as Knowledge Distillation (KD), although it can be applied to the former case as well. The idea of using information from a teacher model(s) to train a student model was first proposed by Caruana , and, was later improved upon by Hinton . Instead of providing a one hot vector as target or ground-truth class label, KD aims to distill additional information from the teacher to the student model. Such additional knowledge is usually constituted by the output at various layers of the teacher model, e.g. logits from the layer before the softmax in the teacher constitute softer targets for the student. Traditionally proposed for classification problem, KD was later extended to the metric learning scenario   . However, the knowledge being distilled was addressed differently as traditional KD methods did not perform well in this setting   . While  proposed to distill the teacher ranking,  proposed to distill the teacher distance for a given query-database sample(s). In both cases, the student model tries to learn the relation (rank/distance) between query-database samples instead of learning the exact input-output mapping. This allows the student network to maintain its own output dimensionality. We refer to these methods as Metric Knowledge Distillation (MKD) methods. In this paper we address MKD from the perspective of data-efficiency. While existing distillation approaches    have addressed test time efficiency by compressing the knowledge from cumbersome models onto compact ones, they have failed to address training time efficiency. We address this issue by defining the training time efficiency as i) the number of queries to the teacher model to obtain teacher knowledge (pseudo ground-truth) in the form of final output representation or logits, and ii) the number of training samples required to distill the teacher knowledge onto the student model. In this paper we propose an MKD method under the above mentioned budget constraints while operating under the setting of black-box teacher models, preserving student-teacher dimensionality and achieving comparable performance to the no-budget scenario. Large scale datasets are costly in terms of memory (storage), computation (training) and economic (data accumulation/labelling). In addition private data such as trained teacher models or full training dataset can have limited or partial access due to privacy concerns. Our proposed method reduces the dependency on large scale datasets for learning new models while being efficient also during training. The key ingredient in our proposed method is the idea of mixup   . Using mixup, one can augment a small original training set with large number of additional samples by convex combination of the training samples. Such idea has been recently used in [ref]43 to address data-efficient knowledge distillation using mixup based data augmentations. While the existing mixup based methods have addressed classification problems, we extend the idea to the problem of metric learning. In contrast to    [ref]43, we perform mixup at the global image representation level. That is, each image is represented by a global representation vector obtained by spatial encoding of 2D representation maps from a CNN. Thereafter, augmented representations are obtained by linearly interpolating between representations from original samples. We then perform distillation between teacher and student models in the joint space of original and augmented global representations. In particular we train the student model to mimic the teacher ranking for each sample in the joint representation space of respective models using the recently proposed ranking loss  . Representation level mixup requires orders of magnitude less queries to the teacher model compared to mixup at the input image level [ref]43. In the process our proposed method still achieves comparable performance to fully supervised models trained on the full training dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Instance level image retrieval have dramatically improved with the advent of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  [ref]30 [ref]12 .
