      "content": "Paper Title: A Divide-and-Conquer Approach to the Summarization of Long Documents\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSummarization is closely related to data compression and information understanding, both of which are key to information science and retrieval. Being able to produce informative and well-written document summaries has the potential to greatly improve the success of both information discovery systems and human readers that are trying to quickly skim large numbers of documents for important information. Indeed, automatic summarization has been recently recognized as one of the most important natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet one of the least solved ones . This work is concerned with the neural summarization of long documents, such as academic articles and financial reports. In previous years, neural summarization approaches have mainly focused on short pieces of text that typically come from news articles   [ref]4     . This is also reflected in the amount of datasets that exist for this particular problem 0 1 2 3. Summarizing long documents is a very different problem to newswire summarization. In academic articles for example, the input text can range from 2,000 to 7,000 words, while in the case of newswire articles it rarely exceeds 700 words 4. Similarly, the expected summary of a news article is less than 100 words long, while the abstract of an academic article can easily exceed 200 words. The increased input and output length lead neural summarization methods to a much higher computational complexity, making it extremely hard to train models that have enough capacity to perform this task. This is more prominent with abstractive summarization models where the complexity of text generation becomes prohibitive for very long sequences. Most importantly, long documents introduce a lot of noise to the summarization process. Indeed, one of the major difficulties in summarizing a long document is that large parts of the document are not really key to its narrative and thus should be ignored. Finally, long summaries typically contain a number of diverse key information points from a document, which are more difficult to produce, compared to the more focused information contained in short summaries. Certain methods have tried to address these problems by limiting the size of the input document, either by selecting specific sections that are more informative 5, or by first employing a more efficient extractive model that learns to identify and select the most important parts of the input 6 7. While this reduces the noise and the computational cost in processing a long document, there remain the computational cost and information diversity issues in producing a long summary. In the context of Transformer models with self-attention, sparse attention mechanisms such as Big Bird 8 manage to increase the input length by a large amount but they still cannot scale to very long summaries. In contrast to the above methods that aim to produce a complete summary at once, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer approach that first breaks both the document and its target summary into multiple smaller source-target pairs, then trains a neural model that learns to summarize these smaller document parts, and finally during inference aggregates the partial summaries in order to produce a final complete summary.\nBy decomposing the problem of long document summarization into smaller summarization problems, our approach reduces the computational complexity of the summarization task. At the same time, our approach increases the number and, more importantly, the quality of the training examples by having source and target summary pairs that are focused on a specific aspect of the text, which results in better alignment between them and less noise. This leads to a decomposition of the summarization problem into simpler summarization problems that are easier to learn.\nEmpirical results on two publicly available datasets of academic articles, show that our approach can enhance the ability of summarization models and lead to overall improved results. We show that using a 3 years-old sequence-to-sequence model [ref]4, our approach manages to achieve surprisingly good results, surpassing recent more advanced models 4 5. In addition, when paired with a very strong Transformer model such as PEGASUS 9 our method produces results that are on par with the state-of-the-art on both datasets. This paper is based on past work 0 that assumed the existence of structured summaries, such as those available for some of the biomedical articles indexed in PubMed. Here we lift this assumption by using sentence level Rouge similarities in order to match sentences of the summary with parts of the document and automatically create source-target pairs for training. This is a key advancement, since the vast majority of academic documents are not accompanied by structured abstracts. Also, such an approach makes this work applicable to any type of document, from academic articles to blog posts and financial documents. Ultimately, our proposed method allows advanced summarization methods to be used in a number of different applications that previously might have been infeasible. The rest of this work is structured as follows. Section 2 gives a brief overview of the related work. Section 3 describes in detail the proposed method. Section 4 presents the experimental setup and Section 5 discusses the results of our experiments. Finally, Section 6 concludes this works and points to future work directions.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: documents, such as academic articles and financial reports.
