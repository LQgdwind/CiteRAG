Given a starting point z0∈domhsubscript𝑧0domℎz_{0}\\in\\operatorname*{dom}h and\na tolerance ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, it is shown that PF.APD has the following\nnice properties: for any m^>0^𝑚0\\hat{m}>0, it always obtains a pair (z¯,v¯)∈domh×ℝn¯𝑧¯𝑣domℎsuperscriptℝ𝑛(\\bar{z},\\bar{v})\\in\\operatorname*{dom}h\\times\\mathbb{R}^{n}\nsatisfying (1.3); if f𝑓f is nonconvex, then it stops in 𝒪~​(m​M​Δ0/ε2)~𝒪𝑚𝑀subscriptΔ0superscript𝜀2\\tilde{{\\cal O}}(\\sqrt{mM\\Delta_{0}}/\\varepsilon^{2})\nresolvent evaluations111The notation O~​(⋅)~𝑂⋅\\tilde{O}(\\cdot) ignores any terms that logarithmically\ndepend on the tolerance ε𝜀\\varepsilon.; if f𝑓f is convex, then it stops in 𝒪~​(M​min⁡{Δ0/ε,d0/ε})~𝒪𝑀subscriptΔ0𝜀subscript𝑑0𝜀\\tilde{{\\cal O}}(\\sqrt{M}\\min\\{\\sqrt{\\Delta_{0}}/\\varepsilon,d_{0}/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}\\})\nresolvent evaluations; Both of the above complexity bounds are optimal (up to logarithmic\nterms in) in terms of Δ0subscriptΔ0\\Delta_{0}, M𝑀M, m𝑚m, and ε𝜀\\varepsilon\n(although suboptimal by a factor of d0subscript𝑑0\\sqrt{d_{0}} in the convex\ncase). Moreover, it appears to be the first time that a type-II\nparameter-free method has obtained such bounds222Compare this to the complexity-optimal methods in \nand  which require knowledge of d0subscript𝑑0d_{0}\nand (m,M)𝑚𝑀(m,M), respectively.. Improved iteration complexity bounds are also obtained when d0subscript𝑑0d_{0}\nis known. Also, all of the above results are obtained under the mild\nassumption that the optimal value in (1.1) is finite\nand does not assume the boundedness of domhdomℎ\\operatorname*{dom}h (cf.  )\nnor that an optimal solution of (1.1) exists. For convenience, we compare in Table 1 the\nbest iteration complexity bounds of some of the parameter-free methods\nlisted in the previous subsection with two instances of PF.APD. For\nshorthands, PGD is the adaptive proximal gradient descent method in\n, UPF is the UPFAG method in [ref]13,\nANCF is the ADAP-NC-FISTA method in , VRF is\nthe VAR-FISTA method in , and APD is as in Algorithm 5\nin this paper with m0=1subscript𝑚01m_{0}=1. Notice that the analysis for UPFAG does not include an iteration complexity\nbound for finding stationary points when f𝑓f is convex, while ANCF\nand VRF suffer from the requirement that domhdomℎ\\operatorname*{dom}h must be bounded.\nMoreover, up until this point, PGD was the only parameter-free type-II\nalgorithm with an established iteration complexity bound for the unbounded\ncase when f𝑓f is convex. None of the parameter-free methods before\nthis work, in the nonconvex setting, could obtain the optimal complexity\nbound in . In addition to the development of PF.APD, some details are given regarding\nhow PF.APD could be used in other existing optimization frameworks,\nincluding min-max smoothing and penalty frameworks for constrained\noptimization. The main advantages of these resulting frameworks are\nthat (i) they are parameter-free and (ii) they have improved complexities\nwhen f𝑓f in (1.1) is convex, without requiring any\nadjustments to their inputs. Finally, numerical experiments are given to support the practical\nefficiency of PF.ADP on some randomly generated problem instances.\nThese experiments specifically show that PF.APD consistently outperforms\nseveral existing parameter-free methods in practice.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: of the parameter-free methods\nlisted in the previous subsection with two instances of PF.APD.
