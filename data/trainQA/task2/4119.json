      "content": "Paper Title: A Semantic Consistency Feature Alignment Object Detection Model Based on Mixed-Class Distribution Metrics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBy virtue of large-scale of datasets like ImageNet , Open Image , and MS COCO , Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) have promoted object detection task to achieve remarkable progress. Object detection task requires a strong understanding for a specific scene including texture, brightness, viewing angle etc. This strong demand is difficult to be satisfied when applying a detector to different scenarios, causing performance degradation. This phenomenon is the notorious domain shift or dataset bias issues. While collecting and annotating data for related scenarios is capable of tackling this issue, it suffers enormous resources to achieve the expected results. To eliminates this barrier, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation approach (UDA) is tailored to address this problem without extra annotated data, which aims at adaptively conveying knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. Several advanced methods [ref]4 [ref]5 [ref]6  employ the domain classifier to distinguish the discrimination and synergistically train a feature extractor by using the Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), which aims at learning a consistent representation for target domain. These methods are based on the literature in , which aims to estimate the H−d​i​v​e​r​g​e​n​c​e𝐻𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒H-divergence  between the source domain and target domain. We point out that these works [ref]4 [ref]5 [ref]6  only focus on the H−d​i​v​e​r​g​e​n​c​e𝐻𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒H-divergence measures for a single class on object detection task. However, object detection task is often required to locate and classify multiple categories of objects that may block each other, which is different from the classification task, as shown in Figure 1. Due to this dilemma, the current methods [ref]4 [ref]5 [ref]6  are hard to transfer precise clue from source domain to target domain. In other word, the mixed semantic features are difficult to decoupled, causing to learn confusing information and failing to achieve the oracle performance. To address the multi-classes H−d​i​v​e​r​g​e​n​c​e𝐻𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒H-divergence dilemma, we act the feature containing multiple categories as a new mixed category. As shown in Figure 2, given the original categories A and B which appears in the input image (or feature map), we add a new category named AB. Afterwards, we provide a Mixed-Classes H−d​i​v​e​r​g​e​n​c​e𝐻𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒H-divergence (M​C​H−d​i​v​e​r​g​e​n​c​e𝑀𝐶𝐻𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒MCH-divergence) with the mixed classes to obtain a more accurate feature distribution. We also propose a semantic prediction module based on the M​C​H−d​i​v​e​r​g​e​n​c​e𝑀𝐶𝐻𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒MCH-divergence to identity the mixed classes feature, as well as a semantic bridge component to increase semantic separability between single-class and mixed-class features. The two modules are used together to provide homogeneous feature alignment and reduce negative transmission. On the other hand, according to the receptive field theory, the larger a feature’s receptive field, the greater probability of a positive sample, and vice versa, the greater probability of a negative sample, which will result in a severe sample imbalance for the domain classification network in the domain adaptive object detection. Recent works [ref]4 [ref]5 [ref]6  estimate the H−d​i​v​e​r​g​e​n​c​e𝐻𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒H-divergence of each feature in the local feature map, which is different from the classification task. As shown the loss of domain adaptation(DA) below: Here, D(u,v)superscript𝐷𝑢𝑣D^{(u,v)} is the output of the domain classification network, D^^𝐷\\hat{D} is the label of the feature. H𝐻H and W𝑊W are the height and width of the feature map, this means the total number of features is H​X​W𝐻𝑋𝑊HXW. There will be a large number of positive samples or negative samples for each iterate in training, which will cause the loss of domain adaptation imbalance. To address this issue, we presented a semantic attention domain adaptation loss based on the output of the semantic prediction module. Because the semantic prediction module’s output contains the probability of the classes in the feature, we can derive the foreground attention map from it. As a result, we can use the foreground attention map to alter the domain classification network’s loss to mitigate the consequences of sample imbalance. The main contributions of this work are three-fold: We propose a Mixed-Classes H−d​i​v​e​r​g​e​n​c​e𝐻𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒H-divergence (M​C​H−d​i​v​e​r​g​e​n​c​e𝑀𝐶𝐻𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒MCH-divergence), which achieves a more accurate feature distribution distance between source and target domain by measuring the H−d​i​v​e​r​g​e​n​c​e𝐻𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒H-divergence with single and mixed classes. Based on M​C​H−d​i​v​e​r​g​e​n​c​e𝑀𝐶𝐻𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒MCH-divergence, we propose a domain adaption model for object detection with a semantic prediction module and a semantic bridge component that may strengthen feature semantic information and realize the semantic separation of a single class and a mixed class. Thus, they can achieve homogeneous feature alignment and reduce negative transfer. We propose a semantic attention domain loss to reduce the sample imbalance problem, which is based on the output of semantic prediction module.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: approach (UDA) is tailored to address this problem without extra annotated data, which aims at adaptively conveying knowledge from the source domain to the target domain.
