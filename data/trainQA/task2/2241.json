      "content": "Paper Title: Stable, Fast and Accurate: Kernelized Attention with Relative Positional Encoding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTransformer  has achieved tremendous success on a variety of tasks in natural language processing   , computer vision    and speech¬†. Despite the great success, Transformers are usually inefficient in modeling long-sequence input since the key component‚Äîthe attention module‚Äîneeds to calculate pairwise correlations between all the positions, which comes with quadratic time and memory cost with respect to the sequence length nùëõn. To reduce the cost, many works focus on approximating the dot-then-exponentiate function in the attention module of the original Transformer . Most works can be roughly categorized into three classes: sparse attention  3 0  1  , low-rank approximation-based attention   and kernelized attention¬† 2 [ref]4. Sparse attention variants design either pre-defined  3 0  or learnable patterns 1   to reduce the amount of the key-value pairs that each query needs to attend to. Low-rank approximation-based attention variants project the key matrix into a length-agnostic low-dimensional space , or use Nystr√∂m approximation  to reduce the quadratic dependency on sequence length. The kernelized attention is first developed in  , which introduces a kernel view on the dot-then-exponentiate softmax function and comes up with a linear attention mechanism. Followed-up works 2 [ref]4 theoretically investigate the choices of different kernel feature maps and propose several random feature maps that achieve much better performance on various applications. However, in recently developed Transformers, the attention mechanism is designed to be more complicated than dot-then-exponentiation. For example, the relative positional encoding (RPE) 8 5 has become standard in state-of-the-art models 5  : Besides using the dot-products between queries and keys, RPE incorporates a position-correlation matrix in the softmax exponentiation to encode the distance between any two positions. With RPE, Transformers can effectively capture the relative word orders and achieve superior performance on various tasks. As Transformer with RPE is more powerful, one may wonder whether the model can be still approximated by directly applying previous acceleration approaches. Unfortunately, we mathematically show that such a term expands the expressiveness of dot-then-exponentiation, i.e., for some attention with RPE, there exists no dot-then-exponentiate function that can represent it. Therefore, previous approaches cannot be directly applied to approximate Transformers with RPE and obtain non-trivial speed-up. In this paper, we develop a novel attention computation that achieves an almost-linear speed-up rate for Transformer with RPE. We build our method on top of the kernelized attention in [ref]4 2. The kernelized attention method replaces the dot-then-exponentiate attention by a simple matrix multiplication between the kernelized features of queries and key-value pairs. When taking RPE into the kernelized attention, one can naively multiply the n√ónùëõùëõn\\times n RPE position-correlation matrix with kernelized feature matrices, which leads to a trivial quadratic time cost. While interestingly, we find that the elements in the RPE position-correlation matrix are determined by the relative distance between positions, and this matrix is precisely a Toeplitz matrix. In numerical linear algebra, it is well-known that multiplication between a Toeplitz matrix and row vectors can be accelerated using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). And by using FFT, we can obtain a fast attention computation with ùí™‚Äã(n‚Äãlog‚Å°n)ùí™ùëõùëõ\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n) time cost. Beyond the efficiency, we also find that our method that incorporates RPE into kernelized attention can also stabilize the training of such models. As demonstrated by several works  [ref]4, although these kernelized attention methods have theoretical guarantees to approximate the softmax attention, they face optimization issues and will diverge when training from scratch for large-scale tasks. This significantly limits the practical impact of the model as we have to train a standard Transformer first and convert it to kernelized attention with finetuning. We first shed light upon the reason for this phenomenon by proving that these kernelized attentions have an unacceptable variance when the ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2} norms of queries and keys are large. However, queries and keys with large norms usually appear during training, leading to optimization instability or sub-optimal solutions. When incorporating RPE, we can properly normalize queries and keys to obtain a ‚Äúlow-variance‚Äù attention, making the training stable. Since the value range of the relative positional encodings is not constrained, the whole model can still have enough capacity to achieve good performance. We conduct experiments on a wide range of tasks spanning language pre-training, machine translation and image classification. On all the tasks, we show that our model can be trained from scratch stably, outperforms other competitive efficient models, and is faster than the standard Transformer in the long-sequence regime.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: module of the original Transformer .
