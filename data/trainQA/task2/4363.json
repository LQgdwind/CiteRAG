      "content": "Paper Title: Model-Agnostic and Diverse Explanations for Streaming Rumour Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExplainable rumour detection.\nMost existing approaches to rumour detection neglect the question why\ncertain entities have been classified as a rumour. For this reason, techniques\nfrom the field of explainable machine learning have been adopted recently.\nHowever, explainable rumour detection focuses on pinpointing specific features\nthat explain the detection results . Also, for rumour\ndetection based on deep learning, attention mechanisms and gradient activation\nmaps have been employed to explain the latent features used in the\ndetection . However, understanding the structure of rumours\nturned out to be more important than understanding the detection\nitself  [ref]18  . Due to the graph-based propagation structures of\nrumours, explanations solely based on features insufficient    4. Recently, approaches to construct graph-based explanations using graph neural\nnetworks have been proposed     . However, the explanation is\nstill given in terms of gradient footprints of the deep learning model rather\nthan the characteristics of the rumour itself. Also, the\nexplanation technique depends on the deep learning model and, hence,\ncannot be generalised to other detection techniques. We go beyond the state of the art by considering the detection technique as a\nblack-box and by providing subgraphs of related rumours as explanations. We\nlater show empirically that such explanations have a high discriminating power. Computational explanations.\nVarious paradigms to explain computational results have been studied in the\nliterature, including interpretable models, rule-based explanations,\ncounterfactuals, and\nfeature-based explanations . Interpretable models enable a direct inspection of\nthe factors that govern some computation, e.g., regressions, decision trees,\ngeneralized additive models, and Bayesian networks. For example, the weights\nlearned in a linear regression and the path taken in a decision tree can\ndirectly be interpreted by a user.\nHowever, such interpretable models\nare not sufficiently expressive to capture the structure of rumours. As argued above, explanations based on examples are most suited in the context\nof rumour detection. The reason being that rumours\ninvolve human perception, which is difficult to capture with discrete\nrules , whereas feature-based approaches fail to capture\nthe graph-based structures of rumour propagation [ref]8.\nCounter-factual explanations, in turn, focus on features that may change the\nresult of rumour detection rather than the features that led to the detection\nresult in the first place . While synthetic examples have the advantage of gradient optimisation 0 to generate them, real examples have the benefits of acting as case studies to convince decision makers in critical applications such as healthcare and social informatics 1. Similar to example-based explanations based on subgraphs, as targetted in our\nwork, exemplary contextual information, such as\nuser comments, may be extracted to explain detected\nrumours [ref]8. However,\nsuch contextual information tends to be subjective and provides limited insight\non the rumour as a whole. By extracting subgraphs of past rumours, our approach\nsupports a more comprehensive assessment of the properties that characterize a\nrumour. Subgraph querying.\nOur work is orthogonal to graph search. This is because the subgraphs that\nserve as explanations do not necessarily participate in the prediction of the\nrumour of interest. Even if the subgraphs and the considered rumour are of\nsimilar structure (and they are close in the embedding space), it is not\nobvious to what extent the detection technique applied the same reasoning and\nwhich features influenced the classification as a\nrumour . Thereon, we formulate a\nsubgraph selection problem that maximises a notion of explanation utility,\nwhich incorporates both similarity and diversity of the respective subgraphs.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: have been employed to explain the latent features used in the\ndetection .
