Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Du et al.   synthesized virtual outliers to shape the decision boundary of networks and used energy as an uncertainty measure.\nHowever,\nto ensure the accuracy of detecting known objects,\nthey suppress both unknowns and non-objects in training,\nleading to a low recall of unknowns.\nIn contrast,\nour method aims to detect all unknown objects. Open-world object detection (OWOD) is proposed by ORE .\nIt detects both known and unknown objects by training pseudo-labeled unknown objects and incrementally learns updated annotations of new classes.\nOW-DETR  improves performance with multi-scale self-attention and deformable receptive fields. Yang et al.  introduced semantic topology to ensure that the feature representations are discriminative and consistent.\nUC-OWOD  also classifies unknown objects to achieve better results than ORE on measures about unknown classes.\nZhao et al.  correct the auto-labeled proposals by Selective Search and calibrate the over-confident activation boundary by a class-specific expelling function.\nHowever, the auto-labeling step generates many pseudo-unknown samples that are unrepresentative of the unknowns in fact,\nlimiting their ability to transfer knowledge from the known to the unknown.\nThus, during inference, many non-objects are mis-detected as unknown,\nleading to the low precision of unknown.\nThis paper aims to reduce the false positives by the proposed GOC score and a graph-based box determination scheme.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: deal with unknown samples encountered in classification or detection tasks.\nMany uncertainties measuring the feature difference between unknown and known objects have been proposed,\nsuch as OpenMax [ref]1, MSP [ref]16, ODIN [ref]19, Mahalanobis distance  and Energy .\nFor detection, some works    used Monte Carlo dropout to generate uncertainty scores.\nDavid et al.  proposed probabilistic\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
