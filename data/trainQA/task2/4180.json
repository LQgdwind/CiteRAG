      "content": "Paper Title: Benchmarking Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Models through the Lens of Interpretability\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we discuss how to use feature importance to investigate what a CATE estimator (or: model) has learned about treatment effect heterogeneity. We start by describing a general feature importance formalism: We assume that we have access to a black-box model τ^:ℝd→ℝ:^𝜏→superscriptℝ𝑑ℝ\\hat{\\tau}:\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} to estimate the CATE τ𝜏\\tau. Feature importance methods permit to understand the prediction of this model by highlighting features (covariates) the model is sensitive to. Concretely, this is done by assigning an importance score ai​(τ^,x)∈ℝsubscript𝑎𝑖^𝜏𝑥ℝa_{i}(\\hat{\\tau},x)\\in\\mathbb{R} to each feature xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} contained in the vector x𝑥x with 111In the following, [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n] denotes the set of natural numbers between 111 and n∈ℕ∗𝑛superscriptℕn\\in\\mathbb{N}^{*}. i∈[d]𝑖delimited-[]𝑑i\\in[d]. This score reflects the importance of xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} to predict the CATE τ^​(x)^𝜏𝑥\\hat{\\tau}(x). The score is such that the importance of a feature xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} increases with |ai​(τ^,x)|subscript𝑎𝑖^𝜏𝑥\\left|a_{i}(\\hat{\\tau},x)\\right|. When it comes to the sign, features with ai​(τ^,x)>0subscript𝑎𝑖^𝜏𝑥0a_{i}(\\hat{\\tau},x)>0 tend to increase the CATE τ^​(x)^𝜏𝑥\\hat{\\tau}(x) and features with ai​(τ^,x)<0subscript𝑎𝑖^𝜏𝑥0a_{i}(\\hat{\\tau},x)<0 tend to decrease it. There exist many methods to assign importance scores ai​(τ^,x)subscript𝑎𝑖^𝜏𝑥a_{i}(\\hat{\\tau},x) to the features. Different feature importance methods tend to attribute different relative importance between features  . This is because they measure different characteristics of the black-box model: gradient-based methods compute scores based on the model’s gradient with respect to the features  [ref]37 [ref]38 [ref]39; perturbation-based methods compute scores based on the model’s sensitivity to features perturbations    and some other methods rely on the neuron’s activation to compute the importance scores  .\nIn Section 5, we use Integrated Gradients [ref]37 as our main feature importance method. This is because it offers the best performances empirically and is typically more computationally efficient than the previous methods. A comparison between different feature importance methods is provided in Appendix B. We will now discuss the specificity of CATE models in an interpretability perspective. What Makes CATE Interpretability Special? Above, we fixed the black-box to interpret to be the CATE estimate τ^^𝜏\\hat{\\tau}. However, CATE can of course also be written (and, as in most methods proposed in the recent ML literature, be estimated) in terms of the expected POs, i.e. τ=μ1−μ0𝜏subscript𝜇1subscript𝜇0\\tau=\\mu_{1}-\\mu_{0}, which have their own feature importance ai​(μ0,x)subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝜇0𝑥a_{i}(\\mu_{0},x) and ai​(μ1,x)subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝜇1𝑥a_{i}(\\mu_{1},x). In general, feature importance for CATE will differ from those of the POs, leading to different insights. This multiplicity of interpretation certainly distinguishes CATE models from interpreting standard supervised learners and deserves a discussion. In order to attach meaning to those possible interpretations, it is useful to consider an important distinction between so-called predictive and prognostic covariates made in the medical literature  . Prognostic covariates determine outcome regardless of treatment assignment – common risk factors such as age or gender may fall in this category. Such variables are taken into account by the two potential outcomes μwsubscript𝜇𝑤\\mu_{w} in a similar way. In this way, prognostic covariates correspond to features xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} that are important for both POs ai​(μ0,x)≠0subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝜇0𝑥0a_{i}(\\mu_{0},x)\\neq 0 and ai​(μ1,x)≠0subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝜇1𝑥0a_{i}(\\mu_{1},x)\\neq 0. Predictive covariates, on the other end, are predictive of effect heterogeneity, i.e they determine differential responses to treatment – hormone receptor status in cancer patients is one such example . In this way, predictive covariates correspond to features xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} that are important for the CATE ai​(τ,x)≠0subscript𝑎𝑖𝜏𝑥0a_{i}(\\tau,x)\\neq 0. In the medical context, any measured patient covariate could be prognostic, predictive or both (or, of course, irrelevant). Whereas  used a model-distillation approach to interpret only the PO models, we argue that it is most interesting in the CATE estimation context to interpret the learned CATE models directly by focusing on the discovery of predictive covariates. Identifying such predictive covariates can, for example, provide precious information to support exploratory analyses in clinical trials, which in turn allow pharmaceutical companies to refine the target population for a treatment, improving the likelihood of a successful later stage trial . From that perspective, CATE models τ^^𝜏\\hat{\\tau} that are better at identifying predictive covariates are clearly preferable. Due to the absence of treatment effect labels (Section 2), it is far from obvious whether all estimation strategies result in successful identification of predictive covariates. Furthermore, since indirect learners target the CATE indirectly through the POs, there is no guarantee that the resulting models can distinguish between prognostic and predictive covariates. With these simple observations, it is obvious that CATE interpretability comes with a unique set of challenges. We will now introduce a benchmark to study CATE models through this angle.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: between features  .
