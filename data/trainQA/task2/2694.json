      "content": "Paper Title: Image Captioning for Effective Use of Language Models in Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are many visual question-answering datasets in the literature [ref]1  , where given an image and a question about the contents of that image, a system has to provide a textual answer. Some VQA datasets also demand leveraging external knowledge to infer the answer and, thus, they are known as knowledge-based VQA tasks. Good examples are KB-VQA , KVQA , FVQA  and OK-VQA . KVQA requires knowledge about named entities (e.g. Barack Obama, White House, United Nations) and that knowledge is already provided as a graph. FVQA annotates questions by selecting a fact from a fixed knowledge base but its size is relatively small. KB-VQA is even smaller, presenting template-based questions whose answers can be obtained reasoning over commonsense resources or Wikipedia. In contrast, OK-VQA requires knowledge from unspecified external resources and, although smaller than KVQA in terms of the number of images and question-answer pairs, it is considerably bigger than the other knowledge-based VQA datasets. Currently, multimodal transformers are the most successful systems for VQA and can be broadly classified into two types: single-stream and double-stream transformers. A good example of the former is VisualBERT [ref]15, where the BERT architecture  is used, adding visual features obtained by an object detector as input and using visio-linguistic pretraining tasks, such as image-text matching. OSCAR  also follows a very similar philosophy, adding object tags to the input and proposing different pretraining strategies. Among double-stream transformers, VilBERT  and LXMERT  use a dedicated transformer for each modality (text and image) to fuse them with a cross-modal transformer. Their differences lie mainly on some architectural choices and pretraining task selection . Regarding OK-VQA systems, multimodal transformers have also been used to provide implicit knowledge from pretraining tasks. For example, VilBERT uses a pretrained BERT to encode the questions, so it uses the implicit knowledge that BERT acquired during its pretraining. Additionally, VilBERT is further trained on Conceptual Captions , a large image-caption dataset from where additional knowledge can be acquired. Those multimodal transformers are the backbone of most models used for OK-VQA, which also use symbolic knowledge to bring some extra performance. ConceptBert  was the first system to use multimodal transformers and symbolic knowledge for OK-VQA. It is based on a combination of a pretrained BERT to encode questions, a graph convolutional neural network to encode triples extracted from the ConceptNet knowledge graph [ref]5 and a multimodal transformer (VilBERT) to jointly represent and reason over image features and encoded question tokens. A similar approach was followed by KRISP , combining again a multimodal transformer with symbolic knowledge. In this case, the multimodal transformer, MMBERT, is based on VisualBert [ref]15 and initialized with the weights of a pretrained BERT. Additionally, authors built a knowledge graph fusing DBPedia , ConceptNet [ref]5, VisualGenome  and hasPart KB . They used different image feature encoders and the question tokens to obtain a subset of the full graph relevant to the target question and image. Finally, using a graph convolutional neural network, they combined the symbolic and implicit knowledge to predict the final answer. Some recent approaches, named MAVEx  and RVL  showed different ways to combine implicit and symbolic knowledge. MAVEx used a pretrained VilBERT to generate various candidate answers which were later validated using answer-specific knowledge retrieval. Authors used both textual and visual knowledge resources, including images searched using Google, sentences from Wikipedia articles, and concepts from ConceptNet. On the other hand, RVL trained the two-stream multimodal transformer LXMERT  with an auxiliary objective that aligned its representations with knowledge graph embeddings retrieved from ConceptNet and Wikidata. Integrating annotated captions, or other types of text related to the image, in multimodal systems benefit several multimodal challenges. Examples range from fake news detection  to image classification tasks such as flower  and crisis  classification. However, regarding the use of automatically generated captions for VQA, to the best of our knowledge, Mucko 0 and PICa  are the only systems that explore this idea.\nMucko uses dense captions 1 to query a knowledge graph to extract relevant information to answer the question. The reported results on OK-VQA are well below the state-of-the-art. Dense captions describe different regions of an image using short sentences. Our method differs in the use of a single caption which is the input to the LM, and does not require neither knowledge graphs nor the use of OCR systems that have recently been integrated in some other VQA models 2 3. On the other hand, PICa takes advantage of the implicit knowledge found in GPT-3 4 via prompt-engineering. Instead of supervised fine-tuning, PICa adapts to the task with a few in-context examples during inference time using both captions and object tags to describe the image, defining the current state-of-the-art with an ensemble of GPT-3’s and clever selection of those examples. However, GPT-3 is only accessible via OpenAI’s paid API and it has limited functionalities.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: There are many visual question-answering datasets in the literature [ref]1  , where given an image and a question about the contents of that image, a system has to provide a textual answer.
