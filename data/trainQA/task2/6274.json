      "content": "Paper Title: Human-imperceptible, Machine-recognizable Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVision transformers. Self-attention based Transformer¬†[ref]12 has achieved great success in natural language processing. To make Transformer suitable for image classification, the pioneering work of ViT¬†[ref]8 directly tokenizes and flattens 2D images into a sequence of tokens. Since then, researchers have been working on improving Vision Transformers and examples include DeiT¬†[ref]13, T2T-ViT¬†, PVT¬†, and Swin-Transformer¬†. In addition, the intriguing properties of ViT are investigated in¬†. Jigsaw puzzle solver. The goal of a jigsaw puzzle solver is to reconstruct an original image from its shuffled patches. Since this problem is NP-hard¬†, solving jigsaw puzzles of non-trivial size is impossible. Most of the existing works in computer vision focus on the jigsaw puzzle problem composed of equally-sized image patches and examples include the greedy algorithm proposed in¬†, the particle filter-based algorithm proposed in¬†, the fully-automatic solver proposed in ¬†, and the genetic-based solver proposed in¬†. Privacy-preserving machine learning. The aim of privacy-preserving machine learning is to integrate privacy-preserving techniques into the machine learning pipeline. According to the phases of privacy integration, existing methods can be basically divided into four categories: data preparation, model training and evaluation, model deployment, and model inference¬†. Federated learning allows multiple participants to jointly train a machine learning model while preserving their private data from being exposed¬†. However, the leakage of gradients¬† or confidence information ¬† can be utilized to recover original images such as human faces. From the perspective of data, encrypting data and then learning and inferencing on encrypted data can provide a strong privacy guarantee, called confidential-level privacy, which receives increasing attention recently. Manually anonymizing large-scale datasets faces the challenge of inefficiency and the need to develop specialized techniques¬†, and thus the automatic encryption approaches such as homomorphic encryption and functional encryption have been employed to encrypt data due to their nature of allowing computation over encrypted data¬† . However, scaling them to deep networks and large datasets still faces extreme difficulties due to the high computational complexity involved for encryption. The block-wise pixel shuffling encryption strategy¬†  and the pixel-based image encryption strategy¬† have low computational complexity for encryption, but they are vulnerable to reconstruction attacks because of the limited dimension of the key space¬† or suffer from large performance degradation¬†. In contrast, our encryption strategies are simple, efficient and easy to implement, and can be applied to position-sensitive tasks. Differential privacy. Differential privacy is defined in terms of the application-specific concept of adjacent datasets¬†, which bounds the disclosure risk of any individual participating in a dataset to guarantee data privacy. Then, researchers have been working on expanding its application scope. For example, Ferdinando et al. propose a differential-privacy mechanism for releasing hierarchical counts of individuals¬†. Liu et al. study the interpretation robustness problem from the perspective of Re¬¥¬¥ùëí\\acute{e}nyi differential privacy. We aim to process images to be ‚Äúhuman-imperceptible, machine-recognizable‚Äù, which is different from differential privacy that limits the information that attackers can learn about datasets. Similar idea is also mentioned in¬† but the scheme has proved to be not private in¬†. Word order in transformers for NLP. Recent studies in the natural language processing field suggest that higher-order co-occurrence statistics of words play a major role in masked language models like BERT¬†. Moreover, it has been shown that the word order contains surprisingly little information compared to that contained in the bag of words, since the understanding of syntax and the compressed world knowledge held by large models (e.g. BERT and GPT-2) are capable to infer the word order¬†. Due to the property of attention operation, when removing positional encoding, ViT is permutation-invariant w.r.t. its attentive tokens. As evaluated by our experiments, removing the positional embedding from ViT only leads to a moderate performance drop (%3.1, please see Table¬†1). Such a phenomenon inspires us to explore the permutation-based encryption strategy.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Vision transformers.
