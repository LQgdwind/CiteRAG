      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Conditional Imitation Learning for Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe mediated perception approaches   for autonomous driving involve sub-components for detecting driving-relevant objects  (as cars , pedestrians , lanes’ markings [ref]34, or more objects), tracking of driving scene objects , motion planning [ref]30, drivable free space detection  , collision avoidance , mapping , and more models. Then the results from these sub-components are then combined in a rule-based module that produces vehicle driving actions . Such mediated perception approach relies on scene understanding  on a level that might add redundant information and unnecessary complexity; a small portion of the detected objects are relevant to driving decisions. It also requires robust solutions to open challenges in scene understanding and expensive data annotation . Direct perception  is another approach that learns a mapping from the input camera image to several meaningful affordance indicators of the driving situation, then a rule-based controller translates them into driving actions. Those indicators are chosen via heuristics and the controller design is as expensive as the case with the mediated perception rule-based module . Another approach is to learn driving trajectory planning end-to-end while leaving the vehicle control component outside the end-to-end trained module  . As an alternative to the mediated perception approach, the end-to-end imitation learning approach directly maps input sensory data to driving actions via deep machine learning regression [ref]4 0  . Such behavior reflex approach optimizes the aforementioned autonomous driving sub-components simultaneously, the system self-optimizes aiming to maximize overall system performance. Unlike in the mediated perception approach, optimizing human-selected intermediate criteria doesn’t guarantee maximizing overall system performance, because such criteria are selected to ease human interpretation [ref]4. The major drawback of the end-to-end learning approach is that the vehicle cannot be guided to take a specific turn at an upcoming intersection. The CIL model   overcomes the end-to-end approach such a limitation by training, on top of a perception Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), multiple different command-conditional modules (”branches”) predicting driving commands for each possible navigational command. A topological global route planner is used to estimate a sparse list of waypoints towards the destination and based on it, the navigational command is determined for each waypoint. Based on the navigational command received from the global route planner, the proper branch is selected to control the vehicle in order to reach the destination. In , a hybrid A* search algorithm  is developed to predict a detailed vehicle drivable trajectory to reach the destination which is more computationally expensive than the adopted planning method in this work that estimates a sparse list of waypoints. Similarly, another approach for global planning is based on deep learning 1 which is considerably more computationally expensive. Another weakness in such a learning-based planner is that it depends on the structure of a particular environment where the model is trained on and requires a semantic map of the environment. To cope with potential changes in certain regions in the environment, a local learning-based planner can be added which further increases the computational demands. In  , the CIL model is demonstrated to drive efficiently when deployed in the same training environments. However, performance dramatically decreases when deployed to new environments that are unseen during training time and is inconsistent against varying weathers. In addition, the CIL method cannot dynamically detect and handle road unexpected temporary stationary blockages like for example due to work zones. Various reasons have led to an ever-increasing number of road work zones of different looks and shapes even during demanding traffic levels due to maintenance, construction, and rehabilitation activities 0. Autonomous vehicles should dynamically detect such road blockages and the global route planner should estimate a new route to the destination as a result. In Junior car , road blockages are avoided using a drivable free space detection rule-based method. The LiDAR point cloud is analyzed against predefined thresholds and a hybrid A* planner was introduced to predict the vehicle trajectory, which makes such a method not directly compatible with the approach of learning the driving policy end-to-end. Moreover, three LiDAR sensors were used to predict a reliable vehicle trajectory. Table I summarizes the comparison between mediated perception and end-to-end approaches. * Limitations tackled by the CIL approach The Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) algorithm is introduced in . The produced map is represented in a top-view grayscale image format, where pixel intensities represent the probability of occupancy given LiDAR point cloud. Within each grid cell, the occupancy is estimated recursively using a binary Bayes filter, which creates a history effect that makes it robust against the problems of missed and false measurements. The original OGM algorithm  assumes map cells independence, which induces map grid cell conflicts that lead to inconsistent maps. To overcome such an inconsistency problem, a forward model  is introduced to maintain dependencies between neighboring map grid cells. The algorithm is widely adopted for probabilistic localization and mapping in robotics , existing autonomous vehicles , and vehicle trajectory prediction . Mapping large roadway environments with a high-resolution OGM can impose prohibitive memory requirements. Existing probabilistic quadtrees methods  provide compact map representations that significantly reduce the OGM memory footprint, however, they do not guarantee that the stored mapping information is utilized for the roadway information that is most important to the driving situation. This can be achieved by dynamic vehicle positioning, combined with map management techniques based on 2D ring buffers  or twisted torus topology 9. Nevertheless, vehicle dynamic positioning results into map inaccuracies due to the computationally expensive and inaccurate image sub-pixel shifting and rotation operations to compensate for ego-vehicle motion.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: The mediated perception approaches   for autonomous driving involve sub-components for detecting driving-relevant objects  (as cars , pedestrians , lanes’ markings [ref]34, or more objects), tracking of driving scene objects , motion planning [ref]30, drivable free space detection  , collision avoidance , mapping , and more models.
