      "content": "Paper Title: Metric Dimension and Geodetic Set Parameterized by Vertex Cover\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe have seen that both Metric Dimension and Geodetic Set enjoy a (tight) non-trivial\n2𝒪​(𝚟𝚌2)superscript2𝒪superscript𝚟𝚌22^{\\mathcal{O}(\\mathtt{vc}^{2})} dependency in the vertex cover number\nparameterization. Both problems are \\FPT for related parameters, such\nas vertex integrity, treedepth, distance to (co-)cluster, distance to\ncograph, etc., as more generally, they are \\FPT for cliquewidth plus\ndiameter [ref]22 . For both problems, it was proved that the\ncorrect dependency in treedepth (and treewidth plus diameter) is in fact\ndouble-exponential , a fact\nthat is also true for feedback vertex set plus diameter for\nMetric Dimension . For distance to\n(co-)cluster, algorithms with double-exponential dependency were given\nfor Metric Dimension in . For the parameter max leaf number\nℓℓ\\ell, the algorithm for Metric Dimension from  uses ILPs, with a\ndependency of the form 2𝒪​(ℓ6​log⁡ℓ)superscript2𝒪superscriptℓ6ℓ2^{\\mathcal{O}(\\ell^{6}\\log\\ell)} (a similar\nalgorithm for Geodetic Set with dependency 2𝒪​(f​log⁡f)superscript2𝒪𝑓𝑓2^{\\mathcal{O}(f\\log f)} exists for\nthe feedback edge set number f𝑓f ), which is unknown to be\ntight. What is the correct dependency for all these parameters?\nIn particular, it seems interesting to determine for which parameter(s) the\njump from double-exponential to single-exponential dependency occurs. For the related problem Strong Metric Dimension, the correct\ndependency in the vertex cover number is known to be\ndouble-exponential . It would\nbe nice to determine whether similarly intriguing behaviors can be\nexhibited for related metric-based problems, such as Strong\nGeodetic Set, whose parameterized complexity was recently adressed\nin [ref]16 . Perhaps our techniques are\napplicable to such related problems.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: problems are \\FPT for related parameters, such\nas vertex integrity, treedepth, distance to (co-)cluster, distance to\ncograph, etc., as more generally, they are \\FPT for cliquewidth plus\ndiameter [ref]22 .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
