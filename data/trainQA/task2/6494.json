      "content": "Paper Title: Probabilistic Constraint for Safety-Critical Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement learning (RL) has proven to succeed in solving a wide variety of sequential decision-making problems, such as playing video games , mastering Go , control problems , robotic manipulation  and locomotion . RL problems are generally formulated as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). When dynamic models of MDPs are accessible, optimal policies can be derived using dynamic programming . However, in cases where the underlying dynamics are unknown, the policy needs to be learned from system samples. Numerous RL algorithms  [ref]8  0 1, exhibiting diverse degrees of effectiveness, have been developed to tackle these problems. Nevertheless, in general, RL algorithms are only concerned with maximizing the expected cumulative reward 2 3, which may lead to unsafe behaviors 4 in realistic domains. Safety constitutes a foundational aspect in the design of control systems for physical entities. Specifically, controllers employed in power systems are meticulously crafted to avert voltage instabilities 5, which may lead to hazardous operational conditions. Similarly, in the realm of robot navigation, ensuring collision avoidance 6 is essential for their proper functioning, and to ensure the preservation of human safety in the vicinity. Taking into account the safety requirements motivates the development of policy optimization under safety guarantees 7 8 9. Several approaches consider risk-aware objectives where the reward is modified to take into account the safety requirements 0 1 2. A limitation of these approaches is that reward shaping (the process of combining reward with safety requirements) is, in general, a time-consuming process of hyper-parameter tuning that requires human intervention and it is problem dependent 3 4. To mitigate this issue, a common approach is to employ the framework of Constrained MDPs (CMDPs) 5\nwhere additional cumulative (or average) cost needs to be maintained within a desired threshold. This framework has gained widespread adoption for inducing safe behaviors 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4. To solve these constrained optimization problems, regularization method 5 and primal-dual algorithms 6 7 8 9 0 are generally considered.\nIn this setting, it is noteworthy that even safety violations in all trajectories are acceptable as long as the amount of violations does not exceed the desired threshold. This makes them often not suitable for safety-critical applications 6 7 8. For instance, in the context of autonomous driving, even one single collision with obstacles/pedestrians is unacceptable. A more suitable notion for safety-critical context is to guarantee that the whole trajectory of the system remains within a set that is deemed to be safe. Ideally, one would like to achieve this goal for every possible trajectory. This being an ambitious goal, in this work we settle for problems that guarantee safety with high probability. We describe this setting in detail in Section II. Problems of this form, have been considered in 7 9. The main challenge to solving such probabilistic-constrained problems is that policy gradient-like expressions for the probabilistic constraints are not readily available. This, in turn, prevents from running classical policy-based algorithms such as REINFORCE , as well as state-of-the-art policy-based algorithms like DDPG [ref]8, TRPO , PPO 0, and SAC 1 within the realm of probabilistic-constrained RL. Perhaps, for this reason, cumulative constraints are normally considered in the literature 0 1. In Section III, we delve into the interrelationships between probabilistic-constrained and cumulative-constrained RL problems in terms of the objective optimality and safety satisfaction. The cumulative constraint can be construed as a more lenient form of the probabilistic constraint, providing a relaxed framework for achieving desired outcomes. In addition, we establish theoretical bounds indicating that working directly with the probabilistic constraint provides advantages over the cumulative setting, i.e., an improved optimality-safety trade-off (Theorem 1). As previously mentioned, there is no direct way to tackle probabilistic-constrained RL problems due to the lack of policy gradient-like expressions for such formulations. Described in Section IV, our prior work 2 provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first explicit expression for the gradient of the probabilistic constraint, which can be naturally applied to the aforementioned classical and state-of-the-art algorithms. We term the gradient established in 2 Safe Policy Gradient-REINFORCE (SPG-REINFORCE). Building on 2, we here introduce an improved gradient, which we term SPG-Actor-Critic that exhibits reduced variance (Theorem 3). Section V proposes a Safe Primal-Dual algorithm that can leverage both SPGs to learn safe policies. Furthermore, we establish the convergence of the algorithm, as well as the feasibility and near-optimality of the algorithm on average. Other than concluding remarks (Section VII), this paper finishes with a series of numerical experiments in Section VI. We first consider a continuous navigation task that illustrates (i) the ability to implement Safe Primal-Dual algorithm that leverage both SPGs to train safe policies and (ii) the theoretical bounds established in Section III relating the problems with cumulative and probabilistic constraints. In particular, the latter traces a better optimality-safety trade-off. Subsequently, a lunar lander problem 3 showcases the successful application of SPGs in systems characterized by intricate dynamics.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: optimal policies can be derived using dynamic programming .
