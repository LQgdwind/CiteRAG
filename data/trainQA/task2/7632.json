      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Convex Hulls for Simple PathsA preliminary version of this paper will appear in Proceedings of the 40th International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2024).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComputing the convex hull of a set of n𝑛n points in the plane is a classic problem in computational geometry. Several algorithms can compute the convex hull in O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) time in the static setting. For example, Graham’s scan  and Andrew’s vertical sweep . Andrew’s algorithm can construct the convex hull in O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) time if the points are already sorted by either the x𝑥x-coordinates or the y𝑦y-coordinates.\nThis has been generalized by Graham and Yao  and by Melkman 7 to construct the convex hull of a simple path in O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) time.\nOutput-sensitive algorithms of O​(n​log⁡h)𝑂𝑛ℎO(n\\log h) time have also been achieved by Kirkpatrick and Seidel 5 and by Chan , where hℎh is the size of the convex hull. Overmars and van Leeuwen 9 studied the problem in the dynamic context where points can be inserted and deleted. Since a single point insertion and deletion can imply a linear change in the number of points on the convex hull, it is not desirable to report the entire convex hull explicitly after each update. Instead, one maintains a representation of the convex hull that can be queried. Overmars and van Leeuwen support the insertion and deletion of points in O​(log2⁡n)𝑂superscript2𝑛O(\\log^{2}n) time, where n𝑛n is the number of points stored. They maintain the points in sorted order in one dimension as the elements of a binary tree and bottom-up maintain a hierarchical composition of the convex hull. Since the convex hull is maintained explicitly as essentially a linked list at the root, the hℎh points on the hull can be reported in O​(h)𝑂ℎO(h) time, and queries on the convex hull can be supported in O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) time using appropriate binary searches. Some example convex hull queries are (see Figure 1): Determine whether a point q𝑞q is outside the convex hull, and if yes, compute the tangents (i.e., find the tangent points) of the convex hull through q𝑞q. Given a direction ρ𝜌\\rho, compute an extreme point on the convex hull along ρ𝜌\\rho. Given a line ℓℓ\\ell, determine whether ℓℓ\\ell intersects the convex hull, and if yes, find the two edges (bridges) on the convex hull intersected by ℓℓ\\ell. Tangent and extreme point queries are examples of decomposable queries, which are queries whose answers can be obtained in constant time from the query answers for any constant number of subsets that form a partition of the point set. In contrast, bridge queries are not decomposable. Chan  improved the update (insertion/deletion) time to amortized O​(log1+ε⁡n)𝑂superscript1𝜀𝑛O(\\log^{1+\\varepsilon}n), for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, by not maintaining an explicit representation of the convex hull. Tangent and extreme point queries are supported in O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) time, allowing the hℎh points on the convex hull to be reported in O​(h​log⁡n)𝑂ℎ𝑛O(h\\log n) time. The bridge query time was increased to O​(log3/2⁡n)𝑂superscript32𝑛O(\\log^{3/2}n). The update time was subsequently improved to amortized O​(log⁡n​log⁡log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(\\log n\\log\\log n) by Brodal and Jacob [ref]5 and Kaplan, Tarjan, Tsioutsiouliklis 4, and to amortized O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) by Brodal and Jacob . Chan  improved the time for bridge queries to 2O​(log⁡log⁡n​log⁡log⁡log⁡n)​log⁡nsuperscript2𝑂𝑛𝑛𝑛2^{O\\big{(}\\sqrt{\\log\\log n\\log\\log\\log n}\\big{)}}\\log n, with the same amortized update time. It is known that sub-logarithmic update time and logarithmic query time are not possible. For example, to achieve O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) time extreme point queries, an amortized update time Ω​(log⁡n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(\\log n) is necessary [ref]5. In this paper, we consider the dynamic convex hull problem for restricted updates, where we can achieve worst-case constant update time and logarithmic query time. In particular, we assume that the points are inserted and deleted in a deque (double-ended queue) and that they are geometrically restricted. We consider two restrictions: The first is the monotone path case, where all points in the deque are sorted in a given direction, say horizontally left-to-right, and only the leftmost and rightmost points can be inserted and deleted. The second case allows the points to form a simple path (i.e., a path that does not self intersections), where updates are restricted to both ends of the path. The simple path problem was previously studied by Friedman, Hershberger, and Snoeyink , who supported deque insertions in amortized O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) time, deletions in amortized O​(1)𝑂1O(1) time, and queries in O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) time. Bus and Buzer  considered a special case of the problem where insertions only happen to the “front” end of the path and deletions are only on points at the “rear” end. Based on the algorithm in 7, which can compute the convex hull of a simple path in linear time, they achieved O​(1)𝑂1O(1) amortized update time to support O​(h)𝑂ℎO(h) time hull reporting. However, hull queries were not considered in . Wang  recently considered a special monotone path case where updates are restricted to queue-like updates, i.e., insert a point to the right of the point set and delete the leftmost point of the point set. Wang called it window-sliding updates and achieved amortized constant time updates, hull queries in O​(log⁡h)𝑂ℎO(\\log h) time,111The runtime was O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) in the conference paper but was subsequently improved to O​(log⁡h)𝑂ℎO(\\log h) in the arXiv version https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08055. and hull reporting in O​(h)𝑂ℎO(h) time.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: The bridge query time was increased to O​(log3/2⁡n)𝑂superscript32𝑛O(\\log^{3/2}n).
