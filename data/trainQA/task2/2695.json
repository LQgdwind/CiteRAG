      "content": "Paper Title: Image Captioning for Effective Use of Language Models in Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost visio-linguistic tasks are framed in such a way that all the necessary information to solve them is in the images and texts provided in the dataset. That is the case of visual question-answering (VQA) [ref]1 or visual entailment [ref]2. In addition, some tasks require access to external knowledge in order to solve them. In this work we dive in Outside Knowledge VQA (OK-VQA) [ref]3, where the image content is not sufficient to answer the questions. Contrary to self-contained VQA tasks, which can be solved grounding images and text alone, these tasks require methods that leverage external knowledge resources and are able to do inference on that knowledge. External knowledge useful for OK-VQA can be broadly classified into two categories, according to : (i) symbolic knowledge, which can be represented using graphs, for example ConceptNet , and (ii) implicit knowledge, which is encoded in the weights of neural networks trained in different datasets. Supporting the later case, transformer-based language models (LM) pretrained in large corpora like BERT  have been successfully used as implicit knowledge bases . In this paper we focus on the use of implicit knowledge in the form of pretrained LMs. While using LMs is relatively common in OK-VQA, they are usually integrated into multimodal transformers by diverse means, so as to integrate the visual and textual inputs of the task. Given that LMs were originally designed to process textual input and are extensively trained in textual corpora, we hypothesized that a system that relies exclusively on text will allow LMs to better leverage their implicit knowledge. Because OK-VQA is a visio-linguistic task, we propose to use automatic image captioning as a way to verbalize the information in the image, where the captions are descriptions of the images which are used as input to the LMs. Once the captions are generated, all the inference in our method is done using text-only models. We are aware that captions do not contain all the information in an image, and want to check whether the text-only models can compensate for that initial loss of information. The approach proposed in this paper, named Caption-based Model or CBM can be seen in FigureÂ 1. To validate our hypothesis, we present an extensive experimentation on the OK-VQA dataset, comparing our proposed caption-based model with the de facto standard of visio-linguistic tasks, i.e. multimodal transformers, which are widely used in VQA tasks to process the questions (text) and images. We also focus on language models of different sizes, to see the impact of model capacity on OK-VQA. As a result of our experiments, we find that: Captions are more effective than images for OK-VQA when models of similar size are used as is, and achieve similar results when both are fine-tuned on additional VQA datasets. Increasing the size and the capacity of language models allows to reach state-of-the-art results, outperforming by a large margin current multimodal transformers. Furthermore, we observe a trend of improvement that has not yet stabilized. The complex use of in-context-learning as in PICa  does not beat fine-tuning our smaller model, that is, our system based on T5  obtains results comparable to an ensemble of five GPT-3 runs which are 15-times larger in parameters. The larger contribution of captions on OK-VQA with respect to results on a regular VQA dataset  show that text-only systems are specially effective when external knowledge is needed.
