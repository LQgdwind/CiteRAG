      "content": "Paper Title: G3SR: Global Graph Guided Session-based Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe roadmap of session-based recommendation starts from GRU4REC [ref]9 which first proposes this problem and uses recurrent neural networks to process session sequences. NARM [ref]10 and STAMP  are two milestones as they introduce well-designed attention mechanisms into this problem. Most recently, SR-GNN [ref]12 adopts graph neural networks to model complex transitions between items and becomes the new state-of-the-art. In this paper, we further study the use of graph pre-training techniques that fits the session-based recommendation problem. Therefore, we consider three types of baseline methods, namely, traditional methods, e.g. Item-KNN, Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)  and FPMC, deep-learning-based methods, e.g. GRU4REC, NARM and STAMP, and graph-aware methods, e.g. SR-GNN, FGNN and GCE-GNN: POP and S-POP are two widely used baselines which recommend items based on item popularity in the training set and in the current session respectively. Item-KNN  is an item-to-item collaborative filtering method, which recommends items similar to the last clicked item in the current session. Specifically, cosine similarity is used to measure the similarity. BPR  is a classical recommendation algorithm which optimizes the MF model with a pairwise ranking loss function via stochastic gradient descent. FPMC  is a sequential prediction method based on Markov chain, used for next-basket recommendation. In order to make it work on session-based recommendation, the user latent representation is ignored when computing recommendation scores. GRU4REC [ref]9 is a deep learning model based on RNN. It utilizes session-parallel mini-batch training, mini-batch based output sampling and a well-designed TOP1 loss function to help the RNN model to fit into the session-based recommendation problem. NARM [ref]10 is a method which introduces attention mechanism to capture the user’s main purpose. The main purpose is then combined with sequential behavioral feature and used as the final representation to generate the next item. STAMP  is a method which utilizes simple MLP enhanced by attention mechanism to capture user’s general interest and current interest of the current session simultaneously. SR-GNN [ref]12 is a state-of-the-art method that first introduces GNN to capture complex item transitions. To generate the next item of the current session, it uses the same idea as STAMP, i.e., utilizes an attention mechanism to capture user’s general interest and current interest. FGNN  and GCE-GNN  are two contemporary approaches that also utilize global information in session-based recommendation but in different ways compared with G3SR. FGNN extends the session graph to include global information and GCE-GNN modifies the model structure to introduce the information learned from the global graph. Both of these two approaches focus only on the supervision learning process.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: The roadmap of session-based recommendation starts from GRU4REC [ref]9 which first proposes this problem and uses recurrent neural networks to process session sequences.
