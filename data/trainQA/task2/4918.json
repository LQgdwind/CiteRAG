      "content": "Paper Title: Emerging Threats in Deep Learning-Based Autonomous Driving: A Comprehensive Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn 2014, researchers discovered that adding a small amount of specific interference, which is imperceptible to human beings, may still cause machine learning to be misled by attackers. This could cause serious security even safety problem, if machine learning be applied to a critical domain. Such an attack is known as adversarial examples attack and can be formalized as where f𝑓f denotes a machine learning model, x𝑥x denotes a test example, and x′superscript𝑥′x^{\\prime} denotes an adversarial example generated based on the addition of a small amount of interference, with c𝑐c for the prediction result of the model for a normal example, and c′superscript𝑐′c^{\\prime} for the prediction result of the model on the adversarial examples. After the first work, adversarial examples technique has been widely studied and has seen rapid development. FGSM algorithm proposed by Goodfellow et al. FGSM works by calculating the gradient of the loss function between the input and target classification and creating a small perturbation in terms of the sign vector coefficient of this gradient as: where xa​d​vsubscript𝑥𝑎𝑑𝑣x_{adv} denotes the corresponding adversarial example of x𝑥x, α𝛼\\alpha is a specific constant, s​i​g​n​()𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛sign() is a sign function, yt​r​u​esubscript𝑦𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒y_{true} is the the corresponding true label of x𝑥x, J​()𝐽J() denotes the loss function used to train the model, and ▽xsubscript▽𝑥\\triangledown_{x} denotes the the gradient of x𝑥x. The algorithm can be used to add a certain amount of adversarial noise to an image that is normally predicted as a panda, so that the machine learning model can predicted it as a gibbon with a high confidence. This algorithm could achieve both untargeted attacks and targeted attacks. There are more concerned adversarial examples algorithms be proposed in following. In 2016, Papernot et al.[ref]124 proposed a black-box attack using an alternative model approach. In 2017, Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. proposed an universal adversarial example attack, where a particular adversarial interference is able to influence the classification of multiple or even all examples in machine learning. In the same year, Carlini et al. proposed an optimization-based C&W algorithm to improve the adversarial examples attack. In 2018, Zhao et al. found that not need to be filled with artificial interference, but found different distribution in nature and can cause misclassification of machine learning models, which is called Natural Adversarial Examples. In the real physical world, the environment of autonomous driving is more complex, so there are more challenges for attacker to generate adversarial examples in the physical-world. The requirements of adversarial examples in the physical world are as follows. Physical generatible. In the physical world, it is insufficient that only adding perturbations via cyber space. Such perturbations must be capable of being physically generated by printing, 3D printing or spraying, etc. Local generatible. The local nature of the adversarial example. In an adversarial example of the digital world, the attacker can add perturbations to any pixel within the range of the image; however, in a physical world attack, there are often only local areas of the target that are available, and in many cases, the background areas of the image are difficult to use to generate a physical world adversarial example. Robustness. In the physical world, especially in the field of autonomous driving, it is often required that the adversarial examples can continuously produce misleading effects on machine learning models during multiple angle changes. At the same time, the adversarial examples need to be continuously effective against mainstream target recognition algorithms under certain distance and angle ranges, multiple natural environments, and multiple resolution sensor devices. This puts forward higher requirements on the persistence and universality of adversarial examples, which greatly increases the complexity of the generation of adversarial examples. Therefore, more adversarial example robustness enhancement measures are often required to realize the physical world adversarial example attacks; and the specific measures applied to vary according to different scenarios and attack targets. In accordance with the scenarios and objects for which countermeasures are set, this paper divides the recognition targets in the autonomous driving system into three categories: vehicles including various motor vehicles, pedestrians such as walkers and cyclists, and static targets like road facilities, traffic signs, markings, roadside advertising signs and other static objects. Thus, at present, the physical world in the autonomous driving field universally has 3 types of targets for adversarial example techniques: static objective recognition, pedestrian recognition, and vehicle recognition. Physical world adversarial examples for static targets. Such attack targets include a variety of static target recognition systems such as traffic signs, traffic signals, and traffic markings, which are characterized by the requirement that the adversarial examples can continuously and steadily interfere with the judgments of machine learning models over a large range of angles and distances. In 2017, Lu et al. successfully performed adversarial example generation in the physical world for the popular objective recognition algorithm FasterRCNN. To achieve better distance and angle range adaptation, in 2018, Eykholt et al. proposed the Robust Physical Perturbations (RP2) algorithm. In the same year, Chen et al. adopted the Expectation over Transformation (EoT) method to improve the generation of adversarial examples for traffic signs, resulting in improved adaptability of the adversarial examples to distance, angle, light and other environments. In 2019, Zhao et al.[ref]133 proposed the feature-interference reinforcement (FIR) algorithm and the realistic constraints generation (ERG) algorithm to enhance the robustness of the adversarial examples. At the same time, they proposed the nested-AE algorithm to improve the adaptability of the adversarial examples to long and short distances. Finally, the composite scheme is able to success attack against popular objective recognition algorithms, such as YOLO v3 and Faster-RCNN, within ±60∘plus-or-minussuperscript60\\pm 60^{\\circ} angle and [1​m,25​m]1𝑚25𝑚[1m,25m] distance range. Based on the above methods, hiding attacks and appearing attacks can be carried out. The hiding attack is to paste an adversarial example on a normal traffic sign to make the target recognition system fail to recognize the traffic sign. The appearing attack to paste an adversarial example on other objects, causing the target recognition system to recognize the object as a characteristic traffic sign or make a false recognition. In 2020, Kong et al. proposed PhysGAN, a physical world adversarial examples attack method based on adversarial example generative networks, and the generated adversarial examples of advertising signs have better robustness and invisibility. A physical world adversarial example for pedestrian recognition. In autonomous driving system, a missed detection of pedestrians by the objective recognition system can have serious consequences. In 2020, Wu[ref]135 proposed the \"invisibility cloak\" algorithm, where pedestrians are not normally detected by Yolo v2 and Yolo v3 objective detection models when wearing sprayed adversarial example clothing. In the same year, Wang et al. conducted a similar study. Physical world adversarial examples for vehicle recognition. These examples are often pasted or painted on the vehicle body with a specific pattern, so that the vehicle detection system can not identify the vehicle or mistakenly identify the vehicle as other objects. Such physical world adversarial examples try to maintain attack effectiveness under high speed movement, various light and other external conditions, especially in the 360-degree view and within the detection range of vehicle identification system, which puts forward higher requirements for the robustness of adversarial samples. At the same time, at different angles, the camera may only be able to acquire part of the images of he adversarial example in the vehicle body, which in turn places a local requirement on the adversarial example, i.e., part of the adversarial example can also achieve the attack. In 2019, Zhang et al. proposed a vehicle body painting method of black box adversarial example based on transition models so that the example vehicle could not be identified by autonomous driving vehicle detection system. In 2020, Wu et al.[ref]135 proposed the discrete searching algorithm to efficiently generate adversarial patches, and then proposed the Enlarge-and-Repeat (ER) algorithm to extend the adversarial patches to the whole body using body images collected from all angles. Both are with pretty good adversarial results. The following highlights the key algorithms in the physical world adversarial example enhancement described above. Algorithm1. Expectation over Transformation (EoT)  The core idea of the EoT algorithm is to add a certain random perturbation to each iteration of the adversarial example generation process, so that the final generated adversarial example has better robustness, with specific transformations including: projecting, rotation, and scaling. In the formula, the operation Mt​(xb,xo)subscript𝑀𝑡subscript𝑥𝑏subscript𝑥𝑜M_{t}(x_{b},x_{o}) is defined to project the target image xosubscript𝑥𝑜x_{o} onto the background image xbsubscript𝑥𝑏x_{b} through some transformation t𝑡t, and then the EoT is optimized as follows. where X𝑋X denote the training set of background images, and F𝐹F denote the target network. Algorithm2. Adversarial Patch  Based on the EoT transform, the attacker could generate an adversarial patch p^^𝑝\\hat{p} which the image with the this adversarial patch attacked by adversarial examples. The adversarial patch can be any shape, transformed by EoT methods such as random projecting, rotation, and scaling, and then generated by optimization methods such as gradient descent. An adversarial patch generation task A​(p,x,l,t)𝐴𝑝𝑥𝑙𝑡A(p,x,l,t) can be formally described as: for any particular x∈ℝw×h×c𝑥superscriptℝ𝑤ℎ𝑐x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{w\\times\\ h\\times c} to generate adversarial patch p𝑝p through the EoT transformation t𝑡t at position l𝑙l, then the adversarial path p𝑝p is continuously optimized by the following optimization algorithm: where X𝑋X denotes the training set of background images, T𝑇T denotes the distribution of the EoT transform used by the patch, and L𝐿L denotes the distribution of the locations of the adversarial patches. Algorithm3. Feature-inference Reinforcement[ref]133 Adversarial example generation algorithms often require an objective function, or called it as loss function, designed to minimize the difference between the predicted and expected values of a deep learning model. The neural network extracts features of the objects in the image and makes classification predictions based on these extracted features. The researchers found that generating adversarial examples with perturbations further forward in the hidden layer in the neural network would make the adversarial examples more robust. The core idea of the FIR algorithm is therefore to minimize the difference between the feature images of the layers of the adversarial examples and the normal examples, except for the use of the adversarial examples to mislead the prediction results of the neural network. First, attacker obtain the feature images Qnsubscript𝑄𝑛Q_{n} and Qn′subscriptsuperscript𝑄′𝑛Q^{\\prime}_{n} generated by each hidden layer of the neural network for corresponding categories y𝑦y and y′superscript𝑦′y^{\\prime}. Next, generate the feature vectors v𝑣v with v′superscript𝑣′v^{\\prime} from the feature images Qnsubscript𝑄𝑛Q_{n} and Qn′subscriptsuperscript𝑄′𝑛Q^{\\prime}_{n}. Finally, attacker optimize with the a composited loss function until convergence, then return the adversarial example. Such a vector loss can be defined as L​o​s​sf=∑|v−v′|𝐿𝑜𝑠subscript𝑠𝑓𝑣superscript𝑣′Loss_{f}=\\sum\\left|v-v^{\\prime}\\right|. The FIR algorithm can be described formally as follows. where CNb​o​xsuperscriptsubscript𝐶𝑁𝑏𝑜𝑥C_{N}^{box} denotes the confidence level of the target detection system for the target area; yNsuperscript𝑦𝑁y^{N} denotes the confidence level that example x𝑥x is judged by the neural network to be class N𝑁N; S𝑆S denotes the distribution space of confidence levels; l​o​s​sf𝑙𝑜𝑠subscript𝑠𝑓loss_{f} denotes the vector loss; α𝛼\\alpha, β𝛽\\beta and c𝑐c are three constants representing the weights respectively. Algorithm4. Nested adversarial examples (Nested-AE)[ref]133 Most objective detectors were designed to use multi-scales, each works better at different distances individually. It means that at different distances, different scales play different roles. In order to make the generated adversarial examples achieve adversarial effects over a large distance range and multiple angles, the Nested-AE algorithm considers many scales for different distances and angles to generate many adversarial patches. Then Nested-AE obtained the adversarial patches to synthesize an adversarial example. Thus nested adversarial examples are more adapted to the environment of vehicle movement in autonomous driving, which can achieve the purpose of a continuous adversary effect on the objective detection system. The nested adversarial examples could be formally described as where Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} denotes the original example, Xi+1a​d​vsubscriptsuperscript𝑋𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑖1X^{adv}_{i+1} denotes the example with adversarial perturbation, J​()𝐽J() represents the gradient of input Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} and C​l​i​p​()𝐶𝑙𝑖𝑝Clip() refers to regularize the input to the  550255 55 interval. If the adversarial example size Spsubscript𝑆𝑝S_{p} is less than or equal to the threshold St​h​r​e​ssubscript𝑆𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠S_{thres} , then it is considered a long-range adversarial attack at that point and the whole will be perturbed ; otherwise it is a close-range attack and only the central region will be perturbed. This decomposes the adversarial attack at different distances into two sub-tasks, which are perturbed and optimized separately. The objective detection systems usually divides each video frame into a grid that consisted of m×n𝑚𝑛m\\times n boxes. Base on the prediction of each box, attacker could find the decisive box for each scales, and then add the adversarial perturbation in this box. As the predicted output is usually tensors, there are only need the tensor of the index where the adversarial example is located. Therefore, it can calculate the index by the size of the example and the position of the centre region, so that we can get the tensor representing the example region, which is denoted as Npsubscript𝑁𝑝N_{p}. Then Npsubscript𝑁𝑝N_{p} needs to be calculated in each video frame. The nested adversarial example algorithm can be optimized using the following loss function.\n\nReference markers found: [124]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]124: high confidence.
