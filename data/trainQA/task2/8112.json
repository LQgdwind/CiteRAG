      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPebble games are used to capture various aspects of computing. For instance, the standard (black) pebble game   models general time-memory trade-offs, with results on achievable trade-offs [ref]18   and the complexity of computing pebbling strategies    . Hong and Kung¬† introduce the red-blue pebble game to study I/O complexity, and derive lower bounds based on a DAG partition technique. It is applied to specific computations in  8.\nFurther bounds on I/O costs were derived with different methods in [ref]19  .\nOther works¬†  [ref]12 extend the red-blue pebble game to\nsingle and multiple processors over memory hierarchies.\nKwasniewski et al.¬†0 1 refine the technique of  and derive improved I/O lower bounds for special DAGs. The bounds are extended to a multiprocessor settings where the workload is perfectly balanced.\nIn contrast to MPP,\nthese works do not consider\ntrade-offs between computation and I/O. As for the complexity of computing optimal pebbling strategies, Demaine and Liu¬† show that standard red-blue pebbling is PSPACE-complete, and propose variations that are shown NP-complete.\nNP-hardness for red-blue pebbling with computation costs is also shown in¬†. The work of¬†5 shows an inapproximability to a (2‚àíŒµ)2ùúÄ(2-\\varepsilon) factor, assuming the unique games conjecture. The work of¬† presents a bi-criteria approximation for the optimal I/O cost to a poly‚Å°log‚Å°(n)polyùëõ\\operatorname{poly}\\log(n) factor, provided that it is allowed to violate the memory bound by a poly‚Å°log‚Å°(n)polyùëõ\\operatorname{poly}\\log(n) factor. Naturally, there are also several more realistic models that capture both parallelization and memory limitations, but these exhibit key differences from MPP. The work of   studies the cost components (computation, different kinds of I/O) separately, mostly assuming that I/O steps cannot be parallelized.\nOther works assume simpler models regarding computation costs: they are not considered at all in , and are handled with artificial balance constraints in 4 .\nMoreover, these models are primarily used for studying specific computations (e.g., Matrix multiplication, FFT) rather than arbitrary DAGs. Valiant¬†7 introduces the bulk-synchronous parallel (BSP) computing model with explicit synchronisation, which was extended later¬†5 4 to include data locality and communication via shared memory. The model was further generalized to capture multi-processor/core architectures with multi-level memory¬†8. These models describe practical compute systems more closely, and also match our MPP model. There are also theoretical studies on DAG scheduling in BSP 6, but without memory restrictions.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: Pebble games are used to capture various aspects of computing.
