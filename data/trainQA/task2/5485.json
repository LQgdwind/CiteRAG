Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Unsupervised pre-training methods for code also attracted wide attention and have achieved impressive performance on many downstream tasks. CodeBERT  and GraphCodeBERT  are encoder-only models that are based on BERT . PLBART  is pre-trained as a generative denoising autoencoder based on BART 5.\nDOBF is a deobfuscation-based pre-train model 2. It designs a deobfuscation pre-training objective, which adds noise based on the code structure. Specifically, it obfuscates code snippets by replacing names of classes, functions, and variables with special symbols, and trains their model to recover their initial names. DOBF outperforms GraphCodeBERT on multiple code-related tasks.\nCodeT5  is an encoder-decoder architecture based on T5 , which proposes two code semantic aware pre-training objectives. It achieves advanced performance at both code understanding and generation tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: In recent years, deep learning technologies have been widely used software engineering tasks, such as code completion  [ref]34, code summarization [ref]17 [ref]1, code search  , bug detection and repair  .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
