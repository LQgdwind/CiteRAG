      "content": "Paper Title: Dyn-Backdoor: Backdoor Attack on Dynamic Link Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraphs are usually used to describe complex systems , , [ref]3 in various fields, such as social networks , , biological networks , electric systems , economics , neural networks , etc. In practice, most of these systems are evolving with time, which can be modeled as dynamic networks with nodes or links appearing and disappearing over time 0, 1. For instance, the purchases among users and items in e-commerce platforms, e.g. Taobao, Amazon, are updated in real-time. To predict the next time\npurchase behavior in the e-commerce platform can be defined as a link prediction on dynamic networks. Specifically, dynamic link prediction (DLP) tries to predict the existence of links at a certain time in the future based on the historical information of the network, which helps to better understand the evolving pattern of the network 2. Taking the e-commerce platform as an example, it will make targeted product recommendation benefiting from the DLP on basis of the users’ historical purchase records. Numerous DLP methods have been proposed. For example, Yao et al. 3 redefined the indicators for link prediction to extend them from static networks to dynamic ones, i.e., redefining common neighbor based on timestamps with different weights. Zhang et al. 4 used the improved resource allocation for DLP by recalculating the updated part of the graph rather than the entire graph. For random walk based approaches 5, 6, 7, 8, they can reduce the complexity of the model, since they usually take a walk of the local structure.\nWith the success of deep learning applied to computer vision, DLP methods based on deep learning 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 are thoroughly studied. They mainly use the nonlinear and hierarchical nature of neural networks to capture the evolving pattern of dynamic networks. In particular, the experiments in research 2, 5 demonstrate that DLP methods based on deep learning generally outperform the non-deep ones. Besides of the performance study on DLP, its robustness has also raised our concerns. Research has revealed the vulnerability of DLP methods towards adversarial attacks 6, 7, which are designed to deceive the model by carefully crafted adversarial samples in the testing stage. Moreover, the training stage is quite important to construct an effective DLP model, since most deep models are highly dependent on the quality and quantity of the training samples.\nIn other word, DLP methods generally rely on clean training data with correct labels to guarantee the high prediction accuracy. In practice, the collection and labeling of training data are usually implemented in the form of crawlers, logs, crowdsourcing, etc. It is inevitable that the training data will be polluted with noises, or even injected with predefined triggers by a malicious collector. Consequently, backdoor attack on DLP, defined as generating a trigger pre-injected in the training sequence to make the target link state in the test sequence as the attacker-chosen state, will be a serious security threat. For better understanding, we illustrate the backdoor attack on DLP in Fig. 1. In the training stage, the backdoor attack mixes some of the clean training data with carefully crafted trigger sequence for the DLP model, to achieve a backdoored model. In the testing stage, the backdoored model will make the target link predicted as the attack-chosen state when fed by the backdoored sequence, i.e., sequence with triggers, while still maintaining high prediction accuracy on clean ones.\nFor instance, e-commerce platforms recommend product of interest to customers using DLP method. If the collected training data have been injected with trigger to leave a backdoor in the DLP, the platform will make the targeted product recommended purposely, i.e., not suitable but profitable. Aiming at graph classification and node classification of static networks, backdoor attacks have been studied 8 9, .\nHowever, they are not suitable for target link backdoor attack on DLP for reasons. On one hand, graph classification is implemented on basis of global graph structure corresponding to the graph label, while link prediction is accomplished based on the local structure strongly related to the target link. The global feature shifting may not influence the target link or node. On the other hand, considering the dynamic evolution characteristics of DLP, the static trigger is usually not the optimum to capture the evolving pattern of dynamic networks. To address these problems, we propose a novel backdoor attack framework towards DLP, based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) , namely Dyn-Backdoor.\nSpecifically, we use the initial-triggers to replace the graph structure directly related to the target link when the target link state is chosen as the attacker’s manipulated goal. The initial-triggers are derived from the input noise of the trigger generator. Then, we consider the concealment of the attack, the initial-triggers extract important links through the gradient to form triggers. The triggers are optimized through competition between the trigger generator and the attack discriminator. Addressing to the dynamic characteristics issue, we capture the dynamic feature based on the trigger generator composed of the long short-term memory (LSTM) . Empirically, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on four real-world datasets and five DLP methods, compared with several possible baselines, i.e., gradient information based attack and random attack. Additionally, we propose a possible defense against Dyn-Backdoor, and the experiments testify that it can still achieve an attack success rate of more than 90% under defensive settings. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: \n\n∙∙\\bullet\n To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that formulates the problem of backdoor attack on DLP, which reveals the vulnerability of DLP algorithms in big data collection for training. \n\n∙∙\\bullet\n To address the backdoor attack on DLP, we propose an effective framework, named Dyn-Backdoor. It utilizes GAN to generate a number of diverse initial-triggers, and further selects important links to generate an optimal trigger for backdoor attack. Moreover, we analyze the feasibility of backdoor attack. \n\n∙∙\\bullet\n Extensive experiments on five DLP methods over four real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that Dyn-Backdoor can attack state-of-the-art DLP methods with success rate of more than 90%. Moreover, the experiments testify that Dyn-Backdoor is effective against possible defense strategy as well. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Related works are introduced in Section II. The problem definition and threat model are described in Section III, while the proposed method is detailed in Section IV. Experiment results and discussion are showed in Section V. Finally, we conclude our work.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Graphs are usually used to describe complex systems , , [ref]3 in various fields, such as social networks , , biological networks , electric systems , economics , neural networks , etc. In practice, most of these systems are evolving with time, which can\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
