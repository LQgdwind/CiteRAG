However, prior knowledge of all possible object classes is not possible for some applications, including robotics . To address this, [ref]3 introduced open-set recognition, where a network can also encounter previously unseen, ‘unknown’, classes during the testing phase. In open-set classification, epistemic uncertainty has been obtained by measuring distance in a classifier’s logit space    [ref]9. This approach assumes that known object classes form clusters and unknown classes will be distinct from these clusters – an input’s distance to each class cluster represents uncertainty. In previous work, we showed that training a classifier with a clustering loss improves distance-based uncertainty for open-set classification [ref]9. This technique has not been explored in object detection, and assumed simple structures in the logit space, with one spherical cluster per class. Despite a large body of work in open-set classification (see this survey ), only a few works explore the more complex task of open-set object detection   . In previous work, we used MC Dropout to extract epistemic uncertainty from a Single Shot MultiBox Detector for open-set conditions  [ref]6. Using MC Dropout with a Faster R-CNN detector,  conversely found MC Dropout decremented performance in an open-set environment Dhamija et al.  identified a limitation with existing evaluation protocols for open-set object detection. Object detection datasets include a ‘background’ class, which features non-target objects, surfaces and scenery, and represent the data the detector learns to ignore. Current open-set detection evaluation protocols [ref]6  do not distinguish between ‘known unknown’ detections, where the detector encountered the object as part of the background class, and true ‘unknown’ open-set detections. We address this by proposing a method for adapting existing detection datasets to allow for the explicit evaluation of open-set errors.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Standard classifiers and detectors are trained and evaluated in a closed-set manner: they train and test on a single set of ‘known’ object classes [ref]3.
