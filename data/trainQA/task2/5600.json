      "content": "Paper Title: Performance Limits of a Deep Learning-Enabled Text Semantic Communication under Interference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIntroduced by Weaver [1, Ch. 1] around 1949, semantic communication (SemCom) is a communications paradigm whose purpose is to convey a transmitter’s intended meaning to a receiver  . When it comes to the receiver’s interpretations deduced from its recovered messages, SemCom aims to minimize their divergence from the meaning of the transmitted message . To this end, SemCom transmits semantic information that is only relevant to the communication goal, hence, significantly reducing data traffic [ref]5. SemCom’s ability to significantly reduce traffic means it has the potential to change the status quo viewpoint of the conventional communications systems’ designers that wireless connectivity is an opaque data pipe that carries messages whose context-dependent meaning and effectiveness have been ignored . Furthermore, contrary to conventional communication systems that focus on providing high data rates and a low symbol (bit) error rate, SemCom extracts the meaning of the information in a transmitter’s message and interprets the semantic information at the receiver . To this end, SemCom focuses on a receiver’s interpretation of the information it receives: its principal objective is to deliver the source’s intended meaning considering its dependence on not only the physical content of the message but also the human users’ intentions and other humanistic factors (i.e., subjectivity) that could reflect the real quality of experience . Thus, a SemCom system would be designed to successfully deliver the transmitted message’s representative meaning . SemCom takes a meaning-centric approach to communications system design and emphasizes conveying a transmitted message’s interpretation in lieu of reproducing the message through a symbol-by-symbol reconstruction [ref]9. Consequently, SemCom’s meaning-centric approach to communications has made it emerge as a 6G (sixth generation)    technology enabler. As such, SemCom holds the promise of minimizing power usage, bandwidth consumption, and transmission delay by minimizing irrelevant information transmission. The transmission of irrelevant information is discarded by using efficient semantic extraction – based on a joint semantic encoding and decoding process  – that can be efficiently executed by leveraging state-of-the-art advancements of deep learning (DL) [ref]5. Advancements in DL  and natural language processing  have propelled the application of SemCom and semantic-aware communications to text transmission [ref]5; image transmission ; video transmission ; audio transmission ; and visual question answering tasks . These applications, however, can be made ineffective by considerable semantic noise. Semantic noise causes semantic information misunderstanding, which is the manifestation of semantic decoding errors, causing a misunderstanding between a transmitter’s intended meaning and a receiver’s reconstructed meaning [ref]18. In this vein, semantic noise can arise in semantic decoding, data transmission, and/or semantic encoding. In the semantic encoding stage, semantic noise can occur due to a mismatch between the original signal and semantically encoded signal [ref]18 and due to adversarial examples [ref]18. Semantic noise can also happen during data transmission because of physical noise, signal distortion due to channel fading, or interference at a receiver [ref]18 . At a receiver, semantic noise can appear during semantic decoding in case of different message interpretations due to ambiguity in the words, sentences, or symbols used in the transmitted messages ; semantic ambiguity (due to dialect and polysemy) in the recovered symbols when a semantic symbol represents multiple sets of data with dissimilar meanings ; and a mismatch between the source knowledge base and the destination knowledge base (even in the absence of syntactic errors) . Furthermore, there may be a huge amount of semantic noise during semantic decoding due to a malicious attacker emitting interference [ref]18. Among many factors that can cause semantic noise, radio frequency interference (RFI) is a major culprit. As a major culprit, huge RFI causes substantial noise to a SemCom receiver whose channel decoder’s unreliable outputs evoke significant semantic noise to the semantic decoder. Despite the semantic decoder’s vulnerability to RFI, a few existing SemCom works have empirically investigated the impact of RFI/interference on the reliability of a SemCom receiver. Among these works, the authors of [ref]18 develop an adversarial training algorithm to combat semantic noise due to a jammer and the authors of 0 demonstrate empirically that a wireless attack using RFI can change the semantics of the transmitted information. None of these works, however, quantifies the impact of RFI on the performance of a SemCom system. On the other hand, the performance of any SemCom technique has not been quantified – to the best of our knowledge – to date. Such limitations of the state-of-the-art SemCom works motivate this paper. The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of the fundamental performance limits of DeepSC [5, Fig. 2] – a wireless text SemCom technique – under RFI and multi-interferer RFI (MI RFI). Particularly, we study a semantic decoder’s output (i.e., the recovered meaning) in the presence of RFI to determine the performance limits of a text SemCom system experiencing RFI. RFI is generally caused by intentional or unintentional interferers and is being encountered increasingly in satellite communications, microwave radiometry, radio astronomy, ultra-wideband communication systems, radar systems, and cognitive radio communication systems 1 2 3. Consequently, SemCom systems of the near future will also be impacted by RFI from jammers, spoofers, meaconers, and inter-cell interferers. These RFI emitters – in view of an adversarial electronic warfare possibility in the contemporary age – must be taken into account to ensure the design of a fundamentally robust and faithful SemCom system. Such a system must be able to deliver reliable SemCom regardless of impinging RFI. To stimulate this type of system design, we aim to quantify DeepSC’s performance limits [ref]5. The asymptotic/non-asymptotic performance quantification of a DL-enabled SemCom system like DeepSC [5, Fig. 2] is not addressed in any state-of-the-art works and is fundamentally challenging for the following reasons: 1)1) the fundamental lack of interpretability in DL models concerning optimization, generalization, and approximation 4; 2)2) the lack of a commonly agreed-upon definition of semantics/semantic information [25, Ch. 10, p. 125]; and 3)3) the absence of a comprehensive mathematical foundation of SemCom 6. These challenges are partially overcome through the following key contributions: We introduce a principled probabilistic framework to alleviate the mathematical intractability of the performance analysis of SemCom systems by introducing a new SemCom metric. We use our principled probabilistic framework to reveal the asymptotic performance limits of DeepSC under RFI and MI RFI. We derive DeepSC’s practical limits and a lower bound on its outage probability under MI RFI. Toward a fundamental 6G design for an interference-resistant and robust SemCom (IR2 SemCom), we propose a generic lifelong DL-based IR2 SemCom system. We corroborate the derived performance limits with Monte Carlo simulations and computer experiments. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II outlines the system description and problem formulation. Section III reports the performance limits of DeepSC. Section IVreports on DeepSC’s practical limits and outage probability. Section V proposes a generic lifelong DL-based IR2 SemComsystem toward IR2 6G wireless systems. Section VI presents corroborating simulation and computer experiment results.
