Towards that aim, Greuter et al.  managed to generate “pseudo infinite” virtual cities in real-time via simple constructive methods. Johnson et al.  used cellular automata to generate infinite cave levels in real-time. In , the model named polymorph was proposed for dynamic difficulty adjustment during the generation of levels. Stammer et al.  generated personalised and difficulty adjusted levels in the 2D platformer Spelunky (Mossmouth, LLC, 2008) while Shaker et al. formed the basis of the experience-driven PCG framework [ref]7 by generating personalised platformer levels online . Shi and Chen  combined rule-based and learning-based methods to generate online level segments of high quality, called constructive primitives (CPs).\nIn the work of , a dynamic difficulty adjustment algorithm with Thompson Sampling  was proposed to combine these CPs.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Stammer et al.  generated personalised and difficulty adjusted levels in the 2D platformer Spelunky (Mossmouth, LLC, 2008) while Shaker et al. formed the basis of the experience-driven PCG framework [ref]7 by generating personalised platformer levels online .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
