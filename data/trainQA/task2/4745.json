      "content": "Paper Title: Optimistic MLE—A Generic Model-based Algorithm for Partially Observable Sequential Decision Making\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA wide range of modern artificial intelligence applications can be cast as sequential decision making problems, in which an agent interacts with an unknown environment through time, and learns to make a sequence of decisions using intermediate feedback. Sequential decision making covers not only problems like Atari games , Go , Chess [ref]9 and basic control systems , where states are fully accessible to the learner (the fully observable setting), but also applications including StarCraft , Poker [ref]7, robotics with local sensors , autonomous driving  and medical diagnostic systems , where observations only reveal partial information about the underlying states (the partially observable setting). While the fully observable sequential decision making problems have been under intense theoretical investigation over recent years,\nthe partially observable problems remain comparatively less understood. Distinguished from fully observable systems, a learner in partially observable systems is only able to see the observations that contain partial information about the underlying states. Observations in general are no longer Markovian. As a result, it is no longer sufficient for the learner to make decision based on the observation or information available at the current step. Instead, the learner is required to additionally infer the latent states using past histories (memories). Such histories of observations have exponentially many possibilities, leading to many well-known hardness results in the worst case in both computation   [ref]51  and statistics . To avoid these worst-case barriers, a recent line of results started to investigate rich subclasses of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDPs) under the basic settings of finite states and observations [see, e.g., 27, 36], which still only constitute a relatively small subset of all partially observable problems of practical interests. In this paper, we introduce a simple, generic, model-based algorithm—OMLE, which combines Optimism (O) for exploration with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for model estimation. We prove that OMLE learns the near-optimal policies of an enormously rich class of sequential decision making problems in a polynomial number of samples. This rich class includes not only a majority of known tractable model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems such as tabular MDPs, factored MDPs, low witness rank problems , tabular weakly-revealing/observable POMDPs   and multi-step decodable POMDPs 4, but also, more importantly, many new challenging RL problems especially in the partially observable setting that were not previously known to be tractable (see Section 1.1). To achieve these new results, this paper develops new frameworks and techniques which address a set of fundamental challenges that are uniquely presented in the partially observable systems: Modern applications of sequential decision making often involve an enormous (or even infinite) number of observations, where function approximation must be deployed to approximate dynamic models, value functions, or policies. While function approximation greatly expands the potential reach of existing frameworks, particularly via deep architectures, it raises a number of fundamental questions including generalization, model misspecification, and how to address those issues in presence of exploration. Function approximation becomes even more complicated in the partially observable setting when further coupled with the inference of latent states and the use of history dependent policies. As a result, existing results on function approximation in the partially observable setting remain very limited  . They make rather restrictive assumptions, and do not provide efficient guarantees even to a relatively simple continuous-observation extension of the basic tabular weakly-revealing or observable POMDPs 8 —GM-POMDPs (Section 5.1.2), which only add Gaussian noise to the observations in the original models. Most existing works on efficient learning of partially observable problems focus on the model of POMDPs. POMDPs are based on latent states that are unobservable and subject to non-trivial ambiguity—there can exist multiple different POMDPs that represent the same sequential decision making problem. This ambiguity directly leads to the unidentifiability of latent states even in the benign settings where learning near-optimal policy is possible. This paper considers a more intrinsic modeling of partially observable dynamic system—Predictive State Representations (PSRs)  , which model a dynamic system using only observable experiments of futures. It is known that PSRs can represent any low-rank sequential decision making problems, which are more expressive than finite-state POMDPs . However, it remains unclear how to learn large class of PSRs sample-efficiently. There has been a long line of important works on generic framework of reinforcement learning    3 5. However, most of them focus on the fully observable problems and are only capable of dealing with very special partially observable problems such as reactive POMDPs. A majority of them critically rely on the complexity measures that are based on Bellman rank  or witness rank  (the model-based version), which assumes the Bellman error or the model estimation error (in the model-based setting) to have a bilinear structure.\nThese bilinear-based complexity measures completely fail to explain the tractability of many basic partially observable problems 8  4. It remains open to develop a unified theoretical framework which explain large classes of both fully observable and partially observable problems. This work addresses all three challenges above.\nFor Challenge 1, we prove that OMLE learns observable POMDPs with continuous observation and function approximation, where we achieve the first sample complexity that is completely independent of the size of observation space. For Challenge 2, we show that OMLE learns well-conditioned PSRs, which include and generalize all known tractable POMDP examples under a more intrinsic representation; For Challenge 3, we identify a new condition—Summation of Absolute values of Independent biLinear\nfunctions (SAIL)—which can be viewed as a natural generalization of Bellman/witness rank to address partial observability. We prove that OMLE learns general sequential decision making problems under SAIL condition, which include all problems considered in this paper, and unify our existing understanding for model-based RL in both fully observable and partially observable settings.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: with an unknown environment through time, and learns to make a sequence of decisions using intermediate feedback.
