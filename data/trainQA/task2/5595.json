      "content": "Paper Title: Can We Use Diffusion Probabilistic Models for 3D Motion Prediction?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeterministic Models.\nThe goal of deterministic 3D motion prediction is to minimize the distance between a predicted motion and ground truth.\nTo solve this problem, early works relying on deep neural networks    often employed recurrent neural networks (RNNs)  , which are still well-known for their effectiveness in processing time-series data.\nAmong RNN-based works, a notable model is a structure RNN (S-RNN) , which considers the spatio-temporal information of human motion, by manually designing the high-level spatio-temporal graph to explicitly model the human body structure (i.e., spine, arm, and leg). While S-RNN understands the human body structure based on the handcrafted network structure, there is another line of research   that uses graph convolutional network (GCN) to overcome this manually designed spatial relationship understanding. For instance,  suggested a model named DCT-GCN, where discrete cosine transform (DCT) understands the temporal information of motion, and GCN learns the spatial relationship between human body joints. DCT-GCN obtains the state-of-the-art result when evaluated on Euler-angle-based mean squared error, but its best result can be obtained when the model is separately trained for each short- or long-term prediction. Recently, several works for deterministic motion prediction   are based on the Transformer , which was originally suggested for language understanding problems.\nModels named Spatio-Temporal Transformer (ST-TR)  and 2-Channel Transformer (2CH-TR) , understand the spatio-temporal relationship of human motion by putting the self-attention mechanism on each pose-parameter (spatial) and time (temporal) dimension.\nAfter understanding each spatial and temporal information in parallel, outputs from both attention mechanisms are properly combined. The difference between ST-TR and 2CH-TR comes from when and how often the model combines spatial and temporal information. Generative Models.\nThe goal of stochastic 3D motion prediction is to build a generative model which can sample out several future motions that are likely to happen after the observed human motion.\nTo solve this problem, early works [ref]16 [ref]17 employed deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs)  or generative adversarial networks (GANs) .\nFor instance, [ref]17 suggested a generative model based on the conditional VAEs, and showed that VAEs can sample out several future motions that are reasonable as well as diverse.\nCompared to VAE, [ref]16 showed that GANs based on the Wasserstein loss function can be effectively used in stochastic motion prediction tasks. While these works [ref]16 [ref]17 focused on exploring the potential of using deep generative models in stochastic motion prediction tasks, another line of works  [ref]19 focused on sampling out as much as diverse motions that can contain the most plausible motion at the same time.\nFor instance,  proposed to train a post-hoc model which can be attached to the pre-trained deep generative model. This post-hoc model maps a random variable to several latent vectors of the pre-trained generative model.\nBased on the diversity-promoting prior, the post-hoc model is trained to improve the diversity between samples, which can be obtained by decoding the mapped latent vectors. Experiments in  [ref]19 evaluate the likelihood of prediction samples based on the minimum distance between the samples and the ground truth(s).\nThey denote the prediction samples as plausible based on the sample that is closest to the ground truth(s).\nHowever, this can make it difficult for users to choose the most plausible motion among the prediction samples, since all samples will not be distributed near the most plausible motion.\nFor instance, if the observed motion is a human sitting down and drinking something,  and [ref]19 can produce motion samples that predict the human suddenly standing up and starting discussing something with others.\nAs  has pointed out, we would like to also focus on the necessity of contextually plausible and diverse motion sampling. Therefore, our paper would evaluate the likelihood of prediction also based on the mean and standard deviation of distances between the samples and ground truth.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: 3D motion prediction is to build a generative model which can sample out several future motions that are likely to happen after the observed human motion.\nTo solve this problem, early works [ref]16 [ref]17 employed deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs)  or generative adversarial networks (GANs) .\nFor instance, [ref]17 suggested a generative model based on the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
