      "content": "Paper Title: MCTS with Refinement for Proposals Selection Games in Scene Understanding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nScene understanding from images is one of the main topics in computer vision, as it aims both at replicating one of the key abilities of human beings and producing solutions for many applications such as robotics or augmented reality. We focus in this work on tasks that are relevant in for the field of Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC). Namely, we consider two tasks where we achieve state-of-the-art performance: floor plan reconstruction, where each room of an indoor environment is represented as a polygon with one edge per wall, and 3D room layout reconstruction, where each wall of a single room is modelled as a 3D planar polygon. This work extends our original work [ref]1 on floor plan estimation with additional experiments that show generalization of our method to the 3D room layout estimation task. While we focus in this work on floor plan reconstruction and room layout reconstruction, our approach is general and is applicable to other tasks in scene understanding. We formulate a ”proposals selection game” as a family of tasks in scene understanding where our approach can be applied. Our main component is generic: We start from proposals for the target objects (the rooms or the walls in our applications). This step does not have to perform well to obtain good final results as our Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based algorithm can deal with many false positives. This algorithm looks for the final solution by maximizing a data-driven score, which can thus be easily replaced to adapt to another problem. During the search our algorithm refines sampled solutions hence performing the discrete and continuous optimization jointly. In our main application we focus on reconstructing floor plans from unstructured 3D point clouds as in  [ref]3  , as they can now be generated easily with an RGB-D camera and can cover an entire floor. To estimate the floor plan from a given point cloud, [ref]3  proposes to first project the point cloud into a virtual top view to create a ’density map’, as the walls, the main features for creating the floor map, appear relatively clearly in the density map. As shown in Figure 1, the density maps can be noisy, and it is still challenging to represent the rooms as vector drawings with a minimal number of edges as a human designer would do, especially for non-Manhattan floor maps. To deal with this complexity, Floor-SP [ref]3 proposes a graph-based solution with a sound energy term but still assumes the existence of some dominant wall directions in the scene. Our main contribution is a method, which we call MonteFloor, that is conceptually simple and robust and returns high-quality floor plans. Figure 1 shows an example from the Floor-SP test set that demonstrates we can reconstruct complex floor maps, including very large ones with complex room shapes without having to tune hyper-parameters. Like Floor-SP[ref]3, our method starts from room proposals generated by Mask-RCNN  from the density map. However, the way we handle these room proposals is fundamentally different from [ref]3. Where [ref]3 adjusts the room walls and corners in a greedy fashion, we select the correct room proposals jointly while adjusting their locations and shapes, guided by a learned scoring function. This is possible thanks to two main contributions. Our first contribution is based on the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm  . MCTS is a stochastic algorithm that efficiently explores search trees and has been used for example in AlphaGo and AlphaZero to select moves when playing Go or other games with high combinatorials . We use it to search among the room proposals for the ones actually belonging to the correct floor plan. In our case, a move corresponds to the selection of a room proposal. In contrast with other tree search algorithms, MCTS is based only on the evaluations of leaves. This means that we can select a set of proposals based on how well they explain the density map together. After evaluating a leaf, MCTS updates a score in the visited nodes, which will be used to guide the next tree explorations. To evaluate how well a set of proposals explains an input density map, we introduce an objective term that combines a ’metric score’ predicted by a deep network and regularization terms. This network takes as input the density map and an image of the selected proposals to predict the Intersection-over-Union between the selected proposals and the ground truth. The regularization terms encourage the selected room proposals to be in contact with each other without overlapping, and angles close to 90°°\\degree to be exactly 90°°\\degree—note this is different from enforcing Manhattan World conditions as other angles are also accepted. Moreover, to adapt MCTS and obtain accurate floor plan estimates, we extended it by adding a refinement step before evaluating the objective function. The step performs an optimization of the objective function and adjusts the shapes of the selected room proposals to better fit the density map. This is made possible by our second contribution, which is a novel differentiable method to optimize the shapes of 2D polygons. Note that very recently,  has also used MCTS for a scene understanding problem. However, it proposes a straightforward application of MCTS. By contrast, we rely on a learned objective function suitable to our problem, and we introduce an optimization step to obtain accurate estimates. To evaluate our method and compare it with Floor-SP [ref]3, which is the state-of-the-art for our problem, we first perform experiments on the Structured3D dataset  that contains a variety of complex layout configurations. We show significant improvements regarding both the accuracy and time complexity over Floor-SP (after retraining their method on Structured3D). As the authors of Floor-SP could not provide the training set for their method, we could not re-train our network for predicting the metric specifically for this dataset, and we had to use the one trained on Structured3D. Despite this domain gap, we achieve better performance on the Floor-SP test set without imposing any hard constraints nor assumptions on the floor plan configurations. Extending MCTS with refinement to 3D room layout reconstruction. To demonstrate the generalization aspect of our method, we additionally implement our MCTS with refinement scheme for the 3D room layout reconstruction task where the goal is to retrieve correct extents of layout components, such as walls, floors, and ceilings, from an input color image. While many works assume cuboid constraints   , we build our approach upon Stekovic et al.  [ref]15 that only assumes planarity of layout components. As in [ref]15, we start by generating a large pool of planar polygon proposals, and formulate a discrete optimization problem that looks for a subset in this pool that minimizes our objective term. Instead of simply performing an exhaustive search, we apply our MCTS with refinement scheme to reconstruct room layouts of high quality and reduce search and refinement efforts. We call the resulting method MonteRoom. Figure 1 shows a challenging example where our method reconstructs very accurate 3D room layout. We perform evaluation on the Matterport3D-Layout dataset  that contains a range of complex room layout configurations and demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art method GeoLayout  by a significant margin.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: is represented as a polygon with one edge per wall, and 3D room layout reconstruction, where each wall of a single room is modelled as a 3D planar polygon.
