      "content": "Paper Title: Link Prediction with Relational Hypergraphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge graphs: Transductive setup.\nThe task of link prediction on a knowledge graph has been studied extensively in the literature. The early knowledge graph embedding models such as TransE [ref]13 and RotatE [ref]14 are transductive.\nGNNs such as RGCN [ref]4 and CompGCN  are prominent examples of utilizing powerful message-passing on knowledge graphs. However, none of these models apply in the fully inductive setup, where new nodes are introduced during the test time. This is because they inherently compute an embedding for each seen entity in the training graph. Knowledge graphs: Inductive setup.\nGraIL  is the first model designed to be fully inductive by leveraging the idea of labeling trick .\nGraIL labels each node with the shortest path\ndistances to the source node and the target node in sampled subgraphs.\nHowever, such a method creates high computational complexity since in each forward pass, only one link score can be computed.\nZhu et¬†al.  proposed NBFNets, inspired by the Bellman-Ford algorithm, that allow the computation of |V|ùëâ|V| links at the same time by only labeling the source node. NBFNets subsume many previous path-based models like NeuralLP  and DRUM . These models fall under the framework of C-MPNNs  and are theoretically well-understood. Recently, A*Net  is designed to scale NBFNets with the usage of neural priority function, and Galkin et¬†al.  proposed ULTRA, a foundation model that is inductive on both new nodes and new relation types, based on NBFNets. The success of conditional message passing on knowledge graphs has motivated us to extend its application to relational hypergraphs. Relational hypergraphs: Transductive setup.\nThere is a line of work focusing on adapting knowledge graph embedding methods for relational hypergraphs by extending the scoring function to consider multiple entities. For example, m-TransH , is an extension of TransH  designed to handle multiple entities simultaneously. Similarly, GETD  builds on the bilinear embedding method TuckER . Fatemi et¬†al.  proposed HSimplE and HypE that disentangle the position and relation embedding. BoxE  models each relation in terms of box embeddings, and naturally applies to kùëòk-ary relations while achieving strong results on transductive benchmarks. In addition, Fatemi et¬†al.  drew a connection between relational algebra and relational hypergraph embedding and proposed ReAlE. Relational hypergraphs: Inductive setup.\nAs message-passing neural networks have shown great success in learning complex relational structures on graphs, Feng et¬†al.  and Yadati et¬†al.  leveraged message-passing methods on undirected hypergraphs. G-MPNN  is the first approach to specifically address multi-relational hypergraphs using message-passing. Building on this, RD-MPNNs  additionally incorporated the positional information of entities in their respective relations during message passing. They also explicitly keep track of the representations of the relation to better model the dynamics.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Knowledge graphs: Transductive setup.\nThe task of link prediction on a knowledge graph has been studied extensively in the literature.
