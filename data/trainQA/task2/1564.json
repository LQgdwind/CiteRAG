      "content": "Paper Title: A Bayesian Federated Learning Framework with Online Laplace Approximation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBy applying the Bayesian framework from , we can treat parameters learned on client n𝑛n as the expectation of the posterior p​(θ|𝒟n)𝑝conditional𝜃subscript𝒟𝑛p(\\theta|\\mathcal{D}_{n}), and use the inverse of the average Hessian matrix H¯nsubscript¯𝐻𝑛\\bar{H}_{n} of the negative log posterior over data samples to approximate the covariance.\nHowever, since the size of H¯nsubscript¯𝐻𝑛\\bar{H}_{n} is d×d𝑑𝑑d\\times d, where d𝑑d is the number of parameters, directly computing H¯nsubscript¯𝐻𝑛\\bar{H}_{n} has a time and storage complexity of O​(d×d)𝑂𝑑𝑑O(d\\times d) in one client.\nThus, we need to approximate H¯nsubscript¯𝐻𝑛\\bar{H}_{n} in a more efficient and practical way, as it is very expensive to calculate and store H¯nsubscript¯𝐻𝑛\\bar{H}_{n} directly.\nInspired by  [ref]16, we assume that the parameters in the covariance matrix are independent from each other.\nTherefore, we can approximate H¯nsubscript¯𝐻𝑛\\bar{H}_{n} using a diagonal matrix, thus decreasing the number of items in each covariance matrix from O​(d×d)𝑂𝑑𝑑O(d\\times d) to O​(d)𝑂𝑑O(d). In addition, the diagonal approximation makes it is easy to calculate the inverse of ΣnsubscriptΣ𝑛\\Sigma_{n} or Σn−1superscriptsubscriptΣ𝑛1\\Sigma_{n}^{-1} in Eq. 12 because finding the inverse of a diagonal matrix is the same as taking the reciprocal of its diagonal elements. Specifically, to calculate the covariance of p​(θ|𝒟n)𝑝conditional𝜃subscript𝒟𝑛p(\\theta|\\mathcal{D}_{n}), we utilize our own local training strategy PI to integrate both the likelihood function and the prior distribution p​(θ)𝑝𝜃p(\\theta).\nUsing the approach from  [ref]18, the likelihood function can be approximated by a second order regularization item Hnsubscript𝐻𝑛H_{n}, which is the average Hessian matrix of ℒTask=−ln⁡p​(𝒟n|θ)subscriptℒTask𝑝conditionalsubscript𝒟𝑛𝜃\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Task}}=-\\ln p\\left(\\mathcal{D}_{n}|\\theta\\right).\nTherefore, the posterior in Eq. 14 can be further decomposed into: However, calculating the second derivative directly is also computationally expensive.\nThus, we explore an empirical Fisher information matrix F¯¯𝐹\\bar{F}, which is a quadratic form for approximating the Hessian matrix.\nSuch an approximation has been successfully used for natural gradient optimization , which approximates the Hessian matrix for a mini-batch at each step to scale the gradient.\nSimilarly, for client n𝑛n with input x𝑥x and target y𝑦y, we use the empirical Fisher matrices F¯nsubscript¯𝐹𝑛\\bar{F}_{n} of each training round to approximate H¯nsubscript¯𝐻𝑛\\bar{H}_{n} by: Eq. 19 is computable. In order to reduce the storage overhead to O​(d)𝑂𝑑O(d), a diagonal matrix of 𝐇¯¯𝐇\\bar{\\mathbf{H}} can be estimated by the diagonal of empirical 𝐅𝐅\\mathbf{F}. Although some information is lost by the absence of non-diagonal elements , it is a common practice to use diagonal approximations for computational purposes  [ref]16 [ref]18   [ref]39 . We denote d​i​a​g​(⋅)𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔⋅{diag}(\\cdot) as the diagonal of a matrix. Storing and computing Eq. 20 for a neural network is efficient. It is equivalent to calculating the expectation of the square of the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters θ𝜃\\theta. Meanwhile, d​i​a​g​(𝐇¯)𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔¯𝐇{diag}(\\bar{\\mathbf{H}}) is easy to inverse, d​i​a​g​(𝐇¯)−1=1d​i​a​g​(𝐇¯)𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔superscript¯𝐇11𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔¯𝐇{diag}(\\bar{\\mathbf{H}})^{-1}=\\frac{1}{{diag}(\\bar{\\mathbf{H}})}. Therefore, we select the diagonal of the empirical Fisher information matrix d​i​a​g​(F¯)𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔¯𝐹diag(\\bar{F}) to approximate F¯¯𝐹\\bar{F}: where s​q​(⋅)𝑠𝑞⋅sq(\\cdot) denotes a coordinate-wise square. Nevertheless, as mentioned in , both F¯¯𝐹\\bar{F} and d​i​a​g​(F¯)𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔¯𝐹diag(\\bar{F}) are crude and biased approximations of H¯¯𝐻\\bar{H}, resulting in incorrect curvature of the posterior.\nFor example, when certain parameters with small variances in the posterior are optimal, methods [ref]39  applying the d​i​a​g​(F¯)𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔¯𝐹diag(\\bar{F}) approximation around the optimal parameter will overestimate their variances.\nThis is because the inverse of the variance obtained by Eq. 21 with ∇log⁡p​(y∣x,θ)≈0∇𝑝conditional𝑦𝑥𝜃0\\nabla\\log p(y\\mid x,\\theta)\\approx 0 around the optimal parameter is very small, leading to a large variance.\nPrevious works [ref]18  in the area of continuous learning have corrected this approximation error using an online approximation method.\nTo this end, s​q​(∇log⁡p​(y∣x,θ))𝑠𝑞∇𝑝conditional𝑦𝑥𝜃sq(\\nabla\\log p(y\\mid x,\\theta)) is accumulated over the entire optimization process to approximate H¯¯𝐻\\bar{H}, instead of using an offline method to calculate d​i​a​g​(F¯)𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔¯𝐹diag(\\bar{F}) around the optimal parameter θ∗superscript𝜃\\theta^{*} after the optimization.\nSimilarly, we use d​i​a​g​(F¯)n𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔subscript¯𝐹𝑛diag(\\bar{F})_{n} averaged over all optimization steps from the initial step t=1𝑡1t=1 to the final step t=T𝑡𝑇t=T during local training on clients to approximate H¯nsubscript¯𝐻𝑛\\bar{H}_{n}: After taking the second derivative of ln⁡p​(θ|𝒟n)𝑝conditional𝜃subscript𝒟𝑛\\ln p(\\theta|\\mathcal{D}_{n}), an online-evaluated local covariance Σn−1superscriptsubscriptΣ𝑛1\\Sigma_{n}^{-1} can be obtained by the sum of ΣS∗−1superscriptsubscriptΣ𝑆absent1\\Sigma_{S}^{*{-1}} and F¯nsubscript¯𝐹𝑛\\bar{F}_{n}: However, directly summing these will cause the covariance of the prior p​(θ)𝑝𝜃p(\\theta) of the next round to accumulate continuously, reducing the effect of the likelihood p​(𝒟n|θ)𝑝conditionalsubscript𝒟𝑛𝜃p(\\mathcal{D}_{n}|\\theta), which is also very important for local learning.\nIn order to balance their effects, we scale the covariances using the round index r𝑟r as: Furthermore, by applying Eq. 24 during the aggregation stage at round r=R𝑟𝑅r=R, we can obtain an online evaluated global covariance ΣS,RsubscriptΣ𝑆𝑅\\Sigma_{S,R}: where the initial prior pr=1​(θ)≈𝒩​(O,γ​I)subscript𝑝𝑟1𝜃𝒩𝑂𝛾𝐼p_{r=1}(\\theta)\\approx\\mathcal{N}(O,\\gamma I) is given with zero expectation and an identity covariance scaled by a constant γ𝛾\\gamma.\nEq. 25 can also be derived directly utilizing Laplace approximations and PI when approximating the global posteriors, as shown in the appendix. Our federated online Laplace approximation provides an effective iteration method for estimating the probabilistic parameters of both the global and local models in an online manner.\nThe probabilistic parameters obtained by our method can be directly used in the FL framework.\nIn contrast, because the probabilistic parameters are always overestimated by offline methods, as discussed in Eq. 21, these methods are generally ineffective for the FL task in practice.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: we need to approximate H¯nsubscript¯𝐻𝑛\\bar{H}_{n} in a more efficient and practical way, as it is very expensive to calculate and store H¯nsubscript¯𝐻𝑛\\bar{H}_{n} directly.\nInspired by  [ref]16, we assume that the parameters in the covariance matrix are independent from each other.\nTherefore, we can approximate H¯nsubscript¯𝐻𝑛\\bar{H}_{n} using a diagonal matrix, thus decreasing the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
