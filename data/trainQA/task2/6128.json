      "content": "Paper Title: Few-shot Link Prediction on N-ary Facts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe link prediction on n-ary facts methods can be divided into three categories: translation based models, tensor based models, and neural network based models. Translation based models: These models typically embed elements in a fact into a low-dimensional space, and evaluate the plausibility of the fact by translating entities through relations. The first work of this type m-TransH  represents an n-ary fact as a mapping from a sequence of attributes to their respective values and uses a translation-based approach to model each mapping and derive the truth value. RAE  extends m-TransH and achieves favorable performance by taking entity correlations into account. Tensor based models: These models employ a high-order tensor to represent the truth space of facts and predict new links by reconstructing the tensor. Due to their effectiveness in link prediction on binary facts, researchers have applied them to handle n-ary facts. Examples of these extensions include m-CP [ref]8, m-DistMult [ref]8, and HypE [ref]8, which are generalizations of CP [ref]15, DistMult [ref]8, and SimplE , respectively. TuckER [ref]17 is the first to introduce tucker decomposition into link prediction on binary facts and achieves good results. GETD  and S2S  extend TuckER to learn embeddings from n-ary facts. Specifically, GETD captures the latent interactions between different elements with minimal parameters. But it is not suitable for n-ary facts with mixed arities and assumes that relations and attributes in n-ary facts are equally important which is often not the case in reality. S2S can handle n-ary facts with mixed arities and presents a novel sparsifying method to address the over-parameterization problem in existing tensor models. Neural network based models: These models use neural networks to model the interaction between different elements in n-ary facts. NaLP  represents an n-ary fact as a set of attribute-value pairs and models the correlation of these attribute-value pairs through a fully-connected neural network to access the validity of the fact. However, an n-ary fact usually has a primary triple. Thus, HINGE  and NeuInfer  represent an n-ary fact as a primary triple with several auxiliary attribute-value pairs and use neural modules to combine the validity evaluation of the primary triple and the compatibility evaluation of the auxiliary attribute-value pairs to produce a score of the fact. StarE  proposes a graph representation learning mechanism for encoding KGs with arbitrary auxiliary pairs. It enhances the communication from auxiliary attribute-value pairs to the primary triple and uses Transformer  for tail entity prediction. QUAD  uses multiple aggregators to learn representations for n-ary facts, including one aggregator from the perspective of the base triple and the other one from the perspective of the auxiliary attribute-value pairs. While Hy-Transformer  replaces the graph aggregation encoder of StarE with a lightweight embedding processing module, achieving higher efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. However, StarE, QUAD, and Hy-Transformer all ignore the specific pairwise information interaction in n-ary structures. Thus, GRAN  represents an n-ary fact as a heterogeneous graph and uses edge-biased fully-connected attention to account for graph heterogeneity. The above models generally encode n-ary facts in Euclidean space, where it is difficult to preserve the hierarchical relationships of entities. Thus, PolygonE  embeds n-ary facts as gyro-polygons in hyperbolic poincaré ball and designs a vertex-gyrocentoid optimization goal to measure the credibility of facts. RAM  identifies the importance of attributes in n-ary facts and focuses on learning the knowledge representation from the attribute level. The above models are performed in a black-box fashion and cannot provide a human-understandable interpretation. Thus HyperMLN  interprets the path-reasoning process with first-order logic. Additionally, some recent works address n-ary fact prediction in special scenarios, such as predicting links in semi- and fully inductive settings .\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: new links by reconstructing the tensor.
