      "content": "Paper Title: ART-Rx: A Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Controlled Adaptive Real-Time Threshold Receiver for Molecular Communication\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are many well-established modulation schemes [ref]12   for use in MC Tx, including on / off keying (OOK), concentration shift keying (CSK), and molecular shift keying (MoSK). OOK, being one of the simplest modulation schemes, encodes information through the presence or absence of IM during a bit interval . A bit ’1’ is represented by the release of a predefined number of IM at a bit interval, whereas bit ’0’ is represented by the absence of IM. CSK uses predefined concentration threshold levels to represent different symbols . As an example, if we set the threshold for bit ’1’ at 8000 IM and bit ’0’ at 2000 IM, the respective numbers of IM are released at the beginning of each signal corresponding to the bit being transmitted. MoSK is a modulation scheme that was introduced more recently compared to OOK and CSK [ref]12 . In MoSK, different types of molecules are used to represent different symbols or bits . Two different types of IM each represent different bits. This allows for improved symbol detection accuracy because the Rx can differentiate between different types of IM, rather than relying on varying molecule concentrations. Through the use of multiple types of molecules to represent more symbols, MoSK can also enable higher data rates . However, this added complexity makes it more challenging to use in certain biological environments. Considering the nature of this, CSK was chosen as the modulation scheme to verify the performance of ART-Rx in this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: There are many well-established modulation schemes [ref]12   for use in MC Tx, including on / off keying (OOK), concentration shift keying (CSK), and molecular shift keying (MoSK).
