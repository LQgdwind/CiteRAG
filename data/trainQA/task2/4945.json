      "content": "Paper Title: GLIF: A Unified Gated Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron for Spiking Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSpiking neural network (SNN) is considered the third generation of the neural network, and the bionic modeling of its activation unit is called the spiking neuron, which brings about the spike-based communication between layers  . Due to the high sparsity and multiplication-free operation in information processing, such spike-based communication can improve energy efficiency  [ref]4. Moreover, spiking neuron can effectively capture temporal information and has good performance in processing neuromorphic data  and anti-noise . Together with artificial neural network (ANN) colleagues, SNN further shows great potential for general intelligence . Thus, SNN has aroused heated research interests recently. The commonly used spiking neuron in different SNNs  [ref]8  0 1 2 is the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model, named vanilla LIF. As the name suggests, it can implement three different neuronal behaviors: membrane potential leakage, integration accumulation, and spike initiation. To better model neurons, prior works 3 4 5 6 7 have improved the vanilla LIF from the above three aspects, and proposed many LIF variants with different biological features. For all these vanilla and variant LIF models (referred to as simplex LIF), any of the three neuronal behaviors supports only single biological feature. For instance, the vanilla LIF model only utilizes exponential decay in membrane potential leakage, while 5 only supports linear decay. However, different neurons in the cerebral cortex have different response characteristics 8 9.This naturally raises an issue: could the higher neuronal dynamic diversity of spiking neurons help SNNs do better? In this paper, we investigate the hybrid bio-features in the LIF model to answer this question. We propose the gated LIF model (GLIF) that fuses different bio-features in the aforementioned three neuronal behaviors to possess more response characteristics. As illustrated in Fig. 1, GLIF controls the fusion of different bio-features through gating units GŒ±subscriptùê∫ùõºG_{\\alpha}, GŒ≤subscriptùê∫ùõΩG_{\\beta}, and GŒ≥subscriptùê∫ùõæG_{\\gamma} for those three neuronal behaviors that are membrane potential leakage, integration accumulation, and spike initiation, respectively. In each gating unit, a gating factor is computed from a Sigmoid function œÉ‚Äã(x)ùúéùë•\\sigma(x) over a learnable gating parameter xùë•x to determine the proportion of each bio-feature, thus guiding the fusion of different bio-features. Therefore, GLIF can simultaneously contain different bio-features, possessing more response characteristics. In addition, when the gating factor is 00 or 111, GLIF can also support single bio-feature. As a result, GLIF can cover other different LIF models and be viewed as a super spiking neuron, greatly enlarging the representation space of spiking neurons. Furthermore, we introduce the channel-wise parametric method to GLIF. This method makes all membrane-related parameters in GLIF learnable and shares the same GLIF parameters channel-wisely in SNNs. Combining with learnable gating factors in GLIF, on the one hand, this method makes different channels in SNNs have completely different spiking neurons, leveraging the larger representation space of GLIF neurons to increase the neuronal dynamic diversity of spiking neurons. Meanwhile, the heterogeneity of spiking neurons and the expressive ability of SNNs are also increased. On the other hand, the spike neurons in SNNs are constantly changing during training, which is similar to the neuronal maturation during development 0 1 2, thus the adaptivity of spiking neurons being enhanced. Our contributions are as follows: We propose the GLIF model, a unified formulation of the spiking neuron that fuses multiple biological features through gating units, enlarging the representation space of spiking neurons. We exploit the channel-wise parametric method to leverage the larger representation space of GLIF, thus increasing the neuronal dynamic diversity in SNNs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the GLIF model on both static datasets and the neuromorphic dataset. For example, our model can achieve the state-of-the-art 75.48%percent75.4875.48\\% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 with only two time steps.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: the spike-based communication between layers  .
