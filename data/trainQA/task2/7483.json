Heterogeneous Non-sequential Recommendation.\nMany deep learning techniques (e.g., MLP, autoencoder, and GNNs) have been widely adopted in multi-behavior recommendation and have achieved remarkable performance.\nEHCF captures the complex relations between different behaviors by relating the transition of each behavior.\nVAE++  is a VAE-based method which designs two representation enhancement modules to capture multiple behavior signals.\nFor the GNN-based methods in multi-behavior recommendation, MBGCN  designs a unified graph for representing multi-behavior data and performs graph convolution operation to learn node representations under different behaviors.\nMBGMN  proposes a meta-graph neural network to capture the complicated dependencies across different types of user-item interactions with the meta-learning paradigm.\nCRGCN  adopts a cascading GCN structure to learn users’ preferences under each behavior.\nTo alleviate the data sparsity and popularity bias, there are some recent works trying to leverage contrastive learning.\nCML  designs a multi-behavior contrastive learning paradigm to capture relations across different behaviors.\nMMCLR  proposes a multi-behavior contrastive learning task and a multi-view contrastive learning task.\nMixMBR  introduces a mixup data augmentation method and combines it with contrastive learning. These methods do not introduce sequential information and differ significantly from our problem definition, for which reason we do not include them in the empirical studies. Heterogeneous Sequential Recommendation.\nExisting heterogeneous sequential recommendation algorithms are still relatively few.\nRLBL  uses the behavior transition matrix to represent the relationship between behaviors and uses RNN and log-bilinear to capture a user’s interests.\nRIB  also introduces the behavior types and incorporates them into the GRU module.\nBINN  introduces the behavior information inside LSTM  and learns both the long-term and short-term interests using users’ past behaviors and items.\nDMT  uses Transformer to model the subsequences of each same type of behavior,  which captures the interactions between the same behaviors separately.\nMGNN-SPred  constructs heterogeneous graphs about multiple types of behaviors.\nMSR  uses GNN to model item sequences and GRU to model behavior sequences.\nWe can see that these methods are based on RNN, GNN, and Transformer.\nDifferent from the above methods, we propose a heterogeneous sequential recommendation model based on MLP.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: to its strong modeling ability and generalization.\nWith the introduction of deep learning models, the performance has been further improved.\nThe recurrent neural network (RNN) based method GRU4Rec [ref]1 consumes the sequential information and captures the user’s dynamic intent very well.\nThe convolutional neural network (CNN) based method Caser [ref]3 utilizes some horizontal and vertical\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
