      "content": "Paper Title: Brain-Inspired Computational Intelligence via Predictive Coding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe machine learning community is developing and producing models that push the boundaries of the field on a weekly basis. In the last year alone, we have witnessed considerable breakthroughs in the fields of generative artificial intelligence (AI) [ref]1 [ref]2  , game playing  , and text-generation   . These results reflect over a decade of advances in the field, made possible by the joint effort of tens of thousands of researchers and engineers who have built on the seminal work of Krizhevsky et al.Â on ImageNet  to improve the performance of deep artificial neural networks trained with the error backpropagation algorithm . Research and application domains that have been most significantly impacted include image recognition    , speech recognition , game playing   , and natural language understanding   . It may thus come as a surprise that research on alternative training methods for machine learning is more active than ever, with many works often co-authored by the same scientists who pioneered backpropagation-based schemes  [ref]22  . These lines of research, however, are not contradictory but complementary: the increasingly impressive results of standard deep neural networks have also highlighted several significant limitations. Alternative methods and approaches may play an enabling role in applications where the aforementioned limitations preclude further developments and advancements. Modern deep learning models are notoriously computationally expensive  , untrustable  , and biologically implausible  0  [ref]22 1 2 3 4. While identifying the steps that will allow us to solve these problems is difficult, a promising direction focuses on understanding, as well as reverse engineering, how the human brain learns generative models of the world 5  6. In this review, we argue that a fruitful approach to achieving the goal of efficient and intelligent machines lies within a theory of learning and perception in the brain, called predictive coding (PC) 7 8 9, which has its roots in Bayesian inference and signal compression. Notably, models of PC exhibit several intriguing and valuable properties. First, the locality of PC-based model inversion schemes allows the training of artificial neural networks with any given topology 2 0. This differs from backprop, which can only be applied to feedforward and acyclic models, unless derivatives over time are stored, resulting in an algorithm (i.e., backprop through time) that is as inefficient as it is biologically implausible. Locality is important, as it would facilitate the training of models with arbitrarily entangled structures, similar to the biological networks that constitute our brains and underwrite our level of intelligence 1. Furthermore, PC networks are naturally more robust in relation to standard models trained with backprop, due to the relaxation process that spreads error signals across the whole network. In supervised learning, this process emulates implicit gradient descent 2, is naturally more stable, and is less reliant on hyperparameter searches. This allows predictive-coding-based models to perform better in tasks that are more likely to be faced by natural agents, while regularizing the underlying energy landscape 3 and avoiding troublesome phenomena, such as vanishing and exploding gradients 4 5. Summarizing, PC has a solid mathematical formulation, with roots in signal compression and Bayesian inference 6.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: models that push the boundaries of the field on a weekly basis.
