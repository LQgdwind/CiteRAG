      "content": "Paper Title: Curvature-based Feature Selection with Application in Classifying Electronic Health Records\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the past few decades, Machine Learning and deep learning algorithms have been widely proposed for solving healthcare problems, such as diagnosis prediction of various diseases including cervical cancer , breast cancer [ref]29, and thoracic disease , which have usually taken the form of classification. Due to privacy considerations   , there is a large number of healthcare data sets containing missing values. To cope with this common issue, the Bayesian Possibilistic C-means (BPCM)  was devised to interpolate the missing values by extending the Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm (to model the noise and uncertainty) with the support of Bayesian theory (to calculate cluster centroids). The Gene Sequence-based Auxiliary Model (GSAM) , as an ensemble learner, was proposed to predict the missing values via data correction and classify testing data samples via a combination of multiple weak learners within a gene auxiliary module. To enhance the classification performance in terms of accuracy, the Weight Constrained Neural Network (WCNN) was proposed . WCNN utilises network training to solve a constraint optimisation problem. An extension of the Broad Learning System (BLS) was devised by adding a label-based autoencoder (BLS II), to learn robust feature representations in an ensemble way, and also to tune the hyper-parameters in a Support Vector Machine (SVM), namely BLS II-SVM . Another ensemble learner, VIBES, was presented to detect the dependency between attributes in the given data set and to speed up the search for base learners . In addition, Genetic Algorithm has been adopted to optimise the performance of Random Forest (RFGA) [ref]23. Work towards the enhancement of activation functions in neural networks was also proposed, such as Variable Activation Function (VAF)  and Adaptive Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (AdaTSK) . Apart from those adaptive action functions, a proposition of a two-layer mixture of factor analysers with joint factor loading (2L-MJFA) was presented to conduct the dimensionality reduction and classification together . This is done by utilising two mixtures nested with each other, each of which containing several components, where each class of the data sets is represented in a specific mixture of factor analysers (MFA). Such an approach has been proven to be suitable for small-scale data sets, particularly those that contains a smaller number of data instances but includes a larger number of data attributes.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: Machine Learning and deep learning algorithms have been widely proposed for solving healthcare problems, such as diagnosis prediction of various diseases including cervical cancer , breast cancer [ref]29, and thoracic disease , which have usually taken the form of classification.
