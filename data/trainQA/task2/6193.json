      "content": "Paper Title: Relating Implicit Bias and Adversarial Attacks through Intrinsic Dimension\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe concept of the intrinsic dimension (IdsubscriptùêºùëëI_{d}) of a data set is widely used in data analysis and Machine Learning. Before providing a more formal definition, imagine a data set where your data points are the cities around the globe described by their 3D Cartesian coordinates. We will say that the embedding dimension of this data set is three. However, anyone familiar with cartography would agree that nearly the same information can be encoded with only two coordinates (latitude and longitude). Therefore, its IdsubscriptùêºùëëI_{d} would be equal to two. Indeed, one of the definitions of IdsubscriptùêºùëëI_{d} is the minimum number of coordinates needed to represent the data with minimal information loss. A complementary definition is the dimension of the manifold in which the data lies, that in this case would be a sphere.\nThe intrinsic dimension estimation is closely related to the field of dimensionality reduction since it gives a hint about which should be the dimension of the projection space to avoid information loss.\nThus, one possible way of estimating the IdsubscriptùêºùëëI_{d} is to find a meaningful projection into the lowest dimensional space possible.\nA classical method for doing that is Principal Component Analysis , but it has the drawback that, strictly speaking, it is only correct if the data lie in a hyperplane, since it performs a linear transformation.\nTherefore, the development of methods for overcoming such a limitation is an active research field, resulting in techniques like Multidimensional Scaling¬†, Isomap¬†, Locally Linear Embedding¬†, Autoencoders¬†[ref]30, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)¬†[ref]31 or Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)¬†, to mention some.\nOther methods can estimate the IdsubscriptùêºùëëI_{d} of a data set even in the case in which projecting in the lower dimensional space is not possible (for example, due to topological constraints). Typically, these approaches infer the IdsubscriptùêºùëëI_{d} from the properties of the Nearest Neighbors‚Äô distances. While a full review of these methods is out of the scope of this work (the interested reader is referred to ), it is worth mentioning the fractal dimension estimation¬†, the Maximum Likelihood approach¬†, the Dimensionality from Angle and Norm Concentration (DANCo) approach¬† or the two-NN . The last is the one employed in this work since it is particularly fast and it behaves well even in the case of data sets with a high non-uniformity on the density of points.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: the development of methods for overcoming such a limitation is an active research field, resulting in techniques like Multidimensional Scaling¬†, Isomap¬†, Locally Linear Embedding¬†, Autoencoders¬†[ref]30, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)¬†[ref]31 or Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)¬†, to mention some.\nOther methods can estimate the IdsubscriptùêºùëëI_{d} of a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
