      "content": "Paper Title: AEFE: Automatic Embedded Feature Engineering For Categorical Features\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn general machine learning problems, feature engineering (FE) is a crucial step that influences the final performance. Studies have shown that feature engineering is often more important and time-consuming than models training . Automatic feature engineering frameworks may be used to automate this process to saves a considerable amount of time and discover more novel features. Nevertheless, just like the No Free Lunch theorem of model selection , there is no universally applicable automatic feature engineering solution. Another focused area is deep learning, which emphasizes end-to-end learning. In this area, feature engineering in traditional machine learning is replaced by representation learning. However, there is no ubiquitous deep learning model for all tasks, which means different feature extraction layers need to be designed for different original features. Some important tasks of data mining, such as recommendation system and click-through rate prediction, usually contain a large number of categorical fields111Categorical field and categorical feature, which are from the perspective of data form and machine learning respectively, are similar in most contexts of this paper.  (e.g., gender, occupation), each field contains a variety of values (occupation including students, programmers, etc.). A field containing disubscriptùëëùëñd_{i} values is converted to disubscriptùëëùëñd_{i} binary features via one-hot encoding. In a dataset with mùëöm categorical fields, the total number of features is Nf=‚àëi=1mdisubscriptùëÅùëìsubscriptsuperscriptùëöùëñ1subscriptùëëùëñN_{f}=\\sum^{m}_{i=1}d_{i}(Nf‚â´mmuch-greater-thansubscriptùëÅùëìùëöN_{f}\\gg m), but the only mùëöm of them is 111 while the rest is 00, which causes high-dimensional sparsity. Therefore, how to effectively represent categorical features is a core task of these applications. Among various features, the combinatorial feature, which is a combination of different raw features through a certain paradigm, or the crossing feature learned by models, is the most crucial. For example, in the advertisement CTR problem, a specific user prefers to click on the snack advertisement in the afternoon since he or she becomes hungry at tea time.\nShan  believed that they are often the strongest features of many models, while Cheng  also emphasized that they added plenty of manual crossing features in the wide part. The crossing feature \"times=afternoon_AND_ADCategory=snacks\" brings a more reasonable inference than the one-hot encoded feature \"times=afternoon\" and \"ADCategory=snacks\" separately. The combinatorial features can bring great precision improvement to prediction; Its high interpretability is helpful to dig deep into the underlying relationship of the data. In order to reduce the time-consuming artificial feature engineering of combinatorial features and improve the prediction accuracy, researchers and practitioners invested a lot of time and effort into this aspect. The research substantially focuses on the improvement of machine learning models and automatic feature engineering. To learn the crossing features, some machine learning models such as Factorization Machines (FM) [ref]5 represent categorical features as latent vectors and model the feature crossing by the inner product of latent vectors. Inspired by the successful use of deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing, studies [ref]6 [ref]7  implicitly map categorical features into embedding vectors, use FM to train the embedding layer, and then use Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to obtain higher-order nonlinear interactions of features. The key point of these studies is to design a novel feature crossing layer, So a technique named Neural architecture Search (NAS) from AutoML was applied to design it automatically  0 1. Although how to handle the high-dimensional sparse features is solved by deep learning models, they cannot make full use of all active combinatorial features and have less interpretability. The automatic feature engineering frameworks can also construct specific features. Some of them are oriented to various data mining tasks. They can perform feature engineering on different types of features (e.g., categorical features, numerical features) while maintaining acceptable interpretability. For example, Data Science Machine(DSM) 2, which iteratively constructs combinatorial features in relational data tables. Based on DSM, The follow-up works emphasize a more complex construction paradigm 3 and the broader data form 4. However, there are neither in-depth studies of combinations for categorical features nor attempts to embed high-dimensional sparse categorical features by automatic feature engineering techniques. In this paper, we propose Automatic Embedded Feature Engineering(AEFE), which can perform feature engineering on sparse categorical features automatically. It generates complex but interpretable combinatorial features, as shown in Table 1, and requires no manual intervention. AEFE is generally applicable to most Internet data mining tasks that contain a large number of categorical features. Overall, the contribution of this paper is as follows: We attempt to apply automatic feature engineering technology on the feature combination problem of categorical features and devise AEFE, a novel solution to represent combinatorial features in machine learning. Rich feature construction paradigms and operation sets are provided by AEFE to generate various meaningful statistical features, which can significantly enhance model performance. Meanwhile, the multi-module cascaded feature selection unit can select the most useful features efficiently. Diverse optimization techniques like data sampling, field combination search, and distributed implementation are leveraged to ensure that the framework is scalable and efficient. By experiments on several typical datasets, it is empirically demonstrated that AEFE cascaded with GBDT(Gradient Boosting Desicion Tree) achieves better performance than state-of-the-art deep learning models. In addition, AEFE has a stronger capture capability of combination information, as well as better interpretability, than some learning models such as FM, AFM, DeepFM, xDeepFM. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, relevant previous works about machine learning models and automatic feature engineering are introduced. In Section 3, we present our AEFE in detail and illustrate it from different perspectives. In Section 4, some optimization techniques of AEFE are described. We conduct several experiments in Section 5 to show the performance of our methods, and finally, a brief conclusion and prospects are presented in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: focuses on the improvement of machine learning models and automatic feature engineering.
