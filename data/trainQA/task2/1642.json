The algorithms\nin   , , and    (cf. [ref]55)\nare grid-based. Their basic structure is (simplifying to the extreme)\nthe following: Estimate the condition number of the problem (with a\nsequence of grids of increasing fineness). Create an extra grid (if necessary), whose mesh is determined by the condition number. Select points in the grid and use them to obtain a solution to\nthe problem. In general, grid-based algorithms have complexity Ω​(𝐃n)Ωsuperscript𝐃𝑛\\Omega(\\mathbf{D}^{n}). This\nfact allows us to estimate the norm ‖f‖∞ℝsuperscriptsubscriptnorm𝑓ℝ\\|f\\|_{\\infty}^{\\mathbb{R}} of the data f𝑓f\nwithout affecting the overall complexity of the algorithms. Moreover,\nthe fact that 𝖪𝖪\\mathsf{K} is smaller than κ𝜅\\kappa results in a cost reduction. In this subsection, we focus on an algorithm for the computation of the\nBetti numbers of a spherical algebraic set. This covers the case of\ncounting zeros of a square polynomial system treated\nin    and the computation of the Betti numbers of\na projective real variety . For simplicity of exposition\nwe omit some computational aspects: 1) The presentation we do of\nthe algorithms follows the construction-selection paradigm\nof    instead of the inclusion-exclusion paradigm of    .\nThis makes easier the exposition of the algorithms without compromising their\ncomputational complexity. 2) We focus on Betti numbers to avoid describing\nthe more involved computation of torsion coefficients in the\nhomology groups.\n3) We deal with neither parallelization nor finite precision. The\ninterested reader can find details about these in the cited\nreferences. The backbone of existing grid-based algorithms in numerical real algebraic\ngeometry        is an effective\nconstruction of spherical nets. The basic construction was done originally\nin  and it is based on projecting the uniform grid in the\nboundary of a unit cube onto the unit sphere. Recall that a (spherical) δ𝛿\\delta-net is a finite subset\n𝒢⊂𝕊n𝒢superscript𝕊𝑛\\mathcal{G}\\subset\\mathbb{S}^{n} such that for all x∈𝕊n𝑥superscript𝕊𝑛x\\in\\mathbb{S}^{n},\ndist𝕊​(x,𝒢)<δsubscriptdist𝕊𝑥𝒢𝛿\\mathrm{dist}_{\\mathbb{S}}(x,\\mathcal{G})<\\delta. We will omit the term ‘spherical’ as all\nnets we consider are so. There is an algorithm GRID that on input (n,k)∈ℕ×ℕ𝑛𝑘ℕℕ(n,k)\\in\\mathbb{N}\\times\\mathbb{N} outputs a 2−ksuperscript2𝑘2^{-k}-net 𝒢k⊂𝕊nsubscript𝒢𝑘superscript𝕊𝑛\\mathcal{G}_{k}\\subset\\mathbb{S}^{n} with The cost of this algorithm is 𝒪​(2n​log⁡n+n​k)𝒪superscript2𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑘\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{n\\log n+nk}\\right).  ∎ The grid construction in Proposition 4.1,\nwhich occurs\nin       ,\nis not optimal. This is due to the 2n​log⁡nsuperscript2𝑛𝑛2^{n\\log n} factor\nin the estimates, which can be decreased to\n2𝒪​(n)superscript2𝒪𝑛2^{\\mathcal{O}(n)}. An algorithm doing this, i.e.,\nconstructing a spherical 2−ksuperscript2𝑘2^{-k}-net of size 2𝒪​(n)​2k​(n+1)superscript2𝒪𝑛superscript2𝑘𝑛12^{\\mathcal{O}(n)}2^{k(n+1)}\nin 2𝒪​(n)​2k​(n+1)superscript2𝒪𝑛superscript2𝑘𝑛12^{\\mathcal{O}(n)}2^{k(n+1)}-time is given\nin [2, Theorem 1.9(1)].\nWe use the sub-optimal result of Proposition 4.1\nto focus on the effect\nof just changing the norm when comparing between the old and new\nversions of the algorithms. But we observe here that by using the\nnets in  one can remove the\nlog⁡(n)𝑛\\log(n) factors in the exponents.\n\nReference markers found: [55]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]55: a grid to discretize the original problem and solves\nthe latter by working on the grid points only (selecting and\nfinding proximity relations between its points).
