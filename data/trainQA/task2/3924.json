      "content": "Paper Title: The Smallest Hard Trees\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBesides the computational complexity of CSPs, the descriptive complexity of CSPs has been studied intensively, and leads to a fruitful interplay of finite model theory, graph theory, and universal algebra. Since the results obtained in this context are highly relevant for the open conjectures mentioned above,\nwe provide a brief introduction to the most prominent concepts. A digraph ‚Ñç‚Ñç\\mathbb{H} has tree duality if for all finite digraphs ùîæùîæ\\mathbb{G}, if whenever all trees that map homomorphically to ùîæùîæ\\mathbb{G} also map to ‚Ñç‚Ñç\\mathbb{H}, then ùîæùîæ\\mathbb{G} maps to ‚Ñç‚Ñç\\mathbb{H}. It is well-known that a finite digraph ‚Ñç‚Ñç\\mathbb{H} has tree duality if and only if the so-called arc-consistency procedure solves CSP‚Å°(‚Ñç)CSP‚Ñç\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{H})¬†. This procedure is of central importance to our work, for many independent reasons that we mention later, and will be introduced in detail in Section¬†2.1. For every finite digraph ‚Ñç‚Ñç\\mathbb{H}, the arc-consistency procedure for CSP‚Å°(‚Ñç)CSP‚Ñç\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{H}) can be formulated as a Datalog program¬†; Datalog is the fragment of Prolog where function symbols are forbidden. Every Datalog program can be evaluated in polynomial time. Feder and Vardi proved that CSP‚Å°(‚Ñç)CSP‚Ñç\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{H}) can be solved by Datalog if and only if ‚Ñç‚Ñç\\mathbb{H} has so-called bounded treewidth duality; the definition of this concept is similar to the concept of tree duality but we omit it since it is not needed in this article. Bounded treewidth duality can be strengthened to bounded pathwidth duality, which corresponds precisely to solvability by a natural fragment of Datalog, namely linear Datalog¬†. Linear Datalog programs can be evaluated in NL. An even more restricted fragment of Datalog is linear symmetric Datalog;\nsuch programs can be evaluated in L¬†. A structure ‚Ñç‚Ñç\\mathbb{H} has the ability to count  if CSP‚Å°(‚Ñç)CSP‚Ñç\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{H}) can encode, in some natural sense (namely pp-constructibility  [ref]12), solving systems of linear equations over ‚Ñ§psubscript‚Ñ§ùëù\\mathbb{Z}_{p} (for some prime pùëùp); thus making CSP‚Å°(‚Ñç)CSP‚Ñç\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{H}) ModpL-hard. The ability to count adds substantial complexity to the CSP. Structures that cannot count are all tractable and even in Datalog¬†[ref]17 \nand this result, known as the bounded width theorem, was an important intermediate step towards the resolution of the Feder-Vardi CSP dichotomy conjecture. Based on this theorem, the lack of the ability to count has a number of equivalent characterizations: bounded width, bounded treewidth duality, definability in Datalog, solvability by Singleton Arc Consistency¬†0. Several important classes of structures exhibit a dichotomy between NP-hardness and the lack of the ability to count (assuming P‚â†NPPNP\\operatorname{P}\\neq\\operatorname{NP}), which we will refer to as ‚Äúeasy structures cannot count‚Äù.\nExamples include undirected graphs , smooth digraphs (digraphs without sources and sinks)¬†, conservative digraphs (digraphs expanded with all subsets of vertices as unary relations) , binary conservative structures (even 3-conservative) .\nWe note that this phenomenon also occurs for many large classes of infinite structures ‚Ñç‚Ñç\\mathbb{H}: for example for all first-order expansions of the basic relations of RCC5¬†;\nsee¬† for a survey on the question of which infinite-domain CSPs can be solved in Datalog. In this paper, however, we only consider finite structures. Additionally, for classes of finite structures,\nif the easy structures in the class cannot count, then the algebraic tractability condition\nfor that class can be tested in polynomial time¬†. In  Bul√≠n conjectured that easy trees cannot count, establishing this fact for a large yet structurally limited subclass of trees. Let ùïãùïã\\mathbb{T} be a tree. If ùïãùïã\\mathbb{T} has the ability to count, then ùïãùïã\\mathbb{T} is NP-hard. This conjecture (which is rephrasing Conjecture 2 in¬†) would answer an open question posed by Hell, Ne≈°et≈ôil, and Zhu¬† (Open Problem 1 at the end of the article): they asked whether there exists a tractable tree which does not have bounded treewidth duality.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: programs can be evaluated in L¬†.
