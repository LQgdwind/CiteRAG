      "content": "Paper Title: Switch-BERT: Learning to Model Multimodal Interactions by Switching Attention and Input\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare the proposed Switch-BERT against existing multimodal architectures of both single and dual-stream on three widely-used benchmark datasets. Baselines for comparison include the state-of-the-art multimodal architectures of ViLBERT [ref]25, UNITER [ref]5, VisualBERT , VL-BERT [ref]32 and LXMERT . These baselines and Switch-BERT follow the pre-train-then-fine-tune procedure with the controlled settings described above and have the same context for comparison. Table 3 presents the experimental results of the model, together with results from these baselines. We observe that Switch-BERT has performances that are on par or better than the previous state-of-the-art architectures in these downstream tasks. The absolute improvements of 0.9% on RefCOCO+, 1.8% on VQAv2 and 1.1% on Flick30K Image Retrieval over previous SOTA 333For overall SOTA numbers that can be achieved without the controlled settings, readers can refer to  for VQAv2 and Flick30K Retrieval datasets, and  for RefCOCO+. indicating that Switch-BERT can learn better vision and language representations that generalize better than these alternative methods to the downstream tasks. The controlled settings ensure the improvements are mainly contributed from the proposed architectures of Switch-Attention and Switch-Input blocks, which aim at easing the semantic misalignment between modalities and learning image-text modality interactions.\nTable 3 also includes the results of Switch-BERT without pre-training on Conceptual Captions dataset, i.e., initialized only from BERT in . The degradation in performance demonstrates that the Switch-BERT benefits from pretraining as other multimodal BERTs.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: existing multimodal architectures of both single and dual-stream on three widely-used benchmark datasets.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
