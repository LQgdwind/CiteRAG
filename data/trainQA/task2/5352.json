      "content": "Paper Title: Computability of Optimizers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe earliest non-computability result has been provided by Church  and Turing  , by (independently of each other) proving non-computability of the Entscheidungsproblem. Since then the question of computability has been a staple in theoretical computer science and computer engineering and even found its way into the field of mathematical analysis . Non-computability results for optimization problems have already been formulated in , [ref]8, , [ref]10,\n, , , and [ref]14.\nThe author of  proves non-Borel-Turing computability for functions with certain discontinuities. Using these results [ref]10 deducts non-Borel-Turing computability of linear programs with real coefficients.\nIn  the stronger non-Banach-Mazur computability, as well as non-approximability, for inverse problems in the so-called lasso formulation is derived. The authors of ,  and  provide results on non-Banach-Mazur computability for selected problems in information theory and related fields.\nFinally, [ref]14 proves non-computability for the specific case of finding neural networks to solve inverse problems. However, a more refined notion of non-computability is deployed, leading to a more nuanced result than the one obtained in this paper. However, each of these results focuses on a special problem setting, leaving the question whether there exists a general comprehensive theory for non-computability for optimization problems wide open. In addition, most results are stated for non-Borel-Turing computability, yielding the question whether such a general theory can be formulated even for non-Banach-Mazur computability and non-approximability.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: computer science and computer engineering and even found its way into the field of mathematical analysis . Non-computability results for optimization problems have already been formulated in , [ref]8, , [ref]10,\n, , , and [ref]14.\nThe author of  proves non-Borel-Turing computability for functions with certain discontinuities. Using these results [ref]10 deducts non-Borel-Turing\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
