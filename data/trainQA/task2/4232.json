This assumption is natural in the sense that if it were not satisfied, the contracts would not be able to be fulfilled, and they should not have been accepted in the first place. Essentially, if Assumption 3.1 holds, then Problem (P𝑃P) admits a Slater Point (see e.g., [8, Sec. 5.2.3] [6, Prop 5.3.1]); the inequality must be strict since the domain of ΛjsubscriptΛ𝑗\\Lambda_{j} implicitly imposes the constraint that sj≤λjsubscript𝑠𝑗subscript𝜆𝑗s_{j}\\leq\\lambda_{j}, and this property is later used to guarantee that the bids required to obtain the optimal supply rates are finite. An assumption similar in spirit, but much stronger, appears in . We now derive a dual of Problem (P𝑃P) and then proceed to an analysis and interpretation of the dual. We begin with the Lagrangian function associated to Problem (P𝑃P): where μ∈ℝM𝜇superscriptℝ𝑀\\mu\\in\\mathbb{R}^{M} is associated with the equality constraints ∑i∈ℬjRi​j=sjsubscript𝑖subscriptℬ𝑗subscript𝑅𝑖𝑗subscript𝑠𝑗\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{B}_{j}}R_{ij}=s_{j}, ρ∈ℝN𝜌superscriptℝ𝑁\\rho\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N} is associated with the contract fulfillment constraints, and θ𝜃\\theta to the non-negativity constraints. The dual constraints are θ≥0𝜃0\\theta\\geq 0 and the dual problem is derived through determining the form of To this end, we minimize ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} pointwise over s𝑠s, which results in the appearance of the Fenchel conjugate [13, Sec 4.2] that is, minimizing ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} over s𝑠s we obtain: There is an appealing duality relationship between Λ2​n​dsubscriptΛ2𝑛𝑑\\Lambda_{2nd} and Λ2​n​d⋆​(μ)superscriptsubscriptΛ2𝑛𝑑⋆𝜇\\Lambda_{2nd}^{\\star}(\\mu), namely that Λ2​n​dsubscriptΛ2𝑛𝑑\\Lambda_{2nd} is the integral of W−1superscript𝑊1W^{-1} and that Λ2​n​d⋆superscriptsubscriptΛ2𝑛𝑑⋆\\Lambda_{2nd}^{\\star} is the integral of W𝑊W, see  for further analysis of integrated quantile functions. [normal]proposition[Fenchel Conjugate — Second Price Case]\nThe Fenchel duality relationship between Λ2​n​dsubscriptΛ2𝑛𝑑\\Lambda_{2nd} and Λ2​n​d⋆superscriptsubscriptΛ2𝑛𝑑⋆\\Lambda_{2nd}^{\\star} is between the integrated c.d.f. W𝑊W and the integrated quantile function W−1superscript𝑊1W^{-1}: The function Λ2​n​d⋆superscriptsubscriptΛ2𝑛𝑑⋆\\Lambda_{2nd}^{\\star} is a proper, convex, and lower-semicontinuous function, which is strictly convex and strictly monotone increasing ℝ+subscriptℝ\\mathbb{R}_{+}.\n\n{proofEnd}\nProof. By definition, where the domain is restricted to (−∞,1]1(-\\infty,1] since Λ2​n​d​(q)=∞subscriptΛ2𝑛𝑑𝑞\\Lambda_{2nd}(q)=\\infty for q>1𝑞1q>1. If μ<0𝜇0\\mu<0 then Λ2​n​d⋆​(μ)=∞superscriptsubscriptΛ2𝑛𝑑⋆𝜇\\Lambda_{2nd}^{\\star}(\\mu)=\\infty since Λ2​n​d​(q)=0subscriptΛ2𝑛𝑑𝑞0\\Lambda_{2nd}(q)=0 for q≤0𝑞0q\\leq 0. If μ>x¯𝜇¯𝑥\\mu>\\bar{x} (note that this case is excluded if x¯=∞¯𝑥\\bar{x}=\\infty since then μ>x¯𝜇¯𝑥\\mu>\\bar{x} cannot be) then Λ⋆​(μ)=μ−x¯superscriptΛ⋆𝜇𝜇¯𝑥\\Lambda^{\\star}(\\mu)=\\mu-\\bar{x} since μ𝜇\\mu is greater than the maximal slope of ΛΛ\\Lambda. Finally, if μ∈[0,x¯]𝜇0¯𝑥\\mu\\in[0,\\bar{x}] then we can solve by differentiation to obtain that, optimally, q=W​(μ)𝑞𝑊𝜇q=W(\\mu) and hence where the final equality follows through integration by parts. It is proper, convex, and lower-semicontinuous since it is a conjugate function, and strictly convex on ℝ+subscriptℝ\\mathbb{R}_{+} since W𝑊W is strictly monotone on [0,x¯]0¯𝑥[0,\\bar{x}] and the function is linear thereafter. It remains strictly convex on the rest of ℝℝ\\mathbb{R} since it is affine for μ>x¯𝜇¯𝑥\\mu>\\bar{x}. It is strictly monotone on ℝ+subscriptℝ\\mathbb{R}_{+} by inspection. From Propositions 3.1 and 3.1 we can conclude that for q∈(0,1)𝑞01q\\in(0,1) the derivative of the acquisition cost Λ2​n​d​(q)subscriptΛ2𝑛𝑑𝑞\\Lambda_{2nd}(q) is given by the inverse of the supply curve W−1​(q)superscript𝑊1𝑞W^{-1}(q) and the derivative of the conjugate Λ2​n​d⋆​(μ)subscriptsuperscriptΛ⋆2𝑛𝑑𝜇\\Lambda^{\\star}_{2nd}(\\mu) is the supply curve itself W​(μ)𝑊𝜇W(\\mu). Therefore, in many cases it may be easier to solve dual optimization problems involving Λ⋆superscriptΛ⋆\\Lambda^{\\star}, rather than primal problems involving ΛΛ\\Lambda, since the derivatives of the former may be more easily available. These properties can be applied to derive very simple stochastic approximation algorithms to learn optimum bids without direct knowledge of W𝑊W; these results will be reported elsewhere, see also the thesis [ref]26. Returning to the Lagrangian ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} and minimizing over R𝑅R induces the dual equality constraint μj=θi​j+vi​j​ρisubscript𝜇𝑗subscript𝜃𝑖𝑗subscript𝑣𝑖𝑗subscript𝜌𝑖\\mu_{j}=\\theta_{ij}+v_{ij}\\rho_{i} (since otherwise the infimum would be −∞-\\infty), which must hold over all (i,j)𝑖𝑗(i,j) such that i∈[N],j∈𝒜iformulae-sequence𝑖delimited-[]𝑁𝑗subscript𝒜𝑖i\\in[N],j\\in\\mathcal{A}_{i}, or equivalently, j∈[M],i∈ℬjformulae-sequence𝑗delimited-[]𝑀𝑖subscriptℬ𝑗j\\in[M],i\\in\\mathcal{B}_{j}. Moreover, since we must have the dual cone constraint θi​j≥0subscript𝜃𝑖𝑗0\\theta_{ij}\\geq 0 (i.e., θi​jsubscript𝜃𝑖𝑗\\theta_{ij} is simply a slack variable) this is equivalent to the constraint ∀i∈[N],j∈𝒜i:μj≥ρi​vi​j:formulae-sequencefor-all𝑖delimited-[]𝑁𝑗subscript𝒜𝑖subscript𝜇𝑗subscript𝜌𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖𝑗\\forall i\\in[N],j\\in\\mathcal{A}_{i}:\\ \\mu_{j}\\geq\\rho_{i}v_{ij}. Thus, we have obtained: [normal]proposition[Duality]\nA dual of Problem (P𝑃P) can be formulated as where the linear inequality constraints hold over all i∈[N],j∈𝒜iformulae-sequence𝑖delimited-[]𝑁𝑗subscript𝒜𝑖i\\in[N],j\\in\\mathcal{A}_{i}. Problem (D) is dual to Problem (P𝑃P) in the sense that if D⋆superscript𝐷⋆D^{\\star} and P⋆superscript𝑃⋆P^{\\star} are their respective values (possibly ∞\\infty or −∞-\\infty), then D⋆≤P⋆superscript𝐷⋆superscript𝑃⋆D^{\\star}\\leq P^{\\star}. Problem (D) has N+M𝑁𝑀N+M variables, and d=∑i=1N|𝒜j|𝑑superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑁subscript𝒜𝑗d=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}|\\mathcal{A}_{j}| linear inequality constraints. This is in contrast to the primal (P𝑃P) which has d𝑑d variables, N+M𝑁𝑀N+M linear equality constraints and d𝑑d non-negativity constraints. In Section 3.2.1 we show how to recover primal solutions from dual solutions. In the primal, Problem (P𝑃P), there is an implicit constraint sj≤λjsubscript𝑠𝑗subscript𝜆𝑗s_{j}\\leq\\lambda_{j} due to the domain of ΛjsubscriptΛ𝑗\\Lambda_{j}. Similarly, in the dual (D) there\nis an implicit constraint that μj≥0subscript𝜇𝑗0\\mu_{j}\\geq 0 due to the domain of Λj⋆superscriptsubscriptΛ𝑗⋆\\Lambda_{j}^{\\star}. Additionally, as a consequence of the monotonicity of the objective (i.e., ρi​Cisubscript𝜌𝑖subscript𝐶𝑖\\rho_{i}C_{i} is strictly monotone increasing since Ci>0subscript𝐶𝑖0C_{i}>0), it is easy to observe that at the optimal solution the dual variables ρisubscript𝜌𝑖\\rho_{i} will also be non-negative: ρ≥0𝜌0\\rho\\geq 0. It is not formally necessary to include these as constraints in (D), but we have observed improved numerical optimization performance (with cvxpy ) when they are made explicit, particularly for large problem instances (1000s of contracts and/or item types). Under Assumption 3.1, at least one solution (s,R)𝑠𝑅(s,R) to Problem (P𝑃P) exists, strong duality holds, and the bids xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j} such that λj​Wj​(xj)=sjsubscript𝜆𝑗subscript𝑊𝑗subscript𝑥𝑗subscript𝑠𝑗\\lambda_{j}W_{j}(x_{j})=s_{j} are finite. [normal]proposition[Existence and Regularity]\nSuppose Assumption 3.1 holds. Then, there exists an optimal allocation array R⋆superscript𝑅⋆R^{\\star} for Problem (P𝑃P), the optimal win rates sj⋆=∑i∈ℬjRi​j⋆subscriptsuperscript𝑠⋆𝑗subscript𝑖subscriptℬ𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑅𝑖𝑗⋆s^{\\star}_{j}=\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{B}_{j}}R_{ij}^{\\star} are unique and there exist unique finite bids xj=Wj−1​(sj/λj)subscript𝑥𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑊𝑗1subscript𝑠𝑗subscript𝜆𝑗x_{j}=W_{j}^{-1}(s_{j}/\\lambda_{j}) which win items at the optimal rate. Moreover, there exists a unique solution ρ⋆,μ⋆superscript𝜌⋆superscript𝜇⋆\\rho^{\\star},\\mu^{\\star} to the dual, Problem (D), and there is zero duality gap.\n\n{proofEnd}\nProof. By Assumption 3.1, the value of Problem (P𝑃P) is finite since there exists a feasible s,R𝑠𝑅s,R. Then, since ΛjsubscriptΛ𝑗\\Lambda_{j} is lower semicontinuous and the feasible region is compact, namely Ri​j≥0subscript𝑅𝑖𝑗0R_{ij}\\geq 0 and ∑i∈ℬjRi​j≤λjsubscript𝑖subscriptℬ𝑗subscript𝑅𝑖𝑗subscript𝜆𝑗\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{B}_{j}}R_{ij}\\leq\\lambda_{j} (which is implicit in the domain of ΛjsubscriptΛ𝑗\\Lambda_{j}), there exists a solution s⋆,R⋆superscript𝑠⋆superscript𝑅⋆s^{\\star},R^{\\star} to Problem (P𝑃P) by Weierstrass’ theorem. The acquisition rates sj⋆=∑i∈ℬjRi​j⋆superscriptsubscript𝑠𝑗⋆subscript𝑖subscriptℬ𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑅𝑖𝑗⋆s_{j}^{\\star}=\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{B}_{j}}R_{ij}^{\\star} are unique since ΛjsubscriptΛ𝑗\\Lambda_{j} is strictly convex. Now, by the strong duality theorem (e.g., [6, Prop 5.3.1]) and the Slater point of Assumption 3.1, there exists a solution μ⋆,ρ⋆superscript𝜇⋆superscript𝜌⋆\\mu^{\\star},\\rho^{\\star} (along with the slack variables θ⋆superscript𝜃⋆\\theta^{\\star}) to the dual, Problem (D), and the value of the dual, which is finite, is equal to the value of the primal (i.e., there is zero duality gap). Finally, by strong duality and the existence of solutions, the Lagrangian optimality conditions (e.g., [6, Prop 5.3.2]) establish that s⋆∈argmins∈ℝM​ℒ​(s,R⋆,μ⋆,ρ⋆,θ⋆)superscript𝑠⋆𝑠superscriptℝ𝑀argminℒ𝑠superscript𝑅⋆superscript𝜇⋆superscript𝜌⋆superscript𝜃⋆s^{\\star}\\in\\underset{s\\in\\mathbb{R}^{M}}{\\text{argmin}}\\ \\mathcal{L}(s,R^{\\star},\\mu^{\\star},\\rho^{\\star},\\theta^{\\star}) and where we have used complementary slackness [6, prop 5.3.2] to eliminate terms involving θ⋆,R⋆superscript𝜃⋆superscript𝑅⋆\\theta^{\\star},R^{\\star}. Then, by the subgradient optimality conditions [6, Prop. 5.4.3, Prop 5.4.4], it must be that ∀j∈[M]: 0∈∂sjℒ​(s⋆,R⋆,μ⋆,ρ⋆,θ⋆)=λj​∂Λj​(sj⋆/λj)−μj⋆:for-all𝑗delimited-[]𝑀 0subscriptsubscript𝑠𝑗ℒsuperscript𝑠⋆superscript𝑅⋆superscript𝜇⋆superscript𝜌⋆superscript𝜃⋆subscript𝜆𝑗subscriptΛ𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑠𝑗⋆subscript𝜆𝑗superscriptsubscript𝜇𝑗⋆\\forall j\\in[M]:\\ 0\\in\\partial_{s_{j}}\\mathcal{L}(s^{\\star},R^{\\star},\\mu^{\\star},\\rho^{\\star},\\theta^{\\star})=\\lambda_{j}\\partial\\Lambda_{j}(s_{j}^{\\star}/\\lambda_{j})-\\mu_{j}^{\\star}. We treat two cases. First, if the support of the distribution of the prices of type j𝑗j is compact (i.e., x¯j<∞subscript¯𝑥𝑗\\bar{x}_{j}<\\infty), then since sj≤λjsubscript𝑠𝑗subscript𝜆𝑗s_{j}\\leq\\lambda_{j} we have a finite optimal bid xj=Wj−1​(sj/λj)subscript𝑥𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑊𝑗1subscript𝑠𝑗subscript𝜆𝑗x_{j}=W_{j}^{-1}(s_{j}/\\lambda_{j}). If x¯j=∞subscript¯𝑥𝑗\\bar{x}_{j}=\\infty then ∂Λj​(q)subscriptΛ𝑗𝑞\\partial\\Lambda_{j}(q) is non-empty for q∈[0,1)𝑞01q\\in[0,1) and thus, since we know this subgradient is indeed non-empty, we must have sj<λjsubscript𝑠𝑗subscript𝜆𝑗s_{j}<\\lambda_{j} and there is a unique optimal bid xj=Wj−1​(sj/λ)<∞subscript𝑥𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑊𝑗1subscript𝑠𝑗𝜆x_{j}=W_{j}^{-1}(s_{j}/\\lambda)<\\infty.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: can be applied to derive very simple stochastic approximation algorithms to learn optimum bids without direct knowledge of W𝑊W; these results will be reported elsewhere, see also the thesis [ref]26.
