      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey on Deep Learning-Based Monocular Spacecraft Pose Estimation: Current State, Limitations and Prospects\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this survey, direct approaches refer to the use of only one DL model in an end-to-end manner for regressing the spacecraft pose directly from the images without relying on intermediate stages. The models are trained using loss functions calculated from the pose error. Unlike hybrid algorithms, the approach does not require any additional information like camera parameters or a 3D model of the spacecraft apart from the ground truth pose labels. The camera parameters are intrinsically learned by the models during the training process. Phisannupawong et al. [ref]119 proposed a GoogLeNet-based  CNN architecture for regressing the 7D pose vector representing position and orientation quaternion (see Figure 8). The network was trained using different loss functions, an exponential loss function and a weighted Euclidean-based loss function. The experimental results show that the network offers better performance when trained with the latter. However, directly regressing the orientation using a norm-based loss of unit quaternions fails to achieve higher accuracies and results in a larger error margin [ref]124. This is mainly due to the loss function’s inability to represent the actual angular distance of any orientation representation. Sharma et al.  proposed discretising the pose space itself into pose classification labels by quantising along four degrees of freedom as illustrated in Figure 9. Two degrees of freedom controlling the position of the camera (w.r.t. to the spacecraft) along the surface of the enclosing sphere, one degree of freedom denoting the rotation of the camera along the bore-sight angle and one degree of freedom determined by the distance of the camera from the spacecraft. An AlexNet-based  CNN network is used for classifying the spacecraft images into these discretised pose label classes, trained with a Softmax loss function [ref]171. However, this is constrained by the total number of pose class labels to be learned. A larger number of pose labels will need an equivalent number of neurons in the final softmax layer, increasing model size considerably. Also, the method provides an initial guess and requires further refinement to produce more accurate pose estimations. To overcome these limitations, Sharma et al.  later presented Spacecraft Pose Network (SPN), a model with a five-layer CNN backbone followed by three different sub-branches (see Figure 10). The first branch localises the spacecraft in the input image and returns the bounding box. The second branch classifies the target orientation in terms of a probability distribution of discrete classes. It minimises a standard cross entropy loss for a set of closest orientation labels. Finally, the third branch takes the candidate orientation class labels obtained from the previous branch and minimises another cross-entropy loss to yield the relative weighting of each orientation class. The final refined attitude is obtained via quaternion averaging with respect to the computed weights, which represents a soft classification approach. The position is then estimated from the constraints imposed by the detected bounding box and the estimated orientation, using the Gauss–Newton optimisation algorithm . Similar network architecture is also used in . A ResNet50 model  with a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) module  is used as the base CNN network for feature extraction. The first sub-network, the attitude-prediction-subnetwork, estimates the orientation by soft classification and error quaternion regression. The second pose regression sub-network, predicts the position of the spacecraft by direct regression. Finally, the object detection sub-network detects the spacecraft by predicting the enclosing bounding box. The bounding box is used to validate the position and orientation prediction. Proença et al. [ref]124 propose URSONet, a ResNet-based backbone architecture followed by two separate branches for the estimation of the position and orientation (see Figure 11). The position estimation was carried out through a simple regression branch with two fully connected layers while minimising the relative error in the loss function. A continuous orientation estimation via classification with soft-assignment coding was proposed for orientation estimation. Each ground truth label is encoded as a Gaussian random variable in the orientation discrete output space. The network was then trained to output the probability mass function corresponding to the actual orientation. Poss et al.  presented Mobile-URSONet, a mobile-friendly deployable lightweight version of the URSONet. The ResNet backbone was replaced with a MobileNetv2  model, and the number of fully connected layers in the sub-branches was reduced to one (from two). It reduced the number of parameters to a range of 2.2M to 7.4M, 13 times smaller than the URSONet. Moreover, this was achieved without a considerable degradation in performance. Recently, Park et al.  presented SPNv2, improving on the original SPN  for addressing the domain gap problem. SPNv2 has a multi-scale multi-task network architecture with a shared feature extractor following the EfficientPose  network, which is based on the EfficientDet0 feature encoder comprised of an EfficientNet backbone and a Bi-directional FPN (BiFPN) 0 for multi-scale feature fusion. This is followed by multiple prediction heads for each of the tasks learned: binary classification of spacecraft presence, bounding box prediction, target position and orientation estimation, keypoint heatmap regression and pixel-wise binary segmentation of the spacecraft foreground. The results show that joint multi-task learning helps in domain generalisation by preventing the shared feature extractor from learning task-specific features. The authors also propose an online domain refinement (ODR) using target domain images (without labels) to be performed on board spacecraft. The ODR fine-tunes SPNv2 on the target images by minimising the Shannon entropy  on the segmentation task prediction head. The paper also presents different variants of the algorithm by changing the number of parameters in the EfficientNet backbone. The smallest variant with 3.8M parameters has comparable performance to the best-performing variant with 52.5M parameters on the SPEED+ synthetic dataset. . . Garcia et al.  presented a network architecture with two CNN modules: the translation and orientation modules, for pose estimation (see Figure 12). The translation module has a UNet architecture  for predicting the 3D position [x,y,z]𝑥𝑦𝑧[x,y,z] of the target (from the intermediate feature embedding layer) and the 2D spacecraft location in the image [u,v]𝑢𝑣[u,v] (from the final heatmap output). This is then used to generate the enclosing bounding box for the spacecraft and the RoI is cropped out. The orientation module with a CNN regression network predicts the spacecraft orientation [q0,q1,q2,q3]subscript𝑞0subscript𝑞1subscript𝑞2subscript𝑞3[q_{0},q_{1},q_{2},q_{3}] from the cropped RoI. Finally, Musallam et al. evaluated their state-of-the-art absolute pose regression network E-PoseNet  on the SPEED dataset. The model is based on the PoseNet architecture , where the backbone is replaced by a SE(2)-equivariant ResNet18 backbone . The equivariant features encode more geometric information about the input image. Moreover, equivariance to planar transformations\nconstrains the network in a way that can aid generalization, especially due to the weights sharing. Finally, the rotation-equivariant ResNet shows a significant reduction in model size compared to the regular ResNet architecture, to obtain the same feature size.\n\nReference markers found: [119]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]119: parameters or a 3D model of the spacecraft apart from the ground truth pose labels.
