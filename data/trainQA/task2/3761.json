Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

It is worth noting that we choose more\nthan ten competing methods publsihed in recent two years (2020 or 2021) for comparison. This can fully prove the superiority and advanced nature of our proposed method. Comparison results are reported in TABLE 6. We can see that our AGMNet sets a new state of the art on SYSU-MM01, achieving 69.63% Rank- 1 accuracy, 66.11% mAP and 52.24% mINP under all-search mode and 74.68% Rank-1 accuracy, 78.30% mAP and 74.00% mINP under indoor-search mode. Although some methods (FBP-AL, GLMC and HTL 7) introduce part-based convolutional features to improve retrieval performance, AGMNet still shows meaningful performance gain in terms of Rank-1/mAP/mINP (69.63% vs 64.37%, 66.11% vs 63.43% and 52.24% vs 39.54%). SMCL  is most similar to ours in that we both draw support from another modality to bridge the cross-modality gap. It generates the syncretic\nmodality with a light-weight network and learns modality-invariant representations with the triple modality interaction learning strategy. Our model on the other hand generates the aligned grayscale modality with image graying and CycleGAN [ref]51. It simultaneously addresses the modality dicrepancy and luminance gap problems by translating two heterogeneous modalities into one homogeneous modality. The results indicate the single modality feature is much more robust than triple modality-shared feature, i.e. Rank-1 accuracy 69.63% vs 67.39% and mAP value 66.11% vs 61.78%.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: According to the properties of the solutions, the comparison methods can be divided into two groups: GAN-based (i.e. cmGAN [ref]2, D2RL , CoSiGAN , AlignGAN [ref]30, X-Modal , etc.) and shared feature learning (i.e. eDBTR , AGW , FBP-AL , NFS , VSD, MCLNet , etc.) approaches.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
