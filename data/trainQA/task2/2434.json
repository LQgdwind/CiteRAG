      "content": "Paper Title: Combinatorial Gap Theorem and Reductions between Promise CSPs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe fixed template Promise CSP (PCSP) is a recently introduced generalization of the fixed template CSP, motivated by open problems about (in)approximability of SAT and graph coloring   [ref]13.\nThe idea is that each constraint has a strict version and a relaxed version and the problem is (in the search version) to find an assignment satisfying the relaxed constraints given an instance which is satisfiable under the strict constraints (this is the promise). More precisely, the template for PCSP is a pair of similar structures (𝐀,𝐁)𝐀𝐁({\\mathbf{A}},{\\mathbf{B}}), where 𝐀𝐀{\\mathbf{A}}\nspecifies the allowed forms of strict constraints and 𝐁𝐁{\\mathbf{B}} their relaxations (we again refer to Section 4 for precise definitions). Note that PCSP⁡(𝐀,𝐀)PCSP𝐀𝐀\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{A}},{\\mathbf{A}}) is the same problem as CSP⁡(𝐀)CSP𝐀\\operatorname{CSP}({\\mathbf{A}}). Important examples of PCSPs include graph coloring and hypergraph coloring problems, such as PCSP⁡(𝐊n,𝐊m)PCSPsubscript𝐊𝑛subscript𝐊𝑚\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{K}}_{n},{\\mathbf{K}}_{m}), m≥n𝑚𝑛m\\geq n – the problem to find an m𝑚m-coloring of a given n𝑛n-colorable graph, and approximate versions of satisfiability problems such as the (2+ε𝜀\\varepsilon)-SAT problem from . We refer to  [ref]13    for more examples. The complexity classification of fixed template PCSPs beyond CSPs is largely unknown; indeed, even the complexity of PCSP⁡(𝐊n,𝐊m)PCSPsubscript𝐊𝑛subscript𝐊𝑚\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{K}}_{n},{\\mathbf{K}}_{m}) is a long-standing open problem  and it is known only for some choices of parameters n𝑛n, m𝑚m (see  for a recent account). However, an analogue of Theorem 4  and even Theorem 5   is available with a natural generalization of polymorphisms. Denoting Pol⁡(𝐀,𝐁)Pol𝐀𝐁\\operatorname{Pol}({\\mathbf{A}},{\\mathbf{B}}) the set of all polymorphisms of a template (𝐀,𝐁)𝐀𝐁({\\mathbf{A}},{\\mathbf{B}}), the latter theorem can be formulated as follows. If Pol⁡(𝐀1,𝐁1)Polsubscript𝐀1subscript𝐁1\\operatorname{Pol}({\\mathbf{A}}_{1},{\\mathbf{B}}_{1}) has a minion homomorphism to Pol⁡(𝐀2,𝐁2)Polsubscript𝐀2subscript𝐁2\\operatorname{Pol}({\\mathbf{A}}_{2},{\\mathbf{B}}_{2}), then PCSP⁡(𝐀2,𝐁2)PCSPsubscript𝐀2subscript𝐁2\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{A}}_{2},{\\mathbf{B}}_{2}) is reducible to PCSP⁡(𝐀1,𝐁1)PCSPsubscript𝐀1subscript𝐁1\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{A}}_{1},{\\mathbf{B}}_{1}). This theorem is still very useful in the more general PCSP setting. For instance, it gives a reduction of any CSP to PCSP⁡(𝐊3,𝐊4)PCSPsubscript𝐊3subscript𝐊4\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{K}}_{3},{\\mathbf{K}}_{4}) (as essentially shown in , cf. ) and gives a reduction from PCSP⁡(𝐍𝐀𝐄23,𝐍𝐀𝐄n3)PCSPsuperscriptsubscript𝐍𝐀𝐄23superscriptsubscript𝐍𝐀𝐄𝑛3\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{NAE}}_{2}^{3},{\\mathbf{NAE}}_{n}^{3}) (i.e., n𝑛n-coloring a 2-colorable 3-uniform hypergraph), for a certain n𝑛n, to PCSP⁡(𝐊3,𝐊5)PCSPsubscript𝐊3subscript𝐊5\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{K}}_{3},{\\mathbf{K}}_{5}) as shown in  . From NP-hardness of the former problem  one obtains NP-hardness of the latter problem. The algorithmic side of this theorem is discussed in Section 7 of . However, Theorem 6 is very much insufficient for proving NP-hardness of every NP-hard PCSP, e.g., one provably cannot apply it to reduce an NP-hard CSP (such as 3-SAT) to PCSP⁡(𝐍𝐀𝐄23,𝐍𝐀𝐄n3)PCSPsuperscriptsubscript𝐍𝐀𝐄23superscriptsubscript𝐍𝐀𝐄𝑛3\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{NAE}}_{2}^{3},{\\mathbf{NAE}}_{n}^{3}). More widely applicable sufficient conditions for NP-hardness in terms of polymorphisms have been developed in   , or follow from the results in these papers. They are all based on Theorem 2 and its refinements. These conditions cover almost all known NP-complete PCSPs, a notable exception being . On the other hand, these sufficient conditions are not quite satisfactory for two reasons. First, they are not based on a general reduction theorem such as Theorem 6, which limits their applicability and appeal. Second, they use complex NP-hardness results (Theorem 2 and refinements), which, e.g., makes it difficult to reduce a standard NP-complete problem, like 3-SAT, to many NP-hard PCSPs. For instance, if we want to reduce 3-SAT to PCSP⁡(𝐊3,𝐊5)PCSPsubscript𝐊3subscript𝐊5\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{K}}_{3},{\\mathbf{K}}_{5}) using available theory, we first need to perform a sequence of reductions used in a proof of the PCP theorem, then another reduction for the Parallel Repetition Theorem, ending up in the situation of Theorem 2, then further reductions for an improved version of Theorem 2 from , followed by reductions to approximate hypergraph coloring from , finally finishing with reductions provided by Theorem 6 to PCSP⁡(𝐊3,𝐊5)PCSPsubscript𝐊3subscript𝐊5\\operatorname{PCSP}({\\mathbf{K}}_{3},{\\mathbf{K}}_{5}) .\nSuch a long chain of reductions obscures the reasons why the problem is hard.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: The fixed template Promise CSP (PCSP) is a recently introduced generalization of the fixed template CSP, motivated by open problems about (in)approximability of SAT and graph coloring   [ref]13.\nThe idea is that each constraint has a strict version and a relaxed version and the problem is (in the search version) to find an assignment satisfying the relaxed constraints given an\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
