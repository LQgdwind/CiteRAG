Its objective is to predict future stock behavior (e.g., return ratios or prices) by analyzing relevant historical factors. Previous research has explored various machine learning techniques, such as SFM [ref]2, ALSTM , and HIST . However, achieving desirable performance with these methods often requires an ample supply of high-quality data. The challenges posed by high random and homogeneous data make it difficult to meet the requirements for data quality, resulting in elevated forecasting errors and increased uncertainty. Data scarcity in stock forecasting tasks is commonly characterized from two aspects: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and data homogeneity. (1) We first delve into the relationship between stock factors and the return ratio, providing insights into SNR. Figure 1(a) visualizes the Pearson Correlation Coefficients between stock factors and the return ratio, revealing a weak correlation (absolute value less than 0.03) indicative of a low SNR of the factors. This weak correlation is often attributed to randomness and non-stationary speculative behaviors. (2) We explore the behavior of stocks within industry sectors to show data homogeneity’s implications. We discover that stocks within the same industry sector exhibit similar behavior, as shown in Figure 1(b), which reports the average number of large price drop stocks categorized by sectors. As a result, this homogeneity leads to a reduction in the availability of stocks with distinctive informational characteristics. Data scarcity presents inherent challenges that can lead to overfitting, where models exhibit an increased risk of learning shortcuts and spurious correlations, ultimately impacting their predictive performance. The limited availability of data poses a significant hurdle in achieving effective generalization between the training and testing datasets, thereby resulting in compromised overall performance. One straightforward solution to overcome data scarcity is factor augmentation, a technique that involves augmenting the training dataset by introducing minor changes or generating new data points based on specific factors. Drawing inspiration from successful applications of Diffusion Models (DMs) in various domains, such as text-to-image conversion [ref]5 , time-series imputation , and waveform generation , we explore the utilization of DMs for stock forecasting. DMs are generative models consisting of two stages: a diffusion process and a denoising process. The diffusion process parameterizes a Markov chain that progressively introduces noise to the factors until reaching a state of pure noise . Subsequently, during the denoising process, the model aims to restore the original data by predicting the noise generated through the diffusion process. In this study, we look back 8 days and organize recent stock factors as a sequence, leveraging DMs based on transformer architectures 0  to do factor augmentation. We expect that by incorporating augmented factors, our proposed model will exhibit enhanced resilience to data scarcity in the field of stock forecasting. Incorporating DMs for stock factor augmentation presents non-trivial challenges, particularly in the assignment of corresponding labels to the generated factors. While one possible approach is to directly treat labels as a stock factor dimension, this method carries the risk of generating inaccurate results. Explicitly generating labels presents challenges due to the difficulty of accurately matching factors with their corresponding labels, particularly considering the unpredictability of return ratios. To overcome this challenge, we propose to adapt DMs from generation task to supervised-learning task by utilization of a flexible predictor-free conditional factor generator 1 [ref]5 0. The generator is trained with labels as the conditioning, allowing us to anticipate that the generated factors will share the same labels as the original factors. Additionally, we explore the utilization of other types of conditionings (i.e., sectors) to further enhance accuracy. An illustration is shown in Figure 2. To distill new knowledge and information (i.e., stocks in other markets) during augmentation, our proposed framework incorporates transfer learning. Initially, the DM is trained in a large source domain with a diffusion step denoted as\nT𝑇T; during the inference process, instead of generating from a standard normal distribution, we start from data points in the target domain, corrupt them and then denoise to obtain a new data point that is likely in the target domain. However, due to the requirement of a large T𝑇T for DMs to reach a state of pure noise, the low SNR prevalent in stock data poses challenges in achieving accurate recovery as T𝑇T increases. In practical implementation, we limit the corruption of data to a smaller number of steps denoted as T′≪Tmuch-less-thansuperscript𝑇′𝑇T^{\\prime}\\ll T, which we refer to as the editing step. In addition, we have discovered a significant benefit resulting from this mechanism. The phenomenon known as data collision occurs when multiple models utilize the same copy of data simultaneously. In such cases, a surge of capital flowing into the market can lead to the failure of these models in achieving their investment objectives 2. However, through the editing of factors, this issue can be effectively mitigated by introducing new copies of data. To summarize, our approach involves editing samples in the target domain using knowledge derived from a larger source domain. We also propose several improvements to increase the model’s efficiency and decrease the volatility. It is obvious that there is no need to optimize the DM for t>T′𝑡superscript𝑇′t>T^{\\prime}. On top of that, we initialize the DM with T𝑇T to ensure its correctness, but sample training steps t𝑡t from Uniform​{1,2,⋯,T′}Uniform12⋯superscript𝑇′{\\rm Uniform}\\{1,2,\\cdots,T^{\\prime}\\} instead of Uniform​{1,2,⋯,T}Uniform12⋯𝑇{\\rm Uniform}\\{1,2,\\cdots,T\\}. Additionally, we leverage the training loss as a proxy and introduce stronger noise to data points with lower training loss. This loss-guided noise addition mechanism aims help decrease model volatility by mitigating the overfitting issue associated with easily fitted points, in contrast to uniform noise addition. In summary, the contributions are as follows: We reveal the importance of data augmentation in the context of stock forecasting and explore the use of diffusion stock transformer (DiffsFormer for short) to address data scarcity. To adapt DM from generative task to supervised-learning task, we propose to employ ground truth (e.g., return ratio) as the conditioning to enhance the relationship between factors and label. Furthermore, we enhance the flexibility of the guidance by integrating a predictor-free guidance approach. Due to the low SNR of factors, we propose to edit the existing samples in a transfer learning manner instead of synthesizing new ones.\nOne advantage of this mechanism lies in its capacity to distill new knowledge in contrast to methods like random noise augmentation. We verify the effectiveness of DiffsFormer augmented training in CSI300 and CSI800 with eight commonly used machine learning models. The proposed method achieves 7.2% and 27.8% relative improvements in annualized return ratio respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: is to predict future stock behavior (e.g., return ratios or prices) by analyzing relevant historical factors.
