      "content": "Paper Title: Federated Learning for 5G Base Station Traffic Forecasting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTime-series forecasting is an essential task in a wide range of real-life problems, such as weather prediction, energy consumption , sales  and traffic prediction [ref]6. In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in machine learning methods applied to time-series data. Unlike classic methods such as ARIMA-based models, deep learning approaches have shown great success in modeling time-series due to their ability to map non-linear correlations. Neural architectures for modeling time-series data can be classified into three categories : (i) Fully Connected Neural Networks such as MLPs, ii) Recurrent Networks such as RNNs, LSTMs and GRUs and iii) Convolution Networks such as CNNs. In this work, we apply federated time-series analysis on raw LTE data to model the temporal dependence of traffic demand. Traffic forecasting is a vital task in the 5G era, given the rapid traffic growth and evolving patterns over time . In the context of traffic prediction, Trinh et al. [ref]6 compared LSTM to MLP and ARIMA and showed that LSTM significantly outperforms the other models. Feng et al. proposed DeepTP, an LSTM-based network which models the spatial dependence of time-series and temporal changes, demonstrating that the proposed framework surpasses traditional methods such as ARIMA and LSTM without enhancements. Chen et al.  introduced a clustered LSTM-based model for multivariate time-series modeling. Sebastian et al.  suggested a decomposition of time-series into seasonal, trend and cycle components, feeding the resulting vectors into the GRU model. Gao  proposed an enhancement of an LSTM network with stationarity evaluation (SLSTM), specifically designed for 5G network measurements. Pimpinella et al.  focused on predicting long-term traffic peaks in LTE measurements and compared clustered LSTM to Additive Decomposition and Seasonal ARIMA. Finally, in [ref]28, the authors focused on predicting traffic series by integrating exogenous data such as scheduled social events. Although the recent advancements in modeling time-series data, most works focus on centralized learning, which differs significantly from federated learning. In addition, federated time-series forecasting has yet to be explored in-depth, particularly in the context of mobile networks. In this paper, we examine five different model architectures that span the three model categories presented in . Although Transformer and AutoEncoder-based models have shown promising results in time-series forecasting [ref]29 , they are not considered in this study due to their high computational and energy consumption costs. In federated learning, where communication and resource efficiency are critical, the chosen models aim to minimize these costs while maintaining adequate predictive performance. To our knowledge, this is the first study that provides insights using different time-series modeling under federated learning. In addition, although long-term cluster-based training has demonstrated great potential , in this work we focus on federated training for short-term forecasting and leave clustered-based training for future work. Finally, we plan to further integrate exogenous data such as weather information or social events [ref]28 to further benefit the forecasting accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Time-series forecasting is an essential task in a wide range of real-life problems, such as weather prediction, energy consumption , sales  and traffic prediction [ref]6.
