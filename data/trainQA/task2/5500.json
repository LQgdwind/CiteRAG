      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting Sparsity in Pruned Neural Networks to Optimize Large Model Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNVIDIA’s cuSPARSE is designed for sparse matrices seen in scientific\napplications which have extremely high sparsities (>>99%). Therefore, it is\nnot a suitable candidate for the kinds of sparsities observed in neural network\npruning (<<90%). A number of approaches have been proposed that can operate\nin these levels of sparsities. Yang et al. augment merge-based algorithms with\na novel row-based splitting technique to hide memory access\nlatency [ref]12. Hong et al. design spMM and sDDMM\n(used for backward pass of a fully connected layer) that exploit an adaptive\ntiling strategy to reduce global memory access [ref]10.\nGale et al. conduct an extensive survey of the sparsity patterns found in\nmatrices across a variety of deep learning workloads .\nUsing the insights drawn from this study, they design state-of-the-art sparse\nkernels for spMM and sDDMM for deep learning workloads . A\nnumber of approaches have been proposed that enforce a certain sparsity\nstructure. Gray et al. design GPU kernels for block sparse\nmatrices . Chen et al. propose a novel\ncolumn-vector-sparse-encoding for block sparse matrices that provides speedup\nover cuBLAS at sparsities as low as 70% at mixed\nprecision . Dao et al. propose a technique\nto reduce linear maps to a product of diagonal block sparse matrices and design\nkernels for computing their products efficiently [ref]23 .\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: of approaches have been proposed that can operate\nin these levels of sparsities. Yang et al. augment merge-based algorithms with\na novel row-based splitting technique to hide memory access\nlatency [ref]12.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
