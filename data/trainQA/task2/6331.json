      "content": "Paper Title: AROID: Improving Adversarial Robustness through Online Instance-wise Data Augmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRobust training. To mitigate overfitting in AT, many methods other than DA, have been previously proposed. One line of works, IGR , CURE , AdvLC , discovered a connection between adversarial vulnerability and the smoothness of input loss landscape, and promoted robustness by smoothing the input loss landscape. Meanwhile, We et al.  and Chen et al.  found that robust generalization can be improved by a flat weight loss landscape and proposed AWP and SWA, respectively, to smooth the weight loss landscape during AT. RWP 4 and SEAT  were later proposed to further refine AWP and SWA, respectively, to increase robustness. Many works, including MART 0, LAS-AT , ISEAT , considered the difference between individual training instances and improved AT through regularizing in an instance-wise manner. Our proposed approach is also instance-wise, but contrary to existing methods\ntackles robust overfitting via DA instead of robust regularization. As shown in SectionÂ 4.2, it works well alone and, more importantly, complements the above techniques. Data augmentation for standard training.\nAlthough DA has been a common practice in many fields, we only review vision-based DA in this section as it is most related to our work. In computer vision, DA can be generally categorized as: basic, composite and mixup. Basic augmentations refer to a series of image transformations that can be applied independently. They mainly include crop-based (Random Crop , Cropshift , etc.), color-based (Brightness, Contrast, etc.), geometric-based (Rotation, Shear, etc.) and dropout-based (Cutout , Random Erasing 9, etc.) transformations. Composite augmentations denote the composition of basic augmentations. Augmentations are composed into a single policy/schedule usually through two ways: interpolation   and sequencing   . Mixup 7, and analogous works like Cutmix 5, can be considered as a special case of interpolation-based composition, which combines a pair of different images, instead of augmentations, as well as their labels to create a new image and its label. Composite augmentations by design have many hyperparameters to optimize. Most previous works, as well as the pioneering AutoAugment , tackled this issue using automated machine learning (AutoML). DA policies were optimized towards maximizing validation accuracy  [ref]26 [ref]24 , maximizing training loss 8 or matching the distribution density between the original and augmented data  . Optimization here is particularly challenging since DA operations are usually non-differentiable. Major solutions seek to estimate the gradient of DA learning objective w.r.t. the policy generator or DA operations using, e.g., policy gradient methods  8 [ref]26 or reparameterization trick [ref]24 . Alternative optimization techniques include Bayesian optimization  and population-based training . Noticeably, several works like RandAugment  and TrivialAugment  found that if the augmentation space and schedule were appropriately designed, competitive results could be achieved using a simple hyperparameter grid search or fixed hyperparameters.\nThis implies that in standard training these advanced yet complicated methods may not be necessary. However, it remains an open question if simple search can still match these advanced optimization methods in AT.\nOur method is the first automated DA approach specific for AT. We follow the line of policy gradient methods to enable learning DA policies. A key distinction here is that our policy learning objective is designed to guide the learning of DA policies towards improved robustness for AT, while the objective of the above methods is to increase accuracy for standard training.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Most previous works, as well as the pioneering AutoAugment , tackled this issue using automated machine learning (AutoML).
