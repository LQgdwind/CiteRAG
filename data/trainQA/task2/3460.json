      "content": "Paper Title: Do Lessons from Metric Learning Generalize to Image-Caption Retrieval?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNotation.\nWe follow the notation introduced in  [ref]7 .\nWe start with a multi-modal image-caption dataset 𝒟={(xIi,xC1i\\mathcal{D}=\\{(\\textbf{x}_{I}^{i},\\textbf{x}_{C_{1}}^{i}, …, xCki)i,…}i=1N\\textbf{x}_{C_{k}}^{i})^{i},\\dots\\}_{i=1}^{N} that contains N𝑁N image-caption tuples.\nFor each image xIisuperscriptsubscriptx𝐼𝑖\\textbf{x}_{I}^{i}, we have k𝑘k matching/corresponding captions, xC1i,…,xCkisuperscriptsubscriptxsubscript𝐶1𝑖…superscriptsubscriptxsubscript𝐶𝑘𝑖\\textbf{x}_{C_{1}}^{i},\\dots,\\textbf{x}_{C_{k}}^{i}. In the ICR task, either an image or a caption can function as a query.\nGiven a query 𝐪𝐪\\mathbf{q}, the task is to rank all candidates in a candidate set Ω={𝐯i∣i=0,…,m}Ωconditional-setsubscript𝐯𝑖𝑖0…𝑚\\Omega=\\{\\mathbf{v}_{i}\\mid i=0,\\dots,m\\}.\nA matching candidate is denote as 𝐯+superscript𝐯\\mathbf{v}^{+} and a negative candidate(s) as 𝐯−superscript𝐯\\mathbf{v}^{-}.\nFor each query 𝐪𝐪\\mathbf{q}, we can split the candidate set ΩΩ\\Omega into two disjoint subsets: 𝐯+∈𝒫𝐪superscript𝐯subscript𝒫𝐪\\mathbf{v}^{+}\\in\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathbf{q}} (positive candidate set) and 𝐯−∈𝒩𝐪superscript𝐯subscript𝒩𝐪\\mathbf{v}^{-}\\in\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathbf{q}} (negative candidate set), where 𝒩𝐪={𝐯−∣𝐯−∈Ω,𝐯−∉𝒫𝐪}subscript𝒩𝐪conditional-setsuperscript𝐯formulae-sequencesuperscript𝐯Ωsuperscript𝐯subscript𝒫𝐪\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathbf{q}}=\\{\\mathbf{v}^{-}\\mid\\mathbf{v}^{-}\\in\\Omega,\\mathbf{v}^{-}\\notin\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathbf{q}}\\}.\nWe assume a binary match between images and captions, they either match or they do not match. The set with similarity scores for each 𝐯i∈Ωsubscript𝐯𝑖Ω\\mathbf{v}_{i}\\in\\Omega w.r.t. query 𝐪𝐪\\mathbf{q} is defined as: 𝒮Ω𝐪={si=⟨𝐪‖𝐪‖​𝐯i‖𝐯i‖⟩,i=0,…,m}superscriptsubscript𝒮Ω𝐪formulae-sequencesubscript𝑠𝑖delimited-⟨⟩𝐪norm𝐪subscript𝐯𝑖normsubscript𝐯𝑖𝑖0…𝑚\\mathcal{S}_{\\Omega}^{\\mathbf{q}}=\\{s_{i}=\\langle\\frac{\\mathbf{q}}{\\|\\mathbf{q}\\|}\\frac{\\mathbf{v}_{i}}{\\|\\mathbf{v}_{i}\\|}\\rangle,i=0,\\ldots,m\\}.\nWe use cosine similarity as a similarity scoring function.\nSΩ𝐪superscriptsubscript𝑆Ω𝐪S_{\\Omega}^{\\mathbf{q}} consists of two disjoint subsets: S𝒫𝐪superscriptsubscript𝑆𝒫𝐪S_{\\mathcal{P}}^{\\mathbf{q}} and S𝒩𝐪superscriptsubscript𝑆𝒩𝐪S_{\\mathcal{N}}^{\\mathbf{q}}. S𝒫𝐪superscriptsubscript𝑆𝒫𝐪S_{\\mathcal{P}}^{\\mathbf{q}} contains the similarity scores for the positive candidates and S𝒩𝐪superscriptsubscript𝑆𝒩𝐪S_{\\mathcal{N}}^{\\mathbf{q}} the similarity scores for the negative candidates.\nDuring training, we randomly sample a batch ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} with image-caption pairs. Both the images and captions will functions as queries and candidates. Image-caption retrieval.\nThe ICR task can be divided into image-to text (i2t) and text-to-image (t2i) retrieval.\nWe target specific ICR methods that are optimized for the ICR-task only and satisfy three criteria:\n\n\n(1) The methods we use have solely been trained and evaluated on the same benchmark dataset;\n\n(2) the ICR methods we use compute one global representation for both the image and caption; and\n\n(3) the methods do not require additional supervision signals besides the contrastive loss for optimization.\n\n\nBelow we evaluate two ICR methods with different loss functions: VSE++ 2 and VSRN 4.\nIn the online appendix of this work,111https://github.com/MauritsBleeker/ecir-2022-reproducibility-bleeker/blob/master/appendix we provide a detailed description of VSE++ and VSRN. VSE++. The best performing method of VSE++ uses a ResNet-152 5) to compute a global image representation.\nThe caption encoder is a single directed GRU-based 0 encoder.\nFaghri et al. 2 introduce the notion of mining semi hard-negative triplets for the ICR task.\nBy using the hardest negative in the batch for each positive pair (i.e. the negative candidate with the highest similarity score w.r.t. the query), their method outperforms state-of-the-art methods that do not apply this semi-hard negative mining. VSRN. VSRN takes a set of pre-computed image region features as input.\nA Graph Convolutional Network  is used to enhance the relationships between each region vector.\nThe sequence of region feature vectors is put through an RNN network to encode the global image representation.\nVSRN uses the same caption encoder and loss as 2. Other methods.\nFollowing VSE++ and VSRN, the SGRAF 1 and IMRAM  methods have been introduced.\nWe do not use these two methods as they either do not outperform VSRN  or rely on similar principles as VSRN 1.\nThe main recent progress in ICR has been characterized by a shift towards transformer-based  methods.\nTo the best of our knowledge, TREN/TERAN   and VisualSparta  are the only transformer-based ICR methods that are solely optimized using MS-COCO  or Flickr30k 0. We do not use transformer-based methods, as optimizing them does not scale well for a reproduciblity study with moderately sized datasets.\nMethods such as OSCAR , UNITER , Vilbert  and ViLT-B  use additional data sources and/or loss functions for training.\nThey focus on a wide variety of tasks such as visual QA, image captioning, and image retrieval. Loss functions for ICR.\nIn this section we introduce three loss functions for ICR. Triplet loss with semi hard-negative mining. The Triplet loss is commonly used as a loss function for ICR methods 2 4   1 . The Triplet loss with semi-hard negative mining (Triplet loss SH), for a query 𝐪𝐪\\mathbf{q} is defined as: where α𝛼\\alpha is a margin parameter, s−=max⁡(S𝒩𝐪)superscript𝑠superscriptsubscript𝑆𝒩𝐪s^{-}=\\max(S_{\\mathcal{N}}^{\\mathbf{q}}) and s+=s0∈S𝒫𝐪superscript𝑠subscript𝑠0superscriptsubscript𝑆𝒫𝐪s^{+}=s_{0}\\in S_{\\mathcal{P}}^{\\mathbf{q}}.\nHere, 𝒮𝒫𝐪superscriptsubscript𝒮𝒫𝐪\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{P}}^{\\mathbf{q}} only contains one element per query. The Triplet loss SH over the entire training batch is defined as: Triplet loss SH performs a form of soft-negative mining per query by selecting the negative candidate with the highest similarity score w.r.t. the query, we also refer to this as the maximum violating query. For computational efficiency, this soft-negative mining is executed within the context of the training batch ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} and not over the entire training set. As opposed to the definition above, another possibility is to take the Triplet-loss over all triplets in the batch ℬℬ\\mathcal{B}.\nThis is the definition of the standard Triplet-loss : NT-Xent loss. The NT-Xent loss [ref]7 is a loss function commonly used in the field of self-supervised representation learning  [ref]7. A similar function has also been proposed by Zhang and Lu 3 in the context of ICR.\nThe NT-Xent loss is defined as: where τ𝜏\\tau functions as a temperature parameter. As for the Triplet-loss formulation: s+=s0∈S𝒫𝐪superscript𝑠subscript𝑠0superscriptsubscript𝑆𝒫𝐪s^{+}=s_{0}\\in S_{\\mathcal{P}}^{\\mathbf{q}}.\nThe major difference between the Triplet-loss SH is that the NT-Xent loss takes the entire negative candidate set into account. SmoothAP loss.\nThe Average Precision metric w.r.t. a query 𝐪𝐪\\mathbf{q} and candidate set ΩΩ\\Omega is defined as: where ℛ​(i,𝒮)ℛ𝑖𝒮\\mathcal{R}(i,\\mathcal{S}) is a function that returns the ranking of candidate i∈𝒮𝑖𝒮i\\in\\mathcal{S} in the candidate set: Let us introduce the M×M𝑀𝑀M\\times M matrix D𝐷D, where Di​j=si−sjsubscript𝐷𝑖𝑗subscript𝑠𝑖subscript𝑠𝑗D_{ij}=s_{i}-s_{j}. By using the matrix D𝐷D, Eq. 5 can be written as: The indicator function 𝟙​{⋅}1⋅\\mathbbm{1}\\{\\cdot\\} is non-differentiable.\nTo overcome this problem, the indicator function can be replaced by a sigmoid function: By replacing the indicator function 𝟙​{⋅}1⋅\\mathbbm{1}\\{\\cdot\\} by 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}, the Average Precision metric can be approximated with a smooth function: This loss function is called SmoothAP and has been introduced in the context of image retrieval , following similar proposals in document retrieval and learning to rank   3 9.\nThe total loss over a batch ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} can then be formulated as follows: In the online appendix,1 we provide an extended explanation of SmoothAP.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Notation.\nWe follow the notation introduced in  [ref]7 .\nWe start with a multi-modal image-caption dataset 𝒟={(xIi,xC1i\\mathcal{D}=\\{(\\textbf{x}_{I}^{i},\\textbf{x}_{C_{1}}^{i}, …, xCki)i,…}i=1N\\textbf{x}_{C_{k}}^{i})^{i},\\dots\\}_{i=1}^{N} that\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
