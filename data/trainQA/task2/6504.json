      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Algorithms for \\ESMTon Near-Convex Terminal Sets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we consider the \\ESMTproblem when the terminal set is formed by the vertices of 222-CPR n𝑛n-gons, namely {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} and {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\}. As mentioned earlier, {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} is the inner polygon and {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\} is the outer polygon of this set of 222-CPR n𝑛n-gons. In particular, we consider the case when n≥13𝑛13n\\geq 13; for n≤12𝑛12n\\leq 12 these are constant sized input instances and can be solved using any brute-force technique. We also require that the aspect ratio\nλ𝜆\\lambda has a lower bound λ1subscript𝜆1\\lambda_{1}, i.e. we do not want the two polygons to have sides of very similar length. The exact value of λ1subscript𝜆1\\lambda_{1} will be clear during the description of the algorithm. Intuitively, when λ𝜆\\lambda is very large, the SMT should look similar to what was derived in . In other words, (please refer to Figure 5): for some j∈[n]𝑗delimited-[]𝑛j\\in[n], there is a vertical fork connecting the two consecutive inner polygon points Aj,Aj+1subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝐴𝑗1A_{j},A_{j+1} with the two consecutive outer polygon points Bj,Bj+1subscript𝐵𝑗subscript𝐵𝑗1B_{j},B_{j+1} - we refer to this vertical fork as the vertical gadget for the SMT, the other points in {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\} are connected directly via (n−2)𝑛2(n-2) outer polygon edges, the other points in {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} are connected via (n−2)𝑛2(n-2) inner polygon edges. We call such a topology, a singly connected topology as in Figure 5.\nFor the rest of this section, we consider the SMTs for a large enough aspect ratio, λ𝜆\\lambda and show that there is an SMT that must be a realisation of a singly connected topology. We refer to an SMT for the terminal set defined by the vertices of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} and {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\} as the SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} . Without loss of generality, we consider the edge length of any side Ai​Ai+1subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐴𝑖1A_{i}A_{i+1} in {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} to be 111. As we defined the aspect ratio to be λ𝜆\\lambda, any side Bi​Bi+1subscript𝐵𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖1B_{i}B_{i+1} of {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\} must have a side length of λ𝜆\\lambda. Further, we observe that for any SMT 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T}, specifying E​(𝒯)𝐸𝒯E(\\mathcal{T}) sufficiently determines the entire tree, as V​(𝒯)={P|∃Q​ such that ​P​Q∈E​(𝒯)}𝑉𝒯conditional-set𝑃𝑄 such that 𝑃𝑄𝐸𝒯V(\\mathcal{T})=\\{P\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ |\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ \\exists Q\\text{ such that }PQ\\in E(\\mathcal{T})\\}. We start with the following formal definitions: A Steiner topology of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} is a singly connected topology, if it has the following structure: A vertical gadget i.e. five edges {Aj​Sa,Aj+1​Sa,Sa​Sb,Sb​Bj,Sb​Bj+1}subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝑆𝑎subscript𝐴𝑗1subscript𝑆𝑎subscript𝑆𝑎subscript𝑆𝑏subscript𝑆𝑏subscript𝐵𝑗subscript𝑆𝑏subscript𝐵𝑗1\\{A_{j}S_{a},A_{j+1}S_{a},S_{a}S_{b},S_{b}B_{j},S_{b}B_{j+1}\\} for some 1≤j≤n1𝑗𝑛1\\leq j\\leq n, where Sasubscript𝑆𝑎S_{a} and Sbsubscript𝑆𝑏S_{b} are newly introduced Steiner points contained in the isosceles trapezoid {Aj,Aj+1,Bj,Bj+1}subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝐴𝑗1subscript𝐵𝑗subscript𝐵𝑗1\\{A_{j},A_{j+1},B_{j},B_{j+1}\\}. All (n−2)𝑛2(n-2) polygon edges of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} excluding the edge Aj​Aj+1subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝐴𝑗1A_{j}A_{j+1} All (n−2)𝑛2(n-2) polygon edges of {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\} excluding the edge Bj​Bj+1subscript𝐵𝑗subscript𝐵𝑗1B_{j}B_{j+1} We define the notion of a path in an SMT for the vertices of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} and {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\} where the starting point is in {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} and the ending point is in {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\}. An A-B path is a path in a Steiner tree of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} which starts from a vertex in {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} and ends at a vertex in {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\} with all intermediate nodes (if any) being Steiner points. The following Definition and Figure 6 is useful for the design of our algorithm. A counter-clockwise path is a path P1,P2,…​Pmsubscript𝑃1subscript𝑃2…subscript𝑃𝑚P_{1},P_{2},...P_{m} in a Steiner tree such that for all i∈{2,…,m−1},∠​Pi−1​Pi​Pi+1=2​π3formulae-sequence𝑖2…𝑚1∠subscript𝑃𝑖1subscript𝑃𝑖subscript𝑃𝑖12𝜋3i\\in\\{2,\\ldots,m-1\\},\\angle P_{i-1}P_{i}P_{i+1}=\\frac{2\\pi}{3} in the counter-clockwise direction. Similarly, a clockwise path is a path P1,P2,…​Pmsubscript𝑃1subscript𝑃2…subscript𝑃𝑚P_{1},P_{2},...P_{m} in a Steiner tree such that for all i∈{2,…,m−1},∠​Pi−1​Pi​Pi+1=4​π3formulae-sequence𝑖2…𝑚1∠subscript𝑃𝑖1subscript𝑃𝑖subscript𝑃𝑖14𝜋3i\\in\\{2,\\ldots,m-1\\},\\angle P_{i-1}P_{i}P_{i+1}=\\frac{4\\pi}{3} in the counter-clockwise direction. Now, we consider any Steiner point S𝑆S in any SMT. Let P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q be two neighbours of S𝑆S. We now prove that there is no point of the SMT inside the triangle P​S​Q𝑃𝑆𝑄PSQ. Let S𝑆S be a Steiner point in any SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}, with neighbours P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q. Then, no point of the SMT lies inside the triangle P​S​Q𝑃𝑆𝑄PSQ. By the lune property (Proposition 2.3), for any edge P1​Q1subscript𝑃1subscript𝑄1P_{1}Q_{1} in an SMT, for the two circles centred at P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} and at Q1subscript𝑄1Q_{1}, respectively and both having a radius of P1​Q1¯¯subscript𝑃1subscript𝑄1\\overline{P_{1}Q_{1}}, the intersection region does not contain any point of the SMT. Let E𝐸E and F𝐹F be points on the internal angle bisector of ∠​P​S​Q∠𝑃𝑆𝑄\\angle PSQ, such that ∠​S​P​E=∠​S​Q​F=π3∠𝑆𝑃𝐸∠𝑆𝑄𝐹𝜋3\\angle SPE=\\angle SQF=\\frac{\\pi}{3} as shown in Figure 7. Since E𝐸E and F𝐹F are points on the angle bisector of ∠​P​S​Q∠𝑃𝑆𝑄\\angle PSQ, ∠​P​S​E=∠​Q​S​F=π3∠𝑃𝑆𝐸∠𝑄𝑆𝐹𝜋3\\angle PSE=\\angle QSF=\\frac{\\pi}{3}. Hence, triangles P​S​E𝑃𝑆𝐸PSE and Q​S​F𝑄𝑆𝐹QSF are equilateral triangles. Since P​S𝑃𝑆PS is an edge in the SMT, by the lune property, the intersection of the circles centred at P𝑃P and S𝑆S, both with radius P​S¯¯𝑃𝑆\\overline{PS} contain no point inside which is a part of the SMT. Since the lune contains the entire equilateral triangle P​S​E𝑃𝑆𝐸PSE, no point of the SMT lies inside triangle P​S​E𝑃𝑆𝐸PSE. Similarly, no point of the SMT lies inside the triangle Q​S​F𝑄𝑆𝐹QSF. Further, as ∠​P​S​Q=2​π3∠𝑃𝑆𝑄2𝜋3\\angle PSQ=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}, ∠​S​P​Q+∠​S​Q​P=π3∠𝑆𝑃𝑄∠𝑆𝑄𝑃𝜋3\\angle SPQ+\\angle SQP=\\frac{\\pi}{3}. This means ∠​S​P​Q,∠​S​Q​P<π3∠𝑆𝑃𝑄∠𝑆𝑄𝑃𝜋3\\angle SPQ,\\angle SQP<\\frac{\\pi}{3}. Therefore, as ∠​S​P​E=∠​S​Q​F=π3∠𝑆𝑃𝐸∠𝑆𝑄𝐹𝜋3\\angle SPE=\\angle SQF=\\frac{\\pi}{3}, E𝐸E and F𝐹F must lie outside the triangle P​S​Q𝑃𝑆𝑄PSQ. This implies that the triangle P​S​Q𝑃𝑆𝑄PSQ is covered by the union of the triangles P​S​E𝑃𝑆𝐸PSE and Q​S​F𝑄𝑆𝐹QSF. As no point of the SMT lies in triangles P​S​E𝑃𝑆𝐸PSE and Q​S​F𝑄𝑆𝐹QSF, triangle P​S​Q𝑃𝑆𝑄PSQ must contain no points of the SMT as well. Next, we show that in an SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}  there cannot be any Steiner point, in the interior of the polygon {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}, that is a direct neighbour of some point Bksubscript𝐵𝑘B_{k} in the polygon {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\}. For any SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} , there cannot exist a Steiner point S𝑆S lying in the interior of the polygon {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} such that S​Bk𝑆subscript𝐵𝑘SB_{k} is an edge in an SMT for some Bk∈{Bi}subscript𝐵𝑘subscript𝐵𝑖B_{k}\\in\\{B_{i}\\}. For the sake of contradiction, we assume that for some SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}  there exists a Steiner point S𝑆S lying in the interior of the polygon {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} such that S​Bk𝑆subscript𝐵𝑘SB_{k} is an edge in the SMT for some Bk∈{Bi}subscript𝐵𝑘subscript𝐵𝑖B_{k}\\in\\{B_{i}\\}. Let Am​Am+1subscript𝐴𝑚subscript𝐴𝑚1A_{m}A_{m+1} be the edge such that S​Bk𝑆subscript𝐵𝑘SB_{k} intersects Am​Am+1subscript𝐴𝑚subscript𝐴𝑚1A_{m}A_{m+1}. Without loss of generality, assume that Amsubscript𝐴𝑚A_{m} is closer to Bksubscript𝐵𝑘B_{k} than Am+1subscript𝐴𝑚1A_{m+1}. Therefore ∠​Bk​Am​S>∠​Bk​Am​Am+1≥π2+πn>π2∠subscript𝐵𝑘subscript𝐴𝑚𝑆∠subscript𝐵𝑘subscript𝐴𝑚subscript𝐴𝑚1𝜋2𝜋𝑛𝜋2\\angle B_{k}A_{m}S>\\angle B_{k}A_{m}A_{m+1}\\geq\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\frac{\\pi}{n}>\\frac{\\pi}{2}. This means that Bk​Ssubscript𝐵𝑘𝑆B_{k}S is the longest edge in the triangle Bk​S​Amsubscript𝐵𝑘𝑆subscript𝐴𝑚B_{k}SA_{m}. Therefore we can remove the edge Bk​Ssubscript𝐵𝑘𝑆B_{k}S from the SMT and replace it with either Bk​Amsubscript𝐵𝑘subscript𝐴𝑚B_{k}A_{m} or S​Am𝑆subscript𝐴𝑚SA_{m} to get another tree connecting the terminal set with a shorter total length than what we started with, which is a contradiction. We further analyze SMTs for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}. Let 𝒱={Aj,Aj+1,…,Ak}𝒱subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝐴𝑗1…subscript𝐴𝑘\\mathcal{V}=\\{A_{j},A_{j+1},\\ldots,A_{k}\\} be the interval of consecutive vertices of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} lying between Ajsubscript𝐴𝑗A_{j} and Aksubscript𝐴𝑘A_{k} (which includes Aj+1subscript𝐴𝑗1A_{j+1}) such that Ajsubscript𝐴𝑗A_{j} is distinct from Ak+1subscript𝐴𝑘1A_{k+1}. Let U𝑈U be any point on the line segment Ak​Ak+1subscript𝐴𝑘subscript𝐴𝑘1A_{k}A_{k+1}. Then an SMT of 𝒱∪{U}𝒱𝑈\\mathcal{V}\\cup\\{U\\} is 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T}, with E​(𝒯)={Aj​Aj+1,Aj+1​Aj+2,…,Ak−1​Ak}∪{Ak​U}𝐸𝒯subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝐴𝑗1subscript𝐴𝑗1subscript𝐴𝑗2…subscript𝐴𝑘1subscript𝐴𝑘subscript𝐴𝑘𝑈E(\\mathcal{T})=\\{A_{j}A_{j+1},A_{j+1}A_{j+2},\\ldots,A_{k-1}A_{k}\\}\\cup\\{A_{k}U\\}. For the sake of contradiction, assume that there exists an SMT 𝒯′superscript𝒯′\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime} of 𝒱∪{U}𝒱𝑈\\mathcal{V}\\cup\\{U\\} such that |𝒯′|<|𝒯|superscript𝒯′𝒯|\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}|<|\\mathcal{T}|. From , we know that 𝒯Asubscript𝒯𝐴\\mathcal{T}_{A}, with E​(𝒯A)={Aj​Aj+1,Aj+1​Aj+2,…,Aj−2​Aj−1}𝐸subscript𝒯𝐴subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝐴𝑗1subscript𝐴𝑗1subscript𝐴𝑗2…subscript𝐴𝑗2subscript𝐴𝑗1E(\\mathcal{T}_{A})=\\{A_{j}A_{j+1},A_{j+1}A_{j+2},\\ldots,A_{j-2}A_{j-1}\\} (i.e. all edges of polygon {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} except Aj−1​Ajsubscript𝐴𝑗1subscript𝐴𝑗A_{j-1}A_{j}) is an SMT of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}. Since U∈Ak​Ak+1∈E​(𝒯A)𝑈subscript𝐴𝑘subscript𝐴𝑘1𝐸subscript𝒯𝐴U\\in A_{k}A_{k+1}\\in E(\\mathcal{T}_{A}), 𝒯Asubscript𝒯𝐴\\mathcal{T}_{A} must also be an SMT of {Ai}∪{U}subscript𝐴𝑖𝑈\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{U\\}. However, 𝒯Asubscript𝒯𝐴\\mathcal{T}_{A} can be partitioned as 𝒯A=𝒯⊎𝒯1subscript𝒯𝐴⊎𝒯subscript𝒯1\\mathcal{T}_{A}=\\mathcal{T}\\uplus\\mathcal{T}_{1}, where E​(𝒯1)={U​Ak+1}∪{Ak+1​Ak+2,…,Aj−2​Aj−1}𝐸subscript𝒯1𝑈subscript𝐴𝑘1subscript𝐴𝑘1subscript𝐴𝑘2…subscript𝐴𝑗2subscript𝐴𝑗1E(\\mathcal{T}_{1})=\\{UA_{k+1}\\}\\cup\\{A_{k+1}A_{k+2},\\ldots,A_{j-2}A_{j-1}\\}.\nHowever, as 𝒯′superscript𝒯′\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime} is assumed to be of shorter total length than 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T}, 𝒯′∪𝒯1superscript𝒯′subscript𝒯1\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}\\cup\\mathcal{T}_{1} is a tree, containing {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} as a vertex subset, which has a shorter total length than 𝒯Asubscript𝒯𝐴\\mathcal{T}_{A}, contradicting the optimality of 𝒯Asubscript𝒯𝐴\\mathcal{T}_{A}. We proceed by showing that in any SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}  there exists at least one A-B path which is also a counter-clockwise path. Symmetrically, we also show that for any SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}  there exists another clockwise A-B path which consists of only clockwise turns. We can intuitively see that this is true because, if all clockwise paths starting at a vertex in {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} also ended in a vertex in {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}, there would be enough paths to form a cycle, which is not possible in a tree. In any SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} , there exists an A-B path which is also a clockwise path and there exists an A-B path which is also a counter-clockwise path. For the sake of contradiction, assume that for some SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}  there is no A-B path which is a counter-clockwise path. We pick an arbitrary vertex Ai1∈{Ai}subscript𝐴subscript𝑖1subscript𝐴𝑖A_{i_{1}}\\in\\{A_{i}\\} such that it is connected to at least one Steiner point (say Si1subscript𝑆subscript𝑖1S_{i_{1}}). We consider the counter-clockwise path, 𝒞1subscript𝒞1\\mathcal{C}_{1} starting from Ai1​Si1subscript𝐴subscript𝑖1subscript𝑆subscript𝑖1A_{i_{1}}S_{i_{1}} and ending at the first terminal point in the counter-clockwise path. By assumption, there can be no vertex of {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\} in 𝒞1subscript𝒞1\\mathcal{C}_{1}, hence the endpoint must be a vertex in {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}. Let Ai2subscript𝐴subscript𝑖2A_{i_{2}} be the other endpoint of 𝒞1subscript𝒞1\\mathcal{C}_{1}. By definition, the penultimate vertex in this counter-clockwise path must be a Steiner point, we call it Si2subscript𝑆subscript𝑖2S_{i_{2}}. We again consider the counter-clockwise path starting from Ai2​Si2subscript𝐴subscript𝑖2subscript𝑆subscript𝑖2A_{i_{2}}S_{i_{2}}, and similarly, let Ai3subscript𝐴subscript𝑖3A_{i_{3}} be the first terminal that is encountered in this path. The penultimate vertex in this counter-clockwise path must be a Steiner point, we call it Si3subscript𝑆subscript𝑖3S_{i_{3}}. We can repeat this procedure indefinitely to obtain Ai4,Ai5,Ai6,…subscript𝐴subscript𝑖4subscript𝐴subscript𝑖5subscript𝐴subscript𝑖6…A_{i_{4}},A_{i_{5}},A_{i_{6}},\\ldots as there are no counter-clockwise A-B paths. However, as {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} has n𝑛n vertices, there must be a repetition of vertices among Ai1,Ai2,Ai3,…,Ain+1subscript𝐴subscript𝑖1subscript𝐴subscript𝑖2subscript𝐴subscript𝑖3…subscript𝐴subscript𝑖𝑛1A_{i_{1}},A_{i_{2}},A_{i_{3}},\\ldots,A_{i_{n+1}}, implying the existence of a cycle in the SMT, which is a contradiction. This symmetrically implies that there must also be a clockwise A-B path. Our next step is to bound the number of ‘connections’ that connect the inner polygon {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} and the outer polygon {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\} for a large aspect ratio, λ𝜆\\lambda. As λ𝜆\\lambda increases, the area of the annular region between the two polygons increases as well. Therefore, an increase in the number of connections would lead to a longer total length of the SMT considered. Consequently, we will prove that after a certain positive constant λ1subscript𝜆1\\lambda_{1}, for λ>λ1𝜆subscript𝜆1\\lambda>\\lambda_{1} any SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}  will have a single ‘connection’ between the two polygons. Moreover,  gives us an evidence that as λ→∞→𝜆\\lambda\\rightarrow\\infty, there will indeed be a single connection connecting the outer polygon and the inner polygon for n≥12𝑛12n\\geq 12. We can formalize this notion of existence of a single ‘connection’ with the following lemma.\n For any SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}  with n≥13𝑛13n\\geq 13 and λ>λ1𝜆subscript𝜆1\\lambda>\\lambda_{1}, the number of edges needed to be removed in order to disconnect {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} and {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\} is 1, where For the sake of contradiction, assume that for some SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} , there are at least two distinct edges in that SMT, which are needed to be removed in order to disconnect {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} and {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\}. We start with a claim. A counter-clockwise A-B path in any SMT of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} must have an edge of length greater than λ𝜆\\lambda. We consider a generic setting, where 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} is an SMT of some set of terminal points 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}. Let H∈V​(𝒯)𝐻𝑉𝒯H\\in V(\\mathcal{T}) be vertex of 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T}. If 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} be a counter-clockwise path starting from H𝐻H such that no edge in the counter clockwise path has a length of more than r𝑟r, for some r∈ℝ+𝑟superscriptℝr\\in\\mathbb{R}^{+}. Due to Lemma 2.4 (1) of , we know that 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is contained entirely in the circle centred at H𝐻H with radius 2​r2𝑟2r. In our case, any vertex in {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} and any vertex in {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\} are separated by the distance of at least λ−12​sin⁡πn𝜆12𝜋𝑛\\dfrac{\\lambda-1}{2\\sin{\\frac{\\pi}{n}}}. Therefore, by the above fact, the maximum edge length in a counter-clockwise A-B path of any SMT of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} must be at least λ−14​sin⁡πn𝜆14𝜋𝑛\\dfrac{\\lambda-1}{4\\sin{\\frac{\\pi}{n}}}. Moreover, we have λ>λ1𝜆subscript𝜆1\\lambda>\\lambda_{1}. Therefore λ>11−4​sin⁡πn⟹λ−14​sin⁡πn>λ𝜆114𝜋𝑛𝜆14𝜋𝑛𝜆\\lambda>\\dfrac{1}{1-4\\sin{\\frac{\\pi}{n}}}\\implies\\dfrac{\\lambda-1}{4\\sin{\\frac{\\pi}{n}}}>\\lambda. Hence, a counter-clockwise A-B path in any SMT of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} must have one edge greater than λ𝜆\\lambda. This proves the claim. Now, for any SMT of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}, let 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} be a counter-clockwise A-B path (this exists due to Lemma 3.12). From Claim 2, we know that there is an edge e𝑒e in 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}, with a length greater than λ𝜆\\lambda. On removing the edge e𝑒e, the SMT splits into a forest of two trees. Let the trees be 𝒯xsubscript𝒯𝑥\\mathcal{T}_{x} and 𝒯ysubscript𝒯𝑦\\mathcal{T}_{y}. As we assumed that there are two edges required to disconnect {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} and {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\}, there must exist an A-B path in either 𝒯xsubscript𝒯𝑥\\mathcal{T}_{x} or 𝒯ysubscript𝒯𝑦\\mathcal{T}_{y}. Without loss of generality, let 𝒯xsubscript𝒯𝑥\\mathcal{T}_{x} contain an A-B path, and hence 𝒯xsubscript𝒯𝑥\\mathcal{T}_{x} contains at least one point from {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} and at least one point from {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\}. Further, 𝒯ysubscript𝒯𝑦\\mathcal{T}_{y} must contain at least one terminal point (as it must contain all terminal points in one of the sides of the removed edge e𝑒e). If 𝒯ysubscript𝒯𝑦\\mathcal{T}_{y} contains a point from {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}, then the polygon {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} has vertices both from 𝒯xsubscript𝒯𝑥\\mathcal{T}_{x} and 𝒯ysubscript𝒯𝑦\\mathcal{T}_{y}; otherwise, if 𝒯ysubscript𝒯𝑦\\mathcal{T}_{y} contains a point from {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\}, then the polygon {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\} has vertices both from 𝒯xsubscript𝒯𝑥\\mathcal{T}_{x} and 𝒯ysubscript𝒯𝑦\\mathcal{T}_{y}. This means that either the polygon {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} or the polygon {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\} will contain at least one node from each of 𝒯xsubscript𝒯𝑥\\mathcal{T}_{x} and 𝒯ysubscript𝒯𝑦\\mathcal{T}_{y}. Further, as any given vertex must be either in 𝒯xsubscript𝒯𝑥\\mathcal{T}_{x} or in 𝒯ysubscript𝒯𝑦\\mathcal{T}_{y}, either {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} or {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\} must contain two consecutive vertices Uisubscript𝑈𝑖U_{i} and Ui+1subscript𝑈𝑖1U_{i+1} such that one of them is in 𝒯xsubscript𝒯𝑥\\mathcal{T}_{x} and the other is in 𝒯ysubscript𝒯𝑦\\mathcal{T}_{y}. We simply connect Uisubscript𝑈𝑖U_{i} and Ui+1subscript𝑈𝑖1U_{i+1} by the polygon edge which is of length 111 (if Ui,Ui+1∈{Ai}subscript𝑈𝑖subscript𝑈𝑖1subscript𝐴𝑖U_{i},U_{i+1}\\in\\{A_{i}\\}) or of length λ𝜆\\lambda (if Ui,Ui+1∈{Bi}subscript𝑈𝑖subscript𝑈𝑖1subscript𝐵𝑖U_{i},U_{i+1}\\in\\{B_{i}\\}), giving us back a tree 𝒯′superscript𝒯′\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}containing all the terminals. However we discarded an edge of length greater than λ𝜆\\lambda and added back an edge of length at most λ𝜆\\lambda in this process, which means that the total length of 𝒯′superscript𝒯′\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime} is strictly less than the SMT we started with. This is a contradiction. We now proceed to further investigate the connectivity of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} and {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\}. Consider an SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}  for n≥13𝑛13n\\geq 13 and λ≥λ1𝜆subscript𝜆1\\lambda\\geq\\lambda_{1}. There must exist j∈[n]𝑗delimited-[]𝑛j\\in[n] and a Steiner point S1subscript𝑆1S_{1}, such that terminals Aj,Aj+1subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝐴𝑗1A_{j},A_{j+1} form a path Ajsubscript𝐴𝑗A_{j}, S1subscript𝑆1S_{1}, Aj+1subscript𝐴𝑗1A_{j+1} in the SMT and each A-B path passes through S1subscript𝑆1S_{1}; where From Lemma 3.12, we know that there exists one clockwise A-B path and one counterclockwise A-B path in any SMT of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}. Let a clockwise A-B path start from Arsubscript𝐴𝑟A_{r} and a counter-clockwise A-B path start from Alsubscript𝐴𝑙A_{l}. Further following from Lemma 3.14, as there is one edge common to all A-B paths, the clockwise A-B path from Arsubscript𝐴𝑟A_{r} and the counter-clockwise A-B path from Alsubscript𝐴𝑙A_{l} must share a common edge S1​S2subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2S_{1}S_{2}. Therefore, each A-B path must pass through S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} and S2subscript𝑆2S_{2}. Without loss of generality we assume that point S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} is closer to the polygon {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} than S2subscript𝑆2S_{2}. This means S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} is either a Stiener point or a terminal vertex of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}. S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} is not a vertex in {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} For the sake of contradiction, we assume that S1subscript𝑆1S_{1}\nto be a vertex in {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}, let S1=Aksubscript𝑆1subscript𝐴𝑘S_{1}=A_{k} in some SMT 𝒯0subscript𝒯0\\mathcal{T}_{0}. We disconnect the edge S1​S2subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2S_{1}S_{2} from 𝒯0subscript𝒯0\\mathcal{T}_{0}, which results in the formation of a forest of two trees 𝒯xsubscript𝒯𝑥\\mathcal{T}_{x} and 𝒯ysubscript𝒯𝑦\\mathcal{T}_{y} such that S1=Ak∈𝒯xsubscript𝑆1subscript𝐴𝑘subscript𝒯𝑥S_{1}=A_{k}\\in\\mathcal{T}_{x} and S2∈𝒯ysubscript𝑆2subscript𝒯𝑦S_{2}\\in\\mathcal{T}_{y}. 𝒯xsubscript𝒯𝑥\\mathcal{T}_{x} must contain all vertices of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} and 𝒯ysubscript𝒯𝑦\\mathcal{T}_{y} must contain all vertices of {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\}, as there would be an A-B path in the graph otherwise (contradicting that S1​S2subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2S_{1}S_{2} disconnects {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} and {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\}). We replace 𝒯xsubscript𝒯𝑥\\mathcal{T}_{x} with the SMT of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}, which is also an MST (from ). Since all MST’s are of the same length, we choose such an MST in which Aksubscript𝐴𝑘A_{k} is not a leaf node. This means Ak−1​Aksubscript𝐴𝑘1subscript𝐴𝑘A_{k-1}A_{k} and Ak​Ak+1subscript𝐴𝑘subscript𝐴𝑘1A_{k}A_{k+1} are edges in the chosen MST of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}. We now add back the edge Ak​S2subscript𝐴𝑘subscript𝑆2A_{k}S_{2}, resulting in a connected tree 𝒯0′superscriptsubscript𝒯0′\\mathcal{T}_{0}^{\\prime} of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}. Since we replaced the tree 𝒯xsubscript𝒯𝑥\\mathcal{T}_{x} with an SMT of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}, the total length of the 𝒯0′superscriptsubscript𝒯0′\\mathcal{T}_{0}^{\\prime} must not be more than the total length of the 𝒯0subscript𝒯0\\mathcal{T}_{0}. However, we observe that Aksubscript𝐴𝑘A_{k} has three neighbours in 𝒯0′superscriptsubscript𝒯0′\\mathcal{T}_{0}^{\\prime}, which are Ak+1,Ak−1,S2subscript𝐴𝑘1subscript𝐴𝑘1subscript𝑆2A_{k+1},A_{k-1},S_{2}. However ∠​Ak−1​Ak​Ak+1>2​π3∠subscript𝐴𝑘1subscript𝐴𝑘subscript𝐴𝑘12𝜋3\\angle A_{k-1}A_{k}A_{k+1}>\\frac{2\\pi}{3}. This means either ∠​S2​Ak​Ak+1<2​π3∠subscript𝑆2subscript𝐴𝑘subscript𝐴𝑘12𝜋3\\angle S_{2}A_{k}A_{k+1}<\\frac{2\\pi}{3} or ∠​Ak−1​Ak​S2<2​π3∠subscript𝐴𝑘1subscript𝐴𝑘subscript𝑆22𝜋3\\angle A_{k-1}A_{k}S_{2}<\\frac{2\\pi}{3}. But due to Proposition 2.1, this cannot form an SMT. Therefore 𝒯0′superscriptsubscript𝒯0′\\mathcal{T}_{0}^{\\prime} is not optimal; and hence, 𝒯0subscript𝒯0\\mathcal{T}_{0} cannot be optimal as well. This proves the claim. Therefore, S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} must be a Steiner point. Let P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q be the neighbours of S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} other than S2subscript𝑆2S_{2}, such that ∠​P​S1​S2∠𝑃subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2\\angle PS_{1}S_{2} is a clockwise turn while ∠​Q​S1​S2∠𝑄subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2\\angle QS_{1}S_{2} is a counter-clockwise turn. This means that the clockwise A-B path from Arsubscript𝐴𝑟A_{r} passes through P𝑃P and the counter-clockwise A-B path from Alsubscript𝐴𝑙A_{l} passes through Q𝑄Q. We prove that P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q are consecutive vertices of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} in some SMT of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}. P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q cannot simultaneously lie in the interior of the polygon {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}. We assume for the sake of contradiction that both P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q lie in the interior of the polygon {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}. On deleting the edge S1​S2subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2S_{1}S_{2}, the SMT of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} splits into two trees 𝒯1subscript𝒯1\\mathcal{T}_{1} (rooted at S1subscript𝑆1S_{1}) and 𝒯2subscript𝒯2\\mathcal{T}_{2} (rooted at S2subscript𝑆2S_{2}). Further, as all A-B paths pass through S1​S2subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2S_{1}S_{2}, all vertices of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} must be in 𝒯1subscript𝒯1\\mathcal{T}_{1} whereas all vertices of {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\} must lie in 𝒯2subscript𝒯2\\mathcal{T}_{2}. Further, 𝒯1subscript𝒯1\\mathcal{T}_{1} must be the SMT of {Ai}∪{S1}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝑆1\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{S_{1}\\} and 𝒯2subscript𝒯2\\mathcal{T}_{2} must be the SMT of {Bi}∪{S2}subscript𝐵𝑖subscript𝑆2\\{B_{i}\\}\\cup\\{S_{2}\\}. Case I: One point in {S1,S2}subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2\\{S_{1},S_{2}\\} lies in the interior of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} and the other point lies in the exterior of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}: This means that the edge S1​S2subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2S_{1}S_{2} crosses some polygon edge of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}, call it Am​Am+1subscript𝐴𝑚subscript𝐴𝑚1A_{m}A_{m+1}. Let D𝐷D be the intersection of Am​Am+1subscript𝐴𝑚subscript𝐴𝑚1A_{m}A_{m+1} and S1​S2subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2S_{1}S_{2}. We replace 𝒯1subscript𝒯1\\mathcal{T}_{1} with an MST of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} that contains the edge Am​Am+1subscript𝐴𝑚subscript𝐴𝑚1A_{m}A_{m+1} (this can never lead to increase in total tree length due to ) and remove the line segment S1​Dsubscript𝑆1𝐷S_{1}D from 𝒯2subscript𝒯2\\mathcal{T}_{2}. This forms a tree connecting the terminal set {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} which has a total length smaller than the SMT we started with, which is a contradiction. Case II: Both S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} and S2subscript𝑆2S_{2} lie in the interior of polygon {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}: We further consider two cases for this: Consider that there is at least one polygon edge Am​Am+1subscript𝐴𝑚subscript𝐴𝑚1A_{m}A_{m+1} of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} such that it does not intersect with 𝒯2subscript𝒯2\\mathcal{T}_{2}. Then we can replace 𝒯1subscript𝒯1\\mathcal{T}_{1} by the MST of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} which does not contain the edge Am​Am+1subscript𝐴𝑚subscript𝐴𝑚1A_{m}A_{m+1} without reducing the total edge. However, this will be a connecting tree of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} with a smaller total length than the tree we started with (as we had removed the edge S1​S2subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2S_{1}S_{2} previously), which is a contradiction. Now, consider that all polygon edges of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} intersect with some edge in 𝒯2subscript𝒯2\\mathcal{T}_{2}. Since 𝒯2subscript𝒯2\\mathcal{T}_{2} is rooted at S2subscript𝑆2S_{2} which lies in the interior of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}, there must be n𝑛n distinct edges crossing the polygon {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}. However, 𝒯2subscript𝒯2\\mathcal{T}_{2} must be the SMT of the points {S2}∪{Bi}subscript𝑆2subscript𝐵𝑖\\{S_{2}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}, which means there can be at most (n−1)𝑛1(n-1) Steiner points other than S2subscript𝑆2S_{2} (from Proposition 2.1). Therefore, one of these n𝑛n edges must have a point in {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\} as one of its endpoints, contradicting Observation 3.3. Case III: Both S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} and S2subscript𝑆2S_{2} lie in the exterior of polygon {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}: This means that the edges S1​Psubscript𝑆1𝑃S_{1}P and S1​Qsubscript𝑆1𝑄S_{1}Q intersect the polygon edges of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}. Further, from Observation 3.3, there cannot be any terminal inside the triangle S1​P​Qsubscript𝑆1𝑃𝑄S_{1}PQ. Hence, S1​Psubscript𝑆1𝑃S_{1}P and S1​Qsubscript𝑆1𝑄S_{1}Q must intersect the same polygon edge of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} (otherwise intermediate vertices from {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} would lie in the triangle S1​P​Qsubscript𝑆1𝑃𝑄S_{1}PQ). Let this edge be At​At+1subscript𝐴𝑡subscript𝐴𝑡1A_{t}A_{t+1}. Let P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} and Q1subscript𝑄1Q_{1} be the points of intersection of At​At+1subscript𝐴𝑡subscript𝐴𝑡1A_{t}A_{t+1} with S1​Psubscript𝑆1𝑃S_{1}P and S1​Qsubscript𝑆1𝑄S_{1}Q respectively. We now remove the line segments S1​P1subscript𝑆1subscript𝑃1S_{1}P_{1} and S1​Q1subscript𝑆1subscript𝑄1S_{1}Q_{1} from 𝒯1subscript𝒯1\\mathcal{T}_{1}. This results in another split into two connected trees 𝒯Psubscript𝒯𝑃\\mathcal{T}_{P} (containing P1subscript𝑃1P_{1}, P𝑃P and a subset of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}) and 𝒯Qsubscript𝒯𝑄\\mathcal{T}_{Q} (containing Q1subscript𝑄1Q_{1}, Q𝑄Q and the remaining vertices of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}). We observe that the terminals in 𝒯Psubscript𝒯𝑃\\mathcal{T}_{P} and 𝒯Qsubscript𝒯𝑄\\mathcal{T}_{Q} form consecutive intervals of the edges in {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}. To see why, consider the opposite, i.e. there are vertices Ai1,Ai2,Ai3,Ai4subscript𝐴subscript𝑖1subscript𝐴subscript𝑖2subscript𝐴subscript𝑖3subscript𝐴subscript𝑖4A_{i_{1}},A_{i_{2}},A_{i_{3}},A_{i_{4}} appearing in that order in {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} such that Ai1,Ai3∈𝒯Psubscript𝐴subscript𝑖1subscript𝐴subscript𝑖3subscript𝒯𝑃A_{i_{1}},A_{i_{3}}\\in\\mathcal{T}_{P} whereas Ai2,Ai4∈𝒯Qsubscript𝐴subscript𝑖2subscript𝐴subscript𝑖4subscript𝒯𝑄A_{i_{2}},A_{i_{4}}\\in\\mathcal{T}_{Q}. As 𝒯Psubscript𝒯𝑃\\mathcal{T}_{P} and 𝒯Qsubscript𝒯𝑄\\mathcal{T}_{Q} lie in the interior of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}, the path from Ai1subscript𝐴subscript𝑖1A_{i_{1}} to Ai3subscript𝐴subscript𝑖3A_{i_{3}} in 𝒯Psubscript𝒯𝑃\\mathcal{T}_{P} must cross the path from Ai2subscript𝐴subscript𝑖2A_{i_{2}} to Ai4subscript𝐴subscript𝑖4A_{i_{4}} in 𝒯Qsubscript𝒯𝑄\\mathcal{T}_{Q}. However, there cannot be crossing paths in the original SMT of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} (due to Proposition 2.1). Let {Aw,Aw+1,…,At}subscript𝐴𝑤subscript𝐴𝑤1…subscript𝐴𝑡\\{A_{w},A_{{w}+1},\\ldots,A_{t}\\} be the terminals in 𝒯Psubscript𝒯𝑃\\mathcal{T}_{P} and the remaining terminals in {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} are in 𝒯Qsubscript𝒯𝑄\\mathcal{T}_{Q}. Again, let 𝒯P′superscriptsubscript𝒯𝑃′\\mathcal{T}_{P}^{\\prime}, 𝒯Q′superscriptsubscript𝒯𝑄′\\mathcal{T}_{Q}^{\\prime} be defined as: and From Observation 3.3, we know that 𝒯P′superscriptsubscript𝒯𝑃′\\mathcal{T}_{P}^{\\prime} is the SMT of {Aw,Aw+1,…,At}∪{P1}subscript𝐴𝑤subscript𝐴𝑤1…subscript𝐴𝑡subscript𝑃1\\{A_{w},A_{{w}+1},\\ldots,A_{t}\\}\\cup\\{P_{1}\\} and 𝒯Q′superscriptsubscript𝒯𝑄′\\mathcal{T}_{Q}^{\\prime} is the SMT of {At+1,At+2,…,Aw−1}∪{Q1}subscript𝐴𝑡1subscript𝐴𝑡2…subscript𝐴𝑤1subscript𝑄1\\{A_{t+1},A_{{t}+2},\\ldots,A_{w-1}\\}\\cup\\{Q_{1}\\}. Therefore, |𝒯P′|≤|𝒯P|superscriptsubscript𝒯𝑃′subscript𝒯𝑃|\\mathcal{T}_{P}^{\\prime}|\\leq|\\mathcal{T}_{P}| and |𝒯Q′|≤|𝒯Q|superscriptsubscript𝒯𝑄′subscript𝒯𝑄|\\mathcal{T}_{Q}^{\\prime}|\\leq|\\mathcal{T}_{Q}|. This means that |𝒯1|≥|𝒯1′|subscript𝒯1superscriptsubscript𝒯1′|\\mathcal{T}_{1}|\\geq|\\mathcal{T}_{1}^{\\prime}|, where 𝒯1′={S1​P1,S1​Q1}∪𝒯P′∪𝒯Q′superscriptsubscript𝒯1′subscript𝑆1subscript𝑃1subscript𝑆1subscript𝑄1superscriptsubscript𝒯𝑃′superscriptsubscript𝒯𝑄′\\mathcal{T}_{1}^{\\prime}=\\{S_{1}P_{1},S_{1}Q_{1}\\}\\cup\\mathcal{T}_{P}^{\\prime}\\cup\\mathcal{T}_{Q}^{\\prime}. Further, 𝒯1′superscriptsubscript𝒯1′\\mathcal{T}_{1}^{\\prime} is also a connecting tree of {S1}∪{Ai}subscript𝑆1subscript𝐴𝑖\\{S_{1}\\}\\cup\\{A_{i}\\} and as 𝒯1subscript𝒯1\\mathcal{T}_{1} is an SMT of {S1}∪{Ai}subscript𝑆1subscript𝐴𝑖\\{S_{1}\\}\\cup\\{A_{i}\\}, then 𝒯1′superscriptsubscript𝒯1′\\mathcal{T}_{1}^{\\prime} must also be an SMT with |𝒯1′|=|𝒯1|superscriptsubscript𝒯1′subscript𝒯1|\\mathcal{T}_{1}^{\\prime}|=|\\mathcal{T}_{1}|. However, We can remove S1​P1subscript𝑆1subscript𝑃1S_{1}P_{1} and P1​Atsubscript𝑃1subscript𝐴𝑡P_{1}A_{t} from 𝒯1′superscriptsubscript𝒯1′\\mathcal{T}_{1}^{\\prime} and add S1​Atsubscript𝑆1subscript𝐴𝑡S_{1}A_{t} to get another connecting tree of {S1}∪{Ai}subscript𝑆1subscript𝐴𝑖\\{S_{1}\\}\\cup\\{A_{i}\\}, but with shorter total length (as S1​P1¯+P1​At¯>S1​At¯¯subscript𝑆1subscript𝑃1¯subscript𝑃1subscript𝐴𝑡¯subscript𝑆1subscript𝐴𝑡\\overline{S_{1}P_{1}}+\\overline{P_{1}A_{t}}>\\overline{S_{1}A_{t}} from triangle inequality). This contradicts the optimality of 𝒯1′superscriptsubscript𝒯1′\\mathcal{T}_{1}^{\\prime} which was derived to be an SMT of {S1}∪{Ai}subscript𝑆1subscript𝐴𝑖\\{S_{1}\\}\\cup\\{A_{i}\\}. This proves the claim. We proceed to prove a stronger claim regarding P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q. P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q are consecutive vertices of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} in any SMT of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}. We first prove that P,Q𝑃𝑄P,Q are vertices of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}. From Claim 4, we know that at least one among P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q must not be in the interior of polygon {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}. Without loss of generality, let it be P𝑃P. We now show that P𝑃P is a vertex of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}. For the sake of contradiction we assume that P𝑃P is not a vertex of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} i.e. P𝑃P is a Steiner point. Let P​F1→→𝑃subscript𝐹1\\overrightarrow{PF_{1}} and P​F2→→𝑃subscript𝐹2\\overrightarrow{PF_{2}} be tangents from P𝑃P to {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} where F1,F2subscript𝐹1subscript𝐹2F_{1},F_{2} are the points of tangency on {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}. As P​F1→→𝑃subscript𝐹1\\overrightarrow{PF_{1}} and P​F2→→𝑃subscript𝐹2\\overrightarrow{PF_{2}} are tangents, ∠​F1​P​F2<π∠subscript𝐹1𝑃subscript𝐹2𝜋\\angle F_{1}PF_{2}<\\pi. We denote the region between the tangents P​F1→→𝑃subscript𝐹1\\overrightarrow{PF_{1}} and P​F2→→𝑃subscript𝐹2\\overrightarrow{PF_{2}} which contains the all the points in {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} as ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}. From any Steiner point H𝐻H, which lies outside ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}, we can choose a neighbour H1subscript𝐻1H_{1} of H𝐻H such that H​H1→→𝐻subscript𝐻1\\overrightarrow{HH_{1}} is not directed towards ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}. Further we now show that there is one neighbour P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} of P𝑃P such that P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} is not in ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} and P1≠S1subscript𝑃1subscript𝑆1P_{1}\\neq S_{1}. Case I: S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} lies in ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}. However there must be another neighbour P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} of P𝑃P not in ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} (as ∠​F1​P​F2<π∠subscript𝐹1𝑃subscript𝐹2𝜋\\angle F_{1}PF_{2}<\\pi) but as P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} is outside ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}, we must have P1≠S1subscript𝑃1subscript𝑆1P_{1}\\neq S_{1}. Case II: S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} does not lie in ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} (Figure 8). As the counter-clockwise A-B path from Alsubscript𝐴𝑙A_{l} passes through Q𝑄Q, Alsubscript𝐴𝑙A_{l} must be to the left of the line LQ​S1subscript𝐿𝑄subscript𝑆1L_{QS_{1}} if the line is given a orientation from Q𝑄Q to S1subscript𝑆1S_{1}. This means that one of the tangents from P𝑃P (Without loss of generality assume it to be P​F1→→𝑃subscript𝐹1\\overrightarrow{PF_{1}}) intersects with the line LQ​S1subscript𝐿𝑄subscript𝑆1L_{QS_{1}}. Therefore, taking angles in counter-clockwise order, we have: Hence there must exist one neighbour P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} of P𝑃P lying outside the ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}, precisely in the region bounded by the rays P​F2→→𝑃subscript𝐹2\\overrightarrow{PF_{2}} and P​S1→→𝑃subscript𝑆1\\overrightarrow{PS_{1}} with P1≠S1subscript𝑃1subscript𝑆1P_{1}\\neq S_{1}. Further we can choose a neighbour P2subscript𝑃2P_{2} of P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} such that P1​P2→→subscript𝑃1subscript𝑃2\\overrightarrow{P_{1}P_{2}} is directed away from ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}. We can continue choosing P2,P3,…subscript𝑃2subscript𝑃3…P_{2},P_{3},\\ldots such that Pi​Pi+1→→subscript𝑃𝑖subscript𝑃𝑖1\\overrightarrow{P_{i}P_{i+1}} is directed away from the region ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}. Moreover, the path P,P1,P2,…𝑃subscript𝑃1subscript𝑃2…P,P_{1},P_{2},\\ldots must end at some point Bksubscript𝐵𝑘B_{k} as it cannot end in any vertex of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} (since all vertices of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} are in ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}). Now, let 𝒞1subscript𝒞1\\mathcal{C}_{1} be the path from Arsubscript𝐴𝑟A_{r} to Bksubscript𝐵𝑘B_{k} (which passes through P𝑃P and P1subscript𝑃1P_{1}) and let 𝒞2subscript𝒞2\\mathcal{C}_{2} be the counter-clockwise A-B path from Alsubscript𝐴𝑙A_{l} (passing through Q𝑄Q, S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} and S2subscript𝑆2S_{2}). We observe that 𝒞1subscript𝒞1\\mathcal{C}_{1} and 𝒞2subscript𝒞2\\mathcal{C}_{2} are two edge disjoint A-B paths, which is a contradiction to Lemma 3.14. This proves that P𝑃P is indeed a vertex in {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}. Therefore by Claim 4, Q𝑄Q does not lie inside {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} and repeating this same argument on Q𝑄Q yields that Q𝑄Q is also a vertex of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}. Now, to prove that P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q are consecutive vertices of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}, we use Observation 3.3. Observation 3.3 implies that there must not be any other point of the SMT in the triangle P​S1​Q𝑃subscript𝑆1𝑄PS_{1}Q. This means that P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q must be consecutive vertices of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}, otherwise all polygon vertices of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} occurring in between P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q would be inside the triangle P​S1​Q𝑃subscript𝑆1𝑄PS_{1}Q (as ∠​P​S1​Q=2​π3∠𝑃subscript𝑆1𝑄2𝜋3\\angle PS_{1}Q=\\dfrac{2\\pi}{3} and n≥13𝑛13n\\geq 13). This proves the claim. Therefore, P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q are consecutive vertices Aj,Aj+1subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝐴𝑗1A_{j},A_{j+1} of the polygon {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}, for some j∈[n]𝑗delimited-[]𝑛j\\in[n] such that Ajsubscript𝐴𝑗A_{j}, S1subscript𝑆1S_{1}, Aj+1subscript𝐴𝑗1A_{j+1} is a path in the SMT, where S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} is a Steiner point lying on all A-B paths. Our next step is to investigate some more structural properties of an SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}. From , we may guess that there would be a lot of polygon edges of both {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} and {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\} in an SMT. We prove the following Lemma, stating that there is an SMT of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} which contains (n−2)𝑛2(n-2) polygon edges of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}. For an SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}  with aspect ratio λ𝜆\\lambda,\nλ>λ1=11−4​sin⁡πn𝜆subscript𝜆1114𝜋𝑛\\lambda>\\lambda_{1}=\\frac{1}{1-4\\sin\\frac{\\pi}{n}}, let S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} be the Steiner point such that all A-B paths pass through S1subscript𝑆1S_{1}. Let Ajsubscript𝐴𝑗A_{j} and Aj+1subscript𝐴𝑗1A_{j+1} be vertices of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} which are connected to S1subscript𝑆1S_{1}. Then, there exists an SMT of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} having (n−2)𝑛2(n-2) polygon edges of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} other than Aj​Aj+1subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝐴𝑗1A_{j}A_{j+1}. Let 𝒯0subscript𝒯0\\mathcal{T}_{0} be any SMT of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}. From Lemma 3.17, we know that there exists S1subscript𝑆1S_{1}, Ajsubscript𝐴𝑗A_{j} and Aj+1subscript𝐴𝑗1A_{j+1} such that S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} is a Steiner point which is a part of all A-B paths, and Aj​S1​Aj+1subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝑆1subscript𝐴𝑗1A_{j}S_{1}A_{j+1} is a path 𝒯0subscript𝒯0\\mathcal{T}_{0}. From 𝒯0subscript𝒯0\\mathcal{T}_{0}, we remove the edges S1​Ajsubscript𝑆1subscript𝐴𝑗S_{1}A_{j} and S1​Aj+1subscript𝑆1subscript𝐴𝑗1S_{1}A_{j+1} and add the edge Aj​Aj+1subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝐴𝑗1A_{j}A_{j+1}. This results in a forest of two disjoint trees 𝒯xsubscript𝒯𝑥\\mathcal{T}_{x} and 𝒯ysubscript𝒯𝑦\\mathcal{T}_{y}. One of these trees (say 𝒯xsubscript𝒯𝑥\\mathcal{T}_{x}) must contain all terminal points from {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} and the other tree must contain all terminals from {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\}, as no more A-B paths exist after we removed the edges S1​Ajsubscript𝑆1subscript𝐴𝑗S_{1}A_{j} and S1​Aj+1subscript𝑆1subscript𝐴𝑗1S_{1}A_{j+1}. Therefore we have |𝒯0|=|𝒯x|+|𝒯y|−1+S1​Aj¯+S1​Aj+1¯subscript𝒯0subscript𝒯𝑥subscript𝒯𝑦1¯subscript𝑆1subscript𝐴𝑗¯subscript𝑆1subscript𝐴𝑗1|\\mathcal{T}_{0}|=|\\mathcal{T}_{x}|+|\\mathcal{T}_{y}|-1+\\overline{S_{1}A_{j}}+\\overline{S_{1}A_{j+1}}. We further replace 𝒯xsubscript𝒯𝑥\\mathcal{T}_{x} with a Euclidean minimum spanning tree 𝒯x′superscriptsubscript𝒯𝑥′\\mathcal{T}_{x}^{\\prime} of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} such that the edge Aj​Aj+1subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝐴𝑗1A_{j}A_{j+1} is present in 𝒯x′superscriptsubscript𝒯𝑥′\\mathcal{T}_{x}^{\\prime}. From , we know that |𝒯x′|≤|𝒯x|superscriptsubscript𝒯𝑥′subscript𝒯𝑥|\\mathcal{T}_{x}^{\\prime}|\\leq|\\mathcal{T}_{x}|. We now remove the edge Aj​Aj+1subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝐴𝑗1A_{j}A_{j+1} and add back the edges S1​Ajsubscript𝑆1subscript𝐴𝑗S_{1}A_{j} and S1​Aj+1subscript𝑆1subscript𝐴𝑗1S_{1}A_{j+1} which gives a connected tree 𝒯0′superscriptsubscript𝒯0′\\mathcal{T}_{0}^{\\prime} of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}. Therefore we have: This means 𝒯0′superscriptsubscript𝒯0′\\mathcal{T}_{0}^{\\prime} must be an SMT. However, all polygon edges of polygon {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} appearing in 𝒯x′superscriptsubscript𝒯𝑥′\\mathcal{T}_{x}^{\\prime} also appear in 𝒯0′superscriptsubscript𝒯0′\\mathcal{T}_{0}^{\\prime} as well, except Aj​Aj+1subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝐴𝑗1A_{j}A_{j+1}. Therefore, the SMT 𝒯0′superscriptsubscript𝒯0′\\mathcal{T}_{0}^{\\prime} has (n−2)𝑛2(n-2) polygon edges of the polygon {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}. With these set of results in hand, we can now show that there exists an SMT of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} following a singly connected topology. To show this, we start with any SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} , 𝒯0subscript𝒯0\\mathcal{T}_{0}, that satisfies all the results derived so far and transform it into a Steiner tree of singly connected topology having total length not longer than the initial Steiner tree 𝒯0subscript𝒯0\\mathcal{T}_{0}. There exists an SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}  following a singly connected topology for n≥13𝑛13n\\geq 13 and λ≥λ1𝜆subscript𝜆1\\lambda\\geq\\lambda_{1}, where Let 𝒯0subscript𝒯0\\mathcal{T}_{0} be any SMT of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} which satisfies the properties of Lemma 3.22. Further, from Lemma 3.17, there is a Steiner point S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} which lies on all A-B paths, and there are two consecutive vertices Ajsubscript𝐴𝑗A_{j}, Aj+1subscript𝐴𝑗1A_{j+1} such that Ajsubscript𝐴𝑗A_{j}, S1subscript𝑆1S_{1}, Aj+1subscript𝐴𝑗1A_{j+1} is a path in 𝒯0subscript𝒯0\\mathcal{T}_{0}. As 𝒯0subscript𝒯0\\mathcal{T}_{0} satisfies the property of Lemma 3.22, 𝒯0subscript𝒯0\\mathcal{T}_{0} has (n−2)𝑛2(n-2) polygon edges of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} excluding the edge Aj​Aj+1subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝐴𝑗1A_{j}A_{j+1}. Let H𝐻H be the point in the interior of the polygon {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} such that H​Aj​Aj+1𝐻subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝐴𝑗1HA_{j}A_{j+1} form an equilateral triangle. As n>6𝑛6n>6, the common centre O𝑂O of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} and {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\} does not lie inside the triangle H​Aj​Aj+1𝐻subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝐴𝑗1HA_{j}A_{j+1}. Now, we modify 𝒯0subscript𝒯0\\mathcal{T}_{0} as follows: Remove edges Aj​S1subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝑆1A_{j}S_{1}, S1​Aj+1subscript𝑆1subscript𝐴𝑗1S_{1}A_{j+1} and add edge S1​Hsubscript𝑆1𝐻S_{1}H to get the forest 𝒯1subscript𝒯1\\mathcal{T}_{1}. We know from [ref]9 that S1subscript𝑆1S_{1}, S2subscript𝑆2S_{2} and H𝐻H are collinear and this transformation does not change the total length. Therefore |𝒯0|=|𝒯1|subscript𝒯0subscript𝒯1|\\mathcal{T}_{0}|=|\\mathcal{T}_{1}|. Here, |𝒯1|subscript𝒯1|\\mathcal{T}_{1}| denotes the sum of the lengths of edges present in 𝒯1subscript𝒯1\\mathcal{T}_{1}. Add edge H​O𝐻𝑂HO and remove all polygon edges of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} to get 𝒯2subscript𝒯2\\mathcal{T}_{2}. Therefore |𝒯2|=|𝒯1|+H​O¯−(n−2)=|𝒯0|+H​O¯−(n−2)subscript𝒯2subscript𝒯1¯𝐻𝑂𝑛2subscript𝒯0¯𝐻𝑂𝑛2|\\mathcal{T}_{2}|=|\\mathcal{T}_{1}|+\\overline{HO}-(n-2)=|\\mathcal{T}_{0}|+\\overline{HO}-(n-2). We observe that 𝒯2subscript𝒯2\\mathcal{T}_{2} is a tree connecting the points in {Bi}∪{O}subscript𝐵𝑖𝑂\\{B_{i}\\}\\cup\\{O\\}. Let S0subscript𝑆0S_{0} be the Torricelli point of the triangle O​Bj​Bj+1𝑂subscript𝐵𝑗subscript𝐵𝑗1OB_{j}B_{j+1}. Let 𝒯3subscript𝒯3\\mathcal{T}_{3} be the Steiner tree of {Bi}∪{O}subscript𝐵𝑖𝑂\\{B_{i}\\}\\cup\\{O\\} with edges S0​Osubscript𝑆0𝑂S_{0}O, S0​Bjsubscript𝑆0subscript𝐵𝑗S_{0}B_{j}, S0​Bj+1subscript𝑆0subscript𝐵𝑗1S_{0}B_{j+1} and other points in {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\} connected through (n−2)𝑛2(n-2) polygon edges of the polygon {Bi}subscript𝐵𝑖\\{B_{i}\\}. From , we know that 𝒯3subscript𝒯3\\mathcal{T}_{3} is the SMT of {Bi}∪{O}subscript𝐵𝑖𝑂\\{B_{i}\\}\\cup\\{O\\}. Therefore |𝒯3|≤|𝒯2|=|𝒯0|+H​O¯−(n−2)subscript𝒯3subscript𝒯2subscript𝒯0¯𝐻𝑂𝑛2|\\mathcal{T}_{3}|\\leq|\\mathcal{T}_{2}|=|\\mathcal{T}_{0}|+\\overline{HO}-(n-2). Further we know that H𝐻H lies on the edge O​S0𝑂subscript𝑆0OS_{0} (as O𝑂O, S0subscript𝑆0S_{0} and H𝐻H lie on the perpendicular bisector of Bjsubscript𝐵𝑗B_{j} and Bj+1subscript𝐵𝑗1B_{j+1}). Remove edge S0​Osubscript𝑆0𝑂S_{0}O and add edge S0​Hsubscript𝑆0𝐻S_{0}H to get 𝒯4subscript𝒯4\\mathcal{T}_{4}. As H𝐻H lies on the edge O​S0𝑂subscript𝑆0OS_{0}, we have |𝒯4|=|𝒯3|−O​H¯≤|𝒯0|−(n−2)subscript𝒯4subscript𝒯3¯𝑂𝐻subscript𝒯0𝑛2|\\mathcal{T}_{4}|=|\\mathcal{T}_{3}|-\\overline{OH}\\leq|\\mathcal{T}_{0}|-(n-2). Let S3subscript𝑆3S_{3} be the intersection of the circumcircle of triangle Aj​H​Aj+1subscript𝐴𝑗𝐻subscript𝐴𝑗1A_{j}HA_{j+1} (from Lemma 3.1 the intersection exists as λ1≥λvsubscript𝜆1subscript𝜆𝑣\\lambda_{1}\\geq\\lambda_{v} for n≥13𝑛13n\\geq 13). Remove the edge S3​Hsubscript𝑆3𝐻S_{3}H and add the edges S3​Ajsubscript𝑆3subscript𝐴𝑗S_{3}A_{j} and S3​Aj+1subscript𝑆3subscript𝐴𝑗1S_{3}A_{j+1} to get 𝒯5subscript𝒯5\\mathcal{T}_{5}. Again, from [ref]9 we know that this transformation does not change the total length. Hence |𝒯5|=|𝒯5|≤|𝒯0|−(n−2)subscript𝒯5subscript𝒯5subscript𝒯0𝑛2|\\mathcal{T}_{5}|=|\\mathcal{T}_{5}|\\leq|\\mathcal{T}_{0}|-(n-2). Moreover, as λ>λv𝜆subscript𝜆𝑣\\lambda>\\lambda_{v}, we observe that {Aj,Bj,Aj+1,Bj+1,S3,S0}subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝐵𝑗subscript𝐴𝑗1subscript𝐵𝑗1subscript𝑆3subscript𝑆0\\{A_{j},B_{j},A_{j+1},B_{j+1},S_{3},S_{0}\\} form the vertices of the vertical gadget and points O𝑂O, H𝐻H, S3subscript𝑆3S_{3}, S0subscript𝑆0S_{0} appear in that order on the perpendicular bisector of Bjsubscript𝐵𝑗B_{j} and Bj+1subscript𝐵𝑗1B_{j+1}. Add back the (n−2)𝑛2(n-2) polygon edges of {Ai}subscript𝐴𝑖\\{A_{i}\\} which were removed in the second step to get 𝒯6subscript𝒯6\\mathcal{T}_{6}. Therefore |𝒯4|=|𝒯5|+(n−2)≤|𝒯0|subscript𝒯4subscript𝒯5𝑛2subscript𝒯0|\\mathcal{T}_{4}|=|\\mathcal{T}_{5}|+(n-2)\\leq|\\mathcal{T}_{0}|. We further observe that 𝒯6subscript𝒯6\\mathcal{T}_{6} is a Steiner tree connecting the points {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} with a singly connected topology. Therefore we started with an arbitrary SMT 𝒯0subscript𝒯0\\mathcal{T}_{0} and transformed it into a Steiner tree 𝒯6subscript𝒯6\\mathcal{T}_{6} with a singly connected topology (where {Aj,Bj,Aj+1,Bj+1,S3,S0}subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝐵𝑗subscript𝐴𝑗1subscript𝐵𝑗1subscript𝑆3subscript𝑆0\\{A_{j},B_{j},A_{j+1},B_{j+1},S_{3},S_{0}\\} form the vertices of the vertical gadget) which has a total length not worse than 𝒯0subscript𝒯0\\mathcal{T}_{0}. Hence 𝒯6subscript𝒯6\\mathcal{T}_{6} must be an SMT of {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}. This proves the theorem. Theorem 3.24 determines the exact structure of the SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} . Further from Section 3.1 we determine the exact method to construct the two additional Steiner points in 𝒪​(1)𝒪1\\mathcal{O}(1) steps - note that this construction time is independent of the integer n𝑛n or the real number λ𝜆\\lambda. Therefore, SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\}  for n≥13𝑛13n\\geq 13 and λ≥λ1𝜆subscript𝜆1\\lambda\\geq\\lambda_{1} is solvable in polynomial time. Note that the total length of any SMT for {Ai}∪{Bi}subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\{A_{i}\\}\\cup\\{B_{i}\\} , when n≥13𝑛13n\\geq 13 and λ≥λ1𝜆subscript𝜆1\\lambda\\geq\\lambda_{1}, is Further, λ1subscript𝜆1\\lambda_{1} converges to 1 very quickly with increasing n𝑛n (plotted in Figure 9): This means for large sized n𝑛n and for ratios that are not too small, the SMT will follow a singly connected topology.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: Remove edges Aj​S1subscript𝐴𝑗subscript𝑆1A_{j}S_{1}, S1​Aj+1subscript𝑆1subscript𝐴𝑗1S_{1}A_{j+1} and add edge S1​Hsubscript𝑆1𝐻S_{1}H to get the forest 𝒯1subscript𝒯1\\mathcal{T}_{1}.
