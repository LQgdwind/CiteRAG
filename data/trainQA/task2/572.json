      "content": "Paper Title: Sparse Approximate Multifrontal Factorization with Butterfly Compression for High Frequency Wave Equations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider the LU factorization of a sparse matrix A∈ℂN×N𝐴superscriptℂ𝑁𝑁A\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N\\times N}, as\nP​(Dr​A​Dc​Qc)​P⊤=L​U𝑃subscript𝐷𝑟𝐴subscript𝐷𝑐subscript𝑄𝑐superscript𝑃top𝐿𝑈P\\left(D_{r}AD_{c}Q_{c}\\right)P^{\\top}=LU,\nwhere P𝑃P and Qcsubscript𝑄𝑐Q_{c} are permutation matrices, Drsubscript𝐷𝑟D_{r} and Dcsubscript𝐷𝑐D_{c} are diagonal row\nand column scaling matrices and L𝐿L and U𝑈U are sparse lower and\nupper-triangular respectively. Qcsubscript𝑄𝑐Q_{c} aims to maximize the magnitude\nof the elements on the matrix diagonal. Drsubscript𝐷𝑟D_{r} and Dcsubscript𝐷𝑐D_{c} scale the matrix such that the diagonal\nentries are one in absolute value and all off-diagonal entries are less than one.\nThis step is implemented using the sequential MC64 code \nor the parallel method – without the diagonal scaling – described in [ref]7.\nThe permutation P𝑃P is applied\nsymmetrically and is used to minimize the fill-in, i.e., the number of non-zero entries in\nthe sparse factors L𝐿L and U𝑈U. This permutation is computed from the symmetric sparsity\nstructure of A+A⊤𝐴superscript𝐴topA+A^{\\top}. For large problems the preferred ordering is typically based on\nthe nested dissection heuristic, as implemented in METIS  or\nScotch. The multifrontal method  relies on a graph called the assembly tree to guide the computation. Each node τ𝜏\\tau of the assembly tree corresponds to a dense frontal matrix Fτsubscript𝐹𝜏F_{\\tau}, representing an intermediate dense submatrix in sparse Gaussian elimination, with the following 2×2222\\times 2 block structure: Fτ=[F11F12F21F22]subscript𝐹𝜏matrixsubscript𝐹11subscript𝐹12subscript𝐹21subscript𝐹22F_{\\tau}=\\begin{bmatrix}F_{11}&F_{12}\\\\\nF_{21}&F_{22}\\end{bmatrix}. Here, the rows and columns corresponding to the F11subscript𝐹11F_{11} block, denoted by index set Iτssubscriptsuperscript𝐼𝑠𝜏I^{s}_{\\tau}, are called the fully-summed variables, and when the front is constructed, F11subscript𝐹11F_{11} is ready for LU factorization. The disjoint index sets Iτssubscriptsuperscript𝐼𝑠𝜏I^{s}_{\\tau} form a partition of the index set of A𝐴A as ⋃τIτs={1,…,N}subscript𝜏subscriptsuperscript𝐼𝑠𝜏1…𝑁\\bigcup_{\\tau}I^{s}_{\\tau}=\\{1,\\dots,N\\}. In the context of nested dissection, the sets Iτssuperscriptsubscript𝐼𝜏𝑠I_{\\tau}^{s} correspond to individual vertex separators. The rows and columns corresponding to the F22subscript𝐹22F_{22} block, denoted by index set Iτusubscriptsuperscript𝐼𝑢𝜏I^{u}_{\\tau}, define the (temporary) Schur complement update blocks that F11subscript𝐹11F_{11} contributes to during the multifrontal LU factorization. Let Cτ=F22−F21​F11−1​F12subscript𝐶𝜏subscript𝐹22subscript𝐹21superscriptsubscript𝐹111subscript𝐹12C_{\\tau}=F_{22}-F_{21}F_{11}^{-1}F_{12} denote the contribution block, i.e., the Schur complement updated F22subscript𝐹22F_{22}. If ν𝜈\\nu is a child of τ𝜏\\tau in the assembly tree, then Iνu⊂{Iτs∪Iτu}subscriptsuperscript𝐼𝑢𝜈subscriptsuperscript𝐼𝑠𝜏subscriptsuperscript𝐼𝑢𝜏I^{u}_{\\nu}\\subset\\{I^{s}_{\\tau}\\cup I^{u}_{\\tau}\\}; for the root node t𝑡t, Itu≡∅superscriptsubscript𝐼𝑡𝑢I_{t}^{u}\\equiv\\emptyset. Let #​Iτs#subscriptsuperscript𝐼s𝜏\\#I^{\\text{s}}_{\\tau}, #​Iτu#subscriptsuperscript𝐼u𝜏\\#I^{\\text{u}}_{\\tau} and nτ=#​Iτs+#​Iτusubscript𝑛𝜏#subscriptsuperscript𝐼s𝜏#subscriptsuperscript𝐼u𝜏n_{\\tau}=\\#I^{\\text{s}}_{\\tau}\\,+\\,\\#I^{\\text{u}}_{\\tau} denote the dimensions of F11subscript𝐹11F_{11}, F22subscript𝐹22F_{22} and Fτsubscript𝐹𝜏F_{\\tau}, respectively. Note that nτsubscript𝑛𝜏n_{\\tau} tends to get bigger toward the root of the assembly tree. When considering a single front, we will omit the τ𝜏\\tau subscript. The multifrontal method casts the factorization of a sparse matrix\ninto a series of partial factorizations and Schur complement updates of the frontal matrices. It consists in a bottom-up traversal of\nthe assembly tree following a topological order. Processing a node\nconsists of four steps: Assembling the frontal matrix Fτsubscript𝐹𝜏F_{\\tau}, i.e., combining elements from the sparse matrix A𝐴A with the\nchildren’s (ν1subscript𝜈1\\nu_{1} and ν2subscript𝜈2\\nu_{2}) contribution blocks.\nThis involves a scatter operation and is called extend-add, denoted by \n\n↕\n\n\n↔\n\n\n↕\n\n\n↔\n\\mathbin{\\hskip 6.49994pt\\text{\\makebox[0.0pt]{\\leavevmode\\resizebox{3.00003pt}{8.50006pt}{$\\updownarrow$}}\\raisebox{1.49994pt}{\\makebox[0.0pt]{\\leavevmode\\resizebox{13.00005pt}{1.99997pt}{$\\leftrightarrow$}}}}\\hskip 6.49994pt}: ↕ ↔ ↕ ↔ ↕ ↔ ↕ ↔ ↕ ↔ ↕ ↔ ↕ ↔ ↕ ↔ Elimination of the fully-summed variables in the\nF11subscript𝐹11F_{11} block, i.e., dense LU factorization with partial pivoting of F11subscript𝐹11F_{11}. Updating the off-diagonal blocks F12subscript𝐹12F_{12} and F21subscript𝐹21F_{21}. Computing the contribution block from the Schur complement update of F22subscript𝐹22F_{22}:\nCτ=F22−F21​F11−1​F12subscript𝐶𝜏subscript𝐹22subscript𝐹21superscriptsubscript𝐹111subscript𝐹12C_{\\tau}=F_{22}-F_{21}F_{11}^{-1}F_{12}. Cτsubscript𝐶𝜏C_{\\tau} or F22subscript𝐹22F_{22} is temporary storage (pushed on a stack), and can be released as soon as it has been used in the front assembly (step (1)) of the parent node. After the numerical factorization, the lower triangular sparse factor is available in the F21subscript𝐹21F_{21} and F11subscript𝐹11F_{11} blocks and the upper triangular factor in the F11subscript𝐹11F_{11} and F12subscript𝐹12F_{12} blocks. These can then be used to very efficiently solve linear systems, using forward and backward substitution. A high-level overview is given in Algorithm 1. We implemented the multifrontal method in the STRUMPACK\nlibrary [ref]49, using C++, MPI and OpenMP,\nsupporting real/complex arithmetic, single/double precision and\n323232/646464-bit integers.\nNote that the pivoting strategy in factorization of F11subscript𝐹11F_{11} in STRUMPACK does not use numerical values of F21subscript𝐹21F_{21} and F12subscript𝐹12F_{12} for ease of implementation. For any frontal matrix Fτsubscript𝐹𝜏F_{\\tau} of size nτsubscript𝑛𝜏n_{\\tau}, its LU factorization (only on F11subscript𝐹11F_{11}) and storage costs scale as 𝒪​(nτ3)𝒪superscriptsubscript𝑛𝜏3\\mathcal{O}(n_{\\tau}^{3}) and 𝒪​(nτ2)𝒪superscriptsubscript𝑛𝜏2\\mathcal{O}(n_{\\tau}^{2}), severely limiting the applicability of the multifrontal method to large-scale PDE problems. In what follows, we leverage the butterfly algorithm and its hierarchical matrix extension for representing frontal matrices and constructing fast sparse direct solvers, particularly for high-frequency wave equations.
