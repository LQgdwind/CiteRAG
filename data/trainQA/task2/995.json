Adversaries: Robustness, including to malicious attacks, is a subgual for designing safe AI.\nModern machine learning systems are generally vulnerable to adversaries which typically refer to inputs which are designed specifically to induce failures.\nThese attacks have been used to engineer failure modes for learning systems across domains in AI research including computer vision , natural language processing , and reinforcement learning .\nHumans can be vulnerable to adversaries as well (e.g., 0).\nThough this paper is about adversarial weaknesses, the focus here contrasts with most existing work in adversaries because Achilles Heels are weaknesses at the highly-abstract, decision-theoretic level. Decision Theory: Although there is no inherent reason to expect that advanced AI systems would necessarily use a single coherent decision theory universally,111Humans generally do not. these types of questions are pertinent to the extent that certain principles can effectively describe how an agent will act in a particular class of situations.\nThis work most closely relates to AI alignment research concerning decision theory involving dilemmas and paradoxes.\nSystem-based reasoning has been valuable for handling naive decision paradoxes .\nMore recently, much work in AI alignment has fallen under the embedded agency paradigm.\nThe process of understanding optimal and predictable behavior for agents embedded inside of an environment is complicated by conceptual challenges involving an agent’s identity, policy implementation, and world model  .\nProgress has been made through the formulation of Functional Decision Theory   which offers a framework for understanding optimal behavior in terms of having an optimal policy as opposed to making optimal choices.\nAdditional work in anthropic decision theory has also shown that rational behavior can often depend in counterintuitive ways on the set of assumptions that one makes about the process by which they came into existence  .\nMany of these concepts will be further explored in the following sections.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: in part by several works   8  2 .\nIt is important to note that AI alignment is a multiagent problem, and while this paper focuses on dilemmas which can be studied in single-agent contexts, [ref]47 focuses on emergent failure modes from multiparty interactions.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
