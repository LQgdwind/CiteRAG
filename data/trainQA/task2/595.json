      "content": "Paper Title: Tree Optimization Based Heuristics and Metaheuristics in Network Construction Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the last decade, a new research area has emerged that deals with operational planning of construction activities in transportation and communication networks. If classical network design problems address the question of which network should be constructed to accomplish certain long-term strategic goals, the problems in this area address the question of how the network should be constructed with the focus on the network’s performance during the construction period. In particular, given the available limited resources, the question is in what order different parts of the planned network should be constructed to optimize some short-term or medium-term goals. These issues are important since network construction typically takes long time, resources are always limited, different parts/connections often have different urgency/priority/demand, and operational performance of some connections may be needed much sooner than the whole network can become fully operational.\nThis gives rise to optimization models that combine network design and scheduling features. Such models also combine different types of combinatorial structures and technical challenges characteristic for network design and scheduling problems, so they are not amenable to the methods developed in each of these two well-studied fields. The literature on network design with scheduling considerations can be classified into two categories. The first category is concerned with network improvement: given an already functional and connected network, how should the network be dynamically modified by installing new edges to improve some overall characteristic of network performance. Two closely related lines of research represent this category. Baxter et al. , Engel et al. [ref]7, and Kalinowski et al.  introduce and study Incremental Network Design problems, where at each period of a finite horizon one new edge is installed, and the goal is to optimize the cumulative value over all periods of some performance metric such as the minimum spanning tree length [ref]7, shortest path length , or maximum flow value . Cavdaroglu et al. , Nurre et al.  and Nurre and Sharkey  introduce and develop a more general Integrated Network Design and Scheduling framework that can model many environments and objectives. In this framework, arcs are installed by a number of identical crews that operate in parallel, and the goal is again to optimize the cumulative value of some network performance metric over a finite horizon. Additional references can be found in . The second category is specifically concerned with connectivity issues, that is, with the process of building the network where the times of establishing / restoring connections between important areas are optimized. An early related work is Guha et al.  who study the power outage recovery problem where connectivity between generator nodes and customer nodes in an electric power network is destroyed as a result of the failure of some relay nodes, and it is required to restore the connectivity by a multi-stage repair of the failed relay nodes. At every stage, only a subset of the failed nodes can be repaired due to a limited budget, and the total waiting time of the disconnected customers is minimized. In   , network construction / connectivity restoration problems (further referred to as Network Construction (NC) problems) are considered, and these problems will be the focus of this paper. In single-server NC problems, the network is constructed by a server (construction crew) whose construction speed is much slower than the travel speed, so its relocation times within the network are negligible with respect to construction times. The goal is to minimize a scheduling objective related with the times when specific vertices become connected to the operational part of the network, or with the times when certain pairs of vertices become connected. Such problems arise, for example, in planning emergency restoration operations for networks that are partially destroyed/damaged as a result of a disaster, where some vertices / parts of the network have been disconnected from the main network and need urgent re-connection as people/equipment may be trapped there, with different degrees of urgency/priority. Discussions of different types of applications for NC problems can be found in   . We note that in the context of some applications of NC problems such as emergency restoration operations, even a small difference in solution quality can have a very serious impact, as people’s lives and safety may be at stake. Several NC problems have been studied in    with the purpose of developing exact branch-and-bound algorithms based on lower bounds on the optimal objective value derived from an analysis of the combinatorial structure of the problems. Some fast heuristics were also suggested for these problems   ; these heuristics were used for obtaining starting solutions for the branch-and-bound algorithms, and for obtaining approximate solutions for larger instances that could not be solved by exact methods. Most studied NC problems are strongly NP-hard on general networks   ; on trees, some of them are polynomially solvable and some are NP-hard   . NC problems that are polynomially solvable on trees are called tree-efficient. In this paper, we present a heuristic and two metaheuristics for solving tree-efficient NC problems on general networks. The methods are generic in the sense that they can be used for any NC problem that has the tree-efficiency property, and show excellent performance for the specific NC problems studied in   . In particular, our heuristic outperforms the heuristics from   , and the metaheuristics find optimal solutions for almost all instances for which optimal solutions are known. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formally define NC problems and provide their classification. Section 3 develops a generic local search heuristic, defines neighborhoods of interest, and provides some auxiliary results. Section 4 describes the two metaheuristics that we explore. Section 5 discusses computational results, and Section 6 provides some conclusions.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: modified by installing new edges to improve some overall characteristic of network performance.
