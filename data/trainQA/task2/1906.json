      "content": "Paper Title: Perceptual Loss for Robust Unsupervised Homography Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven a pinhole camera model assumption, a homography relates any two images of the same planar surface in space or any two images produced by pure rotational movement of the camera¬†[ref]13. One image, called a source, can be transformed by a 3√ó3333\\times 3 homography matrix HùêªH as if viewed from the viewpoint of the other image, called target.\nEven if the primary assumptions are violated, the homography can be applied as an initial alignment step in other tasks such as mesh flow¬†[ref]21 and optical flow¬†[ref]15.\nTherefore, homography has been widely used in many computer vision applications such as SLAM¬† , image stitching¬† , and change detection and description¬† . Traditionally, homography estimation was performed using non-learnable approaches either in the pixel-space (direct methods) or in hand-crafted feature space (feature-based methods) . Recently, with the advancement in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), DeTone et al.¬† proposed a simple CNN architecture trained in an end-to-end fashion. The idea was to directly regress the parameters of a homography and it achieved similar performance to traditional feature-based methods. A more effective approach is presented by Zeng et al.¬†3, where the problem was formulated as per-pixel offset regression. However, supervised methods are often unlikely to be used in real-life scenarios, where ground truth homography labeling is prohibitively expensive. To mitigate this issue, Nguyen et al.¬† introduced an end-to-end unsupervised approach. First, a homography is estimated using both input images and then homography estimation is learned by comparing the per-pixel intensity of warped source image and target image. Models trained using this formulation perform surprisingly well even for images with big viewpoint differences. However, they are not robust to big illumination changes and cannot be used in real-life scenarios  . In contrast, Zhang et al.¬†4, by learning the feature representation used for both homography estimation and image comparison, achieved robustness to different lighting conditions, but not for images with big viewpoint changes. Therefore, robust unsupervised homography estimation for both big illumination and viewpoint changes at the same time is still an open problem. Instead of learning a shared representation for homography estimation and image comparison 4, we propose to decouple those two tasks by using a dedicated Loss Network to compare warped source image and target image. It has been shown that a pre-trained and fixed convolutional neural network as a Loss Network can capture perceptual differences  1. The homography is learned implicitly by comparing the images in feature space produced by the Loss Network. Since the homography should be invertible, we compare warped source and target images and swap their roles. Therefore, we call our loss function bidirectional implicit Homography Estimation (biHomE) loss. We exhibit the simplicity and effectiveness of biHomE loss by applying it on top of three homography estimation architectures on the Synthetic COCO (S-COCO) dataset¬†. biHomE not only outperforms other unsupervised methods but is also on par with its supervised counterpart. Next, we use an additional photometric distortion augmentation on synthetic COCO (denoted as PDS-COCO) to mimic the illumination changes in real-life scenarios. We show that biHomE is the only unsupervised method that can converge on PDS-COCO, while still maintaining comparable or better performance compared to supervised approaches. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our loss, we provide an experimental study on the influence of image alignment on the quality of generated change captions by the Dual Dynamic Attention Model (DUDA)¬† method. We achieve a new state-of-the-art performance on the change captioning task.\nOur contributions are as follows: We introduce a new perceptual loss (biHomE) to be used in an unsupervised setting, which decouples homography estimation from representation learning for image comparison. We propose to use an additional photometric distortion step in the synthetic COCO dataset generation (PDS-COCO) to evaluate the robustness of homography estimation to big illumination and viewpoint changes, which is more aligned with real-life scenarios. We achieve state-of-the-art performance using biHomE loss on both S-COCO and PDS-COCO datasets for unsupervised homography estimation. We apply biHomE for unsupervised image alignment to achieve a state-of-the-art change captioning quality on the CLEVR_Change dataset¬†.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Given a pinhole camera model assumption, a homography relates any two images of the same planar surface in space or any two images produced by pure rotational movement of the camera¬†[ref]13.
