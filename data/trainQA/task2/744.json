Part of the results in this paper was presented at the International Symposium on Information Theory 2020 [1].\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince the introduction of the approximate DP in , it has been extensively studied especially for iterative ML algorithms, see [ref]10  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   [ref]32 to name a few.\nPerhaps one of the most fundamental\nprimitive in statistical privacy is the study of composition; how privacy degrades under as the algorithm iterates.\nThere are still continued efforts to better understand the composition of DP. The advanced composition result for DP was derived . In a pioneering work,  obtained an optimal homogeneous composition theorem for (Œµ,Œ¥)ùúÄùõø(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-DP. It is, however, shown to be ##\\#P hard to compute the DP parameters under heterogeneous composition . A substantial recent effort has been devoted to relaxing the DP constraints using divergences between probability distributions to address the weakness of (Œµ,Œ¥)ùúÄùõø(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-DP in handling\ncomposition    [ref]4  .\nFor instance,    [ref]4 considered R√©nyi divergence and showed that the optimal privacy parameters under composition have simple linear forms. Once composition is handled, the resulting privacy parameters are converted to (Œµ,Œ¥)ùúÄùõø(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-DP via some conversion rule, e.g., [5, Theorem 2], [35, Proposition 1.3], and [4, Proposition 3]. This technique significantly improves on earlier privacy analysis of SGD.\nThis technique has been extended by follow-up work .\nMore recently, a new relaxed version of DP (not divergence-based), termed fùëìf-DP was proposed in  and shown to to enjoy a rather simple composition property. This new definition of DP was used in 0 for the privacy analysis in training deep neural networks.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Since the introduction of the approximate DP in , it has been extensively studied especially for iterative ML algorithms, see [ref]10  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   [ref]32 to name a few.\nPerhaps one of the most fundamental\nprimitive in statistical privacy is the study of composition; how privacy degrades under as the algorithm\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
