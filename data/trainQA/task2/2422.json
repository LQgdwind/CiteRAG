Our approach captures both local information (specifically, the geographical locations and the values of the local extrema) and global information about the relationships between the extrema. The global information includes the extent to which extrema are “spatially separated” (see Figure 1). To the best of our knowledge, existing methods of analyzing local extrema yield only local information. One can check whether a geographical region is an extremum by comparing its value to those of its neighboring regions. However, this approach does not provide any global information about the extrema. For example, it cannot distinguish between the two cases in Figure 1. Examining vineyards allow us to measure the persistence of extrema with time, observe how spatial separations between extrema change with time, and track how geographical locations of extrema change with time. We accomplish the last of these by using the vineyards to match the extrema at one time to the corresponding extrema at another time. (They may not be at the same geographical locations.) We identify the geographical locations of extrema by examining the sequence of (birth simplex, death simplex) pairs for each vine. To the best of our knowledge, the present paper is the first paper that uses information about the sequence of (birth simplex, death simplex) pairs for each vine, rather than using only the (birth, death) filtration values for each vine. A naive approach, such as comparing each region to its neighboring regions at each time step, does not come with a natural way to match the extrema that one identifies at different times and does not provide information about changes in global structure. With our approach, we are able to track how the global spatial structure of data changes with time. Another contribution of our paper is a new method to construct an “efficient” simplicial complex whose underlying space222The underlying space of a simplicial complex is the union of its simplices. We note that it is common in studies of TDA for authors to conflate the combinatorial and topological structures of a simplicial complex. is homeomorphic to a geographical space (which is the set of regions, as we will explain shortly)333The simplicial complex is “efficient” in the sense that it minimizes the number of simplices..\nIn our applications, we possess geographical data in the form of shapefiles. Each geographical region (e.g., a neighborhood or zip code) is represented in a shapefile by a polygon (or by multiple polygons, if the region is disconnected) with many vertices (about 100–1000 vertices, depending on the particular shapefile and the particular region). These polygons approximate the real-life boundaries of the geographical regions. A naive approach to building a simplicial complex is to simply triangulate each of the polygons. However, this approach has two issues. The first is that there are often small overlaps between the polygons or spurious gaps between the polygons because the polygon boundaries do not exactly match the real-life geographical boundaries. The vertices of a polygon often lie in the interior of another polygon. The second issue is that simply triangulating these polygons, which each have a very large number of vertices, would create orders-of-magnitude more simplices than are necessary to represent a geographical space. It is important to attempt to minimize the number of simplices in a simplicial complex because PH and vineyard computation times are very sensitive to the number of simplices. Rather than naively triangulate the given polygons, we use the shapefile of a geographical space to infer adjacency information about the regions; we then use only this information to build a simplicial complex for that geographical space. In the resulting simplicial complex, each region is represented by a union of triangles. We use about 1–10 triangles per region, depending on the number of neighbors of the region. By contrast, the naive approach above requires about 100–1000 triangles per region. Two adjacent regions that have a connected intersection share exactly one edge in our simplicial complex, except in rare special cases that we will discuss in section 3.\nIn our simplicial complex for a geographical space, the union of any subset of geographical regions is homeomorphic to the underlying space of the simplicial subcomplex (see section 3 for the definition of a simplicial subcomplex) that is induced by the union of the corresponding triangles. When the geographical regions satisfy the mild assumptions (A1)–(A4) that we define in section 3, our construction uses the minimum number of simplices that is possible for a simplicial complex with the property above. (See Property (P) in section 3.) As case studies, we apply our approach to two data sets. The first data set is a geospatial data set of per capita vaccination rates in New York City (NYC) by zip code . The homology classes correspond to zip codes in which the vaccination rate is either lower or higher (depending on choices that one can make in our approach) than in the neighboring zip codes. The estimates of these rates are at a single point in time (23 February 2021). The second data set consists of 14-day mean per capita COVID-19 case rates in neighborhoods in the city of Los Angeles (LA) in the time period 25 April 2020–25 April 2021. Modeling the spatiotemporal spread of COVID-19 is a complex task [ref]2 [ref]51. In this geospatiotemporal data set, the homology classes of our approach correspond to COVID-19 anomalies, which are regions whose case rates are higher than in the neighboring regions.444We examine local maxima in the case-rate data. This contrasts to COVID-19 “hotspots,” which the CDC has defined using an absolute threshold for the number of cases and criteria that are related to the temporal increase in the number of cases [ref]35. It is important to examine such anomalies, as COVID-19 spreads with significant spatial heterogeneity and thus has heterogeneous effects on different areas.555Other scholars have studied contagions using TDA in ways that do not yield topological features with geographical meaning. For example, recent work used TDA to study the spatiotemporal spread of COVID-19  and Zika . These papers examined topological features in atmospheric data, which were then used to forecast case rates. TDA was also used in  to study the Watts threshold model of a social contagion on noisy geometric networks.\n\nMany factors (such as mobility, population density, socioeconomic differences, and racial demographics) play a role in how COVID-19 affects regions differently   . In our case study of COVID-19 case rates in LA, we construct a vineyard that (1) conveys which anomalies are most persistent in time and (2) reveals how the anomalies move geographically with time.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: mean per capita COVID-19 case rates in neighborhoods in the city of Los Angeles (LA) in the time period 25 April 2020–25 April 2021.
