In the associated optimization problem, called Minimum Vertex Cover, the objective is to find, given an input graph G𝐺G, a vertex cover in G𝐺G of minimum size. This problem has been one of the leitmotifs of the area of parameterized complexity  , serving as a test bed for many of the most fundamental techniques. An instance of a parameterized problem is of the form (x,k)𝑥𝑘(x,k), where x𝑥x is the total input (typically, a graph) and k𝑘k is a positive integer called the parameter. The crucial notion is that of fixed-parameter tractable algorithm, FPT for short, which is an algorithm deciding whether (x,k)𝑥𝑘(x,k) is a positive instance in time f​(k)⋅|x|𝒪​(1)⋅𝑓𝑘superscript𝑥𝒪1f(k)\\cdot|x|^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}, where f𝑓f is a computable function depending only on k𝑘k. In the parameterized Vertex Cover problem, we are given a graph G𝐺G and an integer parameter k𝑘k, and the objective is to decide whether G𝐺G contains a vertex cover of size at most k𝑘k. One of the main fields within parameterized complexity is kernelization , where the objective is to decide whether an instance (x,k)𝑥𝑘(x,k) of a parameterized problem can be transformed in polynomial time into an equivalent instance (x′,k′)superscript𝑥′superscript𝑘′(x^{\\prime},k^{\\prime}) whose total size is bounded by a function of k𝑘k; the reduced instance is called a kernel, and finding kernels of small size, typically polynomial or even linear in k𝑘k in the best case, is one of the most active areas of parameterized complexity. Considering the “max-min” version of minimization problems, that is, maximizing the size of a minimal solution of the corresponding problem, is a natural approach that has been applied to several problems such as Dominating Set  [ref]32 (whose “max-min” version is called Upper Domination), Feedback Vertex Set , or Hitting Set  [ref]5. The initial motivation of this article is the “max-min” version of Minimum Vertex Cover, called Maximum Minimal Vertex Cover, or just MMVC for short. Previous work. In his habilitation, Fernau  presented FPT algorithms for MMVC as well as some results about its kernelization parameterized by the solution size k𝑘k. It is easy to note, as observed in , that the problem admits a kernel with at most k2superscript𝑘2k^{2} vertices: if some vertex has degree at least k𝑘k, we can safely answer “yes” (cf. 2.1 for a proof); otherwise, the maximum degree is at most k−1𝑘1k-1, and it follows that every instance without isolated vertices (which may be safely removed) that has at least k2superscript𝑘2k^{2} vertices is a yes-instance, hence we have a trivial kernel with at most k2superscript𝑘2k^{2} vertices. Fernau  presented a kernel with at most 4​k4𝑘4k vertices for MMVC restricted to planar instances using the algorithmic version of the Four Color Theorem , and claimed in [34, Corollary 4.25] a kernel with at most 2​k2𝑘2k vertices on general graphs using spanning trees. Unfortunately, this latter kernelization algorithm is incorrect, as we discuss in section 6. Boria et al.  initiated a study of the complexity of MMVC and presented a number of results, in particular a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with ratio n1/2superscript𝑛12n^{1/2} on n𝑛n-vertex graphs, and showed that, unless 𝖯=𝖭𝖯𝖯𝖭𝖯{\\sf P}=\\mathsf{NP}, no polynomial-time approximation algorithm with ratio n1/2−εsuperscript𝑛12𝜀n^{1/2-\\varepsilon} exists for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0. They also presented FPT algorithms for MMVC for several choices of the parameters such as the treewidth, the size of a maximum matching, or the size of a minimum vertex cover of the input graph. The authors asked explicitly whether kernels of size o​(k2)𝑜superscript𝑘2o(k^{2}) exist for MMVC parameterized by k𝑘k. Zehavi  presented tight FPT algorithms, under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, for MMVC and its weighted version parameterized by the size of a minimum vertex cover. Recently, Bonnet and Paschos 6 and Bonnet et al.  considered the inapproximability of MMVC in subexponential time. Note that the MMVC problem is the dual of the well-studied Minimum Independent Dominating Set problem (to see this, note that the complement of any minimal vertex cover is an independent dominating set), which has applications in wireless and ad-hoc networks . We refer to the survey of Goddard and Henning . Our results and techniques. The starting motivation of this article is the kernelization of the MMVC problem, which has been almost unexplored so far in the literature. This initial motivation has resulted in a general framework that can be applied to a broad class of optimization problems in order to derive kernelization lower bounds. Namely,\nmotivated by the question of Boria et al.  about the existence of subquadratic kernels for MMVC, we introduce a generic framework to obtain kernelization lower bounds for a “certain type” of kernels for parameterized maximization or minimization problems (in particular, for MMVC), based on a hypothesis that guarantees an inapproximability result, typically 𝖯≠𝖭𝖯𝖯𝖭𝖯{\\sf P}\\neq\\mathsf{NP}. Informally, by “certain type” we mean kernelization algorithms that, in polynomial time, either decide the instance (by answering “yes” or “no”) or produce an equivalent instance of the considered problem in which the value of an optimal solution is “preserved”, in the sense that it may drop only by the drop suffered by the parameter; see subsection 3.1 for the formal details for the case of maximization problems. We call such kernels large optimal preserving kernels, or lop-kernels for short. Even if this type of kernels may seem restrictive, in particular we are not aware of any “non-artificial” kernel for a maximization problem, such as those that have become nowadays standard , which is not a lop-kernel. (We do have such an example for a minimization problem, as discussed later.)\nThe core idea of our approach is to show that a lop-kernel yields a polynomial-time approximation algorithm whose ratio depends on the size (and most importantly, on the degree) of the kernel, and to use known inapproximability results to obtain the desired lower bound. We present our framework of lop-kernels separately for maximization (section 3) and minimization (section 4) problems. Even if both versions are similar, they are not totally symmetric, and a number of technical differences pop up;\nwe discuss them in detail as they appear in section 4. Our general result is stated in Theorem 3.14 and Theorem 4.13 for maximization and minimization problems, respectively. In order be able to apply our framework to an optimization problem, we need it to be “well-behaved”, a mild condition defined in section 3 and section 4 that, for instance, for vertex-optimization problems is weaker than their decision version being in 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}. Also, our results distinguish the existence of constructive or non-constructive approximation algorithms. Since our framework seems to particularly fit vertex-optimization problems, we present the particular cases of Theorem 3.14 and Theorem 4.13 for vertex-maximization and vertex-minimization problems in Theorem 3.10 and Theorem 4.9, respectively. In order to ease the application of our results to concrete problems, we provide in 3.11 and 4.10 the “contrapositive” versions of Theorem 3.10 and Theorem 4.9, respectively. Applications of our framework. Combining 3.11 with the 𝒪​(n12−ε)𝒪superscript𝑛12𝜀\\mathcal{O}(n^{\\frac{1}{2}-\\varepsilon})-inapproximability result for MMVC by Boria et al.  immediately rules out (cf. 5.1) the existence of a lop-kernel for MMVC with 𝒪​(k2−ε)𝒪superscript𝑘2𝜀\\mathcal{O}(k^{2-\\varepsilon}) vertices for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, unless 𝖯=𝖭𝖯𝖯𝖭𝖯{\\sf P}=\\mathsf{NP}. Thus, while 5.1 does not completely rule out the existence of subquadratic kernels for MMVC, it tells that, if such a kernel exists, it should consist of “non-standard” reduction rules. Interestingly, our framework has consequences beyond the MMVC problem. One of them concerns the Maximum Minimal Feedback Vertex Set (MMFVS) problem, defined in the natural way. Dublois et al.  recently provided a cubic kernel for MMFVS parameterized by the solution size, and proved that the problem does not admit an 𝒪​(n23−ε)𝒪superscript𝑛23𝜀\\mathcal{O}(n^{\\frac{2}{3}-\\varepsilon})-approximation algorithm for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, unless 𝖯=𝖭𝖯𝖯𝖭𝖯{\\sf P}=\\mathsf{NP}. By applying 3.11 we directly obtain (5.2) that the cubic kernel of Dublois et al.  is “essentially” optimal. Another application of our results deals with the Tree Deletion Set problem. In this case, the fact that this problem does not admit a polynomial-time 𝒪​(n1−ε)𝒪superscript𝑛1𝜀\\mathcal{O}(n^{1-\\varepsilon})-approximation for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 unless 𝖯≠𝖭𝖯𝖯𝖭𝖯{\\sf P}\\neq\\mathsf{NP}  implies, together with 4.10, that Tree Deletion Set parameterized by the solution size does not admit a polynomial lop-kernel, unless 𝖯=𝖭𝖯𝖯𝖭𝖯{\\sf P}=\\mathsf{NP} (5.3). However, Tree Deletion Set does admit a polynomial kernel with 𝒪​(k4)𝒪superscript𝑘4\\mathcal{O}(k^{4}) vertices .\nTherefore, this polynomial kernel cannot be a lop-kernel, and so far it constitutes the only non-artificial example of non-lop-kernel that we are aware of. Our last application concerns the Maximum Independent Set problem restricted to Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t}-free graphs. In particular, we show (5.5) that a lop-kernel with 𝒪​(kt−1−ε)𝒪superscript𝑘𝑡1𝜀\\mathcal{O}(k^{t-1-\\varepsilon}) vertices for Maximum Independent Set on Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t}-free graphs would improve the best known approximation ratio nt−2t−1superscript𝑛𝑡2𝑡1n^{\\frac{t-2}{t-1}} that follows from Ramsey’s theorem . Finally, generalizing a conjecture of Bonnet et al. , we conjecture that for every fixed graph H𝐻H, the Maximum Independent Set problem restricted to H𝐻H-free graphs admits a polynomial lop-kernel. Comparison with other frameworks. Compared to existing frameworks to obtain lower bounds on kernelization, such as cross-compositions  , weak compositions   , polynomial parameter transformations  , or techniques to obtain lower bounds on the coefficients of linear kernels ,\nor that relate approximation and kernelization     , our approach has the advantages that it is quite simple, straightforward to apply, and relies on the same hypothesis on which the corresponding inapproximability result is based, typically the standard hypothesis that 𝖯≠𝖭𝖯𝖯𝖭𝖯{\\sf P}\\neq\\mathsf{NP}. On the negative side, it has the following two drawbacks. The first one is that, in order to obtain a non-trivial lower bound on the kernel size, it can only be applied to problems which are quite hard to approximate, for example within a factor 𝒪​(nr−ε)𝒪superscript𝑛𝑟𝜀\\mathcal{O}(n^{r-\\varepsilon}) for some constant r>0𝑟0r>0, as it is the case of MMVC and MMFVS. The second, and probably most important, drawback of our techniques is that they are able to rule out the existence of what we call lop-kernels of certain sizes, but smaller non-standard kernels that do not preserve the value of large optimal solutions might, a priori, still exist (as it is the case for Tree Deletion Set, as discussed above). Hence, since our framework seems to be orthogonal to existing ones, we think that it adds to the above list of techniques to obtain kernelization lower bounds. Other results on the kernelization of MMVC.\nComing back to the MMVC problem parameterized by the solution size, given the above negative result on general graphs, we identify graph classes where MMVC is still 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard and admits a subquadratic kernel. In particular, we deal with graph classes defined by excluding an induced subgraph H𝐻H that satisfies the Erdős-Hajnal property , that is, for which there exists a constant δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 such that every H𝐻H-free graph on n𝑛n vertices contains either a clique or an independent set of size nδsuperscript𝑛𝛿n^{\\delta}. In particular, we present a kernel for MMVC with 𝒪​(k7/4)𝒪superscript𝑘74\\mathcal{O}(k^{7/4}) vertices on the well-studied class of bull-free graphs (Theorem 7.3), with 𝒪​(k2​t−3t−1)𝒪superscript𝑘2𝑡3𝑡1\\mathcal{O}(k^{\\frac{2t-3}{t-1}}) vertices on Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t}-free graphs graphs for every t≥3𝑡3t\\geq 3 (Theorem 7.6), and with 𝒪​(k5/3)𝒪superscript𝑘53\\mathcal{O}(k^{5/3}) vertices on paw-free graphs (Theorem 7.11). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the Erdős-Hajnal property is used to obtain polynomial kernels (we would like to note that it was used by Kratsch et al.  to obtain kernelization lower bounds). Our strategy to obtain these subquadratic kernels on H𝐻H-free graphs is as follows. By the high-degree rule mentioned above, given an instance (G,k)𝐺𝑘(G,k), we may assume that the maximum degree of G𝐺G is at most k−1𝑘1k-1. We find greedily a minimal vertex cover X𝑋X of G𝐺G. If |X|≥k𝑋𝑘|X|\\geq k we are done, so we may assume that |X|≤k−1𝑋𝑘1|X|\\leq k-1, hence the goal is to bound the size of S:=V​(G)∖Xassign𝑆𝑉𝐺𝑋S:=V(G)\\setminus X. Using that G​[X]𝐺delimited-[]𝑋G[X] is also H𝐻H-free, the Erdős-Hajnal property implies (7.1) that X𝑋X can be partitioned in polynomial time into a sublinear (in k𝑘k) number of independent sets and cliques. Since S𝑆S is an independent set and we may assume that G𝐺G has no isolated vertices, in order to bound |S|𝑆|S| by a subquadratic function of k𝑘k, it is enough to show that, for each of the sublinearly many cliques or independent sets Y𝑌Y that partition X𝑋X, its neighborhood in S𝑆S has size 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k). This is easy if Y𝑌Y is an independent set: if |NS​(Y)|≥ksubscript𝑁𝑆𝑌𝑘|N_{S}(Y)|\\geq k we can conclude that (G,k)𝐺𝑘(G,k) is a yes-instance (2.1), so we may assume that |NS​(Y)|≤k−1subscript𝑁𝑆𝑌𝑘1|N_{S}(Y)|\\leq k-1. The case where Y𝑌Y is a clique is more interesting, and we need ad-hoc arguments depending on each particular excluded induced subgraph H𝐻H. We also present several positive results for MMVC restricted to other particular graph classes, such as K1,tsubscript𝐾1𝑡K_{1,t}-free graphs (7.13), graph classes with bounded chromatic number (7.15), or graph classes with bounded cliquewidth (7.17). Finally, we show (Theorem 8.1)\nthat MMVC, parameterized by the size of a minimum vertex cover (or of a maximum matching) of the input graph, does not admit a polynomial kernel unless 𝖭𝖯⊆𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖭𝖯𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒{\\sf NP}\\subseteq{\\sf coNP}/{\\sf poly}, even restricted to bipartite graphs.\nThis result complements the FPT algorithms for MMVC under these parameterizations given by Boria et al.  and Zehavi , and shows that, in what concerns the existence of polynomial kernels for MMVC, the most natural structural parameters smaller than the solution size are not large enough to yield polynomial kernels (note that the treewidth of any graph is at most one more than its vertex cover number, hence our result rules out the existence of polynomial kernels for MMVC parameterized by treewidth as well). The proof consists of a polynomial parameter transformation from Monotone Sat parameterized by the number of variables. In particular, our reduction yields also the 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hardness of MMVC on bipartite graphs, which provides an alternative proof to the one of Boliac and Lozin 4 via the 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hardness of Minimum Independent Dominating Set on bipartite graphs. Organization. In section 2 we provide some basic preliminaries about graphs, the MMVC problem, parameterized complexity, and approximation algorithms.\nIn section 3 (resp. section 4) we present our framework to obtain kernelization lower bounds for maximization (minimization) problems. In both sections, the contents are split into three subsections: we start with the general definitions, then we focus on the particular and relevant case of vertex-optimization problems, and then we present the general results for what we call “well-behaved” optimization problems. In section 5 we present several applications of the framework of lop-kernels for concrete problems, and in section 6 we discuss the flaw in the linear kernel for MMVC claimed by Fernau . section 7 is devoted to the subquadratic kernels for MMVC on particular graph classes, as well as to other positive results for MMVC. Our reduction to rule out\nthe existence of polynomial kernels for MMVC parameterized by the size of a minimum vertex cover (or a maximum matching) is presented in section 8.
