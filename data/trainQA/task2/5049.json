      "content": "Paper Title: On the Smoothed Complexity of Combinatorial Local Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Travelling Salesman problem (TSP) is one of the best studied problems in combinatorial optimization [Coo12, ABCC06].\nTSP is the problem of finding a Hamiltonian cycle – also called tour in this setting – with minimum sum of edge weights in a weighted undirected graph.\nThis problem is NP-hard as a global optimization problem, which is a standard result in classical complexity theory [GJ90].\nOne of the most commonly used methods to approximate the solution is the k𝑘k-Opt heuristic, where the neighbourhood is induced by replacing at most k𝑘k edges of the current tour on n𝑛n vertices with another set of edges, resulting in a new tour.\nDespite the worst-case results on its approximation ratio, such as the tight Θ⁡(n1/k)Θsuperscript𝑛1𝑘\\operatorname{\\Theta}\\left(n^{1/k}\\right) ratio in Metric TSP for any constant k𝑘k due to [Zho20], more promising probabilistic observations exist and this heuristic seems to perform well in practice, see e.g. [GP07, JM97, EM09]. [Kre89] settled that the local optimization problem of TSP/k𝑘k-Opt is PLS-complete, for a sufficiently large constant k𝑘k, as well as the existence of instances that require exponentially many iterations of local improvements.\n[Kla96] improves this result to a tight PLS-reduction to TSP/k𝑘k-Opt.\n[ERV14] constructed two-dimensional Euclidean TSP instances in which 222-Opt needs exponentially many iterations, under the Lpsubscript𝐿𝑝L_{p} metric for any p>0𝑝0p>0.\nFurthermore, [CKT99] provide instances where k𝑘k-Opt takes exponentially long to converge, for every k>2𝑘2k>2.\nNote that these explicit constructions provide a path of exponential length, but not all paths starting at the same configuration have this property. As for the smoothed complexity of TSP, [ERV14] established polynomial smoothed running time for the 222-Opt heuristic for TSP in the input model where the graph nodes are given as points in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, drawn from independent distributions over  [ref]1dsuperscript01𝑑 [ref]1^{d} with density bounded by ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi, and their pair-wise distances follow the Lpsubscript𝐿𝑝L_{p} metric.\nThis result has later been improved in [MV13] for the special case of smoothness by Gaussian noise. Furthermore, in [ERV16] a different model of smoothness was discussed for 222-Opt in the general TSP (on undirected graphs), where the cost of each edge is drawn from independent distributions.\nOur analysis extends this result of polynomial smoothed complexity to the k𝑘k-Opt heuristic for TSP, with arbitrary k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2.\nUsing distributions that are independent of the (undirected) edges reflects the application better, where we can think of the location of each city as fixed, but the travelling times between them can vary due to traffic, which is uncorrelated between different cities.\nOur analysis covers the case of TSP on a directed graph, known as Asymmetric TSP (ATSP) [KP80, GP07, MKA07, STV20], which has not been studied before in the context of smoothed analysis.\nUnder this asymmetric model, the travelling times in different directions, between the same two cities, can differ arbitrarily. When discussed in the context of a local search heuristic for the global optimization problem, the k𝑘k-Opt heuristic also includes every 222-Opt improvement, and is therefore often considered a stronger method (which comes at the price of higher per-step complexity).\nIn terms of the running time of local search, however, the methods are not as easily comparable:\nevery solution of the k𝑘k-Opt heuristic also provides a solution for 222-Opt on the same instance, but it might take more steps to actually terminate the local search procedure for k𝑘k-Opt due to the larger neighbourhood;\na solution for k𝑘k-Opt not only needs to be at least as good as every possible exchange of 222 edges, but is compared to every k𝑘k-Opt move and local search may terminate only a long time after the first local optimum sufficient for the 222-Opt heuristic has been encountered. By TSP/k𝑘k-Opt we denote the following local optimization problem. Let G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) be a weighted undirected graph. Find a locally minimal tour 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} on G𝐺G with respect to the k𝑘k-Opt neighbourhood.\nThe cost of a tour is given by the sum of its edge weights.\nThe k𝑘k-Opt neighbourhood of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is the set of all tours that can be generated from 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} by replacing some set of r∈{2,3,…,k}𝑟23…𝑘r\\in\\{2,3,\\dots,k\\} edges from it with a different set of r𝑟r edges in the graph.\nA solution is a tour that does not have a neighbour with smaller cost. Analogously, we define the problem ATSP/k𝑘k-Opt on directed graphs.\nWe will use the notion of edges to refer to both, edges in an undirected graph and arcs in a directed graph. Given a weighted directed graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E), ATSP/k𝑘k-Opt is the problem of finding a locally minimal directed tour (a directed Hamiltonian cycle) under the k𝑘k-Opt neighbourhood.\nThe cost of a directed tour is given by the sum of its edge weights.\nThe neighbours of a given tour are all directed tours that can be generated by replacing at most k𝑘k edges from it by other edges. Note that to find a neighbour of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} using the k𝑘k-Opt heuristic we are removing any set of 2≤r≤k2𝑟𝑘2\\leq r\\leq k edges of a tour (for which there are (|V|r)binomial𝑉𝑟\\binom{\\left|V\\right|}{r} possible choices of edges for each r𝑟r, as 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} consists of |V|𝑉\\left|V\\right| many edges). Let us fix a set of r𝑟r edges from the current tour to be removed, thus splitting the tour into r𝑟r disjoint paths (or isolated vertices, which we consider as degenerate paths).\nThen, for each such path p𝑝p, its endpoints can only be reconnected via an edge to an endpoint of the other r−1𝑟1r-1 paths to form a new tour; in other words, at most 2​(r−1)≤2​r2𝑟12𝑟2(r-1)\\leq 2r vertices need to be considered for each of the 2​r2𝑟2r endpoints.\nAny full reconnection of the set of endpoint vertices can be thought of as a permutation of this set, so there are at most (2​r)!2𝑟(2r)! possible new tours.\nIn total, for each fixed value of r𝑟r we thus get at most (|V|r)⋅(2​r)!⋅binomial𝑉𝑟2𝑟\\binom{|V|}{r}\\cdot(2r)! neighbouring tours, resulting in at most (k−1)⋅(|V|k)⋅(2​k)!∈O⁡(|V|k​(2​k+1)!)⋅𝑘1binomial𝑉𝑘2𝑘Osuperscript𝑉𝑘2𝑘1(k-1)\\cdot\\binom{|V|}{k}\\cdot(2k)!\\in\\operatorname{O}\\left(|V|^{k}(2k+1)!\\right) many neighbours for any given tour.\nTherefore, when k𝑘k is constant, the k𝑘k-Opt-neighbourhood of any configuration is efficiently searchable.\nThe same bound holds for k𝑘k-Opt of ATSP, where fewer of the reconnections outlined above are feasible.\nIn particular, for ATSP a valid heuristic is only given for k≥3𝑘3k\\geq 3, as the unique new (undirected) tour given by any application of the 222-Opt procedure does not form a valid directed cycle. Similarly to [ERV16], we assume that an initial tour of the graph is given or can be queried by an oracle, because even the problem of deciding whether a Hamiltonian cycle exists in a graph is NP-complete. For the smoothed version of TSP/k𝑘k-Opt and ATSP/k𝑘k-Opt, the edge weights wesubscript𝑤𝑒w_{e} are drawn from independent distributions fe: [ref]1⟶[0,ϕ]:subscript𝑓𝑒⟶010italic-ϕf_{e}: [ref]1\\longrightarrow[0,\\phi] each.\nOur analysis only makes use of the concept of a subset of edges that forms a cycle and thus applies to both, undirected and directed edges.\nNote that TSP can be reduced to ATSP in standard complexity by choosing symmetric edge weights, which introduces some overhead by doubling the representation size, as every edge is represented by a pair of opposing edges.\nHowever, under smoothed analysis, these two representations of TSP differ substantially, because both the opposing edges’ weights appear in the input of the problem, they experience independent noise in the ATSP problem, contrary to the single edge’s weight that appears in the input of the original TSP problem. The problem of computing a local optimum of TSP or ATSP with the k𝑘k-Opt heuristic (for constant k𝑘k), on a graph with m𝑚m edges, whose weights we,e∈Esubscript𝑤𝑒𝑒𝐸w_{e},e\\in E are drawn independently from distributions with densities fe: [ref]1→[0,ϕ]:subscript𝑓𝑒→010italic-ϕf_{e}: [ref]1\\to[0,\\phi], has polynomial smoothed complexity, i.e. the expected number of iterations of the local search algorithm can be bounded by O⁡(4k2​mk+2​ϕ)Osuperscript4superscript𝑘2superscript𝑚𝑘2italic-ϕ\\operatorname{O}\\left(4^{k^{2}}m^{k+2}\\phi\\right). We define a binary (M=1𝑀1M=1) CLO problem. Each component of the cost-part corresponds to an edge in the graph, i.e. ν=m𝜈𝑚\\nu=m and the cost part is 𝒔∙=(se)e∈Esuperscript𝒔∙subscriptsubscript𝑠𝑒𝑒𝐸\\bm{s}^{\\bullet}=(s_{e})_{e\\in E}.\nA tour 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is mapped to a CLO configuration 𝒔​(𝒞)𝒔𝒞\\bm{s}(\\mathcal{C}) by indicating which edges are being used in it: The cost coefficients are given by ce=wesubscript𝑐𝑒subscript𝑤𝑒c_{e}=w_{e}.\nBy this model, the one-to-one correspondence between the tours and the configurations of the CLO problem is immediate, as either is a representation of a subset of edges and their costs coincide.\nThe neighbourhood relation for the CLO problem is derived directly from the neighbouring tours in the TSP/k𝑘k-Opt instance.\nBecause the CLO cost coefficients are equal to the edge weights, the smoothed costs of the TSP instance also translate directly to the smoothed CLO model in Theorem 3.2.\nWe establish the remaining properties of the theorem (a covering (ℰ,ℐ)ℰℐ(\\mathcal{E},\\mathcal{I}) and its parameters λ=mk,μ∈{1,2},β=2​k2formulae-sequence𝜆superscript𝑚𝑘formulae-sequence𝜇12𝛽2superscript𝑘2\\lambda=m^{k},\\mu\\in\\{1,2\\},\\beta=2k^{2}) in the following. For the coordinate cover, we can simply use the singleton coordinate clusters: ℐ={{e}|e∈E}ℐconditional-set𝑒𝑒𝐸\\mathcal{I}=\\{\\{e\\}\\;\\left|\\;e\\right.\\in E\\}.\nTo cover the neighbourhood graph, we define transition clusters E​(e1,…,ek)𝐸subscript𝑒1…subscript𝑒𝑘E(e_{1},\\dots,e_{k}) for any choice of ei∈Esubscript𝑒𝑖𝐸e_{i}\\in E.\nEach cluster captures the set of transitions where the given edges eisubscript𝑒𝑖e_{i} are removed from the tour and replaced by (equally many) other edges to form a new tour.\nNote that we allow for some edges to coincide, ei=ejsubscript𝑒𝑖subscript𝑒𝑗e_{i}=e_{j}, to account for transitions where fewer than k𝑘k edges are replaced.\nTherefore we use λ=mk𝜆superscript𝑚𝑘\\lambda=m^{k} as the number of clusters for any choice of edges. Next, we investigate for every transition cluster E​(e1,…,ek)𝐸subscript𝑒1…subscript𝑒𝑘E(e_{1},\\dots,e_{k}) which edges can possibly replace the removed ones to form a new tour.\nThis is equivalent to determining the core of each transition cluster and allows us to settle β𝛽\\beta.\nNote that this is not the same as the number of neighbours of a given tour.\nWhen a subset of k𝑘k edges is removed from a tour, there remains a set of k𝑘k paths.\nNote that some of these paths might be degenerate in the sense that they only contain a single vertex, which occurs when two adjacent ei,ejsubscript𝑒𝑖subscript𝑒𝑗e_{i},e_{j} are removed from the tour.\nWe call these vertices isolated.\nDenote by k1subscript𝑘1k_{1} the number of isolated vertices and by k2subscript𝑘2k_{2} the number of proper paths that remain, thus k=k1+k2𝑘subscript𝑘1subscript𝑘2k=k_{1}+k_{2}.\nIn order to form a new tour, each of the endpoints and isolated vertices needs to be reconnected.\nClearly, we need to reconnect the vertices within this set, as every other vertex in the graph still has 222 incident edges.\nAdditionally, we also do not reconnect them to their previous neighbour (or neighbours in the case of an isolated vertex).\nFor every end point of a non-degenerate path, the edge that leads to the other end point of the same path also cannot be used, as this would create a short cycle.\nIn total, we thus have k1+2​k2subscript𝑘12subscript𝑘2k_{1}+2k_{2} vertices that need to be reconnected and each of them has at most k1+2​k2−3subscript𝑘12subscript𝑘23k_{1}+2k_{2}-3 possible edges to reconnect them properly.\nNote that due to symmetry, every edge we count appears twice in the analysis, so we can bound the number of possible edges that can be added to form a new tour by and together with the k𝑘k edges that are being removed, at most β=2​k2𝛽2superscript𝑘2\\beta=2k^{2} different edges can be affected by any transition cluster.\nThis argument, and therefore also the bound, still holds when a set of r<k𝑟𝑘r<k edges are replaced from a tour. Regarding μ𝜇\\mu, we need to bound the number of possible values of se−se′subscript𝑠𝑒superscriptsubscript𝑠𝑒′s_{e}-s_{e}^{\\prime} for any transition (𝒔,𝒔′)𝒔superscript𝒔′(\\bm{s},\\bm{s}^{\\prime}) within a given transition cluster E​(e1,…,ek)𝐸subscript𝑒1…subscript𝑒𝑘E(e_{1},\\dots,e_{k}).\nFor edges e∈{e1,…,ek}𝑒subscript𝑒1…subscript𝑒𝑘e\\in\\{e_{1},\\dots,e_{k}\\} that are removed, we observe se−se′=1subscript𝑠𝑒superscriptsubscript𝑠𝑒′1s_{e}-s_{e}^{\\prime}=1, whereas for any of the previously discussed edges e𝑒e that can possibly be added to form a new tour, we have se−se′∈{0,−1}subscript𝑠𝑒superscriptsubscript𝑠𝑒′01s_{e}-s_{e}^{\\prime}\\in\\{0,-1\\}, depending on whether it is actually used in the new tour represented by the configuration 𝒔′superscript𝒔′\\bm{s}^{\\prime} or not.\nTherefore we conclude with μ=2𝜇2\\mu=2 and apply Theorem 3.2 with the derived parameters to get a bound on the expected number of iterations for TSP/k𝑘k-Opt of ∎ A slightly more refined analysis allows to improve the constant for TSP/222-Opt:\nWhen removing two edges from a given tour, there exists only one other possibility to construct a new tour, as from the three neighbouring vertices available for reconnection, one is the previous neighbour and another is the other end of the same path.\nTherefore, we can choose μ=1𝜇1\\mu=1 instead, as we know precisely which edges are being added to the tour, and get a bound on the expected number of iterations of 3​mk+2​ϕ3superscript𝑚𝑘2italic-ϕ3m^{k+2}\\phi instead.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: smoothed running time for the 222-Opt heuristic for TSP in the input model where the graph nodes are given as points in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, drawn from independent distributions over  [ref]1dsuperscript01𝑑 [ref]1^{d} with density bounded by ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi, and their pair-wise distances follow the Lpsubscript𝐿𝑝L_{p} metric.\nThis result has later been improved in [MV13] for the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
