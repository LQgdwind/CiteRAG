      "content": "Paper Title: Object Scene Representation Transformer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeural rendering is a large, promising field that investigates the use of machine learning for graphics applications .\nRecently, NeRF  has sparked a renewed wave of interest in this field by optimizing an MLP to parameterize a single volumetric scene representation and demonstrating photo-realistic results on real-world scenes, later also for uncurated in-the-wild data .\nFurther methods based on NeRF are able to generalize across scenes by means of reprojecting 3D points into 2D feature maps  , though they lack a global 3D-based scene representation that could be readily used for downstream applications. Meanwhile, there have been early successes with global latent models  , though these rarely scale beyond simple datasets of single oriented objects on uniform backgrounds [ref]20.\nAlternative approaches produce higher-quality results by employing a computationally expensive auto-regressive generative mechanisms that does not produce spatially or temporally consistent results .\nRecently, the Scene Representation Transformer (SRT)  has been proposed as a global-latent model that efficiently scales to highly complex scenes by means of replacing the volumetric parametrization with a light field formulation. Prior works on object-centric learning, such as MONet , IODINE [ref]9, SPACE  and Slot Attention [ref]23 have demonstrated that it is possible to learn models that decompose images into objects using simple unsupervised image reconstruction objectives.\nThese methods typically use a structured latent space and employ dedicated inductive biases in their architectures and image decoders. To handle depth and occlusion in 3D scenes, these methods typically employ a generative model which handles occlusion via alpha-blending [ref]9 [ref]23 or by, e.g., generating objects ordered by their distance to the camera  .\nWe refer to the survey by Greff et al. 0 for an overview.\nRecent progress in this line of research applies these core inductive biases to work on images of more complex scenes 0 or video data 7 9.\nIn our OSRT model, we make use of the ubiquitous Slot Attention [ref]23 module because of its efficiency and effectiveness. Several recent works have extended self-supervised object-centric methods to 3D scenes  3 . One of the first such approaches is ROOTS , a probabilistic generative model that represents the scene in terms of a 3D feature map, where each 3D \"patch\" describes the presence (or absence) of an object. Each discovered object is independently rendered using a GQN  decoder and the final image is recomposed using Spatial Transformer Networks 4. Further prior works that are the most relevant to our method are ObSuRF 3 and uORF , both combining learned volumetric representations  with Slot Attention [ref]23 and Spatial Broadcast decoders 7.\nBoth methods have been shown to be capable of modeling 3D scenes of slightly higher complexity than CLEVR 6. ObSuRF’s architecture is based on NeRF-VAE [ref]20.\nIt bypasses the extraordinary memory requirements of the Spatial Broadcast decoder combined with volumetric rendering during training by using ground-truth depth information, thereby needing only 2 samples per ray instead of hundreds.\nDuring inference, at the absence of ground-truth depth information, ObSuRF however suffers from the expected high computational cost of object-centric volumetric rendering. uORF is based on an encoder-decoder architecture that explicitly handles foreground (FG) and background (BG) separately through a set of built-in inductive biases and assumptions on the dataset.\nFor instance, the dedicated BG slot is parameterized differently, and FG slots are encouraged to only produce density inside a manually specified area of the scene.\nThe model is trained using a combination of perceptual losses, and optionally also with an adversarial loss . In order to obtain the results for ObSuRF and uORF, we used the available official implementations, and consulted the respective authors of both methods to ensure correct adaptation to new datasets. Finally, a separate line of work considers purely generative object-centric 3D rendering without the ability to render novel views of a specifically provided input scene. GIRAFFE  addresses this problem by combining volumetric rendering with a GAN-based  loss.\nIt separately parameterizes object appearance and 3D pose for controllable image synthesis.\nInspired thereof, INFERNO  combines a generative model with a Slot Attention-based inference model to learn object-centric 3D scene representations.\nWe do not explicitly compare to INFERNO as it is similar to ObSuRF and uORF, while only shown capable of modeling CLEVR-like scenes of lower visual complexity.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: downstream applications. Meanwhile, there have been early successes with global latent models  , though these rarely scale beyond simple datasets of single oriented objects on uniform backgrounds [ref]20.\nAlternative approaches produce higher-quality results by employing a computationally expensive auto-regressive generative mechanisms that does not produce spatially or temporally consistent\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
