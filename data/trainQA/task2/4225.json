      "content": "Paper Title: Provably Efficient Model-Free Constrained RL with Linear Function Approximation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModel-based RL algorithms have been proposed for the CMDP      [ref]7. Apart from [ref]7, the rest considered tabular set-up. In the tabular model-based set-up, the best known regret and constraint violations achieved are 𝒪~​(|𝒮|2​|𝒜|​T)~𝒪superscript𝒮2𝒜𝑇\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{S}|^{2}|\\mathcal{A}|T}) where |𝒮|𝒮|\\mathcal{S}| and |𝒜|𝒜|\\mathcal{A}| are the dimensions of the state and action spaces respectively. Hence, such results can not cope up with the large state space. [ref]7 considered linear kernel MDP whereas we consider linear MDP. These two are not the same in general. We describe the differences with the algorithm proposed in [ref]7 in Section 4.1. Model-free RL algorithms have also been proposed   0 to solve CMDP. However, all of the above require a generator model, which simulates from any state and action. 3 proposed a ‘triple-Q’ algorithm which does not require a ’simulator’. However, it only considered tabular setting. The regret bound shown in 3 is 𝒪~​(T0.8)~𝒪superscript𝑇0.8\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{0.8}) which is far from the optimal for the model-based case 𝒪~​(T)~𝒪𝑇\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T}). Please see Table 1 to see our contribution compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. 5 proposed a RL algorithm for the scenario where a constraint needs to be satisfied at each step of an episode. We consider a constraint where the cumulative utility over the length of the episodes must exceed a threshold. Hence, the set of constraints is fundamentally different. The authors in 5 also assumed that a safe-action is known for each state which we do not assume in our setting. We can reduce the violation to 00 for large enough T𝑇T (finite) while maintaining the same order of regret with respect to T𝑇T (Appendix H). We replace ρ𝜌\\rho (ξ𝜉\\xi in our paper) by 𝒪​(H)𝒪𝐻\\mathcal{O}(H) similar to our paper and 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N} by |𝒮|𝒮|\\mathcal{S}|.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Model-based RL algorithms have been proposed for the CMDP      [ref]7.
