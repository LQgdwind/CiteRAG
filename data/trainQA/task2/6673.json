      "content": "Paper Title: Argument Attribution Explanations in Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (Technical Report)\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExplainable AI (XAI) is playing an increasingly important role in AI\ntowards safety, reliability and trustworthiness [ref]1.\nVarious methods have been proposed in this field for providing explanations for several AI algorithms, models, and systems (e.g. see recent overviews  [ref]1). A popular category of explanation methods is feature attribution, aiming at assigning a “feature importance score\" to each input feature fed to the AI of interest (notably machine learning models), denoting its contribution\nto the output decision by the AI. Feature attribution methods include, amongst others, LIME , SHAP , SILO  and gradient-scoring .\nExplanations returned by feature attribution methods are intuitive in that they focus on explaining the outputs in terms of the inputs alone, making it unnecessary to go into the details of the inner mechanism of the underlying AI.\nFurthermore,\nfeature attribution explanations are easy for people to understand by just checking the positive or negative influence of the input features towards the outputs and the ranking of the magnitude of the scores.\n Alongside feature attribution methods,\nin recent years argumentative XAI is increasingly showing\nbenefits\nfor various forms of AI (see   for overviews).\nBasically, argumentative XAI applies computational argumentation  to extract argumentation frameworks (AFs) as skeletons for explanations. For example, \nuses abstract AFs  to explain the outputs of schedulers,\n[ref]34 proposes to use weighted bipolar AFs to explain multi-layer perceptrons and [ref]17 propose to use Quantitative Bipolar AFs (QBAFs)  to explain movie review aggregations.\nWhereas feature attribution methods\nfocus on the input-output behaviour of the underlying AI,\nAFs as explanations point to the\ndialectical relationships among arguments, abstractly representing interactions among the inner components of the underlying AI encoded by the AFs. These AFs provide a natural mechanism for users to interact with the AI  and\nmay help find irrationalities in the underlying AI to aid debugging and improving the AI . Existing forms of argumentative XAI\nare predominantly qualitative in that they focus on\nexplaining\nthe reasoning outcomes of AFs with debates/disputes/dialogues in\nthe spirit of extension-based semantics (e.g. as in ). These qualitative explanations mirror\ninteractions within the inner mechanism of the underpinning AI as dialectical exchanges between arguments. For example,  use ‘explanation via (non-)attacks’ and [ref]17 define explanations as template-driven dialogues using attacks and supports in the AFs.\nInstead,\nexplaining the quantitative\nreasoning outcomes of AFs under gradual semantics (e.g. those proposed in  [ref]34) has not received\nmuch attention, in spite of the widespread use of this form of semantics in several applications (e.g. fake news detection , movie recommendations [ref]17 and fraud detection ). However,\nin many application settings, it is important to see how arguments in AFs topically influence one another, and how much positive/negative influence is transmitted from one argument to another.\nThis is especially the case when explanations are needed for a topic argument of interest (e.g. an argument corresponding to the output of a classifier as in  [ref]34) and it is essential to assess which arguments have more importance towards the topic argument. In this paper, we contribute to filling this gap by proposing a novel theory of Argument Attribution Explanations (AAEs) by incorporating the spirit of feature attribution from machine learning in the context of QBAFs.\nWith respect to qualitative explanations alone,\nAAEs allow to measure and compare the contribution of different arguments towards topic arguments in QBAFs under the Discontinuity Free Quantitative Argumentation Debate (DF-QuAD) gradual semantics , even when the comparison is difficult with qualitative explanations alone.\nThis is the case with large QBAFs as visualized in Figure 1 from , where it is hard to see how quantitative explanations can be intuitively delivered for the children of the root as topic arguments.111AAEs for this example can be found\nin\nthe Supplementary Material (SM). Additionally, AAEs take the base scores of arguments in QBAFs into account. Different base scores should give rise to different explanations, but qualitative explanations disregard base scores, as they only consider the QBAFs’ structure regardless of quantitative information.\n In this paper, we formalize AAEs and analyze\nsome qualitative and quantitative guarantees for different types of connectivity in QBAFs.\nWe then study several desirable properties of AAEs as explanations, including some adapted from the literature and some novel ones.\nFinally, we show the applicability of AAEs in two scenarios: fake news detection  and movie recommender systems [ref]17.\nOverall,\nthe contribution of this paper is threefold. We propose the novel theory of AAEs (Section 4). We study (new and adapted) desirable properties of AAEs as explanations (Section 5). We show applicability of AAEs in practice (Section 6). The proofs of all results are\nin\nthe SM.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Explainable AI (XAI) is playing an increasingly important role in AI\ntowards safety, reliability and trustworthiness [ref]1.\nVarious methods have been proposed in this field for providing explanations for several AI algorithms, models, and systems (e.g. see recent overviews  [ref]1).
