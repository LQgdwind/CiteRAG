      "content": "Paper Title: On the Compression of Language Models for Code: An Empirical Study on CodeBERT\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe growing adoption of transformer-based Language Models (LMs) has radically transformed the software engineering (SE) field in recent years. These models have been effectively applied to a wide array of SE tasks, including vulnerability detection [ref]1, code summarization , and code search , consistently demonstrating superior performance over traditional approaches .\nHowever, despite their impressive capabilities, the widespread adoption of these models is often hindered by practical challenges, particularly their high computational cost . The deployment of LMs typically requires computations across millions or even billions of learned parameters, resulting in significant memory demands and high inference latency. To address this issue, AI researchers have developed various strategies over the past decade to reduce the size and computational cost of LMs, including techniques such as knowledge distillation , quantization , and pruning .\nThese “model compression” strategies can reduce the memory demand of LMs and/or speed up their inference times, albeit often at the cost of reduced effectiveness (i.e., prediction correctness). These strategies have recently begun to gain attention in the field of software engineering [ref]9  [ref]11.\nFor instance, Shi et al. [ref]9 applied knowledge distillation to drastically reduce the memory size of models of code.\nWei et al. [ref]11 have investigated the impact of quantization on code generation tasks regarding inference latency, memory consumption, and carbon footprint.\nHowever, despite these initial efforts, the broader impact of compression strategies on software engineering tasks remains largely unexplored.\nMost existing research has focused on specific compression strategies applied to individual SE tasks, making it difficult to determine whether specific strategies perform better than others on particular tasks.\nAdditionally, it is unclear if the impact of different strategies varies by task or if they demonstrate similar behavior across different software engineering tasks. In this study, we investigate the impact of different model compression strategies across three software engineering tasks: vulnerability detection (code classification), code summarization (code-to-text generation), and code search (text-to-code recommendation). We fine-tune a well-known language model for code, CodeBERT , on each of these tasks. Subsequently, we assess how three model compression strategies – namely, knowledge distillation, quantization, and pruning – affect (i) the effectiveness of the LM in performing the task, (ii) inference latency, and (iii) the model’s memory size. Our results provide practitioners and researchers with guidelines on balancing the trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency when selecting a model compression strategy. In summary, the main contributions of this work are: An extensive empirical evaluation of the impact of three compression strategies, namely knowledge distillation, quantization, and pruning on inference time, model size and effectiveness of LMs fine-tuned on the vulnerability detection, code summarization and code search tasks;\n Insights for practitioners and researchers on the adoption of those compression strategies; A publicly available replication package of our empirical study .\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Models (LMs) has radically transformed the software engineering (SE) field in recent years.
