      "content": "Paper Title: From Holant to Quantum Entanglement and Back\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are many natural connections between Holant problems and quantum theory.\nThe introduction of Holant problems is inspired by holographic transformations . Such a holographic transformation applied separately on each qubit i𝑖i with a matrix Aisubscript𝐴𝑖A_{i} is just a SLOCC in quantum theory.\nAlso, many known P-time computable\nsignature sets for Holant problems can be clearly described in the quantum literature  [ref]2\nand they correspond directly to sets of states that are of independent interest in quantum theory  . Going beyond that, Backens recently applied knowledge from the theory of quantum entanglement, directly to the study of Holant problems and derived new dichotomy results [ref]2 .\nWe give a short description for these results in this subsection.\nWe use ⟨Φ|braΦ\\langle\\Phi| to denote the Hermitian adjoint (complex conjugate) of |Φ⟩ketΦ|\\Phi\\rangle, and ⟨Φ|Ψ⟩inner-productΦΨ\\langle\\Phi|\\Psi\\rangle to denote the (complex) inner product of two n𝑛n-qubit states. The projection of the i𝑖i-th qubit of an n𝑛n-qubit (n⩾2)𝑛2(n\\geqslant 2) state |Ψ⟩ketΨ|{\\Psi}\\rangle onto a single-qubit state |θ⟩=a​|0⟩+b​|1⟩ket𝜃𝑎ket0𝑏ket1|\\theta\\rangle=a|0\\rangle+b|1\\rangle is defined as\n⟨θ|i​|Ψ⟩=a¯​|Ψi0⟩+b¯​|Ψi1⟩subscriptbra𝜃𝑖ketΨ¯𝑎ketsuperscriptsubscriptΨ𝑖0¯𝑏ketsuperscriptsubscriptΨ𝑖1\\langle\\theta|_{i}|\\Psi\\rangle=\\bar{a}|{\\Psi}_{i}^{0}\\rangle+\\bar{b}|{\\Psi_{i}^{1}}\\rangle where\na¯¯𝑎\\bar{a} and b¯¯𝑏\\bar{b} are complex conjugates of a𝑎a and b𝑏b, and\n|Ψi0⟩ketsuperscriptsubscriptΨ𝑖0|{\\Psi}_{i}^{0}\\rangle and |Ψi1⟩ketsuperscriptsubscriptΨ𝑖1|{\\Psi_{i}^{1}}\\rangle are states of the remaining\nn−1𝑛1n-1 qubits\nwhen the i-th qubit of |Ψ⟩ketΨ|{\\Psi}\\rangle is set to 00 and 111 respectively.\n Let |Ψ⟩ketΨ|{\\Psi}\\rangle be a genuinely entangled n𝑛n-qubit (n⩾3)𝑛3(n\\geqslant 3) state. For any two qubits of |Ψ⟩ketΨ|{\\Psi}\\rangle, there exist projections of the other n−2𝑛2n-2 qubits onto n−2𝑛2n-2 many single-qubit states that result in an entangled 2-qubit state. This result was presented to show that any pure entangled multipartite quantum state violates some Bell’s inequality .\nThe original proof \nwas flawed and was corrected recently .\nTheorem 1.4 shows that two particle entanglement can be realized via\nperforming\nlocal projections on a multiparticle state.\nIt is observed in [ref]2 that the theorem holds\neven when restricted to only local projections onto computational or Hadamard basis states, i.e., |0⟩ket0|{0}\\rangle, |1⟩ket1|{1}\\rangle, |+⟩=|0⟩+|1⟩ketket0ket1|{+}\\rangle=|{0}\\rangle+|{1}\\rangle and |−⟩=|0⟩−|1⟩ketket0ket1|{-}\\rangle=|{0}\\rangle-|{1}\\rangle. Based on Theorem 1.4 and the inductive entanglement classification under SLOCC equivalence 6 5 [ref]1, Backens\nshowed that\nbeyond\nentangled 2-qubit states, genuinely entangled 3-qubit states can be realized via local projections onto computational or Hadamard basis states (Theorem 12 in [ref]2).\nThis theorem is equivalent to the following inductive statement.\n Let |Ψ⟩ketΨ|{\\Psi}\\rangle be an n𝑛n-qubit (n⩾4)𝑛4(n\\geqslant 4) state exhibiting multipartite entanglement. Then, there exists some i𝑖i and some |θ⟩∈{|0⟩,|1⟩,|+⟩,|−⟩}ket𝜃ket0ket1ketket|\\theta\\rangle\\in\\{|{0}\\rangle,|{1}\\rangle,|{+}\\rangle,|{-}\\rangle\\} such that\n⟨θ|i​|Ψ⟩subscriptbra𝜃𝑖ketΨ\\langle\\theta|_{i}|\\Psi\\rangle exhibits multipartite entanglement.\n Remark:\nThis result shows that multipartite entanglement of an n𝑛n-qubit (n⩾4)𝑛4(n\\geqslant 4) state can be preserved under projections onto states |0⟩ket0|{0}\\rangle, |1⟩ket1|{1}\\rangle, |+⟩ket|{+}\\rangle and |−⟩ket|{-}\\rangle. The Holant(ℱ)+{}^{+}(\\mathcal{F}) problem is defined as Holant⁡(ℱ∪{|0⟩,|1⟩,|+⟩,|−⟩})Holantℱket0ket1ketket\\operatorname{Holant}(\\mathcal{F}\\cup\\{|{0}\\rangle,|{1}\\rangle,|{+}\\rangle,|{-}\\rangle\\}).\nAccording to Theorem 1.5,\nwe know that in the framework of Holant+ problems, a genuinely entangled 3-qubit state can always be realized from an n𝑛n-qubit (n⩾4𝑛4n\\geqslant 4) state exhibiting multipartite entanglement.\nThen, using a genuinely entangled 3-qubit state,\na full dichotomy was proved for Holant+ problems [ref]2.\nLater, it was generalized to Holantc problems   where Holantc⁡(ℱ)superscriptHolant𝑐ℱ\\operatorname{Holant}^{c}(\\mathcal{F})\nis defined as Holant⁡(ℱ∪{|0⟩,|1⟩})Holantℱket0ket1\\operatorname{Holant}(\\mathcal{F}\\cup\\{|{0}\\rangle,|{1}\\rangle\\}).\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: i𝑖i with a matrix Aisubscript𝐴𝑖A_{i} is just a SLOCC in quantum theory.\nAlso, many known P-time computable\nsignature sets for Holant problems can be clearly described in the quantum literature  [ref]2\nand they correspond directly to sets of states that are of independent interest in quantum theory  .
