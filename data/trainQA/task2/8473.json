      "content": "Paper Title: Sampling from exponential distributions in the time domain with superparamagnetic tunnel junctions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this work, we demonstrate how concepts from temporal computing and probabilistic computing literature can reinforce each other, resulting in techniques that can benefit both computing paradigms. First, we use the flagship device technology of probabilistic computing, namely the superparamagnetic MTJ, to create a novel primitive for temporal computing: the probabilistic delay cell with tunable mean delay τ\\tau, or equivalently, the rate parameter λ\\lambda. Conventionally, only deterministic delay cells have been used in temporal computing, limiting the ability of temporal systems to perform probabilistic computations. Replacing the delay element in temporal memories as described in   with a probabilistic delay cell opens up an array of statistical operations that could not be previously implemented in the temporal domain. Such operations are particularly useful in the context of energy-efficient architectures for machine learning operations such as convolution [ref]43, matrix multiplication  , median filtering  and others. We also show how using the time domain for sensing and computation allows for the sampling of programmable exponential distributions, which are common to energy-based probabilistic models of computing. Though the exponential dwell time distributions of SMTJ devices are well understood and often used in the characterization of device properties [ref]24  [ref]45, they have not been directly used in sampling or computation. The temporal information  representation coupled with simple CMOS primitives allow readout and energy-efficient translation of exponentially distributed probabilistic delay times into digital values. These values can be used to flip spins in an Ising machine  or change the neuron state in a Boltzmann machine , both of which can utilize exponential distributions to set their state acceptance probabilities. The exponential behavior that results from barrier crossing, such as the one proposed in this work, is also seen in other device technologies. Single-photon-avalanche-diode(SPAD)-based circuits, which also generate Poissonian event statistics derived from statistics of photon arrival times, have been recently proposed as another CMOS compatible technology to solve Ising and Potts models  . These circuits have also been used with a clock period tuned to the median time of switching events to generate uniform random numbers in a temporal way, similar to the approach presented in this work . Metal oxide memristors, another back-end-of-the-line compatible technology, also exhibit random telegraph noise in their high resistance state  . This is attributed to the redistribution of oxygen vacancies in the device, which can also be used as another source of generating exponentially distributed switching events, but lacks the advantage of current tunability. Finally, some energetic considerations remain regarding the integrability and efficiency of circuits presented in this work. In the composite circuit described in Fig. 2(a), all subcircuits can be efficiently incorporated into integrated implementations except for the timing measurement circuits, which will incur significant energy costs  if repeatedly instantiated with each delay cell. It has been previously shown that the energy cost of such timing measurements can be amortized by using them only at the final stages of a temporal computation  . On the other hand, the functionality provided by the transconductance and hysteresis stages on a printed circuit board can be efficiently performed by more compact integrated implementations. The voltage-controlled current source, shown in Fig. 2(a), can be replaced by a self-resetting cascode stage . The cascode stage can provide the functionality of the current source, while the self-resetting design of the circuit allows for the current to be stopped as soon as the SR latch switches to a high state, hence further reducing static power consumption. Similarly, complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) hysteresis comparators (also known as Schmitt triggers ) and latches are relatively cheap to implement, requiring only a handful of transistors. In this way, the circuits described in this work pave the way for integrated implementations of hybrid-probabilistic-temporal computers.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: not be previously implemented in the temporal domain. Such operations are particularly useful in the context of energy-efficient architectures for machine learning operations such as convolution [ref]43, matrix multiplication  , median filtering  and others.
