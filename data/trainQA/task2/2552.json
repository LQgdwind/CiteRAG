      "content": "Paper Title: DQ-GAT: Towards Safe and Efficient Autonomous Driving with Deep Q-Learning and Graph Attention Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIL is the dominant approach for learning-based AD due to its sample efficiency, where a deep neural network is trained to mimic expert driving behaviors using supervised learning[ref]11 [ref]12    . Based on the collected demonstrations (i.e., observation-action pairs), the model compares the error between its prediction and the labelled data from human drivers, then adjusts its weights using gradient decent. End-to-end driving. With the powerful representation capabilities of deep neural networks, end-to-end driving approaches  [ref]12 [ref]11    directly take as input the raw sensor readings (e.g., LiDAR point clouds and camera images) to output control commands or future trajectories. For example, Codevilla et al.  proposed a conditional imitation learning approach that splits the network into multiple branches for discrete tasks such as follow lane and turn left/right. Follow-up works include [ref]12 and . However, these methods cannot handle complex road topologies such as multi-lane streets or roundabouts. Recently, Cai et al.[ref]11 used global routes as direction to achieve robust end-to-end navigation in complex dynamic environments with multi-modal sensor fusion. However, as with previous methods, the learned policy is reactive without efficient interaction with other road users. To summarize, it is quite challenging to learn a direct mapping from high dimensional sensory observations to low dimensional motion plans, as the end-to-end approaches conflate two aspects of driving: learning to see and learning to act. Therefore, they suffer from the domain gap problem in the perception stage, which leads to poor generalization performance in new environments. Learning to drive by semantic abstraction. Recently, another stream of work has arisen that uses semantic information to learn driving policies (e.g., HD maps, brid-eye-views (BEVs), and occupancy maps[ref]24). Compared to redundant sensory observations, this semantic information is a kind of concise and informative abstraction of perceptual results, and has better environmental consistency. These properties help the training process to focus on learning to act, which is more efficient and generalizable. For example, the policy network of [ref]24 takes as input hybrid features composed of the roadmap, traffic lights, route plans and dynamic objects to produce waypoints to follow. This has the advantage of helping the network to learn meaningful contextual cues behind the human driverâ€™s action and achieve more complex driving behaviors. However, [ref]24 mainly shows its results on offline logged data, and only performs closed-loop evaluation in simple environments with at most two obstacles. Such a problem also exists in other similar works. According to , the driving performance can vary significantly between offline open-loop and online closed-loop tests, and the latter can better reveal the driving quality. In this work, the observation is similar to those of  and [ref]24 but, differently, we focus more on dynamic, interactive and large-scale closed-loop driving performance. Limitations. Although the paradigm of IL is appealing, there still exist three major shortcomings that prevent IL from being applied to broader applications: 1) The cost of human driving data collection on a large scale can be prohibitive; 2) IL approaches are particularly sensitive to the dataset bias issue, as different drivers, or even the same driver in different moods, might have different driving preferences, thus the learning objective might be dominated by the main modes in the training data; 3) IL performs well for states that are covered by the training distribution, but it generalizes poorly to new states due to compounding action errors, which is also referred to as distribution mismatch.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: IL is the dominant approach for learning-based AD due to its sample efficiency, where a deep neural network is trained to mimic expert driving behaviors using supervised learning[ref]11 [ref]12    .
