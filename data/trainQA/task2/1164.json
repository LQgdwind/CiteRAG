Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Transductive Zero-Shot Learning using Cross-Modal CycleGAN\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor ImageNet, we compare CM-GAN to a variety of approaches: Standard (inductive) ZSL: DeViSE , CONSE [ref]12, SYNC  and EXEM [ref]17; Inductive generative: GAN-based model Gvf  (state-of-the-art on ImageNet-Full) and VAE-based models VZSL 5, CVAE-ZSL  and SE-ZSL 6; Transductive (non-generative): DIPL  (state-of-the-art on ImageNet-360). In DIPL, a projection matrix is learned to solve an optimization problem that (a) brings projection of visual feature close to semantic representations for seen classes, (b) brings projection of unseen visual features close to the closest unseen class representation; Transductive generative: f-VAEWGAN-D2  (state-of-the-art on attribute-based datasets). f-VAEGAN-D2, like most generative models, aims at learning a generator Gùê∫G to produce visual samples for unseen classes, and then train a supervised classifier on these synthetic data. Here, the generator Gùê∫G is trained on three objectives: (i) WGAN objective: Gùê∫G generates visual samples for seen classes, from Gaussian noise concatenated with the class vector, and a discriminator is trained to distinguish between Gùê∫G‚Äôs outputs and true data,\n(ii) VAE objective: a VAE is trained to reconstruct data from seen classes, and Gùê∫G is the VAE‚Äôs decoder,\nand (iii) transductive objective: Gùê∫G is the generator, and a discriminator is trained to distinguish between generated sampled for unseen classes and true samples. All reported results are extracted from the original papers, which explains that we could not report all metrics for all models. For DIPL and for f-VAEWGAN-D2, we re-implement their model to get ImageNet-Full scores. We note CONSE* our re-implementation of CONSE, which performs better than the original CONSE [ref]12 since we use the CNN network Inception-V3 7, which shows better performances than AlexNet 8. For MS COCO, as our unsupervised setting is new in the literature, we only compare to a supervised baseline, for which we suppose that the sentence-to-image alignment is known and\nthe ‚Ñís‚Äãu‚Äãpsubscript‚Ñíùë†ùë¢ùëù\\mathcal{L}_{sup} objective is optimized to map CONSE representation to the corresponding sentence vectors.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: For ImageNet, we compare CM-GAN to a variety of approaches: Standard (inductive) ZSL: DeViSE , CONSE [ref]12, SYNC  and EXEM [ref]17; Inductive generative: GAN-based model Gvf  (state-of-the-art on ImageNet-Full) and VAE-based models VZSL 5, CVAE-ZSL  and SE-ZSL 6; Transductive (non-generative):\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
