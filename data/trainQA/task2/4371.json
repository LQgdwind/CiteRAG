The basic idea is instance discrimination .\nRepresentative works include CMC [ref]44, SimCLR[ref]9\n, MoCo, SwAV, BYOL. There is also a stream of work focusing on refined sampling on different views for improved performance  [ref]44   9 .\nFor example, DCL proposed to debias the assumption that all negative pairs are true negatives. HCL9 extended DCL and proposed to mine hard negatives for contrastive learning, whose embeddings are uneasy to discriminate. Adversarial training (AT) stems from  and adopts a min-max training regime that optimizes the objective over adversaries generated by maximizing the loss 5       7. Some recent work introduced unlabeled data into AT     2. By leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data,   performed semi-supervised self-training to first generate pseudo-supervisions, then conducted conventional supervised AT. Our work explores how to learn robust models without any class labels. Some recent studies applied CL on adversarial training 2  8 , by considering adversaries as positive views for contrasting, such that the learned encoder renders robust data representations. RoCL 2 was the first to successfully show robust models can be learned in an unsupervised manner.\nAdvCL 8 proposed to empower CL with pseudo-supervision stimulus.\nSame as CL, these Adversarial CL methods perform symmetric contrast for all pairs, which could potentially induces conflicts in CL and AT training objectives. We are the first to investigate the asymmetric properties of Adversarial CL, by treating adversaries discriminatingly.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: CL has been widely applied to learn generalizable features from unlabeled data [ref]9  [ref]44     6   1.
