      "content": "Paper Title: Individual Fairness under Uncertainty\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe fairness notions mentioned above are used as a constraint or as a regularizer to enforce fairness. These debiasing algorithms, mostly group-based, can be categorized into three groups based on the stage where machine learning intervention happens: the pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing groups. The first group, pre-processing approaches, works on bias in the data or input stage, assuming that unbiased training data is accessible for a fair ML model. These methods modify the data distribution to ensure fairness of the representations from different groups and are model-agnostic. Examples of this group include data massaging , which changes data distribution, an extension called local massaging , and reweighing , which assigns different weights to the communities. The second group, in-processing approaches, directly changes ML algorithms to produce unbiased predictions and is generally model-specific. For example, in [ref]47, the fairness gain is incorporated into the splitting criteria of the Hoeffding Tree algorithm, which is later extended in  to ensemble-based methods. In , the Mann Whitney U test is applied to fairness learning in multi-task regression. These methods focus on group fairness and require complete class labels. Yet, there is a limited number of research on individual fairness under data censorship, which this work focuses on. The last group, post-processing approaches, modifies the decision boundaries to fairly represent diverse groups.\nExamples include building an interpretable model [ref]44, adjusting the decision threshold to reduce unfairness , and moving decision boundaries of the deprived communities to prevent discrimination . However, applying these techniques under censorship is not straightforward, as decision boundaries may also be censored owing to their distribution.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: different weights to the communities. The second group, in-processing approaches, directly changes ML algorithms to produce unbiased predictions and is generally model-specific. For example, in [ref]47, the fairness gain is incorporated into the splitting criteria of the Hoeffding Tree algorithm, which is later extended in  to ensemble-based methods. In , the Mann Whitney U test is applied\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
