      "content": "Paper Title: Sampling From Autoencoders‚Äô Latent Space via Quantization And Probability Mass Function Concepts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe realm of image generation in biometric imaging has undergone a notable surge in recent times, with a variety of generative models rooted in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) , as in   . In contrast, our approach charts a distinct path by employing autoencoder-based generative models for image synthesis. This decision is underpinned by the intricate and potentially unstable learning phase inherent to GANs, where improper tuning can lead to complications such as mode collapse . As a result, our focus in this study centers on the nuanced task of sampling within the latent space of autoencoders. Existing literature presents three primary strategies for latent space sampling within autoencoders. The first approach involves the incorporation of a prior distribution onto the latent space through a regularization term. To acquire a vector sample, we draw from this prior distribution. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)  are a representative model category following this strategy. However, a limitation of these methods emerges after training, where the latent space might not precisely adhere to the predefined prior distribution, leading to the emergence of clusters within the latent space [ref]10. Consequently, samples drawn from the prior distribution might deviate from the actual ground truth distribution. Consequently, the decoder model struggles to faithfully reconstruct these samples into tangible real-world data points [ref]10. The second avenue revolves around modeling clusters within the latent space through a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based sampling approach. This method entails fitting a GMM to the latent vectors from the training data, then generating new samples from this learned mixture model¬†[ref]10. Generally, this technique yields superior samples compared to sampling from a prior. However, due to the expansive nature of the Gaussian distribution across the entire Euclidean space, there are instances where generated samples fall outside the decoder network‚Äôs capacity to transform them into authentic real-world samples¬†[ref]4. Lastly, an alternative strategy involves the random sampling of latent vectors, followed by their manipulation through either discrete or continuous normalizing flows¬†[ref]2 , aiming to guide them towards high-density regions. Various methodologies to identify such high-density regions have been formulated in the literature [ref]2 [ref]4  . Nonetheless, these techniques entail significant computational overhead and are applicable only to specific types of autoencoder-based models necessitating tailored model architectures . For instance, the approach presented in [ref]4 introduces supplementary learnable layers to estimate the metric of the latent space, which assumes the form of a Riemannian manifold. Within the scope of this study, we craft a novel technique for sampling from latent spaces, a methodology that can be seamlessly integrated with any autoencoder model. Our approach effectively sidesteps the challenge of drawing samples from regions that cannot be faithfully reconstructed into authentic real-world images, a shortcoming often encountered in GMM sampling. This bears significance in biometrics, where superior latent samples can be adeptly transformed into highly realistic synthetic images.\nAs a solution, we present a post-training density estimation algorithm designed to operate on the latent space of any autoencoder-based generative model. This algorithm employs both a quantization step and the concept of probability mass function. The salient attribute of our algorithm lies in its impressive time complexity of ùí™‚Äã(n√ód)ùí™ùëõùëë\\mathcal{O}(n\\times d), where nùëõn denotes the dataset size and dùëëd symbolizes the latent space dimension. This translates into a significant acceleration in runtime compared to GMM sampling. Moreover, we validate the quality of the generated images through our methodology both qualitatively and quantitatively. This validation is performed on three distinct image generation benchmark datasets (including two in the biometric domain) and five distinct autoencoder-based models.\nIn terms of image quality gauged by the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) metric, our approach demonstrates a considerable enhancement compared to GMM sampling. Specifically, on the MNIST , CelebA , and MOBIUS      datasets, we achieve improvements of up to 0.890.890.89, 1.691.691.69, and 0.870.870.87 respectively when compared to GMM sampling. To delve into the specifics, Section 2 presents related works addressing the challenge of latent space sampling within autoencoders. In Section 3, we introduce essential background definitions and notations. The mechanics of our sampling methodology, anchored in quantization and probability mass function concepts, are presented in Section 4. The efficacy of our method in image generation is rigorously tested and verified across diverse datasets in Section 5. Lastly, we conclude and outline avenues for future exploration in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: of these methods emerges after training, where the latent space might not precisely adhere to the predefined prior distribution, leading to the emergence of clusters within the latent space [ref]10.
